                         HENRY LEROUX wrote busily 
                         on. The light of the table 
                         lamp, softened and enriched 
                         by its mosaic shade, gave an 
                         appearance of added opulence to the 
                         already handsome appointments of the 
                         room. The little table clock ticked 
                         merrily from half past eleven to a 
                         quarter to twelve. 
                     
                     
                         Into the cozy, bookish atmosphere of 
                         the novelist's study penetrated the 
                         muffled chime of Big Ben; it chimed 
                         the three-quarters. But, with his mind 
                     
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         centered upon his work, Leroux wrote 
                         on ceaselessly. 
                     
                     
                         An odd figure of a man was this 
                         popular novelist, with patchy and un- 
                         tidy hair which lessened the otherwise 
                         striking contour of his brow. A 
                         neglected and unpicturesque figure, in a 
                         baggy, neutral-colored dressing gown; 
                         a figure more fitted to a garret than 
                         to this spacious, luxurious workroom, 
                         with the soft light playing upon rank 
                         after rank of rare and costly editions, 
                         deepening the tones in the Persian car- 
                         pet, making red morocco more red, 
                         purifying the vellum and regilding the 
                         gold of the choice bindings, caressing

                         lovingly the busts and statuettes sur- 
                         mounting the bookshelves, and twin- 
                         kling upon the scantily covered crown 
                         of Henry Leroux. The doorbell rang. 
                     
                     
                         Leroux, heedless of external mat- 
                         ters, pursued his work. But the door- 
                         bell rang again and continued to ring. 
                     
                     
                         "Soames! Soames!" Leroux raised 
                         his voice irascibly, continuing to write 
                         the while. "Where the devil are you! 
                         Can't you hear the doorbell?" 
                     
                     
                         Soames did not reveal himself; and 
                         to the ringing of the bell was added the 
                         unmistakable rattling of a letter box. 
                     
                     
                         "Soames!" Leroux put down his 
                         pen and stood up. "Darn it! He's out! 
                         I have no memory!" 
                     
                     
                         He retied the girdle of his dressing 
                         gown, which had become unfastened, 
                         and opened the study door. Opposite, 
                         across the entrance lobby, was the outer 
                         door; and in the light from the lobby 
                         lamp he perceived two laughing eyes 
                         peering in under the upraised flap of 
                         the letter box. The ringing ceased. 
                     
                     
                         "Are you very angry with me for in- 
                         terrupting you?" cried a girl's voice. 
                     
                     
                         "My dear Miss Cumberly!" said Le- 
                         roux, without irritation. "On the con- 
                         trary--er--I am delighted to see you-- 
                         or, rather, to hear you. There is no- 
                         body at home, you know." 
                     
                     
                         "I do know," replied the girl firmly, 
                         "and I know something else, also. Fa- 
                         ther assures me that you simply starve 
                         yourself when Mrs. Leroux is away! 
                         So I have brought down an omelet!" 
                     
                     
                         "Omelet!" muttered Leroux, ad- 
                         vancing toward the door. "You have-- 
                         er--brought an omelet! I understand 
                         --yes; you have brought an omelet? 
                         Er--that is very good of you." 
                     
                     
                         He hesitated when about to open the 
                         outer door, raising his hands to his 
                         disheveled hair and unshaven chin. 
                         The flap of the letter box dropped; and 
                         the girl outside could be heard stifling 
                         her laughter. 
                     
                     
                         "You must think me--er--very 
                     
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         rude," began Leroux; "I mean--not to 
                         open the door. But-" 
                     
                     
                         "I quite understand," concluded the 
                         voice of the unseen one. "You are a 
                         most untidy object! And I shall tell 
                         Mira directly she returns that she has 
                         no right to leave you alone like this! 
                         Now I am going to hurry back up- 
                         stairs; so you may appear safely. Don't 
                         let the omelet get cold. Good night!" 
                     
                     
                         "No, certainly I shall not!" cried Le- 
                         roux. "So good of you--I--er--do 
                         like omelet. . . . Good night!" 
                     
                     
                         Calmly he returned to his writing 
                         table, where, in the pursuit of the elu- 
                         sive character whose exploits he was 
                         chronicling and who had brought him 
                         fame and wealth, he forgot in the same 
                         moment Helen Cumberly and the 
                         omelet. 
                     
                     
                         The table clock ticked merrily on; 
                         scratch--scratch--splutter -- scratch--

                         yet old-fashioned enough, and sufficient 
                         of an enthusiast, to pen his work, while 
                         lesser men dictated.

                         career of "Martin Zeda." 
                     
                     
                         It wanted but five minutes to the 
                         hour of midnight, when again the door- 
                         bell clamored in the silence. 
                     
                     
                         Leroux wrote steadily on. The bell 
                         continued to ring, and, furthermore, the 
                         ringer could be heard beating upon the 
                         outer door. 
                     
                     
                         "Soames!" cried Leroux irritably. 
                         "Soames! Why the deuce don't you go 
                         to the door?"

                         Leroux stood up, dashing his pen 
                         upon the table. 
                     
                     
                         "I shall have to sack that man!" he 
                         cried. "He takes too many liberties-- 
                         stopping out until this hour of the 
                         night!" 
                     
                     
                         He pulled open the study door, 
                         crossed the hallway, and opened the 
                         door beyond. 
                     
                     
                         In, out of the darkness--for the stair 
                         lights had been extinguished--stag- 
                         gered a woman; a woman whose pale 
                         face exhibited, despite the ravages of 
                         sorrow or illness, signs of quite unusual 
                         beauty. Her eyes were wide opened, 
                         and terror-stricken, the pupils con- 
                         tracted almost to vanishing point. She 
                         wore a magnificent cloak of civet fur 
                         wrapped tightly about her, and, as Le- 
                         roux opened the door, she tottered past 
                         him into the lobby, glancing back over 
                         her shoulder. 
                     
                     
                         With his upraised hands plunged 
                         pathetically into the mop of his hair, 
                         Leroux turned and stared at the in- 
                         truder. She groped as if a darkness 
                         had descended, clutched at the sides of 
                         the study doorway, and then, unstead- 
                         ily, entered--and sank down upon the 
                         big chesterfield in utter exhaustion. 
                     
                     
                         Leroux, rubbing his chin perplex- 
                         edly, walked in after her. He scarcely 
                         had his foot upon the study carpet, ere 
                         the woman started up tremulously, and 
                         shot out from the enveloping furs a 
                         bare arm and a pointing, quivering 
                         finger. 
                     
                     
                         "Close the door!" she cried hoarsely. 
                         "Close the door! ... He has 
                         . . . followed me!" 
                     
                     
                         The disturbed novelist, as a man in 
                         a dream, turned, retraced his steps, and 
                         closed the outer door of the flat. Then, 
                         rubbing his chin more vigorously than 
                         ever, and only desisting from this ex- 
                         ercise to fumble in his disheveled hair, 
                         he walked back into the study, whose 
                         Athenean calm had thus mysteriously 
                         been violated. 
                     
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         Two minutes, to midnight; the most 
                         respectable flat in respectable West- 
                         minster; a lonely and very abstracted 
                         novelist--and a pale-faced, beautiful 
                         woman, enveloped in costly furs, sitting 
                         staring with fearful eyes straight be- 
                         fore her. This was such a scene as his 
                         sense of the proprieties and of the prob- 
                         abilities could never have permitted 
                         Henry Leroux to create. 
                     
                     
                         His visitor kept moistening her dry 
                         lips and swallowing emotionally. 
                     
                     
                         Standing at a discreet distance from 
                         her: 
                     
                     
                         "Madam," began Leroux nervously. 
                     
                     
                         She waved her hand, enjoining him 
                         to silence, and at the same time inti- 
                         mating that she would explain herself 
                         directly speech became possible. While 
                         she sought to recover her composure, 
                         Leroux, gradually forcing himself out 
                         of the dreamlike state, studied her with 
                         a sort of anxious curiosity. 
                     
                     
                         It now became apparent to him that 
                         his visitor was no more than twenty- 
                         five or twenty-six years of age, but ill- 
                         ness or trouble, or both together, had 
                         seared and marred her beauty. Amid 
                         the auburn masses of her hair gleamed 
                         streaks, not of gray, but of purest 
                         white. The low brow was faintly 
                         wrinkled, and the big--unnaturally big 
                         --eyes were purple shaded; while two 
                         heavy lines traced their way from the 
                         corner of the nostrils to the corner of 
                         the mouth--of the drooping mouth 
                         with the bloodless lips. 
                     
                     
                         Her pallor became more strange and 
                         interesting the longer he studied it; for, 
                         underlying the skin was a yellow tinge 
                         which he found inexplicable, but which 
                         he linked in his mind with the con- 
                         tracted pupils of her eyes, seeking 
                         vainly for a common cause. 
                     
                     
                         He had a hazy impression that his 
                         visitor, beneath her furs, was most in- 
                         adequately clothed; and, seeking con- 
                         firmation of this, his gaze strayed 
                         downward to where one little, slippered 
                         foot peeped out from the civet furs. 
                     
                 
             
             
                 
                 4 Detective Story Magazine 
                 
                     
                     
                         Leroux suppressed a gasp. He had 
                         caught a glimpse of a bare ankle! 
                     
                     
                         He crossed to his writing table, and 
                         seated himself, glancing sideways at 
                         this living mystery. Suddenly she be- 
                         gan, in a voice tremulous and scarcely 
                         audible: 
                     
                     
                         "Mr. Leroux, at a great--at a very 
                         great personal risk, I have come to- 
                         night. What I have to ask of you--to 
                         entreat of you--will . . . will . . ." 
                     
                     
                         Two bare arms emerged from the 
                         fur, and she began clutching at her 
                         throat and bosom as though choking-- 
                         dying. 
                     
                     
                         Leroux leaped up and would have 
                         run to her; but, forcing a ghastly smile, 
                         she waved him away again. 
                     
                     
                         "It is all right," she muttered, swal- 
                         lowing noisily. 
                     
                     
                         But frightful spasms of pain con- 
                         vulsed her, contorting her pale face. 
                     
                     
                         "Some brandy-" cried Leroux 
                         anxiously. 
                     
                     
                         "If you please," whispered the vis- 
                         itor. 
                     
                     
                         She dropped her arms and fell back 
                         upon the chesterfield, insensible. 
                     
                     
                         CHAPTER II. 
                     
                     
                         MIDNIGHT AND MR. KING. 
                     
                     
                         LEROUX clutched at the corner of 
                         the writing table to steady him- 
                         self and stood there looking at the 
                         deathly face. Under the most favor- 
                         able circumstances, he was no man of 
                         action, although in common with the 
                         rest of his kind he prided himself upon 
                         the possession of that presence of mind 
                         which he lacked. It was a situation 
                         which could not have alarmed "Martin 
                         Zeda," but it alarmed immeasurably, 
                         nay, struck inert with horror, Martin 
                         Zeda's creator. 
                     
                     
                         Then, in upon Leroux's mental tur- 
                         moil, a sensible idea intruded itself. 
                     
                     
                         "Doctor Cumberly!" he muttered. "I 
                         hope to Heaven he is in!" 
                     
                     
                         Without touching the recumbent 
                     
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         form upon the chesterfield, without 
                         seeking to learn, without daring to 
                         learn, if she lived or had died, Leroux, 
                         the tempo of his life changed to a 
                         breathless gallop, rushed out of the 
                         study, across the entrance hall, and, 
                         throwing wide the flat door, leaped up 
                         the stair to the flat above--that of his 
                         old friend, Doctor Cumberly. 
                     
                     
                         The patter of the slippered feet grew 
                         faint upon the stair; then, as Leroux 
                         reached the landing above, became in- 
                         audible altogether. 
                     
                     
                         In Leroux's study, the table clock 
                         ticked merrily on, seeming to hasten its 
                         ticking as the hand crept around closer 
                         and closer to midnight. The mosaic 
                         shade of the lamp mingled reds and 
                         blues and greens upon the white ceiling 
                         above and poured golden light upon the 
                         pages of manuscript strewn about be- 
                         neath it. This was a typical work- 
                         room of a literary man having the ear 
                         of the public--typical in every respect, 
                         save for the fur-clad figure outstretched 
                         upon the settee. 
                     
                     
                         And now the peeping light indis- 
                         creetly penetrated to the hem of a silken 
                         garment revealed by some disarrange- 
                         ment of the civet fur. To the eye of an 
                         experienced observer, had such an ob- 
                         server been present in Henry Leroux's 
                         study, this billow of silk and lace be- 
                         hind the sheltering fur must have pro- 
                         claimed itself the edge of a night robe, 
                         just as the ankle beneath had pro- 
                         claimed itself to Henry Leroux's 
                         shocked susceptibilities to be innocent 
                         of stocking. 
                     
                     
                         Thirty seconds were wanted to com- 
                         plete the cycle of the day, when one of 
                         the listless hands thrown across the 
                         back of the chesterfield opened and 
                         closed spasmodically. The fur at the 
                         bosom of the midnight visitor began 
                         rapidly to rise and fall. 
                     
                     
                         Then, with a choking cry, the woman 
                         struggled upright; her hair, hastily 
                         dressed, burst free of its bindings and 
                     
                 
             
             
                 
                 The Yellow Claw 5 
                 
                     
                     
                         poured in gleaming cascade down about 
                         her shoulders. 
                     
                     
                         Clutching with one hand at her cloak 
                         in order to keep it wrapped about her, 
                         and holding the other blindly before 
                         her, she rose, and, with that same odd, 
                         groping movement, began to approach 
                         the writing table. The pupils of her 
                         eyes were mere pin points now; she 
                         shuddered convulsively, and her skin 
                         was dewed with perspiration. Her 
                         breath came in agonized gasps. 
                     
                     
                         "Heavens!--I . . . am dying 
                         . . . and I cannot--tell him!" she 
                         breathed. 
                     
                     
                         Feverishly, weakly, she took up a 
                         pen, and upon a quarto page, already 
                         half filled with Leroux's small, neat, il- 
                         legible writing, began to scrawl a mes- 
                         sage, bending down, one hand upon the 
                         table, and with her whole body shaking. 
                     
                     
                         Some three or four wavering lines 
                         she had written, when intimately--for 
                         the flat of Henry Leroux, in Palace 
                         Mansions, lay within sight of the clock 
                         face--Big Ben began to chime mid- 
                         night. 
                     
                     
                         The writer started back and dropped 
                         a great blot of ink upon the paper; 
                         then, realizing the cause of the disturb- 
                         ance, forced herself to continue her 
                         task. 
                     
                     
                         The chime being completed: One! 
                         boomed the clock; two! . . . 
                         three! . . . four! . . . 
                     
                     
                         The light in the entrance hall went 
                         out! 
                     
                     
                         Five! boomed Big Ben; six! . . . 
                         seven! . . . 
                     
                     
                         A hand, of old ivory hue, a long, 
                         yellow, clawish hand, with part of a 
                         sinewy forearm, crept in from the black 
                         lobby through the study doorway and 
                         touched the electric switch! 
                     
                     
                         Eight! . . . 
                     
                     
                         The study was plunged in darkness! 
                     
                     
                         Uttering a sob--a cry of agony and 
                         horror that came from her very soul-- 
                         the woman stood upright and turned to 
                     
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         face toward the door, clutching the 
                         sheet of paper in one rigid hand. 
                     
                     
                         Through the leaded panes of the win- 
                         dow above the writing table swept a 
                         silvern beam of moonlight. It poured 
                         searchingly upon the fur-clad figure 
                         swaying by the table; cutting through 
                         the darkness of the room like some 
                         huge scimitar, to end in a pallid pool 
                         about the woman's shadow on the cen- 
                         ter of the Persian carpet. 
                     
                     
                         Coincident with her sobbing cry-- 
                         Nine! boomed Big Ben; ten! . . . 
                     
                     
                         Two hands--with outstretched, 
                         crooked, clutching fingers--leaped from 
                         the darkness into the light of the moon- 
                         beam. 
                     
                     
                         "Heavens! Oh, heavens!" came a 
                         frenzied, rasping shriek--"Mr. King!" 
                     
                     
                         Straight at the bare throat leaped the 
                         yellow hands; a gurgling cry rose--fell 
                         --and died away. 
                     
                     
                         Gently, noiselessly, the lady of the 
                         civet fur sank upon the carpet by the 
                         table; as she fell, a dim, black figure 
                         bent over her. The tearing of paper 
                         told of the note being snatched from 
                         her frozen grip; but never for a mo- 
                         ment did the face or the form of her 
                         assailant encroach upon the moonbeam. 
                     
                     
                         Batlike, this second and terrible vis- 
                         itant avoided the light. 
                     
                     
                         The deed had occupied so brief a 
                         time that but one note of the great bell 
                         had accompanied it. 
                     
                     
                         Twelve! rang out the final stroke 
                         from the clock tower. A low, eerie 
                         whistle, minor, rising in three irregular 
                         notes, and falling in weird, unusual 
                         cadence to silence again, came from 
                         somewhere outside the room. 
                     
                     
                         Then darkness--stillness--with the 
                         moon a witness of one more ghastly 
                         crime. 
                     
                     
                         Presently, confused and intermingled 
                         voices from above proclaimed the re- 
                         turn of Leroux with the doctor. They 
                         were talking in an excited key, the 
                         voice of Leroux, especially, sounding 
                         almost hysterical. They created such

                         a disturbance that they attracted the at- 
                         tention of Mr. John Exel, M. P., oc- 
                         cupant of the flat below, who at that 
                         very moment had returned from the 
                         House, and was about to insert the key 
                         in the lock of his door. He looked up 
                         the stairway, but, all being in darkness, 
                         was unable to detect anything. There- 
                         fore he called out: 
                     
                     
                         "Is that you, Leroux? Is anything 
                         the matter?" 
                     
                     
                         "Matter, Exel!" cried Leroux. 
                         "There's the deuce of a business! For 
                         mercy's sake, come up!" 
                     
                     
                         His curiosity greatly excited, Mr. 
                         Exel mounted the stairs, entering the 
                         lobby of Leroux's flat immediately be- 
                         hind the owner and Doctor Cumberly-- 
                         who, like Leroux, was arrayed in a 
                         dressing gown; for he had been in bed 
                         when summoned by his friend. 
                     
                     
                         "You are all in the dark here," mut- 
                         tered Doctor Cumberly, fumbling for 
                         the switch. 
                     
                     
                         "Some one has turned the light out!" 
                         whispered Leroux nervously. "I left 
                         it on." 
                     
                     
                         Doctor Cumberly pressed the switch, 
                         turning up the lobby light as Exel en- 
                         tered from the landing. Then Leroux, 
                         entering the study first of the three, 
                         switched on the light there also. 
                     
                     
                         One glance he threw about the room, 
                         then started back like a man physically 
                         strickep. 
                     
                     
                         "Cumberly!" he gasped. "Cum- 
                         berly!" And he pointed to the furry 
                         heap by the writing table. 
                     
                     
                         "You said she lay on the chester- 
                         field," muttered Cumberly. 
                     
                     
                         "I left her there. . ." 
                     
                     
                         Doctor Cumberly crossed the room 
                         and dropped upon his knees. He 
                         turned the white face toward the light, 
                         gently parted the civet fur, and pressed 
                         his ear to the silken covering of the 
                         breast. He started slightly and looked 
                         into the glazing eyes. 
                     
                     
                         Replacing the fur which he had dis- 
                         arranged, the physician stood up and 
                     
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         fixed a keen gaze upon the face of 
                         Henry Leroux. The latter swallowed 
                         noisily, moistening his parched lips. 
                     
                     
                         "Is she . ." he muttered; "is 
                         she-" 
                     
                     
                         "Heaven's mercy, Leroux!" whis- 
                         pered Mr. Exel. "What does this 
                         mean?" 
                     
                     
                         "The woman is dead," said Doctor 
                         Cumberly. 
                     
                     
                         In common with all medical men, 
                         Doctor Cumberly was a physiognomist; 
                         he was a great physician and a propor- 
                         tionately great physiognomist. There- 
                         fore, when he looked into Henry 
                         Leroux's eyes, he saw there, and recog- 
                         nized, horror and consternation. With 
                         no further evidence than that furnished 
                         by his own powers of perception, he 
                         knew that the mystery of this woman's 
                         death was as inexplicable to Henry Le- 
                         roux as it was inexplicable to himself. 
                     
                     
                         He was a masterful man, with the 
                         gray eyes of a diplomat, and he knew 
                         Leroux as did few men. He laid both 
                         hands upon the novelist's shoulders. 
                     
                     
                         "Brace up, old chap!" he said. "You 
                         will want all your wits about you." 
                     
                     
                         "I left her," began Leroux hesitat- 
                         ingly--"I left-" 
                     
                     
                         "We know all about where you left 
                         her, Leroux," interrupted Cumberly; 
                         "but what we want to get at is this: 
                         what occurred between the time you 
                         left her, and the time of our return?" 
                     
                     
                         Exel, who had walked across to the 
                         table, and, with a horror-stricken 
                         face, was gingerly examining the vic- 
                         tim, now exclaimed: 
                     
                     
                         "Why! Leroux! She is--she is 
                         . . . undressed!" 
                     
                     
                         Leroux clutched at his disheveled 
                         hair with both hands. 
                     
                     
                         "My dear Exel!" he cried. "My 
                         dear, good man! Why do you use that 
                         tone? You say 'She is undressed!' as 
                         though I were responsible for the poor 
                         soul's condition!" 
                     
                     
                         "On the contrary, Leroux!" retorted 
                         Exel, standing very upright, and star- 
                     
                 
             
             
                 
                 The Yellow Claw 7 
                 
                     
                     
                         ing through his monocle, "on the con- 
                         trary, you misconstrue me! I did not 
                         intend to imply--to insinuate-" 
                     
                     
                         "My dear Exel!" broke in Doctor 
                         Cumberly. "Leroux is perfectly well 
                         aware that you intended nothing un- 
                         kindly. But the poor chap, quite natu- 
                         rally, is distraught at the moment. You 
                         must understand that, man!" 
                     
                     
                         "I understand; and I am sorry," said 
                         Exel, casting a sidelong glance at the 
                         body. "Of course, it is a delicate sub- 
                         ject. No doubt Leroux can ex- 
                         plain." 
                     
                     
                         "Damn your explanation!" shrieked 
                         Leroux hysterically. "I cannot ex- 
                         plain! If I could explain, I-" 
                     
                     
                         "Leroux!" said Cumberly, placing his 
                         arm paternally about the shaking man. 
                         "You are such a nervous subject. Do 
                         make an effort, old fellow. Pull your- 
                         self together. Exel does not know the 
                         circumstances-" 
                     
                     
                         "I am curious to learn them," said 
                         the M. P. icily. 
                     
                     
                         Leroux was about to launch some 
                         angry retort, but Cumberly forced him 
                         into the chesterfield, and, crossing to a 
                         bureau, poured out a stiff peg of brandy 
                         from a decanter which stood there. Le- 
                         roux sank upon the chesterfield, rub- 
                         bing his fingers up and down his palms 
                         with a curious nervous movement, and 
                         glancing at the dead woman and at 
                         Exel alternately in a mechanical, reg- 
                         ular fashion, pathetic to behold. 
                     
                     
                         Mr. Exel, tapping his boot with the 
                         head of his inverted Cane, was staring 
                         fixedly at the doctor. 
                     
                     
                         "Here you are, Leroux," said Cum- 
                         berly ; "drink this up, and let us arrange 
                         our facts in decent order before we 
                         start to-" 
                     
                     
                         "Phone for the police?" concluded 
                         Exel, his gaze upon the last speaker. 
                     
                     
                         Leroux drank the brandy at a gulp 
                         and put down the glass upon a little 
                         Persian coffee table with a hand which 
                         he had somehow contrived to steady. 
                     
                     
                         "You are keen on the official form, 
                     
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         Exel?" he said, with a wry smile. 
                         "Please accept my apology for my re- 
                         cent--er--outburst, but picture this 
                         thing happening in your place!" 
                     
                     
                         "I cannot," declared Exel bluntly. 
                     
                     
                         "You lack imagination," said Cum- 
                         berly. "Take a whisky and soda, and 
                         help me to search the flat." 
                     
                     
                         "Search the flat!" 
                     
                     
                         The physician raised a forefinger 
                         forensically. 
                     
                     
                         "Since you, Exel, if not actually in 
                         the building, must certainly have been 
                         within sight of the street entrance at 
                         the moment of the crime, and since Le-

                         you on the landing, it is reasonable to 
                         suppose that the assassin can only be in 
                         one place--here!" 
                     
                     
                         "Here!" cried Exel and Leroux to- 
                         gether. 
                     
                     
                         "Did you see any one leave the lower 
                         hall as you entered?" 
                     
                     
                         "No one; emphatically, there was no 
                         one there!" 
                     
                     
                         "Then I am right." 
                     
                     
                         "Good heavens!" whispered Exel, 
                         glancing about him, with a new and 
                         keen apprehensiveness. 
                     
                     
                         "Take your drink," concluded Cum- 
                         berly, "and join me in my search." 
                     
                     
                         "Thanks," replied Exel, nervously 
                         proffering a cigar case; "but I won't 
                         drink." 
                     
                     
                         "As you wish," said the doctor, who 
                         thus, in his masterful way, acted the 
                         host; "and I won't smoke. But do you 
                         light up." 
                     
                     
                         "Later," muttered Exel; "later. Let 
                         us search, first." 
                     
                     
                         Leroux stood up; Cumberly forced 
                         him back. 
                     
                     
                         "Stay where you are, Leroux; it is 
                         elementary strategy to operate from a 
                         fixed base. This study shall be the 
                         base. Ready, Exel ?" 
                     
                     
                         Exel nodded, and the search com- 
                         menced. Leroux sat rigidly upon the 
                         settee, his hands resting upon his knees, 
                         watching and listening. Save for the

                         squarely in the middle of the room, 
                         fixed his eyes upon the still form lying 
                         in the shadow of the writing table. 
                     
                     
                         "You will have been called in, doc- 
                         tor," he said, faking the proffered tum- 
                         bler, "at the time of the crime?" 
                     
                     
                         "Exactly!" replied Cumberly. "Mr. 
                         Leroux ran up to my flat and sum- 
                         moned me to see the woman." 
                     
                     
                         "What time would that be?" 
                     
                     
                         "Big Ben had just struck the final 
                         stroke of twelve when I came out onto

                         "Mr. Leroux would be waiting there 
                         for you?"

                         I slipped on my dressing gown, and we 
                         came down together." 
                     
                     
                         "I was entering from the street," in- 
                         terrupted Exel, "as they were descend-

                         "You can enter from the street, sir, 
                         in a moment," said Dunbar, holding up 
                         his hand. "One witness at a time, if 
                         you please." 
                     
                     
                         Exel shrugged his shoulders and 
                         turned slightly, leaning his elbow upon 
                         the mantelpiece and flicking off the ash 
                         from his cigar. 
                     
                     
                         "I take it you were in bed?" ques- 
                         tioned Dunbar, turning again to the 
                         doctor. 
                     
                     
                         "I had been in bed about a quarter 
                         of an hour when I was aroused by the 
                         ringing of the doorbell. This ringing 
                         struck me as so urgent that I ran out 
                         in my pajamas, and found there Mr. 
                         Leroux, in a very disturbed state-" 
                     
                     
                         "What did he say? Give his own 
                         words as nearly as you remember 
                         them." 
                     
                     
                         Leroux, who had been standing, sank 
                         slowly back into the armchair, with his 
                         eyes upon Doctor Cumberly as the lat- 
                         ter replied: 
                     
                     
                         "He said: 'Cumberly! Cumberly! 
                         For Heaven's sake, come down at once; 
                         there is a strange woman in my flat, ap- 
                         parently in a dying condition!'" 
                     
                     
                         "What did you do?" 
                     
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         "I ran into my bedroom and slipped 
                         on my dressing gown, leaving Mr. Le- 
                         roux in the entrance hall. Then, with 
                         the clock chiming the last stroke of 
                         midnight, we came out together and I 
                         closed my door behind me. There was 
                         no light on the stair; but our conversa- 
                         tion--Mr. Leroux was speaking in a 
                         very high-pitched voice-" 
                     
                     
                         "What was he saying?" 
                     
                     
                         "He was explaining to me how some 
                         woman, unknown to him, had inter- 
                         rupted his work a few minutes before 
                         by ringing his doorbell." 
                     
                     
                         Inspector Dunbar held up his hand. 
                     
                     
                         "I won't ask you to repeat what he 
                         said, doctor; Mr. Leroux presently can 
                         give me his own words." 
                     
                     
                         "We had descended to this floor, 
                         then," resumed Cumberly, "when Mr. 
                         Exel, entering below, called up to us, 
                         asking if anything was the matter. Le- 
                         roux replied: 'Matter, Exel! There's 
                         the deuce of a business! For mercy's 
                         sake, come up!'" 
                     
                     
                         "Well?" 
                     
                     
                         "Mr. Exel thereupon joined us at 
                         the door of this flat." 
                     
                     
                         "Was it open?" 
                     
                     
                         "Yes. Mr. Leroux had rushed up to 
                         me, leaving the door open behind him. 
                         The light was out, both in the lobby and 
                         in the study, a fact iipon which I com- 
                         mented at the time. It was all the more 
                         curious as Mr. Leroux had left both 
                         lights on!" 
                     
                     
                         "Did he say so?" 
                     
                     
                         "He did. The circumstances sur- 
                         prised him to a marked degree. We 
                         came in and I turned up the light in the 
                         lobby. Then Leroux, entering the 
                         study, turned up the light there, too. I 
                         entered next, followed by Mr. Exel-- 
                         and we saw the body lying where you 
                         see it now." 
                     
                     
                         "Who saw it first?" 
                     
                     
                         "Mr. Leroux; he drew my attention 
                         to it, saying that he had left her lying 
                         on the chesterfield and not upon the 
                         floor."

                         "You examined her?" 
                     
                     
                         "I did. She was dead, but still warm. 
                         She exhibited signs of recent illness, 
                         and of being addicted to some drug 
                         habit; probably morphine. This, be- 
                         yond doubt, contributed to her death, 
                         but the direct cause was asphyxiation. 
                         She had been strangled!" 
                     
                     
                         "Heavens!" groaned Leroux, drop- 
                         ping his face into his hands. 
                     
                     
                         "You found marks on her throat?" 
                     
                     
                         "The marks were very slight. No 
                         great pressure was required in her 
                         weak condition." 
                     
                     
                         "You did not move the body?" 
                     
                     
                         "Certainly not; a more complete ex- 
                         amination must be made, of course. 
                         But I extracted a piece of torn paper 
                         from her clenched right hand." 
                     
                     
                         Inspector Dunbar lowered his tufted 
                         brows. 
                     
                     
                         "I'm not glad to know you did that," 
                         he said. "It should have been left." 
                     
                     
                         "It was done on the spur of the mo- 
                         ment, but without altering the position 
                         of the hand or arm. The paper lies 
                         upon the table, yonder." 
                     
                     
                         Inspector Dunbar took a long drink. 
                         Thus far he had made no attempt to 
                         examine the victim. Pulling out a 
                         bulging note case from the inside 
                         pocket of his blue serge coat, he un- 
                         screwed a fountain pen, carefully tested 
                         the nib upon his thumb nail, and made 
                         three or four brief entries. Then, 
                         stretching out one long arm, he laid the 
                         wallet and the pen beside his glass upon 
                         the top of a bookcase, without other- 
                         wise changing his position, and, glanc- 
                         ing aside at Exel, said: 
                     
                     
                         "Now, Mr. Exel, what help can you 
                         give us?" 
                     
                     
                         "I have little to add to Doctor Cum- 
                         berly's account," answered Exel off- 
                         handedly. "The whole thing seemed to 
                         me--" 
                     
                     
                         "What it seemed," interrupted Dun- 
                         bar, "does not interest Scotland Yard, 
                         Mr. Exel, and won't interest the jury." 
                     
                     
                         Leroux glanced up for a moment, 
                     
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         then set his teeth hard, so that his jaw 
                         muscles stood out prominently under 
                         the pallid skin. 
                     
                     
                         "What do you want to know, then?" 
                         asked Exel. 
                     
                     
                         "I will be wanting to know," said 
                         Dunbar, "where you were coming from, 
                         to-night?" 
                     
                     
                         "From the House of Commons." 
                     
                     
                         "You came direct?" 
                     
                     
                         "I left Sir Brian Malpas at the cor- 
                         ner of Victoria Street at four minutes 
                         to twelve by Big Ben, and walked 
                         straight home, actually entering here, 
                         from the street, as the clock was chim- 
                         ing the last stroke of midnight." 
                     
                     
                         "Then you would have walked up the 
                         street from an easterly direction?" 
                     
                     
                         "Certainly." 
                     
                     
                         "Did you meet any one or anything?" 
                     
                     
                         "A taxicab, empty--for the hood was 
                         lowered--passed me as I turned the 
                         corner. There was no other vehicle in 
                         the street, and no person." 
                     
                     
                         "You don't know from which door 
                         the cab came?" 
                     
                     
                         "As I turned the corner," replied 
                         Exel, "I heard the man starting his en- 
                         gine, although when I actually saw the 
                         cab, it was in motion; but, judging by 
                         the sound to which I refer, the cab 
                         had been stationary, if not at the door 
                         of Palace Mansions, certainly at that of 
                         the next block--St. Andrew's Man- 
                         sions." 
                     
                     
                         "Did you hear, or see anything else?" 
                     
                     
                         "I saw nothing whatever. But just 
                         as I approached the street door, I heard 
                         a peculiar whistle, apparently proceed- 
                         ing from the gardens in the center of 
                         the square. I attached no importance 
                         to it at the time." 
                     
                     
                         "What kind of whistle?" 
                     
                     
                         "I have forgotten the actual notes, 
                         but the effect was very odd in some 
                         way." 
                     
                     
                         "In what way?" 
                     
                     
                         "An impression of this sort is not en- 
                         tirely reliable, inspector; but it struck 
                         me as Oriental."

                         "Ah!" said Dunbar, and reached out 
                         the long arm for his notebook. 
                     
                     
                         "Can I be of any further assistance?" 
                         said Exel, glancing at his watch. 
                     
                     
                         "You had entered the hallway and 
                         were about to enter your own flat when 
                         the voices of Doctor Cumberly and Mr. 
                         Leroux attracted your attention?" 
                     
                     
                         "I actually had the key in my hand," 
                         replied Exel. 
                     
                     
                         "Did you actually have the key in the 
                         lock?" 
                     
                     
                         "Let me think," mused Exel, and he 
                         took out a bunch of keys and dangled 
                         them reflectively before his eyes. "No! 
                         I was fumbling for the right key when 
                         I heard the voices above me." 
                     
                     
                         "But were you facing your door?" 
                     
                     
                         "No," averred Exel, perceiving the 
                         drift of the inspector's inquiries; "I was 
                         facing the stairway the whole time, and 
                         although it was in darkness, there is a 
                         street lamp immediately outside on the 
                         pavement, and I can swear, positively, 
                         that no one descended; that there was 
                         no one in the hall, nor on the stair, ex- 
                         cept Mr. Leroux and Doctor Cum- 
                         berly." 
                     
                     
                         "Ah!" said Dunbar again, and made 
                         further entries in his book. "I need not 
                         trouble you further, sir. Good night!" 
                     
                     
                         Exel, despite his earlier attitude of 
                         boredom, now ignored this official dis- 
                         missal, and, tossing the stump of his 
                         cigar into the grate, lighted a cigarette, 
                         and, with both hands thrust deep in his 
                         pockets, stood leaning back against the 
                         mantelpiece. The detective turned to 
                         Leroux. 
                     
                     
                         "Have a brandy and soda?" sug- 
                         gested Doctor Cumberly, his eyes 
                         turned upon the pathetic face of the 
                         novelist. 
                     
                     
                         But Leroux shook his head wearily. 
                     
                     
                         "Go ahead, inspector!" he said. "I 
                         am anxious to tell you all I know. 
                         Heaven knows I am anxious to tell 
                         you." 
                     
                     
                         A sound was heard of a key being in- 
                         serted in the lock of a door. 
                     
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         Four pairs of curious eyes were 
                         turned toward the entrance lobby, when 
                         the door opened, and a sleek man of 
                         medium height, clean shaven, but with 
                         his hair cut low upon the cheek bones, 
                         so as to give the impression of short 
                         side whiskers, entered in a manner at 
                         once furtive and servile. 
                     
                     
                         He wore a black overcoat and a 
                         bowler hat. Reclosing the door, he 
                         turned, perceived the group in the 
                         study, and fell back as though some 
                         one had struck him a fierce blow. 
                     
                     
                         Abject terror was written upon his 
                         features, and, for a moment, the idea of 
                         flight appeared to suggest itself urgently 
                         to him; but finally he took a step for- 
                         ward toward the study. 
                     
                     
                         "Who's this?"snapped Dunbar, with- 
                         out removing his leonine eyes from the 
                         newcomer. 
                     
                     
                         "It is Soames," came the weary voice 
                         of Leroux. 
                     
                     
                         "Butler?" 
                     
                     
                         "Yes." 
                     
                     
                         "Where's he been ?" 
                     
                     
                         "I don't know. He remained out 
                         without my permission." 
                     
                     
                         "He did, eh?" 
                     
                     
                         Inspector Dunbar thrust forth a long 
                         finger at the shrinking form in the door- 
                         way. 
                     
                     
                         "Mr. Soames," he said, "you will be 
                         going to your own room and waiting 
                         there until I ring for you." 
                     
                     
                         "Yes, sir," said Soames, holding his 
                         hat in both hands, and speaking huskily. 
                         "Yes, sir; certainly, sir." 
                     
                     
                         He crossed the lobby and disap- 
                         peared. 
                     
                     
                         "There is no other way out, is there?" 
                         inquired the detective, glancing at Doc- 
                         tor Cumberly. 
                     
                     
                         "There is no other way," was the re- 
                         ply; "but surely you don't suspect-" 
                     
                     
                         "I would suspect the Archbishop of 
                         Westminster," snapped Dunbar, "if he 
                         came in like that! Now, sir"--he 
                         turned to Leroux--"you were alone 
                         here to-night?" 
                     
                 
             
             
                 
                 The Yellow Claw 13 
                 
                     
                     
                         "Quite alone, inspector. The truth 
                         is, I fear that my servants take liberties 
                         in the absence of my wife." 
                     
                     
                         "In the absence of your wife? Where 
                         is your wife?" 
                     
                     
                         "She is in Paris." 
                     
                     
                         "Is she a Frenchwoman?" 
                     
                     
                         "No! Oh, no! But my wife is a 
                         painter, you understand, and--er--I 
                         met her in Paris--er- Must you 
                         insist upon these--domestic particulars, 
                         inspector ?" 
                     
                     
                         "If Mr. Exel is anxious to turn in," 
                         replied the inspector, "after his no 
                         doubt exhausting duties at the House, 
                         and if Doctor Cumberly-" 
                     
                     
                         "I have no secrets from Cumberly!" 
                         interjected Leroux. "The doctor has 
                         known me almost from boyhood, but-- 
                         er"--turning to the politician--"don't 
                         you know , Exel--no offense, no of- 
                         fense-" 
                     
                     
                         "My dear Leroux," responded Exel 
                         hastily, "I am the offender! Permit 
                         me to wish you all good night." 
                     
                     
                         He crossed the study, and, at the 
                         door, paused and turned. 
                     
                     
                         "Rely upon me, Leroux," he said, "to 
                         help in any way within my power." 
                     
                     
                         He crossed the lobby, opened the 
                         outer door, and departed. 
                     
                     
                         "Now, Mr. Leroux," resumed Dun- 
                         bar, "about this matter of your wife's 
                         absence." 
                     
                     
                         CHAPTER IV. 
                     
                     
                         A WINDOW OPENED. 
                     
                     
                         WHILE Henry Leroux collected his 
                         thoughts, Doctor Cumberly 
                         glanced across at the writing table 
                         where lay the fragment of paper which 
                         had been clutched in the dead woman's 
                         hand, then turned his head again to- 
                         ward the inspector, staring at him curi- 
                         ously. Since Dunbar had not yet at- 
                         tempted even a glance at the strange 
                         message, he wondered what had 
                         prompted the present line of inquiry. 
                     
                     
                         "My wife," began Leroux, "shared a 
                         studio in Paris, at the time that I met 
                     
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         her, with an American lady--a very tal- 
                         ented portrait painter--er--a Miss 
                         Denise Ryland. You may know her 
                         name? But, of course, you don't, no! 
                         Well, my wife is, herself, quite clever 
                         with her brush; in fact, she has ex- 
                         hibited more than once at the Paris 
                         Salon. We agreed at--er--the time of 
                         our--of our--engagement, that she 
                         should be free to visit her old artistic 
                         friends in Paris at any time. You un- 
                         derstand? There was to be no let or 
                         hindrance. ... Is this really 
                         necessary, inspector?" 
                     
                     
                         "Pray go on, Mr. Leroux." 
                     
                     
                         "Well, you understand, it was a give- 
                         and-take arrangement; because I am 
                         afraid that I, myself, demand certain-- 
                         sacrifices from my wife--and--er--I 
                         did not feel entitled to--inter- 
                         fere-" 
                     
                     
                         "You see, inspector," interrupted 
                         Doctor Cumberly, "they are a bo- 
                         hemian pair, and bohemians, inevitably, 
                         bore one another at times! This little 
                         arrangement was intended as a safety 
                         valve. Whenever ennui attacked Mrs. 
                         Leroux, she was at liberty to depart for 
                         a week to her own friends in Paris, 
                         leaving Leroux to the bachelor's ex- 
                         istence which is really his proper state; 
                         to go unshaven and unshorn, to dine 
                         upon bread and cheese and onions, to 
                         work until all hours of the morning, 
                         and generally to enjoy himself!" 
                     
                     
                         "Does she usually stay long?" in- 
                         quired Dunbar. 
                     
                     
                         "Not more than a week, as a rule," 
                         answered Leroux. 
                     
                     
                         "You must excuse me," continued 
                         the detective, "if I seem to pry into in- 
                         timate matters; but on these occasions, 
                         how does Mrs. Leroux get on for 
                         money?" 
                     
                     
                         "I have opened a credit for her," ex- 
                         plained the novelist wearily, "at the 
                         Credit Lyonnais, in Paris." 
                     
                     
                         Dunbar scribbled busily in his note- 
                         book.

                         "Does she take her maid with her?" 
                         he jerked suddenly. 
                     
                     
                         "She has no maid at the moment," 
                         replied Leroux; "she has been with- 
                         out one for twelve months or more 
                         now." 
                     
                     
                         "When did you last hear from her?" 
                     
                     
                         "Three days ago." 
                     
                     
                         "Did you answer the letter?" 
                     
                     
                         "Yes; my answer was among the 
                         mail which Soames took to the post to- 
                         night." 
                     
                     
                         "You said, though, if I remember 
                         rightly, that he was out without per- 
                         mission ?" 
                     
                     
                         Leroux ran his fingers through his 
                         hair. 
                     
                     
                         "I meant that he should only have 
                         been absent five minutes or so; while 
                         he remained out for more than an 
                         hour." 
                     
                     
                         Inspector Dunbar nodded compre- 
                         hendingly, tapping his teeth with the 
                         head of the fountain pen. 
                     
                     
                         "And the other servants?" 
                     
                     
                         "There are only two: a cook and a 
                         maid. I released them for the evening

                         "They are late?" 
                     
                     
                         "They take liberties because I am 
                         easy-going." 
                     
                     
                         "I see," said Dunbar. "So that you 
                         were quite alone this evening, when"-- 
                         he nodded in the direction of the writ- 
                         ing table--"your visitor came?" 
                     
                     
                         "Quite alone." 
                     
                     
                         "Was her arrival the first interrup-

                         "My daughter," explained Doctor 
                         Cumberly, "knowing that Mr. Leroux, 
                         at these times, was very neglectful in 
                         regard to meals, prepared him an ome- 
                         let, and brought it down in a chafing 
                         dish." 
                     
                     
                         "How long did she remain?" asked 
                         the inspector of Leroux. 
                     
                     
                         "I--er--did not exactly open the 
                     
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         door. We chatted, through--er-- 
                         through the letter box, and she left the 
                         omelet outside on the landing." 
                     
                     
                         "What time would that be?" 
                     
                     
                         "It was a quarter to twelve," declared 
                         Cumberly. "I had been supping with 
                         some friends, and returned to find 
                         Helen, my daughter, engaged in prepar- 
                         ing the omelet. I congratulated her 
                         upon the happy thought, knowing that 
                         Leroux was probably starving himself." 
                     
                     
                         "I see. The omelet, though, seems 
                         to be upset here on the floor?" said the 
                         inspector. 
                     
                     
                         Cumberly briefly explained how it 
                         came to be there, Leroux punctuating 
                         his friend's story with affirmative 
                         nods. 
                     
                     
                         "Then the door of the flat was open 
                         all the time?" cried Dunbar. 
                     
                     
                         "Yes," replied Cumberly; "but while 
                         Exel and I searched the other rooms-- 
                         and our search was exhaustive--Mr. 
                         Leroux remained here in the study, and 
                         in full view of the lobby--as you see 
                         for yourself." 
                     
                     
                         "No living thing," said Leroux 
                         monotonously, "left this flat from the 
                         time that the three of us, Exel, Cum- 
                         berly, and I, entered, up to the time that 
                         Miss Cumberly came, and, with the 
                         doctor, went out again. 
                     
                     
                         "H'm!" said the inspector, making 
                         notes. "It appears so, certainly. I 
                         will ask you, then, for your own ac- 
                         count, Mr. Leroux, of the arrival of the 
                         woman in the civet furs. Pay special 
                         attention"--he pointed with his foun- 
                         tain pen--"to the time at which the 
                         various incidents occurred." 
                     
                     
                         Leroux, growing calmer as he pro- 
                         ceeded with the strange story, complied 
                         with the inspector's request. He had 
                         practically completed his account when 
                         the doorbell rang. 
                     
                     
                         "It's the servants," said Doctor Cum- 
                         berly. "Soames will open the door." 
                     
                     
                         But Soames did not appear. 
                     
                     
                         The ringing being repeated: 
                     
                     
                         "I told him to remain in his room," 
                     
                 
             
             
                 
                 The Yellow Claw 15 
                 
                     
                     
                         said Dunbar, "until I rang for him, I 
                         remember-" 
                     
                     
                         "I will open the door," said Cum- 
                         berly. 
                     
                     
                         "And tell the servants to stay in the 
                         kitchen," snapped Dunbar. 
                     
                     
                         Doctor Cumberly opened the door, 
                         admitting the cook and housemaid. 
                     
                     
                         "There has been an unfortunate ac- 
                         cident," he said, "but not to your mas- 
                         ter; you need not be afraid. But be 
                         good enough to remain in the kitchen 
                         for the present." 
                     
                     
                         Peeping in furtively as they passed, 
                         the two women crossed the lobby and 
                         went to their own quarters. 
                     
                     
                         "Mr. Soames next," muttered Dun- 
                         bar; and glancing at Cumberly as he 
                         returned from the lobby, "Will you ring 
                         for him?" he requested. 
                     
                     
                         Doctor Cumberly nodded, and 
                         pressed a bell beside the mantelpiece. 
                         An interval followed, in which the in- 
                         spector made notes and Cumberly stood 
                         looking at Leroux, who was beating his 
                         palms upon his knees, and staring un- 
                         seeingly before him. 
                     
                     
                         Cumberly rang again; and, in re- 
                         sponse to the second ring, the house- 
                         maid appeared at the door. 
                     
                     
                         "I rang for Soames," said Doctor 
                         Cumberly. 
                     
                     
                         "He is not in, sir," answered the girl. 
                     
                     
                         Inspector Dunbar started as though 
                         he had been bitten. 
                     
                     
                         "What!" he cried. "Not in?" 
                     
                     
                         "No, sir," said the girl, with wide- 
                         open, frightened eyes. 
                     
                     
                         Dunbar turned to Cumberly. 
                     
                     
                         "You said there was no other way 
                         out!" 
                     
                     
                         "There is no other way, to my knowl- 
                         edge." 
                     
                     
                         "Where's his room?" 
                     
                     
                         Cumberly led the way to a room at 
                         the end of a short corridor, and In- 
                         spector Dunbar, entering, and turning 
                         up the light, glanced about the little 
                         apartment. It was a very neat serv- 
                         ants' bedroom; with comfortable, quite 
                     
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         simple furniture; but the chest of 
                         drawers had been hastily ransacked, 
                         and the contents of a trunk--or some 
                         of its contents--lay strewn about the 
                         floor. 
                     
                     
                         "He has packed his grip!" came Le- 
                         roux's voice from the doorway. "It's 
                         gone!" 
                     
                     
                         The window was wide open. Dunbar 
                         sprang forward and leaned out over the 
                         ledge, looking to right and left, above 
                         and below. 
                     
                     
                         A sort of square courtyard was be- 
                         neath, and, for the convenience of 
                         tradesmen, a hand lift was constructed 
                         outside the kitchens of the three flats 
                         comprising the house; i. e., Mr. Exel's, 
                         ground floor, Henry Leroux's, second 
                         floor, and Doctor Cumberly's, top. It 
                         worked in a skeleton shaft which passed 
                         close to the left of Soames' window. 
                     
                     
                         For an active man, this was a good- 
                         enough ladder, and the inspector with- 
                         drew his head, shrugging his square 
                         shoulders irritably. 
                     
                     
                         "My fault entirely!" he muttered, 
                         biting his wiry mustache. "I should 
                         have come and seen for myself if there 
                         was another way out." 
                     
                     
                         Leroux, in a new flutter of excite- 
                         ment, now craned from the window. 
                     
                     
                         "It might be possible to climb down 
                         the shaft," he cried, after a brief sur- 
                         vey, "but not if one were carrying a 
                         heavy grip, such as that which he has 
                         taken!" 
                     
                     
                         "H'm!" said Dunbar. "You are a 
                         writing gentleman, I understand, and 
                         yet it does not occur to you that he 
                         could have lowered the bag on a cord, 
                         if he wanted to avoid the noise of drop- 
                         ping it!" 
                     
                     
                         "Yes--er--of course!" muttered Le- 
                         roux. "But really--but really--oh, 
                         good heavens! I am bewildered! What 
                         in Heaven's name does it all mean!" 
                     
                     
                         "It means trouble," replied Dunbar 
                         grimly; "bad trouble." 
                     
                     
                         They returned to the study, and In- 
                         spector Dunbar, for the first time since

                         his arrival, walked across and exam- 
                         ined the fragmentary message, raising 
                         his eyebrows when he discovered that 
                         it was written upon the same paper as 
                         Leroux's manuscripts. He glanced, too, 
                         at the pen lying on a page of "Martin 
                         Zeda" near the lamp, and at the inky 
                         splash which told how hastily the pen 
                         had been dropped. 
                     
                     
                         Then--his brows drawn together--he 
                         stooped to the body of the murdered 
                         woman. Partially raising the fur cloak, 
                         he suppressed a gasp of astonishment. 
                     
                     
                         "Why, she only wears a silk night- 
                         dress, and a pair of suede slippers!" 
                     
                     
                         He glanced back over his shoulder. 
                     
                     
                         "I had noted that," said Cumberly, 
                         "The whole business is utterly extraor- 
                         dinary." 
                     
                     
                         "Extraordinary is no word for it!" 
                         growled the inspector, pursuing his ex- 
                         amination. "Marks of pressure at the 
                         throat--yes ; and generally unhealthy 
                         appearance." 
                     
                     
                         "Due to the drug habit," interjected 
                         Doctor Cumberly. 
                     
                     
                         "What drug?" 
                     
                     
                         "I should not like to say out of hand; 
                         possible morphine." 
                     
                     
                         "No jewelry," continued the detec- 
                         tive musingly; "wedding ring--not a 
                         new one. Finger nails well cared for, 
                         but recently neglected. Hair dyed to 
                         hide gray patches; dye wanted renew- 
                         ing. Shoes, French. Night robe, silk; 
                         good lace; probably French, also. 
                         Faint perfume--don't know what it is 
                         --apparently proceeding from civet 
                         fur. Furs, magnificent; very costly." 
                     
                     
                         He slightly moved the table lamp in 
                         order to direct its light upon the white 
                         face. The bloodless lips were parted 
                         and the detective bent, closely peering 
                         at the teeth thus revealed. 
                     
                     
                         "Her teeth are oddly discolored, 
                         doctor," he said, taking out a magni- 
                         fying glass and examining them closely. 
                         "They had been recently scaled, too; 
                         so that she was not in the habit of 
                         neglecting them." 
                     
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         Doctor Cumberly nodded. 
                     
                     
                         "The drug habit, again," he said 
                         guardedly; "a proper examination will 
                         establish the full facts." 
                     
                     
                         The inspector added brief notes to 
                         those already made, ere he rose from 
                         beside the body. Then: 
                     
                     
                         "You are absolutely certain," he 
                         said deliberately, facing Leroux, "that 
                         you had never set eyes on this woman 
                         prior to her coming here, to-night?" 
                     
                     
                         "I can swear it!" said Leroux. 
                     
                     
                         "Good!" replied the detective, and 
                         closed his notebook with a snap. 
                         "Usual formalities will have to be gone 
                         through, but I don't think I need trou- 
                         ble you, gentlemen, any further to- 
                         night." 
                     
                     
                         CHAPTER V. 
                     
                     
                         DOCTORS DIFFER. 
                     
                     
                         DOCTOR CUMBERLY walked 
                         slowly upstairs to his own flat, a 
                         picture etched indelibly upon his mind, 
                         of Henry Leroux, with a face of 
                         despair, sitting below in his dining 
                         room and listening to the ominous 
                         sounds proceeding from the study, 
                         where the police were now busily en- 
                         gaged. In the lobby he met his daugh- 
                         ter Helen, who was waiting for him in 
                         a state of nervous suspense. 
                     
                     
                         "Father!" she began, while rebuke 
                         died upon the doctor's lips. "Tell me 
                         quickly what has happened." 
                     
                     
                         Perceiving that an explanation was 
                         unavoidable, Doctor Cumberly outlined 
                         the story of the night's gruesome hap- 
                         penings, while Big Ben began to chime 
                         the hour of one. 
                     
                     
                         Helen, eager-eyed, and with her 
                         charming face rather pale, hung upon 
                         every word of the narrative. 
                     
                     
                         "And now," concluded her father, 
                         "you must go to bed. I insist." 
                     
                     
                         "But father!" cried the girl. "There 
                         is something-" 
                     
                     
                         She hesitated uneasily. 
                     
                     
                         "Well, Helen, go on," said the doctor. 
                     
                     
                         "I am afraid you will refuse. 
                     
                 
             
             
                 
                 The Yellow Claw 17 
                 
                     
                     
                         "At least give me the opportunity." 
                     
                     
                         "Well--in the glimpse, the half 
                         glimpse, which I had of her, I 
                         seemed-" 
                     
                     
                         Doctor Cumberly rested his hands 
                         upon his daughter's shoulders charac- 
                         teristically, looking into the troubled 
                         gray eyes. 
                     
                     
                         "You don't mean-" he began. 
                     
                     
                         "I thought I recognized her!" whis- 
                         pered the girl. 
                     
                     
                         "Good heavens! Can it be possible?" 
                     
                     
                         "I have been trying, ever since, to 
                         recall where we had met, but without 
                         result. It might mean so much-" 
                     
                     
                         Doctor Cumberly regarded her fix- 
                         edly. 
                     
                     
                         "It might mean so much to--Mr. Le- 
                         roux. But I suppose you will say it is 
                         impossible ?" 
                     
                     
                         "It is impossible," said Doctor Cum- 
                         berly firmly; "dismiss the idea, Helen." 
                     
                     
                         "But father," pleaded the girl, plac- 
                         ing her hands over his own, "consider 
                         what is at stake." 
                     
                     
                         "I am anxious that you should not be- 
                         come involved in this morbid business." 
                     
                     
                         "But you surely know me better than 
                         to expect me to faint or become hys- 
                         terical, or anything silly like that! I 
                         was certainly shocked when I came 
                         down to-night, because--well, it was all 
                         so frightfully unexpected." 
                     
                     
                         Doctor Cumberly shook his head. 
                         Helen put her arms about his neck and 
                         raised her eyes to his. 
                     
                     
                         "You have no right to refuse," she 
                         said softly; "don't you see that?" 
                     
                     
                         Doctor Cumberly frowned. Then: 
                     
                     
                         "You are right, Helen," he agreed. 
                         "I should know your pluck well enough. 
                         But if Inspector Dunbar is gone, the 
                         police may refuse to admit us." 
                     
                     
                         "Then let us hurry!" cried Helen. "I 
                         am afraid they will take away-" 
                     
                     
                         Side by side they descended to Henry 
                         Leroux's flat, ringing the bell, which, 
                         an hour earlier, the lady of the civet 
                         furs had rung. 
                     
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         A sergeant in uniform opened the 
                         door. 
                     
                     
                         "Is Detective Inspector Dunbar 
                         here?" inquired the physician. 
                     
                     
                         "Yes, sir." 
                     
                     
                         "Say that Doctor Cumberly wishes to 
                         speak to him. And"--as the man was 
                         about to depart--"request him not to 
                         arouse Mr. Leroux." 
                     
                     
                         Almost immediately the inspector ap- 
                         peared, a look of surprise upon his face, 
                         which increased on perceiving the girl 
                         beside her father. 
                     
                     
                         "This is my daughter, inspector," ex- 
                         plained Cumberly; "she is a contributor 
                         to the Planet, and to various magazines, 
                         and in this journalistic capacity meets 
                         many people in many walks of life. She 
                         thinks she may be of use to you in pre- 
                         paring your case." 
                     
                     
                         Dunbar bowed rather awkwardly. 
                     
                     
                         "Glad to meet you, Miss Cumberly," 
                         came the inevitable formula. "Entirely 
                         at your service." 
                     
                     
                         "I had an idea, inspector," said the 
                         girl, laying her hand confidentially upon 
                         Dunbar's arm, "that I recognized, when 
                         I entered Mr. Leroux's study, to-night" 
                         --Dunbar nodded--"that I recognized 
                         --the--the victim!" 
                     
                     
                         "Good!" said the inspector, rubbing 
                         his palms briskly together. His tawny 
                         eyes sparkled. "And you would wish 
                         to see her again before we take her 
                         away. Very plucky of you, Miss Cum- 
                         berly! But then, you are a doctor's 
                         daughter." 
                     
                     
                         They entered, and the inspector 
                         closed the door behind them. 
                     
                     
                         "Don't arouse poor Leroux," whis- 
                         pered Cumberly to the detective. "I 
                         left him on a couch in the dining 
                         room." 
                     
                     
                         "He is still there," replied Dunbar; 
                         "poor chap! It is-" 
                     
                     
                         He met Helen's glance, and broke off 
                         shortly. 
                     
                     
                         In the study, two uniformed con- 
                         stables, and an officer in plain clothes, 
                         were apparently engaged in making an

                         inventory--or such was the impression 
                         conveyed. The clock ticked merrily 
                         on; its ticking a desecration, where all 
                         else was hushed in deference to the 
                         grim visitor. The body of the mur- 
                         dered woman had been laid upon the 
                         chesterfield, and a little, dark, bearded 
                         man was conducting an elaborate ex- 
                         amination ; when, seeing the trio enter, 
                         he hastily threw the coat of civet fur 
                         over the body, and stood up, facing the 
                         intruders. 
                     
                     
                         "It's all right, doctor," said the in- 
                         spector; "and we shan't detain you a 
                         moment." He glanced over his shoul- 
                         der. "Mr. Hilton, M. R. C. S.," he 
                         said, indicating the dark man--"Doc- 
                         tor Cumberly and Miss Cumberly." 
                     
                     
                         The divisional surgeon bowed to 
                         Helen and eagerly grasped the hand of 
                         the celebrated physician. 
                     
                     
                         "I am fortunate in being able to ask 
                         your opinion," he began. 
                     
                     
                         Doctor Cumberly nodded shortly, 
                         and, with upraised hand, cut him short. 
                     
                     
                         "I shall willingly give you any as- 
                         sistance in my power," he said ; "but my 
                         daughter has voluntarily committed 
                         herself to a rather painful ordeal, and I 
                         am anxious to get it over." 
                     
                     
                         He stooped and raised the fur from 
                         the ghastly face. 
                     
                     
                         Helen, her hand resting upon her fa- 
                         ther's shoulder, ventured one rapid 
                         glance, and then looked away, shud- 
                         dering slightly. Doctor Cumberly re- 
                         placed the coat and gazed anxiously at 
                         his daughter. But Helen, with ad- 
                         mirable courage, having closed her eyes 
                         for a moment, reopened them, and 
                         smiled at her father's anxiety. She was 
                         pale, but perfectly composed. 
                     
                     
                         "Well, Miss Cumberly?" inquired the 
                         inspector eagerly; while all in the room 
                         watched this slim girl in her charming 
                         dishabille, this dainty figure so utterly 
                         out of place in that scene of morbid 
                         crime. 
                     
                     
                         She raised her gray eyes to the de- 
                         tective. 
                     
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         "I still believe that I have seen the 
                         face somewhere before. But I shall 
                         have to reflect a while--I meet so many 
                         folks, you know, in a casual way--be- 
                         fore I can commit myself to any state- 
                         ment." 
                     
                     
                         In the leonine eyes looking into hers 
                         gleamed the light of admiration and 
                         approval. The canny Scotsman ad- 
                         mired this girl for her beauty, as a 
                         matter of course, for her courage, be- 
                         cause courage was a quality standing 
                         high in his estimation, but, above all, 
                         for her admirable discretion. 
                     
                     
                         "Very proper, Miss Cumberly," he 
                         said; "very proper and wise on your 
                         part. I don't wish to hurry you in any 
                         way, but"--he hesitated, glancing at the 
                         man in plain clothes, who had now re- 
                         sumed a careful perusal of a newspa- 
                         per--"but her name doesn't happen to 
                         be Vernon-" 
                     
                     
                         "Vernon!" cried the girl, her eyes 
                         lighting up at sound of the name. "Mrs. 
                         Vernon! It is! It is! She was 
                         pointed out to me at the last arts ball 
                         --where she appeared in a most mon- 
                         strous Chinese costume-" 
                     
                     
                         "Chinese?" inquired Dunbar, produc- 
                         ing the bulky notebook. 
                     
                     
                         "Yes. Oh, poor, poor soul!" 
                     
                     
                         "You know nothing further about 
                         her, Miss Cumberly?" 
                     
                     
                         "Nothing, inspector. She was merely 
                         pointed out to me as one of the 
                         strangest figures in the hall. Her hus- 
                         band, I understand, is an art expert 
                         who is-" 
                     
                     
                         "He was!'' said Dunbar, closing the 
                         book sharply. "He died this afternoon ; 
                         and a paragraph announcing his death 
                         appears in the newspaper which we 
                         found in the victim's fur coat!" 
                     
                     
                         "But how-" 
                     
                     
                         "It was the only paragraph on the 
                         half page folded outward which was in

                         a fresh plait in the rope around the

                         Helen Cumberly grew slowly quite 
                         pallid. 
                     
                     
                         "Good night," she said; and, bowing 
                         to the detective and to the surgeon, she 
                         prepared to depart. 
                     
                     
                         Mr. Hilton touched Doctor Cumber- 
                         ly's arm, as he, too, was about to retire. 
                     
                     
                         "May I hope," he whispered, "that 
                         you will return and give me the benefit 
                         of your opinion in making out my re- 
                         port?" 
                     
                     
                         Doctor Cumberly glanced at his 
                         daughter; and, seeing her to be per- 
                         fectly composed, "For the moment, I 
                         have formed no opinion, Mr. Hilton," 
                         he said quietly, "not having had an op- 
                         portunity to conduct a proper exam- 
                         ination." 
                     
                     
                         Hilton bent and whispered confi- 
                         dentially in the other's ear: 
                     
                     
                         "She was drugged!" 
                     
                     
                         The innuendo underlying the words 
                         struck Doctor Cumberly forcibly, and 
                         he started back with his brows drawn 
                         together in a frown. 
                     
                     
                         "Do you mean that she was addicted 
                         to the use of drugs," he asked sharply, 
                         "or that the drugging took place to- 
                         night." 
                     
                     
                         "The drugging did take place to- 
                         night!" whispered the other. "An in- 
                         jection was made in the left shoulder 
                         with a hypodermic syringe; the mark 
                         is quite fresh." 
                     
                     
                         Doctor Cumberly glared at his fel- 
                         low practitioner angrily. 
                     
                     
                         "Are there no other marks of injec- 
                         tion?" he asked. 
                     
                     
                         "On the left forearm, yes. Obviously 
                         self-administered. Oh, I don't deny the 
                         habit! But my point is this: the in- 
                         jection in the shoulder was not self- 
                         administered." 
                     
                     
                         "Come, Helen," said Cumberly, tak- 
                         ing his daughter's arm; for she had 
                         drawn near, during the colloquy, "you 
                         must get to bed." 
                     
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         His face was very stern when he 
                         turned again to Mr, Hilton. 
                     
                     
                         "I shall return in a few minutes," he 
                         said, and escorted his daughter from 
                         the room.

                         AT SCOTLAND YARD. 
                     
                     
                         MATTERS of vital importance to 
                         some people whom already we 
                         have met, and to others whom thus far 
                         we have not met, were transacted in a 
                         lofty and rather bleak-looking room at 
                         Scotland Yard between the hours of 
                         nine and ten a. m.; that is, later in the 
                         morning of the fateful day whose ad- 
                         vent we have heard acclaimed from the 
                         Tower of Westminster. 
                     
                     
                         The room, which was lighted by a 
                         large French window opening upon a 
                         balcony, commanded an excellent view 
                         of the Thames Embankment. The 
                         floor was polished to a degree of bright- 
                         ness almost painful. The distempered 
                         walls, save for a severe and solitary 
                         etching of a former commissioner, 
                         were nude in all their unloveliness. A 
                         heavy deal table--upon which rested a 
                         blotting pad, a pewter inkpot, several 
                         newspapers, and two pens--together 
                         with three deal chairs, built rather as 
                         monuments of durability than as exam- 
                         ples of art, constituted the only furni- 
                         ture, if we except an electric lamp with 
                         a green glass shade, above the table. 
                     
                     
                         This was the room of Detective In- 
                         spector Dunbar; and Detective In- 
                         spector Dunbar, at the hour of our en- 
                         trance, will be found seated in the chair, 
                         placed behind the table, his elbows rest- 
                         ing upon the blotting pad. 
                     
                     
                         At ten minutes past nine, exactly, the 
                         door opened, and a thickset, florid man, 
                         buttoned up in a fawn-colored raincoat, 
                         and wearing a bowler hat of obsolete 
                         build, entered. He possessed a black 
                         mustache, a breezy, bustling manner, 
                         and humorous, blue eyes; furthermore, 
                         when he took off his hat, he revealed 
                         the possession of a head of very bristly,

                         upstanding, black hair. This was De- 
                         tective Sergeant Sowerby,.and the same 
                         who was engaged in examining a news- 
                         paper in the study of Henry Leroux 
                         when Doctor Cumberly and his daugh- 
                         ter had paid their second visit to that 
                         scene of an unhappy soul's dismissal. 
                     
                     
                         "Well?" said Dunbar, glancing up at 
                         his subordinate inquiringly. 
                     
                     
                         "I have done all the cab depots," re- 
                         ported Sergeant Sowerby, "and a good 
                         many of the private owners; but so far 
                         the man seen by Mr. Exel has not 
                         turned up.'' 
                     
                     
                         "The word will be passed round now, 
                         though," said Dunbar, "and we shall 
                         probably have him here during the 
                         day." 
                     
                     
                         "I hope so," said the other good- 
                         humoredly, seating himself upon one of 
                         the two chairs ranged beside the wall. 
                         "If he doesn't show up-" 
                     
                     
                         "Well?" jerked Dunbar. "If he 
                         doesn't ?" 
                     
                     
                         "It will look very black against Le- 
                         roux." 
                     
                     
                         Dunbar drummed upon the blotting 
                         pad with the lingers of his left hand. 
                     
                     
                         "It beats anything of the kind that 
                         has ever come my way," he confessed. 
                         "You get pretty cautious at weighing 
                         people up, in this business; but I cer- ' 
                         tainly don't think--mind you, I go no 
                         further--but I certainly don't think Mr. 
                         Henry Leroux would willingly kill a 
                         fly; yet there is circumstantial evidence 
                         enough to hang him." 
                     
                     
                         Sergeant Sowerby nodded, gazing 
                         speculatively at the floor. 
                     
                     
                         "I wonder," he said slowly, "why the 
                         girl--Miss Cumberly--hesitated about 
                         telling us the woman's name?" 
                     
                     
                         "I am not wondering about that at 
                         all," replied Dunbar bluntly. "She 
                         must meet thousands in the same way. 
                         The wonder to me is that she remem- 
                         bered at all. I am open to bet half a 
                         crown that you couldn't remember the 
                         name of every woman you happened to 
                         have pointed out to you at an arts ball?" 
                     
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         "Maybe not," agreed Sowerby; "she's 
                         a smart girl, I'll allow. I see you have 
                         last night's papers there?" 
                     
                     
                         "I have," replied Dunbar; "and I'm 
                         wondering-" 
                     
                     
                         "If there's any connection?" 
                     
                     
                         "Well," continued the inspector, "it 
                         looks, on the face of it, as though the 
                         news of her husband's death had some- 
                         thing to do with Mrs. Vernon's pres- 
                         ence at Leroux's flat. It's not a natural 
                         thing for a woman, on the evening of 
                         her husband's death, to rush straight 
                         away to another man's place." 
                     
                     
                         "It's strange we couldn't find her 
                         clothes." 
                     
                     
                         "It's not strange at all! You're sim- 
                         ply obsessed with the idea that this was 
                         a love intrigue! Think, man! The most 
                         abandoned woman wouldn't run to keep 
                         an appointment with a lover at a time 
                         like that! And, remember, she had the 
                         news in her pocket! She came to that 
                         flat dressed--or undressed--just as we 
                         found her; I'm sure of it. And a point 
                         like that sometimes means the differ- 
                         ence between hanging and acquittal." 
                     
                     
                         Sergeant Sowerby digested these 
                         words, composing his jovial counte- 
                         nance in an expression of unnatural 
                         profundity. Then: 
                     
                     
                         "The point, to my mind," he said, 
                         "is the one raised by Mr. Hilton. By 
                         gum! Didn't Doctor Cumberly tell him 
                         off!" 
                     
                     
                         "Doctor Cumberly," replied Dunbar, 
                         "is entitled to his opinion, that the in- 
                         jection in the woman's shoulder was at 
                         least eight hours old; while Mr. Hilton 
                         is equally entitled to maintain that it 
                         was less than one hour old. Neither 
                         of them can hope to prove his case." 
                     
                     
                         "If either of them could?" 
                     
                     
                         "It might make a difference to the 
                         evidence--but I'm not sure." 
                     
                     
                         "What time is your appointment?" 
                     
                     
                         "Ten o'clock," replied Dunbar. "I 
                         am meeting Mr. Debnam--the late Mr. 
                         Vernon's solicitor. There is something 
                         in it. Damme! I am sure of it!" 
                     
                 
             
             
                 
                 The Yellow Claw 21 
                 
                     
                     
                         "Something in what?" 
                     
                     
                         "The fact that Mr. Vernon died yes- 
                         terday evening, and that his wife was 
                         murdered at midnight." 
                     
                     
                         "What have you told the press?" 
                     
                     
                         "As little as possible, but you will 
                         see that the early editions will all be 
                         screaming for the arrest of Soames." 
                     
                     
                         "I shouldn't wonder. He would be a 
                         useful man to have; but he's probably 
                         out of London now." 
                     
                     
                         "I think not. He's more likely to 
                         wait for instructions from his prin- 
                         cipal." 
                     
                     
                         "His principal?" 
                     
                     
                         "Certainly. You don't think Soames 
                         did the murder, do you ?" 
                     
                     
                         "No; but he's obviously an ac- 
                         cessory." 
                     
                     
                         "I'm not so sure even of that." 
                     
                     
                         "Then why did he bolt?" 
                     
                     
                         "Because he had a guilty conscience." 
                     
                     
                         "Yes," agreed Sowerby; "it does 
                         turn out that way sometimes. At any 
                         rate, Stringer is after him, but he's got 
                         next to nothing to go upon. Has any 
                         reply been received from Mrs. Leroux 
                         in Paris?" 
                     
                     
                         "No," answered Dunbar, frowning 
                         thoughtfully. "Her husband's wire 
                         would reach her first thing this morn- 
                         ing; I am expecting to hear of a reply 
                         at any moment." 
                     
                     
                         "They're a funny couple, altogether," 
                         said Sowerby. "I can't imagine myself 
                         standing for Mrs. Sowerby spending 
                         her week-ends in Paris. Asking for 
                         trouble, I call it!" 
                     
                     
                         "It does seem a daft arrangement," 
                         agreed Dunbar; "but then, as you say, 
                         they're a funny couple." 
                     
                     
                         "I never saw such a bundle of 
                         nerves in all my life!" 
                     
                     
                         "Leroux?" 
                     
                     
                         Sowerby nodded. 
                     
                     
                         "I suppose," he said, "it's the artistic 
                         temperament! If Mrs. Leroux has got 
                         it, too, I don't wonder that they get fed 
                         up with one another's company." 
                     
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         "That's about the secret of it. And 
                         now, I shall be glad, Sowerby, if you 
                         will be after that taxi man again. Re- 
                         port at one o'clock. I shall be here." 
                     
                     
                         "By the way," said Sowerby, with 
                         his hand on the doorknob, "who the 
                         blazes is Mr. King?" 
                     
                     
                         Inspector Dunbar looked up. 
                     
                     
                         "Mr. King," he replied slowly, "is 
                         the solution of the mystery." 
                     
                     
                         CHAPTER VII. 
                     
                     
                         THE MAN IN THE LIMOUSINE. 
                     
                     
                         THE house of the late Horace Ver- 
                         non was a modern villa of pros- 
                         perous appearance; but, on this sunny 
                         September morning, a palpable atmos- 
                         phere of gloom seemed to overlie it. 
                         This made itself perceptible even to the 
                         toughened and unimpressionable nerves 
                         of Inspector Dunbar. As he mounted 
                         the five steps leading up to the door, 
                         glancing meanwhile at the lowered 
                         blinds at the windows, he wondered 
                         if, failing these evidences and his own 
                         private knowledge of the facts, he 
                         should have recognized that the hand of 
                         tragedy had placed its mark upon this 
                         house. But when the door was opened 
                         by a white-faced servant, he told him- 
                         self that he should, for a veritable mi- 
                         asma of death seemed to come out to 
                         meet him, to envelop him. 
                     
                     
                         Within, proceeded a subdued activ- 
                         ity: somber figures moved upon the 
                         staircase; and Inspector Dunbar, hav- 
                         ing presented his card, presently found 
                         himself in a well-appointed library. 
                     
                     
                         At the table, whereon were spread a 
                         number of documents, sat a lean, clean- 
                         shaven, sallow-faced man, wearing 
                         gold-rimmed pince-nez; a man whose 
                         demeanor of businesslike gloom was 
                         most admirably adapted to that place 
                         and occasion. This was Mr. Debnam, 
                         the solicitor. He gravely waved the 
                         detective to an armchair, adjusted his 
                         pince-nez, and coughed, introductorily. 
                     
                     
                         "Your communication, inspector," he

                         began--he had the kind of voice which 
                         seems to be buried in sawdust pack- 
                         ing--"was brought to me this morn- 
                         ing, and has disturbed me immeasur- 
                         ably, unspeakably." 
                     
                     
                         "You have been to view the body, 
                         sir?" 
                     
                     
                         "One of my clerks, who knew Mrs. 
                         Vernon, has just returned to this house 
                         to report that he has identified her." 
                     
                     
                         "I should have preferred you to 
                         have gone yourself, sir," began Dun- 
                         bar, taking out his notebook. 
                     
                     
                         "My state of health, inspector," said 
                         the solicitor, "renders it undesirable 
                         that I should submit myself to an or- 
                         deal so unnecessary--so wholly un- 
                         necessary." 
                     
                     
                         "Very good!" muttered Dunbar, 
                         making an entry in his book; "your 
                         clerk, then, whom I can see in a mo- 
                         ment, identifies the murdered woman 
                         as Mrs. Vernon. What was her Chris- 
                         tian name?" 
                     
                     
                         "Iris--Iris Mary Vernon." 
                     
                     
                         Inspector Dunbar made a note of the 
                         fact. 
                     
                     
                         "And now," he said, "you will have 
                         read the copy of that portion of my re- 
                         port which I submitted to you this 
                         morning--acting upon information 
                         supplied by Miss Helen Cumberly?" 
                     
                     
                         "Yes, yes, inspector, I have read it 
                         --but, by the way, I do not know Miss 
                         Cumberly." 
                     
                     
                         "Miss Cumberly," explained the de- 
                         tective, "is the daughter of Doctor 
                         Cumberly, a Harley Street physician. 
                         She lives with her father in the flat 
                         above that of Mr. Leroux. She saw 
                         the body by accident--and recognized it 
                         as that of a lady who had been named 
                         to her at the last arts ball." 
                     
                     
                         "Ah!" said Debnam. "Yes--I see-- 
                         at the arts ball, inspector. This is a 
                         mysterious and a very ghastly case." 
                     
                     
                         "It is, indeed, sir," agreed Dunbar. 
                         "Can you throw any light upon the 
                         presence of Mrs. Vernon at Mr. Le- 
                     
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         roux's flat on the very night of her 
                         husband's death?" 
                     
                     
                         "I can--and I cannot," answered the 
                         solicitor, leaning back in the chair and 
                         again adjusting his pince-nez, in the 
                         manner of a man having important mat- 
                         ters--and gloomy, very gloomy, mat- 
                         ters--to communicate. 
                     
                     
                         "Good!" said the inspector, and pre- 
                         pared to listen. 
                     
                     
                         "You see," continued Debnam, "the 
                         late Mrs. Vernon was not actually re- 
                         siding with her husband at the date of 
                         his death." 
                     
                     
                         "Indeed!" 
                     
                     
                         "Ostensibly"--the solicitor shook a 
                         lean forefinger at his vis-à-vis-- 
                         "ostensibly, inspector, she was visiting 
                         her sister in Scotland." 
                     
                     
                         Inspector Dunbar sat up very

                         "These visits were of frequent oc- 
                         currence, and usually of about a week's 
                         duration. Mr. Vernon, my late client, 
                         a man--I'll not deny it--of inconstant 
                         affections--you understand me, in-

                         belonged to a smart, bohemian set, and 
                         --to use a popular figure of speech-- 
                         burned the candle at both ends; late

                         other feverish pursuits, possibly taken 
                         up as a result of the--shall I say, 
                         cooling?--of her husband's affec-

                         so far as to point out to Mr. Vernon

                         not enjoy that social status to which 
                         my late client elevated her. For many 
                         years she held no open communication 
                         with any member of her family, but lat- 
                         terly, as I have explained, she acquired

                         "Rather crudely expressed, perhaps," 
                         said the solicitor, peering over the top 
                         of his glasses, "but you have the idea.

                         the healing breezes of the heatherland." 
                         Mr. Debnam was thoroughly warming

                         "Interrupting you for a moment," 
                         said the inspector, "at what intervals 
                         did these visits take place?"

                         questioningly. On Thursday, the sec- 
                         ond of September, she left for Scot-

                         "Did any one actually see her off?" 
                     
                     
                         "No, not that I am aware of, in-

                         "To put the whole thing quite 
                         bluntly, Mr. Debnam," said Dunbar, 
                         fixing his tawny eyes upon the solicitor, 
                         "Mr. Vernon was thoroughly glad to 
                         get rid of her for a week?" 
                     
                     
                         Mr. Debnam shifted uneasily in his 
                         chair; the truculent directness of the 
                         detective was unpleasing to his tortuous 
                         mind. However: 
                     
                     
                         "I fear you have hit upon the truth," 
                         he confessed, "and I must admit that 
                         we have no legal evidence of her leav- 
                         ing for Scotland on this, or on any 
                         other occasion. Letters were received 
                         from Perth, and letters sent to Auch- 
                         terander from London were answered. 
                         But the truth, the painful truth, came 
                         to light unexpectedly, dramatically, on 
                         Monday last." 
                     
                     
                         "Four days ago?" 
                     
                     
                         "Exactly; three days before the death 
                         of my client." Mr. Debnam wagged 
                         his finger at the inspector again. "I 
                         maintain," he said, "that this painful 
                         discovery, which I am about to men- 
                         tion, precipitated my client's end; al- 
                         though it is a fact that there was-- 
                         hereditary heart trouble. But I admit 
                         that his neglect of his wife--to give it 
                         no harsher name--contributed to the 
                         catastrophe." 
                     
                     
                         He paused to give dramatic point to 
                         the revelation.

                         of extremely dark complexion. Mr. 
                         Vernon was unable to perceive more 
                         than this, for the man had his back to- 
                         ward him. But the light shone fully 
                         upon the face of Mrs. Vernon, who ap- 
                         peared pale and exhausted. She wore 
                         a conspicuous motor coat of civet fur, 
                         and it was this which first attracted 
                         Mr. Vernon's attention. The blow was 
                         a very severe one to a man in my 
                         client's state of health; and although 
                         I cannot claim that his own conscience 
                         was clear, this open violation of the 
                         marriage vows outraged the husband 
                         --outraged him. In fact, he was so 
                         perturbed, that he stood there shaking, 
                         quivering, unable to speak or act, and 
                         the car drove away before he had re-

                         ing morning, Mr. Vernon, very much 
                         shaken, called upon me and instructed 
                         me to dispatch an agent to Perth im-

                         "And his report was?" 
                     
                     
                         "His report, inspector, telegraphic, of 
                         course, was this: that no sister of Mrs. 
                         Vernon resided at the address; that the 
                         place was a cottage occupied by a cer- 
                         tain Mrs. Fry and her husband; that 
                         the husband was of no occupation, and 
                         had no visible means of support"--he 
                         ticked off the points on the long fore- 
                         finger--"that the Frys lived better than 
                         any of their neighbors; and--most im- 
                         portant of all--that Mrs. Fry's maiden 
                         name, which my agent discovered by 
                         recourse to the parish register of mar- 
                         riages--was Ann Fairchild." 
                     
                     
                         "What of that?" 
                     
                     
                         "Ann Fairchild was a former maid 
                         of Mrs. Vernon!" 
                     
                     
                         "In short, it amounts to this, then: 
                         Mrs. Vernon, during these various ab- 
                         sences, never went to Scotland at all? 
                         It was a conspiracy?" 
                     
                     
                         "Exactly--exactly, inspector! I 
                         wired, instructing my agent to extort, 
                         from the woman Fry, the address to 
                         which she forwarded letters received 
                         by her for Mrs. Vernon. The lady's 
                         death, news of which will now have 
                         reached him, will no doubt be a lever, 
                         enabling my representative to obtain the 
                         desired information." 
                     
                     
                         "When do you expect to hear from 
                         him?" 
                     
                     
                         "At any moment. Failing a full con- 
                         fession by the Frys, you will, of course, 
                         know how to act, inspector?" 
                     
                     
                         "Damme!" cried Dunbar. "Can your 
                         man be relied upon to watch them? 
                         They mustn't slip away! Shall I in- 
                         struct Perth to arrest the couple?" 
                     
                     
                         "I wired my agent this morning, in- 
                         spector, to communicate with the local 
                         police respecting the Frys." 
                     
                     
                         Inspector Dunbar tapped his small, 
                         widely separated teeth with the end of 
                         his fountain pen. 
                     
                     
                         "I have had one priceless witness slip

                         hand in my resignation if the Frys go!" 
                     
                     
                         "To whom do you refer?" 
                     
                     
                         Inspector Dunbar rose. 
                     
                     
                         "It is a point with which I need not 
                         trouble you, sir," he said. "It was not 
                         included in the extract of report sent 
                         to you. This is going to be the biggest 
                         case of my professional career, or my 
                         name is not Robert Dunbar!" 
                     
                     
                         Closing his notebook, he thrust it into 
                         his pocket, and replaced his fountain 
                         pen in the little leather wallet. 
                     
                     
                         "Of course," said the solicitor, rising 
                         in turn, and adjusting the troublesome 
                         pince-nez, "there was some intrigue 
                         with Leroux? So much is evident." 
                     
                     
                         "You will be thinking that, eh?" 
                     
                     
                         "My dear inspector"--Mr. Debnam, 
                         the wily, was seeking information-- 
                         "my dear inspector, Leroux's own wife 
                         was absent in Paris--quite a safe dis- 
                         tance; and Mrs. Vernon--now proven 
                         to be a woman conducting a love in-

                         of the way for the evening." 
                     
                     
                         "Quite so," said Dunbar shortly, 
                         "quite so, Mr. Debnam." He opened 
                         the door. "Might I see the late Mrs. 
                         Vernon's maid?" 
                     
                     
                         "She is at her home. As I told you, 
                         Mrs. Vernon habitually released her 
                         for the period of these absences." 
                     
                     
                         The notebook reappeared. 
                     
                     
                         "The young woman's address?" 
                     
                     
                         "You can get it from the house- 
                         keeper. Is there anything else you wish 
                         to know ?" 
                     
                     
                         "Nothing beyond that, thank you." 
                     
                     
                         Three minutes later, Inspector Dun- 
                         bar had written in his book: "Clarice

                         He departed from the house whereat 
                         Death the Gleaner had twice knocked

                         CABMAN TWO. 
                     
                     
                         RETURNING to Scotland Yard, In- 
                         spector Dunbar walked straight up 
                         to his own room. There he found Sow- 
                         erby, very red-faced and humid, and a 
                         taximan who sat stolidly surveying the 
                         Embankment from the window. 
                     
                     
                         "Hello!" cried Dunbar. "He's 
                         turned up, then?" 
                     
                     
                         "No, he hasn't," replied Sowerby, 
                         with a mild irritation. "But we know 
                         where to find him, and he ought to lose 
                         his license." 
                     
                     
                         The taximan turned hurriedly. He 
                         wore a muffler so tightly packed be- 
                         tween his neck and the collar of his uni- 
                         form jacket, that it appeared materially 
                         to impair his respiration. His face pos- 
                         sessed a bluish tinge, suggestive of as- 
                         phyxia, and his watery eyes protruded 
                         remarkably; his breathing was noisily 
                         audible. 
                     
                     
                         "No, chuck it, mister!" he exclaimed. 
                         "I'm only tellin' you 'cause it ain't my 
                         line to play tricks on the police. You'll 
                         find my name in the books downstairs 
                         more'n any other driver in London! I 
                         reckon I've brought enough umbrellas, 
                         cameras, walkin' sticks, hopera cloaks, 
                         watches, and sichlike in 'ere, to set up a 
                         blarsted pawnbroker's!" 
                     
                     
                         "That's all right, my lad!" said Dun- 
                         bar, holding up his hand to silence the 
                         voluble speaker. "There's going to be 
                         no license losing. You did not hear 
                         that you were wanted before?" 
                     
                     
                         The watery eyes of the cabman pro- 
                         truded painfully; he respired like a 
                         horse. 
                     
                     
                         "Me, guvnor!" he exclaimed. "Gor- 
                         bli'me! I ain't the bloke! I was drivin'

                         Again Dunbar held up his hand.

                         "No doubt you mean well," he said; 
                         "but damme! begin at the beginning! 
                         Who are you, and what have you come 
                         to tell us?" 
                     
                     
                         "Oo are I ? 'Ere's oo I ham!" 
                         wheezed the cabman, proffering a 
                         greasy license. "Richard 'Amper, No. 
                         3 Breams Mews, Dulwich Village." 
                     
                     
                         "That's all right," said Dunbar, 
                         thrusting back the proffered document. 
                         "And last night you had taken Mr.

                         to his residence in-" 
                     
                     
                         "In Peers' Chambers, Westminister-- 
                         that's it, guvnor! Cornin' back, I 'ave 
                         to pass along the north side o' the 
                         square, an' just a'ead o' me, I see old 
                         Tom Brian a-pullin' round the Johnny 
                         'Orner--'im cornin' from Palace Man- 
                         sions." 
                     
                     
                         "Mr. Exel only mentioned seeing one 
                         cab," muttered Dunbar, glancing keenly 
                         aside at Sowerby. 
                     
                     
                         "Wotcher say, guvnor?" asked the 
                         cabman. 
                     
                     
                         "I say--did you see a gentleman ap- 
                         proaching from the corner?" asked 
                         Dunbar. 
                     
                     
                         "Yus," declared the man; "I see 'im, 
                         but 'e 'adn't got as far as the Johnny 
                         'Orner. As I passed outside old Tom 
                         Brian, wot's changin' 'is gear, I see a 
                         bloke blowin' along on the pavement--a 
                         bloke in a 'igh 'at, an' wearin' a heye- 
                         glass." 
                     
                     
                         "At this time, then," pursued Dun- 
                         bar, "you had actually passed the other 
                         cab, and the gentleman on the pavement 
                         had not come up with it?" 
                     
                     
                         "'E couldn't see it, guvnor! I'm 
                         tellin' you 'e 'adn't got to the Johnny 
                         'Orner!" 
                     
                     
                         "I see," muttered Sowerby. "It's 
                         possible that Mr. Exel took no notice 
                         of the first cab--especially as it did not 
                         come out of the square." 
                     
                     
                         "Wotcher say, guvnor?" queried the 
                         cabman again, turning his bleared eyes 
                         upon Sergeant Sowerby. 
                     
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         "He said," interrupted Dunbar, "was 
                         Brian's cab empty?" 
                     
                     
                         "Course it was," rapped Mr. Ham- 
                         per, " 'e'd just dropped 'is fare at Pal- 
                         ace Mansions." 
                     
                     
                         "How do you know?" snapped Dun- 
                         bar suddenly, fixing his fierce eyes upon 
                         the face of the speaker. 
                     
                     
                         The cabman glared in beery truc- 
                         ulence. 
                     
                     
                         "I got me blarsted senses, ain't I?" 
                         he inquired. "There's only two lots o' 
                         flats on that side o' the Square--Palace 
                         Mansions, an' St. Andrew's Mansions." 
                     
                     
                         "Well ?" 
                     
                     
                         "St. Andrew's Mansions," continued 
                         Hamper, "is all away!" 
                     
                     
                         "All away?" 
                     
                     
                         "All away! I know, 'cause I used to 
                         have a reg'lar fare there. 'E's in Egyp'; 
                         flat shut up. Top floor's to let. Bot-

                         lations. W'here can old Tom Brian 
                         'ave been cornin' from, if it wasn't Pal- 
                         ace Mansions?" 
                     
                     
                         "H'm!" said Dunbar. "You are a 
                         loss to the detective service, my lad! 
                         And how do you account for the fact 
                         that Brian has not got to hear of the 
                         inquiry?" 
                     
                     
                         Hamper bent to Dunbar and whis- 
                         pered beerily in his ear: "P'r'aps 'e 
                         don't want to 'ear, guvnor!" 
                     
                     
                         "Oh! Why not?" 
                     
                     
                         "Well, 'e knows there's something up 
                         there!" 
                     
                     
                         "Therefore it's his plain duty to as- 
                         sist the police." 
                     
                     
                         "Same as what I does?" cried Ham- 
                         per, raising his eyebrows. "Course it 
                         is! But 'ow d'you know 'e ain't been 
                         got at?" 
                     
                     
                         "Our friend, here, evidently has one 
                         up against Mr. Tom Brian!" muttered 
                         Dunbar aside to Sowerby. 
                     
                     
                         "Wotcher say, guvnor?" inquired the 
                         cabman, looking from one to the other. 
                     
                     
                         "I say, no doubt you can save us the 
                     
                 
             
             
                 
                 The Yellow Claw 27 
                 
                     
                     
                         trouble of looking out Brian's license, 
                         and give us his private address?" re- 
                         plied Dunbar. 
                     
                     
                         "Course I can. 'E lives hat num'er 
                         36 Forth Street, Brixton, and 'e's out 
                         o' the big Brixton depot." 
                     
                     
                         "Oh!" said Dunbar dryly. "Does he 
                         owe you anything?" 
                     
                     
                         "Wotcher say, guvnor ?" 
                     
                     
                         "I say, it's very good of you to take 
                         all this trouble and whatever it has cost 
                         you in time, we shall be pleased to put 
                         right." 
                     
                     
                         Mr. Hamper spat in his right palm, 
                         and rubbed his hands together appre- 
                         ciatively. 
                     
                     
                         "Make it five bob!" he said. 
                     
                     
                         "Wait downstairs," directed Dunbar, 
                         pressing a bell push beside the door. 
                         "I'll get it put through for you." 
                     
                     
                         "Righto!" rumbled the cabman, and 
                         went lurching from the room as a con- 
                         stable in uniform appeared at the door. 
                         "Good mornin', guvnor. Good morn- 
                         in'!" 
                     
                     
                         The cabman having departed, leaving 
                         in his wake a fragrant odor of four- 
                         penny ale: 
                     
                     
                         "Here you are, Sowerby!" cried 
                         Dunbar. "We are moving at last! This 
                         is the address of the late Mrs. Vernon's 
                         maid. See her; feel your ground care- 
                         fully, of course; get to know what 
                         clothes Mrs. Vernon took with her on 
                         her periodical visits to Scotland." 
                     
                     
                         "What clothes?" 
                     
                     
                         "That's the idea; it is important. I 
                         don't think the girl was in her mistress' 
                         confidence, but I leave it to you to find 
                         out. If circumstances point to my sur- 
                         mise being inaccurate--you know how 
                         to act." 
                     
                     
                         "Just let me glance over your notes, 
                         bearing on the matter," said Sowerby, 
                         "and I'll be off." 
                     
                     
                         Dunbar handed him the bulging note- 
                         book, and Sergeant Sowerby lowered 
                         his inadequate eyebrows thoughtfully, 
                         while he scanned the evidence of Mr. 
                         Debnam. Then, returning the book to 
                     
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         his superior, and adjusting the peculiar 
                         bowler firmly upon his head, he set out. 
                     
                     
                         Dunbar glanced through some papers 
                         --apparently reports--which lay upon 
                         the table, penciled comments upon two 
                         of them, and then, consulting his note- 
                         book once more in order to refresh his 
                         memory, started off for Forth Street, 
                         Brixton. 
                     
                     
                         Forth Street, Brixton, is a depressing 
                         thoroughfare. It contains small, cheap 
                         flats, and a number of frowzy-looking 
                         houses which give one the impression of 
                         having run to seed. A hostelry of sad 
                         aspect occupies a commanding position 
                         midway along the street, but inspires 
                         the traveler not with cheer, but with 
                         lugubrious reflections upon the horrors 
                         of inebriety. The odors, unpleasantly 
                         mingled, of fried bacon and paraffin oil, 
                         are wafted to the wayfarer from the 
                         porches of these family residences. 
                     
                     
                         No. 36 proved to be such a villa, and 
                         Inspector Dunbar contemplated it from 
                         a distance thoughtfully. As he stood 
                         by the door of the public house, gazing 
                         across the street, a tired-looking 
                         woman, lean and anxious-eyed, a poor, 
                         dried-up bean pod of a woman, ap- 
                         peared from the door of No. 36, car- 
                         rying a basket. She walked along in 
                         the direction of the neighboring high- 
                         road, and Dunbar casually followed her. 
                     
                     
                         For some ten minutes he studied her 
                         activities, noting that she went from 
                         shop to shop until her basket was laden 
                         with provisions of all sorts. When she 
                         entered a wine-and-spirit merchant's, 
                         the detective entered close behind her, 
                         for the place was also a post office. 
                         While he purchased a penny stamp and 
                         fumbled in his pocket for an imaginary 
                         letter, he observed, with interest, that 
                         the woman had purchased, and was 
                         loading into the hospitable basket, a bot- 
                         tle of whisky, a bottle of rum, and a 
                         bottle of gin. 
                     
                     
                         He left the shop ahead of her, sure, 
                         now, of his ground, always provided 
                         that the woman proved to be Mrs.

                         Brian. Dunbar walked along Forth 
                         Street slowly enough to enable the 
                         woman to overtake him. At the door 
                         of No. 36, he glanced up at the num- 
                         ber questioningly, and turned in the gate 
                         as she was about to enter. 
                     
                     
                         He raised his hat. 
                     
                     
                         "Have I the pleasure of addressing 
                         Mrs. Brian?" 
                     
                     
                         Momentarily, a hard look came into 
                         the tired eyes, but Dunbar's gentleness 
                         of manner and voice, together with the 
                         kindly expression upon his face, turned 
                         the scales favorably. 
                     
                     
                         "I am Mrs. Brian," she said; "yes. 
                         Did you want to see me?" 
                     
                     
                         "On a matter of some importance. 
                         May I come in?" 
                     
                     
                         She nodded and led the way into the 
                         house; the door was not closed. 
                     
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         In a living room whereon was writ- 
                         ten a pathetic history--a history of 
                         decline from easy circumstances and re- 
                         spectability to poverty and utter disre- 
                         gard of appearances--she confronted 
                         him, setting down her basket on a 
                         table from which the remains of a fish 
                         breakfast were not yet removed. 
                     
                     
                         "Is your husband in?" inquired Dun- 
                         bar, with a subtle change of manner. 
                     
                     
                         "He's lying down." 
                     
                     
                         The hard look was creeping again 
                         into the woman's eyes. 
                     
                     
                         "Will you please awake him, and tell 
                         him that I have called in regard to his 
                         license?" 
                     
                     
                         He thrust a card into her hand:

                         RATHER than be separated from her husband, Ida Hadley, of Muskogee, 
                         Oklahoma, acquitted of the murder of Sheriff Take Giles, of Beaumont, vol- 
                         untarily accepted a sentence of ten years in the penitentiary for attempted jail 
                         breaking. 
                     
                     
                         Paul Hadley was convicted of being an accessory to the murder of Giles, 
                         and given a life sentence. Mrs. Hadley actually shot Giles, but the jury acquitted 
                         her on the ground of insanity. The Hadleys were taken to the penitentiary at 
                         McAlester together. 
                     
                     
                         Giles was shot and killed on a railroad train near here several weeks ago 
                         when taking Hadley to Texas to answer the charges following the latter's arrest 
                         in Kansas City. Mrs. Hadley had permission to accompany her husband. 
                     
                     
                         Mrs. Hadley raved like a madwoman when the verdict was read. Shriek- 
                         ing and screaming, she threw herself upon her husband and fought the officers 
                         who strove to tear her from him. Four officers carried her to a police patrol, 
                         and she was taken back to her cell. 
                     
                     
                         Her husband received the verdict calmly. "I am not guilty; I know nothing 
                         of a plot to kill Giles, yet I am satisfied," he said. "Had they taken me back to 
                         Texas, they would have killed me, anyway. I'm glad they gave me life, and I'm 
                         glad they acquitted Ida."

                     by  Ladd Plumley  
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         WHEN Jenifer Melvin Cobb's 
                         clerk discharged himself, the 
                         time was two-thirty; when 
                         Jenifer's bloody shirt was 
                         removed, and a doctor administered a 
                         heart stimulant, the time was four-ten. 
                         In this hour and forty minutes, if Cobb 
                         learned nothing, there is no hope that 
                         he will ever learn anything. 
                     
                     
                         "We've got 'em coming like crows 
                         to cornfields in May!" Cobb merrily 
                         gloated. "Big mail. Saturday, but I 
                         can't let you off this afternoon." 
                     
                     
                         The clerk's face showed that he was 
                         not as enthusiastic as his employer 
                         concerning the mail. He braved a mut- 
                         tered remonstrance. 
                     
                     
                         "What's that?" snapped Cobb. 
                         "What do I pay you for?" 
                     
                     
                         The clerk, who had been about to 
                         leave the private office, turned and pre- 
                         sented to his employer an angry face. 
                         "I've decided, Mr. Cobb," he said, "that 
                         I'll be looking for another job. It isn't 
                         altogether the long hours, and no Sat- 
                         urday afternoons. I'll put it hard from 
                         the shoulder--I don't like the business." 
                     
                     
                         "Suffering Moses!" exclaimed Cobb. 
                         "If you don't like your job, you can 
                         dig out, of course. But you haven't 
                         the right to spout anything against the 
                         business. What's in your mind? Speak 
                         up. Chuck your grouch! Don't stand 
                         there with your mouth open like a calf 
                         choking on an apple. Chuck it--and, 
                     
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         if you want, get out. It's easy to dig 
                         up clerks. There're plenty of strap 
                         hangers waiting to drop into your seat." 
                     
                     
                         "These lots you're selling," grumbled 
                         the clerk. "There's a fellow who's 
                         from the east--Long Island--he's put 
                         me wise about that land--the last is the 
                         worst--the Clearwater addition. The 
                         fellow chucked it that there isn't any 
                         real land there. All bogs. He says 
                         you'd have to scoop cellars with a 
                         spoon. He says-" 
                     
                     
                         "That'll do," jerked in Cobb. "Do the 
                         advertisements state that they're not 
                         swampy? Those lots are just as they're 
                         represented. There's no come-back. 
                         The Clearwater addition is inside of a 
                         circle that takes thirty miles around the 
                         center of the biggest city on the globe. 
                         Who says those lots aren't the biggest 
                         bargain you can find between old New 
                         York and the Pacific coast?" 
                     
                     
                         "I do!" snapped back the clerk, his 
                         jaw suddenly seeming to grow a square- 
                         ness that before had not been notice- 
                         able. "And it isn't only the Clearwater 
                         addition--it's everything. I get out. 
                         See! Nobody ever said I was a softy, 
                         and I ain't. But selling acre boglands 
                         in scraps, where there ain't nothing but 
                         a country road miles and miles away, 
                         and selling to women who think they're 
                         let into a sixteen-carat proposition! I 
                         ain't a softy, but it's got its hooks 
                         into me, and here's where I get out!"

                         The young man behind the mahogany 
                         desk flicked specks of imaginary dust 
                         from the sleeve of his perfectly dust- 
                         less coat. Then he leaned back in his 
                         chair, and, while he tapped the fin- 
                         gers of one hand on the polished wood 
                         before him, he scowled as he critically 
                         examined the fingers of his other hand, 
                         a hand which showed nails that evi- 
                         dently had more care lavished upon 
                         them than had even been lavished on 
                         the rest of his person. 
                     
                     
                         "I'll phone Dunham, and you'll get 
                         your pay," said Cobb. "But, of course, 
                         it's understood that everything that 
                         you've learned here as my clerk is 
                         strictly confidential--strictly confiden- 
                         tial." 
                     
                     
                         "Sure!" replied the other, and with- 
                         out hesitation. "Nobody hands me a 
                         pay envelope for missionary stunts. 
                         You'll give me a letter, too. Must have 
                         a letter. It isn't easy to yank in an- 
                         other job." 
                     
                     
                         "If you do regard the matters of this 
                         office as strictly confidential, best kind 
                         of a letter," promised Cobb. 
                     
                     
                         "I said I would, and I mean it. I 
                         don't believe in slinging mud at the last 
                         boss. That ain't my way." 
                     
                     
                         "Leave your house address, and I'll 
                         send the letter." 
                     
                     
                         "Not for little Willie boy--not in this 
                         office," replied the clerk. 
                     
                     
                         Cobb tapped his fingers on the desk 
                         again. "You won't take any chances 
                         with me," he said, while his lip curled 
                         downward, displaying teeth which had 
                         the same care as his hands. 
                     
                     
                         "Seen too much to take chances," re- 
                         plied the other. "Seen a great deal too 
                         much." 
                     
                     
                         "Send in the stenographer--I'll dic- 
                         tate a letter now--sign it before five. 
                         I'll do more than the letter. I'll tell 
                         Dunham to give you three weeks' pay. 
                         My affairs are strictly confidential. 
                         Savvy!" 
                     
                     
                         "Sure!" again replied the clerk. "It's 
                         a go. But I wouldn't have said any- 
                     
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         thing, even if you hadn't offered me 
                         the extra." 
                     
                     
                         With this concession for what his 
                         code of business ethics would have pre- 
                         vented him from doing, anyhow, the 
                         clerk opened the door and passed out, 
                         leaving his employer to his pile of cor- 
                         respondence. 
                     
                     
                         "Like salts in hot water, that sort of 
                         tootsie baby slush!" exclaimed Cobb, 
                         as he began to sort out his letters. 
                         "Never told any one this was a bread 
                         line or a Salvation Army shop. If 
                         you've got a hunch for the good old 
                         stuff, and have the brains to pull it, 
                         you'd be a fool if you didn't pull it. 
                         And I pay good money to my adver- 
                         tising men for saying everything they 
                         can say that's good about my deals. 
                         Then my bait is gone over by the slick- 
                         est legal talent I can get. It's up to 
                         the fishes to find out what's queer!" 
                     
                     
                         Cobb had just dictated the letter he 
                         had promised the clerk, when a visitor 
                         was admitted into the private office, al- 
                         though his instructions were to admit 
                         no visitors. She, for, due to the 
                         peculiarities of his trade, Cobb dealt 
                         mostly with those feminine, was one 
                         of the women who have school-teacher 
                         so plainly written on their faces and 
                         persons that it is as if their occupation 
                         were carried before them inscribed on 
                         a banner. Past middle age, she was as 
                         easy a prey for her hopes for an invest- 
                         ment of cent per cent on her meager 
                         savings as a starving rat is a prey for 
                         a poisoned piece of meat. She timor- 
                         ously entered--the office and man were 
                         bluffingly imposing--and took an un- 
                         easy seat beside the shining mahogany 
                         desk. She hardly dared raise her eyes 
                         to the frowning face at her side. 
                     
                     
                         "It was really awfully hard work 
                         to get in here," she said falteringly. 
                         "Seemed as if they'd never, never let 
                         me. But the men outside wouldn't talk 
                         about my lot--and, I'm sorry to 
                         trouble you, Mr. Cobb--but it's so--so 
                         very important." 
                     
                 
             
             
                 
                 Two--Not of a Kind 31 
                 
                     
                     
                         Cobb had picked up a letter from the 
                         heap, and seemed to be studying it at- 
                         tentively. He had learned that visitors 
                         could be put where he wanted to put 
                         them by pushing in hard the idea that 
                         their affairs were of no importance. 
                         He rattled the sheet and scowled over 
                         the top of it before again blanketing 
                         his face. 
                     
                     
                         "Come to the point!" he snapped. 
                     
                     
                         "I was led to believe by one of your 
                         agents-" 
                     
                     
                         "What's that?" flared in Cobb. 
                     
                     
                         "I was led to believe that in a year's 
                         time-" 
                     
                     
                         "Or five or ten," put in Cobb 
                         sharply. 
                     
                     
                         "Anyhow," the woman continued, 
                         "the agent and the circular told how 
                         the great American property owners 
                         had begun by buying land. I took my 
                         savings from the bank--years of sav- 
                         ings--and bought a lot. The Clear- 
                         water extension--it's on the map, over 
                         there. And--now--well--we need the 
                         money--we need it terribly. I've got 
                         to get money somewhere." 
                     
                     
                         "Now," clicked in Cobb's brisk 
                         voice, as he lowered the letter before 
                         blanketing his face once more. "Hit 
                         the pike. What's all this, anyway?" 
                     
                     
                         "My mother--I support her,'' per- 
                         sisted the school-teacher, while she 
                         nervously twisted into a knot the gloves 
                         in her lap and untwisted them again. 
                         "My mother! She has the most fright- 
                         ful dread of public hospitals. She says 
                         she will never go to one--never. She 
                         says that-" 
                     
                     
                         "Will you please cut it short?" came 
                         again the sharp and intimidating voice, 
                         as the letter was crisply rattled and 
                         lowered to the desk, where Cobb jotted 
                         on the margin a penciled memorandum. 
                         "What was it you were saying?" he 
                         asked. "Oh, yes, the Clearwater addi- 
                         tion. My advice is to hold on to that 
                         lot. Don't let it get away from you-- 
                         don't, I say, let it get away!" 
                     
                     
                         "But I've got to have money for 
                     
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         my mother's operation. The doctors 
                         say it is the one chance to save her 
                         life, and they say that in her weak con- 
                         dition, and feeling as she does about 
                         hospitals, it might kill her to make her 
                         go to one. There's nobody I can 
                         borrow' from, and--well--I thought 
                         that under the circumstances you would 
                         take the lot back--say, with four per 
                         cent interest on the price. That's what 
                         the savings bank paid me." 
                     
                     
                         Cobb made a vicious jab at his mem- 
                         orandum. Then he glanced at the 
                         woman. The glance was what you 
                         might expect from a hawk that had 
                         just indulged in a bit of the flesh of a 
                         sparrow which had fallen into its 
                         claws. 
                     
                     
                         "So that's what you want," he said. 
                         "We sell real estate--our concern never 
                         buys it--not subdivided." 
                     
                     
                         "But my mother," implored the 
                         school-teacher, subduing with difficulty 
                         the tears, notwithstanding the training 
                         of many years in a soul-racking occu- 
                         pation. 
                     
                     
                         It was as if Cobb had suddenly be- 
                         come deaf. He smiled at his pencil, 
                         showing the teeth, which, although so 
                         white, suggested the teeth of a steel 
                         trap. 
                     
                     
                         "I had agents try to sell," said the 
                         woman, getting control of her voice 
                         and again continuing. "They couldn't. 
                         And I must have money. Couldn't you 
                         manage to give me half of what I 
                         paid? If the lot is so valuable, you 
                         would lose nothing by taking it back for 
                         half." 
                     
                     
                         "See here!" gritted out Cobb, jerk- 
                         ing himself to his feet so suddenly that 
                         the woman was startled into greater 
                         timidity. "I'm busy. Given you fif- 
                         teen minutes of valuable time. We 
                         won't buy back your lot--that's final. 
                         Pardon me for not showing you to the 
                         door--it's Saturday, and I've got a big 
                         deal. Keep the lot--hang on to it-- 
                         don't let it get away." He picked up 
                         his memorandum and glared at it. "Oh

                         --good afternoon! Remember my ad- 
                         vice--don't, for any excuse, sell that 
                         lot!" 
                     
                     
                         With a final and incoherent plea, the 
                         school-teacher made a faltering exit, 
                         and somebody closed the door which 
                         led into the private office. As Cobb 
                         turned to his letters, he blurted out an- 
                         grily: 
                     
                     
                         "Hang it all, why can't I get clerks 
                         who will do a real chuck-out? Push- 
                         ins take more time than the snaring 
                         of ten suckers. Somewhere I must dig 
                         up a cast-iron toe swinger." 
                     
                     
                         Cobb's was a sudden success. He 
                         was yet a young man, not married, nor 
                         indeed likely to marry. For him mar- 
                         riage offered nothing in exchange for 
                         the pretended devotion to a plurality of 
                         women except the expected devotion to 
                         only one. He had a not-absorbing in- 
                         terest in fancy womankind of the bur- 
                         lesque variety; beyond that he believed 
                         a man was a fool to go. 
                     
                     
                         Like most American business men, 
                         Cobb could look back to a time, and 
                         that quite recently, when he knew what 
                         it was to think several times before he 
                         spent a half dollar. He had lifted him- 
                         self into his smeary niche by his sole 
                         efforts. 
                     
                     
                         Aside from a taste in lavishness in 
                         apparel, and such other tastes as go 
                         with a liking of the fancy variety of 
                         women, a rough sketch of the fellow 
                         has been daubed. It should be added, 
                         however, that the inspiration for this 
                         brief sketch was supremely selfish. Let 
                         us call Cobb a kind of human jackal. 
                         For years he had prowled successfully 
                         in scenting out carcasses too unsavory 
                         for other jackals, and he never hesi- 
                         tated to make a full meal when he could 
                         find it. Only carcasses is hardly the 
                         correct word. He had been preying 
                         on living things, but like the carcasses, 
                         in the respect that they were unable to 
                         fight away the prowler, and, like the 
                         carcasses, in that the eating was too 
                         rank for many who would have said 
                     
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         of themselves that they were not 
                         squeamish concerning their food. 
                     
                     
                         At three-thirty, behind his mahogany 
                         desk, Cobb got a surprise, a big sur- 
                         prise, and one which almost any man, 
                         jackal or not, would find most unpleas- 
                         ant. Most of us who are blessed 
                         enough to have fathers would be glad 
                         to have them turn up, even if not ex- 
                         pected. Not so Cobb. We cannot 
                         blame him. For the successful--ex- 
                         cuse the word--bogland seller felt that 
                         he was deeply disgraced by his parental 
                         forbear. He should not have felt that 
                         way. Certainly the jackal should not 
                         feel disgraced if a man-eating tiger 
                         happened to be his parent, if that thing 
                         were possible. "Hard-jaw Cobb," as 
                         his pals called him, was a kind of man- 
                         eating tiger. Incidentally, the man- 
                         tiger had quite recently served out a 
                         sentence in the place where all jackals 
                         ought to find themselves. And this 
                         father, whom the son had not even 
                         written to in some ten years, and whom 
                         the son would have walked around the 
                         blocks of a whole city so as not to meet 
                         face to face, had actually sent into the 
                         private office a slip of paper with his 
                         name written upon it, and was said, by 
                         the boy who brought in the slip, to be 
                         waiting outside for an interview. 
                     
                     
                         Jenifer hated his father, but he hated 
                         him not because of any record of fin- 
                         ger prints which police headquarters 
                         might hold, but because he feared him. 
                         It was nothing to Jenifer that for the 
                         years of his boyhood the father had 
                         braved all the dangers of his dread 
                         profession to obtain the means to sup- 
                         port his boy in comfort. Just as it was 
                         nothing to Jenifer that the father had 
                         provided for his son's education, leav- 
                         ing the boy with a woman, said to be a 
                         cousin, and seeing him on rare occa- 
                         sions only. From the moment that 
                         Jenifer knew of the man-eatings, he 
                         continued, it is true, to accept support 
                         and education, but from that moment 
                         the fear had seized him that the elder 
                     
                 
             
             
                 
                 Two--Not of a Kind 33 
                 
                     
                     
                         Cobb would some time make public his 
                         relationship to his son. He never had. 
                         Indeed, for seven years, the time of 
                         his last sentence, he had not even writ- 
                         ten to the younger Cobb. The last 
                         thing that the son expected, and the 
                         greatest evil which he had dreaded was 
                         a visit from his father. 
                     
                     
                         "He's a customer," said Jenifer, 
                         eying suspiciously the boy who had 
                         brought in the message. "Happens to 
                         have my name. Suppose I'll have to 
                         see him. Show him in." 
                     
                     
                         When face to face, the difference be- 
                         tween father and son would have made 
                         an absorbing study for a student of 
                         heredity. Of course, the clothing was 
                         vastly different, proving tastes which 
                         were as opposed as possible. The elder 
                         Cobb's overshort coat and too tight 
                         trousers, of some solid gray material, 
                         were glean and neat, as was his stout 
                         flannel shirt, but this might have been 
                         the holiday attire of a longshoreman 
                         or ironworker. And the blunt, bull- 
                         dog chin and square cheeks, with low 
                         cheek bones, had bequeathed to the son 
                         only a hint of their shape, ironness, 
                         and brutism. 
                     
                     
                         The visitor did not take the seat 
                         which the son offered. 
                     
                     
                         "Suppose we come right down to 
                         brass tacks," said Jenifer. "I didn't 
                         think you'd honor me with a visit. 
                         Came right West, did you? From-- 
                         yes--New York." 
                     
                     
                         "You're on," growled Cobb, senior. 
                     
                     
                         There were some moments of 
                         silence, while the keen eyes of the visi- 
                         tor seemed to take in everything, from 
                         his son's immaculate tweed clothing and 
                         the heavy gold band around the fore- 
                         finger of one white hand, to the ma- 
                         hogany of the room's furnishings. At 
                         length Jenifer ventured: 
                     
                     
                         "Maybe the time has come when you 
                         expect me to pay back a part of-" 
                     
                     
                         "Cut that hand-out stuff!" grunted 
                         the other. "Pay back nothing. I'm 
                         here on biz. Cold biz." 
                     
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         The son had lifted himself to his feet 
                         behind the broad desk. He rested the 
                         white hands on the polished surface. 
                         "I don't get your meaning. Really, as 
                         you must know, there can be no busi- 
                         ness between us. If it is a matter of 
                         money which you feel you ought to 
                         have--to reimburse you-" 
                     
                     
                         The other raised a muscular, red 
                         hand. His face was filled with such 
                         anger that Jenifer's words ended ab- 
                         ruptly. 
                     
                     
                         "It's a story," grunted Cobb, senior, 
                         sternly. "Get me? A story. It's God's 
                         truth. Back in the marshes of Long 
                         Island--you know 'em--you were there 
                         as a boy. Nobody knows 'em better. 
                         Back there, in the tangle, is a lot. You 
                         git wet to your knees wading to the 
                         stakes. I've been there. The nearest 
                         road is miles and miles away. It isn't 
                         good for nothing. It's good just to 
                         raise taxes. It ain't good for raising 
                         nothing but taxes--chickweed wouldn't 
                         grow on it. If you chucked in a ten-

                         a local land man. That's the shape of 
                         the deal you've been setting your smut 
                         fly paper to catch your flies with. That's 
                         the deal as has pushed you that, and 
                         that, and that, and all these!" 
                     
                     
                         The blunt, red forefinger had pointed 
                         in turn to the tweed coat, the spangled 
                         necktie, and the trousers of the man 
                         behind the desk, before the finger 
                         swept a circle which was intended to 
                         include the whole periphery of the son's 
                         life. 
                     
                     
                         "Say!" broke in Cobb, junior. 
                         "Doesn't it make you feel a little funny 
                         to come here and go on the way you've 
                         been spouting--when-" 
                     
                     
                         The other savagely interrupted his 
                         growl. "You mean when I've just 
                         served out a term in the pen--that's 
                         what you mean. Huh! How did I git 
                         the last? You know. Chanced it at 
                         a safe with the dynamite! And a 
                         barker in my clothes! If five bulls 
                         hadn't cornered me, I'd have made a

                         clean get-away. But got it through 
                         both shoulders! In a prison hospital 
                         for three month'. That's a man's game 
                         --a man's game. Get me? Yours! 
                         Huh! Like lifting the near-gold brace- 
                         let of a girl baby what's been left in 
                         your lap by its mother. But I ain't 
                         here to chuck that little piece. That 
                         ain't what brought me. I'm here on 
                         biz!" 
                     
                     
                         "If it isn't money, what is it?" asked 
                         the son. He added : "And suppose we 
                         lock that door, over there. Somebody 
                         might come in. We might be inter- 
                         rupted." 
                     
                     
                         The other's face wrinkled into a smile 
                         that was so like a threat of the most 
                         sinister kind that the son involuntarily 
                         drew himself back. "What do you 
                         think you're up against?" he asked, 
                         pulling the key of the door from his 
                         pocket and slipping it back again. 
                         "When you was waiting for me to close 
                         the door, I locked it. Didn't take a 
                         chance, I didn't. As to why I'm here, 
                         it's the flimsy, but not the sort you 
                         think. As I chucked it, it's a story--a 
                         story of a pal and his skirt. Only she 
                         ain't exactly a skirt--she's straight-- 
                         she's on the level. I'll cut it short. 
                     
                     
                         "Here, I gits out first, and the pal 
                         sends me with a love message to the 
                         girl. She's been slaving and slaving 
                         and slaving--in a box factory. Eight 
                         year--from the time she was seventeen. 
                         Good wages--because she's one of 'em 
                         they speeds up and then speeds up 
                         again so as to rush the others. Big 
                         wages--for a girl. She's been skimping 
                         herself--skimping--skimping. When 
                         he gits out, she's going to have a nice 
                         little flat, all furnished by her lone- 
                         some. That's one bug. The other bug 
                         is that she'll keep him straight. 
                         There's her savings and the pretty flat. 
                         Oh, she's dafty, all right! Then, in a 
                         paper, she sees one of your eye-grab- 
                         bing lies. She takes her little pile--all 
                         her skimpings, and she buys the lot 
                         what I seen and where you couldn't 
                     
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         find bottom with a power oil drill. 
                         That's the story--that is! Isn't it nice? 
                         How does it feel when you sees one of 
                         your flies all stuck up and trying to 
                         make a get-away from your smut fly 
                         paper? How does it feel, I ask? 
                         How?" 
                     
                     
                         "Now, now!" soothed the son, hold- 
                         ing up his hand as if to ward off the 
                         contempt and even fury that had been 
                         condensed into the questions. "Maybe, 
                         in a way, you and I might be said to be 
                         in the same boat--but my deal is legal 
                         --your-" 
                     
                     
                         "Push in your jaw bolts!" blurted 
                         the father. "As you're the skunk, you 
                         couldn't be expected to see the diff. 
                         There is a diff; a diff as big as between 
                         a cellmate and the head warden--bigger 
                         --as wide as twenty oceans. And I've 
                         got it under my skin that I lifted good 
                         money to feed and give schooling to 
                         a skunk. Say, I had hopes--hopes! 
                         But chuck that part. What I'm here 
                         for is to make you take out your check 
                         book from that swell desk and write a 
                         check for the straight skirt. The ad- 
                         vertisement? I've seen it--the girl's 
                         got it. It says that there might be a 
                         one-to-ten shot--that's it--a one-to-ten 
                         shot. Says it so slick that you've got 
                         three ways and the roof, besides, for 
                         a clean get-away--but it says it. Un- 
                         derstand, it says it. You'll take a pen 
                         in that nice, white hand and write a 
                         check that way. It'll be a bookmaker's 
                         swing-in--ten for one. Here's her 
                         name and what she paid into your smut 
                         shell game." He pulled out a bit of 
                         paper from his pocket and, stepping to 
                         the desk, laid it before the son. 
                     
                     
                         "Not on your life," said Jenifer, sur- 
                         prised by the suggestion. He chanced 
                         the sneer. "A holdup by your dear, 
                         paternal relative don't go in this shop. 
                         Not on your necktie pin!" 
                     
                     
                         The iron-hard face of the other hard- 
                         ened even more. With a growl that 
                         was amazingly like the tiger he has 
                         been compared to, he leaped forward. 
                     
                 
             
             
                 
                 Two--Not of a Kind 35 
                 
                     
                     
                         He seized the younger man by the 
                         throat, just above the collar, and, with 
                         experienced fingers, pushed in the 
                         windpipe, so that only a low gurgle told 
                         what the blackening face and starting 
                         eyeballs indicated. Forcing the younger 
                         man to the floor, Cobb pulled out a 
                         great, blue cotton handkerchief from 
                         his pocket with the right hand, while 
                         the other continued to grip savagely the 
                         already congested throat. The hand- 
                         kerchief was wound tightly above the 
                         son's mouth, and securely knotted be- 
                         hind his head. Then Cobb pulled his 
                         man to the chair behind the desk, and 
                         pushed him into it. 
                     
                     
                         "Your check book!" he grunted. 
                         "Pull out your check book. Don't 
                         thrash around, or I'll break your bones 
                         like rotten sticks!" 
                     
                     
                         The son hesitated. Some of the 
                         nerve of the elder must have been 
                         passed down into his blood. But the 
                         savagery of the face near his own 
                         would have subdued most men. He 
                         pulled out a drawer and lifted his check 
                         book before him. 
                     
                     
                         "A check to the skirt for ten times 
                         her gate money into the shell game--the 
                         even hundred above," snarled Cobb. 
                     
                     
                         The check was scrawled, and Cobb, 
                         senior, took it in his red hands. Three 
                         times he read it aloud, as if gloating 
                         over it, and then placed it in his pocket. 
                     
                     
                         "There's no danger you'll chance a 
                         trick," he said. "If you do, I'll make 
                         a come-back. So you won't stop pay- 
                         ment. But I ain't through. Once be- 
                         fore I caught you playing a skunk--you 
                         weren't more than six. I took it out 
                         of your hide. Just as you got it then, 
                         you'll git your medicine now. See! 
                         They may hear it outside, but the walls 
                         and doors are thick." 
                     
                     
                         Cobb, senior, slipped to the coat rack, 
                         which held in its ring a sheaf of um- 
                         brellas and canes. He strode back, with 
                         Jenifer's heavy walking stick in his 
                         hand. 
                     
                     
                         Before the other could have expected 
                     
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         the attack, Cobb seized him by the col- 
                         lar with a grip so powerful that the 
                         collar was torn from the front button 
                         and left the ends projecting upward 
                         around the knotted handkerchief. With 
                         the strength of an athlete of fifty-five, 
                         and muscles of seven years' hardening 
                         at severe prison toil, he began wielding 
                         the heavy stick, blow after blow, until, 
                         as he continued, the tweed coat, from 
                         the shoulders to the hips of the shiver- 
                         ing man, raised itself into ridges, sug- 
                         gesting that the cloth was thus corru- 
                         gated by the flesh below. 
                     
                     
                         With the fury of the blows, the cane 
                         was gradually broken into slivers, the 
                         pieces scattering themselves about the 
                         floor, below the men. The red face of 
                         the castigator turned to purple, and, 
                         as it did, the face of the other grew 
                         distorted and livid, mingled perspira- 
                         tion and tears rolling over the shrunken 
                         cheeks. 
                     
                     
                         With a growl that was more beast- 
                         like than the growls which had been 
                         vented while the blows were falling, the 
                         safe cracker threw the form of his son 
                         into the chair, where it humped itself 
                         inertly, the head dropping forward be- 
                         tween the gripped and quivering hands. 
                     
                     
                         "I'm going now," said Cobb. "Be- 
                         fore Heaven, I give it that I'll never 
                         glimpse you again. Swing your cat's- 
                         paws outside any chuck-out you want. 
                         Say a bughouse did you up. That'll 
                         go. You won't give yourself away as 
                         the son of a crook that wouldn't stand 
                         for your skunk doings--that's sure! 
                         And, take it from a feller who was 
                         pushed the hand-out of being your dad, 
                         a professional cracksman has got more 
                         guts than to lift leathers from a box- 
                         factory skirt, and a clean get-away 
                         handy!" 
                     
                     
                         He stepped to the door, and un- 
                         locked it. 
                     
                     
                         "The boss, in there, has got to have 
                         a doctor," he said to the girl stenog- 
                         rapher, as he passed through the outer 
                         office and into the corridor.

                         CHAPTER I. 
                     
                     
                         SUDDEN ILLNESS. 
                     
                     
                         SMIRKS, sarcastic grins, ingratiat- 
                         ing smiles--these things had 
                         Roger Verbeck endured through- 
                         out the afternoon, until it seemed 
                         to him that his countenance burned con- 
                         tinually because of humiliation, until his 
                         face had set with sternness, and he 
                         greeted friends and mere acquaintances 
                         alike with a cold and distant nod. 
                     
                     
                         The Black Star had done this--that 
                         master criminal who had held the city 
                         at his mercy for six months or more, 
                         who committed crimes notable for their 
                         originality and daring. 
                     
                     
                         It was five days now since the Black 
                         Star's robbery of the diamond vault of 
                         Jones &amp; Co., a robbery in which he had 
                         made Roger Verbeck, his man Muggs, 
                         and Detective Riley objects of ridicule. 
                         In those five days the Black Star had 
                         made no open move, and the three men 
                         who had sworn to capture him waited 
                         for the next blow, hoping that, when it 
                         fell, they would at least find some minor 
                         clew to follow, some half-hidden trail 
                         that would lead them to the quarry. 
                     
                     
                         Verbeck had spent the afternoon in 
                         the business section, purchasing sup- 
                         plies, for he had decided to live in the 
                         old Verbeck house with Muggs and 
                         Detective Riley, while his campaign 
                         against the Black Star was being waged. 
                         Even those who admired him because 
                         of his determination to match wits with 
                     
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         the master criminal, smiled knowingly 
                         when he passed. They had read the 
                         Black Star's letters to the newspapers, 
                         in which he had told how he had hid- 
                         den in Verbeck's own house, while the 
                         police looked for him throughout the 
                         city. 
                     
                     
                         And now, at seven o'clock in the eve- 
                         ning, Roger Verbeck sat at a table in 
                         a corner of a fashionable restaurant, 
                         his back to the room, and tried to enjoy 
                         his dinner. Detective Riley had gone 
                         to police headquarters for a visit. 
                         Muggs was purchasing more supplies, 
                         and was to get his own dinner and meet 
                         Verbeck with the roadster an hour 
                         later. 
                     
                     
                         Enjoyment of the meal seemed an 
                         impossibility. Verbeck knew those in 
                         the restaurant who recognized him were 
                         grinning behind his back. He knew the 
                         public was watching the duel between 
                         himself and the Black Star, ready to 
                         ridicule Verbeck if he lost, and as eager 
                         to applaud him if he won and sent the 
                         master rogue to prison. 
                     
                     
                         The police worked in vain to corral 
                         the master crook and his band. Long 
                         ago the public had begun to regard the 
                         police department as worthless in this 
                         particular affair. Moreover, the feud 
                         between Roger Verbeck, the young mil- 
                         lionaire, and the Black Star, acknowl- 
                         edged clever criminal, was more spec- 
                         tacular. And so Verbeck found him- 
                         self in a corner. To save himself from 
                         humiliation, he must continue his cam- 
                     
                 
             
             
                 
                 Black Star's Subterfuge 37 
                 
                     
                     
                         paign with the help of only Muggs and 
                         Detective Riley until the Black Star 
                         passed through prison doors to begin a 
                         long sentence. 
                     
                     
                         The smirks and grins that Verbeck 
                         had faced this day served only to double 
                         his determination to conquer the Black 
                         Star. It was a game of wits and strat- 
                         egy, for the Black Star abhorred vi- 
                         olence. None knew better than Roger 
                         Verbeck that he had been out-generaled 
                         in the last affair. But failure had in- 
                         creased his caution and cunning. In 
                         their next clash, he felt sure, the Black 
                         Star would find that the mettle of his 
                         foe was better. 
                     
                     
                         Now Verbeck sipped his demitasse, 
                         and in a panel mirror before him ob- 
                         served the approach of the waiter with 
                         a finger bowl. He glanced at his watch 
                         --within fifteen minutes Muggs would 
                         be before the restaurant with the 
                         roadster. They would pick up Riley at 
                         headquarters and hurry to the old Ver- 
                         beck house, to begin their vigil. For 
                         they slept in the daytime for the greater 
                         part, and remained alert at night, ready 
                         to answer an alarm if the Black Star 
                         committed another crime, eager to get 
                         on the scene as soon as possible and try 
                         to pick up the trail. 
                     
                     
                         It was known that the Black Star had 
                         reorganized his band and established a 
                         new headquarters since Roger Verbeck 
                         and Muggs had almost destroyed his 
                         establishment. And from this new 
                         headquarters, Roger Verbeck doubted 
                         not, the master crook would conduct a 
                         campaign of crime that would terrorize 
                         the city. If the new headquarters 
                         could be located- 
                     
                     
                         "Pardon me, sir, are you ill?" 
                     
                     
                         Even as the waiter spoke, Verbeck 
                         realized that his thoughts were becom- 
                         ing confused, his hands were trembling, 
                         and beads of perspiration were stand- 
                         ing on his forehead. His stomach re- 
                         volted. He reached for the glass of 
                         water near him, and it was necessary 
                         for the waiter to guide it to his lips. 
                     
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         "I guess--I-" he stammered. 
                     
                     
                         "Try to stand, sir. There is a small 
                         retiring room directly to your right. If 
                         you wish to go there, sir-" 
                     
                     
                         The waiter aided him to stand even 
                         as he spoke. He guided Verbeck's fal- 
                         tering steps toward the little retiring 
                         room. Half a dozen diners had noted 
                         the occurrence. The head waiter hur- 
                         ried across the room. 
                     
                     
                         "Mr. Verbeck had been taken ill sud- 
                         denly," the waiter said, in a low voice. 
                     
                     
                         Almost instantly the manager was 
                         among them. 
                     
                     
                         "Why, it is Mr. Verbeck!" he gasped. 
                         "Suddenly ill, you say, George? Get a 
                         physician immediately!" 
                     
                     
                         Verbeck was sitting on the divan in 
                         the corner of the room, scarcely able to 
                         keep from toppling over. He felt him- 
                         self growing weaker. His eyes closed, 
                         and he was unable to open them again. 
                         His head fell back. The manager bent 
                         forward and stretched him on the 
                         couch. 
                     
                     
                         Two men appeared in the doorway, 
                         and the manager and head waiter 
                         whirled to face them. 
                     
                     
                         "Pardon me," the first said, "but I 
                         noticed what happened, and thought I 
                         might be of some service. I am a phy- 
                         sician--here is my card." 
                     
                     
                         "Look at this man, then," the man- 
                         ager directed. ''He became suddenly ill 
                         while eating-" 
                     
                     
                         The professional-looking man al- 
                         ready was bending over Roger Ver- 
                         beck. His companion stood to one 
                         side. 
                     
                     
                         "Why, it is Mr. Roger Verbeck!" the 
                         physician exclaimed. "I know him 
                         well, but did not recognize him in the 
                         restaurant--his back was toward us." 
                     
                     
                         "Anything serious?" asked the wor- 
                         ried manager. 
                     
                     
                         "He is subject to these attacks--a pe- 
                         culiar stomach trouble," the physician 
                         explained. "I have treated him many 
                         times. Undoubtedly he ate something 
                         a bit too rich. No--it is not serious.

                         But we must get him home. Have one 
                         of your men call a taxicab, and let it go 
                         into the alley. We can get him through 
                         the hallway and kitchen and into the 
                         cab. I presume you do not wish to 
                         have the other diners disturbed?" 
                     
                     
                         The manager of the restaurant did 
                         not--that was what was worrying him. 
                         He sent a waiter to call the cab. He 
                         watched while the physician mixed a 
                         drop of medicine in water and poured 
                         the mixture down Verbeck's throat. 
                         The manager did not think it peculiar, 
                         in that moment of excitement, that the 
                         physician carried a vial of medicine in 
                         his waistcoat pocket. 
                     
                     
                         "We'll take care of him, sir," the 
                         doctor went on. "This is a friend of 
                         mine who was dining with me. Do not 
                         be alarmed--I assure you, Mr. Verbeck 
                         will be himself again within an hour. 
                         It really is an advertisement for your 
                         place, rather than otherwise--it shows 
                         your food is rich." 
                     
                     
                         The physician chuckled and smiled, 
                         quite like a professional man taking 
                         charge of a situation, and trying to put 
                         every one at ease. The manager felt 
                         grateful. He walked ahead as the phy- 
                         sician and his friend carried Roger Ver- 
                         beck through the narrow rear hallway 
                         and through the kitchen to the back 
                         door. He watched as they put him in 
                         the cab. 
                     
                     
                         "Drive to Mr. Verbeck's residence as 
                         quickly as possible," he heard the phy- 
                         sician order the chauffeur. "You know 
                         where it is--the old Verbeck mansion? 
                         Good!" 
                     
                     
                         Well satisfied, the manager went back 
                         to the dining room, glad that it had not 
                         been any fault of his food that had 
                         made Roger Verbeck ill, glad also that 
                         few of the regular diners had noticed 
                         the incident. 
                     
                     
                         The cab started through the alley, 
                         turned into the first street, and hurried 
                         toward a boulevard close by. 
                     
                     
                         "Easy!" the physician said to his 
                     
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         companion, chuckling as he looked at 
                         the unconscious Verbeck. 
                     
                     
                         The cab sped along the boulevard. 
                         The Verbeck mansion was to the north; 
                         the taxi dashed south. 
                     
                     
                         CHAPTER II. 
                     
                     
                         UNEXPECTED SLEEP. 
                     
                     
                         MUGGS would not have recognized 
                         a pterodactyl had he met one face 
                         to face in the street. Also, he was woe- 
                         fully deficient in theories regarding the 
                         fourth dimension. He had, however, 
                         taken a post-graduate course in the 
                         University of Hard Knocks, where he 
                         had specialized in human nature, and 
                         hence he knew many things his better- 
                         educated brethren did not. 
                     
                     
                         Muggs knew, for instanre, that there 
                         are smiles and smiles, that they may be 
                         read as easily as print, and that, if read 
                         correctly, they tell a man's intentions-- 
                         or a woman's--as openly as spoken 
                         words. 
                     
                     
                         So now, when the stranger smiled at 
                         him again, Muggs analyzed the smile 
                         quickly and efficiently, and noted the 
                         one important thing--that the stranger 
                         smiled with his lips, but not with his 
                         eyes. The eyes were small and gray, 
                         and appeared to glitter venomously. 
                         Either the glitter of those eyes or the 
                         smile on the lips expressed a false- 
                         hood, and Muggs decided it was the 
                         smile that lied. 
                     
                     
                         Muggs was aware, also, that the 
                         stranger had been regarding him in- 
                         tently for ten minutes at least. He had 
                         felt the other's eyes upon him. There 
                         had been a time in Muggs' career when 
                         he had been sensitive enough to feel 
                         immdiately the near presence of a 
                         hostile force, an accomplishment that 
                         often had saved him from prison. 
                         Though now he walked the straight and 
                         narrow path as valet, chauffeur, and 
                         comrade in arms to Roger Verbeck, he 
                         retained a great deal of his old sensi- 
                         tiveness. 
                     
                 
             
             
                 
                 Black Star's Subterfuge 39 
                 
                     
                     
                         Verbeck had told him to eat before 
                         rejoining him, and so Muggs had en- 
                         tered this little restaurant on a side 
                         street and ordered a modest meal. He 
                         had no more than seated himself when 
                         he became aware that he was under 
                         surveillance. 
                     
                     
                         Being a man of broad experience, and 
                         at present engaged with Verbeck and 
                         Detective Riley in matching wits with a 
                         clever crook and his followers, Muggs 
                         used caution. He did not turn his head 
                         quickly to ascertain the identity of the 
                         person whose eyes he felt. He sipped 
                         his coffee and conveyed a generous bite 
                         of pie to his mouth, sat back and wiped 
                         his lips, and, without seeming to look 
                         up, he searched with his eyes a panel 
                         mirror directly before him, in which 
                         was reflected the interior of the little 
                         restaurant. 
                     
                     
                         It was almost the same minute that 
                         Roger Verbeck, in the more fashion- 
                         able restaurant, looked in a mirror and 
                         observed the approach of his waiter 
                         with the finger bowl. 
                     
                     
                         Muggs spotted his man! He of the 
                         glittering eyes sat at a table near the 
                         door and pretended to be eating berries 
                         and cake. He was regarding the back 
                         of Muggs' head intently--and smiling 
                         the lying smile. 
                     
                     
                         "There's one hombre I've never seen 
                         before, to the best of my knowledge and 
                         belief," Muggs told himself, ''yet he 
                         seems to be mighty interested in me. 
                         A man would think he was layin' to 
                         hand me a jolt, the way he acts. It's 
                         up to me to hand out the jolt first!" 
                     
                     
                         Muggs picked up his check and 
                         reached for his hat. As he turned to 
                         walk the length of the restaurant, he 
                         saw that the other man had risen also, 
                         and was hurrying toward the cashier's 
                         cage. Realizing that the stranger was 
                         eager to get outside, either to accost or 
                         trail him, Muggs did some smiling of 
                         his own now; and a wise man could 
                         have read many things in that smile, the 
                         most important being to hurry from the 
                     
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         vicinity of Mr. Muggs as speedily as 
                         possible. 
                     
                     
                         Muggs paid his check and fumbled 
                         over the toothpicks, giving the other 
                         man ample time to establish himself 
                         outside to his satisfaction. Then he 
                         threw back his shoulders, shot out his 
                         lower jaw belligerently, and headed for 
                         the door. 
                     
                     
                         The stranger with the glittering eyes 
                         was standing at the curb, a short 
                         distance away, just at the rear of a taxi- 
                         cab, and looking up and down the street 
                         as if awaiting an automobile. Muggs 
                         walked straight toward him. 
                     
                     
                         "Pardon me, but are you an artist?" 
                         Muggs demanded, in a peculiar tone. 
                     
                     
                         "I am not. Why do you ask, sir?" 
                     
                     
                         They faced each other squarely. The 
                         stranger was well aware now that 
                         Muggs knew of the recent espionage, 
                         and was about to demand an explana- 
                         tion; and Muggs knew he was aware 
                         of it. 
                     
                     
                         "You ain't lookin' for a model of a 
                         perfect male human head?" Muggs 
                         asked now. 
                     
                     
                         "I am not, sir." 
                     
                     
                         "I thought maybe you was, stranger. 
                         The way you bored them eyes of yours 
                         into my head back there in the restau- 
                         rant, I not only suspicioned you was 
                         lookin' for a model, but that you'd 
                         found your man." 
                     
                     
                         "I--I beg your pardon!" The other 
                         simulated astonishment. 
                     
                     
                         "Yeh? Do I infer from that, 
                         stranger, that you ain't found your 
                         man? If for any particular reason you 
                         was lookin' for me, I'm here with my 
                         pedigree. My name's Muggs. I've got 
                         one peculiarity, and that is, that when I 
                         find a stranger regardin' me too close I 
                         always want to plant a fist 'tween his 
                         eyes. Ain't that funny?" 
                     
                     
                         "Really, I-" 
                     
                     
                         "And just now," Muggs went on, 
                         "I'm engaged in a simple endeavor on 
                         the side, as my boss would say, that 
                         makes me nervous when a man gets

                         pesty around me. I'm that nervous 
                         right now I could choke a man!" 
                     
                     
                         "I--er--I fail to see-" the other 
                         stammered; and he started to walk 
                         slowly along the curb, Muggs following. 
                     
                     
                         "It ain't polite to stare at the back 
                         of a man's head and grin sickly like at 
                         the same time," Muggs continued. 
                         "There wasn't anybody near me in 
                         there, and so you was lookin' at me. I 
                         want to know why! Now suppose you 
                         give me your pedigree, so we'll know 
                         just where we stand!" 
                     
                     
                         They were opposite the taxicab now, 
                         and the chauffeur sprang from his seat 
                         and opened the door as if in anticipation 
                         of a fare. It appeared to Muggs that 
                         the other man would be only too glad to 
                         jump into that taxi and hurry away 
                         without explaining; and Muggs did not 
                         wish that. While the war against the 
                         Black Star and his band was in prog- 
                         ress, explanations of any peculiar cir- 
                         cumstance were necessary. 
                     
                     
                         So now Muggs stepped before the 
                         open door of the cab himself, blocking 
                         the way, and faced the man who had 
                         smiled. 
                     
                     
                         "I'm waitin' for an answer!" Muggs 
                         declared. 
                     
                     
                         The stranger bent forward in the 
                         gathering dusk and raised a forefinger, 
                         as if to begin a protest of this conduct 
                         on Muggs' part. The chauffeur stood 
                         with his hand on the door, waiting. 
                     
                     
                         "It seems to me-" the stranger 
                         began. 
                     
                     
                         And in that second, Muggs realized 
                         that he had walked right into a trap. 
                         The chauffeur grasped him by the 
                         throat and kicked his feet from beneath 
                         him. The stranger he faced lunged 
                         forward suddenly and threw Muggs off 
                         his balance. Muggs was hurled to the 
                         interior of the cab neatly; and only one 
                         person on the street had witnessed the 
                         occurrence. 
                     
                     
                         Like a flash, Muggs had his feet un- 
                         der him again and was crouched against 
                         the seat, ready to spring through the 
                     
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         door and throttle the first of his foes 
                         he met. It flashed through his mind 
                         that he should blame himself much for 
                         being caught off guard. And then, be- 
                         fore he scarcely realized what was hap- 
                         pening, before he could make a move, 
                         the man who had watched him in the 
                         restaurant had entered the cab and 
                         closed the door, and the vehicle was 
                         moving away from the curb. 
                     
                     
                         "Easy! Easy, my man!" the stranger 
                         warned. 
                     
                     
                         The cab passed beneath the arc light 
                         at the corner just then, and Muggs saw 
                         steel glitter in the other's hand. It was 
                         not the nature of Muggs, however, to 
                         allow himself to be captured in this 
                         manner without making some effort to 
                         disconcert his captors. Moreover, he 
                         guessed this man and the chauffeur 
                         might belong to the Black Star's band. 
                         This might be part of a prearranged 
                         plan to injure Roger Verbeck in some 
                         way. And all that was necessary to 
                         arouse Muggs' ire and fighting blood 
                         was to threaten disaster to Verbeck, 
                         the man he adored, who had saved him 
                         from the waters of the Seine five years 
                         before and made him a man. 
                     
                     
                         It took Muggs less than half a sec- 
                         ond to get his breath and decide that 
                         the proper thing to do would be to 
                         spring upon the other man and make an 
                         effort to overcome him, taking the 
                         chance of receiving a bullet in his vitals. 
                     
                     
                         Muggs sprang like a lion, and 
                         silently! 
                     
                     
                         In midair he met something new. 
                         The other had raised what Muggs had 
                         supposed was an automatic pistol fitted 
                         with a silencer. Now he pulled the 
                         trigger! 
                     
                     
                         No hot lead seared Muggs, no bullet 
                         tore its way through his body. But, 
                         from the muzzle of the weapon flashed 
                         a cloud of pungent vapor, and Muggs, 
                         gasping his surprise, drew the vapor 
                         deep into his lungs. 
                     
                     
                         The stranger caught Muggs in his 
                         arms and lowered him gently to the 
                     
                 
             
             
                 
                 Black Star's Subterfuge 41 
                 
                     
                     
                         floor of the taxi. It seemed to Muggs 
                         that he realized fully what was going 
                         on, but was unable to do anything 
                         about it. He noticed the other man 
                         take a handkerchief from his pocket 
                         and hold it to his nostrils, and above 
                         the handkerchief the eyes glittered 
                         venomously as before. Muggs saw all 
                         this as they passed under another arc 
                         light. 
                     
                     
                         And then dreamless sleep descended 
                         upon him! 
                     
                     
                         CHAPTER III. 
                     
                     
                         THE NEW HEADQUARTERS. 
                     
                     
                         MUGGS regained his cunning the in- 
                         stant he regained consciousness. 
                         He realized he was stretched on a 
                         couch, and that his hands and feet were 
                         bound. He made no effort to struggle, 
                         and he did not even open his eyes. 
                     
                     
                         For fully a minute he lay motionless, 
                         almost without breathing, his ears 
                         strained to catch every sound. Once, 
                         coming from a distance, he heard the 
                         clanging bell of a trolley car. The 
                         rattling of vehicles on a busy paved 
                         street, the moaning of the wind that 
                         had been blowing a gale at the time of 
                         his abduction, the low-pitched voices of 
                         men in the room, discussing his case-- 
                         the things he expected to hear--were 
                         not discernible. 
                     
                     
                         Still he did not open his eyes, hoping 
                         that, if anybody was in the room, they 
                         would speak sooner or later and give 
                         him some clew to his predicament. He 
                         was breathing deeply and regularly 
                         now, his brain had cleared, and he knew 
                         the effect of the vapor he had inhaled 
                         had worn away. And then- 
                     
                     
                         "Why play 'possum, Mr. Muggs? 
                         You have been conscious, and your 
                         brain has been active, for the better 
                         part of five minutes, and I know it!" 
                     
                     
                         The voice was low, deep, striking-- 
                         the words coming in a peculiar staccato. 
                         Muggs remembered that the Black Star 
                     
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         possessed a voice like that. He opened 
                         his eyes. 
                     
                     
                         "That is better. Why pretend?" 
                     
                     
                         Opening his eyes was all Muggs did, 
                         save gasp, for he did not have to move 
                         his body to observe the scene. It was 
                         spread before him. 
                     
                     
                         He was on a couch in a corner of a 
                         large room. The apartment was lav- 
                         ishingly furnished; mahogany table and 
                         chairs, tapestries, art rugs were there 
                         to delight the eye. 
                     
                     
                         At one end of the table stood a tall 
                         figure enveloped in a flowing black 
                         robe with a hood that covered the head. 
                         The face was hidden by a black mask 
                         through which two eyes glittered. On 
                         the front of the hood, in flaming jet, 
                         was a big star. 
                     
                     
                         "The Black Star!" Muggs gasped, 
                         scarcely knowing why he spoke at all, 
                         since it seemed so useless. 
                     
                     
                         "You have guessed correctly, 
                         Muggs," the Black Star said, chuckling. 
                         "Once again you see the Black Star in 
                         his headquarters, his workshop. Be- 
                         fore, you visited me like a thief in the 
                         night, accompanied by Roger Verbeck, 
                         the man you style your boss. This time, 
                         I have had you brought here." 
                     
                     
                         The Black Star folded his arms and 
                         looked at the man on the couch, as if 
                         speculating what to do with him. 
                         Muggs remained silent, waiting, his 
                         brain busy with a thousand thoughts. 
                         He knew now that it was a member of 
                         the Black Star's band who had watched 
                         him in the restaurant, and that the 
                         chauffeur had been another. And why 
                         had he been abducted and carried to the 
                         master criminal's headquarters? Did 
                         the Black Star think he could hold 
                         Muggs as hostage and force Roger Ver- 
                         beck to cease his campaign to put the 
                         master rogue behind the bars? 
                     
                     
                         "Really, Mr. Muggs, I had hoped for 
                         something better from you," the Black 
                         Star was saying. "When I gave orders 
                         for you to be abducted and carried here.. 
                         I laughed to myself--I believed the men

                         who received those orders would have 
                         their hands full. It appears, however, 
                         that the task was as easy as picking up 
                         a child." 
                     
                     
                         'Yeh?" Muggs snarled. 
                     
                     
                         "I knew, you see, that you would be 
                         in the business district to-day, since 
                         Roger Verbeck was purchasing supplies 
                         --stocking up the old Verbeck house 
                         well, to be comfortable with you and 
                         Detective Riley while conducting his 
                         campaign to capture me-" 
                     
                     
                         "And you can bet he'll get you yet!" 
                         Muggs loyally exclaimed. 
                     
                     
                         "Do you really think so, Muggs? 
                         However, I have you now!" 
                     
                     
                         "Well, what's it to be--goin' to shoot 
                         me, or what?" 
                     
                     
                         "My dear Muggs! I abhor violence! 
                         I am not a thug. Wit, strategy, the 
                         game of brains--those are the things! 
                         My purpose in bringing you here was 
                         not ulterior." 
                     
                     
                         "Talk United States and get it off 
                         your chest, quick!" Muggs said. 
                     
                     
                         "Such language! I cannot, for the 
                         life of me, understand why a refined 
                         gentleman like Roger Verbeck endures 
                         your companionship. By having you 
                         carried here, I believed I was doing Mr. 
                         Verbeck a favor." 
                     
                     
                         "Yeh?" 
                     
                     
                         "He matched his wit against mine, 
                         and almost destroyed my organization 
                         once. I escaped the silly police, how- 
                         ever, and formed my organization 
                         anew, also obtained a new headquarters. 
                         Has it not been the desire of yourself, 
                         Mr. Verbeck and Detective Riley--the 
                         trio sworn to capture me--to discover 
                         the whereabouts of this new headquar- 
                         ters? Well--here it is, Muggs." 
                     
                     
                         "I can see the headquarters, all 
                         right!" 
                     
                     
                         "And please observe the heavy cur- 
                         tain on that side of the room. It cov- 
                         ers an open doorway, Muggs. I am 
                         going to lift that curtain now and give 
                         you a shock. Yes, Muggs, I feel sure 
                         it will be quite a shock." 
                     
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         The Black Star walked slowly across 
                         the room to the curtain, turned and 
                         looked at Muggs again, then swiftly 
                         threw the curtain back. With an ex- 
                         clamation, Muggs struggled to get to his 
                         feet. In the doorway, sitting bound in 
                         a chair, his hands fastened before him 
                         --was Roger Verbeck. A handkerchief 
                         gagged him. 
                     
                     
                         "You--you got the boss!" Muggs 
                         cried. "You-" 
                     
                     
                         "Oh, yes! It proved as easy to cap- 
                         ture Roger Verbeck as it did to get 
                         you, Muggs, so do not feel too much 
                         grieved that you were taken by my men. 
                         I merely wanted to make sure of the 
                         capture of one of you, to show you the 
                         new headquarters, but my men were so 
                         successful they caught two of you. 
                         Match wits with the Black Star and his 
                         band? You poor fools!" 
                     
                     
                         "You--you-" Muggs sputtered in 
                         sudden wrath at seeing his beloved 
                         master in such an extremity. Rage 
                         gathered within him, and he twisted at 
                         wrists and ankles in a futile effort to 
                         get free. The Black Star stepped for- 
                         ward and pushed against Muggs' breast, 
                         and Muggs was toppled over on the 
                         couch. 
                     
                     
                         "Take it easy, Muggs," the Black 
                         Star advised. "I have no intention of 
                         harming Mr. Verbeck, nor yourself. I 
                         merely intend keeping both of you here 
                         for a short time, letting you witness 
                         anything that may transpire, and then 
                         you'll be allowed to go. Understand?" 
                     
                     
                         Muggs growled and looked at the 
                         floor. Verbeck felt suddenly elated. 
                         It would be like the Black Star to take 
                         such a chance. He could crow about it 
                         afterward--write letters to the papers, 
                         and say he had abducted Roger Ver- 
                         beck and Muggs, and revealed the new 
                         headquarters to them, yet could not be 
                         located and captured. And it was pos- 
                         sible, Verbeck thought, that he might 
                         observe or hear something that would 
                         give him a clew to the location of the 
                         place. He doubted not, that when he 
                     
                 
             
             
                 
                 Black Star's Subterfuge 43 
                 
                     
                     
                         and Muggs were sent away again, they 
                         would go unconscious, as they had 
                         come. 
                     
                     
                         "This headquarters is a great im- 
                         provement over the old one," the Black 
                         Star said. "I really ought to thank 
                         you, Mr. Verbeck, for driving me out 
                         of the other. Allow me, Mr. Verbeck, 
                         to remove the gag." 
                     
                     
                         He went forward and removed it, and 
                         unlashed Verbeck from the chair. 
                         Then he helped him hop across the 
                         room and caused him to sit down beside 
                         Muggs. 
                     
                     
                         "That is much better," he said. "I 
                         may mention that it will do you no 
                         good to shriek or screech or howl for 
                         assistance. The place we are in- 
                         Ah!" 
                     
                     
                         A bell had tinkled. Muggs strug- 
                         gled and managed to sit up on the 
                         couch beside Verbeck. Both of them 
                         remembered about that other head- 
                         quarters. There bells had tinkled, and 
                         members of the Black Star's band of 
                         criminals had entered to make reports 
                         or receive orders. Gowns and masks-- 
                         and conversations carried out on black- 
                         boards. Yes--there were the black- 
                         boards! 
                     
                     
                         "A friend is coming, gentlemen," the 
                         Black Star said. "I request that you 
                         remain on the couch and keep silent. 
                         You cannot tell what may happen if 
                         you try to leave the couch." 
                     
                     
                         The Black Star chuckled and disap- 
                         peared through a small door. Again a 
                         bell tinkled. Another door, on the op- 
                         posite side of the room, opened, and 
                         there entered another man clad in black 
                         robe and mask, save that no star of jet 
                         flamed on the hood of the robe. 
                     
                     
                         He started forward in surprise 
                         when he observed Muggs seated upon 
                         the couch beside Verbeck, but checked 
                         himself and did not speak. Neither did 
                         Verbeck speak, for he was busy spec- 
                         ulating as to the newcomer's height and 
                         weight, watching every movement he 
                         made, trying to fasten upon something 
                     
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         that would enable him to recognize the 
                         man if they met again elsewhere. 
                         Muggs, however, refused to remain 
                         silent. 
                     
                     
                         "Good evening," he said. "The boss 
                         is out just now. Anything I can do 
                         for you? Got a few diamonds or any- 
                         thing like that you've pinched to-day?'' 
                     
                     
                         The smaller door opened and the 
                         Black Star entered the room. He went 
                         immediately to one of the little black- 
                         boards on the wall, picked up a piece of 
                         chalk, and wrote quickly: 
                     
                     
                         "Muggs! Silence, as I instructed, 
                         or--" 
                     
                     
                         Then he turned and exhibited to 
                         Muggs a weapon. Verbeck supposed it 
                         to be an ordinary revolver, but Muggs, 
                         who had passed through an experience 
                         that evening, guessed that it held no bul- 
                         lets, but the pungent vapor that had 
                         caused his downfall in the taxicab. 
                         Muggs became silent. He did not wish 
                         to be put to sleep while Roger Verbeck 
                         was there and might soon need help. 
                     
                     
                         The Black Star motioned his man 
                         to the second blackboard. 
                     
                     
                         "No. 7," the man wrote. 
                     
                     
                         "Countersign ?" the Black Star de- 
                         manded on his board. 
                     
                     
                         "Georgia." 
                     
                     
                         "Report." 
                     
                     
                         The other turned his back and wrote 
                         rapidly and at length. Muggs and Ver- 
                         beck bent forward on the couch and 
                         peered across the room. Was it pos- 
                         sible, Verbeck wondered, that the Black 
                         Star was going to allow them to read 
                         the blackboard conversation, and then 
                         let them go back to the Verbeck house 
                         with whatever information they had ac- 
                         quired? 
                     
                     
                         The message was done; the man 
                         stepped back. Verbeck and Muggs read 
                         what he had written as the Black Star 
                         read it: 
                     
                     
                         "Our man goes on duty to-night. 
                         Burglar alarms have been fixed. At

                         The Black Star motioned for him to 
                         erase, then wrote himself: 
                     
                     
                         "What about the gold?" 
                     
                     
                         ''Gold received to-day at noon; 
                         moved in quickly and secretly. Hun-

                         ping it on, part at time." 
                     
                     
                         When Verbeck read that he had dif- 
                         ficulty in adhering to his determination 
                         to betray no astonishment. Was it 
                         possible the master criminal and his 
                         band contemplated the theft of a hun- 
                         dred thousand dollars in gold coin ? 
                         And they were discussing it here be- 
                         fore him and Muggs as if they had been 
                         discussing the state of the weather! 
                     
                     
                         "Arrangements for moving per- 
                         fected?" the Black Star wrote now. 
                     
                     
                         "Everything in readinecs; cannot 
                         fail," the other answered with the 
                         chalk. "Two closed autos. Six of us 
                         to handle coin. Garbage wagon will 
                         block one end of alley; we will guard 
                         other end." 
                     
                     
                         Verbeck was getting the details 
                         swiftly now, and an exchange of 
                         glances with Muggs showed that the 
                         latter also was letting every word writ- 
                         ten on the blackboard beat into his 
                         brain, and making a special effort to 
                         remember. They were going to move a 
                         fortune in gold in two closed autos. 
                         One end of the alley would be blocked 
                         and the other guarded. Of all the 
                         nerve- 
                     
                     
                         "Good!" the Black Star was writing 
                         now. "Let it be to-night at the time 
                         agreed." 
                     
                     
                         Why, Verbeck even knew the time! 
                         Two o'clock in the morning, when the 
                         policeman on the beat would either be 
                         drinking coffee in a restaurant, else at- 
                         tracted by a fake fight! 
                     
                     
                         All Verbeck had to do now, if al- 
                         lowed to go, or if he escaped in time, 
                     
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         was to get word to Detective Riley and 
                         to police headquarters, have the chief 
                         ascertain what bank or trust company 
                         had a hundred thousand in gold re- 
                         ceived that day, place police around the 
                         building, frustrate the Black Star's plan, 
                         and possibly capture the master crook 
                         or some of his band! Moreover, there 
                         was a chance- 
                     
                     
                         But the Black Star was writing 
                         again : 
                     
                     
                         "Observe men on couch. One near- 
                         est you is Verbeck--other his man,

                         "O. K.," the other wrote. 
                     
                     
                         The Black Star nodded and waved 
                         his hand in a gesture of dismissal. The 
                         other bowed and backed through the 
                         door. A minute of silence, then the 
                         tinkling of the bell! 
                     
                     
                         "Ah; he has gone!" the Black Star 
                         spoke. "You see, Mr. Verbeck, I have 
                         the same arrangement as before. I 
                         never see the faces of these men of 
                         mine, and they never get a glance at me. 
                         We do not hear each other's voices. I 
                         gather information, plan the work, di-

                         who work together at my bidding. But 
                         they could not testify against me, nor I 
                         against them, in case of capture. You 
                         see?" 
                     
                     
                         "Yeh?" Muggs cried. "How about 
                         the eight we caught before? They saw 
                         your face, all right!" 
                     
                     
                         "My dear Muggs ! They were bailed 
                         out, were they not? And they have 
                         left the country, supplied with ample 
                         funds, you may be sure. The men 
                         working with me now are those who 
                         were not caught and did not see my 
                         face--and some new ones my partner 
                         procured." 
                     
                     
                         "You mean to stand there and tell 
                         us," Verbeck said, "that you are going 
                         to steal a hundred thousand in gold 
                         coin to-night?" 
                     
                     
                         "At precisely two o'clock in the 
                         morning, Mr. Verbeck." 
                     
                 
             
             
                 
                 The Black Star's Subterfuge 45 
                 
                     
                     
                         "You can't get away with it!" Muggs 
                         exclaimed. 
                     
                     
                         "No? Did I not get away with a 
                         choice collection of diamonds from the 
                         vault of Jones &amp; Co., while you and 
                         Verbeck and Detective Riley looked 
                         on?" 
                     
                     
                         "Yeh? Well, you'll go too far one 
                         of these days! We'll get you, and we'll 
                         get you good! And when we do--good 
                         night! You'll get more than life!" 
                     
                     
                         "Meaning death, Muggs? When the 
                         time comes, my man, I'll know how to 
                         die, even if I have to descend to sui- 
                         cide!" 
                     
                     
                         The Black Star turned and paced 
                         the length of the room. Verbeck 
                         leaned back against the cushions on 
                         the couch, and wondered what the 
                         Black Star intended doing next. He 
                         was willing to let Muggs do the talking, 
                         while he strained his ears for some 
                         sound, and his eyes for some sight, that 
                         would reveal to him the location of 
                         the building in which they found them- 
                         selves. He knew the Black Star never 
                         would let him and Muggs leave the 
                         place while conscious. Not having 
                         knowledge of the vapor gun, Verbeck 
                         found himself wondering just how his 
                         unconsciousness was to be brought 
                         about. 
                     
                     
                         Regarding his own capture, he 
                         guessed simply that one of the Black 
                         Star's gang was employed in the 
                         restaurant. Undoubtedly some opiate 
                         had been in his coffee. It might have 
                         been placed there by a kitchen em- 
                         ploye, or by the waiter. He imagined 
                         the rest--that members of the Black 
                         Star's band had pretended to help him 
                         home, and had taken him to the master 
                         crook's headquarters instead. 
                     
                     
                         "Well," Muggs exclaimed, "I sup- 
                         pose you're goin' to keep us tied up 
                         here like a couple of bundles of rags 
                         until you pull off this stunt to-night, 
                         eh? That'll be nice!" 
                     
                     
                         "My dear Muggs! I merely wanted 
                         you and Mr. Verbeck to see my new 
                     
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         headquarters. Presently, I am going to 
                         have you taken from here and dropped 
                         on some corner near the Verbeck house. 
                         I am--really." 
                     
                     
                         "I got a picture of you doin' that, 
                         after us seein' all this-" 
                     
                     
                         "Only, of course, my dear Muggs, 
                         I could not allow you to get a full view 
                         of your surroundings. You gentlemen 
                         have seen the inside of this room, and 
                         that is all--and this room might be in 
                         the basement of a factory or the top 
                         floor of a hotel for all you know. And 
                         when you leave, it must be as you ar- 
                         rived--unconscious. Understand?" 
                     
                     
                         Neither Verbeck nor Muggs replied 
                         to that. It was what Verbeck had ex- 
                         pected. They would see the interior 
                         of this room, but not the exterior of 
                         the building. They would regain con- 
                         sciousness again near home. And how 
                         could they find the spot again? Why, 
                         this room might be in any one of ten 
                         thousand buildings in the city! 
                     
                     
                         The bell tinkled again. A short wait, 
                         and a gowned and masked man entered. 
                     
                     
                         "No. 10," he wrote on the black- 
                         board. 
                     
                     
                         "Countersign ?" 
                     
                     
                         "Jackson." 
                     
                     
                         "Good. You are on time," the Black 
                         Star wrote. "You will take these men 
                         and drop them within a block or two 
                         of the Verbeck place. They must 
                         leave this room as they entered it--un- 
                         conscious." 
                     
                     
                         "O. K.," the other wrote. 
                     
                     
                         He turned from the blackboard. 
                         The Black Star, his eyes glittering 
                         malevolently through his mask, took a 
                         step forward. Muggs struggled to his 
                         feet before Verbeck could make a 
                         move. 
                     
                     
                         "You squirt that stuff at me 
                         again-" he threatened. 
                     
                     
                         The Black Star chuckled as if 
                         greatly amused. The other man's hand 
                         came into view, and it held the vapor 
                         gun. He stepped swiftly toward the 
                     
                 
             
             
                 
                 46 Detective Story Magazine 
                 
                     
                     
                         crouching, defiant Muggs, as Verbeck 
                         struggled to stand. 
                     
                     
                         "You dare squirt that-" Muggs 
                         started to threaten again. 
                     
                     
                         Slowly the weapon in the hand of the 
                         gowned and masked man was raised-- 
                         up and up, until the muzzle covered 
                         Muggs' heart! Then, suddenly, the 
                         man who menaced Muggs whirled and 
                         faced the Black Star, and the weapon 
                         he held was turned against the master 
                         crook. 
                     
                     
                         "Hands up--you !" he cried; and tore 
                         the mask from his face. 
                     
                     
                         Verbeck and Muggs gave cries of 
                         relief and joy. Here was no member 
                         of the Black Star's organization. 
                     
                     
                         Detective Riley stood before them! 
                     
                     
                         CHAPTER IV. 
                     
                     
                         WHAT RILEY DID. 
                     
                     
                         HIS visit to police headquarters that 
                         afternoon had proved highly un- 
                         pleasant for Detective Riley. It was 
                         his first appearance there since the 
                         chief had assigned him to live with 
                         Roger Verbeck and aid him in getting a 
                         clew to the Black Star's whereabouts. 
                         Since he had joined forces with Ver- 
                         beck, Riley had come in for sarcastic 
                         sentences in the Black Star's letters to 
                         the newspapers; and his comrades at 
                         headquarters were not slow to torment 
                         him when he appeared that afternoon. 
                     
                     
                         Riley had intended remaining at 
                         headquarters until Verbeck picked him 
                         up in the roadster about eight o'clock. 
                         His tormentors drove him away at five. 
                     
                     
                         He walked slowly up the avenue, got 
                         something to eat at his favorite chop 
                         house, and then continued his prom- 
                         enade. He knew where Verbeck 
                         would dine, and intended to be in front 
                         of the cafe waiting beside the roadster 
                         with Muggs when Verbeck emerged. 
                     
                     
                         Acquaintances stopped him fre- 
                         quently to discuss the Black Star and 
                         his latest exploit. It was almost seven 
                     
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         o'clock when Riley swung into a side 
                         street to hurry toward the cafe, and at 
                         the curb in the distance he saw Ver- 
                         beck's big roadster. 
                     
                     
                         Muggs, then, must be in the near 
                         vicinity, he knew. He quickened his 
                         stride. And then he saw Muggs--saw 
                         him standing before the open door of 
                         a taxicab, evidently in argument with 
                         a tall individual who bent forward and 
                         shook a forefinger under Muggs' nose. 
                         And then- 
                     
                     
                         Detective Riley scarcely could be- 
                         lieve his eyes. Experience had taught 
                         him, however, to act first and analyze 
                         things afterward. Just as he saw 
                         Muggs hurled backward into the taxi- 
                         cab, Riley sprinted forward. He was 
                         still some fifty feet away when the 
                         chauffeur of the cab sent his machine 
                         dashing down the street. 
                     
                     
                         Detective Riley did not shout a com- 
                         mand to stop, nor draw a weapon and 
                         fire into the air. He was too wise for 
                         that. It was evident to him that Muggs 
                         was being abducted. The fact that 
                         there was no commotion in the cab, 
                         that a door was not thrown open, and 
                         either Muggs or his abductor hurled 
                         to the pavement, convinced Riley that 
                         Muggs had met with foul play the in- 
                         stant his abductor had followed him 
                         into the cab. Who would annoy 
                         Muggs, assault him, abduct him? No- 
                         body, Riley decided, except persons 
                         allied with the Black Star. Where 
                         were they taking Muggs? That, Riley 
                         determined to discover. 
                     
                     
                         There was Verbeck's roadster at the 
                         curb--one of the most powerful cars 
                         in the city--and Detective Riley had 
                         operated it before. Now he ran for- 
                         ward and sprang into the seat, and an 
                         instant later was making his way down 
                         the boulevard, one eye on the street 
                         before him, and the other on the taxi- 
                         cab in the distance. 
                     
                     
                         A traffic officer, recognizing him and 
                         noting the look on the detective's face, 
                         hurried him across a busy cross street, 
                     
                 
             
             
                 
                 Black Star's Subterfuge 47 
                 
                     
                     
                         and Riley sped on. He had gained 
                         considerably on the taxicab ahead; he 
                         did not try to gain more, but kept his 
                         distance. Riley was aware that mem- 
                         bers of the Black Star's band were 
                         familiar with the appearance of Ver- 
                         beck's roadster, and did not care to 
                         follow the taxicab close enough to make 
                         its chauffeur suspicious. The sixth 
                         sense that all good police officers pos- 
                         sess told Riley to trail that other car, 
                         to discover where Muggs was being 
                         taken, and why. 
                     
                     
                         After a time, the taxi left the broad 
                         boulevard, went into a side street, and 
                         turned toward the manufacturing dis- 
                         trict. Here there was less traffic, and 
                         Riley dropped behind, knowing he 
                         could speed up and overhaul the other 
                         car if it turned aside. 
                     
                     
                         Over rough streets, paved with cob- 
                         blestones, through muddy alleys, the 
                         cab led the way. Riley was using great 
                         caution now, never sounding his horn, 
                         dropping behind as long as he could 
                         see the tail light on the car, speeding 
                         up whenever it made a turning. 
                     
                     
                         Now they were down near the river, 
                         where the street lights were placed far 
                         apart, a district teeming with life and 
                         industry in the daytime, but almost 
                         deserted after nightfall. Here were 
                         the city's smaller manufacturing plants, 
                         where old factories and abandoned 
                         buildings scattered among the ones 
                         where machinery hummed during the 
                         day. 
                     
                     
                         The taxi made another turning, and 
                         again Riley raced the roadster forward 
                         to the corner, the powerful engine 
                         making scarcely a sound. As he ap- 
                         proached the corner, he slowed down; 
                         when he reached it, he saw that the 
                         taxicab had stopped at the curb half a 
                         block away. 
                     
                     
                         Riley drove the roadster across the 
                         street, sprang out, and hurried back to 
                         the corner. There was scarcely any 
                         light on this block, yet enough for him 
                         to make out that two men were carry- 
                     
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         ing a third between them from the taxi 
                         and through a gate in a factory fence. 
                     
                     
                         The semidarkness was kind to Riley. 
                         He slipped from shadow to shadow, 
                         came to the fence, and hurried along 
                         it, careful to make no noise. At the 
                         gate he stopped to peer around the 
                         post. The two men were carrying 
                         Muggs through a little door in the side 
                         of an abandoned factory building. 
                     
                     
                         Riley waited until they had disap- 
                         peared, then hurried across the in- 
                         closure, reaching the corner of the 
                         building just in time to escape being 
                         seen by the chauffeur as he emerged. 
                         The chauffeur hurried out to the car, 
                         and Riley let him go. To attack the 
                         man might mean that he would fail to 
                         subdue him, that an alarm would be 
                         given, and all chance to investigate this 
                         affair further be lost. 
                     
                     
                         Riley slipped in through the door 
                         and found himself in a narrow, dark 
                         hallway. He heard no sound. He fol- 
                         lowed the hall for some distance, until 
                         he came to a flight of steps. Down 
                         these he hurried, and into another hall. 
                         He came to a door beneath which light 
                         showed. To the right of the door was 
                         another flight of steps that led upward, 
                         and there was an open door at the top. 
                     
                     
                         Riley listened for some time, and 
                         heard no conversation. He hurried up 
                         the steps and through the door, to find 
                         himself in a dusty room, half filled with 
                         rusty machinery. Light came through 
                         the floor. Riley knelt on the dusty 
                         boards and peered through a tiny crack. 
                     
                     
                         He gasped at what he saw. Muggs 
                         was stretched on a couch in a corner. 
                         Before a blackboard stood the Black 
                         Star; before another blackboard was 
                         the gowned and masked figure of 
                         Muggs' abductor. The Black Star was 
                         writing: 
                     
                     
                         "Understand? Return in hour and 
                         half with taxi to take this man and the 
                         other away again. They must be put to 
                         sleep first, of course." 
                     
                     
                         The other man nodded and backed 
                     
                 
             
             
                 
                 48 Detective Story Magazine 
                 
                     
                     
                         through a door. Detective Riley made 
                         no effort to descend the steps and catch 
                         him in the lower hall. Before his eyes 
                         was the Black Star, the big quarry-- 
                         and the other man was to return in an 
                         hour and a half. 
                     
                     
                         Neither did Riley hurry below and 
                         make an effort to capture the master 
                         criminal in his lair. He determined to 
                         watch developments. He did not know 
                         what a few minutes might bring forth. 
                         Important clews that would lead to the 
                         capture of members of the Black Star's 
                         band might be forthcoming. And it 
                         appeared that there was no danger at 
                         present of Muggs being made the vic- 
                         tim of violence, since the abductor was 
                         to return and remove him. Also, the 
                         Black Star had spoken of another man. 
                     
                     
                         With his eyes glued to the crack in 
                         the floor, Riley waited breathlessly, an 
                         interested spectator of what transpired. 
                         The Black Star spent some minutes 
                         walking back and forth across the 
                         room, now and then chuckling as he 
                         looked at the unconscious Muggs. 
                         Then he spoke--and Muggs showed 
                         that he had regained consciousness. 
                     
                     
                         From then until the Black Star 
                         raised the curtain and showed Roger 
                         Verbeck gagged and lashed to a chair, 
                         Detective Riley lost not a word or 
                         movement of the master crook. But 
                         the sight of Verbeck, held a helpless 
                         prisoner, almost made Riley lose cau- 
                         tion. He was on his feet instantly, 
                         ready to slip down the stairs, cover the 
                         Black Star with a weapon, release Ver- 
                         beck and Muggs, and take the master 
                         rogue prisoner. 
                     
                     
                         But caution returned to him in time 
                         to check such a course. To make a 
                         move like that might be to meet with 
                         disaster. Riley did not know whether 
                         other members of the band were near, 
                         ready to answer an alarm from the 
                         Black Star. He did not know what 
                         would confront him if he threw open 
                         the door and faced the Black Star, for 
                         the Black Star had proved he had un- 
                     
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         usual methods of protection. And a 
                         slip, a mistake, a failure, might result 
                         in the capture of the master criminal 
                         being further delayed. Riley decided 
                         to watch longer, that there was no need 
                         for immediate action, since Verbeck and 
                         Muggs did not appear to be in peril. 
                     
                     
                         He stooped over the crack again, and 
                         there he remained. He heard the bell 
                         ring, and saw a gowned-and-masked 
                         figure enter and give number and coun- 
                         tersign. And then Detective Riley for- 
                         got even Roger Verbeck and his predic- 
                         ament momentarily, as he read the 
                         blackboard conversation and realized 
                         what the Black Star and his band in- 
                         tended doing that night. 
                     
                     
                         Riley had an added need for caution 
                         now. He had to rescue Verbeck and 
                         Muggs, prevent the theft of the gold, 
                         capture the Black Star, and some of 
                         his band, if possible. He could slip 
                         away and go for help--but while he 
                         was gone, Verbeck and Muggs might 
                         be moved, and Riley would not know 
                         where they had been taken; or the 
                         master criminal might leave his head- 
                         quarters, and the police find an empty 
                         nest when they arrived. 
                     
                     
                         Also, Detective Riley, who had 
                         known Verbeck's father and adored the 
                         son, decided he would rather win the 
                         victory with only Verbeck and Muggs 
                         to help. He wanted to see Verbeck 
                         victorious in his feud with the master 
                         criminal. And the Black Star was a 
                         man of strategy who would not be cap- 
                         tured through violence. Two or three 
                         men meeting him at his own game 
                         would have a better chance for victory. 
                     
                     
                         There was another angle, too--a 
                         noisy attack on the Black Star's head- 
                         quarters would warn the members of 
                         his band and allow them to escape. By 
                         working a clever plan of campaign, it 
                         was possible to arrest some of the mas- 
                         ter crook's accomplices. 
                     
                     
                         Riley had the plan. He remembered 
                         how Roger Verbeck, on a former oc- 
                         casion, had donned the Black Star's 
                     
                 
             
             
                 
                 Black Star's Subterfuge 49 
                 
                     
                     
                         robe and mask, and played master 
                         rogue for a day. Riley decided now 
                         that the best plan would be to get into 
                         that lower room and make the Black 
                         Star prisoner. Then Roger Verbeck 
                         could play rogue again, and as the 
                         members reported for orders, they 
                         could be captured, one at a time. 
                     
                     
                         Riley knew he courted disaster if he 
                         stepped into that room and faced the 
                         Black Star in the guise of a police of- 
                         ficer. He did not doubt that the Black 
                         Star, even facing a loaded pistol, might 
                         use some trick, and turn the scales in 
                         his favor. Had he not, once before, 
                         touched a button with his toe and sent 
                         Roger Verbeck to the bottom of a pit 
                         twelve feet deep? 
                     
                     
                         "If I could get into a gown and 
                         mask, and get right beside him without 
                         him suspecting me-" Riley mused. 
                     
                     
                         Gown and mask, he doubted not, 
                         were to be found some place in the 
                         lower hall. But, once inside the room, 
                         Riley would have to give number and 
                         countersign to throw the Black Star 
                         off his guard for an instant--the in- 
                         stant necessary to do the work properly. 
                         That was what bothered Riley--the 
                         number and countersign. 
                     
                     
                         Then he remembered the man who 
                         was to return and take Verbeck and 
                         Muggs away. Riley got up from the 
                         floor, crept down the stairs, and hid 
                         among the shadows in the lower hall 
                         near the outside door. 
                     
                     
                         He did not have to wait long. A 
                         shadowy form slipped through the gate 
                         and took up a position a few paces out- 
                         side the door. Crouching just inside, 
                         Riley waited. The other was waiting, 
                         too, looking at his watch now and then, 
                         and grumbling. And then, down the 
                         street, came a taxicab. 
                     
                     
                         It stopped at the curb. The chauf- 
                         feur glanced up and down the street, 
                         and then darted through the gate and 
                         hurried toward the door. The other 
                         man stepped forward to meet him. 
                     
                     
                         "You're five minutes late," he said. 
                     
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         "Want me to catch particular fits from 
                         the big boss?" 
                     
                     
                         "Got here as soon as I could. I'm 
                         No. 20--countersign Trenton." 
                     
                     
                         "I'm No. 10--countersign Jackson." 
                     
                     
                         "Good. What's the game?" 
                     
                     
                         "We've got this Roger Verbeck and 
                         his valet inside. I'm to put 'em to 
                         sleep, and we're to take 'em near Ver- 
                         beck's house and drop 'em there. Stand 
                         near the door and be ready to help. I'll 
                         get into the robe and mask, and have 
                         'em out here in a jiffy!" 
                     
                     
                         The chauffeur turned his back and 
                         glanced at his cab; the other man 
                         whirled around and started for the 
                         door. Riley had the information he 
                         desired now. He knew this man's 
                         number and countersign, and how to 
                         use them. 
                     
                     
                         The man who had entered the hall- 
                         way went to a small box against the 
                         wall, and took from it robe and mask. 
                         As he raised the robe to don it, De- 
                         tective Riley struck swiftly and with 
                         precision--a sharp blow from a black- 
                         jack in the approved place just behind 
                         the left ear. The Black Star's man 
                         went down without a groan. 
                     
                     
                         Riley gagged him with a handker- 
                         chief, and bound his hands and feet 
                         with some old straps he had carried for 
                         that purpose from the room above. 
                         Working swiftly, he put on gown and 
                         mask, rolled the unconscious man to 
                         one side, and fumbled around the box 
                         until he found a push button. He 
                         pressed the button; a bell tinkled in 
                         the distance. Almost immediately 
                         there was an answering tinkle, and 
                         Riley hurried through the hallway and 
                         opened the door of the illuminated 
                         room. 
                     
                     
                         His glance rested first on the glit- 
                         tering eyes of the Black Star, then upon 
                         Verbeck and Muggs. Whether the 
                         Black Star was aware of the deception 
                         or not, Riley did not know; but he was 
                         forced to turn his back and write his 
                         number on the blackboard. The coun- 
                     
                 
                 4A DS

                         tersign followed, and the Black Star's 
                         orders; and then Riley advanced upon 
                         the defiant Muggs, waited until he was 
                         in the proper position, and whirled to 
                         level his weapon at the Black Star, and 
                         to tear off his mask. 
                     
                     
                         He heard the gasps of relief and joy 
                         from Verbeck and Muggs, but did not 
                         glance toward them again. Riley's 
                         eyes were blazing into those of the 
                         master criminal, and he was watching 
                         for the Black Star to make a move.

                         BLACK STAR TAKES A TRICK. 
                     
                     
                         SILENCE for a moment, and then 
                         Riley spoke in a tense voice, and 
                         swiftly: 
                     
                     
                         "Careful! Move hand or foot, and 
                         I'll fire! I'm not taking any chances 
                         with you, Mr. Black Star!" 
                     
                     
                         A chuckle came from behind the 
                         mask, and the peculiar staccato voice 
                         of the master criminal answered him. 
                     
                     
                         "Detective Riley, as I live! Very 
                         clever of you--very! And threatening, 
                         of course. Violence--always violence 
                         instead of wit and strategy!" 
                     
                     
                         "Keep those hands up!" Riley com- 
                         manded. "Don't move an inch! I'd 
                         as soon shoot you as not; but I guess 
                         we'll take you down to the station in- 
                         stead. And you'll not escape this time, 
                         either!" 
                     
                     
                         "Do you really think you have me?" 
                         the Black Star asked. "You expect to 
                         take me from my own headquarters to 
                         a filthy jail?" 
                     
                     
                         "Never mind the talk! Muggs, can 
                         you hobble over here beside me, so I 
                         can untie your hands and watch this 
                         chap at the same time? Then you can 
                         release Verbeck, and we'll play the rest 
                         of the evening's game in our own 
                         fashion." 
                     
                     
                         The Black Star laughed aloud as 
                         Muggs stood up and started to hop like 
                         a toad to the detective's side. Riley's 
                         glance did not waver; he held the auto- 
                     
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         matic steady, and his eyes never left 
                         the Black Star's mask. 
                     
                     
                         Muggs stopped beside him. Riley 
                         put down his left hand and fumbled 
                         until he found Muggs' wrists, and then, 
                         still watching the master crook, he be- 
                         gan working at the knots. 
                     
                     
                         "You are a very courageous man, 
                         Mr. Riley," the Black Star said. "You 
                         cannot guess what may happen in a 
                         situation like this. Perhaps the floor 
                         will fall from under you, as it did with 
                         Mr. Verbeck once, and let you down 
                         into a pit. You may turn to find half a 
                         dozen of my good friends at your back, 
                         ready to seize you--" 
                     
                     
                         "Don't worry about me turning! 
                         I'm keeping my eyes on you!" Riley 
                         snarled. "Try something new." 
                     
                     
                         "Something new--something clever?" 
                         the Black Star said, his tone sarcastic. 
                         "Let me think! I might extinguish the 
                         light, so we could fight it out in the 
                         dark--but still, that is not new. You'll 
                         notice the room is illuminated by only 
                         one lamp, which stands on the table 
                         beside me." 
                     
                     
                         "I'm not looking at lamps--I'm 
                         watching you!" Riley replied. 
                     
                     
                         The knots were proving difficult to 
                         untie with one hand, but Riley kept 
                         working at them without looking down. 
                         If he could get Muggs' hands free, 
                         Muggs could untie his feet and release 
                         Verbeck. They could bind and gag the 
                         Black Star, Verbeck could don his robe 
                         and mask, and they could capture, one 
                         by one, such of the band as came to re- 
                         port or receive orders. 
                     
                     
                         "Those are excellent knots," the 
                         Black Star observed. "At some future 
                         time I'll be glad to teach you how to tie 
                         them. Don't you think this comedy has 
                         gone quite far enough?" 
                     
                     
                         "If this is your idea of a comedy, 
                         you'll be liable to change your mind be- 
                         fore long!" Riley said. 
                     
                     
                         "I am interested to know how you 
                         got inside, and how you knew what

                         number and countersign to write. Some 
                         of my men must have been careless." 
                     
                     
                         "You'll find one of them in the hall 
                         with a broken head!" Riley exclaimed. 
                     
                     
                         "Indeed? Always violent! If you 
                         would learn to use wit and strategy 
                         instead of--" 
                     
                     
                         The broken sentence, a quick move, 
                         a shot, darkness! 
                     
                     
                         The Black Star had taken the chance. 
                         On the word, he had sprung to one 
                         side, toward the table. Riley's bullet 
                         went within six inches of his head. 
                         There was a crash as the lamp was 
                         dashed to the floor. Twice more flame 
                         streaked the darkness and bullets 
                         crashed into the wall. Verbeck, help- 
                         less, struggled to get to his feet. 
                         Muggs mouthed imprecations because 
                         his hands were still bound. 
                     
                     
                         Black silence then--not even a man's 
                         breathing to be heard! Riley had re- 
                         treated silently to the door, and stood 
                         there straining his ears to catch some 
                         slight sound that would tell him where 
                         the master criminal was crouching. He 
                         did not dare fire at random again; he 
                         did not know but what Muggs had 
                         moved, and might receive the bullet in- 
                         tended for the Black Star; he was 
                         afraid Verbeck had left the couch. 
                     
                     
                         A slight hissing sound--a body crash- 
                         ing to the floor! Riley, holding his 
                         breath, wondered what it meant. Was 
                         it Verbeck--Muggs? Had the Black 
                         Star descended to the violence he 
                         scoffed, and used a knife in the dark? 
                     
                     
                         Verbeck, on the couch, wondered, 
                         too. His nerves were on edge, waiting 
                         for the shot he expected with every 
                         heart beat: He heard the hissing again 
                         --the sound of another falling body! 
                     
                     
                         Then a moment of silence again. The 
                         strain was almost unbearable. Verbeck 
                         felt like shrieking, like calling to Riley 
                         and Muggs--though he knew neither 
                         would answer and betray his position. 
                     
                     
                         A chuckle--a deep, satisfied laugh! 
                         On the opposite side of the room a 
                         match flickered, and in its flame Ver- 
                     
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         beck beheld the black mask, the flam- 
                         ing jet star on the hood above it. 
                     
                     
                         "Quite melodramatic, Mr. Verbeck, 
                         eh?" the Black Star said. "I was 
                         forced to take quite a chance that time 
                         --Detective Riley might have sent a 
                         bullet or two into my body. However, 
                         luck was with me again!" 
                     
                     
                         The match flame died out. The 
                         Black Star struck another and carried it 
                         across the room. He picked up the 
                         lamp, put it back on the table. 
                     
                     
                         "Only the chimney broken," he said. 
                         "We'll have poor light, but it will 
                         serve." 
                     
                     
                         He chuckled again as he touched the 
                         flaming match to the wick. The fitful, 
                         uncertain light filled the room. Ver- 
                         beck gave a cry of horror. Muggs was 
                         stretched on the floor near the table; 
                         Riley lay on his face near the door. 
                     
                     
                         "Do not be alarmed for your 
                         friends," the master criminal said. 
                         "They have not been assassinated, Mr. 
                         Verbeck, but merely put to sleep for a 
                         short time. Unless you desire to share 
                         their condition, remain where you are, 
                         on the couch, until I give you permis- 
                         sion to leave." 
                     
                     
                         He hurried across to Riley and took 
                         off the robe; he picked up the mask 
                         from the floor where Riley had tossed 
                         it; he hurried out through the door. 
                     
                     
                         Verbeck started to get up, but fell 
                         back on the couch again. He did not 
                         know of the vapor gun, and it was a 
                         mystery to him what had happened to 
                         Muggs and Riley. He didn't want to 
                         be rendered unconscious himself, for 
                         there was work to be done if he was al- 
                         lowed to go, or could escape. 
                     
                     
                         He wondered how Riley had trailed 
                         them and entered the room. And what 
                         would happen, now that the detective 
                         knew the location of the Black Star's 
                         headquarters? Would the master crim- 
                         inal change his mind and hold all three 
                         of them prisoners? Would it be im- 
                         possible to prevent the theft of gold 
                         planned for two o'clock in the morning?

                         The door opened, and the Black Star 
                         came into the room again. 
                     
                     
                         "Detective Riley strikes hard," he 
                         observed. "However, my man is con- 
                         scious again now, and will be with us 
                         in a few minutes. The pity of it is that 
                         he'll be useless after this, as I have 
                         seen his face. I must provide for him 
                         and send him away, for I cannot break 
                         one of our rules. Ah, well--it is all in 
                         the game!" 
                     
                     
                         "And the game isn't ended yet!" Ver- 
                         beck said. 
                     
                     
                         "Angry because I was forced to put 
                         your friends asleep, eh?" the Black 
                         Star chuckled. "That puzzles you, per- 
                         haps. Merely a vapor gun, Mr. Ver- 
                         beck--though the vapor itself is some- 
                         what of a secret. See?" 
                     
                     
                         He took the vapor gun from beneath 
                         his robe, waved it at Verbeck, then re- 
                         turned it. The door opened--there en- 
                         tered a robed and masked man, who 
                         staggered as he walked. 
                     
                     
                         "You brought the straps? Good!" 
                         the Black Star said. "We'll just make 
                         Detective Riley secure first. Easy, 
                         now! Don't be rough, simply because 
                         he knocked you on the head--it's all in 
                         the game." 
                     
                     
                         In a moment Riley was bound and 
                         rolled to a corner of the room. Then 
                         the Black Star held a handkerchief be- 
                         neath Muggs' nostrils, and almost im- 
                         mediately Muggs sighed and opened his 
                         eyes. 
                     
                     
                         "That's better. Help me get him to 
                         the couch," the master criminal ordered 
                         his man. 
                     
                     
                         They carried Muggs across the room 
                         and put him down beside Verbeck. 
                         The Black Star took out his watch and 
                         glanced at it. 
                     
                     
                         "Um! Nine-thirty," he said. "But 
                         for the sudden and unexpected appear- 
                         ance of Riley, you'd be home by this 
                         time, Mr. Verbeck, with this man of 
                         yours. You must blame Detective 
                         Riley for the delay- Ah, Mr. 
                         Muggs! Feeling better now?" 
                     
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         "You--you-" Muggs stammered. 
                     
                     
                         "No violent language, I pray! At- 
                         tend me closely now, gentlemen. I 
                         promised to send you home, and I'll 
                         keep my promise. You must go as you 
                         came, of course--unconscious. You 
                         then will be unable to say where this 
                         room is located. With Detective Riley 
                         it is different. He evidently trailed 
                         somebody to this place--he knows its 
                         exact location. I cannot allow him to 
                         go free, naturally, after that. I must 
                         keep him prisoner for a time. It may 
                         be necessary for me to change my head- 
                         quarters again. Quite a nuisance!" 
                     
                     
                         "If Riley is harmed-" Verbeck 
                         began. 
                     
                     
                         "Tut, tut! I repeat, I abhor vi- 
                         olence. But let us not waste more 
                         time." He turned to the man beside 
                         him. "You understand?" he asked. 
                         "The cab is waiting, I believe. Take 
                         these two men to within a block or so 
                         of Mr. Verbeck's residence, and drop 
                         them there. You must use the vapor 
                         gun, of course." 
                     
                     
                         Without replying, the man Riley had 
                         struck stepped forward, drawing the 
                         weapon from beneath his robe. Muggs 
                         shrank from him. A touch of the trig- 
                         ger, and Roger Verbeck beheld the 
                         cloud of vapor, heard Muggs' futile cry 
                         of protest, and saw his comrade in arms 
                         topple over on the couch as if shot 
                         through the heart. 
                     
                     
                         "Very neat," the Black Star said. 
                         "Carry him out, and then return for 
                         the other." 
                     
                     
                         Muggs was lifted and carried to the 
                         door. The Black Star helped take him 
                         into the hallway. Verbeck heard a 
                         third man called in low tones, and the 
                         master criminal returned. 
                     
                     
                         "You see, Mr. Verbeck, it is useless 
                         to match wits with me," he said. "A 
                         short time ago you thought you had me, 
                         eh? And now--" 
                     
                     
                         "The game isn't ended yet!" Verbeck 
                         interrupted. 
                     
                     
                         "I believe you said that once before. 
                     
                 
             
             
                 
                 Black Star's Subterfuge 53 
                 
                     
                     
                         I care not how long the game endures, 
                         if I take all the tricks. Ah, here is 
                         our friend again! It is your turn now, 
                         Mr. Verbeck." 
                     
                     
                         The man with the vapor gun stepped 
                         swiftly across the room. 
                     
                     
                         CHAPTER VI. 
                     
                     
                         THE BLAZED TRAIL. 
                     
                     
                         VERBECK'S feet were lashed to- 
                         gether and his hands tied, but 
                         Roger Verbeck refused to despair in 
                         the face of even such obstacles as 
                         those. 
                     
                     
                         He waited until the masked and 
                         robed figure with the vapor gun was 
                         within six feet of him, until the gun 
                         was thrown up as if to be discharged, 
                         and then, holding his breath and half 
                         closing his eyes, Verbeck sprang 
                         through the air. 
                     
                     
                         It was unexpected, and he crashed 
                         against the enemy with such force as to 
                         hurl him to the floor. Verbeck re- 
                         gained his balance and sprang nimbly 
                         to one side, as the Black Star, growl- 
                         ing his anger, started forward. With 
                         his lashed wrists held at arms' length 
                         before him, Verbeck hopped like a toad 
                         across the room, and brought up against 
                         the wall beside the nearest blackboard. 
                     
                     
                         His brain was working as well as 
                         his muscles. Through Verbeck's mind 
                         flashed the thought that his abduction 
                         and that of Muggs, their visit to the 
                         Black Star's headquarters, their knowl- 
                         edge of the crime planned for that night 
                         would be of no value unless he could 
                         tell afterward where the headquarters 
                         was located. If he inhaled that 
                         pungent vapor, he would be able to 
                         tell nothing except the appearance of 
                         the room's interior. 
                     
                     
                         He backed away as the Black Star 
                         and the other man approached him 
                         again, with more caution this time. 
                         They sprang toward him together, and 
                         Verbeck whirled and presented his 
                     
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         back. He threw an elbow back sharply 
                         as he felt one of them grasp him by the 
                         shoulder, and some one grunted in sud- 
                         den pain as the elbow struck into the pit 
                         of his stomach. 
                     
                     
                         Both men had their hands on him 
                         now, trying to bend him backward, with 
                         the intention, Verbeck felt sure, of dis- 
                         charging a cloud of vapor into his face, 
                         and rendering him unconscious. Then 
                         he would be carried to the taxicab like 
                         a bag of meal, and, after a time, de- 
                         posited with Muggs near home, there to 
                         regain consciousness and remember 
                         that the Black Star held Detective Riley 
                         prisoner, and that he did not know 
                         where. 
                     
                     
                         He struggled as well as he could 
                         with his feet and wrists bound. He 
                         grasped the end of the blackboard and 
                         bent his head, trying to avoid the cloud 
                         of vapor he knew was coming. His 
                         hands went into the chalk box--me- 
                         chanically he grasped half a dozen 
                         pieces of crayon and crushed them in 
                         his palm. 
                     
                     
                         A sudden wrench, and they bore him 
                         backward, working roughly and with- 
                         out speaking. Verbeck saw the vapor 
                         gun presented at his face, and caught 
                         his breath. The trigger was pressed; 
                         vapor filled the air about him. 
                     
                     
                         Verbeck held his breath. He stag- 
                         gered backward, the Black Star still 
                         clinging to him. Foot by foot, pretend- 
                         ing to grow weaker, he stumbled from 
                         the wall and the vapor cloud, fighting 
                         himself to keep from taking a breath. 
                     
                     
                         At the same time he turned actor-- 
                         his eyes fluttered, he grew limp, did 
                         everything to give the men who gasped 
                         him the idea that the vapor had done 
                         its work. It seemed that his lungs 
                         would burst. Red streaks flashed be- 
                         fore his eyes. And then--carefully, 
                         slowly--he let air into his nostrils, hop- 
                         ing that the danger was over. 
                     
                     
                         "That fixed him!" 
                     
                     
                         The Black Star broke a rule and

                         spoke in the presence of one of his men, 
                         but in a low voice not like his own. 
                         They let Verbeck slip down to the floor. 
                         He continued his acting, but his eyes 
                         did not close entirely. He was breath- 
                         ing regularly now, yet carefully and not 
                         deeply. And through his half-closed 
                         eyes he watched the vapor gun, fear- 
                         ing it would be turned against him 
                         again, that he would be caught off 
                         guard and inhale the sleep-producing 
                         gas. 
                     
                     
                         The Black Star clapped his hands 
                         and hurried to the blackboard. Ver- 
                         beck heard the squeak of the crayon 
                         as he wrote, but could not see what was 
                         being written without turning his head, 
                         and he did not dare do that. 
                     
                     
                         The man who had used the vapor 
                         gun bent and took the bonds from Ver- 
                         beck's wrists and ankles. He caught 
                         Verbeck under the arms from behind, 
                         and lifted him gently and carried him 
                         toward the door. He threw the door 
                         open. 
                     
                     
                         They were in the dark, narrow hall- 
                         way now, and the door was closed be- 
                         hind them. Verbeck's captor was 
                         dragging him along, and Verbeck con- 
                         tinued to pretend unconsciousness, al- 
                         lowing his dead weight to rest upon the 
                         other man's shoulder. They made a 
                         turn, and there another man waited. 
                     
                     
                         "Got him?" he whispered. 
                     
                     
                         "Yes--he put up a scrap. Wait un- 
                         til I get this gown and mask off." 
                     
                     
                         The chauffeur held Verbeck, while 
                         the other removed the regalia. Then 
                         they took him along the narrow cor- 
                         ridor toward the door. 
                     
                     
                         Verbeck did not know what instant 
                         they would discover he was conscious 
                         and use the vapor gun again to better 
                         advantage. He remembered the chalk he 
                         still held in one fist. A few chalk marks 
                         might serve as a trail and point the 
                         way to the Black Star's den. 
                     
                     
                         He moved his fingers until he held 
                         one of the sticks of crayon in position 
                     
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         for writing. He managed to lurch 
                         against the wall--and left a long, white 
                         mark. 
                     
                     
                         They made another turn, went up a 
                         short flight of steps. Verbeck made 
                         more marks. A door was opened, and 
                         the cold night air struck them. Out- 
                         side, Verbeck saw a littered factory 
                         yard, with a gate in the distance, and 
                         a taxicab waiting before it at the curb. 
                     
                     
                         Verbeck continued his acting as they 
                         half carried him across the yard to the 
                         gate, and there they propped him 
                         against the wall for a moment, while 
                         the chauffeur glanced up and down the 
                         street, and started the engine. And 
                         when they carried him forward again, 
                         Verbeck had left on the gatepost and 
                         the wall beside it a series of crosses 
                         marked with chalk. 
                     
                     
                         They reached the cab. Verbeck man- 
                         aged to break off a small piece of 
                         crayon and grind it beneath one heel, 
                         leaving a white blotch on the dirty walk. 
                         They tossed him inside--and he lurched 
                         across the unconscious Muggs and fell 
                         against the opposite door. The window 
                         was open, and Verbeck managed to fall 
                         on the seat in such fashion that the 
                         hand holding the chalk was extended 
                         a few inches out of the window. 
                     
                     
                         The chauffeur sprang to his seat; the 
                         other man entered the cab and closed 
                         the door; the vehicle started away. 
                     
                     
                         Now Verbeck's every sense was alert, 
                         though he continued to pretend uncon- 
                         sciousness. Born and reared in this 
                         city as he was, yet he did not recognize 
                         the locality from what he saw through 
                         the window of the cab. He could 
                         guess what part of the city it was in, 
                         but that was all. And there was going 
                         to be no time to waste if the Black 
                         Star's headquarters was to be raided 
                         in time to prevent the gold theft. It 
                         was essential that Verbeck he able to 
                         lead police to the scene as speedily as 
                         possible. 
                     
                     
                         There would be no time to search fif- 
                         teen or twenty blocks for some certain 
                     
                 
             
             
                 
                 Black Star's Subterfuge 55 
                 
                     
                     
                         abandoned factory building, when pos- 
                         sibly there were a score of such build- 
                         ings within that area. And a search 
                         would warn the Black Star. There 
                         could be but one way to success--a di- 
                         rect and unexpected descent upon the 
                         master crook's den. 
                     
                     
                         Verbeck noticed that the pavement 
                         was rough--cobblestones, evidently. 
                         He could see little of the buildings he 
                         was passing, because of the dark. At 
                         the first corner he noticed an empty, 
                         one-story store with boarded windows. 
                         Beside it was a billboard flaunting a 
                         glaring soap advertisement. These 
                         things Verbeck remembered. 
                     
                     
                         He counted the blocks until the taxi 
                         made the first turn, and there, beneath 
                         the arclight on the corner, he dropped 
                         a piece of chalk to the street. He was 
                         trying to remember the trail, also to 
                         mark it. 
                     
                     
                         And, at the same time, his brain was 
                         active in quite another direction. He 
                         wondered whether he should attempt to 
                         overpower this man sitting beside him, 
                         and the chauffeur, and make an effort 
                         to turn these two of the Black Star's 
                         band over to the police. That done, he 
                         could call for help and lead the way 
                         back to the master criminal's headquar- 
                         ters, possibly capture him at work, and 
                         rescue Riley. 
                     
                     
                         But the chances of failure were too 
                         great, the percentage was against Ver- 
                         beck. Suppose he tried it, and failed? 
                         Then the vapor gun would come forth 
                         again, he would be rendered uncon- 
                         scious in truth, and left near home with 
                         Muggs, and, not having marked the 
                         trail, would be unable to lead a squad 
                         of police to the Black Star's place. It 
                         was best, Verbeck decided, to continue 
                         his acting and try to remember the 
                         trail. 
                     
                     
                         Whenever the taxi turned a corner, 
                         Verbeck dropped more chalk. He also 
                         was trying to remember the number of 
                         blocks between the turns, and he was 
                     
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         gaining some sense of location now. 
                         On and on the taxi dashed, until it 
                         reached the retail district. Verbeck 
                         identified a corner; he was not forced 
                         to remember anything more now--he 
                         could begin the back trail there. 
                     
                     
                         Again he considered whether to at- 
                         tack the man beside him. But he de- 
                         cided against it again. If he did, and 
                         failed, the Black Star would be warned 
                         that he had not been unconscious, and 
                         escape. If he allowed himself to be put 
                         out near home with Muggs, he could 
                         hurry to the house, inform the police, 
                         and begin the effort to frustrate the 
                         Black Star's plans and capture him 
                         and some of his band. 
                     
                     
                         The taxi sped along a boulevard, 
                         made another turn, and lurched toward 
                         the curb. They were within three 
                         blocks of the Verbeck place now, and 
                         here giant maple trees lined the street, 
                         casting great shadows. It was an ideal 
                         place to drop unconscious men without 
                         being observed. 
                     
                     
                         The taxicab stopped. Verbeck heard 
                         the man beside him laugh lightly to 
                         himself. And then- 
                     
                     
                         Why hadn't he anticipated it? He 
                         might have guessed the Black Star's 
                         man would use the vapor gun again be- 
                         fore putting him out of the cab with 
                         Muggs, for fear they might awake too 
                         soon and create a disturbance before 
                         the taxi got away! Why hadn't he been 
                         on guard, ready to hold his breath 
                         again, and act as before? 
                     
                     
                         His senses whirled. Dimly he re- 
                         membered the chalk trail--the corner 
                         from which he was to start--that the 
                         possible capture of the Black Star and 
                         the immediate rescue of Riley depended 
                         on his memory--and there was some- 
                         thing about a hundred thousand in 
                         gold-- 
                     
                     
                         His head fell forward--he seemed to 
                         hear a voice in the distance--and then 
                         the dreamless sleep came to him as it 
                         had come to Muggs!

                         CHAPTER. VII. 
                     
                     
                         AT BAY. 
                     
                     
                         NEARER and nearer, louder and 
                         more insistent came the voice. 
                     
                     
                         "Boss! Boss! Wake up, boss! Aw, 
                         boss, can't you wake up?" 
                     
                     
                         Verbeck recognized the voice as that 
                         of Muggs, but it seemed he was in 
                         darkness. And then, rapidly, things 
                         cleared. His head whirled again, but 
                         this time consciousness was returning 
                         to him instead of leaving. 
                     
                     
                         "Try to sit up, boss! That's the 
                         stuff!" 
                     
                     
                         Now Muggs had an arm around his 
                         shoulders and was urging him to bend 
                         forward. Verbeck sighed and opened 
                         his eyes. He was in the darkness, on 
                         the ground between sidewalk and curb. 
                     
                     
                         "Why--what--" he gasped. 
                     
                     
                         Memory returned to him with a rush. 
                         He struggled to get to his feet, and 
                         Muggs aided him, and they staggered 
                         toward the walk. The Black Star's 
                         headquarters--Riley held prisoner--the 
                         chalk trail--the vapor gun! Verbeck 
                         remembered all, and was roused to ac- 
                         tion. 
                     
                     
                         "One moment, Muggs--I'm dizzy," 
                         he complained. "Just let us stand here 
                         a minute or so, then we'll get busy!" 
                     
                     
                         "When I came to, you were dead to 
                         the world, boss. Ain't it the deuce? 
                         Where do you suppose them headquar- 
                         ters are, eh? And how are we goin' to 
                         get Riley out?" 
                     
                     
                         "Things aren't as bad as they seem, 
                         Muggs. I know a thing or two." 
                     
                     
                         "Did they shoot that stuff at you as 
                         soon as they put me to sleep?" 
                     
                     
                         "They did, Muggs, but it didn't take 
                         effect." 
                     
                     
                         "Wh-what's that, boss?" 
                     
                     
                         "I fought them, Muggs--held my 
                         breath. I pretended to be unconscious, 
                         and they carried me to the taxi. They 
                         didn't put me to sleep until just before 
                         we were taken out of the cab. I got 
                         caught off guard then." 
                     
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         "Boss! You--you--" 
                     
                     
                         "Exactly, Muggs! I've an idea 
                         where the Black Star has his headquar- 
                         ters. Come along--I'm all right now. 
                         We've got to hurry to the house!" 
                     
                     
                         Side by side they hurried down the 
                         street, went around the corner, and so 
                         came to the old Verbeck place. Once 
                         inside the gate, they ran at top speed 
                         to the front door, unlocked it, hurried 
                         inside. Muggs snapped on the lights; 
                         Roger Verbeck rushed to the telephone 
                         and called police headquarters and 
                         asked for the chief. 
                     
                     
                         "Hello! Chief?" he said. "This is 
                         Roger Verbeck." 
                     
                     
                         He was fighting to keep the note of 
                         excitement from his voice, for Verbeck 
                         knew the chief well. Communicate ex- 
                         citement to the chief, and he would 
                         want to call out the reserves, make a 
                         noise, alarm every crook in the city-- 
                         and so accomplish nothing. 
                     
                     
                         "Listen well, chief," he said now. 
                         "And please do not interrupt--and do 
                         exactly as I say. I've been to the Black 
                         Star's headquarters. Wait--wait! 
                         Keep quiet, chief, and listen. We'll get 
                         along better if we take things coolly. 
                         Yes--I've been inside the headquarters. 
                         He had me knocked out at a restaurant 
                         and took me there. He had Muggs ab- 
                         ducted and taken there. His intention 
                         was to let us see the place, and then 
                         send us away unconscious, and give us 
                         the laugh because we couldn't find the 
                         place again." 
                     
                     
                         "But--but--" 
                     
                     
                         "Wait!" Verbeck commanded. 
                         "While we were there, he even let us 
                         see orders given his men. They've 
                         planned a big trick for to-night. They 
                         are going to steal a hundred thousand 
                         in gold coin at two o'clock in the morn- 
                         ing. It is a shipment that arrived at 
                         noon to-day. Understand? Get the 
                         wheels in motion down there and find 
                         out what bank or trust company re- 
                         ceived that shipment, and have their 
                         place well guarded." 
                     
                 
             
             
                 
                 Black Star's Subterfuge 57 
                 
                     
                     
                         "Yes--yes, I--" 
                     
                     
                         "Wait! Now listen carefully. While 
                         we were there, Detective Riley showed 
                         up--I don't know how he got there. 
                         We had things going our way for a 
                         time, but the Black Star turned the ta- 
                         bles on us, as usual. He's got Riley 
                         there now--a prisoner. . . . Wait, 
                         confound you; and listen! I'm home. 
                         Muggs and I were dumped here uncon- 
                         scious. Get your fastest machine--I 
                         don't know where my roadster is--and 
                         come out here with two of your best 
                         men. Get here as soon as you can. 
                         Only two men, chief--if you bring any 
                         more we'll raise a racket and lose out 
                         entirely. No questions--hurry!" 
                     
                     
                         Verbeck hung up the receiver before 
                         the chief could reply. That he knew, 
                         was the way to get quick action out of 
                         the head of the city's police depart- 
                         ment. 
                     
                     
                         "But how are we goin' to find that 
                         place, boss?" Muggs demanded. 
                     
                     
                         Verbeck held up a hand for silence. 
                         He was pacing back and forth across 
                         the room, his brow wrinkled, head bent, 
                         cracking his fingers nervously. Two-- 
                         five--three--eight-- Were those 
                         numbers correct? Had Verbeck re- 
                         turned to consciousness with the right 
                         numbers photographed on his brain? 
                         Two--five--three--eight--and then the 
                         corner he knew and had identified! 
                     
                     
                         He'd have to reverse the numbers, of 
                         course. From the comer, eight blocks 
                         to where the taxicab had made the turn, 
                         then three blocks to the next turn-- 
                         but which direction? Ah, the chalk 
                         would tell if it could be found! 
                     
                     
                         In a few words he explained to 
                         Muggs what he had done, and that the 
                         chances for success were slim. The 
                         small pieces of crayon might be gone. 
                         They might have to retrace their steps 
                         a score of times. And every minute 
                         was precious. It was after ten o'clock 
                         now. They'd have to find the Black 
                         Star's headquarters within a short time 
                         to catch him there. Undoubtedly mem- 
                     
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         bers of the band would report at a late 
                         hour to get final instructions regarding 
                         the theft of the gold. If only several 
                         of them could be captured--if Riley 
                         could be released before harm befell 
                         him! But there'd be no time to waste! 
                     
                     
                         Down the street came the shrieking 
                         of a siren! 
                     
                     
                         "Now curse the chief for a fool!" 
                         Verbeck cried. "Two-thirds of the city 
                         will know we're on the trail before 
                         we've gone two blocks. It is our game 
                         for the Black Star to think we have no 
                         idea where his headquarters can be 
                         found, that we were dead to the world 
                         when we left to be brought here!" 
                     
                     
                         Muggs swung the door open as the 
                         police machine stopped before the gate, 
                         and the chief and two of his men 
                         charged up the walk toward the 
                         veranda. Verbeck met them at the top 
                         of the steps. 
                     
                     
                         "Listen!" he commanded. "Let's 
                         have no noise! The slightest alarm 
                         may spoil our plans. I'll tell you what 
                         I've done." 
                     
                     
                         He spoke rapidly, clearly. He told 
                         what had transpired in the Black Star's 
                         den, about Riley, how he had remained 
                         conscious, and left the chalk trail. He 
                         kept murmuring the numbers he had to 
                         remember until Muggs handed him a 
                         pencil; then he wrote the numbers on 
                         his cuff. 
                     
                     
                         "No siren!" he ordered. "Drive to 
                         the National Building corner first. 
                         That's where we take up the trail." 
                     
                     
                         "I've got men busy telephoning," the 
                         chief reported, as the machine darted 
                         down the boulevard. "If there's a bank 
                         or trust company got that gold ship- 
                         ment, there'll be a crowd of police in 
                         their building within half an hour. And 
                         if we get the Black Star and some of 
                         his men-" 
                     
                     
                         "Muggs and I have spotted two of 
                         his men," Verbeck said. "Muggs can 
                         identify the one who abducted him, and 
                         the chauffeur. And I got a good look 
                         at the one who rode in the cab with

                         us, though I couldn't identify the chauf- 
                         feur very well. But you can lay a 
                         wager right now, chief, that those men 
                         will receive a roll of bills each and be 
                         sent out of town at once. The Black 
                         Star, you understand, knows we have 
                         seen them. Their usefulness for him is 
                         at an end." 
                     
                     
                         "Here's your corner!" the chauffeur 
                         cried. 
                     
                     
                         Verbeck stood up in the machine and 
                         looked around him, then glanced at his 
                         cuff to be sure he was making no mis- 
                         take. 
                     
                     
                         "Drive south eight blocks," he or- 
                         dered, "then stop." 
                     
                     
                         The machine sped away. The 
                         destination was reached. Verbeck 
                         sprang out and looked around at the 
                         pavement. He gave a glad cry and ran 
                         toward one curb. There in the street 
                         was a white blotch, where the heavy 
                         wheel of some vehicle had run over and 
                         crushed a piece of chalk. 
                     
                     
                         "You see?" he cried. "A moment 
                         now!" He looked at his cuff again. 
                         "Three blocks this time--but in what 
                         direction, I do not know. I didn't have 
                         a chance to see very well, remember. 
                         All I know is that the taxi made an- 
                         other turn three blocks from this cor- 
                         ner." 
                     
                     
                         They went toward the west first, and 
                         on the third corner searched without 
                         success for the bit of chalk. There 
                         was a small searchlight on the car, and 
                         with it they swept the pavement for a 
                         hundred feet in every direction. They 
                         found no trace of chalk. 
                     
                     
                         They went to the next corner, think- 
                         ing Verbeck might have made a mis- 
                         take counting the number of blocks, and 
                         again they searched without reward. 
                         Back to the first corner they hurried, 
                         and this time went to the east. Be- 
                         fore they had searched the third corner 
                         there less than a minute, Verbeck found 
                         what they sought. The chalk had not 
                         been crushed here, but here it was, 
                         close to the curb. 
                     
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         Verbeck consulted his cuff again. 
                     
                     
                         "Five blocks," he said. "It must be 
                         five blocks north or south. We know 
                         the place we want to find is in the 
                         manufacturing district somewhere, so 
                         the best guess is south." 
                     
                     
                         Again the machine dashed down the 
                         street. Once more they descended and 
                         searched the pavement. Muggs, the 
                         chief, the two detectives from head- 
                         quarters joined in the search. The 
                         chauffeur operated the searchlight and 
                         flooded the street with brilliance. There 
                         was no sign of chalk. 
                     
                     
                         "Down another block--maybe you 
                         made a mistake," the chief said. 
                     
                     
                         They hurried to the next corner. It 
                         was nearly eleven o'clock. Unless the 
                         chalk could be found, they would have 
                         no direct trail to follow, and a sys- 
                         tematic search of the manufacturing 
                         district would take hours, and put the 
                         Black Star on guard. 
                     
                     
                         Five minutes' search convinced them 
                         there was no chalk on this corner. 
                         They got into the machine and turned 
                         back to the last corner where they had 
                         found the chalk. 
                     
                     
                         "I'm sure I counted five blocks," Ver- 
                         beck said. "Perhaps it is in the other 
                         direction." 
                     
                     
                         "I've got it!" one of the detectives 
                         cried. "See that private alley? You 
                         counted that. It's the fourth corner 
                         instead of the fifth." 
                     
                     
                         They stopped on the fourth corner. 
                         There was a blotch of white on the 
                         pavement--the police machine itself 
                         had made it by crushing the chalk as it 
                         passed. 
                     
                     
                         "Now what?" the chief demanded. 
                     
                     
                         "Two blocks," said Verbeck. "And 
                         that's all I could remember when I re- 
                         gained consciousness. Two blocks to 
                         another piece of chalk, and after that a 
                         considerable run without a turn. We'll 
                         have to go blind until I see something 
                         that recalls the locality." 
                     
                     
                         Two blocks they journeyed at top 
                         speed, two blocks to the east--and 
                     
                 
             
             
                 
                 Black Star's Subterfuge 59 
                 
                     
                     
                         there they found the bit of crayon in 
                         the middle of the street. Once more 
                         Verbeck stood up in the car and looked 
                         down the intersecting thoroughfares. 
                     
                     
                         ''Try that," he said, and pointed to 
                         the south again. "Drive slowly." 
                     
                     
                         The machine went on. Block after 
                         block they passed, while Verbeck 
                         searched the side of the street, trying 
                         to spot some building he remembered. 
                         And then he saw a one-story empty 
                         building, with boarded windows. 
                     
                     
                         "Stop!" he ordered. "To the curb! 
                         I remember this. We're within two 
                         blocks of the place! We'll leave the 
                         machine here and go ahead on foot." 
                     
                     
                         Only the chauffeur remained behind. 
                         Verbeck led the way, with Muggs at 
                         his side, and behind came the chief and 
                         the two headquarters detectives. They 
                         passed the first corner, and then Ver- 
                         beck began walking slower, watching 
                         the curb line, glancing at the gateway 
                         of every factory fence. 
                     
                     
                         "There!" he whispered. 
                     
                     
                         He pointed to the curb, to the chalk 
                         smeared on the walk there, where he 
                         had ground it with his heel as they were 
                         putting him into the taxicab. 
                     
                     
                         "This is the place!" he said, and led 
                         the way to the gate. There were the 
                         crosses he had marked; they were at 
                         the end of the trail! 
                     
                     
                         The building was small, and stood 
                         in the middle of the lot, with the fence 
                         entirely around it. It did not com- 
                         municate with another building, and 
                         was easily surrounded. 
                     
                     
                         "There's the door they use," Verbeck 
                         said. "Through a hall, down half a 
                         flight of steps to another hall in the 
                         basement, a few steps along that, and 
                         you come to the door of the room that 
                         holds the Black Star." 
                     
                     
                         "What do you consider the best 
                         plan?" the chief asked. 
                     
                     
                         "It is bright moonlight--we can see 
                         every square foot of the yard. Sup- 
                         pose your two men keep near the fence 
                         and watch the sides of the building. 
                     
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         You, too, chief. I'll take Muggs and 
                         enter. We'll go prepared for trouble 
                         and try to spring a surprise. We'll get 
                         into that room some way, and there'll 
                         be action as soon as we do. You'll just 
                         have to guess from anything you hear 
                         whether it'll be best to remain outside 
                         on guard or enter the building to help." 
                     
                     
                         "But Riley--" the Chief began. 
                     
                     
                         "I suppose he is in there, unless he 
                         has been taken away by some of the 
                         Black Star's men. If he is there, we 
                         must rescue him, of course, so he can 
                         aid us." 
                     
                     
                         "Better let me send in a call--" 
                     
                     
                         "No!" Verbeck interrupted. "We 
                         can do that laler, if it proves necessary. 
                         A surprise, swift action by just a few 
                         of us, may turn the trick. A bunch of 
                         reserves would alarm the gang. If we 
                         do not do that, we may be able to pick 
                         up several of them if they come to re- 
                         port or receive orders." 
                     
                     
                         "All right," the chief replied. "You 
                         go on in with Muggs, and we'll watch 
                         the outside and be ready to make a rush 
                         if you need help. You're armed, of 
                         course?" 
                     
                     
                         "I'm not--I forgot. Neither is 
                         Muggs. The Black Star relieved us of 
                         our automatics and failed to return 
                         them." 
                     
                     
                         The chief stepped to the curb and 
                         signalled the distant chauffeur, and the 
                         headquarters automobile came to them 
                         swiftly. The chauffeur handed his 
                         automatic to Verbeck, and Muggs re- 
                         ceived a revolver that was in the ma- 
                         chine. 
                     
                     
                         The chief and chauffeur were to hold 
                         the gate. A detective slipped along the 
                         fence in each direction, keeping to the 
                         shadows, trying to get to a post where 
                         two sides of the building could be 
                         watched. Verbeck spoke softly to 
                         Muggs, and they stepped out into the 
                         bright moonlight and started walking 
                         swiftly across the yard toward the little 
                         door. 
                     
                     
                         Verbeck had but one fear--that the

                         Black Star, his plans for the night's 
                         crime completed, had left the head- 
                         quarters and gone to whatever place he 
                         called home. There would be nothing 
                         to do then except watch the empty nest. 
                         But, if the Black Star and some of his 
                         men were in the building- 
                     
                     
                         A flash of flame came from one of 
                         the windows. A bullet whistled past 
                         Verbeck and Muggs, and struck the 
                         fence near the gate. 
                     
                     
                         Another flash of flame--another 
                         bullet! 
                     
                     
                         "Get out of that moonlight!" they 
                         heard the chief shriek. 
                     
                     
                         On another side of the building there 
                         was a shot from a window, and one of 
                         the detectives replied to it. 
                     
                     
                         Verbeck and Muggs dashed back to 
                         the fence and got in the shadows. 
                         More shots flashed from windows. The 
                         Black Star, evidently, was in his head- 
                         quarters with some of his men, at bay, 
                         forgetting his abhorrence of violent 
                         methods, giving battle in an effort to 
                         escape the police he had scorned. 
                     
                     
                         CHAPTER VIII. 
                     
                     
                         THE VOICE OF DESPERATION. 
                     
                     
                         THE chief crept slowly along the 
                         fence until he stood beside Ver- 
                         beck and Muggs. 
                     
                     
                         "They're on to us!" he exclaimed. 
                         "They must have had somebody watch- 
                         ing. Afraid Riley had given the tip 
                         before he was caught, I suppose. Now 
                         we've got to smoke 'em out!" 
                     
                     
                         Shots came at intervals from some of 
                         the windows, and now and then one of 
                         the detectives fired in return. The 
                         chief spoke a few rapid words to the 
                         chauffeur, and in an instant the ma- 
                         chine was tearing down the street, the 
                         siren shrieking. 
                     
                     
                         "Told him to send in an alarm!" the 
                         chief explained. "No use trying to 
                         handle this thing by ourselves, Ver- 
                         beck. We'll have a sweet time getting 
                     
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         in there--but we've got 'em! Thank 
                         Heaven, it's an easy place to surround, 
                         and if they try to come out, we'll get 
                         every last one of them. This will be 
                         the end of the Black Star. But I'm 
                         afraid for Riley, if he's still in there. 
                         These smooth crooks are always the 
                         worst when they get cornered. They 
                         forget they're human. I wouldn't put 
                         it past the Black Star to do for old 
                         Riley, if he finds he's up against a los- 
                         ing game." 
                     
                     
                         More shots from the windows--then 
                         a lull! It was somewhat of a ticklish 
                         situation. Here were five men guard- 
                         ing the four sides of the building, and 
                         it was impossible to say how many were 
                         inside. If the master criminal and his 
                         men made a rush, some of them might 
                         escape. 
                     
                     
                         Crouching nervously in the shadows 
                         of the fence, the five waited, straining 
                         their ears to hear sounds that would 
                         tell of the coming of a police machine. 
                         Minutes passed, and there came no 
                         rush of determined and desperate men 
                         from the building. Verbeck remem- 
                         bered the Black Star's cleverness--be- 
                         gan wondering whether there was some 
                         sort of underground passage through 
                         which he could lead his men to safety. 
                     
                     
                         Again a fusillade of shots, and he 
                         knew they still were in the building. 
                         Did the fusillade herald a rush for 
                         freedom? Gripping their weapons, 
                         those near the fence waited, but the 
                         rush did not come. 
                     
                     
                         And then, from far down the street, 
                         came the shrieks of a siren, rapidly 
                         drawing nearer. The chief gave a sigh 
                         of relief. He left Verbeck and Muggs 
                         and hurried through the gate and to 
                         the curb. The machine turned the 
                         nearest corner and dashed up to him, 
                         and half a dozen police sprang out. 
                     
                     
                         Another siren in the distance--an- 
                         other machine. The chief had reen- 
                         forcements of some fifteen men now. 
                         He explained the situation rapidly, sent 
                         his men to surround the building. 
                     
                 
             
             
                 
                 Black Star's Subterfuge 61 
                 
                     
                     
                         When those inside fired again, they 
                         drew a volley in reply. 
                     
                     
                         "Give it to 'em hot for a while," the 
                         chief passed the word. "We won't try 
                         any rushes yet--can't be losing men. 
                         Get too much criticism--and it isn't 
                         necessary. Make it so hot they can't 
                         stay near the windows. Give it to 
                         'em!" 
                     
                     
                         From all four sides of the factory 
                         building volleys were poured at win- 
                         dows and doors; and from the windows 
                         came answering shots, now in twos and 
                         threes, now with such rapidity that it 
                         seemed at least a score of men were 
                         on the defensive there. 
                     
                     
                         "How many crooks has he got with 
                         him, do you suppose?" the chief asked. 
                     
                     
                         "That is what puzzles me," Verbeck . 
                         admitted. "According to his usual 
                         methods, there never are more than 
                         two or three men besides himself at 
                         the headquarters at any one time." 
                         "Well, it looks to me like there's a 
                         couple of dozen in there now!" 
                     
                     
                         "Perhaps," Verbeck offered, "we 
                         caught them just at the right time to 
                         nab quite a number. According to 
                         what was written on the blackboards, 
                         six men were to steal the gold, and they 
                         may be there for final orders. There 
                         may have been other crimes contem- 
                         plated for to-night, too. Or, it is pos- 
                         sible there is a grand gathering of the 
                         band for a distribution of money from 
                         other thefts. I have ceased to be sur- 
                         prised at anything unusual connected 
                         with the Black Star." 
                     
                     
                         "Well, we've got him now!" the 
                         chief said. "It will be the same old 
                         story of police besieging desperate men 
                         barricaded in a building. They'll hold 
                         us off just so long, and then we'll get in. 
                         And I'll bet we find him a suicide when 
                         we do." 
                     
                     
                         "He made the remark to-night that 
                         when the time came he would know 
                         how to die, even if he had to descend 
                         to suicide." 
                     
                     
                         "There you are! Those smooth 
                     
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         crooks always do that--can't stand the 
                         thought of prison. Well, we'll end his 
                         work anyway; we'll get him--either 
                         dead or alive." 
                     
                     
                         There came another lull in the bat- 
                         tle, and then another volley from the 
                         windows. From one side of the build- 
                         ing came a shriek of pain. 
                     
                     
                         "Barton's hit!" the word traveled 
                         along the line to the chief. "He's got 
                         it bad--through the breast!" 
                     
                     
                         The chief sent orders to have the 
                         man removed and hurried to a hospital. 
                     
                     
                         "That's the thing I'm afraid of," he 
                         confided to Verbeck. "I want to get 
                         the Black Star, but I don't want to lose 
                         men. And those fiends in the factory, 
                         if they think they're cornered, will 
                         shoot to kill." 
                     
                     
                         Another shriek of pain from the side 
                         of the building. The chief muttered a 
                         curse as he slipped away, following the 
                         fence, going to see what man of his had 
                         been wounded now. 
                     
                     
                         "How long they goin' to keep this up, 
                         boss?" Muggs whispered to Verbeck. 
                     
                     
                         "They are cornered, Muggs, and you 
                         know what that means. I suppose 
                         they'll keep it up until the Black Star 
                         is dead, and the others decide to sur- 
                         render and take their medicine rather 
                         than to die. I'm sorry about this. I 
                         had hoped the three of us would get 
                         the Black Star alone, without gun 
                         play." 
                     
                     
                         "Why don't they go in and get 'em ?" 
                         Muggs demanded, with a tinge of dis- 
                         gust in his tone. 
                     
                     
                         "It could be done, but we might lose 
                         men," Verbeck said. "They can't leave 
                         the building without facing police guns 
                         --and we're sure to get them in time. 
                         The chief intends to batter at them, 
                         wear them down, then make a rush 
                         when they realize they are losing the 
                         fight. They'd fight twice as desperately 
                         now, at the beginning of the battle, as 
                         they will later, when their nerves are 
                         on edge and the truth of the situation 
                         dawns on them."

                         "Then we're just goin' to stand off 
                         and fight long distance?" Muggs said. 
                         "If we'd get in the building, we'd end 
                         it quicker." 
                     
                     
                         "I realize that, Muggs. But between 
                         the shadows of this fence and the near- 
                         est door is a patch of bright moonlight 
                         fifty feet wide. Why take chances in 
                         that bright moonlight when, by playing 
                         a waiting game, we win without such 
                         grave chances? Eh?" 
                     
                     
                         "Well--you see, boss--Riley is in 
                         there." 
                     
                     
                         "I--I realize that, too, Muggs." 
                     
                     
                         "And Riley is a good scout. I had 
                         a little run-in with him once, when I 
                         thought he believed I wasn't square, 
                         but I'm strong for him now." 
                     
                     
                         "I understand, Muggs." 
                     
                     
                         "And he had a nerve cornin' in the 
                         headquarters like he did, in that mask 
                         and robe--and he did it to help us out, 
                         I'll bet, as much as to get the Black 
                         Star." 
                     
                     
                         "You want to make a rush for it and 
                         get in the factory? Is that it, Muggs?" 
                     
                     
                         "Well, I'd take a chance, boss, to help 
                         Riley. This game belongs to the three 
                         of us, anyway--the police are just 
                         backin' us up, you might say." 
                     
                     
                         The chief slipped back to them 
                         through the shadows. 
                     
                     
                         "I got a little of that conversation," 
                         he said. "It would be foolish to make 
                         such an attempt now. We'd just have 
                         more men in there in trouble. Why, 
                         I've known Riley for years--knew him 
                         before I ever got in the department. 
                         I'd be the first man to go across that 
                         patch of moonlight, if I thought it 
                         would help." 
                     
                     
                         "Well-" Muggs said. 
                     
                     
                         "We'd walk into trouble. We can 
                         tell there's from a dozen to a score of 
                         men in there, and they're desperate, 
                         ready to die with their boots on like the 
                         old-time bandits did. Suppose two or 
                         three of us did get across that moon- 
                         light and get in the building. We might 
                         whip the dozen or score, and again we 
                     
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         might not. And, if I order a rush now, 
                         I'm going to lose men. I don't want 
                         to do that. We'll just batter away at 
                         them for a time first. I've sent for 
                         searchlights." 
                     
                     
                         "Searchlights?" Verbeck gasped. 
                     
                     
                         "I can connect with a power wire 
                         at the corner of the alley. We'll flood 
                         every window with light, so not a man 
                         will dare get in one of them to shoot. 
                         And then, when the proper time comes, 
                         we'll rush and get into the building. 
                         I've sent for more men, too." 
                     
                     
                         "More men?" Verbeck asked. 
                     
                     
                         "Exactly--more men! Two of my 
                         men are down now, and one of them is 
                         liable to die. Nothing in this town is 
                         as important, right now, as getting the 
                         Black Star, no matter whether we ar- 
                         rest him or kill him trying to. We've- 
                         got him cornered--we know that. He's 
                         got some of his gang with him. And 
                         the police department drops everything 
                         else until we finish this! All the re- 
                         serves are coming. Every policeman 
                         in the city now on duty is getting or- 
                         ders to report here as soon as possible 
                         when he pulls a box. I'm stripping the 
                         town of police to throw a police army 
                         around this block. It'll never be said 
                         we had him surrounded and that he 
                         got away. Here's where we finish the 
                         Black Star." 
                     
                     
                         "If news of this is scattered around 
                         town-" Verbeck began. 
                     
                     
                         "It is scattered around town already. 
                         The call for the reserves scattered it. 
                         There'll be extra editions of the papers 
                         on the street in another quarter hour, or 
                         I'll miss a guess. And then we'll have a 
                         mob down here--several thousand fools 
                         who want to see the scrap, and won't 
                         have any more sense than to try to see 
                         it at close range. I want men to handle 
                         the fool mob as well as surround the 
                         block." 
                     
                     
                         There came another lull in the firing. 
                         No flashes of flame showed at the win- 
                         dows. On the outside, the police re- 
                         filled weapons and waited, half expect-

                         and balk an attempt at escape. 
                     
                     
                         An instant of comparative silence-- 
                         and in that instant a voice--deep, strik- 
                         ing, staccato--that seemed to come 
                         from the interior of the factory, but 
                         could be heard plainly. 
                     
                     
                         "No quarter!" it cried. "We're cor- 
                         nered! Die game! Get as many as you 
                         can! They'll never get me alive!" 
                     
                     
                         A confused murmur came as if in 
                         answer. 
                     
                     
                         "Good!" the voice cried. "That's 
                         the boys! Make every shot count! 
                         after them!" 
                     
                     
                         Another fusillade of shots from the 
                         windows, and answering volleys from 
                         the police! 
                     
                     
                         Verbeck bent close to the chief so 
                         that the latter could hear him above the 
                         din. 
                     
                     
                         "That was the Black Star!" he said. 
                         "You were right--he'll die with his 
                         boots on! And he'll get as many of us 
                         as he can before he dies!" 
                     
                     
                         CHAPTER IX. 
                     
                     
                         MUGGS GOES TO TRY. 
                     
                     
                         THE rattling of pistol shots con- 
                         tinued. From every direction po- 
                         lice officers hurried toward the block 
                         and reported either to the chief or one 
                         of the captains. Lines were stretched 
                         two blocks away on every side, and be- 
                         hind the ropes gathered scores of auto- 
                         mobiles that had carried hundreds of 
                         morbidly curious persons to the scene 
                         of battle. 
                     
                     
                         Throughout the city had flashed the 
                         news that the Black Star and his band 
                         of criminals had been surrounded by 
                         the police in an abandoned factory 
                         building, and that a siege was in prog- 
                         ress. Rumors told of the death of 
                         Roger Verbeck in a duel with the mas- 
                         ter criminal, others that the Black Star 
                         had escaped, and only some of his men 
                         were surrounded, still others that a 
                     
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         dozen policemen had been wounded, 
                         and some slain. 
                     
                     
                         Held in check by the ropes and the 
                         police guard, the throng, ever increas- 
                         ing, passed these rumors around and 
                         invented new ones on the spur of the 
                         moment. Police arriving from su- 
                         burban districts had to fight their way 
                         through the jam to get to the battle 
                         line. The sheriff, hearing of the siege, 
                         journeyed to the spot with his deputies 
                         to offer his aid to the police. A frantic 
                         mayor, unable to get into communica- 
                         tion with the head of his police de- 
                         partment, debated whether to visit the 
                         scene of conflict or wire the governor 
                         of the State for the use of militia. 
                     
                     
                         The first hysteria passed, as it always 
                         does. The throngs behind the ropes 
                         settled down to a steady wait, plying 
                         police officers for late information; the 
                         sheriff and his deputies mingled with 
                         the city's officers on the firing line; the 
                         mayor remembered that only a few 
                         criminals were in that building, and 
                         that it would be a reflection on his ad- 
                         ministration to ask the governor for 
                         help. 
                     
                     
                         The searchlights arrived and were 
                         connected. Floods of light bathed the 
                         factory building, but they did not stop 
                         the volleys of bullets. Officers poured 
                         leaden hail through those windows, un- 
                         til it looked as if no man could approach 
                         one near enough to fire out, yet from 
                         the factory's interior came answering 
                         shots. 
                     
                     
                         A perspiring chief crept close to 
                         Roger Verbeck again. 
                     
                     
                         "Please come with me, Mr. Verbeck 
                         --you and your man," he said. "The 
                         mayor wants to speak to you." 
                     
                     
                         Verbeck and Muggs, hugging the 
                         wall, and so keeping in the darkness, 
                         followed the chief to the gate and 
                         dashed through it. The mayor stood 
                         against the wall outside, half a dozen 
                         other officials with him. 
                     
                     
                         "We ask your advice, Mr. Verbeck,"

                         he said. "You believe the Black Star 
                         is in that building?" 
                     
                     
                         "I heard his voice urging his men," 
                         Verbeck replied. 
                     
                     
                         "And how many men do you believe 
                         he has with him?" 
                     
                     
                         "Frankly, I have no idea, sir." 
                     
                     
                         "I am insisting that the chief have 
                         his men rush the building, Mr. Ver- 
                         beck. He tells me it would be a foolish 
                         thing to do at this juncture. I am of 
                         the opinion that few, if any, policemen 
                         would be wounded making the dash to 
                         the doors." 
                     
                     
                         "Kindly remember," Verbeck said, 
                         "that getting inside the doors is not all 
                         of it. Once inside, there'll be a hand- 
                         to-hand fight. I know the Black Star, 
                         Mr. Mayor. He is a tricky individual. 
                         He had traps in his other headquarters, 
                         and he may have in this." 
                     
                     
                         "Are we to do this sort of thing for- 
                         ever, then?" 
                     
                     
                         "I believe the chief is taking the right 
                         method," Verbeck replied. "He is 
                         flooding the place with light now. If 
                         they continue the fight, they must ap- 
                         pear at the windows to fire, and sooner 
                         or later some of them will be wounded. 
                         A few wounded men, a few hours of 
                         this continual warfare, and the men 
                         inside that building will lose heart." 
                     
                     
                         "I understand Detective Riley, an 
                         old and tried officer, is held prisoner in 
                         the building." 
                     
                     
                         "The last I knew of him, he was," 
                         Verbeck said. 
                     
                     
                         "Um! It seems peculiar to me that 
                         you and your man could not have over- 
                         come this Black Star when you were in 
                         the room with him and Riley had him 
                         covered. I understand he defeated the 
                         three of you." 
                     
                     
                         "He did," Verbeck admitted. "Muggs 
                         and I were bound hand and foot. The 
                         Black Star took a chance and smashed 
                         the only lamp in the room. In the 
                         darkness he overcame Riley and Muggs 
                         with a vapor gun he uses. The rest 
                         was simple, since I was helpless." 
                     
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         "Say!" Muggs shoved his way for- 
                         ward and confronted the city's chief 
                         executive. "Have you got the nerve to 
                         stand here and bawl out my boss be- 
                         cause we got the worst of it? Why, 
                         he's got more nerve than you and all 
                         your police together! He--" 
                     
                     
                         "Muggs!" Verbeck shouted. 
                     
                     
                         "Well, it makes me mad! Why are 
                         we mixed up in this thing, anyway? 
                         Because the police can't handle the job 
                         --that's why! And now the mayor tries 
                         to bawl us out--" 
                     
                     
                         "My good man--" the mayor be- 
                         gan; he was an aristocratic mayor. 
                     
                     
                         "Don't you 'good man' me! Want to 
                         rush in there, do you? Peel your coat, 
                         Mr. Mayor! Get a gun and come on! 
                         I'll lead the way, if you'll follow! 
                         Riley's my friend--I'll lead the way! 
                         Well?" 
                     
                     
                         Verbeck smothered a grin. The 
                         chief turned away quickly to hide the 
                         twinkle in his eyes. 
                     
                     
                         "I--er--we'll just drop the subject," 
                         the mayor said. "Perhaps the chief 
                         knows best." 
                     
                     
                         A volley of shots came from the 
                         building; volleys from the police an- 
                         swered it! 
                     
                     
                         "Some shootin'!" Muggs exclaimed. 
                         "And it takes just one of them bullets 
                         --just one--to do considerable damage 
                         to a man. Want to rush in, mayor?" 
                     
                     
                         "That'll do, Muggs!" Verbeck com- 
                         manded. "The mayor is all right--he 
                         just didn't quite understand." 
                     
                     
                         "Well, if he thinks we haven't got 
                         nerve enough to go in-- You might 
                         tell him we'd have been in there before 
                         this, except that the chief is command- 
                         in' officer and said to stay out!" 
                     
                     
                         "There is no question of your cour- 
                         age, Muggs." 
                     
                     
                         "Nor of yours, Mr. Verbeck," the 
                         mayor said quickly. "Let us drop the 
                         subject, and await developments." 
                     
                     
                         The firing ceased for an instant. 
                         From the factory came a chorus of such 
                     
                 
             
             
                 
                 Black Star's Subterfuge 65 
                 
                     
                     
                         shrieks as a man undergoing torture 
                         might make. 
                     
                     
                         "If--if that's Riley--" Muggs 
                         said. He whirled suddenly upon Ver- 
                         beck. "Let me go, boss!" he implored. 
                         "If I can get in all right, I'll take a 
                         chance afterward. If that's Riley-" 
                     
                     
                         "No, Muggs!" 
                     
                     
                         "Aw, boss! Just turn off the search- 
                         light from that door. It won't take me 
                         a second to run across. I'll--I'll take a 
                         chance! I might do something where 
                         a gang of police couldn't. I--I might 
                         be able to pick 'em off!" 
                     
                     
                         "Perhaps that would be a good idea," 
                         the mayor said. 
                     
                     
                         Verbeck whirled upon the city's ex- 
                         ecutive, and the mayor involuntarily 
                         took a step backward. He realized 
                         he had said the wrong thing, and he 
                         didn't care to antagonize Roger Ver- 
                         beck, for Verbeck had political in- 
                         fluence. 
                     
                     
                         "Muggs' life is worth as much as that 
                         of any man!" Verbeck said. "He's not 
                         getting paid to do such a thing, and 
                         your police are. I refused to say I 
                         thought the police ought to go in. You 
                         might do as much for my friend." 
                     
                     
                         "I--I didnt' think!" the mayor stam- 
                         mered. 
                     
                     
                         The shooting was continuous now. 
                         Despite the glare of the searchlights on 
                         the windows, shots came from the fac- 
                         tory. Verbeck found himself wonder- 
                         ing why they did not shoot at the 
                         searchlights. Perhaps they had, and 
                         had proved poor marksmen, he thought. 
                         Certainly they were not hitting many 
                         policemen, for none had been wounded 
                         except the two early in the fray. Yet 
                         the police, of course, fought from the 
                         shadows. 
                     
                     
                         More officers struggled through the 
                         crowd and reached the firing line. 
                         Word reached the chief from the cen- 
                         tral station that all men had been sent 
                         to him except a dozen or so who re- 
                         mained there and at the precinct sta- 
                         tions to receive telephone messages and 
                     
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         issue alarms in case of an emergency. 
                         The cordon around the factory was as 
                         strong as the chief could make it with- 
                         out swearing in special officers. And 
                         he had enough men--it would be im- 
                         possible for any of the Black Star's 
                         band to escape. 
                     
                     
                         It was unusual, this stripping the city 
                         of defenders by gathering them all at 
                         one spot, but both the chief and the 
                         mayor felt the situation justified it. 
                         For months the Black Star and his men 
                         had terrorized the city. Every attempt 
                         to capture them had failed. Banks had 
                         been raided, jewels stolen. Citizens 
                         were demanding protection. And now 
                         that he had the Black Star in his head- 
                         quarters, it was policy to make it im- 
                         possible for him to escape. 
                     
                     
                         "Boss," Muggs implored. "It'd be 
                         a cinch! And Riley's in there!" 
                     
                     
                         "If you go, Muggs, I go with you." 
                         "No, boss. Just let me take the 
                         chance. I ain't worth much, anyway, 
                         boss. I've had my fling. And you-- 
                         you're goin' to get married--and all 
                         that. You stay here, boss, and let me 
                         go. Just have 'em turn off that search- 
                         light a minute--" 
                     
                     
                         "No, Muggs!" 
                     
                     
                         "But old Riley--" 
                     
                     
                         "I know, Muggs. But we must 
                         wait." 
                     
                     
                         "I've always done as you wanted me 
                         to, boss. Can't I have my own way 
                         this once. Let me go." 
                     
                     
                         "No!" Verbeck answered again. "It 
                         would be foolish, Muggs. You'd only 
                         get into trouble yourself--and you'd 
                         not be able to help Riley, perhaps." 
                     
                     
                         "I--I could try." 
                     
                     
                         Another fusillade of shots. More 
                         shrieks from the factory. It seemed 
                         to Muggs that those shrieks sounded 
                         like Riley. In the past ten days he had 
                         learned to think a great deal of Riley. 
                         And he hated the Black Star. To think 
                         of the Black Star torturing Riley, kill- 
                         ing him-- 
                     
                     
                         A cry from the mayor caused the

                         chief and Verbeck to whirl around. 
                         Muggs, revolver in hand, had run out 
                         into the path of light. 
                     
                     
                         ''Muggs!" Verbeck shrieked. 
                     
                     
                         But Muggs did not seem to hear. He 
                         turned around, threw up his revolver, 
                         and fired. The lens of the searchlight 
                         was shattered--the path of bright light 
                         that illumined the door died away. A 
                         shadowy form darted in zigzag fashion 
                         toward the factory. 
                     
                     
                         Muggs had gone to try! 
                     
                     
                         CHAPTER X. 
                     
                     
                         IN THE DOORWAY. 
                     
                     
                         ROGER VERBECK, millionaire and 
                         clubman, wealthy son of a wealthy 
                         father, realized in that moment what 
                         true brotherhood means. His relations 
                         with Muggs flashed through his mind. 
                         Muggs, derelict of destiny, crook, off- 
                         spring of scum--Verbeck had picked 
                         him up in Paris one night when Muggs, 
                         weary of existence, was about to throw 
                         himself into the Seine. Muggs was at 
                         the points those who tread the paths of 
                         crime often reach--disgusted with what 
                         he had made of his life, seeing no hope 
                         of living differently, ready to die rather 
                         than continue. 
                     
                     
                         Verbeck saved him; Muggs became 
                         an honest man. They had been com- 
                         rades since--a peculiar comradeship 
                         that caused comment because of the 
                         difference between them. 
                     
                     
                         Now Verbeck remembered the ad- 
                         ventures through which they had 
                         passed. Why, Muggs had even saved 
                         his life once! And now Muggs had 
                         gone into that factory, facing almost 
                         certain death--gone to the rescue of a 
                         man he did not know two weeks be- 
                         fore, simply because he admired that 
                         man. Should not Roger Verbeck, then, 
                         stand by Muggs, whom he had known 
                         for five years, with whom he had stood 
                         shoulder to shoulder in many battles? 
                     
                     
                         Verbeck forgot his wealth, his station 
                         in life, even his fiancée, and the happi- 
                     
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         ness in store for him. He remembered 
                         only Muggs--Muggs, who often had 
                         fought for him, who now was facing 
                         danger, perhaps death, without Ver- 
                         beck by his side. 
                     
                     
                         Acting on the impulse that had come 
                         to him, Verbeck started forward. 
                     
                     
                         "Oh, no, you don't!" 
                     
                     
                         It was the chief who spoke, who 
                         grasped Verbeck around the waist, and 
                         called to two officers near for help. 
                     
                     
                         "We can't allow it, Mr. Verbeck," he 
                         said. "I'm sorry Muggs went in. Cer- 
                         tainly we cannot allow you to throw 
                         your life away." 
                     
                     
                         "Then send in your men! Muggs 
                         has gone because Riley, one of your de- 
                         tectives, is in there!" 
                     
                     
                         "Soon--but not just yet!" the chief 
                         said. "We must batter them more 
                         first!" 
                     
                     
                         He signed to the two officers to watch 
                         Verbeck, and then hurried away to have 
                         another searchlight turned on the door- 
                         way in place of the one Muggs had 
                         smashed. Verbeck, raging, walked 
                         back and forth along the fence. 
                     
                     
                         And Muggs, meantime, was crouch- 
                         ing just inside the door, recovering 
                         breath after his dash. Muggs was the 
                         fighter, the killer now. His lower jaw 
                         was shot forward again, his lips set 
                         tightly over his teeth, his eyes nar- 
                         rowed. 
                     
                     
                         He buttoned his coat tightly across 
                         his breast and pulled his cap down low 
                         over his eyes. Gripping the revolver, 
                         holding it in front of him ready for in- 
                         stant use, he began to creep slowly 
                         along the hallway. 
                     
                     
                         When Muggs had passed through 
                         that hallway before, he had been un- 
                         conscious, hence he knew nothing con- 
                         cerning it, and he did not dare strike 
                         a match; he was not sure his dash for 
                         the door had been unobserved. He 
                         made his way forward slowly through 
                         the blackness, his left hand continually 
                         feeling the wall. 
                     
                     
                         He reached the short flight of steps 
                     
                 
             
             
                 
                 Black Star's Subterfuge 67 
                 
                     
                     
                         and felt his way down them, stopping 
                         now and then to listen. From outside 
                         came the rattle of revolver tire; from 
                         the rooms above him came the answer- 
                         ing shots. Muggs realized he was in 
                         the basement of the building, and he 
                         wanted to get to the first floor. 
                     
                     
                         He came, presently, to the other hall, 
                         to the stairs, and went up, one step at a 
                         time, ready for instant battle, trying to 
                         hear the voices of the Black Star's men. 
                         But it was the voice of the Black Star 
                         himself that he heard. 
                     
                     
                         "At them!" it shrieked. "No quar- 
                         ter! Die like men!" 
                     
                     
                         Muggs could not locate the voice in 
                         the din. He was not sure from which 
                         room it came. He crept on along the 
                         hallway until he reached an open door. 
                         There he hesitated a moment, then, 
                         holding his weapon ready, he peered 
                         into the room. 
                     
                     
                         The searchlight did not penetrate 
                         here, and the only illumination was re- 
                         flected from the wall out-side the one 
                         window. Not a person was in the 
                         room. 
                     
                     
                         "At them! Die like men! No quar- 
                         ter!" 
                     
                     
                         Muggs decided the voice of the Black 
                         Star came from another room down the 
                         hall. Again he went forward, always 
                         alert, expecting every instant that one 
                         of the master criminal's men would run 
                         into the hall and discover him. He 
                         came to another door, and found it 
                         closed. 
                     
                     
                         He stopped to listen. Yes--shots 
                         were being fired from that room. And 
                         a searchlight flooded it, too, for the 
                         strong light came from beneath the 
                         door. To open that door meant to face 
                         bullets, perhaps. And Muggs did not 
                         want to do that unnecessarily until be 
                         had found Riley, or the Black Star. 
                     
                     
                         He heard the Black Star's voice again 
                         --and it seemed to come from the base- 
                         ment. He went on along the hall and 
                         turned to the right. Before him a 
                     
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         streak of bright light swept the floor. 
                         The door of the next room was open. 
                     
                     
                         Crouching at the turn in the hall, 
                         Muggs listened and watched. He 
                         knew shots were being fired from that 
                         room, too, and bullets were being 
                         poured into it by the police. Some of 
                         them came through the door and 
                         crashed into the wall. 
                     
                     
                         He heard the Black Star's voice 
                         again, and turned back. It would avail 
                         little, Muggs knew, to clash with some 
                         of the master crook's men. A single 
                         shot might strike him down, and his 
                         effort would have been in vain. He 
                         wondered where Riley was being kept. 
                         He wondered where the Black Star 
                         could be found. He didn't want to go 
                         out without either trying to help Riley 
                         or getting the Black Star if Riley had 
                         met with foul play. 
                     
                     
                         Back along the hall he went, listening 
                         for sounds that would tell him how to 
                         meet the Black Star or his men to best 
                         advantage. He came to another flight 
                         of steps, and went down them. The 
                         master criminal's voice came to him 
                         again, and Muggs could distinguish 
                         from which direction now. 
                     
                     
                         Once more in the lower hall, he 
                         turned to the left and crept along the 
                         wall. The voice was louder, more 
                         distinct. 
                     
                     
                         "Die game! No quarter! That's the 
                         boys!" 
                     
                     
                         Muggs hurried on. In the distance 
                         he saw a faint streak of light. When he 
                         got nearer he saw that it came from 
                         the side of a door. Here was a time for 
                         extreme caution, and Muggs used it. 
                         He stopped again to listen. The rat- 
                         tling of revolver shots continued. And 
                         the voice of the Black Star rose above 
                         the din. 
                     
                     
                         Muggs crept forward to the door. 
                         The Black Star was in that room! A 
                         sudden entrance--and Muggs might get 
                         him covered. And at the first move he 
                         would shoot! He'd be quicker than 
                         Riley had been. He'd be watching for 
                     
                 
             
             
                 
                 68 Detective Story Magazine 
                 
                     
                     
                         treachery. Even if they got him, he'd 
                         get the Black Star first! 
                     
                     
                         Now he was beside the door. The 
                         crack at the side, through which the 
                         light came, was wide enough to give 
                         a man a glance at the room's interior. 
                         Muggs put an eye to the crack. 
                     
                     
                         He recognized the room instantly-- 
                         for it was the headquarters room. He 
                         saw Detective Riley, bound and gagged, 
                         stretched on the couch in the corner, 
                         tossing from side to side. The lamp 
                         without a chimney was smoking on the 
                         table, casting its uncertain light. But 
                         it gave light enough for Muggs to see 
                         around the room. And, as he looked, 
                         he gasped in astonishment. 
                     
                     
                         Outside, by the gate, Roger Verbeck 
                         was raging at the chief and the mayor. 
                         Once more a searchlight bathed the 
                         doorway in brilliance. The volleys of 
                         shots continued, and answering shots 
                         came from the factory. Throngs of 
                         people were behind the police ropes two 
                         blocks away. Rumors were flying again 
                         --twenty policemen had been killed, the 
                         criminals were breaking out; the police 
                         were going to take the place by assault! 
                     
                     
                         The chief was holding a conference 
                         with some of his captains, and plans 
                         for the assault were made. The search- 
                         lights would go out for an instant 
                         when a whistle was blown. A score of 
                         officers would rush for the doors, while 
                         the others volleyed bullets at the build- 
                         ing's windows. The halls would be 
                         seized, and the Black Star's men driven 
                         from room to room until they surren- 
                         dered or gave intimation that they 
                         would die fighting. 
                     
                     
                         Verbeck, automatic in hand, braced 
                         himself for the race across to the door. 
                         He intended to be one of the first inside 
                         the building. The chief could not hold 
                         him back when the police rushed. 
                     
                     
                         The orders were passed around; the 
                         searchlight operators were warned. 
                         There came another lull in the fighting, 
                         and the chief started to raise his whistle 
                     
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         to his lips to give the signal. But a 
                         cry from one of the captains stopped 
                         him. 
                     
                     
                         "Look! Look in the door!" 
                     
                     
                         A stick had appeared there--a stick 
                         to the end of which was attached a 
                         white handkerchief--a flag of truce. 
                         Orders to cease firing sped down the 
                         lines of police. The white handker- 
                         chief was waved frantically. Gradu- 
                         ally the firing died out; not a shot came 
                         from the factory. 
                     
                     
                         The man in the doorway evidently 
                         wanted to be sure his appearance would 
                         not be greeted with a volley. He con- 
                         tinued to wave the handkerchief from 
                         the end of the stick, not even his hand 
                         showing. 
                     
                     
                         "Well?" the chief bellowed. "What 
                         do you want ?" 
                     
                     
                         Another moment's wait, and then-- 
                         Detective Riley appeared in the open 
                         door! 
                     
                     
                         As the cheers of the police greeted 
                         his appearance, Muggs suddenly stood 
                         beside him. 
                     
                     
                         "It's all right, boss!" he called to Ver- 
                         beck. "Come on in!" 
                     
                     
                         CHAPTER XI. 
                     
                     
                         ON THE BLACKBOARD. 
                     
                     
                         RILEY and Muggs blocked the door- 
                         way. 
                     
                     
                         "Better keep every one out except a 
                         choice few," Riley said to the chief, in 
                         a low voice. "You come, and Mr. Ver- 
                         beck--possibly one of the captains-- 
                         that'll be enough." 
                     
                     
                         Something in the tone of his voice 
                         caused the chief to look at him with 
                         quick suspicion, and caused Roger Ver- 
                         beck to glance with apprehension at 
                         Muggs. But neither Riley nor Muggs 
                         gave them a sign as to what they were 
                         to expect. 
                     
                     
                         The chief, however, took the hint. 
                         He selected one captain to go along, 
                         and ordered another to guard the door- 
                         way and keep every one out of the 
                     
                 
             
             
                 
                 Black Star's Subterfuge 69 
                 
                     
                     
                         building for the present. The mayor 
                         had not been courageous enough to 
                         leave the gate. 
                     
                     
                         Flashing his electric torch, Riley led 
                         the way down the hall and steps, and 
                         to the door of the headquarters room, 
                         the others crowding after him. Ver- 
                         beck got a chance to whisper to 
                         Muggs: 
                     
                     
                         "What is it?" 
                     
                     
                         "Just another little trick." 
                     
                     
                         "But--" 
                     
                     
                         "Wait, boss--you'll have to see it!" 
                     
                     
                         The door of the headquarters room 
                         was closed, but Riley threw it open, 
                         and they stepped inside. The chief and 
                         his captain gasped when they saw the 
                         rich furnishings. But they were not 
                         new to Verbeck, and his glance wan- 
                         dered elsewhere. Everything seemed 
                         the same as when he had been there be- 
                         fore, except- 
                     
                     
                         There was a phonograph, with a 
                         gigantic horn, on the mahogany table. 
                     
                     
                         "The Black Star--his men--" the 
                         chief implored. 
                     
                     
                         "None here!" Riley answered. 
                     
                     
                         "Nonsense! They couldn't have 
                         escaped! Unless there's a tunnel of 
                         some sort--" 
                     
                     
                         "There is no tunnel. Neither the 
                         Black Star nor any of his men has been 
                         in this building since you arrived." 
                     
                     
                         "But--" the bewildered chief 
                         gasped. "Why--nonsense! Haven't 
                         they been shooting at us? Haven't we 
                         heard him screeching to his Crooks?" 
                     
                     
                         Riley pointed to the phonograph. 
                     
                     
                         "That is what you heard," he said. 
                     
                     
                         "But the shooting-" 
                     
                     
                         "Let me tell it in my own way, chief, 
                         and we'll get at it quicker. After I 
                         was put out by that blamed vapor gun 
                         --which the Black Star kindly ex- 
                         plained to me afterward--I came back 
                         to life to find that Verbeck and Muggs 
                         had been taken away. I supposed, 
                         naturally, that they had been doped 
                         first, and would be "unable to find the 
                         place again. Since I did know the 
                     
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         whereabouts of this place, I supposed 
                         the Black Star intended to keep me 
                         where I'd not do him any harm. The 
                         first thing he did was to assure me I'd 
                         not meet with violence--and that Ver- 
                         beck soon would be back." 
                     
                     
                         "But-" 
                     
                     
                         "Wait, chief! I want you to get this 
                         straight. After that, the Black Star 
                         went ahead to explain a few things, 
                         gave me the laugh, took off his robe 
                         and mask, put on his coat and hat, and 
                         bade me adieu as cheerfully as you 
                         please. That was within ten minutes 
                         after Muggs and Verbeck had been 
                         taken away--and I've been the only 
                         man in this building since until Muggs 
                         stumbled in here a few minutes ago." 
                     
                     
                         "Nonsense! The shooting--" the 
                         chief persisted. 
                     
                     
                         "Oh, there is an explanation of all 
                         that! By the way, what time is it?" 
                     
                     
                         "Three o'clock!" answered the cap- 
                         tain, after glancing at his watch. 
                     
                     
                         "Then he's done it!" 
                     
                     
                         "Done what?" the chief cried. 
                     
                     
                         "Got away with a hundred thousand 
                         in gold coin. He said he was going to, 
                         didn't he?" 
                     
                     
                         "But the shooting--" The chief 
                         could think of nothing else. 
                     
                     
                         "Look at the two blackboards," Riley 
                         said. "You'll find your explanation 
                         there. Read the one to your right 
                         first." 
                     
                     
                         They whirled to read. Verbeck, with 
                         sinking heart, was reading it already. 
                         And this was the message the Black 
                         Star had left: 
                     
                     
                         To Roger Verbeck and any others it may 
                         concern: If you are reading this, it prob- 
                         ably means that all my plans have been suc- 
                         cessful, as they are generally. 
                     
                     
                         I have scant time, and must be brief. 
                         First, this is not really my new headquar- 
                         ters, but one fitted up for this special occa- 
                         sion. I arranged to have Verbeck or Muggs 
                         abducted and carried here. Accidentally, 
                         both were captured, but that made no dif- 
                         ference. I allowed them to overhear certain 
                         plans, knowing that afterward they would 
                         help carry them out.

                         Detective Riley's arrival was unexpected, 
                         and threatened disaster, but happily I gained 
                         the upper hand. I will leave him here, and 
                         trust he meets with no harm. 
                     
                     
                         Mr. Verbeck, your struggle to keep from 
                         inhaling the vapor was amusing, since there 
                         was no sleep-producing vapor in the gun 
                         used on you. It was a harmless gas instead. 
                         It was intended that you were to think you 
                         were outwitting me by remaining conscious. 
                         I knew you would strive to make sure of 
                         the location of this building. The same plan 
                         would have been worked with Muggs, had 
                         he been captured alone. 
                     
                     
                         It was very clever of you to take the chalk, 
                         and I doubt not you marked everything 
                         along your way. You have departed now, 
                         feigning unconsciousness, and I must hurry 
                         away. Just a few words then, to tell you 
                         what will happen. 
                     
                     
                         "Now read the other blackboard," 
                         Riley said. "Oh, it is interesting, all 
                         right--the crook !" 
                     
                     
                         They turned to the second black- 
                         board, and read: 
                     
                     
                         You, Mr. Verbeck--and I'd wager my life 
                         on it--will send an alarm to police head- 
                         quarters as soon as you reach home and re- 
                         gain consciousness, for my man will use the 
                         real vapor gun on you before you separate 
                         --to give me time to get away. 
                     
                     
                         You will find your way here again as 
                         soon as possible, to rescue Riley and catch 
                         me. When you arrive, you'll be fired upon. 
                     
                     
                         A disturbance will be created, and police 
                         reserves sent for. The firing from this 
                         building will be heavy. The chief, eager to 
                         catch me, will call for more men. You'll 
                         start a siege. You'll batter this old build- 
                         ing with bullets. You'll receive bullets in 
                         return. You'll hear my voice urging my 
                         men to die game. 
                     
                     
                         Presently you'll rush in--and find this! 
                         And while the town is attracted by this dis- 
                         turbance and the business district left prac- 
                         tically unprotected, I'll get my hundred thou- 
                         sand in gold. I'll not make the attempt, of 
                         course, unless you do start a siege. 
                     
                     
                         The writing ended, for the black- 
                         board was filled with it. 
                     
                     
                         "But the shooting-" the chief ex- 
                         claimed again. 
                     
                     
                         "Here is the rest of it--written on a 
                         sheet of paper," Riley said. "The 
                         Black Star left it on the table. Read 
                         this." 
                     
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         He handed it to the chief, who read 
                         it aloud: 
                     
                     
                         The phonograph is simple--it has an elec- 
                         tric connection and holds a special record 
                         made from my voice. 
                     
                     
                         As to the volleys of shots--and I trust no 
                         one is injured, for if so it will be an acci- 
                         dent--that is simple, too. Examine the 
                         building, and fastened in the windows you'll 
                         find automatics. You never saw any exactly 
                         like them before; they are an invention of 
                         a good friend of mine. You'll notice the 
                         cartridges are fed from a belt containing a 
                         hundred rounds of ammunition. Since there 
                         are fifteen guns, that will make some shoot- 
                         ing. You'll notice, too, that the guns are 
                         operated by electricity. You'll find wires, 
                         and if you trace them they will lead you to 
                         a cheap lodging house three blocks away. 
                         Do not blame the lodging-house people, for 
                         they are innocent. 
                     
                     
                         One of my men, sitting in a room there, 
                         has a good view of the factory. He touches 
                         a button, and a gun is fired. He plays a 
                         keyboard, and you get a volley. Another 
                         button starts or stops the phonograph, and 
                         you hear me shriek encouragement to my 
                         men. Quite simple, is it not? 
                     
                     
                         I have been to some trouble and expense 
                         fitting up this fake headquarters, but I am 
                         sure my profit will be great. Please be kind 
                         to the furniture I am leaving behind. And 
                         tell yourselves again you cannot cope with 
                         the Black Star. 
                     
                     
                         And now go out and explain to the news- 
                         paper men what became of the band of des- 
                         perate crooks you besieged in the factory. 
                         It ought to make interesting reading! 
                     
                     
                         Muggs gave a snort, of disgust and 
                         turned away from the table. Roger 
                         Verbeck's eyes met those of Detective 
                         Riley, and each read determination in 
                         the other's countenance. The Black 
                         Star had evaded them again, but the 
                         end was not yet. 
                     
                     
                         "And I've got to tell the newspaper 
                         men!" the chief exclaimed. "That gold 
                         --I wonder if he got it--and from 
                         where!" 
                     
                     
                         His answer came immediately. A 
                         sergeant of detectives hurried to them 
                         from the hall. 
                     
                     
                         "Chief!" he cried. "Word just came 
                         from headquarters. There's been a 
                         consulate robbed. Got a fortune in gold 
                         yesterday at noon, to buy war stuff. 
                     
                 
             
             
                 
                 Black Star's Subterfuge 71 
                 
                     
                     
                         Thought they were keeping it quiet, I 
                         suppose. The Black Star knew about 
                         it, though. His men robbed the vault 
                         and left the watchman on the floor, 
                         bound and gagged, with a black star 
                     
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         pasted on his forehead. It's a hun- 
                         dred thousand in gold coin! Consul's 
                         frantic!" 
                     
                     
                         "Yes," said the chief wearily, "it 
                         seems the Black Star knew about it!" 
                     
                 
                 
                     
                         Johnston McCulley--John Mack Stone being the nom de plume under which 
                         the first two of this series of novelettes were written--is writing another novelette 
                         dealing with the Black Star and the efforts of Roger Verbeck to capture him. You 
                         can look forward to soon having the pleasure of reading this story--and Mr. 
                         McCulley says that it is his best Black Star story so far. 
                     
                 
                 
                     
                         A NEW BUNKO GAME 
                     
                     
                         MEYER CLAYMAN, a blacksmith of No. 1735 Harrison Street, Kansas City, 
                         Missouri, was introduced by Harry Naster, a butcher, of No. 1003 East 
                         Eighteenth Street, to Mr. Grossman: 
                     
                     
                         "Meyer, meet my friend, Sammie Grossman. He's a good boy, and can 
                         make you rich." 
                     
                     
                         Grossman explained he had disposed of all his jewelry stock in St. Louis, 
                         except nine pounds of pure gold, melted into small, coin-shaped pieces. He was 
                         willing to sell the gold for one hundred dollars a pound, he said, half its value, 
                         because he had been called out of town hurriedly on a long trip and was afraid 
                         to take it with him. Clayman desired to see the gold. 
                     
                     
                         Grossman opened a shoe box he had under his arm. The box was lined 
                         with cotton, on which were many bright-yellow disks.  
                     
                     
                         "I'd buy them myself, if I had the money," volunteered Naster. "Maybe I 
                         could get the money." 
                     
                     
                         Then Clayman decided he would buy the gold. 
                     
                     
                         "Now, you take these samples to a jeweler, and see what he says," said Gross- 
                         man, producing several disks like those in the box.  
                     
                     
                         Clayman went to a jeweler, who said the samples were pure gold, worth 
                         $247.20 a pound. Clayman returned, stopping at the bank to get nine hundred 
                         dollars in gold money, and counted it out in Grossman's palm. Grossman took 
                         back the samples. 
                     
                     
                         That night Clayman carried the treasure home with him. 
                     
                     
                         "I guess I'll buy a motor car with the nine hundred dollars I made," he said 
                         to his brother. 
                     
                     
                         Misgivings overtook Clayman the next day. He put the box under his arm 
                         and went hatless to his jeweler friend. The jeweler began his examination, then 
                         looked up with a start. 
                     
                     
                         "These are brass," he said. 
                     
                     
                         The excited Clayman soon learned he had paid nine hundred dollars for a 
                         shoe box filled with the sort of brass checks used to set an electric piano to churn- 
                         ing. They had been gilded over. 
                     
                     
                         Naster was remorseful, and volunteered to search for Grossman. He had 
                         known Grossman three years, he said, and always he was a nice young man. 
                     
                 
             
             
                 
                 
                 
                     A Rustic Rival 
                 
                 
                     by  Sergeant Ryan  
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         NICK CARTER had just con- 
                         cluded a most exciting adven- 
                         ture in a manner highly satis- 
                         factory to himself. It had been 
                         a contest of skill against pluck, and suc- 
                         cess had never been sure until the very 
                         last moment. 
                     
                     
                         By a thousand artful turns and twists 
                         of his adversary, had the great detec- 
                         tive been forced to do his level best. 
                         But he had conquered, and the victim 
                         of his prowess lay on the grass, at his 
                         feet. 
                     
                     
                         I had come up in time to witness the 
                         conclusion of the struggle. The scene 
                         was a "deep hole" in the prettiest trout 
                         stream in Monroe County, Pennsyl- 
                         vania. The time was five o'clock of a 
                         May morning. 
                     
                     
                         Nick held up the sparkling prey for 
                         my admiration. Then suddenly he 
                         dropped the brook trout, and faced 
                         about, looking across the pool. 
                     
                     
                         I followed the direction of his glance, 
                         but saw nothing worthy of special at- 
                         tention, nor could I hear any sound but 
                         those that told of nature waking in the 
                         forest. 
                     
                     
                         "That fellow is in a great hurry, 
                         said Nick. 
                     
                     
                         "What fellow?" I asked. 
                     
                     
                         "That's a question I can't answer," 
                         rejoined Nick, with a smile. "But I can 
                         make out that he's a tall man, familiar 
                         with the woods, has been running a 
                         long way, and will hit the stream about 
                         opposite us if he keeps on as he's go- 
                         ing." 
                     
                     
                         Half a minute later I was able to dis- 
                     
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         tinguish the faint sound of crackling 
                         twigs; but it seemed incredible that 
                         even Nick's ear could catch the separate 
                         footfalls, showing the length of the 
                         stride, and the labored breathing of the 
                         runner. That he was a woodsman was 
                         evident to me as to Nick, from the 
                         lightness of his tread among the under- 
                         brush and from the rapidity of his 
                         advance. 
                     
                     
                         Presently he appeared upon the other 
                         side of the pool. He was a tall young 
                         man, seemingly a native of those parts, 
                         but certainly not a farmer. He had a 
                         rather handsome and remarkably intel- 
                         ligent countenance; and, despite his 
                         brown skin and rough attire, there was 
                         a hint of the scholar about him. 
                     
                     
                         It was evident from his expression, 
                         as he looked across at us, that he had 
                         come to seek us, but he seemed in no 
                         hurry to announce his errand. I noted 
                         that he paid little attention to me, but 
                         stared at Nick point-blank. 
                     
                     
                         "Good morning, Mr. Carter," he said, 
                         at last. 
                     
                     
                         I was considerably surprised by this 
                         recognition, though my friend was 
                         known as Mr. Carter to Farmer Mar- 
                         vin, at whose house we had spent the 
                         previous night, and to a few others 
                         thereabouts. 
                     
                     
                         "I sized you up from descriptions that 
                         I got from one or two people," con- 
                         tinued the young man. "There's only 
                         one Carter from New York who can 
                         shoulder Marvin's flatboat as if she 
                         was a birch canoe, and walk off with 
                         her." 
                     
                 
             
             
                 
                 A Rustic Rival 73 
                 
                     
                     
                         The feat to which he alluded had 
                         been performed on the afternoon be- 
                         fore, when we had fished in Waverly 
                         Pond. I was not aware that anybody 
                         but myself had seen it. 
                     
                     
                         "Your facts are scanty," rejoined 
                         Nick pleasantly; "but your conclusion 
                         is accurate. What can I do for you?" 
                     
                     
                         "The boot's on the other leg," re- 
                         torted the young man. "I'm going to 
                         do something for you." 
                     
                     
                         "Very kind of you, I'm sure," said 
                         Nick. "What is it?" 
                     
                     
                         "I'm going to put you on to one of 
                         the prettiest murder mysteries that ever 
                         you tackled," said the young man, with 
                         enthusiasm. "It happened last night, 
                         but it wasn't discovered till this morn- 
                         ing. I was right there at the time, and 
                         I knew what to do. 
                     
                     
                         "I said to all of 'em, including Dep- 
                         uty Sheriff Wilson, who got there al- 
                         most as soon as I did: 'Don't disturb 
                         anything. Save it for Nick Carter.' 
                         And I made 'em do it, too." 
                     
                     
                         "What was it that they saved?" asked 
                         Nick. 
                     
                     
                         "There was his coat, all covered with 
                         blood, and the horse and wagon in the 
                         yard, and the broken board over the 
                         hiding place where he kept his money, 
                         and--" 
                     
                     
                         "Where who kept his money?" de- 
                         manded Nick. 
                     
                     
                         The young man paused, shame- 
                         faced, like a boy who had done some- 
                         thing very foolish when he has tried 
                         to be especially smart. He covered his 
                         embarrassment with a laugh. 
                     
                     
                         "Guess I'm a bit rattled," he said. 
                         "Besides, I've had a hard run, and my 
                         breath's not as yet got back into my 
                         body. I'll be all right in a jiffy. You 
                         come across the brook--there's a fallen 
                         tree for a bridge just below here--and 
                         by the time you get over I'll be ready 
                         to talk." 
                     
                     
                         Nick said nothing; but he started at 
                         once for the broken tree. I followed 
                     
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         him. and we crossed the brook. The 
                         young man was waiting for us. 
                     
                     
                         I had already "sized him up." He 
                         was, or fancied himself to be, an ama- 
                         teur detective, with great talent for 
                         criminal investigation. He had prob- 
                         ably studied the subject as it is pre- 
                         sented in fiction. This crime which he 
                         had so imperfectly disclosed to us was 
                         doubtless his first opportunity for the 
                         display of his abilities, and he intended 
                         to prove his merit under the eyes of the 
                         great master of detection. 
                     
                     
                         It struck me that he was acting 
                         wisely. A man of less sense would 
                         have tried to keep Nick Carter out of 
                         the case as long as possible, in order 
                         to secure for himself the honor of de- 
                         tecting the criminal. 
                     
                     
                         The young man had fully recovered 
                         his self-command when we joined him 
                         after crossing the brook. 
                     
                     
                         "My name is Walter Fairman," he 
                         said. "I've been teaching the school at 
                         Waverly Falls. Everybody round here 
                         knows me. 
                     
                     
                         "Now for this crime. I was coming 
                         along the highroad, toward Marvin's, 
                         about three-quarters of an hour ago, in- 
                         tending to fish this stream. Just as I 
                         got opposite Sam Bennett's house-- 
                         which is about a third of a mile the 
                         other side of Marvin's--I heard a 
                         woman scream. 
                     
                     
                         "She seemed to be in Bennett's stable, 
                         which is built alongside his barn. The 
                         barn's back of the house, and the stable 
                         stands out at right angles with both, 
                         so that when you walk into the yard, 
                         the stable faces you and the house is 
                         on the left. 
                     
                     
                         "As I came up, I had noticed Ben- 
                         nett's horse and wagon in the yard. 
                         The horse was facing the stable doors, 
                         which were closed. It looked as if Ben- 
                         nett had just driven in; and I wondered 
                         where he had been so early in the morn- 
                         ing. 
                     
                     
                         "When I heard the scream, I ran into 
                         the yard. Just as I did so, Mrs. Ben-

                         nett threw open the big doors of the 
                         stable. 
                     
                     
                         "She seemed to be a good deal stirred 
                         up about something. Says I: 'What's 
                         the matter, Mrs. Bennett?' 
                     
                     
                         "She looked at me sort o' queer, as if 
                         she didn't know what to say. Finally 
                         she told me that she'd been robbed. 
                     
                     
                         "Of course, I asked her all about it. 
                         She took me into the stable, and showed 
                         me a hole in the floor in a corner. Two 
                         or three planks had been pried up, and 
                         there were fresh splinters of wood, 
                         showing that it had been done very re- 
                         cently. Also, the amount of breaking 
                         and splintering proved that it had been 
                         done in a hurry. An ax lay on the 
                         floor, near by. 
                     
                     
                         "Under one of the planks--a short 
                         piece, evidently cut to fit across two 
                         beams that were only about two feet 
                         apart--was a sort of box, made 
                         strongly, and fastened to the beams, on 
                         each side. 
                     
                     
                         " 'That's where Sam kept his money,' 
                         said Mrs. Bennett; 'and it's gone.' 
                     
                     
                         "Certainly, there was no money in 
                         the box, then. I asked her if he threw 
                         it in there loose, and she said no; he 
                         had a small, sheet-iron box to hold it. 
                         That had been taken away. 
                     
                     
                         " 'Where's Mr. Bennett?' I asked. 
                     
                     
                         " 'He's gone away,' she said. 'I don't 
                         expect him back to-day.' 
                     
                     
                         "I thought that her manner was 
                         queer, but it was a good deal stranger 
                         when she began to urge me not to say 
                         anything about what I had seen. 
                     
                     
                         " 'Sam wouldn't like it,' she said. 
                         'Besides, we can catch the thief easier 
                         if we keep quiet.' 
                     
                     
                         "Just then, who should walk in but 
                         John Wilson, the deputy sheriff. He 
                         happened to be passing by--going fish- 
                         ing, just as I was--and he saw the 
                         horse and wagon in the yard. It seems 
                         that the horse had started while I was 
                         in the stable, and had come near turn- 
                         ing the wagon over. Wilson had run 
                         in to keep him from doing it. Then he 
                     
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         had naturally looked into the stable, to 
                         see who was there. 
                     
                     
                         "He heard what Mrs. Bennett said 
                         about catching a thief, and that being 
                         in his line, he asked what had been 
                         stolen. 
                     
                     
                         "Mrs. Bennett started to lie to him, 
                         but she thought better of it, and told 
                         him the truth. 
                     
                     
                         "While she was doing it, I was tak- 
                         ing a look around, and what do you 
                         think I found? Why, I found Sam 
                         Bennett's coat, all covered with blood, 
                         lying on the stable floor. I didn't pick 
                         it up. I just stooped down and exam- 
                         ined it, to make sure that the stains 
                         were really blood. At the same time 
                         I saw other red marks on the floor, 
                         near the coat. 
                     
                     
                         "Then I managed to get Wilson aside 
                         for a moment, and I told him that there 
                         was something worse than robbery in 
                         the case. He took a look at the coat, 
                         and motioned to me to say nothing to 
                         Mrs. Bennett. 
                     
                     
                         " 'You'll get cold here,' says he to 
                         her, intending to get her out of the 
                         way, so that we could talk. 'Run into 
                         the house, and put a shawl on.' 
                     
                     
                         "She was dressed very thinly, and it 
                         was rather chilly. I had noticed that 
                         she was shivering. 
                     
                     
                         "When Wilson told her to go in and 
                         get a shawl, she went right away. Then 
                         he asked me what I knew about the 
                         matter, and I told him. 
                     
                     
                         " 'Bennett's been murdered,' said he. 
                         'Probably he came out here early, to 
                         hitch up the horse, and went to his 
                         money box. Some tramp, that had been 
                         sleeping in the barn, saw him, and killed 
                         him for the money. We'll find his body 
                         hidden in the barn.' 
                     
                     
                         " 'That theory won't work,' said I 
                         to him. 'These bloodstains are several 
                         hours old. Besides that, why did Ben- 
                         nett hitch up his horse with his head 
                         toward the stable doors? No, sir; this 
                         crime was committed last evening.

                         Bennett had just got back from some- 
                         where.' 
                     
                     
                         ''All this time I was doing some 
                         thinking. Why had Mrs. Bennett told 
                         me her husband had gone off to stay a 
                         day or two, when she knew that the 
                         horse and wagon were in the yard? 
                         What had she been doing in the stable? 
                         How did she account for the horse 
                         being there, without any driver? It 
                         wasn't reasonable to suppose that she 
                         had been out anywhere in the wagon, 
                         dressed as she was." 
                     
                     
                         "In short," said Nick, "you believed 
                         Mrs. Bennett guilty of the crime." 
                     
                     
                         "No, sir," replied Fairman, with 
                         something like a chuckle. "I'd been 
                         keeping my eyes open, and I'd seen one 
                         or two things. In the first place, the 
                         thief had ripped up several planks be- 
                         fore he'd found the right one. Mrs. 
                         Bennett knew where it was. 
                     
                     
                         "In the second place, she never could 
                         have ripped up those planks; it re- 
                         quired a man's strength. Now, here's 
                         the problem, and I think it's worthy of 
                         your genius, Mr. Carter: 
                     
                     
                         "Mrs. Bennett lied to me. She tried 
                         to keep the affair a secret. Her man- 
                         ner was calculated to excite suspicion 
                         in anybody. Her story about her hus- 
                         band's absence shows that she knew 
                         something had happened to him. 
                     
                     
                         "Yet she didn't do the deed; she 
                         screamed when she found that it had 
                         been done. How do you reconcile these 
                         facts?" 
                     
                     
                         "Let me have a few more facts first," 
                         said Nick. "What happened after she 
                         left you and Wilson?" 
                     
                     
                         "Several other men came by, and 
                         Wilson called them in. They were most 
                         of them strangers, who had come up 
                         here to fish. Wilson explained the case 
                         to them, and a search of the stable was 
                         begun. I didn't wait for it. I didn't 
                         have the time to waste." 
                     
                     
                         He looked knowingly at Nick as he 
                         said these words. I could not fathom 
                     
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         his meaning, but Nick seemed to under- 
                         stand. 
                     
                     
                         "I told Wilson about your being 
                         here," Fairman continued. "I made 
                         him promise not to disturb things; to 
                         hunt for the body, but not to move it 
                         in case he found it, till you arrived. 
                         Of course he won't find it." 
                     
                     
                         "Why not?" I asked. 
                     
                     
                         "Because it isn't there," he replied, 
                         with a wink at Nick. 
                     
                     
                         I was nettled to be treated in this 
                         way by a yokel. Yet I could not deny 
                         that he was a shrewd fellow. 
                     
                     
                         "I see your point," said Nick. "You 
                         think that the murder was committed 
                         somewhere else, and that the bloody 
                         coat was put there just as a blind." 
                     
                     
                         "Precisely!" cried Fairman. "Why 
                         should the murderer take pains to hide 
                         the body, and leave the coat in plain 
                         sight?" 
                     
                     
                         "There's something in that," said the 
                         detective. "Did you have any further 
                         conversation with Mrs. Bennett?" 
                     
                     
                         "No; she hadn't got back from the 
                         house when I left. I hurried away be- 
                         cause I hoped to catch you before you 
                         left Marvin's." 
                     
                     
                         That was the substance of Fairman's 
                         story as it was told to us as we hurried 
                         toward the Bennett house. 
                     
                     
                         Half a dozen men were talking ex- 
                         citedly in the road before the house as 
                         we came up. Wilson was one of them. 
                         Others could be seen in the yard before 
                         the stable door. 
                     
                     
                         "Well, Wilson, did you find the 
                         body?" asked Fairman, as we came up. 
                         "No; is that Mr. Carter?" 
                     
                     
                         All eyes were turned upon the great 
                         detective. 
                     
                     
                         "That's the man," said Fairman, 
                         with the air of one who is exhibiting a 
                         trophy. 
                     
                     
                         "I'm glad to see you, sir," said Wil- 
                         son, walking up to Nick. "This is a 
                         very strange affair." 
                     
                     
                         "From what this gentleman has told

                         me, I should judge that it is," replied 
                         the detective. 
                     
                     
                         "Where is Mrs. Bennett?" 
                     
                     
                         "That's the strangest part of it!" ex- 
                         claimed Wilson. "She has disap- 
                         peared!" 
                     
                     
                         "You're a smart man, I don't think," 
                         said Fairman. "Why did you let her 
                         get away?" 
                     
                     
                         "I never thought of her going," pro- 
                         tested Wilson. 
                     
                     
                         "It's natural enough," sneered Fair- 
                         man. "Circumstances are against her." 
                     
                     
                         "Now, look here," rejoined Wilson 
                         warmly; "I don't set up to be a detec- 
                         tive, but I hope I've got common sense. 
                         Here's a woman who has lived in this 
                         community all her life, and is known to 
                         be a good Christian and a loving wife. 
                         Don't you try to tell me that she killed 
                         her husband. I know her too well to 
                         believe you. She had nothing to do 
                         with it." 
                     
                     
                         "Then why has she run away?" 
                     
                     
                         "I don't believe she has run away." 
                     
                     
                         "Then what's become of her?" 
                     
                     
                         Wilson threw up his hands with a 
                         gesture of utter bewilderment. 
                     
                     
                         "Have you searched the house and 
                         barn?" asked Nick. 
                     
                     
                         "We've searched everywhere," re- 
                         sponded Wilson, with something like a 
                         groan. "We can't find a trace of her 
                         or of Sam Bennett's body." 
                     
                     
                         "If you'll allow me," said Nick, "I'll 
                         take a look around, the premises. 
                         Meanwhile permit me to suggest, if 
                         there's any place where Mrs. Bennett 
                         would be likely to go, that you send 
                         there." 
                     
                     
                         "That's what I was about to do," 
                         Wilson replied. "These five men are 
                         going around to all the houses near 
                         here." 
                     
                     
                         "Has she any relatives in the neigh- 
                         borhood?" 
                     
                     
                         "No; she has a brother living about 
                         three miles down the road." 
                     
                     
                         "Who occupied this house besides 
                         Mr. and Mrs. Bennett?" 
                     
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         "Nobody is here now. They have 
                         lived alone since their daughter Jennie 
                         was married, about three months ago." 
                     
                     
                         Nick, Fairman, and I walked toward 
                         the stable. Wilson and the other men 
                         went upon their several errands. 
                     
                     
                         We were assured by a man named 
                         Hamlin, who was on guard in the stable, 
                         that nothing had been disturbed. Ham- 
                         lin was a sort of unofficial deputy of 
                         Wilson's. 
                     
                     
                         Nick made a rapid general survey of 
                         the place, glanced into the barn, which 
                         was reached by a door from the stable, 
                         and then turned his attention to the 
                         bloodstains. 
                     
                     
                         There were some small, irregular 
                         splashes on the floor, and then a line 
                         of drops leading direct to the spot 
                         where the coat lay. 
                     
                     
                         It was a much-worn garment, spread 
                         flat upon the floor, with the lining up- 
                         ward. The stains were all on the lin- 
                         ing, and close together. They repre- 
                         sented a considerable quantity of 
                         blood. 
                     
                     
                         As Nick rose from beside the coat, I 
                         saw a peculiar smile upon his face. 
                     
                     
                         "Here's something that will interest 
                         you," he said to Fairman. 
                     
                     
                         Between his thumb and finger he 
                         held half a dozen short, gray hairs. 
                     
                     
                         "That fits my theory exactly!" cried 
                         Fairman. "Bennett's head has rested 
                         on that coat. His hair was gray, and 
                         he wore it about that length. He must 
                         have been killed by a blow on the head, 
                         and then this coat was wrapped around 
                         the fatal wound to prevent the blood 
                         from staining something else. 
                     
                     
                         "My belief is that the body was car- 
                         ried in that wagon from the place 
                         where the crime was committed to the 
                         place where the murderer has concealed 
                         the corpse. Then, probably, the horse 
                         was turned loose, and wandered here." 
                     
                     
                         "There is evidence in support of that 
                         last view," said Nick. "I suppose your 
                         sharp eyes noted the wagon tracks in 
                         the street and in the yard." 
                     
                 
             
             
                 
                 A Rustic Rival 77 
                 
                     
                     
                         "You bet; I noticed them right 
                         away," replied Fairman, with an em- 
                         phatic nod. "The tracks show that the 
                         wagon must have grazed one of the 
                         gateposts, and that the horse had 
                         strayed about the yard before coming 
                         to a halt. I can swear that there was 
                         nobody in the wagon when it came into 
                         this yard." 
                     
                     
                         "As to the crime having been com- 
                         mitted elsewhere," said Nick, "what do 
                         you say to this?" 
                     
                     
                         He pointed to a broken bottle on the 
                         floor. It had been a large and heavy 
                         bottle. The bottom of it, and a few 
                         fragments, lay near those bloodstains 
                         which were farthest from the coat. The 
                         neck of the bottle was some distance 
                         away, in a corner. 
                     
                     
                         Nick picked up the bottom of the 
                         bottle and showed a faint stain of blood 
                         upon a ragged edge of the glass. 
                         Fairman was staggered. 
                     
                     
                         "It looks as if he had been knocked 
                         down with that bottle," he admitted. 
                         "Perhaps I was wrong. In that case, 
                         the body was certainly carried away in 
                         the wagon." 
                     
                     
                         "You noticed that a piece had been 
                         torn out of the lining of the coat?" 
                     
                     
                         "Yes; but that might have been done 
                         long ago." 
                     
                     
                         "I do not think so," said Nick; and 
                         he proceeded to tear out another piece. 
                     
                     
                         The first had been a strip about two 
                         inches wide and a foot long. Nick put 
                         into his pocket that which he had torn 
                         off. 
                     
                     
                         "The murderer probably used that to 
                         wipe his hands on," commented Fair- 
                         man. 
                     
                     
                         Nick made no reply. He was scan- 
                         ning the stable floor closely. At last he 
                         walked toward a small and rough door 
                         which opened from the rear of the 
                         stable. 
                     
                     
                         "Here are more bloodstains," he said. 
                     
                     
                         We approached just as Nick opened 
                         the door. There were stains upon the 
                         threshold, though they were very faint, 
                     
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         scarcely perceptible, in fact. The prin- 
                         cipal one was nearly round, and some- 
                         what smaller than a watch. 
                     
                     
                         "Let's see what we can find in this 
                         direction," said Nick, leading the way 
                         into a little garden behind the stable. 
                     
                     
                         "Here are a man's tracks!" exclaimed 
                         Fairman. "They're not Bennett's; 
                         they're too small. He had enormous 
                         feet." 
                     
                     
                         "You'll find several men's tracks if 
                         you look closely," remarked Nick. "The 
                         searching party seems to have been out 
                         here." 
                     
                     
                         There was a path leading toward a 
                         field. The ground was very soft, and 
                         footprints could be easily traced. 
                     
                     
                         There was one line of them that was 
                         plainly visible. It led along the path. 
                         I made out that he who had made those 
                         footprints had been running rapidly. 
                     
                     
                         Considering the ease with which they 
                         could be seen, I was surprised to ob- 
                         serve the extreme caution with which 
                         Nick proceeded. 
                     
                     
                         After he had gone about fifty yards, 
                         however, he went on with more confi- 
                         dence. We passed into the field, which 
                         was partly overgrown with grass, and 
                         partly bare. 
                     
                     
                         Crossing this, we came to a fringe 
                         of trees. Here Nick made quite an ex- 
                         tended search. He went down to the 
                         bank of a brook which flowed beyond 
                         the trees, and I followed him, but I saw 
                         no tracks there. Then we returned; 
                         and presently Nick found what he was 
                         seeking. It was a box made of tinned 
                         iron. There had been a padlock on it, 
                         but it had been wrenched away. The 
                         box was empty. 
                     
                     
                         "You've tracked the thief," said Fair- 
                         man, in envious admiration. "That's 
                         Bennett's cash box. beyond a doubt." 
                     
                     
                         Nick said nothing. He began to walk 
                         rapidly back toward the stable. 
                     
                     
                         When he reached the little door he 
                         paused for a moment, and, naturally, 
                         Fairman and I came to a halt. The 
                         schoolmaster turned about, and set his 
                     
                 
             
             
                 
                 78 Detective Story Magazine 
                 
                     
                     
                         back against the stable. Then he sprang 
                         away, uttering a loud cry, and point- 
                         ing to the field. 
                     
                     
                         I looked, and saw a woman running. 
                         Just as my eye lighted upon her, she 
                         dodged behind some bushes on the edge 
                         of the garden. 
                     
                     
                         "It's Mrs. Bennett!" cried Fairman. 
                         "She's coming back." 
                     
                     
                         "Don't let her know that you saw 
                         her," said Nick, and he drew us into 
                         the stable. 
                     
                     
                         We watched cautiously from a win- 
                         dow. The woman approached the 
                         house, shielding herself from observa- 
                         tion as well as she could. No one saw 
                         her but us. She passed on the other 
                         side of the barn. We walked hurriedly 
                         through the stable, crossed the yard, 
                         and entered the kitchen of the house, 
                         just as she came in by a door on the 
                         opposite side. The room was an L, and 
                         occupied the full width of it. 
                     
                     
                         "Good morning, Mrs. Bennett," said 
                         Nick. "Where have you been?" 
                     
                     
                         "Well, that's cool," she rejoined. "If 
                         it's any of your business, I've been 
                         down to the barn, looking out for the 
                         cows." 
                     
                     
                         "You don't seem to take much inter- 
                         est in this robbery." 
                     
                     
                         "Why should I? We'll never see 
                         the money again. It's gone, and there's 
                         the end of it. Some of those pesky 
                         tramps have stolen it. I should think 
                         the law might do something to protect 
                         us from those critters." 
                     
                     
                         "Where is your husband?" 
                     
                     
                         "I dunno. He's gone off somewhere. 
                         He'll be back in a day or two." 
                     
                     
                         "Who hitched up your horse this 
                         morning?" 
                     
                     
                         "The tramp, I reckon. He probably 
                         intended to steal him, but was fright- 
                         ened away. I heard the horse in the 
                         yard, and went out to take care of him." 
                     
                     
                         "Mrs. Bennett," said Fairman, break- 
                         ing in, "why do you act in this way? 
                         A crime has been committed, and you 
                         seem disposed to shield the criminal. 
                     
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         Don't you know that we have reason 
                         to believe that your husband has met 
                         with foul play?" 
                     
                     
                         "You mean he's been murdered?" 
                         she cried. 
                     
                     
                         Fairman bowed his head. 
                     
                     
                         "I don't believe it!" she exclaimed; 
                         and then, falling into a chair, she buried 
                         her face in her hands, while her frame 
                         shook as with sobs. 
                     
                     
                         At first I pitied her, but, on closer 
                         inspection, I decided that she was only 
                         pretending to cry. 
                     
                     
                         The woman's heartlessness shocked 
                         me. That she was an accomplice in the 
                         crime was to me a matter of certainty. 
                         Her clumsy efforts to account for her 
                         husband's absence, and her absurd as- 
                         sumption of the manner of an innocent 
                         person ignorant of the facts would 
                         have excited my pity if the enormity of 
                         her crime had not made them abhor- 
                         rent. 
                     
                     
                         I tried to question her, but she would 
                         not speak. Nothing could induce her 
                         to move from that chair or to take her 
                         hands from her face. 
                     
                     
                         Nick paid no attention to the 
                         woman. 
                     
                     
                         "I'm going over to the railroad sta- 
                         tion," said he to me. "I want to send 
                         telegrams to the surrounding towns, 
                         giving a description of the criminal, 
                         with directions for his arrest." 
                     
                     
                         "A description!" I cried. "How can 
                         you give that?" 
                     
                     
                         "I can furnish one that is infallible," 
                         said Nick, with a smile. 
                     
                     
                         "There was something in his foot- 
                         prints-" 
                     
                     
                         Nick shook his head. 
                     
                     
                         "I never saw any that were more 
                         commonplace." 
                     
                     
                         "Then I'm all at sea." 
                     
                     
                         Fairman's face took on a strange ex- 
                         pression, made up of surprise, disap- 
                         pointment, and a dozen other emotions. 
                         He followed Nick to the door. 
                     
                     
                         "You have learned about Martin 
                     
                 
             
             
                 
                 A Rustic Rival 79 
                 
                     
                     
                         Heywood," he said, in a low, anxious 
                         voice. 
                     
                     
                         "Never heard of him," said Nick. 
                         "Who is he?" 
                     
                     
                         "This woman's brother, and the prin- 
                         cipal in this crime, beyond a doubt. 
                         Don't try to deceive me. You are on 
                         his track." 
                     
                     
                         "I may be," said Nick; "but, upon 
                         my word, I didn't know it." 
                     
                     
                         "Didn't know it!" 
                     
                     
                         "No; what makes you think he's the 
                         man?" 
                     
                     
                         "He's Bennett's only enemy. There 
                         was a lawsuit. Everybody around here 
                         knows that Bennett's testimony would 
                         have cost Heywood nine-tenths of all 
                         he's worth. He had testified once 
                         against his brother-in-law, and Hey- 
                         wood threatened to kill him then. 
                     
                     
                         "The case went against Heywood, 
                         but, on appeal, a new trial was ordered. 
                         The case was to be called to-morrow. 
                     
                     
                         "Wilson had the summons for Ben- 
                         nett in his pocket. He wasn't going 
                         fishing; he was coming here to serve 
                         it." 
                     
                     
                         "Rather early in the morning," said 
                         Nick. 
                     
                     
                         "Yes; Wilson was afraid Bennett 
                         would evade it. As a matter of fact, 
                         he was afraid for his life if he testi- 
                         fied." 
                     
                     
                         "And you think that Heywood killed 
                         him to suppress his testimony?" 
                     
                     
                         "Yes; is there any other explanation 
                         of this woman's conduct? She knows 
                         her brother did the deed. She's trying 
                         to shield him." 
                     
                     
                         "That's a promising theory," said 
                         Nick. "Suppose you go to Heywood's 
                         house and try to work it up, while I go 
                         and send my telegrams." 
                     
                     
                         "Telegrams? Do you think Hey- 
                         wood has run away?" 
                     
                     
                         "I don't know anything about it." 
                     
                     
                         Fairman was puzzled, but not more 
                         than I was. 
                     
                     
                         "You seem to be guessing," said the 
                         schoolmaster, at last. "You discover 
                     
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         evidence accidentally. I've heard a 
                         good deal about your luck, and now I 
                         believe it. 
                     
                     
                         "I'll tell you one piece of evidence 
                         that you've turned up. There's a way 
                         to Heywood's house along that brook 
                         where you found the box. What do 
                         you think of that?" 
                     
                     
                         "It's quite interesting," said Nick. "I 
                         suppose Mrs. Bennett ran away to see 
                         her brother?" 
                     
                     
                         "Of course." 
                     
                     
                         "Very natural." 
                     
                     
                         Nick nodded an adieu to Fairman, 
                         and walked away in the direction of 
                         the railroad station. I followed him. 
                         As we went down the road, we saw 
                         Fairman going the other way, probably 
                         toward Heywood's. There was nobody 
                         to watch Mrs. Bennett, unless the men 
                         who loitered about the stable yard 
                         could see her through the windows. 
                     
                     
                         Nick sent his telegrams, and we 
                         spent the forenoon waiting around the 
                         station for replies. 
                     
                     
                         None had come at twelve o'clock. 
                         We decided to go to Farmer Marvin's 
                         for dinner, crossed the railroad tracks, 
                         and struck into the road, when sud- 
                         denly Nick went down upon his knees, 
                         and closely examined the ground. 
                     
                     
                         I had no doubt that he had recog- 
                         nized a footprint, but none was visible 
                         to me. Nick was surely on the trail. 
                         He followed it back to the railroad, 
                         then up the path, beside the tracks, 
                         until at last he stopped beside some 
                         freight cars that were stalled there. 
                     
                     
                         After several efforts he opened the 
                         door of one of them. As he did so, I 
                         noticed a faint mark of blood on the 
                         wood just under the door. 
                     
                     
                         The light that struck into the car 
                         shone full into the face of a frowzy 
                         tramp who sat on a sackful of mer- 
                         chandise, and stared stupidly at us. 
                     
                     
                         His hand rested upon the head of the 
                         most miserable dog that ever I saw. 
                         The animal was a mongrel of a thou- 
                         sand low breeds at once. It had suf- 
                     
                 
             
             
                 
                 80 Detective Story Magazine 
                 
                     
                     
                         fered in its wanderings even more than 
                         its master. I observed with pity that 
                         the creature was lean with hunger, and 
                         that one of its feet had been badly hurt, 
                         and was bandaged. 
                     
                     
                         It offered a feeble resistance--the 
                         best of which the faithful brute was 
                         capable--when Nick sprang into the car 
                         and laid his hand on the man's shoul- 
                         der. 
                     
                     
                         "You are under arrest," was all the 
                         detective said. 
                     
                     
                         The tramp swore a round oath, but 
                         he made no resistance. He took the 
                         wretched dog in his arms, and tenderly 
                         carried it out of the car. Once upon 
                         the ground, the dog ran well enough 
                         with three legs. 
                     
                     
                         There was a rude hotel opposite the 
                         station. Nick put the tramp and the 
                         dog into a room there, set the landlord 
                         to guard them, and called to me to fol- 
                         low. 
                     
                     
                         "We have the criminal now," he said. 
                         "It's time to look for the body of the 
                         victim." 
                     
                     
                         "And for the money," said I. "The 
                         tramp had none when you searched 
                         him." 
                     
                     
                         "We shall find that, too," rejoined 
                         Nick. 
                     
                     
                         As we walked along, I plied him with 
                         questions about the proof against the 
                         man whom he had arrested. All I could 
                         get out of him was the somewhat irrele- 
                         vant remark that he had a right to 
                         make an arrest, for Wilson had au- 
                         thorized him to act as a deputy. 
                     
                     
                         We came at last to a very nice house, 
                         nearly two miles beyond the station. To 
                         my surprise, we found Fairman at the 
                         gate. 
                     
                     
                         "What does Heywood say?" asked 
                         Nick. 
                     
                     
                         So that was Heywood's house. I had 
                         not known it before. 
                     
                     
                         "He won't talk," replied Fairman; 
                         "but his manner is conclusive. That 
                         man is guilty." 
                     
                     
                         Heywood appeared at this moment. 
                     
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         "This is all foolishness about Sam 
                         Bennett being murdered," he said. 
                         "And, as for my having anything to 
                         do with it, that's worse yet. I've got 
                         nothing agin' Bennett." 
                     
                     
                         "Since when have you been recon- 
                         ciled?" demanded Nick. 
                     
                     
                         The man bit his lip, but did not 
                         answer. 
                     
                     
                         "Now, Mr. Heywood," said Nick, 
                         "look right down in the dirt at your 
                         feet and you will see the track of Mr. 
                         Bennett's wagon, made last evening. 
                         He came over to see you, and, in my 
                         opinion, he's here yet. I'm going to 
                         search your house." 
                     
                     
                         Heywood groaned. 
                     
                     
                         "You've got the authority, have 
                         you?" 
                     
                     
                         Nick nodded. Of course, it was a 
                         "bluff." 
                     
                     
                         Heywood turned toward the house. 
                     
                     
                         "Sam!" he yelled. "Come out here. 
                         There's no use of staying in there any 
                         longer." 
                     
                     
                         Presently the elongated form of 
                         Samuel Bennett appeared at the door. 
                     
                     
                         "Well, I swear!" ejaculated Fair- 
                         man. 
                     
                     
                         "Good day, Mr. Bennett," said Nick. 
                         "I was told that you were murdered, 
                         but I didn't believe it. I'm not yet sure 
                         whether you've been robbed." 
                     
                     
                         "No, I ha'n't lost nothin'," growled 
                         Bennett. "I took all my money out'n 
                         that hidin' place last evening. I'd seen 
                         a tramp critter hanging 'round my barn, 
                         and I was afeared." 
                     
                     
                         "He was in the barn when you 
                         hitched up your horse last night," said 
                         Nick. "He watched you through a 
                         knot hole in the door between the barn 
                         and the stable. I saw the prints of his 
                         muddy boots on the floor. He had to 
                         stand on tiptoe to see through the hole, 
                         and he supported himself by partly 
                         gripping a dusty beam over the door. 
                     
                     
                         "He saw you when you went to your 
                         bank, but he didn't know that you took 
                         your money out. After you were gone,

                         he ripped up the floor and stole the 
                         empty box. 
                     
                     
                         "Meanwhile his dog stepped on a 
                         piece of an old bottle, and cut his foot. 
                         Then he limped over to your coat, and 
                         lay down on it while he nursed his 
                         wound. The bloodstains led to the 
                         theory that you had been murdered. 
                         Our friend Mr. Fairman was impolite 
                         enough to say that some of the dog's 
                         hair looked very much like yours. 
                     
                     
                         "After a study of the case, I sent 
                         some telegrams requesting the police of 
                         neighboring towns to arrest a tramp 
                         with a three-legged dog. I subsequently 
                         arrested him myself. I also recovered 
                         your box, by following the trail of three 
                         legs out of four--for I knew, of course, 
                         that the dog was so badly hurt that he 
                         would hold up one of his feet. 
                     
                     
                         "Your wife's disappearance this 
                         morning, and her subsequent demeanor 
                         could be explained only on the theory 
                         that she had come over here to see you, 
                     
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         and had found you all right. There- 
                         fore I came to seek you here. I sup- 
                         pose she persuaded you not to testify 
                         against her brother, and that you in- 
                         tended to hide at his house to avoid 
                         service of the summons. Am I right?" 
                     
                     
                         "Yes, blast you!" said Bennett. 
                     
                     
                         "And the horse?" queried Nick. 
                         "Did he run away?" 
                     
                     
                         "Yes; confound him. I had just 
                         hitched him up this morning, intending 
                         to take him back before it was light, 
                         when he bolted. I went after him, but 
                         lost the track, and when I at last got in 
                         sight of the house, there were a lot of 
                         people around, and I didn't dare to go 
                         in." 
                     
                     
                         Nick turned to Fairman. 
                     
                     
                         "I'm obliged to you for a pleasant 
                         and novel experience," he said. "Will 
                         you join us on our fishing trip this 
                         afternoon?" 
                     
                     
                         "No!" growled Fairman. "I'm going 
                         home, to kick myself." 
                     
                 
                 
                     
                         LOSES HIS FALSE TEETH WHILE IN JAIL

                         on by apprehension that the owner will starve to death in the meanwhile, 
                         is searching for a set of false teeth, the property of W. Kennedy, of Johnsons, 
                         Colorado, who is reported to be living on bread and milk while the search is in 
                         progress. 
                     
                     
                         The teeth were lost by Kennedy while he was in the city jail, following an 
                         incursion into "wet" Cheyenne from "dry" Colorado, and Kennedy complains that 
                         he hasn't the price of a new set. He relates his woe in the following letter to 
                         Chief of Police Embery: 
                     
                     
                         Chief: Doubtless you remember me and doubtless you don't, but I'm the guy what lost 
                         a pair of false teeth while I was in your bull pen. I didn't know that I had lost them until 
                         I got home and started on steak and potatoes. Now I won't be able to eat until I get them 
                         or part with ten ($10) dollars, which I haven't got. Yours in pain, W. Kennedy. 
                     
                     
                         Johnsons, Colo. 
                     
                     
                         Chief Embery has had the jail searched and has instructed the police to 
                         search all other inmates of the jail at the time Kennedy was a prisoner there 
                         that they may be able to locate the teeth, but no trace of them has been found.

                     by  H. Ellis Davis  
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         I HAD arrived the day before for 
                         some late fishing; but as the 
                         weather was raw and gusty, I re- 
                         mained inside my little one-room 
                         lodge and sorted tackle. 
                     
                     
                         I had built this camp several years 
                         before, and, two or three times each 
                         year, I came here to fish or hunt ducks. 
                         It was two miles up the winding bayou 
                         from the Mississippi Sound, and stood 
                         on a little eminence surrounded by 
                         scrub oak, with the somber swamp 
                         stretching away at its back. It was, 
                         perhaps, a dreary, lonesome spot; but 
                         to me, a busy practicing physician of 
                         New Orleans, the days spent here alone, 
                         relaxing my mind, exercising my body, 
                         were welcomed periods of rest. 
                     
                     
                         On this trip, I had promised myself 
                         I would do something I had wanted to 
                         do for a long time--visit an old savant, 
                         a Doctor Hetzel, who lived across the 
                         sound on Gull Island. From the mouth 
                         of my bayou, his big, white house, 
                         which, except for one servant, he oc- 
                         cupied alone, could be plainly seen on 
                         the western extremity of the island, a 
                         mere strip of sand running for miles 
                         along the outer edge of the sound. 
                     
                     
                         Living the life of a recluse, Hetzel 
                         was hard to approach. But I had read 
                         several of his books with interest, and 
                         had a desire to meet their author. 
                         Those on vivisection, especially, were 
                         written with a boldness and finish far 
                         beyond anything by his contemporaries, 
                         showing throughout, where a fixed end 
                         was to be reached, the ruthless fanati- 
                         cism of the true Teuton. 
                     
                     
                         Wealthy, seclusive, a mysterious 
                     
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         family of scientists, the Hetzels had 
                         lived on Gull Island since beyond the 
                         memory of the oldest natives, and this 
                         old man was the last of his line. Tradi- 
                         tion had it that out of the East had 
                         come a great ship with the first of them, 
                         and the material for the big stone house, 
                         and back into the East it had gone, 
                         never to return. 
                     
                     
                         As the dusky twilight began to creep 
                         into the room, and I bent lower and 
                         lower over my work, suddenly, without 
                         hail or knock, the door opened and a 
                         man entered--a man stooped, white- 
                         locked, wrinkled. 
                     
                     
                         Trying to show no surprise at his 
                         sudden appearance, as I was seated on 
                         the floor, I pushed a chair toward him 
                         with my foot and invited him to sit 
                         down. 
                     
                     
                         Listlessly, he sank into the chair and 
                         sat there in the half light, regarding me 
                         with an expressionless stare, his lips 
                         forming words and moving without 
                         sound, as is often the case with very 
                         old people. At last he spoke, and I 
                         was surprised to find his voice clear and 
                         strong, with scarcely a quaver. 
                     
                     
                         "Doctor Tyson, who I am makes no 
                         difference, but what I am about to re- 
                         late, if I can force myself into the tell- 
                         ing, will shock the entire civilized 
                         world." 
                     
                     
                         Rising nervously from his chair, he 
                         several times paced the length of the 
                         room; then: 
                     
                     
                         "But I cannot shake from my mind 
                         the doubt; cannot remain decided 
                         whether or not I should tell you and let 
                         the world take its action in the matter. 
                     
                 
             
             
                 
                 The Captive Soul 83 
                 
                     
                     
                         "I am going mad! Yes, I fully re- 
                         alize, now, that my reason is leaving 
                         me. The doubt, the horrible doubt, in- 
                         flicts a greater strain than the mind of 
                         any man can withstand! I cannot de- 
                         cide whether I should divulge what I 
                         know, and tell the world where to find 
                         the proof of my statement, or remain 
                         silent. But when I am wholly de- 
                         mented, when I am confined to a room 
                         with a keeper, then my uncontrolled 
                         babblings will disclose my secret. But 
                         who would consider the wild raging of 
                         a madman? 
                     
                     
                         "Then, another uncertainty is mad- 
                         ness itself, the uncertainty as to 
                         whether I should have killed him--that 
                         sorcerer who, by the black art of sci- 
                         ence, can hold forever captive the souls 
                         of men and women." 
                     
                     
                         The man had now worked himself 
                         into a frenzy, and the palsied hand 
                         clawed again and again at the white 
                         locks straggling over the shrunken, 
                         leathery brow. Becoming somewhat 
                         alarmed, I said sharply: 
                     
                     
                         "Here, old man, calm yourself! 
                         Come, sit down and tell me what you 
                         wish me to know." 
                     
                     
                         He turned on me fiercely: 
                     
                     
                         " 'Old man!' And how old do you 
                         think I am?" 
                     
                     
                         Taken aback, I did not answer, and 
                         he continued: 
                     
                     
                         "I am not thirty years old! A man 
                         under thirty; yet, my hair is as white 
                         as yours will be at eighty. My body 
                         has shrunk to a mere shadow of its 
                         former bulk. Sleep has almost deserted 
                         me; for, when my tortured soul would 
                         rest, I no sooner begin to sink into a 
                         happy unconsciousness than I start up 
                         with the shriek: 'Why did I not kill 
                         him?' Or, in the grip of a nervous, 
                         clammy sweat, gasp in horror: 'Sup- 
                         pose I had?' 
                     
                     
                         "Already I catch myself at times mut- 
                         tering my thoughts aloud, and, when 
                         I meet people, they turn as I pass to 
                         watch me with suspicion. It is not long, 
                     
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         not long before I will be a driveling, 
                         senile idiot--no, a shrieking maniac! 
                     
                     
                         "Yet, I linger within the sound of the 
                         lap-lap of the waves that seem to beat 
                         upon my soul; for, from them, there 
                         ever comes a voice that holds me." 
                     
                     
                         Getting to my feet, I took him firmly 
                         by the arm and pushed him back into 
                         the chair. 
                     
                     
                         "Calm yourself," I told him. "If you 
                         like, it needn't go any further, but you 
                         must tell me what is on your mind 
                         that's troubling you so much. I might 
                         be able to help you." 
                     
                     
                         Suddenly, he half leaped from his 
                         chair, leaning forward toward me, his 
                         bony, clenched fist thrust almost into 
                         my face. 
                     
                     
                         "Yes, I will tell you! By the heav- 
                         ens, I will tell you, and may the re- 
                         sponsibility rest where it belongs!" 
                     
                     
                         He got to his feet and advanced to- 
                         ward me, thrusting his face forward, 
                         so that I fell back. 
                     
                     
                         "I could have killed him!" he hissed. 
                         "My hands were about his throat--and 
                         he slipped from my clutch." His long 
                         fingers worked convulsively. "But I 
                         could have killed him!" 
                     
                     
                         Almost in desperation, I took him by 
                         his two hands and again made him sit 
                         down. Then, standing in front of him, 
                         still holding his hands, I said to him: 
                     
                     
                         "Look here! If you expect to tell me 
                         your story, begin at the beginning. I 
                         know that some horrible thing has hap- 
                         pened to you; but get behind it. Tell 
                         me about yourself before it occurred. 
                         Have you always lived here? If not, 
                         where did you come from? What did 
                         you do for a living? Now sit there for 
                         a minute and think it over calmly be- 
                         fore you begin." 
                     
                     
                         For a long time he was silent, looking 
                         vacantly in front of him; while I again 
                         took my place on the floor and resumed 
                         my interrupted work. Then, looking 
                         forlornly down at himself, he began : 
                     
                     
                         "It is hard to realize that, instead of

                         this bunch of ragged nerves, I was once 
                         a strong man." 
                     
                     
                         Pausing, he remained silent so long 
                         that I laid aside my tackle and, sitting 
                         with arms clasped about my knees, 
                         prompted him: 
                     
                     
                         "What was your occupation?" 
                     
                     
                         "I was a lawyer, practicing in Mo- 
                         bile, the junior member of a firm of 
                         three. Because I had been doing a good 
                         deal of extra work, and was pretty well 
                         run down, the senior member persuaded 
                         me to take a week's rest, and come 
                         down here on the sound to the little 
                         village of Cody, with the hope of re- 
                         gaining my appetite. As I have always 
                         had an aversion to any large body of 
                         water, I tried to beg off; but he was 
                         obstinate. 
                     
                     
                         "One afternoon, shortly after I had 
                         arrived, while floundering about in the 
                         shallow water, ankle-deep in the slimy 
                         ooze that covers the bottom, trying to 
                         persuade myself that I was enjoying a 
                         swim, a clumsy old scow, filled with a 
                         crowd of laughing boys and girls, 
                         swung slowly out from the near-by 
                         wharf. 
                     
                     
                         " 'Come and join us!' called a young 
                         man I had met at the hotel. 'We are 
                         going to pole out to deep water, where 
                         we can have some sure-enough swim- 
                         ming and diving.' 
                     
                     
                         "Scrambling aboard, I was intro- 
                         duced to the party; but it was with a 
                         sinking sensation that I noticed the 
                         water growing deeper and deeper, the 
                         long poles with which we were pro- 
                         pelled becoming more and more sub- 
                         merged, as we moved slowly out. 
                     
                     
                         "Then, one of the girls, Vivian 
                         White, rose from where she was 
                         crouched on the bottom, and made her 
                         way to the bow. As she stood there, 
                         poised for a dive, she seemed to me 
                         like some goddess of the waves. A rub-

                         was slender and graceful; the wind 
                     
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         whipped her short skirt about strong, 
                         shapely limbs. 
                     
                     
                         "For an instant, her arms were 
                         raised high above her head; then, deep, 
                         deep into the black water, she plunged, 
                         and I shuddered as it closed above her. 
                         But in an instant she reappeared, and, 
                         swimming to the side of the boat where 
                         I sat, held out her hand to me. I 
                         helped her aboard for another dive, 
                         and, from then on I thought of noth- 
                         ing but her. Devoting myself entirely 
                         to her service, I did not enter the water 
                         that afternoon. 
                     
                     
                         "From that time, I became her ad- 
                         mirer, her follower, her ardent suitor. 
                     
                     
                         "She was a good sailor, and often 
                         took me with her in her crazy little cat- 
                         boat. But the haunting fear of the 
                         water still clung to me, and many times 
                         I begged her to give up sailing. She 
                         just laughed, however, and my misgiv- 
                         ings seemed only to amuse her. 
                     
                     
                         "It was now time for me to return to 
                         my work, but I arranged for another 
                         month. For I passionately loved this 
                         sailor girl from an up-State town; and 
                         at last, one moonlight night on the 
                         beach, I held her in my arms and made 
                         her acknowledge that she also loved. 
                     
                     
                         "The next morning, I met her as 
                         usual; but soon she sailed away alone 
                         in her little boat, straight out across 
                         the sound, leaving me disconsolate on 
                         the end of the wharf, to follow the 
                         white sail with my eyes until it became 
                         a tiny speck, and then disappeared al- 
                         together, seeming to mingle with the 
                         rippling, oily water. 
                     
                     
                         "After moping about for an hour or 
                         two, I began to notice black clouds 
                         rolling and banking in the southern sky, 
                         and, landsman though I was, I knew 
                         that one of those sudden, fierce squalls 
                         was gathering, and I was filled with 
                         terror.

                         Vivian, in case her own little boat 
                         should come to harm; but each, in turn,

                         shook his head. Drenched by the spray, 
                         madly I raced up and down the beach, 
                         across which the wind had now begun 
                         whipping in fierce gusts, vainly scan- 
                         ning the horizon for a sight of her re- 
                         turning sail. All that met my straining 
                         gaze was the water, now broken into 
                         choppy waves, and a distant haze that 
                         was the long, low outline of Gull Island 
                         lying on the outer edge of the sound, 
                         with a tiny white spot at its western 
                         end, the home of the old scientist, 
                         Hetzel. 
                     
                     
                         "That night, a fishing smack, beating 
                         her way in before the gale, towed be- 
                         hind her Vivian's little, overturned boat, 
                         which had been picked up near that 
                         dangerous pass between Gull and Pinto 
                         Islands, where the incoming and out- 
                         going tides surge through like a mill 
                         race. Here, as you know, many lives 
                         have been lost, and the victims' bodies 
                         never recovered, presumably having 
                         been swept out into the gulf. 
                     
                     
                         "At dawn, the wind having gone 
                         down, I persuaded a boatman to take 
                         me in his gasoline launch to look for 
                         Vivian. As she was such a strong 
                         swimmer, I was in hopes that she might 
                         have swum to one of the islands. When 
                         we rounded the western end of Gull 
                         Island, and entered the pass, the wind 
                         and waves hurled against our bow, 
                         while the outgoing tide surged around 
                         us in a torrent. 
                     
                     
                         "Suddenly, with a wheezy grunt, the 
                         engine died, and our launch, tossed 
                         around by a big wave against its bow, 
                         lay in the trough of the sea. A crest 
                         broke over us, half filling the boat with 
                         water, and it seemed about to sink. 
                         With a yell to me to follow, the boat- 
                         man kicked off his shoes and swam di- 
                         agonally across to a point on the east- 
                         ern end of Pinto. But the old terror 
                         of the water, which had been crowded 
                         out of my mind during our search, now 
                         returned to grip me. Crouching in the 
                         bottom, I screamed in an uncontrolled 
                         frenzy, while the boat, knocked about- 
                     
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         by wind and tide, rolled and spun, and 
                         crest after crest broke over me. 
                     
                     
                         "Then there was a crash, a dizzy up- - 
                         heaval, and I was flung through the air 
                         to the sand, the boat rolling completely 
                         over me, crushing my body under it. 
                     
                     
                         "How long I lay there, I do not 
                         know; but it must have been hours, for 
                         when at last I staggered dizzily to my 
                         feet, it was growing dark. Casting my 
                         eyes about for some possible refuge, I 
                         for the first time noticed Hetzel's house 
                         a great, white pile, without a light show 
                         ing, set back among dwarf pine and 
                         scrub oak. Stumbling up the beach to- 
                         ward the house, I became aware that 
                         my wavering course was crossing and 
                         recrossing footsteps in the sand that 
                         led in the same direction. 
                     
                     
                         "I stopped to examine them, then 
                         dropped to my hands and knees to get 
                         a better look; for the sand, left firm and 
                         hard by the late rain, held a good im 
                         pression, and showed the maker of the 
                         footsteps to have been a boy or woman 
                         wearing canvas bathing shoes, such as 
                         I knew Vivian to have worn. Rising 
                         again to my feet, I began following the 
                         tracks back in the direction from which 
                         they had come. They led down to the 
                         beach, turned up it for a hundred yards, 
                         then, abruptly turning again, they led 
                         straight down into the water, as if the 
                         one walking there had come up out of 
                         the sea. 
                     
                     
                         "For a while, I stood looking out 
                         over the dark water, trying to grasp the 
                         full significance of what I had discov- 
                         ered, for, if Vivian had swum ashore 
                         she would have waded out of the shal-

                         of the only shelter that presented itself 
                         Hetzel's house.

                         discovered the footprints, I began to 
                         follow them, only soon to lose them 
                         among the grass and shrubbery. But so 
                         obviously were they leading to the 
                         house, that I did not pause, and, as I

                         "With no surrounding grounds, the 
                         house was built on the sands of this 
                         bleak little island, and was occupied 
                         only by Hetzel and the old man who 
                         attended his wants. Giving no thought 
                         to the mystery with which superstition 
                         enshrouded the place, I raced up the 
                         steps and rapped loudly on the front 
                         door. But my knock was answered 
                         only by hollow echoes within, and I re- 
                         peated it several times, each time harder 
                         and more insistent. Baffled, I caught 
                         the knob and gave the door a vigorous 
                         shake. It was securely locked. 
                     
                     
                         "Going to one of the old-fashioned 
                         blinds in front of a window reaching 
                         to the floor, I tried to insert my hand 
                         between the slats and unfasten the 
                         latch. Not being able to do this, I de- 
                         liberately kicked loose two of the little 
                         pieces; for I was obsessed with the 
                         idea that Vivian was in the house, and 
                         to find it closed against me only made 
                         me the more determined to enter.

                         raised the window and passed into the 
                         room. Here, all was in darkness, and, 
                         as the matches in my pocket wrere 
                         soaked and useless, I began groping 
                         about for the mantelshelf with the hope 
                         of finding some there. At last, tread- 
                         ing on the hearth beneath, I found the 
                         shelf, and my searching fingers soon 
                         encountered a candlestick about which 
                         lay several matches.

                         blaze flickering above my head, I in-

                         the library, as row upon row of sci- 
                         entific works lined the walls. Going to 
                         a door that stood open at one end, and 
                         peering out into what seemed to be the 
                         hall, I looked intently to the right, then 
                         to the left. Unable to fathom the 
                         heavy darkness beyond the feeble rays 
                         of my candle, I stepped gingerly forth. 
                     
                     
                         "To the left, toward the front of the 
                         house, something sprawled on the floor, 
                     
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         and, in dread, I shrank back until I 
                         could no longer see its outline, and 
                         stood panting with nervousness. Then, 
                         calming myself, and deciding that the 
                         object could be nothing more than a 
                         rug, I resolutely advanced to inspect it 
                         at closer range. 
                     
                     
                         "It was a man--stiff, cold, dead. He 
                         lay on his back, and seemed to have 
                         died in the grip of some anguishing 
                         physical struggle; for his eyes pro- 
                         truded, and his tongue stuck out be- 
                         tween the bluish lips. His shirt had 
                         been torn open at the collar, and, stoop- 
                         ing lower, I could see that his stringy 
                         throat had been pierced by what I at 
                         first took to be some sharp instrument. 
                         There were two small holes on each 
                         side, from which a little blood had 
                         oozed and dried on the chalky skin. 
                         Then it dawned on me that the wounds 
                         must have been inflicted by some ani- 
                         mal. The man's throat had evidently 
                         been gripped in powerful jaws that had 
                         strangled him to death. 
                     
                     
                         "With an apprehensive glance about 
                         me, I turned from that thing on the 
                         floor and went back into the library, 
                         where I remembered to have seen, on a 
                         flat desk, a daggerlike paper knife of 
                         brass, which might prove handy as a 
                         weapon. For, horror-struck though I 
                         was, though I longed to flee from the 
                         accursed place, I still felt that Vivian 
                         had come here, and knew, now, that I 
                         must find her. That thing in the hall 
                         was all that remained of the old butler. 
                         Where was his master? Where was 
                         Vivian? 
                     
                     
                         "Taking in my left hand the candle, 
                         and a box of matches I had found on 
                         the desk, firmly grasping the weapon in 
                         my right, I again entered the hall, this 
                         time turning toward the rear of the 
                         house. The darkness was filled with 
                         terrors. Each instant it seemed that 
                         some weird monster of the gloomy 
                         house would spring upon me from the 
                         obscurity ahead. Once, a chair, di- 
                         rectly in my path, took a sinister shape

                         and appeared to be rearing at me. I 
                         turned and fled, stopping only when 
                         the light went out, and I could no longer 
                         see to run. But I relit the candle, and 
                         again turned to my search; for I had 
                         now reached that desperate stage where 
                         an animal, even a cowardly animal, 
                         when absolutely cornered, will fight till 
                         the last breath leaves its body. 
                     
                     
                         "Following the hall to its lower end, 
                         I found another running to the right. 
                         As I turned down this, I suddenly 
                         stopped, my blood freezing in my veins. 
                         In the darkness ahead, glowing in the 
                         candlelight, shone a pair of eyes; then, 
                         with a rumbling snarl, a great object 
                         came hurtling toward me. 
                     
                     
                         "Calling on Heaven to help me, I 
                         waited, the knife raised above my head. 
                     
                     
                         "The creature struck me heavily in 
                         the chest, hurling me backward to the 
                         floor, and the candle flew wildly, leav- 
                         ing me in utter darkness. But, even as 
                         I fell, with all my might I struck, landed 
                         solidly, and the knife was wrenched 
                         downward and out of my hand. 
                     
                     
                         "For a while I lay where I had fallen, 
                         half stunned, instinctively covering my 
                         throat with my hands, expecting each 
                         moment to feel the hot breath on my 
                         face, the horrible fangs biting into my 
                         flesh. Then, I became aware of a scuf- 
                         fling sound, a few heavy, deep-drawn 
                         breaths, a gurgling, rattling cough, and 
                         all was still. 
                     
                     
                         "At last, on hands and knees, I be- 
                         gan groping for the matches, which had 
                         been flung out of my hand with the 
                         candle. Once, I touched something 
                         hairy and warm, and shrank back, my 
                         hands held before me to ward off an 
                         attack. When my search was re- 
                         warded, I struck a light, dreading what 
                         it might show me. 
                     
                     
                         "On the floor, weltering in its blood, 
                         the knife still sticking in its throat, lay 
                         an enormous dog, a powerful, savage, 
                         murderous brute. Drawing out the 
                         bloody knife, I proceeded down the hall 
                         to the other end, where I found a heavy 
                     
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         door standing ajar. My light fell 
                         through the opening on a small land- 
                         ing, with a flight of steps to the left 
                         descending into the darkness. 
                     
                     
                         "As I shoved the door farther open 
                         to pass through, it resisted; an unseen 
                         hand seemed to be there, pushing 
                         against me. Determined to fight my 
                         way if necessary, I threw forward my 
                         weight, shoving the door wide, and, as I 
                         did so, kicked a soft object from un- 
                         der my feet, down the steps. I found 
                         that a strong spring was what had been 
                         shoving against me, and, as I released 
                         it, the door slammed to with the click of 
                         a latch, evidently having been kept 
                         from shutting by the thing over which 
                         I had stumbled. 
                     
                     
                         "Trying the door to make sure that I 
                         could open it again when necessary, I 
                         descended the steps, which led down 
                         about ten feet, and stooped to examine 
                         whatever it was over which I had stum- 
                         bled. It was an old, oilskin hat--Vivi- 
                         an's! This was the first positive evi- 
                         dence I had found that she had been 
                         here, and I do not know whether my 
                         feeling was one of relief or of horror. 
                     
                     
                         "I now found myself in an under- 
                         ground passage, paved with cement, 
                         and my footsteps echoed noisily as I 
                         pushed on into the blackness of the 
                         gloomy way. 
                     
                     
                         "Then, right at me, before I noticed 
                         it, I saw something that made me start 
                         back with such violence that my candle 
                         flickered ominously. A bare, human 
                         foot, sole turned toward me, toes widely 
                         spread, was what my bulging eyes saw; 
                         and the leg to this foot--that was all.

                         ever, I turned and bent above it. Could 
                         it be-- Was it-- But I drove 
                         the horrible thought from my mind, and 
                         hurried on down the passage.

                         seemed to be its end. This was un-

                         the shelves and stood on tables; many 
                         curious-looking machines for making 
                         tests sat about; a brilliant flood of arti- 
                         ficial light made the room as bright as 
                         day. For a moment I paused, amazed 
                         at the strange scene in such an out-of- 
                         the-way place. Then, cautiously, si- 
                         lently, I began to cross the room. 
                     
                     
                         "Although this was very large, on

                         only a few feet in any direction. It 
                         looked like the accumulation of ages. 
                         Then I came on a cleared space, and 
                         what seemed to be a workbench, or

                         shock, I tried to calm myself, tried to 
                         reason that it was some wonderful work 
                         of art on which I looked. Some master, 
                         I argued, had wrought this marvel-

                         wonderful beauty and symmetry, which 
                         rose from a base of ivory, was a head. 
                         The face, delicately tinted, was perfect 
                         in contour; slightly oval, but with a pro- 
                         portionate distance between chin and 
                         brow. The lips were a scarlet bow, 
                         full, sensuous, appealing; the nose was 
                         perfect; long lashes, resting on the 
                         cheeks of delicate pink, hid eyes whose 
                         slumbrous depths could only be imag-

                         abundant, arranged at the back of the 
                         head, with little tendrils falling over 
                         the ears, formed a fit setting for the 
                         radiant beauty of the face. It was the 
                         head of Vivian White!

                         looked out, speaking to me in accents of 
                         comfort and peace as I groveled there 
                         on the floor. A smile, sweet, tender, 
                         solicitous, appealing, passed over the 
                         face and was gone; the eyes slowly 
                         closed, as if unable to resist the desire 
                         to sleep.

                         sage from those beautiful eyes, calmed 
                         me. Kneeling there, speechless, numb,

                         comprehend what I saw, I yet began 
                         to realize, in a way, what had happened

                         me, I recognized him for what he was, 
                         and into my half-crazed brain came the 
                         impulsive desire to kill. I know that I 
                         snarled like an angry dog, and, as I had 
                         dropped my knife, for lack of a better 
                         weapon, I caught up a heavy stone 
                         crock, which was on a table beside me, 
                         and, in another moment, would have 
                         knocked out his brains where he stood.

                         tended to add me to his list of subjects. 
                     
                     
                         "The spell was broken. With a 
                         spring, I caught the old viper by the 
                         throat, intending to throttle the life out 
                         of him; but, with the agility of a cat, 
                         he twisted out of my grasp. 
                     
                     
                         "Not to be checked in my intent to 
                         kill him, in mad fury I caught up from 
                         a table a heavy piece of copper pipe 
                         and swung it aloft to crush his skull, 
                         intending, then, to take my poor little 
                         captive soul and escape from that place 
                         of living death. But, with that same 
                         gesture--the power of which I cannot 
                         explain--that had arrested my hand 
                         before, the old man stopped me. 
                     
                     
                         " 'Kill me,' he said, 'and Vivian 
                         White will also perish. The last in- 
                         gredient is to be added to her food on 
                         the third day. Should this be left out, 
                         within a week's time the flesh would be- 
                         gin to shrivel and dry, until nothing 
                         would be left but a grinning skull; and 
                         she would remain conscious, as her 
                         brain would be the last to go. Before 
                         I perfected this last element of food, I 
                         lost just seventeen subjects.' 
                     
                     
                         "He laughed satanically as he said 
                         this, and the weird light of fanaticism 
                         shone in his eyes. As my hands fell 
                         nerveless to my sides, he continued:

                         who were but washed ashore and 
                         sought refuge in my house--and found 
                         it. Ha! Ha! Ha!' 
                     
                     
                         "With the diabolical laughter of that 
                         fiend ringing in my ears, the pipe 
                         slipped from my limp fingers, and, help- 
                         less, I turned once more to that beau-

                         ing, and, for an instant, the soft eyes 
                         rested tenderly, wistfully on me. When 
                         they were again closed, as though in 
                         sleep, I was seized with a feeling of 
                         utter despair. Then, something seemed 
                         to snap in my brain. A great fear over- 
                         came me. With horror that was a 
                         frenzy of terror gripping my heart, I 
                         turned and fled--fled shrieking from 
                         the place." 
                     
                     
                         It had now grown quite dark in the 
                         room, so that objects were discernible 
                         only in outline by the reflection from 
                         the windows. After a pause, my vis- 
                         itor suddenly leaned forward, his face 
                         thrust close to mine. 
                     
                     
                         "The soul of her whom I love is there

                         should have done. Advise me what to 
                         do! 
                     
                     
                         "Ah," he said, as I remained silent, 
                         "you have no answer for me! I should 
                         have not expected it. The uncertainty

                         madman, a madman, a madman!" His 
                         voice died out in a shrill wail. 
                     
                     
                         I rose and lit a lamp, the light reveal-

                         haggard face more drawn than ever, 
                         his eyes staring vacantly in front of 
                         him. 
                     
                     
                         "How did you escape from the 
                         island?" I asked at last. 
                     
                     
                         "I do not remember anything more. 
                         A searching party found me the next 
                         day down on the beach beside the boat.

                         I was unconscious at the time, and knew 
                         nothing for a week. I was severely 
                         bruised about the head and body where 
                         the boat had crushed me, injuries un- 
                         heeded in my excitement." 
                     
                     
                         Suddenly, as abruptly as he had 
                         come, he rose from his chair, crossed 
                         the room, and disappeared through the 
                         door into the dripping night. 
                     
                     
                         By two o'clock, the gale had risen to 
                         a hurricane, and, stout as was my cabin, 
                         it trembled in the grip of the wind. 
                         Now and then, above the roar of the 
                         tempest, I could hear the crash of some 
                         great pine in the flat woods to the north 
                         of me. That September storm along 
                         the Gulf coast was the event from 
                         which people in that region reckon 
                         time. 
                     
                     
                         It was noon the next day before I 
                         ventured out on the flooded bayou in 
                         a canoe that I had fortunately carried 
                         indoors. Making my way over to 
                         Cody, I was astonished at the havoc 
                         that had been done by wind and water. 
                     
                     
                         The story I had heard the night be- 
                         fore had gripped me with a strong 
                     
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         fascination, that I could not shake off. 
                         I tried to put my strange visitor down 
                         as unbalanced, as some poor unfor- 
                         tunate under a delusion. But, some- 
                         how, there was such a ring of the gen- 
                         uine in what he had told me, something 
                         in his description of the scientist so like 
                         what I imagined Hetzel to be, that I 
                         felt, in spite of my desire to discredit 
                         the whole thing, the man's statement 
                         warranted an investigation. 
                     
                     
                         I tried to find some one in Cody from 
                         whom I could make inquiries. But all 
                         were in dire distress and confusion, 
                         with scant heed for anything but their 
                         own troubles. Many houses had been 
                         wrecked, several lives had been lost, 
                         and everybody was more or less un- 
                         comfortable and miserable. 
                     
                     
                         At last I came on a little group at the 
                         water's edge, gazing off across the 
                         sound, and taking turns at peering 
                         through a pair of glasses. 
                     
                     
                         "What is it?" I asked. 
                     
                     
                         "Hetzel's place is gone," replied one 
                         of them. "That whole end of the island 
                         is washed away. Here, take a look."

                         TWO brothers, twins, as alike in appearance as two peas in a pod, have been 
                         discovered in the rogues' gallery records to be serving separate sentences of 
                         five years for burglaries committed in Los Angeles.  
                     
                     
                         When the pictures of the brothers reached Adolph Juhl, head of the police 
                         identification bureau, in San Francisco, California, it was thought at first that the 
                         prison records were in error, that through some slip two records had been sent 
                         out for the same man. 
                     
                     
                         Juhl immediately wired to the officials at San Quentin and Folsom, asking 
                         for the finger prints of Mesak Kartangen, which is the name claimed by both 
                         men, and it was only when the prints were examined under the glass that it was 
                         found that there were two separate and distinct Mesak Kartangens. 
                     
                     
                         The men have prison records in various parts of the country, and both are 
                         graduates of reformatories. One was convicted March 20, 1915, and the other 
                         March 18th, of this year. They are twenty-two years old.

                         IN a moment Doctor Lord and the 
                         nurse were back at the patient's 
                         side. 
                     
                     
                         "I must ask you gentlemen to 
                         go," the physician said crisply. "This 
                         has been too much for him, as it is, and 
                         any further excitement might cause 
                         serious complications, if nothing 
                         worse." 
                     
                     
                         There was nothing for it but to with- 
                         draw, and to hope that the effect of 
                         the interview would not be as serious 
                         as the doctor suggested. 
                     
                     
                         Fortunately, the detective instinct 
                         had been strong in Cray, notwithstand- 
                         ing his condition, and he had covered 
                         the ground pretty thoroughly--surpris- 
                         ingly so, in view of the few words he 
                         had spoken. His statement about the 
                         suit case, and his description of the car 
                         might prove particularly valuable. 
                     
                     
                         Flint took pains to interview Simp- 
                         son, his wife, and the servant before 
                         leaving the house, and then paid a visit 
                         to the garage. 
                     
                     
                         He smiled as he noted the subterfuge 
                         of the underground gasoline tank. 
                     
                     
                         "Quite clever, on the surface," he re- 
                         marked, "but Simpson seems to be a 
                         queer mixture. He impresses you at 
                         one time with his cleverness, at another 
                         with stupidity." 
                     
                     
                         "I don't see anything stupid about 
                         this," Griswold objected. "It strikes 
                         me as very ingenious. It permitted him 
                         to dig up the ground to his heart's con- 
                         tent without arousing suspicion." 
                     
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         "True," conceded the detective. "The 
                         ordinary person would have seen noth- 
                         ing strange about it; but doesn't the 
                         presence of a gasoline tank under- 
                         ground, or any other kind, strike you 
                         as a little peculiar when a man owns an 
                         electric?" 
                     
                     
                         The millionaire looked very sheepish. 
                     
                     
                         "I'm afraid I must plead guilty to 
                         stupidity as well," he confessed. "That 
                         didn't occur to me, and I doubt if it ever 
                         would." 
                     
                     
                         The two detectives made a thorough 
                         examination of the little garage, the 
                         ground about it, and the pile of lumber, 
                         as well as the road at the rear. 
                     
                     
                         They found some finger prints, and 
                         photographed them carefully, after 
                         bringing out other details by artificial 
                         means. They were inclined to believe 
                         that some of them belonged to Gordon, 
                         and if so, their discovery would prove 
                         valuable. Beyond that, however, they 
                         learned little. 
                     
                     
                         "Well, we had better part company 
                         here, Judson," Flint told his assistant. 
                         "I'm going to let you pick up the trail 
                         of the electric car and follow it, if you 
                         can. See if you can locate the machine. 
                         Probably it has been abandoned long 
                         before this, for it would have to be re- 
                         charged before it could go very far. 
                         Doubtless, Green Eye remembered that, 
                         and deserted it before such attention 
                         was necessary. Still, if you can find 
                         where he dispensed with it, you can get 
                         a clew to his subsequent movements, 
                         especially as he was burdened with a 
                         couple of very heavy suit cases." 
                     
                     
                         "Consider me on the job," was Jud-

                         son's ready reply. "I'll start work right 
                         away, and keep going as long as the 
                         going is good. How about you, though? 
                         What are you going to tackle?" 
                     
                     
                         "I shall return home at once," Flint 
                         replied, "and go through the safe. I 
                         must find out which records are miss- 
                         ing, and when I have learned that, I 
                         ought to be able to catch the rascal 
                         sooner or later." 
                     
                     
                         "You mean that he'll be sure to visit 
                         some of the people interested, or write 
                         to them, and that you can nab him in 
                         that way?" his assistant asked. 
                     
                     
                         "That's the idea. If Green Eye 
                         hasn't learned of our return--and I sin- 
                         cerely hope he hasn't--he won't lose 
                         much time in getting to work at the 
                         blackmailing business, and you may be 
                         sure he'll choose some of the most 
                         tempting of the local people for his first 
                         victims." 
                     
                     
                         Judson held up his hand. 
                     
                     
                         "I get you," he said. "That's just 
                         what will happen, unless he's scared off, 
                         and he'll work quickly, for fear you 
                         may return earlier than you had ex- 
                         pected, and get wind of the whole thing. 
                         Alongside of that, my job seems pretty 
                         punk, but you are the general." 
                     
                     
                         "Your job is a necessary one, and we 
                         may need all the dope on Green Eye's 
                         movements that we can get," Flint told 
                         him. 
                     
                     
                         Very shortly afterward they sep- 
                         arated, Judson remaining behind, while 
                         Flint and the millionaire reentered the 
                         car and started back to the city. 
                     
                     
                         Very little was said on the latter's 
                         journey. To be sure, Griswold seemed 
                         willing enough to keep the conversa- 
                         tional ball rolling, but he soon found 
                         that Flint was of a different mind. He 
                         was glad, therefore, when the detec- 
                         tive's house was reached, and Flint 
                         stepped out of the machine, after in- 
                         structing the chauffeur to take Griswold 
                         wherever he wished to go. 
                     
                     
                         "You think you can catch him, then?" 
                         the millionaire asked in parting. 
                     
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         Flint gave him a strange look. 
                     
                     
                         "If I fail in this, I'll shut up shop," 
                         the detective replied. 
                     
                     
                         It was said rather lightly, but Gris- 
                         wold was a shrewd student of charac- 
                         ter, and knew that the famous Nemesis 
                         of criminals was in deadly earnest.

                         WAITING FOR A NIBBLE. 
                     
                     
                         THORNDYKE FLINT hardly knew 
                         what to do about the members of 
                         his household. They had not yet been 
                         informed of the way in which they had 
                         been taken in, and it was difficult to de- 
                         cide whether they should be or not. 
                         After some reflection, however, the de- 
                         tective decided to say nothing about it, 
                         for the present. 
                     
                     
                         They accepted his presence as a mat- 
                         ter of course, just as they had done in 
                         the case of the impostor, and if he told 
                         them the truth, they would be plunged 
                         into a state bordering on panic. 
                     
                     
                         Moreover, if Gordon should take a 
                         notion to return to the house, after 
                         such a revelation, it would be almost 
                         impossible for the butler, housekeeper, 
                         and the rest to be their natural selves in 
                         his presence. If they betrayed their 
                         knowledge, they might scare him off 
                         just when Flint wished him to be most 
                         at his ease. 
                     
                     
                         Flint entered his study, and, after 
                         walking up and down for a few min- 
                         utes, seated himself in his desk chair. 
                     
                     
                         There was a tenseness about his look 
                         and every movement he made. He was 
                         like a perfectly trained athlete, crouched 
                         for a start of some record-breaking 
                         dash. 
                     
                     
                         The famous detective was well ac- 
                         quainted with danger, and to risk his 
                         life was an easy matter of everyday 
                         occurrence. He took up the most seri- 
                         ous and dangerous cases without a 
                         thought of the possible consequences to 
                         himself. Here, however, was some- 
                         thing different.

                         This came nearer home, perhaps, than 
                         anything else had ever done, for, 
                         through him the honor and peace of 
                         mind of numbers of persons--conspic- 
                         uous targets, all of them--were threat- 
                         ened. 
                     
                     
                         Too late the detective recognized that 
                         his reputation was not enough to pro- 
                         tect his house and his private safe from 
                         violence, and that he had no right to 
                         keep such records there. They should 
                         all be in a safe-deposit vault.

                         tected in future. 
                     
                     
                         That, however, would not help the 
                         present situation which Flint was now 
                         forced to face. 
                     
                     
                         He actually shrank from going over 
                         the disarranged papers which Green 
                         Eye had left behind, but after a little 
                         delay he forced himself to open the 
                         safe, empty the remaining pigeonholes, 
                         et cetera, and dump their contents on 
                         the desk. That done, he sat himself 
                         down and went to work. 
                     
                     
                         Fortunately, there was a compara- 
                         tively small number of papers of that 
                         description in the safe, therefore, it did 
                         not take very long to go through them 
                         and check off those which remained-- 
                         for the methodical detective had a list 
                         of all of them. 
                     
                     
                         In this way, by a process of elimina- 
                         tion, Flint quickly learned the ones 
                         which had been stolen, and his ex- 
                         pression grew grimmer than ever as he 
                         realized the shrewdness of Gordon's 
                         choice. 
                     
                     
                         Most of the missing papers concerned 
                         idividuals or families in and around 
                         Newv York, which seemed to imply that 
                         a quick, clean-up was contemplated. 
                     
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         Some few, though, involved persons 
                         farther away, and these appeared to 
                         have been selected because they had of- 
                         fered particularly tempting bait to the 
                         blackmailer. 
                     
                     
                         It needed only the brief entries in the 
                         index to bring back to Flint's mind all 
                         of the important details of each case, 
                         and he ground his teeth as he pictured 
                         the scoundrel gloating over those same 
                         details, and cleverly scheming to de- 
                         mand the top price for their sup- 
                         pression. 
                     
                     
                         "What a haul!" he murmured aloud. 
                         "All those papers, and seventy-five or 
                         eighty thousand in gold, to boot! If 
                         it's really Ernest Gordon with whom 
                         we have to deal--and I'm morally cer- 
                         tain it is--he must be drunk with joy, 
                         for he has made blackmailing an art, 
                         and he could not ask anything bigger or 
                         more promising of that sort. In his 
                         calmer moments, though, he must re- 
                         alize that he won't have the chance to 
                         hold up many of these people. 
                     
                     
                         "Doesn't he know that the first man 
                         he approaches will in all probability 
                         come running to me to demand an ex- 
                         planation, if nothing more? And hasn't 
                         it occurred to him that I would receive 
                         an urgent summons home under such 
                         circumstances? 
                     
                     
                         "Well, if it has, he'll see all the more 
                         reason for striking while the iron is 
                         hot." 
                     
                     
                         He had put the papers away tem- 
                         porarily, intending to find a safer place 
                         for them at the earliest opportunity, 
                         when the butler entered the study with 
                         a telegram. It proved to be from the 
                         warden at Clinton prison, and was a 
                         long one--sent "collect," of course. 
                     
                     
                         It contained certain new and sig- 
                         nificant, though minor, details concern- 
                         ing the supposed death of Green Eye 
                         Gordon, and the escape of the yegg 
                         from Buffalo, which served to confirm 
                         Flint's suspicions, but the most striking 
                         thing about the message was the tone of 
                         it. It appeared from the latter, that

                         95 
                         the warden had been doubtful, or was 
                         doubtful now concerning the identity of 
                         the man who had been burned. He did 
                         not say so, of course, but Flint could 
                         read doubt between the lines. 
                     
                     
                         Obviously, the identification had been 
                         a very careless one, or else the prison 
                         authorities had deliberately winked at 
                         the misleading statements which had 
                         found their way into the newspapers. 
                         Very likely, they took it for granted at 
                         first that the partially burned body was 
                         that of Gordon, and afterward pre- 
                         ferred to hush the thing up rather than 
                         let it be known that there was any rea- 
                         son to believe that the redoubtable 
                         Green Eye had escaped. 
                     
                     
                         "Well, that settles it, I think, for all 
                         practical purposes," the detective told 
                         himself. ''Cray's identification was a 
                         very hasty one, made under very unfa- 
                         vorable circumstances, but when it's 
                         taken in connection with this trans- 
                         parent telegram, and especially in con- 
                         nection with the nature, daring, and 
                         adroitness of the crime itself, it seems 
                         safe enough to conclude that Ernest 
                         Gordon is the man I must look for-- 
                         and find." 
                     
                     
                         Which would be the best course, 
                         though? To warn those who might be 
                         expected to be approached by the crim- 
                         inal, or to wait until they came to the 
                         detective? 
                     
                     
                         After some thought, Flint decided on 
                         the latter course. Naturally, he did not 
                         wish that every one concerned should 
                         know what had happened, for that 
                         seemed unnecessary. He believed that 
                         Gordon would concentrate on a few in- 
                         tended victims at first, and if the de- 
                         tective could discover who those per- 
                         sons were, he ought to be able to trap 
                         the rascal without allowing the others 
                         to know what had threatened them. 
                     
                     
                         It was his confident belief that prac- 
                         tically every one who might be visited 
                         or written to by the blackmailer would 
                         try to get in touch with him--Flint-- 
                     
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         at once. That made him willing to play 
                         this waiting game--at least, for a time. 
                     
                     
                         "The first one who communicates 
                         with me," he thought, "should give me 
                         a line on the fellow's methods and 
                         plans. No one is likely to yield to his 
                         demands on the spot, and if I can learn 
                         of a proposed rendezvous or two, the 
                         rest should be fairly plain sailing--un- 
                         less the scoundrel learns of my return 
                         and plays dead for a while." 
                     
                     
                         He had reached this point in his mus- 
                         ings when he heard a furious ring at 
                         the doorbell. 
                     
                     
                         "Possibly that's the first of the vic- 
                         tims now," he thought. "If it is, I must 
                         prepare myself for some more or less 
                         well-grounded reproaches. I can stand 
                         them, though, if in addition, I'm put 
                         on the track of the man I want to lay 
                         my hands on more than I ever wanted 
                         to lay them on any one else." 
                     
                     
                         CHAPTER XLII. 
                     
                     
                         THE FIRST VICTIM. 
                     
                     
                         SHORTLY afterward, the butler 
                         knocked at the study door and 
                         opened it. 
                     
                     
                         "Mr. Chester J. Gillespie to see you, 
                         sir," he announced. 
                     
                     
                         Before Flint could reply, or the but- 
                         ler could get out of the way, for that 
                         matter, the young man named pushed 
                         into the room, his face pale with agita- 
                         tion. 
                     
                     
                         "You must help me, Mr. Flint!" he 
                         cried excitedly. "I--" 
                     
                     
                         He paused as Flint motioned the but- 
                         ler to withdraw and close the door. 
                         When the servant had complied, Flint 
                         said quietly: 
                     
                     
                         "Sit down, Mr. Gillespie. I'm very 
                         sorry to learn that some one has at- 
                         tempted to blackmail you, but there's 
                         no necessity for such great haste." 
                     
                     
                         His caller had started to take a chair, 
                         but paused with his hand on the back of 
                         it, and stared at Flint in the greatest 
                         amazement. Presently, a spot of angry

                         red appeared in each pale cheek, and his 
                         rather weak jaw was thrust out. ag- 
                         gressively. 
                     
                     
                         ''By Heaven!" he breathed. "I be- 
                         lieve you are in league with the fellow. 
                         I'll swear I do! How otherwise could 
                         you know that--" 
                     
                     
                         "That will be about enough of that, 
                         Gillespie!" the detective said sternly. 
                         He had heard too many such accusa- 
                         tions in the last few hours. "If you 
                         have come to me for help, as your 
                         rather abrupt opening words would 
                         seem to indicate, let me warn you that 
                         you are not furthering your cause by 
                         insulting me." 
                     
                     
                         "I--I beg your pardon, Mr. Flint," 
                         the bewildered young man stammered. 
                         "I didn't mean it, of course, but you are 
                         positively uncanny, and I could not un- 
                         derstand how--" 
                     
                     
                         "It's very simple, though," Flint told 
                         him. "I've been robbed of some papers, 
                         unfortunately, and those dealing with 
                         your case are among them. Naturally, 
                         therefore, when you rushed in in that 
                         fashion, I concluded that the thief had 
                         tried to bleed you." 
                     
                     
                         "Oh! So that was it?" Gillespie 
                         murmured somewhat sheepishly. 
                         Again, however, his anger and sense of 
                         injury got the upper hand. "Then it's 
                         you I have to thank for this, after all!" 
                         he cried. "I supposed my secret safe 
                         with you, as safe as if it were buried 
                         with me. Now, you calmly announce 
                         that it has been stolen from you. This 
                         is too much, Flint! Can't you keep 
                         your papers where they will be safe? 
                         What right have you got to preserve 
                         such records, anyway? Why don't you 
                         destroy them for the sake of your cli- 
                         ents? It's unbearable! This will be 
                         the ruin of me! If Florence finds out 
                         about it, she will refuse to marry me, 
                         and--" 
                     
                     
                         The detective held up his hand com- 
                         mandingly, and the young man--he did 
                         not appear to be over twenty-five-- 
                         lapsed into silence. 
                     
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         "I have already told you, Gillespie, 
                         that I profoundly regret what has hap- 
                         pened. You are forgetting yourself, 
                         though, and wasting time. I already 
                         know who made away with those pa- 
                         pers, and, with your assistance, I hope 
                         to lay a trap for him that will bring his 
                         schemes to an end very quickly. I think 
                         I can promise you that there will be no 
                         publicity, and that nothing need inter- 
                         fere with your approaching marriage. 
                         Now, tell me precisely what has hap- 
                         pened." 
                     
                     
                         Young Gillespie was several times a 
                         millionaire, having inherited a large for- 
                         tune from his father a year or two be- 
                         fore. The responsibility thus involved 
                         upon him had sobered him down in a 
                         remarkable manner, and he was looked 
                         upon in certain quarters as one of the 
                         coming leaders in the financial world. 
                         Before his father's death, however, he 
                         had sown a lot of wild oats of one sort 
                         or another, and it was in connection 
                         with one of these youthful escapades 
                         that Flint had been called in about four 
                         years previously. 
                     
                     
                         The affair threatened to be very seri- 
                         ous, for the time, but the detective's 
                         skill had been brought to bear in a sur- 
                         prising manner, with the result that 
                         everything had been smoothed out as 
                         well as possible without the vaguest 
                         rumor having got abroad. 
                     
                     
                         The young man fumbled in his pocket 
                         with a gloved hand, and produced a 
                         sheet of notepaper, the top of which 
                         had obviously been cut away. 
                     
                     
                         "That was found under the door 
                         when the house was opened up this 
                         morning," he said. "Here's the en- 
                         velope. It was not stamped, of 
                         course." 
                     
                     
                         Flint smoothed out the sheet of pa- 
                         per and looked at the sprawling, uncer- 
                         tain writing that covered it. He read: 
                     
                     
                         I know all about the affair of four years 
                         ago. My price for silcnce is one hundred 
                         thousand dollars. Have it ready when I call, 
                         or pay it to any one who may present an 
                     
                 
             
             
                 
                 Snarled Identities 97 
                 
                     
                     
                         order from me. Don't think you can stop 
                         this by trying to have me arrested. You 
                         will fail, and the whole story will come out. 
                         I have fully arranged for its publication, no 
                         matter what happens to me. The money is 
                         the only thing that will buy my silence. 
                         Pay it, and your secret is safe. What is 
                         more, you will never hear from me again. 
                         Refuse to pay it. and--ruin! 
                     
                     
                         It was a bold letter, but Flint saw 
                         that it was nothing but a bluff. He 
                         said as much. 
                     
                     
                         "I hope you haven't been deceived by 
                         this," he remarked, tapping the sheet. 
                         "This fellow is working alone, you may 
                         be sure, and, therefore, it isn't at all 
                         likely that he has 'arranged' anything 
                         of the sort in case he should be ar- 
                         rested. By this, as you ought to know, 
                         the newspapers would not publish a 
                         story about you without warning. You 
                         have too much money and too many 
                         friends. You would have an oppor- 
                         tunity to bring your influence to bear, 
                         and the story would be killed." 
                     
                     
                         "That sounds plausible enough," Gil- 
                         lespie admitted. "That's what I would 
                         tell any one else in my position, if he 
                         were similarly threatened. When this 
                         sort of thing comes home to a fellow, 
                         though, it makes a lot of difference." 
                     
                     
                         "I know," the detective replied, with 
                         a nod. "That's the sort of mood such 
                         a scoundrel counts on." 
                     
                     
                         He paused and thoughtfully fingered 
                         the letter. 
                     
                     
                         "I must confess that this is a disap- 
                         pointment," he resumed slowly. "I had 
                         hoped that the blackmailer would set a 
                         definite time for his call, or ask you to 
                         take the money to some specified place. 
                         This, however, avoids anything of that 
                         sort, and leaves me nothing definite to 
                         go on. All it tells us is that he expects 
                         to call at some unnamed hour--perhaps 
                         to-day, perhaps to-morrow, perhaps not 
                         for several days. I think we need not 
                         bother about the hint that he may send 
                         some one with a written order, for if 
                         such a person presented himself, I feel 
                         sure it would be the blackmailer, and 
                     
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         no other. This absence of details, how- 
                         ever, makes it rather difficult to know 
                         just what to do." 
                     
                     
                         "How would this do?" Gillespie said 
                         hesitatingly. "You are a genius at 
                         make-up. Why don't you pass your- 
                         self off for me? Go to my place on 
                         Fifth Avenue and wait for this fellow, 
                         wherever he is, to call? The chances 
                         are that he won't put it off very long, 
                         and even if you had to remain there a 
                         couple of days, you would not mind, 
                         would you, if you could nab your man 
                         at the end of your wait?"

                         AN ASTOUNDING RUSE. 
                     
                     
                         GIILLESPIE went on more confi- 
                         dently: 
                     
                     
                         "It ought to give him the shock of 
                         his life to think he's dealing merely 
                         with me, and then to have you reveal 
                         yourself to him. Of course, we could 
                         both stay there, and you could walk in 
                         and collar him while he was holding me 
                         up, but I'm afraid he may be watching 
                         the house. In that case, he would be 
                         suspicious if he saw any one else going 
                         in and not coming out again, no matter 
                         whether he recognized you or not." 
                     
                     
                         Flint smiled slightly. 
                     
                     
                         "You must have been reading detec- 
                         tive stories lately, Gillespie," he com- 
                         mented. "However, it isn't a bad idea, 
                         and I'm inclined to try it. There are 
                         certain other advantages about it which 
                         make it appeal to me. How about you, 
                         though? You would have to remain 
                         here as long as I found it necessary to 
                         stay at your place." 
                     
                     
                         "Oh, that's all right. I don't mind. 
                         I'll promise to keep out of sight, and if 
                         I have to stay overnight, I suppose I 
                         can find a bunk somewhere, if you'll 
                         explain my presence to your servants." 
                     
                     
                         "You certainly can," Flint assured 
                         him; "and let's hope that you won't 
                         have to kick your heels here very long." 
                     
                     
                         The detective conducted him into an-

                         other room, and, seating him in the 
                         light, proceeded to busy himself with 
                         his make-up materials and appliances. 
                         At the end of half an hour, the trans- 
                         formation was complete. 
                     
                     
                         "Will this do?" asked Flint, turning 
                         from the glass and facing his visitor. 
                     
                     
                         "By Jove, marvelous!" Gillespie 
                         cried enthusiastically. "By the time 
                         you've got into my clothes, you'll be 
                         able to pass for me anywhere. Luckily, 
                         there's only my old butler, Simms, and 
                         his wife, at the house, as I've been 
                         abroad, and was not expected home as 
                         yet. The chauffeur outside is a new 
                         man, and has never seen me before." 
                     
                     
                         "Good!" Flint answered. "Now for 
                         the clothes.'' 
                     
                     
                         Soon the disguise was complete, and, 
                         after another careful inspection of him- 
                         self, Flint was ready to leave. 
                     
                     
                         "I'll explain matters to my people 
                         here as I go out," he said. "Come this 
                         way and I'll show you the room you 
                         may occupy in my absence. I hope 
                         you'll find it comfortable. Don't hesi- 
                         tate to ask for anything you want, and 
                         I'll let you know as soon as there's any- 
                         thing to report." 
                     
                     
                         After conducting his guest to one of 
                         the spare bedrooms, the detective 
                         parted with Gillespie, and ascended the 
                         stairs. Five minutes later he stepped 
                         into the waiting car as if he owned it. 
                     
                     
                         "Home!" he ordered, and the ma- 
                         chine whirled away in the direction of 
                         upper Fifth Avenue. 
                     
                     
                         Meanwhile, from behind one of the 
                         curtains at the front of the detective's 
                         house, the young man had seen the car 
                         drive off, and, as it passed out of sight, 
                         a remarkable change came over him. 
                         He threw back his head and laughed in 
                         a curiously noiseless way that many an 
                         ex-convict has. 
                     
                     
                         He laughed until the tears rolled 
                         down his cheeks, and at last flung him- 
                         self into a chair and fairly panted for 
                         breath. At length, he recovered him- 
                         self, however, and wiped his eyes. 
                     
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         Simultaneously, his face took on 
                         harsher lines. 
                     
                     
                         The fresh complexion of youth 
                         seemed singularly out of place now, for 
                         age and experience--and evil--peered 
                         through the veneer. 
                     
                     
                         Had there ever been any doubt about 
                         Green Eye Gordon's daring, there could 
                         be none any longer, for this was the 
                         criminal himself. 
                     
                     
                         In some manner best known to him- 
                         self, he had managed to learn of Flint's 
                         return, and had taken this extraor- 
                         dinary means of fooling the detective-- 
                         an example of supreme audacity, in 
                         which he was manifestly taking the 
                         greatest delight. 
                     
                     
                         He expected to kill more than two 
                         birds with the one stone. 
                     
                     
                         "Oh, what a sell!" he thought. "How 
                         are the mighty fallen! You don't hap- 
                         pen to know, my dear Flint, that the 
                         real Chester Gillespie is still abroad, 
                         and that while you are waiting for your 
                         bird in that gloomy old mansion across 
                         from the park, your enterprising little 
                         friend Ernest will be tapping the vari- 
                         ous other sources of income as rapidly 
                         as he can." 
                     
                     
                         Nevertheless, when the first flash of 
                         triumph had passed, there seemed to 
                         be an undercurrent of uneasiness in the 
                         scoundrel's mood and manner. Doubt- 
                         less, he knew that in boldness lay his 
                         only hope, but perhaps he allowed him- 
                         self to fear for the time being, that even 
                         boldness would be insufficient in the 
                         long run against such an antagonist. 
                     
                     
                         Apparently, the great detective had 
                         been completely taken in by this latest 
                         astounding ruse, but very likely Gordon 
                         realized that he was in the lion's mouth, 
                         and that there was no knowing when 
                         the jaws might close with a snap. 
                     
                     
                         Some time after Green Eye returned 
                         to Flint's study, the door opened, and 
                         Judson entered. Flint's assistant did 
                         not look any too well satisfied with his 
                         work thus far. 
                     
                     
                         "I beg your pardon," he said, halting

                         at sight of the supposed Gillespie. "I 
                         didn't know any one was here. Are you 
                         alone?'' 
                     
                     
                         "Yes," Gordon answered coolly. 
                         "Mr. Flint has gone out. I think he 
                         left word for you with the butler, but I 
                         might as well explain that he's absent 
                         on an errand for me, and that I'm to 
                         remain in more or less close confine- 
                         ment here until he returns." 
                     
                     
                         And in response to a look of sur- 
                         prise on Judson's face, he explained a 
                         little further: "If you wish to call 
                         him up-" 
                     
                     
                         "No, not now," Flint's assistant inter- 
                         rupted quietly. "I have nothing to re- 
                         port as yet." 
                     
                     
                         That was good news to Gordon, for 
                         he felt sure that Judson had been try- 
                         ing to pick up some clew to the where- 
                         abouts of the electric car, and if so, it 
                         was plain that he had failed to make 
                         any headway. 
                     
                     
                         "Well, I'll leave you in possession 
                         here and go into the room Mr. Flint 
                         placed at my command." Green Eye re- 
                         marked easily, rising to his feet and 
                         helping himself to another of Flint's 
                         cigars. "If there's no objection, I shall 
                         appropriate some writing materials." 
                     
                     
                         Judson supplied him with paper and 
                         envelopes, et cetera, and assured him 
                         that the study was his to use if he 
                         wished, but the visitor would not con- 
                         sent to "be in the way." Three minutes 
                         later, he was in the bedroom, with the 
                         door closed. 
                     
                     
                         Quickly he removed the tapestry 
                         cover and droplight from the small 
                         table between the windows, and, draw- 
                         ing up a chair, set to work. 
                     
                     
                         It was clear that his desire to write 
                         some letters was genuine enough, and 
                         the fact that he cut the engraved head- 
                         ings from several sheets of paper sug- 
                         gested that the privacy of the room was 
                         welcome. 
                     
                     
                         At the end of an hour he was still 
                         writing, and beside him were several 
                     
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         sealed and stamped envelopes addressed 
                         to a number of well-known names. 
                     
                     
                         The campaign was going forward. 
                     
                     
                         "I shall have to find some means of 
                         getting rid of this man Judson 
                         though," Green Eye told himself, as he 
                         finished one of the letters and leaned 
                         back in a chair. "These fellows I have 
                         written to will come flocking here be- 
                         fore long, and I must be Thorndyke 
                         Flint again, in order to receive them

                         FLINT'S SUSPICIONS CONFIRMED. 
                     
                     
                         IF the criminal could have read 
                         Thorndyke Flint's mind about that 
                         time, he would have been still more un- 
                         easy--and with good reason. 
                     
                     
                         Ernest Gordon had not been the only 
                         one who had played a part during that 
                         interview with Flint, which had ended 
                         in the detective's act of copying his 
                         caller's features, and borrowing his 
                         clothes. 
                     
                     
                         For the first few minutes, it must be 
                         confessed that the detective was com- 
                         pletely deceived. He knew Green Eye 
                         to be a master of surprises, but it had 
                         not occurred to him to suspect that the 
                         clever rascal would resort to anything 
                         so spectacular. 
                     
                     
                         Besides, Gordon had placed himself 
                         so that the light did not fall strongly. 
                     
                     
                         It was not until Flint's caller sug- 
                         gested a change of identities that the 
                         detective began to question. It was 
                         very seldom that a client presumed to 
                         offer such assistance, and Flint's knowl- 
                         edge of Chester Gillespie had not pre- 
                         pared him for such a proposition. He 
                         gave no evidence, however, that the 
                         seed of suspicion had been planted, but 
                         fell in with the suggestion, knowing that 
                         in carrying it out, he would have the 
                         best possible opportunity of studying 
                         his visitor. 
                     
                     
                         He noted a slight hesitation on the 
                         latter's part when he had asked him to 
                     
                 
             
             
                 
                 100 Detective Story Magazine 
                 
                     
                     
                         take his place in the brightest light ob- 
                         tainable, and the subsequent scrutiny 
                         had soon confirmed his suspicions. 
                         "Gillespie" was plainly Ernest Gordon. 
                     
                     
                         No make-up could have stood that 
                         test--at least, with Thorndyke Flint at 
                         the observer's end. 
                     
                     
                         "What fools the cleverest of us are 
                         sometimes!" the detective thought, with 
                         an inward chuckle. "Gordon has such 
                         a good opinion of himself, and is so 
                         certain that a man needs only to be 
                         daring enough in order to carry every- 
                         thing before him, that he's actually will- 
                         ing to undergo this sort of thing--and 
                         he thinks he's getting away with it!" 
                     
                     
                         It was no part of the detective's plan, 
                         however, to reveal his knowledge of the 
                         deception. He wished to give the 
                         masquerader as much rope as he could, 
                         in order to find out just what Gordon 
                         was trying to do. Moreover, he was 
                         curious to visit Gillespie's house and 
                         find out how Green Eye had succeeded 
                         in making himself at home there. 
                     
                     
                         Gillespie might have been overpow- 
                         ered and stowed away somewhere, or 
                         even murdered--though that was un- 
                         likely, unless the crime had been com- 
                         mitted owing to an accident or miscal- 
                         culation on Gordon's part. 
                     
                     
                         When the detective reached Gilles- 
                         pie's house on Fifth Avenue, he found 
                         the situation just as Gordon had de- 
                         scribed it. An aged butler answered 
                         the bell, and, save for him, the big house 
                         seemed deserted. 
                     
                     
                         Flint was about to question the old 
                         man in a roundabout way in order to 
                         discover, if possible, whether there had 
                         been anything which might seem suspi- 
                         cious or not. Before he could do so, 
                         however, the butler offered a couple of 
                         letters on a salver. 
                     
                     
                         Flint took them after a second's hes- 
                         itation, studying the butler's face as he 
                         did so. From the man's squint and the 
                         lines about the eyes, he saw that the 
                         butler was nearsighted. Probably he 
                         had been in the family for a long time, 
                     
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         but this defect in his eyesight explained 
                         his failure to detect the deception. 
                     
                     
                         But where was the real Chester J. 
                         Gillespie, whose second double was 
                         now entering his house, and calmly in- 
                         specting his letters? 
                     
                     
                         Gordon had given Flint certain neces- 
                         sary particulars concerning the ar- 
                         rangement of the house, and, thanks to 
                         these, the detective mounted the stairs 
                         with the utmost assurance, leaving the 
                         nearsighted old butler bowing in the 
                         lower hall. 
                     
                     
                         He found his way to Gillespie's pri- 
                         vate room easily enough, the letters still 
                         in his hand. After looking about him 
                         curiously, and noting the certain evi- 
                         dences of recent occupancy, he sat down 
                         and glanced mechanically at the letters. 
                     
                     
                         One of them obviously was a busi- 
                         ness communication, but the other was 
                         not. 
                     
                     
                         The envelope was unusually large, 
                         and of the finest texture. As for the 
                         writing, it was big, heavy, and sprawl- 
                         ing. 
                     
                     
                         In the lower left-hand corner were 
                         the words, "Important--please for- 
                         ward," and they were heavily under- 
                         scored. 
                     
                     
                         All is fair in love and war, they say, 
                         and if that is so, all is fair in detection 
                         as well, especially when the detective is 
                         trying to safeguard the man whose 
                         identity he has temporarily appropri- 
                         ated. 
                     
                     
                         Under the circumstances, therefore, 
                         Flint felt justified in opening any of 
                         Gillespie's correspondence that seemed 
                         to promise a solution of the mystery, 
                         just as he would have ransacked the 
                         house for a similar clew. 
                     
                     
                         There might be nothing in it, of 
                         course, but this letter appeared to be 
                         somewhat out of the ordinary, and 
                         might be valuable. 
                     
                     
                         Consequently, after a little hesitation, 
                         Flint ripped the envelope open without 
                         the slightest attempt at concealment, and 
                         drew the inclosure out. Soon he was 
                     
                 
             
             
                 
                 Snarled Identities 101 
                 
                     
                     
                         very glad that he had done so, for the 
                         letter read as follows: 
                     
                     
                         Dear Old Lunatic: You do not seem to 
                         have improved in the matter of memory or 
                         level-headedness. You write me from some 
                         unpronounceable place in South America--I 
                         judge solely from the postmark--and do not 
                         tell me where to find you. How the dickens 
                         can I join you down there for a month's 
                         shooting, if you do not give me more par- 
                         ticulars? I know you too well, you see, to 
                         imagine for a moment that you stayed more 
                         than a day or two at the place from which 
                         you wrote. That was nearly two weeks ago, 
                         and by this time you may be thousands of 
                         miles away from there. 
                     
                     
                         Your letter was forwarded to me up here 
                         in Maine, and the best thing I can think of 
                         doing is to send this to your New York ad- 
                         dress, in the hope that it will be forwarded 
                         to you with as little delay as possible. 
                     
                     
                         There was a little more of it, but 
                         the rest does not matter. It was signed 
                         by a well-known young man about 
                         town. 
                     
                     
                         So that was it, was it? The only 
                         original Chester Gillespie was still 
                         down in South America, and only about 
                         two weeks before had written to a New 
                         York friend, inviting him down for a 
                         month's shooting. That argued that he 
                         did not expect to return for many 
                         weeks. In some manner, Gordon must 
                         have learned that interesting fact, and, 
                         seemingly, had disguised himself as Gil- 
                         lespie, with the aid of a photograph or 
                         photographs of that young man. 
                     
                     
                         So much for the way the trick had 
                         been sprung. For the rest, there was 
                         no doubt in Flint's mind as to Green 
                         Eye's further intentions. The criminal 
                         had learned of the detective's return, 
                         and had guessed what Flint's plan of 
                         campaign would be. 
                     
                     
                         In other words, he had concluded 
                         that Flint had the index of the records 
                         in the safe, and could easily find out 
                         which ones were missing. Knowing by 
                         that means where danger threatened, 
                         Flint could see a trap for the black- 
                         mailer, with the help of one or more of 
                         the latter's unidentified victims. 
                     
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         "He knew just about what to ex- 
                         pect," the detective mused, "and when 
                         he found that Gillespie was out of the 
                         country, having left only a couple of 
                         old people in charge of the house, he 
                         hit upon this scheme of circumventing 
                         me. If he's left alone, he'll find some 
                         means of sending Judson off on a wild- 
                         goose chase, or otherwise dispose of 
                         him, and then he'll impersonate me 
                         once more, and in that disguise he'll 
                         probably advise his victims to pay the 
                         sums demanded. 
                     
                     
                         "Oh, it's a pretty smooth scheme-- 
                         one of the smoothest anybody ever 
                         thought out! I'm afraid, however, that 
                         he's inclined to underrate my intelli- 
                         gence, and to overrate his own ability."

                         FLINT AND JUDSON COMPARE NOTES. 
                     
                     
                         IT was not until dusk that Thorndyke 
                         Flint left the Gillespie house, and 
                         when he did so, it was on foot. He had 
                         not gone more than a block or so, how- 
                         ever, before he hailed a passing taxi, 
                         and ordered the chauffeur to drive to a 
                         certain corner of Madison Avenue. 
                         The corner named was only a block 
                         from Flint's house. 
                     
                     
                         Some hours had passed since Flint 
                         had read the letter which revealed the 
                         whereabouts of the real Chester J. Gil- 
                         lespie, but he had been in no hurry to 
                         act. For one thing, he wished to give 
                         the scoundrel a sense of security in 
                         this new and climax-capping adventure. 
                     
                     
                         Flint was still disguised as Gillespie, 
                         but he was wearing a golf cap, which 
                         he had pulled down over his eyes, and 
                         a light overcoat, with upturned collar. 
                         His purpose was to get in touch with 
                         his assistant in one way or another, and 
                         his only anxiety concerned the possi- 
                         bility that Gordon had already got rid 
                         of Judson. 
                     
                     
                         Fortunately, that was not the case, 
                         and, after a wait of no more than half 
                         or three-quarters of an hour, the young

                         detective left the house, and uncon- 
                         sciously approached his chief, who was 
                         lounging at the comer. 
                     
                     
                         As he passed Flint, the latter said 
                         quietly: 
                     
                     
                         "Go around the corner and wait for 
                         me." 
                     
                     
                         His assistant stiffened slightly at the 
                         well-known voice; but that was the only 
                         sign of surprise he gave. With a grunt 
                         and a nod, he turned about at right 
                         angles into the side street, and along 
                         this Flint presently followed him. 
                     
                     
                         A short distance beyond the corner, 
                         well out of sight from Flint's house, 
                         Judson paused, and there his chief over- 
                         took him. 
                     
                     
                         "I haven't made any headway yet," 
                         Judson announced, without any pre- 
                         liminaries. "I located the car late this 
                         afternoon, but there I came to a dead 
                         stop." 
                     
                     
                         "Never mind about that," Flint said 
                         quickly. "It doesn't matter in the least. 
                         I can lay my hands on Green-eye Gor- 
                         don at any moment." 
                     
                     
                         "The deuce you can!" ejaculated 
                         Judson. "Then I should certainly say 
                         you don't need me--for the sort of leg- 
                         work I've been doing to-day, at any 
                         rate." 
                     
                     
                         "What about my double, though?" 
                         Flint put in swiftly, without giving Jud- 
                         son time to ask any questions. "Is he 
                         still at the house, and if so, what has 
                         he been doing?" 
                     
                     
                         "He's there, all right. He's been 
                         writing letters in the bedroom. He de- 
                         clined to use the study." 
                     
                     
                         "Ah!" Flint murmured,, in a peculiar 
                         tone. "Letters, eh? Has he mailed 
                         them?" 
                     
                     
                         "No. I offered to do it for him a lit- 
                         tle while ago, but he said he would be 
                         going out himself later on." 
                     
                     
                         Flint thought over this information 
                         for a minute or two, while his assistant 
                         watched him questioningly. 
                     
                     
                         "Did you happen to see any of the 
                         letters?" Flint inquired at length, rous- 
                     
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         ing himself from his abstraction. "I 
                         mean, could you tell whether they were 
                         stamped or not?" 
                     
                     
                         His assistant nodded. 
                     
                     
                         "I got a squint at a little pile of 
                         them," he admitted. "The top one was 
                         stamped, but I could not say as to the 
                         rest." 
                     
                     
                         This required further thought on 
                         Flint's part. He was tempted, of 
                         course, to end matters then and there, 
                         before those letters could reach their 
                         destination, and cause the consternation 
                         they were certain to create. On the 
                         other hand, he felt it necessary to give 
                         Gordon a little more leeway, and, in 
                         order to do that, it seemed essential 
                         that the letters be mailed. 
                     
                     
                         He had searched Gillespie's private 
                         rooms, on the theory that Green Eye 
                         might have left the stolen papers there, 
                         but he had found nothing of the sort. 
                         Yet, it was imperative that these papers 
                         be recovered, if possible, at the same 
                         time the rascal was captured. 
                     
                     
                         Unless that were done, the precious 
                         records might not be returned at all, 
                         for certainly Gordon could not be 
                         counted on to restore them voluntarily. 
                     
                     
                         To be sure, the fact that he had been 
                         writing those letters--doubtless, black- 
                         mailing ones;--under Flint's own roof, 
                         suggested that he had the documents 
                         there to refer to. That, however, was 
                         by no means certain, for he might have 
                         put the records in some remote place, 
                         perhaps a safe-deposit vault, after mak- 
                         ing a list of the names and addresses 
                         desired. 
                     
                     
                         Therefore, it seemed wise to give the 
                         fellow his head, for the time, and mean- 
                         while, to keep him under observation, 
                         in the hope that his movements would 
                         give some hint as to his possession or 
                         nonpossession of Flint's papers. 
                     
                     
                         The detective was about to explain 
                         this to his assistant when the latter 
                         broke in excitedly. 
                     
                     
                         "For the love of Pete! What's up?" 
                         he demanded. "What are you cooking

                         up in that brain of yours, and why arc 
                         you so curious about Gillespie's 
                         doings?" 
                     
                     
                         "Gillespie is down in South America, 
                         Judson," Flint returned quietly. "That's 
                         why. Our friend back there in the 
                         house is--well, you can guess, I 
                         imagine." 
                     
                     
                         And then he proceeded to give his in- 
                         structions to the dumfounded Judson.

                         he stood before a glass in his dressing 
                         room. 
                     
                     
                         He was a tall man, and the sixty 
                         years that had passed over his head 
                         had left him his rather slim and up- 
                         right figure. His hair was white, but 
                         abundant, and, on the whole, he had 
                         good reason to consider himself a hand- 
                         some and well-preserved man. 
                     
                     
                         "Is there anything else, sir?'' his 
                         valet asked respectfully. 
                     
                     
                         "No," the ex-senator answered. "It's 
                         probable that I shall be very late, so 
                         you need not wait up." 
                     
                     
                         "Thank you, sir. Shall I ring for 
                         your car?" 
                     
                     
                         "No, no! A taxi will do." 
                     
                     
                         Possibly the ghost of a smile curved 
                         the lips of the valet, but if so, it was 
                         quickly gone. If his employer chose 
                         to keep his movements secret, that was 
                         his employer's business. 
                     
                     
                         Ex-Senator Phelps took the light 
                         coat and silk hat that were handed to 
                         him, and strolled toward the door. He 
                         was a single man, but his position in the 
                         world had made it necessary for him 
                         to keep up a rather pretentious estab- 
                         lishment. 
                     
                     
                         He stood in the doorway holding a 
                         cigar as the taxi drove up, but at that 
                         moment his valet, who had followed 
                         him as if to close the door, spoke up 
                         in a surprised tone. 
                     
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         "I beg your pardon, sir," he said, 
                         "but this was lying on the floor. You 
                         stepped over it just now without know- 
                         ing it. It's addressed to you, and 
                         marked 'Urgent.' It's stamped, but not 
                         postmarked--looks as if it had been 
                         slipped under the door instead." 
                     
                     
                         Ex-Senator Phelps took the envelope 
                         with a careless air, and no premonition 
                         chilled him as he stepped back into the 
                         light of the hall and tore it open. As 
                         he glanced at the single sheet of paper, 
                         however, his face turned ghastly, and 
                         he reeled against a small statue that 
                         stood on a pedestal, throwing it to the 
                         floor and breaking it. 
                     
                     
                         "After all these years!" he muttered 
                         hoarsely to himself. Then his eyes fell 
                         upon the amazed face of his valet, and, 
                         as he crushed the letter in his hand, he 
                         made a great effort to pull himself to- 
                         gether. "I--I shall not be going out, 
                         after all," he said, in a curiously dead 
                         voice. "I'm not--feeling well." 
                     
                     
                         Every year of the sixty seemed to 
                         weigh heavily upon the ex-senator as he 
                         pushed open the door of the room on 
                         the left. His feet dragged across the 
                         thick carpet, so that he stumbled, and 
                         when he dropped into a chair, buried 
                         his face in his hands. 
                     
                     
                         The Forty-second Street Theater had 
                         been famous for years as the home of 
                         light comedy of the more brilliant sort. 
                     
                     
                         That night was to witness a new pro- 
                         duction, for which great things were 
                         expected--for had the play not been 
                         written by one of America's cleverest 
                         and most experienced playwrights, and 
                         staged by a production wizard? And 
                         was not the star Harold Lumsden? 
                     
                     
                         Already the cheaper parts of the 
                         house were packed, and the orchestra 
                         was filling up. Here and there a pair 
                         of white shoulders gleamed in one of 
                         the boxes which would soon be filled-- 
                         for it was a foregone conclusion that 
                         the S. R. O. sign would have to be dis- 
                         played in the lobby that night. 
                     
                 
             
             
                 
                 104 Detective Story Magazine 
                 
                     
                     
                         Harold Lumsden himself was peer- 
                         ing through a peephole in the curtain at 
                         that moment, idly surveying the 
                         nucleus of what he knew would prove 
                         to be an unusually brilliant first-night 
                         audience. For years he had enjoyed 
                         great prestige, and this was to be his 
                         first appearance following a successful 
                         invasion of London, which had added 
                         greatly to his laurels. 
                     
                     
                         "This is going to be some night, Har- 
                         old!" his manager remarked im- 
                         pressively, coming up from behind and 
                         putting his hand on the star's shoulder. 
                         "Dressed early, didn't you?" 
                     
                     
                         "Yes, I felt restless," was the reply. 
                         "Hanged if I know why. This sort of 
                         thing ought to be an old story to me 
                         by this time, if it's ever going to be." 
                     
                     
                         As he turned about to face the portly 
                         manager, he noticed an envelope in the 
                         latter's hand. Knowing the manager's 
                         absent-mindedness, he inquired: 
                     
                     
                         "That letter isn't for me, is it?" 
                     
                     
                         "Why, yes, it is," was the reply. "I 
                         had forgotten it for a moment. It's 
                         marked 'Urgent,' but I suppose it's only 
                         from some friend of yours--or, more 
                         likely, some friend of a friend--who 
                         aspires to the deadhead class." 
                     
                     
                         "Probably," Harold Lumsden agreed, 
                         as he glanced at the handwriting for a 
                         moment, and then ripped the envelope 
                         open. "We haven't needed to 'paper' 
                         our houses for the last few seasons, 
                         have we, old man? What's this! 
                         Great heavens!" 
                     
                     
                         The distinguished actor clutched at 
                         one of the wings for support, and the 
                         letter fluttered to the ground. The man- 
                         ager stopped to pick it up, but with an 
                         oath the star forestalled him, seizing 
                         the letter hastily and thrusting it into 
                         his pocket. 
                     
                     
                         "Bad news?" the manager asked 
                         anxiously. 
                     
                     
                         "A rather disagreeable surprise," 
                         Lumsden managed to say, making a 
                         strenuous attempt to control himself. 
                         "It's nothing you know anything about, 
                     
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         you know, and I'll be all right, never 
                         fear." 
                     
                     
                         Harold Lumsden played the part that 
                         night, for there was nothing else to do, 
                         and the traditions of his profession 
                         demand that an actor or actress should 
                         always appear, unless ill in bed, no mat- 
                         ter what news may have been received, 
                         or what tragedy may have been left at 
                         home. 
                     
                     
                         But some idea of the sort of per- 
                         formance the famous star gave on that 
                         memorable occasion might have been 
                         gathered from the newspaper com- 
                         ments the following morning, for all 
                         the critics seemed to agree that Lums- 
                         den was far from himself, and that his 
                         conception of the part was strangely 
                         heavy and lifeless. 
                     
                     
                         Such was the effect of Green-eye 
                         Gordon's second demand. There were 
                         other letters--several of them, in fact 
                         --but we need not trace their influence 
                         here. 
                     
                     
                         There was no doubt that the black- 
                         mailer had struck some stunning blows, 
                         expecting that gold would flow from 
                         the wounds thus inflicted. 
                     
                     
                         CHAPTER XLVII. 
                     
                     
                         THE BLACKMAILER ADVISES HIS VICTIM. 
                     
                     
                         ERNEST GORDON was inclined to 
                         consider the world a pretty good 
                         place, as he finished his breakfast in 
                         Flint's dining room the following morn- 
                         ing. Everything had gone very well, 
                         thus far, and he seemed to have reason 
                         for self-congratulation. 
                     
                     
                         He had peddled the letters around 
                         himself the night before, thus saving 
                         time, and making it more difficult to 
                         trace them, as he believed. He did not 
                         know that he had been shadowed 
                         throughout by Judson, who thereby 
                         knew just what victims the blackmailer 
                         had chosen for his first broadside. 
                     
                     
                         Later he had returned to the detec- 
                         tive's house, and so had Judson; then 
                         there had come a telephone message to 
                     
                 
             
             
                 
                 Snarled Identities 105 
                 
                     
                     
                         the latter from Flint, sending the young 
                         detective out of town for at least 
                         twenty-four, if not forty-eight, hours. 
                     
                     
                         That unexpected turn of affairs had 
                         caused Gordon great satisfaction when 
                         Judson gloomily confided the news to 
                         him. 
                     
                     
                         "The chief seems to think that fel- 
                         low Gordon has doubled back, and is 
                         hiding not far from New Pelham," the 
                         assistant informed "Gillespie." "He 
                         still hopes he'll turn up at your place, 
                         and is going to wait there all of to-mor- 
                         row, if not longer, but he wants me to 
                         get busy, and see if I can locate Gordon 
                         independently. It seems unnecessary 
                         to me, but what he says goes. The 
                         worst of it is, though, I've got my or- 
                         ders to pull up stakes at once." 
                     
                     
                         Of course, Gordon did not know that 
                         this was all a put-up job. Flint, by 
                         seeming to play into the rascal's hands, 
                         had worked out this scheme, in order 
                         to get Judson out of the way, so that 
                         Gordon would not feel compelled to 
                         take strong measures to accomplish the 
                         same object. 
                     
                     
                         As a result, Green Eye had slept 
                         alone at Flint's that night--except for 
                         the servants--and now, after a good 
                         breakfast, looked forward to a day of 
                         undisturbed peace and freedom to do 
                         whatever circumstances might require. 
                     
                     
                         First, however, it was necessary for 
                         him to absent himself temporarily, in 
                         order to make up as Flint once more. 
                         Therefore, he made a flying trip to One 
                         Hundred and Twenty-fifth Street, and 
                         there disguised himself, returning as 
                         fast as the taxi could carry him. 
                     
                     
                         When he reentered the detective's 
                         residence, it was in the character of the 
                         owner. 
                     
                     
                         "Has any one called up or been to see 
                         me?" he asked the butler. 
                     
                     
                         "No, sir," was the reply, a welcome 
                         one to the scoundrel, for it meant that 
                         none of his victims had yet sought the 
                         detective. 
                     
                     
                         He did not have long to wait, how- 
                     
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         ever, for hardly more than half an hour 
                         later the butler entered the study, and 
                         presented a card, which bore the name 
                         of ex-Senator William Deane Phelps. 
                     
                     
                         "Show him up," the supposed detec- 
                         tive said, with a glow of anticipation. 
                     
                     
                         The butler turned on his heel to obey, 
                         and if Green-eye Gordon grinned be- 
                         hind his back, his face was serious 
                         enough in expression as the ex-senator 
                         nervously entered and closed the door 
                         behind him. 
                     
                     
                         In the few hours that had passed 
                         since he had received the threatening 
                         letter, a great change had come over 
                         this man, whose name was known from 
                         one end of the country to the other. It 
                         was plain that he had not slept, and 
                         there were heavy, loose bags of skin 
                         under his eyes. His face was almost 
                         grayish in hue. 
                     
                     
                         "I feared that you would feel com- 
                         pelled to come here before long, sen- 
                         ator," the impostor said gravely. 
                     
                     
                         "Then you know?" his visitor asked, 
                         in surprise. 
                     
                     
                         "Yes," Gordon answered. "Some 
                         one knows the facts in regard to-- 
                         well, we need not go into the case-- 
                         and is attempting to blackmail you." 
                     
                     
                         Phelps sank into a chair and drew 
                         a sheet of paper from his pocket. 
                     
                     
                         "The infernal scoundrel demands one 
                         hundred and fifty thousand--no less!" 
                         he said hoarsely. "It isn't so much the 
                         money, but I--I naturally assumed that 
                         you alone held my secret." 
                     
                     
                         Green Eye rose to his feet, and his 
                         face was very solemn. 
                     
                     
                         "Until a short time ago that was the 
                         case," he answered, and crossed to the 
                         safe. "The records were here, and you 
                         will see that it has been burgled. If 
                         it's any comfort to you, though. I'll tell 
                         you that you are not the only one who 
                         will suffer." 
                     
                     
                         "I care nothing about that," Phelps 
                         said angrily. "It's my own plight that 
                         interests me to the exclusion of every- 
                         thing else. Do you wonder? This is

                         terrible, Flint, terrible! I thought I 
                         could trust you, and now, after all this 
                         time, I find that I've been living in a 
                         fool's paradise." 
                     
                     
                         The criminal interrupted him with a 
                         dignified gesture. 
                     
                     
                         "I don't think I deserve that, sen- 
                         ator," he said quietly. "Thorndyke 
                         Flint has never yet betrayed a secret. 
                         Much as I regret this unfortunate oc- 
                         currence, however, I don't see how I 
                         can be held responsible for it. I didn't 
                         rob my own safe, and certainly I 
                         wouldn't have chosen to have it robbed, 
                         if I could have helped it." 
                     
                     
                         "That's neither here nor there!" de- 
                         clared the ex-senator. "Why didn't 
                         you destroy the records?" 
                     
                     
                         "Do you expect me to destroy my 
                         stock in trade, or burn up the reference 
                         books I have had occasion to consult 
                         countless times?" 
                     
                     
                         "I hadn't thought of it in that light," 
                         Phelps confessed. "Even that doesn't 
                         make it any easie[r] to bear, however. 
                         What can I do?" 
                     
                     
                         "I'm sorry to say that I see nothing 
                         for you to do, except to pay," Green 
                         Eye answered, fingering the letter 
                         which had been handed him. 
                     
                     
                         Phelps looked at him in amazement. 
                     
                     
                         "You actually give me that advice!" 
                         he murmured. 
                     
                     
                         Green Eye nodded. 
                     
                     
                         "I know I'm disappointing you," he 
                         said, "but that's the best advice I can 
                         give under the circumstances. It may 
                         sound strange, but we must face the 
                         facts. I know perfectly well who is 
                         at the bottom of this, and I have to 
                         confess that he's one of the shrewdest 
                         men who ever defied the law. He's 
                         amazingly daring, senator, and you 
                         may be sure he means exactly what he 
                         says. He'll drag this whole unsavory 
                         business into the light, if you don't stop 
                         his mouth with gold, and stop it with- 
                         out delay." 
                     
                     
                         "But aren't you going to--" 
                     
                     
                         "Of course, I'm going to do every- 
                     
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         thing I can to catch him, senator," the 
                         criminal interrupted, in a tone which 
                         seemed to imply that that was a matter 
                         of course. "If possible, I shall try to 
                         trap him just after you have met his 
                         demands, and while he has the money 
                         on his person. I cannot promise, how- 
                         ever, to catch him to-day, or this week, 
                         and, knowing his methods as well as I 
                         do, I know that you can't afford to risk 
                         any delay. The chances are, of course, 
                         that I can make him disgorge, and that 
                         you'll get your money back, but the im- 
                         portant thing is to play safe, isn't it?" 
                     
                     
                         Ex-Senator Phelps nodded slowly 
                         and hopelessly. 
                     
                     
                         "I suppose you're right," he agreed. 
                         "I had hoped for immediate help, Flint, 
                         for something that would put new hope 
                         into me. Evidently, I expected too 
                         much, though. I'll do as you say, of 
                         course, and try to believe that every- 
                         thing will come out all right. Good 
                         morning." 
                     
                     
                         And with that he left the room, walk- 
                         ing as if he were seventy instead of 
                         sixty. 
                     
                     
                         "Number one!" Green-eye Gordon 
                         chuckled as he leaned back in his seat. 
                         "A hundred and fifty thousand isn't 
                         bad for a starter. I wonder who will 
                         be the next?" 
                     
                     
                         CHAPTER XLVIII. 
                     
                     
                         UP AGAINST IT AT LAST. 
                     
                     
                         A FEW minutes later, the front-door 
                         bell rang again, and this time the 
                         salver which the butler presented to 
                         his supposed employer bore the card of 
                         Harold Lumsden. 
                     
                     
                         Gordon nodded impassively. 
                     
                     
                         "Very well," he said. 
                     
                     
                         ''I only hope he'll prove worth the 
                         trouble," he told himself, as the butler 
                         left the room. "He's a spendthrift, of 
                         course. Money turns to water and 
                         runs through his fingers, no matter how 
                         fast it comes in. He's just back from 
                         London, however, and I hardly think 
                     
                 
             
             
                 
                 Snarled Identities 107 
                 
                     
                     
                         he has already squandered everything 
                         he picked up over there." 
                     
                     
                         Then the door opened, and a tragic 
                         figure entered. The caller's face was 
                         haggard, his eyes wild, his hair disor- 
                         dered. Even his clothing seemed care- 
                         lessly worn and ill fitting, though Lums- 
                         den had always been considered one of 
                         the best-dressed men in the profession. 
                         Certainly he did not look like a 
                         comedian now, successful or otherwise. 
                     
                     
                         "Something terrible has happened!" 
                         he burst out. "Mr. Flint, I am being 
                         blackmailed! Somebody has learned 
                         the secret which I thought safe with 
                         you, and has demanded an enormous 
                         sum of money. It means my ruin, un- 
                         less--" 
                     
                     
                         "I know all about it, I am sorry to 
                         say," the bogus detective interrupted. 
                     
                     
                         Once more he gave a brief and very 
                         unsatisfactory explanation, pointing to 
                         the rifled safe, and winding up with a 
                         statement of his belief that there was 
                         nothing to do but to pay--"just as a 
                         temporary expedient, of course." 
                     
                     
                         Naturally, that advice did not appeal 
                         to the actor any more than it had to ex- 
                         Senator Phelps, but Gordon adroitly 
                         argued him into a somewhat less im- 
                         patient mood. 
                     
                     
                         "How much does he want?" 
                     
                     
                         "A cool hundred thousand," was the 
                         bitter reply, and it did not convey any 
                         real news to the man in Flint's desk 
                         chair. "And I haven't more than eighty 
                         thousand to my name!" 
                     
                     
                         "The devil you haven't!" Green Eye 
                         exclaimed harshly. "Not after that 
                         London engagement?" 
                     
                     
                         He had spoken without thinking, and 
                         did not realize what he had said until 
                         the caller looked sharply at him. 
                     
                     
                         "I beg your pardon, Lumsden!" he 
                         hastened to say. "That must have 
                         sounded impertinent, I'm afraid. I 
                         meant no offense, I assure you. It was 
                         merely surprise. You know, we out- 
                         siders are inclined to think that you 
                         popular actors are made of money." 
                     
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         "Well, we're not," the other an- 
                         swered, as if slightly mollified. "What 
                         shall I do?" 
                     
                     
                         "Pay what you can," Gordon an- 
                         swered promptly. "I know it doesn't 
                         appeal to you, my friend, but as I have 
                         said, it's only temporary. I'll have the 
                         fellow where I want him in short order, 
                         you may be sure. This is only in the 
                         nature of insurance to keep the rascal 
                         from carrying out his threats before I 
                         can stop his activities." 
                     
                     
                         That seemed to appeal strongly to the 
                         actor. 
                     
                     
                         "It's asking a good deal to trust 
                         everything to you, including my whole 
                         bank roll, when the trouble originated 
                         through you," he said. "However, I 
                         see nothing else to do. I'll do as you 
                         suggest. Anything is better than ex- 
                         posure, and I can always earn more 
                         money if I have to see the last of this." 
                     
                     
                         He paused for a moment. 
                     
                     
                         "By Jove!" he ejaculated. "You 
                         have made me feel that I shan't be 
                         comfortable until I've paid the money 
                         over. If you don't mind, I'll make out 
                         a check to self right now, and take it 
                         to the bank to be cashed, so that I can 
                         turn over the currency to the scoun- 
                         drel when he comes." 
                     
                     
                         Green Eye had no objection to that, 
                         of course; in fact, it brought an an- 
                         ticipatory glitter to his eyes. With 
                         shaking hands, Lumsden took a check 
                         book from his pocket, seating himself 
                         in the chair which Gordon vacated for 
                         the purpose. When he tried to write, 
                         however, he found it exceedingly diffi- 
                         cult to do so. 
                     
                     
                         "Confound it!" he cried impatiently. 
                         "See how infernally nervous I am! 
                         Would you mind filling this in for 
                         eighty thousand, Mr. Flint, and then 
                         I'll try to sign it." 
                     
                     
                         "Gladly," Green Eye said, with 
                         alacrity, reseating himself in the va- 
                         cated chair, and taking the pen from 
                         his visitor's trembling hand. 
                     
                 
             
             
                 
                 108 Detective Story Magazine 
                 
                     
                     
                         The masquerading criminal held 
                         down the cover of the little check book 
                         with his left hand, while he began to 
                         write with the other. Lumsden leaned 
                         over his shoulder, watching him, as if 
                         ready to try his luck at signing his 
                         name as soon as the rest of the check 
                         was filled in. His hand slipped into 
                         his pocket, however, and when it came 
                         out silently, there was something in it 
                         which had a metallic gleam. 
                     
                     
                         "Ah! Thanks!" he exclaimed, a mo- 
                         ment or two later. "You have made it 
                         very easy for me, Gordon!" 
                     
                     
                         Simultaneously, there was a sudden, 
                         unlooked-for swoop, followed quickly 
                         by the click of a pair of handcuffs as 
                         they closed on Green Eye's wrists. 
                     
                     
                         And the voice which uttered the 
                         mocking words was not the voice of 
                         Harold Lumsden, but that of Thorn- 
                         dyke Flint himself. Gordon knew it 
                         after the first word or two, and even if 
                         he had not done so, the action which 
                         went along with it would have been en- 
                         lightening enough. 
                     
                     
                         "Flint, by Heaven!" the rogue cried 
                         hoarsely, jumping to his feet and over- 
                         turning the chair. 
                     
                     
                         "Flint--exactly," the detective 
                         agreed, removing the wig which had 
                         played such a large part in transform- 
                         ing him into Harold Lumsden. "You 
                         didn't think you were going to have 
                         this little masked ball all to yourself, 
                         did you?" 
                     
                     
                         After the first dazed shock--a merely 
                         momentary one--had passed, Gordon's 
                         face seemed to grow actually black with 
                         rage and hatred. 
                     
                     
                         "You may think you have me, curse 
                         you!" he snarled. "But I'll show 
                         you--" 
                     
                     
                         He leaped forward, his manacled 
                         arms raised to strike together. Flint 
                         quietly side-stepped the mad, bull-like 
                         rush, but Green Eye turned and 
                         charged him again. 
                     
                     
                         There was one more surprise await- 
                         ing him, though. 
                     
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         The door opened, and Judson en- 
                         tered, coolly fingering an automatic. 
                     
                     
                         "Pretty neat weapon, isn't it, Gor- 
                         don?" he asked, in a matter-of-fact 
                         tone, then stopped in feigned surprise. 
                         "Oh, you and Mr. Flint are having an 
                         argument? Hope you don't think I've 
                         butted in. Now that I'm here, though, 
                         I think I might as well stay. You look 
                         as if you needed your wrists slapped, 
                         and the chief may not care to bother 
                         with it." 
                     
                     
                         The escaped convict had halted in his 
                         tracks at the first interruption, and was 
                         now looking from the detective to his 
                         assistant with baffled rage. He would 
                         have liked to fight it out to a finish, but 
                         his shrewdness told him that he would 
                         gain nothing by such a course, and it 
                         was one of his rules never to exert him- 
                         self unnecessarily. 
                     
                     
                         The consequence was that he merely 
                         shrugged his shoulders. 
                     
                     
                         "So be it," he said quietly. "You 
                         fellows can trump my ace, I see. Let 
                         me remind you, however, that you 
                         haven't got that gold that our mutual 
                         friend, John Simpson, took such a lik- 
                         ing to. Likewise, you're a long way 
                         from the possession of those papers 
                         which you were foolish enough to keep 
                         in a more or less ordinary safe." 
                     
                     
                         Flint and Judson looked at each 
                         other and grinned. 
                     
                     
                         "Think so?" queried the former. 
                         "I'm afraid, in that case, that you are 
                         scheduled to receive another disagree- 
                         able surprise or two. I located the gold 
                         yesterday afternoon--in one of Gilles- 
                         pie's closets. As for the missing rec- 
                         ords, I feel very sure that we shall dis- 
                         cover them on you." 
                     
                     
                         And they did. 
                     
                     
                         Therefore, there was no need of de- 
                         lay, and No. 39,470 Clinton was shipped 
                         northward to Dannemora the next 
                         day, under escort. 
                     
                     
                         "Lucky for us that he belonged to the 
                         'Gray Brotherhood,' " Flint remarked 
                         to Griswold, when he turned a little 
                     
                 
             
             
                 
                 Snarled Identities 109 
                 
                     
                     
                         over seventy-five thousand dollars in 
                         gold over to him. "Otherwise, he 
                         would have gone scot-free, just as in 
                         the case of Simpson. As it is, he'll get 
                         something extra for his escape, at least, 
                     
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         and I don't believe he'll have a chance 
                         to slip away again." 
                     
                     
                         "But another case like this would 
                         give me heart disease, I'm afraid," he 
                         added to himself. 
                     
                 
                 
                     THE END. 
                 
                 
                     
                         DECADE'S MURDERS AND HOMICIDES 
                     
                     
                         THE most "murderous" city in all the world is Memphis, Tennessee, where 63.7 
                         persons out of every one hundred thousand lose their lives by violence, 
                         according to statistics for the decade 1904-1913, prepared by the Spectator, an 
                         insurance journal, in an article on the "Homicide Record of 1914." 
                     
                     
                         Six other Southern cities hold records for "killings," while New York City-- 
                         Manhattan and the Bronx--with its enormous population, is a peaceful, law- 
                         abiding place, ranking only sixteenth out of the thirty registration cities used. 
                     
                     
                         The thirty cities, arranged in the order of "killings," together with the rate 
                         per one hundred thousand of population, are: 
                     
                     
                         Memphis, 63.7; Charleston, South Carolina, 32.7; Savannah, 28.4; Atlanta, 
                         26; New Orleans, 25.3; Nashville, 24.3; Louisville, 16.6; St. Louis, 12.9; San 
                         Francisco, 11.8; Cincinnati, xi; Chicago, 9.3; Seattle, 8.1; Spokane, 7.8; Wash- 
                         ington, 7.5; Cleveland, 6.1; Manhattan and the Bronx, New York, 6.1; Dayton, 
                         Ohio, 5.5; Pittsburgh, 5.3; Providence, 5.2; Boston, 4.8; Baltimore, 4.6; Brook- 
                         lyn, 4.5; Philadelphia, 4.2; Buffalo, 4; Minneapolis, 3.7; Reading, Pennsylvania, 
                         3.5; Rochester, New York, 3.3; Hartford, Connecticut, 3; Newark, New Jer- 
                         sey, 3; Milwaukee, 2.4. 
                     
                     
                         There were 11,981 homicides in the thirty cities for the decade, or an average 
                         of 7.9 per one hundred thousand of population for the whole area. The figures 
                         for 1914 show 1,489 murders for the same area, at the rate of 8.6 per one hun- 
                         dred thousand population, which, if continued for ten years, would make the 
                         total for the decade 14,890. 
                     
                     
                         Assuming that the recorded murder death rate for the registration area may 
                         be applied safely to the whole country, more than fifty thousand human lives 
                         have been deliberately sacrificed. The increase in murder during 1914, as com- 
                         pared with the ten years ending 1913 was most marked on the Pacific coast and 
                         in the Southern States. 
                     
                     
                         The Eastern cities show the murder of 4.9 persons out of every one hundred 
                         thousand population for 1904-1913, and 5.1 persons for 1914; the central cities 
                         show 8.6, and in 1914, 9.3; while the Southern cities 18.2 for the 1904-1913 decade 
                         and 20.4 for the year 1914 and Pacific-coast cities, xo, and an increase to 12.8 
                         for 1914. 
                     
                     
                         Among males, 62.8 per cent of the deaths are caused by firearms, and among 
                         females 52.2 per cent, while cutting or piercing instruments caused 15.7 per cent, 
                         and among females 12.7 per cent of the deaths. The mortality was highest 
                         between the ages of twenty-five and thirty-four years. 
                     
                     
                         The number of murders in the United States is about one hundred for every 
                         thirteen committed in England and Wales, thirty in Australia, thirty-one in 
                         Prussia, and fifty-six in Italy.

                         BERTRAM J. RITCHIE was a 
                         mining chemist in Dawson, and 
                         he was not making money. He 
                         was a failure there, as he had 
                         been at home. Behold him pacing the 
                         floor of his laboratory and swearing 
                         aloud to the bare walls and meager 
                         furnishings that he had but one desire 
                         in life, which was to get away from 
                         Dawson. 
                     
                     
                         The reason why he did not leave 
                         Dawson was to be found in his 
                         trousers pocket. He could not pay his 
                         way. It was equally true that he could 
                         not remain, except to starve, unless for- 
                         tune relented. He would much rather 
                         have seen a chance to get out than a 
                         chance to stay and make his living. He 
                         was sick of the place. 
                     
                     
                         In most respects it had proved to be 
                         just what he had anticipated. He had 
                         always possessed a singular talent for 
                         discounting misfortune. It may be said 
                         that his single reason for satisfaction 
                         with himself was that he had never 
                         been so foolish as to look for good luck 
                         anywhere. Yet of all the calamities 
                         that he had foreseen in this particular 
                         adventure, none could approach in the 
                         quality of misery the one that he had 
                         encountered unexpectedly. It struck 
                     
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         him as a last proof of fate's injustice 
                         that in coming to that howling wilder- 
                         ness he should have run into a snare of 
                         love. 
                     
                     
                         Yet he perceived it very early. The 
                         first time he met Jennie Winsted he 
                         knew why she was there. He reasoned 
                         it all out after their first half hour of 
                         acquaintance. 
                     
                     
                         Miss Winsted was in Dawson City, 
                         in her father's care, though her version 
                         was that she had come to take care of 
                         him. He was a person about whom 
                         nobody seemed to know very much-- 
                         in which respect he was by no means 
                         singular in that city. He said that he 
                         came from Boston, and no man could 
                         prove the contrary. He seemed to 
                         have plenty of money, for he and his 
                         daughter lived as well as people could 
                         live in that region at that time. It 
                         was said that Winsted was prepared to 
                         speculate in mining properties, but he 
                         was not known to do anything of that 
                         sort in the first months of his residence 
                         there. 
                     
                     
                         He was a singularly placid indi- 
                         vidual, on the surface; a man of strong 
                         frame, of a genial countenance--such 
                         as Capital wears when depicted hand

                         cartoon--and of most benign de- 
                         meanor. It is not to be supposed that 
                         he favored Ritchie's attentions to his 
                         daughter, yet he viewed them with the 
                         most unmoved composure, and put no 
                         perceptible obstacle in the young man's 
                         way. Unfortunately, the daughter was 
                         quite as calm as her father, by which 
                         token Ritchie knew that he had not one 
                         chance in a million of winning her. 
                         And it was all preposterous, anyway, 
                         because he was a poor beggar, who 
                         would never be richer, and would prob- 
                         ably starve to death in the coming win- 
                         ter. The only thing for him to do was 
                         to pull up stakes and get away, so that 
                         he might be spared the humiliation of 
                         starving in her presence. But a man 
                         must have either money or exceptional 
                         nerve to get out of that country, and 
                         Ritchie had neither. 
                     
                     
                         The information which has been im- 
                         parted to the reader was the basis of 
                         Ritchie's reflections, as he paced the 
                         floor of his laboratory, anathematizing 
                         fate. His steps and the flow of his 
                         language were interrupted by the sound 
                         of voices and the creaking of a stair- 
                         case. Presently three men entered the 
                         room. One of them he knew slightly, 
                         the second he remembered having seen, 
                         and the third was a tall young English- 
                         man who was a total stranger to his 
                         eye. 
                     
                     
                         "Good morning, Professor Ritchie," 
                         said number one, whose name was 
                         Atherton. "Shake hands with my 
                         partner, Mr. Tripp, and then with Mr. 
                         Medway, of London." 
                     
                     
                         Ritchie said "Good morning," and 
                         acknowledged the introductions in the 
                         manner suggested. 
                     
                     
                         "We've come on a little matter of 
                         business," Atherton continued. "I sup- 
                         pose you know all about my uncle's 
                         claim, up Burnt Creek?" 
                     
                     
                         "I know that your uncle died a short 
                         time ago," replied Ritchie, "and that 
                         you were supposed to be his heir. I 
                         also knew that he had dug quite a hole 
                     
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         in the ground, alongside of Burnt 
                         Creek. I believe he called it the Yel- 
                         low Dog, didn't he?" 
                     
                     
                         "Right you are," responded Ather- 
                         ton; "that was his name for it. Well, 
                         the estate is all squared up, now, and 
                         the Yellow Dog is mine, or, to be exact, 
                         two-thirds belong to me and one-third 
                         to Mr. Tripp. To tell the truth, I 
                         didn't believe the claim was good for 
                         anything until a few days ago, when I 
                         got my legal business settled, and took 
                         it into my head to have a look at the 
                         Yellow Dog. Tripp and I went up 
                         there, and we came back with the con- 
                         clusion that that dog was a valuable 
                         animal. He is yellow with gold, pro- 
                         fessor. Mr. Medway, also, has had a 
                         look at him, and he wants to buy him." 
                     
                     
                         "Well, you know," said Medway, 
                         apologetically, "I'm considering. I'm 
                         not altogether convinced; but, upon 
                         my word, the ore looks good--and I've 
                         seen a good deal of that kind of rock; 
                         really, I have, you know." 
                     
                     
                         "We want you to make the assay," 
                         said Tripp. "There's a boxful of speci- 
                         mens outside, on a wagon. They were 
                         taken under Mr. Medway's eye, and 
                         according to his directions--and I'm 
                         bound to say that he's all right when 
                         it comes to that sort of business." 
                     
                     
                         "I sampled the main lode at intervals 
                         of ten feet," said Medway, "breaking 
                         the ore across the full width. You'll 
                         find everything in good shape for your 
                         work, and, when that's done, we shall 
                         know as much about this matter as any- 
                         body can know about a mine." 
                     
                     
                         "You see," said Atherton, "this is all 
                         an open negotiation. All we want is to 
                         get at the real value of the property, 
                         and no advantage to be taken on either 
                         side. Is that right, gentlemen?" 
                     
                     
                         Tripp nodded with a somewhat sav- 
                         age emphasis, for he happened to be 
                         biting off a piece of plug tobacco at 
                         the time, and the Englishman said, 
                         "Quite so," very politely. 
                     
                     
                         During this conversation Ritchie had

                         been consulting his memory regarding 
                         Atherton with a result exceedingly 
                         meager in the matter of good report. 
                         He had had so bad a reputation just 
                         before his uncle's death that that event 
                         had been viewed by many with sus- 
                         picion. As frequently happens in such 
                         cases, the discovery that the suspicion 
                         was baseless had gone far to rehabili- 
                         tate the young man in popular esteem. 
                         Moreover, he will gain friends who 
                         falls heir to properly; and Atherton's 
                         uncle had been reputed well off, though 
                         he was one of those men whose left 
                         hand does not know what the right 
                         hand doeth. 
                     
                     
                         Tripp had the air of an "old-timer," 
                         and he did not look honest. Medway, 
                         the Englishman, bore himself like a 
                         gentleman. He was probably thirty 
                         years old, but he looked much younger; 
                         and he had the unduly confident man- 
                         ner of a smart boy. 
                     
                     
                         Altogether, the case seemed clear 
                         enough--a matter of a lamb and two 
                         wolves. The chemist felt a strong dis- 
                         inclination to assist in the slaughter. 
                         However, if certain samples of ore 
                         were offered him for analysis, he could 
                         hardly do less than put them through 
                         the process, and pocket his fee. 
                     
                     
                         At the suggestion of Atherton, his 
                         partner and the Briton went down to 
                         get the box of ore. No sooner was the 
                         door closed behind them, than Ather- 
                         ton turned quickly toward the chemist, 
                         and, walking up close to him, said, in 
                         a low, intense tone: "There is money 
                         in this for you, if you do the right 
                         thing." Ritchie felt that he ought to be 
                         angry, but it simply wasn't in him. He 
                         had worried and suffered until he 
                         hadn't energy left for a strong senti- 
                         ment of any kind. 
                     
                     
                         "Bogus report, I suppose?" he said 
                         wearily, sinking down into the only 
                         good chair in the room. 
                     
                     
                         "Don't let that bother you," said 
                         Atherton. "I know how you're fixed. 
                         You can't afford to be honest. Your 
                     
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         name is Dennis if you do. I'm right 
                         on to you. You haven't got money 
                         enough to do one thing nor the other. 
                         You can't either quit or hang on. 
                         Here's where you get your chance. 
                         That fellow Medway has got more 
                         money than a horse can haul downhill, 
                         and he's no baby. Anybody that can 
                         fool him will earn what he gets. You 
                         ought to have seen him at work out 
                         there in the Yellow Dog. There ain't 
                         a man on the Yukon that could have 
                         made a better examination of a claim. 
                         He's fair game, that fellow!" 
                     
                     
                         "If he's so sharp a man," said 
                         Ritchie, "why didn't he tumble to the 
                         fact that the claim was no good?" 
                     
                     
                         "That rock would fool anybody," re- 
                         sponded Atherton. "Tripp and I know 
                         there's nothing in it, but you won't, 
                         until you've run it through your mill. 
                         Now, quick; what do you say?" 
                     
                     
                         "I won't do it," said Ritchie; but he 
                         spoke without spirit. 
                     
                     
                         "Will you take the stuff in here, and 
                         keep it till I can have another talk with 
                         you to-morrow?" 
                     
                     
                         Before the chemist could answer, 
                         Tripp and Medway appeared at the 
                         door with the box. They put it on a 
                         table, and invited Ritchie to take a look 
                         at it. He complied like a man in a 
                         dream. This thing had fallen in so op- 
                         portunely that he was dazed by it. He 
                         had been declaiming his willingness to 
                         do anything that would get him out of 
                         Dawson City, and Satan had taken him 
                         at his word. Did fate mean to make a 
                         rascal of him? If so, judging by the 
                         record of his past performances, he 
                         would probably become one. Anything 
                         to oblige destiny, was his motto. 
                     
                     
                         The ore looked good. As Atherton 
                         had said, it would fool anybody. 
                         Ritchie found it hard to believe that the 
                         stuff was worthless, though he had once 
                         or twice seen equally promising rock 
                         with no tangible value. 
                     
                     
                         Tripp and Atherton were obviously 
                         anxious to get their victim away, and 
                     
                 
             
             
                 
                 Tales of the Chemists' Club 113 
                 
                     
                     
                         they succeeded before Ritchie could 
                         make up his mind upon a course of pro- 
                         cedure. When they were gone, the 
                         chemist sat by the table, trying to think. 
                         He made poor work of it, being deadly 
                         tired in the brain. He would fancy 
                         himself engaged in formulating a line 
                         of action, and would wake with a start 
                         to find his thought busy with a prob- 
                         lem of years gone by, a question of 
                         conduct long ago decided the wrong 
                         way. Again, he would picture himself 
                         denouncing Atherton, on the follow- 
                         ing day--speaking a speech to him full 
                         of high moral principles and absurdly 
                         unsuited to the person addressed. 
                     
                     
                         While his mind was thus running 
                         around like a squirrel in a revolving 
                         cage, accomplishing nothing at great ex- 
                         pense of energy, he was suddenly aware 
                         of Medway, who entered in haste. 
                     
                     
                         "I've got rid of those fellow's," said 
                         he, "and now I want a few minutes' 
                         quiet talk with you." 
                     
                     
                         "You can't talk too quietly to suit 
                         me," replied Ritchie; "I've got nervous 
                         prostration." 
                     
                     
                         Medway looked as if he thought the 
                         chemist expected him to laugh, and then 
                         he shifted to the serious side of the 
                         proposition. 
                     
                     
                         "You've been having a hard time," 
                         said he. "I know that; and it's the real 
                         cause of my being here. Atherton 
                         thinks it's your reputation for honesty, 
                         and that I trust you. No, sir; you're 
                         hard up, and you've made up your mind 
                         not to stand it any more." 
                     
                     
                         "Suppose I have," said Ritchie. 
                         "What then?" 
                     
                     
                         Medway leaned forward and tapped 
                         him on the knee. In the Briton's hand 
                         were some coins, which jingled as he 
                         tapped. 
                     
                     
                         "You'll give me a private report on 
                         that ore," said he. 
                     
                     
                         Ritchie had hardly expected the lamb 
                         [i]n this transaction to show so much 
                         worldly wisdom. 
                     
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         "Why, what's the game?" he asked 
                         stupidly. 
                     
                     
                         "They think the Yellow Dog is no 
                         good," said Medway, "and they intend 
                         to bribe you to make a favorable report 
                         to me. Take their money; take my 
                         money, and make three reports, one pri- 
                         vately to Atherton that the claim is no 
                         good; another privately to me, stating 
                         the facts, and a third to all of us, con- 
                         taining whatever they want you to put 
                         into it." 
                     
                     
                         "You can all go to blazes!" cried 
                         Ritchie. "I don't want anything to do 
                         with you." 
                     
                     
                         Medway laughed. 
                     
                     
                         "You'll feel better about this to-mor- 
                         row," he said. "Sleep on it. But, for 
                         the love of Heaven, get to work on 
                         that assay as soon as you can. I'm 
                         scared gray-headed for fear some one 
                         else will come along and make them an 
                         offer for that property. Ten thousand 
                         dollars would buy it, and, unless I've 
                         lost my eye, it's worth fifty times as 
                         much. My terms with you will be these: 
                         A full price for your work, anyway-- 
                         and you can get another one out of 
                         Atherton, so you're a winner, anyhow 
                         --and, if my game works, ten per cent 
                         of the difference between what I pay 
                         for the mine and its honest value." 
                     
                     
                         "Get out," said Ritchie. 
                     
                     
                         Medway laughed, and made a hur- 
                         ried exit, saying, as the door closed: 
                         "Think it over; think it over." 
                     
                     
                         Ritchie tried to think it over; but the 
                         harder he tried, the less he accom- 
                         plished. Experience had taught him 
                         that when he got into that condition he 
                         could find some small relief in work. 
                         So, having nothing else to do, he began 
                         to prepare some samples of Yellow Dog 
                         ore for assay. No sooner were his 
                         hands busy than his brain evolved a ra- 
                         tional idea. 
                     
                     
                         "I'll make an honest assay of this 
                         stuff," said he to himself, "and force 
                         those fellows to pay for it. I'll charge 
                         them enough to get me out of this for-

                         to refuse, for fear I'll blow the whole 
                         story." 
                     
                     
                         With this inspiration, he went to 
                         work in earnest, and was speedily con- 
                         scious of a betterment of spirits. Pres- 
                         ently he found himself thinking of 
                         Jennie Winsted, and in a pleasant vein. 
                         In utter hopelessness he was trying to 
                         earn enough money to take him forever 
                         out of the sight of her, and yet, as he 
                         worked, he indulged himself in day- 
                         dreams of success in the world and the 
                         winning of her favor. 
                     
                     
                         He ate with appetite at noon, and his 
                         pipe was more than ordinarily satis- 
                         factory when he set it alight in the 
                         laboratory after returning from dinner. 
                         He remembered to have felt this un- 
                         reasonable sense of cheer, many years 
                         ago, just previous to his one brief run 
                         of good luck. Was the sensation pro- 
                         phetic? This problem occupied a good 
                         share of his thought for an hour or 
                         more, and then a most unexpected oc- 
                         currence drove it out of his head. This 
                         was no less than the appearance of 
                         Mr. Winsted. 
                     
                     
                         Ritchie had never been thus honored 
                         before; and he was childishly pleased, 
                         the more that Mr. Winsted should have 
                         found him busy, and such a weight of 
                         ore upon his table. The coincidence 
                         was astonishing; indeed, it is probable 
                         that Winsted was surprised by what he 
                         saw, but he was far too well bred to 
                         say so. He greeted Ritchie most po- 
                         litely, and sat down on a cracker box 
                         with the grace of one who is at home 
                         in the drawing-rooms of the rich and 
                         great. 
                     
                     
                         "Very fair-looking rock," said he, in- 
                         dicating the ore. 
                     
                     
                         "It is, indeed," replied Ritchie. 
                     
                     
                         "Any objection to telling where it 
                         comes from?" 
                     
                     
                         "No objection to telling you," re- 
                         joined the chemist. "It is from a claim 
                         on Burnt Creek that they call the Yel- 
                         low Dog." 
                     
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         The statement seemed to make a con- 
                         siderable impression on Winsted. He 
                         rose from the cracker box and paced 
                         the width of the room twice or thrice. 
                     
                     
                         "Do you know a man named Syd 
                         Cullom?" said he suddenly. 
                     
                     
                         "Never heard of him," responded 
                         Ritchie, frankly meeting a searching 
                         glance from Winsted. "Why?" 
                     
                     
                         "He told me this morning that I'd 
                         better look into the Yellow Dog prop- 
                         erty," said Winsted. "I didn't know 
                         but he might have had the tip from you. 
                         That wasn't in my mind when I came 
                         here, however. I was only thinking 
                         that perhaps you could help me to get a 
                         line on the value of the claim." 
                     
                     
                         "I don't know anything about it my- 
                         self, yet," said Ritchie. "I'm going to 
                         make an assay for young Atherton and 
                         an Englishman named Medway--who 
                         may purchase." 
                     
                     
                         "One assay for both parties?" 
                     
                     
                         "Yes; it's an open business. No, it 
                         isn't, either. Why should I lie to you? 
                         It's a crooked game on both sides." 
                     
                     
                         And he told Winsted the whole story. 
                     
                     
                         When he had finished, the elderly 
                         gentleman went to the door, and softly 
                         opened it. There was no one in the 
                         hall, so he closed the door again, and 
                         walked up to Ritchie. 
                     
                     
                         "Give me an advance report on this 
                         stuff," said he, "and I'll make it worth 
                         your while." 
                     
                     
                         Ritchie whistled. 
                     
                     
                         "This is a pretty good day for bribery 
                         and corruption," said he. 
                     
                     
                         "Never you mind that, my son," re- 
                         sponded Winsted. "Remember which 
                         side your bread is buttered on, and let 
                         others attend to their own. Those fel- 
                         lows are trying to cheat each other; 
                         why shouldn't an honest man step in 
                         and get the property. Your English- 
                         man thinks ten thousand would buy it, 
                         if offered spot cash. I'll put up the 
                         money and give you a tenth interest." 
                     
                     
                         It is unnecessary to follow the con- 
                         versation in detail. The charitable

                         reader will remember Ritchie's unfortu- 
                         nate condition of mind and his still 
                         more distressing condition of heart, and 
                         will pity rather than censure him for 
                         agreeing to this nefarious proposition. 
                         When Winsted had gone, the young 
                         man sat for many minutes with his 
                         head in his hands, a prey to remorse. 
                         Then he sprang up, and began to rave. 
                         He swore that all was fair in love and 
                         gold mining; that the moral law was 
                         well known not to extend north of the 
                         fifty-fifth parallel of latitude, and that 
                         any man alive would do the same under 
                         similar conditions. 
                     
                     
                         Having relieved his mind in this way, 
                         he went to work with vigor. No leisure 
                         and short allowance of sleep was his 
                         rule from that time forth, during the 
                         course of these analyses. He was occa- 
                         sionally interrupted by one of his three 
                         tempters--four, indeed, counting Mr. 
                         Tripp--and he agreed to every propo- 
                         sition made to him; but he touched no- 
                         body's money. 
                     
                     
                         It was four o'clock on a certain 
                         morning when he finished his work, 
                         and made the last of his calculations. 
                         From the full report, he made a brief 
                         abstract, in which the results of his 
                         analyses were shown in three classifica- 
                         tions, as follows:

                         The Yellow Dog was a surprisingly 
                         good property, judging from this assay 
                         and from what Medway had said about 
                         the general characteristics of the lode. 
                         If Winsted could buy it for ten thou- 
                         sand dollars, he ought to be a good 
                         father-in-law to the man that had given 
                         him the opportunity. 
                     
                     
                         This thought in confused form was 
                         in Ritchie's brain, as he turned from 
                         his work in utter exhaustion. Throw- 
                         ing an old fur coat upon the floor, and 
                         drawing the first thing he could get his 
                     
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         hand on over him for a coverlet, he pre- 
                         pared to sleep upon the problem in- 
                         volved in his singular situation. 
                     
                     
                         When he awoke it was noonday, and 
                         the problem had solved itself, for there 
                         sat Winsted beside the table, digesting 
                         the result of Ritchie's labors. The 
                         young man had forgotten to lock his 
                         door before he slept. 
                     
                     
                         "Well, upon my word!" he ex- 
                         claimed. raising his stiffened and aching 
                         frame from the floor, and glaring at 
                         his visitor. 
                     
                     
                         Winsted nodded pleasantly, as he 
                         thrust the report into his pocket. 
                     
                     
                         "It's all right," he said; "I'm going 
                         to find Atherton. You'd better take an- 
                         other nap." 
                     
                     
                         He was gone before Ritchie could in- 
                         terpose any objection. As quickly as 
                         possible the chemist followed. Winsted 
                         was out of sight. In these circum- 
                         stances it seemed to be Ritchie's duty 
                         to hunt up Atherton and Medway, and 
                         make a report to them. 
                     
                     
                         He sought them all day, and for 
                         some hours of the evening, vainly. At 
                         last, in great weariness, he went to bed. 
                     
                     
                         On the following morning he decided 
                         that the best thing to do would be to 
                         wait in his laboratory. It should be 
                         a certainty that those he wished to see 
                         would come here during the day. 
                     
                     
                         At four o'clock in the afternoon they 
                         had not appeared. At five, there came 
                         a young Indian with a note. It was 
                         from Jennie Winsted, and it ran as fol- 
                         lows: 
                     
                     
                         Dear Mr. Ritchie: I know that you are 
                         perfectly innocent, but father is crazy. Ath- 
                         erton, Tripp, and Medway have decamped 
                         together. Of course, you know by this time 
                         that father bought the mine for fifteen thou- 
                         sand dollars cash. It was all a swindle. The 
                         ore that you analyzed never came from the 
                         Yellow Dog Mine. It was bought some- 
                         where else. Medway, of course, was in the 
                         plot. They got that fellow Cullom to give 
                         father the tip, and they knew he'd go to you, 
                         because we all like you so much, and you 
                         have been seen so often with father and me. 
                         It's dreadful; but don't you worry. I won't

                         let father do anything bad. A little bit of 
                         money won't hurt him. He is very rich, 
                         richer than you'd believe if I told you. So 
                         cheer up; I'll stand by you. Through thick 
                         and thin, I am, yours most truly, 
                         Jennie Winsted. 
                     
                     
                         For one instant Ritchie was stunned. 
                         An alternating current of bad and good 
                         news had shocked him to the marrow. 
                         Then he slowly came to a realization of 
                         what it all meant. 
                     
                     
                         "The old man's abuse of me has done 
                         the business!" he cried. "It has put 
                         Jennie on my side, and all is won. Now 
                         let me starve or freeze; I am content 
                         with any fate. Heaven bless Ather- 
                         ton and Tripp and Medway! May all 
                         their past sins be forgiven, and all their 
                         future ones be profitable! They have 
                         saved me and made a man of me. It 
                         is the turn of the tide." 
                     
                     
                         He danced around the table, to the 
                         great amazement of the youthful In- 
                         dian, whom, at last, he surprised even 
                         more by a large gratuity. 
                     
                     
                         Ritchie saw nothing of Winsted in 
                     
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         several days. He received, however, 
                         several notes from Jennie, describing 
                         the varying conditions of her father's 
                         feelings, and her own warfare upon 
                         Ritchie's side. Then, one fine day, Win- 
                         sted walked into the laboratory, smil- 
                         ing as sweetly as ever, and with ex- 
                         tended hand. 
                     
                     
                         "I've thought this thing out," he said, 
                         "and you're not to blame. I swindled 
                         myself; that's the fact about it. Jennie 
                         has shown me how the case really 
                         stands. She's a bright girl, and she 
                         likes you. She wants you to come up 
                         and take dinner with us to-day. And 
                         I like you, myself; be hanged if I don't. 
                         She's talked me into it. I think you 
                         and I can make some kind of partner- 
                         ship. I believe you're an honest man, 
                         and I need your advice. I--I want you 
                         to help me soak somebody else with 
                         that Yellow Dog claim." 
                     
                     
                         "As an honest man," said Ritchie, "I 
                         can't view that proposition with favor. 
                         But I will go to dinner."

                         NEW COUNTERFEITING SCHEME 
                     
                     
                         WEEKS of patient searching and watching by Captain Loughry, of the police 
                         bicycle squad, of Fort Worth, Texas, were rewarded when he placed under 
                         arrest a white man who is wanted by the Federal authorities in connection with 
                         the recent counterfeiting operations of two men at Abilene. The other man 
                         in the case was arrested about three weeks ago, and, according to Captain 
                         Loughry, is now serving sentence in one of the Federal prisons. Captain 
                         Loughry's prisoner was transferred to the Federal authorities for a hearing. 
                     
                     
                         Counterfeiters have alleged to have photographed United States bank notes, a 
                         photograph of each side of the bill being printed and pasted back to back. The 
                         prints were thinned down by wearing away the reverse side with sandpapers. 
                         Tinting was done in a crude way, and wonder is expressed by authorities at the 
                         ability of counterfeiters in passing their spurious money. 
                     
                     
                         Operations were carried on principally in the vicinity of Abilene and Baird, 
                         Federal authorities say. 
                     
                 
             
             
                 
                 
                 
                     Suggestion 
                 
                 
                     by  I.M. Hanbury  
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         BUT when he touched his wife's 
                         temple with the revolver, he saw 
                         the old love light come into her 
                         eyes. He knew that look was a 
                         farewell to the dead man behind him, 
                         but he could not fire. "Kitty, Kitty," 
                         he cried, in anguish, "I cannot kill 
                         you!" Then he raised the weapon to 
                         his own head ... a flash . . . 
                         and he fell. . . ." 
                     
                     
                         "Thank heavens, that's finished," 
                         Pasquale muttered. "Writing this 
                         kind of rot takes it out of a fellow. 
                         I've heard of actors becoming criminals 
                         because they've always played criminal 
                         parts, but when a man has had to feel 
                         the part of a husband, wife, and a lover, 
                         before he can write a convincing novel, 
                         he stands a fair chance of becoming a 
                         central figure in the annals of psychical 
                         criminology!" 
                     
                     
                         Pasquale, author and genius, dropped 
                         on his bed and, as sleep instantly 
                         claimed his exhausted brain and body, 
                         forgot that he had been trying to per- 
                         sonify a woman standing between a 
                         dead lover and an equally dead hus- 
                         band. 
                     
                     
                         The next morning he awoke, de- 
                         pressed and unrefreshed. "Nerves, 
                         overwork!" he growled, and dressed 
                         hurriedly, all the while fighting the 
                         feeling of impending disaster. But 
                         later, as he swung down the Strand, he 
                         laughed at his previous forebodings-- 
                         for the world was going well with 
                         Pasquale. 
                     
                     
                         His publisher had not yet arrived, 
                         and while waiting for him, Pasquale 
                     
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         took up the morning paper. "The same 
                         sordid story," he groaned, glancing at 
                         the headlines: 
                     
                     
                         CHELSEA SUICIDE AND MURDER. 
                         Lord Fairfield Shoots His Wife's Artist 
                         Lover, Then Himself. 
                         Lady Fairfield's Fatal Condition. 
                     
                     
                         Without interest, Pasquale read how, 
                         hearing the shots, men from a neigh- 
                         boring studio had rushed in, and found 
                         Lady Fairfield standing beside the two 
                         dead men. She seemed dazed, and 
                         nothing could be learned from her. Her 
                         mind was evidently unhinged by the 
                         shock. 
                     
                     
                         "The devil!" Pasquale cried, and, 
                         with sudden fear, searched for his 
                         manuscript. Yes, it was safe; every 
                         page properly numbered and in order. 
                         Was he mad, or had last night's work 
                         been too severe that he had his story 
                         always before his eyes? That was it, 
                         of course! He was tired, and had 
                         dropped to sleep in the office chair and 
                         dreamed. He laughed, and, cursing the 
                         state of his nerves, again took up the 
                         paper. On the front page he read: 
                     
                     
                         CHELSEA SUICIDE AND MURDER. 
                     
                     
                         Passing his hand over his eyes, he 
                         saw what this would mean to him. His 
                         long work was now useless. No one 
                         would take a story, good enough in it- 
                         self, but an exact copy of a sensational 
                         tragedy told in the morning papers. 
                     
                     
                         Laughing hysterically, he staggered 
                         down the stairs, and found his way 
                         home.

                         It was a cruel blow, and hit Pas- 
                         quale hard. For ten years be had writ- 
                         ten stories of life, stories of death, love, 
                         and adventure. Every character, inci- 
                         dent, and situation, was born in his own 
                         brain, and he heartily despised those 
                         who drew their copy from current 
                         events. Now, by strange coincidence, 
                         on the night when he had finished his 
                         latest book, his plot had been acted by 
                         live people, in some other part of the 
                         city. 
                     
                     
                         Worn out and disgusted, Pasquale 
                         left London indefinitely. But soon, 
                         publisher and public were clamoring 
                         for more of his work, so, once more, 
                         Bloomsbury saw him working at his 
                         table, putting all his mind into a tre- 
                         mendous burglary serial which, when 
                         finished, was to bring him a sum suffi- 
                         cient to drop out of the old life for a 
                         year or two. 
                     
                     
                         The principal feature of the serial 
                         was the inexperience of the burglar, 
                         and the safe's lock. Pasquale, all his 
                         old college books strewn about the floor, 
                         studied to work out a simple and orig- 
                         inal combination. 
                     
                     
                         For weeks he worried over the lock; 
                         the combination bothered him, until one 
                         day he accidentally picked up an article 
                         on suggestion and will power. Being 
                         a practical young man, the facts seemed 
                         hysterical, but being also an artist, the 
                         idea pleased him greatly. That night, 
                         while absently going over the diagram 
                         of the lock, his eyes followed the care- 
                         fully traced lines of the combination, 
                         and he saw with surprise that the letter 
                         which had always eluded him, was a 
                         "G," and having found it, the key to 
                         the opening of the safe was the word 
                         "suggestion." 
                     
                     
                         "Strange I didn't see that before," 
                         he mused. "I didn't even know there 
                         were two g's in suggestion. Now for 
                         the character. I've got him in my head, 
                         but I don't seem to get in touch with 
                         the unwashed devil." 
                     
                     
                         The story dragged, and, when com- 
                     
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         pleted, Pasquale reread it with dis- 
                         gust. 
                     
                     
                         "It's weak," he complained, "and 
                         here's two months already gone, and 
                         the whole thing has to be rewritten! 
                         It's that burglar. He isn't the right sort 
                         --he doesn't live." Lighting his pipe, 
                         Pasquale sank wearily into a chair. 
                     
                     
                         Twenty minutes passed ... an 
                         hour. . . . He reached mechan- 
                         ically for his pouch, and, still staring 
                         into the fire, refilled his pipe. Again 
                         silence; then his lips moved. . . . 
                         "I've got you at last, you inexperienced 
                         fool!" he muttered. 
                     
                     
                         The room was full of smoke. Pas- 
                         quale leaned forward in his chair, his 
                         face flushed with excitement. Then 
                         from his trembling lips the words fell 
                         in whispers: "No, not that way! Two 
                         g's. . . . S-U-G-G-E-S-T-I-O-N. 
                         . . . Yes! . . . Good heavens, 
                         can't you spell?' . . . There! 
                         You've got it! . . . Three hundred 
                         thousand pounds clear for you! Now 
                         git!" 
                     
                     
                         Pasquale fell back in his chair, ex- 
                         hausted and fainting. 
                     
                     
                         Suddenly he arose with a start. 
                         "Good heavens! Two o'clock! I must 
                         have been asleep. I'm dead tired and 
                         don't feel like work, but that serial 
                         must get off to-morrow, and it has to 
                         be completely rewritten!" 
                     
                     
                         Stretching himself, he crossed the 
                         room to his littered table, and listlessly 
                         prepared to write. 
                     
                     
                         After the first few words, his pen 
                         flew; the ideas tumbled from his brain 
                         so quickly that he could not keep pace 
                         with them. "Hurrah!" he cried joy- 
                         ously. "I've got it! It's like a dream, 
                         and clear, too. I must have caught that 
                         young burgling rascal when I was 
                         asleep just now." Laughing like a boy, 
                         Pasquale set to work in earnest. 
                     
                     
                         As the clock struck three, his door 
                         burst open, and Billy Sheldon, odd-job 
                         man on the Daily Scum, rushed in. 
                         "Come on, Pierre," he called. "Put up 
                     
                 
             
             
                 
                 Suggestion 119 
                 
                     
                     
                         that stuff and come with me. The 
                         Scion's got wind of a big thing, and I'm 
                         booked for the details. Burglary and 
                         combination-lock affair, with old Moor- 
                         kins, the millionaire, thrown in!" 
                     
                     
                         "Get out!" Pasquale growled, never 
                         lifting his eyes from his work. "I've 
                         a burglar and combination lock of my 
                         own on hand, and there's more money 
                         in it than in your real-life stuff! Get 
                         an easier job, Billy; bring your burglars 
                         to your rooms and make your own 
                         combination locks!" 
                     
                     
                         Sheldon laughed, and, seeing his 
                         friend had no intention of accompany- 
                         ing him, ran downstairs, and off to his 
                         "story." 
                     
                     
                         Five hours passed, and as a foggy 
                         sun peered through the window, a 
                         woman entered Pasquale's room with a 
                         tray. He looked up in surprise. 
                         "What's that, Mrs. Green? Lunch or 
                         dinner?" 
                     
                     
                         "Breakfast, sir," the good lady re- 
                         plied, sniffing the heavy, smoky air; 
                         "and you've been working all night 
                         again, sir! Look at your face!" 
                     
                     
                         Pasquale rose to his feet, but stag- 
                         gered back against the table. 
                     
                     
                         "There, there, Mrs. Green," he 
                         laughed. "Don't worry about me. It's 
                         my last all-night bust. To-day I get a 
                         fat editorial check and trot off to the 
                         green fields. I caught a perfectly in- 
                         nocent young man, and its been an all 
                         night's work to turn him into an intel- 
                         ligent burglar for the Fiddler!" 
                     
                     
                         Mrs. Green sniffed again, and set 
                         down the tray. "If bein' a genius, sir, 
                         means I'd have to talk crazylike, I'd 
                         rather keep my house, sir, and cook for 
                         folks what never eats," she ended wist- 
                         fully. Genuine concern on her moth- 
                         erly face, she went below. 
                     
                     
                         Pasquale smiled good-naturedly at 
                         the retreating figure, swallowed his 
                         tea, and, tucking his manuscript under 
                         his arm, started off for the office of the 
                         Fiddler. 
                     
                     
                         "Hello, Pasquale," the editor said 
                     
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         cordially. "We've had an awful scare 
                         about you. We're just going to press, 
                         and that story of yours has to appear 
                         in this issue; advertised it four months 
                         ago. What was the matter? You've 
                         never been so late before." 
                     
                     
                         "A lock, for one thing," Pasquale 
                         laughed, "and a burglar for another! 
                         It's taken me two months to get a com- 
                         bination, because I had forgotten how 
                         to spell. Then the man wasn't real, 
                         and the whole thing was silly. But last 
                         night I got the hang of it, and rewrote 
                         the entire first part, for which my land- 
                         lady is at present in tears!" 
                     
                     
                         The editor laughed, glanced over the 
                         manuscript, and wrote a check. 
                     
                     
                         "One thousand pounds," he groaned. 
                         "Heaven help you, Pasquale, if it isn't 
                         one of your best! This is the biggest 
                         check I've ever signed, and it depresses 
                         me! But if anything can pull up the 
                         Fiddler, it's a story from you. So long, 
                         old man. Get your money's worth out 
                         of that piece of paper!" 
                     
                     
                         In a little village in Cornwall, a man 
                         dug his potatoes, smiling the while. 
                     
                     
                         "Oh, the joy of it," he laughed, as 
                         he threw himself down on the warm 
                         earth to inspect his blistered hands. 
                         Just then, the rural postman shouted 
                         across the fields: "Mr. Pasquale, 
                         sir?" 
                     
                     
                         "Hang!" grumbled the farmer, as 
                         he crossed the potato patch. "I told 
                         Burns not to bother me with mail until 
                         I sent for it." He stuffed the letter un- 
                         opened into his pocket and resumed his 
                         digging. But the touch from the out- 
                         side world had jarred, and, putting up 
                         his tools, Pasquale went into the house. 
                     
                     
                         "Hang Burns," he repeated, as he 
                         opened the lawyer's letter: 
                     
                     
                         Dear Pierre: You had better come back 
                         at once. Your publisher is making the 
                         devil of a row, and has sent back your 
                         story, at the same time demanding his check 
                         for one thousand pounds. 
                     
                     
                         I do not wish to write much, so come up

                         immediately, for at any moment the Fiddler 
                         may turn the matter over to their lawyers. 
                         That Moorkins burglary is still bothering 
                         Scotland Yard, and if your story gets into 
                         their hands before they catch their man, 
                         we'll have to put up a big fight. 
                     
                     
                         I need not assure you, old man, that my 
                         mind is at rest, knowing there is some ex- 
                         planation which, at the time of writing, my 
                         matter-of-fact brain is incapable of conceiv- 
                         ing. Therefore directly you arrive, come to 
                         my office. Yours ever, Arthur Burns. 
                     
                     
                         "What's it all about," Pasquale 
                         mused. "Arthur writes as if he is try- 
                         ing to soothe a lunatic, or give courage 
                         to a criminal." Glancing at his watch, 
                         he left the bungalow, and sprinted 
                         along the country road to catch the 
                         London express. 
                     
                     
                         When Pasquale arrived at his law- 
                         yer's, Burns led him into his private 
                         office. "Glad to see you, old man," he 
                         said affectionately. "Have a cigar, and 
                         sit still while I tell you my story, and 
                         then you can talk. Fact is, I'm all on 
                         edge over this blamed thing, and feel 
                         as if I want to keep you from talking as 
                         long as possible." 
                     
                     
                         "Sort of 'every-word-you-say-shall- 
                         be-used-against you,' eh?" Pasquale 
                         laughed, as he settled into his chair. 
                         "Hurry along, Arthur. I want to get 
                         back to my potatoes!" 
                     
                     
                         Burns walked up and down the room, 
                         and finally blurted out in quick, nerv- 
                         ous sentences: 
                     
                     
                         "About four months ago you re- 
                         ceived a commission for a story from 
                         the Fiddler. On the morning of May 
                         21st, you took the manuscript to them. 
                         You were nervous and unstrung, and 
                         told the editor you had written the story 
                         only the night before--night of May 
                         20th. The editor gave you check for 
                         one thousand pounds. . . . You 
                         disappeared. Same time as first install- 
                         ment went to press--morning May 
                         21st, the Daily Scum came out with the 
                         Moorkins burglary case. The Scum 
                         was the only paper that had anything 
                         about it, as Moorkins had cautioned 
                         Scotland Yard to keep the thing quiet. 
                     
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         Since then, all the details have come 
                         out, and--and--hang it all, man, the 
                         only difference between your story and 
                         that robbery is that you wrote the one, 
                         and the other is dry police fact! 
                     
                     
                         "The Fiddler sent for me at once, 
                         gave me back your manuscript, and in- 
                         tend to sue, if you don't make good 
                         their check for one thousand pounds. 
                         They believe you got the whole thing 
                         from the Scum, and played a low-down 
                         trick by sending it in as original stuff. 
                         Good! But their lawyers will want to 
                         know how you got the details; how you 
                         learned the combination of the lock 
                         Moorkins invented and manufactured 
                         himself! Remember, all these details 
                         did not come out until nearly a week 
                         after your manuscript went to press. 
                     
                     
                         "Now, man, it's serious, and if you 
                         can't make it clear, you'll probably be 
                         under suspicion as the man for whom 
                         the police are at present scouring Lon- 
                         don! That's all--and, for Heaven's 
                         sake, say something!" 
                     
                     
                         Like a man who had received his 
                         death sentence, Pasquale raised a white 
                         face and looked at his friend. "Just 
                         my luck, Arthur. There's my little 
                         potato patch and the bungalow with 
                         the yellow roses all wiped out!" 
                     
                     
                         Burns looked at his friend with con- 
                         sternation. "Man alive, stop this talk 
                         about potatoes and yellow roses! Can't 
                         you understand? It's this: Did you 
                         rob Moorkins' safe and get off with 
                         three hundred thousand pounds, or did 
                         you, like a beastly cad, sneak the whole 
                         story from some reporter and pass it 
                         off as firsthand stuff? 
                     
                     
                         "The first I won't believe. The 
                         other . . . why, it's your utter 
                         ruin, and the ruin of whoever gave you 
                         inside information! In that case you'll 
                         be lucky to get off with heavy damages, 
                         but you'll never be able to soothe the 
                         feelings of the public after playing the 
                         fool like this! Ruin, man . . . 
                         utter ruin!" 
                     
                     
                         Pasquale stood up wearily and 
                     
                 
             
             
                 
                 Suggestion 121 
                 
                     
                     
                         walked to the door. "It's no good, Ar- 
                         thur. You're wrong in both conclu- 
                         sions. I wrote the story out of my 
                         head, and that's all there is about it!" 
                     
                     
                         Burns started as if his friend had 
                         struck him. "Prove it! Prove it, man, 
                         by showing where you were that night! 
                         Tell me everything!" 
                     
                     
                         "Nothing to tell." Pasquale sighed. 
                         "I was in my rotten dig's in Blpoms- 
                         bury, and wrote the whole thing dur- 
                         ing the night. Then my landlady 
                         brought up some grub, and I went to 
                         the Fiddler and got a check." 
                     
                     
                         "But didn't any one see you at work? 
                         Didn't anything happen to prove you 
                         were there before the landlady came in 
                         the morning?" Burns asked excitedly. 
                     
                     
                         "No--yes . . ." Pasquale an- 
                         swered wearily. "Billy Sheldon came 
                         up, I think. Still, I'm not sure, for my 
                         head was full of the story then. I re- 
                         member it was the very deuce to make 
                         it run smoothly." 
                     
                     
                         But Burns had rushed to the tele- 
                         phone. "Daily Scum?" he shouted. 
                         "Send Mr. Sheldon to No. 23 Frog- 
                         morton Street, at once--Arthur Burns 
                         --third floor!" Then, as he hung up 
                         the receiver, he began to pace the room 
                         again. 
                     
                     
                         "Sit down, Pierre!" he ordered. The 
                         two men sat in silence until Billy Shel- 
                         don hurried in, copy lust lighting up 
                         his handsome, young face. Pasquale 
                         glanced impatiently at his eager friend. 
                         "For Heaven's sake, Billy, look less like 
                         a newspaper man, and stop grinning," 
                         he growled. "Then, when you've 
                         found out what Burns thinks he's been 
                         explaining, come and tell me what the 
                         row's about. I'm going to your rooms." 
                     
                     
                         When Pasquale had gone, Burns 
                         turned to the reporter. "Mr. Shel- 
                         don," he said, "I hope you have noth- 
                         ing of importance on hand for an hour 
                         or so, and that I may speak to you 
                         now as a friend of Pierre Pasquale, 
                         and not as a newspaper man?" 
                     
                     
                         Seeing the old man's worn look, Shel- 
                     
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         don answered seriously: "Wherever 
                         Pierre is concerned, Mr. Burns, my 
                         chief fault is sincerity and affection, 
                         for there never was found in the make- 
                         up of one man a greater genius and a 
                         greater child." 
                     
                     
                         Burns took the young man's extended 
                         hand, and characteristically went to the 
                         root of the matter at once. 
                     
                     
                         "It is this, Mr. Sheldon: Our friend 
                         may be dragged into the courts and con- 
                         victed for the Moorkins robbery on the 
                         sole evidence of an unfortunate story. 
                         He tells me you came to him on the 
                         night of the robbery. Is that so?" 
                     
                     
                         "Yes," Sheldon answered immedi- 
                         ately, "and he was head over heels in 
                         work when I went up at two o'clock in 
                         the morning." Then, under the law- 
                         yer's questioning, Sheldon set himself 
                         to remember every detail of the con- 
                         versation on that night. 
                     
                     
                         "And you did not return later with 
                         any further details you had learned?" 
                         Burns finally asked. 
                     
                     
                         "No. Nor did I see him again until 
                         half an hour ago in this office. More- 
                         over, I could have told him nothing 
                         further, for we didn't know the details 
                         ourselves until three or four days later, 
                         when all the stuff about the lock being 
                         Moorkins' invention came out." 
                     
                     
                         "Well, Sheldon, I'm floored," Burns 
                         muttered. "Here, read this. It's the 
                         story. You'll then understand how 
                         serious this is." 
                     
                     
                         Sheldon took the manuscript, and 
                         for an hour read in silence. 
                     
                     
                         "It's great!" he cried, when he had 
                         finished. "But all the facts are stale 
                         now. What do you make out of it, Mr. 
                         Burns?" 
                     
                     
                         "Nothing, or everything; I don't 
                         know! Go back to Pierre and make 
                         him talk. It will take both of us to sift 
                         this, especially as at present his mind 
                         runs on nothing but potatoes!" 
                     
                     
                         When Sheldon reached home, he 
                         found Pasquale working over a sheet

                         count of the profit to be made after 
                         three years, from an investment of five 
                         hundred pounds in potatoes! 
                     
                     
                         "Let 'em wait, Pierre," he said awk- 
                         wardly, "and talk to me. Burns is not 
                         himself with worry about you, and you 
                         can put everything straight in a minute 
                         by saying how you got the facts for 
                         your story." 
                     
                     
                         Pasquale looked like a hurt child 
                         wrongfully accused, but, touched by 
                         the expression on his friend's face, an- 
                         swered slowly: ''Out of my head, same 
                         as I told Arthur." 
                     
                     
                         "But the combination lock Moorkins 
                         invented, and put together himself?" 
                     
                     
                         "Out of my head, and a devil of a 
                         lot of bother it gave me, six months 
                         ago!" 
                     
                     
                         "Six months ago!" Sheldon ex- 
                         claimed. "That was when Moorkins 
                         was inventing his lock!" 
                     
                     
                         "Can't help that." Pasquale was be- 
                         coming irritable. "If you want to know 
                         anything else, get my old trunk out of 
                         the warehouse, and you'll probably find 
                         the diagrams somewhere, with the story 
                         as I first wrote it, before the whole 
                         thing came like a dream. I'm fond of 
                         you, Billy, but you and Burns are get- 
                         ting tiresome. Fish out that trunk, and 
                         leave me alone." 
                     
                     
                         More to gain time, than with any 
                         hope of solving the riddle, Sheldon hur- 
                         ried off to the warehouse, Pasquale's 
                         authority to get the trunk, in his pocket. 
                         A little later he was back, rummaging 
                         the trunk for the first proofs of the 
                         burglar story. 
                     
                     
                         At the bottom, he came across a roll 
                         of manuscript and drew it out. "What's 
                         this, Pierre?" he called, glancing over 
                         the papers. "Never seen it in print. 
                         Turned down?" 
                     
                     
                         Pasquale looked up from his figures 
                         for a moment. "Oh, that. No . . . 
                         never in print. Rotten piece of luck, 
                         that; made me so disgusted, I nearly 
                         chucked writing. Read it--it's good- 
                         enough stuff." 
                     
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         Sheldon opened the packet, and be- 
                         gan to read. Suddenly he cried: "It's 
                         fine, Pierre, but it's the story of the 
                         Fairfields and poor old Ceril Thornby, 
                         the artist." 
                     
                     
                         "It is," Pasquale laughed. "That's 
                         just what I said, too, when I sat in the 
                         publisher's office with my manuscript 
                         under my arm, and read the whole thing 
                         in the morning paper!" 
                     
                     
                         "You're not trying to tell me--" 
                     
                     
                         "I'm not trying to tell you anything, 
                         except that that story gave me the blow 
                         of my life. I thought it rather good, 
                         for me; then some live fools acted the 
                         whole thing before I had time to get my 
                         stuff into print--and, as put down in 
                         journalistic eloquence, it was a rotten 
                         story, too! That's what I am trying to 
                         tell you, though not for a moment 
                         thinking I can explain it to you." 
                     
                     
                         Sheldon sat like a frightened child 
                         and stared at his friend. 
                     
                     
                         "Don't tell me it's suggestion, Pierre, 
                         for although I once wrote an article on 
                         that for the Scum, it's rot, and I don't 
                         believe in it." 
                     
                     
                         "Suggestion!" Pasquale shouted. 
                         "Then you're responsible for my lock 
                         combination, you villain! That article 
                         of yours stuck in my head, and finally 
                         I found that the combination I was 
                         working out opened my once-thought- 
                         unique safe by that one word; spelled 
                         differently from the way it ought to be, 
                         however." 
                     
                     
                         Sheldon still stared open-mouthed at 
                         his friend; then, without a word, col- 
                         lected the scattered manuscript, and 
                         rushed from the house to Burns. 
                     
                     
                         "Here, read this, Burns!" he cried. 
                         "He wrote it before the Fairfields case 
                         came out in the papers!" Unable to 
                         grasp what Sheldon meant, Burns took 
                         the manuscript and read. 
                     
                     
                         "Aye, it's uncanny, man," he said at 
                         last, relapsing into his native tongue. 
                         "The lad is clean daft, or under some 
                         evil control. I dinna like the sound of 
                         yon article--it reads like he kens too

                         weel the feelings of these itlier folk. 
                         It's as if he went into them and listened 
                         to the things they say and do, a' the 
                         time keeping the power to write it doon. 
                         It smacks of forcing the puir souls to 
                         do what he writes doon for siller! It's 
                         like--it's like-" 
                     
                     
                         "Suggestion," Sheldon whispered to 
                         himself. 
                     
                     
                         "Aye, man, what's that ye say? Sug- 
                         gestion? That's the word, laddie! It's 
                         as if they have to, because he is think- 
                         ing of it! I dinna like it." 
                     
                     
                         "But it proves Pierre didn't--" 
                         Sheldon began, and hesitated. "Aye, it 
                         shows the laddie never did bother 
                         Moorkins, money or no! It's nae mair 
                         than some evil influence the lad is un- 
                         der. I'll telephone the Fiddler, and see 
                         what we can do." 
                     
                     
                         As they waited for the representative 
                         from Pasquale's publisher, the two men 
                         talked. "But Pierre has spent more 
                         than half the thousand pounds al- 
                         ready," Sheldon objected to the law- 
                         yer's suggestion that they refund the 
                         money with the explanation that, being 
                         pressed for time, Pasquale had taken 
                         the entire story from the newspapers, 
                         hoping it would pass unnoticed. "For," 
                         Burns explained, "so long as it has not 
                         gone to their lawyers, there is no 
                         danger of the editor wondering where 
                         the details came from. He doesn't 
                         know whether they were known before 
                         the newspapers printed them later, and 
                         in the meantime Scotland Yard will 
                         probably catch their man." 
                     
                     
                         Burns was interrupted as the clerk 
                         ushered in the Fiddler's representative. 
                     
                     
                         "Be seated, sir," Burns began sternly, 
                         the light of battle in his eye. "I have 
                         sent for you to tell you how much I 
                         regret the inconvenience to which your 
                         firm has been put, and to offer you, in 
                         the name of my client, Mr. Pasquale, 
                         the sum of one thousand pounds as 
                         compensation for your loss of time, and 
                         money spent in advertising and print- 
                         ing his unfortunate story. I also re- 
                     
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         fund you the one thousand pounds paid 
                         to him by your firm. The only ex- 
                         planation my client wishes to offer is 
                         that he was pressed for time and money, 
                         and as it is perfectly legitimate to make 
                         use of any current topic, he used the 
                         Moorkins robbery as the theme of his 
                         story. However, if by any further 
                         work he can further compensate you, 
                         I have no doubt he will gladly do so." 
                     
                     
                         Burns paused, and Sheldon, wander- 
                         ing where the lawyer intended getting 
                         two thousand pounds, looked on 
                         aghast. 
                     
                     
                         "Compensation!" the representative 
                         cried, in disgust. "We will accept the 
                         check, but as for any further commis- 
                         sions from us or any other self-respect- 
                         ing paper, you may tell Mr. Pasquale 
                         from me, his account is closed. This 
                         is his ruin; not one of us would touch 
                         the greatest work in the world, if writ- 
                         ten by him!" 
                     
                     
                         Burns, grown suddenly gray and 
                         weak, sat down heavily and wrote a 
                         check for two thousand pounds. The 
                         Fiddler's representative looked at it. 
                         "This is your personal check, sir?" he 
                         asked. 
                     
                     
                         "Yes," Burns replied simply. "Mr. 
                         Pasquale deposited that amount to my 
                         account when he realized he had made a 
                         mistake in this--his only unworthy 
                         act." 
                     
                     
                         Then, as the man left the office, 
                         Burns dropped his head on his arms, 
                         like an old man who has looked on the 
                         destruction of his life's dream. 
                     
                     
                         Sheldon stared at the bowed head 
                         for a moment, anger and emotion fight- 
                         ing in his heart. Then, he, too, wrote a 
                         check and laid it beside the old man. 
                     
                     
                         "You can't do it alone, Burns," he 
                         said kindly. "Pierre is my friend, too." 
                         At the unasked question in the lawyer's 
                         eyes, he added quickly: "Oh! I've a 
                         couple of hundred left, and nothing to 
                         do with 'em." Then, seeing the other 
                         still doubted, he turned on his heel and 
                         left the office.

                         Pasquale was still at work. Sheldon 
                         touched his shoulder and said quietly: 
                         "Go back to the country, Pierre, and-- 
                         give up writing, old man. Your pub- 
                         lishers are liberal in their denunciation 
                         of you and your stuff!" 
                     
                     
                         "Good!" Pasquale exclaimed, re- 
                         gaining his good humor at the thought 
                         of an immediate return to his potatoes. 
                         "I never intend to write another word 
                         in my life. Good-by, Billy, and thanks 
                         awfully for whatever you and Arthur 
                         have done, though, for the life of me, 
                         I still don't understand what the row's 
                         been about! Both of you come down 
                         some time, and I'll show you a potato 
                         patch that will make your hearts young 
                         again!" 
                     
                     
                         During the five years Pasquale had 
                         planted potatoes, his ardor had never 
                         for a moment diminished. True, for 
                         the last year he had been constantly 
                         drawing on the bank, but, to him, that 
                         seemed the sole excuse for its ex- 
                         istence, so when he received word that 
                         his account was overdrawn, he felt as 
                         a petulant child might, when tem- 
                         porarily deprived of jam. 
                     
                     
                         Nor did he realize the seriousness of 
                         his position, until the plow needed a 
                         new share, and he had not the where- 
                         withal to purchase it. Then it was 
                         only anger he felt--anger against the 
                         bank, the series of bad summers, and 
                         the world in general. "There is noth- 
                         ing for it, but to write again," he told 
                         himself dejectedly. Calling his farm 
                         hand, he told him the facts. 
                     
                     
                         "I've no more money, John, and we 
                         need a new plow, and lots of other 
                         things. It seems I can't buy them, so 
                         I'll have to pay you off, and get along 
                         alone, as best I can, until I get fresh 
                         funds." 
                     
                     
                         John, who was devoted to Pasquale, 
                         would not hear of his plans. "I shall 
                         work on as before, sir," he said. "Me 
                         and the missus have saved up a tidy 
                         sum from the overpay you always give 
                     
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         me, and--and--well, sir, I never earned 
                         that money, and please, sir, wouldn't 
                         you use it, sir, until you get the other 
                         money, sir!" 
                     
                     
                         John's honest face was red and em- 
                         barrassed, and Pasquale slapped him 
                         on the back in friendly fashion. "No, 
                         John, I'll have a check in two or three 
                         weeks; but if you won't go, I suppose 
                         you'll work on, that's all! It won't be 
                         long before I can square tip, anyway." 
                     
                     
                         That night, Pasquale wrote to his 
                         friend, Billy Sheldon: 
                     
                     
                         Come and see fair play, Billy. I won't use 
                         my own name, and I'll spin out a yarn about 
                         myself this time, so you and Arthur can 
                         put your old minds at rest about the "tender 
                         feelings of the public!'' 
                     
                     
                         Then he shut himself up in his den 
                         to work. 
                     
                     
                         "Fine subject I am, for a penny 
                         shocker," he mused. "I'm afraid I'll 
                         have to be satisfied with the hero's part, 
                         and John can be the villain!" He 
                         chuckled to himself af the idea, and 
                         wrote rapidly all through the night. 
                     
                     
                         The next morning John brought in 
                         breakfast as usual. 
                     
                     
                         Pasquale eyed him with amusement. 
                         "Not so polite, my villain," he laughed 
                         to himself, as the adoring John left 
                         him after a puzzled stare at the pile of 
                         manuscript strewn about the table. 
                         "You don't strike me as a murderous 
                         ruffian, and you're no inspiration at all 
                         when you look at me like a worried old 
                         hen!" 
                     
                     
                         That afternoon Sheldon arrived. 
                     
                     
                         "See that?" Pasquale laughed, as 
                         John served the dinner. "That speci- 
                         men of British honesty is my villain; 
                         he has to make away with me, the Eng- 
                         lish baron!" 
                     
                     
                         Sheldon glanced over the manuscript 
                         and found it to be one of Pasquale's 
                         best, but later, when John confided to 
                         him his fears that his young master was 
                         overworking, and related harrowing 
                         tales of untouched breakfasts--he se- 
                         cretly marveled at Pasquale's san- 
                     
                 
             
             
                 
                 Suggestion 125 
                 
                     
                     
                         guine genius, if he intended to get copy 
                         from his devoted servant! 
                     
                     
                         Sheldon retired early, tired with the 
                         unaccustomed outdoor life, and Pas- 
                         quale worked in his silent den. 
                     
                     
                         A few nights later, Sheldon was 
                         awakened by the sound of a window 
                         shutting. Thinking it was Pasquale 
                         going to his room after a long night's 
                         work, he called out: "That you, 
                         Pierre?" 
                     
                     
                         There was no answer, so he got up 
                         and followed the direction he imagined 
                         the footsteps had taken. Before he 
                         had gone far, a cry rang through the 
                         house. It came from Pasquale's den, 
                         and as he dashed downstairs, Sheldon 
                         collided violently with some one run- 
                         ning up. 
                     
                     
                         "Hello, Pierre," he gasped. "You all 
                         right? Where's the row?" Then he 
                         saw the man was John. "Oh, sir--Mr. 
                         Pasquale--in the study--quick--he's 
                         dying--I killed him--quick--for the 
                         love of Heaven!" 
                     
                     
                         Sheldon ran to the study, and for a 
                         moment was relieved, for there, at his 
                         desk, his back to the door, sat Pas- 
                         quale. But as Sheldon crossed the 
                         room, the figure slid from the chair, 
                         and fell in a heap on the floor. 
                     
                     
                         Instantly Sheldon was beside his 
                         friend, and saw that Pasquale, who had 
                         been stabbed from behind, was rapidly 
                         dying. As Sheldon bent over him, he 
                         struggled to speak, and at last whis- 
                         pered faintly: 
                     
                     
                         "Billy--he--couldn't help it- It 
                         must--have been--like--the other 
                         stories. Promise--to clear--him-" 
                     
                     
                         Then, as the blood gushed from his 
                         mouth, Pasquale sank back and died. 
                     
                     
                         Bewildered, and half fainting, Shel- 
                         don still sat beside his friend's body, 
                         when the door opened, and John stum- 
                         bled in. He threw himself upon the 
                         dead man, moaning and muttering in- 
                         coherently, until Sheldon forced him 
                         aside roughly. 
                     
                     
                         "What are you doing here at this 
                     
                 
                 
                     
                     
                         hour of the night?" he asked harshly. 
                         John began to moan again, and with 
                         difficulty Sheldon caught the drift of his 
                         mutterings: "I found myself dressed 
                         --and with a knife. ... I don't 
                         know how I got out of my house--I ran 
                         along the road--I climbed into the 
                         window--I don't know why. . . . 
                         I only know I suddenly awoke with the 
                         handle of a knife in my hand. . . . 
                         Oh, heavens! The blade was in my 
                         master's back! I must have done it--I 
                         --I must have killed him. . . ." 
                         Then, before Sheldon could stop him, 
                         the distracted man had plunged the 
                         knife into his own breast. 
                     
                     
                         Morning found the local police in 
                         possession of the little cottage with the 
                         yellow roses and the potato patch, but 
                         although the den gave evidence of re- 
                         cent use and work, they could find noth- 
                         ing to show what Pasquale had been 
                         doing on that fatal night. So, baffled, 
                         they called it "murder and suicide-- 
                         motives unknown." 
                     
                     
                         But Sheldon and his friend Burns 
                         were in possession of Pasquale's last 
                         manuscript, and in the lawyer's town 
                         office they read it and, together deci- 
                         phered the last bloodstained page. 
                     
                     
                         "Aye, the laddie created his ain mur- 
                         derer," the Scotsman said sadly, "and 
                         oot of a perfectly innocent and affec- 
                         tionate man, too. Did I no say 'twas a 
                         power from the Evil One? See his last 
                         words: 'Stealthy footsteps stole down 
                         the hall, and, creeping behind his mas- 
                         ter, John raised his arm, and the 
                         knife-- The puir laddie never 
                         wrote that last word 'buried' or 'sank,' 
                         or whatever was in his mind, for John 
                         struck then, helplessly doing his mas- 
                         ter's bidding, and it was only when the 
                         influence of that strong mind was 
                         broken, the puir creature came to him- 
                         sel' and saw what he had done! Ah! 
                         My puir, puir laddie. . . ." 
                     
                     
                         After a few moments, Sheldon said 
                         softly: "Burns, I feel it my duty to

                         fully, "you nor I can do naught. Are

                         "Darn the feelings of the public!" 
                         Sheldon exclaimed, as he mixed him-

                         PASSING OF NEW YORK'S CHINATOWN 
                     
                     
                         TIME was when poker threatened the supremacy of fan-tan in New York's 
                         Chinatown. The elusive full house was taken to the Chinese bosom, and 
                         players sat up far into the night in pursuit of the higher learning which tells a 
                         student of Hoyle when to toss away one of his two pairs for the sake of improving 
                         his chances in the draw. But that time is past. In this day poker and the Chi- 
                         nese of Pell Street scarcely speak as they pass.  
                     
                     
                         Because poker, with its chance for the individual player as against games in 
                         which the dealer holds all the advantage, appeals to the Chinese gambling sense, it 
                         thrived in Chinatown. The American deck was easier to handle, too--and per- 
                         haps to slip into a capacious sleeve--than the narrow cards of the Orient. 
                     
                     
                         But its vogue was of brief duration, for American detectives, who knew even 
                         more about the game than the crafty Chinese, swooped down upon it, confiscated 
                         the cards and chips, and arrested the players. Fan-tan came back into its own 
                         because, to quote one of the detectives who helped put poker out of business: 
                         "You can't tell by lookin' at a bunch of chinks playin' th' blasted game whether 
                         they're gambling or takin' up a collection for the Belgians." 
                     
                     
                         When detectives battered down half a dozen "ice-box" doors, broke their 
                         heads in low-ceiled passageways, and barked their shins on chairs thrown in 
                         their path by fleeing "lookouts," they often got to gambling rooms to find from 
                         half a dozen to fifty blind Chinamen sitting about tables and fingering buttons 
                         and dominoes. There was no money in sight. 
                     
                     
                         Sometimes they went over roofs, clambered down fire escapes, dropped into 
                         courtyards, shinned a wall, and let themselves in through a window. By the 
                         time they had pried loose the iron bars covering the glass, kicked out the window 
                         frame, and tumbled into the room, there was one suspected gambler left, and 
                         he was asleep, his head pillowed on a gambling table. 
                     
                     
                         To-day there is no gambling in Chinatown. That is a statement worth em- 
                         phasizing. The activity of the police department is responsible. 
                     
                     
                         Consequent of this, Chinatown is threatened with extinction. In another 
                         year, those who know say, there will be hundreds in the district where once there 
                         were thousands. The Chinese theater is gone. Stores are closed. 
                     
                     
                         Chinatown is near effacement because of the closing down of gambling. 
                         The Chinese is the world's natural gambler. He will wager on the number of 
                         seeds in an orange, on the number of grains in an ear of corn--on anything, in 
                         fact, that affords the chance. Unless he can gamble he does not stay in his home. 
                         Absolutely without home ties, and willing even to sacrifice his business, of what- 
                         ever it may consist, for a chance to be where he may bet something 011 something, 
                         he packs up and gets out when gambling is denied him.

                         IT was the worst snowstorm of the year. Two o'clock in the morning. The 
                         wind struck hard at the two figures toiling through the drifts. One was 
                         taller than the other, a man, by his manner and action, held the shorter, 
                         possibly a woman, close and vehemently, with a determination that evidently 
                         combated the other's desire to escape. 
                     
                     
                         Now almost carrying his companion, the taller of the two slid and lurched 
                         down the incline at One Hundred and Thirty-fourth Street, to the Hudson 
                         River. The gale had cleared just a bit just here, and the plank and shoring 
                         showed bare, where, nosed to it, lay an interned ship.  
                     
                     
                         The burden bearer halted for a moment as he reached the interned boat, 
                         then stepped on the narrow plank; and, coursing like a hunted stag up the deck, he 
                         and his burden sank into the inscrutableness of the darkness that is a super- 
                         darkness, and heralds the birth of all our To-days.

                         the October 20th number, see if your solution is correct. Here is the puzzle. 
                         Go to it! 
                     
                     
                         Following the arrest and conviction of Slim Pete, who committed one of 
                         the most daring burglaries in the history of crime, the police of one of our largest 
                         cities spent considerable time, and went to great pains, before the loot was 
                         recovered. The only clews they had to work on were a note containing a pur- 
                         poseless lot of words, and the whispered word, "Hoakersville," which passed 
                         from the lips of Pete to a pal as he tried to hand Pete the slip of paper, just as 
                         two detectives were leading the dejected prisoner into the station house. 
                     
                     
                         The quick ear of one of the detectives caught the word. The note was taken 
                         to the handwriting expert at police headquarters, and, when he had spent con- 
                         siderable time with it, he discovered that it contained a sentence telling the 
                         location of the spot in Hoakersville where the loot was buried. A search was 
                         made and the stolen property was recovered. 
                     
                     
                         In writing the words, the burglar jumbled them in an unintelligible string, 
                         and intended that his pal should work over them until he had them rearranged 
                         in a sentence containing correct English. In order to make it a little easier, he 
                         built a skeleton of this sentence as it should be, by placing the first word, and 
                         each sixth word after it, in its proper place, and made it necessary to rearrange 
                         only the other words in his note. This, the handwriting expert tells us, is what 
                         he meant by the memorandum in the upper left-hand corner. What can you 
                         do with it?
