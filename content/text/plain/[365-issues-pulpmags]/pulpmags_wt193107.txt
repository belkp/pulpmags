WITH this issue Weird Tales returns to a monthly basis. This number goes
on the news stands June 1st; the August issue will be on sale July 1st. The mag-
azine will be issued regularly every month thereafter. Our announcement in last
issue that the magazine would again be published every thirty days has called forth a
chorus of congratulations from you, the readers, and we find that Weird Tales is
the favorite magazine of many thousands.

    A letter from Ted Fox, of New Haven, Connecticut, says: "I was overjoyed to
learn that you have decided to return to monthly publication. I very definitely had
missed the thrills and quakings engendered by reading your periodical. I had a
sneaking suspicion that your cutting down the number of issues was actuated by your
being unable to find sufficient material of your high literary standard. But the
April-May number has convinced me that this is not the case. The Dead-Alive is
as artistic, as eery a yarn of the occult as has ever entertained me with cold shivers for
a delicious half-hour. Especially well done was the scene between the hero and the
body of his father. That left me with a cold sweat. The Dust of Death, your fea-
tured story, rather disappointed; not that it was not a good yarn, but that one expeas
the superlative of the featured narrative in Weird Tales. Are we to have no more
of Seabury Quinn? There is something missing in a W. T. without Jules de Gran-
din’s Gallic exuberance.” [Certainly, there will be many more stories of Jules de
Grandin in future issues.—The Editors.]

    From Mexico City, Alice I’Anson writes: "As was to be expected, my favorite
story in the April-May issue is A Rendezvous in Averoigne. It is a gem of fantasy,
beautifully worded, dreamily weird, soul-thrilling and satisfying. I hope there are
many others to follow like this and The End of the Story.”

    Writes B. A. Balkin, of Los Angeles: "I have just laid down your recent issue,
and had to rush to my typewriter to tell you that The Dead-Alive by Messrs.
Schachner and Zagat is positively the masterpiece of all weird, creepy stories. It goes
immediately to the top of anything you have ever printed. I assure you I won’t be
able to sleep tonight after that thriller; I’ll be seeing ghastly faces at my window.
Like Oliver Twist, I want more.”

    "The May issue was great,” writes Jack Darrow; "not so many stories, but they
,were long ones and I like long stories. Sticking its neck above the rest is The Dust

ACCLAIMED BY CRITICS THROUGHOUT THE WORLD

New York Times: "Fanciful, touched by the super-
natural, exotic in thought and coloring. Flowers, poems,
music and jade are interwoven with their themes and
the effect is often both quaint and charming.”

The China Weekly Review, Shanghai, China: "Reveals
a true sense of gentleness, the heart of a dreamer, a
deep sense of rhythm and beauty. He sees China and
the Chinese through misty, naive, sometimes philo-
sophic eyes.”

Honolulu Star-Bulletin, Honolulu, Hawaii: "They are
strange and glowing tales of an unearthly beauty. Their
scenes are laid in China but they might be anywhere.

They are essentially a part of the history of those lost
lands where Dunsany’s heroes live and die magnificently
and where Walter de la Mare’s dark travelers knock
vainly at mysterious moonlit doors.”

Ohio State Journal, Columbus, Ohio: "There is some
weirdness here, some mystery and some tender passages,
enough of each to make a superlative ensemble that
won for this author a secure place in the field of Far
East fiction.”

SPECIAL AUTOGRAPHED FIRST EDITIONS

Here are some real gems of literature. Poetic and fanci-
ful Chinese stories with a real thrill to them. These are
stories that deserve to live forever. Their ethereal sweet-
ness will grip you. Both books are special first editions
autographed by the author. These books are very artis-
tically bound and would make an excellent gift to a
friend or a valuable addition to your own library.

Remember, first edition copies grow more valuable with
the years and when autographed become doubly valu-

Daily Argus Leader, Sioux Palls, S. D.: "This is a
collection to be read, laid down and read again.”
Wilmington Every Evening, Wilmington, Del.: "De-
serves a place among one’s favorite books.”

Radio Station KDKA, Pittsburgh: "For those who are
interested in Chinese literature and traditions, we
believe this book will find a cordial welcome. A very
beautiful book.”

The Globe, Toronto, Ont.: "Dealing with curious
phases of Chinese life, they are imaginative, colorful
and replete with poetry. For the first of these qualities
they might be likened to some of the creations of Edgar
Allan Poe, but even the weirdest of them possess a
tenderness to which Poe was a stranger.”

Arizona Republican, Phoenix, Ariz.: "It is not often
that such a book, as deserving of praise and as full of
real literary merit as "The Wind That Tramps the
World,” comes our way. This sounds like effusiveness,
but it isn’t. It’s merely giving credit for a real literary
achievement. . . . They are masterpieces of a rich
imagination, deep and gripping in their beauty and
romance.”

of Death, by Hugh Jeffries. An excellent science-fiction story. Next comes Ten
Million Years Ahead, by Edmond Hamilton. I’ll never tire of reading his stories.”

    From Toppenish, Washington, Mrs. Grace Penfield writes: "One story in your
April-May issue has brought me the urge to write to you. It is A Rendezvous in
Averoigne, by Clark Ashton Smith. To me the perfect weird tale must ring true, and
must be weird to the nth degree. This story fills both bills. The writer tells a tale
in such a manner that you feel it all the way through, and, having some of the good
old Irish, banshee-believing blood in my veins, truth to tell he had me almost believing
it. Even though he relates the end of the Sieur du Malinbois and his chatelaine,
sure an’ you’ll never catch me in the wood of Averoigne, at all, at all. I am looking
forward to more by this author.”

    Robert Leonard Russell, of Mount Vernon, Illinois, writes to the Eyrie: "I am
very glad to see that you have had the good sense to comply with the readers’ wishes
in changing W. T. back to a monthly. (It really should be a semi-monthly or a
weekly.) I am also pleased to note that you have a newLovecraft story ready for the
near future; he wastes a good idea for a story in each section of his monthly poetry
column, Fungi from Yuggoth. I am glad that you will again publish serials in
W. T.; serials are the backbone of any good magazine. But you should have a de
Grandin story in each issue (lately you have not). Your recent covers are punk; we
do not want portrait studies of insidious Orientals, monster boas and dinosaurs:
what we want is action pictures, pictures of scenes in the story. Since some of the
blue-nosed censors have kicked about nudes in your illustrations they have been cut
out entirely. I say that nudes are all right when needed to illustrate a certain
scene.”

    A letter from Mrs. George F. Hatton, Jr., of Battle Creek, Michigan, says:
"The best news I have heard in a long time is your decision to resume monthly pub-
lication; I thought those two-month stretches between issues were the longest I’d
ever experienced. I have been a reader of your very entertaining magazine for the
past six years and I would surely forego any other magazine except Weird Tales. I
wouldn’t even attempt to pick out all my favorite stories, as I wouldn’t know where to
stop. But I do like your cover designs much more than I formerly did.”

    Writes J. Wasso, Jr., of Pen Argyl, Pennsylvania: "Old W. T. will again be
a monthly! That’s the best news in many a moon! Now, please, resume the long,
pseudo-scientific interstellar serials. I would like to see many more stories by Love-
craft in Weird Tales; also more torture tales of the type of The Chain and The Cop-
per Bowl.”

    "I am at present rejoicing, as are the rest of your readers,” writes John R. Small,
of Washington, D. C., "that the monthly schedule is to be resumed. In the current
issue, a letter from Mr. William Brewster is printed. It has annoyed me consider-
ably, and I hope you won’t take his advice, namely, to print a magazine that will
please only your casual reader and not your host of faithful. Haven’t we shown
what we want? (Three cheers for Seabury Quinn, Jules de Grandin, and Doc

Howard!) There is a good deal of excitement in Harrisonville, but tell Mr. Quinn
it’s a great place and that if the old Frenchman does decide to widen the scope of his
activities to other sectors of the world, he will suffer, for he will be out of his
element and will not be as well understood elsewhere. Sergeant Costello is familiar
with him and, surely, there are enough mysteries in good old Harrisonville to keep
Jules de Grandin busy there. In my opinion the best story in your last issue was
The Dust of Death, by Hugh Jeffries. The author writes easily, clearly, and keeps
up the interest throughout his story. He has woven it carefully, and I, for one,
congratulate him for a splendid piece of work.”

    Earl Morgan, of Detroit, writes to the Eyrie: "I agree with the gentleman
who suggested a small department in which you could tell the readers something
about your authors. I, for one, would like to know something about them. I am
perhaps too inquisitive, but such questions as these have me curious: Is Seabury
Quinn a physician? How old is H. P. Lovecraft? Where does Edmond Hamilton
live? Is Robert E. Howard a professor of history at the University of Southern Cal-
ifornia? (I have heard he is.) Is Greye La Spina a man or a woman? Is Nictzin
Dyalhis a real or just a book name? (If it is his real name it is a very pretty-sound-
ing monicker.) These are just a few of the many questions that I would like an-
swered.” [Just a minute until we get our breath, and we will try to answer your
questions. No, Seabury Quinn is not a physician. He is editor of a trade journal,
and was formerly a lawyer. He was in the Intelligence Service of the A. E. F. We
do not know how old Mr. Lovecraft is, although we have an approximate idea. We
suggest that you write him, care of Weird Tales, and ask him. Edmond Hamilton
lives in New Castle, Pennsylvania. No, Robert E. Howard is not a professor of an-
cient history, and he lives in Texas instead of in California. Greye La Spina is a
woman, and a grandmother too, although a rather young one. Nictzin Dyalhis is a
real and not a book name. The first name is Toltec Indian (his mother came from
Guatemala); the last name is one of the oldest of English names.—The Editors.]
A letter from Charles Rush, Jr., of New York, says: "Allow me to congratulate
you on Edmond Hamilton’s last two tales, The Horror City and Ten Million Years
Ahead. What delighted me most in the February-March issue, however, was that
beautiful story, The Ghost-Helper. If Seabury Quinn keeps that thread of pathos in
his de Grandin stories, I am sure he will rise to that position in weird literature that
in my estimation is now held by H. P. Lovecraft.”

    "I wish you could induce H. P. Lovecraft to write at least four or five stories for
you each year,” writes Paul S. Smith, of Orange, New Jersey. • "He is a wonderful
writer and I am sure all the readers have greatly regretted the absence of new
stories by him during the past two years. The April-May number of Weird Tales
was excellent as a whole; but to me, by far the best thing in this issue is the first
paragraph of the Eyrie, which states that the magazine will again be published
monthly instead of bi-monthly. I have always found it hard to wait one month be-
tween issues; but to have to wait two months is a pretty terrible ordeal. But now,
praise be, we are to have it every month again.”

(Continued from page 440)

    Dale V. Simpson, of Marion, Ohio, writes to the Eyrie: "I am quite overjoyed
to know that Lovecraft is to have in another tale. The Whisperer in Darkness!
What maleficent ultramondane adumbrations that title brings to one’s mind! Things
from Outside! . . . Do any of us know that there are not? ... I certainly hope the
story appears soon. The Horror from the Hills, by Long, is great! Second only to
The Dunwich Horror! May we have many more from that author. By the way,
speaking of The Dunwich Horror, I sent my copy of W. T. containing the story
to a young friend in England. He writes me that it is quite one of the best stories he
has ever read. It was the first copy of Weird Tales he had ever seen, he said, and
wished 'Woolies’ (Woolworth’s) would get it in. (He gets quite a number of Amer-
ican magazines at Woolworth’s store in Sheffield.)”

    From Penn Yan, New York, writes Jack T. Whitfield: "Having received the
latest issue of W. T. I note with much joy that you have decided to change back; to
the old monthly output. This is wonderful news and I am confident that every reader
will be elated over your announcement. I enjoy greatly most of the stories you pub-
lish, though I am not so keen on interplanetary stuff. I like stories of Chinese torture,
vampire and werewolf stories, and also those about tropical growths that menace cit-
ies and countries. To my mind the big three of your writers are: Lovecraft, Long,
and Quinn. I always enjoy each story they turn out. Lovecraft is the peer of them
all for stark horror. His style is perfect and his mode of telling (in which the hor-
ror creeps and grows and almost becomes tangible) is magnificent.”

    Readers, what is your favorite story in this issue? The most popular story in
the April-May number, as shown by your votes and letters, was Clark Ashton
Smith’s exquisite vampire story, A Rendezvous in Averoigne. Not far behind it in
popularity was The Dead-Alive, that thrilling story of corpses that walk in the night,
by Nat Schachner and Arthur L. Zagat.

Tam, Son of the Tiger ^

 By OTIS ADELBERT KLINE

CHAPTER 1

The Man-Eater

BURMA—land of mystery, of gilded
Buddhas and almond-eyed danc-
ing-girls, of patient elephants pil-
ing teak, of shaven, yellow-robed priests,
smoldering incense, and the silver tinkle
of temple bells.

The jungle—teeming with tropical life
and potential death.

In its upper branches were the feath-
ered inhabitants. Liquid tones of sweet-
voiced songsters competed with the harsh,
raucous cries of parrots and crows. Flashes
of brightly pigmented plumage contrasted
with the greens and browns of the vegeta-
tion. Peacocks proudly spread their
painted fans.

A little lower, monkeys chattered at

spider-limbed gibbons with faces like
little old men. A sleek, well-fed leopard
basked on a thick limb, its mottled hide
blending perfectly with the black and
gold shadows that descended through the
leafy canopy.

  And on the forest floor, creeping
through the undergrowth with cat-like
stealth, was that most cunning and fero-
cious of all jungle creatures—the man-
eating tiger.

  The leopard bristled, laid back its small
ears, and growled softly at sight of the
huge striped terror passing beneath. The
monkeys and gibbons heard that growl
and scampered away through the branches.
A rusty black crow cocked its head to one
side and stared for a moment with beady
eyes. Then it uttered a sharp, rasping
"Tam dangled limply from her mouth.'

"caw!” that plainly said "tiger!” to all
jungle inhabitants. The peafowls rose,
en masse, with a thunderous whir of
wings.

And the tiger, snarling its anger at this
premature exposure of its presence, and
knowing that all concealment was at an
end, charged straight for the human be-
ing, straggling behind the others, which
it had marked for its prey.

Major Charles evans, young Amer-
ican philanthropist and sportsman,
had come to Burma with a twofold pur-
pose: to gather chaulmoogra seeds for

planting on the Hawaiian land which he
had donated to the leper colony at Kalau-
papa, and to hunt tigers. With him were
his wife, Lucille, and his two-year-old son,
Tam.

After a boat trip down the Irrawaddy
and up the Mu from Mandalay, they had
come to the village of Kyokta, near which
it was said the chaulmoogra might be
found. Scouts under the leadership of
Zahn, son of the village tapes, or head-
man, had quickly located several exten-
sive stands of the trees, and toward one
of these Evans and his wife journeyed
after a night in a Kyokta hut. They were
445
446

WEIRD TALES

guided by Zahn and his friends, who car-
ried baskets for gathering the fruit from
which the seeds were to be later removed.
Tam had been left at the village in the
care of his colored nurse maid, Clarabelle
Jackson, who had accompanied them from
the United States.

  Zahn proudly marched at the head of
the .procession. Just behind him walked
the American and his wife. Major Evans
was tall, broad-shouldered and athletic.
He wore high laced boots, khaki trousers,
a shooting-jacket with large pockets, and
a pith helmet. Beside him walked his
pretty young wife, dressed exactly like
her husband, but so small and daintily
feminine that even in mannish clothes
there was no mistaking her sex. Four
villagers who acted as gun-bearers came
behind them, carrying two heavy, double-
barreled .450 Bury rifles, a Winchester
and a Savage. The major had high hopes
of stalking a tiger, but not the slightest
suspicion that, at that very moment, the
striped death was stalking his own party.

  Following the gun-bearers were a score
of villagers with the baskets and bags
which were to be filled with the fruit of
the chaulmoogra. And at the rear trailed
Kru Muang, youthful chum of Zahn. The
handle of his basket was slung over one
arm, and he was using his spear as a staff.

  Suddenly the boy heard a sharp "caw!”
from a near-by branch, followed by the
flapping of startled peafowls, a low snarl,
and the rush of a heavy body through the
undergrowth behind him.

  "Suar! Suar!” he shouted, springing
forward. "Tiger! Tiger!” Then he
uttered a single piercing shriek of terror
and agony as the huge teeth of the charg-
ing man-eater sank into his shoulder,
hurling him to the ground.

  Half of the villagers instantly dropped
their baskets and bags, and took to the
trees. The others stood their ground,

clutching their spears in readiness for
attack, but making no move to help the
stricken boy. The major wrested one of
the heavy Burys from the trembling hands
of a frightened gun-bearer, but before he
could bring it to his shoulder a brown-
skinned body flashed between him and the
tiger, which was now shaking its prey as
a cat shakes a mouse. It was Zahn, armed
only with his spear, dashing to the rescue
of his chum.

  The man-eater saw him coming, and
dropping its prey, launched its striped
bulk through the air. Zahn halted and
extended his spear, but the great carni-
vore swept the puny weapon aside with
one huge paw, and seizing his face in its
mighty jaws, bore him to earth.

  Evans, who had not dared to shoot be-
fore for fear of hitting Zahn, now fired.
At the impact of the heavy projectile, the
tiger leaped high in the air. Just as it
struck the ground the major fired again,
and it sank down motionless beside the
chief’s son.

  The sportsman reached for a second
gun and advanced cautiously. Going up to
the beast, he prodded it with the end of
the weapon. But it was limp and lifeless.
Shot first through the body, then through
the head, the terrible man-eater had
breathed its last.

  Gingerly, the natives formed a ring
around the fallen brute and his two vic-
tims. Lucille Evans glanced at Zahn, then
averted her eyes with a shudder. He was
past all help, his face completely bitten
away. She knelt beside Kru Muang. His
shoulder was cruelly torn and lacerated,
but he was still breathing.

  With water from her flask, and gauze
from the emergency kit, she bathed his
wounds. Then the major saturated them
with iodine and helped her to bind them.

  The natives had, meanwhile, rigged
two pole litters for the fallen. The carcass
TAM, SON OF THE TIGER

of the tiger was suspended from another
pole thrust through its bound feet and
carried by four men. Then the sad little
procession turned its footsteps back to-
ward the village. There would be no jour-
'iey to the chaulmoogra groves that day.

When they drew near to the village, the
major went on ahead in order that he
might break the news to the tapes before
his son’s mutilated body was brought in.
But he met him coming out of the vil-
lage at the head of a considerable body of
armed men who seemed very much ex-
cited.

The major walked up to the old fellow,
and said:

"It is my sad duty to inform you that
your son, Zahn, has just been killed by a
tiger. He died a hero, giving his life to
save his chum, Kru Muang, who is being
brought in badly wounded.”

The old man halted, and for some time
regarded him in silence, tears flooding
his eyes and starting down his withered
cheeks. Then he replied:

"Let us mourn together, sahib, for this
day both of us have been bereaved.”

"Both of us? What do you mean?
Speak!”

"Your little son has just been carried off
by a white tigress, sahib. We were com-
ing out to tell you.”

CHAPTER 2

The White Tigress

Leang, the white tigress, stalked majes-
J tically through the jungle grass near
the Village of Kyokta, her tail held high,
and on her feline features a look of su-
preme satisfaction. She had just dined ex-
ceedingly well, having slain a water buf-
falo in the jungle, and was on her way to
the river to quench the thirst which fol-
lowed her feast.

Having drunk her fill at the stream,

she was returning by the way she had
come, when something white and spheri-
cal rolled across her path, startling her
considerably. She was within fifty feet of
one of the village huts, and knew that it
must have come from that direction. This
sphere, which caused her involuntarily to
pause and then leap backward, was an af-
front to her dignity. Never before had she
been molested by a human being. Men re-
spected her, not only because she was a ti-
gress, but because she was a white tigress.
They did not send arrows, spears and bul-
lets after her as they did at her common
striped relatives.

She looked in the direction whence the
sphere had come, and saw a tiny man-
thing running toward her—a little lad
with dark curly hair, wearing a loose khaki
blouse, shorts, and tiny, high-laced boots.
He was laughing, the spontaneous, care-
free laughter of healthy childhood, as he
pursued the rubber ball which he had just
hurled into the jungle grass. The tigress
crouched, waiting to see what he would do
next.

Suddenly the boy came face to face with
her — saw her for the first time. She
snarled, politely warning him away, for
Leang was not a man-eater. Furthermore,
she had so stuffed herself with buffalo
flesh that she would not be able to eat a
morsel for many hours to come.

But this boy, it seemed, was not so
ready to run from her as had been most
other humans she had encountered.

"Ooh! Big kitty!” he exclaimed, and
paused, staring at her.

She stared back, slightly jerking the
tip of her tail in token of annoyance, and
snarled again, but more softly.

"Big kitty mustn’t be mad with Tam,”
he said. "Tam won’t hurt you.” Then he
fearlessly and deliberately walked up to
her and scratched her behind the ear.

The tigress was so amazed at this un-
448

WEIRD TALES

precedented temerity that she forgot to
snarl again. The little hand scratching her
neck felt good. She made a contented
noise deep down in her throat, and tilted
her head to one side that the boy might
better reach the spot which had begun to
feel so pleasant under his ministrations.
Leang was purring like a house cat, but
with a noise that more nearly resembled
the rumbling of distant thunder. And
while she purred, the boy prattled to her
in a voice that was soft and soothing.

  "Big kitty want to play ball?” he asked,
presently. "Come on and play ball with
Tam.”

  He picked up the ball and rolled it to-
ward her.

  Leang was a young tigress} and had not
yet lost her liking for play. Moreover, she
had played with a ball before, as she had
been raised by a man—a very strange man.
She tapped the ball lightly, rolling it back
at die boy, who chuckled with glee. For
some time they played together, the tigress
apparently enjoying herself fully as much
as the boy. Then their play was inter-
rupted by the sound of a woman’s voice.

  “Tam! Tam! Where is you, honey?”

  The boy paused in his play to reply:

  "Here I am, Clarabelle. Come and see
big kitty Tam found.”

  Again he rolled the ball at the tigress,
but she paid no attention to it. She was
snarling slightly, ears cocked in the direc-
tion whence the sound of the maid’s voice
had come.

  The colored girl, who had been dozing
in the doorway of the hut, and had awak-
ened to find Tam missing, advanced to-
ward the jungle grass which concealed boy
and beast. Suddenly she caught sight of
the tigress, and shrieked at the top of her
voice.

  Her cry brought people running from
the bamboo huts near by. The old Bud-
dhist priest poked his shaven head out the

door of the teakwood temple. A crowd of
people gathered around the negress as she
shrieked again and fell in a swoon.

  "Suar! Suar!” a voice cried, and some
of the men ran to get their spears.

  Tam picked up his ball and stood beside
the now thoroughly aroused tigress. Her
tail lashed the grass stalks and she growled
thunderously. The menace in the cries and
actions of the villagers was unmistakable.
This was annoying. She and the boy had
been having so much fun before this inter-
ruption. Well, they would go somewhere
else to play.

  She started away with a low invitation
to Tam to follow, much like the "mew”
of a mother cat. But he did not under-
stand. He only stood looking at her. She
paused and called again, but still he stood
there, bewildered, looking first at her and
then at the crowd of excited villagers sur-
rounding the swooning Clarabelle.

  Leang’s feline mind considered. This
man-thing was only a cub, and had not
yet learned to understand the mother call.
Like any other cub, he must be taught its
meaning. She accordingly returned, and
picking him up by the collar of his blouse,
trotted away.

  When they saw this the assembled vil-
lagers redoubled their cries. Men came
running with spears. One carried an old
muzzle-loading gun. But none of the
weapons was used, for those who carried
them saw that the tigress was white, a
sacred animal which they believed to be
a reincarnation of some great lady, per-
haps a ranee, or even a minor goddess.
While they watched, awe-stricken, she
gave a great leap and disappeared in the
jungle. She continued to run with tail
held high and Tam dangling limply from
her mouth until the sounds of the voices
died away. Then she stood him on his
feet.

  Tam stroked her head and back.

                     W. T.—1
TAM, SON OF THE TIGER

449

   "Nice kitty,” he said. "Gave Tam big
ride. More.”

   But Leang didn’t want to linger, nor
did she care to play just then. She did
want to teach this man-cub to understand
and obey her orders. Also her distending
mammae had begun to remind her that
she must get back to her own cub, which
would be hungry and in need of her
ministrations.

   She took a few steps, calling to the boy
to follow her. When he did not move
she returned, and taking him by the arm,
led him for a little way. Then she let go
and called once more. This time, he
followed.

   But the way was long and difficult for
a little boy of two, and soon Tam grew
very tired.

   "Wait, kitty,” he called. "Don’t go so
fast.”

   But the tigress proceeded, paying no
attention.

PRESENTLY, Tam stumbled and fell.
He was exhausted. Leang turned and
looked at him for a moment. Then she
promptly returned, picked him up by his
collar, and carried him on. His slight
weight did not inconvenience her at all,
for Leang was fully capable of lifting the
huge bulk of an ox or buffalo, and had
often done it.

   After traveling many miles at a steady,
tireless trot, she came to an ancient wall
covered with vines and creepers. She
leaped to its summit and, dropping lightly
to the other side, crossed a weed-grown
grass plot and entered the doorway of a
small pagoda of wood and glazed tile,
one of a pair that stood on each side of
the entrance to a large wot, or temple,
much of which was in ruins.

   Inside the ancient pagoda, she set Tam
on his feet. Then she affectionately licked
the little striped cub that came toddling
W. T.—2

and mewling from a comer at her

approach.

Tam tried to pet the cub, but it spit
at him and he backed away. He had had
some painful experiences with house cats
that spit.

Leang lay down on her side and the
cub promptly found a nipple. Soon it was
purring contentedly, pumping industri-
ously with both front paws as it absorbed
the warm and indubitably fresh milk.
Tam watched this process with consider-
able interest. It was long past his lunch
time, and he, too, was thirsty and hungry.
Presently he approached more closely and
sat down beside the cub. The tigress
leaned over and nuzzled him, pushing
him down toward the source of the liquid
food supply, of which there was an over-
abundance for her one cub. Then she lay
back and rolled slightly—invitingly. It
was a plain bid to tiffin, and the boy ac-
cepted hungrily.

Tam had tasted mother’s milk, goat’s
milk, cow’s milk and tinned milk, but
never before had he tasted tiger’s milk.
And never before had milk of any va-
riety tasted quite so good. He pumped
and drank until his little stomach was dis-
tended quite comfortably. Then he slept,
his tousled head pillowed on a furry fore-
leg.

When Tam awoke, the newly risen sun
was sending its first shafts into the pa-
goda, and birds were caroling their morn-
ing songs. The tiger cub was curled into
a striped, furry ball beside him, but the
tigress was gone.

He looked about him in bewilderment
at first, for it seemed to him that he must
be in his little cot next to that of his fa-
ther and mother, and that they were sure-
ly there beside him. When he realized
where he was he began to feel very sad
and lonely, and very much afraid.

"Mother!” he cried. "Daddy!”
450

WEIRD TALES

But only the twittering, screeching and
chattering of the jungle folk answered
him.

He sat up and again called to his par-
ents at the top of his voice. Then,, realiz-
ing that they were not with him, he began
to cry.

The cub, disturbed by the strange
noises, uncurled itself and toddled over to
him. Evidently understanding that he
was in distress, it rubbed its striped sides
against him—a friendly, sympathetic ges-
ture that showed it had accepted him as a
member of the family circle.

Never before had there been a time in
Tam’s short life when his wailing had not
speedily brought some one to do some-
thing about it—to pick him up, comfort
him, and humor him. Now it amazed
and disconcerted him to find that no mat-
ter how loudly he howled, nobody came.
For the first time in his life he was learn-
ing the lesson which the prophet, Mo-
hammed, learned many centuries before
—that if one wanted a mountain and it
wouldn’t come when called, one had best
go to the mountain.

Rubbing his tear-filled eyes with his
small fists, he got up and walked out into
the sunshine, the cub waddling after him.
He was in a large, walled enclosure, in
the center of which stood the ruined tem-
ple. The only way out was barred by a
tall, brass gate, sagging on its hinges and
covered with the verdigris of centuries.

Hungry, thirsty, and homesick, Tam
wept softly to himself as he wandered
aimlessly about the enclosure, accom-
panied by the cub. Convinced that there
was no one to hear his cries, he no longer
screamed at the top of his voice.

But one of the jungle creatures had
heard. For a moment it gazed down from
the top of the wall at this luscious and
helpless morsel which might easily be had
for the taking. Its eyes glowed with a

greenish-yellow light which showed that
it was fearful of the pungent tiger scent.
But its hunger evidently overcame its fear
of the great beast’s lair, for it leaped
lightly into the enclosure and bounded
toward the boy and cub.

The cub spit angrily, then turned and
ran toward the pagoda. Tam, looking up,
saw a big "kitty,” covered with black
spots against an orange background,
bounding toward him. There was some-
thing about its demeanor which struck
terror into his little heart. He turned and
ran after the retreating cub, but before he
could reach the pagoda, sharp claws
ripped through his blouse.

Then, snarling ferociously, the leopard
bore him to earth.

CHAPTER 3

Jungle Justice

IEANG, the white tiger-mother, awoke
■J early and went forth into the gray
dawn. After quenching her thirst at the
ancient fountain of bronze and marble
which, though centuries had passed since
it was built, still bubbled and splashed in
the center of the enclosure, she leaped the
wall and set off through the jungle at a
rapid trot.

It was with pleasant anticipation that
she thought of the many pounds of buffalo
flesh waiting to be consumed where she
had left her kill the day before. The more
she thought of that excellent meat the
keener her appetite became, and the faster
she trotted. True, it would have become
a bit "high” after many hours in the heat,
but this mattered not a whit to Leang.
Although unlike some human epicures,
she preferred her meat fresh, she was not
at all averse to eating it after it had be-
come quite putrid.

But as she drew near the spot where
she had left the carcass there came to her
TAM, SON OF THE TIGER

451

sensitive nostrils a fetid body-scent that
caused the hairs of her neck and back to
stiffen and a low rumble to issue from her
throat. Jackals! She bounded forward at
top speed and arrived at the spot just in
time to see a dozen slinking forms melt
into the shadows. Of the carcass there
remained only part of the skull, the horns,
and a few gnawed vertebras and rib bones,
all reeking with the stench of the jungle
scavengers.

  Leang lashed the undergrowth with her
long tail as she roared her rage and dis-
appointment, but she did not attempt to
follow the skulking forms. Many times
before had she been despoiled of her prey
by jackals, and she had learned that it was
useless to attempt to capture the elusive
thieves.

  After sniffing about for some time to
make sure there were no edible morsels
which the jackals had overlooked, the
thoroughly angered tigress set off once
more toward her lair. As she traveled,
she hunted by the way. Presently an un-
wary peahen fell prey to her skill and
partly satisfied her hunger. This put her
in a slightly better humor as she ap-
proached the temple ruins. Then she
heard a cry—the wail of her man-cub.
She quickened her pace.

  A spotted form flashed to the top of
the wall, hung there for a moment, and
then dropped to the other side. Leang
bounded forward.

  Over the wall she hurtled in one great
leap, her feet barely touching its top. Her
own cub was scampering toward the
pagoda. Her man-cub, trying to follow,
was brought down by the leopard.

  Intent on his prey, the spotted carni-
vore did not see the charging mother
tiger until she was almost upon him. He
turned just in time to receive a cuff that
sent him rolling over and over for fully
twenty feet. Recovering with the agility

common to all members of the cat tribe,
he dashed for the wall. Once in the jungle,
he could easily elude the tigress. A tre-
mendous spring carried him to the top
of the wall. It was his last. Powerful
jaws closed on the back of his neck. Long
sharp claws sank into his mottled shoul-
ders. He was dragged back into the
enclosure.

  The tigress and leopard fell to the
earth together, the former growling thun-
derously, the latter screaming his fear and
pain. As this fearful uproar smote upon
the ears of the lesser jungle creatuies,
their own voices were stilled. Rodents
hastily sought their burrows. Climbers
scrambled for the highest branches. Birds
flew to another part of the jungle.

  But the screeching of the leopard soon
ceased, as Leang, with the precision of a
trained surgeon, bit through his cervical
vertebras. For a moment a shudder ran
through his frame. Then he lay limp and
lifeless beneath her.

  Far overhead a passing kite paused in
its flight, wheeled, and circled lower. Then
it dropped like a plummet, alighting on
the fronds of a tall palm that stood in the
enclosure. Soon it was joined by a host
of others, and by several vultures, all ap-
parently materialized from a clear sky.

Tam, who had regained his feet and
scampered into the pagoda with the
cub, crouched in the doorway, watching
breathlessly. His back smarted where the
leopard’s claws had punctured his khaki
blouse, but he had not been injured
otherwise.

  Crouching beside her kill, the tigress,
whose tremendous hunger had only been
partly satisfied by the peahen, leisurely
began her second breakfast, starting on
the hind quarters as is the custom with
the great cats. Her audience of vultures
and kites watched hungrily, the former
452

WEIRD TALES

craning their scrawny necks, the latter
maintaining their balance on the swaying
fronds by flapping their black wings from
time to time as if applauding.

Her hunger satisfied, the tigress drank
at the fountain and went into the pagoda.
Tam, who had been fearfully watching
the proceedings from the doorway, saw
the kites and vultures descend to finish
what was left of his terrible enemy. Then
he joined the cub at breakfast.

Man can live where he pleases because
of his capacity for adapting himself to
any environment. Young or old, weak or
strong, he has this ability to a far greater
extent than any other animal.

And thus it was that Tam, finding him-
self living under a new set of conditions,
was soon as much at ease in the tiger’s
lair as he had formerly been in the home
of his parents.

Here he had a broader vista than the
four walls of his nursery had afforded,
and real live "kitties” for playmates, in-
stead of imitations stuffed with sawdust
and excelsior.

It was not long before Leang began
bringing meat to her lair—freshly killed
peafowls, wild boars, deer, and at times,
great haunches of buffalo meat.

The boy and cub feasted very daintily
on these at first, both preferring the liquid
food to which they were accustomed. But
it was not long before they grew to like
meat above everything else, and became
as clamorous as small children around a
parent bringing candv whenever Leang
returned after a kill.

The cub grew with a rapidity that
amazed Tam. In six months he was as
large as the boy, and much stronger,
though Tam, playing with him every day,
was developing strength far beyond his
years. They had many romps and mimic
fights under the approving eye of the tiger
mother, and played with the ball until it

was completely worn out by the cub’s
teeth and claws.

Tam’s clothes soon went to pieces, but
he had no desire to replace them. He was
far more comfortable in that hot climate
without them. His shoes soon began to
pinch his growing feet, and he discarded
these, also.

It was not long before he began think-
ing of himself, not as a human being but
as a tiger. He imitated all the sounds
made by Leang and the cub, and soon
grew to know the meaning of each. He
could understand them or be understood
without difficulty.

When the cub grew large and strong,
Leang, as is the custom of tiger mothers,
brought live game into the enclosure to
be killed by the youngsters. Here the cub
excelled, as in the mock fighting, and
Tam shed tears of envy because of his
own inability to grow such splendid claws
and teeth.

Leang also taught both of them the
value of moving silently through the grass
and undergrowth. One of their favorite
games was for both to separate, then each
to try to stalk the other. At this game
Tam soon learned to excel the cub, and
these victories helped to salve his
wounded pride at being defeated in the
mock battles and outclassed in the game
killings.

Then came the time when Leang called
them to accompany her on a hunt. The
cub was, by this time, able to leap to the
top of the wall, but Tam, try as he would,
couldn’t make it. Fearful of being left
behind, he ran to the gate, squeezed his
slim brown body between the bars, and
hurried after the two beasts, his feet as
silent and his movements as stealthy as
Leang’s own.

They found royal game indeed for the
first day. It was a big bull buffalo. Leang
showed them how to stalk it, keeping to
TAM, SON OF THE TIGER

453

windward and moving noiselessly. But
when she roared the signal to charge, Tam
made the mistake of getting in front of
the beast. Before it was dragged down
by Leang it tossed the boy with one long
horn. Scratched and bruised, but not
pierced by the horn, Tam fell in the soft
mud fully twenty feet away. He had
learned, long since, that crying was a use-
less accomplishment in the jungle, and
got up without a whimper to return for
his share of the kill.

  There were many hunts after that, in
some of which Tam was quite painfully
injured. But he eventually learned to
avoid the horns and hoofs of deer and
buffalo, and the tusks of boars.

By the time Tam reached his seventh
year the cub was a full-grown tiger,
as large and strong as his mother. Some-
times the three hunted in concert, but
often one or the other would wander off
to hunt alone.

  Tam took to exploring the jungle by
himself, not merely for the sake of hunt-
ing—he killed only when hungry—but
because of the pleasure it gave him to
observe the wild things. Leang had
taught him to avoid the haunts of men,
but like all boys he was very curious, and
often went as near to the villages as he
could approach without being seen, in
order to learn how the strange and terrible
creatures, shaped like himself, lived.

  Once he saw a traveling fakir charming
a cobra with his queer, squalling noise-
stick. Tam remembered the sounds made
by that strange stick, and on his return
to the wat imitated them with consider-
able success, for he was a born mimic.

  Leang had taught him to give all ser-
pents a wide berth, and for this reason
he had never dared to explore the rear
rooms of the temple, which were in-
habited by cobras. He decided to try his

new magic on one of them. The subject
he selected paid no attention to him at
first, but he persisted until it raised its
hooded head and swayed in time to the
barbaric strains. Emboldened by his suc-
cess, he approached the snake, stroked it,
and picked it up, finally depositing it on
the floor and getting away unscathed.
Often after that he amused himself at the
dangerous sport of snake-charming, until
the cobras paid no more attention to his
comings and goings than to each other.

  After this, he made friends with many
of the other jungle creatures. By watching
them patiently, day after day, he learned
the meanings of the various sounds they
made, and, imitating them, was thus able
to converse with each in its own language.

  From the monkeys and gibbons he
quickly learned the art of swift silent
travel through the upper traffic lanes of
the jungle. From these, also, he learned
that certain fruits and nuts were very good
to eat, and often supplemented his meat
diet with them. As soon as they learned
that he would not harm them, they ac-
cepted him as a friend and companion,
and he passed many pleasant hours with
them, amused by their strange antics.

  Two or three times in his wanderings
he came upon men, and these meetings
were always unpleasant. The first man
he met, a member of a fierce hill tribe,
hurled a spear at him. It pierced his arm
and clung there for some time as he scur-
ried away through the forest. He plucked
it out and flung it from him, but it left a
painful wound that was many days in
healing.

  Several times after that he came upon
men unexpectedly, and all of them were
ready to use their weapons first and ask
questions afterward. He decided that
men, like leopards, jackals and hyenas,
could only be regarded as dangerous
enemies, and had best be avoided.
454

WEIRD TALES

The first herd of wild elephants he en-
countered excited his wonder. For many
days he followed them, observing how the
great pachyderms lived.

Once, in his northern wanderings, he
came into a teak forest that was being
worked. Here there were many elephants
laboring under the direction of men, who
sometimes walked beside them, some-
times sat on their necks. These elephants
wore wooden bells that went: "Tika, tok,
tok, tok,” and some had leg-irons that
clanked when they moved.

Always keeping well out of sight, Tam
watched the mahouts, striving to learn
how they controlled the great brutes, and
resolving that some day he, too, would
capture an elephant and cause it to obey
him. He noticed that the ankus, or ele-
phant hook, was a part of every mahout’s
equipment, and one night succeeded in
pilfering one and getting away unscathed.
He returned to the wat with his treasure,
but the wild herd had moved to another
feeding-ground; so he put the ankus away
in the pagoda for future reference.

Tam took no notice of the passing of
time, but he did notice that as the seasons
came and went he grew larger and
stronger, whereas, after the fifth year,
Leang’s cub had ceased to grow. Several
times during those years, strange tigers
had come to the wat, evidently attracted
by Leang, but these she had always driven
away.

In his wanderings through the jungle,
Tam also met a number of strange tigers.
They neither ran from him nor attempted
to attack him, but treated him precisely
as if he were another tiger. This was be-
cause if they voiced their thoughts and
feelings, as tigers often do, he answered
them in their own language. If they re-
mained silent, he addressed them in the
same language, making it plain that
though he was friendly enough, he was

not to be trifled with, for he was a very
devil of a tiger, himself.

By the time he was twelve years of age
he could pull down his buck or boar quite
as well as Leang, though a buffalo was
still too much for him.

One day, after he and the two tigers
had slain and devoured a buck, they re-
turned to the temple enclosure to drink
at the fountain.

Suddenly they heard a voice, a human
voice, at the gate.

"Leang,” it said.

Turning, Tam beheld a tall man with
a wrinkled yellow face, peering through
the gate. He wore a red cap, and a robe
of the same color, caught over his left
shoulder. His right arm and shoulder
were bare.

To Tam, every man was a deadly
enemy. He snarled fiercely, and the tiger
echoed his snarl.

But Leang only stared at the stranger.

CHAPTER 4

The Red Lama

Iozong, the pious lama, drew his robe
-4 of red Lhasa cloth more tightly about
his tall, straight figure as he plunged into
the jungle trail which he had not taken for
more than ten years, and which was nearly
obliterated by the vegetation.

When necessary, he swung his dah, or
double-curved jungle knife, to clear the
path. But as he cut and forced his way
through the thick undergrowth he did not
for a moment cease to lay up merit for
himself in the world to come, for over and
over again his lips framed the mystical
formula: "Om mani padme hum” [O,
Jewel in the Lotus, Amen.]

Despite his priestly garb and pious
declamations there was something in the
bearing of Lozong which made it appear
that he had not always been a man of the
TAM, SON OF THE TIGER

455

robe and alms-bowl. His straight, sol-
dierly figure smacked more of the camp
and battlefield, and the ease and precision
with which he used his dah showed more
than casual acquaintance with a cutting
weapon.

  His Mongoloid features were old, and
yet young, for though his sun-cured skin
was like wrinkled yellow parchment, his
black eyes flashed with a fire that was
decidedly youthful. They were the eyes
of a conqueror, descendant of a race that
had once terrorized the entire civilized
world, and were strangely incongruous in
the otherwise austere countenance.

  As he hewed and chanted his way
through the jungle, he wondered if Leang,
the white tigress, still lived in the pagoda
before the temple ruins in which he had
made his home for five years, and from
which, ten years before, he had emerged
to go on a long pilgrimage. He had
visited most of the celebrated shrines of
India, Burma and Siam, learning Sanskrit
that he might study the ancient religious
books of India, and seeing many strange
and wonderful sights.

  Thirteen years before, Lozong, who
had retired to the old sacred ruins to medi-
tate in solitude and to lay up merit, had
found an orphan tiger cub less than three
months old playing in a nest beneath the
umbrella-like foliage of a korinda. The
bones of the mother lay near by, picked
clean by scavengers. She had evidently
been shot or poisoned, and had succumbed
before she could reach her lair.

  The cub, which was a white female, was
half starved. Had it been an ordinary
striped animal, Lozong would have left it
there to die, but as it was white, and there-
fore sacred, he could acquire much merit
by saving its life. He had accordingly
captured the spitting and growling young-
ster in his robe, and taken it to his retreat,
establishing it in a grass nest in the pa-

goda. After that, for many months, he
had been kept busy trapping birds and
small game for his young charge, which
he named Leang. He built traps that
caught the game alive, then permitted
his pet to kill it, herself, so he need not
commit the sin of taking animal life.

  But Leang had eventually learned to
do her own hunting, and when she was
nearly three years old, began consorting
at night with her own kind. Lozong let
her come and go as she pleased, and she
remained quite friendly until, one morn-
ing when he approached the pagoda, she
warned him away with a thunderous
growl. He understood, and did not go
near her den for many days, nor did she
come to see him in his temple room as
was her wont.

  But one day as he was seated on the
temple steps eating his frugal meal of
curry and rice, donated by a village house-
wife, she had emerged from the pagoda
followed by four striped cubs which she
proudly led up to him for inspection.

  A few days later a tiger came—a great
striped brute. He killed and ate three of
the cubs which had been playing in the
temple enclosure. The fourth, asleep in
the pagoda, he overlooked. Leang re-
turned as he was devouring the third little
body. Lozong, watching from the temple
corridor, saw an exhibition of feline fury
such as it falls to the lot of few men to
witness. The tiger, badly scratched and
bitten, beat a hasty retreat. Nor did he
dare come near the place again. He had
been Leang’s mate, but never would she
mate with him again.

  A few days thereafter, Lozong had gone
on his long pilgrimage, bidding the sacred
tigress and her remaining cub a fond fare-
well. Now, as he neared the temple ruins,
his thoughts were on the two creatures he
had left there.

  Leang would be thirteen years old. The
456

WEIRD TALES

cub, which he had named "Chiam,”
would be ten—a full-grown tiger in his
prime.

  Suddenly, as he neared a little glade
which he knew to be but a short distance
from the temple ruins, he heard the roar
of a charging tiger and the crashing of
heavy bodies through the underbrush.
Silently he slid behind a tree and watched.

  Into the glade a buck came leaping.
Behind it bounded an immense tiger. It
looked as if the buck would escape when
there swiftly flashed from the under-
growth in its path, a lithe, sun-browned
human form—a slender boy about twelve
years of age, naked and unarmed. From
the other side a white tigress charged.
But it was the boy who brought down the
game. He met the buck in midair, gripped
the antlers and twisted them to one side.
As his prey went down he uttered a roar
that matched that of the tiger, and sank
his teeth into the furry throat.

  Then, while the astonished lama looked
on from his place of concealment, the
boy and two beasts settled down to feed
on their kill.

  Lozong did not doubt that the white
tigress was Leang. And the tiger might
be her cub, Chiam, or a new mate. But
this naked, black-haired boy with the voice
of a tiger and the muscles of a gladiator—
who could he be, and whence could he
have come? It was plain that he was not
of the tribes of Burma or Siam, nor yet
of India or Tibet. Though his skin was
deeply tanned by the sun, he was un-
doubtedly white, like the English or
French.

  The lama knew better than to approach
a feeding tiger. So he kept out of sight
until the boy and the two beasts had fin-
ished. He knew that after they had eaten
they would drink, and wondered if they
would go to the river or the temple. When
they turned toward the ruins his belief in

the identity of Leang was confirmed, and
he followed silently.

The boy and the two brutes leaped the
wall, and Lozong, watching through
the bars of the bronze gate, saw them
drinking at the fountain.

When they had finished, he cried:

"Leang.”

The tigress turned, looking curiously
in his direction. The boy and tiger both
snarled.

"Leang, come here,” he called, as he
had summoned her in the old days.

She pricked up her ears, elevated her
tail, and trotted toward the gate. Behind
her came the boy and the tiger.

In Leang’s attitude there was only curi-
osity, but the others were openly hostile.

"Don’t you remember me, Leang?”
asked Lozong. "Don’t you remember your
old master who fed you?”

The tigress sniffed at him through the
bars. The boy and tiger were snarling
belligerently.

Suddenly, with an angry snarl, the boy
sprang—raked the lama’s bare shoulder
with his nails. But Leang turned on him
—cuffed him back. At this instant the
tiger leaped, but him also she buffeted
back. Then she rubbed her jowl against
the bars, and Lozong knew that she
remembered.

Fearlessly he scratched her under the
chin—behind the ear—while she purred
loudly. The boy and the tiger remained
in the background, still unfriendly, but
obedient to the tigress.

Presently the lama took a large bronze
key from the voluminous breast pocket of
his robe, and inserted it in the lock of the
gate. It stuck with the corrosion acquired
during his ten years’ absence, but he
eventually succeeded in turning it. Then
he swung the gate on its complaining
TAM, SON OF THE TIGER

457

hinges and boldly entered, closing it after
him.

Leang stood aside to let him in, then
walked with him as he fearlessly strode
toward the temple. He watched the boy
and tiger from the corners of his eyes as
he passed, but they made no move to
molest him. It was evident that they had
a wholesome respect for the authority of
the white tigress.

Straight through the ruined temple
portal he went, and to the room he had
previously occupied. Here he squatted,
cross-legged, on the floor, and Leang
stretched out beside him. Unslinging his
alms-bowl, he lifted the bit of oily paper
which covered it, disclosing the rice and
ghee which a woman of the near-by vil-
lage had given him.

He made a greasy ball and held it out
to Leang, just as he had fed her from his
bowl ten years before. She took it daintily,
chewed it much more than was necessary,
and swallowed it. But when he offered
her more she turned her head away. Evi-
dently buttered rice was no longer to her
liking. It was as if she had taken the first
morsel for politeness’ sake.

Lozong ate rapidly, for the sun was
nearing the zenith and it was not per-
mitted that he eat solid food after midday.
Having completed his plain but satisfying
meal, he took his water-strainer from his
pocket and went out for a drink at the
fountain, the strainer being a religious
rather than a hygienic precaution, as it
was unlawful for him to take animal life,
even of the most minute kind.

Stretched in the shade of one of the
mango trees that lined the approach, the
boy and tiger barred his path to the foun-
tain. The lama did not wish to show fear,
nor did he desire to arouse either of them,
as he knew that if one should spring for
him, the other, also, would attack.

He advanced cautiously, intending to

circle the two and pass on. But just as he
turned aside from the path, an ugly,
hooded head reared its spectacled death-
sign above the grass.

The cobra swayed angrily for a moment
with darting tongue—then struck.

CHAPTER 5

The ‘First Lesson

The head of the striking cobra moved
as swiftly as an arrow, yet just a
fraction of a second quicker flashed the
dah of Lozong. There was a scarcely per-
ceptible turn of the lama’s wrist, and the
keen blade severed the venomous head
with the neat drawing cut of an expert.

Although he had momentarily saved
his own life by his quickness with the
weapon, Lozong, by making the sudden
movement, had instantly put it in jeopardy
again. The boy and tiger, basking in. the
shade, both took it for a hostile gesture.
Their roars resounded together as they
sprang for the lama.

According to Lozong’s belief he had
committed a deadly sin by slaying the
cobra, despite the fact that he had acted
on the spur of the moment to save his own
life. Many thousands of "Om mani
padme hums” would have to be said be-
fore sufficient merit was acquired to atone
for this one art.

But the instinct of self-preservation
made him turn again at this new attack,
his dah lightly balanced in the hand so
skilled in its use, as the boy and tiger
sprang at him.

Leang, right behind her former master,
leaped for the tiger, knocking him over.
In an instant he was rolling on the ground
with the tigress standing over him.

Seeing this, the lama smiled and
dropped his dah as the boy sprang upon
him. Tiger fashion, the lad attacked with
teeth and nails. And tigerish was the
458

WEIRD TALES

strength of the muscles that rippled be-
neath his sun-browned skin.

But Lozong, who had not always been
a lama, who was a past master in the arts
of offense and defense, knew how to meet
his every movement and turn it into de-
feat. Had it not been for the uncertainty
of what the tigers might do, he would
have played with him. But because of
that uncertainty, he quickly ended the
contest.

Catching one extended wrist, the lama
turned and dragged the arm across his
shoulder, throwing the boy heavily. Be-
fore he could recover, he was down beside
him, his hands playing skilfully here and
there. The lad was, for a time, paralyzed
—helpless. Lozong had learned jiu jitsu
from a Japanese expert, and learned it
well.

Picking up his dah, the lama sheathed
it and proceeded serenely toward the foun-
tain, precisely as if nothing had happened.
He drank, then returned to the temple,
looking neither to the right nor the left.
The boy, still unable to move, snarled as
he passed, but the tigers, now lying side
by side in the shade, made no sound.

Lozong squatted, cross-legged, in the
shade of the portal, and began clicking
the wooden beads of his rosary, the while
he muttered his monotonous: "Om mani
padme hum.” This prayer would have to
be said countless thousands of times in
order to recover the merit lost by slaying
the cobra.

But the repetition of the prayer was
purely mechanical. His mind was oc-
cupied with the problem of making
friends with the other occupants of the
wat. Leang, he believed, could be counted
on to remain friendly. The tiger, which
he now felt sure was Chiam because of the
way Leang had cuffed him about, was
more of a problem. Though he had petted
and handled him when a tiny cub, there

was no possibility of that memory assist-
ing him now. He must find some other
way.

  And the boy. He, indeed, was the great-
est problem of all. Wild and ferocious
as the tigers, and aided by a mind far
superior, he could be approached only
with the greatest caution. Lozong pon-
dered the course to be pursued as he mut-
tered his prayers and gazed out at him
through the dancing heat waves.

  Presently the lad, finding himself able
to move once more, stood up. He flexed
his muscles as if to make certain that they
would serve him. The lama forgot his
prayers for a moment, fearing another
attack as the boy looked in his direction.
But the lad turned and went over to where
the headless body of the cobra lay. No
malice showed on his features—only
wonder and curiosity. After examining
the decapitated reptile with evident puz-
zlement, he went over and lay down in
the shade with the panting tigers. So far
as the lama was concerned, he seemed
disposed to ignore his presence.

  As he lay there in the shade, Tam,
though feigning to completely ignore the
strange being who had moved into the
wat, was very much concerned about him.
He was puzzled by the fact that Leang
not only obeyed him as if she were his
cub, but actually showed affection for him,
even to the point of protecting him against
her own offspring.

  Despite the fact that he had always con-
sidered all men as his enemies, Tam was
beginning to believe that this unusual
person, who had defeated him almost
painlessly, was friendly.

  Suddenly the man in red began making
strange noises with his mouth, which
sounded very much like those made by
the people of the villages. To Tam, they
were incomprehensible, yet the man
seemed to be addressing him. Although,,
TAM, SON OF THE TIGER

459

during his ten years in the jungle he had
learned the language of most of the wild
things, Tam had not picked up a single
human word to add to the meager nursery
vocabulary he had brought with him at
the age of two. And even this, through
disuse, had been long forgotten.

  But now the man was making noises
which aroused some latent memory. Hav-
ing tried him with Tibetan, Burmese and
Siamese, Lozong was now speaking
English.

  "What is your name, my son?” he
asked. "Who are you?”

  At the words: "What is your name?”
there flashed through Tam’s mind the
recollection of an answer which should
follow—an answer in which he had been
drilled, day after day, by his parents in
case he should ever be lost. He turned
and faced the lama as he replied:

  "Tam Evans, 1130 Lake Shore Drive,
’Phone Lake Shore 0206.”

  "Come over here and sit with me in
the shade, Tam Evans,” said Lozong. "I
would be your friend.”

  Tam stared at him in bewilderment, not
because he couldn’t comprehend his mean-
ing, but because he could. Gradually
taking form in his objective conscious-
ness were memories, shadowy and indis-
tinct, of his father and mother, and of his
black nurse-maid, who had made such
sounds which he had understood, long,
long ago. Yet never, since that time, had
he heard human beings make sounds
which had any meaning for him.

  "You need not be afraid. I won’t hurt
you,” assured the lama.

  At this, Tam sneered.

  "You hurt Tam? Tam afraid? No!
Tam is a fierce kitty. Tam could kill and
eat you.” He amazed himself as the un-
familiar speech rolled from his lips, for
he was translating into English exactly

what he would have said to a strange tiger
inclined to be bellicose.

The lama smiled. He knew better than
to dispute the boy’s strange statement at
this stage.

"All right, fierce kitty,” he said. "Come
over and talk to me.”

Tam walked over and crouched on the
steps near him. They talked long, the
erudite lama skilfully adapting his speech
to the boy’s tiger-like thought processes
and limited vocabulary. And thus there
began a firm friendship that was to last
for many years.

That night the lama slept on the bare
floor of his cell. The following
morning when he awoke, he found
freshly gathered fruit lying beside him,
and a newly killed bird of paradise. He
ate part of the fruit, but the bird he would
not eat raw, and it was forbidden that he
should prepare his own food, so he car-
ried it outside.

Neither Tam nor Leang was in sight,
but Chiam the tiger was lying at the foot
of the temple steps. Lozong tossed the
bird to him. He leaped back with a snarl,
then seized it and carried it off to the
bone-littered space before the pagoda, to
devour it.

Lozong drank at the fountain, let him-
self out at the gate, and with his alms-
bowl tucked in the large breast pocket of
his robe, set off for a near-by village.

He had not gone far when he heard a
rustling in the branches above his head.
Looking up, he beheld Tam. A gibbon
that had evidently been with him scam-
pered off through the branches.

"Where you going?” asked the boy.

"To the village where men live,” re-
plied the lama.

"Don’t go,” said Tam. "They will kill
you with sharp sticks, and eat you.”

"No, they will give me food to eat,”
replied Lozong.
460

WEIRD TALES

Tam followed him as far as the edge
of the jungle, but would go no farther.
When the lama returned, his bowl filled
with curried vegetables and rice, the boy
was waiting for him. They walked
through the jungle together, back to the
temple ruins. As they were passing
through the courtyard, Chiam, the tiger,
came out of the pagoda. At sight of the
lama, Chiam growled menacingly, and
barred his way to the portal.

Lozong paused. This time the white
tigress was not there to defend him.
Chiam advanced, ears laid back, tail lash-
ing the air, voicing his disapproval of the
lama in no uncertain tones.

To Lozong’s surprize, the boy leaped
in front of the tiger. There issued from
his throat a growl that matched, in volume
and ferocity, the voice of the big feline.
For some time, boy and beast growled and
snarled at each other. Then the tiger
sprang.

The lama dropped his begging-bowl
and whipped out his dah, expecting Tam
would be mangled by those terrible teeth
and claws. But the boy leaped lightly to
one side, and before the beast could re-
cover, had flung himself on its back. Grip-
ping the loose skin of its neck and lock-
ing his feet far back beneath the belly,
he hung on like grim death. The tiger
flung itself over backward, rolled over
and over, and tried its best to paw him
off, but to no avail. Fresently the beast
subsided, panting.

Tam laughed, and releasing his hold,
scratched the big feline behind the ear,
making low, purring sounds meanwhile,
which were answered by the tiger.

Then he stood up and returned to where
the astounded lama waited.

"Kitty won’t hurt you, now,” he said.
"I told him you were our friend.”

"But you might have been killed,” ex-
claimed Lozong.

Tam laughed.

"We play like that, often,” he said.
"When I was little and weak, he could
beat me, but now I am big and strong.
Now I win the games. He still has better
teeth and claws, but I am quicker. Some
day when my teeth and claws grow bigger
it will be easier.”

"You will grow bigger some day,
Tam,” said the lama, "but you will never
have big teeth and claws. Men do not
have them. You must stop thinking you
are a kitty, because you are a boy, and
when you grow up you will be a man.”
"I was a boy, once,” replied Tam. "I
remember a little about it.”

"And you are still a boy,” replied
Lozong. "There are many things I must
teach you, which boys and men should
know.” They sat down in the shade, and
there across the alms-bowl began Tam’s
first lesson.

CHAPTER 6

The Gods of Asia

Each day, Lozong made his morning
trip to the near-by village. But
about two weeks after his arrival at the
temple, he returned with a parcel wrapped
in heavy paper. He made a great mystery
of it until he and Tam reached his cell.
Then he unwrapped it ceremoniously.

Tam watched, with wide-eyed curiosity,
as the lama took out several books, pads
of writing-paper, pencils, and a ruler.
"What are they?” he asked.

"I sent for them,” replied Lozong, "in
order that I might teach you to read and
write the language of your people. These
will be the foundation for your education.”
And thus, at the age when most chil-
dren have graduated from grammar
school, Tam made his beginning.

He progressed rapidly, and Lozong
ordered more books and supplies for him
TAM, SON OF THE TIGER

461

from time to time. Each afternoon was
set aside for his studies. His mornings
were usually spent roving in the jungle.
The lama was an excellent instructor be-
cause he made everything interesting, and
Tam’s thirst for knowledge was insatiable.

  Book knowledge was not all that
Lozong taught his pupil. He taught him
jiu jitsu and boxing, and the use of the
dah. At first he let Tam use his knife,
but one day he brought him a bright new
one from the village, with a sheath and
belt. He had previously persuaded Tam
to wear a garment which he had cut for
him from red Lhasa cloth. It was merely
a narrow strip of the material passed over
his left shoulder and wound about his
loins, but quite enough for that climate.

  When Tam had become proficient with
the dah, the lama brought him other
weapons and taught him their use. They
soon accumulated quite an arsenal of
spears, bows and arrows, crossbows and
their shorter projectiles, blowguns and
darts, axes and swords. For hours at a
time they would practise shooting at
marks, hurling spears and knives, and
fencing.

  Lozong’s favorite weapon was the
terrible yatagan, or double-curved sword.
With this, he would fell a tall tree at a
single blow, then instruct his pupil to cut
it up.

  At first, Tam could not more than cut
half through the trunk of a tree felled by
his teacher, but gradually he got the
knack of it.

  "Slic^!” Lozong would cry excitedly,
when Tam, in spite of his powerful
muscles, would end with his blade still
sticking in the wood. "Watch this. Ob-
serve that I do not strike with half the
force you used, yet my blade passes clear
through. Why? Because I turn the
wrist, so, and draw the blade back, so; so
I bring it down. Your wrist should be

of rubber, not of wood. You chop like a
clumsy Chinaman.”

  So Tam would try again and yet again.
But he was sixteen before he could cleave
through a trunk that Lozong had felled
at a single blow, and twenty before he
had become his equal at fence. Mean-
while, his studies had progressed tremen-
dously. He could read and write Tibetan
and Sanskrit as well as English, and had
studied and discussed with Lozong the
sciences and the leading religions of the
world.

  But most of all, he liked to hear Lo-
zong relate his interesting life experiences
—how his people had moved to Hang-
chow from Tibet when he was a boy, and
he had become a Christian and gone to
school at the Ching Nea Way, the Ameri-
can Y. M. C. A. Then how he had gone
to Japan and saved the life of a descend-
ant of the samurai, who had taught him
jiu jitsu and swordsmanship. And then
how he had gone to visit his parents, who
had moved back to Tibet, and while there,
had been left for dead by a company of
Chinese soldiers that had massacred the
entire village, including his parents and
his brothers and sisters. Embittered
against the Chinese, he had turned brig-
and, and soon became leader of the most
dreaded band of marauders in that re-
gion. His fame had spread, and new re-
cruits had flocked to him until he be-
came a military power to be reckoned
with.

  But he grew sick of bloodshed and end-
less campaigns, and at thirty decided to
give up all his possessions and seek sal-
vation by way of the eight-fold path. He
had accordingly taken leave of his follow-
ers and entered a lamasery, but such was
his popularity and piety that in less than
a year he had become its chief lama.

  Still dissatisfied, he left the lamasery in
charge of a subordinate, and set out on a
462

WEIRD TALES

pilgrimage, a seeker after that elusive
entity, Truth. Wandering through Bur-
ma, he had accidentally found the an-
cient ruins, where he had tarried for a
time to meditate and study in solitude,
and near which he had found Leang.

  At twenty, Tam had not only grown
mentally, but had attained to splendid
physical manhood. He was slightly taller
than Lozong, who was six feet without
his sandals, broad-shouldered, narrow-
hipped, and superbly muscled.

  Leang and Chiam had become middle-
aged tigers, and though he still hunted
with them, Tam now employed the wea-
pons Lozong had taught him to use. Like
his preceptor, he came to favor the yata-
gan above all other weapons. With this
he could sever the neck or split the skull
of a charging buffalo at a single stroke.

  Nor had he forgotten his many jungle
friends. These he had cultivated through
the years. But the achievement which had
pleased him most of all was his conquest
of a mighty bull elephant. The great bull,
suffering from that strange temporary
madness called must, had slain his ma-
hout one day when the man had used his
ankus a bit too roughly, and dashed off
into the jungle. He had managed to
elude the men sent after him, and his
wanderings had brought him to Tam’s
hunting-grounds.

  For many days, Tam had watched him,
feeding in the forest or wallowing in the
river, spraying himself with water. From
the first day he carried the ankus which
he had been keeping for just such an oc-
casion. Though he feared no jungle crea-
ture, it was with some trepidation that
Tam went up to the great brute for the
first time carrying a peace offering of fruit.

  The elephant, which had fully recov-
ered from its illness by this time, readily
responded to the commands which Tam
had learned by observing the mahouts,

and he received one of the greatest thrills
of his life when, swung upward on the
trunk of the huge pachyderm, he took his
seat behind the gigantic head and, ankus
in hand, rode off through the forest.

  He said nothing of his conquest to
Lozong, but several days later, when he
and the great brute had become better ac-
quainted, he rode his mighty steed down
the path to meet the lama on his return
from the village.

  Astounded, Lozong looked on while
Tam put the big beast through his paces,
finally causing him to kneel so that the
lama might mount his back. They rode
home in state that night, or nearly so, for
the elephant stopped and refused to budge
when he scented the lair of the tigers. By
much perseverance and the employment
of fruit and balls of sweetened rice, Tam
eventually persuaded him to enter the en-
closure and actually to make friends with
the two tigers. After that, Ganesha, as
they called him, made his headquarters in
the temple enclosure. He was friendly to-
ward Lozong, but showed positive affec-
tion for Tam.

ONE day Ganesha wandered away,
and did not return that night as was
his wont. Worried, Tam set out on his
trail the next morning.

  As usual, Tam carried the weapons
which had made him master of the jungle.
From his belt hung his dah and yatagan.
At his back was his quiver, containing his
powerful bow and a supply of arrows. In
his hand he carried the ankus, his scepter
of authority over the elephant.

  The trail of Ganesha led straight to the
north, and Tam followed it all morning
without pausing. But as the blazing sun
reached the zenith he decided to halt for
rest and refreshment. He had eaten only
a little fruit for breakfast, and his long
tramp had engendered meat hunger. He
turned aside from the trail to hunt.
TAM, SON OF THE TIGER

463

  Traversing a dense thicket of bamboo,
he came out in a flat expanse of tall jungle
grass through which a little brook mean-
dered. Thirsty, he went down to the
stream to drink. He had barely touched
his lips to the purling water when he
heard a movement in the tall grass on the
farther bank. Silently he slid back into
the rushes and drew his yatagan. No
doubt this was some jungle creature com-
ing for a drink. Well, it should supply
the meat he craved. The breeze was
neither in his favor nor against him, but
blowing downstream, so his nose told him
nothing. He must wait for his eyes to re-
veal the quarry.

  As he crouched there in the rushes,
Tam gasped in amazement at sight of the
wondrous creature that emerged from the
waving jungle grass. A slender girl, pant-
ing and swaying as if from exhaustion,
ran out on the bank.

  Her garments were unlike anything he
had ever seen or heard of. On her head
was a tight-fitting golden helmet crowned
with a gold disk above a silver crescent,
set on a uraeus with eyes that were smol-
dering rubies. Wisps of her dark-brown
hair peeped from beneath the magnificent
head-piece, and in her hazel eyes was the
look of one who has just escaped some un-
speakable horror. Her shapely limbs and
torso were encased in light, golden chain
mail, reinforced by sliding shoulder plates,
circular breast plates, and a jointed girdle
with a skirt of taces, and adorned with
glittering jewels set in strange designs.
From her belt of scarlet leather hung a
dagger sheath and sword scabbard, both
empty.

  Fascinated, Tam stared in breathless
wonder and admiration. But the slight
hint of a movement in the tall grass be-
hind the girl drew his jungle-trained eyes.
Something was stalking her! Then he

saw the striped tip of a long tail lashing
above the grass, and he knew!

He leaped up, a cry of warning on his
lips, but at that moment the tiger sprang,
emitting a thunderous roar as it crushed
its victim to the ground.

With an answering roar, Tam leaped
across the brook and confronted the tiger,
his yatagan gleaming in his hand.

Standing over the prostrate girl, the
tiger snarled its anger at this presump-
tuous human who had the temerity to dis-
pute its right to its prey. Then it charged
and reared up to seize its challenger, teeth
gleaming and claws aspread.

With the swiftness of lightning flashed
the razor-sharp yatagan. It caught the rear-
ing tiger squarely between the eyes, and
divided its skull as neatly as a dah divides
an orange, finding lodgment in the neck
vertebras. Like a thing of inflated rub-
ber, the mighty body collapsed.

Tam jerked his blade free and sprang
to die side of the girl.

"Are you badly hurt?” he asked in
English.

She did not understand, but held up
both hands to him, a gesture he could not
fail to comprehend. He dropped his gory
blade and grasping her hands, helped her
to her feet. Despite the weight of her
armor, she seemed light as a feather. And
when she leaned against Tam for support,
the crest of her helmet barely reached to
his shoulder. Tam repeated his query in
Tibetan and Sanskrit. She appeared to
understand the latter language and replied
in a language that was very much like it—
enough to make her speech intelligible to
Tam.

"My armor protected me,” she said,
then added: "I am very thirsty. Let me
drink.”

With his arm around her slender waist,
Tam helped her down the bank, then sup-

A tale of colossal caterpillars that ate their way through London,
spreading disaster and death

1.	The Mysterious Plane

ON THE first of July, 193—, an
officer on night duty at the air
ministry was sitting at his desk
studying an air map of the Channel and
the southern counties of England. The
time was three in the morning and the
presence at such an hour of this officer
and many others who were on duty in the
building was explained by the fact that a
state of political tension existed between
Great Britain and an alliance of European
states. Nothing that indicated war or
even a rupture of diplomatic relations had
been allowed to reach the press, nor was
it in the least probable that any of the
countries concerned would be so criminal
or so foolish as to resort to the last
arbitrament: but the tension was there,
and the government of the day was not
one that would be caught napping.

However peacefully the people might
be sleeping in their beds, those respon-
sible for the defense of the nation were
painfully aware of the possibilities of such
a situation. They knew that in those times
a declaration of war would be followed
by almost instantaneous action. Vast
fleets of aircraft loaded with the deadliest
bombs would be released at once and
would be over the cities of the enemy
almost before he was aware of the fact
that he was to be attacked. And many of
these craft would be of new and secret
kinds: certainly, there would be flights
of pilotless, automatically guided planes,
some timed to drop their bombs on a
given area and return, some simply to
plunge with their load of destruction into
464

the unsuspecting cities to which they were
directed. There was also the possibility
that no actual declaration of war would
be made and that attack would be the first
notification of it. Certainly there would
be no time for the mobilization of exist-
ing forces or the improvization of new
armies and air fleets.

At the first hint of trouble the air
force had been keyed up to the highest
state of readiness; the military and naval
reserves had been recalled to the colors
under the pretext of extensive combined
maneuvers, and the government arsenals
and many privately owned firms were
working at full blast as a measure of un-
employment relief. Such was and is the
complacency of the British public that
these excuses actually passed current as
the truth; and the press was completely
muzzled by a new Official Secret Act
hurriedly rushed through Parliament. The
parochially minded descendants of the
empire builders were absorbed in their
games and more interested in cricket
scores and bathing girls than in the
destiny of Europe. Such is their custom,
encouraged by politicians for their own
ends, but throwing a tremendous respon-
sibility upon those who encourage it.

The officer was studying with partic-
ular interest on the maps before him the
broad lines indicating the many new
arterial roads which converged upon Lon-
don from all parts of the country and he
was reflecting bitterly upon their use as
guides to enemy aircraft. He visualized
how at the moment these long avenues
of light made the finding of the capital

"A rush of air almost lifted him from the
ground.”

mere child’s play to airmen. But he re-
membered, as a compensating factor, that
the existence of similar roads all over the
continent provided equal facilities for the
defending forces.

   It is a matter of history that the great-
est feature of world development in the
decade preceding the date of this account
had been the amazing development of the
use of electricity. It had become so cheap
that it was used for every conceivable
purpose; the towns were as light at night
as they were in the daytime, and every
road of importance was brilliantly illu-
minated from end to end and carried as
much, if not more traffic in what were
once the hours of darkness, as by day.
The civilized world by night was a blaze
of light: golf courses, cricket and football
fields and polo grounds were thronged
with players and watching crowds; only
W. T.—3

in the deep country was the old order of
nature still observed and night fell in
comfortable darkness.

Some curious results of this almost
universal abolition of darkness had been
observed, but they meant nothing to the
mob mind. One was the almost complete
dying out of many species of insectivorous
birds, which naturalists attributed to the
fact that millions of inseas attracted to
the blaze of light dashed themselves to
death against the innumerable lamps,
with the consequence that in the ensuing
year there were no caterpillars to feed
the nestlings. And each successive year,
this phenomenon repeated itself until it
was only in remote districts or in the few
remaining forests that many once-com-
mon birds were to be found at all. The
dearth of birds in turn led to a devas-
tating increase in many kinds of insect

life not affected by light, and England’s
declining agriculture tottered on the edge
of ruin, kept alive only by the frantic
efforts of science to combat by chemical
means the growing plagues. Thus there
was added to the already existing political
troubles of the world, a fear ever present
in the minds of its governors, of a food
shortage. Great Britain was becoming
more and more dependent upon Europe
and America for its food and the causes
that operated against agriculture were
beginning to make themselves felt there
as well. And so in this world of blazing
light there existed a tension which might
have broken at any moment into world-
conflict, though happily it did not.

A telephone bell rang shrilly in the
silent room at the air ministry and
the officer lifted the instrument beside
him. Manston Air Station was speaking,
and speaking with subdued excitement.

  "Two unidentifiable planes of large
size have just passed over here. They are
quite an unknown type, so far as could
be observed, and they seemed to keep out
of range of the searchlights—came from
southwest and flew round, and then
headed along the coast toward Birching-
ton and Herne Bay. I’ve warned all sta-
tions to be on the lookout and sent two
scouts up in pursuit.”

  "Very good,” said the officer, calmly.
"Hold on for a moment.”

  He summoned another officer and gave
certain emergency instructions for the
defense of London. Satisfied that wires
and wireless were busy, he turned to the
telephone again.

  "Manston. Right; now, can you
describe these planes?”

  "Like nothing I’ve ever seen, sir,”
began the voice at the other end. "Some-
thing new and devilish by the look of
them. I’d only a glimpse as they dodged

the lights. It’s difficult to give a co-
herent account, the impression they made
on us was so queer.”

  “All right, Manston—take it slowly,
then,” said the officer.

  “Wing expanse about a hundred feet,
at least, I’d say—absolutely silent engine
—caught a queer swishing sound now
and then as if they were gliding. But the
damned thing was the action of the
wings.”

  "Action of the wings? What do you
mean?”

  "Well, sir, they came planing down
till they saw us and then the wings
seemed to give a flap and the thing shot
away at a terrific speed.”

  "Movable wings, eh? Bird flight—•
what we’ve been trying for ourselves
•—wish we could bring one down! Go
on—how many propellers and engines?”
"None, sir—that is, no propellers as
far as we could see—action of the wings
only—unless there’s a propeller in the
tail. No visible engines.”

  Another officer came into the room and
laid a typed slip on the table. It indicated
that the London air defense was fully
mobilized and in the air. The first officer
nodded and the other handed him a sec-
ond slip which read:

  Two unknown planes passed over Southend
heading London. No identification marks, un-
known class, moving fast.

  "Well, they’ll be stopped,” was his
comment.

  "Easy thing, sir, if there are no more,”
said his junior, as he went out. The con-
versation with Manston was resumed.
"What lights did they carry?”

  "None, sir—that’s to say, not exactly
lights.”

  "What do you mean, exactly?”

  "Well, on either side of the nose there
seemed to be a big sort of window
divided into sort of honeycomb panes—
observation posts, I’d say. I think they
MOTH

467

had lights inside—at least when the
searchlight hit them you could see those
two windows or whatever they were all
lit up and glowing red. Big things, some-
thing like a searchlight disk, if you follow
me, only practically no light seemed to
come out of them—when they passed out
of the light, you could just see them
glowing like windows. Sounds crazy, sir,
but we all saw them and there’s no mis-
take.”

  "I’m not thinking there is any mistake,
Travers,” said the officer gravely. "We
know that Extrania has had a secret plane
up its sleeve for some time. Mind you,
this may only be a practise spin by some
of their pilots—it doesn’t follow that
they’re out for mischief. Still, if they
come over London, they know that they’ll
be shot down, and that’s their lookout.
Report anything fresh at once.”

  "Did I say anything about the color,
sir?”

  "No—I ought to have asked you that
—it’s very important.”

  "Sort of silvery gray, sir, so far as we
tould make out, with curious markings on
the underside of the wings. The fuselage
seemed a bit darker—but at night it was
difficult to tell. It was very good camou-
flage, anyhow.”

  "Thank you, Travers. Let me have
your scouts’ report at once, won’t you?”
"Right, sir.”

The officer hung up the receiver and
began to make notes. After a time
he rose and going to the window, flung
it open. It was still dark and all the lights
of London had been cut off on the first
alarm. The air was full of the droning
of planes which were circling in squad-
rons over the city. From the outer de-
fenses, long pencils of light roved inces-
santly over the sky, and from the streets
below the building rose a murmur of

voices and the shuffle of many feet. All
London was in the streets by this time,
attracted by the noise overhead and the
sudden darkness. Wild rumors were
already flying about, and to prevent panic,
the police were announcing that it was
only a special test of the air defense
forces.

  The door of the room was flung open
suddenly and a tall gray-haired man
wrapped in a fur coat strode in. The offi-
cer swung round and after a glance at
his visitor, saluted.

  "Tell me what is all this, Langton,”
asked the Prime Minister, without cere-
mony. "Are we actually attacked?”

  "I hope not, sir,” was the reply. "But
two mysterious planes of large size and
strange design came in over the Kent
coast and are reported heading for Lon-
don without lights. You see, we are
ready, sir.”

  "Yes, I see that,” replied Mr. Perceval.
"It’s all admirable, if a civilian may say
so. But I can scarcely contemplate the
possibility of attack from Extrania with-
out a declaration of war, and we’re far
from that stage.”

  "Quite, sir—but you never know. The
first blow wins the next war, they say.
Anyhow, all we’ve done is to put plan A
in operation, according to the standing
orders.”

  "If they reach London or try to reach
it, what do you do?” asked Mr. Perceval.

  "Shoot ’em down, sir. Acting against
the international code in that fashion
could only mean war on their part. I
rather hope we do get them down, sir—
they seem to be something quite new in
design.”

  "Very well,” said the Prime Minister.
"I’ll go back to Downing Street and I’d
better look in at the Palace. You’ll keep
me posted?”
468

WEIRD TALES

  "Of course, sir. Can you find your
way? I mustn’t leave this telephone.”

  The Prime Minister departed as quick-
ly as he had come and the officer resumed
his vigil at the window. But nothing hap-
pened, save that the crowds in the street
grew in numbers and the planes con-
tinued to drone through the sky. Dawn
began to break at last but no further
news of the raiders came through. Re-
ports poured in from air stations all over
the country, all to the same effect: that
nothing had been seen or heard of the
raiders. The people, quieted by the police
statements, began to straggle home to
their beds; the light grew, and the
London sparrows began their cheerful
twittering. Save for a few scouts, the
defending planes were ordered back to
their respective stations and what seemed
like a normal day began in the streets.

The officer stretched himself and
yawned. He was very tired and his
relief would soon take over. But he was
not quite easy in his mind about what
was to come, although the consensus of
official opinion was that two foreign
pilots trying out a new machine had ven-
tured over England in the dark and made
for home when they saw they were dis-
covered. Somehow, Langton did not feel
that it was just like that.

  The telephone bell rang shrilly at his
elbow.

  "Hillow. Yes, this is Langton speak-
ing. Wants to speak to me personally—
who d’ye say? A Colonel Butler?—don’t
know him. Well, if it’s urgent, put him
through.”

  A voice boomed in his ear.

  "Is that Air.Commodore Langton?”

  "It is.”

  "My name’s Butler—Colonel, late
Loamshires, on the Retired List. I have a

son in the air force, so I knew that you
were in charge at the ministry.”

  "Well—what do you want, sir?”

  "Give me time, sir. I live at Epping—
house is fairly high up and commands a
view of most of the forest.”

  "Yes,” said Langton, with new interest.
"Heard all that row this morning—
planes woke me. Looking out of my
window, I thought I saw something big
in the sky with no lights. And I thought
it seemed to come down in the forest.”
"The devil you did! What did you do?”
"Nothing—might have been mere
fancy and how could you start up to
search the forest in the dark? However,
first thing this morning, I saddled up and
rode round a bit. Just where I thought it
might be, there’s a big plane lying on the
ground.”

  "Smashed—hit the trees?”

  "No—seems all right, but it’s the
weirdest kind of machine I’ve ever seen.
I didn’t wait to examine it—just rode
back hell for leather to phone you. I
thought you wouldn’t want people nosing
about—might want it kept secret. All
last night’s row wasn’t for nothing, no
matter what the police say.”

  "Is it possible for it to take off from
there?”

  "No, fills the available space complete-
ly, I should say.”

  "Colonel, you’ve done splendidly—it’s
a mercy there was an experienced soldier
on the spot. Don’t let a word get about
—I’ll be with you as fast as a car can take
me. Is it likely to be seen by any one?”
"No—it’s in a lonely glade where very
few people ever go—no one at this hour
or season, anyhow. Best come straight to
my house—Wintram Hall—and I’ll take
you with me.”

  "Right! Many thanks, sir.”

  Langton was soon on the road. His
fast car was followed by an Air Force
MOTH

469

lorry filled with fully armed men, whose
job was to deal with any show of resist-
ance on the part of the crew of the fallen
plane. He had chosen to travel by car
because it would bring him right to
Colonel Butler’s house and would attract
less attention than a plane, and he was
above all anxious to preserve complete
secrecy both for technical and diplomatic
reasons. The air ministry had no desire
that enterprising journalists should make
public the design of the secret Extranian
plane and if the theory that Extranian
pilots had been flying over London at
night proved correct, public indignation,
were the fact known, might make it very
difficult for the government to preserve
the atmosphere of diplomatic good-will so
necessary for the handling of the present
crisis.

IT was still comparatively early and the
roads were fairly clear of traffic; in
little over half an hour, Langton’s car
turned in at the entrance gates of Win-
tram Hall. Under the portico of the old
Georgian house, a gray-haired soldierly
figure was awaiting him. Near by, a
groom held two saddled horses.

  As Langton jumped from the car, the
Colonel came down the steps to meet him.

  ."Colonel Butler?”

  "Yes. I expect you’re in a hurry to see
this thing. You ride?”

  Langton nodded, and as they were
mounting, the Colonel explained that this
was their quickest method of approach-
ing the fallen machine. They left the
grounds of the Hall, crossed the road,
and were soon riding down narrow paths
between the trees where it was frequently
necessary to crouch in the saddle to avoid
overhanging branches. They had the for-
est to themselves: occasionally a rabbit
scurried across the path or a deer raised
a timid head from the green bracken;

small birds twittered in the thickets and
blackbirds whistled mellowly now and
then, but the full chorus of song was
over for the year. The sun burned strong
in the open spaces; the peace and quiet of
the whole scene struck Langton as in
strange contrast to his errand. There was
something ironical in the complete in-
difference of nature to the presence of the
instrument of death and destruction
which had fallen into this quiet forest.
Langton was listening to the crooning of
a dove hidden in the green boughs above
him, when the Colonel checked his horse
and made a sign to him to come along-
side.

  They had arrived on the edge of an
open glade about fifty yards across. It
was surrounded on all sides by tall beech-
es and oaks, whose height formed a bar-
rier that no ordinary plane could sur-
mount without a much longer take-off.
And in the center of this space, seeming
to occupy most of it, lay the most extraor-
dinary machine that Langton had ever
seen.

  The wings extended almost from side
to side of the glade, and what struck
Langton’s expert eyes at once was the
fart that this was neither a biplane nor a
monoplane but something of both. It had
two planes on either side of the body,
but instead of being superimposed, the
lower plane was practically on a level
with the upper, behind which it extended
fanwise. The confused metaphor that
rose in Langton’s mind was a four-
winged monoplane. Between the wings,
the fuselage lay long and tapering, a
glistening silver-gray. It was wholly en-
closed; no windows were visible and the
pilot’s quarters were apparently com-
pletely built in. The under-carriage was
not visible, being completely covered by
the downward spread of the four enor-
mous wings. On the nose of the machine,
470

WEIRD TALES

Langton could see, on the near side, one
of those large globular disks which the
officer at Manston had described as win-
dows: they seemed to be constructed of a
cellular framework of metal with panes
of some glassy material; but no light
came from them. Near these protuber-
ances were a number of complicated,
pipe-like affairs, the use of which it was
impossible to guess; and in front of them
emerged two long tube-like appliances
which were folded back toward the
wings.

There was no sign of life or movement
about the machine, which lay apparently
as it had lighted.

"What d’ye make of it?” asked Colonel
Butler, at last.

/'The new Extranian hush-hush plane,
I think,” said Langton, trying to put his
horse toward it. But both of the horses
were strangely restive and kept backing
into the shelter of the trees.

"I shouldn’t go too near all at once,”
warned the Colonel. "Where’s the crew?
Training machine-guns on us, maybe.”

"No crew there,” said Langton. "You
see all that stuff in the nose of the thing
-—those long feelers and so on? That ex-
plains it—it’s one of those automatic
planes, controlled by wireless. It may be
stuffed full of gas or high explosive, of
course, but there’s nothing human in it.
Let us have a look.”

They dismounted and walked across
the still-dewy grass, and as they did so,
the huge size of the thing before them
became apparent. The fuselage towered
above them like a house, the expanse of
wing seemed colossal.

"Damn it, you’d almost say it was
hairy,” said the Colonel, as he peered up
at the enormous body.

"That’s all part of the wireless gadget,”
said Langton. "We’ll soon get the secret

of that. How do we get into the thing,
though?”

  "You’d want a ladder.”

  Langton turned from his scrutiny of
the body and approached the edge of the
hinder plane. He could not guess at the
construction of the wide, laminated sur-
face, the edge of which was fringed with
spikes set closely together.

  "You’d better wait where you are,
Colonel,” he said, as he stepped carefully
on to the wing. "Just in case anything
happens.”

  He began walking over the plane: the
surface was hard and slippery under his
feet; here and there he could detect a
vein-like structure, presumably of light
metal girder-work, which kept the wing
rigid. It was when he put his foot on one
of these concealed girders that a strange
thing happened. A tremor seemed to go
through the entire machine. Langton was
puzzled for a moment; then the explana-
tion seemed to be that the under-carriage
had been damaged in landing and that his
weight had upset the precarious balance
of the machine. He went on and reached
the forward plane, pausing to notice how
the rear plane fitted under the front one
so closely that they were almost in touch.
It looked as if one could be slid under
the other, and this structure puzzled him.
But there would be plenty of time to go
into that: he walked on till he came to the
junction of the planes with the body.
Here the body rose in a dome-like struc-
ture that offered no opening and seemed
impossible to climb: the dome was cov-
ered with interlacing work of some kind
that looked like metal feathers, which
presented a smooth gray surface of the
same color as the wings he had crossed.

  He felt this surface with his hands: to
his surprize it was strangely soft and
yielding. He dug his fingers into it.

  Again a strange tremor ran through
MOTH

471

the entire structure, but this time some-
thing further happened. The two long
feelers that had been folded over the
wings suddenly shot forward and waved
to and fro in the air with a loud swish-
ing sound. Then something started in the
under-carriage: the whole body shot up
several feet from the ground; a strange
pulsating movement began in the wings
that nearly jerked Langton off his feet.
And for the first time in his life, he was
seized with panic, a wild, unreasoning
panic that made him run for the edge of
the wing he was on; a horrible notion
that this thing was alive filled his mind.

  He ran for his life, but just as he
reached the edge of the wing and was
about to jump to the solid ground, the
wings with a mighty motion shot upward
over the top of the fuselage. For a mo-
ment, as he fell headlong through the
flexible spikes that fringed the wing he
thought that he had set in action some
mechanism for exploding a cargo of
destruction. But no explosion followed:
only as he lay face downward in the long
grass, a rush of air almost lifted him from
the ground; he could hear the branches
near him, swaying in the gust of it. Then
all was silent. He rolled over—the glade
was empty and only the crushed grass and
the figure of Colonel Butler, standing
with his head craned backward, remained
as evidence that the plane had ever been
there.

  He scrambled to his feet and followed
the Colonel’s gaze skyward. Far up in
the blue, the great silver shape was rapid-
ly lessening as it rose and circled over the
forest, higher and higher, till it became
indistinguishable. Even in the depths of
his amazement, Langton’s professional
eye noted instantly the peculiar bird-like
action of the wings, which rose and fell
in long beats or trembled like a hovering
hawk’s. In what seemed a few moments,

it was out of sight: the peace and silence
of the green forest were as if they had
never been disturbed.

Iangton hobbled over to the Colonel
and stared at him. The Colonel re-
turned the stare; then both of them turned
to where the terrified horses were tethered
to trees.

  "Better come back with me and have a
drink,” said the Colonel. "You took a
nasty toss.”

  In silence they mounted and rode back
to Wintram Hall, lost in speculation that
neither liked to put into words.

  "Do you want to do anything immedi-
ate about this?” asked the Colonel, as
they dismounted. "Report, I mean to say,
or anything like that before lunch?”

  He avoided Langton’s eye as he spoke,
but Langton understood.

  "Only to send my men back to Lon-
don,” he said. "I’ll be glad to have lunch
here, if it’s convenient.”

  The Colonel went into the house to
give his instructions and Langton inter-
viewed the men who stood grouped
round a service lorry on the drive. It was
with a certain sense of relief that he heard
that nobody had seen anything of a
strange plane. He explained that their
services would not be required any longer
and having dismissed them, entered the
house. He found the Colonel pacing up
and down the hall. As soon as Langton
had removed the traces of his fall, they
sat down to lunch in an oak-panelled
dining-room.

  While the servants were in the room,
they talked of other things, but the Colo-
nel was preoccupied in manner and
always seemed on the verge of saying
something which he did not say.

  "I’ve served in India a lot,” he came
out once, "and in West Africa. Funny
472

things happen there—things you wouldn’t
believe if I told them.”

  "So I’ve heard,” said Langton.

  "And that’s one reason,” went on the
Colonel, "why I don’t believe that any-
thing’s impossible.”

  The butler had gone out of the room.
Langton looked straight at his host.

  "You mean,” he said, slowly, "you
mean that the thing was alive?”

  The Colonel nodded.

  "You couldn’t see what I did. When
you dug your fist into it—damn it, it
stood up! Stood up, sir, on legs! Three
on each side—I counted them. Six legs—
you know what that is?”

  "It might be a mechanical device of
some kind,” suggested Langton, uncer-
tainly.

  "No, sir!” said the Colonel, fiercely,
leaning forward as he spoke. "It was an
infernal great moth—that’s what it was.
I’ll show you, presently. I collect ’em in
the forest here, since I retired. I’m sup-
posed to be a bit of a dab at entomology
and I know.”

  "But,” stammered Langton, "admit-
ting it was alive, how do you account for
the coldness of everything I touched—
seemed ice-cold.”

"Inseas have no blood like ours—they
have a circulating fluid but it’s cold. It
would be cold—that’s another proof.”
"Then, how am I to report a thing like
that?” demanded Langton, unhappily.

"You can’t,” said the Colonel. "You
can’t. They wouldn’t believe you—you’d
be up before a medical board before
they’d got to the end of your report.”
"What am I to do, then?”

  "If you’re finished,” said the Colonel,
"come into my study and I’ll show you
something. Keep my collection there.”
He led the way across the hall into a
room lined with cabinets and bookcases.
From one of the cabinets he took a drawer

and carried it over to a table under the
window.

  "Genus Eupithecia,” he said. "We call
’em Pug moths in England.”

  Langton found himself gazing down
on a neatly arranged collection of tiny
models of the mysterious plane. The
resemblance was exact, shape, attitude,
angle of the outspread wings, and in
some, nearly the color: the eyes which he
had taken for windows, the long antennae,
the tapering body on six legs.

  "Couldn’t it be that some genius had
succeeded in discovering the secret of a
moth’s flight and in making a big scale
model?” he asked, presently.

  "Can a man imitate the works of God
so closely, d’ye think?” asked the Colo-
nel, solemnly.

  "But these are so tiny—that was a
monstrous thing,” objected Langton. "No
creature of that size could live on this
earth without being discovered.”

  "The inference is they’ve just arrived
on this earth,” said Colonel Butler, grim-
ly. "It’s a bad lookout for us, if they
have. D’ye realize what sort of monster
the caterpillar of that thing would be, eh?
You know those caterpillars we call loop-
ers—kind that grips with its forelegs—
that’s its real legs, of course—and pulls
its long body up into a loop, takes hold
with the claspers on its tail and then
reaches out again. You remember—they
seem to take huge strides.”

  Langton nodded.

  “I know them. What size would the
caterpillar of that be?”

  "About seventy-five feet long, prob-
ably, when it was full-grown. It would
have jaws that could crush anything softer
than iron—maybe iron. I doubt if a
machine-gun bullet could pierce its skin.”
Langton threw out his arms, despair-
ingly.

  "We're dreaming,” he said. "Where
could they come from?”

  "I don’t know,” said the Colonel,
gloomily. "But they’ve come. Light at-
tracts them—these little beggars come to
street lamps. Well, the world’s a blaze
of light, now, in this age of electricity
they’re always boasting about.”

  "You mean they might have been at-
tracted from some other planet that has
monstrous forms of life? But that’s not
credible—surely all the electric light in
the world going at full blast wouldn’t be
noticed there?”

  "We don’t know what sort of sight
they may have in Mars or any of the
others,” said the Colonel. "And we don’t
know what the flying range of such
things would be. Suppose they are flying
about in the upper air, of which we know
damn little—they see all this glow at
night—down they come. Impossible, it
may sound—but it’s feasible. Anyway,
have you any better explanation?”

  "No,” said Langton, "I haven’t. I
wish this discovery had fallen to some one
else, Colonel, because I’m going to be
broken over it.”

  "You mean you’re going to report
what you saw?” asked the Colonel.

  "It’s my duty. There’s a fearful dan-
ger in this thing, if such creatures get a
footing on the earth—I can see that.”
"There is,” said the Colonel. "Imagine
a batch of eggs—hundreds, maybe—
hatching out and a horde of caterpillars
like that eating up the country. They
might eat human beings—they might eat
anything—wood, houses, anything. On
the other hand they might die for lack of
their proper food.”

  "Still, I’ve got to report,” said Lang-
ton. "And if you’ll excuse me, I’ll get
back to the ministry and make my report.
They won’t believe it, but it’s up to me.”

The Colonel Held out his hand and
gripped Langtori’s warmly.

"Look here, my boy,” he said, gruffly,
"if—if any trouble comes out of it for
you, rely on me in any way you think fit.
You can use my name, of course, but it
won’t carry you far—I’m looked upon as
an eccentric down here already because I
collect bugs. But what I mean is—if they
—if they retire you, or anything like that
—come down here and stop with me for
a bit. We might think out something to
do about this—it may be a very real dan-
ger, you know.”

"If things turn out as they probably
will, Colonel,” said Langton, gratefully,
"I shall certainly come. I’m a bachelor
and have no family ties, so there’s noth-
ing to hinder me, unless they lock me in
an asylum. And I want to go into this
thing with some one who knows it all.”
Colonel Butler stood for some time
gazing after the receding car, and as he
turned to go indoors he was speaking to
himself.

"Damned fine chap,” he said. "They’ll
certify him when he comes out with that
story—sure thing.”

A few weeks later, he read in the Lon-
don Gazette that Air Commodore Lang-
ton had been invalided out of the service.

2.	The Egg

Colonel butler had been surprized
and relieved at not being called to
give evidence in the official inquiry which
he knew had been held into his friend’s
sanity. He guessed that Langton had kept
his name out of it as far as possible, also
that the authorities had not desired to
widen their inquiry beyond what was
strictly necessary—if it leaked out that
the officer who had been in charge of the
London defenses on that night of public
excitement had been found to be insane,
474

WEIRD TALES

there would have been an outcry which
would have imperilled the positions of
many important people. He understood,
therefore, well enough why he had not
been called upon, but he was anxious
about the fate of the man for whom he
had formed an instinctive liking. If he
had not volunteered any corroboration of
Langton’s fantastic report it was because
he had no desire to be certified himself
and because he foresaw possible con-
sequences of the visit of the giant moth:
if the peril he feared materialized, there
would be at least one man at liberty who
understood its cause and could suggest
how to deal with it. And he had grave
reasons for believing that it might mate-
rialize. Nevertheless he was on the point
of setting out for London to make in-
quiries about his friend when he was
saved the trouble by a visit from a high
medical officer of the air service.

  That officer’s arrival happened to coin-
cide with the return of the Colonel from
a collecting expedition in the forest; they
met outside the Colonel’s door, as the offi-
cer was stepping from his car and Colo-
nel Butler, with a collecting-box hung
from his shoulder and a net in one hand,
was mounting the steps. The officer
introduced himself and indicated that his
visit was connected with Langton’s affair.
He glanced at the Colonel’s paraphernalia.

  "And I think,” he added, "if you will
forgive me, that I see something that sug-
gests the origin of your friend’s un-
fortunate delusion.”

  "You mean this?” asked the Colonel,
flourishing his net, as he led the way to
his study. "Well, I know that the ig-
norant commonly regard entomologists as
eccentric or even potty, as they express it
—but I didn’t expea to find a medical
officer sharing that delusion, sir.”

  The officer flushed and laughed, as he

took the chair that the Colonel had in-
dicated.

"I’m far from it, I assure you,” he de-
clared. "As a matter of fact, I’ve dabbled
a bit in entomology when I was on for-
eign service—you’ll find a collection of
Mesopotamian moths at South Kensing-
ton made by me.”

"I’m glad to hear it,” said the Colonel,
with a slight increase of cordiality,
"because in that case you’ll perhaps ap-
preciate the proof I propose to show you
of Langton’s complete sanity. Where is
he now?”

"He is in hospital, under observation
at present, and as for his sanity, that ap-
pears to be unimpeachable except for this
extraordinary delusion that he saw a gi-
gantic moth in the forest here. You can
imagine the effect of such a story on the
authorities. And I don’t blame them for
being inclined to have him certified, for
delusion insanity is a terribly dangerous
thing. You never know what the next
fixed idea may be. The Harley Street men
we called in said he already showed signs
of the persecution mania.”

The Colonel laughed.

"I should say he did,” was his com-
ment. "If you were locked up for report-
ing truthfully a thing you’d seen, I fancy
you would show signs of it yourself.”
"But, Colonel—surely you don’t sug-
gest-”

"What are you going to do with him?”
interrupted the Colonel.

"Well,” said his visitor, failing to con-
ceal his embarrassment at the Colonel’s
attitude, "that’s what has brought me
here. He asks us to allow him to come to
you and says that you are willing to look
after him. Personally, I’d be inclined to
advise that, if you are willing to accept
the responsibility. We could run down
here and have a look at him, now and
then. It seems an extreme step to send
MOTH

475

an officer of his standing and record to an
asylum.”

  "I’m perfectly willing to have him—
only too glad,” said the Colonel.

  "You realize the responsibility—the
possible danger?”

  "Perfectly. I realize other things, too,
sir. One is the danger to the country if

I	don’t get him here; another is, that you
think me as mad as Langton. Well, come
and look at this, will you?”

  The medical officer followed the Colo-
nel to a table which stood in the bay of
one of the windows. On the table, en-
closed in a rough cage of stout wire stood
a most remarkable-looking object. At the
first glance, the visitor took it for some
rare vase which his eccentric host had
caged in to prevent theft or breakage.
Indeed, it resembled nothing so much as
a vase without handles. It was about
eighteen inches high and perhaps a foot
in diameter at its widest point: a rough
description of the shape would be that
of a Ruby football set on end. The beauty
of it was remarkable: it seemed to be
composed of some rare pinkish marble,
richly and curiously carved with geo-
metrical designs which were repeated over
the entire surface with faultless pre-
cision. The top was closed, and if it had
an opening anywhere, it was concealed.

  The visitor stared at this object with
mixed feelings of admiration for its
beauty and bewilderment at the Colonel’s
conduct in connecting it with Langton.
What could be the connection between
this work of art and that officer’s sanity?
"What is it?” demanded the Colonel.
"A rare vase of Some kind, I suppose
—and a remarkably beautiful thing,
Colonel.”

  The Colonel frowned.

  "I thought you were an entomologist,
Sir,” he said. "Please look again, and

look carefully this time. Doesn’t it recall
anything to your mind?”

The medical officer drew a chair up to
the table, and sitting down, began to
examine the object intently. He turned
the wire cage this way and that, scru-
tinized the surface with care, lifted it and
weighed it in his hands, while the Colonel
looked on. Finally he replaced it, and
pushing back his chair, turned to his host.

"I think I see what you mean,” he said.
"It might be a very much enlarged model
of the egg of some lepidopterous insea.”
The Colonel nodded.

"Right,” he said. "Only, it isn’t a
model. It is an egg and I’m keeping it
in that wire cage till it hatches. I don’t
want a larva of that size loose in the'
house.”

"But it’s impossible.”

"You may think so. Will it alter your
idea if I tell you that I was with Langton
when he saw the moth? In faa, I dis-
covered it and mistook it for some new
kind of plane that had fallen in the for-
est. I telephoned to him because I
thought they’d want it kept secret—he
came down, and what he told you in his
report, we saw together.”

His visitor was looking at him with
frank incredulity. But the Colonel went
on, unabashed.

"When it came to me that the thing
was alive, I made a rough guess that it
corresponded roughly to our genus
Eupithecia. And as the antennae were
not ciliated, the inference was that it was
a female—the bulky body also suggested
that. So while you were looking him up,

I	made a search of the glade where it
alighted. In the long grass, I found that.
And there you are!”

The officer began to look very uncom-
fortable: he got up and crossed to the
fireplace.

"But how—supposing that we accept
476

WEIRD TALES

that you did see it—how did it get here
—where did it come from?”

  "I expea Langton explained our theory
in his report.”

  "He did—and that seemed the maddest
part of it. Something about the country
being so brilliantly lit up at night and at-
tracting these things from some planet or
from the upper air.”

  “Well, you’re a praaical entomologist
—think it out and see if it doesn’t fit in.”
There was silence for some moments.
Then the officer moved uneasily.

  "The funny thing about it is,” he said,
"that the night after, a man was run in
for being drunk and disorderly. He said
to the magistrate next day that he had
seen an enormous thing like a plane fall-
ing on the roof of Mondaine Mansions,
that big block in Park Lane. He got
fourteen days.”

  "Anything else you know?” asked the
Colonel with interest.

  "I don’t know,” said the officer. "Could
this have any bearing on it? The Cap-
tain of the Fanteric, the big liner, re-
ported that he ran into some big floating
objea in the channel a day or two later
which he thought must have been a dead
whale—only the lookout man said that
the sea on either side of it seemed to be
held down by two wing-shaped patches
of oil. Anyway it was cut up by the bows
of the ship and apparently sank. But they
found traces of some glutinous substance
on the plates of the ship that certainly
wasn’t the blood of a whale. Mystery of
the sea, the papers called it.”

  "That might account for one of them,”
said the Colonel. "I must make inquiries.
But the other—if there were only two—
where is it?”

  “Look here,” said the officer, with a
gesture of perplexity, "you can’t expea
me to go back to Kingsway and father
this story. Nobody would—not even if

you produced that egg to the Royal
Society. If nothing comes of it, they
would all be branded as lunatics.”

  "But something may come of it,” said
the Colonel. "Suppose they’ve been scat-
tering eggs all over the place? These
larvae would be fairly formidable things,
what?”

  "I’ll do this,” said his visitor, after a
pause; "I’ll send Langton down here, dis-
charged as cured, and you and he can work
on it. If there are any developments, I’ll
count on you to let me know at once.
Langton ought to be reinstated immedi-
ately, but till there’s some convincing
proof, you can see how impossible that
is.”

  "Well,” said the Colonel, "that’s the
best thing you can do, I’ve no doubt.
But meantime I have drawn up a full re-
port of the whole thing. I sent it to the
Prime Minister last night—it was my
duty to the nation and to Langton. How
he’ll take it, of course, I don’t know.”

  "But you can guess,” said the other.
"Very well—we’ll leave it like that, Colo-
nel. If the P. M. knows, it’s out of my
hands and that’s a comfort. Langton will
be sent down to you today. He’ll be a bit
under the weather anyhow after the
ordeal he’s been through—you’d better
feed him up and let him rest a bit.”

ON that understanding they parted.
That evening, a car brought Lang-
ton to Wintram Hall. He was pale and
obviously suffering from strain, and the
Colonel packed him off to bed, refusing
to discuss anything till he had eaten a
good meal and had a sound sleep. It
was noon of the following day before he
came downstairs; but his host noted with
delight that he looked almost as well and
alert as on the occasion of his first visit.

  The long discussions that followed
served little purpose but to make clear to
MOTH

477

the two men the nature of the dilemma
in which they were involved. It seemed
impossible to do anything further in a
public manner—the fate that had over-
taken Langton in consequence of his re-
port was sufficient proof of that: and
until they were made aware of the man-
ner in which the Prime Minister was
going to treat the Colonel’s communica-
tion, any other move was worse than use-
less. Then there had been no further
reports of the presence of the strange vis-
itors: they might still be hidden some-
where or they might have returned to the
regions from which they came, although
the Colonel’s investigations in the affair
of the Fanteric revealed the fact that a
quantity of strange bony framework had
been washed ashore in Sussex and that a
mysterious scum had appeared on the sea
in the same neighborhood, mixed with
entrail-like fragments. This suggested
that one of the wanderers, perhaps ex-
hausted by the lack of some natural el-
ement required for its sustenance, had
fallen exhausted into the sea and been
destroyed by the ship. But that was only
a likely speculation, and what had
become of the other? That, they never
knew: either it perished unseen or re-
turned to its native element.

  If the creatures had died or left the
earth, the remaining danger was that ovae
had been deposited during their visit, and
might eventually hatch out larvae whose
size and destructiveness would be a ter-
rible danger to mankind. That one egg
had been left behind, they had proof—
it reposed in the Colonel’s study. A wide
search of the neighborhood had revealed
no others and there might be no others.
But the probability was that they had dis-
turbed the moth at the beginning of its
operations and that it had completed them
elsewhere, in which case hundreds of
these eggs must be in existence. That

could only be found out when the time
for the emergence of the larvae arrived;
and that they hoped to learn from the
solitary specimen they had.

  There was in the meantime, therefore,
nothing for them to do but think out pos-
sible plans of destroying the brood when
it hatched and was discovered; but a few
comparative experiments with living in-
seas made it plain that caterpillars of
such a size would possess enormous
strength and that their skins would prob-
ably be tough enough to turn any bullet
aside.

  How was such a danger to be dealt
with? It was to this problem that the two
friends turned their attention in the weeks
that followed and without any assurance
of success.

  About a fortnight after Langton’s re-
turn to Wintram Hall, they received a
visit from the medical officer who had
previously consulted Colonel Butler about
his friend. Nothing beyond a brief offi-
cial acknowledgment had resulted from
the Colonel’s letter to the Prime Min-
ister and he had been forced to the con-
clusion that he was regarded as one of
those harmless lunatics who pester the
great with their effusions. He and Lang-
ton were in the study when the visitor
was shown in, and the Colonel’s welcome
was not any too cordial.

  "You don’t mean to tell me that
they’ve sent you down to inspect Langton,
after all?” he growled.

  "You’ll still find me suffering as bad-
ly as ever from the same delusion,” Lang-
ton added, before the other could reply.

  "Sorry about all that, you know, Lang-
ton,” said the officer, patiently, "but as
things were, it couldn’t be helped. No,
sir,” he went on, turning to the Colonel,
"it is not about that—it’s about your let-
ter to the Prime Minister.”

  The Colonel sat up.
478

WEIRD TALES

  "Yes, sir, the P. M., naturally enough,
turned it over to the air ministry. The
fat was in the fire, as you can guess.
They could not very well ask the P. M. to
believe that Langton, and you and my-
self, for of course I told them what I’d
seen, were all mad. There was the devil
to pay—the P. M. called for a full report
of the whole affair, said he had talked
to Langton that morning and found him
perfectly sane. He threatened to retire all
sorts of important bugs and gave every
one a dressing down. The upshot is that
he has appointed a sort of committee of
scientific big-wigs to consider the possi-
bilities. So far all they’ve done is to say
it’s impossible. But the P. M. says every-
thing is possible till the contrary is
proved—and I’m here as the forerunner
of the committee and the P. M. himself.
They want to see the egg.”

  Instinctively the gaze of the three men
turned to the object on the table in the
window. But something had happened to
it. From a hole near the top of it, a
shining, horny head, armed with com-
plicated and formidable jaws, projected,
emerging farther at every moment. They
rushed to the table and watched with a
horrible fascination the long, eel-like body
pushing itself forth, till finally the thing,
grasping the broken edge of the shell
with its hind claspers, was fully born.

  The young caterpillar they saw sur-
passed so greatly in size anything of the
kind ever seen by men that it seemed like
the creature of a nightmare. Its body,
about two feet in length, projected stiffly
from the tail claspers by which it held on
to the egg, at an angle of about forty-five
degrees: it was a dark-reddish color, with
a rough, horny skin on which the rows
of breathing-follicles were clearly visible,
and looked like nothing so much as a
branch of a tree.

  "What is it?” demanded the medical
officer at last.

  "Might be a gigantic variant of the
genus Eupithecia, going by the old classi-
fication,” said the Colonel. "In faa, it
might be a huge subumbrata—the color-
ing of the parent and of this caterpillar
distinaly suggest subumbrata. Curiously
enough, the glade between beechwoods
in which we saw the thing is just exaaly
where you might find our tiny Eupithecia
subumbrata. But to a thing of that size,
our beech trees would look like seed-
lings.”

  "He’s going to move!” shouted Lang-
ton. As he spoke, the creature began to
sway its extended body to and fro, as if
seeking for a hold for the six legs near
its head, and the Colonel snatched the
wire cage away. The long body bent
down to the surface of the table, found a
footing there for the forelegs and drew
itself up into a loop which brought the
hind claspers against the forelegs. The
head then shot forth, secured a hold, and
the tail was drawn up to it again in the
familiar method of "looper” caterpillars.
But in each of these strides, the creature
covered about two feet of ground and the
movements were performed with in-
credible rapidity. Before the watchers
realized what was happening, it was on’
the floor and looping its way across the
carpet at a great speed.

  The three men backed away from it
with pale, horror-stricken faces.

  "Do you realize that it may grow to
fifty meet or more?” gasped the Colonel.
"Imagine hundreds of them loose in the
country—they’d devastate a county in a
week.”

  "They’re big enough to provide a good
target,” suggested Langton.

  "Yes, but once they’re half-grown,
how’re you going to kill them?” de-
manded the Colonel. "Bullets from any
MOTH

479

ordinary firearm wouldn't pierce them—
you’d need artillery. You’d need to
evacuate the country and send out an
army against them.”

  "I—I suppose they’re not carnivorous,
anyhow,” said the medical officer.

  "God knows what they eat in the moon
or Mars or wherever they’ve come from,”
groaned the Colonel. "But we must chain
this fellow up before he starts on my
carpet.”

  He slipped off his coat and threw it
over the caterpillar, muffling its head
carefully. But even then, it required all
his strength to wrench its hind claspers
from the carpet: they came away with
bits of the material attached.

  He rushed out of the house with the
writhing creature in his hands, followed
by the others. In the stableyard was a
brick shed with a corrugated-iron roof
and a stout door; into this they thrust the
caterpillar and locked the door, first
flinging in half a dozen cabbages which
the Colonel pulled ruthlessly from the
kitchen garden. Then, three greatly
shaken men, they returned to the house,
but this time it was to the dining-room
that they went, where the Colonel pro-
duced the whisky decanter. They helped
themselves generously and drank in si-
lence.

“\\ T ell,” said the medical officer,
Y Y presently, "there is nothing for
me to do here. The P. M. and his scien-
tific big bugs are coming to see you on
Friday. Meantime, I shall tell them what
I’ve seen—and as for the air ministry,
I’ll quote Hamlet to them—but it won’t
have any effect, I’m afraid.”

  With this he took his leave.

  Shortly afterward, the two friends set
out on another exploration of the region
in which the egg had been found; but a
prolonged' search of the grass and the

  trees in the neighboring parts of the for-
est revealed nothing. They returned tired
and exhausted and sat late over an excel-
lent dinner, discussing the subject that
was foremost in their thoughts.

Before they retired, Langton suggested
that they might take another look at the
shed in the stable yard.

"Just what I was thinking myself,”
said the Colonel. "He’s safe enough in
there, of course, but we don’t know what
he is capable of consuming in the way of
food. Let us collect a few more cabbages
and throw them in, shall we? In the
morning, I propose to photograph him.

I	wish we had thought of doing it when
he was first hatched—it would have been
useful as a record of growth.”

The night was cloudy and dark, but
with the aid of two powerful electric
torches they raided the kitchen garden
again and proceeded to the shed. The'
Colonel unlocked the stout door and flung
it open, while Langton flashed his torch
round the interior.

It was empty.

"It’s gone!” cried Langton. They
entered the shed and closed the door
while they turned the torches upon every
cranny and corner that could hide the
creature. It was not there.

"My God!” cried the Colonel, sudden-
ly; "look at that!”

He pointed at a little heap of brick
dust at the foot of the back wall and
then at a hole eaten through the brick-
work above it. Here and there, there
were deep scores in the bricks round this
point as if they had been gnawed by some
animal; on the floor lay the droppings of
the caterpillar. The cabbages had only
been partly consumed.

"Do you understand what this means?”
asked Colonel Butler, almost in a whis-
per. "It means that these things can eat
brick—ic has eaten and digested brick-
480

WEIRD TALES

work—the droppings prove that. But
after all, is that more impossible than
their size? The little forms of this crea-
ture that we know in this world live on
vegetable matter which is derived from
the earth—might not a gigantic and more
robust digestive system deal with the earth
itself, even in the form of brick and
stone?”

  Langton stared at him with fear in his

eyes.

  "Suppose they began to attack houses?”

  "You see for yourself what would
happen,” replied the Colonel. "I sup-
pose we had better make a search for it
—but it may be miles away by now,
travelling at that rate, and if it’s near we
shall never find it in the dark.”

  Nevertheless they made what search
they could with the aid of the torches, but
it was fruitless. Their prisoner had
escaped and they never saw it again.
There was nothing to be done but to
await developments.

Next morning there was a letter for
the Colonel from the Prime Min-
ister. It was a brief communication stat-
ing that he had heard of the hatching of
the egg and confirming his visit at the end
of the week. Meantime, he urged upon
the Colonel and Langton the extreme un-
desirability of starting a scare among the
public and enjoined secrecy. The com-
mittee he had got together had expressed
the opinion that if such creatures had
reached the earth—a possibility which
they did not accept—the conditions would
be so different from those of their native
habitat that they would certainly perish
in a very short time, and this would apply
to the larvae if any were hatched. It
seemed, therefore, the Prime Minister
wrote, that any idea of real danger to the
community might be dismissed, and that
to avoid wild and exaggerated reports,

nothing had better be done or said at
present. The committee would look at
the egg and inspect the spot on which it
was found: he wished to be present at
these investigations himself and his first
available day was Friday.

  "The real meaning of that lies between
the lines,” said Langton, when the Colo-
nel had finished reading this communica-
tion aloud. "It means that those old fos-
sils don’t believe a word of the story and
think that we have faked this egg our-
selves. When they hear that the cater-
pillar has escaped, they’ll nod their
sapient heads and say, 'Quite!’ in tri-
umphant fashion.”

  The Colonel nodded.

  "That’s about the size of it, I’m
afraid,” he agreed. "Very well, let the
P. M. and his friends have it their own
way. Our orders are to do nothing—
good! We’ll obey them. But I tell you
what we can do, Langton, and that's keep
a lookout.”

  "How d’ye mean?”

  "In the press. I’ve ordered all the Lon-
don papers to be delivered here every day,
and most of the important provincial
journals as well. Now, I suggest that we
go through them every day and cut out
anything that might have the remotest
bearing on the presence of these crea-
tures. I mean to say, the connection
might not be obvious at once—we’ll have
to weigh every item of home news with
reference to a possible bearing.”

  Langton thought the idea a good one
and welcomed it as a relief from the
monotony of inaction. They spent that
morning going through the newspapers,
and most of the afternoon as well, but
the result was nil.

  Next day, however, the search yielded
something that might be a possibility.
The Colonel looked up from the Times
W. T—3
MOTH

481

in which he was immersed at the sound
of Langton’s scissors.

  "Struck something?” he asked, eagerly.

  "Listen to this,” said Langton. "It’s the
Express: 'Ghost in Epping Forest. Yester-
day afternoon two men arrived at the
Robin Hood Inn in an exhausted and ter-
rified state, telling an incoherent story of
having seen a ghost in Monks Wood
where they had been resting. They said
they had run for over a mile in their ter-
ror and were in such a collapsed condi-
tion that the landlord supplied them with
brandy at his own charge. The men, who
were of the tramp class, stated that they
were on their way to London from the
north and had camped in the wood for
their midday meal. They were unable to
describe what they had seen clearly but
said that something horrible had looked
at them from a tree overhead. One said
it looked like the Devil and the other
described it as a huge horny face. They
declined to report the matter to the police
and shortly afterward proceeded to Lon-
don by bus. Local opinion is skeptical as
to the presence of a ghost or a monster
in Monks Wood, one of the finest natural
preserves in the Forest. The police believe
that they were the victims of a practical
joke, and the more cynical members of
the force suggest that the whole affair was
an ingenious method of obtaining drink
at the expense of the landlord of the
Robin Hood.’ ”

  "Sounds like our escaped friend,” said
the Colonel. "We’d better file that, and
have a look at Monks Wood ourselves.”
But the visit to Monks Wood yielded
no trace of the missing caterpillar. Next
day’s paper, however, yielded one or two
paragraphs on the same subject and men-
tioned other reports of picnickers and
pedestrians in the forest having been
scared by strange sounds and sights. By
the third day, the Epping Forest Mystery
W. T.—4

had become news, but the press treated
it as a subject for humor and accused the
inhabitants of trying to advertise their
neighborhood at the expense of the Sea-
side resorts. The Telegraph pointed out
that the best that the seaside could do
was a sea-serpent and that was not due
till August, whereas here were the propri-
etors of swings and roundabouts and tea
gardens trying to draw custom by pro-
claiming the arrival of a land serpent, of
terrifying dimensions, for such was the
description given by one party.

  But on Friday morning the press had
changed its tone. The penny papers and
flaring headlines announcing a "Dastard-
ly Outrage in Epping Forest.” Late on
the previous night, three motor coaches
conveying excursionists to London passed
through the village of Epping at a fast
speed. A mile or two farther on the lead-
ing coach struck an unseen obstacle which
killed the driver and ripped the entire
top from the chassis, causing numerous
casualties among the passengers. The fol-
lowing coach swerved out to avoid a col-
lision and ran into the same obstacle with
nearly similar results, and the third
vehicle, so quickly did the whole thing
happen, was unable to pull up and
crashed into the wreckage. When the
police and the ambulances reached the
spot, an appalling scene was revealed by
the headlights of the numerous cars now
stopped. Dead and injured lay all over
the road and in the wreckage of the
coaches, and the cause of the accident was
plainly revealed by the fragments of a
cable of some very strong but unknown
substance attached to tree trunks on either
side of the highway.

  "An outrage that could only have been
planned by fiends,” as one paper put it,
certainly seemed a just description of the
affair. That it was a carefully thought-
out affair seemed certain to the press.
482

WEIRD TALES

The cable was of a substance unknown to
industry or science and of great strength.
First investigations suggested that it was
composed of some combination of the
materials that go to make artificial silk
and it had been fixed to trees on either
side by adhesive of mysterious nature.
The whole affair was obviously the work
of enemies of society: perfectly innocent
and harmless holiday-makers had been
massacred and maimed with the most
callous cruelty. Public opinion was imme-
diately aflame: suspicion centered upon
Bolshevist agents and the Communist
Party was accused of participation in the
outrage. Communists’ clubs and commit-
tee rooms were wrecked by angry crowds,
an attack was made upon the Russian
Embassy and many innocent people were
injured and hunted through the streets.

  Search of the forest by day revealed no
hidden anarchists: but a strong police
patrol was put upon all main roads.

Colonel butler and Langton,
although they were living not very
far from the scene of this affair, heard
nothing of it till the following morning,
when the Colonel’s butler brought him
the papers with his morning tea. He was
still absorbing the details when Langton
came into the room with his tea in one
hand and a paper in the other.

  "You know what this is!” cried the
Colonel, waving his paper in the air.

  "I do,” said Langton, gravely. "It was
a thread spun by one of those infernal
creatures from one tree to another. Of
course it would be invisible at night and
of course it would be frightfully strong.
This’ll happen again, unless something is
done about it. Surely this will make the
authorities do something.”

  "Not a hope!” asserted the Colonel.
"They’ve made up their minds that we’re
madmen or fakers—people in that frame

of mind are not capable of making deduc-
tions. You see what they say—the work
of Communists and Anarchists. Why
should Communists want to murder
coachloads of working people? Where
did they get this mysterious cable that’s
baffling the experts? What fools people
are, Langton! And here are we con-
demned to sit here till tomorrow when
the Prime Minister is bringing his com-
mittee of old wives to mumble over it.
Perhaps they won’t come at all, now!”
"This paper put two and two together
to some extent,” said Langton. "Listen:
'It is impossible not to connect this out-
rage with the mysterious reports of the
haunting of the Forest by terrifying crea-
tures which have been current for some
days. No doubt the perpetrators of the
crime required some days to perfect their
arrangements and took that means of scar-
ing away unwanted observers. But it is
too late to search the Forest now: the
criminals have undoubtedly put a safe
distance between them and the scene of
their devilish activities.”

  "Whereas,” said the Colonel, "the real
criminals are still on the spot—they are
lying by day extended along the branches
and trunks of trees, so like them in sub-
stance that it is almost impossible to de-
tect them even if you’re looking for them.
And nobody’s looking for them—they’re
chasing innocent Communists and threat-
ening amazed Russians. I tell you what,
Langton! I’m not anxious to die before
my time and I’m not going out into the
Forest myself, till we’ve seen the Prime
Minister and found out what he’s going
to do. D’ye realize that one of those fel-
lows could practically bite your head off?”
"In any case,” said Langton, "I can’t
go against the P. M.’s orders—I’d lose
my last hope of professional reinstate-
ment if I did. We’ll sit tight till he comes
MOTH

483

tomorrow. We’ve warned him and the
responsibility isn’t ours, now.”

  Next morning the press sensations were
unabated. A constant patrol of the For-
est roads had been maintained but in spite
of the vigilance of the police, two new
cables were found laid across the high-
ways in a precisely similar manner. An
order was issued closing all roads in the
district to traffic by night. Meantime panic
had spread among the inhabitants: the
wildest and most incredible stories were
flying about of a non-human monster hid-
ing in the woods, and of extraordinary
sounds rising from the thickets after
dark.

About eleven o’clock a number of cars
- arrived at Wintram Hall bringing
the Prime Minister and his committee as
well as several high officers of the army
and air force. It was a hot and rather
misty July morning, without a breath of
wind, and from the terrace which com-
manded a wide view of the forest mile
upon mile of woodland could be seen
shimmering in the heat haze which
obscured the distant outlines.

  The Colonel received his visitors as
they alighted and conducted them to the
study, where the necessary introductions
were effected. The experts who formed
the committee were Professor Meakerly,
a famous biologist, and two eminent
members of the Royal Entomological
Society. These gentlemen at once asked
to see the egg.

  They subjected it to a careful scrutiny,
while the Prime Minister was talking to
the Colonel and Langton and the officers
he had brought with him.

  "You may be surprized to see these
gentlemen,” he said, referring to the lat-
ter, "but it is my intention, when we have
looked into this affair of the egg, to in-
vestigate this other mystery of the Forest.

In fact, as soon as the mist clears, a
thorough examination of the forest will
be made from the air—it may afford a
clue to the presence of the miscreants re-
sponsible for the outrages.”

Langton and the Colonel stared at the
speaker, but before they could say any-
thing, an interruption came from the
scientists.

"And now may we see the caterpillar,
please?” asked the biologist.

'.'Unfortunately, it escaped the same
night,” said the Colonel. "We made a
search but it was hopeless.”

"Quite,” said the biologist, and the
three exchanged glances. "Was it not
confined in any way?”

"Yes, in a brick and iron shed,” re-
plied the Colonel. "It gnawed through
the bricks and got away.”

"It eats bricks, then?” queried one of
the entomologists, with a half-smile.

"It does,” replied the Colonel, stout-
ly* "for not only did it get out but it had
been eating the walls in a lot of places—
and it not only eats brick but digests it,
as its droppings prove.”

"A truly remarkable caterpillar!” said
the other entomologist, and there was a
general laugh. "I don’t know that we
need take up any more of Colonel But-
ler’s no doubt valuable time,” he con-
tinued, "but it might be interesting to see
this shed—and the digested brickwork.”
"By all means!” said the Colonel. "But
you have examined the egg—perhaps
you would be good enough to say what
you make of that?”

The three looked at each other and
then the biologist replied.

"We propose to take a portion of it
with us for analysis,” he said, with heavy
sarcasm. "I have seen an enlarged model
of the egg of a lepidopterous insea which
was fashioned of material obtained by
calcining gypsum until it had become
484

WEIRD TALES

partially dehydrated and the addition of
a little coloring matter. It was a remark-
ably good imitation of this of course
genuine object.”

  "In other words, you suggest that it is
made of plaster of Paris,” said the Colo-
nel, with a smile. "Very good—it is not
for me to suggest that such an eminent
authority might be mistaken.” He was
about to say more, when a surprizing
interruption came from his friend.

  "By Jove!” exclaimed Langton. "Plas-
ter of Paris—that gives me an idea!”
Inquiring glances were turned upon
him, but he relapsed into silence. The
Colonel, seeing that he did not want to
be questioned, proposed that they should
now examine the shed.

  "Excellent!” exclaimed the biologist,
who was nettled by the Colonel’s reply.
"That’s just what we want to do to com-
plete our inquiry. Has any objection oc-
curred to you, Colonel?” he asked, as the
Colonel seemed to hesitate.

  "No!” burst out that honest soldier,
angrily. "I only want to say first that it
passes my comprehension how the Prime
Minister, for whose common sense I have
always had the greatest respect, can allow
himself to be so far deluded by the
skepticism of this committee as not to see
for himself the connection between the
appearances of these moths and these so-
called outrages in the Forest, which he
says he is going to investigate. Why, the
thing’s as plain as the nose on my face to
any one who’s not prejudiced.”

  The Prime Minister flushed; the mem-
bers of the committee, exchanged smiles.

  "Kindly explain yourself, Colonel,”
said the Prime Minister, with dignity.

  "Sir,” said the Colonel, "forgive me if
I spoke impatiently and if I make my ex-
planation elementary. If one egg has
been laid, probably hundreds have. Prob-
ably you remember from boyhood what

a looper caterpillar is like? Well, these
are gigantic loopers—that lie concealed
during the day by their very resemblance
to tree trunks or branches, if any danger
threatens them—they can spin threads
strong enough to bear their own weight
and a good deal more. The cable that
those cars ran into was nothing but a
thread made by one of them from one
tree to another. The horny heads like
devils that people say they have seen—
isn’t that obvious? Didn’t one of your
airmen report yesterday that he saw noth-
ing suspicious in the forest but that there
was a spot that looked as if it had been
burned recently? If any one had had
courage to explore that burned area, he
would have found that it wasn’t burned
but simply eaten out by these creatures.”

  That the Prime Minister was impressed
by the Colonel’s sincerity was obvious.
He turned frowning to the men of science,
but as he did so he cast a startled glance
at the window.

  "What is happening out there?” he
demanded. The Colonel ran to the French
windows and flung them open and the
whole party followed him out on to the
terrace.

  A rapidly growing crowd of obviously
frightened people was gathering on the
Colonel’s lawns, from which as from the
terrace a wide view of the Forest could be
obtained. Their gaze was directed on one
section of the woodland about a mile
away, in which, despite the windless
morning, a strange agitation was visible
among the trees. On the still morning
air curious tearing and rending sounds
were audible, as of tom and snapped
branches. Tree tops disappeared before
the watchers’ eyes, leaving gaps in the
greenery in which long writhing forms
were visible. Occasionally a long, eel-like
body appeared above the trees, waving to
and fro: it would descend on a mass of
MOTH

485

foliage which in a short space of time had
disappeared altogether.

The Prime Minister and his commit-
tee gazed in astonishment at the
scene—Colonel Butler had slipped away
from the group, and returning in a few
moments, he distributed field glasses
amongst them. The Prime Minister, the
biologist and one of the other experts
snatched them eagerly and focussed them
on the disturbed area.

  "Now, do you believe?” asked the
Colonel, after a few moments. The biol-
ogist lowered his glasses and turned to
him.

  "I do,” he said, simply, "and I offer
you and Commodore Langton my sin-
cerest apologies. There is no doubt that
there is a brood of creatures like gigantic
caterpillars in the trees there—and, by
Jove! they are making short work of the
Forest!”

  The Colonel nodded: he was not the
man to maintain a grudge.

  "That’s all right, sir,” he said. "The
thing’s too incredible for any one to
swallow without proof. But the question
now is how are we going to deal with
them. I estimate they’ll grow to at least
seventy-five feet—I don’t know how
you’re going to kill them, short of artil-
lery.”

  "Is there danger to human life?” asked
the Prime Minister. The biologist re-
plied:

  "Terrible danger, I should say, if they
break out of there—and if they’re not all
destroyed, you’ll have another brood
hatching out in time. They might wipe
out human life and human houses, not to
speak of destroying vegetation to the last
leaf.”

  "Has any one a suggestion?”

  "I have, sir,” said an air officer. "Let

me telephone for a squadron of bombers
and bomb them out.”

  "The effect would be to destroy the
Forest—and there would be a possible
loss of human life,” objected the politi-
cian. "I can’t take such an extreme meas-
ure without consulting my colleagues in
the Cabinet. And the control of the For-
est is vested by Act of Parliament in the
Corporation of London—they must be
consulted. And a public warning must be
given first in any case.”

  "Do you realize, sir, what the danger
really is?” asked the Colonel. "Imagine
these creatures, say fifty feet long and
stronger than anything we can conceive
of, emerging from the Forest on the
neighboring towns and villages! We have
seen that they can eat anything—why, one
of them might devastate a village in an
hour.”

  But the nature of the whole question
was strange to the Prime Minister and his
imagination refused to function with
sufficient range: the first consideration
with him was the fear of public opinion
and its repercussion at the approaching
elections. He shook his head.

  "We must make haste slowly, Colo-
nel,” he said. "Let all preparations be
made by the air ministry for dealing
with the creatures by bombing—but noth-
ing must be done without my express
sanction, and my sanction for the ruthless
destruction of London’s finest playground
will not be given except in the last emer-
gency'. By the look of it, there is enough
food there for these creatures for many
days to come: I shall return to London
and summon the Cabinet at once.”

  "Don’t forget, sir,” urged the Colonel,
"that they’re growing every day. Their
progress tomorrow will be twice what it
is today.”

  "I shall lose no time, be assured of
that,” was the reply, and they all had to
486

WEIRD TALES

be contented with that. It was arranged
that an air observation patrol should be
maintained till a decision had been come
to, and that a certain force of infantry
should be drafted to the Forest area with
instructions to shoot the creatures on
sight. The Prime Minister then took his
departure with the committee.

The Colonel groaned as he and Lang-
ton watched the departing cars.

"It’s sheer suicide!” he exclaimed. "My
God, fancy thinking of votes at a mo-
ment like this! However, there it is—and
if they won’t have lunch, we may as well,
while we have a roof over our heads.”
They went to the dining-room, and
before they had finished their meal they
heard through the open windows the
droning of airplanes which were circling
over the Forest and dispatching wireless
reports momentarily to headquarters.

"A few bombs dropped now in the
middle of that brood would do the trick,”
remarked Langton, as they looked on:
"but when they get a little bigger they’ll
separate.”

The Colonel agreed.

"Judging by the size of these fellows
out there,” he said, "they either grow at a
colossal speed or they’re an earlier brood
than our egg. Hillo! Hear that! The
troops have arrived on the scene, eh?”
The sound of scattered firing, in cu-
rious wooden thuds, came to their ears
from the Forest below. The Colonel got
up eagerly.

"I say,” he exclaimed, "let us go down
and have a look at this—reminds me of
old times.”

3. The Death Grapple

They made their way down to the
Forest. Dense crowds of sightseers
thronged the roads, despite the warn-
ings of the police patrols: press men

and press photographers hung about
hoping to hear or see something sensa-
tional. But no one was allowed to leave
the roadways and when the Colonel and
Langton tried to penetrate the woods in
the direction of the firing, they were
promptly halted by the military. Not
even the Colonel’s rank and standing as a
local magistrate would have been of avail,
had not a hot and perspiring officer
emerged from the thicket and overheard
the argument.

  "I’m sorry, sir,” he said to the Colonel,
"but I can’t let you through—orders are
absolutely stria. We’re aaually in aaion
and there’s considerable danger from
stray bullets.”

  "Doing any good?’ asked Langton.
"Not the least,” grumbled the officer.
"Might as well use pea-shooters. Bullets
bounce off them, so far as I can see. Only
sting them up and annoy them. They’ve
done for one or two men already. I mean
to say, one of the fellows saw one stand-
ing up like a tree trunk and fired at it—
the thing switched about and came down
on him with its forelegs—picked him up
and dropped him with all his ribs broken.
Another hit a man when it was swaying
about and knocked him against a tree—
killed. We’re simply stirring them up.”
"Hm!” said the Colonel, "I doubt if it’s
wise. Suppose you start them travelling,
how are you going to stop them?”

  "Can’t,” said the officer. "They’ve
started already in places. We had a firing-
line and the damned things simply stepped
over it. Never saw anything like it—
d’ye know some of them must be getting
on for forty or fifty feet? They’re simply
eating the heart out of the Forest, as if it
were a cabbage.”

  "They should be bombed out,” said
Langton.

  "Of course,” agreed the soldier. "But
would you believe it, the City Corporation
MOTH

487

object! Nobody seems to realize what
we’re up against. D’ye know that they’re
running excursions from London to see
the strange monsters, as they call them?
Look at this mob—out for a picnic, you’d
think.”

  With that he left them, and they de-
tached themselves from the crowd and
made their way back to Wintram Hall, the
Colonel full of gloomy prognostications
as to what would happen if the authorities
did not wake up to the danger. They were
met in the hall by an excited butler.

  "Sir,” he cried, "they say that the crea-
tures are moving through the Forest south-
ward and that the army’s got a battery of
artillery on the golf course at Chingford
to meet them if they come out.”

  "Ah,” said the Colonel, "then some
one’s taken charge at last! That’s the best
thing they could do—get them in the open
and blow them to bits. Tell Jones to get
the car ready—we’ll run down to Ching-
ford as soon as we’ve had a cup of tea and
see how things are.”

  But when the car emerged on the high-
road, they found it blocked by a surging
mass of fugitives, on foot, in cars, in
motor coaches and every kind of vehicle,
all making in common panic for the shel-
ter of London. Terrifying stories were
current of the oncoming of a horde of
death-dealing monsters: hundreds of sol-
diers, it was rumored, had been killed and
the creatures were proof against bullets;
they could tear down houses and devour
their inhabitants. People were leaving
their dwellings and joining the fleeing
mob, women were screaming in terror and
white-faced men were forcing their way
through the throng. An occasional burst
of rifle fire from the trees only served to
quicken the panic. It was over an hour
before the Colonel’s car, moving at a
snail’s pace, managed to traverse the few
miles to Chingford, and the Colonel and

Langton, leaving it among the trees in
charge of the chauffeur, managed to find
a footing on the hill behind the Forest
Hotel.

  From this point they commanded a view
of the open plain and the great stretch of
forest to the north. Across the golf course,
a battery of quick-firers was drawn up in
the open, the gunners at the ready. They
were supported by lines of troops lying
on the grass. The terrified inhabitants of
the village on the edge of the golf course
stood at their windows or in their gardens
staring in astonishment at these war-like
preparations; others were loading their
cars with valuables in readiness for imme-
diate flight.

  But the little group of cooler spectators
on the hill had their eyes fixed upon the
dense green sea of the forest. The same
strange agitation among the trees that they
had seen farther north that morning, the
Colonel and Langton now saw again, not
very far away, accompanied by the same
rending and crashing sounds. But it was
obvious that the center of the disturbance
was moving southward toward them. Now
and then volleys of rifle fire broke out;
above the falling trees, great writhing
shapes appeared and withdrew.

  "Whoever’s handling this job knows
what he’s doing,” said the Colonel. "You
hear that firing—first on one flank and
then on the other? He’s shepherding them
down to the guns—may not be able to kill
them but he’s got them on the run—and
by Jove! they’re coming pretty fast!”

He had scarcely spoken when the first
of the monsters appeared on the
edge of the Forest. A vast columnar shape
rose above the thicket of thorn bushes that
fringed the trees and bowed its head down
to take a foothold on the grass of the open
plain. In an instant the giant loop was
drawn up and the creature had thrust its
WEIRD TALES

length forward again, taking forty feet in
its stride. The speed at which it progressed
seemed incredible; behind it, other vast
shapes could be seen twisting and writh-
ing through the trees.

  Faint and thin in the distance they heard
a word of command: there was a flash
from one of the guns, followed by the
thud of the explosion and by the crash of a
bursting shell.

  "Good man!” breathed the Colonel, as
a cloud of dust and smoke rose from the
ground just where the advancing cater-
pillar was taking a fresh foothold. The
creature reared on its hind claspers, swayed
for a moment and then fell like a falling
factory chimney; the long body thrashed
to and fro on the grass in the muscular
contortions of death. A cheer went up
from the onlookers.

  But now the whole brood, about a hun-
dred in number, had broken from the
cover of the trees and was looping toward
the guns with frightening velocity. It is
almost impossible to give any adequate
idea of the terrifying nature of the specta-
cle that confronted the gunner and the
trembling crowds. Huge eel-like bodies,
some forty or fifty feet in length, towered
in the air or flung themselves in gigantic
looping strides toward the line of artillery.
These bodies were a dull red; they were
surmounted by flattish, horny heads armed
with formidable pincer-like jaws and
cavernous mouths; three pairs of many-
jointed legs of shining horny substance,
immediately behind the head, tore the
surface of the ground they descended
upon, like the automatic diggers used in
excavation. Such a spectacle had never
before been seen by human eyes: beside
them, the soldiers looked like pigmies and
their guns like toys.

  Yet, true to their traditions, the men of
the British army stood firmly to their
guns. There was no flinching, but here

and there a Cockney flung a jesting re-
mark to his comrades.

  "They’re leaving it too late,” growled
the Colonel, as he watched the mass of
looping shapes bearing down upon the
artillery. But even as he spoke, a sheet of
flame sprang from the line of guns and the
roll of their fire reverberated in his ears.
From the clouds of smoke and earth
thrown up by the bursting shells, huge
writhing shapes shot up like the tentacles
of a stricken octopus, wavered in the air
and then fell with heavy thuds that could
be felt and heard. One huge form bore
through the smoke and grasping a gun in
its enormous arms flung it into the air;
another, swinging its body in the death
agony, fell upon a gun and its crew and
obliterated them; one or two others
stepped right over the battery in one gi-
gantic stride. But now men of the infantry
in reserve ran forward and attacked them
with Mills bombs of high destructive
power and, one by one, the great creatures
swayed, stumbled and collapsed with great
rents torn in their sides, from which a
green liquid poured in floods. In a very
short space of time the affair was over: the
plain was piled with battered shapes, still
writhing as life ebbed from them and still
dangerous to approach. Dead and injured
men were being attended to on the ground
and hurried into waiting ambulances, but
a huge sigh of relief went up from the
watching crowd as they realized that the
danger had been magnificently overcome.

  Presently long lines of bombers con-
verged on the forest and disappeared into
its recesses: an occasional explosion could
be heard as they carried out their task of
running down any stragglers from the
main brood of the creatures that had
seemed to threaten the human race.

  Langton turned to his friend.

  "That was jolly well handled!” he said
MOTH

489

with heart-felt relief. "The danger is over,
if that was the only brood.”

  "Yes,” replied the Colonel. "The
army’s not played out yet when it comes
to a job of work! But is it the only brood?
I hope so—and it probably is. After all,
only one pair was seen.”

  "And one of the pair is dead, we know
—the other has probably perished, also,
by this time or returned to the upper re-
gions. Yes—the chances are a million to
one that this is the last of them.”

  They disentangled themselves from the
crowd and went home, ail access to the
field of action being forbidden by the mili-
tary. This was necessary, for every now
and then a long body would heave itself
up from the pile of shattered monsters
and thrash to and fro in an expiring con-
vulsion. And whenever this happened,
bombers ran forward to dispatch it.

  That night there were scenes of the
wildest rejoicing in the streets of London
and the suburbs. When the news came
through of the destruction of the whole
horde of monsters which had threatened
the safety of perhaps even London itself,
the people swarmed into the thorough-
fares and abandoned themselves to maf-
ficking. The authorities made no attempt
to interfere beyond checking the alcohol-
inspired excess of the wilder spirits. The
papers poured out edition after edition de-
scribing the Battle of Chingford and spe-
cials containing news of the destruction of
yet another monster in the depths of the
Forest. The news, flashed found the world,
brought with it a wave of relief to other
nations, for the tidings of the last few days
had revealed to scientists everywhere a
threat to the very existence of mankind.

IN the warm dusk of the July night, the
Colonel and Langton were sitting in
the garden of Wintram Hall, smoking
their final cigars. They could hear dimly

the sounds of general rejoicing: bonfires
blazed, and rockets soared into the dark-
ness; faint sounds of singing came from
the neighboring village.

The Colonel flung away the stump of
his cigar and rose from his chair; he stood
sniffing the air for a moment.

"Although it’s such a hot night, Lang-
ton,” he said, presently, "I think we
should keep our windows shut. Can you
smell anything?”

Langton became aware of a slight but
horribly sickly odor mingling with the
scent of the flowers. He looked inquir-
ingly at his friend.

"What did you expect?” asked the
Colonel, as he led the way indoors. "That
great heap of dead caterpillars—hun-
dreds of tons, there must be—putrefying.
It’ll be worse tomorrow.”

Down the valley of the Lea, toward
London, the smell was stealing almost im-
perceptibly but becoming momentarily
stronger. A slight northerly breeze that be-
gan to stir in the trees accelerated its
progress. The rejoicing crowds in Picca-
dilly fell silent as they began to breathe
the horrible contagion. What new terror
was this?

In Park Lane the dense throng pouring
north and south paused to sniff the breeze.
Where was this odor coming from—had
something gone wrong with the sewers or
was it coming from above? As they stood
gazing upward, they were startled by a
succession of crashes. A shower of tiles
and roofing material began to fall from
the huge soaring clock of Mondaine Man-
sions, the biggest building of its kind in
London. The cries of the injured started
a panic—people surged this way and that
in an endeavor of escape from some new
unseen danger, the weak were trampled
underfoot and the strong, if they stum-
bled, were lost.

It took the police and the military sev-
490

WEIRD TALES

eral hours to clear Park Lane and the
vicinity. The crowds were sternly admon-
ished to go home, the injured were col-
lected and dispatched to the hospitals. A
little group of officials stood in the at last
empty roadway looking at the pile of
debris which had fallen on the crowd.

  "Heavens! What on earth is that
stink?” exclaimed Chief Inspector Salis-
bury to another officer.

  "It’s the decaying corpses of those
things at Chingford, they say,” replied his
friend. "Hillo, hillo!”

  The exclamation was caused by the de-
scent of another small shower of broken
tiles from the top of the building.

  "Seems as if the damn thing is crum-
bling!” said the Chief Inspector. "We’ll
have to close the road except for people
coming to the Mansions—we can make
them use the back entrance.”

  "Yes, but there’s a dance going on in
there,” said his friend. "My God, what’s
all this?”

  Through the main entrance of the build-
ing there came pouring a struggling terri-
fied mob of men and women in evening
dress. Some shouted frantically for their
cars and taxi-cabs; others started running
on foot; some surged round the police of-
ficers imploring help and protection. It
took them some time to disentangle any-
thing coherent from the babble of voices
around them.

  At last, a little disheveled man in pa-
jamas with an overcoat thrown over them
disengaged himself from the crowd and
told his story.

  He was a servant employed in the man-
sions who was off duty that night and had
retired to bed about eleven o’clock. He
had been awakened some time later by a
curious scraping, scratching sound that
seemed to come from the roof overhead—
his bedroom was on the attic floor of the
building. He kept on hearing the sound

and then dozing off and hearing it again.
Then when it seemed to be getting nearer
and louder—like a big rat gnawing, he
said—he had switched on the light and
sat up in bed. As he did so, a shower of
plaster fell on his head and he looked up.

  There was a hole in the ceiling above
his head and looking down at him was a
horny, evil-looking head with a pair of
great jaws which were eating away the
lath and plaster of tfie ceiling as though it
were paper.

  At first the little man had sat staring at
the thing, hypnotized by the horror of it
and wondering whether he was in a night-
mare. Then he had a flash of comprehen-
sion—he had been reading the evening
papers and studying the photographs of
the monsters of Epping Forest. This was
undoubtedly the same sort of creature on a
smaller scale. He leaped out of bed, threw
on an overcoat, and raced for his life,
shouting an alarm as he ran. An aston-
ished liftman had refused to admit him
to his lift till the little man, shaking the
steel bars of the door in a frenzy, had man-
aged to convey to him what he had seen.
The lift shot down to the ground floor and
the man ran along the corridors and found
himself at the entrance to the ballroom.
Dashing through the protesting attend-
ants, he reached the middle of the floor
and shouted:

  "They’re here—the caterpillars are here
—in this house—they’re eating the roof
off. I tell you, I’ve seen them.”

  As the sound of his voice reached the
ears of the astonished dancers and his
meaning began to penetrate their minds,
the couples one by one came to a standstill
and began to crowd round him. The band
stopped playing and stood up to listen.
Angry managers and waiters who pushed
forward and tried to drag him away were
stopped by the guests who insisted on
hearing his story. Every mind was full of
MOTH

491

the press accounts of the horrors from
which London had been saved that after-
noon—and here was a terrified man pro-
claiming that the monsters were not only
in London but in that very building. Some
scoffed, but the earnestness of the fright-
ened man was convincing. In vain did the
managers try to laugh the thing down: the
gathering was a fashionable one and sev-
eral of the men present insisted authorita-
tively on going up and testing the truth of
the story for themselves.

  When they had left the ballroom, the
guests stood about uneasily, the timid edg-
ing toward the door. The band attempted
to resume its functions but was angrily
shouted down by the people, who wanted
to discuss this strange report, and to cross-
examine the shivering little man in pa-
jamas. The longer they waited, the more
a feeling of panic grew: there were noisy
shouts for champagne and whisky, which
were served by pale and trembling wait-
ers. The legend of the Forest monsters
had by this time grown to a story of man-
devouring dragons clad in impenetrable
armor from whom there could be no
escape.

When the men who had gone up in
the lift to inspect the man’s room
returned to the ballroom, one glance at
their set, grave faces was enough to set a
rush for the exits in motion. Their spokes-
man in a loud voice implored every one to
keep calm but thought it would be best if
they all went home at once. This precipi-
tated the rush of the panic-strcken guests
who had poured out into Park Lane and
surrounded the police officers.

  The first care of these officers was to get
every one out of the building; a cordon
was then drawn round it, to prevent in-
jury to passengers from the occasional
showers of debris that continued to fall;
and the officers, having informed the au-

thorities of what had happened, went up
to examine the place for themselves.

  Guided by the manager, they reached
the vast expanse of flat concrete, broken
here and there by tiled ridges and high
chimneys. With the aid of powerful lamps
they examined every part of the place
without result till they came to a long
ridge roof that ran across the frontage to
Park Lane.

  A strange sight met their eyes. The til-
ing was mostly eaten away, leaving some
of the rafters that had supported it bare
and skeleton-like against the sky. Rows of
huge caterpillars were at work on it, sys-
tematically demolishing everything but
their own foothold. A huge gap yawned
into the interior of the building and the
darkness of it was populated with dimly
seen moving forms.

  "They’re here, all right,” said the Chief
Inspector, wiping his forehead. "And how
are we going to deal with them here, eh?”
"Luckily they’re comparatively small,”
said the manager. "Nothing like the For-
est ones, if the accounts are true.”

  "Yes,” said the Inspector, who knew
something about the subject, "but how
big do you suppose they’ll be when they’ve
eaten this building?”

  "Nonsense,” was the reply. "Men with
axes could get rid of these easily enough,
it seems to me.”

  "Their axes wouldn’t make a scratch on
the skins of these things,” was the reply.
"We’d better get down and shut the place
up till the War Office makes up its mind
what to do.”

  The War Office was not unduly con-
cerned: it had dealt with the first menace
and it could deal with this, it felt. It con-
tented itself with posting a regiment in
and round the block, and waited till day-
light should reveal the nature of the situa-
tion more clearly. Nevertheless, it was a
complicated problem that it laid before
492

WEIRD TALES

the Prime Minister and his Cabinet in the
morning.

  The huge building was rapidly being
eaten away: the two upper stories were
simply skeletons of girders from which all
the friable material had been consumed.
But it was out of the question to use artil-
lery in the heart of London, and bombing
by hand would involve much danger to
life and destruction to a building that rep-
resented a capital value of many millions.
The shareholders and directors were
clamoring to have their property saved
from a kind of destruction against which
they were not insured; the press and pub-
lic were demanding the most drastic meas-
ures to remove the menace to life and
property; and the brood of monsters was
growing rapidly. Their length today was
estimated at ten feet: what it might be in
a week, no one liked to guess. There
were a thousand suggestions, none of
them useful: the air force could not bomb
the place without destroying the whole
area, poison gas was out of the question,
the local authorities took one view, the
County Council another, Parliament was
not sitting. A day passed and no conclu-
sion was reached; a panic spread through
London and the roads were crowded in all
directions with cars bearing people away
to the safety of the country.

  Meantime, the monsters kept within
the building, eating systematically down-
ward. Brick, wood, furnishings, all
seemed grist to their digestive mill. The
braver inhabitants of London assembled in
the park in huge crowds to watch the
extraordinary spectacle of the huge block
of flats being slowly reduced to a skeleton
steel framework—for steel was the only
material that seemed to refuse to yield to
the action of those formidable jaws.

IT was on the third day, while the au-
thorities were still disputing as to
methods and who was to bear the cost of

operations, which might lead to wholesale
destruction of property, that driven by
some instinctive purpose, the brood broke
out of Mondaine Mansions, now mostly
reduced to a steel skeleton. Without
warning, they appeared suddenly on the
exterior walls and swung themselves down
on to the roadways that surrounded the
building. One body of about fifty crossed
Park Lane and stepping over the railings
took possession of Hyde Park. Other
smaller detachments wandered into May-
fair, some debouched on Piccadilly and
crossed into the Green Park. The crea-
tures, now about twenty feet long, moved
with such extreme rapidity that they had
scattered before any effective measures
could be devised to restrain them.

  Piccadilly was thronged with traffic
when without warning save for a few
shouts of terror from madly running peo-
ple, three of the monsters came looping
down Berkeley Street and turned up
toward the Circus. The effect was terrible:
traffic instantly came to a standstill and
people leaped from cars and omnibuses to
join in a wild flight to the safety of the
shops and clubs. The street became one
solid mass of abandoned vehicles over
which the great caterpillars walked, crush-
ing all but the strongest vehicles with their
weight, and occasionally pausing to lash
their great bodies to and fro as they were
irritated by the fumes and noise of the
hundreds of engines left running by their
owners in the stampede. Many unfortu-
nates who had remained in their cars were
trampled by the formidable legs and
claspers that descended on them. One
caterpillar sought to escape from its unac-
customed surroundings by taking a foot-
hold on a building: stretching out to its
full length, it fixed its forelegs on a bal-
cony and was lifting itself up when the
balcony gave way and crashed to the
pavement with the creature still clinging
MOTH

493

to it. For a moment it lay writhing, smash-
ing windows and wrecking cars with the
convulsive movements of its enormously
strong muscles; then it got on its feet and
followed the others toward the Circus.

  Here, timely warning had enabled the
police to clear the road of all vehicles. Sol-
diers and police were drawn across all the
thoroughfares opening on the Circus and
they immediately closed across the top of
Piccadilly when the three creatures
emerged on to the empty space of the
Circus. How they were to stop the prog-
ress of the caterpillars they did not know:
rifles were useless and dangerous, and
bombing was also dangerous in the con-
fined space with every window crowded
and every shop and restaurant packed with
fugitives. But fortunately the creatures
themselves solved the problem for a time
by coming to rest. One stood with head
and tail on the ground and its body in a
loop and the others stretched their long
bodies flat on the roadway.

A group of distracted men sat in the
Cabinet Room at No. 10 Downing
Street. Air and military experts were urg-
ing their plans upon the members of the
government, but all of them were so
fraught with danger to life and property
that to put them into operation at the mo-
ment was beyond the courage of the men
in control. The gathering was actually dis-
cussing the evacuation of the capital in
order to give the soldiers and airmen a
free hand, when it was interrupted by the
entry of a secretary who said that two
gentlemen were outside demanding an
interview, with such urgency that he had
thought it right to announce their pres-
ence.

  "They say they are Colonel Butler and
Air Commodore Langton, retired,” said
the secretary, "and they’ve got a string of
lorries out in Whitehall, the police tell
me.”

  "Butler and Langton—bring them in at
once,” said the Prime Minister, his face
lightening. "These are the two men whose
warnings and advice we have disregarded
all along. You gentlemen at the air minis-
try,” he added, bitterly, "drove Langton
out of the service and wanted to certify
him for discovering this menace—Butler
was the only man who had courage enough
to support him. They may be able to save
us yet.”

  There was an uncomfortable silence
among the experts, till the two friends
entered the room. They presented a
strange appearance, tired and worn, as
men who had not known sleep for a long
time: their clothes were crushed and un-
tidy and both were spotted from head to
foot with splashes of what looked like
whitewash.

  "Sir,” said the Colonel, without preface,
"we want an order placing us in command
of the fire brigade at once. Langton has
thought of a method of destroying these
creatures—we have been engaged in pre-
paring our material for some days—we
need the fire engines.”

  Murmurs arose immediately and de-
mands for an explanation from the assem-
bled experts. But the Colonel waved them
aside with an authoritative gesture.

  "The Prime Minister knows what it has
cost to put us under the control of experts
already,” he snapped, with the anger of a
man near breaking-point. "Our plan is
based upon a knowledge of entomology—
so was Langton’s first report that would
have sent him to an asylum if the authori-
ties had had their way. Briefly, sir, give
me a dozen fire engines with their crews
and we’ll dispose of those creatures in
Piccadilly Circus as a first step.”

  Without a word to his colleagues, the
Prime Minister wrote out an order rapidly
and handed it to the Colonel.

  "Take it, in God’s name,” he exclaimed,
49 4

WEIRD TALES

"and make your attempt—if it fails, we
shan’t be any the worse off.”

Twenty minutes later, the tense silence
which reigned in Piccadilly Circus was
broken by the familiar sound of fire-
engine bells. The cordons were open and
six fire engines drove into the empty Cir-
cus, Langton and the Colonel on the first.
Behind them came a procession of petrol
lorries, the tanks of which were plenti-
fully besmeared with white: these were
drawn up behind the fire engines and the
hoses were attached to the tanks.

Under the directions of Langton and
the Colonel, the firemen brought two
hoses as near as was safe to each of the
resting caterpillars.

"Aim first at their sides,” were the
Colonel’s final words to the men. "You
see those spots along each side—your ob-
ject is to hit these and keep hitting them.
They are the breathing-spiracles of the
caterpillar—if they are choked he dies. If
you can’t keep on these, work on their
heads where their sense organs are and
particularly their mouths.”

Langton himself took the first hose. At
a word from the Colonel, the pumping
began and six streams of white, thickish
liquid began to play on the creatures. At
first they disregarded the attack; then they
expressed annoyance by twitching and
moving their bodies.

"Give them a rest!” ordered the Colo-
nel. The spraying ceased and the creatures
settled down again, but in a few moments
they began to show evidences of discom-
fort. The intense heat of the midday sun
served to harden the mixture that had
been poured upon them; they began to
twitch uneasily.

At a signal from the Colonel, the
streams of white liquid were renewed. The
creatures began to thrash about and then
to move in great loops. But the moment

they tried to get into motion they were
caught by a blinding spray of the white
fluid full in the face. Clouds of spray de-
scended on the firemen and the soldiers;
the roadway was as white as if it had been
whitewashed, and in the middle of the
Circus the three creatures turned this way
and that trying to escape from their tor-
mentors. They lashed about in fury, but at
every turn they were met by a torrent of
the fluid. And in time it became evident
that their movements were becoming
sluggish; one reared itself to its full height
as if in agony and fell slowly, like a tree
collapsing under the pressure of a gale; it
lay making convulsive movements but did
not rise. The soldiers closed on it: pick-
axes and sledgehammers laid to the head
and thorax finished what the firemen had
begun. Presently its companions shared
its fate. In half an hour from the begin-
ning of the attack, the three were dead.

  An immense sigh of relief went up
from the crowd, the firemen and the men
of the army and police. They broke into
wild cheering, while the Colonel and
Langton stood wiping the stuff from their
faces. They were tired out but happy:
they had demonstrated that it was possible
to overcome this menace to the country
without danger to the lives or properties
of the people.

  The Colonel grasped Langton’s hand
and wrung it warmly.

  "That was a damned ingenious idea of
yours, my boy,” he exclaimed.

  "Only a chance thought suggested by
that fool at Wintram Hall,” said Langton,
modestly.

  "But what is the idea?” asked a voice
at his side. They swung round to find
themselves surrounded by the group they
had left at Downing Street, and it was the
Prime Minister who had asked the ques-
tion. Amongst them was the eminent
MOTH

495

biologist who had been so heavily sarcastic
at Wintram Hall about the egg which he
had been called in to examine. At him
Langton cast a look of malice before
replying.

  "Simple enough, sir,” he said, "and
your biological expert who suggested that
the egg was a plaster of Paris imitation
made by us, will be interested to hear that
what we have been spraying on these crea-
tures is, to quote his own words, 'a mate-
rial obtained by calcining gypsum until it
has become partially dehyrated, added in
certain quantities to water’.”

  "You mean plaster of Paris?”

  "Nothing else. Sprayed into the breath-
ing-tubes of these creatures, it hardens and
chokes them; it also chokes up their jaws
and mouths and gets into the joints of
their forelegs. It hardens on the outer
skin and impedes their movements—if
you can keep the application of it up long
enough, it is bound to overcome them.”

  "Well, whatever it is, you have saved
London and perhaps the whole country,
gentlemen,” said the Prime Minister,
who was deeply moved. "I can tell you
that the country will not forget your serv-
ices in this crisis or how you have both
suffered for them.”

  Langton and his friend blushed under
their coating of plaster and looked un-
comfortable.

  "You mustn’t forget that there are
about a hundred of these things loose in
London, sir,” said the Colonel. "If some
of these military gentlemen will take over
the idea from us, we’ll be glad—it took
us three days and nights to assemble a
sufficient supply of this stuff and we’re
both tired out. All I want from the coun-
try, sir, is permission to go home and
sleep.”

That was virtually the end of the
menace. The method of destroying
them had been found, and under military
control a vigorous campaign against the
invaders was established. By twos and
threes or in solitary combat against a force
that nature had not given them a defense
for, they were brought down in the streets
or in the parks, till the last of them had
been exterminated.

  How or why the parents of these broods
had reached England or where they came
from was never explained any better than
by the Colonel’s theories. No repetition
of the danger has ever taken place or
seems likely to: probably only some chance
concatenation of circumstances brought
about their descent from regions unknown
to man. The last scene of all took place
in Trafalgar Square, where the solitary
survivor of the brood that had threatened
the existence of London was finally cor-
nered.

  It was an immense creature, over thirty
feet in length. Hemmed in by its enemies
and plastered with the deadly spray that
was rapidly choking its life out of it, the
monster caught hold of the shaft of the
Nelson monument and swung itself up-
ward till its hind claspers were grasping
the top of the column. There it extended
its full length toward the fathomless blue
of the summer sky, as if imploring succor
from the regions, perhaps in the moon,
perhaps on some far planet, that were
native to it and its kind. But none came:
for a moment it swayed to and fro and
then fell with a crash to finish its death
agonies on the stone pavement of the
square. And the creatures fashioned by
nature in another mold, of another con-
sciousness and divided from it by gulfs of
impassable difference, but sharing the
same principle of life, shouted and cheered
exultantly as it stiffened into death.
The Venus of Azombeii

By CLARK ASHTON SMITH

A fascinating weird story of an African Amazon, and an agonizing poison
that shrivels its victims before it slays them

THE statuette was not more than
twelve inches in height, and repre-
sented a female figure that some-
how reminded me of the Medicean Venus,
despite many differences of feature and
proportion. It was wrought of a black
wood, almost as heavy as marble; and the
unknown artist had certainly made the
most of his material to suggest the admix-
ture of a negroid strain with a type of
beauty well-nigh classic in its perfection
of line. It stood on a pedestal formed in
imitation of a half-moon, with the cloven
side of the hemisphere constituting the
base. On studying it more closely, I found
that. the resemblance to the Venus de
Medici was largely in the pose and in the
curves of the hips and shoulders; but the
right hand was more elevated than hers
in its position, and seemed to caress the
polished abdomen; and the face was
fuller, with a smile of enigmatic voluptu-
ousness about the heavy lips, and a sensu-
ous droop to the deep eyelids, which were
like the petals of some exotic flower when
they fold beneath a sultry velvet evening.
The workmanship was quite amazing,
and would not have been unworthy of
the more archaic and primitive periods
of Roman art.

   My friend Marsden had brought the
figurine with him on his return from
Africa; and it stood always on his library
table. It had fascinated me and had stirred
my curiosity from the first; but Marsden
was singularly reticent concerning it; and
beyond telling me that it was of negro
workmanship and represented the goddess
of a little-known tribe on the upper
496

Benuwe, in Adamawa, he had so far de-
clined to gratify my inquisitiveness. But
his very reserve, and something of signif-
icant import, even of emotional perturba-
tion in his tone whenever we spoke of the
statuette, had made me believe that a
story hung thereon; and, knowing Mars-
den as I did, remembering his habitual
reticence recurrently varied by outbursts
of a well-nigh garrulous confidentiality,

I felt sure that he would tell me the story
in due time.

  I had known Marsden ever since our
school-days, for we had both been in the
same year at Berkeley. He possessed few
friends, and none, perhaps, who had been
intimate with him as long as I. So no one
was better fitted than I to perceive the in-
explicable change that had come over him
since his two years of traveling in Africa.
This change was both physical and spir-
itual, and some of its features were of so
subtle a character that one could hardly
give them a name or seize upon them with
any degree of clearness. Others, though,

. were all too plainly marked: the increase
of Marsden’s natural melancholia, turn-
ing now into fits of ferocious depression;
and the woful deterioration in his health,
never too robust even in its prime, would
have been noticeable to the merest ac-
quaintance. I remembered him as being
very tall and wiry, with a sallow com-
plexion, black hair, and eyes of a clear
azure blue; but since his return, he was
far thinner than of old, and he stooped
so much that he gave the impression of
having actually lost in height; his features
were shrunken and wrinkled, his skin had

become corpse-like in its pallor, his hair
was heavily sprinkled with gray, and his
eyes had darkened in an unaccountable
manner, as if they had somehow absorbed
the mysteriously profound and sinister
blue of tropic nights. In them, there
burned a fire that they had never before

possessed—a macabre fire such as one
would find in the eyes of a man consumed
by some equatorial fever. Indeed, it often
occurred to me that the readiest explana-
tion of the change in Marsden was that
he had been seized by some lethal sick-
ness of the jungle, from which he had not
498

WEIRD TALES

yet fully recovered. But this he had always
denied when I questioned him.

The more elusive alterations at which I
have hinted were mainly mental, and I
shall not try to define all of them. But
one, in particular, was quite signal: Mars-
den had always been a man of undoubted
courage and hardihood, with nerves that
were unshakable in spite of his melan-
cholic disposition; but now I perceived in
him at times a queer furtiveness, an un-
definable apprehensiveness quite at vari-
ance with his former character. Even in
the midst of some trivial or commonplace
conversation, a look of manifest fear
would suddenly pass over his face, he
would scrutinize the shadows of the room
with an apprehensive stare, and would
stop half-way in a sentence, apparently
forgetting what he had started to say.
Then, in a few moments, he would re-
cover himself and go on with the inter-
rupted speech. * He had developed some
odd mannerisms, too: one of them was,
that he could never enter or leave a room
without looking behind him, with the air
of a man who fears that he is being fol-
lowed or that some imminent doom is
dogging his every footstep. But all this,
of course, could have been explained as
nervousness attendant upon, or resulting
from, the illness that I suspected. Mars-
den himself would never discuss the mat-
ter; so, after a few discreet suggestions
that might have led him to unbosom him-
self, if he so wished, I had tacitly ignored
the visible changes in his manner and per-
sonality. But I sensed a real and perhaps
tragic mystery, and felt also that the black
figurine on Marsder’s table was in some
way connected with it. He had told me
much concerning his trip to Africa, which
had been undertaken because of a life-
long fascination which that continent had
held for him; but I knew intuitively that
much more was being kept back.

One morning, about six weeks after
Marsden’s return, I called to see him,
following several days of absence during
which I had been extremely busy. He was
living alone, with one servant, in the large
house on Russian Hill, San Francisco,
which he had inherited together with a
considerable fortune from his parents,
who were long dead. He did not come to
answer my knock, as was his wont; and
if my hearing were not exceptionally keen,

I do not think I should have heard the
feeble voice in which he called out, tell-
ing me to enter. Pushing open the door,
I went through the hall into the library,
from which his voice had issued, and
found him lying on a sofa, near the table
on which stood the black statuette. It was
obvious to me at a glance that he was very
ill; his thinness and pallor had increased
to a shocking degree in the few days since
I had seen him last, and I was immedi-
ately impressed by the singular fact that
he had even shrunken more in stature than
could be explained by the crouch of his
shoulders. Everything about him had
shriveled, had actually withered as if a
flame were consuming him, and the form
on the couch was that of a smaller man
than my friend. He had aged, also, and
his hair had taken on a new hoariness, as
if white ashes had fallen upon it. His
eyes were pitifully sunken, and they
burned as embers burn in deep caverns. I
could scarcely repress a cry of astonish-
ment and consternation when I saw him.

  "Well, Holly,” he greeted me, "I guess
my days are numbered. I knew the thing
would get me in time—I knew it when I
left the shores of the Benuwe with that
image of the goddess Wanaos for a keep-
sake. . . . There are dreadful things in
Africa, Holly—malignant lust, and cor-
ruption, and poison, and sorcery—things
that are deadlier than death itself—at
least, deadlier than death in any form that
we know. Don’t ever go there—if you
THE VENUS OF AZOMBEII

499

have any care for the safety of body and
soul.”

  I tried to reassure him, without paying
ostensible heed to the more cryptic refer-
ences, the more oracular hints in his utter-
ance.

  "There is some low African fever in
your system,” I said. "You should see a
doctor—should, in faa, have seen one
weeks or months ago. There’s no reason
why you shouldn’t get rid of the trouble,
whatever it is, now that you are back in
America. But of course you need expert
medical attention: you can’t afford to
neglea anything so insidious and ob-
scure.”

  Marsden smiled—if the ghastly con-
tortion of his lips could be called a smile.
"It’s no use, old man. I know my malady
better than any doctor could know it. Of
course, it may be that I have a little fever
—that wouldn’t be surprizing; but the
fever isn’t one that has ever been classi-
fier in medical lore. And there’s no cure
for it in any pharmacopoeia.”

  With the last word, his countenance
assumed a horrible grimace of pain, and
seemed to shrivel before me like a sheet
of paper that turns ashen with fire. He
no longer appeared to notice my presence,
and began to mutter brokenly, in tones
of a peculiar huskiness, in a harsh, grat-
ing whisper, as if the very cords of his
throat were involved in the same shrink-
ing that affected his face. I caught most,
if not all, of the words:

  "She is dying, too—as I am—even
though she is a living goddess. . . . My-
baloe, why did you drink the palm-wine?
. . . You, too, will shrivel up, and suffer
these gnawing, clawing tortures. . .. Your
beautiful body . . . how perfea, how
magnificent it was! . . . You will shrivel
up in a few weeks, like a little old woman
. . . you will suffer the torments of hell-
fire. . . . Mybaloe! Mybaloe!” . . .

  His speech became an indistina moan-
ing, in which portions of words were now
and then audible. He had all the aspea
of a dying man: his whole body seemed
to contract, as if all the muscles, all the
nerves, even the very bones, were dwin-
dling in size, were tightening to a locked
rigidity; and his lips were drawn in a
horrible rictus, showing a thin white line
of teeth.

  I ran to Marsden’s dining-room, where
I knew that a decanter full of old Scotch
usually stood on the sideboard, and filled
a sherry-glass with the liquor. Hastening
back, I succeeded, though with extreme
difficulty, in forcing some of the strong
spirit between his teeth. The effect was
almost immediate: he revived into full
consciousness, his facial muscles relaxed,
and he no longer wore the look of tetanic
agony that had possessed his whole body.

  "I’m sorry to have been such a bother,”
he said. "But the crisis is past for today.
. . . Tomorrow, though . . . that’ll be
another matter.” He shuddered, and his
eyes were dark with the haunting of some
incombatable horror.

  I made him drink the remainder of the
whisky, and going to the telephone, took
the liberty of summoning a doaor whose
abilities were personally known to both
of us. My friend smiled a little, in grate-
ful recognition of my solicitude, but
shook his head.

  "The end won’t be so very far off
now,” he said. "I know the symptoms;
it’s a matter of a fortnight, or little more,
when matters reach the point that they
have reached today.”

  "But what is it?” I cried. The query
was prompted by horror and solicitude,
more than curiosity.

  "You will learn soon enough,” he re-
plied, pointing to the library table with
a forefinger of skeleton thinness. "Do
you see that manuscript?”
500

WEIRD TALES

  Following his direction, I perceived on
the table, close to the wooden statuette, a
pile of written sheets, which, in my
natural concern regarding Marsden’s ill-
ness, I had not before noticed.

  "You are my oldest friend,” he went
on, "and I have been aware for quite a
while past that I owe you an explanation
of certain things that have puzzled you.
But the matters involved are so strange,
and so peculiarly intimate, that I have
been unable to bring myself to a frank
confession face to face. So I have written
for you a full narration of the final two
months of my stay in Africa, concerning
which I have spoken so little heretofore.
You are to fake it home with you when
you leave; but I must beg you not to read
the manuscript till after my death. I am
sure I can trust you to respect my wishes
in this regard. When you read it, you
■ridll learn the cause of my illness, and
the story of the black figurine which has
tantalized your curiosity so much.”

  A few minutes later, there came a
knock on the door, and I went to answer
it. As I expected, it was Dr. Felton, who
lived only a few blocks away, and who
had left home immediately in reply to my
summons. He was a brisk and confident
type of person, with the air of habitual
reassurance, of professional good cheer,
that goes so far in building up a doctor’s
reputation for proficiency. But I could see
beneath his manner an undertone of
doubt, of real bafflement, as he examined
Marsden.

  "I’m not altogether sure what is
wrong,” he admitted, "but I think the
trouble is mainly .digestive and nervous.
Doubtless the African climate, and the
food, must have upset you quite radically.
You will need a nurse, if there is any
recurrence of the attack you have had
today.”

  He wrote a prescription, and left short-

ly after. Since I had a pressing engage-
ment, I was obliged to follow him in
about half an hour, taking with me the
manuscript that Marsden had indicated.
But before going, I called a nurse by
telephone, with Marsden’s authority, and
left her in charge, promising to return as
soon as possible.

OF the fortnight that followed, with
the frightful protracted agonies, the
brief and illusory shifts for the better,
the ghastly relapses that characterized my
friend’s condition, I can not bear to write
a full account. I spent with him all the
time I could spare, for my presence
seemed to comfort him a little, except
during the awful daily crises, when he
was beyond all consciousness of his sur-
roundings. Toward the last, there were
lengthening intervals of delirium, when
he muttered wildly, or screamed aloud in
terror of things or persons visible only to
himself. To be with him, to watch him,
was an ordeal without parallel; and to
me, the most dreadful thing about it all
was the progressive shriveling, the per-
petual diminution of Marsden’s head and
body, and the lessening of his very stat-
ure, which went on hour by hour and day
by day with paroxysmal accompaniments
of a suffering not to be borne by human
flesh without lapsing into madness or
oblivion. . . . But I can not enter into
details, or describe the final stages; and I
hardly dare even hint the condition in
which he died and in which his body
went to the undertaker. I can only say
that in their extreme, their more than
infantile dwarfage and devolution of
form, the remains bore no likeness to
anything that it would be permissible to
name; also, that the task of the under-
taker and the pall-bearers was phenome-
nally light. . . . When the end came, I
gave thanks to God for the belated mercy
THE VENUS OF AZOMBEII

501

of my friend’s death. I was completely
worn out, and it was not until after the
funeral that I summoned enough energy
and resolution for a perusal of Marsden’s
manuscript.

  The account was clearly written, in a
fine, feline script, though the handwrit-
ing bore evidence of stress and agitation
toward the end. I transcribe the narrative
hereunder, with no liberties of abridg-
ment or amplification:

I JULIUS marsden, have experienced
j all my life the ineffable nostalgia of
the far-off and the unknown. I have loved
the very names of remote places, of antip-
odean seas and continents and isles. But
I have never found in any other word
even a tithe of the untellable charm that
has lain inherent for me ever since child-
hood in the three syllables of the word
Africa. They have conjured up for me,
as by some necromantic spell, the very
quintessence of all mystery, of all
romance, and no woman’s name could
have been dearer to me, or more eloquent
of delight and allure, than the name of
this obscure continent. By a happy dis-
pensation, which, alas! does not invariably
attend the fulfilment of our dreams, my
twenty-two months of sojourning in
Morocco, Tunis, Egypt, Zanzibar, Sene-
gal, Dahomey and Nigeria had in no way
disappointed me, for the reality was
astoundingly like my vision. In the hot
and heavy azure of the skies, the great
levels of desert sand or of rampant jun-
gles, the long and mighty rivers winding
through landscapes of unbelievable
diversity, I found something that was
deeply congenial to my spirit. It was a
realm in which my rarest dreams could
dwell and expand with a sense of free-
dom never achievable elsewhere.

  At the end of the twenty-second month
of my sojourn, I was traveling on the

upper reaches of the river Benuwe, that
great eastern tributary of the Niger. My
immediate objective was Lake Tchad,
with whose confluent rivers the Benuwe
is connected by means of an upland
swamp. I had left Yollah, with several
boatmen of the Foulah tribe, a race of
negroid Mohammedans, and we had now
rounded the eastern slope of Mount Al-
antika, that enormous granite bulk that
looms for nine thousand feet from the
fertile plains of Adamawa.

  It was a picturesque and beautiful
country through which we were passing.
There were occasional villages surround-
ed by fields of durra, of cotton and yams,
and great stretches of wild, luxuriant
forest, of baobabs, bananas, deleb-palms,
pandanus and plaintains, beyond which
arose the castellated tops of ridgy hills
and fantastically carven cliffs.

  Toward sunset, Alantika had become
a bluish blur in the distance, above the
green sea of the jungle. As we went
onward in our two small barges, one of
which was mainly laden with my per-
sonal effects, I perceived that my boat-
men were conversing among themselves
in low voices, and caught a frequent
repetition of the word "Azombeii,”
always with a note of fear and warning.

  I had already picked up a little of the
Foulah language; and one of the boat-
men, a tall, well-featured fellow, bronze
rather than black, was master of a sort of
broken German variegated with a few
words of English. I questioned him as to
the subject and import of the conversa-
tion, and learned that Azombeii was the
name of the district we were now ap-
proaching, which, he declared, was peo-
pled by a pagan tribe of unusual ferocity,
who were still suspected of cannibalism
and human sacrifice. They had never
been properly subdued, either by the
Mohammedan conquerors of the country
502

WEIRD TALES

or by the present German administration,
and lived very much to themselves in
their own primeval way, worshipping a
goddess named Wanaos—a goddess un-
familiar even to the other pagan tribes of
Adamawa, who were all fetishists. They
were especially inimical toward the
Mohammedan negroes, and it was peril-
ous to intrude upon their territory, par-
ticularly during the annual religious
festival now being celebrated. He and
his fellows, he confessed, were loth to
proceed much farther.

  On all this, at the time, I made no
express comment. To me, the story
seemed none too credible, and savored of
the ignorant prejudice of insular peo-
ples, who are ever suspicious and fearful
of those beyond their own borders. But
I was a little disturbed, for I did not
want the course of my journey to be sus-
pended by any difficulty with my boat-
men or the natives.

  The sun had now gone down with a
tropical abruptness, and in the brief twi-
light I saw that the forest on the river-
banks had become more dense and
exuberant than any through which we
had before passed. There were ancient
baobabs, enormous in the gloom; and the
pendant leaves of mammoth plants fell
down to the river like cataracts of em-
erald. Over all, a primordial silence
reigned—a silence fraught with the bur-
den of things unutterable by human
speech—with the furtive pulse of an
esoteric and exotic life, the secret breath-
ing of unformulable passion, of unap-
prehended peril, the spirit of a vast and
insuppressible fecundity.

We LANDED on a grassy margin, and
proceeded to make our camp for
the night. After a meal of yams and
ground-nuts and tinned meat, to which I
added a little palm-wine, I brought up

the matter of continuing our journey on
the morrow; but not until I had pledged
myself to triple the boatmen’s wages
would they promise to take me through
the Azombeii country. I was more than
ever inclined to make light of their fears,
and, in faa, had begun to suspea that
the whole business was mere play-aaing,
with no other purpose than the extortion
of an increase of pay. But this, of course,
I could not prove; and the boatmen were
full of an apparent reluaance, vowing by
Allah and his prophet Mohammed that
the danger they would incur was incom-
parably dire—that they, and even my-
self, might furnish soup-meat for the
revels of Azombeii, or smoke on a pagan
altar, before the setting of tomorrow’s
sun. They also told me some curious
details concerning the customs and beliefs
of the people of Azombeii. These people,
they said, were ruled by a woman who
was looked upon as the living representa-
tive of the goddess Wanaos, and who
shared the divine honors accorded to her.
Wanaos, as far as I could gather, ap-
peared to be a goddess of love and pro-
creation, resembling somewhat in her
character both the Roman Venus and the
Carthaginian Tanit. I was struck even
then by a certain etymological similarity
of her name to that of Venus—a similar-
ity regarding which I was soon to learn
more. She was worshipped, they told me,
with rites and ceremonies of an orgiastic
license beyond all parallel—a license
which shocked even the neighboring
pagans, who were themselves given to
vile praaises not to be tolerated by any
virtuous Moslem. They went on to say
that the Azombeiians were also addiaed
to sorcery, and that their witch-doaors
were feared throughout Adamawa.

  My curiosity was aroused, though I
told myself that in all probability the
rumors related by the boatmen were
THE VENUS OF AZOMBEII

503

fables or gross exaggerations. But I had
seen something of negro religious rites,
and was able to credit the tales of orgias-
tic excess, at any rate. Pondering the
strange stories I had heard, my imagina-
tion became excited, and I did not fall
asleep till after an unwonted interval.

  My slumber was heavy, and full of
troubled dreams that appeared to prolong
intolerably the duration of the night. I
awoke a little before dawn, when the red
horn of a waning moon had begun to
set behind the serrate edges of palm-
trees in the west. Looking about in the
half-light, with eyes that were still
bemused with sleep, I found myself en-
tirely alone: The boatmen and their
barges were gone, though all of my per-
sonal property and some of the provisions
had been left behind with an honesty
quite scrupulous, considering the circum-
stances. Evidently the fears expressed by
the Foulahs had been genuine, and dis-
cretion had overpowered their desire for
gain.

  Somewhat dismayed by the prospect
of having to continue my journey alone—
if it were to be continued at all—and
without means of navigation or convey-
ance, I stood irresolute on the river-bank,
as the dawn began to brighten. I did not
like the idea of turning back; and, since
I did not consider it at all probable that
I could be in any bodily danger at the
hands of the natives, in a region under
German rule, I finally resolved to go on
and try to engage bearers or boatmen in
the Azombeii district. It would be neces-
sary for me to leave most of my effects
by the river for the present, and return
for them later, trusting to find them un-
disturbed.

  I had no sooner made up my mind to
this course of procedure, than I heard a
soft rustling in the long grasses behind
me. Turning, I perceived that I was no

longer alone, though my companions
were not the missing Foulahs, as I had
hoped for a brief instant. Two negro
women, attired in little more than the
lightening amber air of morn, stood close
beside me. Both were fairly tall, and
well-proportioned, but it was the fore-
most of the two who caught my attention
with a veritable shock of surprize not
altogether due to the suddenness of her
approach.

Her appearance would have surprized
me anywhere, at any time. Her skin was
a lustrous velvet black, with subtle
gleams of rapid-running bronze; but all
her features and proportions, by some
astounding anomaly, were those of an
antique Venus. Indeed, I have seldom
seen in Caucasian women a more con-
summate regularity of profile and facial
contour. As she stood before me without
moving, she might have been a woman
of Rome or Pompeii, sculptured in black
marble by a statuary of the Latin deca-
dence. She wore a look that was both
demure and sensual, an expression full
of cryptic poise allied with great sweet-
ness. Her hair was done in a rich coil on
the nape of a comely neck. Between her
breasts, on a chain of beaten silver, hung
several ruddy garnets, carven with rough
intaglios whose precise nature I did not
notice at the time. Her eyes met mine
with perfect frankness, and she smiled
with an air of naive delight and mis-
chief at my all-too-obvious dumfound-
ment. That smile made me her voluntary
captive henceforward.

The second woman was of a more
negroid type, though personable enough
in her way. By her bearing and de-
meanor, she gave the impression of being
somehow subordinate to the first, and I
assumed that she was a slave or servant.
The one semblance of a garment worn by
both was a little square of cloth depend-
504

WEIRD TALES

ing in front from a girdle of palm-fiber;
but the fabric of the square worn by the
first was finer than that of the other, and
differed from it in having a fringe of
silky tassels.

The leader turned and spoke a few
words to her companion in mellifluous
liquid tones, and the servant replied in a
voice almost equally soft and musical.
The word ”Aroumani” was repeated sev-
eral times, with accompanying glances at
me, and I readily surmised that I was
the theme of their conversation. I could
not understand their speech, which bore
no likeness to the Foulah language, and,
indeed, was different from that of any
pagan tribe I had so far encountered in
Adamawa. But some of the vocables
teased me with a vague sense of familiar-
ity, though I could not define or aline
this familiarity at the moment.

I addressed the two women in the
scant Foulah that I knew, asking if they
were of the Azombeii tribe. They smiled,
and nodded their heads in recognition of
the word, and made signs to me that I
was to follow them.

The sun had now leapt above the hori-
zon, and the forest was filled with a
green and golden radiance as the women
led me away from the river-shore and
along a meandering path among gigantic
baobabs. They walked before me with a
grave and effortless grace, and the leader
looked back every now and then over her
shapely shoulder, smiling with a com-
plaisant curve of the full lips and a de-
licious droop of the carven lids that had
in them a trace of simple coquetry. I fol-
lowed, half overcome by emotions that
were new to me—by the first pulsations
of a mounting fever of the senses and the
mind, the stirring of unfamiliar curiosi-
ties, the subtle languor, the poppy-drowsy
delight of a Circean enchantment. I felt

as if the immemorial attraction of Africa
had suddenly become embodied for me
in a human shape.

  The forest began to thin, and we came
to cultivated fields, and then to a large
village of clay huts. My sable guides
pointed to the village, saying the one
word: "Azombeii,” which, as I learned
later, was the name of the principal town
as well as of the district in general.

  The place was astir with negroes, many
of whom, both male and female, were
possessed of a clear-cut type of feature
unaccountably reminiscent of the classical,
and similar to that of the two women.
Their skins varied from darkest ebony to
a sultry, tarnished copper. Many of them
crowded around us immediately, regard-
ing me with a sort of friendly inquisitive-
ness, and making signs of obeisance and
reverence before my Venus-like compan-
ion. It was clear that she occupied a
place of high importance among them,
and I wondered, not for the first time, if
she were the woman of whom the Fou-
lahs had spoken—the ruler of the Azom-
beii and the living viceregent of the god-
dess Wanaos.

  I tried to converse with the natives, but
could not make myself understood till an
old man with a bald head and a strag-
gling fringe of gray beard came forward
and hailed me in broken English. He, it
seemed, had traveled as far afield as
Nigeria during his youth, which account-
ed for his linguistic accomplishments.
None of the others had ever been more
than a few miles beyond the confines of
his own territory; and apparently the
tribe had had little intercourse with out-
siders, either negro or Caucasian.

  The old man was most affable and
loquacious, evidently delighting in an
opportunity to air his command of a for-
eign tongue. It was hardly necessary to
question him, for he began at once to
THE VENUS OF AZOMBEII

505

volunteer the information which I de-
sired. His people, he announced, were
very glad to see me, for they were friend-
ly toward the whites, though they had no
manner of use for the Moslem negroes
of Adamawa. Also, he went on, it was
manifest that I had won the favor and
protection of the goddess Wanaos, since
I appeared among them under the guid-
ance of Mybaloe, their beloved ruler, in
whom the spirit of the goddess resided.
At this, he made an humble obeisance
toward my lovely guide, who smiled, and
addressed a few sentences to him, which
he forthwith interpreted, saying that
Mybaloe had proffered me an invitation
to remain in Azombeii as her guest.

  I had intended to broach immediately
the matter of hiring bearers, or engaging
boatmen for the continuance of my jour-
ney on the Benuwe; but at this invitation,
and the sweet, wistful, almost sup-
plicating look which Mybaloe directed
upon me as her words were being trans-
lated, I forgot all about my plans, and
told the interpreter to thank Mybaloe and
say that I accepted the invitation. A few
hours earlier, I should not have dreamt
of the possibility of feeling any specific
interest in a black woman, since that
aspect of the charm of Africa was one
which had never really touched me here-
tofore. But now, the first weavings of
an unforeseen magic were upon me: my
senses had become preternaturally active,
and my normal processes of thought were
benumbed as by the working of some in-
sidious opiate. I had been eager to reach
Lake Tchad, and the idea of tarrying by
the way had never before occurred to me:
now, it seemed the most natural thing in
the world to remain in Azombeii, and
Lake Tchad became a dimly receding
mirage, far off on the borders of oblivion.

  Mybaloe’s face grew radiant as a sum-
mer morn, when my acceptance was in-

terpreted. She spoke to some of the peo-
ple about her, obviously giving them in-
structions. Then she disappeared among
the crowd, and the old interpreter, with
several others, led me to a hut which they
put at my disposal. The hut was quite
clean, and the floors were strewn with
strips of palm-leaf, which exhaled an
agreeable odor. Food and wine were set
before me and the old man and two
girls remained in attendance, saying that
they had been appointed as my servants.
I had barely finished my meal, when
some more natives entered, bearing the
belongings I had left by the river-side.

  Now, in reply to my queries, the inter-
preter, whose name was Nygaza, told me
as much as his rudimentary English
would convey regarding the history,
habits and religion of the people of
Azombeii. According to their traditions,
the worship of Wanaos among them was
almost as old as the world itself, and had
been introduced ages and ages ago by
some white strangers from the north, who
called themselves Aroumani. These stran-
gers had settled and married among the
natives, and their blood had gradually
become disseminated throughout the
whole tribe, who had always remained
apart from the other pagans of Adamawa.
All white people were called Aroumani
by them, and were looked upon with
peculiar respect, on account of these tra-
ditions. Wanaos, as the Foulahs had
said, was a deity of love and fecundation,
the mother of all life, the mistress of the
world, and her image had been accurate-
ly graven in wood by the pale strangers,
so that the Azombeiians might have an
exemplar for their idols. It had always
been customary to associate a living
woman with her worship, as a sort of
avatar or embodiment of the goddess, and
the most beautiful maiden of the district
was chosen by the priests and priestesses
506

WEIRD TALES

for this role, and filled also the office of
queen, with the privilege of taking to
herself a male consort. Mybaloe, a girl
of eighteen, had recently been elected;
and the annual festival of Wanaos, which
consisted of liberal drinking and feasting,
together with nightly ceremonies of wor-
ship, was now in progress.

  While I listened to the old man, I in-
dulged in certain speculations of a sur-
prizing order. I deemed it not impos-
sible that the pale strangers of whom he
spoke had been a party of Roman ex-
plorers, who had crossed the Sahara from
Carthage and penetrated the Sudan.
This would account for the classic fea-
tures of Mybaloe and others of the
Azombeiians, and for the name and
character of the local goddess. Also, the
vague familiarity of some of the words
spoken by Mybaloe was now explicable,
since I realized that these words had
borne a partial resemblance to Latin
vocables. Much amazed by what I had
learned and by all that I had succeeded
in piecing together, I lost myself in odd
reveries, while Nygaza continued his
babbling.

The day wore on, and I did not see
Mybaloe, as I had fully expected,
nor did I receive word from her. I began
to wonder a little. Nygaza said that her
absence was attributable only to urgent
duties; he leered discreetly, as he assured
me that I would soon see her again.

  I went for a walk through the village,
accompanied by the interpreter and the
girls, who refused to leave me for a mo-
ment. The town, as I have said, was
large for an African village, and must
have comprised two or three thousand
people. All was neat and orderly, and
the general degree of cleanliness was
quite remarkable. The Azombeiians, I
could see, were thrifty and industrious,

and gave evidence of many civilized qual-
ities.

  Toward the hour of sunset, a messen-
ger came, bearing an invitation from
Mybaloe, which Nygaza translated. I was
to dine with her in her palace, and then
attend the evening rites in the local
temple.

  The palace stood on the very outskirts
of the town, among palms and pandanus,
and was merely an overgrown hut, as
African palaces are wont to be. But the
interior proved to be quite comfortable,
even luxurious, and a certain barbaric
taste had been displayed in its furnishing.
There were low couches along the walls,
covered with draperies of native weaving,
or the skins of the ayu, a sort of fresh-
water seal found in the Benuwe. In the
center was a long table, not more than a
foot in height from the floor, around
which the guests were squatted. In one
corner, as in a niche, I noticed a small
wooden image of a female figure, which
I rightly took to be a representation of
Wanaos. The figure bore a strange re-
semblance to the Roman Venus; but I
need not describe it further, since you
have often seen it on my library table.

  Mybaloe greeted me with many com-
pliments, which were duly translated by
Nygaza; and I, not to be outdone, replied
with speeches of a flowery fervor by no
means insincere. My hostess had me
seated at her right hand, and the feast
began. The guests, I learned, were most-
ly priests and priestesses of Wanaos. All
of them regarded me with friendly smiles,
with the exception of one man, who wore
a murderous frown. This man, Nygaza
told me in a whisper almost inaudible,
was the high-priest Mergawe, a mighty
sorcerer or witch-doctor, much feared
rather than revered, who had long been in
love with Mybaloe and had hoped to be
chosen for her consort.
THE VENUS OF AZOMBEII

  As unobtrusively as I could, I surveyed
Mergawe with more attention. He was a
muscular brute, over six feet in height,
and broad without being stout. His face
was regular in outline, and would have
been handsome, were it not for the distor-
tion due to a most malignant expression.
Whenever Mybaloe smiled upon me or
addressed some remark to me through
Nygaza, his look became a demoniacal
glare. I readily perceived that the first day
of my visit in Azombeii had brought me a
powerful enemy, as well as a possible
sweetheart.

  The table was laden with equatorial
delicacies, with the meat of young
rhinoceros, several kinds of wild fowl,
bananas, papayas, and a sweet, highly in-
toxicating palm-wine. Most of the guests
were prone to gorge themselves in true
African fashion, but Mybaloe’s manner of
eating was as dainty as that of any Eu-
ropean girl, and she endeared herself to
me all the more by her restraint. Mergawe
also ate little, but drank immoderately, in
a seeming attempt to achieve inebriation
as soon as possible. The eating and drink-
ing went on for hours, but I paid less and
less attention to it and to my fellow-
guests, in the ever-growing enchantment
of Mybaloe’s presence. Her sinuous youth-
ful grace of figure, her lovely tender eyes
and lips, were far more potent than the
wine, and I soon forgot to notice even the
baleful glaring of Mergawe. On her part,
Mybaloe displayed toward me a frank
favor, swiftly conceived and avowed,
which she did not even dream of disguis-
ing. She and I began to speak a language
which did not require the interpretation
of old Nygaza. With the one exception
of Mergawe, no one seemed to regard
our mutual infatuation with anything but
approval.

  Presently the time of the evening rites
approached, and Mybaloe excused herself,

telling me that she would meet me later
in the temple. The gathering broke up,
and Nygaza led me through the nocturnal
village, where groups of people were
feasting and revelling about their fires in
the open air. We entered the jungle,
which was full of voices and flitting
shadowy forms, all on their way to the
fane of Wanaos. I had no idea what the
temple would be like, though somehow I
did not expea the usual African fetish-
house. To my surprize, it proved to be an
enormous cave in a hill back of the vil-
lage. It was illumined by many torches,
and had already become crowded with the
worshippers. At the farther end of the Htige
chamber, whose lofty vault was dark with
impenetrable shadow, there stood on a
sort of natural dais an image of Wanaos,
carved in the customary black wood of a
tree that is native to Azombeii. The image
was somewhat more than life-size. Beside
it, on a wooden seat that could easily have
accommodated another person, sat Myba-
loe, statuesque and immobile as the god-
dess herself. Fragrant leaves and grasses
were burning on a low altar, and tom-
toms were throbbing with delirious insist-
ence, regular as the beating of turgid
pulses, in the gloom behind the goddess
and her mortal viceregent. The priests,
priestesses and devotees were all naked,
except for little squares of cloth similar to
that worn-by Mybaloe, and their bodies
gleamed like polished metal in the wild-
ly flickering light of the torches. All were
chanting a solemn monotonous litany,
and they swayed in the slow movements
of a hieratic dance, lifting their arms
toward Wanaos, as if to invoke her favor.

  There was an undeniable impressive-
ness about it all; and as if by contagion,
a bizarre excitement began to invade me,
and something of the sacred fervor felt
by the devotees found its way into my
own blood. With eyes intent upon
508

WEIRD TALES

Mybaloe, who seemed to be in a veritable
trance, unconscious or unheedful of all
about her, I felt the resurgence of ata-
vistic impulses, of barbaric passions and
superstitions latent in the subterranean
depths of being. I knew the promptings
of a savage hysteria, of a lust both ani-
mal and religious.

The old interpreter, who had disap-
peared in the throng, returned to my side
anon, saying that Mybaloe had requested
that I come forward to her seat. How
the request had been communicated I can
not imagine, for surely her lips had never
opened or moved beneath my intent and
passionate watching. The worshippers
made way for me, and I stood before
her, thrilling almost with a kind of awe,
as well as a frenetic desire, when I met
her eyes that were filled by the solemn
possession of the amorous deity. She
motioned me to seat myself beside her.
By this act, as I learned later, she selected
me before all the world as her consort,
and I, by accepting the invitation, became
her official lover.

Now, as if my enthronement with
Mybaloe were a signal, the ceremonies
took on a new excitation, with an or-
giastic trend at which I can only hint.
Things were done at which Tiberias
would have blushed: Elephantis itself
could have learned more than one secret
from these savages. The cavern became
a scene of indiscriminate revel, and the
goddess and her representative were alike
forgotten in the practise of rites that
were doubtless appropriate enough, con-
sidering the nature of Wanaos, even
though they were highly improper from
a civilized viewpoint. Through it all,
Mybaloe maintained a perfect immobil-
ity, with open eyes whose lids were still
as those of the statue. At last she arose
and looked around the cavern upon her
oblivious devotees with a gaze that was

wholly inscrutable. Then she turned to
me, with a demure smile and a slight
movement of the hand, and beckoned me
to follow her. Unnoticed by any one, we
left the orgies and came forth upon the
open jungle, where warm gusts of per-
fume wandered beneath the tropical
stars. . . .

From that night there began for me a
new life—a life which I will not try
to defend, but will only describe, as far
as any description is possible. I had never
before conceived of anything of the sort;
I should never have believed myself
capable of the sensuous fervor I felt for
Mybaloe, and the almost inenarrable ex-
periences into which her love initiated
me. The dark electric vitality of the very
earth upon which I trod, the humid
warmth of the atmosphere, the life of the
swiftly grown luxuriant plants, all became
an intimate part of my own entity, were
mingled with the ebb and flow of my
blood, and I drew nearer than ever before
to the secret of the charm that had lured
me across the world to that esoteric con-
tinent. A powerful fever exalted all my
senses, a deep indolence bedrugged my
brain. I lived, as never before, and never
again, to the full capacity of my corporeal
being. I knew, as an aborigine knows,
the mystic impact of perfume and color
and savor and tactual sensation. Through
the flesh of Mybaloe, I touched the primal
reality of the physical world. I had no
longer any thoughts, or even dreams, in
the abstract meaning of such terms, but
existed wholly in relation to my surround-
ings, to the diurnal flux of light and
darkness, of sleep and passion, and all
sensory impressions.

  Mybaloe, I am sure, was indeed lov-
able, and her charm, though highly
voluptuous, was not altogether of the
body. She had a fresh and naive nature,
THE VENUS OF AZOMBEII

509

laughter-loving and kindly, with less of
actual or latent cruelty than is common
to the African. And always I found in
her, even apart from her form and fea-
tures, a delightful suggestion of the elder
pagan world, a hint of the classic woman
and the goddess of old myths. Her sor-
cery, perhaps, was not really complex; but
its power was complete, and lay as far
beyond analysis as beyond denial. I
became the ecstatic slave of a loving and
indulgent queen.

  The flowers of an equatorial spring
were now in bloom, and our nights were
opiate or aphrodisiac with their fragrance.
The nocturnal heavens were full of fervid
stars, the noons were balmy and pro-
pitious, and the people of Azombeii
looked with favor upon our love, since
the will of Mybaloe was to them the will
of the goddess.

  One cloud alone—a cloud which we
scarcely regarded at first—was visible in
our firmament. This cloud was the jeal-
ousy and ill-will of Mergawe, the high-
priest of Wanaos. He glowered with a
lethal malignity, sullen as a negro Satan,
whenever I happened to meet him; but
his ill-will was not otherwise demon-
strated, either by word or act; and Ny-
gaza and Mybaloe both assured me that
overt hostility on his part would be most
improbable at any time, since, because
of Mybaloe’s divine office and my posi-
tion as her lover, anything of the sort
would savor of actual blasphemy.

  As for me, I felt an intuitive distrust of
the sorcerer, though I was far too happy
to expend much thought on the problem
of his potential maleficence. However,
the man was an interesting type, and his
reputation was literally something with
which to conjure. People believed that he
knew the language of animals, and could
even hold converse with trees and
stones, which accorded him whatever in-

formation he might require. He was
reputed to be a master of what is known
as "bad fetish”—that is to say, he could
lay an evil spell on the person or posses-
sions of whosoever had incurred his
enmity. He was a practitioner of in-
vultuation, and was also said to know the
secret of a terrible slow poison, which
caused its victims to wither up and shrivel
to the stature of a new-born child, with
prolonged and hellish agonies—a poison
which did not begin to operate for weeks
or even months after the time of its con-
sumption.

  The days went by, and I lost all proper
count of their passage, reckoning time
only by the hours I spent with Mybaloe.
The world and its fullness were ours—
ours were the deep-blue heavens and the
flowering forest and the grassy meadows
by the riverside. As lovers are prone to
do, we found for ourselves more than one
favorite haunt, to which we liked to re-
pair at recurrent intervals. One of these
haunts was a grotto behind the cave-
temple of Wanaos, in whose center was
a great pool fed by the river Benuwe
through subterranean channels. At some
remote time, the roof of the grotto had
broken in, leaving a palm-fringed aper-
ture in the hill-top, dirough which the
sunlight or moonlight fell with precipi-
tate rays upon the somber waters. Around
the sides there were many broad ledges
and fantastic alcoves of columnar stone.
It was a place of weird beauty, and
Mybaloe and I had spent more than one
moon-lit hour on the couch-like shelves
above the pool. The waters were in-
habited by several crocodiles, but of these
we took little heed, absorbed in each
other and in the bizarre loveliness of the
grotto, that always changed with the
changing light.

  One day, Mybaloe had been sum-
moned away from the village on some
510

WEIRD TALES

errand whose nature I can not now re-
member. Doubtless it concerned some
problem of justice or native politics. At
any rate, she was not expected back till
the following noon. Therefore, I was
quite surprized when a messenger came
to me at evening, with word that Mybaloe
would return sooner than she had
planned, and that she requested me to
meet her in the grotto behind the cave
of Wanaos at the hour when the rays of-
the moon, now slightly gibbous, would
first fall through the opening above. The
native who brought the message was a
man I had never seen before, but of this
I thought nothing, since he purported to
come from the outlying village to which
Mybaloe had been called.

1 reached the cavern at the hour ap-
pointed, and paused on the verge of
one of the ledges, looking about in the
uncertain light for Mybaloe. The moon
had begun to pour a faery radiance over
the rough edge of the pit in the cavern-
dome. I saw a stealthy movement in the
waters beneath me, where a crocodile slid
through the silver-gleaming ebony of the
surface; but of Mybaloe herself I could
find no visible sign anywhere. I won-
dered if she were not hiding from me in
some prankish mood, and resolved to
make a search of the alcoves and shelves
on tiptoe, in order to surprize her.

  I was about to leave the ledge on which
I stood, when I received a violent push
from behind, which precipitated me with
a headlong suddenness into the black pool
seven or eight feet below. The waters
were deep, and I sank almost to the
bottom before I recovered myself or even
realized what had happened. Then I rose
and struck out blindly for the shore, re-
membering with a thrill of terror the
crocodile I had seen a moment before my
fall. I reached the edge, where it shelved

down with accessible gradations, but the
water was still deep, and my fingers
slipped on the smooth stone. Behind me,

I heard a furtive rippling, and knew its
causation all too well. Turning my head,

I saw two of the great saurians, whose
eyes burned with unholy phosphorescence
in the moonlight as they glided toward
me.

  I think that I must have cried aloud;
for, as if in answer, I heard a woman’s
voice cry out on the ledge above, and
then the rippled waters were cleft by a
falling form that shone for an instant
with a flash as of black marble. A breath-
less interval, while the waters foamed,
and then a well-known head arose beside
me, and an arm that held aloft a glitter-
ing knife. It was Mybaloe herself. With
miraculous adroitness, she drove the knife
to its hilt in the side of the foremost
crocodile, as the monster opened his
formidable jaws to seize me. Her stroke
had found the heart, and the crocodile
slipped back beneath the surface, thrash-
ing about in a brief agony. But its com-
panion came on without pausing, and
met the same unerring thrust of Myba-
loe’s knife. There were stirrings in the
pool, and the dark bodies of others began
to appear. With a superhuman agility,
in what was seemingly no more than a
single movement, Mybaloe drew herself
out on the rocks of the margent, and
caught my hands in hers. An instant
more, and I stood beside her, hardly
knowing how I had come there, so light
and swift had been my ascent. The croco-
diles were nosing the shore beneath us
when I turned to look back.

  Breathless and dripping, we sat on a
moon-bright shelf of the cavern and
began to question each other, with tender
interludes of silence and caresses. In a
few weeks, I had learned much of the
THE VENUS OF AZOMBEII

511

Azombeiian tongue, and we no longer
required an interpreter at any time.

  To my astonishment, Mybaloe denied
having sent me a messenger that evening.
She had returned because of an over-
whelming premonition of some imminent
evil that menaced me, and had felt her-
self drawn irresistibly to the grotto, ar-
riving just in time to find me floundering
in the pool. While passing through the
cave of Wanaos, from which a low
tunnel led to the open grotto, she had
met a man in the darkness, and thought
that it might have been Mergawe. He
had passed without speaking, in as much
haste as Mybaloe herself. I told her of
the push I had received from behind as I
stood on the ledge. It was all too evi-
dent that I had been lured to the cavern
by some one who desired to make away
with me; and, as far as we knew, Mer-
gawe was the one person in Azombeii
capable of conceiving or nurturing such
a motive. Mybaloe became very grave,
and little more was said between us re-
garding the matter.

  After our return to the village, My-
baloe sent several men to search for
Mergawe and bring him before her. But
the sorcerer had disappeared, and no one
could tell his whereabouts, though more
than one person had seen him earlier in
the evening. He did not return to his
dwelling on the morrow; and though a
sedulous and thorough quest was insti-
tuted throughout the whole of Azombeii,
no trace of him could be found during
the days following. His very disappear-
ance, of course, was taken for an implicit
confession of guilt. Supreme indignation
was rife among the people when the
episode in the grotto became publicly
known; and, in spite of the fear his
reputation had evoked, Mergawe would
have fared disastrously at their hands,
and the sentence of death pronounced

against him by Mybaloe would have been
needless, if he had dared to show him-
self among his fellow-tribesmen.

  The unexpected peril I had faced, and
the marvelous rescue effected by Mybaloe,
served to draw us even closer together,
and our passion found a new depth and
gravity henceforward. But as time went
on, and nothing was heard of Mergawe,
who seemed to have been swallowed up
by the wide and sultry silence of the
equatorial spaces, the episode began to
recede, and gradually dwindled to our
view in a lengthening perspective of
blissful days. We ceased to apprehend
any further attempt at harm on the part
of the witch-doctor, and were lulled to
an indolent security, in which our happi-
ness took on the hues of its maturing
summer.

One night, the priests of Wanaos were
giving a dinner in my honor. Forty
or fifty people were already gathered in
a banqueting-hall not far from the tem-
ple, but Mybaloe had not yet arrived. As
we sat awaiting her, a man entered, bear-
ing a large calabash full of palm-wine.
The man was a stranger to me, though
he was evidently known to some of the
people present, who hailed him by name,
calling him Marvasi.

  Addressing me, Marvasi explained
that he had been sent by the people of
an outland community with a gift of
palm-wine, which they hoped that I, as
the consort of Mybaloe, would deign to
accept. I thanked him, and bade him
convey my acknowledgment to the donors
of the wine.

  "Will you not taste the wine now?” he
said. "I must return immediately; but
before leaving, I should like to learn if
the gift meets with your approval, so that
I can tell my people.”

  I poured out some of the wine into a
512

WEIRD TALES

cup and drank it very slowly, as one does
in testing the savor and quality of a bev-
erage. It was quite sweet and heavy,
with a peculiar after-flavor of puckerish
bitterness which I did not find altogether
agreeable. However, I praised the wine,
not wishing to hurt Marvasi’s feelings.
He grinned with apparent pleasure at my
words, and was about to depart, when
Mybaloe entered. She was panting with
haste, her expression was both wild and
stern, and her eyes blazed with un-
natural fire. Rushing up to me, she
snatched the empty wine-cup from my
fingers.

  "You have drunk it?” she cried, in a
tone of statement more than of query. .

  "Yes,” I replied, in great wonder and
perplexity.

  The look that she turned upon me was
indescribable, and full of conflicting el-
ements. Horror, agony, devotion, love
and fury were mingled in it, but I knew
somehow that the fury was not directed
toward me. For one intense moment her
eyes held mine; then, averting her face,
she pointed to Marvasi and bade the
priests of Wanaos to seize and bind him.
The command was instantly obeyed. But
before offering any explanation, and
without saying a word to me or to any-
one, Mybaloe poured out a cupful of the
palm-wine and drank it at a single draft.
Beginning to suspect the truth, I would
have seized it from her hand, but she
was too quick for me.

  "Now we will both die,” she said,
when she had emptied the cup. For a
moment, her face assumed a tranquil
smile, then it became the countenance of
an avenging goddess as she turned her at-
tention to the wretched Marvasi. Every
one present had now surmised the truth,
and mutterings of rage and horror were
heard on all sides. Marvasi would have
been torn limb from limb, joint from

joint, muscle from muscle, by the bare
hands of the priests if it had not been
for Mybaloe, who intervened and told
them to wait. Stricken with abject ter-
ror, the man cowered among his captors,
knowing too well the manner of doom
that would be meted out to him in spite
of any momentary reprieve.

  Mybaloe began to interrogate him in
brief, stern sentences, and Marvasi, whose
awe of her was even more patent than his
fear of the priests, made answer with
many stammerings as he cringed and
fawned. He confessed that the wine was
poisoned; also, that he had been hired by
the sorcerer and high-priest Mergawe to
proffer it to me and see that I drank some
of it at once, if possible. Mergawe, he
said, had been hiding in the forest on the
borders of Azombeii for weeks, living in
a secret cavern known only to himself
and a few adherents, who had brought
him food and such news as he desired to
learn. Marvasi, who was under certain
intimate obligations to Mergawe, and
had been used by him as a tool on other
occasions, was one of these adherents.

  "Where is Mergawe now?” questioned
Mybaloe. Marvasi would have hesitated,
but the eyes of the queen, ablaze with
anger and with superhuman mesmerism,
dragged the very truth from his reluctant
lips. He said that Mergawe was now
lurking in the jungle, on the outskirts of
the town of Azombeii, waiting for assur-
ance that the poison had been drunk by
its intended victim.

  A number of the priests were at once
dispatched to find Mergawe. While they
were absent, Mybaloe told me how warn-
ing of the plan to poison me had been
brought to her by another of Mergawe’s
friends, who had recoiled at the final
hour from the atrociousness and audacity
of such a design.

  The priests returned in a little while,
                     W. T.—5
THE VENUS OF AZOMBEII

513

bringing the captive sorcerer. They had
succeeded in coming upon him unaware,
and though he struggled with demoniacal
strength and fury, they bore him down
and bound him with thongs of rhinoc-
eros hide. They brought him into the
banqueting-hall amid a horror-frozen
silence.

   In spite of his desperate predicament,
the face of the sorcerer was full of a
malevolent triumph, as he stood before
us. Proud, and superbly erect, he gave no
evidence of fear, but his mien proclaimed
the Satanic possession of an evil exulta-
tion. Before Mybaloe could question or
address him, he began to pour forth a
torrent of dreadful mouthings, inter-
mingled with maledictions and vitupera-
tions. He told us how he had prepared
the poison, he enumerated the fearsome
ingredients, the slowly chanted and leth-
iferous runes, the manifold and mighty
power of the baleful fetishes that had
gone into or had helped in its making.
Then he described the action of the
poison, the preliminary months during
which Mybaloe and I would suffer in-
numerable pangs, would die uncounted
deaths in our anticipation of the deferred
agonies to come; and then the intermi-
nable tortures themselves, the slow and
hideous contraction of all our fibers, all
our organs, the drying-up of the very
sources of life, and the shrinkage to in-
fantile, or even pre-infantile, stature and
dimensions before the relief of death.
Forgetful of all but his mad hatred, his
insensate jealousy, he lingered over these
details, he repeated them again and again
with so vile a gloating, so horrible and
rapturous a relish, that a sort of paralyz-
ing spell was laid upon the assembly, and
no one stepped forward to silence him
with a knife or a spear.

   At last, while his mouthings continued,
Mybaloe filled another cup with the

poisoned wine; and while the priests
held Mergawe and forced his teeth apart
with their spear-blades, she poured the
wine down his throat. Oblivious or con-
temptuous of his doom, he betrayed no
slightest quiver or shrinking of fear, but
glared with that awful look of exultation
all the while, like a black fiend who re-
joices over the damned, even though he
himself is numbered among them. Mar-
vasi was also compelled to drink the
wine, and he cringed and cried with
terror, frothing at the mouth when the
lethal liquor touched his tongue. Then
the two men, by Mybaloe’s order, were
led away and imprisoned, and were left
under a strong guard to await the work-
ing of the poison. But later in the night,
when their deed became known to the
populace, a multitude of men and women,
maddened beyond all measure or control,
broke in and overpowered the guards and
carried Marvasi and Mergawe to the
grotto behind the cave of Wanaos, where
they were flung like offal to the croco-
diles in the black pool.

   Now, for Mybaloe and me, there began
a life of indepictable horror. Dead was
all our former joy and happiness, for the
blackness of the doom to come lay on us
like the charnel shadow cast by the gath-
ering of a myriad vultures. Love, it is
true, was. still ours, but love that already
seemed to have entered the hideous gloom
and nothingness of the grave. . . . But of
these things I can not tell you, though I
have told you so much. . . . They were
too sacred and too terrible. . . .

   After the leaden lapse of funereal
days, beneath heavens from which for us
the very azure had now departed, it was
agreed between Mybaloe and me that I
should leave Azombeii and return to my
native land. Neither of us could bear the
thought of having to witness day by day
514

WEIRD TALES

the eventual torments and progressive
physical disintegration of the other when
Mergawe’s poison began to operate. Of
our farewell meeting, I can say only that
it was infinitely sorrowful, and that I
shall remember the love and grief in
Mybaloe’s eyes amid the culminative
pangs and disordered illusions of my last
delirium. Before I left, she gave me for
a keepsake the little image of Wanaos,
concerning which you have asked me so
often.

  It is needless to detail my return to

America. Now, after months of a delay
that has had in it nothing of mercy or
mitigation, I feel the first workings of the ■
poison; I have recognized all its pre-
liminary symptoms, and the sickening
expectations of haunted days and sleep-
forbidden nights are being realized. And
knowing all that is yet to come, and see-
ing with a clarity of imaginative vision
that sears my soul the coincidental
agonies of Mybaloe, I have begun to envy
the death of Marvasi and Mergawe in the
pool of crocodiles.

  The Seeds of Death

By DAVID H. KELLER

A powerful mystery story of man-eating orchids and a beautiful tiger-woman
who lived in a castle in Spain

THE Duke of Freud was distinctly
unhappy. He had spent a year’s in-
come in entertaining one lady who
had been so unappreciative that she de-
parted for Paris at the end of the week,
leaving the duke absolutely alone in New
York. The worst part about the whole
affair was his gradually appreciating that
she had engaged her passage a week
before she vowed eternal devotion to him.
Irrespective of anything that he might do,
the duke realized that his bankers would
make him no further advances for at
least another year. The world was indeed
dreary. Other ladies would be impossible
without more money.

  The Spanish ambassador gave a very
profuse denial to his telegraphed request
for a loan. The hotel where he had
luxuriated since his arrival in New York
became suspicious and sternly asked for

a settlement in full. Finally, the duke
walked out on the sidewalk, a free man,
but all of his baggage and much of his
jewelry remained in the hotel. For the
first time in his life the duke was without
visible means of support. The manager
of the hotel had promised to let him
occupy his room for a few more days, but
there were to be no more wonderful
meals served there.

The duke visited a three-ball shop and
pawned some jewelry that he had man-
aged to conceal from the hotel manage-
ment. Then he bought some hard bread
and several evening papers and returned
to his room. For the first time in his life
he read over the "Help Wanted” section.
This innovation was more successful than
he had thought was possible. There was
actually an advertisement in Spanish,
asking for a personal interview, with pros-
THE SEEDS OF DEATH

515

pea of interesting service in Spain. A
telephone number was given, which was
to be used that evening only between the
hours Of eight and ten. This gave the
duke ample cause for refleaion as he
munched the hard bread and drank ice-
water.

  It was a day of surprizes. It started in
the morning with the unexpeaed de-
sertion of the lady and it ended at nine
that evening with a visit from the gentle-
man who had inserted the advertisement.

  James Garey lost no time in giving the
reason for the visit.

  "I am looking for a man,” he said,
"who is not afraid to die.”

  "You have found him!” answered the
duke, shrugging his shoulders. "In my

present condition I am better off dead
than alive. Of course,” he said refleaive-
ly, "it all depends on the manner of the

death.”

  "That is the bad part of it,” the New
Yorker said. "I think that death is there
waiting, but I am not sure of what form
it takes. It is a peculiar story; in faa, it
may be that you will find it even stranger
than I do, or you may understand it. I
had a brother who had everything in life
to live for—and he went to Spain—to
visit a lady there—and he never came
back. Several other men that I have heard
of have visited that lady, and they have
never come back. The American ambas-
sador to Spain has investigated the mat-
ter; in fiaa, he has personally been to see
516

WEIRD TALES

the lady, and his report is a most inter-
esting one. She admits that these men
have visited her, she even shows where
they signed her guest book, and in every
case she proves that in a few days they
left her castle in their automobiles. She
regrets their disappearance; she cries
pathetically as she recalls how happy
they were when they left and how they
promised to visit her again on their re-
turn to Spain. The lady is very wealthy,
belongs to one of the oldest families in
Spain and, thus, there can be no question
of robbery. She is said to be well chap-
eroned, as are all the Spanish ladies, and
she made a very favorable impression on
the ambassador; so much so that he
scouted the idea of foul play.

  "I loved my brother, and I believe that
he died in that castle. I also think that
the other men died there. So I am going
to visit her, and I want you to follow me.
Four days after I enter that castle I want
you to visit the lady, and I want you to
find out what happened to my brother. If
I am alive, I will help you; if 1 am dead,
it may make it easier for you to solve the
problem of my brother, for the trail will
be fresher. You will, of course, under-
stand that you are likely to die in the
same way that these other men have died.”
"I wonder if I know the lady,” the
duke mused.

  "It may be that you do. Her name is
Helen Moyennes. She seems to have
some kind of a title, lots of money, and
she lives in a very old castle on the moun-
tain top of Andorra.”

  "Helen,” replied the duke, "is not a
Spanish name.”

  "Perhaps not, and, perhaps the only
reason she is called a Spanish lady is be-
cause she lives in Spain. She is a brunette
of uncertain age, and the ambassador, in
a personal letter to me, commented on her
beauty.”

  "I do not know her,” said the duke. "I
know a good many beautiful ladies, but
not this one. The last one I knew left for
Paris this morning with jewels that cost
me a year’s income. That is why I an-
swered your message in the newspaper. I
will go on this adventure with you. If the
lady kills me, she will be the first lady
who has done so. I suppose that this
ambassador will provide me with letters
of introduction, and you will have to get
my clothes and jewelry out of pawn; at
present, the hotel holds them as security.”
"I will get them for you, and for the
rest of your time in New York you may
stay with me as my guest. I am busy in
the daytime, but every night for the next
week we will talk over our plans. We
will leave for Spain in a week. In the
meantime, I will make you an advance of
five thousand dollars, and you can go
ahead and have as good a time as you
want in the daytime. This may be your
last visit to New York.”

  "You are not very cheerful.”

  "I have no reason to be. Frankly, I be-
lieve there is a good chance that I shall
die in that castle; you may die there; I
hope that one of us will clear up the
mystery of my brother’s death. Then,
there are some more men, like Southward
of Atlanta and Serriano of Boston. There
is one odd thing about these men that
have disappeared, and that is, they were
all fine specimens of manhood, and they
were all traveling by themselves. For
some reason all were in automobiles with-
out chauffeurs. They went to that castle;
there seems to be proof that they left the
castle—at least that is the statement that
the lady and her servants make; and then
they simply dropped out of existence.
How does it look to you?”

  "I do not think they left the castle,”
answered the duke.

  "Do you think that they are dead?”
THE SEEDS OF DEATH

517

  "Either dead, prisoners, or so happy
that they are willing to shut themselves
off from all communication with the
world.”

  The New Yorker shook his head.
"They may be dead, or they may be
prisoners, but these men are not staying
there voluntarily. There are too many of
them—they would be jealous of each
other.”

  "Not if this Helen were a Messalina,
or a Circe.”

  "No. She is not that. If she is, she has
the ambassador badly fooled. Besides, I
know my brother. He was not averse to
a love affair with a lady, but he never
would allow a rival in the field. If ever
there was a jealous man in regard to the
ladies, it was my brother. I can imagine
him staying in that castle a lifetime with
this Helen, but not a minute after he
found out that there were other men
there. If he is there, he is kept there,
either dead or a prisoner.”

  "Time will tell about this Helen,”
sighed the duke. "You are sure she is
beautiful?”

  "Absolutely.’*

  "That one fact makes the adventure at-
tractive. Suppose you stop at the desk on
your way out and rescue my trunks. To-
night I spend here. Tomorrow I come to
your abode as your humble guest. A
month from now we may dine in Para-
dise; but tonight I shall rest better if I
have on my silken pajamas.”

For the next week the evenings were
spent in planning the Spanish adven-
ture. A hundred suggestions were made,
only to be discarded. Finally, they saw
what they had dimly seen from the first.
James Garey would visit this lady as her
house guest. During those four days he
would try to solve the mystery of his
brother’s disappearance. On the fifth day

the Duke of Freud would arrive at the
castle. He would either meet James
Garey or he would not. If he did not,
then he could take it for granted that the
New Yorker had fallen a victim to the
same fate that had overcome his brother,
the same that had been the undoing of
Southward of Atlanta and Serriano of
Boston, and other good men. One plan
that was suggested was finally adopted.
James Garey was to wear a ring with a
large stone. This stone had a peculiar
property. When rubbed against other
stone or wood, it left no mark. When,
however, the moist skin, as the palm or
finger tips, rested on this place, a red
stain appeared on the skin. The two men
tried it, and when Garey carefully wrote
"Death” on the top of the mahogany
table and the duke carefully pressed the
palm of his hand on this spot, then the
word "Death” appeared in red letters on
his hand.

  "That works very well,” commented
Garey, "and the average person would be-
lieve that in this ring we had a very val-
uable way of communication, but, in re-
ality, I doubt its real worth to us. I could
not write messages all over a castle with-
out being seen, and if I only wrote in a
few places, you would never know where
those places were and would find them
only by accident. If we both knew the
castle, it would be different. As it is, the
best we can do is to presume that there
is one special guest room, and if, when
you come, you have the good fortune to
be placed in the same room that I slept in,
you will find a message from me on the
wall above the door.”

During the next week the duke had
to find some occupation for his
days, the evenings being spent in appar-
ently useless conferences with his fellow
adventurer. The duke was a peculiar com-
518

WEIRD TALES

bination of globe-trotter, scholar and lib-
ertine. Naturally, he drifted in these idle
moments to Broadway, and there, on the
first day of his new life with Garey, a
sharper fleeced him out of a hundred dol-
lars by means of the old familiar shell
game. One pea and three walnut shells
and "You can see where I put the pea,
gentlemen; now back up your confidence
in yourself with a small bet.” The duke
was interested, and envious. It pained
him to think that any one could work a
trick like that on him; so he took the
sharper into his confidence, showed him
several unusual card tricks and offered
him another hundred if he would teach
him the trick. He saw possibilities in
this as a valuable help in times of future
financial stringency, and he was confident
that such times would come.

He spent several hours with the shell
man and then started to practise. Again
and again he flipped the pea where he
wanted it. For the next six days he prac-
tically lived with a pea and three walnut
shells in front of him on a table. He
practised on the servants in the Garey
household and finally was able to deceive
even the butler. Then he tried the game
on his employer, and that worthy was
willing to admit that it was impossible to
keep his eye on the pea with any degree
of accuracy. By the time the two men
sailed for England, the duke was so
proficient that he was able to make a con-
siderable sum on the voyage—of course,
in a very gentlemanly way.

The plan of action determined on by
the two men was as follows: Garey was
going to the castle in Andorra via Paris;
the duke was to go by way of Barcelona.
Their date of departure from London was
so timed that the duke would arrive at
the castle exactly four days after Garey.
After leaving London, the two men were
not going to communicate with each

other. According to their program, the
schedule seemed fool-proof. As a final
protection, a complete statement of the
entire plan, with Garey’s suspicions, and
a complete program of the intended in-
vestigation, were sent in a sealed envelope
to the American ambassador at Madrid,
with the request that it be opened and
acted on if neither Garey nor the Duke of
Freud called at the ambassador’s office be-
fore a certain date.

  The parting at London was rather dull.
Both men were depressed. In the short
time that they had been associated with
each other they had developed a decided
friendship. They were drawn together by
a sense of impending danger. The duke
became almost melodramatic in his pro-
fuse promises to leave no stone unturned
to unravel the mystery and, if necessary,
to avenge the threatened death of James
Garey. So they said good-bye.

Some weeks later the Duke of Freud
slowly drove his Isotta-Fraschini up
the winding mountain road that led to
the castle in Andorra, occupied by the fair
Helen Moyennes. In his pocket he car-
ried a letter of introduction from the
American ambassador; on his Fedora a
small blue-bird feather shone in the cold
clear sunlight, and in his breast his heart
beat almost as fast as the slow explosion
of his engine—for the path was so steep
that even his powerful car was forced to
go up on low gear. A little village hud-
dled, as though in fear, at the bottom of
this mountain. The duke considered
pausing a few minutes to obtain the re-
action of these mountain folk to the grand
lady who lived, in every way, above them,
on the top of the mountain; however, he
ended by driving through without a stop.

  Accustomed though he was to Spanish
architecture, this castle impressed him as
being somewhat out of the usual, a castle
THE SEEDS OF DEATH

519

so old as to be dninfluenced by the Moor-
ish occupancy of Spain, a large pile of
stone so massive that it towered above the
peak, and yet the individual rock was so
weatherbeaten and covered with moss and
fern that at some turns of the winding
road it came into sudden view, not as a
castle, but rather as a part of the ageless
mountain. There may have been windows
in the walls, but these were so narrow
and the walls so thick that they showed
as lines rather than modern apertures.

  The duke had spent a few hours talk-
ing with a celebrated Spanish historian
about this castle. The opinion given by
this antiquarian was that the building
was very old. In some respects the archi-
tecture was Norman; in other ways the
Gothic influence showed; and the best
description available included a row of
columns that were said to be Roman. It
seems that no one had occupied the place
for many years, and then this very rich
lady, Helen Moyennes, had bought the
place and had now lived there for five
years. No one that the duke talked to in
Madrid seemed to know much about this
new owner of the castle. Even the police
department had no knowledge of her past
and very little of her present. She spent
money lavishly and was very prompt in
paying her bills. Also, in some way, she
had powerful political influence. That
was all that the duke found out about
her.

  Now, he was going up to the castle
and, for all he knew, he might never
come down again.

  All the men that had gone up that
road had been well educated; some of
them had, by their personal efforts, be-
come rich. There was not one fool among
them, and yet, none of them had come
back.

  What had happened to them? Were
they staying there in the castle from
choice?

  Or were they dead?

  He came near the top of the moun-
tain just as the sun was sinking for its
long night’s rest. Streaks of light hov-
ered in long neurasthenic fingers on the
castle walls, throwing the ancient rocks
into every possible shade of syncopating
grays. A low wind, moaning upward
from the valley, whined miserably around
the massive walls. The road came to an
abrupt pause before a great gateway with
a Gothic arch, its deep shadows showing
the wonderful thickness of the walls.
The gate was shut. The engine puttered
to a pause, and silence hovered over the
castle, with the downy wings of twilight
teasing the anxious mind to thoughts of
depressed mystery.

  The duke had, in his youth, received
an excellent literary education. Now,
lines from the deep well of his subcon-
scious came over his mental threshold—
Childe Roland to the dark tower came—
fee, fie, fo, fum, I smell the blood of an
Englishman—and blew his horn! With-
out being really aware of what he was
doing he looked in back of him to see
if there was room to swing his automo-
bile around and start down the hill.
There was no one there to see him; ap-
parently his arrival had not been noticed.
While he was thinking these thoughts,
he saw the great gate divide in the mid-
dle and slowly swing open. Apparently
he had been seen and die way had been
provided for him to drive into the court-
yard.

  Starting the car, he glided into the
courtyard and stopped. A noise made
him look backward, and the gate was al-
ready closing.

  "The lady wants to keep me,” the duke
muttered to himself.

  And then an old woman came from a
little doorway toward the car. In Span-
ish she asked him to follow her. He
520

WEIRD TALES

pretended not to understand, and she re-
peated the request in very good English.
The duke shrugged his shoulders, and
thought that it was very much like a page
out of Perrault’s fairy-tales.

  The old dame took him to a bedroom
that was a curious combination of the
very old and the ultramodern. For in-
stance, a completely furnished bathroom
provided every possible convenience to
the dusty traveler. A sad-faced valet was
in attendance, and the duke’s baggage
had bean brought up with him and was
being unpacked by die black-clothed ser-
vant. The sound of running water as-
sured him that a bath was being drawn.
As in a dream, he heard the servant ask
if he wished to be shaved or would he
prefer to shave himself. It was all per-
fect.

  Half an hour later another sad-faced
man entered and asked him if he was
ready for supper. It seemed that the
Lady Moyennes awaited the duke’s pleas-
ure in the supper room. Somehow it did
not seem real to the duke. There was too
much regularity to it, too much that he
could not understand. It seemed as
though he were an actor in a play that
went too smoothly—ah! That was it!
It had to be well done, because it had
been so often done by these servants—
how often had that sad-faced valet drawn
the bath for some bright-faced, anticipat-
ing young man who sought adventure
and love in Andorra? Where were those
young men now? And would he play
the same part in the tragedy that they
had played?

  He told the butler that he would be
ready in a few minutes and took one of
his suitcases into the bathroom and
closed the door. There was an automatic
in that piece of baggage, but when he
took it up and looked at it, he found
that all of the cartridges had been taken

out. He could not believe that this had
happened since he arrived at the castle.
Was it possible that a confederate in the
hotel in which he had passed last night
had made him defenseless? At least,
this was the first sign of danger, and was
depressingly suggestive. He was glad
that he had that dagger in its leather
case, strapped to his leg under his trou-
sers. It would not be as useful as a re-
volver, but in a pinch he could use it to
good advantage. At least, it made him
feel better to have it strapped on his leg.
Going into the bedroom, he told the but-
ler that he was read" to follow him to
the supper table.

IN A room that was so small that a
charming sense of intimacy was pos-
sible, but with so high a ceiling that the
candles failed to show any of its detail,
the Lady Helen Moyennes awaited the
Duke of Freud. The aristocratic Span-
iard was well acquainted with the beauty
of the feminine world, but even his
blase soul was aroused by the superb
woman who faced him. He dimly felt
that she was tall, but there was a del-
icacy about her that minimized her
height. Her closely fitting decollete en-
semble showed a form that was almost
massive, and, still, there was but little
indication of the tremendous strength
that must be associated with such a pow-
erful body. All this and a hundred other
thoughts flashed through the duke’s mind
as he bent forward to kiss her out-
stretched hand. Her long fingers, end-
ing in pointed nails, gathered together
his varied, fragmentary thoughts into a
harmonious whole.

  He thought to himself, "This woman
is a tiger. All ladies are cats, but this
beautiful one is a supercat.”

  If Lady Helen had any other thought
save that of bored politeness, she did not
THE SEEDS OF DEATH

521

show it in her attitude. In a minute they
were at the small table, set for two.

  "I always have the service set for a
guest,” explained the languid woman.
"Life here is dull, but now and then,
from all over the world, very exceptional
people drop in on me; so I am always
prepared. Day and night a watchman is
on the wall. When an automobile ar-
rives at the gate, he has orders to open it.
After it is in the courtyard, there is time
enough to learn the business of the occu-
pant with me. Of course, important
guests like yourself are always antic-
ipated and prepared for. It is necessary
to do this, especially in regard to the
food. You realize that most men enjoy
good meals, and the habits gastronomical
of different nations are so different. You
are my first Spanish guest. Is that not
odd? Men from England and Italy and
even a very wonderful Turk, to say noth-
ing of those charming but rather blunt
Americans, have visited me, but never till
this evening have I had the pleasure of
entertaining a real member of the Span-
ish nobility. Naturally, when I heard
that you were arranging to see me, I
wondered what I could do to make this
visit one that you would remember—it
seemed to me that a man with your sense
of beauty needed something more than
a heavy supper; so, I thought it would be
fitting to make you a little present, even
before you taste the grapefruit. Manuel,
bring in that silver casket, and place it
before the duke.”

  A massive jewel case was placed on
the snow-white linen cloth.

  "Now, my dear duke,” almost purred
Lady Helen, "when I heard that you
were on your way to see me, I thought
that it would be best to give you jewels
—not just ordinary jewels, but some very
fine ones that would have a special sig-
nificance to you; so I arranged to obtain

some in Paris. A very notorious young
lady arrived there a few weeks ago, and
I obtained some from her that she had
brought from New York. You are so
fond of jewels, perhaps you may have
seen these before? Also, there is a ring.”

  The puzzled duke opened the lid of
the jewel case and carefully examined
the individual pieces. It did not take
long for him to recognize them as the
ones that he had spent a year’s income
on. And, at the bottom of the box, a
ring. Of course, there are often many
rings in the world that look exactly alike,
and yet, as the duke looked at it, he was
struck at the resemblance to the ring worn
by James Garey. But this was no time to
betray himself by any outward show
either of anxiety or of perplexity. He
slowly broke into one of those famous
smiles that made him such a charming
favorite with the other sex.

  "You have conquered me!” he ex-
claimed. "I never could resist jewels.
Courtesy on my part demands that I ac-
cept this gift, and I am sure that your
sense of pity for a beauty-starved man
will make you willing to grant my re-
quest and wear these jewels during the
rest of my visit. When I take them with
me, they will be all the more precious
to me because you have worn them, at
least, for a little while. This ring, how-
ever, I will at once put on and cherish,
for there will be hours, as your guest,
that convention will deny me the sight of
your smile, and, during those lonely
hours, the wearing of this ring will com-
fort me till you again dispel the midnight
of my sorrow with the dawn of your fair
face.”

  "I think that was very nicely said,” re-
plied the Lady Helen. "I am beginning
to regret the wasted years during which
I never even realized how charming
a true Spaniard could be. I feel that
522

WEIRD TALES

my cosmopolitan tastes have played me
false, and in my search for a real man I
have been unfortunate enough—and met
you only tonight.”

They smiled at each other, and began
to eat.

Soon he selected a bracelet and begged
for the opportunity of personally placing
it on her wrist. In touching her skin he
felt a warm, vibrant, tingling thrill that
roused the slumbering silences of his
masculine ego.

Again she smiled on him, as she said,
"For years I have been looking for a real
man.”

Lazily leaning toward her he whis-
pered, "I trust that from tonight on you
need no longer look.”

"I want a man that will gamble with
life—and love.”

"You have found that man.”

"I am in great trouble.”

"I will share it with you.”

The meal finally ended—with the but-
ler discreetly absent, no chaperon in sight,
and a close harmony already existent be-
tween the tiger woman and the Spaniard,
who was already wondering just what the
end would be of the game that he was
playing. However, he did not wait long,
for she suddenly asked him to excuse
her. She was tired and felt that he was
also fatigued with the events of the day.
She promised to see him on the morrow
and to confide in him, to tell him her
troubles, but, just now—a white arm
stretched toward him, a white hand
rested on his to receive his nocturnal salu-
tation—and then the butler appeared to
escort him to his bedroom.

Dully, he closed the door. He found
the valet waiting and told him that
there was nothing more for the night.
After the servant had left, he locked the
door and lit several candles. Carefully,

he examined the plaster on each side of
the doorway. It was scratched with the
wrinkles of antiquity. He placed his
hands first on one place and then another
against the wall, and, after each pressing,
looked carefully at the palm. Finally, a
red mark appeared on the skin. He re-
placed the palm exactly over that piece
of plaster and held it there while he
counted thirty. This time a little flag
showed on his palm, and it was a red
flag. The red flag of danger! The duke
laughed, silently. He did not need a red
flag to tell him of the danger he was in.
Poor old James Garey—he had meant
well—but where was he now? A sud-
den thought came to him. He took the
ring on his finger and carefully wrote the
word "Danger” on the white plaster.
When he had finished, there was no
mark visible, but when he pressed against
it with his palm, the word appeared in
red letters on his moist skin.

There was no mistake. On his finger
was the ring that James Garey had worn
when he entered the castle. He had worn
it long enough to trace the warning flag
—perhaps he had tried to leave other
messages—but now the ring was on
another man’s finger, and where was
Garey? How much did this devil of a
woman know? She had known about his
buying those jewels for the woman in
New York, and had been able to antic-
ipate his visit in time to recover those
jewels and give them to him. Of course,
it was a left-handed gift. She could take
them away from him—but that was not
what was worrying him. How did she
know about the woman who went to
Paris? In what way had she found out
that he was going to visit her? She must
have known that almost before he and
Garey left America. Any one could see
that the very fact that she gave him
Garey’s ring showed that she had a fair
THE SEEDS OF DEATH

523

idea of what that ring could be used for.

With a deep sigh, the duke undressed
and went to bed. Garey was either dead
or alive, according to the whims of this
woman. So were all the other young
men who had been drawn to this castle by
rumors of the wondrous beauty of the
owner. "Well,” reflected the Spaniard,
"tomorrow will tell the tale. The tigress
must have some weak spot. But what in
the name of all the holy saints is her
reason? What is she? A real woman, or
a salamander?”

The morning came, and with it the
sad-faced valet, a bath and a very remark-
able breakfast, served in the bedroom.
Later came a message from the lady. She
had heard that the duke could drive a
car. Would he object to showing her
his ability? The duke did not object,
but for the next three hours teased death
a thousand times on the steep roads, bor-
dered on one side by high mountains and
on the other side by ravines that seemed
to have no landing-place. As one thrill
followed another, the woman by the
duke’s side became enthusiastic.

"You can drive a car!” she purred. "I
think you are a real man.”

Finally they returned to the castle.
The lady, pleading indisposition,
begged to be excused, but promised to
meet the duke at the supper table. There,
dressed in an Oriental fantasy of laces
and pearls, she appeared more charming
than ever. But it was not her beauty,
nor yet the excellent food, that impressed
the duke; rather it was a flower that she
wore on her corsage. This flower, though
its stem was blood-red, had white pet-
als, almost dead-white, and thick, as
though made of wax. The stamens and
pistils were red, but that was not the re-
markable thing about them. They were

long and seemed to move caressingly over
the white bust of the Lady Helen Moyen-
nes. And when the ends of the red sta-
mens touched her skin, the woman
seemed to be pleased.

For a while the duke thought that he
was imagining all this—he did not wish
to be impolite by looking too long at the
flower and at the low-cut gown that it
was pinned on. He shivered. It was
fastened by a gold snake. Perhaps it
would be best for him not to drink any
more. Of course, it was just a gold
snake, but—damn it!—what made the
eyes glitter that way?

The lady noticed his close attention.
She laughingly asked, "Do you like my
flower?”

"It is beautiful because of its location.
May I ask the name?”

"I do not know. I have a few plants
growing here. Occasionally one blos-
soms and then I wear it, though often I
prefer the blossom to go to seed. Do
you like it? Would you like to see one
grow? You may if you stay here. I
should like to have you do that. You are
a real man. For years I have wanted a
real man—one who could make me love
him and fear him and shrink under his
wild caresses. Some of the men who have
visited me have been such gentlemen that
they bored me.”

"I think I should like to see the
plants,” answered the duke. "And, un-
der certain circumstances, life might be
very pleasant here.”

"If once you saw the plants, you
would want to stay. You are like all the
other men—so jealous! But we have
come to the end of the supper. You
were so busy watching my orchid that
you did not eat much. It is early; let
us go to another room and play a game
of cards. Do you know any new game of
chance?”
524

WEIRD TALES

  The duke thought of his three walnut
shells. He excused himself and, guided
by the butler, went to his bedroom to get
them. On his return, the Lady Helen
preceded him to a small room. It is
interesting to note that during the days
that the duke stayed at the castle he never
learned its geography sufficiently to find
his way without a guide.

  The lady awaited him in a small room,
hung with black velvet drapes. The
floor was covered with a carpet so thick
that the silent footfalls sounded like the
ghostly steps of pedestrians long dead.
In the center of the room a small card
table and two chairs provided ample fur-
niture for a card game. On one side of
the table an iron stand provided support
for an ash-tray of jade. Even as he was
sitting down, the duke saw that this iron
was shaped like a dragon, a rather hid-
eous feminine dragon, with red eyes; he
wished those eyes did not stare that way.

  So, between cigarettes, the two showed
each other tricks of cards and walnut
shells, and, finally, of very proper, almost
sedate, early Victorian love. Lady Hel-
en was fascinated by the shell game.
She finally admitted that the duke’s abil-
ity was too much for her.

  Pleased, he boasted, "The hand is
quicker than the eye.”

  That night, on returning to the room
where his valet awaited him, he quietly
shut and barred the door. He kept the
servant busy with a few odd tasks while
he took off his evening clothes and put
on a more comfortable soft-collared shirt
and slippers. Then, almost before the
valet knew what had happened, the duke
had him on the floor with the sharp
point of a very business-like dagger press-
ing against his throat.

  "Now, you can get me the ammuni-
tion for my gun,” he whispered.

  "Your gun is loaded, sir.”

  "You are a liar!”

  "No. The next morning after you
came, she told me to load it.”

  The duke carefully searched the man
to see that he had no weapons, and then,
with the dagger still pressed against his
jugular vein, made him walk over and
open the traveling-bag. A second’s in-
spection satisfied him that the man had
told the truth. The revolver was loaded.
That only served to give the duke one
more thing to think about.

  He replaced the dagger in his leg
sheath, having far more confidence in a
gun. Then he told the valet to sit down
in front of him. The time had come for
a cessation of courtesies, the duke careful-
ly explained to the valet.

  "I am satisfied that you know a great
deal about this place,” continued the
duke. "I am going to speak very slowly,
so you will be sure to understand my
meaning. I am confident that you have
served all the gentlemen who have vis-
ited your mistress. Probably the same
program is rendered for each of us.
Now, you have your choice: you can
either tell me all about it or you can have
me slit your throat. What about it?”

  "I will tell you all I know, sir.”

  "You will?”

  "Yes, I will tell everything.”

  "Why? What is the reason for your
eagerness? A good servant would die
rather than betray his madam.”

  "She told me years ago that whenever
this sort of thing happened, I should
always tell.”

  "So, other men have threatened you?”
"Yes, sir! Mr. James Garey bruised
me severely.”

  "I see. And where is Mr. Garey
now?”

  He saw a change come into the man’s
eyes. He seemed to be looking over the
duke’s head. And just then the Span-
THE SEEDS OF DEATH

525!

iard sensed a strange perfume and felt a
soft hand on his shoulder as her voice
said, "Why not have me tell you?”

He whirled in his chair and faced Hel-
en Moyennes.

She smiled at him, and even in his
worried rage he saw that it was a tender,
solicitous smile, a pleasant comprehen-
sive smile that should have disarmed his
suspicions.

"You are a little like all the other men,
Ferdinand, Duke of Freud. I tell you
that I am in trouble and that you can
help me and, at once, you think the worst
things about me that you can and try to
corrupt or threaten my servants. Why
were you not frank? I gave you jewels.
I even offered to share everything with
you — for the rest of my life. I am
afraid that I love you, Ferdinand.”

The Spaniard looked at her. He felt
that she was either speaking the truth or
was a wonderful actress. *

"I think that I shall call your bluff,
Helen Moyennes,” he answered. "If
you will tell me the mystery of the mis-
sing men and give an explanation that is
satisfactory to me, I will accept it as proof
of your love, and I think that you are
beautiful and lovely enough for me to
spend the rest of my life with—and when
I love a woman, I usually satisfy her.”
"That would suit me. I think that
when I tell you my story, you will under-
stand. Of course, the men are dead—at
least, most of them—but if they wanted
to kill themselves, am I to blame? Come
into my private rooms, and let me tell you
about it.”

"I will, but this valet goes along.”

"To what purpose? What does he
know that I can not tell you?”

"And you are going to tell me every-
thing?”

"Everything.”

The Spaniard followed the woman
into her room. His dagger had
been replaced in its leather case, but he
held the revolver in his right hand. He
was very careful, walking down the long
hall; he did not favor a knife-thrust from
behind in the dark.

  Once in her bedroom, he sat with his
back to the wall; no confederate of this
tigress was going to get the best of him!
From that place of security he noted, for
the first time, that since supper time the
lady had changed her dress. Now she
had on a white lace negligee that gave a
general impression of extreme intimacy.
In fact, the duke felt that it was intended
to impress him—to pity and, perhaps, to
other more subtle emotions. The orchid
that she had worn at supper was now in
a vase on the center table.

  "You are so odd, Ferdinand,” began
the lady. "Please put that revolver away,
or I shall scream. What do you want to
do? Shoot me? Of course, you could
do that, but how explain matters to my
servants or the American ambassador?
Do you know him? He certainly is a
dear. He came here to investigate me,
and I really believe that had he been
younger and not so great an official, he
would have remained here—longer. At
least, he gave me a wonderful recommen-
dation. He sent me a copy of it, and I
could see that he was shocked at the way
people were talking about me. A lone
woman must be very careful. In fact,
she must be above suspicion, and when
I told the ambassador my story and
showed him my guest book, why, the
only thing for him to do was to think
that these dear boys had accidentally driv-
en their cars over one of our precipices.

  "I came here some years ago, and
bought this castle. I spent a large sum
in making it suitable as a residence for
the best kind of people. Of course, I
526

WEIRD TALES

hoped that now and then I should have
company; so I prepared a series of guest
chambers. There were any number of
old four-poster beds, and I had these put
into the new guest rooms and, at last, I
began to be known, just a little; people
in Paris and Moscow and New York be-
gan to whisper about this castle, and
finally a man called from Moscow. He
was a nervous fellow, always putting
things in his mouth. One day we were
walking through the forest and we saw
some red seeds on the ground, near the
skeleton of a horse. They looked exactly
like pomegranate seeds. This Russian
nobleman put some in his mouth and that
night he became unconscious. Of course,
I was worried, because I was sure that his
friends would think that I had poisoned
him. After some weeks of unconscious-
ness, he died. I went back to the forest
and picked up all of the seeds that were
scattered around, and I brought them
back and planted some, and they would
not germinate. The more I worried, the
worse I felt, and just when it seemed that
I could not bear the suspense any longer,
a man by the name of Southward from an
American town, called Atlanta, came to
see me. He had heard of me in Paris.
I was young then, and I thoughtlessly
told him about the Russian and asked
him to help me unravel the mystery. He
was a doctor, this American, and he
asked me to let him see the seeds. I
showed them to him and he examined
them. He cut one open and looked at it
through a pocket microscope, and finally
he said that it was just a hard seed, and he
said that it was like a pomegranate, and
that it was not the cause of the Russian’s
death, because it would never be dis-
solved in his stomach—it was too hard;
and he thought the man had died of a
disease he called uremia. I cried and
told him how relieved I was to know all

this, and could he prove it to me—if he
could, he would win my everlasting grat-
itude. What did he do but at once put
a seed in his mouth and swallow it! And
he became unconscious and died—just
like the Russian. And that made two.

  "The affair shadowed my life. It made
me broody, introspective. I was no long-
er the gay girl that had come so buoy-
antly to this castle in search of adventure.

  "And then the blossoms came, and of
all the things in my life that I have had,
those wonderful blossoms were the most
precious. You saw me wear one tonight
at supper. At present, it is on the table.
When I have one, I am a different
woman — without one, I am sad, de-
pressed and aged. So now I had two
things to live for, one to solve the mys-
tery of the seeds and the other to have a
plentiful supply of blossoms.

  "James Garey was the first man who
acted in the least bit unfriendly. I knew
that you were going to come, and I knew
that he would accuse me of the death of
his brother. Naturally, I was prepared;
yet I determined to be honest with him
and tell him the whole story. He decided
to kill me, but at the last he said he would
give me a gambler’s chance. He had the
idea that the red seeds had killed his
brother. I showed him a bottle full, and,
at the same time, allowed him to compare
them with real seeds of the pomegranate.
He said there was a little difference; so
we put a red seed and a pomegranate seed
on the card table and cut for the low
card. The high card allowed the fortu-
nate one to swallow the pomegranate
seed, while the one who cut low was to
swallow the seed that he felt was so
poisonous. I cut low; so I swallowed the
red seed and he took the harmless seed,
and in a few hours he was silent in the
embrace of the slowly approaching death.
THE SEEDS OF DEATH

527

You notice I am still alive? So, some-
thing else killed Garey? What?”

The duke smiled. "Perhaps. Or, at
the last moment, you switched the seeds
on him.”

"No. He was fortunate. He won out
in the cards. Do you know, he followed
me around as long as he could walk, and,
of course, waited to see me become a
hopeless cripple, and you should have
seen the look of hopeless terror on his
face when he found out that he could not
walk or talk. He gambled with death
and lost.”

"So, one and all, those brave boys are
dead?”

"No. Garey is still alive, and one or
two others, but the rest are really dead.”
"Lady Helen Moyennes. You are a
liar! If I thought that you were telling
the truth, I would kill you right there. I
would fill that lovely body full of bullet
holes. But you are trying to deceive me.
You are eidier insane or a great actress. I
should not be surprized to have the door
open and all these former lovers of yours
walk in as the animals did at Circe’s ban-
quet. Such a tale as you tell! For chil-
dren or fools.”

"I am not a liar. Here is a bottle
filled with seeds, and—why, there is one
of the flowers!”

"The flowers?” asked the duke. "What
in the name of the holy saints has the
flower to do with the seed?”

"The seed finally matures the flower
and the bloom is what I live for.”

"But—I do not understand?”

"You will when you see the men.
Come with me. Suppose we see James
Garey first. He will have his eyes open,
but he is really unconscious; at least, it is
best to think so.”

The lady led the Spaniard into a
guest room. Passing down the hall,
he recognized at least one faa, that he

was passing by the door of his own room.
Then they entered the next room. Fool
that he was! Had Garey been separated
by only a wall from help all the time
since the duke had arrived? They entered
the room, and the duke saw that in prac-
tically every detail it was furnished like
his own. And Garey was on the bed.

   His eyes were open. He was in pa-
 jamas, and but lightly covered with a
 white silk sheet. On his face was a puz-
 zled look. Without looking at the woman
 by his side, the duke took the sick man’s
 hand. It was warm. The man was
 breathing, but the arm, when released,
 dropped flaccid on the bed.

  "Garey! Garey! Don’t you know
me?” the duke pleaded.

   The soul seemed to answer in Garey’s
 eyes. The soul, and nothing else.

   The duke’s finger nervously touched
 the trigger of the revolver.

   "Don’t shoot me yet,” jeered the ti-
 gress. "Wait till you have seen the rest
 of them. Let us go into the other rooms.”

   In the next room another man lay on
 the bed in the same paralyzed attitude.

   The lady said in a low voice, "This is
 a South American. I was so disgusted
 with him that, in some way, he swal-
 lowed a seed with his salad. He has lost
 a good many pounds in the last week. If

 I	were not sure of his loss of sensibility,

 I	should think from his expression that
 he was in pain.”

   In the next room the woman paused
 to turn on the elearic lights. "If you
 look at this man closely, you will see that
 he also is still alive but not doing very
 well. See the little green tendrils com-
 ing out of his mouth and nose? The root
 formation has now reached a point at
 which the plant is able to reach the sur-
 face. Naturally there is a profound dis-
 turbance of all of the vital organs.

  "Let us go into the next room. A
528

WEIRD TALES

  lovely boy, Serriano of Boston, is there.
A Greek god he was when he came here,
and I would have saved him if I could,
but he was so stubborn. Let’s pass
through this connecting door. See how
thin his face is and shrunken his arms?
But the plant is growing rampant. It is
sending up its branches over the bed-
posts and down over the floor. See the
little buds? In another two weeks the
blossoms will appear. I am sure that
Serriano has been dead for some days.

I	loved that boy, and I am so glad that
he did not suffer.

  “In this next room is the reason for
your being here. Yes, you have guessed
it—the brother of Garey. A surprize
awaits you. Come through this door.
Do you notice this odor? Have you ever
had an experience like this? The most
wonderful orchid in all the world, my
passion flower.”

  On the bed in this room was what
had once been a man. Now he seemed
little more than a bag of skin and bones,
but the room was filled with rustling,
swaying vines, and a dozen flowers, like
those the tigress had worn on her cor-
sage, filled the room with a cloying frag-
rance that was almost unearthly and un-
endurable. The Lady Helen took one
by the stem and held it near her bosom,
and at once the pistils began tenderly to
brush the skin.

  She laughed. "See? My darlings
know me. How glad they are to have me
near! The others are disappointed, jeal-
ous. They want to love me, too.”

  "So that is Garey’s brother?” the duke
asked slowly.

  "Yes. He was a fine man. So far, he
has produced more blossoms than any I
have ever had. But let us see the others.
Suppose we skip two or three rooms and
go to the last room? That will give you
an idea of the end, and I know you will

  agree with me that it is not so bad, not
so very bad.”

This last room was furnished like the
others, but the plant was dead. The
thing that had been a man was now dried
leather, cracked and broken. Between
the cracks could be seen the dead, dried
roots that had eaten him, till nothing re-
mained; and these had then died of hun-
ger. On the bedposts, over the floor, the
dead leaves lay in dry rot. But the seed
pods hung, a plentiful harvest, from the
end of many a stem.

"Here we reap the harvest. This is
the man from Moscow. Tomorrow I
will come with my glass bottle and save
every seed and have the room clean and
precise for the next visitor.”

"There will be no tomorrow and no
more visitors!”

"So, this is the end?”

"Precisely!”

“Then, let me go and gather some
of the flowers from Garey — for my
funeral.”

They returned to the room where the
massive blooms filled the air with the
odor of ethereal decay. Gently the lady
broke off half a dozen, but, in spite of
her care, the torn stems bled and covered
her white negligee with blood. She
pressed the bouquet to her face, and the
duke shuddered as he saw dozens of long
twitching stamens caress her cheeks and
eyelids.

"Now we will go back to any of your
rooms,” commanded the duke, "and you
can prepare to join Garey.”

"At least, it will be a pleasure to die
at the hands of such a gentleman. I am
sure that it will give you a thrill to kill a
defenseless woman.”

"It will give me a great joy.”

Still smelling the flowers, she saun-
tered to the card room.

Seated at one chair, she begged the
                     W. T.—6
THE SEEDS OF DEATH

529

duke to occupy the other. The card
table was between them.

"So, you are going to kill me?”

"No. On second thought, I am going
to tie you up and take you in my car to
Madrid, and there I am going to turn you
over to the authorities.”

"They will never believe you.”

"They can come and see for them-
selves.”

"By that time my servants will have
all the rooms clean and fresh. Ferdi-
nand, you are a fool. You know you can
not make the people in Madrid believe
you. You had better kill me here. Of
course, you can not get out of the castle
alive. Right now a half-dozen guns are
pointed at your heart. Why not be a
sport? Let’s compromise. You write a
letter to the American ambassador that
you and James Garey are leaving for Nice
and that you know everything is all right
here. Then, we will play a game of
cards. If I lose, I will take one of my
own seeds and you a pomegranate. I have
one of those fruits here. I will let you
cut it open and satisfy ycurself that there
is no fraud. I will call in my men and tell
them that if you win, they are to give you
safe passage. I understand you are a
gambler—let’s try fate. Select your own
game.”

"I will do that little thing,” said the
duke, smiling, as he reached in his pock-
et for the three walnut shells. "Let me
cut the pomegranate. I want to look at
those seeds. Put one of your seeds be-
side it. God! They are alike. Now,
call your men and tell them your orders,
and we will begin.”

The lady clapped her hands, and from
behind the velvet curtains stepped
six men. She had not lied. She told
these six that she and the duke were play-
ing for high stakes, and if she lost they
W. T.—7

were to let the man go free. She called
for pen and ink and paper and had the
duke write to the American ambassador
about the trip to Nice. Then she told
the six men that they could leave the
room.

  "You will learn in eight hours who
won,” she told them, "but if this guest
wins, let him go free. If I win, we will
have you take the letter to Madrid. Now,
Ferdinand, explain this new American
game.”

  "I have here three half walnut shells,”
began the duke. "I will use a pome-
granate seed. I will give you three
chances to tell under which shell I put
the seed. Best two out of three wins.
If I win, I eat a pomegranate seed, and
you one of those seeds of death. If you
win, the tables will be reversed. I warn
you that the hand is quicker than the
eye.”

  "I will have some wine brought,” com-
mented the Lady Helen. "We will
need something to wash the seeds down.
My mouth is dry already. Is it not queer,
fantastic, that I can not stand excitement?
Feel my hand, how it shakes.”

  "I do not care to feel your hand.”

  "A few hours ago you said that you
loved me.”

  "I love you as I do death. Come. Be
a sport. Do you understand the rules?
Good! Now watch me closely as I wave
my hand over the shell. There! It is
now under one. Which one? The right
end? Wrong. It was in the center. Now
again. Watch me. This is your life at
stake. Now, which one? The center?
Wrong again. It was on the left side.
You have lost twice and you pay. Now
is the time for my gun. Here is the glass
of wine. Take a seed out of that bottle
and swallow it. One false move and I
blow your brains out. Now I will dig out
one of these pomegranate seeds and drink
530

WEIRD TALES

it down with wine. Now, we each have
a seed. I understood you to say that it
worked in eight hours? So, we will sit
here till morning. If you move, I will
kill you anyway. I am not going to leave
you till I know that you have started the
long road that those brave young fools
took. You had a good time, but now your
time has come to an end.”

Sighing, the lady put down her glass.
"So, this is the end?” she said. "Well,
have you any objection to my playing sol-
itaire? Some men would have liked to
hold me in their arms these last eight
hours of life, but you are so different,
Ferdinand. At times, you seem to be un-
necessarily cold. It is better to die than
to live a lifetime with you. You would
not satisfy.”

She started to play solitaire. Hour
after hour she shuffled and dealt. Four
hours passed and then five and six. She
had not spoken, but the duke noticed
that her movements were gradually be-
coming slower, and at times she swayed
in her chair as though she were drunk.

At last, his curiosity overcame him.
"Do you feel sick?” he asked.

"I feel very peculiar. I think that
soon I shall be unable to play.”

He watched her carefully. Seven and
a half hours passed and she just sat there
motionless, looking at him with glazed
eyes. Sighing and tired, he took his re-
volver and placed it in his pocket; then,
folding his hands on the table, he waited
for the end.

He judged that the eight hours were
up and started to look at his watch; but
his hands stayed folded on the table. He
tried to get up, and he just sat there.

Then the woman stretched; like a lazy
cat she stretched her long bare arms
above her head and yawned.

"It has been a long, tiresome night,

Ferdinand,” she said. "You look sleepy
yourself. That was an interesting game
you played. Your idea that the hand was*
quicker than the eye is right. You never
did see me plant those seeds in a pome-
granate or palm a harmless seed so that
it looked as though I took one from the
glass bottle.”

  The duke looked at her with smolder-
ing hate, the fire of hell in his eyes, but
he was helpless. The virus from the seed
of death had already prostrated his ner-
vous system and he was started on the
long road that the other brave men had
taken.

  The tigress clapped her hands, and in
walked the butler and the valet. With-
out a word, they took the duke and car-
ried him to his bed. On that bed he was
destined to lie till his body turned to
bones, skin and dust. Then the woman
clapped her hands again, and, when
another servant came, she gave him the
letters to the American ambassador, with
orders to mail it. Then she went to her
bedroom, talking softly to herself.

  "I am tired,” she said, "and slightly
nauseated. I do not seem to stand excite-
ment as well as I did once. Well. That
makes one more fool. I wonder when I
can stop. Certainly not so long as I gain
such wonderful delight from my darling
blossoms.”

  The sunlight was streaming through
her bedroom windows. Slowly she un-
dressed, and, with her six orchids in her
hand, she sank luxuriously into the
downy softness of her bed. She placed
the blossoms on her shoulders, neck and
face and, quivering, shut her eyes.

  The flowers awakened, and stretching
forth their tremulous pistils and stamens,
stroked her skin.

  With a convulsive effort she gathered
them to her lips and kissed them till she
slept.
Black Man and White Witch

By Watson Rawkins

An eery tale of an African slave-ship on which blindness and
death held sway

THIS was the third night of drifting the sea-fowl, the sun and stars and moon,
for the big, black, naked African but now, in the bright tropic moonshine,
savage upon his raft of wreckage, the towering brigantine came down upon
He had as yet spoken nothing save the sea, him, across the plain of silver.
532

He was a Koromantin, from the unsub-
dued mountains of the Ashanti Gold
Coast. Here, sole survivor he was of those
five hundred and eighty stripped human
chattels, men and women, with which,
stacked below deck like books, the Portu-
guese slaver Flor de Felicidade—-Flower
of Happiness—had put out from Whydah
Roads of the West African slave marts.

Ere the discharge of the Cuban planta-
tions there should have been, for him and
those ignorant all, six weeks of fetid
gloom, suffocation and thirst, but an eye
plague had spread like fire in a cane vil-
lage.

She had done it, with her witchcraft:
she, the slim white witch, girl-wife of that
hated captain—the woman who, hovering
near the deck barricades, from aloof had
gazed with large, curious eyes, to murmur
charms while he and others supped from
their pannikins or danced at the bidding
of the lash.

Her eyes had often been fixed upon
him, Koromantin of the mountains and of
a free people who despised the lowland
jungle dwellers, and her murmurs had been
directed his way; but he had answered
look with look, unafraid. In his country
he was a headman and a great man. The
white witch might do her worst, and he
would not bow or cry out. What was her
pleasure in saddling them, the already
wretched, with her curse?

His fetish proved to be stronger than
hers, for the red-eye curse passed him by.
But through the slave-deck quarters, dark,
smothersome, black with prone figures
speaking different tongues, where news
carries like news among stable brutes,
there were groans burdened with fresh
misery, and curses vainly answering curse.

Captain Fezarri had acted promptly.
The first black discovered with the dread-
ed blindness had been thrown overboard
along with his shackle-mate, and with

others who had lain near. The next morn-
ing a score of culprits were revealed. They
went over; and through succeeding days
of baffling calms and head winds the drift
and wake of the Flower of Happiness
were specked with shark fins and with
wallowing forms.

The half-drunken ship’s doctor was
busy with his own men. There was only
the one remedy, expensive but thorough,
to be applied to those cattle below, while
praying for a stiff breeze which might
sweep her slave-hold clean of contagion
the Flower of Happiness, dogged by her
lading of pestilence, blundered upon her
sluggish way like a craft condemned.

The black man as well as the white
man, however, had his gods—weak
though they seemed to be. The lookout of
the Flower of Happiness reported the
square-sails of a brig tacking in upon her
course. Captain Fezarri, nimble, yellow,
barefooted, and knife-scarred in a cheek,
took but a squint; then he ordered every-
thing slow and aloft clapped on, for the
stranger was a British cruiser.

In the thinned slave-tiers underneath
fastened hatch gratings the big Koroman-
tin had known all; he had read the
shrieks and the strangled cries, and he
missed companions in misery. Now he
and his fellows might dully wonder over
the new repeated loud commands above,
the quick slap of soles, the creak of
blocks and the quiver of the straining
hull. No food or water was passed down.

All the night and all the day the chase
continued, with the cruiser gradually
creeping in. His bow-chasers opened,
while his colors flew to his main-peak.
The shot, at first falling astern, began to
splash water upon the helmsman. A ball
from a long twenty-four ripped through
the bulwarks of the starboard bow—
might as easily have ripped through
either main- or fore-mast.

Captain Fezarri saw himself about to
be caught with a foul ship. That would
never do. Sheering off from a prize court
and charge of piracy he ordered the chain
cable of the best bower anchor freed of
its hawse-hole and stoppered along out-
side the weather rail; and the blacks to
be fetched up.

Up they came, prodded and thwacked,
clanking and groaning in their ankle
cuffs; up the main-hatch ladder, to tum-
ble, bewildered, into the light of day.
There now were scarce one hundred:
men, women and children.

The king’s ship appeared to have
picked a favoring slant of air, for he
gained more rapidly. Captain Fezarri,
while overseeing that the blacks were
leg-ironed in couples and tied by the
wrists to the links of the cable, kept a
hopeful eye (somewhat reddened of the
conjunctival membrane) upon that squall
gathering off the weather beam.

If the squall struck the cruiser first,
and the cruiser stood on before it, the
Flower of Happiness should be lightened
speedily ere she was hove to for search.
If the squall gave her an even break with
the Britisher he, Captain Fezarri, would
hold on, himself, and risk all.

Planted with the others against the for-
ward rail, with his left ankle ironed to
the right of a yellow Eboe, his bruised
wrists bound, behind him, to the anchor
cable, at the end of the line, as happened,
the huge Koromantin stood erect. His
battered head was high, his gaze was fixed
straight before him as though he were re-
viewing his Africa, long below the hori-
zon; and about him there was something
serious, majestic, and implacable.

He had no wife nor child nor country;
the first two had been wrested from him
and done to death by the white man; from
the last he himself had been wrested; and
now he had only his hate.

Apparently unseeing, nevertheless he
saw. The white witch was upon the deck.
Here she came, that creature of evil, who
had cast her spells upon them so that they
might die. She came forward, slipping,
and clinging to the rail opposite. Was it
possible that she, too, had the sickness? In
white she was, which was no whiter than
her white-witch face. With her was an-
other of the hated tormentors.

The Koromantin gave no sign that he
noted them. Perhaps it was this scorn-
ful hardihood-—the naked soul exposed
in a great naked savage; or perhaps it was
the twilight gloom of the squall impend-
ing amid threat of cannon boom and ball
and the flag of Law; or perhaps it was the
quick word from the woman’s parted lips
which impelled the Arab cabin-boy (with
eyes grotesquely swollen) to dart into the
bows, to clip the Koromantin’s wrist bond
with his knife and tuck a file into the thick,
astonished fingers.

While the eyes of master and crew, such
as could still serve, were turned upon
ship and squall over the quarter, stealthily
sinking and here shielded by his fellows
and a corner of the galley the Koromantin
worked like mad upon his ankle shackle.
The blind Eboe beside him was too far
gone with apathy to care.

The file bit fiercely, like the black man’s
fierce spirit; but he was granted little time.
Down swooped the squall, charging across
the darkened sea with an onrush of Nep-
tune’s cavalry whose hoof-beats stir spume
instead of dust, so that the murky line of
its advance was clearly defined.

It veered for the cruiser, and the suck
of it set the Guineaman’s canvas to flap-
ping; she lost way, while, leaning to the
first blast until his yards dipped, with his
fore top gallant streaming in ribbons, the
cruiser leaped to seize his prize. In a min-
ute he was almost within hailing distance
534

WEIRD TALES

—aye, the whistle of his bo’s’n could be
heard, while his reefers clustered like bees
and the teeth of his broadside plainly
showed; and the Flower of Happiness
hung practically in stays.

  "Cut loose!” Captain Fezarri’s com-
mand sharply issued, at last. Hatchet in
hand a sailor ran for the bows; he brushed
past the crouched Koromantin and the
hatchet blade fell upon the sea lashings of
the large bower anchor.

  "Hold!”

  See! The fore top gallant yard of the
cruiser was down and dragging from his
rail—he yawed—he lost way, the squall
closed over him and was swinging for the
wake of the Flor de Felicidade as she
filled with the first of the wind.

  "Hold!” That had been for the man
with the hatchet. "Hard a-weather!”
This, for the man at the helm. "Dius,
boys! We’ll leave him yet!”

  -Too late, in part. The hatchet had done
its work. Down from the cathead dropped
the anchor, and with terrible rasp and
clangor the cable followed, ripped from
stop after stop and in its deadly flight
plucking with it black after black like
monkeys snared in a forest twitch-up.

  The rail was clean in an instant, while
yet the Flower of Happiness was jibing
upon new course. She whirled like a hare,
and was away; and in the welter of the
king’s ship, just chopped free of his top
gallant wreckage, tore over the spot that
his chase had been occupying. But anchor
and chain and hapless blacks were fathoms
deep—all except the big Koromantin.

  That vicious jerk by the anchor which,
communicated through the wrist-tethered
Eboe, had haled him along bodily, by the
ankle shackle, over the bulwarks and into
air and sea, snapped the weakened shackle-
link, and thrown wide of the bows as the
slaver jibed, he was released.

  From two fathoms down he rose, half

strangled, but fighting, into the moil of
spray and gust; to be near strangled again
by the rush of the cruiser, and then,
drowning, to clutch, by instinct, at the top
gallant flotsam, and take breath and bear-
ings.

  He hung fast, waiting and floating. The
tropical rain flattened the slight sea kicked
up by the squall; squall and rain ushered
on the dusk and the clouds broke from the
moon and stars. The Koromantin climbed
upon his sodden little isle and greedily
sucked at the rain cupped in the hollows of
the canvas remnants.

  Refreshed, he rode all night. In the
sunrise doldrums the ocean lay flawless,
heaving with long and languid breath
like the pulsant rhythm of creation; not a
sail emerged, between him and that low
and distant bluish line which might be
Africa, nor in that other direction which
concealed the unknown. He had only the
sharks and sea-fowl for company.

  This was the latitude of seasonal calms
punctuated by hasty squalls. He drifted
all the day; managed to eke out an exist-
ence during two days and nights, and in
the third night the towering brigantine
came down upon him, across the silvered
plain.

He crouched amid his raft of wreck-
age much as he would have crouched
in a jungle covert of his Guinea mountain
homeland. He preferred death to the
slave deck again, but he was rabid for
food. When the portentous thing came
dipping and swaying and creaking, and
suddenly uprearing would contemptuously
tread him under, he sprang, he reached
with his long arms and grasping the bob-
stays he clung, for a short space, like a
giant ape.

  The little jingle that he had made,
ceased; the top-hamper raft was shunted
aside by his leap and by the wash from
BLACK MAN AND WHITE WITCH

535

the craft’s cutwater; he swarmed higher
and higher, foot by foot, until, chinning
himself upon the bowsprit he craned with
his fuzzy head and peered into the deck.

That which he sensed appalled him.

The gash through the forward star-
board bulwarks had been partially re-
paired—though only partially; but this
sign was not necessary to his enlighten-
ment. He smelt, he perceived, he knew.
He was back again upon the slaver Flor de
Felicidade, which to him and the like had
no name save the African black’s name
for Hell.

The deck, white under the moon and
changeful with the shadows of sails and
cordage as the ship weaved and curtsied
with scarce steerage way, was muttersome
with figures which, prone or sitting, other-
wise might have been asleep. At the far
end was the figure of the captain, motion-
less, holding to the wheel as if listening.

The Koromantin shrank, prepared to
drop from his perch. In the bows right
before him there rose a sailor, who called
about:

"Hello! Ahoy! Listen, everybody! I
heard something, dead ahead.”

The murmurings were stilled. The great
black sank lower, crouched for retreat.
Through the tense interval of faculties
alert the captain shouted query, from the
wheel; the man in the bows replied, and
turning looked full, with jaws moving and
hand poised, at the bowsprit and its cower-
ing, shadowed refugee.

But the black did not drop. Instead, he
stiffened with nostrils expanded; he
hitched higher and wormed onward, all in
a fever of desire, down the bowsprit; the
sailor was turned again, as though giving
ear, but half face or full face counted the
same now, with the black—the eyes had
been swollen shut, and, besides, the Koro-
mantin was hungry.

From the rail he sprang like a leopard

upon the sailor vaguely questioning of the
ankle-iron’s faint jingle, with knee and
arm snapped his neck even while bearing
him down and had snatched the hunk of
meat; crouched, was champing upon it
while the alarm of the brief scuffle, the
clinking and the fall had pervaded the
deck fore and aft.

Men leaped up.

"What’s that?”

"Who’s aboard?” *

"Did you hear?”

"Hello, forward!”

One stumbled against another, and
swore; and with an oath the captain’s
voice belched powerfully:

"Forward, there! Who’s the watch?
Look sharp, men. That sounded like a
loose black, wearing an iron. Search
along up into the bows, some of you.”
And he called, in the Mandingo trade dia-
lect of the Slave Coast: "Who is there?”
The Koromantin made no answer.
While he greedily devoured the meat he
fastened his glowing eyes upon another
near enemy, who had scrambled up as
though he had been asleep under the rail
here, and who was confusedly casting
about. The man tripped upon the body;
and knelt, and explored with his hands,
and shouted:

"Sanchez is dead! Here he is—he’s just
been killed! Dius! Look out, all! I’m com-
ing aft.” Wherewith he went creeping
and groveling, as though he dodged a
blow.

The effect of the words was pleasing to
the black giant. The men before him cried
out, and ran about, jostling and recoiling
and seizing whatever weapons their fin-
gers encountered. They were blind. He
stood upright and they did not see him!

The meat had been salty. The thought
of water mastered him. He made a step,
his ankle shackle jingled, the ship men
cried out again, and strained to see. He
536

WEIRD TALES

tore the neckerchief from the dead white
man and muffled the ankle cuff and its
dangling link. Then, again, as swiftly and
as silently as a leopard he stole to the
scuttle-butt chocked at the foot of the
mainmast, and throwing caution to the
winds dipped with the calabash and avid-
ly gulped.

From the wheel the captain called:
"Who’s drinking? Look sharp, every-
body. Down on deck with you!’’

And he fired with his pistol. The ball
seared the Koromantin’s shoulder. The
wanton injury, added to other injuries and
to his hate of all these butchers and robbers
and particularly of the chief and his white-
witch woman, infuriated him. Straight on
over the cabin roof he vaulted, pounced
upon the wheel and the startled wretch
there, clutched the captain by the two ears
and the yellow chops and grinning into
the sightless eyes dragged him from his
hold, with the strength of madness twirled
him high and flung him over the gunwale.

There was only the half-stifled cry from
the captain before he whisked overboard,
and only the plash of his landing, after-
ward; but these tokens carried to the crew
stunned into immobility by the pistol shot
and the instant slap of bare flat soles, and
the pantings of savage energy.

”Dius! There goes the captain!”

"Wait! Listen! Hello, captain! Are you
aboard, captain?”

The Koromantin, squatting near the
wheel, did not reply. From the captain
came no reply. Terror, like a cold hand,
gripped the brigantine Flower of Happi-
ness. With slat of sail and block, creak of
boom and yard, she drifted helmless,
while, stock-still or stealthily shifting as
though fearing to draw attention, the crew
murmured among themselves.

"It must be a black who escaped drown-
ing.”

"Yes, and he can see; he has his eyes.”

"He is aft, where he got the captain. I
hear him breathing.”

 "Saints protea us! We are dead men!”
 "Somebody speak to him. Who knows
 Guinea talk?”

 "Ruez has Mandingo. Where is Ruez?”
 "Here.”

 "Go speak that devil black, Ruez. Ask
 him who he is and what he wants.”

 "He’ll kill me.”

 "Maybe not, if you speak him civilly.”
 "Yes,” said another. "Tell him we will
 feed him, Ruez. He shall have rum. Then
 if we can only get at the cabin’s medicine
 chest we can poison him.”

 "Promise him pay, in rum, for the use
 of his eyes so we can make a port or a sail.
 When we wish we will doaor his rum
 with the laudanum and tie him up.”

 The squatted black saw a sailor coming
 on, feeling along the rail; and he rose,
 picked a belaying-pin from the near rail,
 and waited. He was going to kill all, in
 due time.

 The sailor called in the Mandingo trade
 jargon: "Brother, hello.”

 This was not worth response. As the
 sailor paused, redly swollen of the eyes, in
 the moonlight at the farther corner of the
 cabin, the Koromantin recognized in those
 distorted features the countenance of the
 half-caste cabin-boy who had cut his bonds.

 "Hello! Who is it? Eboe? Fullah? Man-
 dingo?”

 The African growled, with one word:
 "Koromantin.”

 A shudder and a wail swept the waist
 of the Flower of Happiness.

 "Koromantin! Hear you? He is a sav-
 age, a pagan! We are dead men.”

 The cabin-boy piped again: "What do
 you want, friend?”

 The black gave no answer.

 "Food? Drink? You shall have plenty.
 Who are you? You are the big man? You
 have eyes?”
BLACK MAN AND WHITE WITCH

537

 Said the Koromantin: "I am death.”
 The boy retreated.

 "He is the big Koromantin. I offered
 him food and drink, but he means to kill
 us.”

 "Could you see him, Ruez?”

 "Very little.”

 "Maybe enough to shoot him?”

 "Oh, no! Not enough yet.”

 The white men jabbered: "Then fetch
 him food and rum. Quick!”

 "Promise him we will make him rich.
 Toll him forward, till we can get the
 laudanum out of the cabin.”

 "Once he is put asleep we can tie him
 in irons and promise him his freedom,
 for his eyes. In that way we can make a
 port.”

 "Then he shall be strung up for mur-
 dering the captain and Sanchez.”

 "Yes; but in the name of God first treat
 with him. Quick, Ruez! Speak him fair
 again. Get him forward.”

 The Koromantin grimly smiled at the
 panic. A slight jar of impact registered
 upon the ship’s counter. He looked over,
 and he saw a canoe—the small-boat, in-
 deed—floating there with slack tether.

 But here again came the boy, from for-
 ward, with a dish of food, and set it upon
 the roof of the cabin. He dipped into the
 -cask of water and clumsily filled up a tin
 cup from which wafted the odor of rum.

 "Eat and drink, friend,” he called.
 "You will find,” he said, "plenty more
 food in that little house up ahead. Pretty
 soon more rum, too. Eat, drink, sleep,
 make ready to show us the way to other
 white people, so that you shall go back
 home rich.”

 The black, with eyes and nostrils
 titillated, straightened more erect, to
 take crafty step. He would eat, drink, and
 kill—but not kill all these in the night and

 by violating his fetish invest his path with
 ghosts.

 He stopped short. Before his very face,
 up out of the stairway from the cabin she
 came, the white witch, the captain’s
 woman, like a spirit: came, emerging
 silently into the moonlight, in bare feet,
 in thin white gown, with her hands grop-
 ing, her countenance upturned to him, and
 sightless.

 He stood transfixed, breathing rapidly
 while his broad naked chest rose and fell.
 His fingers spread, his sinews tautened,
 his veins swelled. Upon the top step she
 paused, as if questing. She spoke, from
 parted lips.

 "Pedro? Are you here? What hap-
 pens? I heard a noise.”

 Forward, a babble broke afresh.

 "It is the senhora!”

 "Beware! Senhora! Back! Down! No,
 no; this way! To us! There is a black!”

 She uttered a frightened little cry. She
 wavered—and the big Koromantin leaped.
 Lust surged within him as he seized upon
 her, crushing her in his two arms, lifting
 her bodily and bearing her to the stern
 rail.

 Her flesh was soft in his grip, her loos-
 ened hair brushed his face and all his brute
 senses thrilled to the gift of her.

 Down he flung her, like a lion deposit-
 ing his spoil. She had gasped, and shivered;
 she lay lax, disheveled; she had fainted,
 she was defenseless to his will.

 There had been a moment of silence,
 but the white men roused.

 "He has the senhora! At him! To the
 rescue!”

 With loud shouts they wildly shambled
 up the deck. He vented a tremendous yell,
 and stamped, and clattered with his pin;
 and in a frenzy of helplessness they ran
 about, and blundered, and fought one an-
 other. Darting from spot to spot he threat-
 ened them until they cowered with their
538

WEIRD TALES

 tongues out, in a fear as though the

Flower of Happiness were possessed by a
demon.

Having demonstrated over the blind
fools he left them to their prayers and
curses and returned to his woman. While
he stood over her his fingers twitched,
clasping and unclasping; his large face
worked convulsively—he licked his lips.
She, this white-witch girl, whom he did
not fear, was his, to do with as he pleased.
But he need not hurry. He could picture,
and gloat, and plan.

He snapped a rope and bound her
wrists behind her; tied her by the slim
waist to a stanchion; and settled, with cup
and dish, to drink, eat, and wait:

Voices besought: "Senhora! Are you
there, senhora?”

"Mother of God, senhora! Treat with
him. Play him kindly. Do not anger him,
senhora. It is the big Koromantin—the
proud one you noticed. Pretend to be good
to him, senhora. Fetch him rum from the
cabin. You will put laudanum in it. When
he is asleep we will take him and truss
him.”

The black, secure upon his quarter-
deck, let them gabble. For this brief truce
he glowered and deliberated. The right
to kill was his, and the 'lust to kill was his.
The white murderers—there they were,
at his disposal as if by favor of his fetish.
His fingers tightened upon the belaying-
pin, and in fancy it crushed into those
skulls. In fancy, too, he threw them all
over into the water—threw them, blind,
to join the blind devil captain and the
blind and shackled black men and women
thrown over before.

And then, the woman! She should go
with him, to land (when he knew where
land was), for his further pleasure. She
should be his jungle toy, until he was done
with her. He licked his lips.

The white men had promised him
riches; although he was black and they

were white, although he had been a slave
and they were free, although he was
naked and they were clothed, it should
easily be believed that since he had eyes
and they did not they would make him
rich if he helped them.

It might be supposed that he had that
to think upon. But vengeance for what
had been visited upon him and his rela-
tives and his kind lay virtually under his
feet; and none should tell of it, for the
sea, like the jungle, was deep.

The slaver, swinging in the airs and
currents, yawing upon erratic course,
drifted on through a low haze which like
a sheeny halo enclosed but nowhere
touched her. The canvas hung damp, every
point dangled limply and from spars and
beaded rigging the moisture dripped,
dripped with the languored slowness of
the tropics.

The babblings forward were fitful; the
woman lay motionless; quiet doused the
spasms of the exhausted brigantine and
the black, content, dozed, but with animal
senses alert.

     hen he wakened by intuitive warn-
ing the moon was red in the hori-
zon and its flooding light had been dulled
by the grayish pallor of first daybreak.
The deck was somnolent with figures
postured inertly as if drugged by the heavy
breath of dawn. The woman had not
stirred, gently rocked by the Flower of
Happiness that heaved to and fro upon
the smoothly heaving water.

The air around had cleared, and to the
Koromantin’s quick ear was permeated
with the booming as of a far, far African
drum.

He looked, and he saw, yonder, a white
bank—the bank of a fog suspended above
the surface of the world; and beneath it a
white line frothed and simmered: the line
of that surf which boomed forever, like an
BLACK MAN AND WHITE WITCH

539

endless requiem, upon the bars and
beaches and buttress cliffs of Africa.

The fluent fog opened and closed, for
intervals of deeper vistas. Upon a broad
low point apparently quite near, dark
fronds of coco-palms sentineled a dense
jungle of darker mangroves massed in il-
limitable review while the brigantine, im-
pelled by a fateful current, idly drifted
past. There were hints of a mighty in-
ward curving coastline; and shattered by a
headland in the remotest south the eddy-
ing fleecy billows gave errant glimpses of a
bay where white-man craft clustered before
a sprawling thatch-roofed village.

The time had come. If he showed the
people of this ship whereabouts those
other white people were they would make
him rich. The boy had so said, in feeding
him; had promised him more food, and
rum. But here they were, his enemies;
here was the white-witch woman, his
woman; and there was the land. His lips
curled.

With pin in hand he slipped forward,
noiseless and resolute. He stood poised
over the first of the crew, asleep with face
in arms and body in shadow; whereupon,
as if vaguely moved by the formidable
presence the sleeper sighed, and turned,
and beneath the raised club the black
gazed down upon the blank countenance
of the cabin-boy.

The club lingered, and drooped. Again
he remembered. Here was one whom he
could not strike. Irresolution tugged at
him. While he hesitated, the swiftly
broadening pink of the African dawn
shone upon the top canvas of a ship dis-
tant out at sea but standing in as though it
brought a breeze.

He yet had time. Abruptly stooping he
whipped the knife from the boy’s sash.
He ran back to his woman, cut her waist
tether and greedily lifted her. She wak-

ened, she writhed, she was as a child in his
clutch.

  "Who is it?”

  "Koromantin.”

  She might know, but she should never
tell. Her white, soft form was pressed
close to his black chest and his blood
flowed hotly. His eyes sought the cabin;
he started, he faltered. ... He felt her
heart beating like a frightened bird’s, and
through the pounding in his ears he
caught her implorations, choked with
anguish.

  "No, no! Oh, Dius! He did not die,
and he would harm me, who set him free.
Holy angels, help me! Let me give him
the rum!”

  With a harsh cry he held her off, and
slashed her wrist bond, and roughly
dashed her to the deck. In a bound he
leaned over the quarter, drew the floating
boat underneath him, cut that rope, and
hanging from the taffrail, dropped in.

  He shoved away; then he uttered a high
yell, and he heard again those responsive
notes of terror from the white men: the
craven bletherings of those white dogs
who had murdered his family, friends and
fellows and were connived together to lie
him into dependence upon their grati-
tude—even to poison him through the oily
words of the boy and the deceit of the
woman who once had succored him.
Forthwith he called up in fair Portuguese:

  "Good-bye. You have on one side
land, on other side comes king’s ship.
Maybe your fetish save you. You say you
make me rich. Now I am rich, for I take
my life in trade for your life. Go, you
stinking murderers and liars.”

  Thus dismissing them the big black
man, one-time court linguist to the Daho-
man king who had sold him, paddled for
that African shore where the mangrove
jungle grew almost to the very surf.
  Hill Drums

By HENRY S. WHITEHEAD

The weird power of a song—how the Blacks of the Danish West
Indies harried a British consul-general

WHEN Mr. William Palgrave, Brit-
ish consul-general at St. Thomas,
Danish West Indies, stepped out
of his fine residence on Denmark Hill,
he looked, as one local wit had unkindly
remarked, "like an entire procession!”
It could not be denied that handsome
Mr. Palgrave, diplomat, famed author of
travel articles in the leading British mag-
azines, made at all times a vastly impos-
ing appearance, and that of this appear-
ance he was entirely conscious.

   One blazing afternoon in May, in the
year of Grace, 1873, he came statelily
down the steps before his house toward
his open carriage, waiting in the roadway
below. On the box Claude, his negro
coachman, sagged down now under the
broiling sun, conversed languidly with
one La Touche Penn, a street loafer
whose swart skin showed through various
rents in a faded, many-times-washed blue
dungaree shirt. Seeing the consul-gen-
eral descending, Claude straightened him-
self abruptly while La Touche Penn
slouched away, the white of an observant,
rolled eye on Mr. Palgrave.

   As this ne’er-do-well strolled noncha-
lantly down the hill—the hard soles of a
pair of feet which had never known the
constriction of shoes making sandpaper-
like sounds on the steep roadway—he
whistled, softly, a nearly soundless little
tune. Claude tightened his reins and the
small, grass-fed, somnolent carriage-
horses plucked up weary heads, ending
their nap in the drowsy air. That was
how Mr. Palgrave liked to find his ap-

pointments—in order; ready for their
functions. Mr. Palgrave—so another St.
Thomas wit—was not unlike the late
General Braddock whose fame is in the
American histories; in short, a bureau-
cratic martinet whose wide travels, soon
to bring him greater fame as the distin-
guished author of Ulysses, had failed
signally to modify a native phlegmatic
bluntness.

  He came down the steps, a resplendent
figure of a fine gentleman, dressed with
a precise meticulousness in the exact mode
of the London fashion, and, glancing
after the furtive wastrel now well down
the hill road, he caught the whistled tune.
As he recognized it he frowned heavily,
pursing his lips into a kind of pout which
went ill with his appearance of portly,
well-nourished grandeur. This accom-
plished diplomat was fastidious, easily
annoyed. Not to put too fine a point
upon it, he did not like St. Thomas.

  For one thing he disliked feminine
names for places, and the capital town in
those days was called Charlotte Amalia,
after one of Denmark’s queens. It was
a coquette of a town, a slender brunette
of black eyes and very red lips and cheeks;
a Latin brunette of the smoldering, gar-
ish type; a brunette who ran to mantillas
and coquetteries and very high heels on
her glistening slippers.

  Various times had Mr. Palgrave in his
blunt manner compared to Charlotte’s
disadvantage her alleged beauties with the
sedate solidity of his last post, Trebizond
in Armenia, whence he had come here to
the Caribbean. At first these animadver-
HILL DRUMS

541

sions of his had been lightly received.
Charlotte Amalia was a tolerant lass.
This was, perhaps, only a strange variety
of British banter! Society had let it go
at that; would probably have forgotten all
about it. But then the consul-general
had made it plain, several times, that he
had meant quite literally exactly what he
had said. At that Charlotte, though still
tolerantly, had been annoyed.

Finally he had been—unconsciously;
Charlotte granted that quite definitely—
offensive. He had said certain things,
used certain terms, which were—inadvis-
able. The way he used the word "na-
tive”, society agreed, was bad diplomacy,
to put it mildly. Society continued, be-
cause he was a Caucasian and because of
his official position, to invite him to its
dinners, its routs, its afternoon teas, its
swizzel parties. Government House took
no notice of his ineptitudes, his compari-
sons.

The British families, and there were
many of these permanently resident in
St. Thomas—Chatfields, Talbots, Robert-
sons, MacDesmonds—were, of course,
the backbone of his social relationships.
Some of them tried to give him hints
when they saw how the wind was veering
against him and wishing their own diplo-
matic representative to be clear of criti-
cism, but these well-intentioned efforts
slipped off Mr. Palgrave’s uncompromis-
ing broad back like water from a duck’s!

Then he had really put his foot in it.
The leading English magazine to which
he was a valued contributor brought out
an article by him—on Charlotte Amalia.
Here the already famous author of travel
articles had commented, in cold print, and
disparagingly, upon the society of which
he was, for the time being, an integral
part. He had, too, been so injudicious
as to compare Charlotte Amalia with
Trebizond, vastly to the advantage of the
542

WEIRD TALES

Armenian capital. Trebizond, if the man
had any sentiment in him, must, at that
period, have seemed very attractive in
retrospect.

It was chiefly the British West Indians
who took in the magazine, but there were
a few others. The news of the article
spread like wildfire. Extra copies, at
Lightbourn’s store, were quickly exhaust-
ed. Other copies were ordered. Extant
copies were worn dog-eared from fre-
quent readings of that faux pas. It fin-
ished Mr. Palgrave in Charlotte Amalia.

A consul-general, and of Great Britain,
can hardly be ignored in a comparatively
small community. Nevertheless Char-
lotte Amalia now drew in her perfumed
skirts in no unmistakable gesture. There
was, of course, nothing overt about this
gesture. Charlotte was far too subtle, far
too polite and sophisticated after the Con-
tinental manner, for anything crude; any-
thing, that is, smacking of the consul-
general’s own methods! But there was
an immediate difference, a delicate, sub-
tle difference, which, as the weeks pro-
gressed, was to make its impact upon the
consciousness of William Palgrave,
through his thick mental epidermis, in a
very strange manner indeed.

For it had penetrated elsewhere than
to the very outer edges of St. Thomas
society. It had got down to Black Qua-
shee himself; down through the various
intervening social strata—minor officials,
a few professional persons, shopkeepers,
artizans—down to Quashee in his tattered
shirt; shoeless, carefree Quashee, at the
very bottom of Charlotte Amalia’s social
scheme.

Early that spring, at the time when
house servants become mysteriously
ill and have to be relieved of their duties
for a few days, and the Rata drums,
Fad’er, Mama, and Boula de Babee, may

be heard to roll and boom nightly from
the wooded hills in the island’s interior,
and the Trade Winds’ changing direction
leaves an almost palpable curtain of sul-
triness hanging over the hot, dry town on
its three hillsides; in those days when the
burros’ tongues hang out of dry mouths
along dusty roads and the centipedes
come into the houses out of the dust, and
street dogs slink along blazing sidewalks
in the narrow slits of house-shade under
the broiling sun of late May-time —
then, as the Black People came trick-
ling back into the town from their
three or four-day sojourn in the hills
when they make the spring songs—then
it was that the Honorable William Pal-
grave began to be conscious of a vague,
partly realized annoyance, an annoyance
which seemed to hang in the air all about
him. . . .

  As he lay on his handsome carved ma-
hogany bedstead during an early-after-
noon siesta; as he sat in his cool shaded
office before his great desk with its dis-
patch-boxes in orderly rows; as he dressed
for dinner after his late-afternoon bath—
taken in the tin tub which he had lugged
about the diplomatic world for the past
eighteen years—at such times the new
annoyance would drift to him in whispers,
on the dull wings of the sultry air so hard
to breathe for one of his portly habit.

  It was a sound-annoyance; a vague,
thin, almost imperceptible thing. It was
a tune, with certain elusive words; words
of which he heard recurrent bits, snatches,
snippets, incidental mere light touches of
a delicate, withering sarcasm—directed
toward him as a child might blow thistle-
down with faint derisive intent in the di-
rection of somebody who has managed
to incur its dislike.

  The St. Thomas negroes, so it became
borne in upon Mr. Palgrave’s under-
standing, had "made a song on’’ him.
HILL DRUMS

543

  It was a characteristic, quickstep kind
of song; something in the nature of a
folksong. Of these there are various ex-
amples, like the one wherein the more
urban St. Thomian makes fun of his
Santa Crucian neighbor by alleging that:
"De Crucian gyurl don’ wash dey skin,”
md which ends on the rollicking chorus:
"Wash yo’self in a sardine-tin!”

  In the course of the weeks in which he
was obliged to listen to it, Mr. Palgrave
came to recognize the tune, and even a
few of the words, which, because of
almost incessant repetition, had been
forced, though with a delicacy that was
almost eery, upon his attention. The tune
went to the lilt of the small drum—Boula,
de babee—somewhat as follows:

  The words, of which there were many,
resolved themselves, so far as his appre-
ciation of them was concerned, into two
first lines, and a refrain, thus:

  Weelum Palgrave is a Cha-Cha, b’la-hoo!

  Him are a koind of a half-a-Jew!

  Then the refrain:

  Him go back to Trebizond.

  There were, in these apparently Mother
Goose words, various hidden meanings.
"B’la-hoo,” a contraction from "bally-
hoo,” is the name of a small, hard-fleshed,
surface-water fish, not unlike the flying-
fish in consistency, and living, like its
winged neighbor, on the surface of deeps.
As used in the verses it intensified "Cha-
Cha.” A Cha-Cha—so-called, it is cur-
rently believed in St. Thomas, because of
the peculiar sneezing nasality with which
these French poor-whites enunciate their
Norman French—is one of a peculiarly

St. Thomian community, originally emi-
gres from St. Bartholomew’s, now so
thoroughly inbred as to look all alike—
brave and hardy fishermen who can not
swim; West Indian poor-whites of the
lowest class, like the Barbadian "red-
legs.” A Cha-Cha B’la-hoo means a par-
ticularly Cha-Chaish Cha-Cha; an in-
dubitable Cha-Cha. The application of
such a term to the consul-general meant
that he was of the lowest sort of humanity
the St. Thomian negro could name.

  Being "half-a-Jew” did not at all mean
that Mr. Palgrave partook, as the hearer
might easily imagine, of any character-
istics believed to inhere in the co-religion-
ists of Moses and Aaron. The phrase had
a far deeper—and lower—significance
than that. The significant portion of it
was that word "half.” That, stated plain-
ly, meant an aspersion upon the legitimacy
of Mr. Palgrave’s birth. It was, that epi-
thet, essentially a "tu quoque” type of in-
sult—you’re another! It referred directly
to one of Mr. Palgrave’s mordant asper-
sions upon the quality of the St. Thom-
ians, or, rather, upon the class, the
negroes, which was now retaliating. It
was not the usual custom of these negroes
to marry. It had not been their custom in
Africa. Their Danish overlords did not
compel it here. Why should this for-
eigner, this Bukra of the double-chin,
cast his aspersions upon them? How was
he concerned? Not at all, was Black
Quashee’s obvious reply, according to the
logic of the situation. His equally obvious
retort, to drum-beats, was:

Him are a koind of a half-a-Jew!

  But—the real gist of the retort, com-
pared to which these glancing blows at
his self-esteem were mere thrusts of the
banderillo, goads—was the refrain:

Him go back to Trebizond.

  It was not, precisely, a command. It
was still less a statement of accomplished
544

WEIRD TALES

fact. Mr. Paigrave had not gone back to
his esteemed Armenian post; Mr. Pal-
grave had no intention whatever of ap-
plying to Downing Street for a transfer
back there. It was—a suggestion.

It was that refrain which La Touche
Penn had been whistling as he walked
demurely away down the glaring white
road under the blazing sunlight. Mr.
Paigrave stared angrily after the slouch-
ing figure; stared after it, an uncompro-
mising scowl upon his handsome, florid
features, until it disappeared abruptly
around a sudden turn half-way down the
hill. Then he mounted the step of his
barouche and settled himself in the exact
center of the sun-heated leather cushion,
a linen dust-cloth over his knees.

IT WAS a Tuesday afternoon, and later,
at five o’clock, it was Mr. Palgrave’s
intention to call at Government House.
Governor Arendrup was receiving that
afternoon, as he did once a month, but
between now and then there was an inter-
val of an hour and a half which the con-
sul-general meant to spend in making
duty calls.

Claude, very erect, drove carefully
down the hill, turned the sharp corner
around which La Touche Penn had dis-
appeared, and thence, by a devious route,
descended the slight slope leading to the
chief thoroughfare along the sea’s edge.
Here he turned to the left, passed that
massive structure, the Grand Hotel, driv-
ing between it and Emancipation Park,
turned once more to the left, and soon
the wiry little carriage horses were sweat-
ing up one of Charlotte Amalia’s steepest
hills. They moved carefully around hair-
breadth turns guarded by huge clumps of
cacti, and at last emerged near the summit
of Government Hill. Claude stopped
before the entrance to a massive residence
perched atop a still higher rise in the land.

  Mr. Paigrave climbed steps to the stone
and cement terrace of this house and
gave to the expressionless black butler his
card for Mrs. Talbot. The servant took
his stick and hat and led the way up a
flight of stairs to Mrs. Talbot’s drawing-
room. As the consul-general mounted
behind his ebony guide he became aware
of a tap-tapping, a light sound as though
made by the fingers of a supple hand on
a kitchen pan. The tapping went: "oom
—bom, bom; oom—bom, bom; oom—
bom, bom,” over and over, monotonously.
Accompanying this beat was a light,
almost a childish, voice; one of the black
maids, probably, in some distant portion
of the great house. The tune was the
tune La Touche Penn had been whistling
as he slouched down the hill. Mr. Pai-
grave mentally supplied the words:

  Weelum Paigrave is a Cha-Cha, b'la-hoo!

  Him are a koind of a half-a-Jew—

  Him go back to Trebizond!

  It was maddening, this sort of thing.
It should not be allowed. Here, in Mrs.
Talbot’s house! A choleric red disfigured
Mr. Palgrave’s handsome face as he
walked into the drawing-room. It took
him several minutes to reassume his ac-
customed urbanity. . . .

  Something Mrs. Talbot said, too, was
annoying.

  "I am sure I can not say where I ac-
quired the idea, Mr. Paigrave, but—
somehow—it came to me that you were
not remaining with us; that you were
expecting to go back; to Armenia, was it
not?”

  "I have no such intention—I assure
you.” Mr. Paigrave felt himself suddenly
pink in the face. He used his handker-
chief. May, in this climate, is very warm.
Mrs. Talbot hoped he would not mind the
summer heat.

  "We find the sea bathing refreshing,”
she had vouchsafed. . . .

                     W. T.—7
HILL DRUMS

Mr. Palgrave did not outstay the
twenty-minute minimum for a duty call.
As he descended the broad stairway he
heard the tap-tapping once more, but now
the words accompanying it were muted.
There was no song. He found himself
repeating the doggerel words to the tap-
ping of that damnable pan:

Him go back to Trebizond.

Absurd! He should do nothing of the
sort. Only fancy—blackamoors! To sug-
gest such a thing—to him! He descended
the steps to the roadway a picture of com-
placent dignity.

A tiny barefooted black child strolled
past, an empty kerosene-tin balanced on
her kinky, kerchiefed head. The child,
preoccupied with a wilted bougainvillea
blossom which she held between her
hands, hummed softly, a mere tuneless
little murmur, barely audible on the fresh-
ening Trade Wind of midafternoon. Mr.
Palgrave, his perceptions singularly sensi-
tive diis afternoon, caught it, however.
His directions for the next call were given
to black Claude almost savagely.

Precisely at live he mounted the steps
of Government House. He was
saluted in form by the pair of Danish
gendarmes, in their stiff Frederick the
Great uniforms, from each side of the
doorway. He subscribed his name and
titles in the visitors’ book. He gave up his
hat and stick to another saluting gen-
darme, and mounted the interior stairway
to the great drawing-room above.

    Here all St. Thomas society congre-
gated monthly at the governor’s reception,
and with those who had arrived on time
this afternoon die drawing-room was half
filled. The Governor’s Band, outside on
the east end of the iron gallery which
runs along the front of Government
House, started up an air. Officers, offi-
W T—8

cials, the clergy, the town’s gentry, the
other resident consuls, and the ladyfolk
of all these, passed solemnly in review
before the governor, stiff in his black
clothes, shaking hands formally in his
box-like frock coat, his spotless white kid
gloves.

  Mr. Palgrave, still ruffled from his
afternoon’s experiences, greeted His Dan-
ish Majesty’s representative in this loyal
colony with a stiffness quite equal to the
governor’s, and passed within. Ladies
seated at both ends of a vast mahogany
table in the dining-room dispensed coffee
and tea. Mounded along the table’s sides
stood great silver trays of "spread”,
half-sandwiches of white and brown
bread covered with cheese, with preserves,
with ground meats, with liver-pastei. At
the sideboard Santa Cruz rum, made in
the colony, French brandy imported from
Martinique, and Danish beer in small
bottles and served with fine pieces of ice
in the glasses, were being rapidly dis-
pensed by liveried negro servants to a
crowd which stood eight deep.

  From this group a burly figure, that of
Captain the Honorable William McMil-
lin, detached itself and accosted Mr. Pal-
grave. The captain, administrator of
Great Fountain Estate over on Santa Cruz,
here for the day on some estate business
for his kinsmen the Comyns family who
all lived in Scotland and for whom he
managed their Santa Crucian sugar inter-
ests, had been as a freshly commissioned
Cornet of Horse, one of Wellington’s offi-
cers more than fifty years before, at
Waterloo. The old gentleman invited
Mr. Palgrave to a bottle of the Carlsburg
beer, and the two Britons, provided with
this refreshing beverage, sat down to talk
together.

  In their armchairs the two made a
notable appearance, both being large-
bodied, florid men, and the aged captain
546

WEIRD TALES

wearing, as was his custom on state occa-
sions, his ancient scarlet military coat.
Outside the great open French windows,
the band members on the gallery, between
pieces, made themselves heard as they ar-
ranged their music. Save for the band-
master, Erasmus Petersen, a Dane, all
were negroes. Through the windows
came minor musical sounds as a slide was
shifted in an alto horn or as little runs
and flutings tested the precision of a new
tuning. In the midst of this, delicately,
almost incidentally, the oboist ran his
swart fingers over his silver keys, breathed
into his instrument. A rippling, muted
little quickstep came through the win-
dows:

  Weelum Palgrave is a Cha-cha, b’la-hoo!

  Mr. Palgrave suddenly shifted in his
armchair. Then he remembered that he
could not appear to notice this deliberate
slap in the face, and, though suddenly
empurpled, he sat quiet. He collected his
wits, invited the captain to dinner that
evening, and excused himself.

  Claude, attentive for once, noted his
emergence below, extricated his barouche,
reached the steps where the two wooden-
soldierlike gendarmes were saluting his
master.

  "Home!” said Mr. Palgrave, acidly,
stepping into the carriage.

That evening Mr. Palgrave opened
his grief to his fellow Briton, as to a
person of assured position and integrity,
the consul-general’s face quite purple
between his vexation and the bottle of
sound burgundy he had consumed at
dinner.

  The captain took his consul-general’s
annoyance lightly.

  "Man, man!” he expostulated, "ye’re
no so clearly accustomed to 'Quashee’ and
his ways as mysel’, I do assure you. Why

—there’s a song about me! My field-
hands made it up, years ago. It runs:

Mars' McMillin la’ fb’ me,

Loike him la’ to Waterloo!

  "And it means that I command them—
that is to 'la,’ Mr. Palgrave—the same as
I gave commands at Waterloo—there
were a-precious few, I do assure you, sir.
I was no more than a comet at the time,
my commission not two weeks old.” The
captain proceeded to pooh-pooh the
Quashee songs as reason for serious an-
noyance.

  But his explanations left Mr. Palgrave
cold.

  "Your negroes do not—er—insist upon
your returning to the Low Countries to
fight Waterloo all over again!” was his
bitter comment. That suggestion that he
return to Trebizond had bitten deep. . . .

  He had Trebizond on his mind when
he was retiring that night and it is not
strange that he went back there where he
had spent two profitable years before
being assigned to Charlotte Amalia, in his
dreams. Somehow, as the strange distor-
tion of the dream-state provides, he was
identified with the sage Firdusi, a great
hero of Armenian legend, that same
Firdusi who had defied a Shah of Persia
and refused to compose a history of his
life at the imperial command.

  Identified with Firdusi, of whom he
had heard many tales, Mr. Palgrave
suffered imprisonment in his dreams; was,
like Firdusi, summoned again and again
into the Presence, always with refusal
on his lips; always to be sent back to a
place of confinement of increasing com-
fortlessness.

  At last Palgrave-Firdusi returned to an
empty cell where for days he sat on the
earthen floor, refusing to yield, to stultify
himself. Then, on a gray morning, his
jailer entered leading a blind slobbering
negro who sat on the floor opposite him.
HILL DRUMS

547

For an interminable period he suffered
this disagreeable companionship. The
Black was dumb as well as blind. He sat
there, day after day, night after night,
cross-legged on the hard floor.

At last Palgrave-Firdusi could stand it
no longer. He howled for his jailer, de-
manded audience. He was led to the
throne room, his resolution dissipated, his
one overwhelming desire to acquiesce—
yes, yes; he would write—only let him be
free of that slobbering horror which
mewed to itself with its blank slab of a
mouth. He threw himself face down be-
fore the throne. . . .

The impact of his prostration awakened
him, shivering, in his great mahogany
bed. The moonlight of the Caribees
poured through the opened jalousies of
the airy bedroom high on the hillsides of
Charlotte Amalia; and through the open
windows came eerily—it was three o’clock
in the morning—the very ghost of a little
lilting refrain in the cracked voice of
some aged man:

Him go back—to Trebizond.

Mr. Paigrave groaned, rolled over in
bed so that his better ear was undermost,
sought to woo sleep again.

But now it was impossible to sleep.
That time—that devilish, that damnable
tune — was running through his head
again, tumultuously, to the small-drum
throbbing of his heart. He groaned and
tossed impatiently, miserably. Would
morning never come?

IN A gray dawn Mr. Paigrave rose from
an unrefreshing bed, tubbed himself
half-heartedly. His face, as he looked at
it in his shaving-mirror, wielding his
Wednesday Wade & Butcher, seemed gray
and drawn; there was no color in his usu-
ally choleric cheeks. The servants, at this
hour, would not have arrived. There would
be no morning tea ready.

  At a little before seven, fully dressed,
Mr. Paigrave descended the staircase to
his office below. He sat down at his order-.
ly desk, listening to the shuffle of early-
morning bare feet outside there on the
earthen hillside roadway before his fine
house; to the clipped, grave snatches of the
creole speech of the Blacks; to the occa-
sional guffaws of the negroes about their
early-morning occasions; gravely erect;
carrying trays, fruits, great tins of cistern-
water, atop kerchiefed heads.

  Mechanically he reached for his writ-
ing-materials, dipped a pen in an inkwell,
commenced to write. He wrote on and on,
composing carefully, the edge of his mind
engaged in listening for the song out
there on the roadway. He discovered that
he was tapping out its cadence with his
foot on the scrubbed pitch-pine flooring
underneath his desk: oom—bom, bom;
oom — bom, bom; oom — bom, bom;
oom—bom, bom!

  He finished his letter, signed it metic-
ulously, blotted it, folded it twice, then
heard the latch of the remote kitchen door
snap. He rose, walked into the dining-
room, and spoke through the inner kitchen
door to Melissa his cook who had just ar-
rived:

  "Make me some tea, at once, if you
please.”

  "Yes, sar.” It was the dutiful, monoto-
nous, unhurried voice of old Black Me-
lissa as she motivated herself ponderously
in the direction of the charcoal barrel in
the kitchen’s corner.

  Mr. Paigrave reflectively mounted the
stairs to his bedroom. He was putting a
keen edge on his Wednesday razor—he
used a set of seven—before it dawned
upon him that he had already shaved! He
returned the razor to its case. What could
be the matter with him? He looked mus-
ingly into his shaving-mirror, passed a
well-kept hand reflectively over the
548

WEIRD TALES

smooth cheeks into which the exercise of
moving about and up and down the stairs
had driven a little of his accustomed high
color. He shook his head at his reflection
in the glass, walked out into the upper
hallway, redescended the stairs, once more
entered his office.

What was this?

He frowned, stared, picked up from
the desk the letter he had finished ten min-
utes before, examined it carefully. It was,
unquestionably, in his own handwriting.
The ink was barely dry. He laid it back in
its place on the desk and began to pace
the room, slowly, listening to Melissa’s
slow movings-about in the kitchen, to the
arrival of other servants. He could hear
their clipped greetings to the old cook.

Wondering at himself, at this strange
mental world where he found himself, he
seated himself firmly, judicially, in his
ample desk chair, picked up the letter,
read it through again with an ever-increas-
ing wonderment. He laid it down, his
thoughts turning, strangely, to Trebizond.

And Mr. Palgrave could not, for the life
of him, recall writing this letter.

He was still sitting there, staring
blankly at nothing, his brows drawn to-
gether in a deep frown, when Claude came
in to announce tea prepared in the dining-
room. "Tea,” in St. Thomas, Continental
fashion, is the name of the morning meal.
"Breakfast” comes at one o’clock. Mr.
Palgrave’s cook had prepared amply that
morning, but not bacon and eggs, nor even
Scotch marmalade, availed to arouse
him from his strange preoccupation.

After "tea” he sat again at his desk
alone until ten o’clock, when his privacy
was invaded by two sailors from a British
vessel in the harbor, with consular busi-
ness to transact. He gave these men his
careful attention; later, his advice. He
walked out with them an hour later, turned

up the hill and strolled about the steep
hillside streets for an hour.

  It was nearly high noon when he re-
turned. He passed the office, going up-
stairs to refresh his appearance after his
walk. It was blistering hot outdoors under
the May noon sunlight drenching the dusty
roadways.

  When he went into his office half an
hour later he saw the letter once more. It
was enclosed now, in an official envelope,
addressed, too, in his own unmistakable
handwriting, duly stamped for posting.
Again, he had no slightest recollection of
having done any of these things. He picked
up the letter intending now to tear
it across and then across again and fling
the bits of paper into the waste-basket. In-
stead he sat with it in his hands, curiously
placid, in an apathetic state in which he
seemed not even to think. He ended by
placing it in his coat pocket and jvas im-
mediately afterward summoned to the one
o’clock "breakfast” in the dining-room.

     hen he awakened from his siesta
that afternoon it was near four
o’clock. He remembered the letter at
once. He rose, and before his afternoon
bath examined the coat pocket. The letter
was not in the pocket. He decided to look
for it on the desk later.

  In half an hour, fresh and cool now
after his bath, he descended the stairway
and went straight into his office. The let-
ter was on his mind, and, frowning slight-
ly, he stepped toward the immaculately
neat desk. He drew down his lip under
his teeth in a puzzled expression. The let-
ter was not on the desk.

  The arrival of callers summoned him
into the drawing-room. He did not give
any thought to the letter again until din-
ner-time and then he was at the top of
Government Hill at one of the British
HILL DRUMS

549

houses and could only postpone his desire
to find and destroy it.

The letter failed to turn up, and the
next day came and passed, and the next
after it, and the days stretched into weeks.
He had almost forgotten the letter. It
cropped up mentally now and then as a
vague, half-remembered annoyance.
Things were going better these days. The
song and its varied accompaniments of
drum-tapping, whistling, humming of the
nearly soundless tune, the encompassing
annoyance it had caused him—all these
things seemed to have dropped out of the
hearing, and consequently out of the mind
of the consul-general. He felt, as he half
realized, somewhat more at home now in
Charlotte Amalia. Everybody, it appeared,
was perfectly courteous to him. The at-
mosphere of vague hostility which had
vaguely adumbrated his surroundings was
gone, utterly dissipated. The charm of the
town had begun to appeal to this sophis-
ticated traveler of the earth’s surfaces.

Then one morning among the letters
which the Royal Mail steamer Hyperion
had brought into the harbor the night be-
fore he discerned an official communica-
tion from his superiors in London.

He opened it before any of his other
letters, as was natural. . . .

The Under-Secretary had written grant-
ing his urgent request to be sent back to
Trebizond. He was requested to take im-
mediate passage to any convenient Medi-
terranean port and to proceed thence di-
rect to the Armenian capital. It was, at
the moment, agreeable to the consular
service that he should be there. Sugges-
tions followed in the letter’s text, desig-
nating various policies to be pursued.

He finished the many sheets of thin
onion-skin paper, folded the letter and
laid it on the desk, and sat, staring dully
at his inkwell. He did not want to go
back to Trebizond. He wanted to remain

here. But—he had no choice in the mat-
ter. He cudgeled his brains warily. He
recalled his singular apathy at the time
when his letter—written, it seemed, as
though subconsciously—had disappeared.
He had not wanted to write that letter.
He recalled that there had been confusion
in his mind at the time—he could not, he
recalled, remember the actual writing,
nor sending it after it was written. There
was something very strange here, some-
thing— unusual! Indubitably he had
applied for transfer to Trebizond. To
Trebizond he was ordered to go!

  Charlotte Amalia, that coy Latin-
brunette of a town with her coquetteries
and her too-garish coloring, and her deli-
cate beauties—Charlotte Amalia had
schemed for his departure, forced his
hand, driven him out. He sat there, at
his desk, thinking, ruefully, of many
things. Then his pride came to his res-
cue. He remembered the slights which
had been put upon him, those intangible
slights—the almost formless little tune
with its absurd, gibberish words; the tap-
ping of pans; the rattle and boom of the
hill drums, those detestable night drums
on which these stupid-looking, subtle
blackamoors were always and forever, and
compellingly, tapping, tapping, tapping.

  And before very long Mr. Palgrave,
who did not believe in magic and who
pooh-poohed anything labeled "eery” or
"occult” as absurd; who believed only in
unmistakable matters like sound beef and
County Families and exercise and the in-
tegrity of the British Empire and the in-
variable inferiority of foreigners—Mr.
Palgrave came to see that in some fashion
not accounted for in his philosophy Char-
lotte Amalia had played him a very
scurvy trick—somehow.

  Bestirring himself he began to exam-
ine the inventory which he kept of his

which no British gentleman could be ex-
pected to exist. He indited to the har-
bor-master a cold, polite note, requesting
notice of the arrival of vessels clearing for
Mediterranean ports or ports on the Black
Sea—Odessa for choice—and he began to
formulate, in his small, precise handwrit-
ing, the list of duty-calls which must be
made before his departure. In the pauses
between these labors he wrote various po-
lite, stiff notes, and in the very midst of
such activities Claude summoned him to
midday breakfast.

  Leading the way to the dining-room
after this announcement; Claude paused
at the office doorway, turned a deprecat-
ing face to his employer.

  "Yes?” said Mr. Paigrave, perceiving
that Claude wished to address him.

  ' Yo’ is leave us, sar,” said Claude, with
courteous absence of any inflection or em-
phasis on his words which would indicate
that he was asking a question.

  "Yes—I am leaving very shortly,” re-

plied Mr. Paigrave unemotionally. He
added nothing to this statement. He was
a stiff master to his servants, just but dis-
tant. Servants had their place and must
be kept in it, according to Mr. Palgrave’s
scheme of life.

That night, his sleep being rather fit-
ful, Mr. Paigrave noted that the drums
were reiterating some message, insistently,
up in the hills. . . .

Neither Claude, who as coachman-
butler had the closest contact with his em-
ployer of any of the house servants, nor,
indeed, old Melissa nor any of the others,
made any further remark to their em-
ployer concerning his departure. This
took place three days, later, on a Nether-
lands vessel clearing for Genoa; and Mr.
Paigrave was probably the very last per-
son in St. Thomas who would have asked
any personal question of a servant.

Yet he wondered, when it occurred to
him—and that was often—just how
Claude had known he was leaving. . . .

The Blood
Veins of the Robot

  By L. HARPER ALLEN

     A grim story of a miser whose mechanical man was fed by
     a stream of golden coins

ARAM MANDRAGA was wizened,
withered and old when he came
**■ alone from Armenia and settled
down in a little shop just off Sutton Place.
The place was dingy and dark, but
stocked with rugs, pile upon pile, precious
weaves of Ispahan, Tabriz, Aragh, Ka-

shan, Hamadan, Kerman, Sarouk. To the
fastidious few it soon became known;
discriminating buyers, experienced deal-
ers and decorators—and Aram Mandraga
prospered.

Aram Mandraga had a god. Also, he
revelled in a certain form of music, a
THE BLOOD VEINS OF THE ROBOT	551

never-failing symphony which solaced his
soul. His god was money—his music
the metallic clink of minted coins.

  Always, as he walked, Mandraga
would thrust his hands into his pockets
and run his trembling fingers among the

many coins he carried. It was joy to his
spirit to hear them clink together. His
eyes would brighten, his step would
quicken and over his seared face would
creep a smile, but it was a smile that
chilled—the smile of a miser. He never
552

WEIRD TALES

did this within the hearing of any one
but himself. Mandraga was selfish of his
music, and besides, it was pleasant to him
to appear to be poor—it seemed to aid
him in his business and afforded him, no
doubt, protection against robbery and
against prying eyes.

The covering was worn from the but-
tons on his coat; the cloth upon his
elbows was thin and polished with long
service. He feigned poverty so assiduous-
ly that he scarcely bought food sufficient
to sustain him, and therefore he some-
times went hungry. Strangers who passed
him on the street often thought of him as
a beggar, and that pleased him consider-
ably, for if the world believed him poor
the world would not rob him. An odd
character was Aram Mandraga!

If one had been sufficiently interested
to have investigated, he would have been
exceedingly surprized to discover that
Aram Mandraga had purchased the prop-
erty in which he dwelt and carried on his
business. A mortgage had been fore-
closed. The two-storied brick house on
the little side street had been put up for
sale. It had gone for a song. And some
material part of Mandraga’s accumulated
wealth had provided the music.

The building was not large. It was
certainly not beautiful. But it was strong
—the walls were thick—and that sufficed.
Into this house Mandraga had moved his
stacks of rugs and a quantity of old fur-
nishings. In the upper part he lived,
behind closed shutters, its sole tenant.

When the nights were dark he would
see that the shutters were fastened most
securely, bolt the doors below stairs and
above with the heavy bars with which
every opening had been provided, and by
the light of a sputtering candle unlock
certain chests which were hidden about
the quarters and filter through his
trembling fingers the gold and silver

coins that filled them. And his heart
would pound in unwonted rhythm to
their music.

  Satisfied, Mandraga would then relock
the chests, push them back under his bed
or into their accustomed places, tie the
small keys about his neck, blow out the
candle and creep into bed, where the
blended echoes of gold and silver would
lull him to sleep. When there was a
moon, he would open one of the shutters
slightly. Enough light would filter
through the iron bars with which the
windows were additionally protected to
make, the candle an expensive luxury.
Moonlight cost him nothing.

  One by one the rugs on the floor below
were disappearing; the stacks were grow-
ing smaller, the precious stock which he
had moved into his dingy shop was
becoming depleted. Expensive rugs they
were, too; antiques, many of them, which
he had disposed of at figures which ran
into the thousands. Only Mandraga and
the expert buyers knew their value—and
Mandraga got their price. Checks, drafts,
yellow bank-notes, bills, all these Man-
draga quickly translated into metal coins
—quarters, half-dollars, gold pieces of
every denomination. The more money
and the greater variety in sizes and ap-
parent tone, the merrier the music. These
coins were his slaves. He owned them,
body and soul. They were the blood of
his very life.

  "Slaves!” he considered. "I have given
my life for them! Now they are mine;
they give their lives to me!”

  He ruminated. Rugs! They had not
been his slaves. They had but provided
him with a means to obtain his end, to
enthrall the hundreds of thousands of
silver and golden slaves which were now
imprisoned in the many chests. To others
there was something indefinable in the
mystic carpets of the East, romance,.
THE BLOOD VEINS OF THE ROBOT

553

dreams, perhaps, in their subdued color-
ing which had withstood the ravages of
the centuries. To Mandraga they were
drab, colorless—but worth their weight
in silver and gold coins. They consumed
nothing; as they aged, they grew more
valuable. Slaves, human slaves, had re-
quired feeding. With age their value had
decreased. And then—there was sickness
—and loss. He had chosen well.

  Years ago, he remembered, there were
profits to be made in the traffic of slaves.
In Armenia, Syria, Turkey, Persia, men
had become rich in that business. They
had made money that might just as well
have been his. But he had chosen rugs!
The buying and selling of slaves had a
risk that terrified him. They were ill-
treated and ill-fed; many of them were
old and one or more might die on his
hands. The loss of their lives was noth-
ing, but—the loss of profits! If only he
could have bought their souls. Souls
never die, he had heard somewhere.

  "My little slaves make music,” he pon-
dered. "But I want greater music—more
regular music. Only at night I hear their
voices; for more than twenty hours they
are silent, hidden in the chests.”

  Could he but contrive some apparatus
that would keep them playing their magic
chords—their sweet symphony—forever?
Could he find a way to listen to their con-
tinuous jingling day and night without
cessation? Perhaps! Some mechanical
contrivance could be fashioned which
would accomplish this. He would build
one, an automaton of some sort in which
his silver and golden coins would course
through slots in regular order, dropping
one after another—now a gold piece
against a silver coin; now two small silver
coins against a deep-toned double eagle.
What combinations he could provide for
-—the many different notes of the scale he
could arrange to please his fancy! And

the coins could roll along through these
innumerable slots like blood in the veins
of a man. That was it! Veins with gold
and silver blood! It must be continuous
—never-stopping—like a radio receiving
set in constant synchronization with a
never-silent broadcasting station. Aram
Mandraga’s eyes glittered with uncon-
trolled joy. He would be master of this
never-ending bloodstream. Each coin
would sing again and again its sweetest
note. It would pass on through the
mechanism of the machine—Mandraga’s
mechanical Golem—the monster concrete
Robot he would build—and he would so
contrive that each coin, after it fell, would
again be lifted up by some mechanical
device which he would construct, to take
its place once more in the metal stream
at the top. Continuous music! It might
be made to go on—on—on—night and
day!

Weeks went by. Only a few rugs
remained from the great store with
which Mandraga had stocked his dingy
shop. Another chest was now filled with
metal coins. The music each night grew
the sweeter and the more mellow as his
horde increased. He was growing old,
he reasoned now. Creeping age would
soon enfeeble him. It took considerable
exertion at times to drag the chests from
beneath the bed and from under the
window-seats which he had constructed
to hide thern from evil-intentioned eyes.
A little while now, and he could sit idly
by and listen to the musical clinking of
the coins. He had been pondering over
that idea of his—money making its own
music; a constant, methodical jingling
and blending of those wondrous voices.
A plan had gradually formed itself in
his mind.. Materials had been accumu-
lated. Hundreds of pieces of curved
metal tubing, fiber-lined—long, short,
554

WEIRD TALES

medium lengths—of many different sizes,
had been cut to Mandraga’s designs.
These, with strangely contrived lifting-
devices on endless chains, gears and other
paraphernalia, were collected in the rear
of the little shop downstairs where the
rugs had once been stacked. Less than a
dozen pieces of his once prized stock now
remained. The rugs were vanishing, but
the many chests were full.

  Sacks of cement, piles of stone and
sand, several sheets of perforated steel.
Aram Mandraga’s plans were at last com-
plete. It had cost him many of his little
blood-slaves to fashion the thing of con-
crete and metal which he had designed in
his mind’s eye—but he had made his
resolve; his mechanical Robot was ready
to be assembled. And then, music—never
to be stopped—unless he so willed. The
coins, his slaves! Constant-rushing blood
through the metal and fiber veins of his
automaton! Tingling music—always that
music! The concrete Robot with the face
and form of a gigantic man—his Slave.
With the blood he would feed it, it
would tingle with ever-pulsing life. The
pressure of his finger, and the life would
depart from its veins—and his music
would likewise stop. But Mandraga’s fin-
gers would again start the brave music.
Jingle, tinkle, all the thousand variations
in tone would once more be resumed!
His man of stone would live! Thou-
sands of little slaves within the monster
Slave—the little finger of Aram Man-
draga to control them.

  Rugs! Romance of the looms! Magic
carpets of the East! Bah! They had been
lifeless things. Only a means to the end.
Money only mattered. Coins—hard,
metallic silver and gold coins—they were
his god. Their friendly voices, his sub-
lime orchestra. And now—tap, tap, tap—
their music might go on in continuous
rhythm.

  A few days passed. But one rug re-
mained in the little dingy shop—a faded
brown prayer rug from Kashan. Aram
Mandraga took this to his living-quarters
above. There would be more room in the
shop below in which to mix the cement,
when the workmen came.

The next day and for many days there-
after, workmen were busy in the
Mandraga house. Aram followed them
about and directed. He moved his belong-
ings into the front part of the upper floor.
First, they walled in all the windows on
the lower floor. Then the low ceiling in
the rear half of the erstwhile shop was
torn out, a solid dividing-wall built across
the room, stairs constructed which led
down to this squared room from the floor
above.

  When they had finished, the result of
their labors stood in the center of the
high, two-storied room. It was massively
built, from the solid ground beneath the
floor to the height of eighteen feet. Its
general outlines were those of a man—
but Mandraga had overlooked nothing—
the finishing touches would be put on by
his own hand. Plaster and cement had
been prepared. He would mold the fea-
tures into the semblance which he had
designed. To the workmen, it had ap-
peared only a machine of some sort which
they were constructing. Mandraga would
fashion its huge proportions in secret. He
would color it in black and white; it
would have thick red lips and a yellow
face. Its eyes would move; its tongue
would push in and out; its ears, as large
almost as those of a young elephant,
would twitch. It would show life—as
long as the stream of the little coins
flowed on through its metal veins.

  Its walls were several inches thick,
leaving an interior at its base nearly five
feet wide. A man could walk about com-
THE BLOOD VEINS OF THE ROBOT

555

fortably, standing erect. The floor of
concrete sloped down from the center at a
slight angle. The pinnacle at the center
was flattened into a small cup-like plat-
form about nine inches across. The slight-
ly sloping floor was round in shape, with
slots set in at intervals to accommodate
the chain mechanisms which Mandraga
had designed to elevate the various coins
to the hopper of concrete constructed at
the very top. The flattened tubes of vari-
ous sizes curved from the hopper down
into the space above the small, round,
sloping-sided platform. Twisting and
curving as they were, they had the ap-
pearance of entrails in a living mechan-
ism. Each tube opened at some point
directly over the exact center of the little
platform. Mandraga had so adjusted
each separate tube that a coin dropping
from the hundred or more of these veins,
as he had called them, would strike each
upon the identical spot of the cup-like re-
ceiver. A little pile of coins would always
remain there, against which the falling
silver and gold would clink. The other
coins would roll off into the sloping pit
over the edges and be picked up by the
constantly operating lifting-apparatus, to
be carried once more to the hopper above.
Then again, each coin would start once
more upon its journey.

  There were two small windows, a few
inches square, set in the back of the con-
crete monster, just behind the shoulders.
Through these, narrow shafts of light
slanted downward to the apex of the
cone-shaped sounding-platform upon
which the coins would fall. Narrow slots
in the ^indow-shutters on the upper
floor were arranged so that they could be
opened at will, the outside light-rays per-
mitted to penetrate to the small, barred
openings. There would be the glint of
sunlight upon the fast-falling pile of gold
and silver coins, whenever Mandraga

entered the little door and feasted his
eyes upon the constant-flowing stream
beating out its rhythm on the glowing
anvil below the slots.

The little door in front was as strong
as the door of a vault, as, in fact, it was.
Mandraga had discovered this firmly
built door among the cast-off debris in a
building-wrecker’s junk heap. The door
and its framework had been set firmly
into the concrete base of the man-shaped
effigy. Three little keys, inserted one
after another, turned one after another,
permitted it to be opened. Keyholes were
in the rear of the little iron door, as well
as in front, so that it could be unlocked
from the inside should occasion demand.
When closed, the three steel bolts auto-
matically shot into the sockets of the
frame in the manner of a snap-lock.
Mandraga carried the three little keys
among the other keys on the string about
his neck.

There was another door, set just inside
the opening. It was fashioned of per-
forated steel sheets which Mandraga had
gilded a burnished bronze. His fancy had
streaked it with strange designs in red
and black. It swung back into the cham-
ber just sufficiently wide to let him
squeeze through whenever he entered.
When his music would play, the iron
door would be left open—thrown wide;
the mellow chords would filter through
sweetly between the thousands of little
openings in his improvised screen. What
radio instrument could provide such
harmony? Innumerable buttons were set
into a control board just at the side of
the outer door. A slight pressure on any
one of them would close a corresponding
opening among the many slots in the
hopper at the top of the figure standing
so weirdly in the high room. At Man-
draga’s finger tips were the nerve-centers
which controlled the bloodstream of his
556

WEIRD TALES

monstrous music-box. He would experi-
ment in the manner of the man—There-
min by name, as he recalled it—who had
drawn music from the air with the wave
of his hands and the flourish of his fin-
gers, blending the sounds of chaos into a
perfect harmony. Thousands, millions of
little voices were his to regulate in the
fiber-lined tubes inside. He would make
them play their melodies day and night.
From his balcony above, where he had
now set his bed, he could listen to their
music even in his sleep—their intonations
reverberating into his subconscious brain.

  Time went on. The strange-looking
monster stood forth in all its unearthly
glory. Its wide eyes rolled this way and
that in controlled abandon, the big black
pupils as large as a plate. Its face was
fashioned of rubber over a pliable mesh
of wire. Levers and rollers kept it in
motion, the cheeks distending, the heavy
jaws and creased forehead moving slowly
like the features of a live monster—or the
product of a nightmarish dream. Yellow-
white teeth would be exposed; the tip
of a wide, red tongue would protrude
from between them. Restless ears would
quiver. The scalp below the matted black
hair would move. Aram Mandraga had
fashioned his masterpiece with studied
care. It was inhumanly human.

  His cleverest stroke of genius had been
the building of the coin-lifting device. It
required power. It must be continuously
operative. There must be no expense. At
first he had considered building some sort
of perpetual-motion device. No! That
wouldn’t do. Such ideas were crazy.
Mandraga would have none of them. So
he purchased a small, strong, slow-speed
motor, set it into a niche in the concrete
base where its whir would not interfere
with the mellow strains of the music-
machine, and fitted a constant-dripping
oiling attachment so that it would never

become overheated with the continuous
friction. It could whirl on for a year
without attention. Then he tapped the
electric wires which passed over his roof
and led into the buildings on either side.
He carefully concealed his theft so that
prying eyes would not discover the two
wires which he inserted through a hole
he had drilled between the bricks and
connected up with the little motor. There
was his power. Power forever. It
would cost him nothing. Thin copper
tubing led down from the central oil-tank
to each gear and pinion in the quiet-
moving series of lifting cups. No friction
would mar the plaintive strains which the
many coins would play.

When Mandraga had finished the
fashioning of the strange-built
vault which he had planned to house his
little gold and silver slaves, he stood in
admiration before the cyclopean monster
of his creation—pleased with the work of
his brain and hands. Now, he would start
the blood-flow in its veins.

  He carried the coins from the chests to
the hopper in the head of the figure, lift-
ing up the pressed-steel lid which formed
the scalp and which locked into place by
the manipulation of a lever from the in-
side of the chamber at the base. Trip
after trip he made over the narrow planks
from the edge of his chamber-balcony to
the shoulders of his man of stone. The
chests were empty—the hopper now full.
In a moment he would start the motor,
the hopper would vibrate convulsively as
he had designed it, the current of gold
and silver coins would slip into their ap-
pointed slots in much the same manner
as the brass matrices are distributed in the
magazine of the linotype machine. His
man of stone and metal would be en-
dowed with life. The blood-veins of the
Robot would teem with yellow and silver-
THE BLOOD VEINS OF THE ROBOT

557

white cells. His Slave—his Golem—his
Frankenstein monster would live. He
took down the planks. He sat on the
edge of his overlooking balcony, his legs
dangling over into the well below his
feet. He pressed the switch-button which
controlled the motor, close to his hand.
The eyes began to move; the rubber-
covered features to expand and contract.
The coins were flowing. Then there came
to his straining ears the clink, clink, clink
of metal against metal. The melody of
melodies had begun!

  Day and night, Aram Mandraga sat on
the edge of his balcony or in the rickety
armchair before the golden perforated-
steel door, the outer vault door thrown
wide. He would squeeze inside some-
times and watch the ever-dropping stream
of coins glinting in the rays of the slant-
ing lights filtering down from the little
windows above the shoulders. That would
be the only light. The chamber would be
in darkness except for that little patch of
gold and silver rays beneath the hundreds
of little slots adjusted to a nicety in the
exart center of the coin-filled cup that
formed the anvil against which the little
musicians played their symphony. Their
work done, their note struck, they would
flow over into the slight-sloping pit like
water over the lip of a fountain. Into the
gutters around the circular deposit-pit
they would fall. The little cups of the
ever-moving elevators would pick them
up and carry them back to continue their
music.

  Night and day, Mandraga would fin-
ger the little buttons on the slot control
board, regulating the pace of the little
devils of the machine. They obeyed him
implicitly. They sang their varying
moods. The thing of rubber and wire
showed that it, too, was alive to the fas-
cination of the metallic intonations re-
sounding in the little chamber at its base.

The ever-flowing stream gave it vitality.
Its yellow face gleamed with joy and life;
its eyes seemed to brighten with insane
delight that matched the glistening pleas-
ure shining forth through Aram Man-
draga’s own as he listened in idle ecstasy
to the music dripping within the vault,
rolling and ringing in sweetest harmony.

  Day and night, night and day, the
plaintive chimes played on. There was
something almost pathetic in the childish
way poor old Mandraga would unlock
the vault door and sink into the armchair
for his daily round of melody after a rest-
ful, blissful sleep. Going up and down
the ladders while he had been molding
his stone man into the creature that now
stood grimly in the high-ceilinged room,
had been toilsome work for a feeble old
man like Mandraga. But the subsequent
music had lent unusual strength to his
already tottering legs and palsied hands.

  "My little slaves,” he observed, glee-
fully. "My prisoners, paid for with my
life’s blood!” He stood back and grinned
up at the twitching rubber face. "And
you—my creature; it’s my blood that flows
through your veins! It plays for me! It
makes you live! It drips through your
veins—drips—drips—drips; hard, firm
metal—pounding against hard, firm metal
that never yields; my little coins!”

  He went back to his chair. He picked
up the little prayer rug from Kashan—
the last of his stock.

  "Two hundred dollars you should have
given me!” he pleaded. "Four hundred
deep-toned voices that might fall through
the half-dollar slots! Eight hundred
soprano notes for the slots that hold my
little quarters! Forty golden chimes in
the slots that hold my half-eagles! Ten
melodious double-eagles that might have
given me music! You are useless—wasted
—you are soft like a cushion-”

  He pushed open the burnished-gold
558

WEIRD TALES

screen with the strange designs in black
and red. He squeezed through and stood
in ecstasy before the little pile of gold
and silver flowing over the lips of the
small, raised platform beneath the slot-
openings, bathed in the dimming rays
filtering down through the little barred
windows. He still clutched the faded
brown prayer rug in his withered right
hand.

He had set the slots at a measured
pace. The bloodstream dropped method-
ically in the very center of the pile just
beyond his feet. Drop—drop—drop;
gold and silver-throated voices! All con-
trolled by his little finger! He had drawn
the iron vault door shut, the better to hear
the magical music. A few minutes alone
with his singing pleasure-makers! Then
he would slip the three little keys in -the
lock, go outside to his deep armchair and
listen to their harmony throughout the
night. The concert was more wonderful
than ever tonight. The filtering moon-
light coming through the regulated open-
ings in the upper window shutters, down
into the music vault, glinted blue-white
against the silver and gold. He crouched
in a corner and closed his eyes, so that
vision might not share with hearing. The
music thrilled, then soothed his tired
faculties, and at length his white head
nodded and Mandraga slept.

When Mandraga opened his eyes he
knew not for the instant where he
was, until his ear caught the sound of
the falling coins tinkling into the gutters.
He was chilled and aching with a sensa-
tion of great weight bearing him down.
He tried to rise from his cramped posture,
but his stiffened limbs responded weakly
and he struggled to his feet with consid-
erable difficulty. His footing slipped. He
reeled, and would have fallen had not the
walls of the vault supported him. He was

seized with a choking sensation, and in
nervous haste stretched his thin hand up-
ward to clutch the string about his neck
which held the keys. His trembling fin-
gers touched it—fumbled nervously with
it for a fraction of a moment. He would
open the door—get out into the air; the
little windows were not providing suffi-
cient ventilation.

The string was between his fingers. It
broke! The keys jingled down into the
heaped pile of coins tumbling happily in
the outward-sloping pit at his feet. As
they struck, they rang with a clink that
seemed to mock the methodical clink of
the coins dropping down from the
mouths of the slots above the little mound
in the center. He reached down for them.
His groping hands could not locate them
among the shifting coins.

As the full significance of his appalling
situation forced itself upon Mandraga, his
knees gave way and he sank in a limp
and motionless heap—a prisoner with his
wealth. His eyes were closed. His head
had fallen sidewise—directly under the
slots above the heap of coins in the cen-
ter. Each falling coin struck him on the
temple and glanced off among its merry
companions, to be picked up by the ris-
ing cups and started again upon its down-
ward journey.

Mandraga was yet conscioils; but with-
out the power to move. His mind was
active. The coins smote him with pen-
dulum-like regularity, until each one
pained like a knife-thrust.

"So hard—these metal coins,” he whis-
pered inwardly. "They strike so hard—
metal strikes on metal—that makes my
music—these tones are soft—as if—they
strike on a cushion. That was it! A cush-
ion—so that they wouldn’t strike so hard!
If only — my Kashan rug —my little
prayer rug—was over my face—protect-
ing me-” He tried to draw the rug
THE BLOOD VEINS OF THE ROBOT

559

to his head, but his weakened fingers
would not respond to the command of his
will. It was no use. There could be no
cushion to protea Mandraga’s temple.

Now, the melody of the falling coins
came to him indistinaly, as if they were
a great way off, and he felt the pain no
longer. Aram Mandraga was drifting—
drifting in a golden ship over a golden
sea. The shimmering waters rocked him
gently. The waves covered him with glit-
tering spray. Then Mandraga fell into a

dreamless sleep—a sleep wherein the
heart stops and the flickering lights of life
go out. The coins continued to fall in
measured accents, chanting a weird re-
quiem and wasting their music. The
motor whirred on relentlessly; the lifting
cups replenished the hopper above the
slot openings; the blood flowed on and
on within the veins of the grim man of
stone, whose twisting, grimacing yellow
face fronted ominously the empty bed on
the balcony.

The Abominable Snow Men

  By FRANK BELKNAP LONG, Jr.

      Blue shadows lay upon the crater’s rim,

      And far above the town a traveller moved
      In circles through the snow; his eyes were dim
      From glint of sun on ice in worlds improved.

      A thousand feet below him at an inn

      His host smiled wanly, said: "The fool will find

      Small prints upon the snow—so small, so thin—

      He will not know that they are prints which bind.”

      "He will not know that they are prints which bind!”

      His very words gained substance on a height,

      As to his knees the traveller fell, half-blind,

      And grovelled in the dimness of his sight.

      "They dwell in barrows on a skyward wold
      And make no sound; shrill hunger is their goad:

      ’Tis said they feed on men when men are bold,

      When men are scarce on flesh of fowl or toad.”

      The silence on the heights gave way to shrieks
      As to a shattered cairn the traveller clung
      And fought a shape with bright and slimy streaks
      Of blood upon its fat, protruding tongue.

      They came in swarms from out the crater’s rim,

      The thin snow men, abominable and cold;

      They came in swarms, and tore him limb from limb
      And strewed his flesh in ribbons on the wold.
THE FINISHING
TOUCHES

By RENIER WYERS

A diabolical little story of an artist who painted a bestial picture of honors
that had better been left alone

TANDRIV said that he had come
to borrow money. Blake gave it
to him willingly. Had they not
formerly been good friends? Of course
that was long ago and Tandriv obviously
had degenerated since then. Yet—Blake
wanted to aid him in some way—just for
"auld lang syne.”

And for "auld lang syne” Blake tried
to stir up conversation. "Is there any-
thing else I tan do?” he asked as his vis-
itor pocketed the money.

"No!” replied Tandriv gruffly; then
added with an attempt at courtesy, "I’ve
been working hard. I’m nervous. Don’t
want to seem ungracious. Thanks.”
Blake nodded. He found it difficult
to realize that this wreck of a man was
the Tandriv who had been his classmate
but a few years before. The once thick,
glossy black hair now hung in dead, gray-
ing strands over the tall wrinkled brow
that had been fair and smooth. Deep
grooves of bitterness were plowed in the
pasty cheeks. The Tandriv eyes which
had always been a bit too bright, now
gleamed as two yellow-green orbs that
were danger signals of approaching mad-
ness.

"Are you working on a painting?”
Blake inquired tentatively.

"Yes.”

"I’d like to see it sometime, Tandriv.”
A cold smile that came dangerously
dose to being a sneer crept over the
other’s features. "You wouldn’t like it,
Blake. Our ideas of art differ. You’ve
become famous for your flattering por-
560

traits, idealizing commonplace people,
while I have—wefl, I’m here borrowing
money tonight, from you.”

His expression grew hateful. Spring-
ing to his feet he began pacing back and
forth.

"But my time will come!” he cried, ges-
ticulating wildly. "Too long the world
has been blinded by illusions of piety and
goodness—lies. You and everyone else
striving for 'beauty’ will be forgotten
when I’m worshipped. There is no 'beauty’
in real life or real art. There’s only pain,
and cruelty, and horror—that’s what I’m
painting.”

Blake’s curiosity was aroused. He re-
membered their art student days and how
untractable Tandriv had been. No one
could teach him anything about art! He
refused to follow the classic standards of
composition or color. Then, too, the re-
calcitrant Tandriv’s choice of models had
been the talk of the art colony. He would
frequent the lowest dives in Paris and
haunt the slums, looking for subjects to
portray on canvas. Aged, drunken wom-
en; garbage-grubbing old men who had
lived too long; idiots; misshapen crip-
ples; lascivious-faced vixens; murderous
Apaches; rat-like sneak-thieves—all were
limned by the Tandriv brush in those
early student years.

"If I remember correctly,” said Blake,
"what you are saying now is quite consist-
ent with some of the ideas—and subjects
—you entertained in Paris.”

"Bah! That was only the beginning,”
                     W. T.—8

snorted Tandriv. "I’ve made great strides
since then.”

"Toward what?”

"Toward what? Immortality! I’ll prove
it to you. Come to my place, Blake, and
I’ll show you a creation, the like of which
no man has ever seen before—on canvas.”
There was a fanatical enthusiasm in his
manner and a hint of forbidden revela-
tion in his tone that resulted in Blake’s
accompanying him.

A brisk twelve-minute walk brought
them to a bleak, treeless district of
poverty-tainted tenements and ugly fac-
tory buildings.

"Here’s an atmosphere you 'nice’ ar-
tists avoid,” said Tandriv as they strode
along through the deserted streets. Save
for the widely spaced street-lamps there
was no light on the thoroughfare. Even
the dwelling buildings were darkened, for
people who must live in tenements must
rise early and light bills drain the pennies
from kitchen shelves.

"Here’s where life is raw and un-
veneered,” he added. "Here the real
man comes to the surface, selfish, cow-
ardly, and treacherous. Dog eat dog, you
know. Beauty? Ha! In spots like this,
in every big city on the globe, glorious
man, made in His image and likeness,
spawns the future criminals of the world.
Don’t think that this slum is but a phase
of life with no relation to the rest of the
city. It’s the rotten heart of it; the en-
slavement of men, women and children
behind those factory walls makes it possi-
ble for 'refined’ ladies to pay you big
prices for their portraits.”

He tapped Blake’s arm and turned
down a side street, meaner than the rest.
"We’ll be there in a minute,” he said.

Passing through an areaway between
two tenement houses they came upon a
refuse-littered yard. A white, full moon

broke clear of the clouds and mercifully
camouflaged the scene with white splashes
of light and black shadow. Carefully
stepping over and around heaps of rub-
bish and tin cans which prowling rats
could not believe were quite empty, the
two men came to Tandriv’s door, at the
side of a long, flat, brick house.

  Once inside, Tandriv turned the switch
on an unshaded light bulb. "What a de-
pressing workshop!” thought Blake as he
blinked his eyes and looked about. The
light revealed the interior of the house as
being one long, narrow room, its brick
walls unpainted. No ceiling hid the
cross-beam that supported the roof. Dirt
and disorder were everywhere. Paints,
canvases, clothing, and cooking-utensils
were strewn about, indicative of the slov-
enliness of the man who ate, slept, and
painted here.

  Blake’s attention, however, was soon
drawn to a huge painting leaning against
the rear wall of the studio. It reached
from the floor to the roof and from one
side wall to the other, fitting snugly be-
tween. It was fully fifteen feet high
and at least three times as wide.

  "Good Lord! Tandriv!” gasped Blake
hoarsely. "What is it? What does it
mean?”

  Revolted, yet fascinated by the very
hideousness of the painting, he stared at
it for a long time. It was like looking
into an immense window of hell, against
which swarmed a myriad of things with
distorted faces and ectoplasmic bodies,
seeking to enter this world from a terrible
dimension outside human ken.

  Now Blake knew what Tandriv had
meant when he said his earlier works had
been "only the beginning.” These things
were the development. The painting was
a decadent exaggeration of all evil with
all trace of anything redeeming omitted.
It was an array of bestial, libidinous
562

thoughts given a semblance of ugly, ante-
human form by a brush that had been
dipped in oils of primordial ooze. So
crowded with the Things was the canvas
that no background or perspective was
shown.

  One figure in particular, near the cen-
ter of the picture, seemed to reveal the
motif of the work to Blake’s startled eyes.
It had a sinister, elongated, ocher-colored
face, surmounted by a gnarled forehead
from which protruded two horns. Its
upper torso was of human proportions but
covered with bluish-green scales. Rearing
up on two furry goat-like legs that ter-
minated in cloven hooves, it appeared the
most menacing of all because of its like-
ness to man and because of the malignant
intelligence in its features.

  "That shall be my masterpiece,” Blake
heard Tandriv hiss. "I’m putting my very
soul into it. I’ve been planning it, sketch-
ing it for years—gathering material for
its execution and seeking atmosphere for
it in all parts of the world.

  "You know that I started my search
while we were studying together,” he
went on, "but you did not know what be-
came of me after that. I’ve been every-
where. I’ve witnessed black masses pre-
sided over by apostates from every creed.
I went eastward and southward to the
cradle of the human race and human sin.
I went farther eastward and lived among
the outcasts from Lhassa who crouch in
wind-swept caves of the Tibetan Him-
alayas. For more than a year, with my
skin dyed black as coal, I officiated at
voodoo rites in the West Indian jungle.

  "Who is better qualified to paint that
picture than I?” he concluded boastfully.

  "But Tandriv, it’s horrible—obscene.
What are you striving for?”

  "What difference does it make to you?”
Tandriv retorted. "I tell you I’ve had a
‘call’ to make that painting—a commis-

sion from the powers that ruled before
man and his gods and will rule again.”
Then, observing Blake’s fixed stare, he
added, "That central figure, which appar-
ently interests you, is my guide and in-
spiration. Call him Lucifer, Ahrimanes,
Belial, Satan, or what you will—names
and words mean nothing. But my por-
trait will awaken the world to what and
who he really is.”

  All vestige of sanity was wiped from
his face as he raised his clenched fists and
cried deliriously:

  "Only a few more finishing touches
and my work will be done. I must finish—
I must paint what I see—the only things
I see! Night and day, for years they have
burned themselves into my brain. The
real things of life, Blake—real! Real!”
"Then you and I see life differently,”
said Blake with an uneasy little laugh. He
regretted having come to view this dia-
bolic daub. Although he tried to look at
it objectively, it had started a mental
maelstrom in which his critical faculties
and primal fears whirled about confused-
ly, making technical shop-talk impossible.
Well, he didn’t have to stand here gazing
at the accursed picture. Besides, Tandriv,
somewhat calmer now, was still decidedly
unsociable. Apparently he wanted to get
back to work at his evil miscreation. There
was no use trying to reason with him.
Blake left. . . .

  Returning to his own apartment, he
tried to forget what he had seen. But
the pageant of foulness persistently in-
truded upon his consciousness. He dozed
in fitful slumber. Every time he closed
his eyes the painted horrors danced before
him. After an interminable period of
restless tossing he arose. Gray day was
breaking.

Mechanically donning his clothing
he left the house. For some rea-

 He led me to a private ward. In it a twisted old man sat in a wheel-chair playing

 "That,” said the doaor, "is Hayworth. He is blind.”

I stared in disbelief. That pitiful, twisted creature my Viking friend? Impossible!

 Suddenly the Thing looked up. I screamed in horror.

 Have you ever seen a man who was terribly burned? That glassy texture of skin,
 like polished marble? Such was the face of my friend—shiny, slick, like some poison-
 ous fish. He opened his eyes, and stared into brimming pools of horror. They
 were not the eyes of a person gone naturally blind. They looked as if they had been
 drilled with a red-hot poker. The whites were gone. Simply a black, burning depth
 remained. And yet, you understand, the eyeball was not destroyed.

 "George,” I cried. "It is Henry. Don’t you know me?”

 I approached.

 Suddenly the creature drew back withered lips from yellow fangs. Staggering
 to its feet, it swung the heavy cane with the strength of a madman-

son not quite clear to himself he followed
the route he and Tandriv had taken some
hours before. As in a dream, he trudged
through the morning fog and turned into
the cold, damp areaway.

Stepping into the disordered little yard,
he pulled himself up out of his somnam-
bulistic state with a start. Something had
happened! People were standing about.
Poorly clad working-people from the
neighborhood were standing in a huddled
group, talking with subdued excitement;
a note of superstitious awe ran through
their murmuring. Two uniformed po-
licemen stood guard before the door to
Tandriv’s studio.

" ’Tis the devil,” Blake heard one pug-
nacious little old woman say, "that got
Mister Tandriv. Didn’t I hear him a-
talkin’ with the devil many a night? An’
didn’t I see the red fire of hell a-gleamin’
through the cracks in his door and win-
dow shades?”

'‘Yes, yes, I heard him, too,” said an-
other woman, fumbling with a shawl
about her head.

"He was after callin’ to the devil ag’in
last night,” went on the first woman.
"Then all of a sudden there’s a rumblin’
like thunder only there’s no storm in the
sky and the rumblin’ comes from under-
ground; and there’s terrible wailin’ like
a thousand banshees and the red gleam
lights up the whole alley so that you can
see the rats run for cover.”

" ’Twas the wailin’ and screamin’ that
woke me,” said a third woman. "I told
my John to find out who’s makin’ the
awful racket in Mister Tandriv’s place.
But John wouldn’t get up, him sayin’ it’s
none of our business what a crazy artist
is doin’ in the middle o’ the night.”
Waiting to hear no more, Blake shoul-
dered his way through the crowd to the
policemen, the elder of whom, after sat-

isfying himself that Blake was not of the
neighborhood or an idle curiosity-seeker,
agreed to let him enter the studio.

  "It’s O. K., Cassidy,” the officer re-
marked to his younger partner. "Maybe
this man can throw some light on the
case—he says he knew Tandriv. But
mind you, don’t either of you touch any-
thing ’til the coroner comes.”

  Blake, escorted by the young patrol-
man, went inside. The place was a sham-
bles. It was as though titanic forces had
struggled here. Every piece of furniture
was smashed. In the center of the debris
was the mangled body of Tandriv.

  "There’s been hell to pay here,” ob-
served Cassidy as he and Blake stood over
the corpse. Prepared as he was for the
worst, Blake could not restrain a gasp of
horror at what he saw. The body, gro-
tesquely twisted, was heaped on the floor
as though it had fallen from a great
height or been violently hurled to the bare
boards. From its twisted position it was
apparent that both legs and arms were
broken. The eyes of the victim were
rolled upward, their pupils half hidden
under the upper lids. As a final touch to
the terrible deed, there was stamped on
the dead man’s brow the impression of a
cloven hoof.

  "We couldn’t figure out what kind of
a weapon made that mark,” said Cassidy.
"What do you think? What do you be-
lieve killed him?”

  "They did—those Things,” cried Blake
impulsively, at the same time swinging
about to point at the huge canvas that

leaned against the rear wall. "They-”

  He stopped short, his mouth agape,
and stared with amazement. The broad
expanse of gray-white canvas was blank!
"What were you saying, Mr. Blake?”
"Nothing, officer,” he managed to re-
ply weakly; "I don’t—know. Let’s go
outside.”

Once he was nearly caught by that neck

  Then Tsang seemed to tire. His parries

Fletcher, it was a heart-breaking sound;
it indicated triumph.

With a sigh, the small Chinese relaxed.

Fletcher made a mighty effort to rise,
to go to Tsang’s rescue. He lurched to

through his froth-covered lips. He closed

UNHAPPY is he to whom the mem-
ories of childhood bring only
fear and sadness. Wretched is he
who looks back upon lone hours in vast
and dismal chambers with brown hang-
ings and maddening rows of antique
books, or upon awed watches in twilight
groves of grotesque, gigantic, and vine-
encumbered trees that silently wave
twisted branches far aloft. Such a lot the
gods gave to me—to me, the dazed, the
disappointed; the barren, the broken.
And yet I am strangely content and cling
desperately to those sere memories, when
my mind momentarily threatens to reach
beyond to the other.

   I know not where I was born, save
that the castle was infinitely old and in-
finitely horrible, full of dark passages
and having high ceilings where the eye
could find only cobwebs and shadows.
The stones in the crumbling corridors
seemed always hideously damp, and there
was an accursed smell everywhere, as of
the piled-up corpses of dead generations.
It was never light, so that I used some-
times to light candles and gaze steadily
at them for relief, nor was there any sun

outdoors, since the terrible trees grew
high above the topmost accessible tower.
There was one black tower which readied
above the trees into the unknown outer
sky, but that was partly ruined and could
not be ascended save by a well-nigh im-
possible climb up the sheer wall, stone by
stone.

  I must have lived years in this place,
but I can not measure the time. Beings
must have cared for my needs, yet I can
not recall any person except myself, or
anything alive but the noiseless rats and
bats and spiders. I think that whoever
nursed me must have been shockingly
aged, since my first conception of a living
person was that of something mockingly
like myself, yet distorted, shriveled, and
decaying like the castle. To me there was
nothing grotesque in the bones and skel-
etons that strewed some of the stone
crypts deep down among the founda-
tions. I fantastically associated these
things with everyday events, and thought
them more natural than the colored pic-
tures of living beings which I found in
many of the moldy books. From such
books I learned all that I know. No
teacher urged or guided me, and I do not
recall hearing any human voice in all
those years—not even my own; for al-
though I had read of speech, I had never
thought to try to speak aloud. My aspect
 WEIRD TALES

 567

was a matter equally unthought of, for
there were no mirrors in the castle, and I
merely regarded myself by instinct as akin
to the youthful figures I saw drawn and
painted in the books. I felt conscious of
youth because I remembered so little.

  Outside, across the putrid moat and
under the dark mute trees, I would often
lie and dream for hours about what I
read in the books; and would longingly
picture myself amidst gay crowds in the
sunny world beyond the endless forest.
Once I tried to escape from the forest,
but as I went farther from the castle the
shade grew denser and the air more filled
with brooding fear; so that I ran franti-
cally back lest I lose my way in a labyrinth
of nighted silence.

  So through endless twilights I dreamed
and waited, though I knew not what I
waited for. Then in the shadowy solitude
my longing for light grew so frantic that
I could rest no more, and I lifted entreat-
ing hands to the single black ruined
tower that reached above the forest into
the unknown outer sky. And at last I
resolved to scale that tower, fall though
I might; since it were better to glimpse
the sky and perish, than to live without
ever beholding day.

IN the dank twilight I climbed the worn
and aged stone stairs till I reached the
level where they ceased, and thereafter
clung perilously to small footholds lead-
ing upward. Ghastly and terrible was
that dead, stairless cylinder of rock; black,
ruined, and deserted, and sinister with
startled bats whose wings made no noise.
But more ghastly and terrible still was the
slowness of my progress; for climb as I
might, the darkness overhead grew no
thinner, and a new chill as of haunted
and venerable mold assailed me. I shiv-
ered as I wondered why I did not reach
the light, and would have looked down
had I dared. I fancied that night had

come suddenly upon me, and vainly
groped with one free hand for a window
embrasure, that I might peer out and
above, and try to judge the height I had
attained.

  All at once, after an infinity of awe-
some, sightless crawling up that concave
and desperate precipice, I felt my head
touch a solid thing, and knew I must have
gained the roof, or at least some kind of
floor. In the darkness I raised my free
hand and tested the barrier, finding it
stone and immovable. Then came a dead-
ly circuit of the tower, clinging to what-
ever holds the slimy wall could give; till
finally my testing hand found the barrier
yielding, and I turned upward again,
pushing the slab or door with my head as
I used both hands in my fearful ascent.
There was no light revealed above, and
as my hands went higher I knew that my
climb was for the nonce ended; since the
slab was the trap-door of an aperture
leading to a level stone surface of greater
circumference than the lower tower, no
doubt the floor of some lofty and capa-
cious observation chamber. I crawled
through carefully, and tried to prevent
the heavy slab from falling back into
place, but failed in the latter attempt. As
I lay exhausted on the stone floor I heard
the eery echoes of its fall, but hoped
when necessary to pry it up again.

  Believing I was now at a prodigious
height, far above the accursed branches
of the wood, I dragged myself up from
the floor and fumbled about for windows,
that I might look for the first time upon
the sky, and the moon and stars of which
I had read. But on every hand I was dis-
appointed; since all that I found were vast
shelves of marble, bearing odious oblong
boxes of disturbing size. More and more
I reflected, and wondered what hoary se-
crets might abide in this high apartment
so many eons cut off from the castle be-
low. Then unexpectedly my hands came

upon a doorway, where hung a portal of
stone, rough with strange chiseling. Try;
ing it, I found it locked; but with a su-
preme burst of strength I overcame all
obstacles and dragged it open inward. As
I did so there came to me the purest
ecstasy I have ever known; for shining
tranquilly through an ornate grating of
iron, and down a short stone passageway
of steps that ascended from the newly
found doorway, was the radiant full
moon, which I had never before seen save
in dreams and in vague visions I dared
not call memories.

Fancying now that I had attained the
very pinnacle of the castle, I commenced
to rush up the few steps beyond the door;
but the sudden veiling of the moon by a
cloud caused me to stumble, and I felt
my way more slowly in the dark. It was
still very dark when I reached the grating
—which I tried carefully and found un-
locked, but which I did not open for fear
of falling from the amazing height to
which I had climbed. Then the moon
came out.

Most demoniacal of all shocks is that
of the abysmally unexpected and gro-
tesquely unbelievable. Nothing I had
before undergone could compare in ter-
ror with what I now saw; with the bizarre
marvels that sight implied. The sight it-
self was as simple as it was stupefying,
for it was merely this: instead of a dizzy-
ing prospect of treetops seen from a lofty
eminence, there stretched around me on
the level through the grating nothing less
than the solid ground, decked and diversi-
fied by marble slabs and columns, and
overshadowed by an ancient stone church,
whose ruined spire gleamed spectrally in
the moonlight.

Half unconscious, I opened the grat-
ing and staggered out upon the white
gravel path that stretched away in two
directions. My mind, stunned and chaotic
as it was, still held the frantic craving
WEIRD TALES	569

for light; and not even the fantastic won-
der which had happened could stay my
course. I neither knew nor cared whether
my experience was insanity, dreaming, or
magic; but was determined to gaze on
brilliance and gayety at any cost. I knew
not who I was or what I was, or what my
surroundings might be; though as I con-
tinued to stumble along I became con-
scious of a kind of fearsome latent mem-
ory that made my progress not wholly
fortuitous. I passed under an arch out of
that region of slabs and columns, and
wandered through the open country;
sometimes following the visible road,
but sometimes leaving it curiously to tread
across meadows where only occasional
ruins bespoke the ancient presence of a
forgotten road. Once I swam across a
swift river where crumbling, mossy ma-
sonry told of a bridge long vanished.

Over two hours must have passed be-
fore I reached what seemed to be my goal,
a venerable ivied castle in a thickly wood-
ed park, maddeningly familiar, yet full
of perplexing strangeness to me. I saw
that the moat was filled in, and that some
of the well-known towers were demol-
ished; whilst new wings existed to con-
fuse the beholder. But what I observed
with chief interest and delight were the
open windows — gorgeously ablaze with
light and sending forth sound of die gay-
est revelry. Advancing to one of these I
looked in and saw an oddly dressed com-
pany, indeed; making merry, and speak-
ing brightly to one another. I had never,
seemingly, heard human speech before;
and could guess only vaguely what was
said. Some of the faces seemed to hold
expressions that brought up incredibly
remote recollections, others were utterly
alien.

I NOW stepped through the low window
into the brilliantly lighted room, step-
ping as I did so from my single bright

moment of hope to my blackest convul-
sion of despair and realization. The night-
mare was quick to come, for as I entered,
there occurred immediately one of the
most terrifying demonstrations I had ever
conceived. Scarcely had I crossed the sill
when there descended upon the whole
company a sudden and unheralded fear
of hideous intensity, distorting every face
and evoking the most horrible screams
from nearly every throat. Flight was
universal, and in the clamor and panic
several fell in a swoon and were dragged
away by their madly fleeing companions.
Many covered their eyes with their hands,
and plunged blindly and awkwardly in
their race to escape, overturning furniture
and stumbling against the walls before
they managed to reach one of the many
doors.

  The cries were shocking; and as I
stood in the brilliant apartment alone and
dazed, listening to their vanishing echoes,
I trembled at the thought of what might
be lurking near me unseen. At a casual
inspection the room seemed deserted, but
when I moved toward one of the alcoves
1 thought I detected a presence there—a
hint of motion beyond the golden-arched
doorway leading to another and some-
what similar room. As I approached the
arch I began to perceive the presence
more clearly; and then, with the first and
last sound I ever uttered—a ghastly ulula-
tion that revolted me almost as poignant-
ly as its noxious cause—I beheld in full,
frightful vividness the inconceivable, in-
describable, and unmentionable monstros-
ity which had by its simple appearance
changed a merry company to a herd of
delirious fugitives.

  I can not even hint what it was like,
for it was a compound of all that is un-
clean, uncanny, unwelcome, abnormal,
and detestable. It was the ghoulish shade
of decay, antiquity, and desolation; the
putrid, drippirig eidolon of unwholesome

revelation, the awful baring of that which
the merciful earth should always hide.
God knows it was not of this world—or
no longer of this world—yet to my hor-
ror I saw in its eaten-away and bone-
revealing outlines a leering, abhorrent
travesty on the human shape; and in its
moldy, disintegrating apparel an unspeak-
able quality that chilled me even more.

  I was almost paralyzed, but not too
much so to make a feeble effort toward
flight; a backward stumble which failed
to break the spell in which the nameless,
voiceless monster held me. My eyes, be-
witched by the glassy orbs which stared
loathsomely into them, refused to close;
though they were mercifully blurred, and
showed the terrible object but indistinctly
after the first shock. I tried to raise my
hand to shut out the sight, yet so stunned
were my nerves that my arm could not
fully obey my will. The attempt, how-
ever, was enough to disturb my balance;
so that I had to stagger forward several
steps to avoid falling. As I did so I be-
came suddenly and agonizingly aware of
the nearness of the carrion thing, whose
hideous hollow breathing I half fancied
I could hear. Nearly mad, I found my-
self yet able to throw out a hand to ward
off the fetid apparition which pressed so
close; when in one cataclysmic second of
cosmic nightmarishness and hellish acci-
dent my fingers touched the rotting out-
stretched paw of the monster beneath the
golden arch.

  I did not shriek, but all the fiendish
ghouls that ride the night-wind shrieked
for me as in that same second there
crashed down upon my mind a single and
fleeting avalanche of soul-annihilating
memory. I knew in that second all that
had been; I remembered beyond the
frightful castle and the trees, and recog-
nized the altered edifice in which I now
stood; I recognized, most terrible of all,
the unholy abomination that stood leering
WEIRD TALES

571

before me as I withdrew my sullied fin-
gers from its own.

  But in the cosmos there is balm as well
as bitterness, and that balm is nepenthe.
In the supreme horror of that second I
forgot what had horrified me, and the
burst of black memory vanished in a
chaos of echoing images. In a dream I
fled from that haunted and accursed pile,
and ran swiftly and silently in the moon-
light. When I returned to the church-
yard place of marble and went down the
steps I found the stone trap-door immov-
able; but I was not sorry, for I had hated
the antique castle and the trees. Now I
ride with the mocking and friendly ghouls
on the night wind, and play by day
amongst the catacombs of Nephren-Ka in
the sealed and unknown valley of Hadoth
by the Nile. I know that light is not for
me, save that of the moon over the rock
tombs of Neb, nor any gayety save the
unnamed feasts of Nitokris beneath the
Great Pyramid; yet in my new wildness
and freedom I almost welcome the bitter-
ness of alienage.

  For although nepenthe has calmed me,
I know always that I am an outsider; a
stranger in this century and among those
who are still men. This I have known
ever since I stretched out my fingers to
the abomination within that great gilded
frame; stretched out my fingers and
touched a cold and unyielding surface of
polished glass.

  "That was a marvelous stroke. I am
beholden to.you for my life.”

  Tam flushed.

  "It was nothing,” he replied. "A great
swordsman taught me, and I have had
much practise on the hard skulls of buf-
faloes.”

  "Then you are a hunter. Can you find
meat for me? , I have not eaten for three
days, and am faint from hunger.”

  "I will get you much meat, and quick-
ly,” responded Tam. He picked up his
yatagan and wiped it on the flank of the
tiger. Here was meat, but not of a kind
that he could bring himself to eat. Leop-
ards, caracals, ounces, or any other felines
were all right for food according to his
ideas, but despite Lozong’s teaching he
could not get over the feeling that tigers
were his own kind—that to eat the flesh of
one of these beasts would be an act of
cannibalism. And it was quite evident
that the girl did not consider the beast he
had slain fit for food.*

  "Come with me,” he invited.
Together, they leaped the little brook,
crossed the grass plot, and entered the
bamboo thicket. As they were traversing
this, Tam heard the sound for which he
had been listening—the discordant cry of
a peacock.

  "Follow quietly behind me,” he said.
"There is food.”

  As he moved silently through the bam-
boos, he took his bow from the quiver,
strung it, and drew forth an arrow. The
bow twanged, and a magnificent bird fell
to the ground, where it fluttered for a
moment, then lay still.

Back to the brook they went, to pluck,
draw and wash the bird, and to build
a cooking fire. Soon they were broiling
slabs of peacock breast impaled on green
bamboo over the hot coals.

  "It tastes even better than it looks,”

said the girl as she sampled her first
mouthful.

  "It is the favorite meat of tigers,” re-
plied Tam between mouthfuls, " and they
are good judges of meat. They live on
it.”

  "You seem to know a great deal about
tigers,” said the girl. "Tell me who you
are, and more about yourself.”

  "My name is Tam,” he replied, "and
I was raised by a white tigress.”'

  "By a white tigress!” she exclaimed.
"The prophecy!”

  "What prophecy?”

  "It is a secret. I should not have men-
tioned it.”

"Never mind,” replied Tam, "I’ll for-
get it. Prophecies bore me, anyhow. Tell
me who you are, and where you live.”
"My name is Nina,” she said, "and I
live in Iramatri.”

  "Never heard of that country,” said
Tam, vbut I’ve heard the name, Nina.
She was a goddess, one of the first god-
desses, in faa. They worshipped her
about five thousand years ago.”

  "And longer,” replied the girl. "Fifty
thousand years ago men worshipped
Nina.”

  "There are no records that old,” said
Tam, "so how could you know that?”

  As he spoke, he looked into her eyes.
She was regarding him oddly. For some
reason a chill ran down his spine.

  "Why, you wear a uraeus!” he ex-
claimed, noticing her serpent diadem for
the first time. "Nina was a serpent god-
dess!”

  As he uttered these words her eyes
flashed with a strange light like that of
the rubies that smoldered in the uraeus.
They seemed to burn into his very being,
bringing a disconcerting sensation of ut-
ter helplessness/ He tried to move, to
shake off the feeling, but found himself as
powerless as if he had suddenly been

573

turned to stone. The meat which he was
holding over the coals burned to a crisp,
unheeded.

  "You know much for a modern earth-
ling,” said the girl, finally. "I thought
the world had forgotten Nina.”

  As suddenly as it had come, Tam’s feel-
ing of helplessness departed.

  "So it has, almost,” replied Tam.
"She has been worshipped under the
names of Ishtar, Isis, Ashtoreth, Tanit and
Persephone. As Tanit she still has a few
followers in the vicinity of old Carthage,
and as Ishtar, superstitions concerning her
are preserved throughout the world,
though her followers are referred to as
witches and wizards.”

  "She withdrew from the world five
thousand years ago,” said Nina, "because
of the crimes that were committed in her
name. Zealots stained her altars with
human blood. Parents offered their chil-
dren to be burned by sadistic priests, think-
ing to please her. These same priests
corrupted her vestal virgins, then, urged
by their lust for gold, made brothels of her
temples. And when she left the world of
earthlings, the priests set up graven images
in her place, and called upon the people to
worship these in her stead. She could
have destroyed them all, but preferred to
leave them to work out their own destruc-
tion.”

  "Which they did to perfection,” said
Tam. "There are ruins scattered around
the Mediterranean from Rome to Karnak
which testify to that. But tell me, how
is it that you know so much about this god-
dess. Can it be that you-?”

  He paused suddenly, as there came to
his ears a sound like the roll of distant
thunder—or elephants stampeding. The
girl heard it at the same time, and they
both stood up. Looking out over the wav-
ing grass tips, Tam saw, converging to-
ward them, a semicircle of beasts that

ders, and the tops of their massive heads
on long, arched necks, were from fifteen
to sixteen feet above the ground. They
were almost hairless, but protected by skin
as thick and leathery as that of the rhi-

giant riders, terrible of mien and most
extraordinary in appearance. At first Tam
thought there were two on each beast, but
as they drew closer he saw that each rider
was of immense size and had two pairs
of arms. They were a white race, but
pasty white, as if they had never seen sun-
light. Each monster carried a long-
shafted trident couched like a lance, a
bronze mace with a hideous human head
graven on the knob, and an immense tul-
war, a sword with a curved blade and an
elaborate guard. The fourth hand, wea-
ponless, held the reins which guided the

sprinted for the bamboo thicket. But
they had not gone a hundred feet when
they were halted by a shower of stones,
and there charged out at them from the
thicket a mob of hairy, shambling crea-
tures, man-like and yet ape-like. They
were armed with slings and clubs, and
each carried a bag of large pebbles that
hung from a cord around his neck.

  "They saw our smoke and sent the
Zargs to cut off our retreat before they
charged,” said the girl. "We are in a
trap.”

  Tam quickly strung his bow, and sent
an arrow through the breast of the fore-
most Zarg. He fell without a sound, and
the others paused, but did not cease hurl-
ing their stones. By this time the giant
riders had come within range. Tam
brought down the first of these with an
arrow through the left eye. Then he
heard a shout from the gold-helmeted
leader:

  "Dismount, Asoza, and cut down the
youth.”

  A pasty-faced giant, fully eight feet in
height, swung down from his high saddle
and ran forward, whirling his tulwar and
mace until they whistled in the air.

  Tam launched an arrow, which glanced
from the brazen collar. They he whipped
out his yatagan and dah, and awaited the
onslaught. As they came together, the
giant swung his tulwar in a neck-cut that
would have decapitated the youth had it
landed. But Tam ducked, and extended
his point, wounding his adversary in the
groin.

  After that they fenced, blade clashing
with blade, and Tam was sorely put to it,
not only to defend himself from the
whistling tulwar but to avoid the smash-
ing blows of the heavy mace.

  While he was thus occupied, he saw
the golden-helmeted leader swiftly ride up
to where the girl stood, stoop, and swing

gling. He had been fencing carefully
before, but this sight made him reckless.
Springing in close, he delivered a savage
shoulder cut. His blade bit through the
brazen collar, and shearing flesh and bone
alike, sliced down through the heart of
his adversary.

   But he paid for his temerity. The
heavy mace, swinging wildly in one of the
four flailing hands, collided with the side
of his head. There was a brief flash of
a million multi-hued sparks, and oblivion.

PHANTOMS

By ALICE I ’ANSON

   Icy finger-tips of rain
   Tap upon my window-pane;
   Lonely specters pace the gloom
   Of my ivy-mantled room
   When the last faint bars of light
   Usher in the boundless night!
   Foolish passions, brief and vain,
   Agonies of joy and pain,

   Not a single one was worth
   All the pangs that gave it birth!
   They are dead as drifted leaves
   Underneath the dripping eaves
   Or as blasted fruit that falls
   By an orchard’s crumbling walls!
   When the chill November flood
   Pours, and pours; until my blood
   Is cold as the half-frozen rain,
   Darkness brings the ghosdy train;
   And their pitiful unrest
   Stirs wild longings in my breast!
