226 COMPLETE STORIES and

PEARSON S YEAR

   Most Exceptional Offer, simply to get more
 people acquainted with our great National
 Magazine, which every month contains seven
 of the greatest stories money can buy, besides
 exhaustive articles on timely subjects

 FRENCH authors have written many lively tales
 which, because of false conventional modesty,
 have been, until recent translations, unknown to
 those who read only English Prudish modesty and
 unfair prejudice have deprived us of the merriest and
 liveliest tales ever written Maupassant was tlit- one
 man in France who could write trulv the realistic
 scenes of REAL PARISIAN LIFE so fascinatingly
 as lo rivet your attention to his merry tales, to the
 exclusion of everything else

 II Guy de Maupassant’s eventful career gave him
 ideas, situations and local color for his unsurpassed
 stories Strong in imagination, overflowing with nat-
 ural enthusiasm and passion in his study of human life
 and phases of human conduct, things really happen-
 ing—not as we imagine thev might or as we would—
 BUT THE REAL DOINGS OF LIFE-iswhat
 Maupassant always gives us f His dramatic in-
 stinct, his situations and his climaxes are over-
 whelming He always fixes upon the one thing
 of most huinan-soul interest and makes it as
 vivid as any stage scene These absorbing
 stories should lie in every library—tales of
 travel, mystery, adventure, com- j
 edy, pathos and tragedy, love
 realism

Rough-Riders of the Rail

BY GILSON WILLETS

THE extremes to which some men go—and women, too as Mr Willets
informs us in this article—to get a free ride on a train, surpass even
the deeds of daring of the early Indian fighters That they take their
lives in their hands, that they are driven to hunger, desperation, and even
insanity, in their desire to get from one place to another, seems to prove that
the bo—as he is commonly called—does not annex himself to a brake-beam
or hide in a box car just for the fun of the thing

      That Mr Willets gathered the following stories on one of his journeys
 around the country for The Railroad Man’s Magazine, attests their
 authenticity Whether or not the bo is frequently driven to his vagabond
 life by existing conditions is not for us to decide, but that he is a factor in
 human life to be reckoned with, we know He doesn’t care much to talk
 But when he does, he usually has something to say

  My corduroys, hunting-boots, poncho,
cartridge-belt—in fact, all the chief arti-
cles of my kit were missing—even my
tobacco “Til have to buy a new out-
fit,” I said, after I had signed a claim on
the Espee, “ for I’m obliged to start out
with Bill Greene to-morrow for a hunt in
Mexico”

   “ Don’t buy much,” replied the detec-
tive, “ because by the time you return I’ll
have the stolen stuff, as well as the stealer
It’s a hobo job, and the rangers (mean-
ing the famous Texas Rangers under
Captain McDonald) will get that tramp
within a few days”

Caught in the Sage-Brush

  I was gone three weeks 011 the hunt
Reaching El Paso once more, I was con-
fronted by that same railroad detective

  “ McDonald’s men got him,” he greet-
ed me “A free-rider Yes, but not a
professional tramp It was his first of-
fense—tells a plausible story—but now,
if you’ll step around to court, you’ll have
a chance to identify your property”

  The court was held in a small room
over a store All my togs were returned
to me, even the tobacco “Well, your
Texas Rangers certainly are the most ca-
pable police I’ve encountered,” I said

   “ It was simple,” replied the detective
“ The man was out in the sage - brush
without food or firearms Nothing easier
than to get a fugitive under such condi-
tions He’s around the corner—in jail”

   I asked if I might see the “ amateur ”
hobo and the detective accompanied me
to the calaboose and introduced me to the
warden, who brought out the prisoner

  He was a sorry-looking customer It
was not merely that his clothes were in
tatters it was his singularly emaciated
appearance, his livid paleness, his bright,
staring eyes His skin seemed drawn
tight over his bones, giving peculiar
prominence to his features, especially to
his nose

Starving to Death

   “ I know,” I said “ I’ve seen men in
your condition before — thousands of
them during the great famine in India
You have been near death from starva-
tion”

   “ Right! ” he answered, in a voice wo-
fully weak “ I’m a victim of circum-
stances I’m no stew-bum—110 vag May
I tell you my story from the very begin-
ning”

  “ Two months ago,” he began, “ I was
employed as an engine hostler by the Illi-
nois Central Railroad at New Orleans
I earned ninety dollars a month The
doctors said I showed signs of consump-
tion 1 determined to get up to New
Mexico

  “ I’m a saving man I had three
months’ wages in my pocket, yet I re-
solved to beat my way to New Mexico
like the tramps Ave often captured in the
yards at New Orleans That resolution
led to—this,” and he pointed to the iron-
barred cells

   “ I told no one of my plan and alone,
in the night, I crept through the yards to
a box car I had previously selected for
my purpose, on a train going west

Lured by a Trap-Door

   “ I chose this particular car because it
had a small trap-door, a sliding affair, in
the roof The trap was for the passing
back and forth of lamps I counted upon
that trap-door to help me to get out of
the car, in case some one should come
along and lock the side doors

   “ I slept well the first night The stop-
ping of the train in the morning awoke
me It was stifling hot and I wished to
let in some fresh air by sliding open one
of the side doors

  “ But, try as I would with all my
strength, neither of the side doors would
open Some one, evidently, had locked
them during the night But, no matter!

I had my trap in the roof I w’ould open
that, just enough to let in some air—for
I had closed that trap the moment I en-
tered the car in order to minimize the
chances of detection

   “ Imagine my predicament when I tried
to open the trap and found that it
wouldn’t budge Not till then did I re-
call that such trap-doors in some cars
could be opened only from the outside

   “ I was hungry and thirsty Did I cry
out and bang on the door Nix! Dis-
covery by the wrong person would mean,

I supposed, arrest I would wait a while
Probably at some station men of the right

sort, who would look the other way while
I walked off, might open the door

The Heat Unendurable

  “ Sleep was then the best way to pass
the time I slept all day, till the gnaw-
ing of a famished stomach
awoke me 1 had been
twenty-four hours without
food or water The train
jolted frightfully My
bones ached I was racked
with pain from head to
foot

  “ To cry out now would
be useless With the train
pounding along, no one
could hear me The heat
became almost unendura-
ble, and the sand of the
desert was drifting in, fill-
ing my eyes and mouth

“ In agony I cried out!

I realized how foolish I
was to try this box-car
riding It seemed to me
that my voice sounded ex-
ceedingly far away: but I
was not sure on account of
the noise of the train

  “ After that I must have
fainted Then I must have
slept a long time, for when
I awoke it was again day-
light, though whether
morning or afternoon I
knew not

  “ Still, the train thun-
dered and jolted on

Would it never stop so I
could summon assistance

The third night passed In
the morning I found my-
self too feeble to rise to my
feet I had been three
nighty and two days with-
out a bite to eat

  “ The train stopped Now 1 would be
rescued, would be able to buy food and
get water I was cold, though I knew I
must be in a hot country I had chills—
ague Now 1 suffocated My tongue
was swollen, my mouth seemed to be
filled with a hot potato

  “ But die train was standing still 1
tried to call for help, but could not utter

a sound The best I could do was to tap
on the floor with my knuckles No one
heard Hours passed 1 guess 1 became
delirious—then unconscious

in had lain unopened in the yards for two
days and nights That meant that I had
been without food or water for five nights
and four days!

  “ No wonder I was merely skin and
bones! No wonder that the sight of food
now nauseated me, while the sight of
water drove me mad

  “ But I recovered, of course They

THE RAILROAD MAN’S MAGAZINE

  “ Not till then did I realize the mad-
ness of my act in again attempting to
beat my way Was I again to starve
No! I was on a passenger-train In
twenty-four hours I would be in El Paso
I resolved to have patience, to go hungry
bravely for that time

“ By nightfall I found myself suffer-
ing acutely, both physically and mental-
ly Recollections of my previous expe-
rience rushed through my head I yelled
and raved in despair P'ood was my only
thought Food I must
have

    “ Presently a wild idea
  came to me Your trunk!
  Maybe it Contained food
  I seized one of the fish-
  plates, smashed the trunk
  open, but found no food

   “ A maniac indeed I
  then became With a crazy
  notion of ending my life,
  I butted my head against
  the side of the car

    “ I knew no more till the
  next morning There was
  the smashed trunk staring
  me in the face There
  were its contents scattered
  over the floor in my wild
  search for food Now I’d
  isurely be arrested, not only
  for a vagrant, but for a common thief

  “ In desperation I tried the door Im-
agine my astonishment when I tell you
that the door opened

  “ It had not been locked Here was
light, air, liberty!

  “ Quickly I made my plans We were
in the sage-brush At the first stop I
would leave the train, and take with me
some of the clothes from the trunk I
would array myself in those garments,
bury my own, and no one would then
recognize me

  “ That mad plan I carried out — all
except the donning your clothes and
burying mine I seemed to forget why
I carried those stolen clothes In the
pockets of your hunting - coat I fouild
tobacco and a pipe I smoked The
tobacco gave my stomach something to
work on—till the rangers found me

  “You know the rest I’m glad they
ran me down For I was slowly starv-
ing to death in the brush I hope, sir,

maybe IT CONTAINED FOOD”

  “ Certainly, I must have been still
weak in mind, though strong enough in
body to walk, for I went deliberately
back to the railroad yards with an insane
determination to hold on to my money
and ride to El Paso free

  “ The Sunset Express was’ ready to
pull out Next to the engine was the
baggage express - car, its doors slightly
open I looked in It was empty, save
for a few fish-plates I climbed in, un-
observed, and sat down in the corner far-
thest from the door

The Welcome Trunk

  “ Just before the train started some one
pushed the door open about two feet, and
shoved in a trunk The train started I
heaved a sigh of relief—for the door was
left open The trunk was yours

  “ On the outskirts of San Antonio the
train pulled up—and a man slammed the
door shut, and I heard him lock it

discharged me from the hospital Why
I was not arrested for riding in the box-
car I don’t know I wish they had ar-
rested me then—it would have been bet-
ter I wouldn’t be suffering here

that I have convinced you that I'm no
common hobo That is all”

   Before 1 left El Paso that “ free-
rider—the name he gave was Jim Some-
body-or-other — was sentenced to thirty-
days on the work gang

An Army of Hoboes

   I “ hit ” Tacoma Washington, in No-
vember There I learned that a veritable
army of hoboes was passing through the
city on the way to warmer California
-'The calaboose, so railroad yardmen told
me, was filled with a new set of Weary
Willies each night

   “ The only room we’ve got for ’em is
so full” said the keeper at the calaboose,
“ that 1 can’t even crowd in myself to
use the phone To-morrow morning we’ll
escort the tramps to the Northern Pacific
freight yards and order ’em to ‘ hit the
grit ’ and put Tacoma far behind Yet
to-morrow night the calaboose will be
full up with hoboes again

   “ There’s one man in there doesn’t be-
 long there, lie continued “It’s that tall
 chap with the red whiskers He’s a lum-
 ber-jack—not a real hobo, you know—yet
 he and his kind, when they’re ‘ jungling,’
 live a regular hobo life The railroad
 police happened to round up that chap
 along with the rest”	1

   I determined to be a part of that escort
 the next morning, and get acquainted with
 the tall, red-bearded lumber-jack Be-
 fore daylight the patrolmen and myself
 escorted some forty “ stew-bums,” “ vags,”
 and general wrecks to the Northern Pa-
 cific freight-trains: and while the un-
 feathered birds of passage scurried for
 means of flight 1 annexed the lumber-
 jack and led him off to hot coffee and
 ham and eggs

   “ The Simon-pure hoboes detest us” he
 said, as lie tucked a fried egg in its
 entirety into his mouth “ They won’t
 have nothing to do with us ’cause we
 work When we’re ‘ jungling,’ a lot of
 us get together, build a shack in the woods
 and live on the country-club plan

Lost in a Box Car

   “ I’ll tell you a story you can verify, if
 you want to, by writing to the Missouri
 Pacific vardmastcr, at Gurdon, Arkansas

 It’s a bill of particulars of how 1 got lost
 once in a mop box car—car and all

   “ Some of us lumbermen travel same
as those who never work You’ll find us
on freight-trains from the Atlantic to the
Pacific My home’s way back in Con-
necticut Some years ago, at the end
of my season in a northern California
camp as a swamper—which is trimming
branches from trees and clearing a road
through the brush—I wanted to go back
East and see New ITaven once more

   “ I got down to San Francisco, where
I heard that a fast freight of only five
«cars was to go through to New York in
six da vs That was the train for me It
happened to be a very important, an un-
usual train—a silk-train, worth half a
million dollars Each of the five cars
was filled with a hundred thousand dol-
lars’ worth of silk

   “ But I didn’t get out of California
before the enemy discovered me and gave
me the boot Then I worked eastward till
I got into Arkansas There I ‘ changed
cars’ I’d had enough of trucks I want-
ed a nice, comfortable place to stretch
inside of a car And I got it—a car on
a mop train, half filled with boxes of
canned salmon Say wasn't that salmon
great 

A Banquet on Salmon

   “ As soon as they locked me in all snug
 I knocked off the cover of one of the
 boxes, used a nail for a can-opener, and
 began feasting on Columbia River salmon

   “ (n the second day something the very
 queerest happened Locke' in, as I say,

I was not on to the game The car
seemed to rise up in the air and shoot off
sideways Then it plumped down and
stood still Then all was-silence I just
kept guessing the rest of the night and all
the next day, consuming canned Salmon
meanwhile till I was sick of it

   “ All that time, bear in mind, I heard
 trains passing my car, right beside me

 1 had not been side-tracked, for there’d
 been no backing, no pushing, no slam-
 ming Had the car been lifted bodily out
 of the train and placed on another track

 I gave it up, and ate more salmon

   “ The second night, though, I heard
men come up a swearing all round my
car—a gang of ’em Suddenly the car
got a move on bumpity-bump, as if they

were hauling her over the ties In a
minute, however, we rolled on smoothly,
as if on the rails again

The Yardmaster’s Smile

  “ In the morning the car was opened,
and a man began unloading it I hid
behind the boxes When he went away
for dinner I skidooed I found myself in
Gurdon, Arkansas More curious than
I’d ever been in my life to know what
kind of railroadin’ I’d been subjected to,

I walked up to the yardmaster’s office and
asked for a job, by way of getting safely
into a conversation

  “ The yardmaster seemed daffy about
something that had happened in the yard,'
laughed like he was dippy, and mumbled
something about a ‘ cock-sure conductor’
Tlien he turned to me and turned on the
gas And the long and short of his illu-
mination was this:

  “ As that night freight, of which my
car was a part, neared Gurdon, what’d
that salmon diner of mine do but jump
the rails and slide to the left into a ditch

  “ Now, here’s the freak part As soon
as my traveling restaurant cut herself
out, what’s the caboose right behind me
do but roll forward and couple herself

automatically to the train So much for
freak railroadin’

  “ Now for that part that made the
yardmaster smile out loud When that
freight-train pulled into the yard at Gur-
don the conductor reported all present
and accounted for and went home to bed
In the wee small hours a call-boy woke
the conductor and told him a car was
missing from his train

  “ ‘ Go chase yourself,’ said the conduc-
tor ‘ Didn’t I tab that car into the train
Of course she’s there’

  “ That’ll be about all, mister, except
that I expect that mop freight conductor
had to set up the soda-water good and
plenty for that yardmaster What’s that
Did the yardmaster give-me a job Well,
now, he certainly approached me along
that line but, you see, I had the New
Haven bee in my bonnet, so I just sidled
away from that kind yardmaster”

An Inhuman Mother

  Here’s another free-rider tale—the in-
human act of ft young mother, that led to
the rehabilitation of a human derelict

  At Los Angeles—in the same month of
my visit to Tacoma—I saw more tramps
in the railroad yards than probably could

be found in all
the other rail-
road yards of
California Los
Angeles in win-
ter is the hobo’s
paradise In the
Santa Fe Rail-
road yard I
talked to many
of the arriving
free-riders, and
the story of one
in particular has
an unusual
touch of pathos

  “ Y o u fond
of babies” he
said “I am Nearly lost my
life two nights ago—for a baby

“ I was at the fag end of my
journey from Kansas — nearing
Los Angeles Kicked off a freight-
train, I took a seat on the steps
of the rear car of the Santa
ROUGH-RIDERS OF THE RAIL

391

Fe's crack train, the California Limited,
hoping to ride into the City of the Angels
in grand style

   “Just aftpr we passed a place called
Cucamonga—as I’m a living man—I saw
a baby thrown from one of the forward
cars of the train I heard that baby’s
cries distinctly, for the train was not
going very fast

What Memory Did

  “ In a flash I thought of my own
baby, now lying in a Kansas graveyard
Thoughts of how happy I’d expected to
be with my baby now ran through my
mind My wife died, you see, and our
baby lived several months I took care
of him myself Then he, too, left me

   “ That discouraged me I gave up I
drank I lost all pawned all went down,
took to the road, and here I am—a human
derelict

   “ While all that I’ve told you flashed
through my brain, I jumped Now, when
you say a limited isn’t going some, you
mean faster than a freight, but not fast
for a limited When I jumped I learned
how fast a limited is going when it’s going
slow, for I can show you a body black and
blue and—just look at that swollen ankle

   “ I limped, dragged myself, up the
track to where the child lay in a mass
of soft mud It still lived, blubbering
weakly ‘ What fiend has done this awful
thing’ I asked myself

A Helping Hand

   “ Would the baby live 1 picked it up
and petted it And then I exclaimed,
just as if some one was listening, ‘ I’m
only a tramp! What if I take this baby
to the nearest house Maybe I’ll be
arrested for kidnaping No I must
leave the baby just as I found it, and go
for help’

   “ Just east of the track 1 saw a light in
a window I made my way, painfully,
toward the light—found it was in a ranch-
house where lived a Mr Matlock I told
Mr Mattock of the baby by the track,
and how it got there He wouldn’t be-
lieve at first that any one 'could be so
inhuman as to cast a baby out of a car
window from a moving train When we
reached the baby Mr Mattock said:

“ 1 I don't dare move that child without
authority I’ll telephone Constable Ruff’
“ While Mr Mattock was phoning I
took the baby once more in my arms I

i'm only a tramp!

billed and cooed over it Then, when I
heard Mattock returning with the con-
stable, 1 kissed that baby, laid it gently
in the mud and then slunk away into the
night, like the tramp I am

   “ Since reaching Los Angeles I learn
that they got the fiend who tossed that
six-weeks’ old baby from that car window
—a young woman of San Bernardino
She hoped in that way to get rid of her
child Think of it! She’s under arrest
The baby lived only a few hours after I
left it

Driving Them Out

   “ I believe that my experience with that
baby has had the effect of arousing in me
an ambition to face the music once more
and work for a living I’m glad of these
bruises They make me think of my own
baby boy, and of how, maybe, I ought to
work for him even though lie ain’t here”

Free-riders at this time were pouring
into Los Angeles in such hordes on every

THE RAILROAD MAN’S MAGAZINE

freight-train that certain yardmen were
put on extra duty, in the way of handing
the boes over to the police Rough-riders
of the rail arrived in such big bunches,
indeed, that Mayor Harper and Police
Commissioner Cole put their heads to-
gether and caused a sign to be placed in
the railroad yards reading like this:

     Hoboes, stick to your Pullfnans and
  keep moving

    Long sentences in the chain-gang
  given here

     Sixty to ninety days our specialty

-1-

  Notwithstanding these warnings, free-
riders arriving at Los Angeles forsook
their “ Pullmans ” in such numbers that
Sheriff Hammel was obliged to keep his
shower-baths in the county jail going
night and day in an effort to maintain
cleanliness within his gates

  Now, among the tramps who submitted
with more than usual reluctance to the
sheriff’s soap and water was one known as
Idaho Red—a free-rider whose arrival in
Los Angeles had been marked by a most
amusing experience

  Idaho Red was snoozing in an empty
box car, when the train pulled up at a
desert water-tank There two other free-
riders climbed into Idaho’s red car—
one a tall, lanky man, and the other fat
and very much sawed-off The garments
of the newcomers were torn and tattered
and covered with dirt and mud Their
shoes were typical Both were hatless

  “ Howdy ” said Idaho Red “ Youse
goin’ to Los That’s a awful town jist
now for us unhappies They pinch us
and parade us through the town in the
chain-gang Got a chew”

“ I’m the Governor”

  All this time the tall thin man and the
short fat man glared at Idaho Red with
expressions of indignation, as if to say:
“ How dare you be so familiar” Pres-
ently the tall man put his hand on the
bare and touseled head of the short man
and said:

  “ This is the mayor of Los Angeles
And I—I am one of the police commis-
sioners”

  “ Glad to know your honors,” prompt-
ly replied Idaho Red “ Permit me to
introjuce me own self I’m the Governor
of California”

  Just then a shack jumped into the car
and said: “ Dig up—every ging in here,
or out you all go”

  I do not mean to imply that brakemen
on California trains are in the habit of
making tramps dig up in return for let-
ting them travel in peace I merely quote
the remark of one particular brakeman
as I got it in relation to this specific
instance

  Idaho Red dug up without a word
And the “ mayor ” and the “ police com-
missioner ” followed the example of the
“ governor”

  The shack then left the three free-
riders, with the tacit understanding that
he would not report their presence to the
con, and the tramps began an animated
powwow that continued during the re-
mainder of the journey to Los Angeles,
the tall man and the short man plying
Idaho Red with dozens of questions con-
cerning the view-point of free-riders with
regard to their treatment by the authori-
ties in the City of the Angels

  Arriving in the Los Angeles yards
Idaho Red handed his new friends this
advice “ Now, beat it, for if youse linger,
youse will get pinched sure”

Make a Get-away

  The “mayor” and the “police commis-
sioner” made their get-away successfully
but sad to relate, the “ Governor of Cali-
fornia,” less spry than the others, got
pinched before he left the yards, and was
taken to Sheriff Hammel’s jail and sub-
jected to the indignities of suds and aqua

  Coming from the shower-bath with a
look of reproach suggestive of the cat
that has just emerged from a rain-barrel,
Idaho Red proceeded to relate the inci-
dent of his meeting with the short fat
man and the tall thin man in the box car

  When told that the short fat man was
really and truly the mayor of Los Angeles,
and that the tall lanky man was actually
the police commissioner of the city, Idaho
Red’s remark was:

“ Cert! Of course they were Just the
same as I was the Governor of California”
But Idaho Red’s friends were the offi-

“ The Lady Riders”

From railroad men and others, in my
rambles about this country, I have heard

“HOWDY SAID IDAHO RED YOUSE GOIN' TO LOS”

some strange tales of free-riders who
were “ rich,” and of free-riders who were
“ females”

  In San Francisco a Southern Pacific
man, having a run into Stockton, told me
of a free-rider who had been yanked out
of a box car in the Stockton yards and
tAken to the lock-up He gave the name
of Edwin Hess When searched twelve
hundred dollars in currency was found 011
his person

  “ Hut why with all this wealth,” he
was asked, “ do you travel in box cars
instead of Pullmans”

  Edwin Hess made this extraordinary
reply:

sneak out on the first freight that comes
along”

  A D and R G man at Denver told
me of a young hobo who was found in a
box car of a Santa Fe freight at Colo-
rado Springs, and taken into custody A
startling discovery was made That hobo
was a girl Her name was Bessie Boy-
ington Her hair was cut short she
wore boy’s clothes she was pretty She
said she had been traveling about the
country for a year—free-riding on the
railroads along with men tramps

  And she didn’t mind talking about it

  “ I feel jim-dandy,” she said “ I’m
in perfect health, and that’s more than

can be said of girls who have not the
courage to turn tramp”

The Romantic Part

  But, though I could not learn all the
details, the most romantic part of the
story of Bessie Boyington free-rider, was
that, when liberated from the jail at
Colorado Springs, she fell in with a New
Yorker of some wealth, and married him
In hoboland, on the Colorado railroads,
she was known as-1 Ried-White-and-Blue
Bessie”

  Another female free-rider I heard of in
California She was the wife of a team-
ster of San Francisco The teamster’s
name was Joaquin Ferrer, and he was a
member of the Brotherhood of Teamsters
After the fire he could get no work He
had saved not a penny, and he and his
wife deliberately turned tramps

  After free-riding to Los Angeles and
back he brought his wife some money
He pictured to his wife the allurements
of free-riding: and Mrs Joaquin Ferrer
declared that she herself would become a
free-rider

  They set out together in a box car,
having resolved to beat their way to Los
Angeles Arriving there, the husband
was arrested, but the wife induced the
yardmen to let her go

  A couple of months later a hobo, while
beating his way on a freight-train, near
Banning, California, fell asleep while
riding the rods He fell from the rods,
was run over, and both legs were severed
at the knee They took him to a hospital
at Riverside, and there found, in his
pocket, an old card of the Brotherhood of
Teamsters of San Francisco, bearing the
name “ Joaquin Ferrer”

The News Spreads

  Stranger than fiction, that same day a
woman hobo emerged from a box car of
the Salt Lake route, at Riverside, Cali-
fornia, and was informed by certain male
hoboes—among whom such news travels
fast—of the free-rider who had that day
been run over and lost both legs at Ban-
ning, and of how he had been brought
to the Riverside Hospital, and of how he
had been identified as a teamster of San
Francisco

  The woman hurried to the hospital,
only to be told there that Joaquin Ferrer
had died a few minutes before her arrival
“ My poor Joaquin! ” she cried “ I wish
this had come to me instead of to him”
And Mrs Ferrer showed that the love
that passeth understanding exists among
free-riders just the same as among people
who pay railroad fare

( A free-rider of the lowest class fetched
up in Tucson, Arizona, on the rods of a
car of a Southern Pacific freight In
broad daylight he jumped boldly from
the rods, directly in front of the Southern
Pacific headquarters building At that
moment a pretty girl happened to pass
The hobo looked at her once, twice, then
followed her up the stairs of the head-
quarters building to a room on the second
floor

  The girl was Miss Minnie Clauberg,
telegraph operator, on duty from seven to
five every day in the week Of a sudden,
she looked up from her key to find the
poorest semblance of a man staring and
leering hard at her The stranger asked
her a number of questions, none of which
Miss Clauberg answered Finally, the
greasy man slouched away

Willing to Marry

  Next day Miss Clauberg found a bit
of wood lying on the table in her office,
on which was scribbled these words: “ I
want a certain pretty girl for a wife”

  She showed the billet-doux—which she
has to this day—to Chief Lineman Jack
Shahan, who doubled his big hand into
what looked like a sledge-hammer and
said : “ You just wait, Miss Clauberg”
Next day the free-rider showed up in
the hallway of headquarters, on his way
evidently to Miss Clauberg’s room Jack
Shahan was right there, too

  Biff—bang—thud ! Down and out
went the tramp! When he reached the
bottom of the stairs he saw something
more than stars He beheld Tack Shahan
standing over him, saying :

  “ There’s a freight pulling out of here
pretty soon You better travel on it for
your health”

  He stood at the end of the depot plat-
form until it came along, and then he
deftly slid into an empty But, thank
Heaven ! his kind is pretty scarce

OU are accused of being
a mechanic What have
you to say about it”
There was not a shade
-AL	of relaxation or humor

  visible in the face of
Philip Amend, senior member of Philip
Amend & Sons, contracting engineers

  He had turned abruptly in his chair
and launched this challenge into Ronan’s
lax senses as though he
were casting a spear

  “ I will plead guilty to
that,” replied Ronan qui-
etly and without a mo-
ment’s hesitation

  “ Well, it’s worse than
that,” continued the cool
and even voice of the se
nior Amend “ You are
accused of being a first-
class mechanic, and it is
said that you can handle
men What do you say to
that”

  Ronan, standing, hat in
hand, in the quiet seclu-
sion and rich plainness of
Amend’s Broad Street
office, was not the figure
of a man that a discrimi-
nating person would se-
lect to play with, even at
long acquaintance

  There was a poise of-
the head and shoulders,
an upstanding alertness
in his big, clean - cut
body, and, most of all,
a level steadiness of the
eyes that forbade famil-
iarity

  And yet Mr Amend was, of necessity,
a man of fine discrimination

  While he had never until then seen the
head of the house of Amend, Ronan knew
New York—which is another way of say=
ing that he knew both men and manikins
pretty well

  His calm eyes, therefore, made a swift
and comprehensive inventory of the severe
but good appointments of the big room in

the center >'1 which he stood, fell in cool
scrutiny that seemed to crumple as by
frost the look of calm superiority on the
face of Am end's secretary, and settled
back with definite purpose on the face of
Amend, before Ronan answered:

  “ To advance the case as a whole, what-
ever it may be, I plead guilty to both
counts”

  “Sitdown Take this chair, won’t
you” said Amend, after a moment’s si-
lence, indicating a position where the
light of late morning must fall full upon
the face of Ronan “ You don’t seem to
get rattled easily,” he volunteered when
Ronan had settled into the chair close at
hand “ Perhaps we shall do well to get
better acquainted

  “ My son requested you to send in a
card, when you could find the time Yes
He did not say why or whither, I pre-
sume No That was right, so far, and
now, no doubt, you would like to know
why we have ventured to make that re-
quest

  “ I should like to have you undertake a
small matter for us in a big way, and
leave here as soon after to-day as you can
get your necessary belongings together”

  “ Where ” asked Ronan, concealing
his surprise at the depth and intentness
of meaning that the conversation had sud-
denly assumed

  “ There,” replied Amend, whirling the
globe at his elbow with the swift touch of
long and constant use until his finger-tip
rested lightly upon a spot below the equa-
tor

  “As what” questioned Ronan very
quietly, while his eyes fastened upon the
place indicated, and a dull flush of color
surged strongly into his face

  “ As master mechanic of three hundred
and odd miles of Andean railroad, and
first man in line for promotion,” was, the
unhesitating reply

  Ronan searched the face of Amend for
a moment before he asked :

  “ The salary ”

  “ Eight hundred a month, gold” re-
plied Amend : “ and you need not take the
trouble to go into your personal expe-
rience or attainments I know all I wish
to know about your previous history just
at this time When would you like to give
us your answer ”

  Ronan could not repress a smile as he

arose : but it was because of the unerring
certainty with which the conversation had
been launched and hurried to its evident
end, and not because of any elation at the
suddenly opened prospect

  He had done things with locomotives
in the busy hives along the Juniata He
had been captain of herders, as it were,
at the great, open - air engine corral in
West Philadelphia He knew, also, things
that can be learned only at first - hand
where Chicago—the railroad sun of this
railroad firmament—radiates fleeing, hur=
rying locomotives to every point of the
compass as prodigally in proportion as
the veritable sun projects its shafts of
light

  He knew the mountains and the plains
and something of the peaceful valley work
of this land of endless railroads but in
that other land—that land of manana, of
to-morrow, below the equator— What

  He knew, by report, that ill winds have
a way of striking as from above that un-
toward things have a way of happening
there—where all except the white man do
all things to-morrow, and where he, too,
unless he be made of tlie sternest stuff,
soon lapses into that fatal lethargy of
manana

  “ In an hour 1 will return and answer,”
he said, and, with brief adieu, passed out
to the elevators and to the din of the
street

  “I thought so!” muttered Amend,
grimly smiling at the little Peruvian sil-
ver grotesque upon his desk, while the ex-
press elevator swiftly dropped Ronan to
the street level “ He will decide it to-
day—not to-morrow He is our man”

  It was something of a decision for a
man no older than Ronan to make Lie
was not yet thirty he was well-estab-
lished in the railroad offices in a near-by
cross-street lie had the usual substantial
chances of slow promotion and meager
salary of the older Eastern railroads

  There was, of course, permanent or
temporary relief by death or pension at
the end of the long run, according as the
die might fall for him

  In sharp contrast to that, an ever-pres-
ent allurement looming large was the
Western railroad field—that mightiest of
industrial battle-fields, holding forth its
tempting rewards of quick recognition,
place, money, -and power to the young,

RONAN’S FIVE MINUTES

clear-headed, and capable The wander-
lust was strong in Ronan’s blood He
had fought it at times as a man fights a
malady The spirit of adventure and the
indomitable pluck that had sent his Scan-
dinavian grandfather pioneering into the
great Northwest two generations ago had,
in turn, sent young Ronan adventuring
eastward

  From Altoona, as an Eastern begin-_
ning, he had grown by slow and painful
processes to a modest place in the official
line He had come to know New York
when the flush of his strength was at its
highest — when the sullen roar of the
city’s life by day and the pregnant silences
of its nights thrilled him with a sort of
exaltation at the mere fact of survival in
that maelstrom of human life A score
of years, per-haps, would pass before he
could properly detest it and turn again to
the open

  The sense of nearness to the pulse of
the world, the far reaches down t he bay
to the open sea, the virile tang of brine-
soaked shipping at the piers, and the rich

mixed odors of sea and cargo along the
water - fronts, had, from his first expe-
rience of them, stung Ronan’s senses

  But, like a stoic, he had held them all
in check with a master hand The gay
enticement of the city’s life, the call of
the West, and, most insistent of all the
call of the sea and of that mysterious land
of manana, lie had put resolutely aside,
until now he had come unexpectedly to
look upon a daring parting of the ways
when he had meant only to pursue the
staid and conventional path to a common-
place success

  Reaching the street, he thrust his way
unceremoniously through the fringe of
yelling curb brokers that overlapped from
the turbulent crowd in the middle of the
street and obstructed the sidewalk He
threaded his way more carefully through
the gloomy and cluttered narrowness of
Wall Street, and, crossing Broadway, en-
tered the gate of old Trinity churchyard,
and sat down in a favorite nook to wrestle
with his urgent problem

  There was nothing in the expression-

less marble slabs of the churchyard to
contribute to the answer, save that, fare
forth however bravely and where they
might, all men came there, or to a similar
pass at last But the chimes in the tower,
ringing out the noon-hour, sent a theme of
triumph and rejoicing down into the se-
cluded churchyard and out into the roar
of the street

  Ronan arose from his seat and plunged
into the northward current of Broadway
He suddenly felt that he must get closer
to the heart of the giant, complex life of
the crowd once more before he could de-
cide

  Shortly he was dropping from a car
at Twenty=Third Street, and a few mo-
ments later he was seated in the glazed
bay of a near-by cafe corner, where, him-
self unobserved, he looked out upon the
midday flood of humanity that hurls itself
impersonally upon the massivfe prow of
the Flatiron Building and falls away
again into the divided currents of Broad-
way and Fifth Avenue

  Ronan ate with the unabated hunger
of youth and perfect health, and while
he was thus engaged the matter somehow
shaped itself in longer and more compre-
hensive perspective Who would miss him
a year hence if he dropped out now from
that scurrying throng beyond the window-
ledge 

  He laughed quietly over his solitary
meal for answer

  Well, for the matter of that, who would
miss him if he dropped into a crevasse in
the Andes for a time, and eventually
dropped out again

  The answer was not so ready

  A week later Ronan was looking into
the open hold of a vessel tied up at the
Spanish-American docks, just north of
the Battery He was carefully observing
the handling of numerous huge packing-
cases, containing the detachable parts of
some locomotives, big for their day and
generation, but big beyond belief in South
America, whither they were billed The
locomotives, stripped as closely as need
be, were already safely stowed in the ca-
pacious hold : and Ronan was booked to
go out on the same boat, to have one of
them later give him the worst five minutes
of his life

  No hint of that, however, appeared in
the repose of the big silent hulks of the

engines in the shadowy hold, and, of
course, there was no hint of it in Mr
Amend’s parting instructions

  “ Yes, said he, “ I should like it if
you would go with the cargo You may
be useful before you get them ashore, and,
in any event, I have a theory that a man
who works for us down there is the better
for going around the Horn or through
Magellan and looking at his job at long
range going up the west coast It gives
him a wider perspective

  “ Then, too, if he is going to curl up
and wilt, he generally does it when he
gets his first sight of the Andes from the
Pacific, and goes right on up the coast
and reneges by way of Panama

  “Not making any forecasts in the pres-
ent instance, you understand, but—well,
it offers you a broader perspective, as I
have said”

  “ Certainly I shall be glad to do
that,” replied Ronan “ That is,” he ha-
stily added in the tone of a man who has
no intention of reneging, “ I shall be glad
to go through with the locomotives”

  Some days later the ship was threading
the crooked ways of Magellan, and Ro-
nan, looking from the ice-hung crests and
rocky sides of its desolate mountains to
the forsaken, inane faces of the Terra del
Fuegans crouching, starved, and half
naked on their littered shores in the sod-
den July midwinter, silently thanked
Providence and Philip Amend & Sons
that his task lay elsewhere

  In due time the ship, with its epoch-
making cargo, covered the northward
coastwise journey to the open roadstead in
front of that little city well below the
equator, where Ronan’s real responsibil-
ity began

  He wakened one morning to find the
ship anchored and rolling in the sicken-
ing swell of waters that are ceaselessly
whipped and mauled by the chill ant-
arctic winds and that widening of his
perspective which the senior Amend had
Toretold, and which had been progressing
apace since threading the straits, was
greatly furthered when he turned his
eyes shoreward in the early morning
light

  From among all the days, weeks, and
months of lowering leaden sky that fol-
lowed while the Pacific arched its saving
waters high upon the winds over the cor-

dillera to the fertile eastern slopes and
left the sterile coast untouched of rain,
that first morning was reserved and set
aside for Ronan’s welcome

  While he stood gazing, spellbound, over
the dry benches of sand and rock which
rise magnificently, terrace after terrace,
from the wind-swept shore—over the first
grand uplift of the giant mountains to the
vast table-lands beyond—the dim gray
background of the nearer heights was torn
asunder by a vagrant cross-current of the
upper air, and the distant, ultimate, upper
heads of the second cordillera stood forth
for a moment, pink, white, and tipped
with ice, fire, and gold against the im-
maculate blue of the sky

  That one glimpse of the mysterious
upper world of the mountains was brief
as it was beautiful The gray cloud-pall
closed its brilliant rift, and Ronan’s prac-
tical mind came back, with an unconscious
sigh of regret, to the rolling and wallow-
ing ship and the chortling and swaying
lighter-cranes, which were already drop-
ping their tackle-blocks into jhe hold in
search of cargo to be lifted

  “ Well” said Ronan to the first man
who came abreast of him on deck, “ a
man might fail here, or up yonder ”—
with a sweep of his arm toward the van-
ished upper world—“ but he ought to
win And if he failed and died, he ought
to be able to die well in a place like
that!”

  “ Oh, a man can win here,” said the
experienced one to whom he had spoken
“ He can win  but it costs a price It
always exacts something which he lias not
offered, and — yes, men have died up
there”

  A month saw Ronan thriving in full
charge of motive-power affairs His three
big locomotives, like himself, were safely
located in the railroad headquarters town,
one hundred miles back from the coast and
seven thousand feet higher in the moun-
tains 'The engines had worked their way
up satisfactorily thus far and now Ro-
nan and the general superintendent, Ver
rill, faced the task of taking them safely
up to their final assignment in the fast-
nesses of the higher cordillera

  Thus, an evening in August found them
sitting amid the wordy babble of the Ala-
meda, near the extravagant little fountain
of onyx that dripped and gurgled in the

mountain city’s brave array of gay flow-
ers, willows, and eucalyptus All things
centered in the Alameda, and between its
rows of sparse trees and brilliant blooms
many things, at one time and another,
had their vivid inception, from the first
lambent glow of a pair of liquid, dark
eyes to the hasty making and the early de-
struction of dictators and dynasties They
were planning the dangerous ascent of the
higher mountains with the new engines,
while distant Illimani caught the last
golden glow of the sun upon its lofty
crest of snow and held its evening glory
high above the circle of the surrounding
heights

  “ Two tunnels—” Ronan was saying,
when Verrill interrupted with an apolo-
getic wave of the hand

  “ Three, Ronan  three in less than the
length of a decent rifle-shot—and twenty
more tunnels, for the matter of that But
three where we bridge Rio de los Animas
de Perditas at the highest, and three times
we cross the river within a mile’s length
of track!

  “ The channel there is in the form of a
big letter ‘ S,’ sunk flat six hundred and
fifty feet deep in the solid rock”

  “ Yes,” Ronan quietly agreed “ There
are three tunnels there, but two of them
are tangent and west of the curved
bridges They need give us no special
concern It is the tunnel of nineteen de-
grees curvature, opening directly off of
the first of those bridges—the bridge that
spans the canon from sheer wall to sheer
wall-—that is troublesome

  “ The chief engineer declares that he
will not consent, now, to working the new
engines under their own steam across
those two bridges Nor will he consent
to have them taken over coupled close to
a lighter engine I put in this whole
afternoon with him up there, and there is
only one other way to take them across

  “There he is now, Verrill! Call him
over, and let us have it out with our-
selves You say you must have the en-
gines working higher up until these lower
bridges are strengthened”

  “ Ho, Merrill!” called Verrill, as the
engineer approached in the moving throng
beyond the first line of eucalyptus “ Will
you join us for a smoke”

  A minute later the three men were deep
in the problem that confronted them
400

TPIE RAILROAD MAN’S MAGAZINE

  “ No, I cannot consent, Merritt was
saying with fixed determination “ It
would be criminal The weight of the
water in the boiler and the thrust of the
driving-wheels upon the rails are the two
things that I cannot guarantee the result
of, in addition to the dead weight of the
engine

  “ And to put two engines upon the
bridge at once is, of course, quite out of
the question The factor of strength re-
maining would be entirely too small, and

I	will not consent

  “ Mr Ronan, you spoke to-day of a
plan Can we not consider it to-mor-
row ”

  Merritt had been long in the land of
■manana and almost unconsciously he
spoke at times in the language of to-mor-
row

  “ To-night,” replied Ronan “ Now,
if you will

  “ The longest bridge there is one hun-
dred and sixty feet We have among our
stores a one-hundred-and-seventy-five-
foot hawser that will tow the empty en-
gine, and a little more, without its tender

  “ If Mr Verrill will agree, we will
couple three empty Hat cars behind to
supply hand-brakes, hitch the rope to the
new engine’s draw-bar, and send one of
the older, lighter engines ahead to pull
her over the bridges and through the
short, curved tunnel

  “ We have also some strong oaken
rollers, which can be fastened by their
brackets vertically upon the short wall of
the tunnel’s curve at points that will fend
the rope from chafing upon the sharp
rocks after the live engine enters the tun-
nel Once the strain of the rope is set-
tled upon the rollers, they will be held all
the tighter and safer against the rock, in
addition to the firm fastenings we can ar-
range for holding them in the beginning”

  Point by point, they went over the plan
until it was complete in each particular, -
and the following day witnessed the
operation in the late afternoon

  Eleven thousand feet above the level
of the distant Pacific the powerful little
locomotive was noisily dragging its giant
substitute through the half-twilight of
deep Perditas Canon Between the en-
gines the big hempen rope stretched taut
over the straight bridge Behind the dead
and empty new engine trailed three light

fiat cars, each with its pair of mestizo
trainmen manning the brake-wheels for
emergency—dubiously, but chattering in
excitement at the novelty of the thing

  1'wo hundred feet below, the Rio Per-
ditas writhed and roared and tumbled in
its narrow bed and, above, the sheer
walls rose straight, four hundred and fifty
feet to the ragged lips of the narrow
canon

  Just ahead lay the last of the two
straight tunnels, with its grade of one
hundred and ninety-five feet to the mile,
and at its farther end the track again
crossed the Perditas upon one hundred
and sixty feet of open, curving- bridge,
springing directly from one face of the
perpendicular wall of the gorge to the
opposite straight wall, and disappearing
in the curving tunnel of nineteen degrees
curvature and heavy grade

  There, at the nearer mouth of the
curving tunnel, Ronan with his hand
resting upon the first oaken roller-fender,
well bolted to the face of the rock, stood
upon the lofty steel webwork of bridge
and listened to the steady roar and echo
of the laboring engine’s exhaust

  He looked far down upon the writhing
waters, and realized to the fullest that he
had hung his reputation, and much more,
upon that single straining rope that was
creeping toward him in the opposite tun-
nel Shortly the working engine pushed
its front out of the wall of the canon at
the farther end of the bridge, and crept
over to where he waited

  The plodding engine passed him slow-
ly, and the slant of the great rope, strung
taut from its draw-bar, sheared its way
beautifully to place upon the oaken guard-
roller on the lip of the tunnel The
working engine disappeared when the
front of the new engine was just showing
in the opposite tunnel’s mouth and all go-
ing well

  Then the dead engiiie loomed big in the
dull, gray light upon the frail bridge,
responding to the steady, careful draw of
the rope The great hulk of her was
moving slowly across the middle of the
lofty steel srpan, with Ronan tensely
watching the smooth play of the rope
upon its fender, when the one thing that
he dreaded occurred

  The steady exhaust of the working en-
gine, now well on its slow way through
RONAN’S FIVE MINUTES

401

tlie short, curved tunnel, suddenly broke
to a muffled roar, and Ronan straightened
and stood clutching the rock like a man
struck deep and hard His eyes were
fixed upon the big straining rope, which
suddenly seemed but a mere thread among
the massive cliffs

  While he stared, helpless to avert it
there came the fatal sag that he dreaded
The great rope sank almost to the bottom
end of the fender-roll snapped upward
perilously, and sank again

  The forward engine was slipping in
the drip of the tunnel! The sanding <>f
the rail had-been allowed to fail!

  Aii instant more, and it was done

  Another sag, and the rope caught-und r

ripped loose with a crash

• Twice the rope sawed upward upon the
jagged rock of the tunnel’s curve, and
then it broke with a great whip-like snap
and snarl that whirred and echoed
through the narrow gorge

  The backward half of it came writhing
and hurtling out of the tunnel, and whip-
ping around the dead engine, struck a
slashing blow above the heads of the
frightened trainmen

  “ Set them! ” shouted Ronan, before
the first backward movement was fairly
begun “ Set the brakes! ”

  But they fell upon their faces and lay
there cowering, while the engine and cars
rapidly accelerated
their slow back-
w a r d movement
and quickly disap-
peared in the
straight tunnel

  Only for an in-
stant Ronan had
stood paralyzed at
the sight of the
m e 11 ’ s inactivity,
and then he leaped
out recklessly upon
the cross - ties of
the bridge and
raced madly after
the runaway

  So quick was his
start, and so cum-
bersome the train’s
first movement,
that, in the begin-
ning, he gained up-
on it He strained
forward in a heart-
breaking, final ef-
fort in the tunnel,
and succeeded in
touching the rapid-
ly receding pilot-
beam of the engine

But it drew' stead-
ily out from under
his clutching hands
and thre w him
prone upon his face
in the darkness

 He gathered
himself quickly,
and ran on again
to the lower end
of the tunnel Just
outside he found
the f ri g h t e ned
traiii - crew, nurs-
ing their bruises,
huddled in a bay

DASHING BATTERED HULK AND FLYING FRAG-
MENTS BACK AND FORTH, FROM
WALL TO WALL

of the rock where they had tumbled off,
pell - mell The runaway was hurtling
down the crooked canon, scattering its
engine trappings at every curve and too
close shelf of rock

  With one bitter execration wrung from
him upon all the sullen, ceaseless menace
of Perditas Canon Ronan stood watch-
ing the destroying flight of the train
down the steep and crooked grade, with
_	Verrill’s words of

  the morning ring-
  ing in his ears:

    “ I have a trip
  up the canon to-
  day I’U make it a
  point to be up there
  with my car and
  another engine
  when you make the
  pull over the last
  bridge! ”

     Poor Verrill! If
  he met that awful
  bolt of destruction
  hurling itself down
  upon him in the
  canon — and he
  must, if it stayed
  on the rails but lit-
  tle longer!

     At the first sharp
  turn of the track,
  a few hundred feet
  away, Ronan saw
  the wild careening
  of the engine sweep
  off the stack, bell,
  and running-board
  against the over-
  hanging point of
  rock As the first
  flying fragments
  lifted into the air
  he thought the end
  had come, and held
  his breath while he
  waited to see the
  entire fleeing mass
  topple into the
  gorge

But she righted
herself, and shot
out of sight, with
the Hats, still dan-
cing on ahead
Again he saw her

flash into view, lower down, and toss shiv-
ered fragments high in the air and into
the gorge, while from far, deep down,
almost directly beneath him as it seemed,
the feeble whistle treble of VerriH's spe-
cial engine floated up chokingly, strug-
gling for notice above the roar of the
river and the destroying runaway

  So it must be! None but the Maker
of the mountains could avert it now Ver-
rill and his crew were doomed!

  Ronan’s mind flashed back in that in-
stant to the morning in Amend’s New
York office, and his own words, then so
lightly spoken, rang in his ears like the
knell of doom:

   “ I will plead guilty io that! '’

  And what of this7 It had been of his
planning, his execution—all his, but the
stupefying slip in the tunnel, against
which he had cautioned, first and last
He saw his own life going out in dis-
honored memory as the price of the lives
of the men who would, in a few moments,
die down there below him, almost within
his sight

   1-Ie saw in his mind’s eye, all that and
more, in those few crowded minutes, and
then, for the last time, he saw the big
engine flash into sight again, stripped
of its cars, somewhere in the three and
a half miles through which it had mi-
raculously staggered

  Even then, it was only a -scant mile
straight away from him, but far below,
and speeding along  the mountainside in
af shaft of daylight that penetrated the
narrow barrel of the canon

  He saw her rush at the point of the
last distortion of the canon wall that
lay in the line of his sight She struck
it with a furious lunge that sent rails
and ties twisting and whirling in the
air, and, suddenly, her head end went
down close upon the dizzy brink of the
gorge

  She threw her shattered cab crashing
in a mass of splintered rubbish ahead
of her into the depths, and leaped after

it dashing battered hulk and flying
fragments back and forth, from wall
to wall, until the boiling waters far be-
low swallowed them

  And then, while Ronan stood fixed
and staring from his lofty lookout, the
treble of Verrill’s engine whistle came up
again, more clearly, and the little engine,
drawing the superintendent’s car, shoved
its bright brass-trimmed front end round
the lower point of the shattered curve
It crept to a stop in a shaft of gray
light, just short of the six hundred and
fifty feet of spread track which the lost
engine had left, in its final riot, as the
only trace of the disaster

  ' That ended what Ronan unhesitat-
ingly calls the worst five minutes of his
life And, to those who are so fortunate
as to find him very comfortably, even
luxuriously, at home in one of the many
little earthly paradises of the Andean
•cities, he will sometimes tell, especially
if it be a newcomer who is inclined to
despair of South America, how he once
sent in his resignation within sixty days
after life arrival there, and how Philip
Amend & Sons would neither accept,
nor seriously consider it

  A very good while ago that was, and
Ronan is of the higher executive staff
noy but he can repeat, without refer-
ence to his musty letter files, just what
the senior Amend wrote him upon that
trying occasion of his first time out
This is it:

  That scheme of yours evidently had its
weak spot But we can better afford a man
who, once in a lifetime, drops $20,000 do>vn
the canon, trying to do something to-day,
than to pay an everlasting tribute to niauana

  Don’t be too liberal with your plea of
 guilty” Your first one was all right, but
1 conSStler it my turn to render a verdict in
your case, and it is this:

  “ Not guilty—but, don’t do it again” Stay
with them, young man

  “ And,” says Ronan, “ I stayed”

 DID you ever take time to consider

  The lives we are living each day—

  Are we helping ourselves, and our neighbors
         Along the unballasted way 

  Is our road-bed Jhe best we can make it

   Are the ties and the rails all set true

  Are the fish-plates secure and well leveled 

   Are we always marked up, overdue”

  Are our road-crossings all well protected

   Do our signal-lamps ever burn bright

  Are our head-lights trimmed neatly, and burning,
   To show us our way through the night

  Is our hand always gripping the throttle

   Does our fireman keep-up enough steam

  Is our engine the mogul to pull us
   Up the hill where our hopes'brightly gleam

  Are there many up-grades we must double,

   And down-grades that call for the air,

  And stretches—quite long and uneven,

  That fill us with wo and despair

  Are the agents at all of our stations
  Reliable, careful, and true

  When our train blows the whistle for signals,

   Are we sate when they let us go through

Express Thieves, and How to
Catch Them

BY CHARLTON ANDREWS,

HONESTY is not only the best policy it is the only one that will keep
you outside the penitentiary, it you happen to be in the employ of an
express company These companies have so surrounded themselves
with safeguards that dishonesty has absolutely no terrors for them, whether
it be within the ranks of the company's employees or without

     The thief, be he large or small, employee or working highwayman, may
flatter himself that his trail is covered beyond possibility of discovery that
he may settle down tp enjoy his ill-gotten gains in peace and security At the
very moment when lie dismisses fear from his mind fate, in the guise of a
special officer of the express company, or perhaps the surety company that-
guaranteed his honesty, may step in and tap him 011 the shoulder

     The long arm of the law reaches across plains and over mountains and
rivers Distance is no obstacle, and time no consideration Sooner or later
justice overtakes the trembling fugitive, and he passes into the domain of the
zebra stripes -	‘		'

The Express Companies Have Made Secure the Enforcement of
Eighth Commandment Against Dishonest Employees and the
Road-Agents Who Once Infested the Mountains

the

,VER since express companies
were organized, their treas-
kue-boxes have had a pe-
culiar fascination for the
dishonest

   Opportunities ftir steal-
inj money in transit, not onlv by bandits
on the lonely roads, but also by em-
ployees, of necessity left unwatched for
many hours at a time with large sums in
their custody, have been so exceptionally
favorable that the express companies’ rec-
ord of losses by theft is not approached in
tle history of any other business

  Rut the eternal struggle for the sur-
vival of the fittest evolved, as it always
does, unusual remedies to meet unusual
conditions The express companies have
fought for self-preservation with an en-
ergy and skill that have at last rendered

them practically immune from depreda-
tions by thieves within or without

  So thoroughly is it understo'od by all
men that robbery of an express company
carries in its wake a retribution as inevita-
ble as death itself that in these days only
those below the average of criminal intel-
ligence will attempt it Trains and stages
are held up nowadays only by boys whose
brains have been addled by trashy novels
and cigarettes

  The last stage robbery in Idaho was
committed two years ago by two boys aged
eighteen and nineteen, who had been
brought up 011 a lonely farm, and who had
never seen a train until they were taken
aboard one by a Wells, Fargo & Co se-
cret-service agent four days after their
foolish exploit, oh their way to trial and
certain conviction
406

THE RAILROAD MAN’S MAGAZINE

  Stealing by employees now occurs only
in extremely rare cases The last instance
of the kind occurred last August An
agent of the Southern Express Company
had read newspaper accounts of the long
light against extradition from Canada
conducted by Greene and Gaynor, until
he became filled with the idea that he per-
ceived a legal device by which he could
avoid extradition for robbery Accord-
ingly he began to lay plans to test his
theory

  He applied for leave of absence, an-
nounced that he was going to Canada on
a fishing-trip, obtained passes for the
journey, and finally started ostentatiously
for Montreal, helping himself to twenty-
one thousand dollars from an express
shipment just before he left He had
no difficulty in getting to Canada—and
even less in getting back home again in
custody of a detective It only required
seven days to demonstrate that his theory
about the weakness of the extradition
treaty was all wrong

Coping with the Highwayman

  The story of the struggle of the ex-
press companies to protect their treasure-
boxes is fascinating There were two
widely different classes of enemies to meet
—those on the outside and those on the
inside The outside enemy, the highway-
man, offered the earliest and the most dif-
ficult problem because the express compa-
nies were young, aiid therefore poor in re-
sources and experience, and also because
the country ivas new and the machinery
of the law was not yet in good running
order

  In the days following the discovery of
gold in California, Montana, and Colo-
rado, highway robbery was an easy, prof-
itable, and comparatively safe vocation,
rather extensively followed by persons
with conscientious scruples against work

  When the vengeance of the vigilantes
made promiscuous murder and robbery
somewhat dangerous, the holding up of
stages by masked men became more and
more common until Wells, Fargo & Co,
who practically monopolized the express
business in the Far West, were forced to
take the lead in a war of extermination
upon highwaymen as the alternative to
bankruptcy

   The vicissitudes of this war, which last-
ed from the earliest days up to 1895,
make up one of the most picturesque chap-
ters in the history of the United States
It is also a notable example of how “ in-
dividual enterprise ” may be crushed by_
corporate aggression

  Some idea of the magnitude of this war
upon the highwayman may be gathered
from the fact that in the fourteen years
from 1870 to 1885 Wells, Fargo & Co
were robbed by highwaymen of four hun-
dred and fifteen thousand three hundred
and twelve dollars Two guards, four
drivers, and four passengers were killed
in these robberies, and six guards, four
drivers, and two passengers were severely
wounded

  There were three hundred and thirteen
stage robberies, thirty-four attempted
stage robberies, four train robberies, four
attempted train robberies, and three hun-
dred’ and forty burglaries of express of-
fices Also seven horses were killed and
thirteen were stolen

  On the other side of the ledger, five
highwaymen were killed in the act of rob-
bing tlie express, eleven were killed while
resisting arrest, and seven were lynched
for the crime of robbing the stages The
survivors, two hundred and forty in num-
ber, were sent to prison for long terms
at hard labor Not one of the highway-
men escaped punishment Much of their
booty was recovered

Costly Rewards

  To even die score in such conclusive
style cost Wells, Fargo & Co, in rewards,
percentages on treasure recovered, salaries
of guards and detectives, and expenses of
arrests and convictions, the tidy sum of
$512,414

  The plan of campaign was neither com-
plicated nor mysterious When a stage
was held up, headquarters in San Fran-
cisco would be notified as promptly as
possible, and an operator from the secret-
service department would be sent to the
scene of the robbery Often he had mere-
ly to lead a posse into the mountains on
a man - hunt which quickly resulted in
the killing or capture of the highwaymen
The celerity with which these hunts were
conducted is manifest in the court records
of California, Nevada, and Arizona For
EXPRESS THIEVES, AND HOW TO CATCH THEM 407

example, George Adams robbed the stage
from San Luis Obispo to Soledad, Cali-
fornia, 011 the 3d of December, 1879
Twelve days later he was delivered at the
California state prison to begin a long
sentence for the crime

  Still quicker time was made-in the case
of James Casey, who found himself in
state prison six days after lie held up the
stage from Grayson to Bantas on the 23d
of October, 1884 The usual time, how-
ever that elapsed between the hold-up and
the joufney to the penitentiary ranged
from three weeks to three months, depend-
ing on the time the courts required to
reach the case

TKe Life of a Stage Robber

  In a number of instances the high-
waymen eluded pursuit long enough to
hold up a second stage before their cap-
ture, Twelve men were active enough
to commit three highway robberies before
their inevitable fate overtook them, four
held up four stages each another was
killed in the act of holding up his fifth
stage, and still another looted six express
treasure-boxes before the secret service
gathered him in

  Richard Perkins held up a stage from
Los Angeles to Bakersfield on the 4th of
December, I S 5, was promptly captured,
and received an eight-year sentence thirty-
fivt days after the crime Not' being sat-
isfied with this experience, he held up an-
other stage within sixty days after com-
pleting his sentence He succeeded in re-
peating the performance six times more
within the ensuing six months Then
Wellfs Fargo & Co’s secret service got
him and had him,sent up for life’

“Black Bart,” the Champion Road-Agent

  The record in highway robbery was set
by “ Black Bart,” whose right name was
Charles E Bolton Choosing the vicinity
of Yreka, California, as his favorite field
of operations, he held up Wells, l argo &
Co’s stages no fewer than twenty-seven
times in the eight years, three months, and
seven days that elapsed between his first
exploit and his capture ()ne stage he held
up four times at the same spot

  Californians declared that the drivers
got so accustomed to being held up at

this point that they stopped the stage of
their own accord and held up their hands
whenever they approached the place
After waiting a few moments, if no one
came for the treasure-box, they picked up
the lines and drove oil

  Black Bart was always well dressed,
always polite, andhe never fired a shot
Frequently he was so grateful for the
contents of the treasure-box that he
dropped into poetry, which lie signed
“ POS,” and left pinned to a tree or laid
upon a rock at the scene of his exploit
The secret-service men were frantic, for
they could get no clue to the industrious
poet-highwayman

   But the pitcher went to the well once
too often At dusk on the evening of No-
vember 3, 1883, as the stage from Sonora
to Milton, California, reached the spot
where it had been held up on July 26,
1875, the familiar black figure stepped
out from behind the same old roc, and,
in its accustomed style, drew a bead on
Old Bill Moore, the driver, with the usual
•courteous request lo hand down the treas-
ure-box

Once Too Often

   Now, Old Bill’had been held up three
times before by the selfsame iigure in the
black mask, and he felt that his forbear-
ance was being imposed upon

  It made him mad clear through How-
ever, there was nothing to do but obey
orders, for the gentlemanly highwayman
certainly had the drop on him He kicked
the box to the ground and received a cor-
dial “ thank you,” coupled with permis-
sion to drive on

  Old Bill went on his way until he
reached the bottom of a little valley a
•quarter of a mile beyond, and out of sight
of the scene of the robbery Then he did
something which was in direct violation
of all the ethics of highway robbery He
stopped, wrapped the lines around the
handle of the brakes, crept back up the
road until he was within close range ol
the highwayman, who was still wrestling
with the lock on the treasure-box, and cut
loose at him with his revolver' With
bullets kicking up the dust all around him
and singing about his ears, the highway-
man departed with such extreme precipi-
tation that he left one of his cuffs behind
On the culf was a Chinese laundry mark
408

THE RAILROAD MAN’S MAGAZINE

  The laundry mark being identified, en-
abled Secret-S:ervice Officers J B Hume
and J N Thacker, of the express com-
pany, accompanied by a couple of police-
men, a week after the robbery to enter
the room of a quiet, well-bred gentleman
who lived within a block of Wells, 'Fargo
& Co’s office in San Francisco with drawn-'
revolvers and request him to hold up his
hands

  The quiet gentleman readily admitted
that he was Black Bart, the “ POS,” and
that he had committed the twenty-seven
robberies

  He admitted other things which made
Old Bill Moore madder than he was on
the evening of his last hold-up for he
declared that he had often held up stages
with an empty gun, and that on his last
adventure he had compelled Old Bill to
deliver the treasure - box by pointing a
fence picket at him In the gathering
dusk the picket looked enough like a rifle
to serve the purpose

  Black Bart declared that he had a hor-
ror of shedding blood, that he had never
hurt any one in his life, and that he would
have given up his profitable career of rob-
bery rather than fire a shot at a human
being

Near the Office

  He had lived for years within a block
of Wells, Fargo & Co’s office, had often
shipped booty stolen from the express
company over its own lines to his home
in San Francisco, and was in the habit of
taking his meals at a restaurant much
frequented by San Francisco detectives
He was well educated, well informed on
current topics, a good talker, and even
after his arrest exhibited genuine wit

  He had friends of the highest respecta-
bility, was cultured in manner, neat in
dress, never swore, and never gambled

  All this was of no avail, for he met the
same fate that was so relentlessly meted
out to the coarser class of highwaymen
who were recruited chiefly from laborers,
miners, farm-hands, and cowboys

■ After the capture of Black Bart, the
express companies had comparatively lit-
tle trouble with highwaymen until the
hard times of 1893, when there was a re-
crudescence of the crime, more particu-
larly in the region south and west of the
Missouri River

  In the first six months of 1893 there
-were twenty-one train robberies, the ex-
press-car being the object of attack in
each instance In the latter half of the
year this form of robbery was even more
frequent The express companies were
in desperation and so were the railroad
companies

  Meetings of the heads of both classes
of corporations were held to devise means
to stop the robberies, the matter was taken
up in Congress, and widely djscussed in
the press

  Guards on express-cars were doubled,
and inventors everywhere busied them-
selves with models of bullet-proof cars
which nobody wanted, because bullet-
proof cars could withstand dynamite no
better than any other kind

Best Prices for Dead Robbers

  There was only one thing to do, and
the express companies did it They in-
structed their secret-service departments
to bring in every man who took part in an
express robbery, regardless of cost, and
to do it with a swiftness which would
make the industry of express robbing un-
popular

  The manner in which the express com-
panies preferred to have their train rob-
bers brought in w-as indicated by the
standing offer of the American Express
Company of five hundred dollars a head
for dead express robbers and only one
hundred dollars a head for live ones This
offer applied only to the common run of
train robbers In aggravated cases the
reward was greatly increased

  When the Dalton gang, which in less
than two years robbed the express com-
panies of three hundred thousand dollars
and killed four men in doing it, was wiped
out at Coffeyville, Kansas, on the 5th of
October, 1892, the express companies sent
six thousand dollars by telegraph within
twenty-four hours after the shooting to
the men who did it This was supple-
mented by an additional ten thousand dol-
lars by mail a few days later

  C S Cox, the Wells, Fargo & Co agent
who fired the first shot and brought down
his man, wras presented with a fine gold
watch and chain with an inscription com-
memorating his deed, and Jim Spears, the
liveryman who killed three of the gang
EXPRESS THIEVES, AND HOW TO CATCH THEM 409

as fast as he could work the lever of his
repeating rifle, was given a gold medal
in addition to his share of the money re-
ward

Quite Remunerative

  In short, the hunting of express rob-
bers was' made so remunerative that very
soon there were no robbers left to
hunt and for the last dozen years the
express companies have enjoyed an al:
most complete immunity from stage and
train robberies that has left them free to
perfect a system of protection from dis-
lionest employees

  The prevention of theft by employees
presents a totally different problem from
that afforded by highwaymen, and one
distinctly easier of solution The salaried
employee is higher up in the social scale
than the highwayman Therefore when he
goes wrong he is easier to trace, and fam-
ily ties and old associations exert a far
more powerful influence in bringing him
back sooner or later to the scene of his
crime, where he may be apprehended at a
minimum of trouble and expense

  The system of checking used in the
express business is so elaborate that the
disappearance of a valuable package is at
once detected To begin with, when a
money package comes into an express of-
fice, it is receipted for and then sealed
by two clerks Every man into whose cus-
tody the package is given must sign a re-
ceipt for it

Down to a Minimum

  If it goes from one principal point to
another, it is placed in a safe with a com-
bination lock The messenger who lias
charge of the safe on the train never
knows the combination, and therefore
could not open it without blowing it open
The only money packages he handles are
those destined to local points on his run,
so even if he were inclined to be dishonest
his opportunities are circumscribed

  The chances given to a dishonest man •
to steal are reduced to a minimum by a
civil-service system by which all men in
positions of trust are tried out pretty
thoroughly in subordinate places before
they are permitted to handle money

  After a man has been advanced to a
place in which he may be tempted to be

dishonest he is safeguarded in a way
which has proved wondrously effective
Every express-messenger must furnish a
bond from the American Surety Company
of two thousand five hundred dollars to
five thousand dollars, according to the
importance of his run, and every agent is
also placed under bonds ranging from five
hundred dollars to five thousand dollars
This is not done because the express com-
pany expects the amount of the bond to
recoup them in case of loss, but because
the American Surety Company has a de-
tective staff which is not surpassed in the
world

Capture Is Certain

  If an employee steals anything from
an express company his capture and pun-
ishment are as certain as anything human
can be If the sum stolen is less than the
amount of his bond, the surety company
is notified, and the express company gives
itself no further concern in the matter
If the amount of the theft exceeds the
amount of the bond, the express company
detectives cooperate with the operators of
the surety company in running down the
culprit

  Some curious notions are extant regard-
ing what takes place when an express
company is robbed The popular idea is
that if a messenger or other employee of
•an express company were to decamp with
a large sum there would be agitated con-
ferences of officials, frantic messages, and
wild hurryings to and fro of an army of
detectives who would sacrifice appetites
and sleep in running down all sorts of
impossible clues

  The culfirit always shares this belief,
and acts upon it He gets as far as pos-
sible from the scene of his crime in the
shortest practicable time, and for several
months goes into hiding that is often very
good

Impossible to Get Away

  What really happens in a case of rob-
bery is as far as possible from the popular
idea If an express-messenger en route
from New York to Chicago were to dis-
appear from his train with fifty thousand
dollars to-morrow the trainmen would
notify his division superintendent as soon
as he were missed When the absent mes-
410

THE RAILROAD mAn'S MAGAZINE

senger’s run was checked up at Chicago
the exact amount of his shortage would be
known, and reported by wire with such
other facts as were available to the general
manager in New York

  The general manager would order the
message to be sent to the surety company
and dismiss the matter from its mind

  The president of the surety company
would give the message a casual glancfe
send it up to I lie secret-service department,
and apparently forget all about it Such
an event would be considered merely a
routine incident to be ground through
the proper department, and that is all

  When the matter was referred to the
secret - service department, a description
of the man wanted would be sent to each
of the twenty branch offices scattered at
advantageous points throughout the coun-
try, with instructions to take him in if
found If on investigation no really sat-
isfactory clue were discovered, nothing
further would be done All the operators
in the detective department would tuck
the description of the man wanted and his
crime away in a convenient corner of their
brains and go about their business Ex-
ecutive officers of corporations are seldom
give'n to spending money unless they have
a pretty definite idea that something is to
be gamed by the expenditure and cer-
tainly the sending of detectives on wild-
goose chases is an unpromising invest-
ment

Gets Within Gunshot

  Nobody does any worrying but the
fugitive Neither the express company
nor the surety company is in any hurry
to get the culprit back In the first place,
haste is unnecessary  and in the second
place, it is undesirable The'moral ef-
fect of an arrest four years after a rob-
bery is considered much greater than if
made four weeks afterward

  But perhaps the consideraton of great-
est weight is that in ninety-nine cases out
of a hundred the fugitive will practically
arrest himself if given time enough That
is, he will either come back where he is
certain to be seen by the operators,- or
else he will betray his hiding-place by
some clue so unmistakable that his arrest
requires no effort beyond the journey to
get him

  The conduct of the fugitive from jus-

tice is singularly like that of a rabbit
when flushed by the hunter At first he
scurries wildly away, then circles back to-
ward his starting-point until he is within
easy gunshot

  A few examples may serve to show,
perhaps, that the work of a detective is
more like the vigil of a cat for a mouse
than like the Sherlock Holmes of fiction,
who racks his brains over a partly burned
match to determine whether it was struck
by a right-handed' or a left-handed man
and finally reaches the sagacious conclu-
sion that it was used by some one who
wanted a light

Without an Effort

  F P Beers,' Wells, Fargo & Co’s
agent at Campbell Hall, New York, six
years ago took a shipment of four hundred
dollars and disappeared The case was
duly reported and promptly forgotten by
every one but the operators in the secret-
service department of the surety compa-
ny Beers had never had a photograph
taken, so the operators had only his de-
scription to work on Eight months after
Beers disappeared, W L Johnson, one
of the surety company's operators, noticed
a man on Broadway who had evidently
just arrived from the country, judging
by the way he was staring about him A
closer look revealed a face and figure
that tallied with the missing Beers John1,
son stepped up behind the stranger, struck
him a resounding slap between the shoul-
ders and exclaimed:

  “ Why hallo, Beers! Why did you
take that four hundred dollars and leave
your wife at'Campbell Hall”

  The man was so startled by the slap
and the question that before he could re-
gain his self-possessiosi he blurted out:

  “ I had to”

  Then he realized that he had betrayed
himself, and followed Johnson shame-
facedly enough to meet his fate

  George Brooks, alias Hamilton McAu-
ley, formerly a telegraph - operator, was
Adams Express agent at West Hickory,
Pennsylvania, in 1888 His knowledge
of telegraphy and the express business
enabled him to evolve the most ingenious
scheme in the history of the company for
robbing the safe of one of the messen-
gers
EXPRESS THIEVES, AND

HOW TO CATCH THEM 411

   Taking a telegraph - instrument, he
 went to a lonely spot a mile outside of
 Templeton, Pennsylvania, sent a message
 purporting to be from George Bingham,
 the division superintendent of the express
 company, ordering Thomas Bingham, the
 messenger he knew would be on the run
 from Oil City to Pittsburgh that day,,
 to turn his run over to Hamilton McAu-
 ley at Templeton and return to Parker
 to await orders Then he cut the wires so
 the message could not be verified Then
 McAuley went to the station and waited
 for Bingham’s train

   As everything seemed regular enough,
 Bingham turned his run over to McAu-
 ley in accordance with the fake telegram
 McAuley checked Bingham out in proper
 style and went on to Pittsburgh There
 he checked out, and while on the way
 from the depot to the express office took
 a package containing ten thousand dollars
 -and disappeared

Finally Caught

   He succeeded in getting to Brazil Aft-
 er the lapse of four years he concluded
 that, as he had never seen any indications
 of pursuit, he might safely venture back
 home He was getting homesick, and, be-
 sides, he was nearly out of money He
 returned to Oil City under the name of
 Clyde P Hamilton, and was arrested on
 the 1st of May, 1892, within twenty-four
 hours after his arrival, tried, convicted,
 and sentenced to four years

   He had been recognized by an operator
 of the express company when he landed
 in New York, followed to Oil City to
 save'delay in extradition, and arrested

   George T Bagley, a United States Ex-
 press messenger, running west-out of Chi-
 cago on the Rock Island 011 the 18th of
 November 1892, took a shipment of one
 hundred thousand dollars, and left his car
 at Davenport, Iowa The trainmen im-
 mediately notified the division superin-
 tendent of the express company Just
 eight hours after his crime had been com-
 mitted, Bagley stepped off a train in Chi-
 cago into the arms of an express company
 detective who was waiting for him The
 detective had rightly concluded that Bag-
 ley would hurry back to Chicago as af-
 fording the best place for concealment
 pending a chance to leave the country

Every cent of his booty was recovered, and
twenty-four days later he was sentenced
to three years in the penitentiary

To the Antipodes

  Paul Hume, a Wells, Fargo & Co mes-
senger running between Sacramento and
Redding, California, absconded with
three thousand dollars on the 7th of
March, 1893 He managed to get on
board a vessel bound for Honolulu, and
after wandering aimlessly about from
port to port in the Pacific, he reached
Brisbane, Australia, in September of the
same year Here he imagined himself
safe But in less than a month a man
stepped up to him 'in the street and said:

  “ Well, Hume, I guess it’s about time
for you to go home and take your medi-
cine”

  T C Valentine, an express agent at
Elgin, Illinois, absconded eight years ago
with a shipment of ten thousand dollars
He succeeded in getting to Bluefields,
where, as he knew Nicaragua had no ex-
tradition treaty with the United States,
he thought he would be safe

   In six weeks an operator for the Amer-
ican Surety Company who had followed
the trail he had so plainly left, found him
on a cofFee-plantation in the interior The
operator talked the matter over with Val-
entine, saying that while he could not be
taken back against his will, the best thing
for him to do was to return, take his pun-
ishment, and begin, life anew

Getting Him Back

  The operator pointed out the obvious
facts that the country was extremely un-
healthful, and that even if he escaped the
fever he was among strangers who could
not speak his language, that his money
would soon be gone, and that he would
have 110 means of getting more, that he
was far away from friends, and that he
had condemned himself to a worse fate
than that which awaited him at home

  Valentine agreed to go back with the
operator They returned to the coast, and
while waiting for a steamer to take them
home Valentine was stricken with yellow
fever No one would go near him but the
operator who had run him down He
nursed Valentine tenderly till he died
37-YEAR-OLD PASS STILL GOOD

The Remarkable History of an Old-Time “ Free Ticket ” Issued by
the Texas and Pacific Railway Company, and the
Men Who Were Connected with It

BY C A BEEHN

IN Marshall, Texas, is an old-time rail-
road pass, which may prove interesting
on account of its age and because the men
connected with it are' now prominent in
business in different parts of the United
States

 This old pass is the property of J E
Powell, familiarly called  Al ” Powell, who
is conductor on the Louisiana division of
the Texas and Pacific Railroad Mr Pow-
ell has had it in his possession for twenty
yeajs He values it highly Through his
kindness, a facsimile is reproduced here

  When Mr Powell first saw the pass, lie
expressed a wish to own it It was then
several years old About a year later, when
the owner was traveling on the train upon
which Mr Powell was conductor, he said:
“Al you want this old pass very badly,
don't you   and when Mr Powell expressed
a wish for it, it was given lo him as a
souvenir It is in good condition yet

  The pass was printed in Marshall, in the
Iron Age office, about 1871 or 1872, by W B
Clark, who then ran the print-shop on the
public square The Texas and Pacific Rail-
road issued it August 23 1873' to Floyd
Shock, ji’ho at that time represented Van
Beek, Benard & Tinsley, printers, of St
Louis, and reads  From Marshall to Shreve-
port, Account of the Transportation De-

partment Good one way only Not good

unless used within--days from date

 And not transferable”

  It is signed by John F Dickson, general
 superintendent, and countersigned by W H
 Newman, G F and P A Its number is
 5M

   Strange to say that, though this old pass
 is nearly thirty-seven years old, all of the
 men whose names appear 011 it are - still
 living and are prominent business men in
 various parts of the country

  Floyd Shock, to whom the pass was is-
sued, was then a traveling man and is now
in the Central National Bank, St Louis, Mis-
souri

  John F Dickson, who signed the pass as
 general superintendent of the Texas and
 Pacific Railroad, was the founder of the
 Marshall Car Wheel & Foundry Company,
 and is now the owner of the Dickson foun-
 dry at Houston, Texas

  W H Newman, who countersigned the
pass as general freight and passenger agent
of the Texas and Pacific Railroad, is the
same Bill Newman' widely known in the
railtoad world, who for many years past,
was president of the New York Central
'lines, and is now a director in many of the
largest railroads in the United States

  Mr Newman, who began his railroad ca-
 ' reer in Marshall, has
 gone up as high as any
 one could in his profes-
 sion, and is recognized
 as one of the greatest
 railroad men in the coun-
 try, still makes occasion-
 al trips to Marshall

  The pass was never
used, and is still good,
because it bears no time
limit It is stated that
the reason it was not
used was because shortly
after it was issued yel-
low fever broke out in
the neighborhood of
Marshall

No 23—Hiram Benson Lightful, the Cross-
ing-Watchman of Pippenville—His Fancy
Job, His Wonderful Whiskers Which
Won Him a Wife, and His System
Which He Alone Defied

S soon as a village reaches a
population of five hun-
dred, it organizes into a
town or city, elects a
board of trustees, and puts
on a few 'airs It gets a
town marshal, with a star sometimes cut
from the bottom of a tomato can It gets
a debt that will run into the next genera-
tion, and then proceeds to enact a few
ordinances for the regulation of its in-
ternal affairs

  Usually, the curfew ordinance comes
first, then a pig ordinance, then a pedler
ordinance, then an c(f3inance compelling
the railroad to place a flagman at Main
Street where the railroad crosses

  There is nothing so satisfying to the
board of trustees as the flagman ordi-
nance It gives the town the same metro-
politan aspect that the bonded indebted-
ness does It advertises ■

  When the passenger-train pulls over,
and the passengers see a flagman at the
crossing, and get a fleeting glimpse of the
Odd Fellows’ Block up the street 011 the
corner, they cast up the place as of some
importance

  This is gratifying to the local pride,
and doesn't cost the town a cent

  A railroad does not always enthuse over
the crossing-watchman proposition

  It will now and then succeed in com-
promising the matter with the town coun-
cil by installing an electric signal at the
crossing

  This is a mechanical arrangement that
gives warning of the approach of a train
by monotonously tapping a gong, thereby
notifying all concerned to “ look out”

  The gong outfit is not always satis-
factory to the town trustees, as it spends
no money and adds nothing to the popu-
lation The human crossing-watchman
counts one, and his pay goes to the mer-
chants

  Crossing-watchmen divide into two
general groups

  One is provided with a “dog-house,
or “ shanty” His working equipment
consists of a lantern and a white flag
When a train approaches, he sallies forth
to the middle of the street and personally
stops the travel outfits that are about to
cross the track until after the train

  The other kind is more aristocratic

  He lives in an elevated house, and, by
a simple device, raises and lowers an arm
or gate across the street without the neces-
sity of going outside He is the city
watchman

  In all the small town and country cross-
ings only the first-named are employed

  Quite naturally, then, when the faith-
ful chronicler of the thoughts and deeds
of railroaders seeks to write of a job with
an active-personality connection, he tags
the watchman who marches out into the
middle of the street, with motion, gesture,
and loud command, who seizes the reins
of high-stepping horses, who lays heroic
hands on some aged venturer, and who
violently yanks some reckless youth from
threatened danger

  That’s a real crossing-watchman

  The man who, from an elevated loft,
taps his bell a few tinjes, then merely
raises and lowers an arm over the street,
has no personal contact with the passing
throng

  “ That kind of a job’s a snap,” said
Hiram Benson Lightful, when 1 men-
tioned the citcrossing-watchman “They
don’t have to stand right out in the street
in all kinds of weather, and take a hand
in it, and git cussed and bumped around
and run over like we do Any old woman
can dowhat they do,'’ he added contempt-
uously	t

  I have wanted to write of Hiram and
Hiram’s job for some time

  If all the crossing-w'atchmen in the
land were mustered into one battalion, it
would far outnumber the old Continental
army So they deserve a passing line in
railroad literature

  Hiram may be pardoned for speaking
disrespectfully of the city watchman
Perhaps the city watchman could put one
over on Hiram if he were asked We
might start something—say, the outside
vs the inside crossing-watchman  but far
be it

  Leave it to statesmen, clergymen, doc-
tors, and explorers to view one another
with distrust, ridicule, and contempt If
Hiram has a little of the same for his co-
workers, it is only a human quality No
discredit to Hiram for it

  Hiram is watchman at the Main Street
crossing at Pippenville every day from six
to six

  He carries a white flag in one hand,
with which to wave the street traffic to a
halt when a train approaches

  His whiskers are of Time’s kindly
frost, discolored by tobacco-juice A man
with amber-stained whiskers-will tell you
all—any time—anywhere—and glad of
the opportunity

  I sat down in Hiram’s “ shanty” I do
not know why such opprobrious names are
given for a watchman’s house as “ shan-
ty ” and “ dog-house”

   As a rule, they are nice, neat, tidy little
houses, with window's all around, a good
chair, and one of those heavy little iron
stoves that radiates warmth to every nook
They are'observatories, and they deserve
a more classic and dignified name

   The walls were decorated with dazzling
pictures of beauties, near beauties, and
semibeauties lifted from the wide selec-
tion of pictorial advertising Three cal-
endars stood out in bold reminder of the
passing days, A crossing - watchman's
house always contains calendars No one
knows why The watchman is on the job
every day of the year, and why he should
have occasion to mark the clays or the
months, since they are all exactly alike
to jjiim, no one knows

  But the beauties! They were eying me
with coquettish squints or open-eyed inno-
cence from every angle

   “ Where did you find this collection of
angel-faces, Hiram ” I asked

  “ Whenever I run acrost a purty one,

I git it and tack it up inside,” he replied

“ Them is some of the finest that ever
peeped out All us erossin’-watchmens
is old uns—and broken down Maybe
you never tho’t of that Everything else
gits old and stale to an old man except—
except the face of a purty woman When
1 git so 1 don't care to look on them any ■
longer, I reckon there’ll be some doin’s
for the undertaker”

  “ How long have you been with the
company, Hiram” I asked

   “ Let’s see,” said he “ What year was
it old Horace Greeley run for President
In 1872, wasn’t it I went to work on
the section the year before that makes
thirty-nine years, doesn’t it Guess that’s
it Thirty-nine years”

  “ Didn’t they ever offer you anything
better, Hiram Didn’t they ever want to
boost you  ”

give ’em a chanct Whenever they crowd-

  “ Guess this is about where I belong

as me I-Iere comes the switch engine
Wait till I stop that mule team

  “ Watchin’ a crossin’ is one of the most

  “ Is it” I replied “ I never thought
of it in that way”

  “ Course you never hev Nobody does

section foreman, so that puts you, Hiram,
along about-number five on the list”

  “ Section foreman ! Telegraph oper-
ators ! ” exclaimed Hiram “ Huh ! How
do they git in on it” Hiram spat con-
temptuously into the corner of the shanty
“ I ain’t never seen eny section foreman
or telegraph operators wearing eny of
them Carnegie-breastplates”

  “ There isn’t any such thing as the In-
ternational Union or the Amalgamated
Association of Crossing-Watchmen, is
there, Hiram”

  “ They ain’t no order of us,” replied
Hiram “ 'cause they’s no way we can git
together If we was organized, and c'u’d
all go out, we’d tie up the road tighter’n
blixin”

  “ I can’t figure that out,” I said
416

THE RAILROAD MAN’S MAGAZINE

  “Can’teh Why,
it’s 'cause the law’d
git after them right
away Crossing-

fixed by statutes

They’ve got to be,
and every day, too

If they’s eny miss,

  “But, Hiram”

1 protested, “ they
wouldn’t be over
an hour and a half
finding some one to
take your p lace

There are hundreds
of old men everywhere who would jump
at the change of a life tenancy in this neat
little bunga’ , and at the easy work you
have to do”

  “That’s what you say!” exclaimed
Hiram with warmth, and bearing heavy
on the “you” “They can’t git ’em, I-
tell you Every time they’s a vacant
crossing it takes a week or ten days to find
some one that’ll take it They can’t git
’em! Ain’t easy work, either You’re
like everybody else that works on a rail-,
road All the other fellows got a nice,
easy job I’ve heard ’em all talk Never
heard one yet but what thinks he’s got tlie
worst of it, and everybody else’s got it
better ’an him

  “ When eny one tells me watchin’ a
street-crossing is a nice easy job I ask
’em did you ever do any of it They say
no they haven’t, but they seen it done
Then 1 tell ’em it’s always easy seein’
things done, and that they got the wrong
answer, and to guess again No, sir!
They couldn’t fill our places

  “ You see, if we’d go on a strike, I’d
picket I’d march up and down and
around the crossin’ every day while the

strike was' on, a
picketin’! Do you
think e n y b o d y
would want to take
this job and scab
while I was doin’
picket duty right
ag’in’ him An’
then the company
’ud git soaked every
day they wasn’t a
watchman on duty
Before a week,
they’d be dinged
glad to arbitrate,
an’ we’d all git a
raise”

  I-] iram chuckled
as if the whole cam-,
'paign had been un-
dertaken and trium-
phantly pulled off

  “Ain’t everybody
can watch a cross-
ing, and do it as it
ort to be done,”
Hiram continued
“ I’ve been right
here six years, and
I got a system They wasn’t eny system
when 1 come here, it was two or three
years before I got the people educated to
my systeoi

  “ You can’t watch a crossing by just
posin’ You can’t stand out there like one
of them mile-posts You got to move
about, and see what’s eomin’, and calcu-
late velocities, and then motion ’em over
or motion ’em to stop

  “ My idea was to teach ’em all to de-
pend on me—to watch iir Not to rub-
ber up and down the tracks theirselves,
but to keep their eyes glued on me, and I
give ’em the sign what to do

  “ I know about all tlie teams, and about
everybody that drives acrost And they
all know me They’ve learnt my system,
and they watch for me to motion ’em
They ali depend on me

   “ At first they didn’t pay eny attention
to me, but when I’d go up and grab the
horses by the bridle, they begin to take
notice, and soon they was understandin’
that here’s a man that knows his busi-
ness”

  The switch-enc-’ie returned with a
string of cars, and Hiram sauntered out

with his white flag to stand guard until
it passed

  He returned _to the shanty with a
sprightly step He took oft' his old cap
and substituted a respectable derby Then
he stood before an unframed fragment of
a mirror tacked against the wall and
combed his whiskers into a flowing ele-
gance

  Then fie strode briskly forth to the
middle of the street again, and assumed,
as I thought, a rather heroic pose

  There was no train in sight, but I heard
the rattle of an approaching vehicle

  It came to a stop at a safe distance
from the track

  The driver was a red-cheeked woman of
fifty-five or sixty, and driving a cart
loaded with the products of a truck-patch

  Hiram craned his neck in both direc-
tions up and down the track then, step-
ping nimbly aside, called out: “ All right,
Mrs Doud come acrost! ”

  “ Thank you, Hiram,” said the wom-
an, smiling expansively

  Hiram lifted his stiff hat and bowed a
Chesterfieldian acknowledgment

  “That was very neatly done, Hiram,”
said I, when he returned to the shanty
“ Still, I don’t see why you should have
been so overcautious”

  “ That’s Widow Doud,” said Hiram,
with a sort of sheepish apology “ She
kind o’ depends on me She don’t like to
go over unless I tell her it’s all right It’s
part of the system I’ve built up of cross-
in’-watchin’”

  Hiram took off his stfE hat and hung
it up on the hook very carefully Then
he put on his old cap, and eyed himself
in the glass critically

  “ You wouldn’t take me to be sixty-
five, would you” he asked rather ab-
ruptly

  “ Why, Hiram,” I replied warmly,
“ you don’t look a day over fifty This
kind of a life agrees with you You are
good for an even hundred on this job”

  “ Maybe so,” said Hiram “ but some-
times I git an idee I’ll quit it I git to
thinkin’— That Doud woman ain’t bad-
lookin’, is she ”

  This sudden and seemingly irrelevant
turn of the conversation took me by sur-
prise

  “Why, no, Hiram,” I acknowledged
“ She’s a little broad across, but she has
a pleasant face”

  “ She’s a widow, and she owns a thirty-
acre truck-patch down on the river bot-
tom They tell me she makes three or
four hundred dollars a year on it, and

does all the work herself That’s a nice
business—truck-patchin’, when you re-
duce it to a system”

  Hiram parted his whiskers in the mid-
dle, and gave them an artistic brush on
both sides Then he went 011:

  “ I wasn’t on this job more’n a week
but who should drive up but Mrs Doud
They hadn’t been eny system in runnin’
this crossin’ before then, so she didn’t pay
eny attention to me, even when I made
a motion for her to stop

  “ The local was just about to back out
from the freight - house track, but she
never stopped so I just steps up in front
of her old gray horse, grabbed the reins,
and brought it to a standstill all of a
suddent

  “ The woman had just gotten up out of
her seat, and was kind o’ leanin’ over to
see for herself if eny train was cornin’
When I yanked the horse, she just went
on out over the dashboard and lit on her
head

  “ When she got up, she was madder
then thunder She chased me around that
vegetable wagon three times before she
got out of breath I tried to reason I
said: ‘ Madam, they’s got to be system to
this crossin’ business!’ Then she just
hauled off and smashed me right in the
eye with one of them ripe tomatoes of
her’n That riled me somethin’ fierce, and
we had a heated argument right there A
big crowd gathered round to hear it

  “ More’n a year that woman wouldn’t
look at me Finally, when she got to un-
derstandin’ the system I had in runnin’
this business, she come off her perch, and
we’ve been good friends ever since”

  I assured Hiram that in every depart-
ment of railroading it is a hard struggle
to make people understand and appreciate
the things we do, and the provisions we
make for their safety but that persist-
ence and good nature would, in the end,
win, and that, when once educated, they
are thankful to us for our efforts in their
behalf

  “ That’s so! ” exclaimed Hiram with
enthusiasm “ She is! She’s told me so!
She’s told me that maybe I saved her life
that time”

  “ How long have you been a widower,
Hiram” I asked by way of injecting a
little human sympathy into the conversa-
tion

  “Ten years the tenth of last March
This crossin’ job ain't so bad for a single
man I’ve salted away over three hundred
dollars since I’ve been here Groceries
air all-fired high now, ain’t they Do
you think two could live about as cheap
as one can board  ”

  Hiram didn’t wait for an answer to
that one, but made haste to add:

  “ What you’re speakin’ about is right
It’s hard work to make people come to
your way of doin’ things They’s a fellow
that drives a mule team for the rubber
works that don’t want to pay eny atten-
tion to me Some day he’ll git his all
right!

  “ Then they’s a young fellow comes
along here every once in a while in a big
red automobile He’s a smart Aleck If
No 21 would just toss him over into the
next county some day, they wouldn’t be
eny regrets from yours truly

  “ They’s some drivers that ort to git it
They don’t care themselves, and they ort
to be smashed up once in a while, and
that would help us to keep others from
bein’ too risky”

  No 76 whistled for the station, and I
walked out with Hiram to the middle of
the street

  A quarter of a mile away a red auto-
mobile was headed toward us and coming
at a merry clip

  “That’s him!” exclaimed Hiram ex-
citedly “ That’s that young upstart and
his red devil I was tellin’ you about I’ll
git him stopped this time all right, ’cause
76 is cornin’ He’s got to stop While
he’s waitin’ for 76 to pull over, I’ll let
him know they’s got to be some system to
this hereafter”

  It was a question which would arrive
first, 76 or the auto Both were racing
steadily forward

  It did not matter to Hiram how the
race appeared He had but one idea, and
that was to stop the auto and upbraid the
young fellow good and plenty for past
recklessness

  Hiram went through furious gyrations
with arms and flag

  I noticed the young fellow' bend slight-
ly forward and put on a little more power

  By this time Hiram was whirling
around like an air-motor in a hurricane,

  There was a sort of swish and a zip and

“ No use, Hiram,” sakl I, in mollifying

his shanty, which he has given a gar-
dener’s attention for many years, and
which is trim and clean as a velvet carpet

  Mrs Doud, surveying it from the com-
fortable vantage of her vegetable-cart,
complimented him on its neatness

  “ These surroundin’s make a man kind
o’ sentimental about quittin’ a job that
lie’s took a pride in so many years,” said
Hiram “ But I’m gittin’ to an age
where I got to begin to figure 011 some-
thing ahead I’ve got to look out for Hi-
ram a little, sentiment or no sentiment”
He paused reflectively, then added:

  “ Meat’s awful high I was readin’ in
a paper the Pullman conductor throwed
off to me the other day that the Secre-
tary of the Treasury or Interior, or Com-
missioner of Patents or Pensions, or some
one high up, says it ain’t goin’ to git eny
cheaper for a good many years

  “ Then, thinks I to myself, thinks I,
if meat keeps so high, people will haft to
eat vegetables Now’s the time to go into

  “ Go to it, Hiram,” I said encouraging-
ly “ Opportunity knocks but once on the
dog-house door He’s been a long time
finding you, but at last he’s tapped Arise
and follow! ”

  It was not a great while after that

there was a new watchman at the Main
Street crossing,and Widow Doud’s vege-
table cart, with a new driver, approached
from down the street

  No 21 whistled for the crossing

  The new watchman got out into the
middle of the street and waved his white
flag once or twice in a listless sort of way

  The new driver of the vegetable cart
gave his horse a cut, and came spurting
forward, entirely ignoring the watchman

  The watchman grasped at the horse’s
bridle, but the driver, with an explosive
command, laid on the whip so vigorously
that the horse broke away and lunged
forward

  The reader may recall what our reminis-
cent grandmothers tell about the shooting
stars of 1833 This time the pyrotechnics
consisted wholly of turnips and cabbage

  Hiram wasn’t hurt much He picked
himself up before the bystanders got to
him He shook his fist violently at the
new watchman

  “Look what you done! Don’t you
think I know this crossin’ If you hadn’t
laid your hands on the horse, you dinged
muttonhead I’d a got acrost and 21
wouldn’t a hit me! I’ll report you, I

  Hiram had defied the system!

STARTLING RAILROAD STATISTICS

THE most marvelous array of statistics
presented for some time past was that
offered by the Bureau of Railway News and
Statistics These figures are so stupendous
that one can scarcely comprehend their real
meaning as they stall'd in orderly rows, di-
vided into groups of three by portly com-
mas Figures are mounting up so rapidly
nowadays that the statisticians have to keep
on hand an ample supply of ciphers

  In ten years, nearly seven billion people
were carried by the railroads of the United
States, and in a single year 1908, one and
one-half billion tons of freight were trans-
ported over the shining rails from one part
of the country to another

  The weight of the individual locomotives
has increased 115 per cent, and the number
75 per cent, there being now almost 57000
puffing over the United States The increase
in the capacity of freight-cars has been ap-
proximately 120 per cent, making their pres-
ent carrying capacity more than 71,000000
tons

  Perhaps the statistics giving the number of
railroad employees are the most impressive
nearly a million and a half people, an in-
crease of 67 per cent, are now on the pay-
rolls of the United States railroads, draw-
ing a compensation of a billion dollars a
year, an increase of 110 per cent over ten
years ago

A HEART OF THE NORTH

BY GEORGE VAN SCHAICK

       Pierre Meets Anne Marie, and Learns Why
       There Is a Great Tragedy in Her Life

        CHAPTER I
        The Upset Canoe

£ | HE roar of great falls began
to boom through the mist
olltIllll i!il 11 of the morning, and became
SO I  louder with every stroke that
fiJi sent the birch canoe lustily
up-stream Great boulders
lined both shores, and beyond them, in
hazy faintness, rose the serrated line of
the forest-trees

  To Pierre Ferguson there was music in
the drip of the paddle, in the tremulous
sigh of aspens, in the song of the dark
water as it rushed by him, deep and dark,
bearing great ragged flecks of foam

  The crashing of the cataract came
nearer, and the water whitened with the
spume that was whirled in great eddies
Then the man saw the place where the
portage began It was a sandy spot,
nearly at the foot of the falls, whose
heavy spray blew over it

  Near it was an old camping-ground,
surrounded by rotting tent - pegs and
brown with the dead successive layers of
rusty fir-boughs that had formed the bed-
ding of previous voyagers Charred ends
of logs marked the site of the fires that
haxl been lighted there

  A stroke of the paddle brought the
canoe along the side of the tiny beach,
and Pierre stepped ashore, preceded by
his dog, a rough Irish terrier that began
to search at once for a possible hare or
squirrel, barking in delirious joy at the
number of lovely smells he alone knew
how to enjoy

   In the meanwhile, his master began to
empty the canoe of its contents There

  were several large water-proof bags and
  a smaller one, holding an aluminum
  cooking outfit The fishing-rods, which
  were lashed to the side of the canoe,
  were allowed to remain there but the
  gun, in its canvas case, was carefully
  placed on the bags

    Two paddles were crossed amidship of
  the canoe, and, bending over, Pierre
  brought it up until it rested upon his
  knees and then, with a slight effort,
  lifted it upon his shoulders A small
  tump-line fastened to the cross-bars was
  fitted upon his head, well forward, part-
  ly on the forehead

    With the left hand he steadied the
  canoe and with the right picked up the
  gun, and, whistling to his dog, began the
  journey over the faint trail of the portage

    It first led him up a sharp hill, cov-
  ered with stones and of uncertain foot-
  ing  and then down an incline into a
  swampy bit where his high moccasins
  sank deep into the soft black ooze Then
  once more into the woodland, where the
  path twisted around great mossy rocks
  and fallen trees

    To the right he could hear the rapids,
  hidden by the dense growth of birches
  and alders on the bank The dog was
  busily exploring nooks along the path,
  which soon came out upon some burned
  land, where the solemn ghosts of great
  trees projected, twisted as if in pain,
  their gnarled black limbs, fantastically
  like strange, living forms, apparently sor-
  rowing in the bleak solitude over the
  graveyard of the once hale forest

     But the brule was soon passed, the tall
  green growth again reached, and a
  glimpse of dark, placid water showed
  ahead

THE RAILROAD MAN’S MAGAZINE

  Suddenly, from up the stream, there
was the loud crash of a gun, reverber-
ating among the surrounding hills, and,
after a brief interval, a loud, shrill cry
of distress

  It was a woman’s voice, and Pierre,
throwing the canoe into the bushes along
the path, ran on, still carrying his gun,
leaping over fallen mossy trunks, sinking
in black ooze, tearing through the drip-
ping bushes that met over the portage

  He dashed out of the woods upon a
sandy point jutting out into the river,
perhaps a hundred yards above where
the water began to boil, and saw that a
woman was being carried down the
stream toward the boulder-strewn white
torrent in its rush toward the falls
Once or twice her head sank under the
swift water as she lifted up her arms

  One glance farther up, before he
leaped in the river, showed him a great
bull moose that was struggling amid the
wreckage of a canoe, with which the
mighty beast seemed to be inextricably
mixed up

  Pierre was seized at once by the strong
current With all the strength he had he
swam toward the passing woman his
fierce strokes soon brought him to 'her,
and her long black hair met his grasp

  Then came the fight for two lives, and
there was a lust in it, a fierce develop-
ment of a passion of struggle, such as
seizes strong men in the hour of strife

  Inch by inch he neared the shore, foot
by foot the white water drew him toward
the rapids It tore at him and clung to
him, and pulled savagely and struggled
for the possession of his burden, as
though maddened with a longing for the
blood of men

  He sank several times and emerged,
gasping, yet always battling fiercely
When one of his knees struck the bottom
his breath had become a hoarse gurgling,
and his strength was ebbing away Far-
ther on in the more shallow water he
managed to regain his feet, and the
weight of the woman, whom he had taken
in one of his arms, helped to steady him,
while the water boiled around his legs
as if seeking to tear him away

  Thus he made his way to the shore,
now bearing the burden easily in the ex-
ultation of a fight that was won

  When he reached the sand-bar he de-

posited the half-drowned creature on the
sand, and it was only then that he per-
ceived another human form lying pros-
trate upon the rocks, higher up the river
and partly submerged

  The moose was still there, struggling,
and he rushed to the place where he had
thrown down his gun, tore off the cover,
and at the crashing of the smokeless
cartridge the great animal dropped heav-
ily among the torn birch strips and
broken cedar ribs of the canoe

  Running up, he found an old Indian,
who had partly dragged himself out of
the water upon the rocks As he pulled
him out he noticed that one of the legs
was twisted in an unnatural position,
and the old fellow groaned with pain

  As he seemed to be breathing natural-
ly, Pierre placed him with the head and
shoulders resting upon a fallen tree-
trunk and ran back to the woman

  She had partly raised herself, lying
upon one hip, with her hands resting
upon the sand before her, breathing with
difficulty She looked up as Pierre bent
over her, and spat a mouthful of blood
before speaking

  “ Is he dead ” she asked in her famil-
iar French

  In French he reassured her, telling her
the man was living, but adding that he
looked very ill,

  As he knelt by her, she stared at him

  “ The Manitou-ilno told of the white
man,” she said, seeming to'speak to her-
self, “ and there is the little yellow ad-
Hom as she saw the terrier, who, in
great excitement, was attempting to ca-
ress his master

  She made an effort to get on her feet

  “ Let me carry you,” he said

  She shook her head and arose, pain-
fully and slowly, with his help Hold-
ing her hand to her right side and biting
her lip, with Pierre’s arm under hers, she
began to walk toward the old man in
silence, her short, gasping breathing
painful to hear They reached the fallen
tree, and she attempted to kneel by the
prostrate form  but her strength was ex-
hausted, and she collapsed by its side

  Pier long black hair, bedraggled and
full of sand, partly fell over a dark face
of pure Indian type She wore a man’s
coat and a long skirt of some cheap
woolen material On her feet were the
A HEART OF THE NORTH

423

high boots of the savage She seemed
slight of build and of middle size
Pierre thought her age must be about
eighteen

  The old man was grizzled and bent,
and bore the_marks of a hard' life A
trapper of the old days, before there were
sheet-iron stoves, provisions, and goodly
advances from the fur posts, he had
known the meaning of hunger and of
biting cold, the peril of blizzards and
storms on great lakes Now he seemed
to be broken and apparently nearing the
time of farewell to the toil of living

  Matters had to be straightened out as
soon as possible, and for the next hour
Pierre worked like a beaver Neither of
the Indians appeared able to speak, and
he decided that in order to do any good
he would have to get his supplies

  Going to the shore where the moose
lay dead, he found that one leg of the
great animal had gone through the bot-
tom of the canoe that had clung to him
by the spring of the cedar ribs

  A great jagged wound in the paunch
showed the Indian’s shot, while a smaller
one just back of the foreshoulder marked
his own One or two bundles that had
been placed under the cross-pieces were
still in the canoe, and he dragged out a
tent that had been wrapped around a
small sheet-iron stove and some blankets
(with a bundle of traps

  Everything else had evidently fallen
into the river and been washed away
down the rapids and over the falls, or
was being ground to pieces upon the
rocky bottom

  He then ran down the portage, hin-
dered by his wet clothes, and returned,
bearing two of his bags with the tump-
line passed over his forehead

  The first thing to do was to start the
kettle boiling and then he covered the
Indians with his own warm blankets,
hanging their own to dry He managed
to make them swallow some strong tea
and then returned for the rest of his
things, leaving his canoe where he had
thrown it On his return he found that
Paddy had remained near the girl, and
was licking her hand with the nursing
instinct so strongly developed in some
dogs

  Taking the ax, Pierre quickly chopped
down some saplings for pegs and tent-

poles, and soon had the Indians’ tent set
up Once more he went into the woods
and returned with a great load of bal-
sam-boughs, neatly packed 011 the handle
of his ax, and proceeded to make a good
bed

  The old man was groaning at times, in
a low, resigned manner lie was given
another drink of tea, and the young man
then decided that the injured leg mfist be
treated

  He slit down the high moccasin, which
was nearly full of blood, and then cut
through the heavy woolen stocking, and
saw, to his dismay, a sharp piece of bone
protruding through an ugly wound over
the shin This he washed with water
boiled in the kettle

  Pulling hard upon the foot caused the
bone to return within the cut, which he
covered with a linen handkerchief which
he wrung out of the boiling water Then,
after much cogitation, the whole leg was
bound up with ingenious splints, in which
the broken blade of a paddle, some bireh-
bark, and strips torn from a blanket
played a prominent part

  During all thes'e manipulations the old
man had given some signs of suffering
but generally seemed to be apathetic, as
if under the influence of great shock
and as Pierre carefully lifted him and
bore him to the tent, the poor old body
was very limp It took a few minutes to
remove his vtet clothes, and the young
man wrapped him in blankets Then he
turned to the girl

  “ Let me carry you to the tent,” he
said “ You are shivering in this cold
wind”

  But she refused again to let him help,
and rose with difficulty In pain she
pressed both hands to her right side and
entered the tent She glanced at the old
man, now resting quietly, and looked at
Pierre with a shy expression of gratitude

  “ It is good,” she said “ Thanks”

  “ Now let me see what the matter is
with your chest,” he suggested, after she
had lain down

  But she waved him away impatiently,
her cheeks flushing red, and he had to
speak authoritatively, declaring that he
was a doctor This was not quite true,
for he had only a few years before at-
tended one course in medicine at Laval
University
424

THE RAILROAD MAN’S MAGAZINE

  He was sprung from masterful people,
however, and finally gained his way, the
girl faintly defending herself as he pro-
ceeded to remove some of her dripping
clothes

  It took him but a short time to decide
that at least two ribs were broken

  He went out of the tent and began to
dig in one of his bags, from which he
pulled out a little box, in which some
things intended for use in case of emer-
gencies were kept, and took a roll of ad-
hesive-pl aster

  He used it nearly all in a fairly cor-
rect manner, dressing her hurts so that
the movements of the injured side might
be well restrained

  But during this time, with her chest
nearly bare and a red flush upon her
dusky cheeks, the girl, obedient yet full
of revolt, her modesty outraged, feeling
that she was forced to submit, suffering
while realizing that good was being done,
looked at him with great dark eyes, in
which surprise, pain, and resignation
were all shown

  But Pierre did not look at her He
was busy, and to him she was but a suf-
fering thing whose misery he must re-
lieve as soon as possible

  He finished his work, and brought out
a heavy flannel shirt, which he passed
over her head and put on her, and then
his own coat

  “ Try and take off that wet skirt,” he
said, “ and wrap yourself in the blanket
You’re shivering now I must go and look
after that moose”

  He went down to the shore, where the
dead animal was lying partly in the wa-
ter, which made it easier for him to turn
it while skinning, as it was nearly afloat

  He first went to work to remove the
head for preserving, thinking he might be
able to take it back with him for the taxi-
dermist Then, the antlers were very
good, and he estimated that they were
well over fifty inches wide In about a
quarter of an hour he gave the last stroke
that severed the head from the spine
The really important thing was to save
as much of the meat as possible While
he labored with sheath-knife and ax he
pondered over the situation

  Chance had thrown under his care two
poor devils, neither of whom might prob-
ably be able to travel for a long time

Their provisions had evidently all been
lost when the canoe capsized Without
his aid, they would certainly have been ha
an awful predicament, badly hurt, with
their canoe staved in beyond repair, food
all gone, and their gun at the bottom of
the river

  The girl did' not seem lo be in a very
bad condition—she was such a sturdy-
looking little “ savage,” notwithstanding
her apparent slenderness He had no-
ticed that the muscles of her arms and
shoulders were those of an athlete—grace-
ful and strong But, then, this spitting
of blood was annoying Could consump-
tion, as with so many of her doomed race,
have spread its grasping claws upon her 

  With his fragmentary medical knowl-
edge, he managed to recollect that it
might point to an injury of the lung
caused by the sharp edge of one of the
broken ribs This worried him a good
deal, but not as much as the state in
which the old Indian was He had very
grave doubts about that case Compound
fractures were bad enough in themselves,
but the man was so weak, so prostrated,
that surely he must be suffering from
some grave internal injury

  As far as Pierre could see, the problem
before him was to look after them until
they could be left alone—to supply them
with provisions, and get back to Lake
St John as soon as possible and send
them help

  Now it seemed frightfully far away
From the mouth of the river to Tschota-
gama there were fifty miles, then over
two hundred more to where the Peribonca
divided into the Shipsliaw and Manouan
Rivers

  It was several days’ travel up the
former — a wild, rough stream, hardly
ever used by the Indians, since the Ma-
nouan was the direct and easy road to
the Grand Lac Manouan, above which
were the great trapping-grounds The
matter of provisions was the hardest to
solve, and the moose he was now cutting
up would have to be their chief source of
supply

  If the girl grew worse instead of bet-
ter, the problem could hardly be solved
He could not expect to meet any parties
of Indians even after reaching the forks
of the river The trappers who winter in
the upper reaches of the Peribonca1 had

all gone up several weeks before, he had
been informed, and the great river would
be deserted

   All he could do now was to cure moose
meat and smoke fish for them, to assure
their subsistence until assistance could be
procured His own supplies had been
calculated to last eight weeks, of which
four were nearly gone, but with care they
would help a good deal

   So he hacked away at the great carcass,
most of the time up to his knees in water,
and hung great lumps of meat on a pole
under which a poky fire was lighted, to
save them from the attacks of meat-flies
Toiling as never before, for the first time
during his trip he regretted the impa-
tience that had caused him to take this
Tong journey without guides After he
he had finished cutting up the moose he
divided the great pieces in smaller strips,
and built a staging of branches upon
which they were placed, over a great
boucane

  Grimy and wet and smeared with
blood, and soiled with the rotten wood
he kept gathering for his smoke, he la-
bored on, scarcely feeling any fatigue,
knowing that he was now fighting for
lives, and that all that had occurred be-
fore had been tantamount to play

   Several hours passed thus, interrupted
by frequent visits to the tent, and it was
nearly dark before he decided to stop
work, having packed most of the meat
in one of his big water-proof bags He
intended to take it out and smoke it again
on the morrow It would be mighty poor
food, from a civilized standpoint, but
would serve well to sustain life

   He went up to the tent again, glad to
put his hands in his pockets and to suck
away at his pipe, for he felt weary

  “How is everything” he asked

  The old man hardly seemed to notice
him' A queer, vague smile crept over
his features, and one of the hands moved
uncertainly then he relapsed into the
state of indifference which, to the young
man, seemed ominous The girl, with a
certain shy sullenness, said she thought
her father was very ill

   “ I hope he will get over it,” he an-
swered “ He is very old, and it will
take a long time before he is better But
how are you feeling now  How is the
pain in your side”

  The energy of her youth and the im-
passivity of iier race did not permit her
to acknowledge how much she suffered
She said she was all right but her quick,
catchy breathing, and the expression she
could not conceal, belied her words She
seemed to be lying in an uncomfortable
position, and Pierre knelt by her, gently
raising her head, and adjusted the fir-
bouglis with a deft hand She had thrown
some of her wet clothing upon the ground,
and he took it up and hung it to the ridge-
pole to dry

  Supper -was the next thing to be at-
tended to, and the teakettle was soon
hanging over the brisk little fire Pieces
of moose meat were boiling away in the
cooking-pot, and he fried some slices of
bacon

  The dog looked on these proceedings
with much interest, licking his chops and
eying his master patiently, wagging his
stumpy tail, and whining from time to
time A search of the provision-bags re-
vealed a good part of a loaf of bread,
which Pierre had baked in the sand the
day before

  He was crouching by the fire, shading
his face from the heat with one hand,
while he held the stick he had fastened
to the handle of the frying-pan The
girl could see him from where she was
lying, and she wondered

  She believed all that the priests had
told her at Roberval, and knew that they
said that the practises of the Manitou-il-
nos, the sorcerers, were sinful and un-
holy  yet they did wonderful things, and
one had told of the coming of the white
man and the little yellow addom that had
licked her hand

  Who was this strange individual, some
of whose clothing was such as gentlemen
wear sometimes in the woods, and who
had curious cooking things of a silvery
metal she had never seen before, and
speaking, like the doctors and the priests,
in good French, was all alone with his
dog

  She could not make it out It puzzled
her She noticed that when he cut wtjod
he was not very skilful, and that the fire
lie had-made was just a little too big to
cook comfortably by He must have had
people do those things for him, at other
times, like all the gentlemen that came
to that country She noted that he was

strong and tall, and dimly realized that
he had fought like a demon to get her out
of the water He was surely a queer
man with his gentle, pleasant voice, and
his masterful way of ordering one to do
things, and his boyish manner of playing
with the dog

  She sought to rise when he came in
with a dipper of tea, but he made her lie
down again, with just a motion of his
hand She obeyed, and felt bashful at
the idea that a gentleman was waiting on
her She took the hot drink, and some
bread and bacon, and the young man was
pleased to see that she could eat a little
It was a favorable sign

  He also brought food to the old man—
some tea and a cupful of the strong broth
from the moose meat, in which he had
also boiled a little rice from his provision-
bags

  Lured by the insatiable Indian thirst
for tea, the old fellow swallowed some
of the strong infusion, and appeared to
relish it, but would hardly touch the soup
or any of the other things He tried a
few mouthfuls, but shook his head gen-
tly, in a discouraged way, and relapsed
into an apathetic state

  Pierre wondered whether he would like
to smoke, and, having found the Indian’s
pipe in the pocket of the wet coat he had
removed from him offered him tobacco
The old fellow accepted it and puffed
away when Pierre held a lighted match
for him, but after a few whiffs the pipe
fell from his mouth unnoticed

  “ The poor old chap must be mighty
ill,” thought Pierre, who, like every one
else, had never seen a live Indian unable
to smoke

  He sat down near them in the tent,
while Paddy, at his feet, watched eagerly
for bits thrown at him from time to time
The young man was hungry as a wolf,
and attacked his food almost as raven-
ously

  While eating he began to question her

  “What is your name ” he asked in
French

  “ Ou-memeou, she answered “ But,
no—it is Anne Marie, I was baptized”

  “ What does Ou-memeou mean  ”

  “ It is the little gray dove, not like
Wab-memeou the pigeon I am his
daughter,” and she pointed to the old
man

  “ You were going back to Lac St
Jean ”

  She nodded affirmatively

  “Where were you coming from”

  “ From camp, far north, beyond Grand
Lac Manouan”

  “ Why did you come dowm the Ship-
shaw instead of the Manouan  ”

  She did not answer, at first, and fin-
ally said it was nearer to their hunting-
ground But somehow he realized that
she did not want to tell him the real
reason, and went on with his questions

  “ I suppose you drifted down on the
big moose, suddenly, near the bank, and
your father shot quick, and he jumped
on you and upset the boat, eh”

  Again she assented with a movement of
her head

  “ Tell me, how- long have you been
spitting blood  ”

  She looked astonished, and shook her
head again

  “ I do not spit blood,” she asserted

  “ But this morning! ”

  “Yes,” she answered, and, averting
her lower lip, showed him that it had
been cut and bruised against her fine
white teeth Fie felt very glad that his
fears were proyen groundless, for it
simplified matters a good deal

  If she was not consumptive and had
received no serious injury to her lungs
she would soon be well again and able
to care for her father He sought to
recollect how long broken ribs might
take to mend, but his memory on that
point was hazy, and he could only con-
clude that it might take a couple of
weeks or more

  In the semidarkness, Pierre put up
his own little silk tent close to the
larger one and cut up enough wood to
last over night Finding that there was
nothing more that he could do for the
two Indians he called the dog, that was
lying down near Anne Marie, and made
ready to enjoy a needed rest

  As the terrier snuggled beside him
Pierre looked at him, by the fitful light
of the camp fire outside the tent, as he
had left the flap wide open, and spoke
to him:

  “ You’ve taken a fancy to that little
savage, Paddy boy”

  The dog wagged his tail

  Tired though he was, Paddy’s master

tossed about under his blanket for a long
time Suddenly, with a voice full of
conviction and marked with a certain
bitterness he uttered a sentence which,
considering certain fairly recent happen-
ings, was not without a certain tincture
of philosophy

  “ The deuce take women! ” was his re-
mark

CHAPTER II

The Blood in His Veins

T> EFORE falling asleep Pierre’s
thoughts wandered back to lands
still farther north and to that ancestor
of his, Farquhar Ferguson, beyond
whom the family knew none of its fore-
bears

  This first Ferguson was a dour Pres-
byterian who had wandered to Canada
in the trail of the fighters who con-
quered the country for England After
some years of hard knocks he married,
somewhere north of Winnipeg, an In-
dian girl who bore 'him a family of four,
and made a good wife to him until he
was blotted out from among men in a
great blizzard

  The inheritence he left consisted in a
couple of guns, a fine lot of traps, a
tent, and the wages due by the Hudson
Bay Company, for whom he ran a small
post in the wilderness

  This wealth made the woman a desir-
able person, and she succumbed to the
attractions of a warrior of her tribe, who
took in her wealth and her family, know-
ing that the latter would not long prove
troublesome

  The oldest child was a girl, who soon
disappeared with a Cree Indian, but the
other three, all sons, wandered away
over various trails, and the further fate
of one only was known, who took to wife
a -white woman of mixed Irish and
French - Canadian descent His exist-
ence ended at the breaking of a log jam
on the St Maurice and his family scat-
tered over the land

  It was ,known that one of his sons
went to sea and was never heard of
again, and that another was concerned in
the Riel rebellion and had later disap-
peared after writing once from British
Columbia

  Two daughters married farmers and
were still living, while a third had be-
come a nun The youngest son was
Pierre’s father Unlike others of his
family he had had but two children, of
whom one died in Montreal the year of
the great smallpox epidemic Pierre,
left an only child, became as the apple
of his parents’ eyes

  The father had returned from a long
journey in the Far West with much gold,
which he increased and multiplied in
trade, for he 'had the faculty of smelling
out money, just as a mink smells musk-
rats or fish

  The young man tried for a profession
Medicine was his- first choice, but he
gave it up after a year in favor of min-
ing engineering, and left this to help
his father in his business ventures, for
which he also showed a keen nose From
an aunt on the mother’s side he obtained
an inheritance and bought interests in a
pulp-mill, and then in a gold mine in
Nova Scotia, which chanced to pay good
dividends,and in a fishing venture of
Labrador

  Notwithstanding all this, he had con-
siderable leisure which he spent, with an
instinct that was probably an atavistic
inheritance from the dusky wife of Far-
quhar, in the woods, where he hunted
and fished, and enjoyed the sensation of
being drawn toward the North, toward
the wild freedom that was to him like a
better, purer breath of life

  This particular trip had been taken
for two reasons, of which the least was
the fact that he had heard something
about a proposed railroad 'to James Bay,
in Hudson Bay, and that it would proba-
bly pass over a certain river

  Now this stream fell in the Shipshaw,
a good day’s journey above the point
he had reached An old Indian who had
traveled there had described to him, a
few years before, something that must
have been a very mountain of asbestos
It was Avorth while looking into, since,
if the railroad line passed near it, it
might acquire great value

  But the chief reason was that he had
met with a disappointment, and at the
time felt so hurt and angry that he had
run away to the woods for consolation

  His pride had been wounded, for he
was young, and no cynic
428

THE RAILROAD MAN’S MAGAZINE

   The trouble was all over a young lady

  Some days at Cacouna, and others
during which he followed her to Tadou-
sac and idled with her a golden week or
two, had sufficed to give him the im-
pression that he was madly in love with
her A florid and somewhat vulgar ma-
ma, and a father who, considered in the
light of an efficient provider, but other-
wise wholly insignificant, house-broken,
and subject to every whim of his fat
spouse and slender blond daughter, did
not affect her charms

  She was certainly attractive, and
flirted as she breathed, naturally and
efficiently

   As the halcyon days floated by, Pierre
had become certain that he could not
live without her and that he was going to
propose This is a serious matter to a
youth who means what he says and be-
lieves in the everlastingness of love

   But just before he reached a final de-
cision, a white steam-yacht turned up the
St Lawrence and anchored at the foot
of the little cliffs at Tadousac, right at
the beautiful mouth of the Saguenay It
bore a splendid-looking youth with much
money and a very fetching manner, who
was introduced by mutual friends, where-
upon Pierre felt himself rather neglected

  This had lasted but a day or two be-
fore Pierre, feeling that insensibly his
goddess was slipping away from him, de-
cided to cut the Gordian knot at once,
and proposed on the veranda of the
hotel, one line moonlit night, while the
yachtsman was indoors playing billiards

   In justice to the young lady it should
be said that she had never meant to en-
gage in anything but a most innocent
flirtation with a very pleasant young
man, and felt rather sorry for him She
was very gentle and kind, in the sweet-
est possible way, manifested a sisterly in-
terest in his future welfare, and made
him feel, perhaps mistakenly, that the
steam - yacht, or its owner, were para-
mount in her thoughts

  Men take such happenings in many
ways, and Pierre suffered from a sense
of humiliation that was at first quite
intolerable He wondered whether
there might be about him something un-
couth, a remnant left by the slight ad-
mixture of Indian blood in his veins,
that made him undesirable as a mate

for so intensely civilized and worldly a
young woman

  It did not take him long to decide
that this was probably not the case, and
that he had simply been beaten in a com-
petition for a prize by a man better fit-
ted for that particular contest He did
not dream of the probable truth, which
was that Miss Fanny was really in love
with no one at all, and simply sought
to have as good a time as possible

  Pierre left on the steamboat for Que-
bec, told his people he was off for Lake
St John, and gathered up his camping
things and started on a trip he had
planned a year before

  The journey did him much good
There was comfort in the discovery he
gradually and reluctantly made, that he
was not really wounded very deeply In
fact it took but a few days before he
began to feel conscious that the whole
affair might be one of those happenings
that leave behind them a sense of having
made a rather lucky escape

  Strong and self-reliant, thinking he
knew what he wanted, he had been too
busy to become much of a man of the
world, and it was with some surprise
that the feeling came that, after all, the
whole thing might have been a false
alarm, the awakening in him of the de-
sire for loving companionship, but not a
disaster that could lead to the shatter-
ing of an existence

  For some hours he slept deeply, and
then awoke suddenly with every sense
alert, as happens to the wild things of
the woodlands and to the men whom the
wilderness has called

  His last dream had mingled with the
sound of voices, and in the tent near by
could be heard a low muttering, a slow
pouring out of indistinct words, that, at
rare intervals, were interrupted by the
softer voice of the girl

   Pierre felt chilly, the fire outside the
tent had gone out, and one of his blan-
kets had been given to the old man He
rose and decided to make more fire It
was very dark Great somber clouds
drifted heavily overhead, and tlie noise
of the rapids came in a low, booming
sound, interrupted from time to time by
the song of the night wind blowing
through the jagged tops of the North-
land trees
A HEART OF THE NORTH

429

  The flap of the larger tent was opened,
and Pierre went in In the darkness,
nothing could be made out but the two
indistinct forms lying upon the ground,
and he spoke in a low voice

  “What is the matter Is your father
worse”

  “ He began to speak some time ago, and
says many things I do not always under-
stand, and I fear he is very ill,” an-
swered the girl

  The young man went back to his tent
and found one -©f the few remaining
candles, which he brought to the large
tent and lighted

  He knelt by the old man, whose eyes
followed the flickering light for a mo-
ment But he soon paid no further heed
to it and began again, in a low voice
that seemed to reflect all the sadness of
the wilderness, to mutter things that
were unintelligible toPierre

  “What is he saying” he asked

  The girl listened for a moment and
said with accents that had tears in
them:

  “ He says that the month of the fall-
ing leaves, Uasteshiau Pushum, is com-
ing, and we must not stay long here He
says the morning will be here soon, and
I must boil gum and seal oil to mend the
canoe Also,- he says, he feels a sick-
ness and is not well, and will not be
able to carry a heavy pack to-day, and
we mjist start early”

  Pierre lifted the candle until the
light fell upon the girl’s face The lids
were not quivering over the great dark
eyes, and all the features were calm
But great tears were coursing down her
cheeks, and she was stricken hard, and
bearing it like a brave, strong soul

  He felt that her sorrow was touching,
and that her heart was speaking the
things which she could not have put in
words

  Looking again at the old man he was
shocked to see how great a change had
occurred within a short time The mut-
tered words issuing from his lips came
faintly, yet witih a certain quiet, con-
fident expression, that showed how far
away he was wandering through bygone
events of a long, hard life, and stumb-
ling through a mental darkness that
was' mercifully hiding from him the
nearing end

  Placing his hand upon the old man’s
forehead, which he expected to find
warm, it was a surprise to feel it very
cold and clammy

  Remembering a pint flask of brandy
at the bottom of one of his packs, and
thinking it might prove useful, he
dragged the heavy bag within the tent
and gave the candle to Anne Marie to
hold, while he rummaged until he found
what he wanted

  Pouring some of the liquor in a tin
cup, he lifted the old man’s head gently,
and bade him drink The sufferer did
not seem to understand at first, but fin-
ally Pierre made him swallow it

  Under the influence of the strong
draft, the old Indian 'seemed to revive a
little He looked at Pierre and then at
his daughter, shaking his head gently
Their faces were illumined by the can-
dlelight, and he appeared to consider
them with some surprise, but the vacant
look soon returned and, giving a long
sigh, his head sank down once more, and
he appeared to fall quietly asleep

  Anne Marie looked at Pierre with shy
gratitude Surely this must be a good
man who was so gentle with her old
father, and she wondered again what he
might be, and how he chanced to be
alone so far up the great river

  In some way Pierre realized that the
girl would not sleep, and felt so thor-
oughly awakened that he did not think
it best to lie down again Pie lit his
pipe and sat down beside her in silence,
having'blown out the valuable candle,
but the chill of the night struck through
him and brought a shiver

  The little cast-iron stove he had ta-
ken from the wrecked canoe was near,
with several lengths of stovepipe packed
within it, and in a few moments it was
rigged up in the tent After bringing in
an armful of wood, a good fire was soon
roaring, and it was pleasant to see the
little flashes of red light showing through
the cracks

  He rapped his pipe on the heel of his
boot, put it again in his pocket, and sat
down on his bag, near the girl

  “How long have you been awake”
he asked

  “ A long time I think I have not
slept,” she answered

  “ Much pain ”
430

THE RAILROAD MAN’S MAGAZINE

   Some pain, not very much But! am
afraid I am much afraid”

  She shook her head and looked in the
direction of her father Pierre tried to
reassure her but somehow words of com-
fort would not come The fact could not
be hidden that he also feared that the old
man's life was fast ebbing away It was
hardly possible to deceive her, and the few
things he managed to say were unable to
bring any change in the tense look of her
eyes

  “ You must try to sleep,” he advised

  But she shook her head, and he did not
insist: and they remained in silence with-
in the tent, listening to the occasional
words spoken by the old man, who had
fallen asleep, but frequently seemed to
be dreaming aloud

  From time to time Pierre opened the
little stove to put in more wood, and a
red glare would become disseminated
throughout the tent, to die out abruptly
when the door was closed

  Without, there was the great silence of
the wilderness, that is always accentuated
by little interruptions The familiar
sounds of the nighf life that never ceases
to pulsate recurred at intervals: the
splashes of fish leaping on the water, the
intermittent distant hoots of a great
horned owl, the rising and dying of the
breeze, the ill-defined scratching sounds
on the gravel and sand of the tiny beach,
where muskrats were at play

  All these, whenever they ceased, seemed
to render yet more profound the great
stillness that, like some weird cover,
wrapped the world up in its folds

  Within the tent there was but the sound
of the old man’s breathing, and of his
occasional words, uttered in a very low
voice, full of an inexpressible patience
and sadness, as of one who bore quietly
some great ill inseparable from the hard
life of the dwellers in the waste places

  Some hours passed thus, and the girl
felt comforted by the presence of the
young man With the blind trust she was
beginning to repose in him as a white man
possessed of all manner of knowledge that
was hidden from her, she felt as if he
might, by the mere fact of being there,
prevent the dreadful calamity she feared

  Was he not of the same race as the
Oblate Fathers who had taught her to
read, as the nuns whose very dress seemed

redolent of mysterious things, as the doc-
tors that had power over death and evil,
as the rich men who owned the sawmills
and the great hotel  What might' he not
accomplish 

  Pierre rose several limes during the
long vigil Once or twice he gave the old
man another sip from the flask, and re-
plenished the little stove, that burned the
wood up very fast But when the first
faint light began to be distinct, even
through the canvas of the tent, and while
still sitting up, with knees drawn up to
his chin that was resting upon his folded
hands, he fell asleep, and remained in
that position for a long time, until the
sunlight showed high above the serrated
edge of the woods in the east

  When he awoke with a start the fire in
the little stove had burned itself out, and
rhe girl was still watching, lying upon
her injured side, her keen eyes resting
upon the old man, who still seemed to
sleep quietly under the blankets

  “Are you cold” asked Pierre “I
have slept why did you not awaken me”

  She shook her head vaguely, and Pierre
saw that all her thoughts were for her
father He did not know that as long as
he was there the girl was satisfied, since
she could call him in case of need, and
that she would not have awakened him
otherwise  for the sleep of a man, in camp
as on shipboard, is a sacred thing, not to
be interrupted except for good cause

  Pierre rose with a yawn, but in a few
moments was very wide-awake and
splashing mightily in the water by the
shore, with a cake of soap and a towel ly-
ing upon the bottom of his upturned
canoe, his shirt-collar drawn down and
opened, exposing part of his great chest
The sleeves of his flannel shirt were pulled
up as far as they would go, leaving his
white, sinewy arms showing in contrast
to the brown face and hands he was scrub-
bing hard

  This over, he took up the ax and, go-
ing a little way back in the wood, began
to smite lustily, and soon had enough logs
for a good fire outside of the big tent,
upon which he put the kettle to boil,
hanging from a stick driven slanting into
the ground

  “What do you think you could eat”
he called to the girl, who was watching
him from the tent
A HEART OF THE NORTH

431

  “ I am not very hungry,” she replied
“ If you would let me, I might be able
to cook for you It is the woman’s place

   “ You just keep still until I let you get
up,” he answered cheerily “ I’m the cook
and everything else until your ribs get
mended”

  He took great interest in the breakfast,
which would be later than usual, owing
to that last nap, and often spoke to the
dog, who was looking on wistfully and
whining with impatience, while his mas-
ter was sitting upon a big log, holding
the long stick he had stuck in the hollow
handle of the sputtering frying-pan

  “Look at the dog!” suddenly ex-
claimed the girl, upon whose face a
strange look of fear had come

  Paddy’s hair was bristling, and he ut-
tered a low growl as he dashed along the
faintly marked path that led over the
portage

  He stopped as a tall man made his ap-
pearance The man was loaded with a
heavy pack, and walked carefully over
the rocks, the great muscles at the sides
of his neck bulging with the pull of the
tump - line that held up two hundred-
pound bags of flour Both hands were up
over his shoulders, grasping the straps
and relieving a bit the drag upon his neck

  With the slightest possible motion of
his head in Pierre’s direction, he kept on
toward the landing-place, where he put
down his bags with an action of relief, and
quietly pulled out his pipe for a smoke
while swiftly observing the wreck of the
canoe, the marks of the moose-skinning,
and the scaffolding erected for smoking
the meat

  Then he slowly came up to the camp-
fire, addressing Pierre, who had left his
seat in the tent and stood before it, with
the customary salute of the Montagnais:

  “ Quey, quey”

CHAPTER III

The Girl Sees a Fight

TJIERRE repeated the greeting, at the_
same time handing a plug of to-'
bacco to the newcomer, who pulled his
slieath-knife from his belt and proceeded
to cut a pipeful

  This done, the man held a bit of birch-
bark to the fire and got a light, squatting

011 the long end of the backlog, after re-
turning the plug His complexion showed
him to be a metis (a half-breed) He
was a man of great size and strength, with
a low forehead and a taciturn, sullen ex-
pression

   Nothing was said for a long time, while
Pierre went on with his cooking, and the
newcomer took note of the surroundings
The flap of the big tent was down, and he
could not see its interior But the wreck
of the canoe, the various articles scattered
around, one or two familiar spots upon
the tent, taught him a great deal, and
finally he grunted, inquisitively, in
F rench:

  “Old Michel”

   Pierre only then recollected that he had
not asked the old man’s name, but an-
swered that an old Indian was within the
tent, and that he did not know whether
or not he was called Michel

  The half-breed looked at him suspi-
ciously, and spoke again:

  “Anne Marie”

  “ Yes,” answered Pierre “ Anne
Marie and her old father They have
both been badly hurt”

  He went on, unbidden, to give a brief
account of the happenings of the day be-
fore, to which the half-breed listened in
silence, only grunting once or twice dur-
ing the recital

  Finally rising and pulling aside the
tent flap, the half-breed went in, and
Pierre felt that a big load had been taken
off his shoulders, for the newcomer evi-
dently knew these people, and would
probably be able to help him out

  There was 110 doubt that he would be
willing to remain there while the pro-
jected visit to the asbestos-mine was ac-
complished, a matter of but few days

  Then Pierre could take the girl back
to Lake St John or, better still, the half-
breed could be hired, to do it There was
also a possibility that Anne Marie might
have friends or relatives trapping some-
where in the North, and that she might
elect to go there The old man, unfor-
tunately, played no part in these plans, for
it was too evident that his journey was
nearly ended

   Pierre’s reflections were interrupted by
an exclamation from Anne Marie, and he
put down his frying-pan to find out what
was the matter
432

THE RAILROAD MAN’S MAGAZINE

  He was surprised to hear her talking
excitedly and angrily, while the old man
paid no heed to what was going on around
him The external world seemed to have
disappeared from his ken, as with slow,
nearly rhythmical motions he kept  on
picking at the blanket that covered him

  The features, in the brighter light of
the morning, showed an even more drawn
and pinched expression than on the day
before

  The half-breed was listening to the girl
with a careless, contemptuous expression,
and now and then grunted some reply in
the Montagnais dialect Paddy began to
bark again, and Pierre looked out of the
tent

  Down the path another man was com-
ing, bearing a canoe poised on his head
with the tump-line, while in one hand he
carried a goodly bundle of traps Like
the half-breed, he went on to the landing-
place and rid himself of his load with a
grunt of satisfaction before coming up to
the tent From his darker skin and pure
Indian features, he was probably a Mon-
tagnais, or perhaps a TSte de Boue ' He
nodded to Pierre and looked in the tent,
saying something in his Indian speech

  Anne Marie uttered a low moan

  “ What the deuce are they bothering
that girl about” Pierre asked himself
impatiently lie had taken an instinctive
dislike to the two men, especially the
first, and entering the tent, which began
to be rather crowded, inquired what was
the matter

  At first the girl did not answer She
had partly risen, in a sitting position,
and was looking steadily at -her old
father, who was still monotonously pick-
ing away at the blanket, interrupting this
now and then with slow rotations of his
head, the eyes seeming to follow flying
things visible to' him alone

  “ This man, the savage,” she finally
answered, without looking up at him,
“ says that he once saw an old man who
did these things just like my father, and
he lived but a very short time” She
crossed herself and spoke again “ I fear
much it is a sign of death”

  Pierre’s head bent down, and he made
no reply, for he had during the long
night decided that the end must be very
near Going out to look after his cook-
ing, he again held the frying-pan over

the fire for a few moments, and then
poured out some tea which he brought
to the girl, with food, on one of his alumi-
num plates

  He felt that he must ask the others
whether they would eat Th«y had un-
doubtedly broken their fast earlier in the
morning, but Indian-like, would forego
no opportunity to feed The three sat
down outside the tent and consumed vast
quantities of tea with flapjacks and fried
pork

  Pierre had meant to speak to them
about such arrangements as could be
made to care for the girl, but instinctive-
ly felt that something was wrong that
their presence was distasteful tb her, and
he decided to consult with her first, as
soon as opportunity allowed

  The fact was clear that the half-breed
was an obnoxious individual Anne
Marie had spoken angrily, and he felt
that he was cultivating an intense dislike
to him

  The Indian was but an ordinary speci-
men of his race, strong, short of stature,
with an impassive countenance, from
which nothing particular could be made
out

  After they saw that there was nothing
more to eat, the two men rose, said they
were going back over the portage for the
remainder of their things and soon de-
parted, pulling away at their pipes and
swinging their tump-lines in their hands,
while Paddy sniffed at their heels sus-
piciously

  As soon as they had disappeared,
Pierre went to the tent He wanted an
explanation, and it was soon forthcom-
ing

  “ Come quick! ” Anne Marie ex-
claimed as soon as she saw him “ Have
they gone ”

  She was standing On her cheeks
there burned dusky red spots, and her
black eyes were flashing She seemed to
be in a passion of excitement, and was
trying to subdue it The hand that was
not pressed against her injured side was
clenched tightly, and moved tremulously

  “What are you going to do” she
asked eagerly “ Are you going to leave
now”

  “ Well, I’m sure I don’t know,” he re-
plied “ I had thought of giving them
money to take you back to Lac St Jean,
A HEART OF THE NORTH

433

or- perhaps you would like to go north
again with them Where are they going
now  ”

  “ Back to the place we came from  ”
she replied quickly “ But I won’t go
with them, either to the south or to the
north I hate them The half - breed
wants me for his wife! I would kill him
first, and, if I could not do that, 1 would
rather kill myself! ”

  She had grown still more excited as
she was speaking Her lips were trem-
bling

  Pierre placed his hand gently on her
shoulder

  “ Lie down again, Anne Marie,” he
said “ You may injure yourself with all
that excitement You shall do just as
you please If you won’t go with them,
there is plenty of room in my canoe, and
I will take you back to Lac St Tean
after—”

  He interrupted himself suddenly, but
she took up his words

  “ After my poor old father, is dead
Yes, I know he cannot live I will go
back with you, if you will be so good—
but how can I  The half-breed will not
let me”

  “ I don’t see how he can prevent you,”
exclaimed Pierre “ You say he wants

(To be c

to marry you, and that you hate him
He can’t marry you against your will
Do you mean that there’s going to be a
fight”

  The young man was beginning to feel
rather belligerent He disliked the half-
breed’s looks, and sympathized with the
girl's feelings sufficiently to make him
ready to take her part

  “A fight!” she exclaimed “Yes, he
would fight, but he would rather do some
treacherous thing! I don’t know what
he will do”

  Exhausted by the excitement, the girl
sank down again upon the blanket under
which she had been lying, and looked at
Pierre as if hoping that he could suggest
some way out of the trouble He stood
there, wondering what kind of a mess he
was getting into

  “ Tell me all about it,” he suggested
“ I can’t help you until I know what the
row is about”	,

  “ Yes, I will tell you Sit down just
outside the tent so that you may watch
the portage and see when they return
He is very suspicious He must not see
us talking too much I am afraid he will
do you harm He will do nothing while
my old father is living, but afterward—
who knows ”

A New Freight
Giant

The Heaviest and Most Powerful Loco-
motive of Its Type, for Use on
the Santa Fe	-s_

THE Baldwin Locomotive Works recently sup-
plied the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Rail-
way with two passenger and two freight locomotives,
which are the heaviest engines thus far built for their
respective classes of service While differing greatly
in their proportions, the two designs are alike in
principle, and have many features in common

   The engines belong to what is known as the Mallet
articulated type, first introduced abroad, in the year
1889, by M Anatole Mallet, a noted French engineer
In the Mallet locomotive, the driving-wheels are
divided into two groups, and there are four cylin-
ders, two of- which drive the rear group of wheels,
while the remaining two drive the forward group
The cylinders are arranged on the compound sys-
tem : that is the steam is first used in the rear, or
high-pressure cylinders, and is then passed through
the front, or low-pressure cylinders, after which it
escapes up the stack in the usual manner

  This arrangement provides a locomotive with a
large amount of weight on the driving-wheels, but
the wheel-base, or distance between the front and
back wheels, is necessarily Jong Therefore, to en-
able the locomotive to traverse curves easily, the
front frames are pivoted to the rear frames

   Tlie forward group of wheels is thus able to swing
laterally, and the engine traverses sharp curves as
easily as a locomotive of the ordinary type

  Locomotive No 1700 (shown in the illustration)
has driving-wheels 63 inches in diameter, and weighs,
without its tender, 462450 pounds This is the
heaviest engine thus far built for any railway, and
its total • weight, including the tender, is approxi-
mately 350 tons

  The tenders of both locomotives are similar, and
are of exceptional size Each is carried on two six-
wheeled trucks, and has capacity for 12,000 gallons
of water and 4000 gallons of fuel-oil

  The boiler is 7 feet in diameter, works under a
pressure of 220 pounds, and has a total heating sur-
face including the feed-water heater, of 6,631 square
feet There are also 1,745 square feet of superheat-
ing and reheating surface

  There are two high-pressure cylinders 26 inches
in diameter by 34-inch stroke, connected to eight
coupled drivers, 63 inches in diameter, and two low-
pressure cylinders, 38 inches in diameter by 34-inch
stroke, connected to eight coupled 63-inch drivers
The pull on the draw-bar maximum power is 54 tons

   It is 110 exaggeration to say that these locomo-
tives mark a new era in American locomotive prac-
tise And we beg the reader to turn to the article,
“ Progress in Locomotive Building,” in this issue,
in which this great subject is treated at length

 THE STOLEN TEN THOUSAND

BY D C FREEMAN

               What Happened on the Night That Denver
               Joe Made a Haul in No 47, the Hoodoo

of the despatcher’s office at
the barns came Shorty Saun-
ders, looking so sour that
they all smiled at him Half
a dozen of the boys who were
just taking out their cars for
the rush hours greeted Shorty with vary-
ing expressions of cheer He had just
been removed from the waiting-list fol-
lowing a long, enforced lay-off imposed
by the superintendent for a slip of duty'

  ' “ Well, Shorty,” they cried, “ you’re
1 on again, off again,’ eh  What’s the
luck Guess you won’t be getting any
more ‘ oversleeps ’ for a while”

  Shorty glumly shook his head “ That
chump’s sure got it in for me,” he burst
out “ He’s given me the hoodoo for the
owl hours on Thirteenth Street I call
that tough on a man who’s had to stand a
lay-off, and the kid and the missus both
sick”

  “ Oh, well, Shorty, you know the best
of men have to go on the carpet now and
then Did they hand you a hard bunch  ”
“ So-so Old man said I took too many
chances I told him, as they hadn’t put
air-brakes on 47, the okl hoodoo would
get into a smash-up that would cost some-
thing before they threw her out Hanged
old trap! I wish she’d go over the bridge

into the river some night You wouldn’t
see me on her if it wasn't a case of hav-
ing to”

   Peters and Williams started to pull out
“ So long,” they cried at the doleful mo-
torman “ Keep an extra bucket of sand
aboard, and watch her on the crossings—
maybe she won’t be your funeral yet”

  Car 47 was in bad repute with all em-
ployees of the C and S Every man in
the service was familiar with her seeming
inanimate devilishness, and they strongly
disliked to have anything to do with her

  The feeling was shared from Bozzon,
the big Boer boss of the barns, up to the
office of General Manager Phillips Her
career was marked by pranks—destruc-
tive, expensive, and unaccountable In the
office of the general manager, the offenses
of the “ queered ” car had brought things
to such a pass that whenever 47 appeared
in the reports it meant a wreck

  Her reputation for mishaps, and for
hurting her motormen and conductors,
too, dated back to the days of the single-
truckers and the old rheostat With the
passing of the bobtails came the exten-
sion of the urban lines fifteen miles into
the country, and 47 was one of the first
double-truckers, but there always seemed
to be some misfit about her

435

which one of us is the guilty party1'
436

THE RAILROAD MAN’S MAGAZINE

  She celebrated her initial run on the
new double-tracked balloon route by
bumping into a damage suit in which the
company was bumped for seven thousand
dollars The complainant was a pedler
of sauerkraut and home-made vinegar,
pity for whose condition and calling and
racked constitution led the jury to render
a verdict which jarred the company con-
siderably

  In that instance the motor controller
got stuck, and could not be shut off in
time to prevent the collision

  With all her misfortunes, 47 bore a
charmed existence, even passing through a
big fire practically unscathed, while many
modern new cars were destroyed

   I n the press of business and shortage of
cars 47 had to be brought out for extra
duty

  One Friday—it was the thirteenth day
of June—47 unaccountably got the bit in
her teeth and ran away with a new motor-
man She dashed down the steep grade erf
Sycamore Street like an arrow from a bow

   At the foot of the hill there was a sharp
curve A block straight beyond this curve,
and below a forty-foot embankment, rip-
ples the river Car 47 cut a swath
through Widow Maloney’s garden, de-
molished the fences, and—stopped on the
very edge of the bank, amid a shower
of dirt, broken glass, and twisty splinters

  Chris Knudson, a giant in stature, held
the brakes until the brass handle was bent
He was the last man taken out powerless
to utter a word, and fit after that for only
flagman’s duty

  After that, 47 went into retirement but
when the demand for cars was strong
again, forth came she in fresh paint, and
with the marks of her last trouble cov-
ered up They did not think, however, to
change the number

  The repairers readjusted the trucks and
installed a motor that would roll her along
at eighteen miles an hour She toted her
thirty dollars a day’s worth of human
traffic for a month Then she left the
track and destroyed Popcorn Jimmy’s lit-
tle mint near the ball-park, for which the
company paid roundly

  John Nancy was sent out with 47 and
a trailer with a picnic crowd, and the hoo-
doo scared a hundred people into teetotal-
ism on the way home bv trying to peal
through the span braces of the bridge

Nancy declared his ultimatum He had
worked a controller for fifteen years, and
he said if he was ordered out with 47
again he’d quit the service and go to
ranching it

  Shorty Saunders wished from the bot-
tom of his heart that he could likewise
have asserted his independence But he
could not Through no particular fault
of his own, he had been in some little
trouble  he had had to suffer the penalty
of a long lay-off, while at home there was
an instalment indebtedness doubling up
on him, and the missus and the kid both
sick for a time

  Shorty felt that Skinner should have
given him a decent run, along with the
other old men of the service Shorty was
ambitious, and wished to rise to the dig-
nity of a place upon one of the elegant
new coaches of Pullman pattern with a
long run, automatic brakes, compressed-
air-whistling apparatus, and everything
else to make the life of the man on the
front end ideal	_

  Life on the vestibuled suburban ap-
peared to Shorty to be one unalloyed
dream of delight There was better pay
in it overtime Was profitable, and there
was less danger of collision than in the
down-town district To be set back
twisting the old-fashioned ratchet-brake
on a dead little cross-town stub branch
was heart-breaking

  Although Saunders remonstrated gen-
tly to Superintendent Skinner, and repre-
sented that he was entitled to better de-
serts having served three years, the super
was not impressed

   “ You’ve got no kick,” the cold-blood-
ed Skinner growled “ We’ve given you
a nine-hour run, and it’s dead easy I
can't give everybody a new car I want
to see if you can keep 47 on the track un-
til we can get 114 out of the shops Then
I’ll see Take the run, or leave it! The
waiting-list’s full! ”

express, which should reach the city at

Although he had a journey of less than
fifty miles to make on that train on that
Saturday afternoon, great odds depended
upon his being on time

  Accordingly, as Bennet was more than
anxious for a wind-up of the negotiations,
he drew twelve thousand dollars from the
office and decided he would personally
bring the funds to the city He did not
relish the task of carrying this sum with

broad daylight on the afternoon express,
and as he would be 011 the train a matter
of fifty-five minutes, lie reasoned that
there were few chances to take

Late trains invariably get to be later
before they arrive Mr Bennet fumed
abuse upon the railway company as time
wore 011 and the hour of his appointment
slipped by

  Ten thousand dollars of the sum he
carried was wrapped up in a neat, com-
pact package of fresh currency, enclosed
in a leather case by rubber bands It
reposed in a secret pocket of Mr Ben-
net’s light top-coat

  A big timber deal, which had been

company’s counsel, had rounded up a
bunch of squatters, and had shrewdly per-

close to six when the train rolled into the
terminal yards The lumber syndicate
president irritably answered the remarks
of the conductor as he was preparing to
leave the car He pulled from his pocket
a yellow slip of paper, and read several
times the lawyer’s message: “Must have
the cash by half past four to-day”

At the same instant that Mr Bennet
read the single line, a pair of lynx eyes,

to assure himself it was there, pushed his
way more aggressively than the rest

  Denver Joe was close upon him In the
crush, the crook was shoved plumb against
the hurrying magnate, wWjse coat became
unfastened As they jostled along—Ben-
net being too preoccupied to take note—
one lapel was deftly jerked aside, and
Denver Joe located the treasure his in-
stincts told him was there

just behind him, took in the words The
inquisitive optics belonged to a low-
browed young man with villainous phys-
iognomy

  The uncautious Bennet never dreamed
that an accomplished pickpocket and
house-breaker was a fellow passenger in
the smoking-compartment

  Denver Joe’s lynx eyes took in the pos-
sible meaning of the yellow slip of paper
of the prosperous-looking party before
him All his “ professional instincts ”
were at once aroused He soon made up
his mind that the old gentleman was nerv-
ous about the “ cash ” mentioned in the
despatch

  Scarcely had Mr Bennet reached the
door of the coach before the Denver crook
had located the exact whereabouts of the
money

  Through the corridors of the station
two buffeting streams of passengers
flowed aggressively along Mr Bennet,
pressing his precious package to his breast

  They emerged upon the plaza As his
besetting luck would have it, not one un-
engaged cab was in sight, and Bennet
cursed

  Just then car 47, on her way down-town
from the barns to take her Thirteenth
Street night run, with Shorty Saunders at
the controller and an extra man, stopped
at the plaza intersection Impatient trav-
elers menacingly shook luggage and um-
brellas at her The crowd clambered
aboard  the conductor rang the gong and
coached them all to move lively

  In the confusion, a woman dropped her
purse There was more confusion as the
woman grew excited, and as craning necks
and bumping craniums came together in
the general endeavor to assist her Den-
ver Joe gallantly helped the affrighted
woman His hat was pulled low, and his
eves were flashing brightly In the midst
of the general jostling into seats, Mr
Bennet felt somebody butt into him and
turned to murmur “ Excuse me! ” to no-

body in particular Then one lightning
flash of the wrist did the business Den-
ver Joe’s hand covered the wallet In an
instant it was transferred from Bennet’s
coat to his sleeve Rapidly he moved
forward to place several passengers be-
tween himself and Bennet

  The car traversed a block, and Joe tried
the front door—it was latched from the
motorman’s side!

  If he could slip out by the front plat-
form and drop off—that would be easy
But to get out and away from the, car
without attracting general attention by
getting out at that Critical juncture—that
was not easy

  Saunders noticed some one on the in-
side wanted to leave the car He mo-
tioned: “ Back platform”

  Then Denver Joe cast his eyes through
the aisle and estimated his chance of
escape

  A man leaned over and spoke to Mr
Bennet

  Two seconds later, the crook noticed
that the lumber magnate passed his hand
into the side-pocket of his coat—the wal-
let was gone!

  Mr Bennet half rose ffom his seat,
gasping!

  Instantly, every eye was turned curious-
ly upon him He clutched himself con-
vulsively at various places about his
clothes

  “ That man’s goin’ to have a ’polexy
fit,” shrilly cried a large woman

  Immediately everybody drew away from
Bennet, as if he were stricken with the
plague

  “I’m robbed!” he shrieked “Con-
ductor ! ”

  The conductor stoically collected and
rang his fares and looked incredulous
Bennet executed a frantic dance in the
aisle, and then, down on his feet and
hands on the floor of the car, he groped
and searched

  The passengers stared at one another
Their faces said: “ Which one of us is the
guilty party ”

  “ My money’s gone! ” Bennet shouted,
turning red and white “ I’m robbed
within the last two minutes on this car!

('onductor—”

  “ What’s that  Robbed! Are you cer-
tain  ”

  “ Certain ! Certain, man ! Yes, yes—

I’m sure! See, here, my coat’s cut! I
demand a search be made ! ”

  In his intense excitement Mr Bennet
laid both hands on the shoulders of the
conductor, alternately shaking him and
expostulating

  Shorty Saunders, noticing there was
trouble aboard, stopped the car, ran
around to the back platform and entered
•Car men have to fight one another’s bat-
tles  so, without waiting to hear the mer-
its of the case, or what it was all about,
he jerked Bennet away and hurled him
into his seat, adding:

  “ Rough house, eh, old horse”

  “ Says he’s robbed, Shorty,” said Ex-
traman Stevens “ How much did you
have  ”	

  “Ten thousand dollars!’ fumed Ben-
net, getting to his feet and rushing at
Shorty, who, however, held him “ And
I call upon these people to witness the
treatment I’m getting I’ll hold you and
your company responsible”

  “ You’ve dropped your money,” chal-
lenged Stevens

   “ 1 had it when I stepped on this car,
you grinning donkey,” said Bennet “ and
some one on this car has it”

  The passengers began to work them-
selves into varying stages of indignation,
amazement, and alarm Men and women
felt for their purses and jewels, arid
looked generally uncomfortable

   Two police officers hove in sight

  In a few and mostly incoherent words
the situation was explained by Bennet
The announcement of who he was im-
pressed the police and put an entirely
different face upon the matter

  “ Every one on this car must be de-
tained,” said an officer at the door “ Some
money has been lost by this gentleman
Any person who objects to displaying the
contents of their pockets will please step
off the car”

  “ I’ll sue the company,” growled one
individual “ What a humiliation,” tear-
fully announced a flouncing woman

“ This is brainy police work,” sneered a
drummer “ Quite the regular procedure
They ought to call the wagon and cart us
to the station on suspicion

   Denver Joe sat still in his own corner
and smiled demurely It was going to be
a close pinch for him As the searching
process began an ingenious plan for dis-

posing of the well-filled wallet flashed
through him

  Working the packet from his coat-
sleeve, he carelessly dropped it down be-
tween the seat-wall and window-casing,
and watched the perturbation of the other
passengers during the polite examination,
as if it held no interest for him

  Notwithstanding the murmured com-
plaints against this high-handed proce-
dure, the passengers yielded up their pos-
sessions to the gaze of Sergeant Anderson

  Hand luggage was opened to the in-
specting eyes of the officer and Bennet

  The practised eye of the minion of the
law thought it beheld in Denver Joe a
suspicious character, and accordingly
took more liberties with him than with
the others

  “Hal-lo!” drawled Anderson, in a
tone that Denver Joe dreaded “Have,
you seen anything of this gentleman’s
pocketbook ”

  There was a rippling of smiles at the
pleasantry

  Denver Joe’s only fear was that they
might have a picture of him in the rogues’
gallery, and arrest him on general princi-
ples Joe said he did not know anything
about anybody’s pocketbook but his own

  “ What’s your name, and where are you
from ”

  “ Frank Thompson”

  “ Well, Frank,” good-humoredly re-
marked the sergeant, “ will you come with
us for a few moments ”

  “ What’s the matter What do you
want me for  ”

   Just want to see you, that’s all,”
soothingly said the officer, leading him
away “ I think we can dig up a record
of you No harm, if your last clearance
is all right Have you seen this man
before, Mr Bennet”

  “ No,” replied the magnate “ not that
I can remember”

  “ Well, he came in on the train with
you, didn’t he ”

  “ Yes—that is, I guess so”

  “ It may be that you did not have the
money when you left the train, then”

  “ Oh, no I was too careful to forget
it an instant, officer I am certain that I
had the wallet in my pocket when I board-
ed the street-car”

  “ Be careful what you say,” whispered
the officer aside n The chances are that

this crafty guy has a confederate—a
woman”

  “ You’re making a big mistake this
time,” said Denver Joe, with evident con-
sciousness of innocence “ I’m an honest
working man, and—”

   “ Cut it out—cut it out! ” sternly com-
manded the bluecoat “ Now, you know
all about this, and you’ll have to tell us
where that money is”

  “ Not me 1 can’t tell you You won’t
get that out of me, because I know noth-
ing about it”

  Mr Bennet expressed his doubts about
the dishonesty of Joe, but he followed the
officers to the police station  while car 47,
worth ten thousand dollars more than she
was a quarter of an hour before, rolled
on down-town

  Denver Joe was put through the sweat-
ing process for two hours, but the results
were trifling He told a straightforward
story of his arrival in the city, claiming
that he had not paid any attention to Mr
Bennet

  Taken in connection with Mr Bennet's
own statement that lie had boarded the
car with the money and a few seconds
later, missed it, together with the further
apparent fact that the thief, if on that car
had had no opportunity to dispose of the
roll, constituted, in the opinion of the
chief, “ a baffling case of robbery”

  The following morning, when Bennet
reached the station, the chief greeted him
with the discouraging information that
there were no clues

   “Unless,” he added “ you have thought
of some circumstances between the time
you left the train and reached the street-
car that would help to throw light on the
matter I believe your coat was rifled
before you came to the car”

  “ No,” somewhat resentfully declared
Bennet “ It was an extraordinary emer-
gency I carried my wits with me I
know that I had that money with me
when I took mv seat in the i street-car
There was, as usual, a big crowd and
great confusion and, knowing that it
was risky, I was very careful”

  “ Don’t advertise until you hear from
me,” said the chief at the close of the
interview “ We’ll keep this fellow un-
der surveillance after letting him go—
it may be lie has a woman accomplice
We are apt to strike a clue that will

obviate the necessity for paying a large

•	reward Besides,” here the chief grew
chesty, “ my detectives can find the mon-
ey if it is to be found”

III

   The usual inquisitorial device and
promise of reward failed to move Denver
Joe, who chuckled
to himself that he
was the real mas-
ter of the situa-
tion

  Although in-
formed that the
loser would pay
a big sum for in-
formation leading
to the recovery of
the roll, besides
insinuating mi-
ni unit y from
prosecution, J oe
seemed to know
no m ore than
when first taken
into custody

  He knew the
ways of the po-
lice They were
as unreliable as a
w o m a 11 in the
“ lifting ” busi-
ness He would
have 11 o n e of
them The police
usually extracted
the important in-
formation from a poor devil in a jail
cell with “ boo—boo—the—pen—for—
life ” to him

   Then they captured the booty, the
public approbation and the reward
When they did see fit to let a prisoner
go free he got no consideration—not
even the price of an honest man's meal

   Well, if that little roll lying between
 the ribs of 47 ever got back into his
 hands it would be his, surely! No use
 for him to tell the police where it was,
 for that would be his commitment to the
 penitentiary, beyond a doubt

  On Monday afternoon, Denver Joe
was much surprised to find himself re-
leased from the tank

He wandered up the street with a

feeling that he was being watched by a
fly hound of the force If he could
only locate number 47 in which re-
posed his golden prize! A little piece
of crooked wire and, he could soon re-
cover that precious wallet

  Joe found his way to the street end-
ing at the Union Depot There he lin-
gered for an hour, but 47 did not appear

He fancied he'
saw the conduc-
tor on a passing
car but discreet-
ly got out of
sight before be-
ing recognized
He stalked up-
town again, ta-
king a careful, as
well as most un-
usual, interest in

passing

“ Me out of this

it’s the Central
and Suburban,

a fool to stand
here when I can
hit the' phoney
wire and find out
where 47’s run is
to-night”

  Going into a dingy saloon, Joe asked
permission to use the telephone

  “ This is the car-barns,” said a gruff
voice on the wire “What’s wanted”
“ I want the superintendent”

  “ Who’d you suppose this is I’m
the man”

  “That’s all right This is the police
department”

  “Well”

  “Where’s car 47’s run”

  “ What d'ye want to know for I
s’pose she’s smashed something again
and the newspapers are after it, eh”

  “ That’s the business of this depart-
ment Where is it”

  “ Oh 47’s on the Thirteenth and
Montgomery Avenue branch Good-by”
442

THE RAILROAD MAN’S MAGAZINE

  “ Good-by”

  Two hours later found Denver Joe
trudging along the cross-town branoh
Car 47, he noticed, carried no con-
ductor after 6 o’clock, and the revenue
consisted largely of transfers It was
merely an accommodation line and the
outer terminal was at the foot of Bea-
con Hill It was only a short run-and,
as there were few passengers, his actions
would be all the more conspicuous

IV

  It was a thick night, with a blanket of
fog pressing down on the town The
tracks were slippery with half-frozen
mist The lights glowed dimly The
damp cold, sweeping onto the vestibule,
made Saunders quake to the marrow of
his bones The headlight of 47 winked
fitfully The current flowed erratically

  As he was proceeding out on the
1145 trip, the headlight blinked
through the fog and fell upon the fig-
ure of a man at the crossing His hat
was set down over his eyes and, as he
threw up his hand as a signal to stop,
it seemed uncanny

  The car lurched forward over the un-
even crossing Shorty pulled on the
brake to stop her

  Just then the light threw a stronger
glare and revealed a white-cloth mask
over the chin and mouth of the figure on
the ground t

  Saunders’s first thought was of high-
waymen A misguided one he was, at all
events, for the haul of a gun-metal
watch and eighty cents, Shorty reflected,
would not be lucrative for the calling of
a first-class road-agent

  A glance over hi's shoulder confirmed
his suspicions—the intending passenger
was disguised

  Shorty let fly the handle of the brake
and threw the controller lever over al-
most to full speed The car responded
with a fierce leap ahead The black
shadow, however, caught the guide-rail
and hung on His feet slipped and his
head cracked against the corner of the
vestibule of the car His hat flew off,
exposing his face

  “Curse you!” he roared, as'he strug-
gled on the platform “Stop the car!
or I’ll knock your head off!”

 “What do you want” demanded
Shorty “ You’re a ohump if you're
looking for dough on this run”

  “None of your business what 1 want
I’ve lost something inside, and I’m go-
ing after it! Just mind your own
affairs ! Stop her ! ”

  “ Not much,” ejaculated Saunders,
game to the core

  Not seeing any gun in the play yet, he
thought he could take his chances in a
rough-and-tumble with his hold-up pas-
senger

  “ You’ve got a funny way of looking
for things, friend Lost articles can be
found at the office of the company Let’s
see your face Maybe ’tis a joke”
Suddenly, Saunders snatched away the
handkerchief “ Well, you’re a bird—”
The reply was a stout crack from
Denver Joe’s fist squarely upon Saun-
ders’s jaw The doughty motorman
reeled backward against the window of
the vestibule, smashing the glass and
cutting a gash in his forehead The
blood streamed into his eyes

  The sting of the cut brought Shorty’s
fighting blood welling The controller
lever came off with a jerk Shorty
swung it and delivered a smashing blow
upon the highwayman’s skull Denver
Joe went down with a cry He tumbled
backward off the platform

  Saunders’s senses were whirling In
vain did he try to replace the lever on
the motor-box controller It fell from
his nerveless hand

  He sank fainting on the platform, and
47, with rare intelligence and freakish
wisdom, shook off the burden of the body

of Montgomery Avenue The rails were
half submerged under dirt and gravel
They had not been used since the pioneer

  When 47 struck the split-rail section

      At the foot of Montgomery Avenue,

THE RAILROAD MAN’S MAGAZINE

  General Manager Phillips was per-
plexed- beyond measure This perplex-
ity was increased by two circumstances
while they' were all waiting—and hoping
very earnestly—for the recovery of
Saunders

  Some days later the general manager
received an anonymous letter through
the mails He threw it in the waste-
basket and, having thought about it a
second time, dug it out and sent for the
detectives

  The unsigned communication called
his attention to the fact that the man
guilty of the stupendous robbery of $10,-

000	from the lumber magnate was the
motorman, who had picljed up the money
when it was lost and 'had hidden it in
the car

  Another circumstance that puzzled
the general manager was a newspaper
article which professed to have inside
knowledge of the plot of a great rob-
bery that had been planned The rob-
bers had been foiled, the paper said, and
had seized a street-car to hasten their es-
cape from the city

  Denver Joe conducted his anonymous
correspondence from an adjoining city,
and announced he was ready to take his
share of the reward for testifying against
the tlrief He gave as a reason for not
denouncing the thief at the time that he
expected the motorman to split with him
Hearing that the car had been annihi-

lated and the missing treasure found, he
was willing to make a clean breast of it
For a consideration, he would substan -
tiate his story and show up in person

  This seemed plausible enough, until
an investigation set afoot by the general
manager cleared up the matter On
the day that Saunders was able to come
down to the office of the general man-
ager, a Pinkerton man corralled the
clever Denver Joe and he confessed

  Superintendent Skinner had been in-
clined to think Saunders had ben drink-
ing on the night of the runaway, and had
let 47 get away from him This was
sternly denied by the general manager

  And Shorty sat up and took notice
when Phillips said:

  “ Bennet, the man who lost this mon-
ey, has left in my hands a little remem-
brance of $600 for you You didn’t
know, of course,” continued Phillips,
with his keen eyes fixed upon the motor-
man, “ you didn’t know that the man
who lifted the roll from Bennet was on
your car and, when about to be discov-
ered with the roll on him, dropped it in
the ribs of 47, as well as the tiny pair
of shears with which the job was done

  “ The man had no time to escape, and
got rid of the money in that way Can
you identify the man who tried to stop
your car on Thirteenth Street the night
you got hurt”

   “ That I can,” declared Saunders

“ BLONDIE ” REYNOLDS MADE UP TIME

THE New York Central’s fast train from
New York to St Louis arrived on
schedule time, says the St Louis Globe-
Deviocrat, and after a loss of thirty-five min-
utes was made on the eastern division, it was
up to the Mattoon division to make up for
the lost time of the twenty-four-hour run

  When it became apparent that something
had to be done, the New York Central offi-
cials sent out a call for Engineer “ Blondie ”
Reynolds Tie was out on the line, but was
soon under way to Mattoon, and when the
west-bound train steamed in he was ready to
receive her, grim determination in his face
as he climbed into the cab

  Then began such a feat as will go down in
the history of fast trains for many years to
come He and his fireman held the engine,

Conductor Thomas Lawlor and his right-
hand man Charles Scanton, “ held the train
on the track,” and in a few minutes after
leaving Mattoon the passengers were on their
feet in the aisles with' the trainmen, watches
in hand, cheering as each mile was gained

  At Granite City a shout went up “ Blon-
die ” Reynolds had done the seemingly im-
possible He had not only made up the
thirty-five minutes, but he had put the big
train twelve minutes ahead of time When
she struck the maze of the terminal tracks
he was fifteen minutes ahead, but there was
a little loss in getting into the station

  Not enough, though, to lose the day There
was still eight minutes leeway when the ob-
servation-car shot under the roof of the
LTnion Station
Possibilities of the Gyroscope

BY C F CARTER

THE present curiosity among railroad men, incited by the publicity that
lias recently been given to the gyroscope or monorail car leads us to
ask Mr Carter to write a fair-minded and conservative article based
on the adaptability of this new contrivance to railroad service

     Many railroad men have been led to believe that the Brennan and Scherl
inventions are destined to revolutionize present railroad conditions Such
is far from the case Although they certainly rank with the greatest inventions
of the day, they are far from being taken seriously, and no railroad man need
have any fear that the near future will be altered by the principles of gyrostatic
balancing

The two-rail system will be in operation for some time to come

How the Gyroscope Monorail Car Operates A Principle That Is Not
New What Some Experts Have to Say About
It As a Practical Railroad Issue

YER since Louis Brennan ex-
hibited in London last fall
a car which runs upon a
single rail, and is prevented
from falling to either side
by the resistance of two
gyroscopes carried on the car, and Mr
Richard Scherl, of Berlin, exhibited a
similar contrivance, much has been pub-
lished to make the traveling public be-
lieve that the day of the two-rail track is
about over and the era of the monorail is
about to dawn

  Indeed, the inventions of Messrs Bren-
nan and Scherl have been heralded so
fully that the humble track-walker has-
been led to believe that the day is coming
when his weekly wage will be cut in half
because he has to walk along one rail in-
stead of two

  The car propelled by gyroscopic mech-
anism is far from being‘anything but an
experiment, and as yet is so infinitesimal
a factor in changing the standard princi-
ples of railroading that it> future is ex-
tremely doubtful

  Undoubtedly it is one of the most re-
markable inventions of this or any age—
but is it practical and will it pay

  This is a question that must be asked
when anything new is brought out that is
intended to make a complete revolution
in established principles

  From what we can gather, it is evident
that, speaking in the kindliest way, the
answer must be, “ No”

  The ease of the gyroscope car was ad-
mirably summed up in six sentences in
the Engineering News of May 30, 1907
after Mr Brennan had first exhibited his
invention and had made such extrava-
gant prophecies concerning its future de-
velopment As a prominent consulting
mechanical engineer and the operating
vice-president of one of the trunk-lines
told me substantially the same thing,
though at greater length in expressing
their views on the matter, in the month
of January, 1910, the briefer statement
may be worth recalling Here it is:

  “ That the feat is a scientific marvel of
the first magnitude will certainly be

THE RAILROAD MAN’S MAGAZINE

agreed to by all Turning now to the
projects for the practical application of
the invention, we confess ourselves unable
to see any prospect of the use of such a
system of transport as a competitor of
the ordinary two-rail railway

  “ Granting all the claims of the in-
ventor it appears impossible that any
such system could seriously be consid-
ered for a high-speed line, since it would
be inherently more dangerous than the
ordinary two-rail system The proposi-
tion of the inventor to operate cars of
extraordinary widths on this system may
also be set down as an absurdity The
chief practical field for the invention, if
the claims for it are substantiated on fur-
ther investigation, would appear to be
for the construction of very light, cheap
lines for handling traffic of small volume

  “ Some form of transportation line
which can be built and maintained at
small cost is needed in a thousand places,
such as mining and logging railroads,
pioneer and military lines for contractors’
use, and on ranches and plantations”

A Conservative View

  Hart O Berg, who brought the Scherl
car to America, takes a conservative view
of the invention which will go far toward
restoring the confidence in it that has
been sacrificed by oversanguine enthusi-
asts He said:

  “ We are not advancing the gyroscope
monorail car as a perfected invention,
but only as an idea that is worth devel-
oping We have brought the car over
here to get it before American engineers
to let them get their wits to work upon it

  “ We are not going to form any stock
companies, and we are not going to build
any monorail lines yet We have had
several inquiries from parties who want-
ed a line on our system for various pur-
poses

  “ We’ll build them all right if any one
wants to pay the price, but our prices are
not framed to invite business Instead,
we always cordially recommend the pres-
ent type of two-rail line

  “ As we hold the basic patents for the
gyroscope, we can afford to play a wait-
ing game and that is precisely what we
are doing Any one who invents an im-
provement of any kind for the gyroscope-

car will naturally coiiie to us, and we,
as well as the inventor, will be benefited”

For Military Purposes

  Mr Berg’s views are sound and con-
servative He thinks it not unlikely that
the first practical application of the gyro-
scope monorail system may be for mili-
tary purposes Next, he thinks it might
be found peculiarly adapted for subway
construction In a close-fitting tube the
thing simply couldn’t fall over, if it
tried Finally, he is not certain but what
it may be found to have speed possibili-
ties But he makes no predictions

  Mr Berg has acquired the habit of
taking improbable things in hand and
making them work He was concerned
in the manufacture of the first automatic
pistol, the first successful automobile, the
first submarines, and he took up the busi-
ness affairs of the Wright brothers, the
first manufacturers of flying - machines,
when they went to Europe

  The Scherl gyroscope car, which Mr
Berg brought to America, was exhibited
in Brooklyn in January It was a work-
ing model, 18 feet long and feet wide,
weighing 5,000 pounds It had seats for
four passengers and a motorman It was
mounted on two trucks, each having two
small wheels, tandem

  The wheels had double flanges to keep
them on the single rail The car was
driven by ordinary motors, taking the
current through shoe's in contact with
copper wires on each side of the rail

How They Work

  The interest in the car of course, cen-
tered in the gyroscopes, of which there
were two suspended inside the frame of
the car beneath the seats The gyro-
scopes are simply tops consisting of
steel disks about sixteen inches in diame-
ter, mounted on vertical axes, and hence
revolving in horizontal planes like any
other tops, but enclosed in steel vacuum
chambers The gyroscopes made up 55
per cent of the weight of the car

  The descriptions of the apparatus were
'more remarkable for what they omitted
than for what they revealed  for the de-
tails are guarded secrets at present

  Each gyroscope was driven by an
POSSIBILITIES OF THE GYROSCOPE

447

electric motor of three-tenths of a horse-
power, mounted directly on the shaft
The gyroscopes turned in opposite di-
rections at the rate of 7000 revolutions
a minute, as was shown by speed-indica-
tors in front of the motorman

  At first the inventors tried running the
gyroscopes in the open air This re-
quired 27 amperes, at 110 volts: but
when they tried a vacuum two and a half
amperes sufficed

Its First Application

  An interesting feature was that the
gyroscopes were pivoted crosswise of the
car, so that they would tilt forward and
backward freely but could not move
sidewise

  The peculiar gyroscopic principle,
which enables a top or wheel set to spin-
ning in a given plane to hold to that
plane, regardless of the laws of gravita-
tion, has been understood and utilized
for a good- many years

  Foucalt, the French physicist, made
use of it in an experiment half a century
ago to demonstrate the rotation of the
earth

  Soon after L Obry, of Trieste, France,
invented a steering-gear for torpedoes, in
which a gyroscope was used to control
the rudder and hold the torpedo on a
predetermined course Obry’s invention
made the torpedo an effective instrument
of war, and it is still steered by his ap-
paratus

  In 1856 Professor Piazzi Smyth used
the, gyroscopic principle in a device in-
tended to secure a steady support for an
astronomical telescope at sea

Used on Ships

  Dr Otto Sell lick used a gyrostat in an
experiment in 1905 to diminish the roll-
ing of ships Although the experiment
was an unqualified success, no vessel has
yet been equipped with a gyrostat

 Finally Louis Brennan, England,
and August Scherl, of Germany, work-
ing independently and unknown to each
other, tried the gyroscope as a means of
maintaining the equilibrium of a mono-
rail car Mr Brennan, who, by the way,
is the inventor of a torpedo which is
steered by wires, which it unrolls as it

pursues its course, was the first to an-
nounce his discovery, and he was able to
obtain a patent on the plan for enclosing
the gyroscope in a vacuum chamber

  Mr Scherl and his collaborator, Paul
Froelisch, however, got ahead of Mr
Brennan when they discovered that the
gyroscope needed a little help This was
provided by an apparatus which they
called a “ servo-motor”

  When the car leans to one side and the
gyroscope tries to pull it back, the
“ servo-motor,” by means of a delicately
adjusted series of brass levers enclosed
in a glass case, automatically feeds itself
some electric current which generates
power, by which a pull is exerted by
means of levers and reach-rods on the
gyroscopes to tilt them farther over, and
thus intensify their action

  As the car returns to an even keel, the
current is automatically shut oft' from the
servo-motor The gyroscopes are con-
nected by means of toothed quadrants,
so that they both tilt together at the
same angle

Props for Stops

  There are props on each side of a car,
which are put down to support a car
when a stop is made

  The operation of the gyroscopes is en-
tirely independent of the running of the
car They keep right on spinning, no
matter whether th car is running for-
ward or backward, fast or slow, or is
standing still Their function is solely
to keep the car upright

  Their axis of rotation is normally at
right angles to the track If the car tips
to either side, the upper ends of the gyro-
scopes rotate slowly in a circle, just like
a spinning-top, in an effort to bring their
axes of rotation parallel to the mono-
rail The circle described by the top
grows smaller until it disappears This
kind of movement is called “ preces-
sional motion” It is a law of gyro-
scopic motion that, if precession is
hastened, the body rises in opposition to
gravity

  The gyroscopes, being rigidly attached
to the car arc practically a part of it
and the servo-motor by accelerating pre-
cession causes the depressed side of the
car to rise promptly As it rises it causes

a precessional movement in the opposite
direction, which checks an}' tendency to
oscillate

  This process had an uncanny effect
When the car was brought out on the
track that had been laid around Clermont
Skating Rink, in Brooklyn, and left
standing empty, it would sometimes sway
slightly to and fro like a man who had
celebrated not wisely, but too much

  The weight of five or six men always
had a sobering effect, however, and the
car would make the circuit of the rink
steadily enough, always leaning inward
in going around a curve in proportion to
load and speed

Heavy Side Rises

  If one or more of the passengers threw
themselves on the side of the car instead
of upsetting the heavy side would rise

  When running empty the car would
lean in farther on curves than when
loaded, always straightening up on an

                               even keel on reaching a tangent
                               In other words, the gyroscopes
                               did for the monorail car what
                               superelevation and easement
                               curves do for two-rail trains

                              fuse burned out as the car was
                              being taken out on the floor

  The humming of the gyroscopes makes
a loud roar, which sounds much like a
planer dressing, a knotty board They
also cause a vibration that to a passenger
possessed of nerves is intolerable Until
the fearful noise and vibration are elim-
inated the gyroscope car can hardly be
considered desirable for passenger traffic

  Many preposterous claims for the gy-
roscope monorail system have been made
in print Whenever they are questioned
the doubter is reminded that all sorts of
dire failures were predicted for the rail-
road less than a century ago But the
circumstances are totally different

  The world did not know anything at
all about railroads in the second decade
of the last century, and may therefore be
pardoned fon failing to grasp at once

VIEW SHOWING GYROSCOPIC MOVEMENTS

   If the table (representing platform of car) be tilted transversely, the iryroscopic fly-wheel will tilt fore or
aft according to the direction of its rotation, and there will be developed a strong resistance to the move-
ment of the table This fore-and-aft movement is called the precession

  their possibilities But a great
  deal has been learned since and
  while a great deal more remains
  to be learned, certain elementary
  things are so well understood
  that there is no excuse for not
  recognizing the limitations they
  impose

    To begin with, the monorail
  car is wholly dependent upon
  the gyroscope to keep it upright
  While a well-built gyroscope is
  perhaps no more likely to break
  down than any other well-built
  machine, it is certainly not less
  liable to do so It must, there-
  fore, be considered as an added
  element of danger not possessed
  by the two-rail road

    As for the extravagant claims
  for great speed that have been
  made in behalf of the gyroscope
  car, it must not be forgotten that
  there are certain obstacles to
  overcome in maintaining high
  speed that are always the same,
  whether the car runs on one rail
  or on six

    One of these is atmospheric
  resistance For moderate speed
  this is relatively unimportant
  but on getting up to sixty miles
  an hour or more it becomes a
  thing to be considered

 At 110 miles an hour the
 atmospheric resistance is nearly
 four times as great as at 60 miles
 an hour To drive a car, 30 feet
 wide and 10 feet high, at the
 rate of 200 miles an hour
 (which has been soberly pro-
 posed as quite within the bounds
 of possibility for the monorail)
 it would be necessary to over-
 come an atmospheric resistance
 of 60,000 pounds, which alone
 would require 32,000 horse-
 power

    It has been claimed that the
  monorail car can go around phe-
  nomenally sharp curves As a
  matter of fact, the ordinary two-
  rail car is hauled around curves
  on wharves and docks, in city
  streets and elsewhere, quite as
  sharp as any the monorail is al-
  leged to be able to negotiate

But these curves are taken cautiously and
at slow speed

Climbing the Grades

  The tendency of a monorail truck,
traveling at high speed, to go straight
ahead on striking a curve, is not likely
to be any less than that of the ordinary
truck The single wheel will be just as
prone to climb the rail and land the
train in a corn-field as two wheels travel-
ing side by side

  It is rather difficult to see just how
the gyroscope is going to enable mono-
rail cars to climb any steeper grades
than are possible for ordinary cars

  A car cannot go beyond a certain limit,
no matter how many rails it runs on or
how its wheels are arranged, unless one
of the wheels happen to be a cog-wheel
traveling in a rack

  The steepest grade climbed by an ad-
hesion locomotive on a railroad handling
miscellaneous traffic was ten per cent
That feat was accomplished on a tem-
porary track on the Baltimore and Ohio
in 1S52 The achievement has not been
duplicated since, and no one wants to
duplicate it

  Railroad men are not lying awake
nights studying out ways to build lines
with steeper gradients their one idea is
to reduce the grades they have, and they
are rendered unhappy by a grade of one
per cent

Calling on Imagination

  Even if, by the magic of the gyroscope,
cars could be enabled to climb abnormal
grades, the feat could be accomplished
only at an expenditure of power out of
all proportion to the results

  As for the proposal to bridge wide
chasms simply by stretching a cable, upon
which the monorail is to cross like a
slack-rope walker, with the gyroscopes
instead of a balancing-pole to maintain
its equilibrium, no engineer will take that
too seriously

  And, no matter how-many rails a train
runs on, the imperative necessity of being
able to stop quickly, as well as to get up
speed, remains unchanged Just how the
braking power of a car is to be increased
by robbing it of half its wheels has not

been explained by those who talk of run-
ning from 120 to 200 miles an hour

  The fascination which the monorail
has exercised upon the imagination of
inventors is one of the most curious
things in the history of the railroad Al-
most from the very beginning men have
sought to improve the railroad by taking
away half its rails

An Old Story

  Thomas Telford, the great Scottish
engineer who played so conspicuous a
part in developing internal improvements
in England and Sweden, first proposed
the monorail as long ago as 1831 Since
then a continuous succession of inventors
has patented various forms of single-rail
railways, all of which were to revolu-
tionize the world’s transportation sys-
tems, but none of which has done so

  In 1877 F I Rowan read a paper be-
fore the Society of Arts in London, ad-
vocating the building of monorail lines
as pioneer railways for undeveloped and
difficult countries

  In 1S83 Charles Lartigue, a French
engineer, built primitive monorail lines
in Algeria and Tunis that were operated
by horse-power

  F B Behr took up Lartigue’s idea,
building an experimental line near Vic-
toria Street, Westminster, in 1886 Two
years later he built a short line from
Listowel to Ballybunion, Ireland, which
was operated for several years

  In 1897 Behr had an exhibition mono-
rail at the Brussels Exposition, running
cars 60 feet long, 10 feet 10 inches wide,
and weighing 70 tons On one occasion
he claimed to have attained a speed of
83 miles an hour

And There Are Others

  Lartigue and Behr’s system was real-
ly not a monorail, but a five-rail arrange-
ment The principal rail, from which
the weight of the car was suspended, was
placed 4 feet above the ground, at the
apex of A-shaped supports, one meter
apart

  On either side of these A-shaped sup-
ports were two guide - rails, on which
wheels ran to prevent oscillation There
were eight vertical double-flanged wheels

  An attempt was made to build a Behr
monorail line between Manchester and
Liverpool in 1901, on which the usual
miraculous speed—which seems to be an
inseparable feature of all monorail
schemes — was to be maintained, but
nothing came of it

  Behr also tried to get up a company in
1906 to build a monorail line from New
York City to Coney Island but that
also fell through, and since then nothing
further has been heard of his system

Other Systems

  On the outskirts of New York City a
monorail line, three miles long, is being
built from Bartow to Belden Point on
City Island While the weight of the
car is actually carried on a single rail, it
is really a three-rail system In order to
maintain the car in an upright position,
two light suspended rails are carried on
supports above the track

  Wheels bearing against these balance
the car, and also serve the purpose of
trolley-poles

  The Tunis system, as it is called, is
very similar to the E Moody Boynton
system, which was extensively exploited
in 1899, but which, nevertheless, met the
usual fate of the monorail

  The only true monorail system in ac-
tual operation to-day is the Langen sus-
pension line from Elberfeld to Barmen,
Germany It is an elevated structure,
from which cars 38 feet long are sus-
pended from a single rail instead of run-
ning on two rails above the structure

  If the monorail, having the moral
support of the gyroscope, can succeed in
living down such a past as that, it will
be welcomed by engineers and railroad
men alike

What an Authority Says

  The Scientific American, in a recent
editorial, says:

    Brennan and Scherl, cach working in-
  dependently of the other, have recently
  proved that a car containing a pair of
  gyroscopes can be run upon a single
  rail and maintain its stability under
  varying conditions of eccentric loading,

  side winds, and curving track Upon
  seeing a practical demonstration of this
  fact, and submitting the car, as the
  writer recently did, to various severe
  and successfully endured tests, it is nat-
  ural, in the first moment of enthusi-
  asm, to predict an immediate and wide-
  spread application of the system, or
  even the eventual abandonment of the
  present two-rail track and trains in
  favor of the monorail type

    Sober second thought, however, must
  convince any thoughtful and practical
  mind that, in spite of the brilliant re-
  sults of the recent demonstration, the
  monorail gyroscopic car, in the nature
  of things, can have only a more or less
  limited application under present day
  conditions

    It seems to us that if there is a future
  for the new system, it will be found in
  the construction of pioneer railways
  through undeveloped country, and
  particularly through mountainous and
  hilly country where the line must of
  necessity be very circuitous The self-
  adjusting qualities of the car enable it
  to run around curves which would be
  altogether impossible for a two-track’
  railroad The monorail track could be
  located around a hill or bluff, through
  which a two-track railroad would have
  to pass with heavy and expensive ex-
  cavation Moreover, for this class of
  railroad a much lighter car would be
  practicable and extremely high speeds
  would not be demanded This decrease
  in weight and speed would mean a
  great reduction in first cost and subse-
  quent cost of- maintenance of the
  system

    If the new type should demonstrate
  in service of this kind its commercial
  practicability, it is quite conceivable
  that it would be gradually applied to the
  more important lines of travel, and
  eventually to the main trunk roads

Opinion of an Engineer

  S L F Deyo, chief engineer of the
Interborough Rapid Transit Company,
said, after seeing the car in operation:

  “ I do not think the monorail car has
passed out of the experimental stage yet,
but that is not saying that I do not be
lieve that some day it will come into use
for certain kinds of travel If there were
a collision, for instance, and a monorail
car were derailed, it, would probably turn
turtle In such a case I would prefer to
be on board of a two-rail car”

HOW KOMO BILL WENT

EAST

            BY WILLIAM DAVID BALL

               He Made Up His Mind To Quit
               the Cattle Country—and He Did

E fall round-up was over
The last drive of a thousand
steers had been made to
Wolcott, the shipping point
Komo Bill, night-wrangler
for the T Y outfit, sat on
his heels near where the cook was wash-
ing dishes, and stared moodily into the
camp-fire

  “ Say, Chub,” he began, by way of
opening a conversation, “ don’t you ever
get tired a cookin’, an’ a washin’ crock-
ery”

  “Naw,” answered Chub “I’d rather
sling chuck than get shook up the way
you do sometimes What you got on
your mind, Komo ”

  Komo looked up gloomily “ Tired,
that’s all,” he answered “ This bucka-
rooin’ life is gettin’ stale”

There was no comment from Chub
Komo resumed his watching of the fire
Presently he got up with an air of weari-
ness, kicked a loose sage-brush into the
fire, and again addressed the cook:

  “ I’m goin’ East, Chub”

  “That so” said Chub, mildly in-
quisitive

  “ Yep Take the stage from Kremm-

1	in’ on Tuesday probably go to Chicago
or New York”

  The cook’s face lighted up with a sud-
den thought

  “ Say, Komo,” he laughed, “ you ain’t
got no money, and the rest of the boys is
broke Where’ll you get the cash”
Komo smiled a superior smile, and
glanced at Chub patronizingly “ You
leave that to me, Chub I’ll get there”
Komo Bill, with the air of a man about
to order out his private car, sauntered over
to where tlie horses were corralled Around
the camp-fire that night the boys were

 told of Komo’s new plan Komo him-
 self was absent—gone to the ranch, six
 miles away, to see the foreman The cook
 related what had passed between himself
 and Komo Bill, and also gave his opinion
 about the matter

   “ Komo’ll never get to Chicago with-
 out he rides a box car,” he said “ He
 can’t borrow no money, an’ the cattle-
 trains has all gone What’s he goin’ to
 do ”

   Various plans, of more wit than sense,
 were suggested by the sympathetic lis-
 teners They were used to Komo Bill’s
 “ lay-offs,” as they called them but till
 now he had manifested no desire to travel
 farther east than Denver That he should
 start for Chicago or New York furnished
 good material for comment and amuse-
 ment  but it scarcely caused surprise

   “ You listen to me, boys,” said Petey
 Johnson “I’ll stake my last bean that
 Komo’ll make good He’s got brains”

   In the morning Komo Bill started for
 Kremmling 011 a horse borrowed from
 the outfit The farewells were said cas-
 ' uallv, and consisted for the most part of,
 “ So long, Komo! ” and “ So long, ole
 man! ”

   As the night - wrangler rode over the
 nearest butte, his comrades caught a few
 fault words from one of their favorite
 songs:

    Oil, I'll sell my horse an' I’ll sell my
       saddle

   I’ll ride no more for the T Y cattle

   Komo Bill stood in front of tlie Texas
 Steer, the largest saloon in Kremmling,
 and watched the stage as it lumbered up
 to the post-office and general store One
 passenger alighted — a slim, well-knit
 man of medium height, who walked

quickly up the street and entered a res-
taurant

  Komo watched the newcomer with in-
terest His clothes were perfect They
reminded Komo of the East, and also that
to-morrow was Tuesday—the time he had
set for his going

  As yet he had failed to raise the money
for his fare He had borrowed eleven
dollars from Jake, the sheriff Eleven

  “ This is the hardest proposition I ever
tried to rope” he grumbled, as he fixed
his eyes meditatively on the restaurant
windows “ Guess I’ll take a walk and
think it over”

  The one thing lacking thus far in the
present problem was opportunity This
was to come in the person of the stran-
ger who had just alighted from the coach
and whom Komo Bill-had keenly noticed

“i HAVE A SOMEWHAT DIFFICULT JOB ON MY HANDS”

dollars, Komo figured, would just about
pay his stage fare to the railroad station
It would be the height of folly to start
with such a ridiculously small sum The
roulette-wheel in the Texas Steer had ta-
ken the eleven dollars, and Komo had
taken a walk to see the stage come in

 A settled gloom darkened Komo’s
face He growled an unintelligible an-
swer to the bartender’s friendly greeting,
and passed to the rear of the saloon The
two private card-rooms were unoccupied
—or, so Komo thought He entered the
first and sat down at the table The door

between the two rooms was partly open
Presently he heard voices

  “ Jake and that dude feller,” he com-
mented without interest He half rose
from his chair to shut the door, but sat
down again quietly with his head bent
forward

  The stranger was speaking

  “ Yes, you see I have a somewhat diffi-
cult job on my hands,” he was saying
“ The kidnaping occurred ten years ago
at the wharf in New York Harbor This
Joe Borden has had plenty of time to
change his appearance He is described
as tall, well built, with brown eyes and
hair, and a slight limp in his left leg

  “ At the time the affair made but little
stir now, however, legal complications
have arisen in the will of a rich New
York man The relatives want Joe Bor-
den Information has come to headquar-
ters that he is here at Kremmling, or in
the near vicinity I want your help,
sheriff, your cooperation—”

  “ I’ll help you, stranger,” the sheriff
interrupted, “ but hold your lines a min-
ute till I get my memory goin’ Seems
like I’ve heard a friend of mine tell of
Joe Borden, an’ if I recollect right he
said Joe Borden was dead—died in New
Mexico, I believe

  “ But 1 ain’t certain about it at all
Your man may be right in town now, for
all we know Say, I’ll be busy from now
till along ’bout two o’clock, but you stick
around an’ I’ll bring my friend so’s you
can talk to him yourself”

  Komo Bill quietly let himself out the
rear door His face was radiant with
smiles

  “ Joe never did talk much ’bout his
wild and frivolous boyhood,” he mused,
“ but I never knew he was that bad
Anyhow, I got brown eyes an’ brown
hair—an’ I guess I can limp, too, when it
comes to a show-down”

  Komo Bill’s preparations were quickly
made Alone in his room, he put on a
black suit it was somewhat faded and
wrinkled, but still it was a black suit—a
mark of respectability He buckled on
his belt and made sure that the big 45
Colt’s worked easily in the holster

  Carefully he locked the door and
pulled down the window-shade A few
clothes and trinkets thrust into a battered

11	telescope,” and everything was in readi-

ness His saddle, chaps, and spurs he had
already entrusted to Jake, with minute in-
structions as to their welfare He sat
down, crossed his feet on the window-sill,
and briefly reviewed his plan of cam-
paign

  At two o’clock he would interview the
stranger in the private room of the Texas
Steer at four o’clock, if all went well,
when the stage from Steamboat passed
through he would be on his way to the far
East

  But during those two hours the sheriff
must be absent By some method or other
be must be put out of the way Komo Bill
smiled broadly he had devised a method

  A knock on the door Komo turned
his head and grinned at the door-knob
The knock was repeated Some one de-
scended the stairs

  “ Must be ’bout two o’clock,” said Ko-
mo, as he peered through a slit in the
window-shade He saw the sheriff cross
the street, enter the post-office and after
a few moments come out hurriedly

  “ Campin’ on my trail! ” exclaimed
the delighted Komo He craned his neck
until the sheriff disappeared around a
corner

  A moment later, “ telescope ” in hand,
he walked into the post-office

  “ Sheriff is looking for you, Komo,”
said the storekeeper

  There was a general laugh from the
men standing around Every one knew
of the friendship that existed between
Komo Bill and Jake

  “That so” queried Komo blandly
“ I’m lookin’ fer him too You know
Jimmy of the ‘ four - bar - four ’—I met
him this mornin’, an’ he says he saw
Duck Flinn, the rustler, ’bout three miles
east of Yampa If you see Jake, let him
know”

  The news started a commotion Two
of the men rushed out and sprang to
their horses Komo Bill followed, wa-
ving aside the eager questions and ex-
cited demands for further information
As he entered the Texas Steer he saw the
two horsemen turn the corner in pursuit
of the sheriff

  The hands of the clock above the mir-
ror pointed to a quarter past two Bill
set his “ telescope ” down near the door
and hurried to the room where he knew
the detective waited
456

THE RAILROAD MAN’S MAGAZINE

  He opened the door and stepped in
The stranger, with his hands clasped be-
hind him, stood looking at the pictures
on the wall At the noise he turned

  For an instant the two men faced each
other Komo Bill gave a quick start of
alarm, and whipped out his revolver His
eyes shone with fierce questioning from
beneath the Xvide slouch-hat The stran-
ger looked calmly at the black muzzle
pointed at his breast

  There was 110 fear—not even surprise
—in his, eyes

  “ Sit down,” said Komo in a low voice
“ Put your hands on the table” The
stranger obeyed

  When Komo spoke again there was less
strain in his voice

  “ I reckon you ain’t had much expe-
rience with the business end of a gun
People in this here country generally
throws up their hands”

  The stranger laughed

  “ Oh,” he replied, “ you see when I
know that the man with whom I am
dealing is 011 the square, I take chances”
Komo smiled at the compliment, but
did not relax his vigilance The man at
the table leaned on his elbows and in-
quired smoothly:

  “ Might I ask the reason for this little
—eh—”

  “Gun-play” suggested Komo as he
threw one leg over the back of a chair
and rested his gun on his knee “ No,
you can’t ask just now You’re a detec-
tive, ain’t you ”

  The question came sharply, but the
stranger did not move His voice was
low and even as he answered:

  “ I don’t see just how that concerns
you, but I don’t mind telling you that I
am not a detective”

  “ Oh ! ” said Komo There was a world
of relief in his voice

  Fie slipped his revolver back into the
holster and went on to explain

  “ Mostly I can tell a detective by in-
stinct, but sometimes I get off the trail
Detectives have a way of snootin' around
in things that don't concern them Now,
some folks thinks I’m dead, which of
course ain’t nobody’s business, but I ain't
earin’ to have no detective tie on to it”
The stranger’s dark eyebrows lifted
slightly His next question came in a
voice even smoother than before

  “ What is your name ”

  Komo’s smile was genial and confiden-
tial—in fact, there was a trace of silli-
ness in his smile—as he answered :

  “ They’ve called me Bill—Komo Bill
—ever since I came from New York,
about, oh, about nine or ten years ago, I
guess”

  Again there was an
almost imperceptible
upward twitching of
the dark eyebrows
Komo took no notice,
but turned and walked
to a small table in the
corner The stran-
ger’s eyes sparkled—
there was a slight but
unmistakable limp in
Komo’s left leg

  “ Let’s have a game
of pitch” said Komo
cheerfully, picking up
a deck of cards from
the table He turned
to confront the muz-
zle of a revolver held
within a foot of his
head His teeth came
together with a click

  “ I guess I ain’t
takin’ no chances this

time,” he remarked dryly, as his hands
went up above his head

  “Right about! Face!” snapped the
stranger Komo pivoted on his heel A
light hand removed his gun and deftly
felt his pockets

er sharply “You go because you are
wanted! Now, to business! As I un-
derstand it, the stage for Wolcott starts
at four o’clock We leave then If you
have any clothes to take, get them at
once Ordinarily, 1 handcuff my man,

“WHY DON'T YOU FIX IT NOW

        “ You may face this way ! ” The stran-
      ger was seated on the table with his feet
      on a chair “ You are going back to New
      York with me, Joe Borden,” he said,
      watching Komo with narrowed eyelids

        The quick start and sharp intake of
     breath that greeted this announcement
     were admirable—admirable because they
     were not overdone They suggested great
     emotion restrained with difficulty

      “To New York!” gasped Komo
    “ Besides, that ain’t my—”

        “ That's enough! ” interrupted the oth-

L 	•

but in the present case ”—he paused and
ran his eyes over Komo’s muscular frame
with an air of mild contempt—“ in this
case 1 feel safe in allowing you to travel
almost as if you were my companion But
remember, 1 am quick with a gun! ”

  “ 1 guess you got me dead to rights! ”
murmured Komo

  The stranger put his revolver in his
hip-pocket, and pointed to the door There
were no customers in the saloon The
bartender had taken advantage of this
unusual state of affairs by going to sleep
458

THE RAILROAD MAN’S MAGAZINE

  “ Let's have somethin’,” said Komo, as
they neared the bar Suddenly the gal-
loping of a horse sounded in the street
A fiery little bronco dashed up to the
hitching-post The sheriff swung from
the saddle

  Komo Bill groaned, and glanced fur-
tively at the rear door

  “ Stage cornin’! ” shouted some one
■from outside

  The sheriff entered the saloon The
stranger caught Komo Bill by the collar
and pushed him forward

  “ Here, hold this man! ” he cried in
quick, incisive tones “ I’ll return in a
moment! ”

  The sheriff swore as the detective
sprang past him and through the door
He turned to Komo Bill

  “ Whatdo you—”

  “Don’t give me away, Jake! Don’t
give me away now He thinks I’m Joe

Borden You know Joe’s dead Ten
minutes’ telegraphin’ to Albuquerque will
fix things”

  “Why don’t you fix it now” cried
J ake

  “ Sh !—the explain in’s got to be done
at the other end Can’t you see” He
lowered his voice impressively “ I’m
goin’ East 1 ”

  The stranger appeared in the door,
suit-case in hand The sheriff grinned
Holding Komo by the shoulder, he jmshed
him roughly toward the door “ You
fool! ” he whispered in Komo’s ear
“ Why didn’t you let me in sooner ”

  As the stage-coach, occupied by the
Eastern detective and the night-wran-
gler, rolled awray, the Sheriff of Kremm-
ling pulled his long mustache

  “ I wonder now,” he mused, “ how
am I ever goin’ to get even with that cuss
fer this Dick Flinn business”

CARS AND LOCOMOTIVES BUILT IN 1909

THE number of cars and locomotives
built during the past year is but a
little greater than the 1908 figures, in spite
of the improvement in general business con-
ditions during 1909, says the Railzvay Age-
Gascttc However, it has really been but a
few months since the railways came into the
market with substantial inquiries and de-
liveries on orders placed at the beginning of
this movement did not begin until this fall

  Returns from 14 locomotive builders in
the United States and Canada (estimating
the output of two small plants), show a
total of 2,887 engines Of the 2,653 built in
the United States, 2,362 were for domestic
-use and 29T for export These figures include
16 electric and 119 compound locomotives
The Canadian engines, 234, were all for
domestic service

  During the past year 53 car-building
companies in the United States and Canada

built 96,419 cars, which is 23 per cent more
than the number built in 1908 These figures
include Subway and Elevated cars, but not
street railway and interurban cars It must
be remembered also that the output of rail-
way companies’ shops is not included

Of the cars built in the United States,
84,416 were freight-cars for domestic serv-
ice, 2,435 freight for export, 2,599 passen-
ger-cars for domestic service, and 150 pas-
senger-cars for export

Of the freight-cars, 63,763 were of steel,
or had steel underframes of the passenger- 
cars 1,650 Canada built 6,661 freight-cars
for domestic service, 58 freight for export,

99 passenger-cars for domestic service, and
one passenger-car for export

T11 1908, Canada built 8,598 freight-cars
and 79 passenger-cars

WHAT is the length of the snow-sheds
on the Southern Pacific in Nevada

          (2)	Describe the bridge-trestle, or
fill, over Salt Lake, giving-length, saving in
miles, time, etc—J A D, Bristol Pennsyl-
vania

  (1)	There are forty miles of snow-sheds
on the Southern Pacific, up through the
Sierras In these sheds are seventy-five
million feet, or thereabouts, of lumber
Every year five million feet of lumber is
used for repairs and renewals The cost of
the sheds, for lumber alone, is $,50,000 per
mile It is said that, up to date, the total
cost of installing and maintaining these in-
dispensable structures has been $30,000,000

  (2)	The Great Salt Lake “cut-off” be-
gins at Ogden, Utah, and, after crossing the
lake, follows the bed of another prehistoric
lake to a junction vvitli the old line at Lucin
Nevada It was built to take the place of
the long serpentine route between the same
points, which passed around the north shore
of the Great Salt Lake, and over Promon-
tory Mountain, where, 011 May 10 1869 the
last spike was driven in the all-rail line
from ocean to ocean

From dry land to dry land the “cut-off
covers twenty miles of pile construction

and as an example of engineering and an
illustration of ingenious and substantial con-
struction there is nothing comparable with
it anywhere It was opened November 28,
1903, and took two years to build It sweeps
away 4377 miles, eliminates 3919 degrees
of curvature, and 1,515 vertical feet of
grade cuts down the running time of the
fastest train two hours, and through its
practically gradeless route increases the ton-
nage movable per horse-power almost be-
yond power to calculate

  The figures referring to curvature and
grade may be rendered clearer and more
interesting by a little elaboration Each de-
gree of curvature represents the segment of
a circle, and there are 360 degrees in a
circle Put these degrees of curvature to-
gether into circles, and it will be seen that
between Ogden and Lucin there were 1188
circles, and that every train of the old route
not onlj- covered the air-line distance, but
ran around the nS8 circles besides The
number of vertical feet disposed of was
1515-

  Inorder to overcome this grade the train,
by the old way, was lifted above the road-
bed of the “ cut-off ” to a height equal to

1515	vertical feet Calculate the weight of

a loaded car at 66000 pounds: calculate that
it takes one horsc-power to raise 33000
pounds vertically one foot per minute, and
that, therefore, it would require two horse-
power to raise the loaded car vertically the
same distance per minute multiply by the

1,515	feet of grade disposed of multiply
the car by the number of cars in the ordi-
nary length of train multiply the train by
the number of trains represented in the
vast yearly business of the road add the
aggregate of friction, and you will have an
approximate idea of what the Great Salt
Lake “ cut-off ” means in the economy of
the road's operation There are other fig-
ures equally interesting, and here they are
in a nut-shell

  Tlie road rubbed out was 14668 miles
long, the “ cut-off ” is 10291 miles long
Twenty miles an hour was pretty good
time on the old line, and never a train toiled
over it without a monster helping engine
at its head By the new way, there are no

  They are called collectors in the East, the
designation von mention applying largely in
BY THE LIGHT OF THE LANTERN

461

the West and Middle West Their duties
are to collect the tickets, and look after the
transportation generally, in order that the
conductor will be left unhampered to run
his train As a rule, however, you will riot
find them on a train unless the travel is so
heavy that the conductor cannot “ work  it
properly between stopping points For in-
stance, on the heavy trains of the New Ha-
ven road, out of New York, it is necessary
to have a collector to assist the conductor
until New Haven is reached, after which he
goes with his train alone to Boston The
same thing applies on many Erie trains out
of Jersey City, the conductor being unable
to get all the tickets unaided before the
first stop We are in doubt as to what com-
pensation they do receive in the West, but in
this section the pay is about $75 or $85 a
month They are promoted from baggage-
masters or trainmen

HOW much horse-power, or fraction
thereof, will a miniature locomotive
develop that has a boiler of 12000
cubic inches capacity, or is 4 x il> feet The
two cylinders are 6x4 inches, and the two
driving-wheels are 14 inches in diameter
The boiler is built to hold 150 pounds pres- ,
sure Please tell me what you think of
such dimensions, and state improvements
that could be made—R W B, Newmarket
New Jersey

  The dimensions which you give are all
wrong for the best results Presuming that
your figures for the size of the cylinder
should be reversed, viz: 4x6 instead of
6x4 inches, then the stroke is too long: the
driving-wheels are too high, and the diame-
ter of the boiler is disproportionately large
to its length Still in order to give the in-
formation asked regarding horse-power
based on your figures, it is necessary to re-
vert to the following formula:

   2

C x S x P x (Al P H)

- = Horse-power in

D x 375	which

  C is diameter of cylinder in inches

  S, length of stroke in inches

  P mean effective pressure at given peed

  M P Hi, miles per hour

  D,	diameter of driving-wheel in inches

  Assuming “ Al P H ’’ to represent ten
miles per hour, at which speed these models
are usually run and for “ P,” 127 pounds
pressure 011 the common rule of S5 per cent
of boiler pressure for mean effective pres-
sure, and substituting these values in the
formula we have:

36 x 4 x 127 x 10

---- About 35 horse-

'4 x 375	power—an absurdity

  Locomotive design must be gingerly ap-
proached whether in models or actual prac-
tise, and we think that the best thing you
can do is to correspond with some of the
firms who manufacture parts for model lo-
comotives and they will set you right re-
garding'the proper dimensions You might

man must brake before promotion The
latter is very slow, at least in the eastern
section, and it might be five or seven years,
if not longer

  (5) The average pay of brakemen may
be said to be $225 per day, or one hun-
dred miles, and for conductors $350 but
these quotations are really of little value, as
the scale shifts tremendously, dependent on
the section of the country and the strength
of the existing agreements

WT B„ Knoxville, Tennessee—The

•	way you picture the occurrence
seems to put the blame for the train getting
by squarely on the day-man, and that is the
way it looks at this long range But it is
always extremely hazardous to even venture
an opinion concerning responsibility for er-
ror unless in full possession of the material
gathered during the investigation

WHAT is the average heat which is at-
tained in a hot box Is there any
device on the market to eliminate the
trouble—H S, Detroit, Michigan

  There is no strictly reliable data for this
temperature, as it would be largely dependent-
on the composition of the soft metal which
forms the liner for the brass proper, and
on which the journal runs The metal ordi-
narily employed for car brasses is specially
hard babbitt

  This will start to run, or fuse, at about
400 degrees F This temperature is of
course, abnormally high for a hot box,
and would imply a mclted-out brass
The term, as you no doubt are aware, is
freely applied, and may mean only the pack-
ing on fire, with the bearing relatively cool
In regard to special devices to minimize
hot-box troubles, these are confined to slight
differences in the interior of the journal-
box, which encloses the journal of the axle,
the journal bearing and key, and which holds
the packing for lubricating the journal

  That any one of these departures is any
more serviceable in the long run than the
American Railway Master Mechanics Asso-
ciation journal-box, which is in general use
is largely speculative The idea 011 which
these patented devices is based, is simply to
keep the oil-soaked packing in more uniform
contact with where it will do the most good

  The best safeguard is, of course, to give
the boxes the necessary attention, which they
fail to receive more than any single item
about the railroad, viz: See that none of
the lids have been lost, allowing dirt to
enter that they contain sufficient packing
to take care of them, and that the soft liner

mentioned is not worn down to a point where
the brass itself will run on the journal
without the interposition of an anti-friction
metal Ninety per cent, we believe, of hot-
box troubles arise from lack of care, as
the existing appliances arc thoroughly ade-
quate

WOULD it affect the lead of the valve

letting down the reverse lever

  (5)	What is the average price of a 200-

Oregon

  (1)	Bending the eccentric-blade, as sug-
gested, would have no effect on the total
value of the lead that is, the sum of the
omission-port opening at each end of the
stroke It would simply serve to distort the
motion by rendering unequal the leads on
either side of the valve, and the exhaust
would likely beat “out of square”

  The maximum travel of the valve is fixed
by the throw of the eccentric, which is per-
manently keyed to the shaft, and the proper
length of the eccentric-blade is that which
will permit the valve to move an equal dis-
tance 011 either side of an imaginary line
drawn through the center of the valve-seat
Hence the length of the eccentric-blades
should be regarded as really permanent

  They are never changed except to correct
inequalities in the valve travel mentioned
Moving the reverse-lever 011 the quadrant
simply lengthens or shortens the valve travel
011 the seat, without interfering with the
equality of the travel, provided the eccentric-
blades are of the proper length

  (2)	You cannot calculate the horse-power
of a boiler from the grate surface only
You might allow ten square feet of the total
heating surface to each horse-power which
is a rough-and-ready rule

not to oppose other than an ethical obstacle
to such entrance If the seal of which you
write can be opened without destroying it,
it would be the natural inference that it
could be restored to its primary condition as
readily after the car had been entered The
cost of the existing car-seal is insignificant,
and any new device would not impress in
that direction In regard to improvements

  Your question is much involved, and we'
doubt if the answer will be exactly what you
arc looking for The confusing feature is
that you have already defined the engines
as one and two horse-power, respectively
Then, of course, the second will do twice

clude that the second engine only develops

of steam, it is only at half its capacity at
one hundred pounds, and both engines are
therefore equal The formula for calcula-
ting horse-power is pressure (mean effective
pressure for stroke), multiplied by length of
stroke in feet, multiplied by area of piston
in square inches, multiplied by number of
working strokes per minute, and the whole
divided by 33,000, the result equaling
horse-power You will thus note that the
pressure is the controlling factor in the
formula, as will be readily evinced by work-
ing it out for a number of pressures in
connection with the same engine If this
does not explain, let us fiear from you again

DR S Altoona Pennsylvania—As we

•	have frequently intimated in this de-
partment, the dimensions which we receive
from the locomotive builders covering their
recent types of construction do not unless
in exceptional cases, give the total length
of locomotives, information being confined
to the length of the rigid wheel-base: the
total wheel-base of the engine, and the total
wheel-base of both engine and tender We
correctly quoted in the February number the
total wheel-base of Southern Pacific No
4000 engine and tender, at eighty-three feet
six inches, as the longest recorded No
doubt your figures, viz, one hundred and
eleven feet ten and one-half inches, for the
corresponding dimensions of Santa Fe Nos
1700 and 1701 is correct, but this does not
imply that No 4000 is not very much longer
than eighty-three feet six inches, when the
overhang at each end is reckoned with and
added As a rule, the length over all from
the nose of the pilot to the extreme rear por-
tion of the tender frame is difficult to esti-
mate, unless, of course, access may be had
to the elevation prints of engine and tender
The total wheel-base is an important dimen-
sion, to'know whether existing turntables
will take care of the engine, but the total
length is relatively unimportant

SYNOPSIS OF PREVIOUS CHAPTERS

FRED ERSKINE has received a letter from the general superintendent of the Chicago,
St Louis and Western Railroad—Andrew Warrington—who was formerly fireman
on his father’s engine He has helped put Fred through college, and, upon his graduation,
writes him to call at his office in Chicago Upon arriving there, Fred finds Warrington
in great trouble It appears that bonds to the extent of $500,000 have been stolen from the
safe of the company, and the only ones knowing the combination are the treasurer, War-
rington's son, who has been lately speculating wildly, and the general superintendent, him-
self Warrington, the father, has had some differences with Henry Burbridge, the presi-
dent of the company The directors, siding with Warrington, were disposed to compel
Burbridge to resign, and elect Warrington his successor On account of the gambling
and speculating of his son, Warrington is compelled to suspect him, but at the same time
imagines it may be a plot of Burbridge's and the treasurer, Stanwood, to implicate his son,
and thereby discredit him, causing him to resign from the company An Englishman,
Montresor, who is 011 friendly terms with Warrington's wife and daughter, is supposed to
know more than any one about the disappearance of the bonds The proposition made to
Fred is that he is to trace the bonds, find out who was instrumental in their disappearance,
working independently of the detectives already engaged, and without communicating in
any way with Mr Warrington during the time, return the bonds within thirtydays It is
a stupendous task Mr Warrington requests him to call that evening and escort his
daughter, Louise, to the opera, as he has reasons to believe that she is going to meet Mon-
tresor, and he wants Fred to be in a position to know all the details Instead of going to

CHAPTER V

Side-Tracked

EVERAL minutes passed before
a realization of his situation
began to dawn upon Erskine’s
mind then he feebly raised
himself to a sitting position
and looked around him He
saw that he was alone The
carriage that had brought him and Miss
Warrington to this spot had disappeared,
as had also Montresor and the unseen
man who had struck him down just after
the Englishman had assaulted him

  With a low-muttered oath, the Altoona
man rose from the ground Passing a
hand over his hair, he found that blood
was issuing from a scalp wound at the
back of his head

  “ Well, the old man was right enough,”
he muttered “ Montresor’s trail and
mine have crossed My eyes were closed,
however, and he got me foul, and now
Andrew Warrington’s enemy is mine Un-
til I get this fellow Montresor on his back,
his trail and mine are one”

  Retreating farther into the shadow of
the clump of trees, he seated himself on
a rock and, leaning back, he clasped his
hands over one of his knees

  “Now, where do I begin” he mused

  Frederick Erskine came of good old
fighting stock, and the most dangerous
fighter always is the one who keeps his
head Though anger still smoldered
dully in his eyes, the young man made a
determined effort to review the situation
calmly This was difficult at first, for it
was only gradually that he recovered
from the effect of the blow that had ren-
dered him unconscious

  He asked himself how it had come to
pass that Montresor so soon had recog-
nized him as an enemy Then he remem-
bered that it had been Louise who had
first revealed the fact that his relations
with her father were known to others
How had she come to believe that he was
a spy

  In a short time the situation grew clear-
er to him Louise had entered the library
while Warrington was in the act of giving
him the photograph of Montresor, and
this fact doubtless had excited suspicions
which she had communicated to Montre-
sor, either by telephone or a special mes-
senger

  This theory was, in some degree, veri-
fied by the manner in which Montresor
had demanded the surrender of the pho-
tograph With a more rapidly beating
heart, the young man thrust a hand into
the inner pocket of his coat The photo-
graph was gone, but this was not all he
had lost

  He had been robbed of the envelope
containing the three thousand dollars
which had been given to him by Warring-
ton !

  Bewildered, baffled, and thoroughly un-
strung by the suddenness with which this
series of unfortunate incidents had oc-
curred, Erskine rose weakly and looked
ahead of him with unseeing eyes For sev-
eral minutes he stood motionless then,
with shuffling, stumbling steps, he issued
from the clump of trees and followed the
course of the roadway

  He had proceeded only a few paccs
when he came to a drinking-fountain for
horses There, with shaking hands, he
washed his wound  then, after drying it
with his handkerchief, he continued on
in the direction of the lake front

  Frederick Erskine was young, and this
was the first time in his life that he had
come face to face with a heavy respon-

sibility He knew now that, young as he
was, the turning-point of his whole career
was reached Though he loathed the task
that had been forced upon him, it was im-
possible for him to shirk it

  For years he and his father had been
under obligations to Andrew Warrington,
and now Warrington, in distress, had ap-
pealed to him for aid He had under-
taken to recover the bonds, and, hopeless
as seemed the task, he must do so Be-
sides all this, lie had an account of his
own to settle with Charles Montresor

  But where was Montresor to be found
It now occurred to him that, in view of
his loss of the three thousand dollars
which had been given to him by War-
rington, he would have to draw on his
own funds for several days at least In
another week, perhaps, he might achieve
something which would enable him to
confess his loss to Warrington with a bet-
ter grace

  _ As this thought came to him, he halted
suddenly The extent of his own funds
consisted of little more than a hundred
dollars, which he had carried in a card-
case in one of the pockets of his vest To
this pocket he raised his hand instinct-
ively

  This, too, had been taken from him
while he lay unconscious! In a pocket
of his trousers were several silver coins,
however, and, clutching these, he resumed
his way with quickened steps

  “ Fair means or foul! ” he muttered,
repeating Warrington’s injunction
“ Well, the first blow in the fight was
struck by Montresor, and it was foul
More than this, the man already has
proved himself to be a diief If it takes
a rogue to catch a rogue, I’ll learn his
game and play it I have my orders, and
I’m going to take the old man at his word
By fair means or by foul I’m going to
land those bonds—and Montresor! ”

  Walking on now with steady steps,
Erskine began to formulate a plan of ac-
tion It was doubtful whether he could
find Montresor again without dogging the
step of Louise Warrington Well, he
would do this, then Beautiful as sjie
was, she had lost his respect, and had in-
spired his resentment From this moment
on he would work only in the interests of
her father But, in order to do this, he
would require funds He must write to
468

THE RAILROAD MAN’S MAGAZINE

Warrington, and tell him of the misad-
venture that had befallen him

  Upon leaving the park, the young man
boarded a car which took him to his hotel
Arriving there, he wrote a lett'r to An-
drew Warrington, describing briefly what
had happened This he despatched by a
messenger to Warrington’s residence In
an hour he had his answer

  From an envelope Erskine drew a sheet
of paper, in which were enclosed ten one-
hundred-dollar bank-notes On the sheet
of paper was written the following note:

  Dear Belleville :

    Enclosed herewith find $1,000 When
  you require more, inform me of the fact
  at once, but spare me all accounts of
  your troubles I desire no explanations
  Get to work and keep your confidences
  to yourself Burn this note at once

  The note was unsigned Erskine ap-
plied a lighted match to it, and then
dropped it into an ash-receiver When
the paper was consumed, he left the room
and summoned a cab

  “ Lake Shore Drive,” he said as he pre-
pared to step into the vehicle

  “What number” asked the driver

  “ Put me down at the beginning of the
drive,” directed Erskine “ But get there
as quickly as you can”

 When the Lake Shore Drive was
reached, Erskine directed the driver to
turn into a street about half a block south
of the Warrington residence and there
await his coming then, when the cab
moved off, he walked deliberately along
by the sea-wall until he arrived opposite
the street in which he saw the cab drawn
up at the spot which he had indicated

  Assured that the cabman was acting in
accordance with his instructions, Erskine
retraced his steps for a little distance
then, glancing around to satisfy himself
that he was unobserved, he climbed over
the sea-wall and dropped down to the
beach

  As has been said, the night was moon-,
less, and the stars which, before, had been
visible, now were obscured from view by
a mist which, for the last half-hour, had
been drifting over the lake and settling
down over the city A faint breeze was
stirring, and this was charged with the
dampness of the great lake over which it
had swept

  Finding a large boulder near him, Er-

skine was about to seat himself upon it,
and was in the act of drawing his cigar-
case from his pocket when he heard, in
the distance, the deep, sonorous stroke of
a bell This stroke was followed by oth-
ers, and when he had counted eleven they
ceased

  “ Eleven o’clock,” he mused “ If she
has not already returned, she—”

  He started suddenly as he became con-
scious of the fact that in the air about him
was the odor of tobacco-smoke He had
been gazing abstractedly into the dark-
ness that lay over the lake, but now he
turned abruptly to his left There he saw
something that was moving slowly toward
him

  It was the faint glow of a lighted cigar!

CHAPTER VI
The Man Behind the Cigar

“ANOTHER signal, eh” Erskine
muttered “ Shall I run it, or
slow down ”

  To his ears now came the soft, meas-
ured crunching of gravel, and the sound
warned him that, in the darkness, it would
be difficult for him to make a noiseless
retreat He decided, therefore, to remain
where he was

  The cigar which Erskine already had
taken from his case was between his teeth
He drew a match across the boulder on
which he was seated, and raised it to the
weed

  The sound of crunching gravel ceased,
and the glow of the cigar became station-
ary Keeping an eye over his left shoul-
der, Erskine lighted his own cigar and
waited

  “ Damp evening,” the young man said

  There was no reply, but a moment later
the gravel crunched again, and the glow-
ing tip of the cigar drew nearer

  “ Who the deuce are you ” growled the
stranger

  Erskine hesitated The voice was
heavier than Montresor’s, and he won-
dered if it was that of the man who had
struck him after he had received the blow
from the Englishman

  “ Well, it’s a little dark for the ex-
change of cards just now, I’m afraid,”
he said

  Again the stranger halted “If you’re
WITHOUT LIGHTS

469

one of them I’m talkin’ you for, I guess
you’re pretty much at home in dark
places,” the newcomer retorted

 “Indeed!” Erskine exclaimed
“ Would it be too much for me to ask who
it is that you take me to be”

  “ Oh, one of Montresor’s tribe, I sup-
pose,” replied the other surlily

  “ Then you are not a friend of Mon-
tresor’s, I take it,” said Erskine, puffing
thoughtfully at his cigar

  With a muttered curse, the stranger
slouched slowly past Erskine, who, watch-
ing him warily, retained his seat on the
boulder

  “ Don’t be in a hurry,” the young man
protested, as the other was in the act of
moving away The stranger halted

  “ What has caused you to think I am
a friend of Montresor’s” Erskine asked

  “Well, you know him, don’t ye”
asked the man, who spoke in the tone of
one who expected an affirmative answer

  For a moment Erskine hesitated Was
this man an enemy of the Englishman's,
or was he one of his confederates If
he was an enemy, it might be possible to
use him to advantage If he was a con-
federate, Erskine wanted to see him in
the light If he were not dissembling, it
was plain that he had some grievance
against Montresor, and that he had some
reason to suspect that Montresor or his
friends had some object in lurking in the
vicinity of the Warrington house

  “ I met Montresor for the firsts time, to-
night,” Erskine answered quietly “ The
meeting was quite accidental, on my part,
however, and I will frankly confess that
it was not altogether to my liking From
the way you have spoken of him, I should
judge that you know rather more of him
than I do

  “ If you have a grudge against him,
I’m in a mood to help you to get even
If you can persuade me hat e really isn’t
a bad fellow, why, then, perhaps—”

  “ You’re in'a mood- to help me to get
even, hey” muttered the stranger
thoughtfully “Well, I hadn’t thought
anything about tryin’ to get even, and it
wouldn’t do me no good, as far as 1 can
see Snake-killin’ ain’t in my line when
there’s better business to be done What’s
Montresor done to you”

  “Oh he and one of his friends
knocked me out and robbed me of a tidy

bunch of money—that’s all,” Erskine an-
swered carelessly

  “ Robbed ye of a tidy bunch of
money!” exclaimed the stranger, and
there was a note of incredulity in his
voice “ 1 guess you’re just a little bit
off on that, ain’t ye, mister Montresor
is about as rank a scoundrel as ever wore
the devil’s brand, but highway robbery—
well, 1 reckon he’ll sort of keep above that
for a while—if he can Where did it
happen ”

  “ in Lincoln Park

  “ When was it, mister ”

  “ To-night”

  The stranger drew nearer Erskine, as
he asked: “ You was walkin’ through the
park ”

   “ I had been riding in a carriage, but I
had a disagreement with the person with
whom I had been sitting, and I ',ot out
As the carriage moved away, Montresor
and a companion attacked me, and did
me up When 1 recovered consciousness
my money was gone”

  “ The deuce it was! ” the stranger mut-
tered  then, after a pause, he added:
“ Well, mister, you ain’t the only one
Montresor robbed to-night”

  “ What do you mean ” demanded Er-
skine, vainly striving to see the outlines
of the other’s face in the darkness

  “ 1 mean lie robbed me of my job,”
the stranger answered sullenly

  “Indeed! What kind of a job was
that”

  “ Until two hours ago I was coachman
for Mr Warrington”

  Erskine started “ You were the coach-
man of Andrew Warrington” he ex-
claimed

  “ Yes, sir,” sighed the man

  Erskine rose slowly from the boulder
on which he had been sitting “ Then
you drove the carriage from which I
stepped only a moment before Montresor
assaulted me,” he said

  “ Hey! What do you mean by that”
the stranger muttered

  “ 1 mean that the carriage from which
I stepped was Mr Andrew W'arring-
ton’s”

  “ There ain’t no carriage or horse of
Mr Warrington’s left his place to-
night”

  “ Come, come, my man—you’re wrong
A t half past seven—”
470

THE RAILROAD MAN’S MAGAZINE

  “ At half past seven o’clock to-night
Mr Warrington’s carriage, with me on
the box, was in front of the house, waitin’
to take Miss Warrington to the Audito-
rium but Miss Warrington weren’t
there She’d gone off in another rig what
drove up before, and then— But, Lord
love us mister—you ain’t the gentleman
—the gentleman Mr Warrington said
went with her instead of him! It weren’t
Miss Warrington you had that disagree-
ment with before you left that carriage! ”
“ Yes,” Erskine answered shortly

  “ Where is she now ” asked the stran-
ger in a voice that shook a little

  “ She drove oft' while I was being at-
tacked by Montresor”

  “ How did you know it was Montresor,
sir ”

  “ I had his picture in my pocket But
now let me know a little more of your-
self You have been discharged by Mr
Warrington, you say ”

  “ Yes, sir—after servin’ him for twelve
years”

  “ Why did he discharge you ”

  “ Because I had been takin’ Miss War-
rington’s orders too faithful—drivin’ her
to houses of Montresor’s friends, without
tellin’ Mr Warrington afterward, and
sometimes takin’ messages from her to
Montresor”

  “ Where did you deliver those messages
to Montresor ”

  “ Sometimes he or some of his friends
would wait for them here”

  “ Do you know where he lives”

  “ No, sir He’s too foxy to let any one
know- that I don’t believe that even
Miss Warrington knows where Montre-
sor lives”

  There was a pause then Erskine
asked: “ Miss Warrington seems to be
pretty fond of this fellow Montresor,
does she not  ”

  “ Why, I can’t say much as to that,
sir,” returned the other doubtfully “ She
meets him pretty often, and she sends him
letters but somehow, when they are to-
gether she’s as cold as ice to him, and he’s
the only one I ever saw her snappish to
She’s a fine young lady, sir and what use
she could find fer a feller like Montre-
sor 1 never could quite figure out” He
paused  then, speaking abstractedly, he
added: “ There’s something queer about
the thing, and no mistake, sir—but there’s

something that makes me think that Miss
Warrington has little likin’ for that
sneakin’ Englishman”

  For a minute neither spoke Erskine
was the first to break the silence

  “ From the way you have spoken, I
should judge that you were well disposed
to Miss Warrington,” he said

  “ I’d fight a dozen husky chaps at once
at a single word from her, sir,” replied
the former coachman  then, after a pause,
he growled: “ And if I didn’t lick ’em
they’d have to take me away in an under-
taker’s wagon, for I’d die without a
whimper if 1 thought I was savin’ her
from enemies”

  “ What’s your name, my friend” Er-
skine asked

  “ Barney McGrane, sir”

  “ What'were your wages while you were
working for Mr Warrington”

  “ Forty dollars a month”

  “ I will give you fifty”

  “ What to do, sir ”

  “ To help me land this infernal scoun-
drel, Montresor” '

  McGrane hesitated “ Perhaps you are
a detective,” he said doubtfully

  “Not a professional detective but it
is my purpose to do a little detective work
on my own account for the next two or
three weeks, and Montresor is the man
I am after”

  “ You are going to get back your money
if you can ”

  “ No I’m afraid the three thousand
will have to go by the board Montresor
has got away with a far bigger sum than
that—a lot of bonds that belong to a
friend of mine Those are what I am
seeking now, and I think that you can
aid me in my effort to recover them In-,
cidentally, 1 think that between us we
will be able to get Miss Warrington out
of the clutches of Montresor for it
seems clear enough that he has some sort
of hold over her Will you help me”
“ Well, I don’t know, sir,” McGrane
replied doubtfully “ How long have
you known Miss Warrington”

  “ I met her for the first time to-night”
“ And Mr Warrington knew that you
were going with her to the Auditorium,”
said McGrane thoughtfully

  “ Yes I have known Mr Warrington
for several years”

  “ Well, that’s good enough for me,”
WITHOUT LIGHTS

471

McGrane replied “ Mr Warrington
wouldn’t have ’et her go off with you if
he didn’t think you was all right But
what was it that you and Miss Warring-
ton disagreed about ”

  “ Montresor”

  “ Then, she was going to meet him in
the park That’s the reason she had that
other rig call for her before I had time
to get around’1

   “ It looks like it, Barney”

  “ I’m with you, sir When do you
want me to begin”

  “ Right now”

  “ What am I to do ”

  “ You are to follow implicitly all in-
structions that I may give you More-
over, as I am pledged to secrecy in this
affair, you are to ask me for no explana-
tions other than those which may be nec-
essary to enable us to work in harmony
with one another Will you agree to
this ”

   “ Yes, sir”

  “ Let us shake hands on it, then”

  As their hands met in the darkness, Mc-
Grane started and drew back suddenly

   “ Get your heel on that cigar,” he whis-
pered

  “ What is it  ” Erskine asked as he
dropped his lighted cigar to the ground
and placed his foot upon it

  “ Hark! ”

  Then the young railroad man heard it,
too—the low-speaking voice of an ad-
vancing man!

  “ It’s some of the Montresor crowd,”
whispered McGrane, as he laid a hand
on one of the arms of his companion
“ This is one of their meeting - places
Let’s move 011 a bit until they stop”

CHAPTER VII
On the Shoals of Indecision

Vf/ITH a more rapidly beating pulse,
Erskine turned to the left, and
followed by his companion, he moved
cautiously along the beach in the same
direction in which the unseen newcom-
ers were proceeding At length he halt-
ed abruptly as the hand of McGrane
clutched his sleeve

  “ Wait! ” whispered McGrane “ They
have stopped where we were standing”

  As tfrskine listened, he found that the

sounds of voices and footsteps had sud-
denly ceased

   “ Want to hear what they’re sayin' -
asked McGrane, after a pause

  “ Yes Let’s get a little closer to
them,” Erskine answered

   “ Where the devil’s the boat ” a voice
only a few paces distant asked querulous-
ly’

  Erskine and McGrane instinctively
sank to their hands and knees McGrane
tapped his companion twice 011 the shoul-
der

  “  es—yes!” Erskine whispered

  Both had recognized the voice of Mon,
tresor

    I’m afraid that you’re going a bit too
far this time, Monty,” growled another
voice

  “ Have to do it, Slevin,” Montresor
replied in a tone of gloomy conviction

   The fool’s streak of yellow is growing
so strong that every hour finds him more
dangerous It’s ten to one that he will
blow the whole thing to the old man be-
fore the night is over The girl half sus-
pects the truth already, and if she learns
it all there will be Hades to pay”

    But she played into your hands all
right to-night, Monty,” protested the oth-
er in shaking accents

   “ She had to,” Montresor retorted sav
agely “ She failed to meet me afterward,
however, and for the last three days it
has looked to me as if she had the bit be-
tween her teeth The way she gave the
old man the slip to-night is going to bring
them into another clash that is likely to
be the worst she has had with him”

   “ Well, she weathered all the others,”
Slevin said

   “ In a Way she did, but it seeitfs to me
that he already has her on the run It’s
clear enough that she let something out
of the bag'If she hasn’t, how does it
happen that the old man has hit my trail
How did it happen that that fool sleuth
had my photograph in his pocket Why
did the old man send him off with her
In some manner or other he got wind of
the fact that she was to meet me some-
where, and lie wanted the sleuth to get a
line on me and follow me if lie could
Oh the game was plain enough”

   To the ears of the listeners there came
the sounds of several muttered words,
which, however, were unintelligible A
472

THE RAILROAD MAN’S MAGAZINE

long pause followed, then the man who
had been addressed as Slevin spoke

  “ The Inter-State’s got the paper ” he
asked

  “ Yes”

  “ But it doesn’t deliver at Tacoma”

  “ It transfers to the Dale at Wapiti
Falls If we leave at six we can beat it
out”

  There was another pause then Slevin
asked:

  “ Are all the eggs in one basket  ”

  “ All in the machine-box But why in
the deuce doesn’t the boat—”

  “ Hark! ” Slevin exclaimed in a voice
that barely reached the ears of Erskine
and his companion, who, though they lis-
tened intently, failed to hear the sound
or sounds that had startled the speaker

  For a moment all Avas still then Er-
skine and McGrane heard the sounds of
retreating footsteps

  “What’s the game” whispered Mc-
Grane

  “ Hush ! ” Erskine cautioned

  From out of the darkness that con-
cealed the waters of the lake came the
low, measured click of oarlocks A mo-
ment later two low whistles sounded from
the beach These were answered by two
whistles from the unseen boat, then all
was still

  “ Come—let’s follow them,” Erskine
muttered

  They had taken only a few steps, how-
ever, when they were brought to a stand-
still by the sudden flare of a match about
fifty paces in front of them

  “ They’ve stopped,” said Erskine quiet-
ly “ If we—”

  Startled by the sounds of quick foot-
steps near the sea-wall above him, Er
skine allowed the rest of the sentence to
die upon his lips

  Though the beach was so dark that it
was impossible for Erskine to see the
features of his companion, the light from
a lamp on the drive enabled him to see
the outlines of the face of a man who now-
leaned over the wall

  McGrane grasped the arm of his com-
panion

  “ Joe Warrington! ” he exclaimed in a
warning voice

  Moving quickly closer to the wall, Er-
skine and McGrane watched the man who
was bending over it

  For a moment Warrington seemed to
hesitate then, with a rapid movement,
he swung himself over the wall and down
to the beach

  A score of warning voices now seemed
to be sounding in Erskine’s ears Not
for a moment did he doubt that the men
whose voices he had heard were medita-
ting some act of foul play against the
young man who was preparing to meet
them

  It was essential that young Warring-
ton should be warned, but how was this
to be done without revealing the fact that
the words, of Montresor and his compan-
ion had been overheard

   If the nature of this conversation was
revealed to Warrington, would he give
the story credence If this should not
be sufficient to shake his faith in Mon-
tresor, was it not probable that he would
acquaint the Englishman with the fact
that his conversation had been overheard 
If he did this, there might yet be time
to effect some change in the plans which
had been partly disclosed by the conver-
sation in the darkness

  And so Fred Erskine found himself on
the shoals of indecision He must decide
quickly, and he must stand or fall by rea-
son of the action which, with only a few
moments for reflection, he must now de-
cide to take

  Joe Warrington’s feet had scarcely
touched • the gravel of the beach when
Erskine strode quickly toward him

  Young Warrington, hearing the sounds
of his steps, turned sharply

  “Montresor” he queried in a low
voice

  “ Yes—Montresor,” Erskine answered
in a low, tense voice

  Scarcely had the Altoona man spoken
when his right fist shot out and, crash-
ing against the side of Warrington’s head,
sent him reeling to the wall Quickly
following his staggering victim, Erskine
struck him two more blows that felled
him to the ground, where he lay uncon-
scious

  A hoarsely muttered oath behind him
caused him to turn suddenly, and a mo-
ment later he dodged a blow which Mc-
Grane aimed at his head

   “ What devil’s game is this you’re play-
ing” demanded the astonished coach-
man
WITHOUT LIGHTS

473

  “ Hush! ” commanded Erskine, and as
he spoke he gripped McGrane’s wrists

  It was in vain that the coachman
strained every muscle to regain his lib-
erty

  “ What’s your game, you infernal—”
McGrane began

  “Stop it!” Erskine muttered “We
have no time for explanations and you
promised to ask for none We have saved
this man’s life, and it is now up to both
of us to keep him from losing something
that is still more valuable He will re-
cover presently, and when he does we
must see to it that he believes that he was
struck down by Montresor”

  From the point at which the flare of
the match had been seen only a moment
before, came the sound of a low whistle
Erskine and McGrane stood silently be-
side the inanimate body of Joe Warring-
ton

  At length the whistle was repeated
then Erskine heard the sound of advan-
cing footsteps

  “You there Joe” came a voice

  “ Steer him off,” directed Erskine, ad-
dressing McGrane “ Tell him it was you
who just came over the wall”

  The coachman muttered something un-
der his breath then, after a brief hesita1
tion, he advanced slowly to meet the un-
seen speaker

  “ I ain’t the man you’re after, Mr
Montresor,” McGrane said doggedly

  “ What the devil are you doing here,
McGrane  ”

  “ Same as you, I guess,” the coachman
growled

  “ Did any one send you here ”

  “ No I ain’t takin’ no orders from no
one to-night”

  “ Was that you who just got over the
wall  ”

  “ I couldn’t have got down here with-
out gettin’ over the wall” the coachman
grumbled

   “ All right, Barney,” returned the other,
more civilly than he had spoken before

  “ Are ye lookin’ for young- Mr War=
rington?” the coachman asked.

  “ No—no—not particularly,” Montre-
sor answered quickly “ I've met him
here before, you know, and I—”

  “ Yes—I know,” McGrane answered
bitterly

  “ Well, good night, Barney.”-

  The coachman made no reply Er-
skine, listening intently, heard the sounds
of retreating footsteps As these died
away, McGrane slowly returned to where
his companion awaited him

  “ Now, what does all this mean, sir?”
the coachman asked

  “It means—” Erskine began, and
stopped

  From that part of the beach toward
which Montresor had retreated came a
low, scraping sound, and a sullen, mut-
tering voice This was followed by a
silence which was broken at last by the
click of oarlocks

   “ It means that the body of this young
man will not be weighted and dropped
overboard from that boat to-night,” Fred

The Philosophy of Ananias

A LOW groan, followed by a faint
clattering of stones, indicated that
the prostrate man was stirring

   “ Now, keep your head, Barney, and let
me do the talking,” cautioned Erskine, as
he knelt down beside Warrington

   “ All right, sir,” the coachman assented
gruffly

  As Joe Warrington rose to his elbow
Erskine’s hand fell on his shoulders.

  “Are you feeling better now?” the
man from Altoona asked

  “ Wrho—what has happened? ” faltered
the bewildered victim of the assault
Then, as his thoughts grew clearer, he
asked sharply : “ Is that you, Montresor?”

   “ No, it is not Montresor, but a friend,”
Erskine answered dryly

•	“ But it was Montresor who—”

  “ Yes—yes—it was Montresor who put
you where you are,” explained Erskine,
who, acting on the theory that the end
would justify the means, found fiction
better adapted to his purpose than truth

  With an oat-h young Warrington rose
“ Well, who are you? ” he asked.

  “ There are two of us,” Erskine an-
swered “ I am a stranger to you. The
man who is with me is Barney McGrane”

“ McGrane ! ” Warrington exclaimed.

  “ Yes, sir,” spoke up the coachman.
“ Your father was just after firin’ me
when I picked up with this here gentle-

man, and he had the kindness to offer me
a job of—”

  “ Of helping me drive off the chaps
who had just assaulted you,” put in
Erskine quickly “ If it wasn’t for the
assistance of McGrane, your friend, Mon-
tresor, and two or three others of his
kind would have had you in a boat that
put off from the shore just before you
recovered consciousness”

  “They put off in a boat!” muttered
Warrington wonderingly

  “ Yes. Before you were assaulted,
however, I overheard a little of a conver-
sation that they had here on the beach
From what they said I had some reason
to believe that they distrusted you and
thought it best to put you out of the way”
“ They did, eh? ” growled young War-
rington Then, after a pause, he added:
“ Was that all you heard? ”

  “No. I heard enough to cause me to
understand that if you don’t make a
prompt and vigorous effort to get out
of the trap into which they have led you,
it would have been much better for you if
you had remained in their hands and been
cast overboard after they had rowed you
well out into the lake”

  “ You mean that I would be better
dead? ”

  “ Exactly.”

  “ Then I am afraid that I have small
reason to thank you for getting me out of
their hands,” said W'arrington gloomily.

  “ On the contrary, I think I may earn
at least a small measure of your grati-
tude, for I believe that I can put you in
the way of saving something that should
be more valuable to you than your life”

  “ Indeed! And what is that? ”

  “ Your honor—and your father’s.”

  For a while the silence was unbroken,
then, in a hoarser voice, young Warring-
ton asked;

  “ What do you mean? ”

  “ The return of certain valuable bonds
which recently disappeared from a place
to which you had access”

  Again a silence fell Erskine heard
the heavy breathing of the man he was
addressing

  “ You know too much,” Warrington
grumbled

  “It is little enough,” Erskine answered
easily “ Still, I think that with the
knowledge that I have obtained I will

have little difficulty in running down the
men I am after, and restoring the bonds
to the place from which they were ta-
ken”

  “You are a detective?” Warrington
asked

“ No. I am a special agent of a per-
son who is scarcely less interested than
you are in the restoration of the bonds”
There was another pause; then War-,
rington asked:

  “ In whose interests are you working? ”
  “ In your own.”

  “ Who has employed you?”

  “ I cannot tell you.”

  A muttered oath fell from Warring-
ton’s lips,and he addressed the coachman:
“ Barney, who is this man? ” he demand-
ed

  “ Never heard his name in my life, but
I think lie’s right when he says he’s a
friend of yours, sir,” replied McGrane
dubiously

  “ Did you hear any of the talk that this
gentleman says he overheard, Barney—
Montresor’s talk about getting me out
of the way? ” Joe asked.

  “ A little of it, sir, but no names was
mentioned, and I didn’t suspect that it
was you they was puttin’ up a job 011,”
the coachman replied

  Joe muttered something in an under-
tone and began to move slowly in the di-
rection in which Montresor had retreated
Erskine stepped quickly after him and
laid a restraining hand 011 his arm

  “ It will be better if you should give
me your confidence, Mr. Warrington,”
Erskine said quietly

  Joe turned quickly “ No, confound
you, I’ll give no man my confidence—
after what has happened to-night,” he
growled “ If what you and McGrane
have said is true, I’ve got a bone to pick
with Montresor, and the sooner I get to
work the better”

  “ True,” Erskine assented, “ and if
you can be made to understand that your
interests and mine are one in this affair
you will learn that you can work better
with' my aid than without it”

  Warrington’s hand fell heavily 011 Er-
skine’s shoulder and shook it angrily

  “Come, now—speak out!” he ex-
claimed “ What kind of game is this
you’re playing You say you have saved
me from Montresor, and in return you

demand my confidence Why You ap-
pear to be an absolute stranger to me
What interest have you, then, in my af-
fairs ”

  “ I am interested in your affairs only
so far as they have to do with mine Less
than twelve hours ago I applied for a po-
sition in the service of the C, S L and
W I was told that my employment by
the company was conditional upon my
ability to recover the bonds which disap-
peared five days ago from the office of
the company’s treasurer I have under
taken to restore these bonds to the place
from which they were taken, and I will
do so—with or without your aid”

  “ You have a line on them, I suppose,
said Warrington sarcastically

  “ If I had not a line on them, I should
scarcely have appeared here so oppor-
tunely for you to-night,” answered Er-
skine shortly “ If you want me to fight
you, as well as Montresor, I'm ready to
take on the game If you will aid me in
getting those bonds back to the vault in
such a manner that no one will know how
they got there, you will have everything
to gain and nothing to lose”

  “ You mean that you will cause them to
be returned by stealth! ” exclaimed the
astonished Warrington

  “Exactly!”

  “ But how ”

  “ That will be your affair”

  “ You mean that you will give the
bonds to me ”

  “ Conditionally—yes”

  “ And what are the conditions ”

  “ There is only one The bonds must
be returned to the vault in ray presence,
and when this is done you must leave the
place with me”

  “ After which you will report that you
found me with the goods,” Joe retorted
skeptically

  “ No So long as the missing bonds
are returned to the place from which
they were taken, it matters not to me who
was responsible for their disappearance
If they are not returned within thirty
days, the exposure and punishment of the
thief must follow”

  “ Am I to understand, then, that if
the bonds are returned within thirty days,
no effort will be made to expose or pun-,
ish the man who took them from the
vault”

  “ Yes, you are to understand just
that”

  For a moment young Warrington was
silent then, in a voice that shook a little,
he said :

  “ You have been assigned to this case
by my father ”

  “ I have told you that I am working in
the interest of your father—and yours
That is all that I can tell you now”
Again Warrington hesitated “ You
have said that you have a line on the
bonds,” he returned “ I)o you mean
that you know in whose possession they
are now  ”

   “ Yes”

  “ You suspect that Montresor has
them ”

  “No I know that they are not in the
possession of Montresor” Erskine an-
swered quietly

  “ Not in the possession of Montresor! ”
exclaimed Warrington, with some sharp-
ness

  “ No He parted with them to-day A
few days hence he will have them again,
unless—”

  “ Unless—” put in Warrington, eag-
erly

  “ Unless they fall into our hands,”
Erskine explained

  “ And you think that—that you—”
faltered young Warrington

  “ I have told you that I would get
them,” Erskine answered firmly “ Am
I to have you with me or against me  ”
Joe hesitated for a moment, then he
turned to the coachman, who, standing
apart from the others was ignorant of
the subject of their conversation

  “ McGrane, you have said that my
father discharged you from his service
to-night,” he said “ What was his rea-
son for doing so  ”

  And now it was the coachman’s turn
to hesitate “ Because I disobeyed his
orders,” he replied

  “ Was that disobedience in regard to
any matter that had to do with me”

  “ No, sir, but it had to do with Mr
Montresor”

  “With Montresor”

  “ Yes, sir—Mr Montresor and Miss
Warrington Mr Warrington told me
to report to him whenever I drove Miss
Warrington to houses at which I had
reason to believe she met Mr Montresor
476

THE RAILROAD MAN’S MAGAZINE

Miss Warrington told me not to do so

I did as she told me, sir, and so dis-
■ ibeyed Mr Warrington To-night he
found me out, and then he fired me”

  The words that fell from the lips of
young Warrington were so low as to be
unintelligible For a moment no one
spoke, then J oe said :

  “ It served you right, McGrane”

  “ I think it did, sir,” replied the
coachman penitently

  Speaking huskily, young Warrington
addressed Erskine “ Does my father
suspect that—that I—” he faltered, and
stopped

  “ He has not said so,” the Altoona
man replied

  “ Do you think it would be better for
me to go to him ” Joe asked

  “ No Under the circumstances, I
think it would be better to give your con-
fidence to me”

  In the darkness Erskine felt a trem-
bling hand close around his own “ You
shall have it, then, but not here,” he an-
swered, in a low voice

  Erskine knew that his relation to the
■elder Warrington was suspected, but
that what Joseph Warrington had to tell
him was not for the ears of Barney Mc-
Grane In the game that was to be
played, however, the coachman must
have a part, but he must be kept in ig-
norance of its full significance

  Erskine thought quickly “ I have a
carriage waiting only a few steps from
here,” he said “ Follow' me to it, but
keep well behind me What we do must

(To be co

be done quickly The trail is hot to-
night, and by the time the sun is up two
of us must be several hundred miles from
here”

  As he finished speaking, Erskine clam-
bered to the top of the sea-wall A mo-
ment later he had disappeared

  “ Barney, did you ever meet that chap
anywhere before to-night” Joe asked as
he and the coachman prepared to mount
the wall

   “ Never, sir, but there’s something about
him that makes me feel as how he’s like
to prove a good friend of you and Mr
Warrington”

  “ Did he see my father this evening ”
“ Yes, sir, and Mr Warrington told
him to take Miss Warrington to the
opera, but Miss Warrington got him into
a carriage that was sent by Montresor,
and a few minutes later Montresor laid
that fellow out in Lincoln Park That
shows, I guess, that Montresor knows
he’s dangerous, and is afraid that he—”
With an exclamation of pain and
amazement, the coachman started back,
then, with a loud, hoarse cry of rage,
he grappled with a dark body that
had flung itself upon him in the dark-
ness A keen pain darted through his
left shoulder, andx a moment later his
sinewy thumbs sank deep into the yield-
ing flesh of a human throat But it was
not from that throat that issued the long-
drawn shriek that reached the ears of
Erskine and caused him to halt abrupt-
ly on the sidewalk on the other side of
the Lake Shore Drive

  A Night in the R P O

BY WILLARD D EAKIN

PERHAPS the most romantic, but at the same time, the most difficult
position on the cars behind the steam-horse is that of mail-clerk,
especially if it be a cold, windy night, and the train is making up time
In this article the author has described just such a run on the “ Line and Bill
R P O” It took half a dozen engineers to make the trip, but the mail-clerks
had to stick it out Talk of cold and hunger— Just light the pipe and hook
onto this yarn

What One Man Encountered Sticking Letters and Throwing Papers in
a Fifteen Hours’ Run on a Car with a Broken Coupling,
Fourteen Hours Late

I

T is a long run from Lincoln to
Billings, and we mail-weigh-
ers and the colored Pullman
porters were the only ones
who made it It took five
or six engineers to cover the
trip, and there were three division points
where the conductors and brakemen
changed

  Edgemont, South Dakota, divided the
“ east end ” from the “ west end ” of
the “ Line and Bill R P O,” and here
the weary mail-clerk who had been stick-
ing letters and throwing papers through-
out the fifteen hours’ run from Lincoln
gave over his responsibilities to a fresh
clerk, who would carry the run on
through to Billings

  But we weighers went 011 at two in
the afternoon, in the yards at Lincoln,
where the mail-car stood until train 43
took it out of town at six, and we were
on duty during the thirty-four hours un-
til we reached Billings at midnight, the
second night out 'That was when we

were scheduled to arrive, but we were
often so late that our twenty-hour lay-
over in Billings was greatly shortened
As one old weigher expressed it, we fre-
quently “ nearly met ourselves coming
back”

  Everything went wrong 011 this par-
ticular trip In the first place, when we
went to our car that day we found an
old-time-r with oil lamps and no steam
from the engine taking the place of one
of our modern cars which had been
burned up in a recent wreck at Aurora

  VVe were in the habit of bringing
along bacon and eggs or similar raw
materials for our meals during the thirty-
hour run depending upon the little gas-
stove, with which each modern car is
equipped, to cook them

  Without the stove, the prospect was
that we would have a serious famine be-
fore reaching Billings, for the most
edible article in our grub-boxes was raw
eggs Then it was in February, and the
prospect of keeping the atmosphere at

a comfortable temperature was not en-
couraging

  At Germantown, the first station out
of Lincoln, the engineer started up too
suddenly for the fourteen cars he was
hauling and broke the front draw-bar of
our car Then they fastened us onto the
rear end with a chain, and as 43 always
ran local on the east end, we had an in-
teresting though not pleasant series of
sudden stops and starts

Some Work to Cook

  That night we managed to boil some
potatoes and eggs by hanging a bucket
inside of the Baker heater, but in doing
this we used up all of our kindling to
make the fire hot enough, and during
the night the fire went out while the
clerk and I were working at the far end
of the car

  At Grand Island, we laid over eight
hours while the track was being cleared
of a freight wreck, and the next day at
three we plowed into a blizzard at Alli-
ance, breakfastless, dinnerless, cold, and
without kindling

  The clerk had been 011 duty for near-
ly forty-eight hours, having taken a
friend’s run for him, and as he had to
double back at Edgemont with only an
hour’s lay over, he decided h<* could
sleep if he couldn’t eat, so he made up
his cot on the rack and rolled in

  As the R M S had lost its romance
and become a sad reality, he viewed
with 110 alarm the prospect of being dis-
charged from the service, and, therefore,
had 110 hesitation about allowing me to
work the mail over his “ slip,” thus ta-
king the responsibility of my errors

  As soon as he decided to sleep, I
initiated myself as a mail-clerk, being
glad of the opportunity to get the ex-
perience and hoping that having some-
thing to do would make me forget my
hunger and the cold

On the Job

  So while he snored away in his im-
provised berth on the paper - rack, I
worked the local from station to station,
exchanged pouches, weighed them “ on ”
and “ off,” and recording the results on
my weight blanks At Crawford I got a

jacketed “ register,” wrote it up in the
book over the clerk’s signature, and
chucked it into the “ Chey and Spoke ”
pouch

  The oil lamps had begun to play out,
and by this time only one little flicker-
ing flame was left, at the upper left cor-
ner of the letter-case By its light I got
Crawford tied out with numb fingers
From the station-agent there, I got some
oil to replenish my lights, but did not
have time to fill the lamps

  Between Crawford and Edgemont
there were two “ catch stations,” where
the pouches were hooked in from a
crane by the catching device in the mail-
car door

  Such a station is not viewed with very
much joy by a mail-clerk at any time,
and they would be especially hard for
me to make that night We were four-
teen cars away from the engine, and ow-
ing to the wind it was impossible to hear
the whistles indicating our approach to
the stations

  It was necessary, therefore, to keep a
constant lookout for the lights These
could not be seen far through the stormy
night, and I had to keep both side doors
open and cross to each one every few
minutes

At Catch Stations

  The wind had been blowing in for some
time 1 happened across a package in the
mails with one end open, and, strange to
say it contained a thermometer I took
this out and found that it registered four
above zero

  I was soon chilled to the bone The
wind swept cinders and fine, hard snow
through the big open doors

  I did not know which side the crane
was on at Ardmore, the first of the
catch stations, but, as 1 remembered that
there was only a station-house and a
water-tank in the town, both of them at
a safe distance from the track, I tied
one catcher in place before we reached
the crane While I was crossing the car
to raise the other catcher arm, the pouch
slammed into my trap, and Ardmore was
off my mind

But at Dewey, the other catch station,

I couldn't do this (Inly three days before
I had seen a catcher arm straightened

back alongside the car from having
hooked into the Dewey coal-shed

  That coal-shed was the bane of the
mail-clerk’s life on the “ Line and Bill”
Setting so close to the track that the mail-
car could not pass it with the catcher arm
raised, and so near the
crane that the arm had
to be raised the moment
the shed was passed, it
made Dewey the hardest
catch on the run

  I had to keep an
almost constant lookout
ahead for Dewey, as she
would whiz past and
disappear into the
stormy darkness behind

It was an hour’s run
from Ardmore, I knew,
by schedule, but against
the storm we were not
making anything like
schedule time

  When I had waited
an hour, during which
time I took advantage of
the opportunity to fix up
my lights, I had no way
of telling how much
longer it would take to
get there, so I stood in
the door and strained my
eyes for a yellow light,
waist-high and close be-
side the track

  Thus another half
hour passed by, but only
some red and green
switch-lights were seen

As 1 had never given
any notice to these be-
fore, I was unable to
identify them and so de-
termine where we were

But as I knew that there
would be no others
within at least a mile or
two of them, those of
Dewey would not show
up for a few minutes, and I left tlie door
to consult the rear shack

  As I unbolted the front door of the
car and opened it, a blinding swirl of
snow and wind nearly carried me off the
platform, as I stepped across the clear
space that the chain allowed between the

two cars I stepped over the iron gate
into the vestibule of the Pullman and
found the brakeman asleep in the smo-
king-room

  “Where are we” I asked when I
had succeeded in waking him

  “ Well, now, how do you suppose I
know,” he said, “ when I’ve been asleep
for the last half-hour”

  I told him about the switch-lights, but
he couldn’t identify them from my de-
scription so I clambered back into the
mail-car and resumed my watch

THE ENGINEER STARTED UP TOO SUDDENLY
480

THE RAILROAD MAN'S MAGAZINE

WHERE ARE WE 1 ASKED, WHEN
1 HAD SUCCEEDED IN WAKING HIM

  We were fourteen hours late, and run-
ning hard to make up time If I leaned
out and got my ear to the proper angle,
there came now and then a feeble grunt
from somewhere up ahead through the
storm, seemingly miles away, which might
or might not be the whistle of the engine

Cold and Mighty Hungry

  That the engine was ahead was made
clear by the fusillade of cinders that
pelted me in the face My eyes inflamed
and smarted as if they were freezing
with the lids held open 1 could feel
my limbs getting blue and stiff, and the
flapping of the thin trousers against them
in the wind made a friction which, 1 re-
member, seemed welcome for the warm-
ing sensation it gave

  Several times I felt that I had reached
the limit of physical endurance, but I
was determined to make that catch or
freeze in the attempt, though I was so
hungry that I wondered whether I would
freeze or starve first

   This mental pro-
 cess was performed
 with a smile that
 seemed to crack my
 frost-stiffened face
 But just when I had
 decided to give it up
 and close the doors,
 after taking a last
 hard look ahead, the
 light of the crane
 burst out of the
 storm fairly upon
 me I had just time
 to raise the catcher
 w h e n the pouch
 slammed into it

   My troubles were
 not over, but it was
 good to have the
 doors shut again,
 and, after running
 up and down the car
 to get warm, 1
 clawed through the
 “local” for Edge-
 mont, got her tied
 out, and awakened
 the clerk just as we
 were pulling in to
 that station

 Twenty - four hours without food or
sleep, blue and chattering with the cold,
I was pessimistic enough to predict that
the “ west-end ” clerk, knowing nothing
of our situation and counting on the regu-
lar steam-heated car, with its gas-stove,
would have only potatoes, bacon, and
eggs in his grub-box My pessimism was
proven, except that he had steak instead
of the eggs

 But a ray of hope came to me when
I heard the brakeman say, as he passed
our door going up ahead, something about
turning the mail-car

 They were going to turn us around and
couple us up with the good draw-bar at
the other end of the car, so as to dispense
with the chain connection

Hustling for Grub

   I reported the happy prospect to the
clerk, asking the significant question, how
long it would probably take to turn the
car around, in the hope that he would
make the prospect even more happy
A NIGHT IN THE R P ()

481

   “ Good idea,” he said, “ and if you’re
so all-fired hungry as you say you are,
why not run up-town while they’re turn-
ing the car—it’ll take about a quar-
ter of an hour—and get some eatable stuff
at the bakery that won’t have to be
cooked You’re not supposed to leave
the car, you know, but maybe I’ll want a
bite myself before we get in, and I’ll not
squeal on you”

  As I was hungry to the most absolute
degree, 1 fell for the proposition at once
I hurried up-town, bought the eatables,
and charged back down to the depot,
with a pie under each arm and a can of
beans in my pocket

  But when I turned the corner at the
station, and began the final dash Tor the
train, I saw that the traek was empty

   About a half mile toward Billings were
the rear lights of 43, getting dimmer
every second I was left That was all

  Would the clerk weigh up the
mail and sign in for me at Billings,
and persuade the other clerk to sign
me out and do my work on the re-
turn trip, or would I be found out
for having left the car and dfs-
charged from the service And
w ould the penalty
stop even there

  What was the law
in such a case Was
it not a criminal of-
fense to go off buying
pies and neglect the
care of Uncle Sam’s
mail

  But, as usually
happens in such a •
case, I was perfectly
calm, and resigned my-
self to fate I couldn’t
help feeling that pos-
sibly I hadn’t fully
realized the serious-
ness of my situation

  Meanwhile, h o w -
ever, I would drop
back up-town and
have a good, hot sup-
per and a comfortable
bed for the night at
the railroad hotel I
had gone half a block
when a hopeful idea
struck me The

    7	R R

Deadwood and Edgemont train, known
to mail-clerks as the “ Dead and Edge,”
was on track No 2, and they always
waited for us before they left town, as
they depended upon 43 for all their pas-
sengers and express, as well as all mail
matter

  1 looked back to the station just in
time to see the truckman fling the last
tie-sack of paper-mail into the compart-
ment-car, and the engineer was climbing
into the cab Again I made a dash for
the depot, retaining the pies and beans,
and startled the con in the act of giving
the highball

  “ Did 43 turn his mail-car ” I gasped
anxiously

  “ Not yet,” he replied  “ they’re going
to turn her out at the ‘ Y’ ”

  “How far out is it” 1 asked, while
the engineer looked back for his signal
to get out of town

can you catch 'em i've
GOT TO MAKE IT 1 
482

THE RAILROAD MAN’S MAGAZINE

  “ Couple o’ miles—out by the river”

  “ Can you catch ’em I’ve got to make
it,” I told him, and quickly explained

  “ Maybe,” he said simply “ Get on,
anyhow, and We’ll try”

  I’d have given that conductor a pass-
port to heaven if I’d had it I’ve often
wondered whether he really went ahead
and rode in the cab on my account, and
if the suddenness with which that town
vanished behind us was brought about for
my sake, or if the fact that the train was
twenty hours late had anything to do
with it but the surest thing about it was
that we flew

  When we whizzed into sight of 43,
they were throwing the mail-car in on
the “ Y” The tracks had separated some
distance back, and were now more than
half a mile apart

  The “ Dead and Edge’s ” air went on,
and in about two car lengths we slowed
down so much that when I jumped I only
made three revolutions on the sloping
side of the embankment before I got up
and started to run

  Then I did a Marathon in twenty-

yard time, crashing through the South
Dakota corn-stalks like a deer

  Meanwhile the engine was running in
on the “ Y,” coupling up with the car
by the chain, running it back to the stem
of the “ Y,” then out onto the main track
and sticking it onto the rear end of the -
train with the good coupler

  I had come nearly half a mile, on a
day-empty stomach, through a corn-field,
and had nearly a quarter left to run

  The engine pulled away from the train,
passed the switch, backed out onto the
“ Y ” again, switched back, and was ma-
king the home-stretch to the head of the
train as I reached the right-of-way fence

  I used the last of my strength to climb
into the mail-car door, just as a whistling
rush of air and a clank underneath the
car told that the engine had coupled and
the air was connected

  “Well! Great jimcracks, I didn’t ex-
pect to see you again! ” was the mail-
clerk’s greeting “ But I’m glad you
came Have you got the pies ”

  I had They were badly smashed, but
welcome enough for all that

 With faith in the man at the throttle
    ahead,

 And never a thought of danger

 I looked at her often and wished that
    we two

Might journey forever together,
With never a care when the heavens
were blue
And blithe in the stormiest weather
Her lashes were long, her expression
was sweet,

 She must have been twenty or nearly :
 Though I know not her name, though
 we never may meet,-
 I know she remembers me clearly

S

  In fancy I see her still, slender and
     fair,

 As she was in that long ago May-
     time,

  When her dark lashes curled and the
     bronze of her hair

  Turned dusk at the close of the day-
      time-

 Oh, I dreamed of her grace as we
     thundered ahead

  When troubles no longer beset me

  Her cheeks may be faded, her gladness
     be dead,

  But I know she will never forget me

  I	know that whatever her future may
     be

  Whether lofty or lowly her station

  She will never forget that occasion
     when we

  Journeyed 011 to our far destination

  Though I never may clasp her in happy
     embrace

  And never may tell her I love her

  She remembers, I know, for I stepped
     011 her face

 When I crawled from my berth
    above her

DONNELLY’S HUNCH

 BY ALFRED H GIEBLER

      Between Premonition and Prevarication, a Fireman
      Manages To Get Just What He Is Looking for

nGINE 80S, pulling the divi-
sion superintendent’s spe-
cial c o a c li  “ Magnolia,”
stood on the siding at Stout-
land Junction Engineer
Tom Collins, who had
brought her here, was stretched out in
the office of the local doctor, a victim of
acmte indigestion

At the station, Ed Francis, the con-
ductor stood over the telegraph operator

“ Tell the despatcher,” he dictated,

“ that Collins is down and out, won’t be
able to finish the run Tell him the Old
Man is asleep in the car, and that if
they’ll let me pick up a fireman here and
use Donnelly as engineer we’ll get out
in ten minutes and he’ll never know it”
The operator with a nonchalant air
of having division superintendents’
specials tied up at his station every night
in the week, worked away at his key a
few minutes, then, after listening to the
answering clicks, he turned to Francis

  “Nixey,” he said, “ DS says if the
Old Man found _out that Donnelly
wasn’t a regular engineer there’d be
-Sam Hill to pay  says for you to keep
your shirt on a few minutes and he’ll
give you orders what to do”

  “ Well, any time to-night,” growled
Francis, “ if the Old Man wakes,
there’ll—”

  The operator held up his hand for
silence

  “ There’s your dope now,” he said,
grabbing a pad of order paper He
wrote rapidly for a few seconds, then
tare off one of the yellow sheets and
handed it to Francis

  “ For the love of Mike,” Francis
snorted, when he read the order, “ this
means a fifty-minute lay-over, and we’ve

483

 been burning the wind to make time
 What is the—”

 V “ Oh, don’t tell me your troubles,”
 said the operator languidly “ I’m not
 responsible for,the way this old turn-
 pike is run”

   Francis grinned at him, put the order
 in his cap and went out to the 808
 Donnelly, the fireman, leaned out of the
 cab

   “What did they say, I'M” he de-
 manded eagerly, as Francis came up

   “ They said for us to wait till 32 gets
 here and then to take Pete Horn off the
 64 to finish Collins’s run I thought
 they’d let you take the run Matt What
 is it they’ve got against you ”

   “ Oh, it’s because I come off the Jerk-
 water,” said Donnelly, all the hope and
 eagerness gone out of his face

   “ Well, you’d make as good a run-
 ner as they’ve got” Francis yawned
 and stretched his arms “ I didn’t get
 much sleep last night,” he continued,
 “ I’m going in the office and pound my
 ear till 32 gets here Sorry they wouldn’t
 let you take the run, Matt”

   “ Oh, it’s all right,” said Donnelly
 lightly, “ I’m used to gettin’ the short
 end of it”

   “ It’s a shame, anyhow,” said Francis,
 as lie turned away

   The St L, M and E Railroad is al-
 most a bee-line through Missouri till it
 strikes the Ozark foot-hills there it
 makes a wide detour, skirts the mountains
 to the southwest, then swings back toward
 the Mississippi, while the D and K, or
 the Jerkwater, that branches off at Stout-
 land Junction, dashes boldly up and over
 the rugged knobs, comes down their west-
 ern slopes, cuts across lots, as it were, and
 intersects the St L, M and E again at
484

THE RAILROAD MAN’S MAGAZINE

Jacksonville, the southern terminus of
both roads

  The D and K is not taken very se-
riously by its stronger rival It is con-
sidered as a sort of burlesque railroad
Its engines are said to burn hay for fuel,
and passengers on the one mixed train
a day that puffs and jerks over its forty
crooked miles are supposed to be able to
alight at any point along the way to re-
lieve the tedium of the journey by walk-
ing

  The Jerkwater had been a cradle of
industry to Matt Donnelly He had
started as water-boy on a construction
train, and then, after he had worked as
wiper, hostler, fireman—mastered every
branch of the service that leads to en-
gine running, and was as good and safe
an engineer as ever pulled a throttle—
he had come down to the main line

  But according to main-line standards
nothing good could come from the Jerk-
water He was not given an engine, but
put to firing

  “ It’s all right,” said Donnelly, “ I’ll
get a chance some day to show them that
I can handle an engine as well as the
best of them, and they’ll give me a run
fast enough” He believed this, and he
told it to Katie Mullins, and Katie be-
lieved it, and so they were married

  But Donnelly did not go up on the
ladder He was made a fireman when
he came to the road, and a fireman he re-
mained Five years had passed, and
there was a pathetic stoop to Katie’s
shoulders as she bent over the sewing
she took in to make both ends meet in
their growing family

  The lilting Irish songs were stilled on
her lips, and Donnelly had almost given
up hope, but to-night when Collins was
stricken, he thought his chance had come

  He would take the special to the end
of the run, and he would be so careful
that the Old Man sleeping away in his
palatial coach would not feel a single
bump to his precious bones

  He would show them that he could
run an engine as well as any man on the
road, even if he did learn the trick on
the hay-burners of the despised Jerk-
water

  Then he would get his run at last, ana
Katie—ah, Katie, with her patient, wist-
ful face and tender eyes—would be hap-

py again when they were living in the
little cottage they had planned

  Thus he had dreamed, waiting for
Francis-to come back, and then his dream
had been shattered Tears of anger
welled up in Donnelly’s eyes He had
spoken lightly to Francis, spoken as
though he did not care, but that was the
Irish pride in him He did care—he did
care! Bitter disappointment and black
rage filled his heart

  The waiting-room of the Stoutland
station was only a few steps from where
Donnelly sat in the cab of the 808
brooding over his wrongs A child came
to a window, saw the engine and dis-
appeared, and in another moment was
at the door dragging a woman by the
hand

  “ There’s a train,” said the child,
“ let’s go to papa on that train”

  The woman hurried to the engine

  “Where does this train go” she
asked, lifting a tear-stained face Does
it go on the branch ”

  “It doesn’t go anywhere for a while,
ma’am,” answered -Donnelly, “ the en-
gineer took sick and we’re waitin’ for
another”

  “ 1 wanted to go to Cowan,” said the
woman “ I missed the train, and there
won’t be another till to-morrow”

  “ Y’ couldn’t ride on this train if it
was goin’ to Cowan,” said Donnelly,
“ it’s a superintendent’s special”

  “ No, it'd be too tony for the likes
of me,” replied the woman, with a smile
that was more of a ghastly grimace than
anything else, as she turned away

  She was a poor bedraggled creature
with all the marks of poverty stamped
on her dress and features There was
something about her wobegone condi-
tion that touched Donnelly It was the
mute resignation of the poor—the phil-
osophy that reasons that theirs is a mis-
ery that cannot be cured and must be en-
dured He called her back, intending to
give her a word out of the abundance of
his sympathy

  “ Was it very important, what ye
wanted to go to Cowan for” he asked

  She turned on him fiercely

  “ I’d give my soul to get there to-
night My husband’s there, and lie’s
dyin', lie’s askin’ for me and I can’t go
to him”
DONNELLY’S HUNCH

485

don't tell me your troubles,
SAID THE OPERATOR

    “ Maybe it’s not that bad,” said Don-
 nelly kindly

   The woman looked up at him, a blaze
 in her eyes

    “ He’s dyin,’ I tell you, he’s dyin’! I
 drove him away and now he’ll die and
 never know I’ve forgiven him and want-
 ed him back a thousand times

    The poor creature was half crazy with
 her grief

    “ He’s dyin’, he’s dyin’,” she kept re-
 peating the words, her wild eyes fastened
 on Donnelly’s face He was the only
 person that had spoken kindly to her that
 day She appealed to him, lifting her
 hands pitifully “ Oh, why can’t I go to
 ' him ”

   Donnelly’s heart was very soft All
 his own troubles were forgotten in pity
 for the woman, but he could not stand
 the terrible look in her face

    He turned his head aside to escape her
 stare He looked out of the cab win-
 dow idly

   And then—Donnelly became a true

descendant of kings He gave not a
thought to himself, his immolation was
completed It was an Irish Don Quixote
that climbed down from the cab

  “ You wait here a minute,” he said to
the woman  then he ran to the rear of
the special coach, climbed up on the
platform, opened the door carefully and
tiptoed along a narrow aisle to the smo-
king-room where the porter was having an
audible dispute with Morpheus

  “ That’s good,” said Donnelly, listen-
ing a moment, “ it’s a sign the Old Man
is still snoozin’”

  He ran back, led the woman and child
to the front end of the coach and helped
them up

  “ Go in there,” he said, opening the
door and shoving them in “ Don’t for
the life of ve try to go in the other part
of the car just stay here till I copie for
ye If a porter comes and asks ye what
ye are doin', tell him ye are takin’ a ride,
and if he bothers ye, tell him Matthew
Donnelly’ll knock his head off!”

  He was gone before the woman, be-
wildered by the turn events had taken,
could say a word He ran to the switch
that led to the Jerkwater, swung the tar-
get around, then back to the 808

  “ They can take their dirty job and
keep it,” he muttered to himself as he
reached for the throttle The engine be-
gan to move It crept along the rails
with care and caution like some great
beast that was escaping from its master,
the end of the main-line rails were
reached, the ponderous drivers of the 808
gripped the lighter steel of the Jerk-
water, and on they went, past the cluster
of houses, past the coal-chutes

  Then Donnelly gave her more steam
and they whipped around the curve and
out of sight

  Conductor Francis found his couch—
an unused corner of the telegraph table
—an uncomfortable one, and he did not
pound his ear more than twenty of the
forty minutes of the wait till he rose

  He addressed a few uncomplimentary,
and more or less profane remarks about
the sleeping accommodations of the of-
fice to the operator, and getting only un-
intelligible grunts in response, went to
the window to see how Donnelly and the
808 were getting along

  He looked out of the window once,
rubbed a clear spot on the glass and
looked again Then he ran to the door
and stared up the siding to the north
and down the siding to the south He
called the operator, and, together, they
looked up and down the track, and
Francis even took a look up in the air
They returned to the office and spent a
few seconds looking solemnly at each
other

  The operator opened his key, and for
the first time in the history of railroad-
ing clicked the news that an engine and
a special coach bearing the august per-
son of the division superintendent had
disappeared—had faded from the sight
of man

  Of course everybody thought Donnelly
was crazy, and no one thought of the
Jerkwater The despatcher asked a thou-
sand questions, most of them unanswer-
able I-Ie gave a thousand orders, most
of them impossible of execution

  All stations on either side of Stout-
land were notified to look out for the

runaways, for, as every one reasoned,
there was no telling what direction a
crazy fireman running amuck with an
engine would take The thing to do was
to keep the track 'clear and avoid collision
if possible

  The languid operator at Stoutland
Junction was roused to quick action for
once in his life

  Francis put in the time walking up
and down the room, wording a letter of
resignation he meant to write when ho
should feel a little calmer

  In the midst of things, the operator
at Swinton, a station fifteen miles south
of Stoutland, broke in on the wire, and
a hundred miles of railroad held its
breath and hung on every dot and dash
of his message

  A farmer had telephoned that there
was a wreck on a piece of the road that
ran through his field

  Then consternation took a hand in the
game The despatcher ordered all the
doctors in Swinton to go to the wreck,
and two Italian laborers—one with
bumps on his head and one who had
lost a piece of skin the size of a dime—
were hauled to Swinton in automobiles
with ten surgeons attending them

  The wreck was that of a belated
work-train that had run past orders to
meet the special at Lomax, a blind
siding a few miles out of Swinton

  Donnelly knew every foot, every curve
and low joint on the D and K Its one
train a day had long since made its
round trip and he had a clear track He
whizzed the 808 through the little towns
at a rate of speed hitherto unknown on
the Jerkwater, and yet he was as care-
ful as if Katie and Maggie and Ma-
laclii, the twins, and little Francis
Xavier, who was but two months old
had been in the special car behind

  Most of the stations on the line were
dark At one place a belated agent
came out on the platform and stood with
bulging eyes at the unusual sight

  Cowan, the town the woman wanted
to reach, was twenty-three miles from
Stoutland Junction, and, in exactly
thirty-seven minutes, which was not bad
time, considering that Donnelly had to
do his own firing, he slowed up at the
deserted station He stopped the engine
and ran to the coach
DONNELLY’S HUNCH

487

  “ Here ye are,” he said, opening the
door, “ here’s the end of yer journey”
The woman began tugging at the
child that had gone to sleep on the Moor
Donnelly picked up the youngster and
followed the woman as she climbed down
the steps of the car

  “ Wake somebody up in one of them
houses,” he told her

  She tried to say something, she began
sobbing hysterical thanks, but Donnelly

  He gave three or four ear-splitting
J)lasts of the whistle to announce their
arrival, slipped quietly down from the
cab and sought his boarding-house by
the most unfrequented path he knew

  He was glad Katie was at the other
end of the road, it would delay the tell-
ing of the bad news that he was out of
work for a few hours

  He went to bed with a heavy heart
The first thiifg he did next morning

THE PORTER WAS HAVING AN AUDIELE DISPUTE WITH MORPHEUS

was in the cab before she had said half
a dozen words

  “ Good-by,” hcr'shouted, as the train
moved away

  The rest of tjie run was made in forty-
four minutes, and at 1005 the 808 and
the “ Magnolia,” with its calmly sleep-
ing occupants, steamed into the Jerk-
water yards at Jacksonville

  There was a switch connecting the
two roads, and Donnelly might have de-
livered the special to the St L, M and

E	station, but that would have entailed
publicity, and that was something for
which he was not looking

was to pack his few belongings Not
considering his job worth resigning, he
went to the office and demanded the
money that was coming to him

  “ Can’t do anything for you,” said
the cashier, “ got orders to send you over
to the general offices as soon as you
show up here The Old Man wants to
see you'f

  The Old Man was the last person in
the world that Donnelly wanted to see,
but there was no way out of it, he would
have to go on the carpet before he was
allowed to draw his money In the ele-
vator on his way to the Old Man’s of-

fice he heard the first news of the wreck
Two men were talking

  “ Everybody thought the fireman was
crazy,” one of them was saying, “ but
it looks as if there might have been
some sort of method in his madness A
work-train ran past a meeting-point, and
then went in the ditch on a spread rail
near Swinton If the fireman hadn’t ta-
ken the special around on the Jerkwater
they would have found the spread rail,
or smashed into the work-train”

  “ Funny how things will happen,”
said the other man, “ enough to make
you believe in fate”

  This news took Donnelly’s breath
away He wanted to ask the men more
about it, but their floor was reached
before he could collect his scattered wits
He kept turning the words over in his
mind as he went through the anteroom
of the superintendent’s office The Old
Man was sitting with his back to the
door He turned as Donnelly entered

  “Well, what’s your trouble” he
snapped

  “ Ye wanted to see me,” said Mat-
thew “ My name is Donnelly”

  “ So you’re the man that took me for

an enforced ride over the Jerkwater,
eh” The Old Man adjusted the glass-
es to his near-sighted eyes- and leaned
forward to get a better look at him

  “ Yes, sir,” said Donnelly, because
there was nothing else to be said

  The Old Man sat and stared at him
then lie took his glasses off and polished
them carefully, put them back on his
nose and stared again He had the repu-
tation of being hard, and many a man
had quailed under that glare, but not
Donnelly, who was thinking of the
words he had heard in the elevator he
wondered if the Old Man knew His
next words satisfied him on that point

  “ Well, what have you got to say for
yourself What made you do such a
crazy thing  ”

  “ Ye wouldn’t believe me if I told ye,”
said Donnellv, “ ye’d think it was fool-
ish”

  “ It was foolish,” roared the Old
Man, slapping the desk “ the biggest
fool thing I ever heard of But what
have you got to say Out with it ”

  “ I took ye over the Jerkwater to keep
ye out of the wreck If I'd told ye be-
fore there was goin’ to be a wreck, ye’d

YE COULD HARDLY CALL IT THAT IT WAS
MORE LIKE A HUNCH

489

have laughed at me and- said I was
crazy”

  Donnelly spoke with assurance He
looked the Old Man square in the eye
with the perfect candor of a child

  “ What wreck ” cried the Old Man

  “ The wreck last night,” said Don-
nelly, “ the work-train that ran past its
ineeting-point”

  “ Wait a minute” The Old Man
grabbed a sheaf of telegrams that lay on
the desk It often happens that a divi-
sion superintendent is almost the last
man to hear of an accident, the news be-
ing kept from him till tlie details are
complete

  “ This tells me” he said, shaking a
paper at Donnelly till it made a crack-
ing noise, “ that work-train No 40 ran
by their meeting-point at Lomax and
then went in the ditch at a point two
miles north of there” Donnelly nodded
his head “ I take it, then,” resumed
the Old Man, “ that if you hadn’t ab-
ducted me and gone over the Jerkwater,
we would have either hit the work-train
or found the spread rail ourselves”

  “ That’s it, sir,” said Donnelly

  The Old Man wiped his glasses again,
blinking his eyes rapidly as he did so

All the harshness was gone out of his
voice when he spoke again

  “ Do you mean to tell me that you
knew this was going to happen, and
that you took me around the Jerkwater
to avoid it  ”

  “ Yes, sir,” said Donnelly, with be-
coming modesty, but gulping a little
over the enormity of his prevarication

  'Fhe Old Man turned to his desk for
a few seconds When he turned to Don-
nelly again, he held out a paper

  “ Take this to Effinger It is an order
to give you a regular run as engineer
A man that can take me over forty
miles of the kind of track they’ve got on
the Jerkwater and never wake me up,
and can look far enough in the future
to prevent wrecks, is too valuable for
the service to lose”

  “ Thank ye, sir,” said Donnelly, as
he took the paper He started to go,
but the Old Man held up a hand

  “ I want you to tell me something
about this feeling you had Was it a
presentiment, a sort of premonition”
Donnelly looked as wise as an owl

  “ Well, no, sir,” he said, rubbing the
stubble on his chin, “ ye could hardly
call it that It was more like a hunch”

FIGHTING FIRES ON THE PENNSY

Employees Extinguished 321 Conflagrations During 1909, Saving the

Company Thousands of Dollars

THE annual report of the insurance de-
partment of the Pennsylvania Railroad
shows that the company’s own employees ex-
tinguished 321 fires during 1909 These
fires occurred 011 property valued at more
than $9,000,000 yet the loss from them
amounted to only about $20,000

  The report derives added significance from
the fact, says The Raihvay and Engineering
Review, that during the past year additional
equipment for extinguishing tires has been
placed at available points The road's own
organization for lighting fires has been fur-
ther developed by special training of em-
ployees, and additional locomotives in yard
service have been equipped with special ap-
paratus for use in case of fire

  A circular is to be issued by the insurance
department giving the causes of all tiros on
the Pennsylvania system east and west of

Pittsburgh in 1909, in order that the em-
ployees may realize that their efforts to mini-
mize losses from fire are appreciated, and
further, that their attention may be called
to the number of fires occurring from pre-
ventable causes

  During the year 1909 there were 929 fires
on the entire system, involving a loss of only
$402,615, which was exceedingly small, com-
paratively, as the value of the property was
more than $260,000,000 Forty tires, entail-
ing a loss of $11,079, started on adjacent
property Spontaneous combustion was re-
sponsible for a loss of $10,315, from 21 fires

  Two fires resulting from careless handling
of lighted cigars, cigarettes, and matches,
caused a loss of $60,395 Nine fires were due
to tramps, with a loss to the company of
$1,270 and 28 fires, with a loss of $28,670,
were of incendiary origin

THE editor of this magazine lias received scores of communications from
young men in all parts of the country, asking how the)' may become
apprentices in the big railway shops, the conditions there, the pay, and
similar questions We are going to answer them in a series of five articles,
which we have selected Mr Robert H Rogers to write, for the reason that
Mr Rogers has the twofold ability of being a railroad mechanic and a writer
This is the first article in the series

    We are publishing them in our popular department, “ Help For Men
Who Help Themselves because there is no more appropriate place in the
magazine They will be distinguished as “ The Rogers Group, however,
and will run consecutively until completed This series is no less valuable
than it is interesting to the young railroad aspirant, the beginner in the work-

to the railroad for their future

What Some of the Great Railway Systems Are Doing to Educate Young
Men to Cope With the Improvements in
Railway Construction

RY feature in railroad ser-

very small beginning A
pile of castings, billets, and
boiler-plate results present-
ly in a complete locomotive and the awk-
ward boy whom you may notice in any

his hand oftener than the head of the

  It is true that a long and rocky road
must be traveled to reach this preferment
but, with very few exceptions, as an
apprentice is where they all began, and
from this humble capacity will continue
to be recruited all the guiding hands and
master minds of the future

  All of them, in the old days, chipped
refractory castings full of burrs, swept
the shop, and spent unavailing hours in
the quest of impossible and preposterous
tools It was a hard school A great

many will bear witness to this, even if we
have pulled out of the rut, but the game
was worth the candle, and it may be en-
couraging for every beginner to know that
the big job can be'his, if he honestly gets
into it and tries

  During one of the recent mechanical
conventions in Atlantic City several well-
known motive-power chiefs met for an
informal lunch at the Marlborough-Blen-
heim, after a morning session wherein had
been profoundly and resourcefully dis-
cussed the all-important matters of cut
flanges, leaky boiler - tubes, high - speed
steel, and automatic stokers

  Perhaps the close attention necessary
to intelligently follow the learned papers
which had been read resulted in these sub-
jects being tabooed after adjournment, in
favor of less exacting topics but, as
railroading must be talked by its incum-
bents of whatever grade, whether on the
ash-pit at Jersey City, or in executive
session in the Railway Exchange, it could
not long be evaded in this instance

  The form assumed, however, was a
genuine treat to the writer, who was the
only auditor, and no less a rare occasion,
because the superintendents of motive-
power became reminiscent concerning
their individual advent into the business,
in which now, in their line, they stand at
the head

  They are taciturn, too, these high offi-
cials They possess to a transcendent de-
gree this peculiar attribute of veteran
engineers, and it is pretty hard to get
them to comment on their early days

  Big Men Who Began Low Down

  It transpired that E T White, head
of the eastern district of the Baltimore
and Ohio, had been an apprentice and a
wiper, in the historic old Piedmont shops,
when Sam Houston held forth in that
quarter as master mechanic, and to whom,
with Andrew J Cromwell, the B and O
is indebted for the advanced mechanical
ideas which, in the time of these men,
placed it ahead of its contemporaries

  Mr White had good schooling in the
railroad game, but he was a good pupil,
too Through ability only, and without a
single push behind him, he passed through
all the grades leading to his present posi-
tion And the end is not vet

  Frgnk T Hyndman, of the New York
New Haven and Hartford Railroad, was
running an engine on the old Pittsburgh
and Western, between that toKvn and
Chicago Junction, within the ken of the
writer, who was roundhouse foreman at
the Glenwood terminal, where Mr Hynd-
man’s engine put up

  A	Stewart, of the Southern Railway,
swung a hammer for many years in tlie
U P shops before he saw his way to the
top

All Were Poor Boys

  Many of the older employees of the
Erie Railroad recall when T Rumney,
now general mechanical superintendent,
had charge of the rod-gang in the Sus-
quehanna shops of that road, and it hasn’t
been so long ago either

  He rose from machinist, 110 matter
through what changes of management the
road passed in the meantime When a
better job opened up in his particular
field he was always the logical candidate
for consideration, and always approved
by his superiors, whoever they might be

  These men were poor boys—plain,
every-day apprentices at the start They
had to work for a living, and they chose
railroading With possibly a single ex-
ception they did not have the benefit of
college training, or even theoretical
groundwork in their future duties, but
what they have since acquired in that di-
rection is astounding

  The effort on their part, which result-
ed in literally “ picking up ” advanced
knowledge, in the face of the terrific pace
set by their daily work, must have been
tremendous Yet they succeeded, and are
to-day among the top-notch motive-power
men of the country

  Whether based on fact or not, it has
often been remarked that the brightest
minds in railroading are to be found in
the motive-power ranks and it need not
be wondered at, because interest naturally
centers in the spectacular Mammoth
engines, a giddy race with time, shops
replete with wonder-working machinery,
terminal roundhouses, with all their pic-
turesque detail of personnel and environ-
ment—these attract a young man

The locomotives suggest their crews
and all the stirring stories which have
492

THE RAILROAD MAN’S MAGAZINE

been written about them, and which will
continue to be written until the end of
time

The Trades Taught

  The shops appeal to the ingenuity and
the mechanical instinct, maybe dormant,
but nevertheless inherent in us all, and the
smoky roundhouse interests through the
concentration of energy and human re-
sourcefulness, which the veriest tyro can-
not but admit must be housed within its
battered and windowless walls

  That the ambitious young man of to-
day finds all this just as appealing, is
shown by the fact that the Erie Railroad
has on file some two thousand applications
from young men who wish to enter as
apprentices

  The Baltimore and Ohio can pro-
duce as many more, and the Pennsylvania
double the number of either These are
applications for machinist, air-brake in-
spector (which is now taught as a separate
trade), blacksmith, boiler - maker, tin-
smith, pipe-fitter, electrician, car-builder,
cabinet-maker, carpenter, pattern-maker,
and rnolder, all of which are necessary in
modern car and locomotive building and
maintenance	v

  The majority of these applications are
for machinist apprentice, in the propor-
tion of at least four to one This is un-
doubtedly the most comprehensive of all
trades From its ranks are recruited a
larger number for supervising and official
positions than any other

  It is, of course, impossible to provide
for all of these applicants but on the
larger roads, at least, about five hundred
boys take up the work annually, and of
this number seventy-five per cent finish
out their allotted time of three or four
years, dependent on the requirements of
the trade which they are to learn

Future of 20,000 Youngsters

  What of the possibly twenty thousand
young men who every year are given the
chance to learn a trade The carefully
compiled statistics of the writer, extend-
ing over many years, indicate that one
thousand will become sub-foremen, or, in
other words, gang-bosses two hundred
and fifty will be foremen, and seventy-five
general foremen

  Fifty of these general foremen will
become master mechanics, and five of the
latter will be heads of that department,
mechanical superintendents, or superin-
tendents of motive-power, call it what you
will

  This may seem a bit discouraging to
the aspirant for honors in this attractive
field, but remember always that deadwood
is inimical to and inseparable from all
callings There is naturally a weeding-
out process in the evolution of a future
superintendent of a department so vital,
and those who fall by the wayside can
generally, and without a strained retro-
spect, unearth the true cause of their un-
doing

  Without a reference to the pluck of
those who years ago learned the business,
it would be unfair to comment on the
tremendous advantages possessed by an
apprentice of these days

  No more striking contrast could possi-
bly be imagined than between these fa-
vored individuals and those who served
their time in the so-called “ good old
days” When these two contrasts are laid
side by side, it seems really astonishing
that every beginner of the nineteenth
century is not head of his chosen profes-
sion at first hand

1	he “ Good Old Days”

  To learn the machinist’s trade twenty,
or twenty-five years ago, meant a degree
of hardship inconceivable almost in this
age of progress The general plan of
training, say up to 1890, was to start the
apprenticesin the roundhouse for a year,
and to regard them merely as extra
pairs of arms and legs to do the bidding
of anybody connected with the “ knock-
about ” gang

  This gang, composed of a boss, two
machinists, two helpers, and one or two
of the green boys, contended with all the
hard work of removing and applying
driving-wheel tires, dropping wheels in
the pit for new boxes, and changing
springs, all of which, with the crude ap-
pliances then in use, were very laborious
operations'

  It should be added that a roundhouse
in which this work is done is rather a dis-
enchanting proposition to a novice at all
times and on all occasions In summer
THE RAILROAD APPRENTICE

493

the thermometer frequently climbs around
130 degrees, and the boss would gener-
ally find a place to put the new boy where
he- would have no difficulty in appre-
ciating the temperature

  He would, no doubt, think of happy
school-days and the cool quiet of his
country home, while lying over the high
boiler of a “ hog,” with all the lagging
burned from under the jacket and lag-
ging, in those days, was simply boards
He would be trying to pack one of those
tlirottle-valves arranged on top the skin
peeling off his fingers from contact with
the network of red-hot pipe, and half
strangled by the smoke from his open
kerosene torch

Some “ Fancy ” Jobs

  There were other jobs, too, which even
the writer cannot recall without a tremor
Many~who read this have not forgotten
the problem of the disconnected throttle,
wjiich rigging always came apart at a
point under the shell of the boiler, about
six feet in the rear of the dome

  There were a good many things in those
boilers—stays, crown-bars, and what not
and after the dome-cover was off and the
throttle-box removed, it became the time-
honored job of the thinnest and smallest
apprentice to be lowered by his feet, head
first down the dome, and make his way
over the crown bars to the seat of the
trouble

  It was no trouble to replace the pin,
the loss of which meant the disconnected
throttle but it was an awful job to worm
one's way back again to where welcome
hands would seize his feet and haul him
out

  It is remembered in this connection that
Joe Brady, once an apprentice with the
writer, but now probably general foreman
of the B and O, at the Riverside round-
house in Baltimore, became stuck in tlie
boiler of the 806, on his return trip fol-
lowing this feat

  They claim that if a man loses his nerve
he swells when in such environment, but
it is nevertheless a fact that they thought
the boiler would have to be cut apart
before Joe was finally released

  Winter in these old roundhouses was
not much of an improvement They were
ramshackle affairs at the best, all of them

The doors didn’t fit There was always
a gap under them of from one-half to
three inches, and it required all the waste
bagging which we could beg or steal from
the oil-house to stop the crevices

  There wasn’t a whole pane of glass
anywhere How the wind did whoop it
up when the wind was blowing right
Then the boys would put in many hours in
the cold and damp pits under the engines,
chipping away the ice so that the bolts
could be uncovered to loosen the nuts

  The drop-pits on which this work was
done were not tlie quick-action affairs of
the present, operated by an hydraulic or
air jack with a minimum of labor, but,
on the contrary, they were extremely
primitive

  The entire machinery for lowering the
table on which the pair of driving-wheels
rested while being dropped consisted of
a jack-screw in each corner, turned by a
wheel taken from the brake-staff of a
freight-car

  Of course every new apprentice was
assigned to the unenviable job of oper-
ating one of these wheels Unenviable is
without reservation, because there are
tricks in all trades The older hands on
the other three wheels had the art of run-
ning their own down in unison finely de-
veloped, leaving the apprentice to lower
practically all of the weight, to the ac-
companiment of blistered hands and a
lame back

Hunting “ John Murphy

  There was another feature, too, 'hat
was “ raw,” and so “ raw ” that its n ,ji-
ory lingers through all of these many
years

  That was the innocent, but none the
less disheartening, “ kidding ” to which
every new boy became the logical victim

  He was sent off in a hurry, and always
on a long journey, for some impossible
tool For instance, a machinist in the
“ knockabout ” gang would opportunely
discover that the progress of the work
at hand must be he]d up until he could
secure the loan of a “ half-round square”
this impossible tool being the property of
a certain “ John Murphy”

  “John Murphy” was always farthest
from the gang which the limits of the
shop would permit, if, indeed, he were
494

THE RAILROAD MAN’S MAGAZINE

not equally as mythical as the tool itself
The apprentice would be instructed to
borrow this appliance from Mr Murphy,
and not return without it

  Fertility of invention worthy of a bet-
ter cause was displayed by the mechanics
of those days in creating these errands
The boys were hustled after “ straight
hooks,” “ left-hand monkey-wrenches,”
“ whistle-tuners,” and “ smooth files”

  They carried bogus orders to the store-
keeper for “ white lamp-black,” and to
the blacksmith to temper a “ lead-center
punch” carefully filed into a semblance
of the steel article

Sent for “ Blast”

  There is, indeed, an instance on record
where an apprentice spent his entire din-
ner-hour in begging the foreman of the
iron-foundry for-a bucket of “ blast” He
was anxious to please the machinist for
whom he was working, and that worthy
had informed him that a great favor
would be conferred if he could possibly
beg or borrow a bucket of “ blast”

  This is a part of what happened to the
big boys who went to learn a trade in
those “ good old days,” because there was
an infallible precedent to sort the new-
comers in two classes, big and little

  The big ones had their initiation in the
roundhouse, while their smaller brothers
were assigned to the machine-shop, until
they grew up strong enough to stand the
roundhouse and its vicissitudes

  It cannot be said that they fared any
b er either The machine-shops of those
days wouldn’t bear much comparison with
what you may now see at Reading or
Hornell There were no gear-tables on
the lathes and if you wanted to chase
an eight or a twelve thread you had to
cover the whole machine-shop floor with
figures, and many of these figures had as
little bearing on the matter at hand as the
“ whistle-tuner ” on the device to which
it refers

  This first year of apprenticeship was
the real test of a boy’s staying qualities
If he survived it there was good stuff in
him the remaining three years didn’t go
so hard He received his reward in the
shape of a “ bounty,” now a thing of the
past, and a clearance into the full-fledged
machinists’ ranks

  The “ bounty ” was a great institution,
and it is a pity that it has passed away
It meant that from each and-every day’s
pay eight cents would be deducted by the
company, to be paid in a lump at the
expiration of the apprenticeship

  This amount, usually $100, was a pretty
good stake for a boy getting “ free” Of
course, there were certain tithes on this
amount, but enough remained to buy a
good kit of machinists’ tools, and more
cash at one time besides than the boy ever
saw

  After they were “ out of their time,”
and received their “ bounty,” they gener-
ally drifted away from the home fold to
secure experience Boys who started as
apprentices long ago gave value received
for the trade they learned It was simply
a case of the survival of the fittest straight
through, and represents the school in
which those whose names are mentioned
at the beginning of this article acquired
their knowledge

  The trade had to be picked up largely
from the mechanics in the shop where the
boy worked, and the result was almost
entirely dependent on the desire of these
mechanics to impart information There
was little disposition on the part of the
shop supervisors to teach any apprentice
The foreman thought his duty done when
he placed the boy as helper with a good
mechanic, or in a position where he might
pick up what was to be learned

Seeking Information

  The old apprenticeship system was
wofully weak in this particular feature,
because it lacked the spirit of cooperation
Before the advent of the shop instructor
—who is now paid to instil the ideas and
best procedure in the mind of the appren-
tice through practical demonstration—
the apprentice, when placed on a machine,
asked a mechanic how to do a certain job

  He had to ask him, as there was no
other way The mechanic would say:
“ You will have to learn that the same
way that 1 did” If the boy went to the
foreman for information, he would usual-
ly find him so loaded with other duties
that he would not have any time to devote
to apprentice education

  The result w’as that the machine did
not turn out the work, and unless the ap-
THE RAILROAD APPRENTICE

495

prentice proved to be an unusually good
“ sticker ” lie became disgusted with his
trade

  So much for what used to be : but what
a revelation for some of those old foremen
if they could walk through one of the
perfectly appointed apprentice schools of
the present day!	

The Difference To-Day

  They would see classes presided over
by competent and well-paid instructors
drawing-rooms, with all implements fur-
nished free of cost to the apprentices In
the shops it would be noted that the boys
work on a defined schedule  that they are
changed from machine to machine, or
from operation to operation at stated
times, and not allowed to remain two years
on a bolt lathe

  The slow boy is shifted in the regular
routine, so that the quicker boy who is to
follow him may have the full time al-
lowed upon the machine A slow boy,
who does not show decided improvement
after three or six days of instruction, is
taken off the machine and put on special
work for which he is better suited

  He is told that the company cannot
afford to reduce the output of that ma-
chine

  Some boys learn quickly, and others
slowly The quick boy often makes mis-
takes, while the slow ones, when the idea
is grasped, seldom forget it For this
reason every effort is made to study the
dull boy and bring him up to the standard
before removing him from a machine

Improving the Shops

  In order to meet the demands made on
their shops, many railroad companies,
within the past four or five years, have
practically renewed all shop machinery
Additions to shops, power-houses, round-
houses, and roundhouse machine - shops
have been built to keep in good condition
the motive power and car equipment To
derive the greatest possible benefit from
this investment, it is certain that the com-
panies must have trained, skilled, and
careful workmen

  In keeping with this advanced move-
ment the Erie Railroad has created an
organization for the purpose of giving

technical and practical instruction to
young men who enter its service as ap-
prentices It has established apprentice
schools at Meadville, Pennsylvania Hor-
nell New York Susquehanna, Pennsyl-
vania, and Dunmore, Pennsylvania

  These schools are free to apprentices in
all departments, and attendance is com-
pulsory Instruction in the classes covers
the fundamental rules of arithmetic, com-
mon and decimal fractions, proportion,
simple problems in interest, tables and
weights, the elementary principles of
plane and solid geometry, mechanical
drawing, practical and theoretical me-
chanics and instructions pertaining to
the construction of cars and locomotives,
as well as lessons in their successful and
economical operation

  Apprentices seeking employment in the
shops of the Erie (and the same require-
ments apply practically to the other roads
maintaining these schools) must not be
less than sixteen, nor more than twenty-
one years old and have good general
health

Making Application

  Preference is always given to the sons
of employees All applications for ap-
prenticeship are made to the master me-
chanic, or officer in charge of the shop,
and the applicants are sent directly to the
instructor of apprentices, who examines
them as to their general education

  If he finds that they are qualified for
the position sought, he so certifies to the
proper officer, and the applicant enters
the service

  The rules and regulations of this and
other companies are based on a specified
course of four years as the maximum time
to be served Time lost by apprentices is
not allowed, but each apprentice must put
in three hundred days, or the number of
hours a day which the shop works, before
he is entitled to advancement to another
year

  Those who complete the course, as in-
dicated by the award of a certificate of
apprenticeship, are given machinists’ rates
in the shop in which they are employed,
the rate being based upon ability and
merit

  Apprentices in this department are
given a general knowledge of the differ-

Not Included

The tool-room and air-brake depart-
ments are now no longer included in the
course given above for the machinist ap-
prentice, but are treated specially, and a
number of apprentices are kept in these
departments, with the understanding that
they are to become specialists in this par-
ticular work And no more important
item exists in modern locomotive practise
than the air-brake

The tool-room and air-brake depart-

 work in this department

 One apprentice will be selected from
 those in the fourth year of their time at
 this trade for instruction in laying out
 work from drawings He will work with
 and under the instruction of the man in
 charge of the laying-out table

 The term of service in this work will
 be at least six months At the end of

assigned to laying out, so that when the
first apprentice retires the second will lie
able to take a third, and so on

  The Erie Railroad Company announces,
in connection with its apprentice schools,
that the movement has for its primary
object, not the making of mechanical en-
gineers out of shop workmen, but the
making of first-class skilled mechanics, so
that the shop forces may be sure of men
trained and educated iii Erie standards
and Erie methods

  Those who prophesied a few years ago
that the new apprentice system which was
being established on the New York Cen-
tral lines would deteriorate and die a
natural death as soon as the first excite-
ment passed off, must be glad to learn
that they were badly mistaken

  After three years those who have fol-
lowed its progress closely are convinced
of the principles on which it is estab-
lished

  The New York Central has now ten
schools in connection with its shops—at
Beech Grove, Indiana  Collinwood, Ohio 
Depew, New York East Buffalo, New
York Elkhart, Indiana Jackson, Michi-
gan McKees Rocks, Pennsylvania
Oswego, New York St Thomas, Onta-
rio, and West Albany, New York The
last report indicates a total of 564 ap-
prentices enrolled The Union Pacific
and the Santa Fe have also fallen in line,
and are organizing apprentice instruction
schools in their various shops

What Apprentices Have Done

  The wonderful susceptibility to me-
chanical development induced by this
systematic course of training is well illus-
trated by the following instances, taken
at random from some of the shops of the
New York Central lines:

  In the West Albany shops a first-year
apprentice, with only two-weeks’ experi-
ence, bored twelve eccentrics in thirteen
hours, and five eccentric straps in Seven
and one-half hours

  A second-year apprentice, with helper,
set the valves on an engine in seven hours
He also set valves on two other engines in
good time A second-year apprentice,
with helper, lined up two sets of guides
and coupled pistons, all in six hours

This boy had only three months’ experi-

   8	R R

ence in this work A third-year appren-
tice, in charge of the rod job, repaired
thirty-two main rods, ten pairs of front-
end brasses, and eighteen pairs of back-
end brasses He also made two sets of
front-end brasses All of this work was
done in three weeks

  At the Oswego shops an apprentice,
with but three-months’ experience with
a helper, ran the link job successfully
during the temporary absence of the regu-
lar foreman At the Elkhart shops a
third-year apprentice laid out a new drop-
pit jack for the roundhouse from a blue-
print

In the Drafting-Room

  At the McKees Rocks shops two fourth-
year apprentices had full charge of a pit,
with an engine for general repairs The
boys ordered all parts, made sketches for
new bolts, lined up the guides, laid off the
shoes and wedges, wheeled and trammed
the engine and set the valves

  A fourth-year apprentice took complete
charge of erecting a new engine, includ-
ing the following jobs: leveling and
squaring the frames, scribing and chip-
ping the saddle, laying off the shoes and
wedges, and wheeling and tramming the
engine

  In connection with this mechanical
training, bo}'S are used in the drafting-
room both before and after graduation
Before graduation those best fitted for the
work spend three months making blue-
prints, drawings, and tracings After
graduation those specially adapted may
be used as regular draftsmen

  When rushed, the head draftsman often
takes drawings to the apprentice class-
room to be worked up or traced Ap-
prentices assist the drafting-room in ma-
king numerous tests, such as indicating
engines, dynamometer car te'stsj coal tests,
etc

  'Debating clubs give the boys an oppor-
tunity to write and talk on mechanical
subjects Speaking in public makes and
develops initiative, and the ability to do
this is due to classroom instruction Club
socials and picnics bind the boys to their
fellow workmen and build up valuable
friendships The boys learn to under-
stand and respect their superiors, but not
to fear them
498

THE RAILROAD MAN’S MAGAZINE

    The cause of this striking movement in
 the interests of advanced education, brief-
 ly summarized, is due to the tremendous
 strides in the development of the locomo-
 tive in the last twenty-five years, and to
 little else

A Perplexing Problem

   In 1876 the standard passenger-engine
 in use throughout the country had cylin-

-	ders sixteen inches in diameter and twen-
 ty-four inches stroke of piston, a toy com-
 pared with the present passenger-engine
 of the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe—
 the 1300—which would pull ten such
 engines as those of the centennial year,
 and their trains also

    The early locomotive builders had this
 advantage: The established gage of track
 —4 feet S}i inches—was larger than
 their ideas While their ideas progressed
 slowly, the extension of railroads pro-
 ceeded tremendously, until 100,000 miles
 of track was laid in this country—and all
 at that gage of 4 feet 8J> inches Not
 until this mileage was down did the fact
 dawn that the locomotive was outgrowing
 a gage now too late to change

    It is certain that this will remain the
 standard width of track for all time to
 come, as it is certain that no more than
 fifteen feet will remain the limit of over-
 head clearance

    During the past thirty years the weight
 of the locomotive has increased on this
 4-feet-81->-incli gage from less than 40
 tons to upward of 100 tons Engines
 have become higher and wider, until the

limit has been reached in both directions,
and the only thing which can be done
now is to improve the efficiency of the
machine within the present limitations

  To cope with these requirements, per-
plexing problems are presented, and be-
fore they can be successfully combated
each and every man in the mechanical
department must be specially trained to
an appreciation of the difficulties

  This explains largely why we have ap-
prentice schools They were not needed
in the old days, because the track was
bigger than the engine, but now the loco-
motive dwarfs the track, and all that can
be done is to enhance its power within
itself

Thinkers Are Wanted

  This is why the railroads want their
boys to think, and they are willing to
spend any amount of money to encourage
them, because the greenest among them
all may stumble on something which
might mean a revolution

  They pay their apprentices well, too
when compared to the old da5's The
writer put in his apprenticeship at sev-
enty cents a day for the first year, with
ten cents a day added for each succeeding
year

  It is not unusual for to receive now
eighty cents the first year, $1 the second,
$125 the third, and $150 the last year

  This may be an unwritten chapter in
railroading, but it is true in illustrating
the effort which all roads are making to
develop men

    In the next article in this series, which will appear in our May issue, Mr Rogers will
describe the occupation of a railroad machinist

HE gaunt frame building that

body down in the yard, who could leave
his work, had been driven to the shelter

Lie was addressing no one in particu-
lar, but the superintendent wheeled
around from his desk—in the corner and
faced him

  “ Speaking of the Old Man,” he said,

  “ No,” he snapped, “ I’ve been too busy

creaking steps that flanked that side of
the gaunt building

  It moved slowly across the half dozen

door of a box car that stood in the out-
going train

  A lamp waved a signal from the ca-
boose and was answered by two short
blasts from the engine,-and with a clank-
ing of draw-bars that sounded sharp
above the storm, the extra pulled slowly
down the yard

  “ It never snows, but there’s a blizzard
out here,” grumbled the night despatcher,
bending over the train-sheet at the long
instrument table in the center of the room,
“ and that applies to something more than
the weather chart, too Just let us get
a heavy run of stock, and tlie Old Man’s

notice anything What’s- he got to do
with the Old Man”

  “ Nothing, now, but there was a time
about ten years ago, when the Old Man
was a strong factor in his life” The
superintendent hitched his chair over to
the table and cocked up his heels

  “ Just a moment I'll get this extra
out of town and then eat my lunch while
you talk” interrupted the other

  “ It isn’t a long story,” began the su-
perintendent as he lighted a cigar and
carefully studied the burning end “ That
drunken bum is Sam Selkirk, at one time
the smoothest operator on the M I and
N Copper-plate copy and all that, and
his Morse came so clean that even Fatty
Dalton out at Elba would not break him,
and that’s saying a lot, for Fatty was the
worst ham on the division

  That was before the consolidation and
just after they brought Mr Goodell down
here from the Soo to be general man-
ager The road never saw such times
as that, before nor since for he was the-
best all-around operating manager they
ever had

  “ Well, Sam blowed into the general

offices one clay, they were located at
Kensington then, and hit -the Old Man
for a job I guess no one ever knew
where he came from, as that was before
the days of the petligree system, and a
man got a job for what he could do and
not what he had done

  “ Beyond the fact that he could pound
brass, the Old Man never asked any
questions I was a clerk in the office at
the time, and I remember the expression
on the Old Man’s face when Sam sat
down to that key He did love a -com-
petent man, 110 matter what branch of
the service he happened to be in

  “ You can bet there wasn’t any bulled
messages in that office after that, and
things went on as smooth as the road-bed
for about six months, until one day Joe
Kelsoe came in on No 2 and an-
nounced that he needed a despatcher, and
needed him bad

  “ You never knew Joe, did you Well,
he was the littlest man with the biggest
heart you will find anywhere and when
it came to getting trains over this hun-
dred and forty-four miles of steel and
cotton-wood, his peer wasn’t born He
went down East when the road was gob-
bled up, but he was train-master here in
Centerpoint at that time

  “ The Old Man knew, by the way Joe
cut his eyes around at Selkirk when he
made the announcement, that he might
as well look out for a new operator, for
what Joe went after he usually got, and
so the next day Sam was ordered to re-
port here for second trick work That
was the beginning of Sam’s troubles”

  The superintendent paused to relight
his cigar while the night despatcher
marked up an “os” on No 3 on the
train-sheet and said “ gn ” to the oper-
ator

  “ Of course there was a girl in the
case,” continued his chief, “ and the girl
in Sam’s case was Jim O’Keefe’s daugh-
ter Jim was road-master the Old Man
having brought him and the chief des-
patcher down with him from the Soo
We had no superintendent here in those
days, that work being divided between
the chief despatcher and the train-master

  “ The chief was a good man, all right,
or the Old Man wouldn’t have had him,
and we all thought he was straight as
a die, but a lot of straight trees have

crooked roots you know, and they never
showed in his make-up until Sam raked
off some of the dirt by taking up with
Fanny O’Keefe

  “ Somehow, Fanny never told Sam
that she and the chief had been thick up
north From that moment, the chief be-
• gan throwing it into Sam and never let
up until he finally got his scalp

   “ Things went on that way until Sam
and Fanny concluded to tie up She
was buying her wedding things, and Sam
went around with the glad hand out to
everybody The boys used to say that
even his “ OK ’’ sounded like a ‘ God
bless you,’ and many a lonesome lad up on
the west got an hour off when Sam knew
he ought to have been doing his work

   “ He paid no attention to the malice
of the chief, and took a good deal off
him for the sake of peace He always did
his work, and everybody liked him, from
the Old Man down

   “About that time the Transcontinent-
al bought up the line and there was a
general shake-up all around The gen-
eral offices at Kensington were abolished,
and the road made a part of the St
Toe branch of the Continental They
wanted the Old Man to go down there
as general superintendent, but he was
too good a man to sub to any of those
Wall Street importations, and as good as
told them so Besides, he was tired of
the game anyway, so he resigned and
moved over into Illinois and went into
the real estate business

   “ I never did know just how it hap-
pened, for I was in St Joe at the time,
having been moved down there along
with the other office fixtures, but it seems
that the chief had some kind of a pull
with the powers-that-be that we didn’t
know anything about, and the first thing
I knew, he was carded up as superintend-
ent of the division

   “ Just one week from that day Sam was
 fired for cause Of course it was plain
 to everybody that the cause was under the
 new superintendent’s hat but you don’t
 need a Gatling gun to kill a mosquito,
 and Sam wasn’t much more than that in
 the Transcontinental eye

  “ He came down in a day or two to
get his time, and I never saw such a
change in a fellow I started to open the
subject of his trouble, but lie shut up like

 a clam didn’t have a word to say against
 anybody, only that he guessed he would
 go out West and grow up with the
 country

  “ That was the last I saw of him until
he drifted in here to-night on'- this bliz-
zard, and I never learned the whole story
until the chief was raised from superin-
tendent to general manager of Western
lines and 1 came up here to take his
place”

  “Our general manager” exploded
the night despatcher

  “ Our general manager,” pursued the
superintendent “ It seems that what-
ever the charge was, he queered Sam with
the girl as well as the company, and in
six months married her himself, and I
guess it was that, more than the loss of
his job, that put Sam all to the bad, and
he must have gone to the bottom, for I
didn’t know him to-night until he told
me who he was

  “ He wanted me to place him, but I
couldn’t do anything for him, for the
Old Man had seen to it that he is on
the black book of every general manager
in the country, and it would have been
worth as much as my head I have a
wife and two little ones that must come
first	(

  “ I offered to stake him though, but
he straightened up in a semblance of that
old imperious way of his and said he
wasn’t looking for charity, he wanted a
job I told him then that 'the Old Man
was coming through to-night and that if
he would wait, I would see if something
couldn’t be done in the matter He turned
on his heel and went out I never saw
murder in a man’s eye, but—”

  “ DS, DS, DS—BR”

  “ The night despatcher opened the key
to answer the call, and the superintendent
went quietly back to his desk in the cor-
ner He was'about to ask how the spe-
cial was coming on, when he heard a
sharp exclamation behind him and
turned to see the night despatcher stand-
ing rigid in front of his key  his face was
as white as chalk

  “ Great Scott, man! I've put second 97
head-on into that special! ”

  “What do you mean” gasped the
superintendent, springing to his side
“ Speak, man! For heaven’s sake say
something! ”

   The night despatcher had fallen limp

in his chair, and the haggard face he
raised to his chief was like death He
pointed silently to the open order-book

left there ten minutes ago and Bradford
just said 97 had run his signal board and

  He was speaking calmly now, but his
slow, deliberate sentences came with a
metallic ring

   “ That means, he continued, “ that in
about twenty minutes from now that train
load of hogs will be going down Deanley
hill at a forty-mile clip, and about five
minutes later she will land on that spe-
cial, and—”

  “ And no night man at Deanley! ”
The superintendent groaned

   “ Yes,” affirmed the other, “ Price goes
home after No 11 passes And the
Old Man’s wife and daughter with him
too What’s that! ” he leaned toward
the sounder, which was clicking rapidly

  “What is it” asked the superin-
tendent

pistol - shot, then he began translating
slowly:

   “ Don’t worry up there DS, I’m not the

   The circuit went wide open and did not
close again, leaving the two staring at
each other in helpless amazement

   “ Sounds like a message from heaven,”
said the night despatcher in a whisper

  “ Tell Dave to get a move on there,
we don’t want to lay out that special,
called the conductor from the cupola

  He delivered his message and was re-
turning when he saw a tattered shoe pro-
truding from the door of a box' car

  “ Here This ain’t no Pullman Lim-
ited Clear out o’ here ! ” he called rough-
ly, and giving the foot a jerk, the form
of a man struck the frozen ground and
lay in a heap The brakeman swung to
the steps of the passing caboose, and the
tail-lights glimmered around the curve

  The man rose to his feet and steadied
himself with an effort, then staggered
across the snow-covered platform to the
door of the station It swung open against
his weight and he fell prone across the
floor of the little waiting-room A ruddy
glow from the smoldering fire came
through the open door of the stove a+id
petted the white upturned face with little
caressing touches of color

  For half an hour he lay thus, with no
sign of life save the quick rise and fall
of the stiffened coat at his chest, when on
the other side of the lattice partition
an instrument began pounding rapidly

  The man stirred uneasily and raised
himself upon his elbow, his eyes fixed
in a glassy stare He was listening in-
tently Suddenly he struggled to his feet
and stood with fists tightly clenched His
face was the face of a demon

  “ At last,” he sobbed “ At last! Hang

FATAL COURTESY

A GUILELESS rustic, wishing to be em-
ployed on a railway, emerged from the
examination-room and informed his father
he had failed because he was color-blind

“But you can’t have!” said his father
“You’re no more color-blind than I am”

  “ I know that, feyther,” he replied, “ but
it's all through bein’ polite”

  “What do you mean Explain yourself”
“ Well, feyther 1 went into a room, and a
chap held something up for me to look at
‘This is green, isn’t it’ ses he ‘Come,
now, you’re positive it’s green ' quite plead-
ing like and, though I could see plain

him! Hang him! And he’ll die like
the dog that he is! If she was only there

too—she—she! Oh, my Fanny!”

  A mighty passion shook him then slow-
ly, as the light breaking through a storm-
cloud, his features relaxed and the fire
illumined a transformed face

 Like a madman he flung himself
against the frail door and burst into the
office Tearing open cupboard and locker,
he at last found the lantern and hugged
it to him with a little inarticulate cry
In another instant he was at the stove
again, wrenching off the globe as he ran

  Insensible to the pain, he grasped a”
blazing coal and held it to the wick It
flickered and went out He flung it back
and picked another, and was successful

 He replaced the globe with shaking
hands and darted outside to the plat-
form where he hooked the lantern to the
signal-board Stumbling, he groped his
way back to the office and sank f into the
chair at the instrument-table

  Outside, above the howl of the increas-
ing storm, a locomotive uttered a single
shriek, which was echoed by another far
up the track, and a moment later the
two panting engines came to a shuddering
stop with their frosty noses almost touch-
ing A glimmer of ruby light fell softly
upon them from the swinging lantern

  ' Inside, they found the corpse of a man

JUST A HABIT

A NUMBER of railway men were once
discussing the question of accidents
“ The roads in Scotland, said one official,
“ used to have a bad name, indeed, in re-
spect to accidents No one thought of em-
barking on a railway journey unless he had
provided himself with an accident policy

  “ The famous Dr Norman MacLeod was
once about to set’ off on a long journey
through the Scotch country Just as the
train was pulling out the clergyman’s serv-
ant put his head through the window and
asked:

     Hac ye ta’en an insurance ticket, sir’
  “ ‘ I have,’ replied the doctor

  “  Then,’ continued the servant, ‘ write
ye’er name on it and gi'e to me They ha’e

had been a fruit-train, and I’d told them
to hold it for regular movement the next
day

  Connelly went up in the air about it
It seems that they had intended this train
to be delivered in New York the follow-
ing morning, and were going to put on
extra engines and give it tlie right of way
in order to get a big piece of traffic from
the south

  When T F came out, of course, he
had to be told what had happened Then
the general traffic manager came in, and
he had to be told and then, as if to add
insult to injury, the third vice-president
strolled in, and the whole blame thing was
gone over again

  You have been telling me a lot, dad,
about how T F can cuss I know, all
right, now If there wasn’t a cuss word
that he didn’t know, it was because he’d

that I’d lose my head I would have, too,

it through  and, by some good luck, we
happened to have a pilot down there who

-JIM TO THE OLD MAN

           EAR DAD : Of late, I’ve been
             having a pretty hard time
             of it at the office I was
             pretty well discouraged
             The reason I got discour-
             aged was on account of a
             little trouble I had with T F

  Martin, T F’s secretary, had been
homesick right along, and I’ve done all
of Martin’s work Of course, Mr Con-
nelly did some of it too, but when the
fruit season opened, Connelly had his
hands full attending to his own work, so
that I had to do all of the work by my-
self

  One day a rush wire came in asking
what should be done with a train of
peaches that was to be delivered us from
tlie S G and Q, at Fredericksburg, that
afternoon

  I’d been watching the fruit movements
for some time and as that was a part of
Martin’s work, and Connelly and T F
were very busy, I wired our people to re-
ice the cars at Fredericksburg, and hold
them for regular movement the next day

  Late that afternoon, T F was out talk-
ing with Connelly, and I heard Connelly
teil him that there had been no fruit-
train that day After T F left, 1 went
over to Connelly and told him that there

hack they had gone I didn’t think any-
thing of it until live o’clock, when I
couldn’t find them any more, and then I
told Connelly about it

   Coming so soon after the other trouble,
it made things look pretty badly The
worst of it was that we hadn’t taken a
record of the book numbers, and so
couldn’t tell which books were missing in
order to take them up when presented

eel a letter the next day by Connelly,
in which the general superintendent,
through his C C politely and gently in-
formed us that we were drunk

   Then, for a couple ofdays, little things
happened They just seemed to flow
along as if they had determined to flood
me under I got so that I was afraid to
shake hands with anybody for fear they
would drop dead

I felt as if everybody had it in for me
just because J happened to run into a lit-
tle streak of bad luck for one day And
somehow, when I get in that shape, I’m
not worth my bread and butter, so far as
work is concerned

There are lots of people in this world
who get down in the mouth one minute
and up in the clouds the next But you
know I'm not ojie of that class Still,
when things begin coming at all like the
way they did recently I just can’t help
feeling blue

1 have often thought it really doesn’t
amount to anything, for in
two weeks’ time I would
forget all about it and perk
right up again but I get in
the dumps once in a while,
and when I do, I stick

  I’m not going to make
you blue, however I’ll get
over it, I guess, in time

   Martin is still sick, and
I’m still with the railroad

BREEZY HEARD SOME ONE ENTER-THE OFFICE

He passed it up, however, although be
was supposed to report it to T F

  The next day I made a mistake of
twelve hours in reporting that 97, the fast
freight, had run late on a trip, and it
wasn’t until after a hot letter had been
written to the general superintendent
about it that we found out it was a mis-
take

LETTERS OF AN OLD RAILROAD MAN AND HIS SON 505

to tell you about a young friend of mine
who used to work in the superintendent's
office on the New York division twenty
years ago The boys called him Breezy
He was, too He was as breezy a sight
as ever blew down the pike

  One day the superintendent was sitting
in the inner office when he felt somebody
was standing before him, and looked up
It was a boy about nineteen, with hair
like red ink and a face full of freckles

  “ What is it ” asked the superintend-
ent

  “ How are you  ” asked the boy in a
kindly voice, holding out his hand

  The superintendent shook it

   I came after a job,” explained the
boy confidentially

  “ What job -”

  “ Office-boy”

  After talking to the bov a while, the
superintendent called in his chief clerk,
Swidges, and told him to give Breezy a
job as office-boy Nothing was heard of
him for about four months then one day
Breezy was in the office by himself when
the telephone-bell rang He hustled over
to it

  “ This the B and D_ ” he heard

  “ Yes, sir Who’s this”

  “ Adams & Co We’ve five cars of
chicks for Chicago Can you take ’em”
Breezy whistled The C C wasn't
down, but he had accidentally heard once
that the company had been trying to get
Adams & Co’s business for a long while,
lie did some quick thinking

  “Well” came impatiently over the
wire

  “Give me your number I’ll' let you
know in ten minutes” Then he called
up the freight-house

  “ Anybody down there ”

  “ No one but tlie watchmen and two
day men, sir”

  Breezy scratched his head “ Hold the
day men This is the superintendent’s
office There will be five cars of chicks
out to-day from Adams &: Co, for Chi-
cago Get the empties from the yard and
put them alongside the freight-platform
Hustle!

  “Exchange, give me D O” he
asked “This the train-master’s office”
“ Yes  who’s this ”

  “ The superintendent Mr Darrell”
His voice grew gruff “There'll be five

cars of chicks to go on 97 Hold 97 one
hour if necessary) then switch the cars out
with her”

  “Hold 97! Why, Mr Darrell—”

  So the bluff worked !- Danny’s throat
almost burst in his endeavor to speak
more gruffly “ I said hold 97 one hour
Isn’t that plain enough”

  “ All right, sir” D O rang off, grum-
bling

  Then Breezy did some more quick
thinking The crack fast freight of the

B	and D R R—No 97—was due
to leave at 430 pm It was now 330
Thirty minutes to load and send the
chicks down to the station, one hour to
load them in the car that made 97 thirty
minutes late!

  Just then the phone rang Breezy
jumped for it “Well”
“Superintendent’s office”

   “ Yes, sir  what it is ”

  “Those five cars of chicks—”
  “Well”

  “ We can’t get any empties No en-
gine to switch a car” It was the freight-
house

  Breezy groaned, then had an inspira-
tion

  “ All right I’ll attend to that Tele-
phone me when the cars reach the plat-
form and when they’re loaded” Then he
rang off, and called again: “ D O
please” Then, after a little wait: “ Hul-
lo, D O”

  “ Yes, sir”

  “This is Mr Darrell Run a switch-
engine out quick, to the east yard, to take
five empties to the west-bound platform
Telephone me when it leaves And do it
quick ! ” Breezv’s voice was eommand-
ingly deep

  “All right, sir”

  Then he called up Adams & Co “ Are
those chickens loaded  ”

  “ Yes, all ready”

  “ Send ’em down, then  we’ll take ’em
on 97”

  The man at the other end was silent
for a moment “ Who’s this” he asked
Breezy modestly gave his name “ We
won’t forget you,” assured the other
Breezy thanked him, then rang off

  D	O rang up “ No engine in service
but 97,” they reported

  “ 'l ake that,” he ordered desperately
Then he sat down and drew a deep

breath He was in, all the way over, and
he might as well see it through

  In three minutes the bell rang again

  “Those chicks just arrived,” reported
the freight-house “ Two men on the
wagon are helping us load them”

  “ How long will it take”

  “ About an hour, sir”

  “ All right I’ll give you thirty min-
utes The engine will be there then”

  “ We’ll try It’s pretty quick work,
though”

  The next thirty minutes Breezy lived
in suspense, and when the telephone-bell
rang he almost jumped for it “ Yes”
he asked eagerly

  “ Ninety-seven is just leaving,” he
heard “ They’ve, got the chicks”

  Breezy heard some one enter the office
and stop behind him, but resisted the de-
sire to turn

  “ You did very well,” he gruffly spoke
“ Thank you” The other fellow rang
off, and Breezy turned to the newcomer
It was the chief clerk

  “ Who was it  ” asked Swidges

  Breezy explained matters to him The
C C went up in the air He was a hard
man, and had never forgiven Breezy for
going over his head to get a job He
finished by telling Breezy he would report
the whole thing to the superintendent,
Mr Darrell The next morning the
superintendent came out of his office to
the C C’s desk, and Breezy prepared for
a storm

  “ That was pretty good work of yours
yesterday, Swidges,” he said

  The C C glanced up “ What’s
that”

  “ Those chickens on 97, yesterday,”
answered the superintendent

  Breezy’s heart jumped Now for the
storm!

  “ Oh yes,” answered the C C care-
lessly “ 1 had to figure pretty closely
on it, too”

  “ The traffic department called me up
yesterday evening, and told me about it,”
explained the superintendent “ They
say it’ll give us a big lot of trade in the
commission field You did splendidly”
He walked in his office again

  Then Breezy understood that the C C
hadn’t told him the truth, but he made up
his mind to keep quiet Just because he
did, Swidges disliked him all the more

  It was bard for Breezy to keep still,
however - One day he suggested to
Swidges that, by a change of stenog-
raphers on different desks, they could save
the salary of an extra man The C C
told him angrily that he wasn’t put there
to make suggestions the next time he
did it, he would be fired

  Then a long report was made to the
president, thegeneral manager, and the
genera] superintendent of the delays to
trains on all divisions Breezy saw where
the reports could be cut out and a daily
morning report made which would not
only be up to the minute, but only take
a few minutes to make

  He told the train-report man about it,
who told the C C, generously giving
Breezy the credit The change was made,
but the C C called Breezy up and told
him that after this he either had to attend
altogether to his own work, or quit

  That kind of thing would have dis-
couraged anybody with feelings, but
Breezy apparently didn’t have ’em

  The temptation to have a hand in run-
ning the road was irresistible One din-
ner hour, when the freight-office called
up to get the routing of a car, and every-
body was at lunch, Breezy, who had been
shown how to get routes by the routing
clerk, after hunting diligently, gave the
necessary instructions

  Three days later the traffic department
called up the superintendent’s office The
chief clerk answered the phone, and, after
quite a lengthy conversation, went in the
superintendent’s office	

  Then he came out again, called the
routing clerk, and retired with him to the
sanctuary again By this time the office
was listening wide-eared Breezy was
wondering what it was all about, when
the echoes of a heated argument came
through the door of the superintendent’s
office, followed by the routing clerk,
flushed with anger

  The train-report man, who was an old
friend of his, stopped him as he passed
“ What is it” he asked

sent it without instructions, and we’re go-
ing to lose all their competitive business”
Breezy suddenly remembered the car
he had routed a few days before He
was up in a second, and hustled inside
the superintendent’s office

  The C C was just getting up to come
out The superintendent was facing the
door “ Mr Swidges,” said Breezv “ I
did that”

  “ Did what  ”

  “ Routed, that car B and D, and
C V”

  “ You! ” exploded the chief clerk
Breezy nodded Everybody was out
of the office,” he explained, li and the
freight-house—”

  “I don’t want your excuses!” The

C	C’s voice shook with anger He
grasped Breezy’s arm “ Mr Darrell,
this boy has done more to destroy obe-
dience in this office than any man we've

ever had-up here I think it's time to let
him out”

  Breezy pulled his arm away and his
face flushed, but he did not answer The
superintendent looked gravely at him for
a moment Then he spoke

  “ Who told you to route the car that
way ” he asked

  “No one was in here at lunch-time but
myself,” he explained, “ and the freight-
house called up and said 97 was made up
with this car and they wanted a routing,
as she would leave in ten minutes, and I
told them to send it via Cumberland Val-
ley”

  The superintendent looked at the chief
clerk He shook his head “ The traffic
department are in the air about it' he
said “ It’s not his-fault, in a way, but—”
The telephone rang, and he broke off

  “ Yes, yes: this is Mr Darrell,” they
hearct
SOS

THE RAILROAD MAN’S MAGAZINE

  “ Mr Green Oh, yes Green & Co”
That was the firm that had shipped the
car What was coining now Breezy won-
dered

  “ We are very sorry, Mr Green—
what—delivered No, I didn’t know
that They called me up All right
Thank you sir” He hung up the re-
ceiver

  “ That was Dan Green,” he said to
Swidges Then he motioned to Breezy
to leave the room

  When the chief clerk cme out from
the inner office he said nothing to Breezy
or the routing clerk, who was still smol-
dering at his desk, lie began dictating,
and Breezy got up and went to his desk
“ Say, Mr Swidges—”

  “ Go to your work,” said the chief clerk
harshly

  The next day Breezy heard the full'
story The shipping man of Green &
Co had called up the traffic department
to give them instructions for routing, and
when he was told that the car had been
shipped by another route he immediately
notified the traffic department that it
would mean the loss of their entire com-
petitive business, whereupon the traffic
department had called up the chief clerk
and notified him to that effect

  Almost at the same time, Green & Co
had received notice of the delivery of the
car to the C V, and the time, three days,
was so startling that the head of the firm
had called up the superintendent and traf-
fic department, and, after congratulating
them, promised them all their business

  While the results were good, the in-
creased dislike of the chief clerk rendered
Breezy’s position almost unbearable, and
he was more uncomfortable because the
routing clerk wouldn’t let him come near
the routing desk again It drove him to
spend much of his time in the yards,
where he got a lot of valuable experience
that he would never have learned in the
office

  The peach season came on For ten
years the P F R R had cornered all
the peach movement from the South,
though their service was generally poor,
their facilities rotten, and they steadily
refused to improve them

  The Southern peaches amounted, in
season, to as high as fifty cars a day, and
the revenue was a nice little sum but

somehow, nobody had been able, toget it
away from the P F R R

  This year, however, the B and D got
after the business The result of the
traffic department’s work was a request
on the general superintendent to run a
daily train of two cars of peaches over
the B and D There wasn’t any profit
running two cars special, particularly to
New York markets, to which point there
was always a heavy run of traffic—unless
the traffic department could guarantee
that the amount would increase

 The traffic department very politely
declined to guarantee anything more than
two cars Finally the papers drifted
down to the New York superintendent for
schedule over his division and he, after
talking it over with his men, declined to
offer anything but movement on the regu-
lar local, when connection could be made

  Naturally, the question was talked
about a good deal and Breezy, out of
curiosity, got the papers and looked them
over They contained a lengthy state-
ment, of existing conditions, written by
the traffic department, and also a sched-
ule of Southern connections given by the
commercial agent at Atlanta

  Breezy, after reading the correspond-
ence over, decided that his road was be-
ing robbed of traffic that rightly belonged
to it That made him mad, and gave him
an idea

  He went out on an unofficial inspection
of the P F R R Then he saw his
friend the train-report man, and got him
to make up a schedule of special move-
ment over the New York division

  As the peaches were delivered at Wash-
ington practically the entire movement
lay with the New York division, except
for forty miles and, remembering what
the commercial agent at Atlanta had said,
Breezy showed his friend that the
peaches could leave Anacostia Junction,
just outside of Washington, and where
they were delivered, 011 94 in time to con-
nect with a special, and make early morn-
ing delivery in New York—something the
P F R R had not done for six years,
and meaning practically forty-eight hours
from the South to New York

  Then the B and D had a big pier,
practically unused The P F’s pier
was too small to accommodate all the
traffic Breezy explained that lie had seen
LETTERS OF- AN OLD RAILROAD MAN AND HIS SON 509

that himself, and had heard the buyers
complaining about it Another advan-
tage was that the B and D pier was near
the commission district, well lighted, and
with first-class accommodations for the
produce trade Wouldn’t his friend help
He had an idea

  His friend, the train-report man, be-
came enthusiastic whejvlie heard the great
idea and helped him to make up not

from the grinning buyer a promise that
if he got other names to the paper in his
pocket, he would give in his signature
The next day he went to see another man
When Breezy told him his name, the man
thought a moment, then said:

  “ Didn’t you take some chickens for us
to Chicago some time ago I’m Mr
Adams”

  “ Yes, sir”

I won't TELL YOU WHAT I THINK OF YOU

only a statement of existing conditions,
but also a statement of guaranteed forty-
eight-hour movement from the South to
New York City on the part of the B
and D

   With the caution to him not to tell any-
one, Breezy slipped out He went to the
auction sales, and followed the largest
buyers and commission people to their
stores Then one day he came down to
work dressed in his best suit During
the lunch-hour he disappeared, as usual,
and went to one of the men he had tracked
down

  He talked with him earnestly, con-
vincingly, and forcibly and after a for-
ty-five-minute conversation, extracted

  “Well, we owe you something for
that What can I do for you”

  Breezy explained his plan The man
asked him question after question and
when Breezy produced the schedule that
his friend the train-report man had pre-
pared, Mr Adams promptly signed his
name

  Bidding Breezy wait, he dictated a let-
ter, which he handed to Breezy, telling
him to give it to the first man he had
seen That gentleman, after reading the
letter, looked over Breezy curiously, and,
after talking to him a little while, added
his name

  When reezy showed the train-report
man those two names, that gentleman
510

gasped The great idea was making a hit
at last !

  The next day Breezy got two of the
largest commission men, who signed when
they saw the names he had secured

  Then, the following day, he got two
more names—both of them first tele-
phoning Adams & Co—and the great
work was done They were the control-
ling members of the Produce Exchange,
and with them for a lead, every small
buyer would follow

  Breezy determined to make it sure,
however, and on the sixth day he landed
the president of the Produce Exchange

  He returned to the office fifteen min-
utes late The C C called him over
“ This makes the fifth time you’ve been
late this week You can go”

  Breezy looked puzzled “Go! Go
where” he asked

  “ Go anywhere! You’re fired”

  Breezy looked at him in amazement
“ But, Mr Swidges—”

  “ I don’t want any excuses! Get out! ”
interrupted the C C, and, turning to his
stenographer, began dictating

  Breezy stared at him, still dazed
'• Mr Swidges, I’ve got the names here—”

  The C C looked up “ Haven’t you
gone yet Do you want to be put out ”

  Then rage suddenly entered Breezy’s
heart “ I won’t tell you what I think
of you ! ” he exclaimed and ere the sur-
prised C C could gather his wits, Breezy
seized his hat and departed hastily

  He walked home with his head up
Discouraged Not he he was just mad
—mad clear through After all he had
done— Then the dust bothered his eyes,
and he rubbed it out hastily

  Then he took his case in his own hands
The next day he called on the general
superintendent

  “ I want to show you a paper in my
possession” he said

  “ Sorry to hear you were fired,” said
the G S

  “ So am I,” replied Breezy, smiling

  “ Let’s see your paper” Breezy pro-
duced it The G S looked at it His
eyes opened wide He handed it to Dar-
rell “ We’ve been trying for ten years
jo get that traffic, and this boy stepped in
and got it in five days

  The superintendent read the names

(To be

signed to it Then he whistled “ By
George! ” he cried “ Why didn’t I think
of this before”

   “ Why didn’t any of us think of it be-
fore ” said the G S “ No, the boy has
got sound common sense” Then his
voice sharpened “ Mr Darrell, explain
to your chief clerk what vou want him
for”

  The superintendent turned to the C

C,	who was already shrinking

  “ How many passes have you sold
since you have been with us, Swidges”
he asked suddenly

  The C C turned as white as a sheet
He tried to speak, but couldn't 'The
superintendent produced a paper from his
pocket

  “ We’ve found two hundred here, so
far Maybe you can add to the list”
He turned to the G S “ By the way,”
he said, “do you remember that Adams
& Co gave us all their business 011 ac-
count of some chicks we moved for them
some time ago

  “ Well, they telephoned me this morn-
ing that this boy was the one that ar-
ranged the movement for them”

   He indicated Breezy with a wave of his
hand

  “ Yes,” answered the G S, “ I know
that, and a lot more” He turned to
Breezy “How old are you, Danny”
he asked

   “ Twenty, sir”

  The G S thought for a moment
“ I’m going to take this boy, Darrell,” he
said Then he turned to the C C—but
the C C had disappeared

  The superintendent glanced inquiring-
ly at his chief “ Let him go,” said
Thomas “ Maybe the poor fellow—”
Then he stopped, and spoke to Breezy
again “ I want you to report at my of-
fice to-morrow, Danny”

  Do you know where Danny is to-day
He’s third vice-president of the B and

D,	and I guess you see him almost every
day If he’d allowed himself to be dis-
couraged, where would he have landed
It’s the fellow who climbs over the rocks

           Old Purdue Drove Crippled 96 to Her Des-
           tination After a Braver Man Had Jumped

OUR drowsy engine crews,
cursing at the unex-
pected summons of the
caller, lounged sleepily
in the despatcher’s of-
fice at Crags It was a
little after midnight The air was pun-
gent with the smell of burning, pine,
and the men coughed as the bitter smoke
bit their lungs Behind the eight men
there skulked a great hulking fellow
whom none of the rest seemed to notice

  Suddenly the despatcher and the su-
perintendent of the division to the East
burst into the room The two eyed the
enginemen a moment, and then the des-
patcher said:

  “ Men I have called you all, for I
want a crew to volunteer to take a fast
engine and two cars up to the Lost
Horse Mine One car will be loaded
with Italian miners, the other will carry
tools and dynamite 1 will not order
any crew to go, nor any man The for-

est along the whole sixteen miles is on
fire and burning close to the tracks The
snow-sheds along the slope may be burn-
ing now It is a dangerous trip! ”

  He paused, and there were sleepy
curses in comment He eyed them again,
and again spoke slowly:

  “ I ask for these volunteers because
there was a cave-in at the Lost Horse
Mine an hour ago and the whole night-
shift is entombed! The day-shift is de-
moralized and the dynamite that should
have been put oif at the siding there
last night is in the yards here! With-
out it, the work of rescue cannot be
done! They are perhaps only dagoes—
but they are men Now, who will go”
Gallipel, the oldest of the engineers,
lifted his voice:

  “ And you want some of us fellers
to go up there and git blowed up in the
snow-sheds, eh Well, 1 won’t go”
Certain of his position with the su-
perintendent, Gallipel stumbled out His
fireman followed him Jones, the next
oldest and trusted -engineer, stepped for-
ward :

  “ I’d do it in a minute, sir, but you
know mv wife’s an invalid and there is
all my kids”

  “ I wouldn’t want you to go, Jones,”
the superintendent answered Jones and
his fireman stood, aside

  Masterson, the daredevil of the divi-
sion, stepped forward

  “ I cain’t go! I won’t go up against
a thing where they hain’t no chance!
Leave off the giant and I’ll pull her”

  “ But the giant must go, for the train
goes to save the miners in the cave-in'
We are not sending up there to add more
to the number that now sit round and
hold their hands! ” The superintendent
spoke sharply Masterson, with a self-
satisfied smile, stood aside with his fire-
man

  Parkman, the last of the four, stepped
out, hung his head, and stammered:

   “ I ain’t agoin’”

  The superintendent said nothing, and
Parkman and his fireman stood with the
others who had refused

  The hulking giant who had skulked
behind now shambled forward He tried
to square his shoulders, but they drooped
quickly: he tried to hold up his head,
but he only jerked his chin His eyes

blinked like those of an animal threat-
ened with blows on the face, and his
lips opened and closed without a word
There was something piteous in his atti-
tude The superintendent spoke not un-
kindly :

   il Purdue, the caller only brought you
because I forgot to tell him there was
no use”	v

   The coarse hands of the giant fluttered
for an instant and then he found his
voice:

   “ I’d like to have the chance”

   The superintendent smiled in spite of
himself, and Masterson snorted with
vast incredulity:

   “ Old Purdue! ”

  The gravest and most sympathetic
smiled the others roared

  The superintendent recovered his
equanimity and studied the frightened
face of the man before him Then he
said slowly:

   “ Purdue, you have been eligible for
an engine now for fourteen years You
know your record as well as any of us
As a fireman, you jumped half a doz-
en times when there never was a wreck
You never could have an engine on a
regular run under me You could not
have this one if there was any one else
to go

  “ But we have promised the manager
of the Lost Horse the men and powder if
we could get a crew to pull the train Find
you a fireman inside of twenty minutes,
and remember that if you jump this
time, you will never go back to tlife
roundhouse even as a wiper'”

   Old Purdue tottered out without stop-
ping to ask his favor of any of the fire-
men present As he passed, they saw
his face was white as chalk and that he
was trembling from head to foot

  The outcome w-as pleasing to the
crews that had refused to go It would
have to be developed by Old Purdue—
the grotesque and farcical Old Purdue
the man who hadn’t sufficient nerve to
fire the engine on a work train

  It was a joke to be enjoyed beneath
the noses of the superintendent and the
despatcher

  The superintendent listened to them
for an instant, and then his voice cut like
a knife:

  “ And when it is explained why no
THE LOST HORSE, LIMITED	513

help came to the entombed men, it will
appear that even a coward like Old
Purdue would have pulled the train
but all other enginemen were greater
cowards, and he could not get a man
to give him steam”

  Masters on sprang forward with
clenched fists and angry face and cried:
“ If he’ll give me steam I’ll handle
her”

  The superintendent ran to the door
and called Old Purdue He came, and
stood frightened, with his cap in his hand,
as if he feared permission had been
given to some one else

  “ Masterson has agreed to handle the
engine, Purdue, if you will fire for him
Will you do that”

  Old Purdue’s chin shook, and his hands
worked nervously as he an-
swered :

  “ I’d be glad to fire for
Masterson He’s a braver
man than me”

  The comparison struck the
risibilities of the crowd, and
all guffawed save Masterson

  Masterson was mad He
growled:

  “ And I’ll let you fire for
me, because you are a blun-
derin’ ass—and because I
might make a man of you!

And if you open your head
ag’in here in this crowd like
that, I’ll punch it for you!”

  What might have resulted
in horse - play was side-
tracked, for the superintend-
ent lifted awarning hand and
cautioned the men to remem-
ber that this was an expedi-
tion to save the lives of men

The swing to the gravity of
the occasion was accom-
plished when the despatcher
who had gone to the key for
a moment, returned with the
word:

  “All hope of rescue from
the other side is gone! The
bridge over Buffalo River
has burned! Carriton Siding
reports that the trestle over
Carriton Creek is likely to
catch fire at any time, and
he says that from his win-

   9	R R

dow he can see the fire licking away at
the spruce next the snow-sheds! Hurry,
or the debris will block the way! ”

  Without more ado the whole party
dashed down the stairs to the platform
outside The night was thick, but over
in the east there was the red glow of
the fires, and every now and then a puff
of wind brought clouds of pungent
smoke and heat

  Down by the roundhouse, an engine
gave two warning blasts, and then
dashed up to the platform on which they
stood It paused, and, leaving a car,
passed on

  “ The dynamite! ” the superintendent
muttered

  The engine shot by them, backing
down on a switch, and a moment later
514

THE RAILROAD MAN’S MAGAZINE

came tearing forward again with another
car through the rude windows of which
there gleamed faint lights That was
the car containing the miners Then
from down at the roundhouse came a
mighty wail, and the steady tolling of
a bell, and all murmured “ Old 96”

  An instant later 96 came rumbling
down the switch, paused, and backed
down to the coupling With the rescue

turned to the crouching and fear-struck
volunteer, and thundered:

  “ Old man! it’s a race fur life! Give
her steam! Give her steam! Give her all
there is in her, for I’ll use it all! And
if you start to jump, I’ll brain you!”
He turned and steadily opened the
throttle to the last notch and the speed
became terrific Old Purdue looked out
into the flying night, and it seemed as if

train Masterson grumbled some sort
of thanks for the best engine on the
division—the heaviest and fastest of the
heavy and fast for which that mountain
division was celebrated—and then clam-
bered proudly to his seat

  Old Purdue climbed in mechanically,
and did not turn his face to them
In response to the throttle, 96 swung
slowly ahead, but Old Purdue did not
look out, nor did he notice the men who
cheered Masterson

  When the last frog had rattled be-
neath the pounding drivers, Masterson

 -the old desire to jump would master him,
 but the shame and contumely of the past
 held him back with a stronger hand

   Mechanically he got the shovel going
 and fired carefully The dread of death
 had passed in Old Purdue—he had suf-
 fered its acutest agonies He fired as
 Masterson had never seen a man fire be-
 fore

   Old 96 leaped along like a thing gone
 mad until she took the grade There
 the steep ascent cut down her speed, but
 she was flying with the swiftness of an
 express Masterson, reckless though lie

 was, eased down the throttle notch by
 notch

   The steam in the gage showed 160,
 180, 190, 195 By five-pound advances
 the hand went round until 250 showed—
 and Old Purdue mechanically shoveled
 in the coal and mechanically swung to the
 door with lightning-like precision Mas-
 terson leaped across the cab, and yelled
 like a madman:

   “Hold up! Can’t you see the gage
 You’ll bust her b’iler! We don’t need
 steam going down! Drop that shovel, or
 I’ll brain you ! ”

   Old Purdue leaned against his side of
 the swaying cab and took a deep draft
 of the smoky air He looked forward
 and, for the first time saw the fire ahead
 The glow in the sky just over the grade
 was just what he had seen when the
 prairie burns by night In an instant,
 they had topped the grade and were
 dashing down

   Ahead there was an arch of leaping
 flames that swung like a low-flung ban-
 ner squarely across the tracks On either
 side, as far as the eye could penetrate,
 the lurid palls of fire leaped and burled
 upward and billowed in vast waves of
 smoke like a tempestrswept, infernal sea

   With an oath, Masterson threw on the
 air, and, reckless of the consequence to
 96, threw her over into the reverse Old
 Purdue, aware of what was going on,
 reeled back from the boiler against
 which the shock had thrown him and,
 hesitatingly yelled:

   “Ain’t you goin’ on”

   “Not on your life! A man would
 be a fool! I’ll back her iu home to
 Crags”

   Old Purdue shifted his feet as the en-
 gine slowed down and then on a sudden
 he threw up his head and hand: »

   “ I volunteered to take the train—and
the train is goin’! ” With that lie threw
'her over into the forward, shifted the
air and opened the throttle with a jerk

   Masterson struck once and ineffectual-
 ly at him, and, with a frightened glance
 at the burning sheds, jumped

   Old Purdue leaped up to the throttle
 side and, craning his head far out,
 studied the blazing bow toward which
 he was hurling As yet no timbers were
 sagging, nothing prevented his safe pas-
 sage through unless parts of the frame-

 work should give way as he advanced
 He thought of the possibility of the
 povvder-car catching fire, and opened the
 sand pipes lo give him greater speed

  The pilot entered the flaming portal,
and Old Purdue slipped over behind the
fire-box and began shoveling coal He
counted eight shovels, and, looking up,
saw no walls, of flame about the cab

  He looked again to the mounting
gage and then clambered onto the ten-
der He got the water-bucket and, fill-
ing it, crawled out onto the top of the
car containing the men

  From that position he saw that the
roof of the car behind was blazing in
two places—and the speed was fanning
the flames

  He balanced his bucket, ran nimbly
along the reeling deck of one car and
leaped to that of the other At the first
flame he spilled most of the water and
put out the fire there He went back
to the other and fought that with his
hands

  When the last ember was gone, he ran
back again, but even as he leaped to
the deck of the miners’ car, a gust of
flame swept up between

  He stumbled across the tender and
shut down He filled his bucket and
once more ran back and tin's time clam-
bered to the ground As he stood by
the blazing trucks that threatened each
breathless second to ignite the terrible
cargo above, he beat on the end of the
car ahead and cried:

   “ Out there ! Out—-and help ! ”

  In a moment the ground around him
was swarming with the frightened Ital-
ians He fought the fire with his bucket,
coming back each time with it replen-
ished, certain that each time would be
the last before the explosion would end
it all And then, seeing he could make
no headway alone, he ran to the cab and
seizing the coal-liammer, drove the cow-
ards to the work and made them beat
the flames

  When that was done he drove them
back into their car Then with reeling
brain he crawled into the cab, dimly
conscious of the fact that 96 was leak-
ing steam at joints that never had been
known to give, and that her safety-valve
was roaring louder than the flames

   He opened her throttle easily, fearful
516

THE RAILROAD MAN'S MAGAZINE

of the high pressure against the half-
cooled cylinders She moved off slowly
and for some unexplained reason did
not gather speed He threw the throttle
open wider, but she only took the pace
of an old freighter

  Purdue looked at the gage and saw
that the steam was down to a hundred
He looked far ahead and saw that the
trestle over Carriton was a mass of flame

  Without pausing, he bent to the task
of making steam Shovelful after shovel-
ful he scattered in, until a little more
would have choked the draft

  Then 96 began to take on life again
Old Pardue was glorying in her speed

  He looked forward again The trestle
was close at hand His heart leaped as
he saw that the rails lay true the whole
way across and that none of the ties
were burned off

  He pulled at the throttle, striving to
open it beyond its limit, and just as
the thing seemed done, there came a
splitting crash and 96 trembled from
peak to pilot, and her left-hand cab-
side vanished

  She jolted for a hundred yards or so
and came to a stop

  Old Purdue knew that keys came out
of drivers, and that when they did, con-
necting - rods, spinning like windmill-
sails, demolished whatever they touched

  He looked at the flaming trestle, and,
with a torrent of oaths, got crowbar and
wrenches and once more summoned the
men They came forth, gladly, all of
them They loosened the nuts as he
directed them, and they helped pry the
connecting-rod loose

  He ordered them to get in again, but
they ran away

  Old Purdue heaved a sigh that was
half relief, and again he crawled into
the cab of 96 He made more steam and
slowly opened the throttle, but she was
on center—the other cylinder was dead

  He got down, and with his crowbar
pinched her a little way, enough to give
her head

  Again he clambered to his' seat and
gave her steam She took it like the
cripple that she was and hobbled off He
watched her carefully and saw her
gathering speed and then he made more
steam

  Out onto the quaking trestle the

crippled train dragged its way The
timbers beneath cracked and some of
them fell down, sending up embers and
clouds of sparks andsullen sounds The
heat grew terrific, the cab was full of the
smell of blistering paint, and the roar of
the flames was mighty

  But Old Purdue, who had passed the
fear of death, mechanically shovelecTcoal

  At length, crawling, crippling, and
thumping with her one cylinder, 96
gained the far approach—she groaned
on a little farther and the train was clear

  Old Purdue shut down and went back
again with his bucket to put out the fire
that he knew would be burning under
the car of dynamite It was there, and
again he fought it Time and again he
dashed to and fro The strength of the
man’s body was gone, but the will of Old
Purdue drove him on

  All the profitless life of the man was
focused in this pressing moment to accom-

THE improvements that busy minds are devising- to make the American
locomotive faster and stronger rank well up in line with the best
achievements of to-day

     Since the old eight-wheel, or American type, in 1876, the steam-engine
lias gone through successive stages of betterment, until to-day we have the
marvelous greyhound of the rails, with her Walschaert valve-gear, super-
heated steam, improved superheaters, and other new things and the end is
not yet Let him who thinks that the time of the locomotive is on the wane,
read this—and change his mind

    We are indebted to the American Locomotive Company for some of the
information given in this article

The Past Thirty Years Has Been the Period of the Locomotive’s
Greatest Development—The Importance of the Walschaert Valve-
Gear and Superheated Steam in Recent Construction

j»,>ftajfrErORE 1876—the year of the
Centennial Exposition at
Philadelphia—American lo-
Icomotive practise had be-
come, to a certain extent,
standardized and certain
types had been generally adopted for the
various classes of service

  For fast passenger service, the eight-
wheel, or American, type was almost uni-
versally used at that time This type was
also used to some extent in freight serv=
ice Where the requirements demanded a
greater power than could be provided with
the four coupled wheels of the American
type, the ten-wheel type, with six coupled
driving-wheels and a four-wheel leading
truck, was employed

  This latter type was also extensively
used in freight service, and, as at the
present time, was Considered a very sat=
isfactory type for mixed service—that is,
either passenger or freight

In freight service, the mogul type, with

517

six coupled driving-wheels and a two-
wheel leading truck, and the consolida-
tion type, which was a development of
the former by the addition of another pair
of driving-wheels, were generally used

  At this time the eight-wheel type had
attained a total weight of seventy = five
thousand pounds, and the hauling of
three hundred and thirty-six tons 011 a
level road at an average speed of thirty-
five miles an hour without stops was con-
sidered a very good record in passenger
service

  When we compare such engines with
those built by the American Locomotive
Company, weighing two hundred and
twenty-six thousand pounds, which to-day
handle the Twentieth Century Limited—
the eighteeurhour train between tyew York
and Chicago—and maintain a speed of
sixty miles an hour over a level road with
a train of six hundred tons, we realize the
tremendous growth of the locomotive
during the past thirty years
518

THE RAILROAD MAN’S MAGAZINE

  In the ten-wheel mogul and consolida-
tion types, weights of 84,000, 80,000, and
100000 pounds, respectively, were com-
mon To-day the American Locomotive
Company is building a freight-locomotive
for the Delaware and Hudson Company
which will weigh 441,000 pounds

Ten-Years’ Development

  From 1876 to 1886 there was a great
increase in the weight and power of loco-
motives The development was along
well-established lines, there was little de-
parture from standard practise, and no
new principles were introduced

  This period, however, saw the intro-
duction of a new type of wheel arrange-
ment—the decapod, so called because it
had ten driving-wheels Like the con-
solidation type, the decapod had a two-
wheel leading truck and was merely a
development of the former type to meet
special conditions and provide greater
power without overloading the rails

  About this time, however, a very dis-
tinct departure was made from existing
locomotive practise by the introduction
of the compound principle Hitherto,
American locomotive designers had given
little attention to improving the efficiency
of the locomotive but now the demand
arose for greater economy in operation

  Compounding was universally used in
marine and stationary practise, where
high duty and great economy were de-
sired, and this principle had also been
employed in locomotive practise in Eu-
rope with more or less success

  In the effort to satisfy the demand for
saving in coal and water, locomotive de-
signers in this country, naturally, turned
their attention to the development of a
compound locomotive adapted to Ameri-
can conditions In 1889 the Baldwin
Locomotive Works brought out a com-
pound locomotive, built after designs
by S M Vauclain, of that company

The First Compounding

  This system of compounding was first
applied to an eight-wheel engine built
for the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad,
and employed the use of four cylinders—
a high and low pressure cylinder on each
side of the engine

  The two cylinders on each side were
placed one above the other, and both pis-
tons were connected to the same 'cross-
head The steam distribution to the two
cylinders on each side was controlled by
a single hollow' piston-valve operated by
the ordinary form of Stephenson shifting-
link motion

  A device was provided, consisting of a
three-way cock operated by the engineer,
by means of which, in starting, steam from
the boiler was allowed to pass from one
end of the high-pressure cylinder to the
other, and thence through the valve to the
steam end of the low-pressure cylinder

  A large number of locomotives of this
type were built, but the economies ef-
fected in coal and water consumption
were offset by an increased cost of main-
tenance due largely to the use of a single
cross-head for the high and low pressure
cylinders

  As the power in the cylinders was not
equal, the cross-head was subjected to un-
equal strains, causing in many cases fail-
ure of that part and making it impossible
to keep the piston-rod packing tight

The Vauclain Four-Cylinder

  Because of these objectionable features
of design, the Vauclain four - cylinder
compound is but little used to-day but
it was among the first compound locomo-
tives to meet with any success in this
country, and constitutes one of the most
important steps in the development of
the modern American locomotive

  In the same year that the Vauclain
four-cylinder compound was introduced,
the Schenectady Locomotive Works
brought out a two - cylinder compound
engine, built under patents granted to
A J Pitkin

  The feature of this system of- com-
pounding was the intercepting - valve,
which was so designed as to admit live
steam at reduced pressure into the low-
pressure cylinder in starting, and prevent
the pressure backing up against the high-
pressure piston and to automatically
change to the compound position when
the pressure in the receiver-pipe, located
in the smoke-box, reached a certain
amount

  This system also included a so-called
separate exhaust-valve, operated by the
PROGRESS IN LOCOMOTIVE BUILDING	519

engineer, which permitted the exhaust
steam from the high-pressure cylinder to
be diverted directly to the stack and the
locomotive operated as a single-expansion
engine with materially increased power

  One of the first examples of this type of
compound was built for the Michigan
Central Railroad, and its performance
was very satisfactory Like all the earlier
types of compounds, however, it has seen
its day, and few of this type are now
built '

  Another type of two-cylinder compound
engine was scon after brought out by the
Richmond Locomotive Works in which
the Mellin system was employed

  The Richmond compound was iden-
tical in principle with the Schenectady
compound, but differed essentially from
the latter in the design of the intercepting
and separate exhaust-valve From the
standpoints of simplicity of design and
operation, economy of fuel and water,
and low cost of maintenance, it has
proved very successful

  Though, as applied to two-cylinder en-
gines, the use of the Richmond or Mellin
system of compounding is at the present
time limited, this same system is a dis-
tinctive feature of the Mallet articulated-
compound locomotives built by the Amer-
ican Locomotive Company, which type
will be considered later

The Compound’s Future

  The introduction of the compound en-
gine may be considered largely responsible
for another important improvement in
American locomotive design—namely, the
use of the piston-valve

  As the locomotive increased in size and
power, and larger cylinders were used,
the valves controlling the distribution of
steam to the cylinders were necessarily-
made larger in order to admit larger vol-
umes of steam

  At this time the flat side-valve, even in
simple engines, had reached such propor-
tions that difficulty was experienced in
perfectly balancing it The unbalanced
weight of the-valve put a great strain on
the gear, causing the parts to spring, if
not to break, and also made it hard to
handle the reverse-lever

  The combined effort of the engineer
and fireman was often required to “ hook

up ” the reverse-lever To overcome these
difficulties it became necessary to evolve
some new design of valve, and the cylin-
drical form, commonly known as the pis-
ton-valve, in which the pressure on al!
sides was equal, giving almost perfect bal-
ance, was introduced

  Although the first instance of the use
of the piston-valve on an American loco-
motive antedated the introduction of the
compound, its first successful application
was in the case of the Vauclain four-
cylinder compound locomotive, where it
was necessarily employed

  On two-cylinder compound locomotives
the piston-valve soon came into general
use

Making Engines Simpler

   In the application of 'his type of valve
to simple locomotives, the Brooks Loco-
motive Works took the lead of other loco-
motive-bu i lders

  Tht many advantages of the piston-,
valve over the balanced slide-valve, par-
ticularly its nearly perfect balance and its
adaptability to any type of valve-gear,
have led to its general use at the present
time on simple as well as compound en-
gines, although some motive-power men
still prefer the latter type, the design of
which has been improved so as to give
more perfect balance

  About the time that the early types of
compound locomotives were being devel-
oped, the requirements of passenger serv-
ice had become so severe that they had
almost outgrown the capacities of the then
favorite types of passenger-engines

  In 1893, the eight-wheel passenger-en-
gine had reached its highest development
in the class represented by the famous
locomotive No 999, of the New York
Central Lines, which was exhibited at the
World’s Fair in Chicago

  As the speed of passenger-trains in-
creased locomotives were required with a
larger steam-making capacity than could
be provided in the eight-wheel type In
this type, with the larger driving-wheels
required for high-speed service, the fire-
box is necessarily placed between the
driving-wheels, and the amount of grate
area available is consequently limited
Not only is the grate area limited, but
also the heating surface
520

THE RAILROAD MAN’S MAGAZINE,

  In order to secure a larger boiler and
sufficient grate area to provide for the
large fuel consumption required in fast
passenger service, a new type of wheel
arrangement was introduced in 1893 by
the Baldwin Locomotive Works This
was called the Columbia type, and had a
two-wheel leading truck, four coupled
driving - wheels, and a pair of trailing
wheels, over which the fire-box was
placed

Advantage of Trailers

  The advantage of the use of trailing
wheels in this design was quickly recog-
nized They permitted a large grate area
in a satisfactory design of wide fire-box
adapted to burning soft coal by placing
the fire-box over these wheels The Co-
lumbia type, though not itself extensively
adopted, was the forerunner of the types
of engines which have since become the
favorites for high-speed passenger service

  Soon after the Columbia type appeared,
the Atlantic type, with a four-wheel lead-
ing truck, four coupled driving-wheels,
and two-wheel trailing truck, was intro-
duced, and soon became popular, super-
seding the eight-wheel type

  In 1901, the Brooks Locomotive Works
introduced another type of high duty pas-
senger-engine, having a two-wheel lead-
ing truck, six coupled driving-wheels, and
a pair of trailing wheels The first exam-
ples of this type, called the Prairie, were
built for the Lake Shore and Michigan
Southern Railway, on which road it be-
came the favorite type of passenger-en-
gine

  Owing to the fact that most motive-
power men consider a four-wheel leading
truck essential to safety for an engine run
at high speeds, the Prairie type was never
very extensively employed in passenger
service, but is largely used in freight serv-
ice

  When the weight of passenger-trains
outgrew the power that could be pro-
vided with only four coupled driving-
wheels, the design of passenger - engine
known as the Pacific type was introduced
This was a development of the Atlantic
with an added pair of driving - wheels
This type is to-day, the favorite for the
most severe passenger service, and, it
might be said, has taken the place of its

predecessor, tlie Atlantic type, on most of
the roads in this country

  During, this period, locomotive design-
ers had been endeavoring to improve the
compound locomotive

  The two-cylinder type had not met with
the success anticipated, and although the
Vauclain four-cylinder type'was quite ex-
tensively used, its faults were clearly rec-
ognized

  In 1900, the Schenectady Locomotive
Works brought out a four-cylinder com-
pound in which the two cylinders on each
side were placed one ahead of the other
or in tandem, and the two pistons were
mounted on a single piston-rod connected
with its cross-head

  A similar arrangement of cylinders had
been” previously introduced by the Brooks
Locomotive Works in 1893, but had not
proved successful, owing to certain com-
plex features of the valve arrangement

  In the Schenectady tandem compound,
these faults were corrected By setting
the cylinders tandem the power of both
cylinders was exerted along the same line,
thus overcoming tlie most serious defects
in the Vauclain four-cylinder compound
—namely, the connecting of two cylinders
of unequal power and in different hori-
zontal planes with the same cross-head

  A number of this type of compound
were built, but, as has been the case with
all the earlier types of compound engines,
it has been superseded by other and later
types

Increase in Weight

  The period from 1893 to 1904 saw an
enormous increase in the wreight and
power of both passenger and freight en-
gines A comparison between the engines
exhibited at tlie World’s Fair in Chicago
in the former year and the locomotives at
the Louisiana Purchase Exposition in the
latter year showed that during these
eleven years the average total weight of
passenger-engines had increased fifty-one
per cent and the weight on driving-wheels
thirty-three per cent In the case of
freight-engines, the increase in the aver-
age total ’weight was forty-six per cent,
and fifty-four per cent on driving-wheels

  During this period, the Consolidation
type had become the standard heavy
freight-engine, and had reached its pres-
PROGRESS IN LOCOMOTIVE BUILDING

521

ent limit in power in two locomotives built
for the Bessemer and Lake Erie Railroad
in 1900 by the Pittsburgh Locomotive
works These engines had a total weight
each of 250,300 pounds, and the cylinders
were twenty-four inches in diameter and
thirty-two inches in stroke

  Where the conditions required a greater
weight on driving-wheels than could be
provided in the Consolidation type with-
out overloading the rail, other types of
wheel arrangements were introduced

  Notable among these was the famous
Santa Fe type, so called because it was
first used on the Atchison, Topeka and
Santa Fe Railroad This type has a two-
wheel leading truck, ten driving-wheels,
and a trailing truck

  It reached its highest development in
the class represented by the tandem com-
pound locomotive built for the Santa Fe
by the Baldwin Locomotive Works, ex-
hibited at the' St Louis Exposition, which
had a total weight of 287,000 pounds

  The Mikado type, having a two-wheel
leading truck, eight coupled driving-
wheels, and a two-wheeled trailing truck,
was also developed to meet special service
conditions, and is now quite extensively
used in freight service

  On roads having long and steep grades,
the increase in weight and power of the
standard freight-engine had, at this time,
created conditions which it was hard to
meet with the existing types of locomo-
tives

The Mallet Articulated

  In order to pull a train up these grades,
which the road engine could easily handle
over the remainder of the road, it was
often necessary to use several helpers, or
pushing engines, which entailed both ex-
pense and delay in moving the traffic

  To meet these conditions, the American
Locomotive Company, in 1904, introduced
the Mallet articulated-compound locomo-
tive This type of locomotive, which de-
rived its name from its designer, Anatole
Mallet, a prominent French engineer, had
been successfully used in mountainous
sections of Europe for several years to
meet conditions analogous to those exist-
ing in this country

  It remained for the American Loco-
motive Company, however, to modify and

adapt this design to meet American re-
quirements

  This type is practically two locomo-
tives combined in one, and employs two
sets of engines under one boiler There
are four cylinders compounded together
The two pairs of cylinders are connected
to independent groups of driving-wheels
The rear group of wheels, which are
driven by the high-pressure cylinders, is
carried in frames which are rigidly at-
tached to the boiler, to which the cylin-
ders are also secured in the usual manner

  The front group of wheels with the
low-pressure cylinders are, however, car-
ried in frames which are not rigidly at-
tached to the boifer, but which have a
center-pin connection with the rear group,
being thus, in effect, a truck which is capa-
ble of swiveling radially around its pivot

Weight Equally Distributed

_ The advantage of this type of construc-
tion is that it provides a locomotive with
a short, rigid wheel-base, capable of easily
passing through curves of very short ra-
dius, with the weight distributed over a
long total wheel-base and a large number
of axles, so that an enormous total weight
can be provided without excessive weight
on the individual wheels

  The first engine of this type was built
for the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad It
had twelve driving-wheels, arranged in
two groups of six each Its enormous
weight of 334500 pounds exceeded any-
thing that had previously been dreamed of
as possible in a single engine

  At first, railroad men spoke of it as
“ freakish ” and “ monstrous,” and pre-
dicted all kinds of failures for it Con-
trary to all predictions, it has proved suc-
cessful from every standpoint, and was
the forerunner of what, to-day, promises
to be the most efficient freight-engine of
the future

  On the Baltimore and Ohio, this engine
soon earned the nickname “ Maud, forc
the famous mule which could move any-
thing it went up against

  The articulated-compound type lends
itself very readily to the concentration of
enormous power in a single engine, and,
since its introduction, a large number
have been built for various roads

The record for weight established by
522

THE RAILROAD MAN’S MAGAZINE

the Baltimore and Ohio engine was soon
exceeded by the construction, for the Erie
Railroad, by the American Locomotive
Company, of three engines of the articu-
lated type having sixteen driving-wheels
and a total weight of 410,000 pounds
each

  The Baldwin Locomotive Works, as al-
ready mentioned, have recently built two
engines of this type for the Southern Pa-
cific having a total weight of 425000
pounds six more are under construction
by the American Locomotive Company,
weighing 441,000 pounds each

  Although originally introduced for
helping or pushing service, the articulated
tvpe of locomotive has proved itself very
efficient as a road engine and offers the
possibility of increasing the capacity or
a division and moving the greatest amount
of traffic over the line at the least oper-
ating cost

What Walschaert Gear Is

  The introduction of the Mallet type of
locomotive led to another important in-
novation in American locomotive prac-
tise namely, the use of the Walschaert
valve-gear

  In the Mallet type of locomotive, the
flexible receiver-pipe between the high and
low pressure cylinders being located be-
tween the frames on the center line of
the engine, it was impossible to use the
ordinary Stephenson valve-gear The
Walschaert valve-gear, which is located
outside of the driving-wheels, was, con-
sequently, applied to the Baltimore and
Ohio Mallet engine

  This type of gear, which derives its
name from the inventor, Egide Wal-
schaert, was patented in Belgium in 1844,
and soon became the standard type of
valve motion on the railroads of Europe,
even as the so-called Stephenson shifting
link motion, which was invented in Eng-
land about the same time, was adopted in
America

  Although William Mason, one of the
most prominent of early American loco-
motive-builders, had attempted to intro-
duce the Walschaert valve-gear into
American locomotive practise in 1876,
and had exhibited an engine -equipped
with that type of gear at the Centennial
Exposition, he did not meet with any suc-

cess, as he was ahead of his time, and the
American railway world was not then
ready to adopt a new valve motion

  As the locomotive lias increased in
weight and power, the parts of the valve-
gear have reached such proportions that
there is hardly room enough between the
frames of a modern heavy freight or pas-
senger engine for the accommodation of
a satisfactory design of Stephenson valve-
gear

  With the Stephenson valve-gear, the
parts are so crowded together between
the frames that it is almost impossible
for the engineer to give them proper in-
spection or lubrication

  The application of the Walschaert
valve-gear to the Baltimore and Ohio
Mallet engine again directed the attention
of American locomotive designers to it as
a means of meeting present-day condi-
tions

  Being located outside of the frames,
this type of gear is perfectly accessible
for inspection and lubrication, so that it is
much more easily maintained than the
Stephenson gear Moreover, by remov-
ing the valve-gear from between the
frames, a better opportunity is afforded
to introduce a strong system of frame-
bracing, thus tending to reduce frame
failures

  The principal difference in action be-
tween the two types of gears is that the
Walschaert valve - gear gives a constant
lead at all cut-offs, while with the usual
construction of the Stephenson valve-gear
the lead increases as the reverse lever is
“ hooked ” up

  The superior advantage of the Wal-
schaert valve-gear oVer the Stephenson
link motion in the matter of accessibility
has led to its use on all of the most im-
portant American railroads, and, to-day,
it has almost taken the place of the Ste-
phenson gear as the standard type of valve
motion

Another Improvement

  About the same time that the Mallet
articulated - compound locomotive ap-
peared, another important advance was
made in the development of the American
locomotive by the introduction of the
four-cylinder balanced compound loco-
motive
PROGRESS IN LOCOMOTIVE BUILDING

  In all reciprocating engines, some pro-
vision has to be made to counteract the
disturbing effects of the horizontal mov-
ing of reciprocating parts, such as pis-
tons, cross-heads, etc In locomotives
having two crank-pins and main rods, this
is accomplished by placing a certain
amount of weight over that required to
balance the revolving parts in the driving-
wheel counterbalances opposite the crank-
pin

  Except when the piston is at either end
of the stroke, this excess weight exerts a
vertical force due to the centrifugal ac-
tion, which increases or decreases the nor-
mal pressure of the wheel on the rail ac-
cording as the counterbalance is below or
above the center of the wheel, causing
what is commonly called the “ hammer
blow”

  The vertical force of this excess weight
is greatest when the counterbalance is at
the top or bottom quarter of its revolu-
tion In the modern high-speed passen-
ger-engine, with its heavy reciprocating
parts, this vertical force is frequently ex-
cessive, and causes serious injury to the
track

  To overcome this difficulty, European
locomotive designers had developed the
four-cylinder balanced compound loco-
motive in which the driving mechanism is
so arranged that the reciprocating weights
balance each other

  This type of engine also provided all
the advantages of the compound prin-
ciple in the way of increased capacity and
improved economy, and offered the means
of meeting the increasing weights of
trains and severe requirements of service
without increasing the weight and size of
locomotives, the limit of which seemed to
have already been reached

No Increase in Size

  American locomotive designers conse-
quently directed their-efforts toward mod-
ifying and adopting the European de-
signs to meet conditions in this country

  In 1902, the Baldwin Locomotive
Works brought out a four-cylinder bal-
anced compound locomotive built after
the designs of S M Vauclain The first
engine of this type was a ten-wheel loco-
motive built for the Plant System

In the Baldwin balanced compound

523

engine the four cylinders are placed side
by side, usually with their centers in the
same horizontal plane, the two low-pres-
sure cylinders being outside the frames
and the two high-pressure cylinders in-
side

  The cylinders are cast in two parts,
with “ half-saddle ” as usual, each part
containing a high and low pressure cylin-
der with their valve-chest above and be-
tween them

  Steam distribution to the two cylinders
on each side is controlled by a single
piston-valve, operated by a single valve-
gear In the earlier engines of this type
the Stephenson link motion was employed,
but many of the subsequent designs have
been equipped with the Walschaert valve-
gear

In Opposing Motion

  The main rods of the high-pressure
cylinders connect to one of the axles,
which is cranked for that purpose, while
the two low-pressure cylinders are con-
nected to crank-pins on the driving-,
wheels in the usual manner

  The cranks of the driving axles on the
same side of the locomotive are 180 de-
grees apart In other words, when one
of the pistons is -at the front end of its
cylinder, the other _piston on that side is
at the back end of its cylinder, and the
horizontal or reciprocating parts are thus
in opposing motion, and, consequently,
balance each other without the need of
excess balance in the wheels

  In the ten-wheeled or Atlantic type
engines, the inside main rods are usually-
connected to the leading axle, while the
outside main rods are connected to either
the front or second pair of driving
wheels, as may be preferred

  In cases where ‘the leading driving
axle is so close to the cylinders that it
is impossible to connect the higli-press-
ure cylinders to it without making the
main rod too short, as in the Pacific and
Prairie types, they are connected to the
second driving axle

  In such cases, either the inside cylin-
ders are inclined at such an angle that
the main rods will clear the front axle,
or else the main rods are constructed
with a loop of bifurcation which em-
braces the leading axle
524

THE RAILROAD MAN’S MAGAZINE

  Two years after the appearance of the
Baldwin balanced compound engine, the
American Locomotive Company intro-
duced a compoimd engine in iwhich the
balanced principle was employed, built
after the designs prepared by F J Cole,
consulting engineer of the company

  In this type of compound, the low-
pressure cylinders are outside the frames
and the high-pressure cylinders are in-
side, but located ahead of the low-press-
ure cylinders, following the arrangement
employed in the famous De Glehn bal-
anced compound locomotive which had
been so successful abroad

In One Casting

  Separate valves are used for the high
and low pressure cylinders on the same
side of the engine, but these are mounted
on a single valve stem operated by a sin-
gle valve motion

  Both high - pressure cylinders, with
their respective valve-chambers, are in
one casting while the low-pressure
cylinders, with their valve-chambers, are
cast in pairs with “ half-saddles,” in the
manner usual in single expansion en-
gines The valve-chambers of the high-
pressure cylinders are in exact line with
those of the low-pressure cylinders, the
two being connected together so as to
form a continuous valve chamber

  This arrangement of cylinders permits
of balancing the reciprocating parts and
also of dividing the application of
power between two driving axles with
the least change from the usual construc-
tion of single expansion engines

  By placing the high-pressure cylin-
ders ahead of the low pressure, the in-
side main rods can be connected to the
leading axle in all the present types of
passenger-engines and a good length of
min rod secured without increasing the
length -of the wheel-base

  This al'O involves a corresponding in-
crease in the length of the boiler and
flues, which latter course must be fol-
lowed to obtain the same results where
the four cylinders are placed abreast, as
in the case of the Baldwin balanced
compound

  Although it cannot be said that the
four-cylinder balanced compound has
been generally adopted, it offers impor-

tant advantages and it would seem that
the further development of the passen-
ger-engine will probably be along the
line of the four-cylinder engines—either
the balanced compound, the balanced
simple, or the articulated compound type

  In this connection it is interesting to
note that the American Locomotive
Company has recently built two Atlantic
type passenger-engines for the Chicago,
Rock Island and Pacific Railroad, hav-
ing four simple cylinders arranged on
the balanced principle and using super-
heated steam

  Simplicity of construction has always
been the keynote of American locomo-
tive practise The complications in de-
sign resulting from the application of
the compound principle to locomotives
is one of the main reasons why the com-
pound locomotive has not met with the
success in this country that it has abroad

  American railroad officials, however,
are alive to the necessity of unproved
economy, and the effort to effect this and
avoid the disadvantage of the compound
principle has led to the introduction ~bf
another important principle in American
locomotive practise

Superheated Steam

  This principle is the application of
superheated steam to locomotives Super-
heated steam is nothing more nor less
than very hot steam It is steam of a
higher temperature than that which it
attains in the boiler in being raised to
the boiler pressure By separating the
steam from the water from which it is
generated and passing it over very hot
surfaces, additional heat can be added
to it This is what is done in a loco-
motive

  When steam enters a locomotive cyl-
inder it becomes cooled by coming into
contact with the cylinder walls and it
becomes further cooled by performing
work in the cylinder If the steam is
of ordinary temperature, a large amount
of it is turned into water because of
this cooling process, and passes through
the cylinder without doing any work and
is, therefore, wasted

 Every engineer knows that, besides
doing no work, this water in the cylin-
ders is dangerous, and, if not released,

causes broken cylinder-heads, bent pis-
ton-rods, etc The use of superheated
steam offers the means of preventing
the steam being turned into water, or
what is commonly known as cylinder
condensation since all the heat that is
added to the steam may be given up
before it is cooled down to the point
of where it becomes water

  By adding sufficient heat to the steam,
therefore, all the loss of power which
otherwise occurs can be prevented and
a great saving in coal and water effected

  Superheated steam has another im-
portant advantage, inasmuch as its tem-
perature is increased, its volume is also
increased, so that it will take a less
weight of steam to fill the cylinders if
the steam is superheated than if it is
at an ordinary temperature A further
saving in coal and water to do a given
amount of work is thus effected

  Although the advantages to be de-
rived from tlie use of superheated steam
were fully appreciated by locomotive de-
signers, and although numerous attempts
to apply it to locomotives were made in
the early days of locomotive building,
it is only comparatively recently that
this principle has been successfully in-
troduced into locomotive practise

Recently Introduced

  In 1S97, Dr William Schmidt, of
Germany, invented a design of super-
heater which was applied to two en-
gines on the Prussian State Railway

  In 1904, the American Locomotive
Company brought out a superheater aft-
er the designs prepared by F J Cole,
who was also responsible for tlie four-
cylinder balanced compound built by
that company

  This design was applied to several en-
gines, and considerable saving in fuel
and water effected Since that time over
300 locomotives equipped with super-
heaters have been built by that company
All of the superheaters applied by the
American Locomotive Company have
been of the fire-tube type that is, a num-
ber of ordinary boiler tubes are replaced
by larger tubes, in which are placed the
superheater pipes through which the
steam has to pass on its way from the
throttle to the cylinders

  With this arrangement, the hot gases
direct from the fire are utilized to super-
heat the steam and high temperatures
are obtained, by which only can be se-
cured tlie greatest advantages that are to
be derived from superheated steam

Improved Superheaters

  In the latest form of the American
Locomotive Company’s superheater,
each of the large tubes 'contains four
superheater pipes which, as they emerge
from the tube, are bent around horizon-
tally to meet the header or steam boxes
which are located in either side of the
smoke-box These headers are divided in-
to two compartments, and steam from the
throttle enters one compartment and
passes into the superheater pipes

  It flows over the hot surfaces of these
pipes, from which it receives additional
heat and is carried back again to the
other compartment of the header, from
whence it enters the cylinders

  Two forms of this design are in use,
one gives a very high degree of tempera-
ture and the other a moderate degree

  Superheated steam has been used on
the Canadian Pacific Railway to a much
greater extent than on any other Ameri-
can road The present standard super-
heater on this road is also of the fire-
tube type, of the design known as the
Vaughan-Horsey type, after the names of
its inventors, H H Vaughan, assistant
to the vice-president, and A W Horsey,
district master mechanic of the Cana-
dian Pacific Railway

  Following the introduction of the
Cole superheater, the Baldwin Loco-
motive Works brought out a design of
superheater of the smoke-box type, in
which the waste gases in the smoke-box
are utilized to superheat the steam As
the temperature of the gases in the
smoke-box are not sufficiently high to
give'very much superheat, comparatively
little economy is effected by this type of
superheater, and the most approved
practise, here and abroad, is to use the
fire-tube type of superheater-

  The application of superheated steam
to locomotives is fast growing in favor
in this country, and promises to be one
of the most important developments in
present-day locomotive practise

CHAPTER XXIII
How the High Priest Died

fHE came over to me, took me in
her arms, and kissed my lips

“ Save Uncle Dick,” 1 whis-
pered “ You may escape in

•“ There is no way,” she said
“ Be a brave boy, Roland, and
go back to the United States and tell your
story Perhaps some one will listen to
you, and you can have these people pun-
ished You must live, for you have your
whole life before you”

  “ And what will my life be, when I
know it was gained at the cost of my
uncle’s life  ” I asked

  “ You must be brave,” she said again
“ Show that you are a little man”

  Then she kissed me again, looked long
at Uncle Dick, took the captain’s hand,
then turned and walked back toward the
guard and away from the altar

  As she left us we heard chanting, and
turned to find that the doomed priests
were entering the clearing under guard
They came forward quickly, and stopped
just outside the circle of shells

  “What is the meaning of this” the
high priest demanded

  “It means,” said Welch, “that the
people will not stand by and see the great
aitu desecrated again It means you
lacked the courage to attend to the duties
of your office”

  “ 1 acted in wisdom and fairness,” the
high priest said “ I call upon you now
to stand aside, and allow me to address
the people”

 “ The people do not care to hear you”
 “ The law says a condemned man may
 have his say,” the high priest said in a
 loud voice “ Dare you deny me the
 rights of the aitu’s law ”

   In the face of the announcement, Welch
 could not refuse The high priest walked
 within the circle of shells, and spoke

   “ When you entered the aitu’s temple
last night, and desecrated it by your mad-
ness, 1 and my priests were at council

   “ You took me and my brethren from
the temple, and called us condemned We
were not condemned before the sacred
aitu, and therefore an execution on this
sacred altar will be a profanation We
have served you long and faithfully, and
this is the way you forget Shame, my
 children! Where is your reasoning”

   “ Enough! ” Welch cried, afraid the
sentiment of the mob would change

    “ 1 will go on,” the high priest declared
 “ I am here to save the aitu from further
 profanation My people, in searching the
 law, we found that in a case such as this
 there is a way the aitu may be purified

   “ The law says that at any time there is
 the slightest doubt of the aitu's sanctity,
 it may be made pure by the execution of
 a priest upon the sacred altar The law
 further states that all the brethren, as-
 sembled in council, may select by silent
 lot the priest so to die If it is your wish
 that the aitu be preserved sacred, we will
 return to the temple and go through the
 ceremony in the presence of the aitu

   “ After the execution of the priest these
 prisoners may be rightfully condemned
 and executed without incurring the aitu’s
 displeasure, and our temple will be sacred
 again and our land safe from distress”

  “ No, no—it is not the law! ” Welch
cried

   “ It is the law,” the high priest said

  It is peculiar how the sentiment of a
mob will change in the twinkling of an
eye Here was their high priest, a man
they had respected for years, standing
clothed in the dignity of his office, speak-
ing with the voice of wisdom The re-
action was at hand

  “ Let us preserve the sanctity of the
aitu ! ” they cried “ To the temple ! To
the temple ! Let the priests ballot! What
differs it These men must die! ”

  In vain, Welch tried to stpp them He
knew how the balloting would result
They surged forward to kiss the garments
of the priests The procession was formed
again, and we made our way back along
the forest path, up the broad avenue, and
to the temple We were taken to the room
of worship and placed under guard

   Then, in the silence of death, the high
priest prepared the ballots One by one
the priests stepped forward and selected
one, and marked it Welch did not dare
speak, for the law said a word meant
death during the ceremony

  When all the ballots were marked, the
high priest placed them on a golden plate,
and put the plate at the aitu's feet Then
the chantbegan, and candles were burned
In the presence of them all the high priest
counted the ballots and put them back at
the feet of the idol Then he walked
across to Welch

   “ The aitu claims your life, brother,”
he said “ Through your death it will
become purified”

  “It is a trick!” Welch cried to the
people “ They are killing me because I
took your side last night Don’t you see
it is a trick I returned the aitu to you
from a foreign land I have done many
things for you”

   The high priest silenced him

   “ My children,” he said to the people,
“ the brother looks at the matter in the
Wrong light He is not condemned be-
cause of a fault he lias been chosen to
have the greatest honor possible to one jn
the priesthood What greater honor could
there be for any of us, my children, than
to give up our lives that the aitu may be
blessed”

   “ It’s a trick 1 ” Welch cried again

   “ It is an honor 110 true son of the aitu

would refuse, unless he be a coward ! ” the
high priest replied

  “I'll show you I am no coward!”
Welch screamed

  His hand came from beneath his robe,
holding a revolver The weapon spoke,
the smoke drifted to one side, and the
high priest lay upon the floor, blood flow-
ing from a wound in his breast And
Welch, waving the revolver in his hand,
dashed for a side door

  Then bedlam broke loose again The
other priests ran to their fallen chief

  “ He is dead—dead ! ” they moaned

  “The high priest is dead—is dead!”
the people screamed

  They rushed for the door through which
Welch had disappeared Like angry beasts
they went through in pursuit

  “ He killed a man in the presence of
the aitu! ” they screeched “ The aitu is
defiled again until he dies! ”

  In time all of them were gone The
guards had forgotten us in the face of
this great tragedy Only the priests re-
mained, surrounding the body of the one
who had been the head of the temple
And as we watched they lifted the body
and bore it into another rSom

  “ Now is our chance! ” Captain Haw-
son cried

  “ We cannot leave the temple,” said
Rutli “ for they will see us As soon as
they have dealt with Welch they will
remember us”

  “ Then we can hide within the temple,”
the captain said

  He ran toward one of the doors, and
we followed Through a great corridor
we hurried in the darkness and into an-
other room, and from that to another
apartment in another part of the temple

  There was a window in the room, and
we looked out The mob surged about
the square They had taken Welch easily,
and were carrying him down the avenue

  “ Not to the execution ground,” some
of them were crying “iVe cannot slay
him there, for we are not priests”

  “ Then get the priests,” others an-
swered

  While some held Welch under guard,
others ran back toward the temple In
a short time they emerged again, two of
the priests with them And then the
crowd hurried on down the broad avenue,
on the way to the execution-ground

  il It is not safe to remain here,” the
captain said “ They will search the tem-
ple and find us”

  We left the apartment and went tljrough
another dark corridor, making our way
to the first floor of the temple, and emerg-
ing in the worship-room behind the aitu

  Adjoining the main worship-room was
a smaller apartment used by the priests
It had but the one entrance, and only one
window, which was high up in he wall
We hurried into this room

  There were weapons there, and we
seized them gladly and saw that they were
properly loaded Then the captain and
Uncle Dick carried heavy furniture across
the room and piled it against the door
Then we waited for their coming

      CHAPTER XXIV
      How It All Ended

XJALF an hour passed, and we heard
the mob approaching the' temple,
chanting and screeching

  “ It will soon be over now,” the cap-
tain said	-

  I sat in the corner, saying nothing It
was not a pleasant predicament, to say
the least, and the future looked dark
Uncle Dick and Ruth Holland were
standing near me in each other’s arms

  We heard the mob start to enter the
temple, heard the frantic people rush
from room to room below, searching for
us, crying to the priests and demanding
what had become of us

  There was a great crowd outside in the
square, waiting for us to be captured and
taken out Their cries were fearful

  Suddenly, as we listened, we heard the
tone of their cries change from anger to
surprise, heard loud shouts and com-
mands, and the sound of firing

  “ They must be fighting among them-
selves ! ” Uncle Dick said

  “ Pray Heaven such Is the case,” the
captain answered “ That will give us
another respite”

  “ Listen! ” I cried suddenly, so loud
that the men in the temple must have
heard me

  For I had heard something other than
the howling of the mob The others
heard it, too

  It was the shrill note of a bugle

  “ The cruiser is here! ” the captain
cried

  “Thank Heaven!” Ruth exclaimed

  Then the firing in the square became
a regular battle The bugles rang out
loud and clear, and mingled with the
howls of rage and fear from the fanatics
were the cheering cries of the marines
and bluejackets as they fought their way
toward the temple

  “Here, Roland!” the captain cried
from beneath the window

  He helped me to his shoulders,- and I
stood up and peerecLout into the square
In regular formation the men from the
cruiser were advancing on the temple,
driving the fanatics before them The
air was filled with smoke which half ob-
scured the scene of battle The fanatics
were not cowards—they fought bravely
enough—but no body of untrained men
no matter how large, could stand up
before the splendid discipline of Uncle
Sam’s navy

  Foot by foot the fanatics gave way
then they broke and fled from side to side,
throwing away their weapons, screeching
at the top of their voices as they rushed
for safety to the jungle And the men
from the cruiser rushed for the temple
doors

  “If they are only in time!” Uncle
Dick said “ These men will kill us now,
as soon as we are found”

  I got down from the captain’s shoul-
ders, and we crossed the room to the
door The crowd was in the main wor-
ship-room now, looking into all the rooms
that opened into it The din was deaf-
ening We could not understand what
was said

  Then the assault upon our door came
We placed Ruth in a corner, and the
three of us stood in a line, each with a
weapon handy, ready to sell our lives as
dearly as possible and reach the sailors
alive if we could

  The battering at the door continued
The cries grew louder The battle raged
suddenly in the temple-room, for the sail-
ors and marines had reached there

  “ I wish we were out there,” Uncle
Dick cried

  “It is safer in here at present,” the
captain said

  Volleys of shots sounded in the temple-
room We could hear the sailors cheer-
THE DAUGHTER OF THE IDOL

529

ing could hear the fanatics giving their
peculiar battle-cry

  Which side was conquering, we did not
know The fanatics could not stand be-
fore the marines in the open but in the
temple, in the presence of the great aitu,
it might be a different thing

  Again the cries of the fanatics changed
in tone, and now became cries of fear
There were cries of fear in English, too

  “What can it be” Ruth cried

  The captain had gone nearer the door,
and was trying to hear

  “They are crying ‘Fire!’” he said
“ Some one must have set fire to the tem-
ple It will burn like tinder! ”

  Outside in the large room there seemed
to be a stampede But the battering at
the door continued, and in time it was
forced open a little

  “ Stand ready! ” the captain cried
“ Give it to them! We must fight our
way through! Don’t forget Miss Hol-
land when the time comes! ”

  The battle in the temple-room still
raged Now we could hear the crackling
of the flames The door was forced open
a foot, and the thick, black smoke poured
in upon us

  “To the floor!” the captain cried
“ Crawl toward the door ! ”

  We threw ourselves on the floor The
smoke filled the room, and poured
through the one window into the open
air We could see flames in the temple-
room, could see the figures of men dash-
ing through the smoke They were com-
ing nearer

  “ This way ! Get Them out! ” some
one cried in English

  He was answered by screams from the
fanatics Half a dozen men showed in
the smoke just outside the door In a
moment they were sprawling over the
furniture we had piled there

  In another moment the furniture had
been hurled to one side, and some one
sprang in upon us I raised my revolver
Captain Hawson threw my arm upward
as I fired, and the bullet went wild

  “ It is one of Uncle Sam’s men! ” he
cried

  “ Where are you” came the cry

  “ Here! ”

  “Out, all of you! Be quick! The
roof will fall in a few minutes! ”

  We sprang to our feet, and, with Ruth

    10	R R

in the midst of us, staggered to the door
The smoke was not so thick that the ma-
rines could not cheer when they saw us
And then we began our battle to reach
the temple entrance

  There were fanatics still in the room,
firing wildly at the sailors and at each
other in the smoke Before we realized
it, we were hemmed in by marines, and a
midshipman was issuing orders in a loud
voice We made our way slowly across
the room

  I felt my head swimming, felt my
lungs growing sore The flames were all
about us Once I turned to find that
Captain Hawson and Uncle Dick were
carrying Ruth between them

  “ On — on ! ” the midshipman was
shouting “ We are almost there! ”

  Another moment, and we had reached
the entrance We staggered down the
steps into the midst of the sailors and
marines who had remained in the open
As we reached the monument in the
center of the square, there was a great
crash behind us, a cloud of smoke and
flame shot into the air, and the roof and
walls of the temple fell, burying the
great aitu in its sepulcher of ruins

  The fanatics who remained unscathed
fled in terror into the jungle

  It was the work of only a few minutes
to bring Ruth back to consciousness and
then we received the captain of the
cruiser, who had come ashore when the
heavy firing began Captain Hawson
told his story as quickly as possible

  “ 1 have sent men to see about this
man Welch,” said the commander

  As he spoke, 'his men returned, and a
midshipman stepped forward to make his
report Then his superior turned to us
again

  “ Welch has found a grave in the land
he tried to despoil,” he said

  Then we marched down the broad ave-
nue to the shore The cruiser lay at an-
chor a short distance out, white and buff
shining brightly in the sunshine Old
Glory was fluttering in the breeze at the
stern

  Half an hour later we were on the
deck of the cruiser

  “What shall I do about your ship”
Captain Hawson was asked

  He faced  the cruiser’s commander
bravely
530

THE RAILROAD MAN’S MAGAZINE

  “Send a shell into her!” he said
“ If I returned to another port, I would
have explanations to make And from
this time on I lead an honest life, and I
cannot do it on a dishonest ship”

  The two captains clasped hands

  “ It shall be as you wish,” said the
cruiser’s commander

  We stood on the bridge while one of
the great guns forward barked, and
watched as the shell struck There was
a roar, a crash, and the Faraway sank

  Then the cruiser sailed from the tiny
harbor and started back across the Pa-
cific The commander had promised to
land us at Honolulu

  “ When I make my report,” he said,
“ I shall treat Captain Hawson with
charity, inasmuch as both Mr Engle and
Miss Holland do not wish to prosecute
him for his part in their abduction He
has won their regard by 'his bravery
But this boy, Roland Burke, must have
a grievance against the captain, too Of
cdurse, if Mr Burke wants him prose-
cuted—”

  I felt my chest expand when he called
me mister, and Ruth’s silvery laugh rang
out For answer, I stepped forward and
took Captain Hawson by the hand

   “ I guess that settles it,” said the com-
mander

  It was evening, and I was standing on
the bridge, when Ruth and Uncle Dick
came to me, hand in hand

  “ We are going to be married, Ro-
land,” Ruth said “ We wanted to tell
you first of all”

  “ I had almost guessed it,” I replied,
with wisdom beyond my years “ But
there is one thing I’d like to know What
was it that made Uncle Dick dislike you
so when first he met you  ”

  Her face clouded for a moment, but
when Uncle Dick put his arms around
her the smiles came to her lips again

  “ He thought,” she replied, “ that I
was in league with Welch”

  “ I do not understand,” I said

  “ He thought—or rather was made to
believe — that I had conspired with
Welch to steal the aitu, and that it was
taken aboard the cruiser instead of the
yacht by mistake Your uncle respects
all religions, and has no love for one
who would despoil a temple

(The

  “ Then he was made to believe that
I was really going to marry Welch, that
I had been playing with his heart We
met in California, at a resort, a few days
before I was abducted

  “ That was when I left you alone in
San Francisco for two days, Roland,” my
uncle explained

  “ We had a quarrel there,” she went
on “ Your uncle wanted me to marry
him, and I refused, because I knew the
fanatics would seek us and try to carry
us back to death He thought I refused
because of Welch He went away angry
I was angry, too

  “ When lie saw me aboard the Fara-
way he thought I had told the fanatics
where to find him  that I had betrayed
him to his death  that I was seeking re-
venge and trying to help Welch at the
same time But it is all clear now”

   “ I think you were both very foolish,”
I exclaimed “ I thought all the time it
was something really important”

  “ Roland! Roland! ” cried Ruth,
laughing in spite of herself “ It was
important—very important—to your un-
cle and to me”

  Uncle Dick kissed her fondly The
executive officer of the cruiser, who was
on the bridge, looked the other way

  “ On the bridge! ” hailed Captain
Hawson from below

   “Well, sir” asked the executive offi-
cer

  “ Kindly tell that pair of lovers up
there that they both need rest, and that
their cabins are prepared for them
There’ll be plenty of time for spooning
after they reach Honolulu”

   “ Aye, aye, sir! ” laughed the executive
officer

  “ And tell that boy, Roland, to come
down here to me immediately I want
to talk to him He’s got fighting-blood
in his veins ! ”

  Then we all laughed, and I went down
and up to where the captain was sitting
There we sat and talked until my eyes
would stay open no longer Captain Haw-
son put one of his strong arms around
me I felt myself lifted tenderly and
carried toward the cabin

  “ It’s been a terrible experience,” I
heard him mutter “ But it has made a
man of him”

then, and the company operatin’ the same
was broke a’most The line was earnin’
good money all right, but it was too heavy
in debt

The Only Engine

  “ They only had one engine, with no
name or number, ter do the freight and
passenger bus’ness of the whole nineteen
miles of road I was fir in’ then, and our
run was from the east end of the road at
Cinnatus to the west end here Nineteen
miles and two round trips every day

   “ The company had put up a big water -
tank at Cinnatus, and then found out they
was too poor ter buy power enough ter
pump her full of water They fin’ly fixed
it with the milk-station people next to it
to fill the tank from their wells by their
big pumps

   “ Our leavin’ time fer the first trip out
of Cinnatus was 802 am About seven-
forty-five, one June morning, Jim Daley,
my engineer, backed the nameless power-
plant to the tank, and I filled the tender
to the brim

  “ Everything was workin’ right that
mornin’, until we got ter pullin' up the
grade at Whytes Mills, when I discovered
the steam was failin’ off My fire was
burnin’ great, but I couldn’t 110 ways seem
ter make that steam-indicator show right

  “ I turned on the blower, and there
wasn’t hardly enough power left ter blow
the fire

  “ Well, we struggled along until we
got ’bout to East Freeville, when I heard
Jim yell and seen him jam on the air, and
then jump

  “ We weren’t runnin’ fast enough ter
do any particular damage by leavin’ the
track, and we sure did jump regular those
clays with that poor-ballasted road I
stepped to the side of the engine and
looked fer Jim, but all I seen was his back,
and that was fast fadin’ inter the per-
spective

  “ I stood there wonderin’ what had
hit Jim, when Al Kemp, our conductor,

comes runnin’ up and wants ter know
what’s wrong Says I: ‘ Jim’s gone crazy
Jumped and run! There ain’t nothin’
the matter, only we can’t seem ter keep
up steam enough ter git anywheres’

   “ I hadn’t no more’n got the words out
of my mouth afore I heard : ‘ Jump, Bill—
jump ! She’s goin’ to blow up ! ’

   “ Then, fer the first time, I seemed to
hear a sizzlin’ an’ foamin’ goin’ on inside
that engine which didn’t sound right, and
there was a white fluid just boilin’ out all
over her It didn’t take me long ter go
after Jim, then, you bet, and the whole
crew followed suit We got over behind a
hill and waited fer the explosion, but
there was nothin’ doin’

  “ After about an hour we screwed up
gumption enough to go back Ev’ry-
thing was quiet, and no-trouble seemed
to exist about the engine ’cept she was
coated over with some white stuff, and
the sizzlin’ had expired

Just a Mistake

  “ We sat round fer a spell tryin’ ter
make out the cause, but nobody seemed
ter have any explanation Fin’ly, Jim
got up on the tender and lifted the tank
cover He stood lookin’ in a minute, and
then motions me up I took one look
and shut the cover down, remarkin’ ter
Jim: ‘It won’t do nobody no good ter
say anything about that’

   “ It wasn’t until after the engine had
been ter the shops that any of the crew
learned what the real trouble was, but
they did joke us some after that about
her stomach being full of Dutch cheese’
Bill sat back and puffed a while in si-
lence I gazed at him, wondering how
the cheese got into the boiler He, evi-
dently reading my thought, continued:

  “ Yep, ’twas Dutch cheese, and one on
me You see, the milk-station people had
pumped our water-tank full of sour milk
by mistake, and I had filled the tender
without noticing the mistake”

DE BERGERAC OF THE BOES

BY AUGUSTUS WITTFELD,

     He and Monk Hastily Desert Their Auto When They
     Get a Jack Binns from Geraldine and Her Mollycoddle

TE, having nothing else
on hand, engineered an-
other meeting between
Monk and the individual
with the watery eyes! Aft-,
er an interchange of cour-
tesies, the individual with the watery
weeps inquired: “ Have you had any
more of those remarkable adventures since
I saw you last ”

  “ Have I  ” queried Monk “ Why,
I’ve had the time of my life I’ve been
hobnobbing with the Harriman of the
highways Doing stunts in an automo-
bile with the only and original auto hobo
of America”

  “ If you can relieve yourself without
crossing the Rubicon of truth, I believe I
can pose as a willing listener without re-,
sorting to anesthetics,” commented the
watery-eyed one	✓

  “ The last time we met,” retorted
Monk, “ you cast aspersions on my verac-
ity by inquiring whether Ananias did not
grace the upper branches of my genealogy
ical tree”

  “ I did,” replied the watery-eyed one
“ but with all due respect to Annernias”
“ In that case,” replied Monk, “ I will
overlook your seeming irrelevancy, and
give you a leaf from the log of my ad-
ventures with this motor marauder One
afternoon I was doing the at-home stunt
’neath the shade of the old apple-tree,
when a stranger hove in sight, wiped his
feet on the ‘ Welcome ’ mat, and proceed-
ed to ingratiate himself I entertained
him with a recital of one of my adven-:
tures, after which he announced his de-
sire for sleep”

  “ Very natural,” interrupted the weepy
one

  Ignoring the remark, Monk continued:

                         

“ He requested me to awaken him should
an auto bearing his crest put in appear-
ance, and was soon pounding his auricular
appendage on the herbaceous hummock,
while I listened to the sighing of the
wind in the branches and mused on the
mutability 'of things in general Lazily
I watched the passing autos, and envied
the favored sons of the ennui class who
are handicapped by the burden of wealth
and the responsibilities of rank There’s
nobody to flash a red at them and chase
them along a siding until the perishable
produce goes by

  “ There’s nobody to worry them except
the bucolic burgomaster who penalizes
them seven-fifty for flirting with the un-
dertaker on the only decent mile of- road
within the burg

  “As I lolled and dreamed, a machine
came along, traveling slowly As it drew
near I noted that it contained but a single
occupant, evidently the chauffeur, who
appeared to be on the lookout for some
one I arose and sauntered leisurely for-
ward

  “ The only occupant asked me whether
I had seen an individual meandering
around who looked like an imitation of
Richard Mansfield

  “ I asked him for specifications as to
the character in the great actor’s repertory
the meandering Mansfield assumed He
replied that he was not long on histrionic
characterization, but he thought it was
Markham’s 1 The Man With the Nose’

  “ I associated his meager description
with the personality of my guest, and
informed the proud pleasure = pilot that
the great Cyrano was doing the by-by act
’neath the pippin-tree He asked me to
awaken the Rostrand replica and inform
him that his auto had arrived
534

THE RAILROAD MAN’S MAGAZINE

   “ ‘ Say, sport,’ I answered, ‘ desist your
dippy discourse Whoever heard of a
weary wayfarer along Handout Highway
possessing an automobile ’

  “ The chipper chauffeur did not deign
to reply, but strode over to the slumberer
and shook him De Bergerac awoke and
cast his optics over the moving-picture
show Then he indulged in a conversa-
zione with the haughty-autoist, who final-
ly handed him some bills and took his de-
parture

  “ I watched him hoofing it down the
pike, and wondered what I was up against
Then I approached the guest of honor,
and, by judicious questioning, I elicited
the information that the auto belonged to
him

  “ Say, pard, I’ve heard of pan-han-
dlers pushing toward the Stygian dark-
ness on proud plugs, but that was the first
time I’d been up against the auto-hobo
combination Just imagine an intelligent
itinerant mastering the mysteries of me-
chanics or getting up energy sufficient to
turn the hurdy-gurdy crank of an auto
so as to get a tune out of the engine

  “ I expressed my doubts as to his abil-
ity to run the auto, but he assured me that
he was an expert Said he was a meander-
ing mechanic—an MD of the autopathic
school—and made real money doctoring
the afflicted autos of the rich Then he
asked me to take a ride, and when I put
up the bluff that, like the ballet-dancer,
I’d nothing to wear, he dug down into
the hamper and produced a couple of auto
rigs, which we put on Then he started
the engine, and we climbed in Say, sport,
did you ever take your affinity to one of-
those gladsome groves where every one
indulges in the abandon of amusement ”
questioned Monk

  “ Do I look like one who would lure
a lady to a luny park” resented the
watery-eyed one

  “ Well, there’s no use negotiating the
altitudes,” retorted Monk “ I meant
nothing impersonal If you’ve never been
to any of the hilarious haunts, you do not
know the fascination of shooting the
chutes or gliding over the undulating sur-
face of the scenic railway like a streak
of greased cosmoline If you’ve never
leaped along the level ways, or climbed
the incline like a ricket—if you’ve never
shot down the declivities like an Alpine

 avalanche bent on a mission of oblitera-
 tion—you cannot appreciate the sensation
 I experienced on my first automobile ride

-— “ I abandoned myself to the novelty of
 the situation, and thought of the many
 times I had traveled in a more primitive
 way Brake-beams and empty freights
 are all right, but the auto is the aristocrat
 of conveyances

   “ De Bergerac certainly knew how to
 handle that car, and he kept her going
 until near dusk We put up for the night
 at a farmhouse, where it happened that
 the host was an enthusiastic autoist, and
 De Bergerac so won him over by letting
 him talk about his machine that he forgot
 to make any charge for our entertain-
 ment

    “ We made an early start, after an ap-
 petizing breakfast, and De Bergerac said
 we would take a run up to Lake Nocopo,
 a swell summer resort I saw more scen-
 ery on that trip than you could see in a
 week traveling in the old-fashioned way
 We finally reached the lake, and had our
 first view of the classy resort from the
 lower end Around the hotel, which we
 could barely discern in the distance, there
 did not seem to be much evidence of life,
 the guests evidently being at breakfast

   “ De Bergerac brought his machine to
 a stop, that we might enjoy the witchery
 of the scene Coming across the water
 toward us was a canoe, containing a
 young man and a young woman The
 feminine end of the combination was fur-
 nishing the motive power, while the Chol-
 ly-boy seemed to be content with looking
 picturesque and puny

   “ On they came, gliding over the wa-
 ter, when suddenly that mollycoddle mas-
 culine made a fool move and upset the
 birch bateau The girl came up first,
 and, grabbing the struggling shrimp by
 the back of the neck, she swam with him
 to the overturned craft

   “ The physical-culture girl seemed to
 be handicapped by the swimleSS swain,
 and made no effort to right the canoe

   “ De Bergerac, realizing her predica-
 ment, remarked that it was evidently up
 to us to do the heroic-rescue act

   “ ‘'How do you propose to capture the
 Carnegie compensation  ’ I inquired

   “ De Bergerac thought for a moment,
 then he jumped from the car and got busy
 detaching the tire from one of the wheels
DE BERGERAC

OF THE BOES

   “ ' Say,' I protested, ‘ those capsized ca-
noists are doing a Jack Binns Don’t
you think you’d better let your repairs
wait until we have rescued them’

   “ ‘ That’s all right,’ he answered, as he'
sprung the tire from the wheel 1 Here,
get busy and pump this up tight’

  “ I got onto the job, wondering wheth-
er the harrowing scene had affected his
mentality As 1 finished, he sprung an-
other tire from its wheel and proceeded
to inflate it thoroughly Then he picked
up the tire and made for the lake, bid-
ding me to do likewise When he reached
the water, he jumped in, and I realized
then that we were rushing to the rescue
with improvised life-preservers

  “ I followed De Bergerac into the chil-
ly water I’m no woolly water-spaniel,
and I don’t fancy scorching over the
water on a personally conducted auto-
mobile tire After about ten minutes’
hard work, we reached the distressed
damsel and her companion, and De Ber=
gerac instructed them as to the method
of putting a life-preserver on straight

  “ When the p'ocket-edition of mascu-
linity had gotten himself comfortably en-
sconced in his life-preserver, he fumbled
in his coat-pocket and pulled out his card-
case With difficulty he opened it and
took out a damp card He handed it to
De Bergerac, saying:

  “ ‘ I feel that the conventionalities
should be observed before we proceed fur-
ther Permit me to introduce myself’

  “ De Bergerac glanced at the card, and
said:

  “ 1 Mr de Trop, I am pleased to meet
you Unfortunately, I have left my card-
case in my auto I am known as C
de Bergerac This is M Hausen’

  “The drawing-room hero acknowledged
the introduction with a porpoiselike bow,
muttering, ‘ Chawmed’

  “ ‘ Miss Geraldine,’ he said, turning to
the girl, ‘ allow me to present Messieurs
de Bergerac and Hausen Gentlemen,
Miss Geraldine Pendelton’

  “ Say, sport,” commented Monk, “ I’ve
been up against social etiquette in all
quarters of the earth, but blow me if that
wasn’t the first time I’d participated in a
deep-sea drawing-room function

  “ After the formalities had been ob-
served, De Bergerac approached the fair
maiden and said:

  “ ‘ Miss Pendelton, may I have the
honor of saving your life ’

  “ Fair Geraldine smiled her assent, and
De Bergerac righted the canoe Then,
while I steadied it, he assisted her to re-
embark Then he climbed in, and asked
me to pass him the paddle, which was
floating a short distance away I secured
it for him, and he directed me to lash the
two life-preservers together I did so,
and he made them fast to the canoe

  “ ‘ I say, De Bergerac,’ remarked the
De Trop party, ‘going to leave me here’
“ ‘ As there does not seem to be any
chloroform in the purser’s cabin,’ replied
De Bergerac, ‘ I think we had better pro-
ceed as we are’

  “ De Trop attempted to remonstrate,
but De Bergerac swung the paddle, and
we started on our triumphal journey to
safety The girl looked happy but humid,
De Bergerac looked heroic and hopeful,
while your humble servant and the too-
much individual looked like a couple of
inanimate automatons stuck in crullers

  “ We proceeded shoreward, guided by
the skilful strokes of the versatile volun-
teer, and eventually landed De Berge-
rac quickly replaced the tires, and, bun-
dling the rescued resorters into the auto,
drove swiftly to the hotel

  “ When the guests heard of the heroic
rescue, they lionized that Carnegie hero”
“ I suppose,” ventured the individual
with the watery eyes, “ that your friend
with the histrionic handle married the
water-nymph and lived happy ever aft-
erward ”

  “ No,” replied Monk, “ fiction may
flourish, but truth will prevail As a
chronicler of facts, I have no other re-j
course than to announce the union of the
house of Pendelton with that of De Trop,
though what she could see in that scion
of immobility surpasses understanding

  “ What became of the chauffeur with
the courtly name” asked the individual
with the lacrimose lamps

 “ The auto hobo is no more,” replied
Monk “ He has forsaken the open road
for the closed shop of servility He is now
chauffeur - in - chief to the house of De
Trop I was offered the position of but-
ler in the same institution, but as I know
nothing about butling, I declined If you
can spare me a match, I’ll light up and
say good-by Merci bocoo”
THE MAN FOR ME

 BY LESLIE CURTIS

  Written for “The Railroad Man’s Magazine

I

I’ve traveled all over this blessed land—know every burg on the map

And you can take it from me, straightdope, it isn’t much of a snap

It’s the lonesomest life in all the world, forever and ever to roam,
Especially so for a girl like me, who’s crazy to have a home

Say, that’s phony dope about millionaires hanging around the stage

Those guys ain’t lookin’ for song-birds to put in a legal cage

They want the girl with the champagne taste—the one who can kick so
     high—

But the decent girl with the shabby dress! Why, she gets the icy eye!

That’s a great old joke about virtue being its own reward—

And whenever a well-meaning dub says that, I laugh and swallow hard
Sounds funny when I’ve starved and froze, because I was on the square—
So me for a large-sized, healthy hunch that the world ain’t playing fair

MAY be only a chorus girl, but I know a thing or two

If you’ve got a moment to while away I’ll put you wise to a few
Seems strange for me to be resting here, with never a thought of
care

         When I ought to be with “ The Moonlight Maids,” swingin’ my
             feet in the air!

536
                One morning out in Lonesome Tank, while waiting for a train

                We were tired and cold and hungry, drenched with a driving rain

               When it came at last—two hours late—and I ran out to see—

                A kindly face in the engine-cab looked down and smiled at me

                 The cars were full, but I found a seat and managed to sleep a while

                And into my dream came the kindly face and the sympathetic smile

               Then all at once a crash—a pain—and scream that followed scream!

               I tried to wake—I couldn’t move—I thought I was in a dream!

                 At length I came from that awful sleep in the arms of the engineer

                He’d pulled me out of the wreck, they said, and then he sent me here

                He never asked any questions but one day, as he stroked my hand—

                 I told him the whole of my miserable life, for I knew he’d understand

                 Say, you can have all the millionaires, but I’ll take Bill Jerome

                 For, while I’m lying dreaming here, he’s fixing up a home

                 It’s never again to pike around, to starve and fear the cold—

                 For under his greasy working clothes there beats a heart of gold

                  It’snix on the guy that owns the road, or the son of a millionaire

                 They hand out bottles of Hell’s First Aid and bunches of stale hot air
                 But the man who is used to the world’s hard knocks is the one to bless a home
                 And when I get well, it’s a lead-pipe cinch, I’ll bet on Bill Jerome!
 The Evolution of “Almost”

A Trestle Over a Crack in Arizona Catches Fire, and “ Almost” Proves
That He is Made of Real Hero Stuff When
He Rescues Jimmy Bailey

              y

every engineer and scoop-pusher in helper
service began to take notice of him and
help him along

   Of course, some of them took liberties
at times, especially “ Smoke ” Kelley
“ Smoke ” liked to have his little fun
every semioccasionally and Almost put
in quite a bunch of time hunting left-
handed bell-ropes, and on one occasion
put in half a day polishing the bell to
improve its tone

  But when “ Smoke ” liked you he
showed it by every sort of a practical
joke, and as lie Was always showing the
boy little things about the engine he
added his share to the general educa-
tional donation

There were times when Almost ap-

          AVING nothing much to do
but wait for pay-day and
maintain the dignity neces-
sary to a “ general fore-
man ” at Hulbrook, I
found quite a chunk of
time in which I could drop grains of wis-
dom in Almost’s vicinity It was a reve-
lation how near human he was

  In less than a week after I made him
chief clerk he could dump a grate and
pull a fire as artistically as any tallow-
pot on the pike He even knew the in-
jector from the air - valve, and got over
looking at the steam-gage to see what
time it was	1

  In another month he kneW every part
on that engine by its first name, and

peared hopeless He insisted on letting
an empty coal-car down from the coal-
chute, and as a result -he built a little
church out of a flat car which was stand-
ing in on the coal-chute track about fifty
yards away

  Almost didn’t stop at the same time the
gondola did He knocked two boards
off the sand fence which stood a good
twenty feet from the siding Outside of
that he was all right, and insisted that
he “ almost had it stopped when it hit”

  There was one great thing about Al-
most, when he started something he al-
ways hung around for the finish Of
course, it was up to the general foreman
and the chief clerk to make the needed
repairs on the gondola and the flat, so
Almost had a chance to take a lesson
or so in box-car physiology

  Knowing, as I did, that digging clink-
ers from a grate, polishing wheels, and
banking fires, with putting in a brass
now and then as an extra amusement,
wasn’t exactly conducive to intellectual
progress, I was rather surprised that Al-
most began to show signs of “ book
l’arnin’”

Caught with the Goods

  He was mighty careful to hide the
traces, but I caught him with the goods
one day, under the engine in the pit,
with the time-table spread out on his oily
knees, and he was spelling out the names
of the stations along the pike He had
the letters down fairly well, but what he
called some of those towns would have
made them pretty sore if they had heard
it

  It wasn’t more than a month after
that that Almost came into the box-car
office one afternoon about four o’clock
and handed me the list of cars, initials,
car numbers and all, the regular report I
had to send into the terminal office every
night I looked it over and you could
really read the thing

  Of course, 1 didn’t want to embarrass
the boy, so I just thanked him as if he
was in the habit of doing it every day
From that day on he did, which left me
nothing to do but let my salary accu-
mulate, and look out for Almost

  Finally Maggie Mahorney informed me
that Almost was taking a daily newspaper
from Albuquerque She said it in such

 a way that I knew without guessing twice
 where Almost was attending night school

Less Title More Money

   Of course, it was bound to come I
 couldn’t stand die climate very long Aft-
 er six months as general foreman I de-
 cided that I would take less title and
 more money

   About the only thing to break the si-
 lence at Hulbrook was the sound of Jed
 Latroupe’s wooden leg pecking along the
 ties as he came to the station every
 morning to spring an old joke of his about
 it 1 bein’ awferl dry this year,’ and the
 rumble of the trains as they passed by
 I wasn’t cut out for the simple life any-
 how, not for long at one time

   I wanted to get over into the train
 service, as I had had a little taste of that
 in years past and liked it prejty well,
 better than feeding coal to a double-
 doored hog, or pulling a throttle at the
 head of a long string of empties or full
 tonnage of loads

   It looked as if the T M would never
 stop off at Hulbrook, and when he did
 come the little entertainment kept us

“he had jimmy bailey’s body,

so busy that I forgot about hitting him
for a job

  It was along in the afternoon, when
every one in Hulbrook took their “ shut-
eye” Ail extra stock - train pulled up
at the station for orders against the pas-
senger - train and J K—we all called
the trainmaster J K when we didn’t
call him something else—dropped off the
caboose and wandered up to the station

An Air of Industry

  Jed Latroupe was whittling 011 his
wooden leg, and I saw the old man com-
ing, so I got busy making out a bogus re-
port An air of industry around a station
carries a lot of weight with an official

  The stock-train pulled out, and J K
remained to take up a few little matters
of business, including an investigation of
the accident at the coal-chute when Al-
most went coasting in the empty gondola
I told J K just how it was, and he told
Almost just how it was, and assessed
fifteen brownies against his personal
record As fifteen brownies didn’t de-
crease his pay a bit, Almost stood for
it, and went back to his stall in Jed
Latroupe’s livery - stable to change his
clothes—for Almost had two suits now,
one suit of overalls, and another of hand-
me-downs from Albuquerque, which he
insisted on wearing every Sunday whether
we had company or not

The Cry of “ Fire! ”

  About fifteen minutes later, Almost
came rushing into the box car puffing like
an engine on a heavy grade

  “ Somethin’s on fire over yonder,” he
exclaimed

  And of course, realizing that a fire in
a place where water don’t grow is a
mighty serious thing, J K and I did a
handicap free-for-all for the door It was
a dead heat and we jammed

  When we finally got out on the plat-
form, a couple of miles down the track
and around a curve, we could see a big
bank of grayish smoke rolling up It
looked as if it might be the bridge over
the Little Colorado, but Almost ’lowed
as how the only thing on the bridge that
could burn was the ties, and that there
was too much smoke for that

  J K suggested that we advise the ter-
minal office, and Almost again ’lowed as
how about the only thing down that way
what would burn was that stock-train
which had pulled out about twenty min-
utes before

  “ Then we’ll order the wrecker from
Winslow,” remarked the trainmaster and
began to write out a message using -the
side of the box-car station as a desk

  But Almost had not been watching the
red ball freight and the varnished wag-
ons roll by, day after day, longing to be
out 011 top of the string swinging a high
ball, or wishing that he was the man on
the rear platform with the blue uniform
and the brass buttons, to let such an
opportunity as this pass by without ma-
king an effort to land

Getting in Line

  He couples into the trainmaster with
the suggestion that the wrecker would be
a long time getting over from Winslow,
and there was a pusher engine down on
the pit track, an old derrick on the spur,
and two full water-cars near the coal-
chute It would only be a matter of
switching them out and hitting the grit,
to get over there

  If the fire was nothing to mention, then
there was 110 harm done If it was a
wreck, and a string burning up, then,
after all, haste was the first demand

  J K fell for it Almost put himself
in motion toward Jed Latroupe’s livery-
barn, where the helper crew had just
turned in for a little shut-eye

  I11 five minutes they were down on the
engine, which still had a fair head of
steam, and then with me in the role of
engine boss, with J K and Almost work-
ing the field, we switched out the cars
we wanted Then we went it wild for
the cloud of smoke, leaving word with
the station-agent to hold the board on
everything until we' got back

At the Scene

  “ Smoke ” Kelley had the throttle on
that old teapot, and according to Al-
most “ he shore did crack the whip with
them four cars”

  The closer we got to the smoke the
surer we were that it wasn’t a barbecue
THE EVOLUTION OF “ALMOST”

541

or an Old Settlers’ picnic, and when we
came around the Aztec curve, “ Smoke ”
threw the big hole into them and even
then we only stopped a few inches
back of the dog-house

  Of course, the first move we
made was to see how many of the
crew was in sight “ Humpy ”
Jamison, with one side of his face
hanging in ribbons, came running
back toward us, as we hastened
ahead It wasn’t the Lit-
tle Colorado bridge that
had burned out, but it
was a wooden trestle
over one of those cracks
in the ground which you
find all over Arizona

  Some of them you can
jump across, but they
will be as much as fifty
feet deep This one was
about eighteen feet
across and forty deep

  Jamison went the air
route, and landed on his
face on the other side of
the canon His fireman
beat it to the brush be-
fore they went in, and
was all to the good, but
the head shack didn’t
clear the wreckage, and
was pinned under a car

  They had got him free of the wreck-
age and had him lying back 011 the desert
The rear brakeman was all to the good,
except that when Jamison threw the air
into them, the brakeman tried to butt the
front end of the cupola away, and really
did a good job of it too—laying his head
open for a few inches or more

  But they were all alive and kicking
except the captain of the ship, Jimmy
Bailey He was missing The rear
shack said that the last he saw of him
he was coming over the string toward the
dog-house, about midway of the train

  No, I don’t care for any more mutton
Not since that day, and every time I hear
the ba-ba it gives me a spell of chills
Five cars of mutton went into that ditch
with the engine, and they took fire, three
more cars turned over and two others were
derailed, and if a-human being can pro-
duce a more agonizing cry than some of
those sheep did—well, just count me out

OUTSIDE OF THAT, HE WAS ALL RIGHT

  But then that has nothing to do with
the 1178 report Just about as fast as men
ever worked, Kelley drifted into the rear
of the string, coupled onto the caboose,
and we cut the string off behind the cars
that were derailed and pulled all those
that were 011 the track back about a mile

  In the meantime, a terrier digging af-
ter a rat could not have been more busy
than Almost He had grabbed an ax, and
the way he was making holes in those
stock-cars, and the way the sheep were
coming through those holes—well, it was
really good to see, except that the fire kept
coming back toward him and he kept
working closer to the fire

He Was Heat-Proof

I suppose living in Arizona most all
his life made him heat-proof, for I know
I tried to get in and help him a little
and couldn’t stand it If some one sue-
542

THE RAILROAD MAN’S MAGAZINE

ceeds in convincing me that Hades is just
half as hot as that place was, I’m going
to be an awful good boy all my life

  Heroism is all right in its place, but I
never could see the virtue of risking your
one life, er—for sheep, say—so I began to
yell at Almost to climb out of it J K
came running over and helped me cuss
the idiot

  Then Jamison came up, and the rear
shack would have been there too, if we
hadn’t sent him over to see how the other
brakeman was making it out there under
the shade of a cactus Almost didn’t
even look up

  He was chopping away like a man gone
wild I was sure that he had suddenly
lost what little sense he had in fact, I
was ready to admit right there that he had
had none to begin with

  His hat was gone, his brick - colored
hair was singed, you could see the blisters
raising on his face, the fire was leaping
about him, the inhuman screaming of the
sheep penned in the burning cars, wreck-
age and blood every place, and him stand-
ing there like a fool boy on the burning
deck eating peanuts

  Then I started up after him, but it
wasn’t any use Now, I don’t claim to be
the real hero, but no one ever accused me
of having yellow stripes along my spine

Almost Is Busy

  I’ve helped pick them up in baskets
and oft' of boiler-heads I’ve faced the
big works a couple of times myself and
didn’t let out a whimper, but to see Al-
most up there, cutting kindling wood with
an ax, while he was literally burning
alive! Well, I guess there were a couple
of other fellows who said: “Now I lay
me down to sleep,” and wasn’t ashamed
of it either

  He seemed to be cutting a little hole
in between two cars which had telescoped
We finally couldn’t see hihi more than
half the time for the smoke and the fire

  Finally he stepped down into the hole
he had cut I saw him grab a brake-rod
and bend it back out of his way and the
thing was so hot you could see the smoke
from his burned hands when he took hold
of it

  Once down in the hole to his waist,
he shoved aside a board and bent over

a little, and twice more he swung that
ax, dropped it, bent over, and when he
straightened up, his clothes burst into
flame, and — so help me! he had Jim-
my Bailey’s body in his arms

A Fast Ride



  He climbed out of that mess, staggered
from one piece of wreckage to another,
and fell his length in our direction

  Jamison, J K, and myself reached
them in a jump Jamison grabbed Bailey’s
body and dragged it out to the side of the
track, while J K and I beat the fire
which Avas eating the boy’s clothes
Bailey’s left arm told the story

  It had been pinned in the wreckage
so that i't was held fast, and the only way
that Almost could get him free was to
cut it off Those last two blows had done
the work

  Conductor Bailey still has one arm and
a mighty good body, which he says he
owes to Almost, but just how completely
he owes it to Almost no one knows any
better than I do

  I’ve ridden a few fast ones in my time
There was the time Skinny Farris took
me from Torreon to Jimulco, there was
the time Paxton rolled me down the big
divide when we expected the crown-sheet
to drop every minute, but I never rode
quite as fast as “ Smoke ” Kelley pulled
us that evening in the dusk from the
wreck to the terminal and the nearest
surgeon

  That nig-ht Bailey and Almost occu-
pied neighboring cots in the hospital-
ward and it looked for a time as if neither
one of them was going to have much use
for ozone before long Almost came out
of it first

In the Hospital

  The trainmaster was there, so was the
doctor, and they let me hang around,
seeing as how I got hostile when they
tried to put me out Almost came to
his senses, and raised a bandaged arm to
a more bandaged head and asked, “W’here
am I at”

  “ You’re in the hospital, young man,
and you want to keep real quiet for a time
We’ll take those bandages off your eyes
the first thing in the morning”
THE EVOLUTION OF “ALMOST”

543

  Then the details must have come back
to him He let out a sickening groan,
the kind a fellow gives up when he lays
down to die and knows he’s been a big
failure

  “ Oh, yes,” he says, “ I almost got
him”

and Jed once I told it four hundred and
eighty-seven times, but before I started in
011 them I hunted up Maggie Mahorney,
and while we sat in her little 'dobe room
I told her the story, and Almost didn’t
lose anything on account of me being his
John Alden‘either

' ‘ I ALMOST GOT HIM

V

  “ Almost got him ” chuckled J K in
the boy’s ear, or right near where his
ear ought to be “Almost what—you
sure got him, boy He’s here in the hos-
pital with you”

  “ That’ll help a little,” replied Al-
most, and a few minutes later he drifted
off into a troubled sleep

Whittled in Two

  They both got well Of course, the
next day I had to hurry back to Hul-
brook, for tlie general foreman and the
chief clerk couldn’t be away at the same
time, and when I got back there I found
the town all but gone to the bad

  The posj-office had been closed ever
since the news became known Jed La-
troupe had whittled 011 his wooden leg
until he whittled it plumb in two

If I told that story to the station-agent

  Of course, the story got out among the
boys You might hide a candle under a
basket but it won’t cover a burning train
And when they got wise to the real dope,
there was nothing to it but a medal for
Almost

  I wondered what he would do witli a
medal in Hulbrook where there was 110
one to see it, but the boys thought that
was the thing to do, and as they didn’t
consult me they went ahead and did it
They sent to’ Albuquerque and had a sure
enough gold medal, with a blue ribbon
on it and a nice epitaph inscribed

On a Strike

  Maybe it wasn’t an epitaph, but it was
something of that kind In the mean-
time I got hold of the-trainmaster, told
him that every night I thought I heard
sheep howling down at Hulbrook and my
544

nervous system wouldn’t stand the strain,
and suggested that I quit and that he use
his influence to get Almost the job as
general foreman

  He said he would do it I quit and
they sent another man down there to fill
in until Almost grew a new crop of skin

  Well, there was a tangle in the red
tape some place, and before they got
around to making Almost general fore-
man he went out on a strike When he
went back to work as chief clerk and
ex-officio guardian of Uncle Sam’s post-
office, the boys sent a delegation down to
present the gold trimmin’s

  The very next day he came into the
terminal, hunted me up, and I was advised
of the wherefore and why of the strike
at Hulbrook Taking Almost’s own words
it was after this fashion:

  “ Now, Mr Thomas, I don’t mind
cleanin’ ash-pans, and diggin’ out clink-

ers fer your railroad, an’ tryin’ ter earn
them forty-five pesos every month, but
I’ll be durned if I’m-going ter trot around
that town a wealin’ a breastpin like this,”
and he produced the medal

  I talked it over'with Almost, and it
seems as if he really wanted a badge, but
he wanted a stinger’s badge—he wanted
to be a real shack He wanted the priv-
ilege of eating cinders on the smoky end,
chewing sand on the desert, and digging
for switches in four feet of snow

  That’s all the reward he wanted, and
he did want that powerfully bad I sug-
gested that perhaps Maggie Mahorney
would like to have the breastpin, and I
guaranteed to get him the brakeman’s
badge, a switch-key, and a lantern, for I
knew how the trainmaster felt about the
ungainly chief clerk at Hulbrook, and
as this proved almost satisfactory to all
concerned the strike was declared settled

    In the final instalment of the story of “Almost,” next month, Mr Herr tells how he
earned the right to sign orders

BY FORREST G SMITH

It Is Apparently Such Little Things as These That Have Made the
Railroads of the United States and Canada
the Wonders of Industry

EQUAL BRAKE-PRESSURE —

One of the greatest difficulties experienced
in the operation of trains, and particularly
freight-trains is the equalization of the
brake-pressure on the wheels In order to
simultaneously apply the brakes to the
wheels of every car of the train, it is custom-
ary to maintain an air-pressure of about
twenty pounds to the square inch throughout
the entire brake system, and when the brakes
are operated this pressure is exerted equally
against the wheels of empty cars as well as
against the wheels of heavily loaded cars,
which vary greatly in weight, according to
the character of tlie load carried

  This pressure, applied to the wheels of an
unloaded car will stop the wheels entirely,
and cause them to skid on the rails It will
not only wear flat places 011 the wheels, but
will cause the cars of the train to bump
against each other, which is very damaging
to the draft-rigging, as well as to the bodv-
structure of the cars

  To overcome this disadvantage of the ordi-
nary brake-syslems, Frank D Thomason, of
Chicago, has patented No 944058, Decem-
ber 31, 1909, a brake-equalizing mechanism,
which is so constructed that the weight of
cach car of a train will result in the wheels
of its trucks being moved toward their re-
spective brake-shoes a distance or degree
proportionate to the weight of the car

11 RR

  As a result, the wheels of a heavily loaded
car will be nearer their respective brake-
shoes than the wheels of an “ empty,” and as
the pressure exerted by the brake-shoes in-
creases in ratio to the approach of the wheels
to the shoes, greater braking pressure will
be applied to the wheels of the heavily loaded
cars than to the wheels of the “ empties,” se-
curing the above-mentioned result

&

AIR-BRAKE RELEASE-W h e n

the brake mechanism of any car of a train
becomes inoperative, the train is stopped and
one of the trainmen must crawl beneath the
car and cut out the brakes of that particular
car This method results in the loss of
considerable time, to say nothing of the dan-
ger involved

  To obviate this disadvantage, Simon P
Cota, of Dickinson, North Dakota, has pat-
ented, No 943769 December 21, 1909 a re-
lease for air-brake apparatus, which may be
operated from within the car to which it is
applied

  The device is embodied in a valve which
is interposed in a branch pipe leading from
the train-pipe to the brake-cylinder, and the
stem of this valve projects up through the
floor of the car a short distance, so that it
may be opened or closed from within the
car

545

THE RAILROAD MAN’S MAGAZINE

  As the' valve-stern is turned to close the
valve, an exhaust valve for the auxiliary
cylinder is opened at the same time, so as to
relieve this cylinder of pressure

CONTROL FOR STREET

CARS-A novel brake-control system for
 pay-as-you-enter ” cars is shown in a pat-
ent No 945964 January 11 1910 issued to
Frederick H Lincoln, of Philadelphia As
it is customary in this class of cars to keep
the doors closed when the car is in motion,
and only open them to allow passengers to
enter or leave the car this system will pre-
vent numerous accidents which might other-
wise occur

  Motormen 011 such cars have acquired the
habit of first starting their car and then
closing the door, and it not infrequently
happens that just at this moment a person
will attempt to either leave or board the
car, forgetting that 110 foothold is afforded
when the door is closed or partly closed
Conductors 011 such cars, due, we must say,
to the necessity of taking on and discharg-
ing passengers as rapidly as possible, have
become careless in guarding the exit doors
so that persons may leave by these doors
while the car is in motion

  The system of control devised by Mr
Lincoln, while electrical in its nature, is
very simple, and renders it absolutely im-
possible for the motorman to start his car
while any of the doors' are open As there
are exceptions to all rules, however, a switch
is provided which may be thrown, in case
of emergency, to permit of the car being
started while the doors are open

£

EASY SWITCHING- A decidedly

advantageous switch construction is shown
in a patent No 946,391, January 11, 1910,
issued to Archie K Murray, of Johnstown,
Pennsylvania It has been adopted by one
of the largest switch manufacturing com-
panies in this country

  As is well known, right and left hand
switches differ materially in construction, the
parts in one arranged the reverse to the
parts in the other Consequently, two sets
of castings must be made

  T11 the switch disclosed in this patent, how-
ever, this is obviated, and a single casting
of each part is all that is necessary to con-
struct either a right or a left hand switch
Tn this switch construction, the switch-rod
carries a member which may be reversed,
and the spring for normally holding the
switch in one position or the other may be
disposed between this member and one wall

of the casing for the switch, in order to
adapt it to a right or left hand curve, as the
case may be

  It can be disposed between the said mem-
ber and a bracket upon another wall of the
casing to obtain the opposite result

CREEPING RAILS—Devices for

preventing the creeping of railroad rails
have usually been embodied in clamps or
plates similar to the ordinary tie-plate, but
such devices are generally too expensive for
extensive use

  One of the simplest means yet devised for
this purpose is shown in a patent No 946,411,
January xi, 1910, issued to Edward T Train-
er, of Portsmouth Ohio Mr, Trainer forms
in the base-flanges of the ordinary rail, at
the proper points, openings for the passage
of spikes of the ordinary construction, and
through these openings are driven extra
spikes, which serve to hold the rails in fixed
relation to the ties upon which they are
supported

  The ordinary spikes are also, preferably,
employed, although their use is not abso-
lutely necessary

&

SMALLER TUBES —Now that sub-
ways are coming into general use improve-
ments are being made which tend to cut
down the initial expen'e of the construction
of the way itself

  To lessen the height of the tunnel on even
a short road, would mean an enormous sa-
ving Antoine B du Pont, of Cleveland,
Ohio, has managed to accomplish this result
without a counter-expense It is true that
he contemplates a change in the construction
of the cars used on such lines, but the
change does not mean an increase in the cost
of manufacture of the cars

  The car devised by Mr du Pont is of the
ordinary construction, except that the trucks
are located beyond, the ends of the car in-
stead of beneath the car, as is customary
In other words, the car-body is supported
near the ground between two,trucks located
one at each end of the body, and, as a result,
the height of the car 'Is' reduced to a degree
equal to the height of the trucks usually
employed

&

CAR-TRUCK FRAME-A radi-
cal departure in the construction of car-
trucks is disclosed in a patent, No 944820,
December 28, 1909, issued to Theodore W
Remitters, of St Louis In this truck, the
connection between the journal-boxes at
each side of the truck is in the form of a
RECENT RAILROAD PATENTS

547

  frame above which the bolsters of the truck
are positioned On the journal-boxes are
formed guides, in which the ends of the
bolsters are guided

  Springs are arranged between the bolsters
and the frame connecting the journal-boxes,
and serve to support the bolsters in the usual
manner As a result of this arrangement,
the bolsters are prevented from moving in
a-direction lengthwise of the car, and are
guided in their up-and-down movement, due
to the yield of the springs, in a true vertical
direction

SWITCH PIVOT-in a switch-point

pivot, the principal wear is at the pivot and
on the under side of the switch-point or
tongue Heretofore, it has been difficult to
take up this wear, except by tightening the
pivot, which, as a matter of fact, only com-
pensates for the wear of the under side of
the tongue

  A switch-manufacturing company has
adopted a patent, No 946349, January 11,
1910 issued to Heenan S Goughnour, of
Johnstown, Pennsylvania, which covers a
switch construction in which the wear of
both of these parts is automatically taken up

  I11 this switch there is a tapered projec-
tion on the floor of the switch, which fits into
a similarly formed recess in the butt end of
the switch-tongue, but this recess is of a
depth greater than the height of the projec-
tion so that, as the pivot wears, the tongue
settles and the wear is taken up

  It will be understood, of course, that the
projection and the recess in which it is re-
ceived affords the pivot for the tongue

ANSWERS TO PATENT PROB-
LEMS

  Every reader who has a problem relating to
patents is welcome to the services of this de-
partment, and a letter addressed to Mr Forrest
G Smith, or to the editor, will receive atten-
tion as early as possible

FR S, Cleveland, Ohio—(1) How

•	should an inventor proceed in dis-
posing of his patent 011 a railroad device

  (2) Is it advisable to place a patent for
sale with a patent selling agency

(1) The best method is to have some com-
pany place the device in use on a short line

of their way and test it thoroughly If it

does the work better than present devices
and is not too expensive, you will find no
trouble in disposing- of the rights If this
method proves too costly, a small working
model placed with a large railway company
will probably do the work equally as well

   (2) There are numerous agencies of this
character now in existence, and many to the
sorrow of the inventor The usual scheme
is to collect a certain sum for advertising,
which may or may not be given, depending
upon the reliability of the concern In any
event, the chief motive is to get the money
for either newspaper or correspondence ad-
vertising, neither of which are of any avail
to the inventor of railway appliances The
method mentioned above, with a few excep-
tions, is the best and only reliable one to
follow

HR' R—Is it advisable for a patentee
• in this country to apply for patents
in all foreign countries

   No The general rule in such matters is
to apply only in the countries in which the
device is liable to be in actual demand Fur-
thermore, devices which would be useful in
railroading in this country would be worth-
less, as a rule, in other countries Of course,
there are exceptions, but they are few, and
definite advice can only be given regarding
specific questions in this line

&

SB—The Patent Office procedure is as

•	follows: Applications for a patent
must be made in writing to the Com-
missioner of Patents The applicant must
also file in the Patent Office a written de-
scription of the invention or discovery, and
of the manner and process of making, con-
structing, compounding, and using it, in such
full, clear, concise, and exact terms as to
enable any person skilled in the art or science
to which it appertains, or with which it is
most nearly connected, to make, construct,
compound, and use the same: and in case of
a machine, he must explain the principle
thereof, and the best mode in which he has
contemplated applying that principle, so as
to distinguish it from other inventions, and
particularly point out and distinctly claim
the part, improvement, or combination which
he claims as his invention or discovery The
specification and claim must be signed by
the inventor and attested by two witnesses

Bub Spivens Sold the Farm to Nate
Fisher and Deftly Settled an Old Grudge

■INHERE ain’t no gettin’
round it,” remarked Smi-
ler Tillery, local hog
buyer and shipper, as he
sat on a nail-keg in Scud-
der & Son’s store at Mud
Lake “ Bub Spivens is a slicker They
talk about us farmers bein’ green, and
makes jokes in these here funny papers
concernin’ how we bite greedy as get out
at everythin’ that comes along, but none
of that applies toBub Spivens, by jinks! ”
“ What’s Bub been up to ” asked Un-
cle Henry Hatfield The rest of us, in
solemn conclave assembled, waited for the
answer

  “ Bub’s sold his farm,” asserted Smiler
  “Sho!”

  “ Git out f”

  “ He ain’t, neither”

  “ Who to”

  Which comments would indicate that
Bub Spivens had pulled off an event of
more than passing interest

  “It’s a fact,” maintained the witness
stoutly “ And, what’s more, he sold it to
Nate Fisher, down in K C”

  This further insight into the subject
having provoked another chorus of re-
marks, incredulous and otherwise, Smiler
fired his last shot, which was a stunner
“ And, to cap the climax—to put the fix-
in’s on the whole business, he said,
“ Bub got ten thousand dollars in cold
hard cash for her I seen and helped heft
the money”

  There are occasions which cannot be
met by tlie mere futility of enunciated
words, and this was one of them Smiler
had floored the bunch Even Uncle Hen-
ry was knocked speechless, which was
some business, as they say in Mud Lake
Smiler, elated, began his story:

  “ You know, when old Jed Spivens died
last fall, aged eightv-one, without a rela-
tive on top of the earth anywhere, he left
a will Squire Brown drawed it up, as
you all know without me tellin> you and
you all know, besides, that Bub, who took
care of the old man the last ten years or
so, and was a mighty favorite of his too,
heired all old Jed had, which wasn’t
much, as it turned out

  “ Bub never was adopted according to
court by old Jed, but he always went by
the name of Spivens, just the same What
is Bub’s real name, Uncle Henry ”

  “ Well, now,” said that old gentleman,
taking off his glasses that he might wipe
them with his blue bandanna, “ I’ll have
to calculate a bit Bub’s ma was orig-

  “Yes but what about Bub’s pa’s

what I ast you, wasn’t it”

  “ I wuz jest gittin’ to it, blame ye!”
said Uncle Henry testily “ When Steve
McCoy died, Susy had two or three small

  “ As I was about to say,” resumed
Smiler, “ what Bub heired didn’t make
him rich, though old Jed was once pretty
well off, and about a week ago he took a
notion he’d go down to Kansas City and
see if he couldn’t get him a job in a
wholesale house or something

  “ He come to me Thursday, a week
ago, and wondered what chance he’d have
gettin’ to go down some time on a pass
when I was shippin’ a car or two o’ hogs

  “ ‘ Best in the world, Bub’ I said
‘ Come around Monday, and I'll fix you

allowed that he didn’t he guessed he

spell if he could find anything to do

“Well, Bub and me got off the train

went down-town to see the sights You
ought to seen Bub countin’ the stories in
the tall buildin’s He shore enjoyed ’em

  “ 1 Smiler, just think of the money it
took to build these here stores’ He
pointed out one ten-story buildin’-, and
said he’d pretty near bet that it hadn’t
cost a cent less than a thousand dollars
to build I just laughed at him

  “Just about then somebody hollered
acrost the street at us, and vvho’d you
reckon it was but Nate Fisher—”

  “ That low down cur,” said the Major
“That Nate Fisher skinned everybody
round here he ever had dealin’s with We
all know that he raised that note he held
on old Jesse Winthrop fr’m a hundred
dollars to nine thousand, an’ made the
widder pay it—”

  “ Yes, an’ all thet saved him wuz thet

  it couldn’t be proved on him, by hokv L ”
said Uncle Henry “ Nate Fisher would
rob his own ma an’ her down bed-fast
Why, I recollect once when he swin-
dled me out of a span o’ mules—”

  “ Yes, Nate had a little office with a
sign on it that said, ‘ Real Estate,-Loan's
and Insurance,’ ” Smiler resumed, “ and
he was standin’ in the door ‘ Come
over,’ he said to Bub and me We felt
to see if our money was safe hid in our
inside pockets and went over Nate was
as friendly as all get out

  “ ‘ Well, well,’ he went on, when we
got inside and took chairs in his little
office ‘ I ain’t seen anybody from Mud
Lake for a year of- Sundays How’s
everything Still clerkin’ in the store,
Smiler’ I told him I was buy-in’ and
shippin’ a little stock now and then He
allowed that was a good line of busi-
ness

     How’s old Jed Spivens stackin’ up,
Bub  ’ he ast ‘ I 's’pose you an’ him
are still operatin’ the hundred and fifty
acres down on the river’

  “‘Jed’s dead,’ Bub told him

  “ ‘ Well, well,’ he said, mighty sur-
prised ‘A right nice old man Jed was
You was his sole legatee, wasn’t you,
Bub’

  “ ‘ How’s that ’ ast Bub, puzzled

  “ ‘ You heired what he had, didn’t
you ’

  “ ‘ Yes, but—’

  “ ‘ Sold the old farm yet, Bub’ Nate
broke in without waitin’ for Bub to fin-
ish what he started to say

  “ ‘ Nope,’ said Bub

  “‘What’ll you take for it’ Nate
come back with

  “ ‘ Aw ! ’ Bub kind of grinned ‘ I
wouldn’t want to swindle you That
there farm of mine is—’

“‘Never mind’ said Nate ‘I know
what she is Of course it’s run down
an’ all that, but it’s good bottom land
an’ well watered, bein’ on the river—’
“ ‘ Yes, it is,’ Bub agreed

  “ ‘ I’ll give you fifty an acre for her
Bub,’ Nate said ‘ Sight unseen, take it
or leave it What d’ye say ’

  “ 1 Aw, say, now, Nate,’ Bub com-
menced I saw Bub appeared to be kind
of confused, so I butted in

Nate,’ I said ‘ Fifty an acre is a fair

  “ 1 Yes, but them kind of places has
mighty good improvements,’ he said,
‘ and you must remember I’m offerin’
spot cash I’ll write you my check for
the total amount right
now What d’ye say,

Bub ’

  “ ‘ Of course,’ he
went on, ‘ it’s under-
stood that you can
give me a clear title
to the place—’

  “ ‘ Yes, that part’s
all right,’ said Bub

1 I’ve got the will an’
all the papers in my
pocket right now

T here they are

But—”

  “ Nate was anx-
iouser than ever when
he’d looked over the
will an’ seen that Bub
was the sole heir to
the farm ‘ No buts
goes,’ he said ‘ I
won’t hold this offer
open, Bub You take
it now or it’s all off

What do ye say  ’

  “ ‘ Well, to tell the
truth—’ Bub looked
like he hated to tell
the truth just then—

‘ I’ve had a better of-
fer than that, Nate,
so I can’t do noth-
in’ for you’

 “That set Nate
afire- right away

‘Why, I’ve turned
down sixty dollars'
an acre for it once,’ Bub went on 1 I
wouldn’t be likely to take ten dollars
less’n that just ’cause it was you, would
I  ’ And Bub never cracked a smile

  “ That stumped Nate for a minute, in
fact it stumped me I was beginnin’ to
suspicion that Bub was foxier than he
looked, so I kept still Nate raised his
bid to sixty-five but Bub didn’t show
much interest Finally, he kind of
yawns and says to me:

  “ ‘ Come on, Smiler Hadn’t we bet-

ter be goin’ We’re just takin’ up Nate’s
time for nothin’’

  “ ‘ Bub, I’ll give ye ten thousand dol-
lars in cold cash for that farm,’ said
Nate, as we got up to go Bub studied
it over a minute

  “ ‘ Have you got the actual cash here,

know,’ he said finally

  “ ‘ No, but you come along with me

‘ You bet ye ! It won’t take ten minutes

in the office watchin’ the crowd go by

in yellow boys and greenbacks Bub
had chose what he could carry handy
in gold and the rest in big bills I had to
heft it once in my hands just for luck, by
George! It was some money I say

  “ Then we went in next door to where
there was one of these fellows that makes
out deeds, and Bub signed over the farm
to Nate, shook hands, ancl away we went
with the money, all we could lug

  “ 1 Wasn’t you ashamed to do it, Bub ’
I ast him, as soon as we’d put fifteen or
twenty blocks between us and Nate

  “ ‘ I would've been, if it hadn’t been
for one thing,’ he said 1 Once, when I
was a little kid, I lost a five-dollar bill—

  “ 1 Le’s go somewheres,’ he said,
‘ where we can buy us some dollar seegars
an’ hire one of these autymobiles to take
a ride around town in’ And that’s what
we did, you bet”

  There- was an uproar of laughter and

comments when Smiler finished- Even
the major unbent himself enough to ex-
press his satisfaction in no half-hearted
terms, and Uncle Henry Hatfield laughed
until the tears dripped from his chin
He had once dealt with Nate Fisher in a
horse trade, and revenge was sweet

  One man in the company did not join
in the hilarity Fie was a traveling sales-
man from Saint Jo

  “What is the funny part of it all”
this person queried “ Wasn’t the farm
anygood What the—”

  “Don’t ye ketch on” Uncle Henry
said “ This here farm o’ Bub’s avuz

  “ Where’d Bub go to, Smiler ” asked
the major

  “ The last I seen of him, he give me a
hundred-dollar bill to keep to remember
him by and got on the train for Seattle,”
said Smiler “ And he was togged up
like a banker too, I say”

EDUCATING SIGNAL-MEN

WHILE it is, perhaps, too much to say
that each successive development in
the “ art of signaling ” demands a higher de-
gree of technical knowledge and skill on
the part of the average signal-man it is
true, nevertheless, that the general improve-
ments in quality and increases in quantity
of signal and interlocking apparatus occur
so rapidly that the signal-man's responsibili-
ties are constantly becoming greater

  The growing demand for books on signal-
ing and allied subjects, and for other means
of individual study, is evidence, however,
that lie is preparing himself to meet the
new conditions

  Of great interest in this connection, are
the methods which various signal depart-
ments are adopting to place educational fa-
cilities within reach of their members Some
of these take the form of class instruction,
conducted at some central point where, at

intervals, the men within reach assemble for
general work in certain fundamental sub-
jects and for open discussion of their prob-
lems and the methods of solving them

  Others are more in the nature of indi-
vidual instruction, such as the examining of
one man on his knowledge of a text-book
previously given him to read, or upon the
rules of conduct in certain cases and the
reasons therefor or, perhaps, a series of
private lessons in a prescribed subject given
by a superior officer

  In all cases the methods employed are
those best calculated to meet the existing
conditions The comparatively large pro-
portions which some of the educational
movements have attained speak well for the
signal-man’s appreciation of his opportunity,
and the railroad's realization of the value
of a better-equipped employee— The Signal
Engineer

  The Record of 999

BY REMSEN CRAWFORD

IT is seventeen years since engine 999, of the New York Central, reeled off
what was then the fastest mile on record With one exception it is still
the record We have built heavier engines, that would pull longer trains
at a higher rate of speed for more hours than would the 999, but that wild
dash for the world’s record has been “ gone better ” but once

    Naturally, an engine built for speed, and made to produce it day in and
day out, could not be expected to last long at that sort of work Old 999
served her time as a thoroughbred, and dropped back to the cart-horse class
for a time, finally~fincling a comfortable place among the family dobbins of
the rail She is still to be found in the latter class, receiving the reward of a
long and useful life

Career of the Engine that Established a New World’s Record for
Speed in 1893, which Has Been Beaten But
Once Since That Time

them had a story to tell, and they were
trying to talk, all at once

  Presently, there came a distinct peal
from a bell—more nervous, more earnest,
wilder than the rest It carried the un-
mistakable expression of a locomotive en-
tering a city after a wearisome journey,
and soon the massive form came in view
at the head of a train of passenger-cars,
like a black giantess with a string of toys

  Nearer, clearer came the wild warning,
clanging tone, as the giantess pulled in
and glided to a halt alongside the plat-
form

Meeting an Old Friend

  I began to run my eyes over the perfect
form and figure of the great iron creature
before me, a habit I formed years ago
when my duties threw me with machinists

Secies began in the February Railroad Man's Magazine Single Copies 10 cents

LITTLE while ago I min-
gled with the throng of
happy home-comers, Hock-
ing like migratory birds
from the Thousand Islands
of the St Lawrence River
The little town of Clayton, New York,
nestling close beside the upper neck of
Lake Ontario, was literally filled that day
with its annual pilgrimage of summer
tourists

  Like a veritable army, they came on
lake or river craft, and crowded about the
railroad station, clamoring for baggage-
checks, chattering like magpies, and dri-
ving the ticket-agent to madness with a
million questions

  Out in the railroad yards the engines
were holding high carnival, their clang-
ing bells and coughing smoke-stacks
sounding for all the world as if each of

and railroad experts There was some-
thing familiar about this colossal engine
—familiar as a letter from home,

  I was wondering where I had seen her
before, when there shone forth from her
shielded breast that historic, magic name
—999!

  I had found an old acquaintance in the
crowd Thirteen years ago I had been
introduced to her in Chicago by Charley
Hogan, the daring engineer, who loved
her as he would his bride Even then I
had not felt as a stranger in the presence
of 999, for who had not heard of 999
with her record 'of a mile in thirty-two
seconds 

  She it was that revolutionized railroad-
ing : that set a new pace for express-
trains  that brought Chicago nearer to
New York, and became the pet of the
plutocrats who owned her, the pride of
the nation which adored her Yes, I
knew every chapter of her life

  Like thousands of others, I had read
of her birth in the smoky shops of the
New York Central, in April, 1893 how
she had been hailed as a creature of
destiny, fashioned as she was for the mis-
sion of mocking at all the records of
speed how she had gone forth, and with
greatest ease torn these records asunder
on her first trip, sending word to Cornelius
Vanderbilt to put on the dream of his
life—his twenty-hour train to Chicago

  I knew how she handled that train in
the years that followed in a way to scatter
consternation among the Britishers, with
their East Shore and West Shore flyers,
by settling upon this country the cham-
pionship of fast long-distance travel

Her Last Days

  I had seen her there at Chicago on ex-
hibition in the heyday of her triumph,
where thousands of World’s Fair visitors
thronged about the pedestal where she sat
like an enthroned queen of iron, twirling
her great drivers I had seen her flying
through country towns

  I had seen her in the Grand Central
Station at New York, when mechanical
engineers and all manner of men of con-
structive genius gathered around her for
study

  And here she was, at last, lost in ob-
livion to the great main line current of

traffic, pulling a train of cars on the
Rome, Watertown and Ogdensburg Di-
vision of the New York Central, between
Syracuse and Clayton

  “ How are the mighty fallen ! ” was my
first thought, and I looked with a sort of
sympathy upon the handsome creature,
which seemed to speak like something
near human, with her air-pumps groaning
and breathing as if winded and worn out
by the journey she had just made through
the clover-covered hills of northern New
York I wondered what had become of
this world-famed locomotive all these re-
cent years, when nothing has been heard
of her

Mr Vanderbilt’s Orders

  I was anxious to get accurate, reliable
information about her history in detail,
and determined to put myself in commu-
nication with all those who have been her
keepers and her associates since she was
first led out of the West Albany shops to
awaken the world

  From W O Thompson, division super-
intendent of motive power of the New
York Central at Oswego John Howard,
the superintendent at New York and
Charles H Hogan, now division superin-
tendent of motive power at Buffalo, and
formerly her engineer, who was with her
when she broke the world’s record, I have
gathered the full story of 999

  Engine 999 first glided out of the rail-
road shops of the New York Central at
West Albany one morning in April, 1893
One of the Vanderbilts had given orders
for an engine to be made that would travel
faster than anything under steam had
traveled

  He had watched the advances in rail-
roading and locomotive construction in
England and at home He had a keen
sense of the competition that was increas-
ing every day among the railroads of
America

  He had studied the natureof Americans,
and knew that they were a people of great
haste and impatience, willing to take risks
beyond all other peoples of the world to
gain a point He knew that the compe-
tition of great American trunk lines for
the future was essentially a competition
in speed

  Besides, that was the year of all years
THE RECORD OF 999

555

for the great Vanderbilt system of trans-
portation lines to make a showing It
was a festival year in the progress of
the American Republic—the year of the
Chicago World’s Fair, the greatest ex-
hibition of things industrial ever known

Cutting the Time to Chicago

  “ We must bring Chicago several hours
closer to New York” he said repeatedly
at meetings of the directors of the New
York Central We have spent millions
to make the road-bed safe and sound
What we want now is an engine that will
go the gait

  “ Have one built at any cost Put
drivers on her big enough to cover a good
jump at every stroke of the piston-rod,
and put enough steam into her cylinders
to keep those drivers busy”

  The order went to the master mechan-
ics, and they set to work The outcome
was 999, a greyhound of iron

  When she rolled out of the West Al-
bany shops that April morning, Charley
Hogan was there to take her in hand He
was an experienced engineer, a man of
nerve and determination, whose whole
life centered in his work, and who, on
many occasions, had shown himself ready
when danger lurked about his path of
duty

  “Take that engine and break the
world’s record,” was the order Hogan
received

  “ Give her to me just one day ahead of
the test,” he replied “ I want to take her
for a gallop all on the quiet, just to see
how she behaves herself”

' A “ Warming-Up ” Canter

  He was told to take 999 for as long a
time as he wanted to make the tests prior
to putting her on record publicly So
the first day out was all for Charley
Hogan’s personal benefit and satisfaction

  Hogan looked at the great driving-
wheels, taller than himself, and knew that
with their seven-foot diameter they would
cover twenty-two feet of rail at every
stroke from the cylinders He examined
all the machinery and gear, and noted
wherein it differed from other engines he
had ridden

  Fie knew the laws regulating steam

pressure,- and the power such pressure
would engender Fie was thoroughly in-
formed as to the inward nature of this
new departure in locomotive construction
All that remained was for him to get the
woii out of 999

  With a feeling of pride, he sprang into
the cab and flung himself on the seat be-
side the throttle Shining in the sun like-
a jewel, 999 glided as gracefully as a
sprite over the side-tracks andonto the
ponderous steel rails of the main line

  Charley Hogan touched the throttle
again, and the massive engine bounded
forward, sensitive as a tender colt under
the lash On and on she sped at a swift
clip, each time smarting under a pull at
the throttle, and hissing like a wild pan-
ther with each flush of steam

  Now and then Hogan closed the throt-
tle by degrees, and saw that 999 slackened
her speed quite as obediently as she had
picked it up when the throttle was opened
He tested her brakes time and again, and
saw that they would warrant him in ta-
king the bridle off if he chose, but Hogan
didn’t choose to that day

The Real Thing

  His stop-watch had told him that 999
was already a record - breaker, and he
wanted to have something up his sleeve
in the way of a surprise when the time
came for him to make the real public run

  He did not'get all out of her that he
knew to be in her on that trial trip but
when he took her to the, roundhouse at
Syracuse, that night, he had established
a record in her-favor of one hundred and
two miles an hour, and he knew by the
way he saw her bound ahead at the slight-
est touch of the throttle that she would go
faster

  It was on May 11, 1S93, that the real
test came—a race against every locomo-
tive engine on the face of theearth Char-
ley Hogan was ordered to take 999 to
Syracuse, meet the Empire State Express
there, couple onto the train, and take it
to Buffalo as fast as he could

  By this time it was generally known
that this new engine was out for the
scalps of every engine in service Specu-
lation ran high in railroad circles as to
whether the locomotive could do what had
been mapped out for her
556

THE RAILROAD MAN’S MAGAZINE

  Hogan had kept his little joke all to
liimself He knew that 999 could “ de-
liver the goods”

  He played with her a trifle after the
city of Syracuse was behind him, just to
see if she was in the same humor as-when
he first tried her out He saw that she
was If anything, she seemed all the
more anxious to be turned loose, but Ho-
gan held her down to an easy gait, and
made Rochester 011 the minute

A New World’s Record

  He knew his road-bed better between
Rochester and Buffalo He gave the
throttle a nice little squeeze, and 999
sprang forward like a nimble horse Ap-
proaching the town of Batavia, she was
rushing along at an easy gait

  Hogan touched the throttle again, and
held his hand there while he watched his
timepiece Then it was that 999 shook
herself with a tremble as a racehorse does
when a jockey digs the spurs into its
flanks, gave the cars a suggestive jerk,
and settled down in earnest

  She equaled the world’s record with
great ease, making a mile in thirty-five
seconds and Charley Hogan looked at
the fireman and smiled He pulled again
at the throttle, and murmured to himself:
“ Now, then, we’ll go after that record,
and set a new pace for the world” 

  This seemed to be what 999 had longed
for all the time, for never before had Ho-
gan pulled his throttle wide Her great
drivers sped round beneath her with mar-
velous rapidity, each time they turned
throwing the great mass of iron twenty-
two feet forward Charley Hogan was
all eyes then, for he had to keep a view
of the track ahead and watch his time-
piece too The other timekeepers on the
train were all busy with their watches

  Telegraph-poles multiplied in Hogan’s
vision as they had never multiplied be-
fore With a buzzing of air, the engineer
vaguely saw the mile - post ahead, and
fixed his eyes npon his watch The mile
had been covered in thirty-two seconds
The world’s record had been beaten for
a single mile by three seconds, and Hogan
sped on at the same gait to Crittenden,
many miles farther

  That very day the executive committee
of the New York Central Railroad held

a meeting,-sind waited for the news from
999 When it came, they voted to put on
the twenty-hour train between New Y’ork
and Chicago They also determined to
put 999 on exhibit at the World’s Fair,
and Charley Hogan was sent along with
her

  The engine and her master were greet-
ed there by thousands, and 999 became al-
most a household word She had estab-
lished a gait of 1122 miles an hour, which
had never been dreamed of, and which has
been excelled but once since, when the
Philadelphia andReading ran a train 48
miles in two minutes and thirty seconds
near Egg Harbor, Pennsylvania, in July,
1904, which is equal to 11520 miles an
hour

  Afterward, 999 was brought back East
and put in service as the star engine of
the Empire State Express, Charley Ho-
gan still at the throttle On various occa-
sions he turned her loose, each time show-
ing that she was true to the record she
had set

  Her service for several years also
proved that the public notion that she
was built as an advertisement only was
false The engine did excellent service
in pulling with safety and at great speed
heavy trains of cars on both- the New
York and the Buffalo divisions of the line

Hauling a Milk-Train

  As travel increased, however, the de-
mand for a more powerful engine grew,
and the type now in use for pulling the
Empire State Express is much heavier,
much stronger, and also very speedy,
though the record of 999 has never been
equaled by any of the newcomers

  Strange as it may appear, neither of her
twin sisters, 888 and 777, equaled the
speed test that 999 bore so easily and
equally strange it is that, although Ar-
chie Buchanan, Ed Chase, and half a
dozen other crack engineers have han-
dled 999, she has never consented to show
her speed with them at the throttle as she
did to Charley Hogan

  After she had been replaced by stron-
ger locomotives on the main line, 999 was
put to hauling a malk-train In this ludi-
crous role, she became lie target for the
bright and witty fellows of the press, and
one of them printed a very pathetic in-

terview with the old engine, which he
said she gave him on a side-track in the
freight-yards of the New York Central

  Her wheels were cut down from eightv-
four to Seventy inches, and she was sent
to the R, W and O Division for use
Division Superintendent of Motive-Power
W O Thompson thought too much of
her to give her an ordinary task, and she
is now pulling what is known as the Syra-
cuse and Clayton Club train, which is
ordinarily composed of a buffet-car three
parlor-cars, and two first-class coaches

  The schedule puts a speed on her of
about forty-five miles an hour, and she

handles the train in a highly successful
manner The engine is practically the
same now that she was when she made her
record-breaking run, except that she has
a little smaller driver and a new boiler

  Charley Hogan, her favorite engineer,
has been promoted to division superintend-
ent of tlie Buffalo Division of the New
York Central, with headquarters at De-
pew, New York He frequently gets let-
ters from all parts of the world asking
him about 999, and how he felt when she
took him over that mile in thirty-two sec-
onds  but Hogan is a modest man, and
hardly ever talks about the incident

PRIZES FOR APPRENTICES

Grand Trunk Shows How It Appreciates the Motive Power of a
Special Reward for Superior Work

THE winning of a prize, however small,
has a fascination and stimulus entirely
out of proportion to the value of the reward
There is a sort of “ glory of conquest  in
beating everybody else to a fixed goal that
appeals to human nature, especially to the
young The Grand Trunk Railway takes ad-
vantage of this instinct among its appren-
tices Every year, in every shop, it offers
prizes for excellence, says The Railway and
Engineering Review■'

  “ The annual competitive examinations is
always conducted by the company's chief
draftsman from Montreal, and has just been
completed at all the large shops along the
system Prizes are awarded to the appren-
tices obtaining the highest average in their
respective years

  “ These prizes amount to $40 for each shop,
and arc distributed over the different years
of apprenticeship, thus: The apprentice ob-
taining the highest average for his first year
in mechanical drawing gets $4 the highest
in practical mechanics $4 also So it is possi-
ble for one apprentice to obtain both prizes

  “A keen interest is taken in this examina-
tion, which takes the form of a contest be-
tween the various shops In addition lo the

prizes as stated above, there is a capital prize
offered of $25 for each subject This is com-
peted for by the apprentices obtaining the
highest averages in drawing and practical
mechanics at their respective stations

   These apprentices are given a trip to
some point 011 the system where the final
examinations are held, and the one receiving
the highest number of points in each subject
receives the amount stated

  “ This, added to what he has received at
his station, will make a total of $29, $33, or
$58 if he has been successful in all subjects

  “ After the season has closed, the boys at
some of the large shops hold what is termed
‘ apprentice night’ This is the social event
of the season Each one makes a drawing,
which is neatly gotten up and inked in

  “ This is placed on exhibition, and the
prizes are awarded for each year of appren-
ticeship These prizes amount to $250 for
the first prize, and $150 for the second prize

  “ There are also prizes offered for special
colored drawings amounting to $3 for first
prize, and $150 for second prize This may
be competed for by any apprentice, irre-
spective of his year, and considerable interest
is manifested by those of artistic ability”

Why It Is Hard to Quit When Once You Have Eaten Cinders

PIEY-’VE got railroad bookkeeping
down to a fine point” said an old

  “If my engine needs a flag, I am ordered
to get it, and it is charged up against the

more team work and a greater desire to
help one another

   Now, according to the rules, a brake-
man is not supposed to shovel coal for a
fireman and a fireman is not supposed to
disconnect an engine for a brakeman, when
water is being taken, but in an emergency, the
brakeman is doing the proper thing if lie
helps the fireman to shovel down coal in
the tender One trainman I know was
fired because he delayed a train twenty-
five minutes by just such a refusal Fie
wasn’t cooperating

  “ Speaking about cooperating, did you
ever read a statement on the subject, post-
ed in the various roundhouses and depots
011 the New York Central President
Brown is full of the idea It isn’t just talk,
but he means what he says He is one of
the friendliest of men you ever knew

  “ We railroad men would be sitting
around and Brown would come walking in
Everybody would be quiet as a mouse
Brown would say:

  “•You needn’t be afraid of me, boys,’
and then he would commence to talk in a
friendly manner Before long he would
get deep into the subject of railroading,
and he would tell what the road is trying
to do

  “ When he gets interested, he almost
cries Every' one likes Brown He worked

up from the bottom and has a deep regard
for every man on the road Any man with
a grievance can carry jt straight to Brown
and he will listen

  “ The men would do anything for Brown
It makes all the difference in the world
how the boss stands with you W'hile I
was working on another road, there was
one boss we all liked When he asked us
to do anything, we did it speedily and cheer-
fully But the other fellow would try to
boss us about as though we were slaves

  “ When he was out of sight, we’d loaf
When I got ready to quit, I quit gladly

  “ Speaking about quitting, a whole lot of
railroad men are just ready to quit They
keep saying, ‘ Well, I’m going to quit’ But
they never do There’s something fasci-
nating about railroading You come home
dead tired and swear that you'll never go
back again, but there you are, just as sure
as fate An engineer I know says that
every trip will be his last, but it isn’t

  “ I said once to a fireman who was talk-
ing about quitting:

  “‘Why, man, you’re earning four or five
dollars a day What would you do if you
quit—you are too old to learn anything
else  ’

  “He said: ‘Well, I guess T can do car-
pentry, just as I did before 1 came on the
road’

  “ He thinks he could, but he couldn’t
He has forgotten a lot of carpentry, and,
besides, he would be twenty years behind
the times

  “ I know a conductor who got fired He
was earning good money, but now he is
cleaning streets Another man works in
a brewery Another works about a hotel,
and I know quite a number that have jobs
which pay about a third what they got on
the road They left too old to learn some-
thing that paid as well as railroading

  “If they have saved, they may start a
small business, but they will not be up-to-
date in that business Railroading is hard
work It pays well, and there is something
about it that makes it hard to cut loose
from it Once a railroad mail, always a
railroad man”

CHAPTER V

Greek Meets Greek

BOUT ten minutes later the
fire - gong clanged To
Leigh’s astonishment, no
man rose to ascertain
the location of the fire
by consulting the signal-
book “ Four—nine—three,” he said, as
the gong beat out the signal-numbers for
the third time “If I recollect aright,
that’s at Atwood and River Streets—tene-
ment - house district, with the Folsbee
paint-factory in the middle of it” And
lie reached for his hat

  “Where are you going” cried Hal-
stead

  “ To see what the fire amounts to,” said
Leigh curtly

“ Aw, sit down,” laughed the other,

“ and get used to the ways of this crowd
We don’t go out on first-alarm fires—
only third alarms”

  “'But,” asked Leigh, “ suppose things
break loose on your first alarm—as they’re
likely to—what then Some of these
dinky little fires give up the most news”

  “ We hear of them through police head-
quarters, or somebody calls us up from
the precinct station-house, or if an am-
bulance has been wanted, the hospital doc-
tors usually give us the tip over the tele-
phone,” explained El)'

  “ Easy times you must have, remarked
Leigh tentatively

  “ Sure thing,” said Ely “ Else, what’s
the use of a  combine ’  ”

  Leigh looked doubtfully at the speak-
er “ You must miss a whole lot of good
stuff, waiting for news instead of hustling
for it” he said

Began In the March Railroad Man’s

  “ We get all the news that' we want,”
snapped Ely, “ and — I don’t think we
want any advice on the subject As a
committee of ways and means, this crowd,
up to date, is satisfied with itself and its
methods of doing tilings Give-me three
cards, Cronson”

  “ Keep your hat on, Ely,” remarked
Allen “ You forget that Billy’s a stran-
ger to us, and that in consequence lie’s got
a right to ask questions As a matter of
fact, we do let a bunch of news give us the
go-by every day, just because we’re too
lazy or dopey te grab it”

  “Keno!” howled Griggs, suddenlv
awakening and as suddenly going to
sleep again

  “ Griggs and Allen seem to think that
they’re on ‘ space,’ like Leigh is,” said Ely
maliciously

  Allen flushed “If I were, maybe I’d
make you make a bluff at earning your
living,” he retorted “ It isn’t by reason
of your society being so everlastingly fas-
cinating, Ely that I’m found in it for
some hours daily It’s only because—”

“ Oh, stop growling, you two,” inter-
posed Halstead, “ or have it out when the
game’s finished Your ante, Bronson”
The men subsided as bidden, and Leigh
again moved toward the door

  “Hold-on a minute Billy I’ll go
with you,” said Allen suddenly “ And ”
—he glanced at Griggs—“ I think a walk
would do him good, too, eh ”

  Leigh assented Griggs was protest-
ingly hoisted to his feet, his face swabbed
with a towel dipped in ice-water, and,
after a brief struggle—during which Al-
len administered what he described as the
“ facial percussion treatment ” with the
flat of his huge hands—Griggs departed
peacefully with the others

  The fire did not amount to anything
apart from the panic which is the accus-
tomed accompaniment of a tenement-
house blaze  so the trio—Griggs having
become his own man again—turned to go

  “ Where now ” asked Allen

  Leigh pulled out his note-book and
read off a list of happenings that were
to take place in the district during the
evening—it was then only half past seven
o’clock

  Allen looked puzzled “ You’re surely
not going to look after all of these ” he
asked

  “ Won’t the rest of the fellows handle
some of them ” asked Leigh

  The other shook his head “ No I’m
pretty sure thev won’t”

  “ And why not ”

  “ Well,” said Allen hesitatingly, “ we
’—that is, they—don’t trouble with much
outside of the ‘ must ’ matter of the dis-
trict”

  Leigh made a gesture of impatience
“ Well, Jimmie, just for once, break the
rules and come along with me”

  The other shook his head, but hesitated
nevertheless “ I’m one of the combine,
you must remember,” he said laughingly

  “ And I’m sorry you are, considering
what the combine is,” replied Leigh
gravely

  Allen grunted, and Griggs snickered

  Leigh didn’t pursue the subject further,
and the two walked a block in silence
Leigh halted as a cross-town car-track
was reached

  “ I’m going over to Columbia Hall to
the Highburg Board of Trade meeting,”
he announced “ Understand they’re go-
ing to get busy with Burke and his crowd
to-night over the Main way improvement
and other local contracts We have a hint
that there will be a red-hot time of it,
and that the preliminaries, looking to a
legislative investigation of Burke and his
crowd, are to be put in play”

  Allen looked at him queerly “ You
know, I suppose, Billy, that—that—Burke
is a pretty decent fellow”

  “ Never heard it till now Thought he
was about as bad as they make ’em, po-
litically and in other ways But, sup-
posing that he deserves your good-con-
duct badge, what’s that to do with the
board meeting ”

  The other looked uncomfortable

  “ Well, I’ll put it another way, then,”
replied Allen 11 He stands well with the
combination”

  “ And”

  “ The combination doesn’t like to see
its friends get the rowel”

  “ Have you been asked to tell me
this” said Leigh, looking Allen square-
ly in the face

  “ I have notr Billy,” was the instant an-
swer “ But you and I have always hit it
well together, and—and—well, I don’t
want to see a good fellow like you run
up against a barbed=wire fence, as some
of your predecessors have done—to their
disadvantage”

  Leigh smiled “ I appreciate the warn-
ing, Jimmie, but when the combine pays
me my salary I’ll do by it and its friends
as it wishes, and not before It may think
it owns Highburg, but it’s beautifully
mistaken if it thinks it owns me”

  “ The others talked like that,” said Al-
len, with a note of pleading hi his voice,
“ Good for them I’m sorry that they
didn’t last out,” was the reply

  A car hove in sight “ Will you come
along” asked Leigh

  “No,” said the other but he looked
wistfully at his friend

  “ Then, good-by for the present,” cried
Leigh as he caught the car on the fly
“ I’ll see you later at the Municipal”

  At about eleven o’clock Leigh, true to
his promise, appeared at the reporters’
quarters Five of the combine were pres-
ent, including Allen The poker - game
was still on

  “Anything doing” he asked cheer-
fully

  Jennison, the dean of the combine, and
representative of the Martport Gazette,
exchanged glances with the others

  “ Have you got anything ” he said

  “ Yes,” replied Leigh, producing a
note-book and copy “ Good stuff at that
Want to take any of it ”

  “ I’d like to hear what you have first,”
growled Jennison “ Maybe we’ll use it,
and maybe we won’t” His tone was a
challenge

  Leigh felt that a crisis was approach-
ing Then he proceeded to read, noting,
however, that none of the others were ta-
king notes of his items When he had
concluded, Jennison spoke again

  “ That kidnaping affair in the fifth pre-
BREAKING THE COMBINE

cinct will probably turn out to be just an
ordinary case of lost kid I don’t take
any stock in it, and won’t write it Un-
derstand If the Strauss'sugar-house ac-
cident had been as out of the ordinary as
you say it was, it’s queer that we didn’t
hear of it from Dr Bayliss, of St Mary’s
Hospital As we don’t usually go over
the doc’s head, we won’t use that, gither
About the Board of Trade meeting we'll
send in a few words”

  Leigh looked at him “ Did I make
myself quite clear” he asked “Sena-
tor Clives and Assemblyman Potter de=
liberately charged Burke and his asso-
ciates with out-and-out theft, and pledged
themselves to set the wheels of legal and
legislative machinery in motion to punish
them Their speeches were the culmina-
tion of a whole lot of sizzling oratory”
“Oh,” snorted Jennison, “those stiffs
are all hot air Burke is It in this dis-
trict, and cares 110 more for the gassing of
that crowd than he does for a ten-spot
when one of the boys needs it Burke's
all right”

  Leigh felt himself growing hot at the
clumsy hint of the speaker, but managed
to keep control of his temper Just then
he glanced at Allen, and the expression on
the latter’s face puzzled him it seemed
as if the big fellow was encouraging him
to continue the controversy, which, in-
deed, Leigh was only too willing to do,
being in no humor for compromise, and
feeling, too that he had reached the part-
ing of the ways

  “ Leigh—” began Ely

  “ You’ll kindly hold your tongue,” ins
terrupted Allen, a gleam of battle-light
coming in his eyes “ Leigh’s got the
floor”

  Ely scowled, and Leigh resumed

“ Burke may be all right as you know
him, but that’s 110 reason why I should
kill a piece of news in which he figures”
“ Leigh’s on space, you know,” said
Ely, with a grin, addressing Jennison

  “ And if Leigh wasn’t 011 space,” re-
torted that individual, “ he would do pres
cisely as lie’s now doing It would al-
most seem, lily, as if you were not in the
district to get_news, but to keep mum
about Burke in return for Burke’s rum”
“ Rime and reason,” chuckled Griggs
Ely again opened his mouth to reply,
and once more Allen cut him short

    12 R R

  “ Shut up! ” he said angrily “ This is
between Leigh and Jennison When they
get through, you can butt in Meantime
put the nippers on that wagging jaw of
yours”

  Jennison rose and lit his pipe “ We
may as well understand each other first as
last,” he said, turning to Leigh “ If you
care to come into the combine, you’re wel-
come, provided you do as the combine
does But I’ve a shrewd notion that you’re
in the district for the express purpose of
going it alone Maybe I’m wrong, but I
think I’m right You’re a clever boy,
Leigh, but if you imagine that you can
down this little coterie as easily as you’ve
done some other star jobs on the Record,
you’re mistaken”

  “ I think,” replied Leigh slowly, “ that
it’s come to a show-down I’m here to
get the news of Highburg—and I intend
to get it If 1 tread on the corns of you
fellows or those of your friends, I shall be
sorry—but I’m out for the news, all the
same”

  “ Don't be a fool,” broke in Halstead
“ Even as it is, there’s sufficient space in
this job—plus your salary — to satisfy
your-lust for dollars, Billy”

  “ The job might satisfy his pocket, but
not his conscience, you know,” said Jennis
son, with a lumbering attempt at sar-
casm

  “ I don’t consider you an authority on
matters of conscience,” retorted Leigh
“ Anyhow, I'll have none of the combine,
as it’s now run, in mine : so good night”

  “ Go, and be hanged! ” snarled Jenni-
son “ A couple of weeks hence you’ll be
begging us to let you come back into the
fold”

  “ I don't think so,” said Allen sudden-
ly “ Leigh’s 110 cur And all of the
combine is not of your way of thinking,
either”

CHAPTER VI

The First Gun Fired

TENNIS,ON and the rest looked at him
 with mute amazement Allen was
bundling together copy, paper, note-
books, tobacco-box, pipes, and other of
his belongings

  “ Leigh’s estimate of this gang and its
ways is about right,” he said wrathfully,

stopping suddenly in his work and turn-
ing to the others 11 We’re a measly lot
of muckers, who sell our souls for gratis
booze and a microscopic share-of the big
graft that the Burke species couldn't get
within a mile of if we didn’t keep our
pencils quiet

  “ A sweet, wholesome, lovable congre-
gation we are,” he went on his voice
booming with self-contempt and anger,
“ gorgeous specimens of 1 gentlemen of
the press’ Oh, and a gritty lot too—
such a gritty lot! Afraid to even claim
what’s coming to us as accomplices of the
gang that runs this district that engineers
the rotten deals which have made High-
burg notorious”

  “Are you crazy, Allen” cried Jen-
nison

  “No nor drunk!” said the other fierce-
ly “ But Leigh’s stand on the matter has
brought to a head my determination—
that isn’t by any means new—to cut the
combine—”

  “ Rot! ” cried Halstead

  “Truth!” replied Allen “I’ll not
stand in any longer with— Here, Leigh,
let’s get out of this, or I’ll be saying
things that I’ll be sorry for”

  “ You’ll be sorry for what you have
said” declared Jennison threateningly

  Leigh took the other by the arm before
he could reply, faced him toward the door,
and without further words the pair left
the Municipal Allen was hot with ex-
citement

  “ I want a drink, Billy,” he declared
as they drew near the cafe at the next
corner

  “ You’ll drink—ice-water—at my—at
our office,” replied Leigh  “ nothing else,
until we have sent our copy down”

  “ Your office ”

  “ Yep I looked for this rumpus, and
so got quarters beforehand It’s a block
farther up—first floor—over Higgins’s
drug-store Snug place, and I’ve a tele-
phone installed also two desks”

 “Two”

  “To tell the truth, Jimmie I half-
expected that I'd succeed in persuading
you to break with that crowd Anyhow,

I intended to try But I didn’t look for
the rupture to come about quite so sud-
denly”

  “ Nor I, although it was inevitable
But I heard a tale to-night, after I left

you, about certain easy money that came
to Ely recently, that sickened me—and
so the explosion Still, as I said I’ve
been thinking over this step for a month
or two I'm not quite a bad 'un, Billy,
and my little tears have always been of
the impulsive sort

  “ But this cool business of sitting down
and making a permanent job of booze
and loafing and borrowing is too much
for me You-r coming here was a god-
send There is many a man who reallv
wishes to get out of the gutter but can’t
manage it, simply because his moral knees
are a bit too weak to help him onto the
sidewalk of decency

  “ That’s the time for the friendly hand
to get in its fine work My moral plans
and specifications aren’t in keeping with
my chest development, I’m afraid — in
which respect you have the advantage of
me” And he clapped Leigh affection-
ately on the shoulder

  “ You’re all to the good Jimmie,” said
Leigh heartily adding, with a chuckle:
“ It’s been an iridescent evening The
inventory to date includes a fight with the
combine, a news sensation for to-morrow,
the rescue of a good fellow from perdi-
tion, and trouble ahead”

  “ And a bad beginning for the com-
bine I’ll bet those fellows are Worried,”
said Allen

  “ Not as much as they will be, though
By the Big Blue Pencil, but we’ll make
’em work! ”

  “ You couldn’t hurt their feelings
worse than by causing them to do that”
remarked the other with another cavern-
ous smile

  And then they reached their destina-
tion, and wrote and telephoned news to
their respective papers until nearly
two AM

  Leigh, that same morning, published
in the Sentinel the proposed Burke inves-
tigation  and as he had written it, it was
as Staynes remarked, “ Hot stuff” The
kidnaping case, too made interesting
reading There were also half a dozen
other good items The night’s work had
been entirely satisfactory

  Allen had done nearly as well : so much
so, indeed, that the city editor of the
Clarion telephoned him, asking the where-
fore of his unwonted industry The news-
papers of the combine had as Jennison
liad promised, but a few lines of the
Burke sensation In consequence, there
was a lurid and general calling down of
the combine members by their several edi-
tors, the replies to which were that the
Sentinel story was more of a fake

  Jennison and the rest of the combine
began to feverishly plan for Leigh’s and
Allen’s undoing

  Before he went over to Highburg that
evening, Leigh dropped in at the Sentinel
office Staynes greeted him heartily
“ Ridgely’s highly delighted over the
Burke story,” he said “ Billy, you’re the
only cereal Are you going to give us
more of the same to-night”

  “ I guess so—including a talk with
Burke If lie’ll talk And, Sam, I now
expect trouble The combine will, among
other things, see to it that I don’t get
much out of the station-house blotters
So, get your police headquarters man to
keep his eye 011 any slips that come from
the Highburg precincts, ahd ring me up
if he notes anything important”

  “ It shall be done,” said Staynes “ and
don’t hesitate to let me know if at any
time you want any help”

  “’I won’t, but I’ve a good man to work
with as it is” And he told the tale of
Allen’s withdrawal from the combine

  The city editor laughed “ ’Tis the lit-
tle rift within the lute of the combine,
Billy,” he said gleefully

  “ Yes,” replied Leigh  “ but ’tis only
the commencement, remember, and there’ll
be music in the air before the end comes”
Not far from the druggist’s over which
he had made his headquarters, Leigh ac-
tually ran into Burke when he was leav-
ing a cigar-store Now, the politician
knew the foolishness of unnecessarily an-
tagonizing a newspaper man in the lat-
ter’s personal capacity So he caught
Leigh by the arm as if he were trying to
save him from a fall, laughing heartily as
he did so

  “Hallo, Leigh!” he cried “That
you Trying to break my neck, are you
I think that’s rubbing it in, after the

	roast ’ I got in the papers to-day” And
again he laughed—a well-fed, well-oiled,
well-trained laugh

  Leigh said something in the way of
apology, and added:

  “ 1 was going to look you up later to
ask if you had anything to say regarding

my article This meeting will save me
that trouble, if you can give me ten min-
utes”

  “ Ten minutes, my boy! ” cried the
other ''“Why, cert’ Half an hour, if
you want it Come down to my place and
we’ll open a small bottle”

  “ No,” said Leigh, “ let’s go to my of-
fice We’ll be free from interruption
there”

  “Your office” asked Burke with a
capital affectation of surprise “ Why,
aren’t you down with the rest of the boys
at the Municipal You know you’re wel-
come there, however much you pound me

  Leigh glanced at him, understanding
perfectly that he knew

  “ Oh, that’s all right,” he said
“ Thanks, just the same But I like a
quiet life, and—here we are”

  He led the way up-stairs The poli-
tician noted the telephone and other sug-
gestions of permanent occupation

  “ You look as if you thought you were
here to stay,” he said, and the reporter de-
tected a tinge of malice in the remark

  “ Yes,” replied Leigh easily, “ that’s
what I’m here for And now, as I don’t
want to detain you, let me ask—”

  So he put a lot of questions relative to
the charges made against Burke at the
Board of Trade meeting Some were an-
swered direct, others evaded, and yet oth-
ers failed of reply altogether because, so
the politician alleged, he knew nothing of
their subject-matter

  The interview ended, and Burke rose
“ I suppose the Sentinel's going for me
again to-morrow  ” he asked with a care-
less smile

  Leigh smiled back, but replied not

  “ Why have you got it in for me,
Billy” went 011 the “boss” good-na-
turedly “ Was I ever up against you in
any way”

  “ No,” said Leigh rather sharply “and
if you had been, it wouldn’t have made
the slightest difference one way or the
other It’s a plain proposition, Burke—
that, and nothing more I’m in this dis-
trict for the news, and the news I pro-
pose to get

  “ Just now you happen to be the news
You’re the best judge as to whether you
are or are not to blame for that fact But
there’s no personal equation in this, so
far as I am concerned If the Board of
564

THE RAILROAD MAN’S MAGAZINE

Trade had voted you a halo, instead of
handing you the remarks that it did I
should have written the proceedings just
the same—as news”

  “ And news it would have been, in-
deed” replied the other with a grim
chuckle “ Well, I’ll be going But I
hope that, outside of business, we’ll be
friends”

  “ I never ask too much of human na-
ture,” replied Leigh with a laugh that,
however, didn’t veil the meaning of his
words

  “ Nor I” He stopped 'on his way to
the door and faced the reporter “ I like
an honest fighter like you Leigh and, as
I said before, I hope we’ll be friends,
come what may But,” and he spoke
very slowly and deliberately, “ I think
you’re making a fool of yourself That
little row at Columbia Hall don’t amount
to a pinch of snuff You’re not familiar
with things in Highburg or you wouldn’t
attach any importance to it Why, those
long-eared mules—”

  “Is this for publication” asked
Leigh, in accordance with reportorial
etiquette

  “ I don’t give a flip whether you write
it or not,” replied Burke “ The point
I’m getting at is this: we—myself and
friends — happen to be running affairs
hereabouts just now The other fellows
are squealing because they’re not in on
the game By the looks of things, they’re
likely to remain out of it for a long time
In fact, 1 don’t see how they’re going to
sit in anyhow Consequently, while they
may make a whole lot of noise, no harm’s
coming to any one on this side of the
house See! You ain’t a baby, Leigh:
you know what practical politics are”

  “ And this, too, is for publication, I
suppose” said the reporter

  “No, it isn’t,” replied Burke bluffly:
“ it’s for you, and you only It’s this way
What’s the use of you making yourself un-
popular among people who have the
power and who are willing to be friends
of yours ”

  “Friends” said Leigh quietly “In
what way”

  “ Any way you like,” replied the other
significantly

  “ I wish you hadn’t said this to me”
“Why” asked Burke, staring in a
puzzled fashion

  “ Of course I understand what you
mean and so there is only one way of
replying”

  “ That being”

  “ Well,” said Leigh with a smile,
“ you’ll find out soon enough But you’re
not the only practical politician who has
made the same blunder”

   “ I’ll be shot if I know what you’re get-
ting at, Billy,” replied the boss

  “ The fact is, Mr Burke,” said Leigh
very deliberately, “ that you’re so used to
mixing up with people who can be bought
at a price that you imagine every man has
his price—when you want to buy him
And therein lies your mistake”

  “ It’s a fair proposition, anyway,” re-
turned Burke “ I never ask a man to do
anything for me that I ain’t willing to
pay for”

  “ If you think it’s worth paying for at
your figure, you mean I don’t think that
we need talk further about the point in-
volved,” replied Leigh “ You’ll have to
excuse me, for I’ve a lot to do”

  Burke didn’t go on the instant, how-
ever Instead, he came back into the
room a little way

  “ You’re going to declare war, then”
he cried, with another hearty laugh

  “ No,” said Leigh “ but I’m going to
tell the truth about Highburg—and some
of its people”

  “ Umph! ” snorted the politician
“Telling the truth, as you call it, ain’t
always the way to keep the peace”

       CHAPTER VII
       In Working Order

TEIGH didn’t answer, and Burke
•—' again made for the door “ Well,
Billy, good night to you, and remem-
ber that all’s fair in love and war,” he
said

  The reporter turned to him with a con-
fident laugh “ You intend that as a hint
as to what I am to expect, but you haven't
a monopoly on everything and everybody
hereabouts — especially the ear of the
public”

  Leigh worked on his interview with
Boss Burke for an hour or so, and then
went to hunt up some of the Board of
Trade members On his return to the
office at nine o'clock he found, somewhat

to his surprise, that Allen had not turned
up

  Consoling himself with the thought
that Allen was probably going the rounds
of the district and would presently put
in an appearance, he turned to the Burke
matter once more Just as he finished
writing, the telephone-bell rang Allen
was on the wire

  “ That you, Billy ”

  “ Yes”

  “ I’m sorry to have to tell you, old
man, that I’ve come to the conclusion
that you and I can’t work together after
all,” said Allen

  “ Is this a joke, Jimmie ”

   “ No  it’s deadly earnest It isn’t that
I’m scared of the combine, but I can’t
afford to antagonize a lot of people in
Highburg by standing in with you—
Burke among them”

  “ Up to now,” answered Leigh, “ I’d
have smashed the man who said in my
hearing that Jimmie Allen was a coward
But I’d let him go on talking now”

  “ Think what you like of me,” came
back, “ but my mind's made up”

  “Are you going it alone, then”

  “ I can’t quite tell what I’m going to
do Maybe I shall ask our people to
take me out of the district altogether
Maybe I’ll resign And Billy, be warned
by me—cut out the Sentinel and don’t
try to fight the combine and the people
that it’s friendly with”

  Leigh cut the conversation short by
hanging up the receiver

   “ Allen, of all men,” he muttered “ I’ll
lie hanged if I can believe it But I’ll
see him to-morrow and find out the true
inwardness of his surrender There’s
something in this that he hasn’t hinted at
Trying to scare me off by throwing it
into Jimmie, are they Well, we shall
see”

  Leigh, who had an unduly obstinate
chin, unconsciously protruded that feature
at the Burke interview Then he tele-
phoned to Staynes to send a man to help
him over the evening, Allen’s deser-
tion having upset his plan of campaign
Staynes sent him Bryant, who had a repu-
tation as a hustler Together the two
reporters got a tidy budget of news, al-
though at a couple of station-houses the
blotters were grudgingly opened by the
gruff desk sergeants At some of the

gathering places of Burke’s associates—
centers of political news—Leigh's recep-
tion was, to put it mildly, cheerless The
leaven of the combine was evidently at
work

  When he reached the office again Bry-
ant handed him a note that had come by
a messenger It was from Allen, and as
Leigh read it he chuckled and slapped his
knee

   “ Bryant,” said he, “ please take carbon
copies of what you have, and let me have
them And you can quit when you’ve got
through with your copy We won't try
to cover the district again to-night”

  At eleven-thirty came another messen-
ger from Allen, bearing a bulky envelope,
and receiving in exchange one from
Leigh-, When at midnight one of the
Sentinel boys came for copy he took back
with him a note for Staynes marked
“ Strictly personal”

  Now, the Highburg morning news-
paper men were on duty until three am,
at which hour they gave the “ good-
night ” signal over the telephone to their
respective offices

  Three-quarters of an hour before,
Leigh laid down his cigar “ I don’t
quite like to do it,” he said to himself,
“ but one has to fight the devil with fire,
I suppose”

  He rang up the Sentinel He must talk
to Mr Staynes personally and in a hurry
Staynes came quickly, and in a voice that
trembled with apparent excitement, Leigh
gave him a brief but sufficient bit of ex-
clusive news of a sensational sort

   It was to the effect that the two-year
old child of Henry F Dobson, one of the
most prominent and wealthy men of High-
burg, had been kidnaped from out of the
Dobson mansion on the upper part of
Arlington Avenue on the outskirts of the
borough

   The child slept in a large nursery, on
one corner of which was a bed occupied
by the nurse Some time after midnight
the nurse was awakened by a draft of air
blowing on her lace She found that the
window of the nursery was open, and that
the child’s bed was empty

   A ladder leaning against the side of the
house showed how the kidnapers had
gained access to the room The extensive
grounds that surrounded the house fur-
nished ample cover for the movements of

THE RAILROAD MAN'S MAGAZINE

the daring person who had stolen the
child

  One of the mysteries of the case was
that three or four dogs that were let loose
in the grounds at night, had given no
warning of the presence of the kidnapers
When Mrs Dobson was notified of her
loss-she became insensible, and a physi-
cian, who was called, declared her to be
in a critical condition

  The subsequent confusion was respon-
sible for the police not being -promptly
notified Coming on top of the other kid-
naping affair of two days before, it seemed
as if a daring and organized gang of child
stealers was operating in Highburg

  “Exclusive” asked Staynes over the
wire as Leigh finished

  “ That’s what I said,” was the reply,
“ and I think I’ll give you ‘ good-night’ ”

  Leigh hung up the receiver and stood
looking at the telephone doubtfully

  “ I don’t know,” he said to himself as
he shook his head, “ but I suppose it was
called for Yet—”

  He turned out the lights and left

       CHAPTER VIII
       Blocking the Game

'T'HAT same morning every one of the
newspapers represented by the
members of the combine published the
alleged kidnaping In one or two cases
the night city editors had added such
additional sensational touches as their
overheated midnight imaginations had
prompted

  Neither the Sentinel nor Allen’s paper
had a solitary line about the affair All
of the Martport evening sheets, in com-
menting on the story as a rank fake, ex-
plained that no such person as Henry F
Dobson lived in Highburg, and that the
scene of the alleged kidnaping was in
reality a soap-factory

  Allen dropped in at the Seventeenth
District Court at about noon

  “ You see, Billy” he said to Leigh, “ as

I	couldn’t explain at length in my note,
one part of the plan of the combine to
shut out an anticombine man was to have
the telephone ‘ centrals ’ tip us off when
the former was phoning to his office and
they connect us with the wire that he was
using

  “ Consequently, we only had to listen
and take notes of what he was saying in
order to make it nearly impossible for
him to ‘ scoop ’ us We were always pret-
ty well posted by headquarters and our
friends on the early news of the district,
and the only chance that the other chap
had of twisting our tails was to watch
out for the happenings that we were like-
ly to miss late at night, being busy with
flushes and full hands

  “ Of course, the gang knew that I
would tell you all this but that alone
wouldn’t have done much good to either
of us Central would have gone on con-
necting your wire with theirs, you would
not have been able to prove it, and your
phone would, in consequence, have been
practically useless”

  “ So, your object, then, was for the
Sentinel to get positive evidence that a
leak was taking place with the conni-
vance of a telephone operator ”

  “ Precisely And that, too was why I
kept away from your office last night and
made suggestions by note as to how you
should work the thing I wanted you
and Staynes to be able to swear that only
you two had engineered the test of Cen-
tral’s probity”

  “ And that, too, is why you so cruelly
severed your connection with me over the
phone,” said Leigh, with a grin He
frowned a trifle “ It was justifiable, I
suppose,” he said haltingly “ but, to tell
the truth, Allen, I didn’t like to do it
I’m naturally not a very fluent liar, and
it was certainly a bit of tall lying, you
must confess”

  “Tut, tut!” cried the big reporter
“ It was merely a diplomatic assertion
spiced with necessary reservation The
end always shakes hands with the means
when the scrap between fact and fiction is
over”

  “ But why did you want me to send a
copy of my news to your house instead of
coming to the office for it ”

  “ I haven’t the slightest doubt that your
incoming and outgoing was the object of
much interest last evening,” replied Al-
len “ If, then, 1 had visited you after
telephoning my irrevocable determination
not to have anything more to do with you,
the sincerity of my declaration might have
been doubted by some of my late asso-
nates”

  Leigh’s eyes twinkled “ How are you
going to square yourself when they find
out how they’ve been done by you”

  “ I shall explain that you have exer-
cised undue influence over me,” was the
reply “ And if thati doesn’t satisfy them,
I'll call their attention to the fact that it’s
none of their business”

  To be beaten by the Sentinel and Clar-
ion over the Burke scandal was bad
enough, but the Dobson kidnaping fake
emphasized the need Of drastic remedial
action

  The interview with Burke obtained by
Leigh was,, as written by the latter,
“ tabascoesque,” as Allen put it Worst
of all, there had begun to arise a public
murmur that the Sentinel and the Record
were the only papers that had sufficient
pluck to tackle the rotten politics of
Highburg

  The emphatic word went forth that,
combine or 110 combine, such happenings
as had characterized the past two days of
Highburg’s news couldn’t and wouldn’t
be tolerated—that the next exclusive
piece of news would be equivalent to the
dismissal of everybody concerned there-
with

  The combine took the rebuke scorn-,
fully and sullenly Burke was informed
That afternoon the Highburg boss had a
talk with one of the biggest men of the
party And the big man, who was very
corpulent and had elephantine ears that
readily lent themselves to the purposes of
the cartoonist-, called at the offices of the
morning newspapers, who, politically,
were affiliated with him and his He
wanted to know if it were true that they
“ was going to give the foot to some of
them Highburg boys jus’ because the boys
hadn’t thrown it good an’ heavy into
Burke”

  And he wanted to know if there was
“ anything doin’—any hedging or fence-
straddling behind it all See” And
“ never mind who he got it from—it come
to him as straight as he wanted it An’
of course they could do as they bloody-
well pleased but if they was goin’ to
fall in behind the Sentinel muckrcart, he
wanted to have it aforehand An’ while
he didn’t give a so forth and so 011 what
they was goin’ to do, the party wasn’t
goin’ to be played for a fool! ”

  When tiie combine-breakers met again

that evening they had the air of those who
know that real work lies before them

  “ The overture being over, the play is
about to begin,” said Allen

  Leigh nodded “ Yes, we’ve got busy
times ahead Those fellows will stick us
mostly 011 station-house stories In other
directions I think we can hold our own,
or nearly so But when it conies to the
station-houses, I confess that I’m a bit
puzzled as to how to act”

  “ You’re right, Billy,” admitted Allen
“ The same thing has occurred to me I,
too, don’t quite see how we can get next
in this direction”

  Leigh mused “ The only thing that
we can do for the present is to wait de-
velopments If we find that we’re being
studiously thrown down by our friends
in uniform, why, but one way remains”

  “ The same being ”

  “Usually, Jimmie, one catches more
flies with sugar than vinegar In the first
instance we’ll try the saccharine treat-
ment if that fails we’ll have to turn 011
the sour”

  “Excellent! But how”

  “ Did you ever yet know of a copper
who hadn’t a motli-hole or two in his rec-
ord, through which you could prod him
with a pencil and make him squeal  ”
The light of understanding spread over
Allen’s countenance

  “ True,” he said “ If I hadn’t been
in the combine 1 wouldn’t have been put
next to the ways of the gents in question”
“ And I, too, have some similar notes
in the neighborhood of my cuffs,” replied
Leigh “ Altogether I think that we’re
pretty well heeled for whatever sort of
game we may run up against”

  The earlier part of the evening passed
without incident, except that at the quar=
ters of the Franchise Club Leigh was re-
fused admission, 011 the plea that an ex-
ecutive meeting of the members was in
progress

  Burke was president of the organiza-
tion, which, politically, was the most
prominent of its kind in Highburg, and
Leigh felt that something was brewing
that was being kept from him purposely

  He determined to find out just what it
was Therefore, after telephoning to Al-
len, he began to patrol the sidewalk op-
posite the clubhouse, keeping in the shad-
ows of the trees and an arc-light The

meeting being over, he saw Halstead and
Jennison leave with others, which con-
firmed his suspicions He observed one
Brone—a small, rotund German, the pro-
prietor of a saloon

  Once upon a time a man with a pull,
who also owned a saloon, tried to have
Brone enjoined from maintaining a nui-
sance  for the man with a pull desired to
monopolize local patronage Later, his
rival failed to close Brone’s place, and,
rightly or wrongly, the little German at-
tributed the defeat of his foe to Leigh,
and Leigh alone  for Leigh had made a
funny story of the affair So he took
occasion to try and prove his gratitude in
many and divers ways

  The reporter, remembering all this,
followed his man until the latter turned
into a side-street “ Hallo, Brone! ” he
cried “ How goes it ”

  “ Meester Leigh,” responded Brone,
his plump, shining little face crimsoning
with pleasure “ Ach Hi mint',, how I am
pleased you to see! Come my place in,
we trink glass of beer Oh, yes!” lay-
ing a restraining hand on the other’s coat-
sleeve “ You come must”

  Leigh nodded  the saloon was reached :
nobody else was there except the tailor
who lived next door, and who was asleep
on a chair in a corner Mrs Brone, the
counterpart of her husband in face and
figure, greeted Leigh heartily

  “Vos you the meeting at to-night”
asked Brone, after some general chat
Leigh had been leading up to the ques-
tion

  11	No” replied the reporter, “ T couldn’t
get up” which was true : adding, with a
yawn: “Anything interesting”

  “ Eenteresting! ” cried Brone “ I pet
vou ! Some of the newspaper poys vos
dere I see ’em Dey’ll put lots der pa-
pers in”

  “ Perhaps so,” replied Leigh “ but
what was it all about” He half rose as
if to go

  “ Seet down,” insisted his host “ Thees
is fine peece news You vait Lena, more
beer  fine news, yes! ”

  With very little prompting, Brone then
told how the meeting was really of a semi-
executive sort—at all events, the door-
keepers had instructions to bar all per-
sons but members and “ those invited”
Leigh smiled to himself at this, know-

ing the wherefore of the order That a
Home Rule Association had been organ-
ized to the end of checking “ attempts at
meddlesome interference on the part of
the Legislature in regard to matters that
had to do with local interests, which in-
terests were best administered by persons
conversant with them ”  that several of
the Martport party leaders were present
and made speeches denunciatory of the
attack on Burke  and that, finally, a reso-
lution had been passed to the effect that
a bill be introduced at an early date, by
one of the Highburg assemblymen, call-
ing for an investigation of the motives
and certain of the official methods of the
inaugurators of the Board of Trade move-
ment

  Leigh took but few notes He had the
tenacious memory of the trained reporter,
and he excused himself as soon as pos-
sible after wringing Brone dry Then
he hastened to tlie office, where he found
Allen awaiting him

  Allen looked a trifle worried “ I feel
it in my bones,” he said, ‘•‘-that there’s
something doing to-night that we’ve been
shut out of”

  “ Why ” asked Leigh

  The other shrugged his shoulders help-
lessly “ I don’t know why I feel it in
my bones”

  “Your bones didn’t fib, Jimmie,” re-
plied Leigh, and he told him of the meet-
ing of the Franchise Club

  “ That explains,” said Allen “ I ran
up against Jennison about half an hour
ago, and his little green eyes looked mis-
chief as I passed ‘ Good night,’ said I

‘ Good night,’ said he, 1 and pleasant
dreams to you,’ and then he grinned Evi-
dently he was reveling in the thought of
how joyous we’d feel when we read the
combine’s  scoop ’ to-morrow”

  “ Get anything out of the district  ”
asked Leigh

  Allen handed over the scant notes that
represented his evening’s labor, and both
men then fell to work Leigh finished
first

  “ Eleven o’clock,” he said, glancing at
his watch “ Senator Clives is stopping
at the Bay View House : he goes to bed
early, as I know, and so I feel pretty sure
that I’ll run him to earth there I’ll also
see Moriarty, the Board of Trade presi-
dent And Jimmie, if you don’t mind

breaking up the beauty sleep of Halpin,
the legal adviser to the Board of Trade,
and one or two others who are interested
in the matter, we’ll put a sting in the tail
of this story that’ll make the combine look
pale”

  Both reporters were lucky in meeting
the men -they sought

  At about one o’clock in the morning
they went to a near-by restaurant On
the way thither they met Burke “ Any-
thing to tell us ” Leigh asked blandly of
the politician

  “ Nothing to tell you’ was the reply

  “ My bones aren’t quite easy yet,” said
Allen as they were on the way back to the
office

  “ I think we’d better make a tour of the
rounds once more,” said Leigh

  Allen consulted his watch “ It’s rather
late for that Anyhow, let’s ask ‘ Cen-
tral ’ if anybody has rung us up”

  Somebody had, but “ Central ” didn’t
know who The men looked at each other
vexedly

  “ I’ll try the Sentinel office and police
headquarters,” said Leigh The calls
proved fruitless, however “ Now let me
see if it was the Clarion people,” remarked
Allen, holding out his hand for the re-
ceiver

  Just then came the sound of heavy foot-
steps on the stairs outside

  “ A late visitor,” muttered Leigh

  Allen threw open the office door
There stood Ahearne

  “Hallo, Pat!” cried Leigh “ Glad
to see you! Come in you know Mr
Allen ”

  “ Oi do, sor,” replied the officer “ an’
yez hev a snug place uv it here”

  “ Yes,” said Leigh “ and welcome for

  “ How are things, Pat” asked Leigh

  “ Purty an' well But av either uv yez

  Allen glanced at Leigh as much as to
say, “ I told you so”

  “ Mr Allen has,” replied Leigh

  “ Did he get the story about 1 Father

  “No,” said Allen “What was it”

  “And Maloney was at the '‘desk’”
said Leigh

  “ Yis”

  “ So you thought that we might slip up

went on Leigh, looking at the big Irish-
man with friendly eves

  Ahearne smiled in affirmation “ Ma-

 A Few Hard Nuts of the Early Spring Variety to Loosen
 Up the Mental Machinery of Our Mathematicians

       LD HASELTINE, of Richmond, Indiana, contributes the following:

        •	A siding holds three cuts, or sixty cars An engineer hauling a train
        of twenty cars conies to this siding, and wishes to take the middle twenty
        cars and place the twenty cars he is hauling in the place of the twenty cars
        he takes out leaving the end sections in the same position he found them

            The engine can only handle twenty cars at a time no drop, staking,
        or roping to be done

           Can this be done If so, show how many moves

            W A Hickey, of Chicago, obliges us with the following:

            Given two intersecting railroad lines, a west-bound and north-bound
        train, each four hundred and forty feet long Each train starts at the same
        time from a point one hundred miles from the intersection The north-
        bound train runs at a speed of fortv-cight miles per hour At what speed
        must the west-bound train run to reach and clear the crossing at the
        moment that the locomotive of the north-bound train touches that point

             The answer to these puzzles will appear in our May issue

 Answer to March Puzzle

        thirty miles an hour when he made the jump, and thirty miles an hour when

      Side-Talks With the Man Who Sits in the Cab of
      the Magazine and Is Commonly Called an Editor

THE monorail is all very well as a valu-
able asset of the Sunday newspaper,
and maybe when they're through tinkering
around a bit they’ll get something that might
be useful But, for ourselves, we like to
feel all the ten wheels of our engine spanning
the standard gage track and whirling along
without depending on any spinning top to
keep us right side up

  That's why we don't try any freak motive
power or rolling stock in the make-up of our
monthly train We know what our readers
want, and the only difference month by-
month is caused by the effort to get a higher
polish on the coach-trimmings of a higher
steam-pressure in the gage

  Of course, improvements are all right,
and we don’t intend to miss any chances in
that direction, blit the things that we put on
must have passed all the safety-appliance
tests ever formulated by a government of
critical readers It is through this method
that we are able, month by month, to promise
for the following month a magazine keyed
to as high or higher pitch as the one being
turned out

  In fact, for May we have had to get a
new steam-indicator put in the cab for we
couldn't register the pressure without bust-
ing the old one This is particularly true in
the matter of fiction

  We don't think we ever had quite such a
collection of authors in one issue as we shall
have in the May number J R Stafford
Frank Condon, Robert T Creel, Robert F
Hoffmann, F H Richardson, and Augustus
Wittfeld make a train-crew that any fast-
flying limited could be proud of

  Mr Stafford's story is about a refreshing
Irishman whose cool impudence is as uncon-
scious as his natural capability is great Mr
Hoffmann’s story will probably be called
“ Bill Daidy’s Chapter” and you'll agree that
it is one of the most unusual chapters ever
written by a railroad man In its way it is
as refreshing as Mr Stafford's Irishman

  Mr Wittfeld is as funny as ever, which is
saying something hard to believe

  Besides these stories, we have others equal-
ly good, but we fear to mention more, be-
cause if in the excitement of making up the

train one or two cars got switched, we don’t
like to feel responsible for too many disap-
pointments

  In the special articles we have the very
sad announcement to make that the May
number will see brought to a close “The
Evolution of Almost,” by Horace Herr We
consider this sketch to have been a distinct
“ find”

  There is in newspaper parlance a much-
abused phrase, namely, “ human interest
If the writers of some of these human in-
terest stories would read “ The Evolution
of Almost, we think they would quit out of
shame

  We don't remember reading in a long time
of so distinctly human and lovable a charac-
ter as “ Almost He is the male Mrs Wiggs,
and we all feel better, in a very real sense of
the word, for having made his acquaintance
He is an addition to railroad literature

  Other features among the special articles
for the May number will be number six of
the “ Letters of an Old Railroad Man and
His Son a series that has taken particularly
well the always delightful “Observations
of a Country Station-Agent ” No 2 of Mr
Rogers’s articles on the shops, entitled  Rail-
road Machines” commercial traveler yarns
told in the smoker, “Old-Timer Tales,” and
maybe an instructive article on the story of
railroad trade-marks

  We have in mind several other fine, high-
class pieces of equipment, but we don't want
to put 011 so much fuel here that we’ll have
to spend the rest of the month hauling out
the clinkers, so we guess we'll take the high-
ball and get out of town

Fireman M L Curtice in the engine, over-
took and crushed the caboose and two rear
cars of the freight, derailing and partially
overturning the engine of the mail-train,
according to reports received

  The cause of the wreck, as given by these
reports, was the failure of Mr Reynolds to
observe, soon enough, a signal set against
the mail, while he was busy trying to reseat
an injector check-valve, on the fireman’s side
of the engine, which had stuck while open

  The need of this repair was urgent It
was a fast and heavy train The water was
rapidly lowering in the boiler and blowing-
back into the tank

  This is by no means the first time that an
engineer’s natural anxiety for the proper
working of the injectors, upon which his
own life, and the lives of others, largely
depend while running fast, has led to disas-
ter And greatly as it is to be hoped, this
will not be the last time that such a thing
will happen

  We have no intention of entering upon a
discussion of the merits or demerits of this
occurrence We are quite willing to leave
that to the able disciplinarians and arm-chair
philosophers whose duty or vagrant incli-
nations lead them to do it so willingly At
the same time we would request these
lay-philosophers to be careful in pitting their
knowledge of the chances and complex du-
ties of an engineer against that of the engi-
neer himself

  What we have chiefly in mind is the broad,
human aspect of this unfortunate event, and
the unusual circumstances which attended
it

 In The Railroad Man’s Magazine for
September, 1907, we printed a story under
the title, “A Modern Mazeppa” There is in
that story of wreck and anguish a paragraph
that met a quick response in the hearts of
experienced railroad men We have reason
to believe that it carried well its message
of finality, fellowship, and implied conso-
lation to many of our readers who are best
able to appreciate its healing and sober
truth

  Just now it seems to epitomize the thing
we wish to say, and to send forth anew a
human note broad and deep enough to meet
the need of almost any sorrow that, through
mishap, may come to a railroad man and his
family

  The paragraph, supposedly spoken by a
wounded engineer, is as follows:

  “ You see,” he continued, when he had re-
gained control of himself, “there is so much
to remember and to do In most of the af-
fairs of life, mistakes can be corrected—a
little lapse of thought, a little extra weari-
ness, a little error of judgment, a little thing

undone But with us it is final and complete
There is 110 recall 110 sufficient extenuation”

  That is it There is no recall for the ap-
parently little thing undone, as in the com-
mon, daily derelictions of life Instead,
there are sometimes the irreparable loss of
life, the maiming and bruising of crews, and,
as in the accident west of Toledo, the added
pathos of a lifetime’s splendid work marred
by one fell stroke at its close

  Picture a man, courageous, kindly, soft-
voiced, instinctively a gentleman—in short,
the highest type of locomotive engineer—in
whose mind the welfare of his fellow work-
ers and the passengers entrusted to hig care
are ever uppermost

  For forty-one years, two and one-half
years of which are spent in firing, he runs
consecutively at the head of his train, build-
ing up a well-nigh perfect record, and look-
ing ahead to that half-dreaded yet much de-
sired honorable retirement to which every
engineer now aspires

  At the end of this more than average span
of a working life filled with tense activities,
calling out the utmost from every faculty,
he has arrived, with hair long since whi-
tened hy the strain, at the seventy-year mile-
post of his life

  If we assume that he has run his trip of
say one hundred miles a day for only two
out of each three days that have gone with
the years, he will have run a million miles
or more through that which seems to the
wayfaring man a fierce and menacing wilder-
ness of sights and sounds Forty times the
distance around the earth at the equator
One hundred and twenty-five times the dis-
tance through it there One ninety fifth of
the distance from earth to sun !

  And if for somewhat more than twenty
years of this time he has pulled a passenger-
train, he will have led some million or so
6f humans upon their hurrying ways safely
through that wilderness of menacing sights
and sounds, 'not one in a thousand of whom
has ever so much as seen him, much less
touched his hand or acknowledged him a
leader among men

  This, in effect, is the almost matchless
record of A G Reynolds, engineer of the
mail, up to January 31, when he stood in the
Toledo station just before starting on his run
home to Elkhart, Indiana, with his pension
papers in his pocket, retiring him for age
at the end of this particular run

  Less than fifteen miles out of Toledo,
his engine was ditched There was death and
suffering for his fellows and himself, his
spotless record was gone like a breath of
vapor blown from his cab-window, and his
well-earned retirement upon pension was in
doubt
ON THE EDITORIAL CARPET	K7:

  Unnumbered generations of men have
read the story of leadership, of courage, of
momentary human weakness overmastered
by unflagging zeal for duty, which sustained
Moses through forty years of striving
through the wilderness toward Canaan

  They have read of the one thing undone—
the one failure to observe the detail of the
spoken law when common human needs
were sorely pressing

   And now that time has truthfully revealed
the great Iaw-giver in the long perspective
of its passing, the thing that lives in the big,
human consciousness is the aching, gripping
tragedy of the indomitable leader, ripe in
years and honor, trudging courageously to
the mountain-top of his ambition, only to
look over into the Land of Promise which
he might not enter

   Something of this feeling, we believe, will
attach to the consideration of the deplorable
accident in point, especially among those
who best understand the possibility of such
happenings in the ordinary course

   At the time of this writing, there is some
doubt being expressed as to the eligibility of
an engineer to pension for age under the
circumstances above recited There is, how-
ever, an additional fact which may be con-
strued in favor of Mr Reynolds

   It is that he had reached the age-limit of
seventy years on the day before the accident,
and was it is said, finishing out the month of
January with one last return run to his home
station, at his own request, and, of course,
with the consent of his superior in authority

   All in all, therefore, we believe we express
the sentiment of many railroad men and
others, in hoping that, long before this ap-
pears in print, this veteran engineer who was
treated so shabbily by Fate in the very last
hours of his great work may have been
honorably enrolled among the pensioned vet-
erans and that his hurts of body and
thought may, with those of the others who
likewise suffer, be well upon the way of
healing

  ' “MOTHER’S SIGNAL”

ALBERT CAIN, an old reader of this

•	magazine, has sent us from his home
in Cochran, Indiana, the words of the fol-
lowing poem, “ Mother’s Signal, which is
commemorative of John Little, who lost his
life in a wreck at Cochran, July 30, 1894, 011
the B and O S W

John Little was an engineer,

Careful, skilful, without fear

A widowed mother was his care
And everything he had to share
With her was shared in equal part,

For John loved her with all his heart

Each day John Little’s train went through
His  Mother’s Signal,” Little blew

And all our town this signal knew,

And well we learned to love it, too

His train was always run 011 time,

His love for mother was sublime

And whether passing east or west
He signaled her whom he loved best

 At first this signal, loud and shrill

Pierced every one with noisesome thrill

But after while our whole town knew,

What meant the signal Little blew

And loved to hear his engine’s cry
Each day as Little’s train flew by

So reg’lar Little’s train went ’long,

Your watch, with it, could not be wrong

And thus for years this engineer,

Careful, skilful, without fear,

Went running through, now east, then west—
On all the road he was the best—

And when his mother’s town he passed,

John Little blew his loyal blast,

And all the town, as he flew by

Rejoiced to hear his engine cry
His signal sweet to mother’s ear

And more we loved it, year by year

’Twas music sweet to ev’ry ear,

And sweeter it grew ev’ry year—

Because it told of filial love,

Most certain of reward above

At last there came a fatal day

And Little’s spirit passed away!

And nevermore within her town
Is Little's mother’s signal blown

On open switch a freight-train lay,

And John’s train had the right of way
Whose fault Not his! But in a flash
There came an awful—awful crash
And wreck such as is seldom known—

And noble Little’s soul had flown

There, underneath his engine bound,

John Little's body, crushed, was found,

The whistle-valve his hand held fast

One moment more, as he flew past

His mother’s home, his signal-call

Would have cheered her and thrilled us all

And Little’s mother, scarce a mile

Away was waiting with a smile

To hear her boy blow her his love

When Little’s spirit soared above

His face glowed with a heavenly light,

But Little's soul had taken flight

Now nevermore that signal will
Echoes wake from hill to hill

But Lord ! Our God ! Father in heaven !

If he had sins be they forgiven !

For faithfulness like his—and love—

Must surely find reward above

576	THE RAILROAD MAN’S MAGAZINE

 And mocked al God in your hellish pride
 You've paid full fare, so I carry you through
 For ii is only right that you get your due,
 For every laborer is worth his hire,

 So I land you safe in my lake of fire,

 W here my fiery imps will torment you for-
    ever

 And all in vain you will sigh for a Savior”
 Then Tom awoke with an awful cry

 His clothes soaked wet and his hair stand-
    ing high

 And he prayed as he had never prayed before
 To be saved from hell and the devil’s power
 And his crying and praying was not in vain
 For he never more rode on the hell-bound
 train

 TELL ME NOT!

 Teli me not in box-car numbers
 Life is but an empty dream

 If you're working for a railroad

 Oh, how happy life must seem!

 Life is business on a railroad,

 Where you have to do things right

 Do just what the yardmaster tells you,
    Labor hard from morn till night

 Lives of railroad men remind us
    We must never be sublime,

 But when going leave behind us
    Garnishes upon our time

 Garnishes which perhaps some other
    Wandering on this stormy main—

 Some forlorn and wayward brother—
    Seeing shall pass 011 again

 When our working days are over,

 And our harvest days are spent,

 With our shoes all worn and dusty,
    With our backs all tired and bent

 We shall near the gates of heaven,

    But inside we'll never get,

 For St Peter there will tell us,

    “ We’ve 110 railroad men here yet”

   LIFE'S RAILWAY TO HEAVEN

 BY CHARLIE D TILLMAN

 (Copyrighted, 1910 by Charlie D Tillman)

 Life is like a mountain railroad,

 With an engineer that's brave

 We must make the run successful
    From the cradle to the grave

 Watch the curves, the fills, the tunnels,
     Never falter, never quail

 Keep your hand upon the throttle,

 And your eye upon the rail

 Chorus

 Blessed Savior, Thou wilt guide us
    Till we reach that blissful shore,

 Where the angels wait to join us,

 In Thy praise forevermore

  You will roll up grades of trial

  You will cross the bridge of strife

  See that Christ is your conductor,

  On this lightning train of life

  Always mindful of obstruction

  Do your duty, never fail

  Keep your hand upon the throttle,

  And your eye upon the rail

  Repeat Chorus

  You will always find obstructions,

  Look for storms of wind and rain,

  On a fill, or curve, or trestle,

  They will almost ditch your train

  Put your trust alone in Jesus,

  Never falter, never fail

  Keep your hand upon the throttle,

  And your eye upon the rail

  Repeat Chorus

  As you roll across the trestle

  Spanning death’s dark swelling tide,

  You behold the union depot,

Into which your train will glide

  There you’ll meet the Superintendent,
  God the Father—God, the Son,

  With the hearty, joyous plaudit,

  “ Weary pilgrim, welcome home! ”

  Repeat Chorus

MY DAD'S THE ENGINEER

BY CHARLES GRAHAM

(Copyright, 1905, by Henry J Weliman All
rights reserved)

  We were none of us thinking of danger,

  As the train sped 011 in the night,

  ’Till the flames from a burning forest
  Made the passengers wild with fright

  Then a tiny maid near a window, with a
      smile, said:

  There's nothing to fear

I'm sure t'-iat 110 harm will befall you—

  My dad's the engineer”

  Retrain

“ Daddy's 011 the engine, don't be afraid

  Daddy knows what he is doing, said the
      little maid

  “ We'll soon be out of danger, don’t you ever
       fear

  Every one is safe, because my Dad's the
      engineer”

  With the sparks falling closely about us,
  Through the flames we sped 011 so fast,

  And the brave little maid’s father

  Brought us through the danger all safe at
      last

  And the proud, sweet face of his lassie,

And the words of the calm, little dear,

  Will live iti my mem'ry forever—

  “ My dad's the engineer”

Little Giant Cleaner

On 30 Days Trial

        Convert 11
        Dirt and
        Dust Into
        Gold Dollars

   00

 A Ijittle Giant Cleaner should pay for itself
 in less than two months, out of the profits of the
 business after paying: help and all expenses

          It is capable of earning $25000 to $30000 clear
          profit a month and we cannot see where there is
          a possible chance for anyone that buys a machine to
          fail to make big money, but every reason why they
          should make thousands of dollars

Give Us a Chance to Help You

       You can make $2500 to $3000 a year on each machine It advertises itself

       and orders for work come pouring in so you should be busy all the time

           The Little Giant House Cleaner is proving one of the greatest money-makers ever
        put on the market If you are willing to hustle you can easily make $2,500 to $3,000 a year
        on each machine you own Make a start to-day and you will never regret it As soon as
        you earn money enough and have one machine paid for, buy another, hire other men and
        let them make $10 or $15 a day for you Getting one of these machines and hiring a
        man to run it, beats working for a living to a standstill Be “Johnny on the Spot”
        with a machine and get the cream of the business If you can get a number of these
        machines working,they should make you rich We believe there never has been a
        machine placed on the market that has so pleased everybody, met with such immediate
        success, and made so much money as the house cleaning machine

A Perfect Wonder

             The Little Giant reaches every crack, corner and
         crevice of the floor the cracks in the wall, the ceiling
         and mouldings It cleans and renovates bedding, com-
         forts, blankets, mattresses and pillows the cracks or
         crevices in wooden and iron beds: even the dust, fuzz and
         other accumulation in tightly coiled woven-wire springs

              It consists of a powerful gasoline engine, a double
          acting suction air pump, a vacuum condenser, cold water
          tank, electric spark battery, vacuum gauge, high-pressure
          suction hose, observation glass and cleaning tools—all
          properly connected so as to work in unison and give the
          desired results The whole is erected on a substantial
          four-wheel wagon, to be drawn by hand, so that it can be
          moved from place to place

   Nothing to Compare With It

  There are several small machines on the market for home
use to be worked either by hand or a small water or electric
motor, but they have never been a success because they do
not have power enough to clean with, although they will
draw the top dust from the room The Little Giant
Cleaner does the same work in the same way as the large
machines costing from $2,000 to $7,000 each It has the
same size hose

  We have seen it pull out pail after pail of dirt from
houses—dirt that was impossible to remove completely by
the ordinary means of beating, etc When it is working
on the streets, the dirt and filth pouring through the obser-
vation glass attracts a crowd of people that look with
wonder They would not believe it possible

   Our Liberal Offer —Pay for it Out of Your Profits

      We want you to investigate this exceptional opportunity We do not believe
      there is any business where so small an investment will bring such wonderful returns,
      because right here in Toledo we have proved this by our own actual experience
      We have such implicit confidence in the wonderful money-making powers of tho Little
      Giant llouae Cleaner—that we will ship one to any live man who is honest and
      willing to work, on 80 Day’ Trial—upon such liberal terms that it is next to impos-
      sible to lose We will even go further and allow you to pay for It in liiHtallnicnt,
      and in such a way that your profit should easily tako caro of your payments

  In our illustrated book we give full particulars as to how to organize your business
  solicit orders, what to charge for tho work and how to turn every minute of vour tine iuto
  money We will send it to you free Every ambitious man who lias any “get-up” in
  him should write at once for this book A postage stamp will bring it to you and it
  will show you how you can become independent and ono of tho prosperous men
  in your community

new IVER JOHNSON

 Safety Automatic Revolver

'T'HE famous
, home defender
whose safety feature
is an inbuilt, integral
part of its mechanism, has
been brought to the highest
perfection yet achieved in a
revolver

  In this latest model of the
famous “Hammer tlie Hammer”
revolver, improvements have
been made which add immeasur-
ably to smoothness of action,
certainty of fire, and durability
of mechanism in a small arm

  Every spring in the New Iver
Johnson Revolver is made of fin-
est piano wire, drawn tempered,
replacing the old Hat springs
Coil springs are insisted upon by
the United States Government in
its rifles wherever possible Note
these coil springs in the “ghost
picture” above

  The flat, or “kick” spring of
old type revolvers is always at
greatest tension at one point, and
after long use fatigue attacks the
metal at that point and the spring
weakens or breaks down

  In the coil springs of the Iver

Johnson revolver tension is sus-
tained equally throughout every
point of the coil There is no
one point to weaken under use
and finally break down—and leave
you defenseless in a moment
when possibly life depends upon
action It is positive, trust-
worthy and practically good for
the life of the revolver itself

  The Iver Johnson is the first
and only revolver equipped with
this type of spring at every pos-
sible point It is positively the
highest type of small arm ever
made And while fitted to work
as smooth as velvet,'the action of
the Iver Johnson is simple, strong
and dependable for a lifetime

  The safety action of the Iver
Johnson Revolver is as impossible
to improve upon as it is impossi-
ble to imitate and has therefore

undergone no
change It is
the same safe
and sound
■’Hammer the

Hammer” It safeguards you
from accident without your hav-
ing to remember any directions
how to use, to push a slide or
press a button when you want to
shoot—say in an emergency It
is always ready to shoot, in-
stantly, accurately and hard

  The accurate, splendid shoot-
ing qualities and high penetration
of the Iver Johnson are unsur-
passed because the barrel (drop
forged from the finest steel made
for the purpose) is rifled as accu-
rately as in revolvers that cost
several times as much The
bullet flies fast and true The Iver
Johnson is in a class all its own

Our Booklet, “Shots,” mailed FREE with catalogue, explains the superior
features of our revolvers, including the new models:

 them and plans for the
 same

              The elite Watch for critical users an acctcrate timer
              jewelled with seven jewels and beautifully cased

The INGERSOLL-TRENTON solves the watch-problem for the
man who wants to be told the exact time by a handsome and
honestly-built watch which he can buy at a moderate price

Every Ingersoll-Trenton watch is enclosed in an
original Ingersoll-Trenton case and time-tested at
the factory before shipment watch, case and time-
keeping—all three—are guaranteed by the same
maker This fact is of the utmost importance
to the buyer and is the only instance oi the kind
in the history of watchmaking

The Ingersoll-Trenton rivals in accuracy any
other high-grade watch It is sold by 6,000 re-
sponsible jewelers at a factory-fixed price which
pleases the purchaser and puzzles other watch-
makers who make their product in smaller quan-
tities, employ expensive and (sometimes) un-
scrupulous selling-methods, and are obliged there-
by to make the watch-buyer pay unnecessary and
fictitious prices

Here are the Ingersoll-Trenton prices:

nr rk“'d ■

case

 in 10-year
 gold-filled

 in 20-year
 gold-filled

    Each watch fitted at Friction-points with seven ruby, sapphire and garnet
    jewels The popularity of the Ingersoll-Trenton is sweeping the country

The Widely-known	Models

The famous Ingersoll Dollar Watch (together with the other Ingersoll models at
$150 and $2) has turned the watch-world upside-down and made millions of people
carry watches who never carried them before More than seventeen millions of
these watches have been sold Twelve thousand are now being sold every day
in the week 60,000 Dealers sell them

    Ingersoll watches tick everywhere—tick truly and tell time Ask any-
    where for an Ingersoll the dealer will know exactly what you mean

      We have published a little book, bound in an embossed cover It contains five facts worth five
      dollars to anyone who is ever going to buy another watch The title of this book is How to Judge
      a Watch1  What is your address We would like to send you a copy with our compliments
