South Seas Novelet

THE Outer Islands Trading Com-
pany’s lugger worked in through
the reef, pulling hard against the
rush of the tide. For a little way the
sea was like a mill race; then, as the
channel widened, the lagoon of Tana-
wai opened in placid blue enchantment.
Gulls circled it lazily. Pelicans skipped
with awkward flappings toward the
green banners of the beach.

  Skipper Bill stood beside Dave

Weston at the rail. “A touch-and-go
run in through here,” he complained;
“and—what burns me up—it never
does any good.”

 “You mean you never get any
cargo?” Dave said.

  “Not a pinch !” scowled Skipper Bill.
“Still, long as we got a company sta-
tion here, reckon I’ll have to call in
every trip.”

  “It’ll be different from now on,”
Dave Weston promised him. He had
the confidence of youth and was deter-
mined to make good on Tanawai
Island. Outer Islands Trading Com-
            Copra

                   By ALLAN VAUGHAN ELSTON

Author of “The Howling Wilderness”

pany, Ltd., expected him to make good,
and so did Sylvia Farrel.

  Skipper Bill shrugged gloomily.
“Todd Welsh had the same idear,
young feller, when he come here a year
ago. And what happened? He made a
rum failure, same as the agents afore
him did. Now here you are in his place.’'
“Maybe the competing station offers
better trade goods,”' suggested Dave.

  “It ain’t that,” Bill protested with
conviction. “It’s Logan Brothers’ agent,
‘Red’ Ryan. He’s got a winning way
with the natives. It’s a gift, son, this
trading calico for copra.”

  The leaning palms on the shore were
close now. Dave could see grass roofs
gleaming through them, with a fine
sweep of greenery beyond. Bright spots
of color on the beach were the tunics
of natives assembled there. A chatter
of welcome reached Dave. Then canoes
shot toward the lugger, swarming
alongside as she dropped anchor in nine
fathoms.

  Most of the welcomers were boys—
swarthy, clean-limbed youngsters of
pure Polynesian strain. A few were
girls with large dark eyes, languid and
long-lashed. One of these called gayly
4

ARGOSY

to Dave, “You like maybe come
shore ?”

  Dave laughed. “Do they all speak
that good English ?” he asked Skipper
Bill.

  “The run of ’em don’t savvy ten
words,” Bill said. “But a few of these
youngsters took a turn at the mission
school.”

  Dave looked down at the one who
had called to him. She wore pink satin
over a lace petticoat. A leghorn hat
trimmed with shells was perched co-
quettishly on masses of black hair. Her
smile flashed boldly. “You like come
ashore my boat?” she repeated.

  “Give her a play,” Skipper Bill ad-
vised slyly. “These are supposed to be
your customers, so you might as well
start making friends.”

  “Believe I’d rather take a chance
with that one,” grinned Dave. He in-
dicated another girl in the background.
This one was younger and by contrast
shy.

  Skipper Bill chuckled. “You’re not
a bad picker, son. That’s Samona,
purty as ever, like sunlight through a
fog.” He raised his voice. “Come
alongside, Samona, and meet our new
agent.”

THE shy girl, both embarrassed
and delighted, paddled her canoe
to the lugger’s side.

  Dave smiled down at her. “I’m Dave
Weston,” he said, “and I hope we’ll
be friends.”

  “We shall make happy friend,” she
promised. She was slim and gracious,
and her soft, cordial voice was like a
velvet touch. In a scarlet tunic, with a
wreath of hybiscus in her hair, she
made an alluring picture against the
blue of the lagoon.

  “Skipper him to the beach. Sam-
ona,” boomed Bill. “I'll be along in the

shore boat with all his luggage.”
Samona was the envy of her com-
panions as Dave lowered his long,
white-clad frame into her canoe. In a
moment they were skimming toward
the beach.

   “You stay long time?” the girl asked
hopefully.

  She seemed so ingenuous that Dave
saw a chance to get first hand and
sincere information. He was eager to
come to grips with his job, and first of
all he wanted to find out why his pre-
decessors had failed on Tanawai Island.
Why did the Tanawains take all their
copra to the other agent, Red Ryan ?

  “My company is taking Mr. Welsh
away because your people haven’t
traded with him,” he said. “Don’t they
like him?”

  “Oh, yes,” she said quickly. “Mr.
Welsh very nice man.”

  “Then why don’t they take him
copra?”

  A shadow crossed her face. “Because
our head men say it is tabu.”

  Dave frowned. He knew that in-
numerable tabus, many of them found-
ed on superstition rather than reason,
had always shackled the Polynesian
peoples. “That seems stupid, Samona,”
he protested. “You don’t believe in a
tabu like that, do you?”

  She shook her head vigorously. “No,

I	think they are not good,” she said.
Then she added shyly, “I have like
tabus of your people best.”

  This mystified him. “What are the
tabus of my people?” he asked.

  She seemed surprised that he didn’t
know them. “The good priest have be
here long time,” she said. “He have die
now. But he teach me the ten tabus of
your people.”

   Dave still was puzzled.

  “He are make me good Catholic,”
she explained simply, and looked quick-
COPRA

5

ly to see if he approved die idea.

  Then, with a shock of humility, he
understood what she meant by the ten
tabus of his people. It made him look
at her writh a new interest. She was
little more than a child, he realized,
and breathlessly beautiful. Her face
was a perfect brown oval, the features
straight and delicate, her body slim,
supple, round. She was fragrant and
fresh, like rain on the desert. But what
most astonished and impressed Dave
Weston was a faith which believed only
in those tabus once inscribed by Moses
on tablets of stone.

   “I guess you’ve got the right slant
on this tabu business, Samona,” Dave
said as the keel of the canoe grounded
on the beach.

  Dave stepped ashore and was imme-
diately surrounded by cordial natives.
Samona kept close to him and explained
to her people that his name was Dave,
and that he was her happy friend.

  The lugger’s shore boat arrived and
Skipper Bill’s voice broke in gruffly,
“Can’t understand why Todd Welsh
ain’t here to meet us.”

  “Is that our station?” Dave asked,
pointing down the beach to a low,
rambling structure with a grass roof.

   “No, that’s the Logan Brothers’ lay-
out,” Bill said. “Red Ryan hangs out
there. Sharp as a shark’s tooth, that
feller. He’ll bear watchin’.”

   To the left Bill indicated the com-
pany station, which was entirely of
sheet iron badly in need of paint. Ex-
cept for wide verandas on four sides
and a generous shade of cocoanut
palms, the place struck Dave as rather
desolate.

   “Up there on the hill is where Gren-
ner lives. He’s resident governor here,
and what he says goes.” Bill thumbed
toward a white bungalow on a distant
eminence. It ’ was nested in flowering

shrubs, with a bower of ferns flanking
well-kept terraces.

  Three Kanaka sailors from the lug-
ger were now at hand with Dave’s lug-
gage. They followed with it as Dave
and Skipper Bill walked briskly toward
the Outer Islands Company store.

   The door of the place was open, its
screen hanging on one hinge. On a
veranda table stood a half empty beer
bottle with flies buzzing about it. As
he entered the store Dave saw no sign
of life other than cockroaches swarm-
ing on the counters. The shelves,
though covered with dust, were well
stocked. Twist tobacco, bolts of cotton
cloth, tins of coal oil, knives, beads,
tools, canned meats.

  “Ahoy Welsh, look alive!” bawled
Skipper Bill. There was no answer.

   Bill took a look into the copra room.
“Same old story,” he reported. “Not a
sack o’ cargo on hand.”

  It was fairly clear that Welsh had
made few if any trades since Bill’s last
call. “He’s probably out in the jungle
shootin’ pigs,” growled Bill.

   But when they went into living quar-
ters at the rear, a shock transfixed them.
Agent Welsh lay in bed with a copra
knife protruding from his back. The
sight paralyzed Dave and even the
wind-bitten face of Skipper Bill went
bloodless.

  After a moment of staring, they
backed from the room. “Come along,
son,” Bill said hoarsely. “We gotta re-
port this to the gov’nor.”

II

RESIDENT Grenner was drinking
in his office with Red Ryan when
Bill and Dave burst in on them. Hugh
Grenner was a ruddy New Zealander,
shiny bald and round at the waist.

“I’ve got news!” blurted Skipper
6

ARGOSY

Bill. “Somebody stuck a knife in Todd
Welsh.”

  Grenner blinked small pale eyes at
Bill. Then he stared askance at Dave
Weston. Dave explained, “I was sent
from the Papeete office to relieve
Welsh. We found him murdered.”

  “With a knife,” repeated Bill.

  Ryan reached for his glass and
drained it with a gulp. Over the glass
his hard, frosty eyes met Dave’s. The
Logan Brothers’ agent was a huge,
barrel-chested man with a shock of
flaming hair. His shirt was open and
Dave could see that a winged dragon
was tattooed on his chest. Ryan’s gaze
shifted from Dave to Bill. “What kind
of a knife?” he asked.

  “A copra knife,” Bill said.

  Ryan grimaced knowingly. “That
makes it simple,” he said to Grenner.
“Welsh must’ve been philanderin’ with
some of the local belles and gotten
caught at it.”

  Grenner nodded. “It’s happened to
many a white man in these islands,”
the resident said smugly. Grunting, he
rose from his chair and they all went
down to the Outer Islands station to
review the evidence.

  Except for that copra knife, no clew
whatever was found. A crowd of curi-
ous, half-frightened natives had as-
sembled in front of the store and Gren-
ner held impromptu court on the
veranda, barking out innumerable and
futile questions.

  “We might ask Stoney about it,”
Grenner said finally. “He generally
knows what’s going on around here.
Send for Stoney.”

  “Who’s Stoney?” Dave asked Skip-
per Bill.

  “He’s a down-and-out Britisher,”
Bill explained. “When he beached here
fifteen year ago he came into this
store and said, ‘I’m stoney broke,

brother. Wot about a dram on the
cuff?’ The agent then was a half-caste
who didn’t savvy much English. He
stood the drink and charged a shilling
on the books against Mr. Stoney Broke.
So they called him that ever since.”
When Stoney slouched into view,
Dave saw as disreputable a derelict as
ever dug clams on a southern beach.

  “I just ’eard abort it, gov’nor,”
Stoney bleated. “Poor old Welshy!
Ain’t it ’eil the wiy things ’appen?”
“When did you last see him alive?”
Grenner demanded.

  “Larst night abort sundown, gov’-
nor. ’E stood me a drop o’ bitters—
best pal I ever ’ad, ’e was.” Rheumy
tears came to the beachcomber’s eyes.

  “Very well,” Grenner announced
with a shrug. “I’ll make a report to
my government superiors. And rest as-
sured I’ll find the criminal.”

RENNER’S investigation struck
Dave as a farce. It consisted
mainly of heckling natives with ques-
tions as to what Tanawain women
Welsh had paid attentions. Nothing
came of it. Todd Welsh was buried
under a breadfruit tree with the guilt
of his murder unsolved.

   Skipper Bill steamed away in his lug-
ger. Dave remained forlornly alone in
a store to which customers never'came.

  They must come, Dave resolved, and
set his jaw stubbornly to the task of
making good. As a constant reminder
that he must, he hung Sylvia Farrel’s
framed photograph on the wall of his
store. Just as soon as he could make a
success of the station, she was coming
from Papeete to be his wife. As the
daughter of a wealthy British planter
she had been used to the best and Dave
had promised that he would provide it.
Sylvia had said she would wait.

   “I’ll have a cargo of copra ready for
COPRA

7

your next call," Dave assured Bill when
the lugger hove anchor, “or find cut
why.”

  He began his drive for trade by
cleaning up the store and re-arranging
his stock. Then he took a bag of sam-
ples and set off to make a round of the
villages. At the first village he pre-
sented the head man with a fine meer-
schaum pipe. The head man was de-
lighted and promptly brought forth
gifts of his own, consisting of fruit and
carved ornaments.

  Dave then displayed his samples.
But he couldn’t make the head man
understand until Samona appeared and
proceeded to interpret beautifully.

   “I take you to all the village,” she
offered graciously.

   In succeeding days she escorted Dave
to the various island settlements.
Faithfully she translated Dave’s plea
that the Tana wains bring copra to his
station and receive fair trade in return.

  “What does the head man say,
Samona?”

  “He say that he like make you his
son, that his house is your house, that
he are come bring many present.” ■

   The deluge of gifts arrived and Sam-
ona helped arrange them in the store.
Before Dave knew it she had made
herself indispensable. Her laughter
drove away loneliness and she brought
a guitar to his veranda and sang to him
soft, Polynesian love songs. The songs
brought other youngsters, and soon
Dave’s station became the social center
of the island. There were dances by
moonlight under the palms with Sam-
ona as hostess. And when the head
men came bearing gifts she received
them and thanked them prettily for
Dave. And because she was from the
highest ranking family on the island,
her sponsorship brought him many
friends.

  Samona brought him everything but
copra. If a head man had a few shil-
lings in cash, he came in to spend it
recklessly at Dave’s counter. But not a
single fiber of that staple which makes
the wheels of South Seas commerce
turn, crossed his threshold.

  All copra went to the Logan Broth-
ers’ station, where it was bargained for
sharply by Red Ryan. And Dave began
to realize that he’d have not a sack of
cargo ready, when Bill’s lugger next
appeared in the lagoon.

ONE day he came upon the derelict,
Stoney, half asleep with his
ragged back to a palm. “See here,
Stoney,” Dave said to him, “what’s
going on around here, anyway?”
Stoney blinked. “You mean ’oo done
in poor old Welshy?”

  “No, I didn’t exactly mean that. But
who did kill him?”

  Stoney looked both ways, then low-
ered his voice. “Yer kin lay to it,
matey, it was a white man done it. A
nitive’d ’arve tiken the knife awiy with
’im.”

  “Are you accusing Grenner and
Ryan?” challenged Dave.

  “Accusin’ ain’t provin’,” Stoney
hedged. “But I seen Welshy the diy
afore he was done in, an’ *e told me
’e’d just found out abort why the In-
landers wouldn’t bring ’im any copra.
Said ’e ’ad a full report writ out, an’
was gonna send it orf on the next
boat.”

  “Did he mention Grenner or Ryan?”
“Didn’t mention no nimes. Close-
lipped, ’e was, and looked kinder
skeered. But listen, matey, I’ve been
on this beach a long time an’ I’ve ’ad
arf an eye open. I was ’ere when Ryan
come, and up to then the two stores got
a even break on copra. But arfter Ryan
come, the nitives quit your store cold.”
8

ARGOSY

   Dave puffed thoughtfully at his pipe.
“How do you suppose Ryan manages
it, Stoney?”

   “ 'E’s got somethin’ on Grenner, ’e
’as. If yer find out wot it is, they’ll
both ’ave to leave. Then yer’ll git all
the copra on the hiland.”

  Before Dave could answer, some-
thing catapulted from the sky and
smashed into the sand close by him. It
only missed crushing his skull by
inches.

  “I almost got a chunk of it right
then,” he said with a grimace.

  “Never w'orry abort them failin’
cocoernuts, matey,” Stoney assured
him. “Funny thing, but they never hit
nobody. I been sleepin’ under these
trees fer fifteen years. And the nitive
villages are allers in cocernut groves,
with brown bibies pliyin’ under ’em
alia time, but the cocernuts allers miss
’em.”

  Dave had often heard the same
thing—a tradition in the South Seas
that people under cocoanut trees lead
charmed lives.

  “But never mind that, Stoney. What
about Grenner and Ryan? If Ryan can
make Grenner jump through a hoop,
why should it affect the natives?”
“The nitives pay taxes and fines by
workin’ on the roads, if they ain’t gort
cash,” Stoney explained. “Grenner, ’e’s
magistrate, jury, tax assessor an’
heverything else ’ere. Ryan likely says
to ’im, ‘See ’ere, Grenner, if they’re
my customers, you let ’em orf easy. If
they ain’t my customers, you stick
’em.’ ”

III

WHEN Dave left Stoney, he was
indignant and yet not alto-
gether discouraged. He felt sure he
could checkmate Grenner by attending

court trials himself and demanding fair
play.

  But cases were infrequent. The
islanders were generally well-behaved,
and weeks passed before a native stood
before Grenner charged with intoxica-
tion, in which state he had broken a
kava bowl over his host’s head.

  The defendant being an important
customer of Ryan’s, Dave watched the
proceedings alertly. To his surprise
Grenner severely fined the man thirty
shillings. In lieu of payment the culprit
could spend thirty days washing dishes
in the residency kitchen.

  A fair judgment, Dave thought.
There was no way for him to learn that
Grenner later sent one of his constables
to inform the man that the fine was
remitted.

  Day after day the islanders took
copra to Ryan. When the Logan Broth-
ers’ regular lugger dropped anchor, a
full cargo was ready for it. But when
Skipper Bill chugged in through the
reef, Dave Weston had nothing for
him at all.

   “It’s tabu to trade here,” Dave re-
ported gloomily. He went on to recite
Stoney’s theory about Grenner and
Ryan.

   Bill poured himself a tall tumbler of
rum. On the veranda a group of boys
and girls were dancing. Samona was
strumming a guitar and the soft notes
of her song same pleasantly through
the door.

   “Looks like tough weather ahead for
you, son,” Bill said. “Once one of these
tabus gets to operatin’, it’s hard to lick.
It gets set, like cement. Grenner may
not even have to keep on with any more
high-handed taxes and fines.”

   “I don’t see why,” Dave protested.

  “That’s because you don’t under-
stand the native mind. Look at it this
way: suppose a cocoanut drops on a
COPRA

9

native and kills him. His people would
think nothin’ of it. But if another nut
drops from the same tree and kills an-
other native, then the head men’d get
together and slap on a tabu. And it’d
stick tight for generations. Even if no
other cocoanut ever did drop outa that
tree, the natives’d always stay away
from it.”

  Dave went to his desk and wrote* a
discouraged letter to Slyvia Farrel, and
Bill took it with him when he went
down to the lugger.

  When the boat was gone Dave wan-
dered down the beach to find Stoney.
Stoney lived with a Tanawain wife in
a grass shack well apart from any vil-
lage. The house was built against a
cliff from which spring water dripped,
and was banked with banana trees and
giant ferns.

  Approaching it, Dave heard Stoney
cry out from within, “Leave orf, I tell
yer. Get outer ’ere an’ leave me
alone.”

  There came a whacking sound fol-
lowed by a scream from Stoney. And
Dave entered to see Red Ryan twist-
ing Stoney’s wrist. Stoney was on his
knees, howling.

  “Pay that chit you owe me,” Ryan
threatened, “or I’ll take it out of your
hide.”

  He struck Stoney a blow which sent
the slighter man across the room.
Stoney’s head struck a wall and he col-
lapsed there, unconscious.

  Ryan turned to face Dave Weston.
“This bum’s been mooching rum at my
counter for years,” he explained with
a grin.

  “How much does he owe you ?” Dave
asked quietly.

  “Somethin’ around two quid ten.”

  Dave produced his wallet and
counted out the money. “Here you
are.”

  Ryan, in surprise, took the money.

  “Now come outside and take some-
thing else, Ryan.”

  When they were outside, Dave
promptly gave Ryan a stinging slap on
the side of the head.

RYAN reddened. He came charg-
ing like a buffalo and Dave
stepped aside to let him go by. As
Ryan whirled, Dave’s right caught him
neatly on the chin.

  Ryan dove for a clinch but Dave
shook him off; and his left drove quick
punches into the man’s stomach. Ryan
bellowed, flailing his arms. Dodging,
Dave jabbed a right to the head which
rocked Ryan back on his heels.

   “I’ll kill you!” Ryan screamed.

  “Like you did Welsh?” said Dave,
and again his knuckles stung Ryan on
the cheek.

  A moment later he put all his
weight into a punch that struck Ryan
full on the mouth. Ryan went down
with blood spouting from his lips. He
sprawled there with his back to a palm,
his head rolling groggily. His two
upper front teeth were gone.

  Dave w'aited for him to get up.
When he did not, Dave left him and
went home.

  Samona was in the store filling a
vase with bright blossoms.

  “Just had a run-in with Ryan,” Dave
explained when she noticed a slight cut
over his eye.

   The girl was instantly distressed. It
was not good to fight Ryan, she said.
“Always it bring bad luck.”

  “It won’t bring him back those
teeth,” Dave grinned.

  She was bathing his scratch with
cocoanut oil when a messenger came
summoning Dave to appear before
Grenner.

  Dave went promptly to the resi-
10

ARGOSY

dency. To liis astonishment he found
that Ryan had preferred charges of
assault and battery. Ryan himself was
there as complaining witness.

  “This guy got sore because I get all
the trade,” Ryan testified. “So he
jumped me from behind and knocked
me down with a club. Then he kicked
out my teeth.” Ryan opened his mouth
to prove it, all the while glaring malig-
nantly at Dave.

  “That's a lie,” Dave said. “I caught
him beating up Stoney, so I took him
outside and bashed his face in.”

  “I didn’t touch Stoney,” insisted
Ryan. “I was just trying to collect a
bill.”

  “A merchant has a right to collect
from deliquent customers,” Grenner de-
creed solemnly. “How he does it is no
concern of yours, Weston. Moreover I
won’t countenance any brawling on this
island. You yourself admit disfiguring
the plaintiff. So I’m fining you ten
pounds.”

  Dave’s temper broke leash. “You’re
a fat-headed crook, Grenner!”

  Then eyes clashed.

  “Five pounds more for contempt of
court,” the resident snapped. He turned
to his crew of native constables. “Hold
this man in custody till he pays his
fines.”

  Dave, biting his lip, counted out fif-
teen pounds. Payment of the sum would
leave him almost penniless.

  Walking back to the station he was
able to consider the affair soberly, it
seemed to him that Ryan had acted en-
tirely out of character. A tough, hairy
trader with a dragon tattooed on his
chest should not, by the usual prece-
dents, go rushing to a magistrate. On
the contrary he would be expected to
get himself a copra knife, or a gun,
and make murderous assault on the ad-
versary.

  And that, reflected Dave, w-as exact-
ly what had happened in the case of
Todd Welsh. Which meant that Ryan
had simply been clever enough not to
repeat the same type of assault. Two
successive competitors found stabbed
would have been like finding two men
crushed by cocoanuts dropping from
the same tree.

  Grenner was in it writh Ryan—that
was clear enough. Between them they
controlled this island and every soul
on it.

A GAIN the Logan Brothers’ boat
called and again Ryan had a
copra cargo ready for it. Then Skipper
Bill called ^gain. Samona canoed Ryan
out as the lugger dropped anchor.

 “Any cargo?” bawkd Bill as Dave
and the girl climbed over the rail.

  “Not a sack,” Dave reported.

  Bill handed him two letters. The first,
from the company’s main office, re-
buked Dave sharply for making even
less of a showing than previous agents.
It announced that hereafter Dave would
be put on a strictly commission basis.
No trades, no pay.

  The second letter was from Sylvia
Farrel. A ring fell from it. Dave read .*

    It’s no go, Dave. The entire situation is
  impossible. I can’t bring myself to live on
  that savage island, where the natives stab
  traders while they sleep. And frankly I
  can’t quite be reconciled to marrying a
  failure. This is goodbye—and don’t think
  too hard of me, please.

  Dave sat dowrn on a hatch and stared
glumly ashore. But the steep, green
mountain held no beauty.

 “Have a drink, son, and brighten
up.” Bill sat down by him with a bottle
of brandy.

  Dave snatched it, knocked the neck
off on the rim of the hatch and up-
turned the bottle to his lips. And Skip-
COPRA

11

per Bill, seeing the open letter and the
ring, understood.

  Bill went to the rail and called down
to a score of young Tanawains who
were alongside in canoes. “Come
aboard, boys and girls,” he yelled.
“Dave needs cheerin’ up.”

  They came scrambling over the rail.
“Strike up a song,” Bill said heartily,
“and maybe we can pull Dave outa the
dumps. He's bluer’n a shark’s belly.”
All afternoon there there was sing-
ing and dancing on the deck, but Dave
ignored it He continued to sit mood-
ily on the hatch, drinking to quench the
bitterness in him. By sundown his brain
was reeling.

  “Don’t take it so hard,” Bill said.
He put a fatherly hand on Dave’s
shoulder. “What’s a woman, anyway?
If one quits you, all you gotta do is
pick out another’n. Pick one that’ll stick
by you, next time.”

  Dave shrugged away from him. He
knocked the neck from another bottle
and kept on drinking.

  “What about that’n over there?”
Bill continued slyly. His thumb indi-
cated Samona, who was perched on the
rail- making guitar music for the
dancers. “She’s a cute one, Dave, purty
as a hummin’ bird but not near so
flighty. What’s more, I’ve an idear
she’d stay with a man.”

  “She’s native,” Dave mumbled.
“What of it?” argued Bill. “White
or brown makes no never mind down
in these islands. What a man wants is
loyalty.”

  Dave took another drink. Then his
eyes shifted toward Samona. He saw
the warm olive of her skin, the rich red-
ness of her cheeks and lips—her dark,
melting eyes. He saw a luxury of shin-
ing hair that tumbled to her waist, with
flowers wreathing it; bare feet, and
hands as shapely as any queen’s.

  Dave stood up. Two boys were beat-
ing drums, and the pounding was like
a savage tom-tom in his ears. The deck
was spinning, but he managed to cross
to Samona.

  When he reached her he crushed her
in his arms, kissing her lips. He pressed
her to his breast.

  “Will you marry me, Samona?” he
said, gently.

  Her head went back and her eyes
stared into his for a moment. Wonder
and rapture were in her face. Then
tears came and made her eyes like stars.
“I have love you all the days,” she
whispered.

  Dave called brusquely to Skipper
Bill. “You can marry people on your
own deck, can’t you?”

  “As slick as a whistle,” Bill asserted.

  The young Tanawains applauded
gleefully. Bill went below deck and
came up with the book. The sight of it
sobered Dave a moment. Then he saw
Sylvia’s letter on the hatch and his jaw
set stubbornly. “Get along with it, Bill,”
he directed.

  Bill got along with it. Then followed
more drinking, dancing, pounding of
drums. Dave couldn’t remember when
they carried him ashore. It was a pagan
festival from which he awoke with a
scorched throat, a roaring head—and a
Polynesian wife.

IV

T TIS reaction was apathetic. Remem-
bering Sylvia’s inconstancy, Dave
simply didn’t care one way or the other.
He took Sylvia’s framed photograph
from his wall and smashed it over the
counter. Then he sat sullenly on the
veranda, watching Skipper Bill’s lugger
chug out through the reef.

  It was days before Samona could
make him laugh. The girl herself was in
12

ARGOSY

heaven. She sang to him, waited on
him, washed and pressed his whites,
scrubbed the floors and hung garlands
everywhere about his house.

  And gradually, she melted Dave.
Sometimes, when the palm trees whis-
pered in the darkness, he thought that
he was happy with her.

  “You have no sorrow to be my hus-
band?”

  “Why should I, Samona? Only trou-
ble is you’re too good for me. You’re
lovelier than starlight—sweeter’n the
milk of a ripe cocoanut.”

  But when he watched the islanders
trooping to trade copra at Ryan’s store,
his happiness vanished. The old tabu
still held rigidly. No Tanawain would
take copra anywhere but to Ryan. Dave
was constantly reminded of his own
failure. He was penniless—and with
no pay in sight.

  “Why are you not be happy?”
Samona pleaded.

  “Because I want to buy you
pretties,” he explained. “To take you
on a happy honeymoon to Papeete. To
do that, I must first be successful here.”

  Little by little she came to under-
stand that it wasn’t enough that she
should bring him love and laughter. She
must also bring him success.

  Samona put her mind shrewdly to
that end. How could she bring success
to the man she loved ? She grappled with
the problem, willing to sacrifice any-
thing to achieve its solution.

RED RYAN stood before a mirror
scowling at his open mouth. The
void left by two missing teeth grossly
disfigured him and, at the same time,
reminded him of his grudge against
Dave Weston. “I’ll get even with that
blighter!” he said fiercely.

  A copra cargo was ready for his
next ship, but that, for Ryan, wasn’t

quite enough. He had to devise a way
to score even more cruelly against his
rival at the other station.

  Looking from his window now, he
saw Dave out on the lagoon. He was in
a canoe with Samona and they were
coming in with a catch of bonita. A
sea breeze brought to Ryan their happy
laughter.

  “That’s the ticket!” Ryan muttered
with a flash of inspiration. “That’s
what I gotta do! Take the girl away
from him. Make a bum outa him, it
would!”

  In Ryan’s stock were certain gaudy
treasures. He took them out—a neck-
lace of brilliant red glass, a sarong
of green Silk from Java, a pair of
gilded slippers from Japan.

  Next morning Samona came to a
pool near the shore. High tide filled
it twice daily, and there was a cliff by
it for diving. It had always been a
favorite plunge for the young Tana-
wains.

  Samona poised her slim figure on
the cliff. She kicked off her sandals.
Her tunic slid into a pink circle at her
feet. Nude, except for the pareu about
her hips, she dived.

  With the red glass necklace, the
Javanese sarong and the Japanese
slippers in hand, Ryan sauntered down
to the pool.

  “Take a peep, Samona,” he grinned.
“Pretty cute outfit, what? Just got ’em
in with the last stock o’ trade goods.”

  Samona admired the ornaments, as
any island girl would.

  “Come around some time,” Ryan
invited slyly, “an’ I’ll let you try ’em
on.”

  He hardly hoped for an immediate
conquest. On the contrary he antici-
pated many and patient approaches.
Her response, therefore, surprised him.
“Maybe.” Samona smiled, then fixed
COPRA

13

her eyes in rapture on the Javanese

sarong. “Maybe I come sometime.”
Ryan snatched the girl’s arm and
tried to draw her to him. She pulled
away, laughing. But her lips repeated,
“Maybe I come some day.”

   “Listen,” Ryan urged ardently, “why
don’t you leave that chump, Weston,
and come live with me? I’ll treat you
right. Give you anything you want.”
She let her lashes drop coyly, back-
ing a step in retreat before Ryan’s ad-
vance.

   “That guy’s busted,” Ryan argued.
"What you need is a head man like
me.”

   Her eyes met Ryan’s with a seduc-
tive smile. Ego prevented him from
guessing that she was playing a game
deeper than his own—that those dark,
drooping lashes concealed a bold and
desperate inspiration.

   “I think it over,” Samona promised.
“I let you know.”

   She took up her tunic and sandals
and scampered away. And Ryan re-
turned in a glow to his store.

SAMONA’S heart was thumping
like mad as she made her way
through the screen of ferns which ob-
scured the house of Stoney and Makea.
Makea was Stoney's plump, middle-
aged wife, and had long been an inti-
mate of Samona’s. Samona knew that
she could trust both Makea and Stoney.

  She burst in upon them with an
amazing confidence. “I like make my
man big success. I like my people bring
all copra to his store.”

   Stoney cocked an eye at her. “They
darsen’t do that. It’s tabu.”

“You help me,” Samona pleaded, “we
make bigger tabu against Ryan.”
Stoney thought it over. Yes, he
agreed, it might work out if they could
do that. The Tanawains had only one

 commercial crop—copra. They had to
 trade it somewhere. If they couldn’t
 take it to Ryan, they would have to take
 it to Dave Weston.”

   “Wot’s goin’ on in that purty ’ead
 o’ yourn, Samona?”

   “You are remember French half-
caste family live here once?” she whis-
pered.

   “You mean the Brousseau outfit?”
 prompted Stoney, gaping. “Sure. It was
 tabu to go anywhere near their planta-
 tion.”

   Makea, too, remembered. No tabu
 had ever been so fearful or rigid on
 the island.

   Samona, after swearing them to se-
 crecy, unfolded a plan. The boldness
 of it shocked them. Both Stoney and
 Makea argued against it. “Dive,” as-
 serted Stoney, “ ’e’d never stand for it.”

   But Dave mustn’t know anything
about it, Samona said. Neither must
any human on the island except them-
selves. If the plan succeeded, then her
- people would take no more copra to
Ryan’s store. It would all go to Dave
for lack of another market.

   “All right, go ahead with it,” Stoney
 said finally. “Makea an’ me, we’ll keep
 our lips buttoned and ’elp yer all we
 can.”

   An hour later Ryan was delighted
 to see Samona enter his store. He
 greeted her with effusion. And this
 time when he displayed his treasures,
 she put them on. She posed in them in
 apparent rapture before a mirror.

   “Like ’em ?” grinned Ryan.

   She answered by putting her arms
 about his neck and kissing his lips.
 “You be lonesome, maybe,” she mur-
 mured, “I are not like you be lone-
 some.”

   She hid her eyes against his shoulder
 so he couldn’t see the tears starting
 there. He must not guess that to be
14

ARGOSY

 clasped in his arms was like crucifixion.

  Ryan held her triumphantly. “You
can have anything you want here,
sweetheart,” he crowed, “just as long
as you don’t go back to that Weston
bum.”

  When native customers entered the
store they found Ryan holding Samona
on his knees and caressing her fondly.
He w'inked at the intruders. “Go ask
Dave Weston if he ain’t lost some-
thing,” he suggested maliciously.

  The news speedily reached Dave and
he refused to believe it. But when
Samona hadn’t come home by late
afternoon, he went looking for her.
He asked Stoney.

  Stoney shook his head dolefully. “I
’eard she’s tiken up with the bloke
Ryan.”

  Dave stalked into Ryan’s store. He
saw Samona seated on a counter. Ryan
stood by her holding a bottle of beer.

  Sight of them ^paralyzed Dave. ^He
stood choking for a moment, then
called angrily, “Get out of here,
Samona, and come on home.”

  “I like best stay here,” Samona pro-
tested. She averted her eyes from
Dave’s.

  “Go roll your hoop, mister/’ Ryan
jeered. “Can’tcha see she’s picked her
a new man ?”

  Dave’s fist lashed out for Ryan’s
chin. Ryan toppled backward and hit
the floor in a heap.

  “Are you coming, Samona?” Dave
demanded with tense finality.

  Instead of coming, she jumped to
the floor, kneeled there and took Ryan’s
head in her arms. “I not coming,” she
said bravely.

DAVE went home and, within an
hour, he was summoned before
Grenner.

  “You’re charged with entering an-

other man’s house and assaulting him.
Do you deny it ?”

   “He stole my wife. I wish I’d killed
him.”

  “Your wife went to him of her own
free will,” Grenner said coldly. “Since
you were the aggressor in the victim’s
own house, I’m forced to fine you ten
pounds.”

   “And if I don’t pay it?” Dave chal-
lenged.

   “You can go to jail.”

  Dave laid his gold watch on the
table. “Will you accept this till I raise
the money?”

  Grenner accepted the watch and
Dave went angrily out. And, at that
same moment, at Ryan’s, Samona was
seated on the arm of Ryan’s chair, rub-
bing liniment on his bruised chin.

  “You’re here for keeps, Samona,”
Ryan grinned. His jaw ached, but aside
from that he was feeling immensely
satisfied with himself for now his re-
venge on Weston was complete.

  “You mean you like marry me?’”
Samona asked.

  Ryan frowned for a moment. Then
his face cleared. This young girl pleased
him more and more every minute. Yes,
he’d even marry her if she insisted.
“But I are already marry,” she said.
“You won’t be long,” he grinned.
“Weston got an eyeful. He’ll divorce
you soon enough. Then you’ll be free.
In the meantime—”

   “In meantime,” she supplied quickly,
“I stay here only daytime. I are good
Christian, please. I keep your house
nice, yes? Night time I go stay with
my people.”

  Ryan argued with her. But it was
useless. And he was afraid to press the
matter for fear of losing her altogether.
The whole island would believe she was
living with him, even if, technically,
she was not. Dave Weston would be-
COPRA

15

lieve it, and that was what Ryan really
wanted.

  Samona remained with him until the
last customer had left for the night. It
was dark outside, and Ryan locked the
store. Then she kissed him goodbye
until morning and ran through the
woods to the house of Stoney and
Makea.

  They were expecting her, and Makea
had made a pallet for her. Samona
flung herself on it, sobbing, humiliated,
aching with each heartbeat. All night
she lay there beseeching forgiveness
from the God of her faith—the God of
the Ten Tabus.

  But at daylight she was cooking
Ryan’s breakfast in his kitchen, and,
while he was eating it, she slipped away
to bathe in the pool.

  Other Tanawains were there and
they asked her if it were true she had
left Dave for Ryan. Samona made her-
self admit it brazenly. Ryan was rich
and successful, she said, and he had
given her many beautiful things.

  Weeks passed, and by day Samona
rarely left Ryan’s store except to bathe
in the pool. No one on the island other
than herself, Ryan, Stoney and Makea
knew that she always slipped away by
night.

  At his own store, Dave brooded. He
grew listless and disheveled, and he
drank freely from the trade gin on his
shelves. With no one to wash and press
his whites, his wardrobe became as dis-
reputable as Stoney’s.

  He thought of divorcing Samona.
But what was the use? That, he rea-
soned, would be just what they wanted.

  With bitterness smoldering in him,
he resolved to remain on the island
only long enough to fashion a noose
for Ryan’s neck. Ryan, he felt certain,
had murdered Welsh. And for that
crime he must be brought to book. “I’ll

see him hanged for it,” Dave resolved
stubbornly.

  There should be a way to prove it.
Sometimes coldly sober and sometimes
sunk deep in his cups, Dave strained his
mind implacably toward that end. Over
and over he essayed to reconstruct the
scene of Todd Welsh’s death. Many
times he recalled his horrified intru-
sion upon it with Skipper Bill. He re-
membered now that some unnatural
feature of the scene had seemed to im-
press him vaguely—a thing which
horror had immediately shocked from
his recognition. Desperately, but in
vain, he tried to resurrect that impres-
sion. It was a negative clue, he thought
—something which should have been
there and wasn't. . . .

V

fI^HE illusion of Samona’s unfaith-
fulness had endured three months
when the girl embarked upon a project
even more bold and terrifying. Late
one night she left Ryan, as usual, and
went to Stoney’s. There she brought
forth a vial containing a milky white
stain. Makea had helped her mix it
from fruit juices and the sap of a tree.

  ‘‘The time are come now,” Samona
announced.

  She stripped to the waist, turning
her back toward Stoney and Makea.
By the eerie light of candlenuts, Makea
began staining a white patch on the
girl’s flesh. It was a circular patch about
six inches in diameter, and was stained
exactly in the center of Samona’s back.

  The milky whiteness of it stood out
in sickly contrast to the firm brown
of her skin.

  But Stoney was pessimistic. “Yer
won’t fool nqhody,” he predicted.
“They could look at yer fice an’ see
yer as ’ealthy as I am.”
16

ARGOSY

   “They will believe when I admit it
myself,” Samoa insisted. “They are be-
lieve it when they see Brousseau girl,
yes ?”

  “They sure did,” Stoney conceded.
“That was ten year ago, an’ it skeered
’ell outer hevery nitive on the hiland.
Somebody seen ’er slip into the woods
all by ’erself an’ undress. They seen
’er ’old a mirror to look at ’er back.
There was a big white spot, all blotchy
like, an’ it set the nitives tarkin\ First
thing yer know they found out the
truth. Then the girl an’ all ’er blood
kin were deported.”

  In the morning Ryan woke to find
Samona, as usual, preparing his break-
fast.

  And, as was her custom, while he
ate, she slipped away to the pool.

   A group of boys and girls were bath-
ing there but Samona, seeming to be
troubled and embarrassed, conspicu-
ously avoided them. She did not enter
the pool. Instead she withdrew to a se-
cluded place down the beach, screening
herself behind rocks before dropping
off her tunic.

   It wasn’t like Samona to be so un-
sociable and the others noticed it. And,
after several mornings of such odd con-
duct, a group of Samona’s old bathing
comrades went down to see why she
had become so exclusive. She let them
creep up on her and when they
appeared around a corner of the rocks,
they found her holding a mirror in her
hand—holding it so that, standing in
a twisted posture, she could see the
round white patch on her back. Her
face was contorted with despair.

  When her friends came closer, she
snatched up her tunic in confusion. But
they had all been able to observe the
white patch.

  “You will not tell the governor,
please?” she implored them. “If you

tell governor I will be deported,” she
pleaded. “I and all my blood kindred.
And please, you must not come near
me again.”

  As they began to get a horrified
inkling of her condition, they backed
farther away and stood whispering. In
a little wrhile they ran quickly to the
nearest village, where they reported
breathlessly to the head man.

  Consternation gripped the head man.
He hastened to the beach and spoke to
Samona from a distance.

  “Is it true, my daughter?”

  Samona’s head bowed in a convinc-
ing show of shame. “Do not tell Ryan,”
she begged. “He will beat me. Then
he will tell governor, and I will be sent
away.”

THE Tanawains were more fearful
of deportation than of leprosy itself
and, that night at a solemn conclave
held by head men from all the villages,
it was agreed that on no account must
Grenner be told about Samona. The
Brousseau experience was reviewed in
detail, an affliction resulting in the vic-
tim and all her|blood kindred being
exiled from the island.

  In this case the decree went out that
every lip must be sealed. Severe pen-
alties would be meted to anyone who
told Grenner or Ryan.

  “But will not Ryan, who lives with
her, see it with his owrn eyes?” one of
the head men questioned.

  “She will conceal it from him with
fear and shame,” another said. “When
she can deceive him no longer, she will
hurl herself into the sea.”

  Then the chief head man laid down
a rigid tabu. Not one of them must
ever again approach Samona. She, and
the house where she lived, must be
shunned as one shuns untouchable
death,

  “How’s trade, Ryan?” Grenner in-
quired one evening a week later. They
were drinking beer at the residency.

  Ryan frowned. “Funny thing about
that," he fretted. “I ain’t had a sack
come in for five or six days.”

  “They’ll be coming along with it,”
Grenner assured him. “They’ve got to
take it some place, you know.”

  “But that ain’t all,” worried Ryan.
“There ain’t been a native in the store
lately, not even for a pinch of nigger-
head.”

   As more days passed, the inexplicable
lack of trade continued to mystify
Ryan. He made a trip through the vil-
lages, presenting a quart of trade gin
to each head man. The gifts were ac-
cepted politely, and other gifts ten-
dered in return. But still no copra came
to the Logan Brothers’ station.

  One day he tried to hire a couple of
boys to repair the station’s grass roof.
But even an offer of a shilling a day
could not induce them to come.

  Ryan sweated and swore as he did
the work himself.

  “See here, Samona,” he complained,
'what’s the matter with everybody?
You’d think we had a plague, or some-
thing !”

  “It are so strange,” she murmured.
“I are not like to see you not happy.”
She uncorked a bottle of beer for him
and stood fanning away flies while he
drank it.

  When he slipped an arm around her
waist and kissed her, she endured it
with a smile. “I are see Dave on beach
today,” she laughed. “He are more
unhappy than you. But I do not care.*’

  Always her surest defense was to re-
mind him of Dave’s wretchedness. It
would endure in its most bitter pitch,
Ryan knew, only so long as Samona
seemed to continue living as the mis-
tress of this house. Only by respect-

 2 A—24

ing her silly, stubborn scruples could
he keep her here. It was the best bar-
gain he could make. In the meantime
she was keeping his house spotless and
serving him food and drink.

  Ryan was more of a drinker than a
lover. But most of all he was an egoist
and it preened his ego to torment Dave
Weston.

ONE day Dave Weston was aroused
from a lonely carousal to find a
customer in his store. The man had
two sacks of copra and offered them in
trade.

  Dave burst into ironic laugher at his
own expense. “Two measly sacks! All
right. When Bill’s lugger comes, I can
put one in his aft hatch and one for-
ward."

  The man wanted twist tobacco. Dave
had hardly finished weighing it out
when three other Tanawains entered.
Each had two sacks of copra. Sight
of the merchandise shocked Dave
sober.

  Other islanders came and by sun-
down Dave had five tons of copra in his
storeroom. He went out and looked
toward Ryan’s station. The place was
deserted.

  The same surprising deluge of trade
continued the next day. Dave was kept
jumping from one customer to another
and by night his back ached from the
exertion of handling heavy merchan-
dise. He went to bed so tired that for
once he fell asleep without brooding
about Samona.

  While he slept, Red Ryan stormed
into the residency. “Look here, Gren-
ner,” he raged, “you get busy and do
something about this!”

  The threat in his eyes frightened
Grenner. He was at Ryan’s mercy, he
knew, and had been for the last twelve
years. “I’ll do what I can.”
18

ARGOSY

  What Grenner did was not enough.
During weeks which followed, he im-
posed high-handed penalties against
every islander brought before him as
magistrate. He hitched up his donkey
cart and made a round of the villages,
announcing a new road to be built
through the jungle which would call for
a heavy tax of man power.

  But to his chagrin, the Tanawains
submitted to both fines and taxes. No
copra went to Ryan. All of it went to
Weston.

  “Look here, Red,” Grenner said to
Ryan. “I can stick one native and I
can stick ten of them. But I can’t hang
a rap on the whole population. There’s
a limit, you know.”

  Ryan cursed him. “There's a limit
to the time you’ll be out o’ jail,” he
threatened, “if I start talkin’.”

  When the Logan Brothers’ boat
called in the lagoon a week later, Ryan
had no cargo for it. Captain Jake
Hammond, in command, was both as-
tonished and annoyed. His immediate
assumption was that Ryan had made
himself personally unpopular due to
some incident of cheating.

  So Hammond took an interpreter
and toured the villages. He returned
to the station with an apology. “It’s not
you, Ryan. They say you haven't
cheated ’em. It’s the station. There’s a
tabu on it. The head men say they will
never trade here again.''

  “Why?” demanded Ryan.

  “They don’t say why. But my ex-
perience is that when one of these tabus
gets plastered on a station, it’s likely
to stick for good. This is serious,
Ryan. I’ll steam right over to Apia and
report it to the Logans.”

  As speedily as his boat could make
the round trip, Hammond was back
from Apia. The decree of Logan Broth-
ers infuriated Ryan. The Logans were

canny Scots, and were taking no
chances. So Ryan's straight salary had
been stopped; hereafter he must operate
on a strictly commission basis.

  “That’s the way Outer Islands Com-
pany handles their man,” Hammond
said. “So you get an even break.”
“You can’t put that over on me,”
Ryan stormed. “I quit.”

  Hammond's mouth tightened. “Very
well. You quit. In that case I’m in-
structed to abandon the station.”

  He brought his crew ashore and pro-
ceeded to denude the store’s $fock in
trade. All goods from the shelves were
transported to the ship.

  “You can have passage to Apia if
you like,” Hammond offered.

  Ryan nodded sullenly. “I’m taking
a girl with me. That all right ?”

  “Sure,” Hammond grinned. “Fetch
her along.”

  But when Ryan went looking for
Samona, she was nowhere to be found.
There was no target for his temper ex-
cept Grenner. “I’ll make a bum outa
you for letting me down, Grenner,” he
swore.

  He went aboard and the ship slipped
out through the reef. Grenner wavered
between relief and terror. He tried to
bolster a hope that Ryan would think
better of it, once he had time to cool
off.

  Near midnight Grenner heard a
strange crackling and popping. He
looked out into the dark, and saw that
Ryan’s empty store was a ball of fire.
Some of the Tanawains, he supposed,
must have crept up to it with torches.
Why ? Why had the place been so mys-
teriously shunned, and why was it now
being burned ?

  Grenner didn’t know and didn’t much
care. His own troubles were enough.
With a shrug, he tossed down another
drink and went to bed.

WHILE it was still dark Samona
came from the fringe of forest
and stood by the glowing coals which
had been Ryan’s store. She dropped
upon them one necklace of red glass,
one pair of slippers from Japan and one
Javanese sarong.

  Then tropic dawn brought soft
shadows to the island, and the people
of the main village were confounded to
see Samona appear suddenly among
them. Her eyes were shining. She had
never been more beautiful, more vi-
brant with life.

   She carried a basket on her arm. The
head man stared for a moment, then
shrieked a demand that she go in-
stantly away.

  Samona laughed joyously. “Do not
have fear,” she cried. “I am not as you
hink. Come. I prove it.”

  She dropped her tunic and stood
with her bare back exposed to them.
The white spot was still there, and they
shrank away.

   “But it is only the stain of the fruit,”
she explained. “I have put it there my-
self, to drive evil from our land.”
From the basket she produced a
sponge and a can of oil. Then she
pleaded that the head man come to her
and be convinced. With his own hands
he could scour the spot from her flesh.

  At last he approached warily. Then
he took the sponge, soaked it in the oil
and rubbed it across her back. The
spot of white came off. Samona stood
brown and clean before them.

  When they saw the miracle, the vil-
lagers shrieked joyfully. They danced
about Samona, embraced her, made her
tell them everything. The head man
could not control his mirth when she
exposed the deception on Ryan. He
sent messengers with the good news to
all other villages. After commanding

the kava bowls to be brought forth, he
ordered a great feast and celebration.

  Samona slipped away almost imme-
diately. Her ordeal as a living sacrifice
was now over, and she could give her-
self back to the man she loved. So she
ran breathlessly to tell Dave. Her heart
was pounding tumultuously when she
burst in upon him. He didn't see her at
first. He was re-arranging his stock,
getting ready for another big day of
trade.

  Shyness overcame Samona when she
saw him there. His face was set in
stern lines. He seemed years older,
and the change in him shocked her.

  “I are come back, please,” she said
softly. Her voice made him whirl about.
He stared in surprise and anger. “I are
come back,” she repeated.

  Dave’s eyes hardened. “So you came
back! Isn’t that just too sweet of you!
I make a failure and you go to Ryan.
Now Ryan fails and you come back to
me!”

  “I have go to him so you make big
happy trades,” she pleaded. “I have do
no wrong, please. All the time I love

you.”

  “Get out of here!” Dave shouted.
His voice lashed her cruelly. She re-
treated a step. “Get out,” he yelled
again. “Can’t you see I’m busy?”

  Desperately, in a rush of hysteria,
she told him all about it. Dave winced
when she told about the white spot. She
bared her back, then, to let him see that
it was undefiled.

  “There’s one spot on you that won’t
come off,” he said bitterly. “You lived
with Ryan.”

  When she denied it, he wouldn’t be-
lieve her. “Clear out!” he said and
pushed her from the store.

  She ran into the woods and fell there,
sobbing. Stoney found her in a little
while. “He do not believe me!”
Samona mourned.
20	ARGOSY

  Stonev hurried to Dave. “See ’ere.
Dive, don’t be pig-’eaded. If it ’adn’t
been fer ’er, yer’d be on the bloomin’

beach.”

  But even when Stoney corroborated
Samona’s story, Dave refused to be-
lieve all of it. “I don’t want her at that
price,” he raged. “Get out!”

TpNTIRELY without competition
now, Dave continued to do heavy
trading in copra. When Skipper Bill
came again there was a full cargo ready
for him. The lugger's crew came ashore
and Stoney told them about Samona’s
ruse with Ryan. “That yarn’ll be all
over these islands afore long," Skipper
Bill chuckled. “Ryan himself ’11 hear it,
an’ burst into flame.”

  A few days after the lugger pulled
out, a New Zealand gunboat dropped
anchor in the lagoon. A tall, gray man
came ashore from it. With him came a
detail of marines.

  The arrivals marched solemnly to
the residency. When Grenner saw them
his face went white. Ryan, he guessed,
had made good his threat.

  The tall gray man produced creden-
tials announcing that he was Harring-
ton H. Ash. and that he had arrived to
replace Grenner as Resident Governor.
Then a sergeant of marines stepped up
and arrested Grenner on a charge
sworn to by Ryan.

  A few hours after the gunboat had
steamed away with Grenner, Dave was
summoned before the new resident. He
found Ash both agreeable and intelli-
gent.

  “About that Welsh murder, Wes-
ton,” he said over cocktails. “Dash it
all, it’s a disgrace to the service our
not clearing it up.”

  Dave nodded. “Too bad you weren’t
here when it happened," he said.

  “Incidentally.” announced Ash,
“Welsh’s uncle in Sydney has offered

a thousand guinea reward for the mur-
derer’s capture, dead or alive."

  “Ryan did it, of course,” Dave as-
serted, “but it needs proving.”

   Ash shook his head. “I rather doubt
that,” he thought. “Because now that
Ryan has told on Grenner, Grenner
shouldn't hesitate to tell on Ryan/’
“And he doesn’t?”

   “No. Under severe grilling he insists
he knows nothing about the Welsh
murder.”

“What did Ryan have on Grenner ?”
“Ryan paid a sizable fine twelve
years ago, when Grenner was a magis-
trate in the Samoans. Grenner simply
kept the fine for his own use.”

   “I’ll help you all I can on the W'elsh
case.” Dave promised.

  During days which followed, he was
too busy trading in copra to give the
matter much thought. By immersing
himself in hard work, he hoped that
he might in time forget Samona.

   But too often he caught sight of her
watching him wistfully from the beach.
Again and again her adoring face in-
truded upon his dreams. He missed her
laughter and the soft embrace of her
arms. He knew now that his only real
contentment was when she had shared
his life. Then he had had love with-
out success. Now he had success with-
out love—and he liked it least of all.

SKIPPER BILL’S lugger came
smoking into the lagoon.

  “I can load you to the scuppers,”
Dave reported.

  “Get your gun ready, Dave.” Bill
cautioned, “and look out for Ryan.”
“Ryan?” echoed Dave. “But he’s not
here any more."

  “He’s coming back," Bill warned
ominously, “and he swears he’ll feed
you to the sharks.”

   Samona’s leprosy deception, Bill ex-
plained, had by now been bandied all
COPRA

21

over the South Seas. “Ryan’s heard
about it, Dave. He’s sore as a boiled
owl, and he lays it all on you.”

  “On me?”

  “Sure. He figgers you done it. He
don’t credit the girl with enough savvy
to cook up a scheme like that. So he
figgers you sent her to him.”

  Dave flushed angrily. “I send her!
Does he think I’d put my own wife on
a spot like that?”

  “He’s judging you by himself, son.
You better watch out for him. Last I
heard he was tryin’ to buy a motor
launch in Pepeete.”

  “Why a launch ?”

  “So he can get away alone,” Bill
explained, “after knocking you over.”
Bill loaded his lugger with copra
from Dave’s storeroom. Then, before
weighing anchor, he hunted up Samona
and told her about Ryan’s threat. “Dave
won’t take this seriously,” Bill said, “so
you better keep a lookout for him.”

  At dawn Samona climbed agilely to
the top of a tall palm in front of Dave’s
station and hid herself there. It was
so early that the fronds shielding her
were still wet with dew. All day her
eyes scanned the sea anxiously. No
launch came. When night fell, she
slipped to the ground in tired relief.

  At the next dawn she climbed again
to the palm top. Each day she posted
herself there. Dave, busy at the store,
had no inkling of her vigilance. Nor of
her peril, for there came gales which
lashed the palm tree to violent swaying.
Days came when torrents poured from
the sky, drenching the girl and all but
washing her from her perch. But more
often she sat there in torrid sunshine
with no breath of air stirring. At such
times fatigue and lassitude occasionally
overcame her, and she found herself
dozing. Often she opened her eyes and
started with relief to discover that no
launch was in sight.

ONE sultry afternoon Dave was re-
laxing on the stoop of his store.
The beach was deserted in both direc-
tions. There were no customers today,
because the son of a head man was
being married at a far village.

  Relaxing in body, Dave put his mind
determinedly upon the enigma of
Welsh’s murder. He must think
straight. He must remember every-
thing he had seen on that day he had
first come here with Skipper Bill.

  To review what he had seen men-
tally and in proper balance, he decided
to enter now as he had entered then.

  He stood up, mounted the veranda
steps. W'hat had he seen? A table, a
chair, a half empty beer bottle.

  Entering the store, he recalled having
seen cockroaches on the counters. He
went on to the living quarters and into
the bedroom where Welsh had slept.
Exactly he forced himself to recon-
struct that exhibit of horror: Welsh
face down on the bed with a copra
knife plunged through him. . . .

  Then, in a flash, a detail which had
vaguely impressed him at the time came
back to him. There had been an entire
absence of blood. A trained crime de-
tector would have noted it at once.
But Dave in his bewildered horror had
let the fact be blotted from his mind.

  Now he grasped it. It meant that
Welsh hadn’t been killed here at all.
And—if not here, where?

  That half finished bottle of beer on
the veranda! Welsh would hardly open
a beer without finishing it. Death, Dave
felt sure, had stricken him as he sat
there drinking on the veranda.

  Dave hurried forward. The table and
chair, he saw, occupied the same spot.
A grass rug had been under the table,
but so soiled that Dave had long ago
thrown it away. Now he saw a small
jagged hole in the canvas back of the
chair. A bullet hole?
22

ARGOSY

  His eyes scanned the sheet iron wall
back of it. He found another hole there.
He gouged into it with a knife. Pass-
ing through sheet iron, the bullet had
penetrated only shallowly into the
wooden stud beyond. Welsh had been
shot, not knifed. Dave retrieved the
bullet and weighed it on his palm. A
rifle ball, he judged. He sighted from
one hole to the other, and the line of
his vision pointed directly to Ryan’s
store.

  Ryan, he knew now. had sniped
Welsh at long range with a rifle. Be-
tween sundown and dark, perhaps, or,
possibly by bright moonlight. Hours
later, Ryan must have worried because
it would look like the crime of a white
man. So he had come here, carried the
body into the bed. plunged through the
course of the bullet hole a native knife.

  It was neat, Dave admitted. Very
neat, indeed.

  Dave, with the death bullet in hand,
went in to his counter. There he found
a small apothecary scale used for weigh-
ing quinine. He weighed the bullet. It
scaled exactly two hundred and twenty-
seven grains.

  Somewhere in a litter on the shelves
was an old A, F. Stoeger’s gun cata-
logue and hand-book. He thumbed the
pages swiftly. Yes, here it was. Two
hundred and twenty-seven grains was
the weight of a bullet used in an eight
millimeter Mauser carbine.

  Elated, Dave sat down and wrote a
full report of his findings for Resi-
dent Ash. His pen raced energetically
across the paper.

  When he was done he went out with
it. Then, as he stepped from the ve-
randa, a harsh voice startled him. He
looked up and saw Ryan ten yards
awav, aiming a carbine pointblank at
his head.

  “I come a long way to get you, Wes-
ton,'’ Ryan rasped at him.

   Beyond him at the shore line, Dave
saw a twenty-foot motor launch. No
one was in it. Clearly Ryan had arrived
alone, so that he could escape safely
after the fulfillment of his vengeance.
Dave himself was not armed. He faced
Ryan grimly, bracing himself for the
shock of a bullet.

  TAKE a walk to the launch,” Ryan
ordered. “I ain’t leavin’ you here
to be found—like they found Welsh.”
“See here, Ryan,” Dave protested,
“you won’t gain anything by—”

  “Oh, won’t I ?” jeered Ryan. “Don’t
make me laugh, mister. You had your
turn, now it’s mine. Sent’ your wife
down to make a sucker outa me—while
she sneaked back to you every night!
You—”

  Dave’s eyes widened, then a bright
light broke over his face. Samona, he
knew now, had told him the truth. He
had Ryan’s own word for it.

  “Get movin’,” Ryan barked. “You
got a date to feed the sharks.”

  His mouth was ugly in its triumphant
smile.

  At close quarters in an open boat he
might have a chance, Dave decided.
“Very well,” he agreed with a shrug.
“It’s your drop.”

  He raised his hands over his head
and started toward the launch. Ryan
followed with the carbine trained on
Dave’s back.

  The way led them under a tall palm.
As Ryan passed beneath it, his shriek
make Dave turn quickly. He saw Ryan
topple to the sand. Dave stared in
amazement. A thing which never hap-
pens had happened. A seven pound
cocoanut had dropped eighty feet to
strike Ryan squarely on the skull. The
strange shot from the sky crushed him
flat.

  As he fell, the carbine flew from his
hand.
COPRA

23

  Dave sprang to the weapon, picked
it up and stood with it covering Ryan.
But Ryan lay still. Dave, kneeling by
him, looked at his eyes and saw that
he was dead.

  Then Samona came sliding down the
palm tree.

  Almost directly Dave heard cart
wheels grinding on the sand. A donkey
cart appeared from the forest, with
Resident Governor Ash driving it. Pre-
sumably the shriek from Ryan had
turned him that way.

  Ash compressed his lips sternly at
the evidence—Ryan dead, Dave with a
carbine in hand, a native girl with big,
frightened eyes hovering with her back
to the bole of a palm.

  Dave astonished him by handing over
the carbine, a mushroomed bullet and
a written report. “Compare those,”
Dave said, “and you’ll know who killed
Welsh.”

  “Welsh?” gaped Ash. “You’re talk-
ing about one homicide and I’m
looking at another.” He inclined his
head toward Ryan. “Did you kill
him ?”

  Dave shook his head.

  “I didn’t have a chance to,” he said.
“He had the drop on me, sir."

  “At least not with the carbine,” Ash

admitted with a frown. “For I heard
no shot.” He stooped to examine the
wound on Ryan’s head. Then he saw
the cocoanut nearby, with a reddish
stain on its hull.

  “This nut didn’t fall,” he said
shrewdly. “It’s green, and there’s been
no wind.”

  He looked at Dave’s heavy boots,
then at the bare feet of Samona. “She
threw the cocoanut from above, didn’t
she? You saw her come down from the
tree, didn’t you?”

  When Dave declined to answer, the
resident became impatient. “See here,
you were a witness. The only witness.
Did she or didn’t she kill this man with
a cocoanut?”

  “Where I came from,” Dave an-
swered, “the law holds a man can’t be
asked to testify against his wife.”

  He took Samona’s hand and looked
tenderly into the dark wells of her eyes.
His other hand slipped back of her
head and pulled it to his shoulder.

  As he regarded them, severity dis-
solved from the resident’s face. “The
same law holds here, young man,” he
conceded.

  “Very well.” A hard lump came to
Dave’s throat as he added gently,
“Come, Samona, let’s go home.”

CHAPTER I

 ON THE BOAT DECK

SEftOR ARMANDO MORELES
leaned against the starboard rail
of the Santa Fortuna s promenade
deck and chuckled softly at Anthony
Blaisdell’s question.

“Miss Stoddard? Why do you look
for her so late in the trip? In a few

FLYNN

“Old Hellcat," etc.

hours we will he docked at New
Orleans.”

  The promenade deck was dimly
lighted. Moreles’ slim spare figure
looked as dapper and handsome as it
ever had in the high-ceilinged govern-
ment offices in Caracas. And Blaisdell
liked him no better.

Venezuela under Gomez, the old iron
dictator, had never had a slipperier
official than Moreles. True, Gomez had
kept the small fry more or less in line.
The Caracas dungeons for thirty years
had been filled with wretches who dis-
pleased the old dictator. But Gomez was
dead. Moreles and others like him were
out. And now, lacking government
authority, Moreles was more than ever
smooth, slippery and untrustworthy.

  Blaisdell regretted that he had
broached the matter. “Miss Stoddard
seems to be aboard under some other
name. I thought you might know who
she was.”

  Moreles chuckled again as he leaned
lazily against the rail. He was a head
shorter than Blaisdell; his black mus-
tache was small and fastidious; and
now, as in the past, he had the sly man-
ner of knowing forbidden secrets.

  “A letter, a message, came aboard at

A

New Novel
of Mystery at Sea

Pilottown.” Moreles guessed. “You, my
frien’, are with the Delta Corporation.
Concessions in South America are your
business. Now suddenly, you wish to
find Miss Stoddard. The Delta Corpo-
ration, perhaps, is interested in the
Rancho del Sol holdings?”

  “I can't tell you,” Blaisdell said
slowly, and it was the truth. He had
never until this moment heard of the
Rancho del Sol.

  “Because if you are.” Moreles said
slyly, “I think it is too late. When
Gomez died, the Rancho del Sol was
lost. Others have had their eyes on it.
Senor Stoddard died three years ago.
Only his daughter is left. If Gomez had
lived. . . . But he is dead.” Moreles
shrugged. “She was lucky, perhaps, to
get out of Venezuela alive. I have been
watching her on board. She is still
frightened.”

  It seemed to Blaisdell that Moreles

25
26

ARGOSY

relished the thought. “Interesting,” he
commented carefully. “So she is
aboard ?”

  “On the passenger list she is Miss
Reyes,” said Moreles.

   “Thanks,” said Blaisdell, with rather
more brusqueness than usual. He left
before Moreles pried further into the
matter.

MISS REYES was the black-haired
girl who had come aboard at
Curacao, having changed from one of
the smaller boats running from Mara-
caibo. The erect old fellow with the
British cavalryman’s mustache had
accompanied her. Cunningham was his
name. The two had kept more or less
to themselves. Uncle and niece, so the
report went.

  It had seemed peculiar, to say the
least; that dour old uncle stamped un-
mistakably with the Union Jack—and
the charming niece with the Spanish
name, the fine black hair, and fresh
blond cheeks.

  No wonder, Blaisdell thought, he
hadn’t been able to connect the Reyes
girl with Sam Haughton’s Miss Stod-
dard.

   Miss Anita Stoddard of Venezuela is

   aboard. Place yourself unreservedly at her

    disposal.

  When the pilot came aboard at Pilot-
town, an envelope from Sam Haughton
had contained that pithy order. And
Haughton, as president of the Delta
Corporation, would expect his orders to
be carried out.

   From the passenger list Blaisdell got
the stateroom number of Miss Consuela
Reyes, and knocked on her door, late
as it was. She was not inside. Blaisdell
searched the promenade deck, the salon,
and, finally, from a steward he ques-
tioned, got track of her.

  “Miss Reyes? I think I saw her

going up on the boat deck some time
ago, sir.”

  The boat deck was unlighted,
deserted. Most of the passengers had
turned in early. The Santa Fortuna
would be docked by daybreak. The low
banks of the Mississippi were dark
blurs across the water. The deep smooth
sweep of the river had its old magic.
Blaisdell breathed deep of the fresh
swampy smell of the land. South
America, he thought as he walked
slowly along the dark deck, had its
thrills and satisfactions. The hill-girt
bay of Rio, by moonlight, for instance.
The great Christ of the Andes, lonely,
majestic in the white emptiness of a
winter dawn. But this last leg of the
trip home was always best.

  Blaisdell paused at the corner of a
deckhouse and stared toward the dim
dark levee bank across the water. And
a moment later a slender figure moved
hurriedly around the corner of the deck
house and stumbled against him. She
gasped as Blaisdell caught her. She
wrenched away.

   Blaisdell sensed her fright as he said,
“Sorry—I’ve been looking for you,
Miss Stoddard. I’m Anthony Blaisdell,
of the Delta Corporation.”

CHE stopped. She was startled, un-
^ decided. “How do you know who
I am? Why are you looking for me at
—at this time of the night?”

  Blaisdell explained. “Mr. Haughton
sent word aboard at Pilottown that I
was to place myself at your disposal. A
chap named Moreles, whom I’ve done
business with at Caracas, told me you
were Miss Stoddard. A steward
directed me up here. And now,” Blais-
dell said cheerfully, “I am at your
disposal.”

  She drew a sharp deep breath. Blais-
dell could have sworn it was a sigh of
SANTA FORTUNA

27

relief. No doubt of it—she had been
gripped by panic when she came hur-
riedly around the corner of the deck
house. Her face was all but invisible in
the shadows. Tony Blaisdell remem-
bered how striking, how pretty her face
was. He had guessed her to be about
twenty-one. Small. Slender. And there
was a bit of magic in her low voice as
she said, “Mr. Haughton must have
got my letter. I didn’t expect anything
like this. And at this time! Could—
could you stay here with me for a few
minutes ?”

  “As long as you please.”

  He saw that she was only giving him
part of her attention. Her head was
turned; her thoughts seemed to be on
that part of the deck from which she
had come.

  “Something frightened you.”

  “Yes,” she said, and "hesitated. “I
saw a man who should not be aboard.
We checked the passenger list. . .

  “I see,” Tony Blaisdell said, al-
though he didn’t at all. “Why should
this man frighten you?”

  She said slowly, “I think he may try
to kill me.”

  The wind was cool and sweet off the
lowlands beyond the deep river. The
deck pulsed vaguely under their feet as
the ship drove against the sweep of the
current. And this slender girl stood
motionless beside him on the peaceful
deck and spoke calmly of death!
“Where is he? Who is he?”

  “He was coming up from the lower
deck. I saw him in the light at the top.
I’m sure he is up here sprne where look-
ing for me.”

  “I’ll have a look.” He left her and
walked back aft along the port side,
glancing behind each big canvas-
covered lifeboat chocked along the rail.
Queer, he thought, how a few words
could alter the aspect of a night. Now

the dark river seemed lonely, mysteri-
ous. The deck was a nest of shadows
capable of concealing anything. And yet
—it was hard to believe she could be
right. Not murder—not here on the
Santa Fortuna tonight!

  Perhaps she had seen some restless
passenger coming up for a stroll. A
word to the man. a match to a cigarette
to reveal his face—

  Blaisdell stepped around the bow of
the third lifeboat—and a dark form
moved in front of him. Suddenly,
quickly, threateningly.

  Blaisdell sensed the coming blow
too late; he tried to dodge back—and
the fist smashed against the side of his
head, drove him reeling against the
stern of the next lifeboat. Flashes of
light spun in his eyes—the night
whirled. . . .

  Blaisdell threw up his left arm. A
smash on the forearm drove numbness
to the shoulder. He lurched to the rail,
dizzy, sick, weak. His attacker ap-
parently was using a blackjack. What-
ever the weapon was, the goal was
murder!

  Danger cleared Blaisdell’s head. He
twisted away from the rail, by luck
dodging another clubbed blow—and
struck hard at the dark blob of a face.

  Lips, a mustache, teeth, ground under
his knuckles. He felt the other man go
back on his heels. Long arms reached
out and caught Blaisdell. Swung him
around. Wrestled him against the
rail. ...

  Strong, astonishingly strong those
arms were. But Blaisdell was taller,
and heavier than the other. Against the
rail he managed to brace himself to
swing the man up and around against
the rail. They were both gasping,
straining. The man tore loose—and
grunted as he struck again while Blais-
dell tried to dodge.

CHAPTER II

AND BELOW . . .

TONY BLAISDELL heard a voice
say: “He’s coming around!” A
flashlight was glaring in his face. His
head hurt when he moved.

  “Take that light away! Help me up!”
Hands helped him to his feet as run-
ning steps came up. A voice said, “The
doctor will be here in a minute, sir!”
The familiar voice of Second Mate
Cochrane asked solicitously, “Can you
make it on your feet, Mr. Blaisdell?”
The flashlight showed the second
mate, two seamen, and the Stoddard
girl. The light touched her face. She
was pale. Blaisdell’s legs were rubbery.
One of the seamen was supporting him.
He was, he saw, still between the two
lifeboats.

  “I’m all right,” he said with an
effort.

  Cochrane, tall, blond, taciturn, spoke
grimly. “Who was it?”

  Anita Stoddard explained. “When
you didn’t come back, I went to the

bridge.”

  Blaisdell answered her wryly. “Well
—I found the fellow. You were right.”
“Yes—I knew I was!”

  The ship’s surgeon, Simpson,
hustled up wearing a checked dressing
gown and carrying his small black bag.
“Well, well, what’s this?.... The head,
eh? Let’s have a look—just bend over
here by the light.”

  The doctor fussed expertly for a
minute or two. “Not a thing to worry
about,” he announced cheerfully. “You
must have a hard head, young man. I
can draw the edges of this cut together.
Won’t even have to stitch it. Not the
slightest danger of a fracture, I’m cer-
tain. What happened? Fall against the
lifeboat ?”

“Met a blackjack,” Blaisdell replied

shortly, rubbing his numbed, aching
arm.

  Second mate Cochrane was still grim.
“I’ve sent for the captain. The purser’s
coming-. Here he is now.”

  Mr. Starbuck, the purser, was a
slender, pallid, youngish man who had
been on tropical runs for years; but he
still looked as if he rarely saw the sun-
light. Hastily buttoning the front of
his coat, he hurried along in the dark,
his eyes peering molelike at them.

  “Miss Reyes tells me we have a man
aboard who isn’t on the passenger list,”
Cochrane told him. “He must have
come aboard at Curacao. He’s about
five feet four or five. Small black mus-
tache—swarthy skin—looks Spanish,
but he’s not. Calls himself O’Brian. A
powerful fellow with long arms. Do
you place him?’

  “No-o—No, Pm sure not,” Starbuck
replied nervously. “I’ve seen no one
who answers that description.”

  Blaisdell’s head still throbbed pain-
fully : but his mind was cleared. “Any
chance of him being a stowaway?”
The second mate answered that posi-
tively. “We’d have found him by now.
We make a routine—and thorough—
stowaway search before entering the
States.”

  “That leaves the crew,” said Blais-
dell.

  “No one in the deck department fits
him,” Cochrane stated flatly.

  “The engine room then?”

  “I’ll have to see the chief engineer
about that. He runs things below.”
“He assaulted a passenger,” Mr.
Cochrane growled. “The captain will
want to see you, Mr. Blaisdell. You’re
going to the doctor’s office, I suppose?”
Blaisdell said, “Miss Reyes will want
to see her uncle about this. I’ll take her
down. Then I’ll come to your office,
doctor.”
SANTA FORTUNA

29

SHE did not protest. Blaisdell guessed
she wanted to be alone with him.
And when they were out of earshot she
said in distress, “I was afraid some-
thing like this would happen. I’m sorry
you did it: I shouldn’t have let you.”
“I’d do it again, you know. But I’d
take a gun. Who is this O’Brian?”
They were in the faint light at the
top of the companion steps. She looked
at him, quickly probing. “There’s so
much behind it—so much I don’t know
—I’m not sure about. I’ve heard he
calls himself O’Brian. He was pointed
out to me in Maracaibo. I was sure he
didn’t see me—either of us. W'e were
probably being watched all the time.”
“By whom?” Blaisdell insisted. “And
why did that fellow try to kill me? I
was a stranger to him.”

  She passed over the first two ques-
tions—deliberately it seemed—and knit
her brows as she said. “He must have
known you were looking for him.”
“That hardly calls for murder.”

  “I have been trying to guess why.”
She looked puzzled—and very lovely,
with her pallor, her earnestness. Her
quiet voice intrigued him. Her English
had the faintest subtle twist, as if the
ghost of another tongue lurked behind.
She did not use slang; she spoke pre-
cisely, as one might who had learned
English in another country.

  “Hadn't you better tell me all about
it?”

  “I won’t bother you. Tomorrow I
must see Mr. Haughton. What he ad-
vises. I will do. Thank you for coming
down with me.”

  She offered her hand gravely, plainly
expecting him to leave. Tony Blaisdell
grinned down at her.

  “Perhaps your—uncle will see it dif-
ferently. now that I’ve had this much
to do with the matter.”

  She shrugged, and without comment

knocked on the stateroom door. “My
uncle,” she said, “will feel as I do.”

  It occurred to Blaisdell as he watched
her that they had both hesitated
slightly before the word uncle. Her
knock on the stateroom door was not
answered. She rapped again. And Blais-
dell. absently glancing down, saw some-
thing which made him frown and
quickly reach for the door knob.

  The door was not locked. It moved
inward to his push.

  “Please!” Blaisdell said swiftly. He
stepped in front of her and pushed on
the door. Something inside, something
on the floor, kept the door from open-
ing more than a few inches. Blaisdell
was barely able to squeeze inside.

  The stateroom was lighted—and he
took a lurching step to avoid a body on
the floor.

 A NTHONY BLAISDELL was no
stranger to violence. Out-of-the-
way corners of South America, where
a junior partner in the Delta Corpora-
tion was often sent, offered moments of
trouble. But the quiet in this small
stateroom held a gruesome threat. It
was as if death had slipped in furtively
and was still lurking in the corners.

  “Who is it?” Swift alarm was in
Anita Stoddard's voice. She stood in
the doorway a moment later. Her tight
frightened whisper cut through the
quiet. “Madre de Dios—he’s dead!"
Her small oval face had the frozen im-
mobility of great shock—but not of
grief. Her eyes, wide, dark under
darker lashes, were filled with fright
and horror—but no tears.

  She shivered as she looked down.

  The old man—old Cunningham, stiff
and British—lay there clad in a dress-
ing gown hastily belted over thin paja-
mas. He lay on one hip, his legs drawn
up, his shoulders twisted down on the
30

ARGOSY

rug. His face stared up, his arms were
outflung. He must have fallen so, after
staggering back a step from the door
and collapsing.

  The blood seeped from a small hole
in the left temple. An ugly smear of
crimson stained the cheek below, as if
a hand had gone convulsively to the
spot. The left hand—the hand on that
side—was streaked with crimson.

  “They couldn’t have done this to him
for helping me!”

  Pity in Blaisdell went to meet her.
They two were suddenly alone; the ship
might not have been about them; but
death was, bringing them together as
nothing else could have done.

  Blaisdell said the thing that was in
his mind. He had to know. “He isn’t
your uncle, is he?”

  The next moment he jumped to catch
her. She had slipped down the edge of
the door to the floor. She was light,
limp in his arms as he carried her to the
bed.

   Blaisdell put his lighter to a cigarette.
His hand was not steady. He swore
softly and turned to the door and
pressed the bell for a steward.

  Blaisdell met the steward outside the
door. “There’s a dead man in there.
Notify the captain. Get the doctor. I’ll
wait here.”

  The steward backed away a step. His
face had the unbelieving astonishment
of one whose well ordered routine had
suddenly crashed about his ears. “Yes,
sir!” He backed away another step, and
turned hastily and scuttled away.

  Anita Stoddard was still unconscious
when Dr. Simpson arrived. Captain
McRory followed — and the purser,
stewards, seamen. The passageway out-
side the stateroom filled rapidly.

  McRory shouldered into the room,
stepping gingerly over the body. ‘‘What
the devil’s this? Murdered? Who did

it?” He glared from the body to Blais-
dell, and stabbed a blunt forefinger at
the bed. “What’s the matter with her?
What are you doing in here?”

  Blaisdell had sailed with McRory
before.

  “I brought Miss—Reyes down to see
her uncle,” Blaisdell explained coolly.
“We found him like this. She fainted.
I'm afraid it’s up to you, Captain.”

  Dr. Simpson turned from the bed.
“I’ll have her out of this in a minute.”
The Captain chewed his thick lower
lip. His broad forehead ridged in a
scowl. His eyes under heavy brows that
were weathered almost white, stared
helplessly at the body, glanced about the
stateroom, settled again on Blaisdell.

“Well! Haven’t you an idea? After
what happened up on the boat deck?”
“Not the slightest idea,” said Blais-
dell. “Have you found the chap who
jumped me?”

  “He seems to have shipped aboard at
Curacao under the name of Jones,”
Captain McRory declared. “The chiei
engineer took him on as a coal passer
when one of the regular crew didn’t
report back to the ship. This fellow—
O’Brian or Jones—was waiting on the
dock for a job. The ship’s being
searched from forepeak to shaft alley
for him.” The captain knelt by the
body. “This would have to happen on
my ship, and on the last night!”

  It’s queer no one seems to have heard
the shot,” Blaisdell mused.

  Dr. Simpson dissolved a large tablet
in a glass of water. He bent over the
bed now, murmuring with false cheer-
fulness, “Drink this.”

  Anita Stoddard sat up with the doc-
tor’s help, dropping her feet to the
floor. She drank obediently. She was
trembling as if some tropical fever had
driven an icy chill to the marrow of her
bones.
SANTA FORTUNA

31

  Captain McRory planted himself by
the bed. “Young lady, what do you
know about this?”

  “I—I don’t know who killed him/’
she stammered.

  “You seemed to know that fellow on
the boat deck. You will tell me every-
thing you know, please.”

  She looked past the captain to Blais-
dell. Misery was in her look, and a
silent appeal.

  “You don’t have to answer, you
know. You haven’t done anything.
Don’t let him bully you.” McRory
glared. Blaisdell smiled and said, “Miss
Stoddard’s in no condition to be ques-
tioned. Certainly not in here. Doctor,
what about it?”

  “I think Miss Reyes had better go
to her stateroom,” Doctor Simpson de-
cided. “I’ll take her.”

  “Very well. I’ll see you when you’re
feeling better,” Captain McRory in-
formed her brusquely.

  It seemed to Blaisdell that, as she
went out, the glance she gave him was
grateful. “Anything more?” he asked
the captain politely.

  McRory gave him an annoyed look.
“I’ll have questions later. You’ll be wall-
ing to answer them. I suppose ?”
“Naturally.”

CHAPTER III

ANCIENT HISTORY

BLAISDELL had to push his way
through the shocked and ner-
vously whispering crowd that had
gathered outside the door. Starbuck, the
purser, more pallid than ever, nervously
inquired, “What is it, sir? Another—”
“The captain,” said Blaisdell, “will
tell you.” He brushed past Starbuck.
As he came clear of the group about the
door, Blaisdell saw dapper little Ar-
mando Moreles leaning against the cor-

ridor wall. And Moreles’ face wore a
furtive, eager look. There was a sly
air of tension, of watchful waiting
about him that suggested undue
interest.

  Blaisdell stopped.

  “So, my frien’—there was trouble
after all? She had reason to look
frightened!”

  “Did she?” Blaisdell said. “What
makes you think this had anything to
do with her?”

  They moved along the passage out of
earshot. Moreles showed his teeth. His
eyes were bright with sly knowledge.
“Your head?” Moreles said. “How is
your head? That, I suppose, had noth-
ing to do with her?"

 “Who knows?” said Blaisdell.
“Quien sabef You get about—you kept
track of things, Moreles'. Venezuela
isn’t such a big country when you're on
the government underground, and
foreigners are involved. What d’you
know about a fellow named O’Brian?”
Moreles shrugged. “Nothing—I as-
sure you—nothing. So much has hap-
pened since Gomez died. Too many of
us have been trying to remain alive.
There were so many scores to settle.
Who is this O’Brian?”

  “He was in Maracaibo.”

  “And I came aboard at La Guaira,”
said Moreles with another shrug, as if
that settled the matter. But it didn’t.
The furtive eagerness, the sly tension,
were still there. “Tell me—they say
this old man was shot in the head. For
why was it done?”

  “Quien sabef Blaisdell repeated.
He noticed that Moreles searched his
face as if trying to weigh the amount
of truth in the reply.

  There were questions Blaisdell
wanted to ask; he put them off as Dr.
Simpson returned hurriedly along the
passage.
32

ARGOSY

  “Everything all right?” Blaisdell
asked.

  “Yes, yes. She’s quite calm. Re-
signed, as it were,” the doctor replied.
“You’re waiting to have your head
dressed, eh? I’m afraid I can’t get to
it right now. A little later.” And Simp-
son bustled toward Cunningham’s door.

  Blaisdell had forgotten about his
head. With mild surprise he realized it
was still painful. He left Moreles there;
and took with him recollection of the
man’s sly, knowing amusement. More-
les knew where he was going.

  Anita Stoddard opened her stateroom
door the moment he knocked. Her eyes
were slightly red; she had, Blaisdell
guessed, wept. But now she was sober,
calm. And as she closed the doo’-, she
said, “Thank you for getting me out
of there. I was not able to answer many
questions.”

  Blaisdell looked down at her. He
wanted to take her hand. Instead he
asked, “Feeling better now?”

  She read his mind. “You have ques-
tions ?”

“They’ll be asked anyway,” Blaisdell
reminded her. “And, in a way, it’s my
duty. You know I’ve had my orders.”
“Such comforting orders. I shall
always be grateful to Sam Haughton.”
“You know him?”

  Surprisingly she said, “I have never
seen him. He was a friend of my father’s
—long ago. I wrote him a letter before
I left Rancho del Sol. I was not certain
it would get through to him. But it
did.”

  She sat on the bed. Blaisdell took a
chair. She accepted the cigarette he
offered. Her hand, he noticed, was
steady. He liked that. He liked many
things about her, including her speech,
shadowed so unconsciously by another
tongue. “You need help,” he said.

  She nodded. Her eyes—dark blue

eyes, with long lashes—sought his face
with hurt and bewilderment.

  “I do not see why he was killed here
—killed this last night of the trip. Why
was he killed at all? He was going
north to Chicago in two days. I would
not have seen him again. Because he
helped me a little, they killed him!”
“They?” said Blaisdell. “Who?”
“But I do not know, Mr. Blaisdell,”
she said helplessly.

  “The Rancho del Sol—what about
it?”

  “My estate, left to me by my
father.”

  “And there’s trouble over it?”

  “My father was a friend of the
President Gomez,” she said slowly. “He
was a young man, my father, when he
came to Venezuela. He married a Reyes
—my mother. But that was after
Gomez had favored him—after Rancho
del Sol was started. It grew. Oil wa?
found on some of our land. Taxes were
heavy—but there was enough to pay
them easily. I was born in Washington.
I am an American—but a Venezuelan,
too. I stayed on the Rancho del Sol
after my father died. There was no
trouble until Gomez died. Then, sud-
denly, what was secure was not secure.
Friends of the old President had little
protection. Many of them were killed.
Others were exiled. But I was an
American. It was not so easy. On the
Rancho del Sol are cattle, coffee and
oil. And only I was there to hold it
against those who wanted it. There
were new laws, new regulations, heavy
fines, taxes. Trouble. Much trouble. My
money was tied up in the banks. Some
of my people were killed. It was con-
veyed to me that it would be difficult
for me to leave the country—unless the
Rancho del Sol was first sold to the
new syndicate which held the estates
next to us.”

2	A—24
SANTA FORTUNA

  “The usual squeeze,” said Blaisdell.
He could visualize all that. The Delta
Corporation, with its concessions, had
often been up against that sort of thing.
The old crowd out—a new crowd in,
with new pockets to be lined. And
Washington a long way off and slow
to act—if at all. More than one man
had seen a lifetime of work vanish in
such chaos. More than one man had
stayed and tried to fight back. Some
won out—some didn’t. Too many who
stayed died in one way or another.
Accidents happened. . . .

NITA STODDARD smiled faint-
ly. “Squeeze? Yes—that is a good
word! It was a very tight squeeze.
Finally there was only one hope. I must
get to New Orleans. And I had been
told I must not leave the district. Mara-
caibo was a long way off.” She looked
at Blaisdell gravely. “One does not
laugh at such things back from the
coast—when everything is unsettled.”
“Right,” Blaisdell agreed. “So Cun-
ningham helped you leave.”

  “He, too, was a friend of my
father’s,” she said soberly. “He knew
the danger. I think perhaps better than
I, for he had talked with others. He did
suggest that I take my mother’s name,
and travel with him to Maracaibo as
his niece, and then on to New Orleans
under his protection.”

  “Did you have any trouble?”

  “None. Although in Maracaibo Mr.
Cunningham was certain we were being
watched. From a second story window
he showed me this man O’Brian waiting
on the corner. He had seen O’Brian at
Merida, drinking with two members of
the syndicate who want the Rancho del
Sol. O’Brian had much money and was
spending it freely. Yes—we were sure
then we had been followed. But O’Brian
did not come to Curacao on the boat we

 3	A—24

took. And when the Santa Fortuna left
Curacao, I was sure there would be no
trouble. O’Brian was not aboard. And
then, suddenly, tonight I saw him com-
ing up on the boat deck—and I knew he
must have been hidden aboard, and
must be looking for me. To me it
meant danger! And I was right. But
why did he wait until tonight? And
why was Mr. Cunningham killed?” she
cried.

  “Revenge for helping you out of the
country?” Blaisdell frowned. “Tell me,
you don’t intend to go back, do you?”
“But of course,” she said positively.
Her eyes hardened. “Everything my
father left is there! They shall not take
it from me! They think, perhaps, I
have run away—but I am going back
jvith more money!”

  “You’re not, by any chance, going to
make a deal with the Delta Corpora-
tion ?” Blaisdell asked. “And go back
with Sam Haughton’s backing?”

  She shook her head. “No—I had not
thought of that. I have another way. A
better way. I will be able to do it by
myself.”

  “How?”

  She stood up, pressed out her ciga-
rette in an ash tray, and looked at him
gravely. “Perhaps I am not sure about
that myself. I will not talk about it.
But you know now what has
happened.”

  Blaisdell stood up. “And I don’t
know what’s going to happen,” he said.
“If they don’t find this O’Brian aboard,
then what? He didn’t go to all this
trouble merely because Cunningham
helped you. You don’t think this is the
end of it?”

  “How do I know?” She leaned for-
ward, troubled, urgent. “The police will
ask many questions. I do not want to
tell them much. It will be bad. Will you
remember?”
34

ARGOSY

  Blaisdell grinned at her. She was not
so helpless after all. She had spunk—
backbone—a head that was working.
“As far as I’m concerned," he pro-
mised, “you haven’t told me anything.
What you tell anyone else is your own
affair. Now hadn’t you better get some
sleep? And—keep your door locked.”
“I will,” she promised obediently.
“Good night—and thank you, Mr,
Blaisdell.”

  Blaisdell’s thoughts were far from
optimistic as he closed the door behind
lim. One murder, he knew, hadn’t
?nded the violence. There had to be
.nore of it. Cunningham’s death had
accomplished nothing final. Cunning-
lam’s death had—Blaisdell was certain
—only paved the way for something
else.	*

  At that moment a door just ahead of
him opened. Armando Moreles stepped
out into the corridor—and looked both
surprised and chagrined to see Blaisdell
there. Moreles hesitated as if wishing
to step back inside and close his door.

THAT moment of hesitation allowed
Blaisdell to come abreast of the
door. He saw a woman standing inside,
and recognized her. She was a Mrs.
Simpson, who had come aboard at
Curacao with her husband. A rather
leggy young woman with a deeply
bronzed fine face and somewhat jaded
blond hair, she ran to low-heeled shoes
and interminable walks about the deck.
Blaisdell recalled that he had seen Anita
Stoddard talking to her once or twice.
And now Moreles was with her.

  Another time it would have meant
nothing. But now Blaisdell felt the first
surge of sharp, dawning suspicion. He
sensed that Moreles was chagrined at
having been seen here. And for that
there was a reason.

  Moreles fell into step beside him,

nervously putting a cigarette between
his lips. Blaisdell wanted to look back,
but did not, certain Mrs. Simpson was
lingering in the doorway, looking after
them.

  “Tell me, my frien’, have they found
this man? Do they know any more?”
“Suppose we go and see,” Blaisdell
suggested casually. And he asked, just
as casually. “You haven’t any more
ideas about it, have you ?”

  Moreles gave him a quick look. He
was, almost visibly, examining the ques-
tion from all angles.

  “I have one idea,” he said slyly. “The
Delta Corporation will soon have an
interest in the Rancho del Sol,
perhaps ?”

  “Perhaps,” said Blaisdell carelessly,
and from the corner of his eye he saw
that Moreles looked satisfied, and he
asked. “Who else is after the estate?”
“Ah!” said Moreles. “How should I
know? One hears rumors—but what
are they? Rumors do not interest you,
Senor Blaisdell.”

  “They might,” said Blaisdell.

  Moreles chuckled. “Then I will listen
for rumors.”

  Blaisdell left Moreles and went up
to the captain’s suite. McRory looked
up and nodded tersely.

  “I w^as just going to send for you,
Blaisdell. Have a drink. There on the
tray.”

  Blaisdell took the bottle, and un
screwed the cap. “Found any trace of
this fellow O’Brian?”

  “Still searching,” he stated. ‘ lie
brought a cheap suitcase aboard. It
isn’t under his bunk in the fireman’s
fo’csle, where he kept it. He was on the
four-to-eight watch. He dressed him-
self after coming off duty and w^ent out
on deck. He seems to have disappeared
then—until you met him on the boat
deck. That was just before midnight.”
SANTA FORTUNA

  Blaisdell tossed down the whisky
neat.

  “This is pretty serious, Blaisdell,”
McRory said. “You realize that, since
Miss Reyes seemed to know O’Brian,
it’s going to be difficult for her.”

  “I think her part is simple and easily
explained,” said Blaisdell. “Cunning-
ham pointed O’Brian out to her in
Maracaibo as a suspicious character.
When he appeared on the boat deck she
was sure he didn’t belong there. I hap-
pened along. She told me. I went off
to look for him—found him—he
jumped me. And when I didn’t come
back, she reported the matter to the
bridge.”

  “Sounds simple,” McRory admitted.
His bushy white brows knit in a scowl.
“But that doesn’t explain the murder
of Cunningham. Nothing was dis-
turbed in the room.”

  “I’m not surprised. The man who
killed him didn’t go inside. He’d have
moved the body from the door. Have
you located anyone who heard a shot?”
“No,” said McRory. “No one.” He
sighed. “This will be out of my hands
when we dock. There’ll be more trouble
coming when the police come aboard.”
“I’m sure of it,” said Blaisdell. “I’d
better see the doctor and turn in. Good
night.”

AN insistent rapping awoke Blaisdell
in the morning. A steward’s voice
answered his sleepy response. “The
captain wishes you in his suite, sir.”
“Coming,” Blaisdell yawned; then
memory wiped his mind awake and he
came to his feet with a rush. The ship’s
engines were silent. It was as if the life
had gone out of the great steel hull—as
if the Santa Fortuna herself had died.

  Blaisdell smiled grimly as he stepped
to the port. Death was on his mind.
His watch showed the hour as seven-

thirty. Through the porthole he made
out the gray front of a dock shed. He
looked out and saw people moving down
there on the dock. But they wrere not
passengers. Inside the dock shed he
could see the customs men standing
idle. The investigation of Cunning-
ham’s death must be holding up every-
thing.

  When he went out on deck, two uni-
formed policemen were standing by the
gangway head. The captain’s door was
open. A voice, not McRory’s, answered
his knock. “Are you Blaisdell?”

   “I am,” Blaisdell said, and entered.

  Three men were in the captain’s
room. They were smoking cigarettes.
All three of them eyed him with pro-
fessional estimation.

  The nearest one said, “Captain Mc-
Rory had to leave. Have a seat.” He
smiled. “I’m Noel Hoffman, of the
Federal Bureau of Investigation, This
is Mr. Metcalf, and Mr. Dixon, from
headquarters.”

  The two detectives nodded. They
were both short. Metcalf was chunky;
Dixon was slender and older by some
years. Gray was cropping out in his
black hair.

  Hoffman was the youngest of the
three. Younger by a year or so than he
himself was, Blaisdell guessed. He was
trim, unobtrusive. But once he’d got
your attention, you realized that there
was a tremendous lot of keen energy
and cold, controlled intelligence hidden
underneath. Blaisdell respected, liked
him at once.

  “So the F. B. I. is interested
in this,” Blaisdell commented, taking
the chair.

  “The Department has jurisdiction
over crimes on the high seas. And
while the Santa Fortuna was not
exactly on the high seas, she had not
docked when this man was killed. . . .
36

ARGOSY

Captain McRory tells us you were at-
tacked on the boat deck last night."

  “I was," said Blaisdell. “Have they
found the man who did it?”

 “Not a trace; he apparently
vanished.”

  “Then he went overboard,” Blaisdell
said. His eyes narrowed at the implica-
tion. “He went over the side while the
ship was bucking the current at full
speed. Which means he had to clear the
propeller by a miracle—and then swim
to shore. And in the middle of the
night, with the current running like it
is, with everything from possible alli-
gators and alligator gars to sucks and
whirls and logs waiting to drag him
under, that calls for another miracle.
Once ashore he had to get somewhere
in a hurry, which in itself is no small
feat so far down the river.” Blaisdell
leaned forward. “Do you think he left
the ship that way—and got ashore ?”
“He isn’t aboard,” said Hoffman.
“And a neat guess you’ve made. The
bow lookout remembers a curious light
on the east bank about that time. Per-
haps a flashlight. It went on and off
several times. He forgot it until he was
questioned this morning.”

  “The idiot should have reported it,”
Blaisdell said. “The road along the
river, from Fort Jackson, could have
been blocked by radio.” Blaisdell went
on thoughtfully. “Someone had made
careful plans, to the smallest detail—
even to the Santa Fortuna’s passing
that particular spot when she did—and
the plans clicked perfectly.”

  “Even to killing Cunningham,”
Hoffman suggested.

  “Yes.”

  Hoffman was not, apparently, speak-
ing for the two city detectives; but
Blaisdell had the feeling the three of
them had talked all this over, and had
left to Hoffman the task of questioning
him.

  “Interesting,” Hoffman murmured.
“How did you happen to be 011 the boat
deck with Miss—er—Reyes, at pre-
cisely the time to meet him?”

VI	^HEY knew her right name. Blais-
dell wondered how much more
they knew. “That was a good lead-up.
I’m afraid I can’t match it. Miss Reyes
ran into me in the dark. She had seen
O’Brian, couldn’t understand how he
was aboard, and was upset. She told
me. I looked for the fellow—and found
him,” Blaisdell finished ruefully, touch-
ing his sore scalp.

  “He tried to kill you?”

  “I thought so at the time.”

  “Yet he left you there on the deck
when he could have dumped you over
the side.”

  “That has been puzzling me. I’m also
puzzled as to how a shot was fired at
Cunningham without anyone hearing
it.”

  Hoffman drummed his fingers lightly
on the chair arm. “A Weblev air pistol
was used; at least we think it was a
W'ebley from the shape of the pellet
that was recovered. It’s an English
make. There would be no sound.”
“Could an air pistol have made such
a brutal hole?”

  “I looked up the ballistics,” Hoffman
said. “The .22 Webley pellets have a
310 muzzle velocity. At a foot or two
it’s a wonder more damage wasn’t
done.” Hoffman leaned forward.
“What do you know about Miss
Reyes ?”

  The quickly veiled look of interest in
Hoffman’s eyes wasn’t necessary to put
Blaisdell on his guard. “Why should I
know anything about her? I had never
seen her before she came aboard at Cu-
racao. I didn’t speak to her before we
met on the boat deck last night.”
Hoffman’s cigarette had died out. He
SANTA FORTUNA

37

got to his feet and dropped it in an
ash receiver.

  “We’d like to know more about her
than she seems willing to tell,” he
stated.

  “What did she tell?”

  Hoffman’s thin smile might have
meant anything. “Probably not nearly
so much as she’s already told you.”
Blaisdell flushed angrily.

  “What makes you think she’s con-
fided in me at all?” he demanded. “I’ve
already told you I never saw—”

  “Yes, of course. Sorry. Thank you,
Mr. Blaisdell. Passengers will be going
ashore shortly. By the way, you’re with
the Delta Corporation, I believe. An
executive ?”

  “One of the juniors—very junior,”
said Blaisdell, standing up.

  “You can be reached at your office,
I suppose.”

   “A telephone call will do,” Blaisdell
said. “Sorry I can’t help you more,
gentlemen.”

  Metcalf, the chunky headquarters
detective, spoke for the first time. His
voice was a husky drawl. “You did
pretty well.” The ghost of a satisfied
grin was on Metcalf’s face.

"OLAISDELL carried that memory
away. The grin bothered him. He
had an annoying impression that he had
been on trial, and had made a poor
showing. Too late now to do anything
about it. He went in search of Anita
Stoddard.

  Her stateroom door was standing
ajar. A woman was speaking inside. “I
guess this is all, Arch.”

  The brisk voice was not Anita Stod-
dard’s. Blaisdell hesitated—and a man
opened the door, and looked startled
and annoyed to see Blaisdell standing
there.

  Blaisdell kept his face blank as he

recognized the sun-tanned, well built

husband of the leggy Mrs. Simpson.
Mrs. Simpson had just spoken beyond
the door. On the floor inside were three
traveling bags. Anita Stoddard was not
in the stateroom.

  Simpson said, “You startled me. If
you're looking for Miss Reyes, she’s
gone ashore with the police to inspect
some rogue’s gallery pictures. She left
suddenly and asked Mrs. Simpson to
pack her bags.”

  “Is she under arrest?”

  “No, of course not. Why should she
be?”

  “You never can tell in matters like
this,” said Blaisdell. “She’s coming
back, I suppose.”

  “I don’t think so,” Simpson said.
“She asked us to put her bags through
the customs and take them to the Lee-
land Hotel where we’re stopping.”
Simpson was holding a straight-
stemmed brier pipe. He pulled on it a
second, and said, “Nasty business, eh?
How’s your head this morning?”
“Doing nicely, thanks. Miss Reyes
is fortunate to have friends to help
her.”

  “We’re glad to do what we can,”
Simpson nodded. “Any message we can
deliver?”

   “I don’t believe so, thanks.”

   Blaisdell crossed the ship to his own
stateroonv^He was wondering about
the Simpsons. You met their type about
the world, polished, competent, restless.
You couldn’t tell much about them. But
because Moreles seemed to know them,
they would probably be worth keeping
an eye on.

   Grigsby, the bandy-legged little room
steward, squashed out a cigarette as
Blaisdell entered his cabin, and smiled
sheepishly. “Just catching a bit of rest,
sir, and wondering when your bags’d
be ready.”
38

ARGOSY

  “Have them for you in a jiffy.”

  “So many passengers’ve been asking
when they can go ashore, I got fair
tired of answering.”

  Blaisdell nodded. From the corner of
his eye he saw that Grigsby was shift-
ing nervously from one foot to the
other. The little steward had something
on his mind.

  “I suppose the detectives questioned
you.”

  Grigsby shook his head. “Not yet.
You wouldn’t be knowing, sir, if they’re
finding who killed the old gentleman?”
“No luck yet, I guess. Why?”

  “I was just wondering, sir. . . .”
“Out with it, Grigsby. What’s on
your mind?”

  “I don’t like to talk. Indeed I don’t,
sir. If you hadn’t been almost done in
by that fellow from the engine room
gang, I wouldn’t say nothing. But, see-
ing as you spoke with the police this
morning, I thought—”

  “Let’s have it,” said Blaisdell, serious
now. “What's worrying you?”

  Grigsby swallowed. “I’m not one to
put suspicion on an innocent man, Mr.
Blaisdell. But I just wondered if the
detectives were showing any curiosity
about Mr. Moreles.”

  “What about him?”

  But before Grigsby could answer,
they were frozen by the sound of a
woman’s scream that knifed along the
passage. She screamed again as Blais-
dell swung to the door, jerked it open.

  She was running toward him, crying,
sobbing—it was one of the steward-
esses. She would have fled past Blais-
dell if he had not blocked her way,
caught her arms, stopped her.

“What is it?” he demanded sharply.
Her eyes were wide with horror; she*
was almost incoherent as she cried
wildly, “There’s another one! He’s
dead! I walked in and didn’t know he

was there! He’s on the bed! His
tongue’s sticking out! His eyes are pop-
ping!'Oh, it’s awful!”

  Blaisdell shook her. “Steady! Wrho
is it?”

  She wailed: “That South American!
That man with the little black mus-
tache! I think I’m going to faint. . .

CHAPTER IV

LOCK THE BARN DOOR

RIGSBY, the bandy-legged little
steward, stood in the stateroom
doorway with a gray pallor of dazed
uncertainty on his face. Blaisdell thrust
his limp burden into Grigsby’s arms.
“Here! Take her!”

  “What’ll I do with her?” Grigsby
stammered.

  “Put her in your pocket! Throw her
out the porthole! Hide her under the
bed! What the devil do I care what you
do with her!” Blaisdell retorted—and
was off down the passage with long
strides.

  Once in a lifetime a thing like this
came along, piling disaster on disaster;
a thing that topped the unbelievable
with the impossible—that knocked a
situation into a cocked hat and scattered
the fragments irretrievably.

  Cunningham’s murder had been bad
enough. The stage had been set for it.
No one had been expecting it. But this
—this last murder—was a slap, a chal-
lenge, a dare from fate.

  Moreles was dead. Useless to imagine
that the stewardess could have meant
anyone else.

  The little South American had a
stateroom near the end of the passage-
way. And that Moreles could afford the
price of a good cabin was as good a
pointer as any to the devious channels
of graft he had explored while serving
the old dictator.
SANTA FORTUNA

39

  The door was closed. Terrified, hys-
terical, the stewardess had slammed it
as she fled, but she had left her key in
the spring lock. Blaisdell opened the
door and stopped. Moreles’ body was
there on the bed, in boldly striped blue
silk pajamas. It was lying at an angle
across the bed. His eyes were bulging,
popping; his tongue was black: his face
congested, and he was dead—dead for
hours.

  Blaisdell knew it was death before he
reached the bed and touched the stiff
cold wrist. Armando Moreles had not
died pleasantly. A white silk handker-
chief, twisted tightly, encircled his
swollen throat like a savage mockery of
other handkerchiefs worn in the late
afternoon tennis games to which More-
les had been always hurrying from his
Curacao office. White teeth clamped on
the dark swollen tongue, as if in death
the dapper little man was biting back
the secrets which had lurked in the
crooked channels of his mind. One pal-
lid lid was half down over a bulging
eye, giving the effect of a macabre
wink, as if in dying Moreles knew he
was taking with him one last secret—
his greatest secret—the secret of his
death.

  Two bags had been opened. The con-
tents were scattered recklessly on the
floor. Locker drawers were open. The
pillow cases were off. The mattress had
been lifted up, dropped carelessly back,
so that it overhung at the head of the
bed.

  “Holy cow!” That was Mendenhall,
a fleshy broker who had boarded the
Santa Fortuna at Rio de Janeiro. Men-
denhall looked slightly ill as he regarded
the body on the bed. “And I’ve been
next to that ever since I got up!’' he
gulped.

  “That’s right—you have the next
cabin, haven’t you?” Blaisdell said

crisply. “You didn’t hear any sounds in
here three or four hours ago, did you?”
Mendenhall was passing a handker-
chief over his pudgy face. He shook his
head silently.

  A crowd was gathering in the pas-
sage. Breathless exclamations, shuffling
feet, questions back and forth, were
growing louder by the moment.
Through that came the burly broad-
shouldered figure of one of the two
patrolmen who had been guarding the
head of the gangway.

  “Dead, huh? Who’s dead? They
could have heard that woman yelling
clear to Canal Street. . . . Who did
that?”

  “Try guessing. You may get an an-
swer. Where are those detectives who
were up in the captain’s quarters?”
“They’ll be here! The whole ship’ll
be here! Say— who’re you anyway,
mister?”

  Blaisdell was suddenly angry, irri-
tated. This second killing was bad
enough. But here he was, for the second
time one of the first persons at the scene
of murder.

  A booming voice of authority rang
along the passage as Captain McRory
ordered the people out of the way. Then
McRory was there; and Hoffman, the
Department of Justice man, and Met-
calf, the short chunky headquarters
detective, with his partner Dixon.

  McRory, red-faced and bull-like, took
one look at the bed and blew up. “An-
other one! What kind of a jinx has hit
this ship?”

  “A two-legged jinx!” said Blaisdell
grimly. “And if you ask me, he had
strong hands.”

  “What? You here, Blaisdell? Are
you tangled up in this one, too?”

  The beefy patrolman said, “Ha!” He
fixed a suspicious stare on Blaisdell,
and said, “He was in here when I got
40

ARGOSY

here! Giving orders like he was running
the place!”

  “Rats!” said Blaisdell. “My state-
room is down the passage. I heard the
stewardess scream. She told me what
she found. I came to see.”

  Metcalf hunched his chunky shoul-
ders and grinned again as he had
grinned up in the captain’s quarters—
a knowing grin. Going over to the bed,
he touched the face, lifted the head
slightly, felt underneath the neck, test-
ing the white silk handkerchief. “Knot-
ted in the back," he said. “And a sweet
job.”

  Noel Hoffman, calm, trim, had gone
tc the bed. He lifted one of Moreles’
arms an inch or so and dropped it. He
grasped an ankle next and lifted it. The
leg seemed to come up more loosely, to
fall more loosely, with a certain limp-
ness.

  “Rigor hasn’t worked down into the
lower extremities yet,” said Hoffman.
“I make it three to six hours, Dixon.
How about it?”

  Dixon tried the leg. He nodded.
“About that. A little before the boat
docked, eh? I’d put it before day-
break.”

T T OFFMAN spoke to the two head-
quarters men. “Well, boys, this
one’s in your front yard—and I’ll be
darned if I know myself whether any
of it belongs to me.” Hoffman looked
about the stateroom. “Robbery,” he
said. “It could be that and nothing else.
That is. if someone had reason to be-
lieve Moreles was keeping valuables in
here instead of in the ship’s safe. Who
is he, anyway, captain? Could he have
had anything in here worth stealing?”
Captain McRory looked baffled,
angry, harassed. “How do I know what
he had with him ? The purser might be
able to tell you something. I think this

fellow came aboard at La Guaira.
That’s the port for Caracas. And that’s
all I know!”

  “Caracas!” said Hoffman. “And the
other fellow who was killed last night
came from Maracaibo! Blaisdell, how
about this? D’you think the same fellow
who killed Cunningham might have got
at this man ?”

  “I don’t think,” said Blaisdell. “In
the captain’s cabin a little while ago you
assured me there wasn’t a chance of
that man being aboard. All the signs
indicated he had jumped overboard last
night while we were coming up the
river.”

   Hoffman’s stare was cold, level for a
moment. He nodded. “That’s right.
Just the same—it makes one wonder.
Two murders—both of the victims
coming out of Venezuela. It’s an
astonishing coincidence, to say the
least.”

  “You can’t hang a man on a coin-
cidence.”

  “Yeh? Maybe not.” said Metcalf.
“But you can catch him on the coinci-
dence and hang him later. The guy who
did this must still be aboard. L'liless
this ship was running a swimming
marathon all night last night.”

  Captain McRory looked startled.
“Still aboard! I forgot!” he exclaimed
with chagrin. “You gave the word to
let the passengers go ashore. The gang-
way's open.”

  Metcalf leaped for the door. “Hey,
you!” he blared at the broad-backed
patrolman outside. “Are the passengers
going ashore?”

  “Sure, an’ I thought you knew it.
They was going ashore when the lady
first yelled.”

  “Stop them, you lunk! You ought’ve
had better sense than to let ’em keep
going after you heard a woman
scream!”
SANTA FORTUNA

41

  “We had our orders. What else do
you expect?”

   Metcalf slammed the door.

   Dixon had rolled the body half over.
With difficulty he was untieing the
knots in the handkerchief. He swore
before he was through; finally he
turned, untwisting the handkerchief. It
was a large one—a man’s.

   Metcalf stooped, and from the scat-
tered contents of the traveling bags
picked up another large silk handker-
chief. The letters A.M. were em-
broidered in one corner. He compared
them with similar letters on the hand-
kerchief he had untied, and sighed
disgustedly. “Killed him with his own
handkerchief! I thought for a minute
we had something! I might have known
better.”

   Dixon stood for a moment scowling,
and spoke to Metcalf. “Call headquar-
ters. Tell the boys to come back and
photograph and fingerprint this room.
Ask for a half dozen men. We can’t
hold these passengers all day.” Dixon
looked at Blaisdell. “Nothing you can
tell us about this?”

   “Nothing.” said Blaisdell. He wanted
to think; he wanted to question
Grigsby, the bandy-legged little stew-
ard. who had had Moreles’ name on his
lips when the stewardess screamed.

   “I guess that's all then. We’ll call
you later if there’s anything.”

T)LATSDELL was not surprised to
find Grigsby waiting in the state-
room. behind the closed door. The air
inside was blue with cigarette smoke.
Grigsby was pacing nervously back and
forth. His face, as Blaisdell entered,
mirrored anxiety and apprehension.
“He’s dead?” said Grigsby.

   “Garroted with a silk handkerchief.
What happened to the stewardess?”

   “I give her to two of the crew an’

told them to take her to the doctor,”
said Grigsby.

   Blaisdell had closed the door and
lighted a cigarette. “What were you
going to tell me—about Moreles?”
Grigsby gulped. “I'm a fair one for
getting into trouble! I wish I’d kept my
mouth shut, sir. It wasn’t nothing much.
It didn't have anything to do with this.”
“Let’s have it anyway.”

   “Well, sir, it’s this way; it was kind
of on my mind, sir, last night.” Grigsby
glanced at the open port and lowered
his voice. “Last night near eleven—
maybe it was a little before or after—I
turned into the port passage and this
South American fellow was standing
before Mr. Cunningham's door. Just
standing there, with a cigarette in his
mouth, kind of like he’d just lighted it.
I didn’t think nothing of it at the time.”
“That may have been all he did stop
for,” said Blaisdell.

   Grigsby nodded. He seemed to snatch
at the suggestion with quick hope.
“That’s what I think, sir. I do now, sir.
thinkin’ back. But it did set on my mind
a little. You see. sir, he was facing a
little toward the door—like he might
have been knocking on it”

   “Why didn’t you report it?”

  Grigsby sighed. “The company
wouldn’t thank me for putting suspicion
on a passenger. If I talked out of turn
an' was wrong, I’d be in a fix. wouldn’t
I ? With the company an' with the
police. Jobs are hard to get now, sir.
I’m steady-like an’ don't like to be out
of work. And the law fair scares me,
it does. I’ve never had nothing to do
with the law, sir. But it was on my
mind—and seeing as you had a little
something to do with that other matter,
sir. I thought I’d mention Mr. Moreles
to you this morning. I didn't have no
idea he was already dead! What'll I do,
42

ARGOSY

  “That,” said Blaisdell, “is up to you,
Grigsby. You don’t know anything
about his death. You didn’t see much
last night. As you say, Moreles merely
paused to light a cigarette.”

  “That’s right, sir,” said Grigsby
eagerly. “That's all I saw.”

  “If you get into this you may be held
as the material witness. You may not
even be questioned. It’s up to you.”
Grigsby digested that. His face
cleared. He looked relieved, as if he had
come to a decision. “Thank you, sir;
I'll bear that in mind. And I’ll be leav-
ing this ship, sir, I will indeed. I'll be
back for your bags when you’re ready
to go ashore.”

  Blaisdell had not yet packed. After
Grigsby had left, Blaisdell finished his
cigarette thoughtfully. He tried to value
Grigsby’s information. It was startling
in view of what he himself knew about
Moreles. But to the police it would
probably mean nothing. Could Moreles,
Blaisdell wondered, have killed Cun-
ningham? Then what about O’Brian,
the vanished coal-passer? O’Brian had
been guilty of something. He wouldn’t
have been up on the boat deck ready to
fight if cornered, if he hadn’t. He
wouldn’t have vanished.

  Even granting that Moreles had
killed Cunningham—who had killed
Moreles ? And why ? Moreles had been
friendly with the Simpsons—and they
were friendly with Anita Stoddard.

  Well, Anita Stoddard’s traveling
companion and Moreles both were dead!
And it made a meaningless puzzle, com-
plicated by the air of furtive knowledge
Moreles had borne toward Anita
Stoddard.

  A knock drew Blaisdell to the door.
A group of brisk-looking and deter-
mined young men were crowding the
passage outside.

  “Will you make a statement for the
press, Mr. Blaisdell?”

  “What happened on the boat deck
last night, Mr. Blaisdell ?”

  “Do you know anything about this
business down the hall?”

  “Hold it, Tony!”

 Flash____

BLAISDELL blinked as a flash bulb
went off. The lens of a camera
which had appeared suddenly over a
shoulder caught his annoyed frown.
The grinning photographer was Benny
Hyde, who had been a Tulane man in
Blaisdell’s class.

  “Loosen up, Tony,” Benny said.
“You’ll have to give sooner or later.
You can’t dodge this story.”

  Blaisdell’s smile was rueful. “Evi-
dently not, with you leading the pack,
Benny. Come in, gentlemen.”

  Blaisdell had forgotten the press; he
might, he thought, have known this
was coming. The newspaper men had
been kept off the ship until now. They
were being barred from the Moreles
cabin for the moment. They made up
for the delay by a furious barrage of
questions. And when they had gotten
all Blaisdell would tell them, they
bolted out to catch the next edition.

  Benny Hyde, thin and bubbling with
cheerfulness, promised as he went out,
“I’ll see you at the office later, Tony.
If you get anything, save it for me.
This ship’s turning into a charnel
house. So long, fella.”

  Blaisdell finished his packing and
then there was another knock on the
door. Tony jerked around, eased his
jumping nerves, took a breath and
called out a “Come in,” that sounded
reasonably cool.

  “I say, old man, I’ve been looking
for you.” Simpson was grave. He
looked concerned. “Bad business, this,
eh?” Simpson pulled his briar pipe out
of his pocket and fingered it nervously.
SANTA FORTUNA

43

His eyes, gray and steady, lingered on
Blaisdell's face for a moment and
dropped to the pipe.

  “Something happened last night,”
said Simpson. “I didn't think much of
it at the time. But you seemed to know
this chap Moreles—and I wonder if
it'd mean anything to you.”

  “I knew him only slightly.”

  “Yes, of course. And so did we—
only slightly,” said Simpson hastily.
“He scraped up an acquaintance with
Mrs. Simpson and myself for some
reason or other. We still don’t know
exactly why.” Simpson looked straight-
forward enough—and yet he was wan-
dering around the point and doing a
clumsy best to create assurance. Blais-
dell waited. Simpson shook his head,
frowned, and went on.

  “For some reason or other Moreles
came to our stateroom last night after
poor Cunningham’s body was found.
He seemed to want to talk about it—
talk about Cunningham and Miss—
Reyes.”

  “Stoddard, you mean, don’t you?”
Simpson stared at him. “Er—yes, of
course. Well—Moreles ambled on and
suddenly looked at us like a sharp little
rat and asked if Royal 709l/2 meant
anything to us. It didn’t. I was rather
curt with him. He took the hint and
left—met you outside the door I
noticed—and the next thing we heard
was the news this morning that he had
been murdered.”

  “Royal 709^ ?"

  “Yes. You seemed friendly with him
—you were one of the first at his body
this morning, weren’t you?—and I was
wondering if the number meant any-
thing to you.” Simpson’s manner was
disarmingly innocent.

  “He didn’t mention it to me,” said
Blaisdell.

  Simpson shook his head. “I didn't

think much of it last night—but since
he’s dead. I’ve been puzzling over his
question. There’s a Royal Street, of
course, in the French Quarter. I was
wondering if it wasn’t an address there.
And why he asked us if we knew any-
thing about it.”

  “What do the detectives think?”
Simpson shrugged. “I haven’t men-
tioned it. Matter of fact, neither Mrs.
Simpson nor myself want to get messed
up in the business. One thing and an-
other, it’d mean we’d have to bring
Anita Stoddard into it. She’s got
enough to shoulder as it is.”
“Thoughtful of you.”

  “Not at all, not at all. We like her
no end. And we’re considering ourselves
also.”

  “How long have you known her?”
Simpson gave him a stare. “Some
years,” he said briefly, and it was plain
he didn’t care to go into the matter
further. He slipped the pipe back into
his pocket. “If you don’t know any-
thing, you don’t,” he said.

  “Just a minute,” Blaisdell stopped
him. “Are you going to report this?”
“Not until after we see Miss Stod-
dard,” Simpson said stiffly. He nodded
and walked away.

  Blaisdell stared at the man’s straight
back. Queer. Some purpose there. The
yarn didn’t ring true. It might be a

CHAPTER V

ROYAL STREET

TOLAISDELL left the ship as soon
as possible. He spoke briefly to
Hoffman before going ashore and re-
ceived leave to disembark. He boarded
a taxi that dropped him on Royal
Street—old Royal Street, narrow,
44

ARGOSY

grimy, shabby with generations and
centuries of living and dying under the
French, the Spanish and the Americans.

 The proud old days were gone;
ghosts only were left; ghosts of the
past lingering in the handwrought iron
balconies overhanging the sidewalks,
the damp old houses, shadowy and
crumbling, the mossy courtyards back
out of sight where vivid memories of
the past hid and sulked from the noisy
clamor of the present.

  Blaisdell had always liked the French
Quarter—and now as he paused on the
sidewalk opposite, he saw with a tin-
gling rise in his pulses that there was a
709 J/2. Somehow he hadn’t been sure #
there would be. He patted the small
automatic he’d put inside his coat be-
fore coming ashore, and then renewed
his inspection of Number 709}£.

  It was one of the older houses, two
stories high, with a courtyard reached
by a carriage entrance through a
vaulted archway bisecting the front of
the house. Solid wooden gates on huge
iron hinges barred the carriage en-
trance, and there was a house door to
the right and a door to the left. The
windows were shuttered and the house
seemed deserted.

  Next door, from a smaller, narrower
house, a fat woman emerged and began
sweeping the sidewalk. Blaisdell crossed
over and spoke to her.

  “Who lives in that house next door?”

  She had more than a trace of a black
mustache on which tiny droplets of
perspiration clung, and she stopped
sweeping, and looked at him sus-
piciously.

  “Whassa matter you as’ me?” she
demanded.

  “Sorry,” said Blaisdell. “I’m merely
curious.”

  “Tha’s wha’ one young lady as’ me—
an’ I tella her the same; I don’ know.

Two—t’ree day someone there. She
knock—she go-a in. She’s-a in there
now. Maybe you try, eh?’’

  “Young lady?” said Blaisdell
quickly. “What did she look like?”

  “Ah—so!” He received a knowing
look. “Blacka dress, blacka hair, an’
she’s-a look like an angel—so high.”
“Thanks,” he said.

  So Anita Stoddard also knew about
the number. Blaisdell walked to the
next door, beside the carriage entrance,
and knocked. The fat lady leaned on
her broom and watched him.

  Twice he had to knock—then a
youngish woman opened the door. Red-
headed, pretty in a flamboyant way, her
lips were too bold and red, and an un-
conscious challenge was in her look.
This, certainly, was not a face like an
angel’s.

  “I’m looking tor the young lady who
came in here a little while ago,” Blais-
dell said.

  She was chewing gum, estimating
him. “What young lady?” she coun-
tered.

  “The one in black. Will you tell her
Blaisdell is here?”

  “Oh! You’re with her?”

“Just give her my name, please.”
Instead she smiled and stepped back.
“Come in. I’ll tell her.” Blaisdell en-
tered and she closed the door. The shut-
tered windows cut off most of the light.

    room had a damp musty smell, the
odor of a place little lived in. The few
pieces of furniture looked old, worn.

  And the red-headed girl paused and
said, “Anyone else with you?”

  “I’m alone,” said Blaisdell.

  He thought she looked relieved.
“Well, you ain’t now. Sit down here.
I’ll go get her. Funny she didn’t say
anything about you. Maybe I oughta
open the shutters. I’ll do it when I come
back. Just sit there.”
SANTA PORTUNA

  She disappeared through a door at
the back of the room, behind Blaisdell’s
chair. With the closing of the door,
silence fell. Street sounds were so
muted that Blaisdell had the feeling he
was far from the outside world. The
silence had a quality almost ominous.
Blaisdell suddenly realized the back of
his neck was tight and cold with an
unaccountable feeling of danger.

HE sat for a moment restlessly, and
then yielded to his itching desire
to rove about. He moved silently to the
door, listened a moment, opened it
gently. Beyond was a short passage
dimly lighted by a half-open door at
the other end; and when he reached the
door he saw an enclosed stairway lead-
ing up, and through the door before
him the mossy bricks of a patio pave-
ment and a tall graceful clump of bam-
boo at the back of the patio.

  Hand in his pocket. Blaisdell stepped
into the doorway—and stopped sud-
denly as he saw two men in the middle
of the patio, coming toward him. The
red-headed girl was following them.
One of the men was about Blaisdell’s
height, with dark stubble on his thin
face. The other had a swarthy skin,
powerful shoulders, long arms, and car-
ried a revolver.

  The mustache had been shaved. Blais-
dell saw as he jerked the automatic
from his pocket, but the lips looked
swollen, and he knew instantly this
must be O’Brian, the man he had
battled with on the Santa Fortum’s
boat deck, the man he suspected of
killing Cunningham!

  O’Brian saw him the same instant—
and fired as he saw Blaisdell’s auto-
matic come out. The crashing shot
spewed splinters against Blaisdell’s
right cheek and eye as the bullet
smashed the door beside his head. A

splinter struck his right eyeball, blind-
ing him. and he dodged back and
slammed the door.

  The second man had also drawn a
gun. Blaisdell backed along the passage,
dabbing at his eye and trying to see
with the other the opening of the door.

  But the door did not open. An auto-
mobile engine filled the patio with the
rush of its exhaust. Blaisdell realized
the car had been standing in the
carriage-way through the building, and
now was leaving. He turned and
stumbled into the front room. A door
there led into the carriage-way. It was
locked. By that time Blaisdell dis-
covered that, the automobile had gone
over the sidewalk into the street.

   Still half blinded with tears, Blaisdell
ran to the front door, and found it also
locked. The red-headed girl had turned
a key and removed it while she stood
there and directed him to a chair.

  Swearing under his breath. Blaisdell
ran back to the patio door. His eyes
were clearing. The splinter had not
penetrated the eyeball and the tears had
washed it away. Mopping his eyes with
a handkerchief, he opened the door and
stood flat against the wall for an in-
stant, and then ducked out into the
patio ready to shoot.

  The patio was empty. The automo-
bile had been no ruse to bring him out
into the open. The great wooden doors
at the other end of the carriage-way
stood open now to the sidewalk and the
street, and there were black drops of oil
on the old bricks at his left where the
car had stood.

  Sick with apprehension. Blaisdell
started for the sidewalk. Then, sud-
denly, the sweetest sound he had ever
heard came out of the patio behind him.

  “Mr. Blaisdell!”

  Anita Stoddard was there, running
toward him from the back of the patio,
46

ARGOSY

lovely and stunning in the slim sheath
of a black dress. And as Blaisdell went
to meet her he thought the delicate
fairness of her features had all the
breathtaking contrast of a fragile
white orchid against a black velvet
background.

  She was laughing—and close to tears
—as they met. “You—Anthony Blais-
dell ! How can you be here? How could
you be here in time?”

  “They got away,” Blaisdell said.
“How many were there?”

  “Three—two men and a girl.”
“They’re all gone then. If I’d known
one of them was O’Brian I’d not have
been such a stupid idiot as to let it
happen!” Blaisdell groaned. “What
brought you here ?”

  “Vera Simpson told me this man
Moreles—”

  “Simpson told me!” Blaisdell broke

in.

  “I had to see what he meant.”

  “You should have told me and let me
come.”

  She said, “I could not wait. As soon
as I could get away from the police, I
went to see Mr. Haughton, and then be-
cause he was so busy for a little, I came
here. And the girl answered the door,
and I said that Mr. Moreles had sent
me, and she was astonished and asked
me to come in. And when I was in—
suddenly there was this man O’Brian
in the room—and they asked me ques-
tions, and finally took me to an old
empty room at the back there and
locked me in. There were no windows.
I do not know what they were going to
do next.”

  “Wrhat did they ask you ?”

  “What happened on the ship later
last night,” she said.

  “O’Brian didn’t know?”

  “No. He seemed to know nothing
after his fight with you.”

  “Then he swam ashore,” said Blais-
dell. “The fellow must be like an otter
in the water. What else?”

  “He wanted to know why I was in
New Orleans—and what I would do if
I went back to Venezuela. And I told
him that when I went back I would
keep the Rancho del Sol—and he
sneered at me and said I was too sure.5’
“Then this is all about your estate?”
She shrugged. “So it seems.”

  “Did he say what Moreles had to do
with it?”

  “So queer,” she said, wrinkling her
forehead. “He did not seem to know
about this man Moreles. He asked me
questions—he seemed startled that
Moreles would know this house num-
ber. He did not see how it was possible.
He seemed to think I was not telling
the truth—and I think they wanted to
leave quickly because they did not know
the answer to Moreles. They sent the
girl to watch the front door to see if
anyone was coming.”

  “Perhaps,” said Blaisdell grimly,
“Moreles didn’t know.”

  “But Vera Simpson told me—”
“W'ho are the Simpsons? How long
have you known them ?”

  “Why—why, Vera is an old friend.
I have known her several years. Her
husband is a chemist. They travel much.
I met them by chance in Maracaibo this
time. They were going to Curacao also,
and then on to New Orleans. It was so
nice having Vera on the same boat.”
“What were they doing in Mara-
caibo?”

  “It was some business. Vera said
something about oil. Why do you ask
these questions?” Still wide-eyed, she
protested impulsively, “You can’t think
Vera and her husband.. . ?”

  “I don’t know—I don’t know what
to think,” Blaisdell confessed with a
scowl. “The Simpsons were talking
SANTA FORTUNA

47

with Moreles last night—and this

morning my steward told me he sur-
prised Moreles outside Cunningham’s
door last night, standing there pretend-
ing to light a cigarette—and this morn-
ing the Simpsons have a cock-and-bull
story for both of us about a remark
Moreles dropped to them last night. A
story which draws us both here to a
trap—and yet by the evidence of
O’Brian himself he doesn’t seem to
know Moreles. What’s the answer?
It’s the Simpsons, isn’t it? They—not
Moreles— got us here where O’Brian
is waiting.”

  “No—no! Not Vera! We will find
this man Moreles and see what he has
to say.”

  “He’s dead,” Blaisdell told her.
“Moreles was murdered this morning
some time before daybreak. Garroted in
his own stateroom.”

  She was stunned, sick, horrified. And
bewildered.

  “Why should he have been mur-
dered ?” she cried.

  “Quicn sabef” said Blaisdell.

  “This is so terrible! What is happen-
ing? What can we do?” she cried in
distress.

  “We can get a police alarm out about
O’Brian,” said Blaisdell. “Did you find
any trace of him at headquarters? Or
get a good look at the car they had
here? Or notice the license number?”
“No. At headquarters I looked at so
many pictures I was dizzy, and none of
thdm I could recognize. And I think the
automobile was a dark color—perhaps
black. That is all I saw’ when they took
me through the patio. Must we tell the
police? They are gone. We cannot catch
them. I do not want to be in the news-
papers any more, or explain to the
police any more today. I must go into
the country this evening. I asked Mr.
Haughton if you could come to Desiree

Plantation while I was there, and he
said you were to come.”

  “What is Desiree Plantation?” Blais-
dell asked.

  “It is mine. I must go there quickly.
Can we not forget—this for a little
while anyway ? The Simpsons are com-
ing to Desiree also.”

  She was anxious, pleading, coaxing
—but it was the matter of the Simp-
sons that decided him. To go to the
police now about this latest episode,
would make confusion, delay, publicity
—and probably accomplish little. But if
there was another meeting with the
Simpsons ahead, something might be
accomplished.

  “Stand here,” Blaisdell said. “Scream
if you see anything to alarm you.”
Obediently she stood there while, gun
in hand, he looked hastily around the
place. Many doors were locked; every-
thing he was able to see bore out the
fat woman’s statement that this old
house had not been lived in except for
sketchy use the last day or so.

  Blaisdell came back to Anita Stod-
dard and said: “It’s taking a long
chance—a foolish chance of trouble
with the police—and perhaps more
trouble ahead for you. But if we can
get out of this neighborhood without
having to explain, we’ll forget it for a
little.”

  She smiled then—and it was like the
clouds parting and the warm tingling
sunshine descending, Blaisdell thought.
And if he was a bit giddy with such
thoughts, he was aware of it and didn’t
care.

CHAPTER VI

SAID THE SPIDER TO THE FLY

rjlHEY walked out between the great
open doors into the sunlight wash-
ing shabby Royal Street. The fat worn-
48

ARGOSY

an was gone and no one paid any
attention to them. Blaisdell closed the
doors. They left the old musty house
brooding there and walked a block be-
fore Blaisdell hailed a passing taxicab.

  “Canal and Carondelet,” he said, for
want of anything better, because that
was the nearest the Delta Corporation’s
offices; and when the cab moved on
with them, he asked, “Now what about
Desiree Plantation?”

  “It was a property of my father’s. I
must go there quickly. Please now, will
you drop me at my hotel? I will send
directions to your hotel about Desiree.”
“Why not let me drive you there in
my car?”

  “But an automobile is coming for me.
And you will not be ready so soon. Mr.
Haughton assured me of that.”

  Blaisdell grinned ruefully and told
the driver to go to the Leeland Hotel.

“By the way, who’s going to take you
to the plantation ? And how far is it ?”
“Seventy miles,” she said. “Jack
Carnochan is coming. The Carnochans
live on the place. They were relatives.

I	have never seen them. I radioed them

I	was coming, and I telephoned them
from Mr. Haughton’s office.”

  The taxi pulled to the curb in front
of the Leeland. Blaisdell watched her
quick light steps go up to the entrance;
and then he hurried to the fifth floor
suite of offices which the Delta Corpo-
ration occupied just off Canal Street.

  Sam Haughton was waiting for him.
The Old Man’s roar of welcome echoed
down the hall as Blaisdell walked into
Haughton’s inner office.

  “I’ve been wondering when you’d
get here! Police swarming all over the
place asking questions about you! The
newspapers yammering at the door for
your life history! And Miss Stoddard
telling me what a comfort you are and
pleading for your further services! Sit

  down! Do some fast talking! There’s
a lot of ground to cover in a hurry!
I’ve got to catch the plane to New York
today!”

  The Old Man’s hair was white, up-
standing in a belligerent shock, and his
eyebrows were bushy and challenging.
Sixty, perhaps, he looked under fifty;
and he was tall, spare, powerful. Age
had not changed the spirit which had
run a small grubstake into a tiny gold
mine in the Idaho Rockies, and levered
that mine into a Chilian copper conces-
sion, and then into more concessions,
and finally into the Delta Corporation,
which at one time or another in the past
thirty years had possessed interests in
every republic from the Rio Grande to
the Strait of Magellan. And his voice
was quiet now when Blaisdell paused.
“Who is Armando Moreles?”

  “He was in Caracas; I had to deal
with him on that La Paz matter last
year. He was coming north for his
political health, I thought.”

  “It’s a regrettable mess!” Sam
Haughton grunted. “And I don’t know
whether or not you did right in not
calling the police at once about this
Royal Street matter. It’s done now,
however.” The inter-office telephone
buzzed; the Old Man switched it on and
said, “Yes?”

  Miss Luchs’ voice, from the reception
room, said: “Mr. Shannon and Mr.
Darnford are here.”

  “Two minutes,” said the Old Man,
and cut the connection and spoke re-
gretfully to Blaisdell. “I’ll have to see
them. Get your reports in shape, look at
your mail, and we’ll have a conference
on your trip as soon as possible.”
Blaisdell found his desk stacked with
mail. Before ringing for a secretary, he
glanced in the telephone book, called a
number. A woman’s voice said, “The
Rapp Agency.”

               3	A—24
SANTA FORTUNA

49

  “Mr. Rapp, please.”

  And in a moment a cautious voice
said, “Mr. Rapp speaking.”

  “This is Blaisdell, Rapp, The Delta
Corporation.'1

  Mr. Rapp lost his caution. “Delighted
—a pleasure! How are you, Mr. Blais-
dell?”

  “I’ve a job for you, Rapp. I want the
same service you always give us. A
couple named Simpson are landing
from the Santa Fortuna this morning.
They intended to register at the Lee-
land. Put a man on them—two men—
as many as you need. I want to know
anything you can find out about them,
and everything they do. Keep me per-
sonally posted. And there’s an empty
house at 709^ Royal I want investi-
gated. I want to know who owns it,
who has been there in the last few days,
and who comes there, if anyone, in the
next few days, and what they do. If
anyone but the police come, don’t lose
sight of them. I’m going out of town,

I	believe. I’ll call you later and tell you
where I’ll be.”

  “It will help to know what my men
are looking for, Mr. Blaisdell.”

  “I don’t know myself. Spend all the
money you need to.”

  “That,” cried Mr. Rapp with quick
enthusiasm, “is the way a client should
talk! I’ll have men on all this at once!”

npHERE were stacks of mail. Blais-
-*■ dell was throwing machine-gun
dictation in alternate bursts to two
secretaries when he had to tear himself
away and spend an hour and a half with
the Old Man and three of the Delta
officials, covering the results of his trip.

  By that time he had been subpoenaed
to the inquest of Cunningham’s death
at one-thirty P.M. There was barely
time for a quick lunch—and then he
found himself once more aboard the

 4	A—24

Santa Fortuna, where a double inquest
was being held in the empty cavern of
the lounge.

  Sam Haughton was there with Anita
Stoddard. Hoffman, Hetcalf and Dixon
were there. The Simpsons were not.
And as he sat down beside Anita Stod-
dard, Blaisdell looked over and met
Hoffman's cool stare. He realized sud-
denly that Hoffman must have thought
he was lying when, in the captain’s
cabin, he had denied any knowledge of
Anita Stoddard’s affairs. Hoffman may
have known then that she was going to
the Delta offices.

  The coroner rapped for order and
opened the inquest. He was a dry, quiet
little man who droned perfunctory
questions. Quickly it became apparent
to Blaisdell that little more than a basis
of homicide was being established. He
suspected that no evidence was being
presented which was not already public
property.

  Hoffman came over and spoke to
him.

  “I see,” the Department of Justice
man commented dryly, “you were well
acquainted with Miss Stoddard after
all. She has business with your com-
pany, I gather.”

  “She is a friend of Mr. Haughton’s,”
Blaisdell said noncommitally.

  Hoffman's reply and smile told him
little. “Nice she has friends. He’s al-
ready gone to bat for her, I hear, to
save her all possible annoyance.”

  No—you couldn’t tell what Hoffman
was thinking—but Blaisdell decided as
he hurried back to the office that Hoff-
man was not passing an idle day. The
Simpsons, it was noticeable, were en-
tirely easy about concealing the Royal
Street episode.

  Late in the afternoon, Rapp called.
“The Simpsons registered at the Lee-
land all right,” he declared. “I’m send-
ARGOSY

50

ing over a detailed coverage. None of
it looks important. They shopped with
a Miss Stoddard, for whom they had
engaged a room—the Miss Stoddard,
by the way, who’s splashed all over the
newspapers this afternoon.” Rapp’s
voice grew reproachful. “Why didn’t
you tell us what the hook-up was?”
“Because it was none of your busi-
ness.” Blaisdell told him curtly. “What
about the Royal Street house?”

  “Funny there,” Rapp said. “No-
body’s around. The woman next door
described two people that sound like
you and this Miss Stoddard, whom she
said went in there this morning. Several
people have been in there for a day or
so. . . . She’s not sure when they came.
She thought they’d rented the place. But
the place ain't for rent. It belongs to
some people named Carnochan—”

  “Whatr Blaisdell cried. “Carno-
chan! Are you certain of that?”

  “You bet!” Rapp declared positively.
“They’ve owned it from away back.
They don’t live in town, it seems. We
haven’t located ’em yet. All the old
timers are out of that neighborhood.
Lot of Italians have moved in. But it’s
still known as the old Carnochan
house.” Rapp paused. “Does that mean
anything to you, Mr. Blaisdell ?”

  “I’ve heard the name,” said Blaisdell.
“Never mind trying to locate them.
Watch the house. See if you can find
out who was there.”

  “Sure—sure, if you can’t see your
wray clear to telling us any more,” Rapp
said reproachfully. “Oh, yes, another
thing—the cops were around there
about noon. Just poking around. Almost
caught one of our men in there. He’d
found the front gate unlocked an’
walked in.”

  “What did the police do?”

  “Looked around. A fingerprint man
went in. They chased our man away
when he stalled around and tried to see
what was going on. And they’ve got a
coupla men planted inside now. Our
man counted those who went in an’
came out.”

  “Keep on watching the place,” Blais-
dell directed.

  He hung up with acute misgivings.
What was coming now? What had
brought the police there at noon ? Hoff-
man must have known about the Royal
Street house at the inquest; yet he had
given no sign of it.

  Blaisdell reached for the telephone
and called the Leeland. “Miss Stod-
dard.”

  “Miss Stoddard has checked out.”
Scowling, Blaisdell lighted a ciga-
rette and thought hard. The Carno-
chans ! The people on Desiree planta-
tion. It was too late to stop her, to
warn her. But abruptly Blaisdell de-
cided to follow to the plantation as
quickly as possible. His alarm was
mounting. . . .

TO BE CONCLUDED NEXT WEEK
Pot-

By L. G. BLOCHMAN

Author of "Red Snow at Darjeeling," the
“O’Reilly Sahib" Stories, etc.

BILL HUDSON wasn’t really a
drunkard at heart. Before Tan-
ner was killed, he didn’t take a
dozen drinks a month, which is remark-
ably few for a man stuck away in the
deep interior of China, where alcohol
is a recognized specific for loneliness.
Not that Hudson had any scruples
against tippling; it was just that he
didn’t like the taste of the stuff. When
he did take a snort, he gulped it and
made a face. That’s why I always said
it wasn’t Bill Hudson’s fault that he
started hitting the bottle.

  Of course, the Reverend David
Prentiss would say it was Bill Hud-
son’s fault; that it was the direct result
of weakness of character and lack of
moral stamina. Maybe. But to my way
of thinking, if anybody was to blame
it was the Number One Taipan in the
Shanghai office of the Greater Cathay
Petroleum Co., Ltd. After Tanner’s
ghastly end, he should have sent Hud-
son home on leave, or at least pulled
him in to Shanghai for a few months—
or to Hongkong, or Tientsin, where he
could see white faces and hear music
and laugh a little with girls of his own
race. Anywhere would have been all
right, just so Bill didn’t have to live
with the nightmare of Tanner being
cut to pieces.

  But, no. To the Shanghai office, Bill
Hudson was just a pin stuck in the
sales map of China, instead of a tall,

slender, sandy-haired young man with
serious blue eyes and a shy, boyish
smile. To the Shanghai office, it would
be wasteful and inefficient to transfer
a man who had learned enough of the
local dialect to keep his Comprador
from squeezing the outlying agents too
hard. Moreover, the taipan considered
he was rewarding Hudson with a pro-
motion that meant six hundred a year.
So Hudson was boosted into Tanner’s
place as manager of the district, and I
was sent up to Chiang-Shan as his as-
sistant.

51
52

ARGOSY

  I’d been in Chiang-Shan for about
six weeks without either of us men-
tioning Tanner’s name. I knew the bare
outline of the story, and I thought I
understood how Hudson felt about it;
so I didn’t want to be the one to bring
up the subject. Then one night—we
were both a little tight—Hudson broke
out with all the gory details.

rpHE prime cause of the whole busi-
ness was a little Chinese general
named Ko-tsao. Hudson, who knew
something about brush writing, said
that his name was really K’o-tsao and
meant “Morning Without Dew,” but
that if you wrote it with another set of
characters and changed the pronuncia-
tion by just one apostrophe, it meant
“The Flea.” This is how the people in
Chiang-Shan pronounced the name, be-
cause Ko-tsao had been hopping all
over Central China for years, living off
the blood and substance of the people.
He was smart, and had studied in
America as a Boxer Indemnity Scholar.
He had no ambitions to be a political
tuchun, but maintained his private
army merely to accumulate sufficient
personal fortune to allow him to retire
to a life of leisure and collecting
Twelfth Century paintings on silk.

  Well, Ko-tsao had descended on the
old walled town of Chiang-Shan, and
settled there long enough to gobble up
the revenues of the Salt Gabele, appro-
priate the li-kin duties, impose a few
extra taxes of his own, and dig up
thousands of acres of ginger fields in
order to plant poppies for his own
private opium monopoly. Then Nation-
alist troops from Nanking arrived to
drive him out.

  As bad luck would have it, the
Nationalists arrived during the Chinese
New Year celebration. New Year being
a sort of settling day for Chinese busi-

ness men, all the agents of Greater
Cathay Petroleum had been bringing in
their outstanding accounts, and there
were a good many thousand dollars in
cash in the oil company compound
when the battle started.

  It wasn’t much of a battle, really.
Ko-tsao had got about all he wanted
out of the city anyhow, and he wasn’t
going to risk having his army wiped
out by the Nationalists. He put up just
enough of a rear-guard action to give
his men a chance to do a little last-min-
ute looting. And about a hundred
picked looters made for the oil com-
pany compound, which was on a hill,
a few hundred yards outside the walls
of the town.

  Tanner and Hudson didn’t have
much warning. They’d noticed smoke
drifting over the gray-tiled rooftops
of the walled city, but that was natural
for New Year, because everybody was
burning strings of imitation shoe-
money made out of silver paper. And
it was another hour before they finally
made out the popping of rifles above
the crepitation of New Year fire-
crackers.

  There were six armed Gurkha
guards at the compound, but Tanner
knew thev couldn’t hold out long

O

against an army of looters who had
smelled cash. The only chance of sav-
ing the money would be for one of the
two Europeans to make a break for the
company launch, moored in a creek a
mile away, and then try to sneak
through to the nearest Consulate, which
was a fifty-mile sneak. Tanner tossed
a Yuan dollar to see which one of the
two would take the chance. Bill Hud-
son lost.

  Hudson got to the foot of the hill
before he saw the first stragglers of
Ko-tsao’s army. For nearly half an
hour he ducked in and out of a grove of
POT — VALIANT

53

  lichi trees. Between him and the creek
was a paddy field pimpled with grave
mounds and strewn with matting-cov-
ered coffins waiting for some geoman-
cer to announce a lucky day for burial.
When he thought the coast was clear,
Hudson started across the field. He
was half way across when another
bunch of soldiers began shooting at
him.

  He dropped to cover behind a tem-
porary tomb of whitened brick and
thanked his lucky stars—at least he
thought then they were lucky—for the
burial customs of the Chinese. The
tomb afforded ample protection because
it was as long as a man, and a roof of
gray tiles added to its height. Further-
more, there was a rectangular aperture
at one end to allow the spirit of the de-
parted to come and go at will until final
interment. Hudson opened the satchel
he was carrying and began feverishly
stuffing the money it contained through
the opening into the tomb. He got rid
of the last handful thirty seconds be-
fore the soldiers in gray padded uni-
forms closed in on him.

HUDSON put up no resistance. In
the first place a fight was futile
because there were more armed men
surrounding him than there were cart-
ridges in the magazine of his automatic.
And in the second place he was anxious
to lead the soldiers away from his im-
promptu cache. So he allowed himself
to be disarmed.

  “Shum-mah?” asked Hudson.

  The fat, moon-faced soldier who had
taken his automatic grinned. At first
Hudson thought he was grinning at his
accent, which was closer to Mandarin
than to the local dialect. Then he real-
ized that the Chinese had recognized
him and was grinning with satisfaction
at his own inspiration.

  “You are number two foreign-devil
from the Hill of Oil,” said the soldier.
“You will go with us to the hong.”

  Whereupon Hudson was marched
back -up the hill with twenty rifles
aimed at his immediate rear. He was
the human shield for the raiders, but
he didn’t mind, because he had saved
the company’s bankroll. When he
reached the compound he saw that his
captors had no need of a human shield,
because another and larger band of
enterprising looters had swarmed up
the hill from the other side and had the
situation well in hand.

  The first thing he saw was a Gurkha
guard—dead. Then he saw the rest of
the Gurkhas, herded into a corner. But
before he saw anything at all, he
heard— But I’ll let Hudson tell it:

  “Half way up the hill, I could hear
Tanner screaming,” he said, “but I
didn’t know what it was. It didn’t sound
like a man. It was more like a dog
howling. The howling got fainter as I
got closer, and just as I came into the
compound, it stopped with a kind of a
whimper.

  “Then I saw Tanner, and the sight
turned me inside out. They had strung
him up by his thumbs from the under
side of the big moon gate. His feet
were tied together and hanging six
inches off the sticky red flagstones.
They hadn’t believed him when he told
them there was no money in the place,
and they were torturing him to make
him tell where the cash was hidden.
They were working on him with long
knives, hacking off small pieces of
flesh between questions, taking care not
to cut too deep, not to kill him too
soon!

  “I yelled at them to stop, that I’d
take them to w7here the bankroll was.

I even told them exactly where I’d hid-
den it. But they wouldn’t believe fhe.
54

ARGOSY

They thought I was trying to trick
them into leaving the compound.

  “Tanner was too far gone to speak.
At least he didn’t say anything with his
lips. But his eyes . . . ! Mitch, I can
still see the helpless, hopeless agony of
his eyes, pleading with me to do some-
thing, anything, to put him out of his
misery!

  “Then a Nationalist plane came
swooping over the hill and sprayed
machine-gun bullets into the compound.
That settled it. Ko-tsao’s men saw they
were about to be hemmed in, and they
ran.

  “I cut Tanner down, wondering if
I’d have the guts to do what he wanted
me to. But while I was carrying him
into the house, I discovered I wouldn’t
have to. A machine-gun bullet had
ricocheted off the flag-stones and done
a merciful job.”

  Bill Hudson paused, poured himself
half a tumblerful of straight Scotch,
downed it at one gulp without tasting
it. He made an awful face as he caught
his breath. He asked, “Now do you
know why I’m always a little plastered,
Mitch?”

  “I never blamed you,” I told him.

  He looked at me for a minute, then
shook his head. He laughed—the kind
of a laugh that always gave me the
creeps, because it wasn’t funny.

  “You don’t know a thing about it,”
he said. “It’s not Tanner I’m trying to
get away from. It’s me. I’m afraid,
Mitch. I’m afraid of being afraid. If I
didn’t keep tanked up with Dutch cour-
age, I’d run away, skip the country.
And I can’t do that, Mitch. I don’t
want to be a coward. At least I don’t
want to act like one—when Ko-tsao
comes back.”

  “Forget it,” I told him. “You’re not
a coward. And anyhow Ko-tsao won’t
be back.” I reached for the bottle, too.

  “He’ll come back,” said Hudson.

  And Ko-tsao did.

 A DISAGREEABLE summer was
crawling into its nastiest months.
The lichi nuts had ripened to bright red
clusters glistening like drops of fresh
blood when the hot, sticky rains beat
down on the grove at the foot of the
oil company’s hill. The twisting cobbled
streets of intramural Chiang-Shan,
converted into gloomy corridors by the
matting sun-strips that joined the shop
fronts, stank of fish and sweat and or-
dure. The annual outbreak of cholera
had begun. Coffin-makers’ shops were
piled deep with fresh wood shavings,
and geomancers were swamped with
requests for lucky burial days. Mis-
sionaries whose home boards’ con-
cern for pagan souls was matched by
their generosity, left for the summer
colony at Kuling. Bill Hudson and I
were afire with prickly heat and irrasci-
ble from muggy, sleepless nights, so we
snarled at each other over warm, sick-
ening drinks. At least, whiskey-tajwaw
was sickening to me, without ice. It
didn’t matter to Hudson because he was
still tossing it off neat without tansan.
He was tossing it off at such a rate,
too, that we were down to our last two
quarts, which had to last us until our
next batch of supplies came up from
the company’s regular monthly ship-
ment. And the shipment was late.

  It was a rather complicated business,
getting supplies to Chiang-Shan. They
came up seven hundred miles from
Shanghai by river steamer. Then they
finally reached us overland by coolie
back, wheelbarrow—and by coolie-
drawn barges, when there was enough
water in the creek. They all had to be
handled and rehandled like that: thou-
sands of gallons of kerosene and gaso-
line, paraffine candles, lamps by the
POT — VALIANT

55

gross . . . and our own quota of ciga-
rettes and tinned food and several cases
of whiskey and maybe one of gin. So
a few days’ delay was not unusual.
When the delay lengthened to a week,
however, both of us knew something
was wrong. Both of us had a pretty
good idea what was wrong, too, but
neither of us said anything. Then one
day at tiffin the Comprador came in
with the news he had picked up in the
reeking streets of Chiang-Shan: Ko-
tsao was moving up from the river
valley.

  General Ko-tsao, it seemed, was now
calling himself Marshal Ko-tsao. He
had spent a profitable spring and sum-
mer foraging through Szechuan prov-
ince, and had taxed and looted his
treasury into an enviable state of pleni-
tude. He could afford to buy himself a
squadron of American fighting planes,
a fleet of small boats to consolidate his
li-kin ports on the great river, and two
divisions—complete with generals and
artillery—of ex-Nationalist troops. The
last purchase, universally considered
legitimate and wise tactics in Chinese
warfare, was perhaps his most valu-
able acquisition, for not only did it aug-
ment his army with well-trained officers
and well-equipped troops, but it simul-
taneously removed the most important
obstacle to his reconquest of Chiang-
Shan. And Chiang-Shan, the Compra-
dor assured me, would fall within
forty-eight hours.

  “The Marshal has requisitioned the
Greater Cathay supply train,” said the
Comprador. But he didn’t have to tell
us, because we’d both guessed it al-
ready.

THAT afternoon we saw the first
signs of Ko-tsao’s advance. A big
tri-motored biplane wheeled ominously
over Chiang-Shan, dropping leaflets in-

side of bombs, and thereby indicating
that Ko-tsao was planning to buy over
a few more regiments of the city’s de-
fenders before making his triumphal
entry.

  Toward sundown the terrified peas-
ants started streaming into the city.
The narrow flagged trails were clogged
with whole families and their house-
hold possessions. Men, women and chil-
dren pushed and shuffled along with
their crescent-horned water-buffalos
and their herds of pigs whose grunting
mingled with the shrill complaint of
ungreased wheel-barrows and the fal-
setto chant of coolies maneuvering
heavy loads on their shoulder-poles. The
confusion was the greatest where the
central gate pierced the city wall. Here
the crow'd poured through the gloomy
tunnel under the bright-pink drum
tower with its multiple tiers of sweep-
ing, curled-up roofs of green tile.
Watching them through a pair of
binoculars, I wondered at the peculiar
trust of the Chinese in their thousand-
year-old walls, despite the eloquent
drone of the modern bombing plane
which proclaimed the uselessness of
such ancient fortifications. I decided
that in another thousand years the
Chinese would still have their strange
instinct for shutting themselves up be-
hind walls, for huddling together like
sheep when danger threatened.

  Then the Reverend David Prentiss
arrived at • the Greater Cathay com-
pound, and I realized that the instinct
was not peculiar to the Chinese.

  The Reverend Prentiss was a well-
fed, rosy-cheeked individual whose
white hair and gold-rimmed spectacles
gave him a sanctimonious, almost
austere air, despite his rotund contours.
He was the dean of the missionary
colony at Chiang-Shan, which kept
very much to itself on the far side of
56

ARGOSY

the city. As in all Chinese cities, there
was no love lost between the mission-
aries and the representatives of West-
ern commerce, because the Men of
Commerce usually comported them-
selves in direct contradiction to the
ideas which the Men of God were try-
ing to instill into their Chinese pros-
elytes. But today—

  “I have come to ask you to give shel-
ter to our mission families during the
period of the impending crisis/' said
the Reverend Prentiss. “I believe you
will agree with me that at a time like
this, it is only fitting that all of us
foreigners should band together for
mutual protection.”

  “Of course.” I said. The “of course”
meant that I knew verv well that the

                                           j

“mutual protection” would consist of
the advantageous defensive position of
our hill-top compound, together with
the fact that since Tanner’s murder,
our Shanghai office had sent us two
machine-guns and doubled the number
of our Gurkha guard. I didn't men-
tion this to the Reverend Prentiss,
however. I just said, “I’m sure Mr.
Hudson will give his permission.”

  The missionary’s mouth shirred up,
as though he’d just bitten into a green
persimmon. He asked, “Is Mr. Hudson
. . . er . . . sober enough to make a rea-
sonable decision ?”

  “He’s the boss around here,” I said.
I went off to find Bill Hudson. He
wasn’t sober by a long shot, but he was
sympathetic enough. “Tell them we’ll
take care of ’em,” he said, “if they
bring their own food—in case of a long
siege.”

SO BY dinner time the missionaries
had moved in on us. There were
five families of them, and a few unat-
tached, serious-faced, pimply young
men. They moved in with their dowdy,

bespectacled wives, their shrill-voiced
children, two new-born babes, their
amahs and household servants, their
cooking utensils and their emergency
rations. They also brought their Bibles,
their hymn books, and a portable har-
monium. After dinner they set up the
harmonium on the flags of the court-
yard and went right to work, under the
heat-blurred stars, praying for our
mutual safety.

  They sang their heads off, those mis-
sionaries. Half of them were singing
off key, and the rest sang more like
crows than canaries. Still, I couldn’t
laugh at them. There was a touching
fervor in that discordant chorus, a
simple gusto that did something to me
as I sat inside with Bill Hudson, work-
ing on our last bottle of Scotch. Then
one of our outlying agents came in
panting, and the whole performance
suddenly seemed silly and childish.

  The goggle-eyed agent said that Ko-
tsao’s army had camped for the night
at Li-tzu, which was just five miles
from the city, and that the Nationalist
garrison at Chiang-Shan was preparing
for a hasty strategic retreat.

  When he left, we did a lot of damage
to that last bottle, most of it being done
by Hudson. There were just about
three drinks left when we went to bed.

  The next day was a scorcher. By
breakfast time the sun was already so
hot that it made the hair curl on my
arms. I could almost see the smells
drifting up out of the streets of
Chaing-Shan in waves. And I could
see the waves of gray uniforms come
snaking through the haze that covered
the fields. There were thousands of
them—how many I couldn’t estimate,
because they were raising their own
dust clouds that hung low with the
morning mist, and the ranks dis-
appeared long before I saw the end.

  When Hudson saw the sun glinting
on the bayonets of the advancing tide,
he skipped breakfast and finished up
what was left in the bottle. Then he
called out the Gurkhas and posted
them like a real strategist. He planted
the two machine-guns at the ends of
the compound, where they could each
command two slopes in case of a flank-
ing movement, put his rifles in all the
front windows to meet a direct attack,
and then he and I climbed to the roof
of the go-down, where our reserve stock
was stored with binoculars and our own
rifles. Then we lav down to wait and
roast on the corrugated iron roof,
while the harmonium in the courtyard
got into action again.

  And we didn’t have long to wait be-
fore we saw a platoon coming up the
hill in what looked to be a column of
files. Hudson yelled an order to the
captain of the Gurkhas, while I watched
the platoon through the binoculars.
After a minute, I said:

  “Whoa Bill. Tell ’em to hold every-
thing! The attacking party packs a
white flag.”

  “Maybe it’s a trick.” said Hudson.
But it wasn’t a trick. It was Marshall
Ko-tsao himself, paying us a visit.
Pretty soon we could see the red and
gold of his sedan chair coming up the
hill on the shoulders of four men. We
could see the out-runners coming on
ahead, waving automatics; the flag of
truce fluttering above a thicket of bay-
onets, and a lot of gold-braided staff
officers bringing up in the rear. When
we could hear the ho, hey! ho, hey! of
the chair carriers, we got down oft" the
burning roof.

A FEW minutes later we were sit-
ting around the dining room table
with Ko-tsao and his staff. The Rev-
erend Prentiss insisted on sitting in, as

representative of the mission com-
munity. We let him sit, as long as he
understood that Bill Hudson was boss
and had full say. Bill Hudson was boss,
too. He had enough liquor in. him to
make his lower jaw stick out half an
inch, and when he talked to Ko-tsao, he
sounded plenty tough.

  “Well, what do you want?" he de-
manded, as soon as Ko-tsao sat down.

   The marshal leaned back in his chair
and lit a cigar six inches long. He was
a jaunty little man, with the gold-
braided visor of his kepi pulled down
over one eye at a rakish angle. If it
hadn’t been for his narrow, almost-lid-
less eyes, he could have passed for an
Occidental—particularly when he be-
gan to talk. He’d picked up a strong
American accent and some choice
American slang during his Boxer
Scholarship in the States. He winked
at us through the cigar smoke.

  “I want the works,” he said. “And
quick.”

  “Meaning what?” Hudson asked.

  “Gasoline,” said Ko-tsao. “Petrol.”

  “You hijacked our supply train a
couple of days ago,” Hudson came back
at him. “Isn’t that enough for you?”

   “It’s n. g.," said the marshal. “Low-
grade distillate and kerosene. I’ve got
an air force now, and those big crates
sure eat up the gas. I need high-octane
stuff that I can feed the planes, and
you've got a couple of thousand drums
of it in your go-down. I want it."

   “It’s going to be hard to steal," said
Hudson.

  Ko-tsao laughed and slapped the
table with the flat of his pudgy hand.
“But I pay cash,” he said. “I’m even
going to lay it on the line for that punk
distillate."

  He turned and uttered a few mono-
syllables to one of his staff. The officer
undid a cloth-tied, squarish package.
58

ARGOSY

A dozen fat bundles of crisp new bank-
notes fell out on the table. They were so
new that I could smell the fresh
printer’s-ink.

  Hudson glanced at them and said,
“We do business on a strict silver basis.
You’ll have to pay in Hai-kwan taels,
or Shanghai or Hankow currency—not
with cigar coupons.”

  Ko-tsao scowled. He said, “My cur-
rency is legal tender in all territory my
troops occupy. Anybody who won’t ac-
cept it, gets shot.”

  “I won’t accept it,” said Hudson.
His jaw stuck out another quarter-inch.
He stared at the marshal and the mar-
shal stared back. There was a long
silence, until Hudson figured he’d
stared the marshal down. Then he
went on, “Furthermore, there’s some
stuff in that supply train you hijacked
that’s not for sale. There’s half a dozen
cases of Scotch—”

  “Sure, I know,” said Ko-tsao. “I
wanted to compliment you on your
taste in whisky. It’s swell stuff.”

   “I’ll need it today,” said Hudson.
“Sorry,” said Ko-tsao, “but it’s hard
to get decent stuff around this neck of
the woods. I’m keeping it. Now, about
that gasoline—■’*

   “It’s no deal,” said Hudson. “I don’t
like your credit rating.”

  “You’d better sell it to me,” said
Ko-tsao. “If you don’t sell, I’ll take it
anyhow.”

  “Try,” said Hudson.

  Marshal Ko-tsao stood up. “I’ll give
you time to think it over,” he said. “I'll
give you until sundown. If I don’t hear
from you by sundown, you’ll hear from
and plenty.”

I’ll be waiting with all the snappy
answers,” said Hudson. “And now
you’d better clear out of here before
I forget to honor that flag of truce,
and do the people of China a great big

me-

it T9

favor. If all the vermin like you were
exterminated, this country—”

  “Please, please, Mr. Hudson,” the
Reverend Prentiss broke in. “Can’t
you gentlemen come to some agree-
ment? Can’t—

   “Don’t start an argument, Prentiss!”
Hudson cut him off. “The tuchun is in
an awful hurry. Goodbye, General
Flea.”

   Ko-tsao gave another order, and his
staff backed toward the door, hands on
their side arms. For a minute I thought
Hudson’s Dutch courage had gone a
little too far, that we were in for it.
I grabbed by own automatic under the
table. But nothing happened except
Ko-tsao’s farewell speech in the door-
way.

   “So long, gents,” said the marshal.
“I’ll be seeing you—at sundown, if not
before.”

   Then he left.

\ S SOON as he’d gone, I grabbed
Hudson’s hand and pumped it.
“That’s standing up to ’em, Bill,” I
said.

  The Reverend David Prentiss came
over and stood in front of Hudson.
The corners of his mouth curved down,
partly in distaste for the flavor of Hud-
son’s whisky breath, partly in pity and
contempt.

   “Pot-valiant!” said the missionary.
“Drunken bravado! Why didn’t you let
him have his gasoline? Then he
wouldn’t have molested us. . . .”
“Wouldn’t he, though!” snapped
Hudson. “I thought you knew the
Oriental mind better than that, Pren-
tiss. I thought you understood face
pidgin. If I’d have backed down to
Ko-tsao, I’d have lost face. To lose
face is a sign of weakness. Weakness
is a signal for everybody to jump on
the man who’s down. The only way to
POT — VALIANT

59

keep Ko-tsao out of this compound is
to speak to him in his own language."

  “But what can you hope to do ?” pro-
tested the Reverend Prentiss. “What
can you do against a whole army?”

  “I can call their bluff," Hudson re-
plied. “They still think I’m bluffing.
When they find out I mean business,
they’ll go away and let us alone. And
by the way, Prentiss, suppose you let
me take care of the practical details of
this, and I’ll let you take care of all the
praying.”

  The Reverend Prentiss bowed his
head. “Thank you,” he murmured,
“for reminding me of my vow of hu-
mility. For a moment I was almost
bold enough to oppose the will of God.
You are right. Our only salvation lies
in prayer.” He went out.

  As soon as he left the room, Bill
Hudson began to tremble. He sat
down, as though his knees wouldn’t
hold him any longer. He ran his shak-
ing hand across his pale, perspiring
forehead.

  “It’s wearing off, Mitch,” he said.
“I need a drink. I need lots of drinks
—enough to get me through the day,
and probably the nighf. Can you get it
for me, Mitch?”

  “I can try,” I told him.

  “Get anything,” he said. “Even that
Chinese rot-gut that smells like mouldy
straw. I won’t taste it anyhow. I’ve got
to face this, Mitch—and I can’t unless
you get me enough bottled courage to
pull me through.”

  “I’ll get it,” I said. I dug up the
number one houseboy, who was as re-
sourceful as all number one boys in
China are supposed to be. I gave him
some money and told him to try to find
some sam-shm shop that was still out-
side of Ko-tsao’s lines.

“Bring back three bottles of Ng-ka-
pay,” I told him. “Six bottles if you

can get them and can carry them.”
“Can do,” was his reply. It always
was.

T WENT inside to the office and tried
to work. I went over a stack of ac-
counts, but they didn’t seem to make
much sense. I found myself watching
the flies swarming in the glare of the
court yard, listening to that strange
muted sound of an army moving, the
collective tread of ten thousand feet,
the vague, inexorable rumble, like the
distant sound of the sea. After a while
I quit pretending to work and went to
one of the front windows where I
could watch the troop concentration.
Too fast, I thought, for their own
good. A squadron of Nationalist
bombers could do terrific damage. But
there was no sign of Nationalist op-
postion of any kind—only Ko-tsao’s
gray-uniformed hordes, coming on
and on. They hadn’t made any at-
tempt on our hill-top as yet, but they
were moving up between me and the
city walls, so that we were completely
cut off. I wondered if the number one
boy had been able to get through be-
fore the encircling movement was com-
plete. I was still wondering when the
Reverend David Prentiss came in.

  “I must ask you,” said the mis-
sionary, “to maintain better discipline
among your servants.”

“Meaning what?” I wanted to know.
“I just caught your number one boy
attempting to smuggle liquor into the
compound,” said the Reverend Pren-
tiss.

  “You did—what?”

  “I destroyed it, of course,” said the
Reverend Prentiss. “Six bottles of
some vile Chinese intoxicant. I smash-
ed them all.”

  I didn’t say anything. I couldn’t. I
was stunned by the realization of what
60

ARGOSY

the Reverend Prentiss had done, with-
out knowing it, to Bill Hudson—and
to himself.

  “I hope you understand, Mr. Mit-
chell,” the Reverend Prentiss went on,
“that this is no time for drink-fuddled
minds and shaky nerves. We must
meet this situation with clear, sane
eyes, Mr. Mitchell. We cannot trust
our lives to drunkards.”

  “Sure,” I said. “Of course.”

  I went off to find Hudson, who had
shut himself up in his room. He
greeted me eagerly with, “Did you
bring it?”

  I shook my head. “The boy couldn't
get through,” I lied. “We're complete-
ly cut off.”

  Hudson groaned. He flopped on his
bed, lay looking up at the ceiling for a
long time. At last he said: “Why am
I such a coward, Mitch?” His voice
was like a little boy’s.

  “You’re no more coward than I
am,” 1 told him. “Not as much. I
wouldn’t have had the guts to go
through the Tanner business without
going crazy.”

  “I can’t go through it again,” he
said.

  “You’ll be all right when you get a
little sleep. I told him. “You catch a
few winks of t’ang-hsia. I’ll wake you
up if anything pops.”

   “I can’t sleep, Mitch,” he said hope-
lessly. “I couldn’t sleep last night, even
with all that booze I killed. I’m fin-
ished.”

  “Maybe you better go down and
give the Gurkhas their orders, then,”
I said.

  “You go, Mitch.”

  “They won’t listen to me. You know
the Gurkhas. They’ll take orders from
the number one boss.”

  “Tell ’em I’m sick,” said Hudson
listlessly.

WELL, I never went through
such a long afternoon. It got
hotter and hotter as the sun went low-
er. I suppose it was because the flag-
stones and the masonry walls of the
compound heated up aa«l turned the
courtyards into fireless cookers. The
corrugated-iron roof of the go-dozvn
shimmered and danced in its own heat
waves. And I—well, I stewed in my
own juice.

  The Gurkhas were squatting in the
shade in front of their own quarters,
smoking and gambling for coppers.
When I told the captain he had better
take his post, he merely looked at me.

  “Where is the Master?” he asked.

  I told him that Hudson was ill; a
touch of the sun. He gave me a funny
grin, then lit a cigarette.

  “We will wait,” he said, “until the
Master is well enough to give the or-
ders.”

  That was the answer I expected.
They’re spunky soldiers, these Gurk-
has, and great fighters. But they were,
after all, only mercenaries. They didn’t
mind the risk of getting their vitals
riddled with lead if the white man who
paid them took <the same chance. But
if there was any shirking going on,
the Gurkhas would just as soon smoke
and gamble for coppers. There was
only one thing left for me to do.

  The sun sank into a dirty smother
of haze along the western hills. The
refraction effect through the murk
made it seem to flatten and twist itself
into a grotesque elongated shape, like
a great Oriental eye—a red, glaring
eye. ... In one of the courtyards the
missionaries were gathered about the
harmonium, swelling their rapturous
voices in a heart-felt if not quite mu-
sical chorus . . .

  When I went into Bill Hudson’s
room, he jumped off the bed as though
POT-VALIANT

61

he were going to pounce on me. “Can’t
you stop that caterwauling?” he yelled.
“Those psalm-singers are driving me
mad.”

  “Be yourself, Bill,” I told him. “We
all need something to put heart into us
and stiffen our spines. They’ve got
their hymns. You’ve got your fire-
water.”

  “I haven’t got it, though.”

  “I have,” I said, taking a bottle
from my hip-pocket. “Here’s a quart
I’ve had stuck away for emergencies.
I didn't bring it out before, because I
was saving it for when you needed
it most. I guess this is the time.”
Hudson came over with slow, sus-
picious steps, stared through the thick
dusk at the bottle. Then he grabbed it,
poured out half a tumblerful of dark,
amber fluid, downed it in two breath-
less gulps. Even in the gloom I could
see the face he made as he gasped. I
tried to take back the bottle.

  “One more, Mitch,” he pleaded.
“Go easy,” I said. “It’s all there is.”
I poured him another inch and put
the cork back in the bottle. I watched
him rub his breast bone with great
tenderness, as though savoring the
strength that came to him from the
burning sensation in his gullet. His
shoulders squared back.

  “All right,” he said. “Let’s go to
work, Mitch.”

  We were hurrying across the court-
yard when the Reverend Prentiss
grabbed Hudson. “The sun is setting,
Mr. Hudson,” the missionary said.
“You know of course that I intend to
do my part. What shall I do ?”

  “Pray!” yelled Bill Hudson without
stopping. “Pray, Mr. Prentiss!”

E’D hardly got the Gurkhas sta-
tioned at the front windows be-
fore Ko-tsao started coming for his

gasoline. There was the familiar stac-
cato stutter of machine guns and the
dust spurted in a snaky line along the
slope about a hundred yards in front
of us. Hudson had me straddle the
tripod of one of our own machine
guns, and then ordered the Gurkhas to
hold their fire until he gave the word.

  For ten minutes we all suffered from
itching trigger fingers. The Chinese
machine gunner at the base of the hill
kept up his tattoo in intermittent
bursts. He got the range after the first
few minutes, and we could hear the
lead spatter against the thick masonry
walls of the compound, A few bullets
splintered through our wooden shut-
ters, ripped off the tiles of our roof,
went screaming off into the fading
twilight. After a while the machine-
gun fire stopped, and we could barely
see the first line of skirmishers start
up the hill. The flashes of their rifles
gave us the range if we wanted to open
fire, but Hudson wasn’t ready yet. The
crackle of rifles grew louder and the
room I was in was full of dust and
sound of breaking things as an oc-
casional bullet found its way in. The
rifles were flickering about a hundred
yards away when Hudson said, “Give
it to ’em!”

  The tripod seat jumped and bucked
under me as my machine gun began
to yammer. I’d loosened the swivel and
swept the leaping muzzle back and
forth through the full arc of the sector
Bill Hudson assigned me. The other
machine gun was chattering and spit-
ting death from the opposite side of
the compound, and in between the
rifles of the Gurkhas were jerking and
barking across the window sills as fast
as the little brown men could work the
breechbolts. My ears rang with the
deafening clamor and my nostrils
smarted with the acrid smell of burned
62

powder. I don’t know how long the
din kept up before Hudson yelled:
“Hold it.”

  The sudden silence hit my eardrums
with the same impact as a loud noise.
It was several seconds before I could
distinguish any sounds outside in the
hot night—the sound of rapid foot-
steps, panic-stricken feet running back
down the hill; the long drawn-out wail
of some poor devil who had stopped
a slug out there in the darkness. The
rout, apparently, was complete.

  “Maybe that’ll teach General Flea I
wasn’t bluffing,” said Hudson. “Hand
me that bottle, Mitch.”

  But General Flea was not easily
convinced. Seven more waves of rifle-
men came surging up the hill during
the next few hours. And each time
they got the same reception. At regular
intervals we made flares of cotton
waste soaked in gasoline, weighted
them, and tossed them, flaming, down
the slope. The flares prevented sur-
prise, but they didn’t prevent the re-
peated attacks of the soldiers of the
persistent Ko-tsao. And Hudson’s tac-
tics were always the same. Hold fire
until the raiders were within deadly
range, then blast them into panic. And
if you’ve never seen Chinese soldiers
in panic, you’ve never seen a panic.

   It was nasty business, all in all, be-
cause a lot of Ko-tsao’s dollar-a-
month soldiers got taken down with
an overdose of lead. But Bill Hudson
carried on with a sort of grim relish.
Between attacks he’d come over for a
pull on my bottle, and his lower jaw
never lost that pugnacious line of in-
spired, hard-boiled courage that was
such a contrast with his usual shy,
boyish smile. I could tel! he was think-
ing hard about Tanner, so as not to
feel too sorry for the Chinese that kept
charging up the hill, time after time.

T ji T~E had a few casualties our-

  *	^ selves. All of us were more or
less cut and scratched by splinters and
flying bits of masonry, and four of our
Gurkhas had stopped bullets, three of
them enough to need first-aid from
one of the lady missionaries who knew
how to w'rap bandages. Three of the
young men missionaries volunteered
to take the rifles of the wounded Gurk-
has. The rest of them piously manned
the harmonium, and the chords of the
wheezy little organ pealing above their
thin, reedy voices, made a weird, mys-
tical background for the rattle of gun-
fire and the cries of men in pain.

  It was nearly midnight before Ko
tsao realized the futility of direct at-
tack—at least without artillery or
grenades or air bombs, which would
risk destroying our godoum full of
gasoline and thus defeat his own pur-
pose. He finally managed to sneak a
machine-gun crew up the north slope
of the hill, just out of range of our
flares. We didn’t know the gun was
there until it started raking our right
flank.

  Bill Hudson didn’t hesitate. He
knew he had to act quickly, because
our ammunition was running low, and
our position would soon become un-
tenable if we had to split up our
meagre defending forces. He took my
bottle, up-ended it, drained the last
drop, wiped his mouth. Then he picked
three Gurkhas, told them to leave their
rifles and carry only their kukris—
those heavy, curved knives they love
to use for close fighting. Then he said,
“Mitch, don’t pay any attention to the
new riveter who’s just moved in on
us from the north. Keep hammering
straight at the front, when they start
up the hill again.”

Then he and the three Gurkhas
crossed the compound to the gate back
POT — VALIANT

63

of the go-down. I waited nervously.

  And a few minutes later the eighth
attack began. By the smoky orange
light of our improvised flares, I could
see that there were twice as many men
charging up the hill this time. Under
cover of the advance skirmish line, a
second wave was bearing off to our
right, obviously to complete the flank
attack started by that lone machine
gun. I ignored it, according to Hud-
son’s orders, and opened fire dead
ahead.

  By this time my ears were deaf to
the din. I could feel, rather than hear,
the hammering of my machine gun as
I rode the kicking, jiggling tripod.
The barrel was so hot that I burned
the skin off my knuckles reloading, and
the water was boiling and steaming in
the cooling jacket.

  Suddenly the ranks in front of us
wavered, then broke. The flanking de-
tachment came pouring back along the
north slope in full flight, stumbling,
flinging away their rifles, yelling with
surprise and pain. Their own machine
gun had turned against them, was
spraying them with a hail of steel-
jacketed death. And before I’d fully
realized what had happened, the eighth
attack was over.

  A little later two of the Gurkhas
came back to the compound, packing
the captured machine gun. The third
Gurkha followed, packing Bill Hud-
son, who must have weighed fifty
pounds more than he did.

  Bill’s face was white as his teeth,
which were clenched in agony. One leg
of his trousers was crimson. The mis-
sionaries put him to bed, while I stayed
on the job at the front windows. The
Gurkhas would take orders from me
now ....

There were no more orders to give,
however. We sat by our guns all night,

but Ko-tsao was at last convinced that
Bill Hudson wasn’t bluffing.

 A LITTLE after dawn seven
Nationalist planes flew over in
a V formation. I expected to see a
dog fight, but none of Ko-tsao’s fliers
appeared. He must have really needed
that gasoline he didn’t get, because he
was already moving on to get it else-
where. His rear guard was two miles
away by ten o’clock, when the first of
the Nationalist column, reinforced by
the garrisons at Pao-tung and Pei-
ming-fu, reentered the city.

  Wrhen it finally looked safe to lay
down our fowling pieces, I went in to
see Hudson. He was awake, lying there
all bandaged and smelling of antisep-
tic. Either his leg wasn’t hurting him
as much, or he was getting used to the
pain, because he looked relaxed.

  “Nice work last night, Bill,” I told
him. “And you can’t kid yourself any
more that you’re a coward.”

  He gave me a wan smile.
“Pot-valiant!” he said. “Dutch
courage. Or was it Scotch?”

  “Scotch, my eye!” I said. “It was
your own private brand of courage—
the guts you were born with.”

  “That bottle—” he started to say.
“That bottle,” I cut him off, “was
full of boiled water, colored with soy
sauce, and flavored with ginger and a
dash of Worcestershire to make it
burn. It was a fraud—but I won't
apologize.”

  Hudson looked at me for a minute,
perfectly blank. Then he began to
laugh. It was the kind of laugh I’d
been wanting to hear from him for
months—hearty, full-spirited, genuine,
and infectious. He laughed so long
and so loud that the Reverend David
Prentiss came in. The missionaries
were going home—all but Mrs.
•- :v.v. - '	• - *.•'

ARGOSY

Prentiss who would stay and take care
of Bill—and^ they wanted to shake
hands with Mr. Hudson.

  As they filed past Bill’s bed, the
Reverend Prentiss said to me: “We
have given thanks to the Lord for this
new manifestation of Divine good-
ness, of the virtue of prayer. We have
all been saved by our faith.”

  The Reverend Prentiss was right. I
won’t say for sure that it was his kind
of faith that saved us, because that’s
something I don’t know anything
about. Maybe it was, and maybe it
wasn’t. It’s outside my province and
beyond my ken. But I will say that Bill

Hudson was saved by faith—faith in
himself, that he’d lost, and found
again.

  A couple of months later the taipan
from our Shanghai office came
through on a tour of inspection. At
dinner, he proposed a toast to Bill
Hudson. In acknowledgement, Bill
drank one swallow to be polite, then
put down his glass.

  “What’s the matter, Hudson?” the
taipan asked. “Gone teetotaler on us,
have you?”

  Bill made a face and pushed his
glass away. “I never did like the taste
of the stuff,” he said.

Down to the Sea in Ovens

■piNKlES, like the Great Auk, have for so long been non-existent that when
Henry Ford looked around for one to put in his museum he couldn’t find
one. A pinky is neither a bird nor a flower, but a boat. And at Millbridge on
the Maine coast, one is now being built for Howard I. Chappelle, a marine
architect and historian of early shipbuilding.

  Pinkies were noted for their comfort and seaworthiness, and Mr. Chapelle
notes that as long as they were used on the Grand Banks' fisheries, loss of life
was comparatively small. They were two-masted schooners carrying mainsail,
foresail, one fore-staysail on a high bowsprit, and sometimes one topsail. They
were double-enders, pointed fore and aft, and their chief characteristic was
the pair of wide gunwales that formed bulwarks the entire length of the ship
and swept up in a curve to meet in a stern overhang.

  A Pinky’s cabin, called a "‘cuddy” was located under a raised section of the
deck forward. And in some cuddies there were open fireplaces, a few with
brick chimneys. Supposedly, finnan haddie was discovered when a haddock
was hung in a pinky cuddy to dry. It became smoked. Down East fishermen
still call sailing boats with cabins “smoke boats.”

A Complete Novelet
I

PERRY HILTON, staff photog-
rapher for the conservative Chi-
cago Chronicle, was a long way
from home. Not so far when you meas-
ured the distance from Chicago, be-
cause it is only a few hundred miles
down the state from Chicago to Bur-
bank. He was far from home because
he couldn’t get out of Burbank. He was
marooned there.

  Burbank, a thriving little river city,
sits out on a point where the Wabash
and the Ohio Rivers converge. Most

of the year, it is a beautiful location.
Across the Ohio, you can see Kentucky.
Across the Wabash is the Indiana
shore. The scenery is wonderful in the
fall; the weather is marvelous in the
summer and bracing in the winter.
Burbank’s -fame as a lovely vacation
spot had gone out long before and
many had built homes in Cheoke Val-
ley and upon the knolls above the
metropolis.

  But the night Perry Hilton sat in a
ramshackle chair with a broken leg on
its right side and its wicker seat half
fallen through, was not a nice night for
Burbank. The season was neither sum-
mer. autumn nor winter. This was late

66
HELL AND HIGH WATER

67

spring, and terror rode the chilling
winds which swept down the great
Mississippi and across the southern tip
of Illinois.

  The thaw had begun a week previous
and the rivers of the midwest, swollen,
rampant and fierce, had backwatered
and flooded their banks when they
reached the hundreds of twisting
curves in their respective courses. The
whole belt saw water—brown angry
water.

  Perry Hilton sighed and stamped his
right foot several times. He realized
suddenly that he was stiff and that it
had gotten much colder and that his big
toe ached.

  He was sitting in the city room of
the Burbank Evening Standard. A
number of other men, all newshawks,
were there in the same room. The
newshawks for the most part belonged
to the staffs of the Evening Standard
and the Morning Call, both Burbank
papers. They were working together,
striving with desperation to publish
some sort of newspaper for the benefit
of readers who would probably never
see a copy.

  The merger was an emergency meas-
ure. At the moment the Morning Call’s
offices were inundated, filled with filthy
river and black slime and everything
else which the Wabash had picked up
in its turbulent path. The Call had been
situated downtown in the business dis-
trict. Unfortunately, the business dis-
trict lay between the Wabash and the
Ohio. And when the water rose, the
business district had been the first to
know submersion.

  Perry Hilton gritted his teeth as a
chill ate through him. He stamped his
right foot several times and moved his
arms to keep warm. It was dark and
gloomy in that city room. The electric
power had faded twenty-four hours

previous. The place looked as though
some one had stuck pinpoints of light
all over it, hanging them right on the
blackness itself. But these were the
tallow candles, amber, more or less
cheerful, and smelling to high heaven.
The room boasted the luxury of a kero-
sene lamp too, but that was over on
the city editor’s desk where two men—
one from the morning paper and one
from the evening—were handling the
assignments and worrying about get-
ting the copy uptown to the printer’s.

  Perry didn’t give a hoot about the
Burbank papers. He was there because
Mr. Blaine, managing editor of the
Chicago Chronicle, had told him to
make the place his headquarters so that
he could be reached. He wasn’t the
only photographer from a Chicago
paper to be sitting there with the
Wabash and Ohio Rivers six feet deep
in the street outside.

  There were a couple of association
men whom he knew slightly. There was
also Mr. Spudsy Gill of the Clarion, a
sheet which did everything in the cruci-
fixion but drive the nails. It was a scan-
dal rag, full of daring, dirty, and bad
pictures. It had the largest circulation
in the midwest.

  Spudsy was a funny guy, Perry re-
flected. The man, built short and squat
with long arms so that he resembled an
ape, had the instincts of a gangster. He
would have done anything to take a
picture. He had done anything in the
past. There was the time he took a pic-
ture of Joe Hooker, world’s champ,
when Hooker was out with a dizzy
chorine at the Black Hawk one night.
Hooker hadn’t liked the idea much and
he’d gone after Spudsy. He broke
Spudsy’s camera and was trying to
break Spudsy’s nose. That was all
right. But when he tried to break the
exposed plate, Spudsy blew up and let
68

ARGOSY

Hooker have one with a sap. It all but
fractured the champ’s skull and Spudsy
nearly spent time in a hoosegow for the
job. But he saved his picture. He was
that way.

"DERRY glanced over at Spudsy Gill
who was asleep in a chair, his head
down under his overcoat like a bird’s
head under a wing. The trouble with
Spudsy, Perry Hilton thought, was
that he had no ethics in photography at
all. And the same went for Max Fer-
ron, a gangling thin man with specs,
who worked for the Star-Call. Max
was picking his teeth between drags on
a cigarette. And also Lou Drake, of
the Dispatch, a hairless man who
chewed constantly on a dead cigar.

  Perry frowned. They were all rough-
necks at best. No wonder news photog-
raphers had such a bad reputation. You
couldn’t blame a man like J. P. Mor-
gan for carrying a bodyguard around
with him to take care of fotogs like
Spudsy Gill. News fotogs needed
ethics. That was the hitch—no decency.

  Over at the city desk, the telephone
rang. It sounded shrill and noisy in the
silence of the room, and everyone
stirred expectantly at its voice. Spudsy
Gill woke up and yawned broadly. He
asked : “Who’s it for, chief?”

  Perry straightened in his chair and
stretched the muscles of his back. They
were cramped and cold. He hadn’t
changed his clothes in two days now
and he felt disreputable. He knew he
shouldn’t mind. There was no way of
getting back to the hotel which was
now underwater up to the second floor
downtown. And after all, they said at
the Circle of Confusion Club in Chi-
cago, that Spudsy Gill actually slept in
his clothes all the time with his camera
and his flash bulbs right at hand so
that he could rip out on a beat at a mo-

ment’s notice. Wearing the same
clothes for two days was small beer
compared to that.

   Still, Perry thought, it was inelegant.
He’d always prided himself upon his
dressing immaculately. Now his shoes
were soaking wet and covered with
slime, and his trouser legs would never
be clean again. His tie was ruined and
his coat spotted and his gloves were a
mess. It really was distasteful.

   Of course, there was a flood in the
vicinity and if a man had gone out in
plain shorts he’d probably been given
a medal for good common sense. But
to Perry Hilton that made no differ-
ence.

   The man at the city desk said: “Chi-
cago calling Perry Hilton!”

   Perry got up, grunting a little be-
cause he was stiff, and walked over to
the city desk with its luxurious kero-
sene lamp. Spudsy Gill, grinning owl-
ishly and showing his gold tooth which
caught the light of the candles eerily,
sauntered after him.

   Perry picked up the phone and stared
at Spudsy who was trying to get his
ear as close as possible to the receiver.
“The man said it was for me, Spudsy.”

  Spudsy looked pained. “Aw, now,
Duke,” he said, “ain’t it ethical for me
to drop an ear in?” And he grinned.

  Perry shrugged and said hello. It
was Mr. Blaine. “Hello, Perry,” Blaine
said. His voice was miles distant and
the wire crackled as though it would
burn up.

   “I can't hear you,” Perry said.

   “I said hello,” Mr. Blaine replied in
a louder voice. “It’s the connection,
very bad! Wonder I can reach you at
all. . . . Listen, Perry!”

  “Okay now,” Perry said.

   “You 11 have to figure a new way of
shooting any more pictures up,” Mr.
Blaine said. “Phil just got in with the
HELL AND HIGH WATER

69

last batch and says he can’t get through
again. He can’t get back. We’ve had
word from the C. C. C. & St. Louis
that the right of way has washed out
ten miles north of Burbank. No more
trains going in there.”

  “No more trains?” Perry snapped.
“And the roads are gone! How are we
fixed, Mr. Blaine?”

  “You’re absolutely cut off,” Mr.
Blaine said. “The last AP flash said
that the Wabash had gone across the
valley north of Burbank and has met
the Ohio on the other side. Burbank is
out on a limb. The levees are holding
and that's the only thing that’s saving
the city and Cheoke Valley. Red Cross
trying to get supplies in but may have
to drop ’em by plane when the weather
lets up.”

  “But how about film?” Perry asked,
worried. “I’ve only got about two
dozen negatives left. Film packs. That's
no film for this setup. I need more and

I	can’t get it!”

   “We’ll get supplies to you as soon as
we can. Why don’t you try the stores
there? Any open? ... No? Well, do
your best, Perry. Make your negatives
count. It’s a jam, we can’t do anything
on either side. We’re lucky the wires
are still up. They’ll probably go before
dawn. Perry! Wait a second! Wait a
second! Just got a flash—”

  Perry held the phone and took a
couple of breaths. Spudsy Gill snick-
ered and shook his head. “You’re down
to a pair of film packs, Duke,” he said.
“Max Ferron is down to five negatives.
And Lou Drake and me, we’re out al-
together. And you should kick.”
“Burbank’s cut off from the rest of
Illinois,” Perry told him. “This town
is in a tough spot.”

   “Hello, hello, Perry,” Mr. Blaine cut
in. “Get this now: Another AP flash.
Army engineers fear that the Wabash's

crest may endanger the whole city
down there. If worst comes to worst,
they’ll dynamite the levees in the east
and divert the Wabash into Cheoke
Valley. They’re putting it on the air
now to warn the citizens in the valley
to go up for higher grounds. And
here’s an assignment! I’ve just been
tipped off that Old Man Beard—you
know—Jonathan Beard, the steel
man—”

  “You mean the millionaire?” Perry
asked.

  “One and the same. He’s at his coun-
try place in the Cheoke Valley. He
went there two weeks ago for seclu-
sion with his six-year-old grand-daugh-
ter after the kid was threatened with
kidnapping. He’s still there! Listen,
Perry, you’ve got a chance for a beau-
tiful job. Get down into the valley and
see Jonathan Beard and the kid and
get me some pictures. Get me some—”

MR. BLAINE suddenly stopped
speaking. Perry hammered the
telephone hook and said hello three
times. No answer. Then a terrific
crackling, ear-splitting in its din, took
over the wires, followed by a metallic
explosion.

  Spudsy Gill shook his dirty face and
stopped grinning. He said: “That wire
is shot, Perry. I’ll bet you five fish we
don’t get any more outside calls.”

  “But he was just talking—” Perry
began, but the operator cut him off
with: “I’m sorry. Your party has been
disconnected. The trunk lines are down.
You can still make local calls.”

  “Never mind,” said Perry. “Call it
a night.” And he hung up.

  “I heard the crack from here,” said
Spudsy. “Ain’t this a nice pickle.
Marooned in a marooned burg, no out-
side phone, no railroad, the weather too
dirty for flying and swell for ducks,
70

ARGOSY

only there ain’t no ducks. What are
you going to do, Perry?” Spudsy
grinned broadly then. “I mean, what is
the ethical thing to do, Duke?”

   “I’ve got to get out of here,” Perry
said. “What time is it anyhow ?”

  “Four G. M.” said Spudsy Gill. He
yawned and stretched his arms. He re-
minded Perry of a picture of a gorilla
he had once seen, its arms strung up
on poles, making the dead figure look
as though it were alive and stretching.
Only, the gorilla had had a better look-
ing face than Spudsy’s mashed one.

   Perry went back to his chair but he
didn’t sit down. He opened his black
oblong equipment case and had a look.

  His precious Speed Graphic was in
there with its Kalart Speedgun attached
and synchronized to the shutter. A
number two photoflash bulb was sitting
tightly in the Speedgun socket, all
ready to burst into its three thousand
lumens of light. There were two car-
tons of photoflash bulbs beside, each
carton carrying six bulbs. That meant
twelve possible pictures in blackness.
There were the two film packs, enough
negative for twenty-four pictures.
There was a tripod which he hadn’t
been able to use at all. And there was
—he didn’t know why on earth it was
there—some Velox printing paper,
sensitized paper for contact printing,
making the actual picture from a nega-
tive in a darkroom after the negative
had been developed and dried.

   He checked through it all, then slung
the case on his shoulder and put on his
gloves. Spudsy Gill watched him sharp-
ly. Max Ferron stared at him and said:
“What’s up?”

  “Don’t ask him," Lou Drake said.
“That guy is ethical. He wouldn’t tip
off a couple of his fotog pals if he lost
an arm. Besides it’s a lousy night and
not worth the trouble. And negatives

are low and if I take any more shots
of this high water, it’ll be by day.”
“I’ll see you all later,” Perry said.
Spudsy Gill, rubbing his chin, fol-
lowed Perry to the window past the
city desk. “Look, my ethical chum,” he
clowned, “the water outside that win-
dow is about ten feet deep. You can’t
get out of this shebang without a boat.”
“I know,” Perry said. “I’m hoping
somebody goes by.”

   “I can do better than that.”

  “What do you mean, Spudsy?”
“Look, Duke,” Spudsy said serious-
ly. “You’re a funny guy. You think a
guy can be a news photographer and
still be polite. I’ve been in the racket
for twelve years, see ? And I know you
gotta be a roughneck to deliver the
goods. Never trust another guy. Cut
his throat before he cuts yours. That’s
the way to get pictures.”

   Perry said, “Well?”

  “Well . , Spudsy stopped to light
a cigarette. “Here’s one spot your
ethics don’t work. I can get a boat.
You need a boat. You got to get to
Cheoke Valley. I could take you there.
You don’t know the way—”

  “How did you—?”

  “I heard Blaine on the phone,”
Spudsy said. “I got a big ear, Duke,
whefi it comes to exclusiveness. So how
about it ?”

  “About what?”

   “I’ll get the boat and ferry you to
Cheoke Valley. And you split that film
pack with me. I ain’t got a negative
left in the camera. No negatives for
Spudsy, no boat for the Duke.”

   Perry hesitated. The tip from Blaine
was exclusive. But even an exclusive
wasn’t worth anything if you didn't
get to the subject to shoot it. What
were the ethics here ? Spudsy’s proposi-
tion was fair enough, not that he
trusted Spudsy farther than he could
HELL AND HIGH WATER

throw a piano. “I’ll give you half a
dozen negatives,” Perry said. “And it’s
a deal."

  “Sure," said Spudsy. “A good man
like me don't need more than six gela-
tins. Only a guy with ethics—an ama-
choor so to speak—needs a reserve."
He stopped grinning. “Let’s lam.
We’ve got a trip."

II

rpiHE night was filled with a deafen-
ing roar and the weight of a river
gone mad. The flying scud, thick and
sooty and wet, whipped down on them
as Perry Hilton and Spudsy Gill
clambered from the Evening Standard
building to the top of a theatre
marquee, deserted and dark. The wind
was roaring almost as much as the run-
ning waters which flooded the street
and carried its cargo of twisted wreck-
age and—sometimes—human bodies to
and fro in a swirling aimlessness. . . .

  It was a dark dead city, Burbank.
No electric lights to stud the Stygian
gloom. No moon, no stars, no sign of
life. Only the wind-whipped waters
and the stinging bullets of rain
which splattered down with fecundity,
drenching the drowning metropolis.

  From the top of the marquee—the
foul waters barely washing ,the last
letters of its dead electric sign: Double
Feature Today—Perry peered through
the mists which clung to his eyes. He
tried to look down town, to see the city
which had so busily fought to
strengthen its levees and keep its thriv-
ing centers free from high water. That
had been days before.

  Now the place was a raucous tomb,
the megaphone of many voices, the lap-
ping waters and crying wind and thud-
ding wreckage.

He could see nothing downtown,

southward. All of it was gone, swal-
lowed alive by the rapacious night.

  Spudsy hit his shoulder and yelled:
“They got twenty-two feet of water
down there! And still rising!"

  Perry shuddered. “Blaine said the
army might dynamite the levees and let
the W'abash go through Cheoke!” he
yelled back. “That would ease the pres-
sure at the fork and let the waters re-
cede some. It might keep the crest from
breaking over the levees!"

  “They’ll have to do it!” Spudsy
cried. “They’ll have to do it or the crest
of the Wabash will wash right in and
you won’t ever see this burg again."
“Where’s the boat!”

  “Right here on the marquee! I’ll
show you!”

  Spudsy Gill, his dirty trench coat
thrust between his legs by the battering
wind, stumbled across the marquee to
the opposite side. Perry followed,
fighting to keep his balance as the gale
caught his equipment case behind his
shoulder and tried to spin it around.
When he reached Spudsy, Spudsy was
kneeling down. Perry knelt too.

   It was the corner of the marquee and
there was some slight respite from the
needle-like rain. “Right here," said
Spudsy hoarsely. “Right under this tar-
paulin.”

  “Your own !” Perry gasped.

  “Paid a guy a hundred bucks for it
day before yesterday,” Spudsy said.
“Five sawbucks for a scow like this!
I hope it floats. I locked it to the
marquee cables here. Duck!” A tin pail
came flying by them and crashed into
the theatre front with a terrific smash.
It fell into the eddying water below,
wrong side up, and immediately sank
from sight.

  Spudsy Gill sighed. “I dunno. I
think we’re nuts. No rag is worth
shooting pictures for on a night like
72

ARGOSY

this. We’re crazy. We oughta go back
to the office and keep our tootsies
warm.”

  “I can’t,” Perry said soberly. “Mr.
Blaine asked me to get these pictures
if humanly possible.”

  Spudsy looked disgusted. “You and
your ethics,” he snapped. “It’s all right
for your Mr. Blaine to ask for pictures.
He don’t have to risk his neck for a
couple of shots of a millionaire and his
granddaughter which won’t be remem-
bered more than a day if you get them
at all. Old Johnathan Beard’ll pose for
you, maybe, and you’ll take a shot.
Then Blaine will caption it: Millionaire
Evacuating Home in Flood Area. And
that’ll be that. . . . Remember, Perry,
the readers ain’t gonna see this skiff
and this wind and rain, and this hell
and high water, and you getting your
gams wet and catching cold and damn
near drowning.”

  Perry smiled. “I thought you were
the hard-boiled guy, Spudsy, who got
the foto at any price.”

  “I am,” Spudsy snarled. “But I also
got brains enough to know when to
stop trying! If I weren’t afraid that
you might catch something big and
show me up—” He cursed underbreath.
“All right, let’s launch the Queen Mary
here and get under way.”

  “Right.”

  They pulled the tarpaulin off the
boat. It was a small job and Perry felt
a little colder when he saw it, and his
stomach got very numb. It couldn’t
have taken more than two people, being
no more than eight feet long. It was
flat-bottomed, low-sided and had a pair
of oars which were badly splintered on
the blades. It needed a paint job badly
and Perry wondered at the moment
how long it would float.

  Spudsy Gill unlocked the chain
which fastened the craft to the marquee

cable and fixed an open hitch. “You
row, Duke,” he said. “You got the old
muscle. Me, I ain’t been living right.”
He coughed in a bad imitation. “Be-
sides you were the guy who crewed at
collitch, no?”

  “Okay,” Perry said grimly. “Let’s
get the scow in the water and make a
try.”

T^ACH took an end. Spudsy got the
^ bow, which was lighter, and they
slid the skiff up over the marquee edge.
“Careful when you drop her,” Perry
snapped. “We don’t want any water in
her. She’s bad enough as is.”

   “Right,”

  “All together—drop!”

   They let go. The skiff fell about three
feet and when it struck the water it
made a hollow plop and pushed two
combs of water out on either side of
the beam.

  “Come on,” Spudsy yelled, leaping
from the marquee. He landed in the
stern and for a second, Perry wondered
whether or not the bottom might fall
out of the dory from the shock. There
was a swish of water again from under
the hull and Spudsy quickly fell down
to the seat, dragging his covered
camera with him. “Throw me my
bulbs.”

  Perry tossed down Spudsy’s half-a-
dozen flash bulbs, then lowered his own
gleaming wet equipment case into the
bottom and stepped down from the
marquee to the rower’s thwart. Spudsy
cast loose the chain. Perry picked up
the right oar, braced it against the mar-
quee, and shoved them out into the in-
undated street. Then he got both oars
in the locks and steadied the skiff in
the current, mindful of the sodden
thuds against the sides of the boat
where jetsam struck now and then.
“Which way?” he yelled at Spudsy
HELL AND HIGH WATER

73

on the rear thwart. Out in the street,
the current was swift and the wind got
in its work and sound and carried his
voice back into his throat as he faced
its stiffness and slanting rain. “Which
way, Spudsy?”

  Spudsy leaned forward, cupping his
hands around his mouth. “Head the
way she stands now! North! I can see
torches way up there—must be on dry
ground—or even wet ground in this
rain! Up on the hill where the water
hasn’t reached yet! Torches! Can you
make it?”

  Perry didn’t know the answer to that
one. He began to row, aware that his
trousers were definitely ruined. He
glanced at the soaked and grimy legs
in regret and wondered whether or not
Mr. Kennebonk, in the bookkeeping de-
partment, would allow him a new suit
on the expense account. It seemed the
ethical thing to do for him; after all,
he had spoiled this one on behalf of the
Chronicle.

  He rowed in long, strong, sweeping
pulls, feathering his oars on the thrust
and clicking the blades over vertically
when he dipped them. The little boat
jerked ahead rythmically with his
strokes, Spudsy’s head rocking on his
shoulders with each quick spurt.
Spudsy kept saying: “Little to the
right. . . hold it. . . straight ahead, my
fine tar, anchors a weigh . , . hold it . , .
to the left. . . big oil barrel . . . watch
it.. . heave ho my hearty . . . come on,
you lazy salt, give it the works . .

   Perry let the little ape rave on. The
sound of Spudsy Gill’s voice made the
night seem less tangible, gave the skiff
something of the air of a backroom.
Spudsy was taut enough in the gloom
to sound soberly tight, even if he hadn’t
had a drink in two days.

  They moved northward with star-
tling speed, and Perry knew his

prowess at the oars was hardly respon-
sible. It was something like having a
tail wind in a plane, and a lucky break.
They could see barrels and wagons
float by now and then, and once they
hit the submerged top of a stranded
car. Perry felt the hair rise on his neck
as the bow went up, then slid off.

  “Whew!” Spudsy whistled. “Close
but no cee-gar! Take it easy, Duke.
We’re almost there! I can see high
ground! And men—soldiers up there—
keep on a-rowing, tar, keep on a-row-
in’!”

  Perry gritted his teeth. His arms
were aching a little and he felt cold.
He flexed his fingers a little and kept
straining. His face hurt where the
spears of rain lanced against his cheeks
and sometimes stung his eyes beneath
the brim of his dismal hat. All this for
a snapshot—that’s what it would
amount to—of a millionaire who prob-
ably wouldn’t be found.

   Oh, well. . . .

TT TOOK a long time. An awfully
long time. Perry was panting when
they finally grounded. The crunch of
the boat’s bow against the gritty wet
dirt—ground above water—was the
sweetest music his ears had ever heard.

  “Hop out!” Spudsy called, “Out and
beach her!”

  Perry picked up his equipment case
and put it out on the ground and then
raised up the bow and pulled the boat
far up on land. In the stern, Spudsy
began to let go a display of verbal fire-
works. He came out of that boat like
an athlete, clinging to his camera and
flash bulbs.

   “You dirty so and so,” he told Perry.
“You raised her nose up so high, you
let water in over the back seat and wet
my fanny! A fine thing! People will
think I’m in my second childhood or
74

ARGOSY

something. Look, here comes the
Army!”

  They plodded up the knoll to meet
the two soldiers who ran down to see
them. There were bright torches on the
hill and a sign across the road, block-
ing it. Perry saw one of the soldiers
was a lieutenant. The other, who car-
ried a rifle, was a private. The lieuten-
ant called to them.

  “You men!” he said. “Did you come
up from the city?”

  “We’re news cameramen,” Perry
Hilton explained. “Yes, we just came
up from Vine Street in the boat.”

  The lieutenant frowned. “Bad down
there?”

  “It ain’t good exactly,” said Spudsy.
“Water’s getting higher uptown all the
time. I guess most of the people are
out, huh?”

  The lieutenant nodded. “All gone up
to the hotel on Pike Hill over there.
That’ll probably be the only dry spot
around here for a day or two. This is
a helluva thing. We need more men
in here but they can’t get through now.
You didn't see any looting?”

  “Brother,” said Spudsy, “there’s
nothing to loot. It's all under water. If
I’d found a film store, I’d have looted
it and damned your wet bullets—I need
film that bad. No, mister, the rivers
have the situation well in hand down-
town . .

  “Look,” Perry said. “Which way to
Cheoke Valley?”

  “Straight ahead,” said the lieu-
tenant. “It begins after Pike Hill there.
You can look down into the valley
from the hill. . . . Hey, you guys aren’t
going down into Cheoke Valley, are
you? Why, I’ve got my men down in
there now evacuating the place. We’re
going to dynamite the north levee at
six this morning and fill that valley
with the Wabash River. You keep out.”

  “Wait a second,” Perry said. “You
don’t understand this. We’ve got to go
down into the valley. We’ll get out of
it before six. This is an assignment for
our papers. We understand your warn-
ing and we’ll get out in time.”

  “Yeah,” Spudsy said fervently.
“You don’t have to worry about that
none, mister.”

  “You’re both crazy,” said the
soldier. “Don’t know when you’re well
off. Well, go ahead. But don’t say I
didn’t tell you. Up she goes at six bells
and that valley will be a river faster’n'
Johnstown became wet. On your way.”
They left the lieutenant and his rifle-
man and plodded up the muddy road
toward Pike Hill. The road was lighted
by torches along the way every now'
and then and it wasn’t so bad. The
lightning began to scissor the sky now
too, sheet lightning, glary, flaring
across heaven without the benefit of
thunder. When it detonated sound-
lessly, they could see the white skin of
the hotel on the crest of the hill, with
its leafless trees standing out against
the horizon like black skeletons be-
seeching the sky.

   The rain stopped its intensified fall
and changed to a mizzling curtain, like
opaque fog. It felt a little better but
just about killed visibility. When they
reached the summit of Pike Hill, they
avoided the turn into the hotel grounds
and started on down the other side into
Cheoke Valley itself.

  “This,” Spudsy Gill grunted as they
plodded on, “is just like stepping down
into your own grave and knowing ex-
actly what you’re doing.”

  “Don’t lose your nerve,” Perry said.
“We’ll get out of here before six.”
“Lose my nerve?” Spudsy laughed
harshly. “I never lost my nerve in my
life.” He laughed again. “It wouldn’t
be ethical for a fotog to lose his nerve,
HELL AND HIGH WATER

75

would it, Duke? But I don’t have to
like this setup one bit. And, brother
rat, I don’t.”

  A NOTHER soldier loomed up out
of the scud and Perry choked
back an ejaculation of surprise. The
fellow came out of the gloom like a
risen corpse and looked very white
when he bumped into them, being just
as scared.

“Hey, you guys!” he gasped. “Get
outa here. Get’n the hell outa here!”
“So we were told previously,” Perry
said. “We’ll get out in time, soldier.
How is the evacuation going?”

  “Bad,” said the soldier. “Boy, you
try finding houses in this soup and
telling people to scram. They just won’t
do it. They just won’t believe we’re
really gonna blast.”

  “But you are,” Spudsy said, making
it a query.

  “Doggone right we are,” said the
soldier. “You newsguys? Thought so.
Well, get this. I was up on the north
levee about two this morning when it
was pouring cats and dogs. And there
was Major Renot of the 34th
Engineers. Says he, ‘If we don’t blast
this levee soon, the Wabash is gonna
meet the Ohio and back right up to
Lake Michigan and you won’t save a
soul. If we do blast, we’ll ease the pres-
sure and save the city.’ So another guy
—a shavetail—he says: ‘But, Major,
what about the people in the valley?’
And the Major just spits once and
says, ‘There’s thirty thousand people in
that city and there’s maybe a thousand
in the valley. Evacuate the valley and
we’ll blow this levee out at dawn.’ ”
The soldier paused and drew long
breaths. “But the doggone fools just
won’t get out. They’ll drown sure.”
“Look,” said Perry. “Which way to
the Jonathan Beard estate, soldier?”

  “That the big castle down there?”
asked the soldier.

  “Doubtless,” Spudsy remarked.
“Doubtless, General.”

  “Funny guy, huh? Anyway, you go
down this road until you come to a
sign. Says Millstone Turnpike. Then
go left. The castle is up on the other
side of the hill, ain’t in the valley floor.
It’s up a little higher than most. You’ll
find it.”

  “Thanks,” Perry said.

  “And remember, six bells and bam !”
“How,” asked Spudsy with a sigh,
“could we forget?”

   They left the soldier and plodded on.
The farther they went, the darker it
got. But the sheet lightning showed
them the road intermittently and the
going wasn’t hard at all. As they pro-
gressed into the valley hollow, the
ground began to get soft and marshy.

  Finally they reached the signpost—
Millstone Turnpike. They kept to the
left and started across the valley floor
itself. It began to rain again. First in
sweeping gusts, and then in a sudden
and breathtaking downpour which
soaked through their coats and
drenched them to the skin with its cold
penetration.

  The wind wasn’t strong down here
though. Perry Hilton, in the lead, sud-
denly stopped walking and snapped:
“Wait a second.”

  “For cryin’ out loud,” said Spudsy.
gasping, “don’t do that! My nerves
aren’t so hot. And this hole is a ban-
shee stamping ground if it’s anything
at all.”

  “Keep quiet,” Perry said. “I heard
something.”

  “Wh-what?”

  “Listen.”

  They stood stockstill, listening. At
first there was nothing except the si-
lence of many noises: the falling rain,
76

ARGOSY

the whistling wind, the faint distant
ranting of the angry rivers, and the re-
mote grumbling of faraway thunder.

  Spudsy Gill shivered and swung his
free arm, flexing his fingers. “I hear
plenty and I don’t hear nothing.”
“Listen.”

   They both heard it then, as the wind
dropped for a second. The cry, weak
and tremulous, reached them on its
faintest volume, barely audible above
the conglomeration of other sounds.
The word was “Help—” It sent an
electric tingle coursing down Perry’s
back so that he twitched sharply as
though from a violent chill.

  “Spudsy!” he said sharply. “Come
on! It's over here! It came from this
way!”

  “I heard it,”- Spudsy replied. “Go
ahead. I’ll follow you.”

   They ran as fast as they could in the
dark. Presently they stopped. Perry
called: “Hello! Anybody there!”
“Yes!” replied a voice in the gloom.
“Right here! Hurry please! Straight
ahead—I think I can see you. Please
hurry!”

  They ran. They hadn’t gone twenty
feet when Spudsy fell flat on his face,
cussed like a trooper, then fell strangely
still for a few seconds, and finally
screeched: “Perry!”

  Perry went back to him. “Where are
you, Spudsy?”

  “Right at your f-f-feet,” Spudsy
choked. “Duke—listen—I tripped on
something—I think—”

  “What?”

   “I—uh—I think it’s a stiff,” Spudsy
chattered. “You got a light?”

  “Your own matches,” Perry said.
“How about them?”

  “Soaking wet.”

   Perry heard Spudsy’s teeth chatter-
ing. “I’ve got my storm lighter,” he
said. “Wait a second.” He reached into

his wet clothes and pulled the lighter
out. He stooped down beside Spudsy
and spun the flint wheel. The lighter
ignited on the first try.

“Gawd!” Spudsy breathed in horror.
In the xanthic light, they saw a
corpse; it was a soldier, a non-com
with a rifle strung across his back and
a .45 caliber Colt pistol in his hand.

■ His tin hat was next to his head, its
turtle-back down so that it looked like
a rain bowl. There was a bullet hole in
the soldier’s head, and there were blood
stains all over his rain-drenched chest.
He had blue eyes which were wide
open, like his mouth.

  “Gawd!” Spudsy said again. “Some-
body bumped him!”

   “Please, please . . .” the helpless
voice cried again, so close now that
Perry Hilton and Spudsy both spun
around.

  The lighter illumined the owner of
the voice. It was a girl, young and
good-looking. She was lying on her
back, her head raised up to spot them.
She wasn’t more than ten feet from
the soldier’s corpse. She looked scared.

Ill

THE cigarette lighter was weaken-
ing. Perry walked over to the girl
and knelt down beside her. “What is
it?” he asked. “What’s wrong? This
lighter’s fading.”

  “My foot,” she gasped. “I was run-
ning. I stepped in a hole—can’t get my
foot out.”

  “Ankle sprained, do you think?”
  “No. At least, the foot doesn’t hurt.

I think it’s just stuck. If you could dig
around—”

  Perry got a better look. It was a
fox hole. The foot was wedged in
tightly and there wasn’t much the girl
could do about it. Perry found a thin
HELL AND HIGH WATER

77

sharp rock and began to pound the
earth around the hole until it finally
gave away. Still, the shoe remained
wedged. He had to yank on her leg
before she made it.

   The lighter went out. The girl didn’t
get right up. She waited a minute,
while circulation went back into the
foot. She said briefly, “Thanks loads.
I’ll be all right in a second,” and then
fell silent. Perry heard Spudsy rum-
maging in the equipment case.

  “What’s on your mind?”

   “I gotta get a foto of that stiff,”
Spudsy said. “Gimme the film you
promised.”

   “Wait a second.” Perry reached in
and pulled out one of the packs and
handed it to Spudsy. “Only six of
those. That was the deal.”

  “Did I say no?”

  “And look,” Perry said. “Load my
Graphic and grab me a shot too, -will
you? I’ve got to help this girl.”

   “Sure, Duke,” said Spudsy with un-
natural spontaneity. “Anything for an
ethical pal.”

  Perry went back and knelt beside
her. It was dark, of course, and he
couldn’t see her face, but he could re-
member its soft white oval and the
clean trim features, flanked by wet
brown hair. Her eyes had been blue,
he recalled. Blue and big. “x-\re you bet-
ter now?” he asked. “I’m Perry Hil-
ton, news photographer for the Chi-
cago Chronicle. The anthropoid with
me is named Spudsy Gill.”

   He felt her hand grasp his arm in
the dark as she got to her feet. “My
name is Sherwood,” she said quietly.
“Ann Sherwood. It’s coincidental, but
I’m a newspaperwoman.”

  “Ann Sherwood,” said Perry. “Of
course you are. You’re on the New
York Planet. I’ve seen your stuff—a
good colyum.”

  “Thanks.” He saw her smiling
wryly as one of Spudsy’s flashes went
off, painting the dead man in its blue-
white light which came and went at
one-fiftieth of a second. “I’ve got to
find a telegraph office.”

  “Nerts,” Spudsy called over in the
dark. “There ain’t no wTire service outa
Burbank now, lady. What you want
is a radio. That’s the only connection.”
There was another flash. “And there’s
your picture, Perry, and I hope it ain’t
as good as mine.” A pause. “I’ll stick
your camera back in the case.”

  “Thanks,” Perry said. He found the
girl in the dark. “I think you’d better
come along with us, Miss Sherwood.
We’re trying to reach the Jonathan
Beard estate. We’ve got to get out of
this valley soon. You knew they were
going to dynamite the levee and flood
all this, didn’t you?”

  “Good lord—no!” She gasped. “I
might have been—well—it’s all right
now. If you hadn’t come along
though—”

  “Come on,” Spudsy said. “I don’t
hanker to get wetted down with the
Wabash. Let’s go.”

  They w^ent back to the road and
across the valley. They talked. “What
about that dead man?” Perry asked
her.

  “Sorry,” Ann Sherwood replied.
“That’s my story.”

  “That’s what I like,” said Spudsy
dryly. “Gratitude . . .”

   “Shut up,” Perry said. “She’s right.
It is her yarn. She covered it and it's
hers. That’s ethical.”

   “The devil it is. You saved her life,
didn’t you? She wouldn’t report any-
thing if you hadn’t heard her. Then
she chisels you out of a yarn—ethics!
Besides she might have bumped that
guy herself. How do we know?”
“Don’t mind him,” Perry said. “He
78

ARGOSY

wants the yarn for his own paper at
my expense.”

  “No,” she said suddenly. “He’s
right, Mr. Hilton.”

  “Perry. I’ll call you Ann. Saves
time.”

  “Right. But I’ll talk. You two—well,
it’s not so exclusive at that. Rogue
Donaven killed that soldier. But that
isn’t new. Rogue Donaven’s killed
three men in the last twelve hours.”
“Rogue Donaven!” Perry exclaimed.
“Did you hear that, Spudsy?”

  “Rogue Donaven!” Spudsy sounded
awed. “But he broke prison at Crown
Hill, Indiana, last week. That wras be-
fore we even came down to this under-
water town!”

“rpHAT’S right,” Ann Sherwood
said. “He kept undercover until
Thursday. Then a pair of Federal men
recognized him and he’s been on the
lam ever since. When my managing
editor sent me on here to cover the
flood, I came into a nice tip from one
of the G-men up at Roseville, ten miles
north. He said Rogue Donaven was in
that section, hiding out. Yesterday they
flushed him and he came south. I—
my friend tipped me again and I came
too. Donaven left a red trail behind
him all the way to Burbank. Killed
three policemen—”

  “Burbank!” cried Spudsy. “As if a
flood wasn’t bad enough, we have to
have a nice cold killer loose at the same
time! I know. I took a picture of that
rat once when he was nabbed in Chi.
He just looked at me and said : ‘I croak
guys who take pictures of me.’ And he
meant it. What happened tonight?"

  “They trailed him into Cheoke Val-
ley around midnight but the fog came
down then and they lost him for
awhile. About two hours ago, they ran
into him down at the turnpike. There

was a gunfight. They all chased him
into the dark and I came along in the
rear. That soldier—I guess he heard
the shots and came to have a look.
Anyway, Rogue Donaven doubled back
on his own trail and ran right into the
soldier—his name was Dugan—and
me. He shot Dugan three times and I
ran and he fired once at me just after
I fell. I kept quiet and he went off.”
“Gosh!” Spudsy said.

  “Which way did he go?” asked
Perry.

  Her voice was steady. “This way.
The way we’re going.”

  Simultaneously, in the quick radium-
like luminescence of a brilliant sheet of
lightning, the castle of Jonathan Beard
formed itself out of the fog and night.
The thunder spoke more abruptly and
more boldly now, and the rain came
dow'n in sheeted torrents. “I’d offer
you my coat,” Perry said to Ann Sher-
wood, “but it’s as dry as a piece of
seaweed and would only weigh you
down.”

  She laughed and touched his arm.
“Thanks, Perry. But I couldn’t be any
wetter. Is that the place?”

  “Looks like it,” Perry replied,
squinting through the rain. “I don’t
see any lights at all, do you ?”

  “I think—” Spudsy started to say.
The earth shook under their feet.
A curious lull followed during which
they all stood transfixed. The wind
seemed to have died and they did not
feel the rain. Then they heard the
sound, so much slower, finally reach-
ing them across the valley. Boom! Hol-
low and yet heavy, with a peculiar
cadence and concussion. Twice more
then that shudder and the awful
booms.

  Ann clung to Perry’s arm while
Spudsy shouted: “For God’s sake, you
don’t think—”
HELL AND HIGH WATER

  “From the north!” Perry yelled.
“The north levee!”

  Instinctively they looked back the
way they had come. Slate dawn, dirty,
wet with the falling rain, was slowly
tiptoeing across the footbridge of the
east, long delayed, and very reluctant.

  From die north levee a voice began
to speak, first in an ominous mutter
which reached their ears plainly, then
rising up into a fierce roar and finally
reaching a thunderous crescendo of un-
abated fury which shamed the honest
thunder of the storm.

  “Gawd!” Spudsy screamed. “They’ve
dynamited the levee!”

  Perry yelled: “They can't have! It
isn’t time! What time is it anyway?
We couldn’t have made such a mis-
take!”

  The lightning flared and Ann Sher-
wood saw her watch. She said shrilly:
“It’s five o’clock! It’s only five
o’clock!”

  “Daylight saving!” Spudsy shrieked.
“Don’t you see? Those soldiers are
from Fort Monmouth and they’re on
daylight saving time! They’re going
by their own watches on the whole
thing and we’re an hour out of the
way!”

  Perry heard the panic in Spudsy
Gill’s voice and he fought it down in
his own heart. “All right,” he said.
“Let’s get going. We can’t make it
back to Pike Hill. Only thing to do is
take refuge in Jonathan Beard’s castle
up on the hill there and pray to (Md
the water doesn’t go higher than the
towers. Come on!”

IV

THE front door of the great stone
house of Jonathan Beard was wide
open. None of them—Perry, Ann,
Spudsy—stopped to question why.

They dashed in, Spudsy Gill slamming
the door hard behind him and think-
ing at the same time that it would hold
back the muddy waters for a few
minutes and give him some time. He
never considered the windows.

  In the center hall of the mansion,
where it was black as pitch when the
lightnings died, they came to a halt.
“Halloo!” Perry called. “Anybody
here ?”

  “Upstairs,” came a voice, gruff and
excited. “For heaven’s sake, don’t
stand down there! Come up stairs and
hurry!”

  They skipped up the stairs, Spudsy
taking a quick lead, and Perry pushing
Ann Sherwood along. They couldn’t
see a thing and the sky remained dark
without flashes for a long time. They
reached the top of the stairs and stood
on the landing.

  “Can’t see,” Spudsy said hoarsely.

  Perry tried the lighter. It wouldn’t
work. He said: “Try a photoflash,
Spudsy. It’ll give us bearings.”

  Spudsy stuck a bulb in his Speedgun
and flashed. The lighter flared and died
quickly, but Perry spotted the next
staircase and dragged them over to it.
They climbed again.

  And now, outside the house, the
earth was gripped in a roaring rush of
mad water. They could not see it but
they could feel it, feel its vibrations
throagh the stone of the house,
charging the air itself and filling them
up with a tense expectancy.

  “Gotta get a shot,” Spudsy groaned.
“Half the Wabash river tearing
through this valley. . . . Gotta get a
picture. . . . Hurry up, hurry up—”

  There were lights at the top of the
second landing. They rushed toward
them and reached a circular room in
the north tower of the huge house.
The light was the emanation of four
80

ARGOSY

long tallow candles mounted on a table
in sterling silver candelabras.

  There were two people in the tower
room: an elderly white-haired man of
about sixty-five; a six-year-old girl
with a pretty moon face and short
blonde curls. Perry recognized them
both. The man was Jonathan Beard,
worth forty-two million dollars, re-
tired steel magnate, as grizzled an old
warrior as industry had ever spawned.
The child was Cynthia Beard, heir ap-
parent to the forty-two million dollars,
less income tax.

  She sat in her grandfather’sjap, not
very frightened really, her eyes wide
with surprise as she stared out the win-
dow into the maelstrom which had
eaten up Cheoke Valley. In her left
arm she had clenched a duck. It was
apparent that his name was Donald
and that he was the progeny of a Mr.
Disney. He was dressed like a sailor
and had his head cocked to one side as
if to say: “Iz zat so?” In her other
hand, Cynthia Beard was clenching a
big, old-fashioned Brownie camera, an
Eastman-Kodak product, vintage of
1910, taking a 127 roll film. It was a
battered job; Perry could see that it
had put thousands of snapshots behind
its fixed lens. He smiled. The child
looked so small for such a big box
camera and he wondered why—of all
her toys—she had chosen to save the
Brownie along with Donald Duck.

  “Hello!” Jonathan Beard said in a
husky voice. “Glad you made it. You
did, just about, you know. We watched
you from the window here, saw you
come across the field. There was an-
other man too. Where is he ?”

  Perry said: “No. There wasn’t any-
one else. Not as far as we know.”

  “Oh, but there was,” said Beard
earnestly. “Perhaps—I presume he
didn’t make it. Who are you?”

 “A/TY name is Hilton,” Perry said.

   J- A “This is Gill, We’re press pho-
 tographers. Had an assignment to get
 out here and take some pictures of you
 but we got caught short. This is Miss
 Sherwood, a New York newspaper-
 woman covering the flood.”

   Beard smiled. “The flood seems to
 have the upper hand with you, Miss
 Sherwood. Do sit down. You gentle-
 men are saying you came all the way
 from Burbank, risking your lives for
 pictures of me?”

^ “With the granddaughter!” Spudsy
 said. “Look pretty, now.” And he
 flashed a bulb and startled the child:
 Perry wheeled on him and snapped:
 “What’s the matter with you anyhow ?
 Can’t you wait until Mr. Beard says
 all right?”

   “Not me, Duke!” Spudsy snarled.
 “I’m a fotog, see? I don't have ethics.
 But I get the pictures. Go lay an egg.”
 “Never mind, Hilton,” Beard said,
 frowning at Spudsy. “Go ahead and
 take your picture. It seems little enough
 after your trip here.”

   “But, sir,” Perry asked, “why on
 earth are you still here ? Didn’t you
 get a warning? Weren’t you asked to
 go to higher ground at Pike’s Hill ?”
 “The servants are all gone,” Beard
 explained quietly. “All in panic. I’m
 an elderly man, Mr. Hilton, not built
 for running around at night in such
 a storm. And this child—as a matter
 of fact, I thought, and still think, that
 the house here is the safest place this
 side of the valley. The water will reach
 the house, yes, but I don’t think it will
 ever inundate the $lace to any extent.
 And this house will easily withstand
 the rush of water. It was built to with-
 stand anything.”

  “Yeah?” Spudsy Gill was at the
 other window. He’d leveled his Speed
 Graphic and left the lens open on time.

                5	A—24
HELL AND HIGH WATER

81

A lightning flash had made a picture
for him and he closed the lens. "Listen,
mister. It may have been built right
but it wouldn’t withstand that stuff if
the water gets high enough. Take a
look when the lightning breaks.”

  They all crowded to the windows.
The lightning flared. They saw the
valley below them, saw it all in every
bit of its terrifying aspect; they saw
the huge wall of filthy black water
which came down the valley like an
express train, cushioning itself up on
the slopes on either side and sweeping
everything in its path; they saw four
white clapboard houses, one upside
down, being hurled down the torrent
with splintering, crushing force; they
saw the three empty tank cars, the
empty tanks having made the steel cars
buoyant, floating down on the wash
like little corks, their road insignias
quite plain: CS&W Lines.

  They saw all that and the room grew
still as they watched the water crawl
up and up the slope, reaching out its
watery fringe for the Beard estate and
nearing the level of the house's base
all the time. Once—in a flash—they
saw the big hotel atop Pike Hill across
the valley. It looked so safe. No river
could ever reach it.

  Perry broke the grim silence. “Per-
haps I’d better get my pictures now—
if you don’t mind, Mr. Beard. And I
really shouldn’t miss that torrent, al-
though it will never reproduce as it is,
with its sound/’

  “That’s what is frightening, ” A%«i
Sherwood whispered. “The uproar and
'the madness of it all. . .

  Spudsy had been taking quite a few
pictures. And Perry suddenly recalled
that he had given only six negatives
to the little ape-man with the gold
tooth. His face clouded. Spudsy saw
the look and began to fade into the

 6	A—24

shadows. Perry crossed the room and
went for his equipment case. Before
he reached it, he was stopped.

  “Hold it, you muggs,” said the
voice. “We got to get a couple of
things straight. Hold it."

T T was not a nice voice. It was sharp,
coarse, dangerous. Perry turned
slowly and saw the man in the door-
way. The candles illumined his fea-
tures very plainly. It was a harsh gaunt
face with a long purplish scar, quite
colorful from the cold rain on it, down
the side of the man’s right cheek. No
hat, no tie, his clothes a complete
wreck, the stranger stood in the door-
way, motionless as a statue, a glisten-
ing nickel-plated revolver in his right
hand.

  “Gawd!" Spudsy Gill said sharply,
the first to break the cold spell. “It’s
him—Rogue Donaven!”

  Rogue Donaven’s scar jerked and he
snapped his head and gun around.
Spudsy meanwhile, had instinctively
sighted his Graphic and he pressed the
release which flashed the bulb and took
the picture.

  Rogue Donaven’s eyes disappeared
under his brows. He said briefly: “I
croak guys what take pictures of me.”
And he raised the revolver and fired
once.

  The slug went clean through the
Graphic’s valuable lens, punctured the
film in the back of the camera, broke
through the back itself and pinked into
Spudsy Gill’s chest, knocking the cam-
era from his hands and thrusting him
down to the floor on his knees, from
where he fell headlong to his face.

  Perry took two quick steps toward
Donaven but stopped w^hen the gun
hit a line with his stomach. “You want
some too ?" Rogue Donaven asked.

  “Perry!” Ajin Sherwood gasped.
82

ARGOSY

“For God’s sake, Perry, don’t—”

  “The lady’s right, Hilton,” said
Jonathan Beard. “Don’t be foolish.”
Cynthia Beard, startled by the ear-
splitting crack of the gun and the flame
which had jumped at Spudsy, was cry-
ing. Beard tried to comfort her.

  Perry halted, his arms hanging
loosely at his sides. This certainly, he
figured, was the hour for ethics. He
asked quietly: “Have you any objec-
tion to my examining my ff^jnd?”
Rogue Donaven laughed. “Not me,
buddy. Your friend’ll never be deader.
Go have a look. ...” And as Perry
walked over and knelt down beside
Spudsy, Don a ven turned back and
pointed a finger and said: “You, there
—you’re Old Man Beard, ain't you?”
Never mind lyin’. I know you are.
the guy with all the bucks.” He
laughed. “But you’re gonna pay out
some of them millions soon, mister.
To me. You’ll buy back a little package
I’m gonna hold for you.”

  Ann Sherwood put her hand to her
mouth. “He’s going to take the
child—”

  “Sure he is,” Rogue Dona ven said
evenly. “Sure he is. And why not, huh?
I’ve had bulls on my tail for the last
week. Bulls and G-heat and I’m sick
o’ it. I’m gettin’ myself protection.
This flood was a break for me. It killed
my trail and it led me right into an
insurance policy . . . Sure, I’m takin’
that kid, see? And you can tell the Gs
that she gets bumped if a single one
of ’em makes a pass at me from now
on.”

  Beard groaned : “You—you wouldn’t
be that low—”

  “Keep your shirt on, grandpop,”
Rogue Donaven snapped. “You’ll get
your innin’s later on. When I get clear r
with the kid, you can buy her back . . .
Now send her over here. And if yout

 don’t, I put the slug on her where she
 stands.”

   Perry meanwhile had been examin-
 ing Spudsy who was alive and breath-
 ing hard, unconscious. The camera was
 a wreck. So were the negatives. The
 Speedgun was okay. Perry lifted it off,
 screwed a fresh bulb into the socket
 while the Rogue talked. Spudsy’s
 wound didn’t bleed much but he looked
 sick. Perry reached in Spudsy’s pocket
 for a handkerchief and found the
 blackjack.

   He should have remembered. Spudsy
 always had carried the blackjack for
 protection when a guy got nasty about
 a picture.

   Perry slipped the blackjack into his
 right hand and took up the Speedgun
 in his left.

   He faced Rogue Donaven, not ten
 feet away.

  “Come on,” Donaven growled.
 “Send the little brat over here. If I
 go get her myself, I slap you silly—”
 “Wait a minute, Rogue,” Perry said.
 Rogue Donaven had taken a step or
 two forward. He halted abruptly and
 faced Perry with the leveled gun.
 “You’re askin’ for it, big boy. Don’t
 say I didn’t—”

   “Wait a minute,” Perry said quietly

 "DOTH were poised. The one with
 the gun, the other with the Speed-
 gun. Both men were taut, wound up.

   Perry said slowly: “You see this
 bulb in this socket?”

   Rogue Donaven’s eyes flicked down
to the bulb. Perry’s eyes watched. The
split second when Donaven’s focused
on the photo-flash, he pressed the but-
ton. Eight feet from Rogue Donaven’s
face and squarely in his eyes, the bulb
.flashed brilliantly as Perry stepped
.aside. The revolver crashed and
'missed.
HELL AND HIGH WATER

  Perry stepped outside the gun
muzzle, swinging the blackjack in his
right hand with everything he had.

  Rogue Donaven couldn’t see any-
thing but black bursting circles. Three
thousand lumens of light against a
wide open iris did that sort of thing.
It took the better part of half a minute
for the irises to readjust themselves
too.

  Perry only needed two seconds. The
blackjack crashed across Rogue Dona-
ven’s forehead. Perry felt the bone
give under the impact of the lead
frankfurter. Donaven pitched forward
on his face without a sound and laid
still.

  “No pictures!” Spudsy Gill whis-
pered. “Damn it—he—he broke—that
camera—no pictures—of a scene—like
that—”

  “Spudsy!” Perry exclaimed.

  “I—I feel pretty good,” said
Spudsy, fluttering his eyes. “Don’t
hurt much—and I—I ain’t weak so
much. Don’t hurt none—to breathe—
so I guess the slug—didn't hit—my
lung. . . . Listen, Duke, was—was it
ethical—to fracture that mugg’s—
skull? ’Cause I think you did.”

  Ann Sherwood ran from the win-
dow. “The water's rising,” she said.
“I’m afraid we’ll have to leave—”
Jonathan Beard’s face was white.
“But we can’t leave,” he replied with
grim finality. “Look down. The crest
is already over our entrance.”

  “Duke,” whispered Spudsy, “I gotta
tell you something.”

   “Yes?” Perry said.

  “I played you dirt. No—no ethics.
Me all over.”

  “Don’t get you, Spudsy.”

  “When they dynamited—lost my
nerve—dropped my camera back there
. . . When we got here, I lifted your
camera, stole your film—”

  “You don’t know what you're say-
ing, Spudsy/’

   “Sure I do. I figured you were a nice
guy but that a scoop in pix was a
scoop. I lifted your camera and your
film. Rogue busted your camera.
Mine is down in the valley. Sorry,
Duke. That’s—the game—”

  “Listen, you sawed-off ape,” Perry
said. “You’re spilling this because
you’re afraid you’ll die. But you won’t.
And when you’re well again, I’m going
to give you a going over.”

  Spudsy sighed. “And I won’t blame
you a bit, pal.”

  Perry Hilton stood up. All this
struggling, all this risk, plodding and
running and rowing through hell and
high water to get a picture—and when
he got there, the cupboard was bare.

  He went to the equipment case and
opened it. Spudsy had told the truth.
There was no camera inside. There
were flash bulbs and the half gross of
sensitized Velox printing paper, four
inches by five, glossy normal.

  “Wait a second!” Perry said, half-
aloud.

  He stared at the child in Jonathan
Beard's lap, the child who still clung
to the 191 o Kodak Brownie. An idea
hit him. He smiled thinly and whis-
pered: “Oh, Spudsy, I’m going to
show you. ... I’m going to show you
what a fotog misses and what a techni-
cian doesn’t . .

  The great stone house was trem-
bling. Perry went to the window and
put his arm around Ann and said:
“Don’t be frightened.”

  “But look,” she said softly. “The
walls won’t stand that. They’re
crumbling below. Look down.”

   He did. He could see but faintly, yet
he saw enough. Three CS&W crude oil
cars had been caught in a water trap
under their window, and were pound-
84

ARGOSY

ing their steel tonnage against the side
of the house, aided and abetted by the
terrific force of the maelstrom in the
valley. Their blows struck shivers
through the house.

  Jonathan Beard nodded, looking
older and more haggard. “They
smashed the garage like tinder,” he
said hollowly, “and it was made of
granite stone.”

  Perry nodded. He turned Ann
around. “Whatever happens,” he said,
“don’t be afraid. I think we can live
through this, but not in this house. In
any case—” he suddenly bent down
and kissed her. “I wanted to do that
later,” he said. “But perhaps there
might not be the chance.”

  She clung to him without speaking.

A FEW seconds later, he disengaged
himself and said: “Wait.”

He went to the child, Cynthia, and
knelt down beside her. “Hello, honey,”
he said. “You’re not afraid, are you?”
“No,” she replied. “Not with my
granddaddy.”

  “Look, honey,” he said, “I take pic-
tures and my camera is broken. Would
you loan me yours until I get another
one? I promise to take good care of it.”
Cynthia thought it over and then
looked at her grandfather. “I’d like to
lend it to the man, Granddaddy.”

  “It’s quite all right, dear,” said
Beard gently. “Of course, you must
help Mr. Hilton. He is helping you.”

  She gave Perry the* old Brownie.
No film in it, of course, as he had ex-
pected. Perry thanked her gravely and
stood up. It was dawn now, yet the
sky remained dark. He asked Ann
what time it was and she said six-ten.
He took a reading with his Weston
meter and found he couldn’t get the
light value needle to move. That was
good.

  Now he took out his pen knife and
cut a thin slit in the top of the Brownie
at the back. He opened the box of sen-
sitized paper, praying that it was as
dark as it looked so that the paper
would not fog. He loaded the Speed-
gun he had salvaged from the camera
wreckage and then set the Brownie on
time. He sighted Jonathan Beard and
the child in the reflex view finder,
opened the shutter, flashed the bulb,
after having thrust a four-by-five con-
tact printing paper down in the slit
where film would normally have been.
The picture taken, he withdrew the
paper and quickly placed it in the black
envelope which came with the paper.

  It seemed to work, Perry thought.
He loaded again, slipping sensitized
paper into the camera, flashing a bulb.
This time he shot Rogu<f Donaven on
the floor, along with Spudsy wounded.

  “You so and so! Making paper nega-
tives! You're scooping me on my own
shooting! Oh, you dog! This is tragic
irony if I ever heard the words! And
it’ll work, it’ll work!”

  “How can it work?” Ann cried.

  “He’s making a negative image on
paper instead of a positive,” Spudsy
explained. “That’s what comes of
being ethical and smart instead of just
smart, like me. . . .”

   The house trembled as the tank cars
walloped the stones and churned them
into powder.

  Perry said: “Can we have rope, Mr.
Beard?”

  “Yes," he said. “In the closets.
Why?”

  “We’re all roping together,” Perry
said. “We’re leaving here. I don’t think
the house will stand. We’re going to
have a wild ride, everybody. We’re
going to have a tank car for a bronco.
It’ll float right side up because of the
weighted bottom.”
HELL AND HIGH WATER

85

  “The trucks?"

  “They must have dropped off long
ago,” said Perry. “But those tankers
still float upright. It’ll be a matter of
hanging on and hoping we don’t hit
anything. We’ve got to do it—”

  “I can’t,” said Beard hopelessly.
“I’m an old man.”

  “Hell,” Spudsy said. “I can and I’m
shot. So you can.”

  Perry went for the rope.

V

rpHAT was a wild ride. They saw
Cheoke Valley in all its muddy,
horror-filled, wreckage filled, water-
filled desolation as they shot down the
valley, five of them, all roped together
astride the top of a floating tank car,
roped too to the hand grabs atop the
tanker’s twin-valved dome and to the
handrailing around the plump body of
the car. They were lucky. The car they
had been fortunate enough to make
was bigger than the others, a sixteen
thousand gallon job which floated high
and was big enough to be a protection
if they hit anything. But they didn’t
hit anything.

  Down the valley, they bobbed and
tossed that morning, and Perry took
thirty-eight of the most wonderful
flood pictures that the Chicago
Chronicle was ever to publish; some
he took by the numerous lightning
flashes which shot down the valley;
some he took of closer scenes with the
Kalart Speedgun.

  But finally the sky began to lose its
black-leaden hue and really took on
a sooty gray color as it started to
lighten. And Perry knew that his pic-
ture taking was nearly over.

  He had one paper left in the camera
and he sought frantically for some-
thing to shoot. And it occurred to him

that he had missed the most dramatic
picture of them all: five people, a mil-
lionaire, a child, a woman, a wounded
man, himself, riding a storm-tossed
tank car down a flooded valley toward
the Ohio River.

  Since he took the picture, there were
only four in it. He could not put him-
self before the camera on a tank car.
But he did take it with a flash bulb.
And when he saw their faces in the
momentary glare of the bulb, he knew
he had taken something priceless.

  That was the last paper negative he
could make. It stopped raining and in
half an hour, a weak sun thrust itself
out through a veil of mist below the
sodden clouds.

  At eleven o’clock, tired from cling-
ing to the battered tank car, they all
noticed suddenly that the terrible pitch-
ing and rolling had stopped. They
found themselves floating with breath-
less speed in a broad waterway which
looked as though it were a mile across
and might have been at that.

  They clung in toward shore through
no fault of their own. Perry said: I
think we’re in the Ohio River! We
must have gone clean through the val-
ley and out into the river the way the
army engineers wanted the Wabash to
go. That means the pressure must have
eased up on Burbank.”

  Spudsy groaned. “And where will
we wind up? In New Orleans. I could
be seasick.”

  “You sound pretty good,” Perry
said.

  “I can’t understand it,” said Spudsy.
“And me shot.”

  “It's only a flesh wound,” said
Perry. “I looked you over when you
fell. The bullet must have lost all its
umph after going through the camera.
It hit your breastbone and richocheted
out again. You’ve really got two holes
86

ARGOSY

in you but they don’t mean anything.
We’ll get you fixed up soon. The slug
never did get in more than an inch.”
“Pal,” said Spudsy, gulping, “you
relieve my mind.”

  At noon, the tank car, caught in a
whirlpool of floating wreckage, was
forced into a river bank and jammed
hard into the mud there. It clung.
“Quick,” Perry said. “Ropes off! Get
ashore before this thing loses its grip
and goes off again.”

  He untied himself and leaped to the
river bank. Beard passed him the child
first and he sat her down. Ann Sher-
wood came next. Then Beard helped
Spudsy off. He finally came himself.
Two minutes later, the car jerked loose
from the mud bank and went riding
off down the river headed for the Gulf
of Mexico fifteen hundred miles
away. . . .

  They found they were in Shawnee-
town, a place of a little more than a
thousand inhabitants. But the Red
Cross had made Shawneetown a base
for Burbank, and there were hundreds
of soldiers all over the place, all mov-
ing up into the flood area.

  They got Spudsy to a jammed hos-
pital for treatment and left him there.
Jonathan Beard asked to go to Chi-
cago. So did Ann. Perry scouted
around and found a lieutenant.

  “Listen,” he said, “can I get a plane
for Chicago? A plane or a train?”
“You can get a train,” said the lieu-
tenant. “There’s one shooting back to
Chicago in twenty minutes. The depot
is three blocks over that way. Brother,
you look damp. Were you caught up-
river?”

“Caught isn’t the word,” Perry
grinned. “Thanks for the information.
What’s the latest on Burbank?”
“They’re coming out all right,” said
the lieutenant. “The engineers flooded

Cheoke Valley early this morning. The
pressure eased on Burbank. And any-
way the crest of the Wabash has
passed. They say the water is receding
already up in Burbank. They’ll be
cleaned out by tomorrow. Cairo is
the town to have a headache now. The
crest has gone downstream.”
“Thanks,” Perry said.

       Thursday afternoon, two days
later, Spudsy Gill was lying in
a white bed in the Shawneetown Hos-
pital, feeling too darn good to be in
a hospital and complaining about the
service and the looks of his nurses,
when there was a knock at his door
and it opened. Perry Hilton and Ann
Sherwood walked in, each carrying a
newspaper.

  “Hello, Spudsy.” Perry waved.
“How do you feel ?”

  Spudsy groaned. “I feel terrible. A
lot you care, going off and leaving me
marooned in this one-horse town. . .
His eyes gleamed. “What you got?”
Perry handed over a copy of the
Chicago Chronicle. Spudsy stared at
the headlines, saw the story By Ann
Sherwood: exclusive to the Chronicle
and the New York Planet. He opened
it up, saw the flood pictures. The paper
negatives had worked perfectly. Not
only that but the very texture of the
paper had imparted to the positives
made therefrom a canvas-like grain
which made the fotos look almost like
paintings.

  “Gorsh!” Spudsy breathed. “Perry
—you got something there—” He
peered through them, muttering.
Finally he came to the one which the
Chronicle had printed in eight by ten
inches, the last picture, the four on
the tank car. Spudsy sighed. “That,”
he said, “is a gem. I suppose it’s ex-
clusively the Chronicle's?”
HELL AND HIGH WATER

  “Yes.”

  “You’re a sap. You could have made
a grand or more out of the sale and
resale of that particular shot.”

  “That wouldn't have been ethical,”
Perry said.

  Spudsy groaned. “Ethics again. And
when you get all through with ethics,
what’ve you got? Fifty bucks a week."

  “More than that sometimes,” said
Perry. “Show him, Ann.”

  Ann Sherwood went over to the bed.
“I came down to say goodby, Spudsy.
I’m flying back to New York tomor-
row. So is Perry. The Planet has of-
fered him a better job. You see, we
split. I wrote the story for both papers
and Perry gave the pictures to both.
It worked out fine. But Perry thought
of you. Here."

  •	She handed him a newspaper.
Spudsy opened it, saw it was the
Clarion, the most blatant tabloid in the

entire Fourth Estate. And the Clarion,
believe it or not, had flood pictures!
Six of them and all darn good! Spudsy
stared. “Duke,” he whispered, “you—”

  “I told your managing editor you’d
been hurt and you’d sent those shots
up with me. He was pleased to get
them. He’s going to give you a
bonus . .

  Spudsy was flabbergasted. After a
while, he said: “All right, Perry. So
I’ve been a heel. Just the same, you
were a sap to hand my rag pictures
like these—"

  “Uh-uh,” Ann cautioned, smiling at
him.

  “Aw nuts,” Spudsy said. “All
right." He braced himself as if he were
about to undergo a thing of great pain.
He closed his eyes, clenched his fists,
gritted his teeth.

  “How,” he asked plaintively, “does
a guy go about getting ethical?"

Pigeon Eggs From Oysters

TN THE early Sixteenth Century when Cortez, in a home-made galleon,
anchored in the Gulf of Lower California, the inhabitants of those hot,
desolate shores were pearl divers. It was, in fact, some of their pearls that gave
impetus to the exploration of the California coast. It is quite probable that
those pearls—“big as pigeon eggs"—found in the Indian tomb opened at
Monte Alban in 1931 were taken from the same waters, and were like those
that Cortez took with him when he sailed back to Mexico.

  Today, descendants of those divers who fled at the approach of Cortez are
still carrying on at the same old stand and in the same old way. Most of them
are “skin” divers, descending to the lair of the wily oyster unprotected by a
diving suit, armed only with a knife. Some fall prey to the man-eating sharks
that roam those waters and others succumb to paralysis. But, offsetting these
risks, is the possibility of sudden wealth, for no diver knows what nacreous
plum may lie cancerous within the viscera of the next oyster.

Strike

By JOHN HAWKINS

TROUBLE is brewing in the big Falcon
motor car plant at Industrial City.
The Falcon Company turns out the finest
car in America—and Falcon himself is as
solid and honest as the machine that has
been his life’s work. Until the depression,
Falcon’s workers were the most contented
and decently treated in the whole industry.
But an efficiency expert was brought to
the plant when the dollars started pinch-
ing. An iron-willed martinet, J. D. Vick
instituted the speed-up, cut salaries, drove
the men at top speed and fired them when
they fell behind. With the bad feeling
growing among the men, labor-racketeers
saw their chance.

  They formed a crooked union, talked
the malcontents into joining and, one way
or another, dragged the rest of the men
into line until they could boast a hundred
percent membership. Now the union con-
trols the plant. As some of the older,
wiser workers realize, a crooked union,
from the outside, looks much the same
as an honest one; and even if Falcon
should one day realize the sort of organi-
zation that is burning the heart out of his

plant, he’d be pretty helpless to combat it.

  Any move he made to disband the union
and encourage the formation of an honest
one would result in the leaders calling a
strike. Their control of the plant is un-
challenged. . . .

   (HIS is the situation when Duncan
McCann arrives in Industrial City to
seek employment at the Falcon works. And
there’s a story behind that, too. A story
of misunderstanding between father and
son ... a story of two prides in conflict.

  Involved in a hit-and-run smash-up that
threatens to become a front-page sensa-
tion, Duncan McCann had come to the
long-threatened parting of the ways with
his father. For to James McCann, the Gov-
ernor of the State, his son was a no-good
wastrel who was constantly compromising
the integrity of the McCann name and po-
sition. And to young Duncan, his father
was a stiff-necked tyrant who refused to

understand Duncan’s ambition to become
a mechanical engineer, and who offered
him a mausoleum instead of a home to live
in. He was glad when the break finally
came.

  So Duncan McCann changed his name
to John Duncan and started out for In-
dustrial City.

ON THE way he encounters two girls,
both of them destined to play a part
in his new and suddenly altered existence.
The first is Marcia Dubois, who seems to
know a good deal about strikes and who,
after begging Duncan not to try to get
work at the Falcon plant, tricks him into
missing the bus both of them are riding on.

  The other is a pert-nosed, smartly
dressed young woman who gives Duncan a
lift, who lectures him about capital and
labor and the new freedom, and whose en-
thusiasm for the cause she preaches is
matched only by her misconception of the
whole situation. Dropping Duncan at the
gates of the plant she promises to put him
in touch with people who will enlighten his
ignorance. She tells him her name. It is
Helen Falcon.

  Duncan manages to get work as a day
laborer in the plant, and almost immedi-
ately encounters the tyranny of the union
organizers. An Irishman named O’Malley,
with a red-headed temper to match his fiery
hair, refuses to join the union. He has
worked in plants all over the country, and
he knows an honest union when he sees
one. He also can recognize, on sight, a
bunch of racketeers and extortionists dis-
guised as union bosses. John Robb, the
union leader, gives O’Malley three hours
to think it over.

  Late in the afternoon, there is a sudden
outcry of “Accident!” And Duncan is told
that O’Malley has been killed—six inches
of hand-drill steel have gone into his
stomach.

  When Robb approaches Duncan, only
Mack Saddler, Duncan’s new-found friend,
can keep him from flying at Robb’s throat.

  “O’Malley called you a rat,” Duncan
blazes out. “But that isn’t strong enough
for you! Murderer is what you are, and I’ll

see you swing before I put my name on
your list!”

   Robb only smiles a little. “Better be
careful, sonny. You might get what O’Mal-
ley got. . .

CHAPTER V

MIKE FINN

McCANN’S lean body jerked
taut. Anger beat in his
temples, grew', until Robb’s
broad face was the only thing left in
the world. Until his shoulders ached
with the desire to drive his fist full into
those grinning lips. He leaned forward,
his hands jerking up, and said flatly:
“Try it, guy, and you’ll be starting a
union on the under side of a tomb-
stone. You want to be sure you don't
miss, not any, or—”

  Steel fingers dug into McCann's
shoulder, and Mack Saddler’s even
voice pierced his rage. “Steady, lad,
you’ll accomplish nothing this way.
The job-setter’ll have you drawing
your check if he sees you.”

  “Thanks.” McCann jerked away,
finished ramming the body bolts into
place. He stepped back, and Saddler
squeezed past him into the car.

  McCann shot a glance at Robb as
they bent over the chassis that was
moving into position under the body
drop. The squat man’s face was dark,
but the leering smile clung to his lips
as though frozen there. Ugly lights
showd in his muddy eyes as they
flicked over McCann’s face. Then he
w'as staring up.

   The electric crane crawled into posi-
tion over the square hole in the floor
above. A sedan body swayed below the
crane. Robb waved it down. The hoist
man dropped it, smoothly, until it
swung only an inch or so above the
four guide punches set in each corner
of the chassis.
90

ARGOSY

  The rest was simple. McCann had
already done it many times in his short
day on the assembly line. He and Robb
swung the body gently until the corner
holes in the floor of the body were
exactly above the four punches. Robb
would signal then, and the crane man
would drop the body that remaining
foot. The punches would guide it into
place, assured perfect matching of the
bolt holes drilled in the body and
chassis.

  They did that now. McCann’s gloved
hands were flat against the side of the
car, holding it steady, when Robb
yelled:

  “Hey! Fix that punch!”

  McCann’s eyes jerked around, saw
Robb’s pointing hand, saw that the
front punch on his side of the car was
leaning at a sharp angle. He dropped
to one knee, and jerked the punch
squarely upright. At that precise second
the body came down!

  A flicker of unexpected movement
was McCann’s only warning. He
dropped suddenly, whipped his hand
away from the punch. Something
brushed his fingertips, and steel jarred
against steel. Then McCann was star-
ing at his bare hand—at his glove
which was pinned between the body
and chassis. If he’d been a fraction of
a second slower, his fingers would have
been sheared off as cleanly as though a
giant ax had sliced through them.

  He was on his knees when feet
scuffed the floor beside him, and
Robb’s harsh voice asked, “You hurt,
Jack? I thought—”

  McCann tipped his head up. “No.
You weren’t fast enough. I had time
to—” His voice trailed away as the
sharp-faced foreman elbowed close to
shout:

  “What’s wrong? Why ain’t you
guys on your job?”

  “Duncan got his glove caught when
the body come down,” Robb explained.
“I was afraid he lost a couple of fin-
gers.” His hand came up. “He’s new
here so I was doin’ the signalin’, but
the crane guy can’t see me so good an'
he let her down.”

  The foreman nodded at McCann.
“You do th’ signalin’ from now on,
an’ watch what you’re doin’. We had
enough accidents around here for one
day.”

  McCann choked down angry words.
Robb slapped his shoulder and said,
“He’ll be all right soon’s he get's wise.”
Then the squat man spun, crossed the
assembly line, and seconds later was
leaning inside the car dropping bolts
in place.

qpHE foreman left, and McCann
went back to work. What had hap-
pened had been no accident. Robb had
deliberately intended to catch his hand,
he was sure of that, but Robb had cov-
ered himself neatly, and there was no
proof. McCann’s brow furrowed. He
couldn’t prove it was anything but an
accident. The thing had happened too
fast. Robb’s dropping hand had been
all that was necessary. Just a gesture,
easily mistaken, easily denied.

  Nor could he prove that the drill
that had torn O’Malley’s insides to
jelly had not slipped by accident. He
knew it, every man in the plant knew
it, and yet ... It was murder—perfect
murder—occurring in the sight of a
hundred men.

   McCann’s teeth vised, little ridges of
muscle stood out along the clean line
of his jaw. Something had to be done!
But what—and how?

  The remaining hours of the after-
noon brought no answer. When the
line stopped. Robb waited only long
enough to say, “That was close, guy,
STRIKE

91

  you want to watch your mitts/’ before
 he swung away toward the ramp.

   Mack Saddler’s eyes were thought-
ful, his voice low. “You shouldn’t have
done that, lad; he’s a bad enemy, that
one. He’s tricky and smooth, and dead-
ly. You’d best change your mind about
joining the union. It’s the safest thing
to do.”

   McCann swore, and his eyes found
Saddler’s face. “I ought to—”

   "It can wait, lad,” Kim Saddler’s
lips were close to McCann’s ear. “Wait
till we’re away from the plant before
you talk.”

  McCann shrugged, lapsed into
silence. Nor did the brothers speak
until they were outside the plant gate.
Then it was Kim Saddler who asked,
“Where’re you living, lad?”

   “Place called the Arlington Hotel.”
 Kim nodded. “You can ride with us,
 we go past there. Our car’s in the park-
 ing lot down the street.”

   McCann hesitated, and then fell in
step with the brothers. He was bone-
tired. Every muscle of his legs ached
in separate protest at each step. His
shoulders throbbed, and the palms of
his hands were raw and blistered. All
the springiness had gone out of his
stride.

   They had covered a full block when
the sight of a white hat in a parked car
brought McCann’s head up. There was
something about that pert turban,
something about the half-glimpsed pro-
file and dark hair that struck a familiar
chord. His lips thinned as they drew
abreast of the big sedan. The girl in it
was Marcia Dubois.

   She was alone in the car, and she
didn’t see McCann approach. She
didn’t move till he put one hand on
the door, and said, “Hello, Miss Du-
bois.”

  She looked up then, her eyes widen-

 ing in surprise. Faint color darkened
 her cheeks. Her lips moved, but no
 sound came from them.

   McCann’s voice was cold. “You’re
still very beautiful. Beautiful enough to
get away with murder. This car’s
pretty flashy for a giri who has to ride
around the country is busses. Did you
send the owner after cigarettes, too?”
She said, “Please—”

   “Tell me,” he went on, “what it was
that I did or said? Why did you make
me miss that bus? Why did you want
me stranded in the mountains over-
night ?”

   “I’m sorry I did that.” She tried to
smile but didn’t quite succeed. “I had a
reason, of course, but now it doesn’t
seem like a very good one. I can’t tell
you what it was, and I’d rather you
didn’t ask, but”—she fumbled in her
purse—“you must let me pay for your
bus ticket.”

   McCann shook his head. “A service
station attendant got me a ride in. It
didn’t cost me anything but my time.
I was lucky.”

   “You—” She looked up at him, and
then pulled her eyes away. “You’re
working at the Falcon Plant ?”

   “Yes.”

   She didn’t speak right away, and in
the moment of silence McCann studied
the side of her face. He could see only
the long, drooping lashes, the curve of
her cheek, and the corner of her mouth.

  She spoke rapidly then, without
looking up. Spoke in a low, murmur-
ing voice that McCann had to strain to
hear. “I will tell you this much. I tried
to warn you, I really did. Don’t work
in the Falcon Plant. Quit! You can get
a job somewhere else, and even if you
couldn't it would be—” She stopped
then, her slim hands lax in her lap.
“Maybe we’d better forget the whole
thing. Just act as if I hadn’t said any-
92

ARGOSY

thing.” She looked up, and the bright-
ness had gone out of her eyes. Her
voice was cool, distant. “It’s been nice
seeing you. Perhaps I’ll run into you
again. Goodbye.”

  “But why—”

  “Goodbye.”

TTE WAS still standing on the walk
when the big man brushed past
him to open the car door. He said,
“You drive, Marcia,” and dropped into
the seat as the girl slipped under the
wrheel.

  McCann eyed him narrowly. He was
big, w^ith a hard, sure bigness that ex-
tended to his long-fingered hands, to
his massive, well-shaped head. His
clothes were expensive, but in perfect
taste. His close-cropped hair was red,
and when he turned, McCann could see
the tiny, crescent-shaped scar across
the bridge of his nose.

  He grinned up at McCann as Marcia
jockeyed the car away from the curb.
“Hey, Jack, all done for today?”
“Yes,” McCann said shortly.
“Nothing left now but a hot dinner
and a bath, huh ?” The big man's voice
was pleasant and deep. There was
laughter in his eyes. Laughter and
something else . . . something very like
the glitter of gun steel under light.

  The big sedan was gone then, slip-
ping smoothly out into the traffic
stream. McCann wheeled, continued
down the block. Kim Saddler hailed
him, and he saw the small sedan
double-parked only a few feet away.

  “Friends of yours?” Kim inquired
as McCann climbed into the car.

  McCann said, “No,” and then real-
ized that both brothers were watching
him. He saw that there was an odd,
strained look around their mouths.

  “You’re sure?” It was Kim’s bitter
drawd.

  “Of course. I've seen the woman be-
fore. I met her on the bus a week ago,
but she’s not what you’d call a friend
of mine.” He told them what had hap-
pened.

  A questioning look passed between
the brothers, and then Mack asked soft-
ly, “You wouldn’t know who her
friend w^as? The big red-headed man?”

  “No, I wouldn’t.” McCann’s temper
flared. “And while this third degree is
going on, you might tell me just
what—”

  Kim’s mouth pulled down, but
Mack’s voice carried the same easy
tone. “Gently, lad, gently. If you didn’t
know who you were talking to, there’s
nothing to get worked up about. Does
the name Mike Finn mean anything to
you ?”

  “No”

   Saddler started the car, swung it out
into the traffic. “It will, lad. Mike Finn
is the union boss. He is the union. He
holds it together with his two big hands
and without him there’d be no union—
at least no crooked union. Now do you
see why we wondered ?”

  “Of course.” McCann leaned for-
ward.

  “The woman is his secretary.”

  McCann fell silent. Marcia Dubois
the union boss’ secretary. For a mo-
ment thought held him silent.

  He looked up then to find Kim
watching him. Deep lines framed the
tall man’s mouth. “You’ve had a plenty
busy day, little man,” he said writh a
wry grin. “Robb’s a bad man to have
for an enemy. You’ve declared yourself
on the wrong side of the fence. You
can’t do anything alone. I’d hate—”
His eyes became bleak. “I’d hate to see
you go out of the plant on a stretcher.
And you will, lad, there are too many
ways they can get you. Not right away,
they won’t try anything so soon after
STRIKE

93

the last—accident.” He spat the last
word out as though it had a bitter taste.
“But sooner or later you’ll get it—just
like O’Malley.”

  “What good would it do if I joined
the union?”

  Kim Saddler looked away. “None
maybe. This union ain’t the big national
kind. Not by a long pull. There isn’t
one man in ten who joined because he
wanted to join, but every man in the
plant would jump at the chance to join
an honest union,”

  “Then—?”

  “Most of us joined because we had
to. And because we knew we could do
more good on the inside than on the
out. There might be a chance to blast
Finn’s machine w'ide open. There might
be a chance to get an honest union
here—”

  “Kim,” Mack Saddler cut in, “you
talk too much. Let the lad alone.”

  Kim shrugged. “You’ve got the pic-
ture anyway,” he told McCann, “and
the rest of it is up to you.”

  “Right.” McCann’s voice was even.
“I think I might take your advice. But
even if I don’t, Saddler, I didn’t hear

a word vou said.”
t/

  A slow grin pulled at Kim’s mouth.
Mack turned to say, “Thanks, lad,” as
he pulled up in front of McCann’s
hotel. He was smiling too.

CHAPTER VI

COUNTERWEIGHT

DUNCAN McCANN spent many
hours in thought before he slept
that night. Kim’s words had been rea-
sonable. After all, there wasn’t any
sense getting himself killed off. And
maybe he could do something from the
inside. He found that he wanted very
much to help the men at the plant, with
a kind of stubborn, angry idealism that

surprised him. Good old McCann blood
coming out in him, he guessed wearily.
It would be a tough fight.

  He knew, too, what the penalty for
failure would be. He could still hear
O’Malley’s scream as six inches of drill
steel ripped through his insides. And
O’Malley had only refused to join the
union. They had murdered him quickly,
efficiently. What would they do to a
man who tried to wreck the union? A
new grimness framed McCann’s mouth
as he stared into the darkness. Once
discovered, he’d be taken care of—
plenty! There’d be another messy job
for the first-aid crew.

  “That,” McCann told himself,
“would fill even the governor’s specifi-
cations for making points the hard
way.”

   He grinned then, realizing that, as a
union member, he would have a chance
to see Marcia Dubois again. He was
still wondering how much that knowl-
edge had affected his decision when he
fell asleep.

  The next morning he tucked one of
his remaining ten dollar bills into his
watch pocket before he left for the
plant. He found Robb already at his
station under the body drop.

  “Here,” McCann dropped the folded
bill into Robb’s hand. “I’ve changed
my mind. As long as the plant’s a hun-
dred per cent union I’d better join.”

  The squat man’s muddy eyes showed
no surprise. He merely said, “Okay,
guy, I’ll write you a receipt at noon.”

  The work seemed easier that morn-
ing, after the stiffness worked out of
McCann’s back. The line was still run-
ning forty-five cars an hour, but Mc-
Cann had caught the swing of his job
and was able to maintain the swift
pace. He even found time to watch
Kim Saddler. The tall man worked
with effortless speed, his big hands
94

ARGOSY

never wasting a motion. He put the
strip of insulation, upon which the
body rested, in place around the chassis
and shellacked it there.

  The morning was two hours old
when the foreman touched McCann’s
shoulder, said, “This guy’ll relieve
you.”

  McCann stepped back wonderingly
as another man took his place. The
foreman said, “You’re wanted in the
office,” and led the way across the
floor.

  They went down a single flight of
stairs, past a row of lettered doors, and
stopped in front of one bearing the
words, /. D. Vick, Efficiency.

  “In there,” the foreman said, “he’s
waiting for you.”

  McCann asked, “But what—?”

  The sharp-faced foreman said, “Ask
him,” pivoted, and stalked away.

McCANN went through the door
into a windowless, white walled
office. A pale, shirt-sleeved young man
danced up from a small desk. “What’s
year's?"

  “I understood that I was wanted
down here—”

 “Name?”

  “Duncan. John Duncan.”

  The youth consulted a sheet of paper
on his desk, looked up, said, “Go on in.
He’s waiting.”

 J. D. Vick didn’t move when
McCann came through the door. He
was small, an egg-bald little man with
jumpy eyes and thin, bloodless lips. He
nodded toward a straight-backed chair,
and built a neat temple of his fingers
while he watched McCann sit down.

  “I sent for you,” his voice wras sur-
prisingly deep, “after I’d seen your
card. According to this you’ve a col-
lege degree in mechanical engineering.
Is that right?”

  McCann said, “Yes.”

  Vick consulted the card in front of
him. “There are always opportunities
for men with a technical education in
the Falcon Plant. We want trained
men, and we make every effort to give
them all possible opportunity for ad-
vancement.”

  McCann waited.

  “You understand, of course, that it
is impossible to offer every technical
graduate a position in our drafting
room. But there are other ways, other
jobs that offer a substantial salary as
well as a chance to show loyalty to the
company.” He inspected his finger-tips.
“Needless to say, the men who do
prove their loyalty are first in line for
the Openings in the laboratory or
draughting room.”

  “Go on, please.” McCann said.

  Vick cleared his throat and leaned
forward. “You may or may not know
that most of the workmen in this plant
are members of a newly formed union.
This union is working against our in-
terests, and against the interests of the
men themselves. We already pay the
highest wages in,the industry, and have
the best working conditions. This union
is simply breeding discontent.

  “Mr. Falcon,” Vick went on, “has
always had' the welfare of his em-
ployees at heart, and now he fears that
they are in the grip of an unscrupulous
group of racketeers. He wants to cor-
rect that condition.’’

  A quizzical light grew in McCann’s
eyes. “Yes?”

  “This position I mentioned is along
that line. You will, of course, have to
continue to work at your present job,
and you will have to join the union.
And then—then you will attend all the
meetings, and whatever other gather-
ings the workmen may have. You will
keep an accurate record of all labor
STRIKE

95

activities and report to me. For this
small service, you will receive double
your present wage.”

  “Wait a minute,” McCann inter-
rupted. “Are you trying to hire me for
a labor spy?”

  Vick swallowed, wet his lips. “If you
insist upon using the baldest interpreta-
tion, you might call it that.”

  McCann was silent for a moment.
This meant there would be other spies
—twenty or thirty of them—scattered
throughout the plant. One more
couldn’t make any difference, and—
A thought ticked through his head. It
would be safer, faster to work alone.

  “I’m sure, if you consider it fully,”
Vick’s deep voice broke the silence,
“that you will—”

  “Sorry,” McCann shook his head.
“Sorry, but I can’t agree with you. A
labor spy is my idea of something
pretty low. It’s a job I wouldn’t want
—at any price.”

  Vick’s bloodless lips pressed into a
thin line. “You’re sure you won’t re-
consider?”

  “Positive.”

  “I regret that; indeed I regret it
verv much. I was sare that a person of
your ability and training would see his
way celar to—” His voice died then,
and he bent again to inspect the card in
front of him. “I should, I suppose, dis-
charge you, but I imagine that the em-
ployees already suspect that there are
ah—informers among them. So—” He
tipped his head back. “I will have to
transfer you to another department.”
He scribbled something on a small
card, passed it across the desk. “Take
this to Douglass. You’ll find him on the
second floor.”

  McCann tucked the card into his shirt
pocket, and stood up. He was nearly
to the door when Vick spoke again.

  “If you should—ah—change your

mind, you can notify me at any time.
The offer will hold good for the bal-
ance of the week.”

  “Okay, but don’t expect it.” McCann
went out and up the stairs to the sec-
ond floor. One of the workmen pointed
Douglas out, a grav-haired, long-faced
man who glanced at the card McCann
handed him and said, “Hmmm. Well,

I	can always use a good man up here.”
His dark eyes probed McCann’s face.
“Heat bother you?”

  “I don’t know, I’ve never worked
where it was very hot.”

  A small grin pulled at Douglas’s lips.
“You will from now on.”

TIE LED the way down a narrow
■*- -*• aisle through a large double door
into a room that was heavy with the
smell of fresh paint. It was hot here,
too, with a damp, cloying heat that
started the sweat springing from every
pore on McCann’s body.

  Douglas stopped beside a tank that
reared to shoulder height above the
floor. “You’ll work here.” He jerked
a thumb at a man who stood on a wide
metal bench halfway up the side of the
tank. “He’ll show you what to do.”
Douglass left, and the workmen ges-
tured at a locker against the wall, said,
“Get an apron.”

  McCann obeyed, and then came back
to watch. A hooded oven—like a tunnel
about six feet wide and eight feet high
—ran the length of the room, and then
curved along the wall. There was an
opening in the oven beside the metal
bench, and the workman was dipping
bundles of parts into the tank of paint,
and hanging them on hooks suspended
at intervals below an endless chain in-
side the oven.

  McCann climbed up on the bench.
The hot breath of the oven licked out
to meet him, heavy with paint fumes.

  The workman grinned. “You can
quit worrying, guy, it can’t get any
worse than this. You got the worst job
in the whole plant right now.”

  McCann worked a smile on his lips.
“Okay. What’s first?”

  The workman showed him. Showed
him how to slosh a fifty-pound bundle
of fender braces back and forth in the
tank. How to wait until the endless
chain brought the hook into position,
and how to heave that dripping bundle
up over the tank edge. Finally how to
get it at arm’s length and hold it there,
while his feet slipped on the paint
splashed bench, until the moving hook
yanked the load out of his hands.

  McCann worked in grim silence. A
half dozen times that morning he was
ready to quit, and a half dozen times
the memory of his father’s bitter voice
held him there. “You’ve never had the
guts to stick to any job!”

  His gloves were slippery and paint-
sodden by the end of the first ten min-
utes. He tried working without them,
and burned his hands on the hot metal
of the endless chain. The paint dripped
off the apron, soaked through his
trouser legs, got into his shoes.

  And the heat . . . The fumes that
swept out of that oven door were like
Hell’s own breath. Sweat trickled off
the point of his chin, ran into his eyes.

  He was an hour cleaning up that
night before he left the plant. Later, at
the hotel, he pushed away from the
table, and left his dinner almost un-
touched. He was asleep almost before
he could push his aching legs flat
against the sheet.

  The next day was a continuation of
the same, frenzied inferno. Always, the
grinning giant who shared the bench
with him held to the same killing pace.
Up. Down. Up. Down. The heat seemed
to increase with each passing hour.

Quitting time found McCann barely
able to climb down off the bench. That
night he didn’t even try to eat.

  Two other days McCann spent on
that bench before he looked down to
find Douglas standing beside him. The
gray-haired man was smiling. “The as-
sembly line can’t get along without
you. McCann. You’re to report back
there for your old job in the morning.”
The paint-smeared giant laughed
after Douglas had gone. “I was think-
in’ you’d make a good pardner one of
these days. These other guys never
last.”

  “Mister,” McCann said heartily, “I
can understand that.”

T> OBB’S muddy eyes narrowed for
just a second when McCann
stopped at the body drop the next
morning. “What are you doin’ here?”
he demanded.

  “I was transferred back here,” Mc-
Cann replied.

  “Stool pigeon, huh?”

  McCann’s lips flattened. His hands
came up, doubled. He had taken two
steps toward the squat man when a
hand touched his arm, and an easy
voice asked, “Where’ve you been, lad ?”
McCann spun to find the Saddler
brothers standing behind him. “Paint
shop,” he said tersely.

  Kim’s eyes hardened, and his voice
was raw. “Paint shop, huh? It’s funny,
but they only transfer one kind of guy
out of the paint shop.”

  “You’re wrong,” Mack Saddler cut
in. “The lad’s no spy.”

  “Maybe not,” Kim drawled, “but it’ll
take a lot to convince the other men.”
Mack Saddler drew McCann aside.
‘There’s a meeting tonight, lad. How’d
you like to go down there with us ? You
could come out to the house for supper
and we’ll all ride together.”

6 A—24.
STRIKE

  “This won’t get you in bad?”

  Mack shook his head. “It couldn’t,
not any more than we already are.”

  “Thanks. I’ll be glad to come.”

  Work under the body drop seemed
easy after the blistering blasts of the
paint shop. Not once during the morn-
ing hours did Robb speak to him, and
not once was it necessary for McCann
to leave his task unfinished.

  At noon he ate with the Saddler
brothers at the long table against the
wall. He had finished before he realized
that they were alone at the big table—
though every other table in the room
was crowded. Coventry . . .

  Kim saw his puzzled look. “One
thing about eating with you,” he
drawled, “it’s a cinch to get elbow
room.”

  Mack said, “Lay off, Kim, it isn’t
his fault they think he’s a spy.”

  “No, and it wasn’t O’Malley’s fault
he didn’t like the union.” Kim’s voice
was loud, raw. “But he couldn’t be any
deader!”

  The voices at the tables around them
died abruptly. There was only a shuf-
fling, rustling murmur as the men
twisted to face them. The silence thick-
ened, grew, spreading like a wave
across the room. It held, thick and taut,
until Robb’s bull voice rang out.

  “We gotta clean these damn spotters
out. We gotta be sure there’s no stool
pigeons sittin’ in on the meetings.”

  Mack’s husky whisper brought Mc-
Cann’s head around. The tall man’s
face was suddenly, strangely old.

  “Kim,” he said, “Kim, you—you
fool!”

  Kim’s mouth was a hard line. He
made a disdainful noise with his flat
lips—a little explosion of disgust and
stiff-necked defiance.

  McCann had a chance to speak to
Mack as they filed past the time clock.

 7 A—24

“Maybe we’d better call the dinner off.
I’ve caused you enough trouble—”

  “Afraid?” the tall man asked.

   “It isn’t that, but—”

  “Then we won’t change it.”

  Low-voiced comment followed them
across the floor to the body drop.
Heads averted quickly as they ap-
proached, and tight voices buzzed in
their wake. Saddler’s expression never
changed.

  McCann watched Robb narrowly all
afternoon, but the squat man was un-
usually good-humored. Once or twice
he grinned thickly at McCann, but he
didn’t speak.

  Quitting time found McCann still
puzzled, still wondering. The thunder-
ous clamor of the line had died away,
and he was racking his tools when
Kim’s harsh, “Duck, lad!” burst in his
ears.

  McCann crouched then, threw up his
arms. An end-wrench clanged viciously
against the post beside him, spun away.
McCann whirled. Fifty pairs of eves
met his stare. There were a hundred
men within easy throwing distance, and
any one of them might have hurled the
wrench.

  McCann turned to Kim. “Did vou

see—
it

   Not a thing, lad, forget it.”

TV/TARK and Kim Saddler waited
outside McCann’s hotel while he
shaved and got into a dark suit. Kim
looked at him sharply when he got into
the car, but didn’t speak. During the
rest of the ride Kim was slouched far
down on the seat, his chin on his chest,
staring moodily in front of him.

  Once McCann tried to start a con-
versation, but drew only monosyllabic
answers. Kim didn’t speak until after
Mack had stopped in front of a low,
frame house.
98

ARGOSY

  “Listen, Duncan, you say you’re not
a spy. That’s okay with us, we believe
you.” He laughed harshly. “Maybe
we’re suckers but that’s the way we’re
made. Anyway even a spy wouldn’t be
dumb enough to do what you’re do-
ing.”

  McCann only stared.

  “Don’t go into the hall in those
clothes. That suit is tailor made and it
cost two hundred if it cost a dime.
Same with the overcoat. One look at
those duds and you’ll never be able to
make the other guys believe you aren’t
on two payrolls!”

  Mack said, “I’ll lend him a jacket,
and he can leave his clothes in the car.”
He raced the motor. “We’ll be back for
you at a quarter to eight, Kim.”

  Mrs. Mack Saddler was a full-
checked, smiling woman who made
McCann feel at home from the moment
she met them at the door.

  “You’ll be John Duncan,” she
greeted him. “And wouldn’t you think,
after all these years, a husband would
know enough to warn the cook when
he was bringing company for supper?”
Then she was taking his hat and coat
while Mack laughed. “That’s a woman.
Even a week’s notice isn’t enough.
She’s been plannin’ on this, mind you,
for two days, and if you don’t praise
her pie, she’ll hate you forever.”

  It was a friendly house. More than
that, it was a warm, wholesome home
that had known much living. The rugs
and furniture were old and worn, but
spotless. A well filled bookcase stood
against one wall of the living room,
and there was a stack of magazines on
the center table that had seen much
reading.

  They ate in a white-walled kitchen,
off shining oilcloth. Mrs. Saddler kept
his coffee cup full, and tried twice to
make him eat a third slice of apple pie.

Mack Saddler stuffed his pipe, and
smoked thoughtfully for some minutes
before he said, "We’d best be moving,
lad.” He turned to his wife. “If you’ll
hunt up that old leather jacket of mine,
Ann.”

  She hesitated for just a moment be-
fore she left the table, and McCann
could have sworn that it was fear that
looked out of her eyes, clouded her
voice.

  “You — you’ll be home earlv,
Mack?”

  “Right after the meeting.”

  She brought the jacket, and accom-
panied them to the door. “We’ll be
seeing a lot of you,” she told McCann.
“I know Mack will w'ant you to come
back often.”

  Five minutes later Mack ran the car
into the driveway beside his brother
Kim’s house and sounded the horn. He
was bending forward to shut off the
motor when a slender figure slipped
away from the deep shadow of the
garage and ran to the side of the car.

  “Mack! Mack. . . .” It was a
woman’s rushing, breathless voice.
“He’s—he’s drinking again, and he’s
fretting about the union. I’ve tried to
persuade him to stay home, but he
won’t listen.”

  She was leaning against the car door
then, her hand on Mack’s arm. The
glow of the dashlight showed her finely
cut features—her twitching mouth, her
frantic eyes.

  “Don’t worry, Elsie,” Mack said
evenly, '“we’ll take care of him.”

  “But he might lose his temper, Mack,
he might. He’s so upset. He might do
anything. I couldn’t stand it if he
should be . . .” Her voice dropped.
“He’s all I have, Mack. He might for-
get me and the kids for a minute, but
he’d be sorry when it was too late. It’s
his temper, Mack, you’ll have to watch
STRIKE

him.” She made a little moaning cry.
Her hand leaped to cover her mouth.
“What would we do if they killed
him!”

   “Steady, Elsie, you’re being foolish
now. Nothing’s going to happen to
Kim.” Mack patted her shoulder clum-
sily. “We’ll take care of him. He'll be
home in a couple of hours.”

   “You’re—you’re sure?”

   “I promise.”

   The woman raised her head, her im-
ploring eyes clung to McCann’s face.
"You? Will you help watch him?”

   “Of course.”

   There was a step on the concrete be-
hind them, and the woman whirled,
melted back into the darkness. The
grinding whir of the starter drowned
the sound of her footsteps. Kim Sad-
dler heaved himself into the back seat,
said, “Let’s go.” His lean face was
dark, and a somber bitterness smol-
dered in his eyes.

   Mack backed the car out into the
street.

CHAPTER VII

STRIKE MEETING

UNION headquarters occupied a
ramshackle building on the edge
of the factory district. The auditorium
had once been a theater, and the floor
sloped sharply to the flag-draped stage.
A wide balcony ran around three walls
of the big room.

   The hall was already crowded when
Mack led the way to a bench against
the back wall under the balcony. Tight
groups gathered in a dozen places on
the floor. Harsh voices blurred, over-
lapped, beat ceaselessly at their ears.
Trailing plumes of tobacco smoke
drifted under the hot lights.

   Every seat in the hall was filled long
before the meeting was called to order.

A thin, dark man in a rumpled suit
acted as presiding officer. Mack whis-
pered a terse explanation, “He’s the
president, the men elected him. Finn’s
the acting secretary.”

   McCann’s restless eyes searched the
room for the big, red-headed man. He
wasn’t among those on the platform,
nor was he anywhere in the crowd.

   A reedy-voiced secretary read a list
of names of new members. McCann’s
name was among them. Someone from
the floor made a motion that flowers
be sent to three sick members, and it
was passed by a hearty chorus of ayes.

   An uneasy tension gripped the hall
then. The sharp clatter of voices in-
terrupted the president’s toneless drone,
and the speaker who followed him got
even less attention.

   “He’s here !”

  The voice came from high in the
balcony, and was instantly taken up by
a hundred other throats. A splatter of
applause ran through the crowd as
Mike Finn led a tight group of men
through the side door. A smiling giant,
his red head towered above those
around him.

   He paused in the center of the room,
held up his hand for quiet. His rich,
deep voice reached every corner.

   “There’s news for you tonight, men,
good news.”

   Someone cheered, and the thunder-
ous pound of stamping feet rose above
the calls of, “Speech! Speech!”

   Finn’s white teeth shone in laughter.
“Save the cheers,” he shouted. “Time
enough for that later.” He swung,
stalked down the aisle to the platform.
The group that had come with him
broke up, scattered among the crowd.
Two of them found seats on the
benches just ahead of McCann. One of
them was slim and small, no bigger
than a boy. His full-cheeked face was
100

ARGOSY

smooth except for the two deep, harsh
lines that fjracketed his mouth. A
bottle-neck protruded from his coat
pocket, and when he spoke to the man
beside him his speech was thick,
blurred.

  The other was almost as big as Finn
himself. His high cheek-boned face
was flat, scarred, and his brows were
only pale glints above lidded eyes.

  Mike Finn had crossed the stage,
turned to face the crowd. Kim Saddler
leaned close to McCann as waves of
sound swept over the floor. “They
work for Finn,” he whispered. “The
big guy is Montana Fells. He’s Finn’s
bodyguard and number-one gunman.
The other one’s Ryan.”

  McCann nodded, and turned his eyes
toward the platform. Finn had begun
to speak, and the crowd grew still. 4
“Six months ago,” he said, “I talked
to forty or fifty of you from this plat-
form. I promised you certain things if
you would help me form an organiza-
tion. You did that, and tonight I can
tell you that the things I promised are
within reach.

  “I promised you higher wages. I
promised you better working condi-
tions. I promised you a share in the
profits, and a closed shop.”

  Finn paused then, allowing the ex-
pectant tension to build up before he
went on. “And tonight I can tell you
that those things are within our
reach!”

  A salvo of cheers rocked the hall.

  “We can get those things,” Finn
roared, “and we will! Why should the
general manager of the Falcon Plants
draw a hundred and fifty thousand dol-
lars a year in salary alone? Why should
he receive a bonus of seventy-five thou-
sand dollars?”

  A bull voice from the balcony roared,
“Yah! An’ he wouldn’t know an end-

wrench from a paint brush!” Laughter
and cheers swept over fhe floor. The
rumble of stamping feet choked the
room with sound.

'T' HE short man in front of McCann

was tugging at the flask in his'

pocket. “I knew it,” McCann heard
him say, “I knew that’d put ’em in the

aisles.”

  The big man twisted his head,
growled, “Shut up, Ryan.”

  “No man can earn that much,” Finn
was speaking again. “That money'
should go to the workmen who build" ,
the Falcon cars.” The silence came
b&ck to the big room. “And the union
is in a position to demand that the
profits be split up among the workmen.
Our membership in the Falcon Plant is
a hundred per cent. They have to listen
to us now, or we'll shut their plant up
tighter than a drum. If they don’t meet
our terms they can’t turn a wheel.

  “Here’s the program. Tomorrow
morning Falcon will get a list of our
demands. Union recognition, a boost
in wages, shorter hours. If he doesn’t
meet those demands we’ll close his
plant. We want union recognition, and
we’ll get it! Your jobs will be safe
then. They won’t be able to fire any
man without—”

  A low-voiced murmur ran through
the crowd. “Strike!” A half hundred
voices caught the word, repeated it
until it echoed from every corner of
the room. “Strike!” The muttering
died, but the air was electric.

  “Wait!” Finn’s head was thrown
back, his hands held up for silence.
“Don’t get the wrong idea. We don’t
want a strike—except as a last resort—
and there isn’t one chance in a hundred
that we’ll have to strike. But we’ve
got to be prepared. We’ve got to build
up the strike fund.”
STRIKE

101

  Kim’s long fingers dug deeply in Mc-
Cann’s arm.

  “Mr. President,” Finn was address-
ing the thin man at the speaker’s table,
“I move that a special assessment of
ten dollars be levied on each member.
This to be effective at once; the money
to be added to the general strike fund.”
The thin man was getting out of
his chair when big-shouldered Mon-
tana Fells bellowed, “I second that!”
Finn was smiling when he faced the
crowd. “The motion’s before the house,
and all in favor may signify by the
usual method.”

  The electric mutter ran through the
crowd again. Then, faintly, someone
high in the balcony said, “Aye!” Other
voices came in, and the chorus grew to
a mighty roar.

  Finn smiled and nodded as the noise
abated. McCann’s head jerked around
as sudden movement exploded beside
him.

  Kim Saddler was on his feet. He
said, “Let go, curse you!” and shook
his brother’s hand off his arm. Then he
faced the platform and shouted:

  “Where’s the rest of our money?
Why don’t you tell us that, before you
bleed us for more?”

  Awed silence hit the smoky room.
Silence that stretched thin before Finn
said, “Will you repeat that question,
please?”

  “You can be darned sure I will.”
Kim’s lean face was paper-white, his
hands were knotted into fists at his
sides. “I want to know what’s happened
to the rest of our money. The union’s
had two thousand members for the last
four months. The dues are three dol-
lars a month. What happened to that
twenty-four thousand dollars? Why
can’t that go in the strike fund ?”
Someone yelled, “Throw him out!”
Other voices joined the clamor, and

then Finn was shouting for silence.

  “This hall costs you fifty or a hun-
dred a month.” Kim’s harsh voice rang
out. “And once or twice we’ve had free
beer. And this is the third special as-
sessment! W'ho gets the rest of the
money? You? The general manager
of the Falcon Plant is a piker along-
side of you.”

  Finn’s expression didn’t change.
“You can come to my office at any time,
and the books will be opened for your
inspection.”

  Mack was pulling at Kim’s arm, say-
ing, “Sit down, you fool! Sit down,
while you can still—”

  Again Finn had to wait for quiet
before he spoke. “I can do this. I can
bring a statement to the next meeting
showing where every penny of the
money was spent, and why those ex-
penses were necessary.”

  Kim Saddler twisted away from
Mack’s grip, tried to speak, but a storm
of protest blotted out his words.

  “Quiet! Quiet!” Finn’s great voice
brought a semblance of order again.
“He has a right to question me. Any of
you have. This is your union. I’m just
one of the officers. I’ll be glad to an-
swer any question....”

  “All right,” Kim Saddler roared,
“tell us what part murder has in union
activity. Tell us why you had O’Malley
killed! Tell us why—”

npHE quiet lasted for just a clock
tick, and then exploded into roar-
ing chaos. All over the hall, men were
coming to their feet, yelling. McCann
got a glimpse of Kim’s face as he
twisted off the bench. It was white, set,
and he was staring straight ahead with
the startled eyes of a sleep-walker who
has been suddenly awakened.

  Then Montana Fells was lurching
toward Kim, his big hands leaping for
102

ARGOSY

the tall man’s throat. Ryan was beside
Montana, his lips tight across his teeth,
the bottle still clutched in his hand.

  Mack shouted, “This way, Kim,
there’s a door—”

  But Montana Fells had Kim before
he could move—had his thick-fingered
hands locked around his throat, was
pushing his head back. Kim rained
blows on the big man’s face but he
didn’t seem to notice. An unholy light
flamed in his eyes, and the cords in his
neck stood out. His terrible grip never
lessened. Kim’s blows were weaker, and
his legs wilted suddenly.

  McCann pushed forward, slammed
into Ryan who turned open-mouthed.
McCann swept the bottle out of his
hand, swung it in a savage arc at a spot
just above Montana’s ear. Broken glass
and whisky sprayed over the big man.
He stood for just a second, unmoving,
and then fell like a dropped coat.

  Mack stooped, got his hands under
Kim’s arms. McCann bent to help. The
angry mutter grew to full-throated
roar. Kim was on his feet, swaying
toward the aisle that was blocked by a
solid wall of bodies. McCann was
swinging to follow when a shoulder
bumped his, and a low, cool voice said:
“The gun, fella! You’ll never get
out without it! Montana’s gun, it’s
under his arm!”

  McCann dropped to one knee,
fumbled under the big man’s coat. He
looked up, as his fingers found gun
metal. Ryan was standing behind him.
His head was bent, his hands thrust
deep in his pockets.

TAKE that guy out of town. Take
him clear to the coast, an’ don’t
slop on the way.”

  McCann came to his feet, lunged to-
ward the Saddler brothers.

  “Look out!” A fat man squawked.

“He’s got a gun!” He pressed back
away from the aisle. Others took one
look at McCann’s face and the black
automatic in his hand and they, too,
jammed away from the aisle. A lane
to the rear door opened as if by magic.
McCann could hear Finn’s big voice
above the roar of the crowd as he fol-
lowed the Saddler brothers through the
door. He turned to look back. The lane
was still open, and at the far end of
that lane Ryan was starting after him.
Frail, short, his eyes were shadowed
by a down-turned hat brim, his face
might have been a boy’s face save for
the two deep, harsh lines that bracketed
his mouth.

rpHEN the cool, night wind was in
their faces as they hurried through
the dark streets to the car. McCann
stayed a little distance behind the
others, watching the lighted square that
was the Union Hall door for any sign
of pursuit. There was none.

  Saddler whipped the car over the
Fifth Street ramp, then west on Rose-
more. Ten minutes later he parked in
front of a dine-and-dance place, and
said, ‘I’ll be right back/’ He slipped out
of the car. When he returned he was
stripping the foil off the neck of a pint
bottle. He thrust it into his brother’s
hands, said, “Here, Kim, you need a
drink.”

  The tall man shuddered, said,
“Thanks!” in a flat, dead voice, and
reached for the flask. He drank, and
then turned to McCann. “Lad, you got
me out of a bad spot.”

  “Forget it.”

  Mack said, “Out of that one, yes.
But this isn’t over yet/’

  “Why don’t you say what you’re
thinking?” Kim demanded. “Why
don’t you tell me what a crazy fool I
was? Why don’t you ask me why I
STRIKE

103

didn’t keep my mouth shut?” His voice
broke, then rasped on. “I tried, Mack,
I tried, but I had a bellyful of Finn’s
lies, and then—”

  “Stop it, man, that’s all behind us
now. We’ve got to think.’' Mack got
his pipe out of his pocket, loaded it
slowly. “They won’t dare kill you, at
least not the way they killed O’Malley,
not when every man in the union heard
you. That’s the thing that’ll stop them.
There are too many men in the plant
who didn’t want to join the union. One
more killing, and they’ll bolt. Finn
knows that. Did you see the way the
grinning devil sensed the pulse of them
tonight-? He’d not take a chance that’d
wreck his plans. It’ll be a different way,
that’s certain. An automobile accident,
or a—”

  “He couldn’t,” McCann cut in.
“Even Finn can’t get away with mur-
der!”

  “You’re wrong, lad. He’s done it
before, and he will do it again.”

  “Then why don’t you leave the

city?”

  The tall man turned. “Money, lad.
It costs money to feed and clothe a
family. You didn’t meet my two boys;
they were at a Scout meeting tonight.
And there’s three small ones in Kim’s
family. Our homes are here, and we’ve
worked in the Falcon Plant for years.
Then”—a rawness came into his voice
—“the Saddlers have never been good
at running.”

  “But there’s nothing to hold you
here,” Kim said to McCann. “You’d
be better off if you—”

  “He’s right, lad,” Mack said softly.
“Not only do you have to watch Finn’s
killers, but the rest of the men as well.
They think you’re a spy. They know
you were in Vick’s office before you
went to the paint shop, and they know
that you were transferred back to the

line. They think vou’re working for

Vick.”

  “But—”

   “Can’t you see, lad, that bald-headed
little ape’s clever? You wouldn’t work
for him, but if he can make the men
think you are working for him, he can
cover his real spies.”

  “So that’s what he’s doing?” Sur-
prise rode McCann’s hot words. “I
can’t see a dime’s worth of difference
between us. We’re all in bad.” He
paused thoughtfully, then went on.
“Two weeks ago I spent an afternoon
listening to a grand old man tell me
that our family had never known
enough to quit a fight. If it’s all right
with you, I’ll stick.”

   “It’s foolish, lad.”

  McCann passed the heavy automatic
into the front seat. “This should take
care of anything they try outside the
factory, and—”

  “And inside the plant,” Kim said
bleakly, “they’ll find me hard to kill.
I’ve spent too many years there.”

  Mack got the car under way again.
“It will be safer if we stay together as
much as possible. We’ll pick you up at
your hotel in the morning, lad.”
McCann didn’t answrer. He was re-
membering his father’s voice, his
words: “A word I didn’t think I’d
have to use on my son. Yelloiv!” And
there was a sudden tightness in his
chest, his throat was dry.

CHAPTER VIII

STORM WARNING

THE morning paper carried a head-
line which read: WAGE TILT
ANNOUNCED AT FALCON
PLANT. McCann’s eyes leaped to the
story below.

   A wage raise that will affect every man
   employed by the Falcon Motor Company
104

ARGOSY

   was announced here today. The new scale,
   which goes into effect at once, sets a new
   high for wages in the motor industry, and
   is expected to end all labor trouble among
   the Falcon employees ....

  McCann was carrying the newspaper
when he walked to the corner to wait
for the Saddler brothers. He grinned
cheerfully as he climbed into the car,
asked, “Did you see it? This means
the war’s over, and—”

  Mack shook his head. “It means
trouble, lad, black trouble. Finn will
have to find another reason now for
calling a strike. Falcon beat him to the
punch, and by raising the wages he
sidestepped the question of union
recognition. Finn isn’t interested in
wages, he wants closed shop. He wants
it badly enough to force a strike to get
it.”

  “But he can’t now,” McCann inter-
rupted, “the men got the higher pay
they wanted. They’ve—”

  Kim growled, “The men! Finn isn’t
thinking about the men. He wants
recognition, wants it because then he’d
be a little tin god, and Falcon would
have to ask his permission to breathe.”
“Then—”

  “Watch yourself, lad, there’s bad
trouble brewing!”

  The other workmen looked away
when the three of them came up the
walk to the plant gate. Again hostile
eyes, and the electric hum of angry
voices followed them past the time
clocks, and up the ramp to the assem-
bly line.

  There was an ominous pressure in
the big room. A real, terrible pressure
that stretched McCann’s nerves wire-
tight, and turned Kim’s face into a
white, twitching mask.

  Nor did that pressure vanish when
the line began to move, and the
strident, machine-gun clatter of the air-

hammers choked the room with throb-
bing sound. It showed in Robb’s sullen,
thinly lidded eyes, in the stiff set of
Mack’s shoulders.

  Kim showed it in other ways, too.
His flashing hands had lost some of
their deftness. They were old hands
now—stumbling, groping hands. Once
the shellac brush slipped from his fin-
gers, and a raw curse spilled from his
lips as he stooped to pick it up.

  An hour dragged past. Two. The
threat of impending disaster gradually
slipped away from McCann’s mind. He
had more than enough to do. Kim was
slow in finishing each time, and Mc-
Cann had to wait until the strip of in-
sulation was in place before he could
start his task. And each second counted
when there was only little more than a
minute allotted to each car.

  Sweat crawled on McCann’s back.
Robb snarled curses from the other
side of the line, and twice McCann saw
the sharp-faced foreman hovering in
the background.

  McCann spoke to Kim as he
shellacked the insulation in place on the
next chassis. “Don’t let it get you—”
Kim’s sweat-streaked face twisted to
face McCann. “It’s not me,” he panted,
“it’s the guy behind me. He can’t keep
up, and he keeps cornin’ over on me.
They’ll have to put a relief man in—”
The strip was in place. Kim stepped
back and away.

  McCann dropped the punches in
place, and signalled the hoist man to
lower the body that hung above them.
His face was thoughtful as he rammed
the body bolts home. This might have
been planned. They might force the
foreman to transfer Kim to another
job if he delayed the line. To a job
where they could—

   He finished his task, stepped back to
let Mack Saddler crowd past him. The
STRIKE

105

next chassis was crawling into position
under the body drop. Kim was only
half done.

  McCann placed one punch and
stepped back, waited. Kim grooved the
insulating strip in place, leaned for-
ward to pick up the brush.

  The hoist man was leaning half out
of his cab, lowering the sedan body an
inch at a time. McCann’s eyes flicked
from Robb’s face to the yellowish fea-
tures and knife-thin lips of the crane
man. He froze there staring, for just
a clock tick, while an uneasy warning
churned in his brain.

  He shouted wildly, “Kim! Watch
out!”

KIM’S eyes jerked toward him.
McCann had a split-second
glimpse of wide, frantic eyes, of parted
lips. And then the sedan body crashed
down! McCann heard a scream, and
knew, suddenly, that the hideous sound
came from his own throat. For a full
thirty seconds he swayed there, unable
to move. His eyes clung to the car in
front of him, to the sagging figure. .. .

  The dropping body might as well
have been the blade of a guillotine.
Kim had been trapped, his long body
bent over the chassis. He wouldn’t have
—couldn’t have known any pain. There
hadn’t been time. Just a frantic shout
—and death catching him, crushing
him there.

  One of Kim’s hands was close to his
side. Blood dripped from his finger-
ends to join the spreading redness on
the floor. The toes of his shoes left
a wide, double mark as the moving
assembly line pulled him down the
floor.

  Bellowing shouts rang loud above
the clamor of the air hammers. The
line stopped, and yammering voices re-
placed the noise of the machines.

  McCann found himself beside the
car, pulling Mack Saddler away from
the body.

  “Curse you,” Mack roared, “let go
of me! He might be alive. He might
be—”

  There were other men there then,
fifty or a hundred of them, swirling
around the body drop. Eager hands
reattached the hoist cables, there was
a grinding whir and the sedan body
was jerked clear.

  Taut silence exploded into a welter
of horrified murmurs.

  Mack stared at the pitifully crushed
thing that had been his brother. Stared
while his hands came up and knotted
into fists. Then he turned blindly away.
His eyes were glazed, fixed. The white
pain lines around his mouth looked as
though they’d always been there. He
pressed his hands against his temples,
pushed a single sentence through gray
lips. “God, be good to Kim. He tried,
you know he tried.”

  McCann’s throat was dry. He tried
to speak, but the words were only a
meaningless blur. Saddler brushed past
him to drop on a box and bury his face
in his hands.

  The white-jacketed first-aid men
were jamming their way into the open
space around the body. One of them
dropped the stretcher and looked sud-
denly away, his face greenish, his
mouth working.

  The other man cursed him, and
worked swiftly with a gray blanket.
A moment later the blanket-swathed
body was being carried through a nar-
row lane in the crowd.

  A big man in a rumpled suit was
talking to the sharp-faced foreman. He
turned, eyes searching the crowd, and
then yelled, “Where’s the man who
was acting as signal man here ?”

  McCann stopped in front of the big
106

ARGOSY

man. “I was the signal man,” he said.

  The big man’s face was screwed up
in an angry scowl. His eyes flamed
under bristling brows. “You were,
huh? Well, how’d this happen?”

  “He delayed in his job, and had to
stay with the chassis until it came
under the body drop. The crane man
dropped the body on him.”

  “Did you signal for him to lower
it?”

  “No!”

  “Well ?” The big man swung to face
the foreman. “Come on, come on,
what’s your version ? We can’t shut the
line forever.”

  “I didn’t see it, sir. I had noticed
that he was behind, a couple of times
this morning, but not enough to war-
rant a relief man.”

  Robb’s squat body edged through the
fringe of the crowd, stopped beside
McCann. The big man growled, “And
who are you?”

  “Robb, sir. I work on the other side
of the body drop. He and I”—he
nodded at McCann—“have the same
operation.”

  “Did you see the accident?”

   “Yes, sir.”

  “Get it out. What happened?”
“Saddler, the man who was killed,
was behind, sir.” Robb’s voice was
even, low. “He couldn’t keep up, and
he had to come under the body drop
with each car in order to finish his
job. He was there this time, and I
guess the kid here thought he’d fin-
ished when he waved the body
down—”

  “What? Are you saying that this
man signaled?”

  “It was a mistake, sir. He didn’t
look, and then when he saw Saddler
was still under the body drop he tried
to stop the hoist man, but I guess they
got mixed up then and—”

  “Why you—” Black anger beat in
McCann’s head. “You dirty liar! That
crane man dropped the body without
signal unless you waved him down!”
Robb’s expression didn’t change as
he looked at the big man, but his voice
became low, hesitant. “I—I hate to say
it, sir, but he did signal. You can ask
the hoist man.”

McCANN’S anger flamed, grew,
until in all the world there was
only one face—the flat, thick-lipped
face of Robb. Robb had done this!
Robb had killed Kim Saddler, and now
he was sidestepping the blame.

  McCann’s shoulders hunched, and
his gloved hands clenched. Robb’s
startled eyes jerked to McCann’s face,
and he tried to step back. McCann
threw the punch from his hips, straight
at Robb's sneering mouth with all the
weight and skill of his shoulders. Glove
leather splatted soddenly on flesh. Robb
went back, his mouth a crimson smear.
McCann was lunging after him when
the big voice shouted.

  “Grab him! Grab him!”

  Hands clawed at McCann’s shoul-
ders, threw him off-balance. A foot
was thrust suddenly between his legs,
and he crashed heavily to the floor. He
twisted, instantly, surged up. Blows
rained in his face. A fist smashed his
head back; a boot thudded into his ribs.

  The dull taste of blood was in his
mouth then. He could feel smooth con-
crete under his hands, knew that he
had to get up. Then a dozen hands
were pulling him erect. Darkness
crowded in on his brain. Dully he could
hear the big man saying, “That’s right,
hold him. The police’ll be here.”

  A moment later uniform blue
showed in the crowed, and the big man
said, “Over here, officer, arrest this
man for murder!”
STRIKE

107

   “What’s this?”

  “I want this man arrested for
murder!”

   The words smashed through the fog,
burned in McCann’s brain. Murder!
Didn’t the fool know that it was Robb
and the crane man ? Didn’t—

   This was just an ugly dream. He'd
wake in a minute and find . . .

   But the shining steel that clicked
over his wrists was real, and so was
the voice that said, “I warn you that
anything you say now will be used
against you!”

CHAPTER XI

INTERCESSION

THERE was no hot light this time.
The small office on the second floor
of police headquarters was lighted
only by the shaded glow of a green
desk lamp. There wras 110 violence—
only a uniformed cop in the chair be-
side the door, and a soft-voiced, gray-
mustached .sergeant behind a flat-
topped desk.

   McCann’s shoulders ached, his back
was numb from hours in the straight-
backed chair. His throat w^as raw. He’d
lost count of the number of times he’d
said, as he was saying now, “But I
didn’t kill Saddler. I didn’t signal the
hoist man, and if he says I did he’s
lying! Robb’s behind this. Robb, and
that—”

   The sergeant’s eyes never left Mc-
Cann’s face. “Wait a minute, fella. I
been here a long time, and since I been
here there’s been a lot of guys sit in
that chair. I seen ’em come in here for
everything from petty larceny to mur-
der. Tough guys, an’ punks, an’ they
all say the same thing. They got an
alibi, that’s the first thing. Then they
say we’re framin’ ’em, that they ain’t
guilty. Not to hear ’em tell it. They all

start out that way, but sooner or later
we get the truth.”

  “But I didn’t kill Saddler!”

  “You were there, you were the sig-
nal man, and there’s a couple of wit-
nesses that saw you tell the crane man
to drop that sedan body.”

  “You’re wrong,” McCann said des-
perately, “I—I was framed. I told you
who did it.”

  The sergeant grunted disgustedly,
“Okay.” He swung, spoke to the cop
beside the door. “Hey, give Black a
yell, will you? This guy’s goin’ down-
stairs an’ meet the wreckin’ crew. He’ll
give—an’ it won’t be nice.”

  The cop went out.

  “See?” The sergeant planted both
elbows on the scarred desk-top.
“You’re goin’ to have to talk sooner or
later. You might as well get it over.
Maybe you can get the D.A. to let
you cop a manslaughter plea. That
won’t get you the chair, an’ he can
clean the case up in a hurry.”

  McCann didn’t answer. He was
trapped. The frantic realization grew
in his mind. As thoroughly trapped as
Kim Saddler had been when the sedan
body hurtled down to crush him. Ruth-
lessly, perfectly. He'd have to face the
reporters soon, and one of them would
recognize him. Every paper in the
State would carry banner headlines.

GOVERNOR’S SON FACES
MURDER CHARGE!

   There’d be pictures. Pictures of hin>
in a cell, of his grim-mouthed, iron-
backed father behind the desk in the
governor’s mansion. Suddenly his
father’s hard, unrelenting voice seemed
to ring in his ears:

  “My son will receive exactly the
same treatment that any other man
facing a similar charge would receive.
108

ARGOSY

Should the courts find him guilty there
will be no mercy shown!”

   The cop came back through the door,
and the sergeant wheeled around to
ask, “Well, where’s Black?”

   “He aint’ cornin', Sarge. I met the
captain in the hall, an’ he wants the
kid in his office right away. They got
everybody an’ his brother in there. Old
Man Falcon’s there, an’ the chief, an’
a—”

   “Okay.” The sergeant settled back
heavily in his chair. “You’re gettin’
important now, fella. The big shots
want to see you.” He prodded the air
with a stiff thumb. “On your feet, he’ll
show you where to go.”

  McCann got up silently, and pre-
ceded the big cop out the door, and
down the hall.

  “In here.” The cop stepped past
McCann to open a door.

   McCann was well into the room be-
fore he saw the familiar, blocky figure
in the chair beside the window. Stan-
ley ! Had the news of his arrest already
got to the State Capitol? Or*-?

   McCann stiffened as Stanley’s eyes
raked over his face.

rpHEIR eyes locked, held. There
was quick tightening around Stan-
ley’s mouth. Then, almost imper-
ceptibly, he shook his head. He was
looking away, carefully stripping the
wrapper from a slender cigar when the
red-faced police captain spoke.

   “Duncan, we’ve uncovered some in-
formation that makes it necessary for
you to—”

   “Better do this right,” Stanley cut
in evenly. “Tell him he has a right to
a lawyer. He doesn’t have to talk to us
unless he wants to.”

   “Yes, Mr. Stanley.” The captain’s
face twisted into an annoyed scowl. He
leaned forward, said heavily, “Duncan,

you have the right to wait and consult
an attorney before you answer any
questions, but these gentlemen would
like to talk to you now.”

  McCann said, “Thanks. I’ll be glad
to tell them anything I can.”

   “Fine.” A lean, dark man left a chair
near the wall and came to the desk.
McCann stifled a gasp of surprise. He
didn’t have to be told who this man
was. J. N. Falcon’s picture was in print
too often. The dark eyes, the shaggy
brows, and the jutting crag of a nose
were unmistakable. J. N. Falcon, head
of the Falcon Automobile Company.

  Falcon put one hand on the desk.
“This gentleman and I,” his flat ges-
ture indicated Stanley’s bulk, “have
been investigating this accident since
the time the report of your arrest
reached my office. We’re here because
we’re convinced of your innocence.”
“Thank you, sir, I—”

  “We checked back,” Falcon went on,
“and found that the hoist man had
vanished. The police have found no
trace of him so far. It might have been
possible for you and the hoist man
to have planned this, but I’m inclined
to doubt it. The hoist man was trans-
ferred this morning from a different
part of the plant. You would have had
no way of knowing that he would be,
and no way of arranging this so
quickly.” He waited a moment and
then added, “We’d like to hear your
story.”

  “Surely.” Words crowded McCann’s
tongue. This was the chance he’d been
waiting for. This—

  And then he knew that he could say
none of those words. The union could
still reach Mack Saddler, could still kill
him as ruthlessly as they’d killed his
brother. Any accusation he made would
sign Mack’s death warrant. Besides he
had no proof. He knew—every man
STRIKE

109

in the plant knew—but that wasn’t evi-
dence that would stand in court.

  “Well?” Falcon was leaning for-
ward, waiting.

   “Just a second.” Stanley got to his
feet. “Maybe I’d better tell him whom
I represent. I’m investigating the
rumors of labor trouble for Governor
McCann.”

   McCann wet his lips, swallowed.
Stanley went on before he could
speak, his narrowed eyes an icy gray.
“What we want to know is this. Was
this accident the result of trouble with
this new union?”

  “No,” McCann said quietly, “as far
as I know it wasn’t.”

  “You’re sure?”

  “Yes.”

   “Then,” Falcon said, “the only thing
that remains is that the hoist man got
mixed up in his signals and dropped
the sedan body at the wrong time. He
kept quiet, fearing arrest, then ran.”
“But, Mr. Falcon,” the Captain
asked, “how about this? Wouldn’t it
have been possible for Duncan here to
have signaled the hoist man to drop
that—”

  “No.” Falcon turned away from the
desk. “If you had taken the trouble
to send one of your men up into that
crane cab you would have known bet-
ter. The operator can not help but see
the chassis and the men around it if
he can see the hand signals.” His voice
was tired, thin. “Your job will be wait-
ing for you, lad. I’ve never yet fired an
employee of mine for something he
didn’t do.”

  McCann said, “Thanks,” and
watched the door close behind Falcon’s
gaunt figure.

THERE was a moment of silence
after Falcon had gone, and then
the captain shrugged, saying, “That

puts you in the clear, guy. If Falcon
don’t want you, we don’t.”

  Stanley spoke then, his voice a soft
purr. “I’d like a chance to talk to Dun-
can before he leaves. If you’ve got an
office I could use . .

  “Sure.” The captain got to his feet.
“Use this one. I’m overdue at home
now anyway. I’ll clear Duncan at the
desk. He can leave whenever you’re
through with him.”

  The captain left, and Stanley
grinned at McCann. “I was afraid you
wouldn’t get the idea, Duncan.” He
dropped in a chair. “Sit down, I’ve a
couple of questions to ask.”

  McCann waited silently. “Davork
and I are investigating labor conditions
for your father. You’ve been working
in the Falcon Plant, maybe you can
help.”

  “I know a little about it.”

  “Swell. Davork and I aren't getting
along any too well. He’s been your
father’s secretary too long. He insists
on working alone.”

  “I know,” McCann said bleakly.
“Davork’s like that. I’ll tell you what
I know if you’ll give me your word
not to tell the Governor that I’m here.”
Stanley nodded slowly. “I thought
it might be like that.”

  “Okay. This union’s big, bigger than
anything I’ve ever seen. They’ve got
a hundred per cent membership in the
Falcon Plant.” Swiftly McCann
sketched in details of the method of
organization. Stanley’s cigar went out
in his hand as the big man hunched
forward, listened intently.

  “They’ve killed two men that I know
of,” McCann finished, “and it looks
like they’re going to get away with it.”
Stanley whistled. “This is big.”

  “Too big to operate without protec-
tion of some kind. There’s someone
higher up than Finn. There has to be.
110

ARGOSY

He couldn’t order men killed if he
didn’t know he’d get away with it.
That means the city officials are in his
pay, or—”

  “Or,” Stanley cut in harshly, “one
of the state police officials. He’s cov-
ered, that’s a cinch, but we’ll find out
who’s covering him.” He struck flame
from his lighter, relit his cigar. “What
are you going to do?”

  “Go right on working here.”
Stanley frowned. “It sounds like it
might be dangerous, kid, but I guess
you can take care of yourself. Listen:
I’ll give you my phone number, and
if anything comes up you can call me.
I’ll see that your father gets the in-
formation. Give us warning before
Finn calls a strike. That’ll tie up the
whole city.” Stanley penciled a num-
ber on the back of his card. “There,
that’ll get me any time.”

  McCann got to his feet. “I’ll be
going, then.”

   Stanley said, “Okay. I’m just wait-
ing for Davork, and then we’re driv-
ing back to the Capitol.”

McCANN left Stanley, rode down
in an elevator, and collected his
belongings from an impersonal desk
sergeant. A couple of minutes later he
was pushing through a swinging door,
and out into the street.

   He went east, striding full into the
face of the raw wind. He had nearly
reached the center of the block when
the big sedan swung in ahead of him,
and rolled across the walk to stop just
a car length down the narrow-walled
alley.

  McCann paused, eyes shiny with
thought. Finn’s car. He’d have known
that blue and silver paint job anywhere.
McCann waited a full half minute,
scowling in taut indecision, before he

moved close to the building front and
flattened hard against, the brick at the
corner of the alley.

   He could hear the indistinct rumble
of Finn’s big voice above the low mur-
mur of the engine. Another man spoke
then, and the sound put ridges of
muscle along McCann’s jaw. He’d
heard that harsh, nasal twang before.

  The car door opened then, and
Finn’s voice was plain. “I’ll keep in
touch with vou.”

   “Do that.”

  The sedan’s motor snarled, gears
snicked, and it was gone. McCann
waited. Footsteps rang hollowly on the
damp concrete, came toward him. Mc-
Cann moved as the short figure loomed
in the alley mouth. He lowered his
head, took two quick steps, and
rammed solidly into the short man.

   The short man cursed as he stumbled
backward. His hat bounced off, rolled
toward the gutter. “Why don't you
watch where you’re goin’ ?”

  McCann mumbled, “Sorry,” and
scooped up the short man’s hat. They
were close together when he straight-
ened. Close enough for McCann to see
a thin mustache, thick glasses, full lips,
and a long, pointed chin. Then the
short man snatched his hat from Mc-
Cann’s hand, wheeled away.

   McCann stared after him, said, “So
long, Davork,” in a low, bitter voice.
His eyes were bleak, and his face was
set as he strode into the night.

   Ten minutes before he’d been telling
Stanley that the union had the protec-
tion of some higher-up, some power.
And now he had seen Davork and Finn
together. His father’s secretary and the
union boss! McCann’s throat was tight.
The union was protected all right. And
it looked like the protection came
straight from the Governor’s desk!

TO BE CONTINUED NEXT WEEK
And See the World

By MURRAY LEINSTER

Author of "The Quest of the Golden Lie," “Battle Piece,” etc.

BACK in the old days in San Fran-
cisco—this was quite a long while
ago—there was a runner named
Linipy who worked for a crimp named Mc-
Mahon. They were a queer outfit. Artists
in their way, if you know what I mean.
Limpy’s job as a runner, of course, was to
go sailing out and meet incoming ships.
He’d carry his pockets full of bottles and
pass drinks around on a ship he’d boarded
while he told what a swell saloon and rest
house McMahon ran for sailors ashore.
According to Limpy, McMahon was a reg-
ular mother to land-bound lonely seamen.
And the liquor in the bottles Limpy passed
around was a sinister, Janus-faced brew
that caused strong tars to become babes in
Limpy’s arms.

  Even the biggest and toughest brawlers
who sailed the seven seas wouldn’t do a
thing against Limpy’s never-failing drops.
They were sure-fire.

  By the time the ship was anchored and
tidy, the forecastle hands were raging to
get on shore. If they didn’t go with Linipy,
they’d go in some other crimp’s boat, and
to some other place. Since they hadn’t
drawn all their pay, their skipper was satis-
fied. All that they did draw, the crimp got.
Then one morning they’d wake up in a
strange forecastle at sea—with bad head-
aches—and find that the crimp had col-
lected the maximum legal advance on each
man.

  So the crimp was satisfied, and the
captains were satisfied. Nobody was an-
noyed except the sailors.

  That was the regular trick. But Limpy
and McMahon were artists in their line.
Also, McMahon was an economical soul.
It irked him to have a bunch of drunken
forecastle hands around his place, break-
ing things and carousing. So Limpy and

  Limpy wasn’t very bright about most
things—but his drops were sheer perfec-
tion.

McMahon—being artists—evolved a sim-
pler and more efficient way of doing busi-
ness. McMahon had a place that looked
like a saloon. And he had a very special
kind of knock-out drops. They were
Limpy’s drops. Limpy had perfected them
and they were a creation worthy of an
artist.

  Limpy still acted as runner and met the
ships. He described the imaginary delights
to be had in the imaginary saloon—the
non-existent music, the mythical dance-
ha'll girls. He got the forecastle hands so
interested that they would jump into his
boat, and they’d go to McMahon’s and
McMahon would greet them heartily and
say the first drink was on the house. And
they’d drink it. Limpy’d take one too, of
course, but his never had his drops in it.
He’d drink his drink, and grin at the
others, waiting.

  The peculiar thing about Limpy’s drops

111
112

ARGOSY

was that they hit a man’s legs first, not
his head.

  He couldn’t get up.

  So Limpy’d sit there, grinning, while
McMahon went off—ostensibly to summon
entertainment. And Limpy’d grin, and grin,
until one of the sailors tried to get up.
And he couldn’t, and the others would try,
and find that they couldn’t. Then Limpy
would begin to laugh. And he’d keep on
laughing, in spite of the sailors cursing
him horribly, until the drops finished their
work and the men fell bitterly to sleep.
And just before they’d go off, Limpy would
give them a grin and jeer at them. “Have
a nice trip, boys,” he’d say. “And see the
world.” Then Limpy would help McMahon
clean their pockets and carry them out
back—often right into waiting horse-drawn
cabs that took them to another ship that
needed a crew. McMahon never had any
trouble shipping men he’d crimped. They
weren’t all soft and groggy from two or
three weeks of drinking. They were hard
and ready for duty.

  Limpy enjoyed his work. Laughing at
men who’d swallowed knock-out drops in
their first drink ashore was just his style
of humor. And besides, he took inordinate
pride in his artistry. He thought nobody
else could do the job with exactly the
finesse with which he did it. He even
got uppish to McMahon. He demanded
more money, and, when McMahon re-
fused, Limpy held out on what he took
from the pockets of the unconscious sailors.
He felt that the whole business depended
on him.

  You see, he’d perfected the drops.

  But McMahon couldn’t see it that way.
Although there were never any words be-
tween them—McMahon was too old and
smart a hand to argue with the smartest
crimp that the Golden Coast had ever seen
—Limpy knew that McMahon was watch-
ing him—and waiting. But he wasn’t afraid.
Limpy was smart. He knew all the angles—
although they didn’t call them angles in
those days—and he knew that McMahon
wouldn’t dare start anything. Oh sure,
Limpy was riding high—making pretty

good money and enjoying his joke, watch-
ing his drops work on the poor chumps.
Limpy wouldn’t have had his life changed
for anything on this earth.

ONE day Limpy sailed out and met a
ship coming in, and presently led ri
motley, thirsty, uproarious mob of fore-
castle hands into McMahon’s place. And
the first drink was on the house: Limpy
drank one too, but he knew his didn’t
have his special drops in it. The peculiar
thing about Limpy’s drops—you will re-
call—was that they hit a man’s legs first,
not his head.

  He couldn’t get up.

  So Limpy sat there, grinning. The joke,
for Limpy, never got stale. These men
were looking forward to two or three weeks
of soft, uproarious living, but Limpy knew
that the cabs were already waiting out in
back to carry them to the Vestra. And the
Vestra’s captain was so tough that even
crimps made him pay extra for his crews.
One trip on the Vestra was enough for any
sailor.

  One trip on the Vestra, most seafaring
men said, was more than enough for any
sailor on any coast.

  Limpy grinned at them until one of the
sailors tried to get up and couldn’t, and
then Limpy laughed outright. Then the
rest tried their legs and found them like
sponge and they knew what was the mat-
ter. They cursed Limpy horribly. Some of
them tried to crawl toward him, to kill
him, but their movement just made the
drops work faster.

  Limpy didn’t even bother to move when
they tried to crawl toward him. He knew
his drops. He laughed until he nearly fell
out of his chair as the cursing men went,
one by one, to sleep.

  Then McMahon appeared at the back
door. He grinned at Limpy. Then Limpy
started to get up to clean out the men's
pockets and help carry them to the waiting
cabs.

 But—

  Limpy found that he couldn’t get up.

  His drops were perfect, weren't they?

Somebody is getting worried. Two attempts
are made on Johnny’s life—and, as a final
blow, a little juggling of the election returns
pushes Johnny out of office, and Blue is
legally declared sheriff once more. No sooner
has that happened than Johnny and his two
deputies are framed for a bank robbery and
forced to skip town. But they don’t go far,
for Johnny is still determined to find Picket-
Stake’s murderer.

JOHNNY HENDRY was perfectly con-
tent to be the easy-goin’ deputy of an
even easier-goin’ sheriff in a county that
seemed to be run solely for the benefit of
hard-cases, wanted men, cattle thieves and
killers. Johnny’s idea was that no real man
ever ran to the law in trouble, anyway.

 But when old Picket-Stake Hendry,
Johnny’s foster father, was reported dead,
Johnny’s mood abruptly changed. He wasn’t
going to rest until Picket-Stake’s killer had
been brought to the gallows.

  Johnny’s first move is to get himself
elected sheriff, nosing out Baily Blue, his
former boss, by a scant margin. Choosing
Hank B render and ex-badman Turk Hebron
for his deputies, Johnny begins to clean up
the town in grim earnest.

  Apparently he’s a little too successful.

This story began in

8 A—24	113

 jDUT Picket-Stake isn’t dead at all. He
 ■*-* shot faster than the man who attacked
 him, and has' let himself be thought dead just
 to see what Johnny would do about it.
 Picket-Stake has found a rich claim but the
 money doesn’t matter if young Johnny is
 nothing but an amiable ne’er-do-well.

    Meanwhile a clue is provided to Picket-
  Stake’s “slayer” when sample ore turns up
  at the assay office—ore that could only have
  come from Picket-Stake’s saddlebags. At-
  tempting to ferret out the mystery, Hugo
  Miller, the assayer, discovers that the man
  who had brought in the ore and the claim
  papers was merely a more or less innocent
  pawn in this game of gold and death. But
  before he can learn any more, the man is
  killed and the claim papers stolen. Miller,
  disappointed that the ore hadn’t been very
  rich, has falsified the assayer’s report to

the Argosy for July 3
114

make the killer think he’d struck it rich.
Then when he went to the claim, Miller in-
tended to nab him. But now the chase seems
hopeless. . . .

/^HIEF among Johnny’s supporters is
Major Fitz, the manager of the big
syndicate-owned Bar 33. Fitz’s fellow cat-
tlemen put his name on the list of undesir-
ables they gave to Johnny; but even so,
Johnny can’t believe that Fitz is dishonest.

  And yet Fitz is the clever spider in the
web of Cosmos County crime. Through
Leach Wigran’s band of desperadoes, Fitz
has been behind all the robbing and the
rustling. It was one of Fitz’s men who tried
to kill Picket-Stake, and it was another of
Fitz’s men who found the body of the slain
gunman, stole from it the ore that Picket-
Stake had left for him to find—and died
before Fitz’s gun when he was no longer
useful to the Major. It is Fitz who has
framed Johnny . . . Fitz who worked the elec-
tion swindle that cheated Johnny of his star.
. . . And it is Fitz who, falling into Picket-
Stake’s bandit trap, now thinks himself in
possession of the claim papers to a phenom-
enally rich mine.

  Anxious to maintain the friendship of
Johnny’s supporters, who are the law-abiding
element of the town, Fitz offers a reward
for the discovery of the “real’' bandits, or
for evidence tending to prove Johnny inno-
cent of the bank robbery charge.

  It is a smart move and completely wins
over people who were beginning to have
doubts of the Major's honesty. Nora, the
girl who loves Johnny, is surer than ever
that Fitz is Johnny’s friend, and Commis-
sioner Bledsoe, watching Fitz ride away
after posting the reward notice, calls the
Major “the finest man in the whole of Cos-
mos County.” Her eyes shining, Nora agrees.
With Major Fitz on his side how can
Johnny Hendry lose?

CHAPTER XIII

STUBBORN JOHNNY

JOHNNY remembered a little-known
water hole high in the foothills of
of the Calicos that Pick had told
him about long ago, and it was here they
decided to make their camp. It was a
long, silent ride, for all of them were dis-
heartened at the news Johnny had brought
from Hugo. It meant that every clue they
had to Pick’s killer had vanished. And of
the three, Johnny was the most downcast.

Outlawry would have meant nothing so
long as he had a chance to even Pick’s
score, but now that this was gone, these
long and aimless days on the dodge would
be intolerable. He resolved grimly not to
remain idle, waiting for chance to free
him of these outcast bonds. And he had the
wisdom to sense that Turk and Hank, good
men that they were, would fret at idle-
ness until one or the other of them would
decide to pull out. He must have a plan,
something to keep them all busy until they
could pick up again the trail of Pick’s
killer.

  The camp did not suit him, but in the
circumstances, it was the safest. Tucked
in a fold of a gaunt and up-ended field
of malpais, the trail to it was devious and
rocky. To cross the malpais would have
meant that the horses’ hooves would be
cut to ribbons, so that it was necesary
to follow a thin ribbon of arroyo, which
angled down through the malpais field to
strew its pebbles over the glass-sharp ter-
rain. Wood had to be hauled; there was
no grass; but there was a tiny spring of
good water seeping out of a crack in the
black rock, and the jagged, up-thrust sides
of a canyon afforded them the shelter they
needed. If it was hard to get to, then it
was all the safer, Johnny reasoned.

  They spent the first day making the
camp livable. They raked the sand and
stones out of the arroyo into a small pocket
of the canyon, so their horses would have
a place to move around. Wood was hauled.

  In mid-afternoon, the work was done,
and it was now, Johnny knew, that the
tedium of passive waiting would begin.
Turk had looked at him several times to-
day with a question in his eyes. Hank was
more phlegmatic, but Johnny knew they
were both thinking the same thing.

  Squatting on his haunches against the
steep side of the canyon, Johnny rolled a
smoke and contemplated the camp. To
Turk, who was sitting beside him, he said,
“Well, it ain’t much, Turk, but then we
won’t have to be in it much.”

  Turk looked at him swiftly. “How come?
We’re hidin’, ain’t we?”
KING COLT

115

  Hank strolled across to join them now.
Johnny waited until he too was seated,
then said. “Hidin’? Maybe you could call
it that. But if you keep movin’, you’re
harder to find than if you sat still, aren’t
you?”

  “But what can we do?” Hank growled.
“Hunt the whole Calicos for that claim
jumper that killed Pick?”

  “Remember the proposition I made you
when I thought I was goin’ to be sheriff?”
Johnny countered. “Well, that still holds.
We're goin’ to clean up this county.”
“How?”

  “Rustle from rustlers,” Johnny declared.
He paused, waiting for them to comment.
When they didn’t, he said, “Me, I’m not
goin’ to let anybody drive me out of this
county. I aim to live here. Also, I aim to
be sheriff of it some day. And when I am,
I’m goin' to drive these hard-cases out,
just like I promised. Well, maybe that
day’s far off, but I reckon I can start in
to work right now.” He grinned. “Also,
since I ain’t sheriff yet, I won’t be both-
ered by all the laws a sheriff is bothered
with. I’ll fight these jaspers their way.”
Turk looked fondly at him and laughed.
“I could show you some tricks, fella’.”
“Good! That’s what I want. And Hank
can learn ’em too—just in case he’s hard
up for a job some day. How about it,
Hank?”

  Hank grinned and nodded. They were
with him, Johnny knew.

  "When I thought I was goin’ to be
sheriff,” he went on, “I went to Major
Fitz with a proposition. It was this.” And
he told them about the lists the ranchers
had given him of the men they believed
should be driven out of the county.

  “I got the answers,” Johnny finished.
“Who do you think got voted the most
unwanted man in Cosmos county?”
“Me?” Turk queried.

  Johnny grinned and shook his head.
“Major Fitz.”

TURK was surprised, but Hank, re-
membering things he’d seen while
working under Fitz on the Bar 33, was

not; and Johnny, seizing on Hank’s lack
of surprise, questioned him. “You’re not
surprised, Hank. Why not?”

  “I dunno,” Hank said, after a moment’s
thought. “There was a time when I thought
Fitz was a broad-gauge hombre, a man
to ride the river with. Now, I dunno. I
think he puts up a good front. But some-
thin’ goes on in his head that we don't
see.”

   “You think he could be a rustler?”

  ‘T don’t see how,” Hank murmured. “I
worked on the Bar 33 for a long time.
None of them boys was doin’ any "con-
siderable night ridin’. On the other hand,
they wasn’t a good crew, about what you
could expect in a company outfit.”

   “Then if Fitz doesn’t steal cattle, how’d
his name get at the head of this ranchers’
list?”

  “Maybe they just got a feelin’, like I
have,” Hank replied. “Remember that
jasper that tried to get away with the
Esmerella gold? I can’t prove it, but I
feel like Fitz had somethin’ to do with
that.”

  Turk said reminiscently, “I knowed a
bank president once. He was the most
pious son of a gun in the world. He prayed
longer and louder than anybody in church.
Come to find out, he was makin’ too much
money out of the bank. He was tied up
with a cattle-stealin’ ring. He’d pass on
the word to the rustlers about who was
borrowin’ money to save their places and
their cattle. Then those folks would be
stole blind and the bank would foreclose
on the place. He had a good thing out of
it—and he never wore a gun.” He looked
at Johnny. “That’s what you’re hintin’
about Fitz, ain’t it?”

  “About,” Johnny said.

  Presently Hank said, “Then if some-
body’s doin’ his rustlin’ for him, who is
it?”

  “What do you say, Turk?” Johnny
asked. “You know all those boys.”
“There’s only one man doin’ a real busi-
ness, cattle-stealin’,” Turk replied. “That’s
Leach Wigran. The rest of them—me, too
—wasn’t swingin’ an awful wide loop.
116

ARGOSY

We’d take a dozen head here, and a dozen
there and then quit for a month until
we’d drunk it up. Once in a while, some
of us’d get together, but Leach was the
only broad-gauge cow thief.”

  “Then Fitz would be backin’ him?”
Johnny asked.

   “I never said so.”

  “He’d have to be. If not, these honest
ranchers wouldn’t put him ahead of Leach
Wigran on those lists, would they?”

  “Why don’t you asK emr Turk
drawled, grinning.

  Johnny’s lean face showed disgust. “Ask
’em? If they’re scared to sign a name to
those lists, they’re scared to say it out
loud, aren’t they?”

  Turk and Hank nodded.

  “All right. My plan is danged simple,”
Johnny said grimly. “I think Fitz is be-
hind Leach. I aim to get proof.”

  “How?”

  “I dunno. But I’m goin’ to saddle up
in an hour and try to find out. You ridin’
with me?”

THEY were. It was decided they would
ride over to Leach Wigran’s spread.
Perhaps by watching Leach's movements,
observing as well as they could whom he
talked to, who his visitors were, and how
he worked, they might turn up a clue to
his tie-up with Fitz. Johnny doubted it,
however; it would be too easy for Leach to
ride into town and receive his orders, either
from Fitz, or, more likely, from some-
body sent by Fitz. Even by letter. Never-
theless, he couldn’t afford to pass up any
bets.

  But first, Johnny had another errand.
Hugo had promised to deliver Johnny’s
message to Nora last night. She was to
meet him east of town tonight, above the
road to the Esmerella mine, just after
dark. This would be on their way to Wig-
ran’s, and Johnny timed their ride so that
they approached Cosmos just as dusk was
settling into night.

  The meeting place was a huge old cedar
on a sloping butte, from whose top the
lights of Cosmos could plainly be seen.

   Johnny approached the place cautiously.
He saw a horse tied under the tree and
dismounted and walked slowly over.

  A voice said, “Johnny!” and in another
moment, Nora was in his arms.

  Johnny laughed huskily as she buried
her face against his chest. “I'm a better
outlaw than you think, honey,” he said
gently. “They haven’t got me yet.”

  “Oh, when will this be over, Johnny?”
Nora asked despairingly. “Today, Baily
Blue got a posse out hunting for you.”
“That’s queer,” Johnny murmured, try-
ing to see Nora’s face in the dark. “He
never bothered to do that before.”

  “Tip Rogers insisted.”

  “Tip?” Johnny asked softly. “So he’s
leadin’ the pack now.”

  “He was responsible for that gold that
was stolen.”

   “Does he think I took it?”

  Nora only nodded, and Johnny’s jaw
set a little more grimly in that darkness.
This was the way things went, then. Your
friends, like a pack of snarling dogs, only
waited until you were down to jump on
you.

  He led Nora over to the tree and they
sat down and Johnny asked for more new?
from Cosmos.

  “Yesterday Major Fitz posted a thou-
sand dollar reward for the bank robbers,”
Nora said quietly, “with this provision:
that the reward should not apply to the
capture of you or Turk or Hank.” She
paused. “You see he does believe in you,
Johnny.”

  Johnny said dryly, “Does he?”

  “Why do you say that?” Nora asked
swiftly.

  “Remember the ranchers’ list?”

  “That’s foolish!” Nora said vehemently.
“Do you still believe that?”

  “Eight men out of ten—all honest—
can’t be that far off.”

  “But what evidence have you!” Nora
cried. “Are you going to believe all the
gossip you hear about a friend? You’re
bitter at Tip, I know, because he believes
the worst of you. And now you’re doing
the same cruel thing to Major Fitz!”
KING COLT

117

   Johnny had no answer to that. Still, he
couldn’t change his convictions. It was
useless to tell Nora anything his judgment
was based upon; it wouldn’t convince her
either. So he remained silent, feeling her
anger against him, but stubbornly refus-
ing to try to justify himself.

Nora was stubborn too. “I'd like you
to explain a little, Johnny. You seem to
doubt that Major Fitz believes in you.”
“He may believe in my ability,” Johnny
said carefully. “But I doubt if he believes
in the same thing I do—and you do—that
this county deserves to be cleaned up.”
“What cause have you to say that?”
Nora demanded angrily. “Just because
eight sneaking ranchers who hadn’t the
courage to accuse a man to his face did
have the courage to do it behind his back?”
“Among other things.”

   “What other things.”

   Johnny said wearily, “Darlin’, you wear
long spurs. Let it go. Let’s talk about the
weather.”

   “What other things?” Nora insisted.
“They don’t matter,” Johnny said stub-
bornly. “This vote of the ranchers is good
enough for me.”

   Nora got to her feet, and Johnny rose to
face her. “Major Fitz is my friend,” Nora
said coldly. “He is yours, too.”.

   Johnny did not trust himself to speak.
“First, he offered you the foremanship of
the Bar 33 last year,” Nora went on ac-
cusingly. “Then he advised you to run for
sheriff. His men all voted for you. He was
the first man to approve your scheme of
this poll of undesirables. He gave you his
best man to act as your deputy. He tore
up heaven and earth for you when he
heard you’d been framed. And to top
that, Johnny, he has offered a thousand
dollars reward for the real bank robbers.”
She paused, and Johnny could almost feel
her contempt. “And now, in your deep
gratitude, you believe what eight cowardly
ranchers have to say against him without
giving the least bit of proof!” She paused,
waiting for Johnny to speak. He didn’t.
“Haven’t you anything to say for yourself,
Johnny?”

   “You’ve said it all, I reckon,” Johnny
replied huskily, stubbornly.

   “Then—then I don’t want to see you
again—not until you’ve changed your
mind,” Nora said haltingly. “I—I hate—
yes, hate—ingratitude more than crook-
edness or stealing or lying or—” Her voice
broke, and she turned away.

JOHNNY, standing motionless under
the tree, watched her mount and ride
off; and he could do nothing. But deep
inside him, he felt a wave of bitterness
and anger and unhappiness that was al-
most blinding. Automatically, he reached
in his pocket and brought out his tobacco
and rolled his cigarette. The smoke helped
to calm him, but his hands were shaking
so that he could scarcely hold the cigarette.

   It was many moments before he could
trust himself to turn and walk over to
where Hank and Turk were waiting. And,
he reflected, the heart gone out of him,
all excuse for his staying here had van-
ished—except one. Pick. When that score
was wiped off the slate, he would ride away.
Even now, he couldn’t blame Nora, but
he couldn’t understand either why she had
forced herself to choose between their love
and the casual friendship of Major Fitz.
For a moment, panic almost seized him,
and he was ready to mount his pony and
overtake Nora and apologize. But even
while he thought it, he knew that honesty
would not allow him to do it, and that
he was forever a slave—and a willing one
—to that conscience Pick Hendry had bred
into him.

  When he was mounted again, Turk said,
“Any news?”

  Johnny told him of what Nora had said
about Fitz’s offer. Turk and Hank did not
comment until they had put their horses
up the slope and headed north, toward
Wigran’s.

  “That makes us look like three prime
saddle-tramps, don't it?” Turk observed.

  “Look what’s behind it,” Hank said,
and Johnny saw that Hank agreed with
him.

  “What?”
118

ARGOSY

  “If he’s goin’ to play out this hand he’s
dealt himself, he’s got to have a front,
don’t he?” Hank argued sanely. “He knew
Nora would bring this news to us, and that
we’d think he was our friend.” Hank spat.

CHAPTER XIV

BAR 33 STEERS

LEACH WIGRAN’S Running W out-
fit was placed deep in the timbered
foothills of the Calicos. Johnny remem-
bered that it was a big frame place built
in the dead center of a grassy valley, so
that no one could approach it without
being seen. While Leach had not built it,
it seemed as if this place was designed
for a man of his shady business. Remote,
inaccessible, in the heart of a wide, good
range, with a thousand canyons behind it,
it was a perfect headquarters for a cattle
thief.

  They had left the road long since, and
were now making their slow way through
the tall lodgepoles when Johnny spotted
a light off to the right and below them.

“That’s the Runnin’ W,” Turk said.

  “We can’t move till daylight,” Johnny
said, “so we might as well pick a com-
fortable spot.”

  It was just breaking dawn when they
had settled on their place of observation.
It was on a high wooded ridge which af-
forded perfect cover, yet allowed them a
good view down through the tall avenue
of trees to the valley below.

  While they were not close enough to
identify individual riders going into the
Running W, they were near enough to
the road to ride dowTi for a closer view’.

  Slowly color began to bloom over the
gray landscape, and day marched forward.
Smoke began to rise from the chimneys of
the Running W, and Johnny settled down
to watch, while Turk and Hank rolled
up in their blankets for an hour of sleep.

  Soon, a strange and distant noise came
riding down from the south on the faint
wind. Johnny listened, head cocked. In an-
other moment he identified it. The sound
of a herd of bawling cattle cannot be mis-

taken for long. They were being driven
up the narrow valley to the Running W.

  Johnny moved over to Hank and Turk
about to wake them, and then decided tc
let them sleep. He could do this job alone,
and they were in no danger of discovery,

   So, putting the bridle back on his horse,
which was grazing with its saddle still on:
he mounted and worked his way down the
slope. He hurried, for the sound of the
driven cattle was becoming plainer every
minute. When he came to a sprawling
thicket of scrub oak, he raised up in his
saddle and looked down through the trees.
Here, he could get a good view of the
road. He tied his horse in the screening
oak, then went forward and down the slope
a way and hid himself in the brush.

  Presently, the point rider appeared, the
cattle strung out in a long bawling line be-
hind him. Johnny caught the brand on
this rider’s horse, and it was a Running
W.

  Then, through the cloud of dust that
the shuffling herd was kicking up, Johnny
tried to read the brands on the cattle. He
saw one he thought was a Bar 33, but
knew he might be mistaken. He could not
be sure because these cattle were branded
on the right hip, and he was on their left
side. But he was patient, knowing that
sooner or later he would have the chance
to make sure.

  And he did. One of the weary steers
angled out of the herd and began to graze,
turning back to get some fresh bunchgrass,
and Johnny saw with amazement that he
had been right. These w'ere Bar 33 steers!
Still he could not believe it, for this did
not fit in with his theory. But when a
calf, pushed ahead in the crush, finally
broke loose and turned around and started
bawling for its mother, Johnny was cer-
tain. Bar 33 cattle!

  When they were past, he walked back
to his horse, mounted and turned up the
slope, his face thoughtful. Hank and Turk
had been awakened by the noise of the
herd, and they had guessed where Johnny
had gone.

  “Whose were they?” Turk asked sleepily.
KING COLT

119

   "Bar 33, believe it or not,” Johnny said
grimly. Hank sat bolt upright in his
blankets.

  “Well, Til be sunk in sheep dip!” he
said slowly, looking at Johnny. “Leach is
s’posed to be workin’ for Fitz. Where does
that put us?”

  “In the wrong,” Turk ventured.
Johnny squatted on his haunches and
sifted gravel through his fingers, staring
thoughtfully at the ground. “Does Leach
bring all his rustled stuff up to this place?”
Johnny asked Turk.

  “Mostly, he drives it over to Warms.
It’s too easy to track up to here. He ain’t
got enough rock and rough weather and
wind and rain and hard goin’ here, and
that’s what you need to steal cattle.”
“Then why is he doin’ it?”

  Turk shrugged. Johnny was silent for a
full minute, and then he rose and savagely
threw down his handful of gravel.

  “This don't make no sense at all!” He
looked up at Hank. “You reckon Fitz sold
or give him those cattle?”

  “Might be—in payment for a job, or
somethin’.”

   “I’m goin’ to find out.”

  “How?”

  “Backtrack, and see if the boys even
tried to hide the tracks of this herd. If
they did, it might be they stole the beef.
If they didn’t, it'd mean Fitz knew about
them bein’ moved.”

AN hour later, the three of them rode
down off the slopes to the valley bot-
tom, and picked up the sign of the cattle.
An hour of following the tracks showed
them that the Running W men had taken
no pains to cover up cattle signs. A two-
hour drive to the east, in the rocky, moun-
tain going, would have afforded the Run-
ning W men a terrain which would make
the tracking of the beef less easy. Ap-
parently, then, they were making no at-
tempt to conceal the drive, although they
had been careful to avoid the roads.

  It was only when they did not find a
bed ground, or place where the riders had
camped, that Johnny became suspicious

again. “If they were drivin’ bought beef,
they’d’ve stopped to make a camp,
wouldn't they, and rest the stuff?”

  “Sure,” Turk said. “It’s a two-day
drive from Fitz’s place, if they didn’t push
’em.”

   “Let’s go on,” Johnny said grimly. “They
looked pushed.”

   In mid-afternoon, Hank, riding ahead as
a sort of scout, wheeled his horse and rode
back. “Pull off in the brush,” he said.
“Somebody else has the same idea as us.”

   They turned off behind a ridge into the
brush, and dismounted. Johnny mounted
the ridge and bellied down to see who
was coming.

   A lone rider came into sight—Kennicott,
one of the ranchers Johnny had seen some
days ago. He was riding at a fast walk,
eyes on the ground.

  “It wasn’t his beef,” Johnny mused,
“Why is he cuttin’ sign for it?”

   When Kennicott came to the place where
Johnny and Turk and Hank had pulled
off the trail of the cattle, he reined up.
For a moment, he stared at their tracks,
then up at the ridge, and suddenly whirled
and spurred his horse off into the brush.
A minute later, Johnny caught sight of
Kennicott’s horse heading back in the di-
rection from which he had come.

   Johnny returned to the horses and told
what he had seen.

   “Kennicott?” Hank exclaimed. “It ain't
his beef.”

  “Maybe he was as curious as we was,”
Turk offered.

  Johnny remembered that Kennicott
might be one of the eight who accused
Fitz. More evidence. He turned a thought-
ful face to the south. “It’s about time I
talked to Hugo Wilks,” he murmured.
“I’ve got to find out what’s goin’ on in
town.”

  They stopped on the outskirts of Cos-
mos just after midnight. The town, as in
the days before Johnny Hendry’s brief
spell of sheriffin’, was roaring wide open.
The saloons were a bedlam of noise; oc-
casional gunshots racketed down the
street. A ranny, dead drunk in his saddle,
120

ARGOSY

galloped past without even seeing them.

  Johnny made his way carefully down
the back alleys until he arrived at Hugo’s.
A pencil of light lay under the rear door;
Johnny moved over to the window and
looked in before he knocked. Hugo, his
feet tilted on his desk, was deep in a book.

  At Johnny’s entrance, he rose and
frowned. “I’ve been worried,” Hugo said,
regarding Johnny with fond seriousness.
“Blue was out this morning lookin’ for
you with a posse.”

  Johnny grinned and sat down. “He’ll
never find us. We’ve got a safe hide-out.”
“That’s what he said when he came
back,” Hugo observed dryly.

  “Came back?” Johnny echoed. “You
mean he only looked for us one morn-
ing?”

  “Oh, Tip Rogers is still out, but Blue
was called back to town by business.
Major Fitz had a herd of beef stolen.”
“Ah,” Johnny said. “Did he?”

  “He and his men rode into town this
morning and started yelling for Blue. It
seems a herd of his just vanished.” Hugo
shook his head, “The hard-cases will start
working on Fitz now, since he put up that
reward money. Fitz thinks that’s what’s
behind the rustling.”

  “Does he now?” Johnny murmured.
Hugo looked sharply at him, his
curiosity awakened by the tone of Johnny’s
voice. For a moment, Johnny was tempted
to tell Hugo what he suspected of Major
Fitz, but he refrained. If he was wrong
in his guess—and he was sure he wasn’t
—it would not be fair to Fitz. Besides, a
secret can be kept only by a few. He
said quickly to Hugo, “Did Blue go out
with Fitz?”

  “Out and back. The rustlers drove the
stuff into the mountains, Blue said, and
didn’t leave a sign.” Hugo smiled wryly.
“It’s the old excuse.”

  “Into the mountains,” Johnny mur-
mured, smiling privately. “So Blue give
up?”

  “He did. Fitz was helpless.”

Johnny looked at Hugo with some
curiosity. “Has anyone claimed that it was

me and Turk and Johnny that stole Fitz’s
stuff?”

Hugo shook his head. “Fitz killed that
story right off. He said it was five men.
Besides, he said you’d be the last man in
the world to touch a head of Bar 33 cattle.”
“Well, well,” Johnny drawled.

  Again Hugo looked at him sharply. He
said suddenly, impulsively, “What’s got
into you, Johnny? You’re changed.”

  A slow flush darkened Johnny’s lean
and browned cheeks. He cuffed his Stetson
back on his forehead. “Changed?”

   “Are you lettin’ this frame-up sour you,
boy?”

  “No,” Johnny said stubbornly. “Why?”
“Just a look in your eyes. Like you
don’t give a tinker’s curse any more.” He
paused, as if wondering how what he was
about to say would be received. “This is
none of my business, Johnny, but have
you had a row with Nora?”

  “Have you asked her?”

  Again Hugo shook his head. “No, but
she’s got the same look in her eyes that
you’ve got—a nothing-matters-now look.
Besides, when I asked her what you
planned to do after she saw you last night,
she didn’t say a word.” Hugo grinned dis-
armingly. “Maybe that’s all right, but I’ve
got an interest in your career too, boy.”
“Maybe you better ask her, Hugo. As
for me,” Johnny said slowly, “you know
how I feel about Nora—how I always will
feel. No, that hasn't changed.” He rose
and hiked up his levis. “Nothin’ new
about Pick’s claim?”

  Hugo only shook his head. At the door,
Johnny turned and said briefly, “It’ll be
some time before you see me again, Hugo.
Take care of Nora, will you?”

  And with that, he slipped out into the
night. Back at the horses, he said to Turk
and Johnny, “Fitz had a herd of beef
stole. Blue went out to take a look and
come back with the story that the herd
got clean away.”

  “Ain’t that too bad?” Turk murmured
sarcastically. “A jasper that couldn’t track
a ten-horse freight hitch across an alkali
flat could have followed that herd.”
KING COLT

121

Paused, Turk waited for Hank to say
something.

  Hank said only, “Well, don’t that prove
that Fitz wanted Leach Wigran to get
away with the stuff?”

  “So it would look to the town like the
hard-cases was fightin’ Fitz now,” Johnny
put in grimly. “That’s what he wants.
And”—here his voice took on a tone of
quiet savagery—“that’s what’s goin’ to
happen.”

  “Us bein’ the hard-cases,” Turk mur-
mured.

  “Right,” johnny said. “And when we
end up, Fitz won’t know whether he can
trust his own mother.”

CHAPTER XV

TRAIL DRIVE

JUST after dark two nights later,
Johnny was sitting in the dark door-
way of one of the Bar 33 line camps, smok-
ing. The night was quiet about him, the
only sounds were those his saddled pony
made cropping the grass out in the dark.
Johnny had been there an hour, during
which he had smoked eight cigarettes.
Lately, he had found himself restless and
impatient, and time and again he had to
put a check on his temper, which had
always been quick. Deep within him, he
knew why he was edgy, but he wouldn’t
admit it. Right now, he was fuming in-
wardly at Turk and Hank’s tardiness, for-
getting the fact that the Running W was
many miles from here, and that they
would have to be careful in covering their
movements.

  When he heard the sound of approach-
ing riders, he faded back into the doorway,
drawing his gun. Then Hank’s low and
cautious whistle came to him, and he
stepped out to meet them.

  “Get it?” he asked Hank.

  Turk answered instead. “Sure. And he’s
lame now. What luck did you have?”

  “They’re spread out below us right now,
without a man ridin’ herd.”

  “Then let’s get to work,” Hank said
briefly.

  It was a horse branded Running W that
Johnny had referred to. The three of them
mounted, hazed the extra horses and the
lame one ahead of them, and rode the short
distance down to the flat. Over the rolling,
tilting upland of grass, a big herd of Bar
33 cattle were grazing, some of them
bedded down.

  Out of this bunch they cut a hundred
and fifty head and then turned and pushed
east toward the mountains. The lame Run-
ning W gelding, along with the three other
ponies, was pushed in with the cattle.

  It was Turk giving orders now, for he
knew every one of these devious trails and
could pick out the few water holes they
would need on their way over the Calicos.
At dawn next morning, they paused to let
the herd drink at one of the high moun-
tain springs.

  Before they pushed on toward the pass
in the gaunt peaks, the gelding was cut
out and left behind. He seemed willing
to drop out, for he was limping badly.
Johnny reasoned that he would rest here
by the spring until hunger drove him down
on the flats.

  All that day they prodded the cattle
into the face of a gathering storm that
broke in mid-afternoon, half blinding them
with sleet and hail and rain. For an hour
they worked furiously to keep the cattle
headed up the mountains into the storm,
and just when the exhaustion of their
ponies was ready to defeat them, the rain
slacked off into a steady drizzle.

  His eyes red-rimmed and bloodshot,
Turk rode back to Johnny, who was riding
drag. Both of them were drenched, even
through their slickers, and the cold, driv-
ing wind that poured down from the peaks
had their lips blue.

  “It’ll be dark before we make the pass.
You want to try it?”

  “If we let these critters stop, dynamite
couldn’t keep ’em from goin’ back,” Johnny
said. He raised his eyes to the sky, which
seemed almost low enough to touch. They
were far above timberline now in the boul-
der fields of the peaks, and all nature here
seemed merciless, bent on breaking them.
122

ARGOSY

He shouted into the wind, “Can we do it,
Turk?”

  “Sure. You'll lose some of the stuff,
likely, and be pretty doggoned miserable,
but we can do it.”

   “All right. Let’s change ponies.”

  They took turns cutting fresh mounts
out and dropping back to saddle; the herd
was not allowed to stop.

AS night settled down on them, they
knew they were in for it. The rain
held on, increasing the misery of man and
beast. A dozen times that night, the cattle
were on the verge of stampeding. Every
time they rounded a fresh bend in this
tortuous trail and the wind drove at them
with the force of padded hammers, Johnny
and Hank were driven to a fury of ac-
tivity. Johnny never knew where they were
going, what the country looked like, or
if Turk was lost. It was his job and Hank’s
to keep the herd moving . . . and some-
how they did it.

  Toward morning, the wind died down
and the rain lifted a little, so that Johnny
almost drowsed off in the saddle. He could
tell by the ease with which his horse
walked and by the increased pace of the
cattle that they were through the pass and
on the gentle down-slope of the eastern side
of the Calicos.

  Dawn broke cold and clear, and in an-
other hour they reached timberline. Al-
ready behind them, the thunderheads were
gathering for a new downpour. When they
got to the green belt of trees, they conferred
and decided to rest the cattle and let them
graze on the hardy upland bunchgrass if
they could. Pursuit was hardly probable,
since a fresh storm would be almost cer-
tain to blot out the tracks.

   A half day of sleep and dry clothes lifted
their spirits. At noon, after a quick lunch,
they got the cattle moving again. Turk,
with the experience of many such drives
behind him, took them down the slope
through the thick timber until, when dark
fell, they were in the foothills.

  Warms, Turk said, was off several miles
to the right. They were heading for the

railway station and stock pens that Turk
had used in his rustling days. A crooked
agent, no brand inspector, and a split of
the rustled beef would allow them to dis-
pose of it without so much as a trace to
indicate where it had gone.

   Close to midnight, they saw the lights
of the way station. Turk had ridden ahead,
to confer with the agent. When Johnny and
Hank arrived with the beef, the pens were
open, ready to receive it.

   “There’ll be a train out of Warms to-
morrow morning,” Turk informed them.
“It’ll pick the stuff up.” He grinned up at
Johnny. “I signed Leach Wigran’s name
on the waybill. That all right?”

  Johnny nodded. Next morning, in the
mining town of Warms, Johnny opened an
account at the Warms bank in the name
of Leach Wigran. He arranged for the
deposit of the money from the sale of
the cattle shipment. If Fitz got curious
and searched for his herd, Leach Wigran’s
name would be dark with guilt.

  A few moments later he joined Hank
and Turk on the main four corners. They
looked at each other and smiled. They
each needed a shave, clean clothes, and
rest. Johnny, in spite of his bone-weari-
ness, felt something driving in him that
would not let him rest. His eyes were hard
and mocking, as he said to Turk, “You
work for what you get in this rustling
business, Turk. I didn’t know that.”

  “Where now?” Hank asked.

  “Cosmos. This has only begun.”

IN place of Barney, who had been
segundo under Carmody, Fitz had ap-
pointed a silent, surly puncher named Art
Bodan, who was years younger than he
looked. Fitz didn’t know much about him
except that Carmody said he was to be
trusted.

  So, that morning when Bodan had fin-
ished his story in Fitz’s office, the Major
regarded him with some curiosity and a
little suspicion.

  “You say you found the horse down on
the flat, grazing. How do you know he
was the one whose track you saw.”
KING COLT

123

  “I know,” Bodan said stubbornly. “Rain
or no rain. That’s the same horse. He’s not
only crippled in the same foot, but the
other tracks tally.” He paused, his dark,
smooth-shaven face sullen. “You can’t
track an animal for ten miles without you
learn somethin’ about his tracks, Major.”
Fitz said nothing for the moment, his
face scowling and unpleasant to look at.
“Running W. It couldn’t be a changed
brand, could it?”

  “Come out and look for yourself.”

  “I’ll do that,” Fitz said, and rose.
Outside, he paused at the corral while
Bodan cut out the lame gelding and led
him over to Fitz, turning him so that Fitz
could investigate the brand.

  “That’s real, all right/’ Fitz said. He
straightened up. “You’re not to say any-
thing about this, of course.”

  “Three of the men know it a’ready.”
“Saddle up my bay,” Fitz said, and
turned to the house.

  An hour later, he rode into the main
street of Cosmos and dismounted at Baily
Blue’s office. He did not need to cover up
his visits now, since it was known that,
as a victim of rustlers, he had legitimate
business with the sheriff. Blue was not in,
but Fitz sat down and smoked his pipe,
staring thoughtfully out the window.

  When Baily finally did come in, “Is
Leach in town?” Fitz asked. When Bailey
nodded Fitz said, “Bring him here.”

  Blue’s eyebrows lifted. “That ain’t very
cautious, Fitz.”

  “Bring him here. And do it in a hurry.”
Blue vanished; ten minutes later he was
back with the hulking Wigran in tow.
Leach Wigran seldom talked to the Major,
never recognized him in public, and that
Blue should call him to an open conference
with Fitz was a surprise to him. His face,
almost hidden by that thick shovel beard,
showed a surprise which he could not en-
tirely disguise.

  “Sit down,” Fitz said abruptly, when the
door was shut.

  Leach sat down facing him, holding his
hat in his hand. Blue leaned on the desk,
watchi ng.

  “This morning Bodan, my segundo,
came in with the news that I’ve been
rustled of a hundred and fifty head of
cattle. He cut for sign and found where
they’d been driven np the Calicos. The
rain had washed away the sign there, but
he saw enough to know that whoever stole
those cattle had a lame horse. That horse
was finally turned loose, up by a spring
in the Calicos, and it drifted down to my
range.” He leaned forward and regarded
Leach with careful eyes. “We found the
horse. It was branded Running W, Leach.”
Leach stopped fiddling with his hat, his
great hands still. “Running W?” he echoed.
“There’s some mistake. We’re missin’ no
horses.”

  “I saw it, and it’s branded Running W,”
Fitz said sharply.

  “Then somebody stole it.”

  “Where’ve you been these last four
nights?” Fitz asked him coldly.

  “Why—a couple of ’em I reckon I was
here in Cosmos.”

  “Your men were—where?”

  Slowly, Leach heaved himself to his feet
and regarded Fitz with hot eyes. “So you
think I took ’em, Fitz?”

  “I didn’t say so. I want to know who
did.”

  “I dunno. But I know I didn’t and none
of my men did. I can account for the whole

crew.”

  Fitz said nothing, and Leach, after hold-
ing his gaze for several seconds, turned to
Baily Blue, as if for help. Blue however,
kept his face carefully blank.

  And then Leach started to get red.
“Fitz,” he said hotly. “I’ve danced to your
tune for two years now. I’ve had many a
chance to hang the deadwood on you, but
I’ve not been a hog. I’ve kept in line and
taken your orders, and I aim to from now
on.”

  “Then where’d the horse come from?”
Fitz asked gently. “He was being ridden
by the men who took that beef.”

“I tell you he could have been stole!”
“By whom, then?” Fitz drawled. Now
his voice got ugly. “When I hired you,
Leach, you promised me that you’d keep
124

ARGOSY

these small rustlers in order, and have
them let me alone. Apparently”—and here
his voice was dry, thrusting—“you're los-
ing your ability to keep on top in this
county, Leach. Maybe somebody has an
idea that you’ve got a little soft, a little
easy. What do you think?”

  “I’d like to see ’em claim it!” Leach
said uglily.

  “What do you call this, then? They
stole a herd of my cattle and put the blame
on you. Either that, or your men think
you’re soft, too. Do they?”

  Leach took a shuffling step toward Fitz,
his face dark with anger. “They do what
I tell ’em!” he said thickly. “They aren’t
crossin’ me. They know it’d be worth their
life if they did.”

  “Then who is? These small time rustlers
you thought you could kick around?”

   “I still can!”

FITZ rose now. He came scarcely to
Leach’s shoulder, but there was a look
of hard and implacable command in his
eyes and on his face that told Blue that
Fitz was the stronger man, always had
been, always would be.

  “Leach,” Fitz said mildly, “I can’t use
a second-rater. I’ve made money for you,
and I'll make more. But not if you can’t
keep your men in line. If you’re through,
get out while you still have a chance. If
you aren’t licked, then straighten this out.
Get back my cattle for me and see that
the man responsible is punished.” He
paused. “And Leach, if you’re considering
stepping into my shoes, don’t. I’ve taken
care of a dozen like you in my day, and
it wasn’t any trouble—only a little messy.”
He stepped past Leach and out the door,
closing it gently behind him. For a long
minute, Leach stood in the middle of the
floor, clenching and unclenching his fists,
his face hard and savage and entirely
readable.

  Blue shifted his weight on the desk and
cleared his throat.

  “Don’t get any ideas, Leach,” he said
softly.

  Leach looked at him, now, and there

was bewilderment in his eyes. “But I ain’t.
I know when I’m well off. But I don’t
have any idea who took them cattle, not

a one.”

  “Find out.”

  “I aim to.”

  Blue smiled faintly. “But don’t ever get
any ideas about Fitz, Leach. He goes with
good people here. His credit is good, he’s
polite, the decent women like him, and
he acts considerable like a dude sometimes.
But don’t let that fool you.” He jerked
a thumb over his shoulder. “Out there at
the Bar 33, he hasn’t got what you'd
rightly call a crew of punchers. Once, just
for fun, I added up how much reward
money I’d collect if I’d take that Bar 33
crew, nail ’em up in a boxcar and ship ’em
back to where they were wanted. The re-
ward money came to over a hundred thou-
sand dollars.”

  Leach was listening, his eyes veiled.
“Fitz sends for them. He gives them
protection, work, and good wages, until
things have cooled off for them. Nobody
knows their right names except him—and
sometimes me. They ain’t common gun-
fighters Leach—they’re killers. Tested,
wanted, gunslick, hair-trigger killers. So
don’t get any ideas. And if I was you,
I’d see that them cattle was back at the
Bar 33 in pretty short order.”

  “I will.”

  When Leach stepped out onto the street,
he was considerably chastened—and he
was angry, too. He knew that what Baily
Blue told him about Fitz was true. With-
out ever raising his voice, Fitz could put
more genuine fear into Leach than an army
of ordinary men with guns.

  Leach went into the bar at Prince’s Keno
Parlor and downed a stiff drink. Then he
walked to the gambling tables, where four
of his men were playing an idle hand ol
poker.

  “Come along,” he told them.

  One puncher, young, tall, with several
days’ growth of reddish stubble on his face,
threw down his cards and looked up at
Leach. “More work?”

  Leach nodded grimly. “Plenty, Mick.”
KING COLT

CHAPTER XVI

rustlers’ war

ONCE on the road to the Running W,
Leach motioned Mickey Hogan to
drop behind the other two. Mickey was
Leach’s foreman, his top hand and gun-
fighter. It was Mickey who enabled Leach
to keep peace among his twenty hands—
saddle-bums and saloon riffraff.

  “How much time did Fitz give us?”
Mickey asked when Leach had finished.
“He never said.”

  “I'll need a couple of days, anyway.
You got any ideas?”

  “Well, there’s them Winkler brothers
up in that old Ophir mine. They’re a tough
crew, and they don’t like us much.”

  Mickey shook his head. “Maybe not, but
they’re plumb scared of us. They’re out.”
Leach named a list of men known as
rustlers, but at each name, Mickey shook
his head. Nevertheless, when they reached
the Running W, Mickey took only the time
to change horses before he rode off with
five of his men. For Leach, the rest of that
day and the next was intolerable. The
longer Mickey stayed away, the more cer-
tain Leach grew that he was having no luck
in tracking down the rustlers.

  And that was true in the beginning.
Mickey’s first visit was to the Winkler boys
up in the old abandoned Ophir mine. They
were insolent, but they offered an alibi
which Mickey had to accept; three of them
were down sick. With their blankets pulled
around them, rifles slacked in their arms,
they stood in the doorway and faced
Mickey and his five riders.

  “All right,” Mickey said. “I reckon
you’re tellin’ the truth. But if I thought
you wasn’t . . .”

  “You’d blow our heads off,” Winkler
said. “Well, ride on, Hogan. You’ve come
to the wrong place. When we steal any-
thing you want, we’ll admit it and be ready
to scrap for it. You can tell that to your
boss.”

  “I believe you,” Mickey said mildly, and
wheeled his horse out.

  So Mickey made the rounds. On the aft-
ernoon of the second day he and his riders
pulled up at Cass Brigg’s place in the bot-
tomlands of a creek over on the west edge
of the county.

  Cass was drunk and belligerent. “Steal
Fitz’s stuff?” he said thickly. “Why, why
shouldn’t a man? His beef will walk just
as good as another man’s, won’t it?”
Mickey regarded him thoughtfully.
“Take a pasear around the corrals, boys,”
he said to his men.

  Cass straightened up. “Wait a minute,”
he said loudly. “You’ll find tracks over
there, but no beef. I had five head here
until last night.”

  “Whose beef?”

  “Kennicott’s,” Cass answered sullenly.
  Mickey said, “Look around, boys.”

WHILE they were gone, Mickey
watched Cass, whose increasingly
furtive air he could not quite understand.
Mickey, in the course of his business, was
pretty well acquainted with these shifty,
close-mouthed men who practiced on a
small scale what Leach Wigran did on a
large one. He knew their hideout, their
markets, their methods, their needs and
their characters. It was another world re-
mote from the brisk and businesslike air
of Cosmos, but one in which Mickey was
thoroughly versed.

  The Running W riders returned.
“There’s been cattle out there all right.”
“How many?”

  “I dunno.”

  Mickey returned his attention to Cass.
“I haven’t seen you in town much lately,
Cass.”

  “I been here.”

  “You couldn’t have been somewhere else
—say over on Bar 33 range—with George
Winkler, could you?”

   “I tell you, I been here,” Cass said irri-
tably.

  “Or over the Calicos in Warms,” Mickey
went on idly. “Maybe these bad rains up
in the Calicos is what stove up those
Winkler boys.” Mickey was talking idly,
hit or miss, giving little attention to what
126

ARGOSY

he said. But he saw now that something
he had said had touched Cass. Cass tried
to look him in the eye, but failed.

   “I was here,” Cass said sullenly.

  “But with the Winkler boys, though.”
Cass spat. “All right, what if they was
over?”

  “So they were?”

  Cass straightened up defiantly. “Any-
thing wrong with asking your friends over
to have a few drinks?” When Mickey said
nothing, he added, “They got drunk and
slept outside. I couldn’t help that, could
I?”

  Mickey didn’t answer immediately.
Presently, he said, “That’s funny, Cass,
that you five should have been together
just for a parley.” He paused. “So you did
drive the beef over to Warms?”

  “We did not!” Cass said hotly. “I sold
’em my share for the price of a couple of
bottles.”

  Mickey said quickly, “Your share of
what beef?”

   “Kennicott’s.”

  “I thought you said you only got five
head.”

  “That was my share, I said. We worked
it together.”

  “I hadn’t heard anything about it in
town,” Mickey said gently. “Usually Ken-
nicott squawks the loudest”

  “He don't know it,” Cass mumbled.
Mickey let his hand fall to his gun.
“Cass,” he said gently, “you’re lyin’.
What did you do with that Bar 33 beef?
Drive it over to Warms?”

  “I dunno what you’re talkin’ about,”
Cass said earnestly. “Don’t get so quick,
Mickey. Come in and have a drink. I tell
you, it wasn’t no Bar 33 beef. I dunno
whose it was. I was drunk, and so was
they. We just took it from over west of
town and drove it down here in the breaks,
and then we come home and we was drunk
for a couple of days. I sold ’em my share.”
Mickey drew his gun, raised it. “Cass,
you and the Winklers took that Bar 33
beef. None of you’ve been around Cosmos
for a week now. The Winkler boys are
stove up from that mountain rain. No-

body’s missin’ beef except Fitz. Are you
goin’ to tell me you stole it?”

  “I didn’t!” Cass cried.

  Mickey smiled and leveled his gun. Cass
made a lunge to get inside the house, but
Mickey’s gun roared before Cass could
make a move.

SLOWLY, Cass started to claw at his
chest and then he sat down abruptly,
and his head sagged down on his chest.

  Mickey regarded him coldly. “I never
thought he’d have the nerve,” he said
mildly. He shrugged. “Well, the beef’s
gone. Let’s go back to the Winklers.”

  It was midnight before Mickey rode into
the Running W. He and his riders had a
little trouble with the Winklers, had had
to burn them out, which took a little time.
However, Mickey had a feeling of a job
well done as he lifted his saddle on the
corral poles and walked toward the house.

  The front room of the Running W was
bare and cluttered with gear and filthy
with dust and papers. At Mickey’s en-
trance, Leach jumped to his feet, his hand
traveling toward his gun. By the light of
the single lamp Leach looked deathly pale.

  Mickey, puzzled, closed the door behind
him. “What’s the matter, Leach? You’re
spooky.”

  Leach regarded him with red-rimmed,
bloodshot eyes. “An hour after you left,
one of the boys rode in with word that
the herd of beef we was holdin’ for Fitz
is stole too.”

  Mickey said softly, “Stole?”

  “Drove over the Calicos. I been out
trackin’ it. But it was took to Warms, sure
as hell.”

  “How long had it been gone?”

  “A couple of days.”

  Mickey sank into a chair, and he and
Leach looked at each other. “Then I
must’ve made a mistake,” Mickey said
quietly, and he told Leach about Cass and
the Winklers. Leach didn’t even show in-
terest. He sat there, his head sunk on his
chest, staring at the table. Presently, he
said, “Mickey, I can make this good with
Fitz. I mean I got the money to do it,
KING COLT

127

but”—and he raised harried eyes to re-
gard Mickey—“what am I goin’ to tell
him? That they’ve got us on the run?”

 “Who?”

  “I wish I knew,” Leach said savagely.
“Fitz ain’t pleasant to face. This time, he’s
going to be wild.”

  Mickey thought a long moment. “Tell
him you found Cass and the Winkler boys
with the beef high up in the Calicos. You
took care of them, all right, and then you
got to thinkin’ and you decided to drive
the stuff over to Warms—all of it, so long
as you was close as you was. Then give
him the money. What can he say?”
“He’ll know I’m lyin’.”

  “He’d never know I was lyin’,” Mickey
said quietly.

  Leach seemed not to hear this for sev-
eral moments, and then he raised his head
with a jerk. “That’s it, Mickey! You tell
him. Can you do it?”

  “I never seen the lie I couldn’t tell with
a straight face,” Mickey boasted quietly.
“Sure I'll tell him.”

  “Right now. You ride over right now.”
“Wait till tomorrow,” Mickey drawled.
“That’ll give us time enough to have drove
the beef over and come back.”

  Mickey started out at sunup for the Bar
33. At dark, he was not back. He did not
return that night, nor the next day. At
midnight, he was still not back. Leach, his
eyes frantic, paced up and down the room,
listening occasionally.

  Some time that night, as Leach lay on
the rough and soiled sofa, staring at the
ceiling, a thunderous knock on the door
brought him to his feet with a leap, gun
out.

  He waited a moment, and then crossed
to the door, listening, his hand on the knob.
Then, gathering himself he yanked the
door open.

  Something was standing there on the
sill. Instinctively, protectively, wildly,
Leach fired, but the body did not move.
It simply toppled into the room at Leach’s
feet.

  Leach looked down at it. It was Mickey.
He was dead and stiff. On his chest was

pinned a note and stooping slowly, Leach
read it.

This was a mistake, Leach. Get that

  beef back or get out.

  And Leach, trembling there in the gut-
tering flame of the lamp, knew that war
was declared, and he was afraid.

CHAPTER XVII

GUNFIRE BY NIGHT

WHEN Tip Rogers wakened and
struck a match to look at his watch,
it was seven o’clock. He knew that if he
was to get down to the dining room and
eat supper before it closed, he would have
to hurry with his shave. Two days and one
night in the saddle heading a posse had
left him stiff and sore, but he was refreshed
after fourteen hours of sleep.

  Down in the lobby and heading for the
dining room, he thought of Nora inside,
and his face settled into gravity. He knew
that she must hate him now for the stand
he had taken against Johnny, and he hated
it too, but the honesty in him would not
let him do otherwise.

  The dining room was almost empty.
Major Fitz and Bledsoe were seated at a
side table in the corner, and Major Fitz’s
harsh and dogmatic voice could be heard
the length of the dining room.

  Tip took a table and Nora, who had
been standing listening to Major Fitz, came
over to take his order. Surprisingly, she
smiled at him, and Tip smiled warmly in
return. “Too late to get anything to eat,
Nora?”

  Nora shook her head. “No, I had the
cook save something for you, Tip.
Hungry?”

  “Watch me.”

  When she returned with his food and
sat down opposite him, he observed her
carefully. She was a little pale, but her
eyes looked bright, almost feverish, and her
talk and even her actions were animated.
Tip made a vow that he would not bring
into the conversation any mention of
128

ARGOSY

things that might upset her, such as his
activities of the last few days.

  Nora, however, spoiled this resolution
with her first question.

  “Did you have any luck with the posse,
Tip?” she asked.

  Tip looked up at her, his face coloring.
“Of course not. If I had, I’d have brought
them in.”

  “Not shot them?”

  Tip shook his head. “Why should I? I
liked Johnny Hendry. Maybe he didn't do
what he was accused of, but he’ll never
prove his innocence by running away.”
There was a quizzically probing expres-
sion in her eyes. She said:

  “You’d have brought him back to stand
trial then—for his own good.”

  Tip grinned and shook his head. “No,
I’ll be honest. Not for his good, but for
mine. I won’t pass up a chance to find out
who robbed the bank and got the gold.”
Nora didn’t answer for a moment, and
then she said quietly, “Perhaps that’s what
he needs, Tip. Somebody ought to scare
him, to make him prove his innocence, even
if he didn’t take the gold.”

  Tip laid down a fork and stared at her,
as if he had not heard rightly. Nora
laughed a little self-consciously and said,
“Why not? Johnny treats other people that
way. Why should he expect more in re-
turn?”

  Her voice shook a little with anger,
but Tip was too much in love to see
that Nora's displeasure with Johnny
Hendry was dictated by her mind.
It was something she felt—and tried
to feel—because she thought she
should.

  “Treats them how?”

  “Oh, he makes snap judgments, believes
the worst of people. He’s unfair and un-
just.”

  “You think that’s the kind of treatment
I’ve given him?”

  Nora nodded and said, “A little. But I
can’t blame you, Tip. You're only doing
your job.”

   “And one I don’t like,” Tip said quietly.
Nora did not answer. Tip ate in silence,

frowning at his plate. Suddenly, he raised
his eyes to Nora’s face. “Believe me, Nora,
I don’t like this. I know how you feel about
Johnny, and I could understand why you’d
hate me for what I’m doing.”

  “How do I feel about Johnny?” Nora
asked bluntly, looking him in the eye.

  “Why—why—I’ve been seeing you for
over a year, Nora, even since I came here
—when I ask you to marry me, you just
laugh. And you’ve been just as nice, even
nicer, to Johnny Hendry. But when he
walks in the room, you’re different. He’s
the one. My name could be Ted or Jim
or Bob and you’d treat me the same. Don’t
you see? I may be one in a hundred but
Johnny is one in a million—to you. Maybe
he always will be.”

  All the while Tip was speaking, the flush
on Nora’s face was deepening. When he
was finished, Nora said swiftly, “Tip, that’s
not true! You’ve been imagining it! I—I
don’t love Johnny Hendry. Maybe for a
while I was infatuated with him, but I
don’t love him! And I’ve tried to treat
you both the same—because I really do
feel the same about you!”

  Her eyes blazed.

  Tip’s mouth sagged open, and he could
not speak for a moment.

  “I know but—”

  “And that’s not because Johnny is in
trouble!” Nora said defiantly. “I’m just
as loyal to him as I ever was, Tip! I’ve
talked to him since he was framed! If I
wanted to, I could take you to his hideout!
But I won’t! So you see, I’m not desert-
ing him in his hard luck. Only, I don’t
want you or anybody else, Tip Rogers, to
think I love him. I don’t!”

WISELY, Tip held his silence, but he
allowed himself a broad grin, and as
Nora watched him, the fire died out in
her eyes and she began to smile. Suddenly,
they both laughed together.

  “Finish your eating, Tip,” Nora said,
“I’m almost ashamed of myself.”

  Tip lifted his plate off to one side and
leaned both hands on the table, and he
began to speak in utter seriousness.

  “Today, Nora, when I got in from the
mountains, I went up to the Esmerella.
Sammons, the manager had some news for
me.” He paused, watching her. “He said
the Esmerella will have to close. I’m out
of a job. He offered me one with the same
company down near the Mexican border.
I’m not going.”

  “But Tip, why not?”

  “Because I found out something tonight.
If you like me as well as you do Johnny
Hendry, then I’m going to stay here until
you like me better. And the only time I’ll
take that job down there is when I can
write the manager and tell him that he’ll
have to provide quarters for a new superin-
tendent—and wife. Her name will be
Nora.”

  Nora smiled shyly. “You’re nice, Tip.”
  “Nora, will you marry me?”

  “I—I don’t know, Tip,” Nora said.
‘Everything has happened so quickly. Tip,
give me time. Please.”

  Tip reached out for her hand and spread
her fingers out in his palm. On his own
little finger was a ring, its band of silver,
its stone of deep blue turquoise. He took
it off and slipped it quickly on her middle
finger.

  Tip said gently, “The Indian who gave
that to me, Nora, told me that as soon as
my greatest luck had come, to pass the
ring on to somebody else I wished luck
for. If you take it my luck has come. Will
you wear it?”

  His hand relinquished hers, as if he
didn’t want to put the slightest pressure
on her.

  Slowly, Nora raised her eyes to his. “Is

this an engagement ring, Tip?”

  “It’s for you to name,” Tip said gravely.
“1 want it to be that.”

  Nora looked down at the ring. It was
beautiful, its stone cool and smooth and
deep, but she was thinking of what this
ring symbolized, what she could make it
symbolize—a new life with a man she
liked, a man who was steady and honest
and patient, whom she could depend on,
who would not change over the years, who,
while he would not make her laugh and
9 A—24

cry and be angry with him, would be as
predictable as a calendar, as steady as
the sun in its course. It would be refuge
and security, something she sorely needed
and wanted now. But did she love him?
She looked up at his face, and saw Tip’s
quiet love for her shining out of eyes that
were honest and very grave. For a mo-
ment, she remembered Johnny’s eyes, care-
less,- mocking, affectionate, light-hearted,
quick as mercury—

  “Let’s call it an engagement Tip4” she
said softly, stubbornly, and she hardly
realized she had said it until she felt Tip’s
kiss on her lips. She laughed then, and
pushed Tip back in his seat.

  “Your supper is cold, and you’ve got
to eat, Tip,” she told him, but Tip was
only looking at her, filling his eyes with
the beauty of her. Nora rose and went out
into the kitchen.

WHILE she was gone, a man entered
the dining room and looked around
him, waved to Tip, and went over to Fitz
and Bledsoe’s table. It was Les Mac-
Mahon, a tall slim young man in careful
black clothes who studied law at nights
and waited on customers at Bledsoe’s store
in the daytime. Tip was friendly with him,
and liked him. MacMahon talked quietly
with Fitz and Bledsoe for some minutes,
and Nora returned with hot food for Tip.
She sat down by him again and made
Tip eat.

  Presently, MacMahon left Bledsoe’s
table and came over to speak to Tip and
Nora. “Is it true the Esmerella has closed
down, Tip?” he asked. His sharp face was
inquisitive, amiable. Tip nodded. “What
are you going to do, leave town?”

  Tip looked at Nora and smiled slightly.
“No chance. I’ll do something around
here.”

  MacMahon leaned down and talked
quietly. “I just had a funny experience,
Tip. Six men—I don't know who they were
—came in the store and started buying
supplies—mining tools, blankets, grub,
black powder and such. One of them, the
man doing the buying, was drunk. He
130

ARGOSY

started talking to me about their claims,
said they were the richest he’d ever seen.
He told me quite a bit about them before
the boss came over and shut him up.”
Tip leaned forward, his eyes intent and
excited.

  “Did he say where they were?”
MacMahon flushed. “I know this sounds
silly, Tip, but to begin with, they bought
about a thousand dollars worth of sup-
plies. This drunk was bragging around that
their assay showed higher than any mine
that was being operated around here. I
thought it was bluff, but when they’d gone
out, I went over to the claim-recording
office. Sure enough, six men had just filed
claims together there. Furthermore, they
just bought a dozen pack mules from Mc-
Grew down at the feed stable. Does that
sound like it’s a bluff? They paid cash for
everything.”

  “It doesn’t,” Tip conceded. “Were they
mining men?”

  “Looked it.”

  “W?hat do you want me to do?” Tip
asked, interested now.

  “You’re free now. You know minerals.
Get their locations at the recorder’s office
and go out and if it looks good, file on
some claims. I just told Bledsoe and Fitz.
They said if I could get a good man to
look it over, to put their names down. I’ll
want one too.” He indicated Nora. “So
will Nora, won’t you?”

  “Whatever Tip thinks,” Nora answered.
Tip scowled. He had been around min-
ing camps long enough to understand that
fabulous mines had been discovered on just
such thin rumors. A drunken boast, an in-
cautious poker bet, a brag on a street
corner had been the start of many a pay-
ing mine. He was free now with no job to
hold him in town. Besides that, he hoped
he wrould soon have a wife to support and
it had been Tip’s dream that some day he
would own a small paying mine. Perhaps
this was the chance he had been waiting
for.

  “I’ll do it,” he said slowly, “only don’t
be disappointed when I come back and
tell you it’s phoney.”

  MacMahon drew up a chair and soon
they were deep in mining talk. MacMahon
had copied out the claim locations, and
now he gave them to Tip. They discussed
Tip’s outfit, his expenses and such, and
while they talked, Nora listened, content
only to watch Tip. She liked his quiet
gravity, the slow and careful way that he
arrived at decisions, the temperance of his
speech, and the dry humor that crept into
much he said. And she knew too that he
would never change, that this was the way
he was made, and the way he would always
be. Moreover, she knew deep within her,
that if her life with him would be dull at
times it would be a generous life, with re-
wards and riches at the end.

  Bledsoe and Fitz came over, and Nora
rose and went about her business of clear-
ing off the dishes. Later, when she returned
to the dining room, Tip was at the door,
waiting for her. He drew her out into the
dark lobby and said, “How does it sound,
darling?”

  “I don’t know, Tip. WTiat do you
think?”

  “I think I’d be willing to gamble any-
thing to get money and presents and things
to give you,” Tip said quietly.

  Nora squeezed his hand. “Not for that
alone, Tip. You want to get ahead. You
always would. Why don’t you take a
chance?”

  “I am.” He folded her in his arms and
kissed her, and it was so strange that Nora
almost protested, then smiled, and Tip
vanished up the stairs. Back in the dining
room, MacMahon and Bledsoe were taking
leave of Fitz. They were going to go down
to the store to assemble Tip’s outfit.

MAJOR FITZ beckoned to Nora and
she came back to the table. “Sit
down,” he said. “I want to talk to you. . . .
Have I been drinking too much, or did
I see that young scalawag kiss you. Nora?”
“You did,” Nora admitted, blushing. “I
like him, Major Fitz.”

  “Hmm. So do I. But I don’t kiss him.”
  “I mean I like him awfully well.”
  “Better than Johnny?”
KING COLT

131

  Nora looked him steadily in the eye.
“Better than Johnny,” she said quietly.
“It's—it’s just that Tip is steadier and
more considerate than Johnny.”

  “Remember, Johnny was an orphan,
raised in a rough town and with rough
people, Nora,” Fitz pointed out gently.

  Nora patted his hand. She could not help
but compare Major Fitz’s tolerance and
justice to Johnny’s hot-headedness and his
quick anger. Here while Johnny was hunt-
ing ways to prove Major Fitz a crook,
Fitz was pleading Johnny’s case with her,
and a deep wave of bitterness passed
through her. Whatever doubts she had had
as to preferring Tip to Johnny—and they
were few and dim, she thought—were van-
ished now. She felt anger toward Johnny,
and pity and quiet affection for this loyal
man across from her.

  “I understand all that, Major Fitz, but
it isn’t as if I liked a man for his man-
ners or for his polish.”

  “I know that. You like me,” Fitz said,
and smiled a little, “and I’m just a rough-
neck.”

  “And I was raised on a ranch,” Nora
said. “Maybe I wouldn’t know good man-
ners if I saw them.”

  “Nonsense. You’re a lady because you
can’t help it.”

  Nora squeezed his hand, and there were
almost tears in her eyes. “Don’t be hard on
me, old friend. I'm just trying to do what
I think is best.”

  “I know you are. They are both fine
boys.” He shook his head slowly. “I
wouldn’t undertake to say which you’d
be the happiest with Nora—if you can be
happy with any of us men. Tip is steady,
maybe a little bit dull. And Johnny is wild
and a hellion, but more to my taste. But
you’re the one that’s choosing. You stick
to what you like and you—”

  Fitz stopped speaking, and his eyes
shuttled quickly to the lamp overhead. It’s
flame was guttering, as if a sudden draft
had struck it.

  And then, explosively, Major Fitz
shoved hard on the table, so that it

slammed against Nora and carried her over
backwards to the floor. He dodged aside,
snaking out of the chair, just as the blast
of a shotgun filled the room with terrible
noise.

  Major Fitz, lying on the floor, whipped
a hand to his shoulder holster, flicked out
his gun and in one snap shot at the lamp
overhead plunged the room in darkness.

  Then, on his knees, he swiveled his gun
to one of the back windows and emptied it
in thundering peroration, filling the room
with the savage hammering of his gun-
fire.

  When the gun was empty, he paused,
and waited. There was no movement, not
a sound from that partially opened win-
dow.

  Fitz pulled himself slowly to his feet.
His knees were shaky and he was
angry at himself for the sickness deep
in his belly that he recognized as
fear.

  “Nora!” Fitz whispered. “Are you
hurt?”

  “I’m all right,” Nora said weakly. “WThat
happened?”

  Fitz walked over to her and lifted her
to her feet in the darkness. “If they’d hit
you, I’d never have forgiven myself.”

  “But who was it?”

  “I don’t know,” Fitz answered simply.
“Evidently, I have my enemies, like every
other man.”

  The dining room door opened and the
clerk came running in with a lamp. By its
light, Fitz looked at the table. Its cloth
was tattered, its top channeled with the
blast of buckshot. And the lines it had
drilled in the table top told their own story.
By shoving the table against Nora, and up-
setting her, Fitz had saved her from taking
the full charge of the buckshot in her body.

  She looked at him, her eyes still wild
with fright, and he folded her in his arms,
trying to quiet her hysterical sobs while
the clerk looked on in bewildered silence.

  And looking at that scarred table top,
Major Fitz knew that Leach Wigran had
taken up the gauntlet.

TO BE CONTINUED NEXT WEEK
 Sea-Goin
Samaritan

By

     KENNETH L.
      SINCLAIR

THE weather was thickening
fast. Skookum bad news,
that, to any Bristol Bay
skipper. But to “Kindly” Ken-
nard’s way of thinking, even a
williwaw was only a minor irrita-
tion when stacked up against the
presence of the Togiak’s owner
aboard.

  In the estimation of many a
seagoin’ man, an owner is a
sort of two-legged monster who
crouches in a warm office some-
where ashore, navigates a swivel chair with
the greatest of skill, and pours endless
clouds of cigar smoke from his funnel. An
ideal owner is one seldom seen, and even
less often heard.

  But Oscar Pattler was far from being an
ideal owner. Pudgy, pompous, he kept
thrusting his sharp little jib into matters
that were none of his proper business. And
as any Alaska man knows, a Bristol Bay
skipper has a tough enough proposition on
his hands without having owner trouble
added to his worries. On these treacherous,
shoaling shores lie the bleaching bones of
many a fine ship—and many a seagoing
man’s career.

  Right now, though, in spite of the howl-
ing gale, Pattler was coming up the iron
ladder to the tug’s little bridge. He barged
into the wheelhouse, without so much as
a by-your-leave.

  “Kennard! What do you think you’re
doin’ now?” the little owner shrilled, shak-
ing the sea’s honest spray from his coat.

“Why’d you slack speed and swing off
your course?”

  Calmly, the skipper put the helm over
a bit more, peered through the rain-swept
windows as the Togiak swung. “Some-
body’s piled up on that shoal off Cape
Chichagof/’ he stated. “He’s making dis-
tress signals—hear that foghorn?”

  Pattler snorted. “You’ve cost me enough,
with your yen for rescuing people! This is
a tugboat business—and from now on
you’re letting the Coast Guard take care
of those fools that get themselves into
trouble.” The sharp-nosed owner squinted
through the windows. “That’s a tugboat!”
he yelled. “Must be Burkun, man!”
Kennard grinned, nodded. “Yeah. It’s
his boat.”

   Pattler lifted himself on tiptoe and yelled
up at the lank, calm master. “Now you
listen, Kennard! I’ve stood enough! You’ve
lost time and money by chasing into the
craziest places, risked my vessel and my
business to pull blundering fools off the
SEA-GOIN’ SAMARITAN

133

rocks. You’ve wasted my oil—you went
out to Seal Island in a howling williwaw,
to pick up a flyer who landed in the water.
You yanked a Fisheries Department boat
off Protection Point last fall in ice that
strained the Togiak’s frames so bad that I
had to send you clear down to Ketchikan
to have her hauled out and repaired.
You’ve pulled so many rescues that they’re
callin’ you the Seagoin’ Samaritan. An’ I'm
tellin’ you right now—orderin’ you—to let
Burkan set! He got himself into this—”
“It happens to be the law of the sea, to
help those in distress,” Kennard stated
pointedly. “Competitors not excepted.”
Pattler bristled. “I’m the owner of this
boat, and I’m ordering you to take no
more chances with her! Right now we got
a tow waiting, for us at Egegik, and we’re
goin’ in after it on this high tide. You’ll
do as I tell you, or I’ll put you on the
beach without a job so quick you’ll wonder
what hit you!”

   “I’m the master of this vessel/’ Kennard
stated. “At sea, I’m the boss. Burkun’s
broadside-to on that shoal. In this blow
that’s making, he’ll pound to pieces in a
few hours. So I’m going after him. Now,
if you’ll get off my bridge, Mr. Pattler . .

  Pattler’s sharp little jaw sagged. He
pulled a noisy breath between his teeth,
rose on the balls of his feet to yell an an-
swer; and then suddenly closed his mouth
with a click and backed out of the wheel-
house. Kennard was calm and kindly in
manner—but years of battling the sea in
treacherous Aleutian waters, and in equally
dangerous Bristol Bay, had given him hard-
ness and force.

KENNARD eased the Togiak carefully
toward the shoal. Now, as he came
nearer to it, he could see that Burkun’s red
Bacharoj was rolling heavily under the im-
pacts of the howling combers which were
going right over her. A man was clinging
to the stricken tug’s bridge, frantically
waving what seemed to be a red undershirt.
From the giant build of him, the man
would be “Blaze” Burkun himself. And
Kennard’s lips moved in a grin.

  Burkun on the shoal! Burkun, the up-
start who had given boasting, unwanted
advice to almost every skipper on the Bay.
Burkun, who freely admitted that after
four months’ experience, he knew every-
thing there was to know about these waters.

  For Kennard, there was a smile in this.
But there was some mighty ticklish work
ahead, too. He knew these waters as well as
he knew' the back of his own right hand—
knew just how close he could approach this
shoal in safety. But in this thick weather,
he couldn’t see Cape Chichagof and so he
had no guide to his position. None, that is,
except Burkun’s squat red tugboat, which
naturally showed the location of the shoal
upon which it was grounded.

  True enough, Kennard had charts and
the usual pilot books. And he knew just
how reticent they were in describing this
shoal. The pilot book had it this way: “A
dangerous obstruction is reported to exist
about four miles off Cape Chichagof.”
Nothing more than that. And Chart 8802
confined itself to an indefinite “X,” fol-
lowed by one of those Position Doubtful
notations that many a seaman has had rea-
son to curse.

  No help there. Nothing to do but depend
upon the Becharof for a marker, approach
as closely as possible, then come about and
try to hold position and float a line down-
wind to Burkun. It was quite possible that,
before the tide fell, the Togiak’s powerful
Diesels could pull Burkun off the sandy
shoal.

  Kennard rang the engineer, Vince Waldo,
for full speed and got set to bring the tug
about. And then, with the smoke of her
engines flung low over her stubby bows by
the gale, the Togiak struck.

   Turning as she struck, the tug heeled far
over to port. The sand laid hold of her keel
and brought her to a wrenching, groaning
stop. Pattler, on the foredeck, went asprawl
and rolled into the scuppers and when he
bounded back to his feet he was yelling
like mad.

  Kennard rang Full Astern, He got it
promptly—but it was no use. With her own
speed and the thrust of the storm to drive
134

ARGOSY

her onto the shoal, the Togiak was hung
up for sure—and on a falling tide, at that.

  With a cold gleam in his eyes, Kennard
flipped the engine-room telegraph to Fin-
ished With Engines, lashed the wheel to
keep the rudder from banging itself loose,
and went out onto the little bridge.

  Blaze Burkun’s huge figure was plain to
be seen, now, on the Becharoj’s bridge. The
man’s red thatch was being whipped by the
gale, and he was grinning with triumph.
The Becharoj’s foghorn was stopped
now; and Burkun’s stentorian yell rose
above the hollow crashing of the breaking
seas.

  “What’s the matter, Samaritan? I
thought you knowed these waters? How
come you grounded?”

  “Scum!” Kennard retorted. “What’s the
idea of faking distress?”

  “Why, whaddayuh mean?” Burkun
yelled, innocently. “Wre jus’ dropped the
hooks for a little rest, that’s all! No law
against that! We anchored fore-an’-aft,
because we’re tough babies an’ like tuh roll.
Our foghorn stuck—maybe we’ll fix it, at
Egegik. An’ I was shakin’ my laundry out
in the wind. Can’t hang a man for that,
can yuh?” Burkun pulled his greasy sea
cap over his touseled red hair, tilted it to
a cocky angle, and grinned wickedly.

  “Well,” he went on “we gotta be goin’
now, Kennard. I guess you won’t be able
to handle that cannery tow now that you’re
roostin’ on the shoal. We’ll jus’ sort of
pinch-hit for yuh! ”

  A couple of Burkun’s men started the
fore and aft winches and lifted the hooks
which had held the Becharoj in position
behind the shoal. Smoke spurted from the
craft’s rust-eaten funnel. Burkun let loose
a series of derisive toots with his whistle,
as he swung away and headed toward
Egegik.

VINCE WALDO came out of his en-
gine-room just as Kennard reached the
deck. Waldo was a frail-looking, precise
man, addicted to stiff white collars and a
scholarly manner. Not a man made to the
mold of an engineer a good many would

say—and right there they’d be wrong.
Waldo kept his Diesels .unning like jeweled
watches and his engine-room was cleaner
than most galleys.

  “We’re on Chichagof Shoal,” Kennard
informed him.

  Then Pattler elbowed Waldo aside.
“Why didn’t you look where you were go-
ing?” the owner demanded with a lands-
man’s disregard of the simple facts of
seamanship. “Why didn’t you look down
into the water—see how deep it was? Why
didn’t you take soundings? Why couldn’t
you tell by the breakers that—”

  “Burkun put one over on me,” Kennard
admitted. “As dirty a trick as I ever heard
of, too. I took it for granted that he was
on the shoal—broadside-to as he was, he
sure made the thing look real. I didn’t think
that with Burkun’s tub marking the shoal
for us there was any need for the lead—
and short-handed as you keep us, there was
nobody aboard to use it anyway. And this
water is so murky with volcanic ash that
you can’t see a foot down. And if you’ll
take a look around you’ll see that in this
shallow water the breakers extend for miles.
Satisfied?”

  “Satisfied!” Pattler yelled. “With my
boat aground and Burkun going in to
Egegik to grab our tow— Satisfied! Bur-
kun put it over on you, all right! All he
had to do was play on your fool yen for
rescuing people. If we ever get outta this
I’m goin’ straight to the marshal at Pawik.
I’ll see Burkun behind bars, before I’m
through with him!”

  “Not likely, mister” Kennard stated.
“Burkun’s lied himself out of worse deals
than this one. And he’s got a crew of ac-
complished liars with him on that tub, to
back his yarn.”

   That put Pattler back a notch. For a mo-
ment his sharp-fronted mouth kept open-
ing and closing, like that of a fish out of
water. Kennard could well understand
Pattler’s rage. For years, Pattler had en-
joyed a monopoly in the towboat business
on the Bay. But now Burkun had horned in
—and, with both his pride and his profits
caught in the squeeze, Pattler was wild.
SEA-GOIN’ SAMARITAN

  “Well anyway, I’ll settle your hash for
you!” he shrilled. “Kennard, I’ll put you
on the beach and I’ll see that you stay
there! Now work this boat offa here. Use
your engine, wiggle back an’ forth or some-
thing !”

  Kennard gave the owner a frosty smile.
“This, mister, is a boat. And a boat doesn't
answer her helm unless she’s going ahead.
And to run the engines forward would just
drive us harder onto the shoal. We’ve got
to sit here until a higher tide comes along
*—or until somebody gives us some help.
Our job now is to keep the ship from
breaking up.”

  A vicious sea slammed against the tug
with an impact that wrenched a groan out
of her, and flung spray high into the air.
Pattler, slammed against the deckhouse by
the murky water, came up gasping weakly.
“Call for help, somehow!” he ordered.

  “That,” said Kennard, “will be easy.
We’ll just send a message to the Coast
Guard with that radio transmitter that you
never bought us!”

  Quivering, Pattler retreated aft, toward
his cabin.

  Kennard watched him go.

  Vince Waldo looked very solemn. “I told
you Splinterpuss would bring us bad luck
when he came aboard. I worked it out by
numbers—”

  “Come on aft,” Kennard interrupted.

  On the tug’s broad fan-tail, deluged by
spray and buffeted by the gale, the skipper
and the engineer made things fast as best
they could. “Nothing much we can do,
Vince,”. Kennard said. “The old Togmk’s
due to take a beating, but she can take it,
while Burkun’s tub would fall apart. Keep
a close watch below, though. If we start
taking water, let me know.”

  “And when we get off,” Waldo asked,
primly, “what do we do to Burkun?”

  The engineer’s gentle manner might have
fooled those who did not know him into
overlooking the hard and joyous gleam
which lurked behind his gold-rimmed
glasses.

  Kennard gave the engineer a slow grin.
“We’ll see, Vince.”

PATTLER spent the afternoon in his
cabin, locked in with his worries and
his profit-ledgers. He emerged, along about
sundown, cornered Kennard in the fore-
peak, and went at the skipper like an ex-
cited little terrier.

  “Kennard! Now you lissen to me— I’ve
been figurin’ up the losses you’ve caused
me by your fool rescue acts, an’— Hey!
There goes Burkun—with our tow!”
Pattler was right, for once. In the murky
gray mixture of sea and sky, a man could
just make out the 554 ton cannery ship,
with Burkun’s squat tug wallowing ahead
of it. This was one of the off-years when
the Egegik salmon run dropped to zero—
and the cannery people were anxious to get
their vessel, an old bark which had been
converted to a floating cannery, to work
on the Nushagak Bay run as soon as possi-
ble. Knowing Kennard for a towboat man
who knew his business, they had given the
job to the Togiak. But when Burkun
showed up with word that Kennard was in
trouble, it was only natural for them to
give the Becharoj the nod. A salmon run
waits for no man.

  Vince Waldo came out of the engine-
room companion. “I been listening to my
short-wave radio,” the prim little engineer
reported. “The Egegik cannery station sent
a call to the Coast Guard. Told ’em we
were hung up on this shoal! ”

  Kennard clenched his fists. This was a
sock on the jaw, and no mistake. Word
would go the rounds that Kennard had to
be pulled off a shoal by the Coast Guard.
And the towage business, from then on,
would go to the competitor who knew these
treacherous waters and their currents well
enough to keep himself—and the tows
placed in his charge—out of trouble. Mean-
ing Burkun

  Blaze didn’t know Bristol Bay nearly so
well as he pretended. But he did make a
lot of noise. And he’d make a mighty good
thing out of this.

   Pattler realized all this, too. And without
a word now, the owner went stamping back
to his cabin. And there he stayed until the
Togiak was pulled off the shoal just after
136

ARGOSY

dark, by a Coast Guarder who bellowed
questions through a megaphone and got
some very unsatisfactory answers.

  Free of the reef Kennard headed the
powerful tug northeast by east. Driven by
the steady pulse of her Diesels, the Togiak
smashed along, belligerently shouldering
through the seas. There was something
mighty businesslike about the tug. And
there was an unwavering purpose in the
eyes of her skipper, as he peered through
the rain-lashed windows of the wheelhouse.

  After a while, Vince Waldo came up with
a tray of food that he had prepared. The
Togiak, far under-manned' because extra
hands cost money which Pattler couldn’t
bear to subtract from his profit column,
had no cook.

  Kennard gave the engineer the wheel,
put the tray on the chart-table, and con-
sulted page 316 of his pilot book while
he munched absently.

  On his face there was a shadowy smile
when he took over the wheel again and
let Waldo go below to the engines.

AFTER hours of zigzagging in the
nasty cross-sea born of a conflict be-
tween storm and tide, Kennard picked up
the lights of the Becharof and her tow.
Against the northwesterly blow, Burkun
was making scant headway.

  And as he passed close-to, Kennard
blinked his lights in mocking salute.

  From that moment on, in the wheel-
house of the staggering, plunging Togiak,
the skipper was mighty busy. He fought
the wheel, consulted Charts 8802 and 9050,
kept minute track of his position and
speed, and made allowances for the tide-
current and the drift caused by the gale.

  The sea wenched at the tug, as if de-
termined to tear the keel out of her. Out-
side the little wheelhouse there was only
the blackness of night, crammed with the
roar and the crashing of the water. Inside,
Kennard’s face wore an expression of
frosty amusement as, gently, he altered
the course a bit to port.

  After a few minutes he lashed the wheel
and went out onto the little bridge and

clung there, looking back toward the dimly-
seen lights of Burkun’s tug. Burkun was
swinging to follow the Togiak. Burkun,
who made a lot of noise about knowing
these water intimately, was relying on Ken-
nard’s judgment, now that the going was
tough.

  The master of the Togiak altered his
course a trifle more, then held to it. The
seas suddenly became more savage; took
on a suspicious resemblance to breakers;
but soon, however, they slacked off and
the motion of the Togiak eased.

  Kennard went out onto the bridge again.
It was hard now to make out the dim
lights of the Becharof and its tow; but,
after a few minutes, Kennard perceived
Burkun’s lights brighten in intensity,
while those of the cannery hulk gradually
disappeared.

  Kennard returned to his wheel and rang
Waldo for Half Speed.

  After fifteen minutes or so, Burkun’s
squat tug drew alongside. Hauling danger-
ously close to the Togiak, Burkun let loose
a series of frantic toots with his whistle.

  Kennard rang his engines to Stop—
Stand By and went out onto the bridge
again. Across the narrow strip of water
which separated the two plunging, rolling
tugs, he looked down at Burkun’s giant
figure on the Becharof’s deck, plain against
the vessel’s lights.

  “What’ll you have?” Kennard asked
camly, leaning against the rusty iron-pipe
railing of his bridge.

  “Yuh know well what I’ll have!” Burkun
roared. “You led us across a shoal! The
cannery hulk’s aground—our line carried
away! The hulk’ll bust up any minute an’
you gotta help us get her off b’fore she
does! You got a line heavy enough—”

  “You think the pounding we took on
Chichagof Shoal did us any good?” Ken-
nard retorted. “We strained some frames,
bent our rudder, and had some ports stove
in. You got us into that, with as low a
trick as ever was pulled by anything on
two legs. Then you went off and left us.
Now, I’m heading for Dillingham—and if
I choose to take a short-cut through shal-
SEA-GOIN’ SAMARITAN

137

low water, that’s my business. I’m sure
surprised that a man who claims to know
as much about these waters as you do
should have to follow someone else in thick
weather.”

  Burkun shook spray from his eyes and
glared up at Kennard with the malevolence
of a cornered Kodiak bear. “You ain’t
gettin’ away with this!” he roared. “That
cannery hulk’s worth a couple hundred
thousand, with the machinery that’s in her.
You knew she drawed more water than
either your tug or mine—you knew she’d
strike on that shoal. Everybody knows
you're one of them wise guys that uses
charts an’ such, an’ keeps track of his po-
sition all the time. You went an’ deliber-
ately led me—”

  “You’ll never make that stick,” Ken-
nard cut in. “Your tow is your responsi-
bility, not mine. You knew how much
water she draws; why didn’t you use your
lead?”

  “I did! It showed eleven fathom’ a min-
ute before the hulk struck! I seen some
breakers, but by then it was too late.”

  “Well,” Kennard said easily, looking
over the men who crowded the Becharof’s
deck behind Burkun, “your tow is roost-
ing on Ustiugof Shoal. If you’ll look at a
chart some time you’ll see that Ustiugof
has two fathoms at mean lower low water,
which is just about the stage now. And if
you’ll look at a pilot book, you’ll find it
says Ustiugof is steep on the offshore side
—I see .you’ve taken off the crew of the
hulk. Well—” Kennard turned, opened the
door of his wheelhouse and started to go
inside.

  “Hey!” Burkun’s bull voice was as near
to pleading as he could bring it. “This
is a case of distress, see? Do I get some
help, or don’t I?”

  “Why,” Kennard said—grinning when
he saw that Pattler had come pussyfoot-
ing out onto the deck and was listening
intently—“sure you do, Blaze. Always glad
to help a man out.”

  Burkun’s heavy jaw sagged. Pattler’s
head swiveled and his sharp face pointed
up at the skipper.

   Kennard went back into his wheelhouse
and rang for Half-Speed. The Togiak got
under way.

  And with the storm lashing at their
broad fan-tails and the smoke of their
Diesels swirling low over their bows, the
two tugs raced back to the stranded tow.

THE cannery people had done wrong
by the Susan M—any seagoing man
would tell you that, profanely. The old
bark's proud masts had been stubbed, her
hold crammed with iron Chinks, dehydra-
tors and steam chests to make her a float-
ing salmon cannery.

   And now she lay heavily on the shoal,
her stubbed bowsprit pointed defiantly
into the storm.

  Kennard eased the Togiak close past
the bark and the Becharof followed closely.

   “I’ll send a man or two aboard! ” Burkun
megaphoned to Kennard. “We’ll haveta
use your line.”

   Kennard agreed to that. Burkun sidled
close to the Togiak, close enough for two
of his hands to jump across to Kennard’s
vessel and bent a light line onto the end
of his galvanized wire-rope tow cable.
That was the only cable of its kind on
Bristol Bay. Burkun used Manila line. And
Pattler, if a man could judge from the
way he was stamping around on the fore-
deck of the Togiak down there, didn’t like
this idea of helping Burkun, not any.

   But it wasn’t Pattler’s way to do his
objecting now. He’d wait until Burkun
wasn’t around—not good business to let
the competition know that there was dis-
sension aboard the Togiak.

  Burkun’s two men returned to the
Becharof, carrying with them their light
line. Burkun swung the red tug away and
sidled it up to the cannery bark. His men
made the precarious jump to the low plat-
form that had been built out from^the
bark’s hull to serve as a landing-stage for
the Aleut fishermen’s small boats. From
there, aided by the glare of the searchlight
beam which Burkun threw against the
bark, they made their way easily to the
deck.
138

ARGOSY

   With the help of their light line, they
drew Kennard’s steel towing-line aboard,
made it fast to the bits at the bark's stern.
Then they signaled with a flashlight.

   Burkun responded to the signal with a
blast of his whistle, swung back to the
Togiak and had a man throw a short
Manila line across the Togiak’s bow. Patt-
ler made the line fast. The other end of
it was fast to the winches on the Beckarof’s
fan-tail, so that Burkun’s craft could add
its pull to that of the Togiak.

   Then, with Diesels snorting and lines
creaking, the two tugs threw their stub-
born might against the sand’s grip on the
cannery hulk’s keel.

   For several minutes, nothing happened.
But then Kennard felt the bark stir, felt
her come reluctantly free.

   He grinned, in the dim glow of his bin-
nacle. Had Burkun been a better seaman,
he would have waited for the rising tide
and the storm to help him, rather than
chase frantically after the Togiak for as-
sistance. But it was just as well that he
had done it this way. This way a neat
share of the towage fee would go to Patt-
ler, and perhaps then the owner of the
Togiak would come down off his high-horse
for a while.

   For himself, Kennard would be willing
to let it go at that. Fighting Bristol Bay
was job enough for a man—and Kennard
liked to be at peace with his fellow men.
Competitors not excepted.

THE Susan M was running free now,
and one of Burkun’s hands came aft
on the Becharof and cut the Manila line
which had coupled the two tugs together.
Burkun let go a series of blasts with his
whistle.

   And as if in answer, the Togiak bounded
forward. The laboring beat of her Diesels
lifted. Running free, she smashed wildly
through the seas until Kennard rang down
the engines and darted out onto his little
bridge to look back.

   It wasn’t hard to see what had happened.
Those Burkun men who were aboard the
bark had cut Kennard’s steel tow-cablel

  And now Burkun’s squat tug was
circling, grazing past the bow of the bark.
His men had broken out another line
aboard the cannery vessel—were throwing
it down to his tug.

  By the time Kennard had circled to
come alongside the Becharof, they had the
line fast; and Burkun’s craft was swinging
the tow, getting under way.

  The sky was lightening some now and
Kennard, as he ranged close, could see
Burkun’s gleeful face on the Becharof’s
bridge.

   “What’ll yuh have, Kennard?” the red-
headed giant hooted.

   Kennard went out onto his own bridge.
“What’s the idea? Trying to gyp us out
of our share of the tow? We pulled the
bark off that shoal for you, and if you
think—”

   “Don’t know what you’re talkin’ about! ”
Burkun taunted. “I ain’t seen yuh since
you was roostin on Chichagof!”

   “You fool, those cannery workers you’ve
got aboard there will testify—”

  “Now ain’t that too bad?” Burkun re-
torted. “Accidental-like, they went an’ got
intuh my private stock of fire-water.
They’ve passed out on me, to a man!”
Kennard moved with an odd, stiff care-
fulness as he lashed his wheel and went
down to the Togiak’s deck. Vince Waldo
was sticking his head out of the engine-
room. Pattler, his sharp face white under
the dripping brim of his hat, was pacing
the deck.

  The Togiak, though running at slow
speed, was drawing away from Burkun’s
craft. Burkun yelled: “Hey Kennard—
want tuh come over an’ argue?”

  Kennard looked speculatively at the
choice collection of bruisers who crowded
the Becharof’s deck. Vince Waldo, lugging
a huge wrench, came scurrying forward.
“Anything you say, skipper—”

   “No!” Pattler interrupted. “We’ll put
this thing before the commissioner at Dill-
ingham. We’ll—”

  “That’ll buy you nothing” Kennard
stated. “Burkun’s all set to lie himself
out of this—beat us out of our claim. He
SEA-GOIN’ SAMARITAN

139

fed those cannery men some of that de-
horn he peddles to the Indians, so they’ll
be no help to us. A man has to have proof.”

  Pattler said, “Well, we’re not going to
get our heads smashed. Start for Dilling-
ham—and when we get there, you’re fired!
Twice in one day you let that red devil put
it over on you. Seagoin’ Samaritan—” The
little owner swelled up. “Phooey!” he
snorted.

  Vince Waldo squinted up at the skipper.
“What say, Kindly?”

  “Not a word, Vince. It won’t be words
that will settle this thing.”

THE Togiak lay peacefully at anchor,
in the Nushagak River just off Dilling-
ham. In his cabin, Kindly Kennard was
busy with the melancholy task of packing
his duffle.

  Not an easy job, this. A man becomes
attached to a ship which has gamely seen
him through as many adventures as are
inevitable in four years of Bristol Bay
tow-boating. And though a tug may be a
blunt and unlovely specimen of sea-craft,
she has a persistent individuality which no
other type of vessel can equal.

  Vince Waldo stuck his head into the
skipper’s cabin. Kennard swung around,
saw' that the engineer had his own sea-bag
slung over one shoulder.

  “Now look here, Vince,” the skipper
began. “Just because I’m canned—”

  “I’m sick of this tub anyway,” the prim
little engineer retorted. “Sick of Pattler.
“I’m—”

  “You’re a poor liar,” Kennard retorted.
“You’d leave those engines of yours, just
because I pulled one rescue too many?
You’re a fool.”

  They were still arguing that point, when
they reached the deck. But their argument
stopped when they saw a gas-boat, carry-
ing the U. S. Commissioner and Pattler,
come threading through the maze of Indian
outboard boats which were plying nets on
the river.

  Pattler was white, quivering with help-
less fury.

  “Burkun’s brought the cannery hulk to

anchor off Nushagak!” he said wildly, ges-
turing when he reached the tug’s deck.
“The commissioner staged a hearing—
Burkun’s gang of thugs lied their heads
off! The commissioner says I’ve got no
proof—can’t do a thing! Do you realize
what this means to my business? If I can’t
get the goods on Burkun, he’s set to get
ail the towing business—”

  “Too bad,” Kennard sympathized.

  “Too bad, is it?” Pattler yelled. “How
about the investment I’ve got tied up here?
What am I gonna do about that? What
about the guff I’ve had to take from that
red devil?”

  “I wouldn’t know,” Kennard said gently.
“I don’t work here any more. I’m just
waiting to go ashore. And, having helped
myself out of a job, I’ve sworn off helping
other folks.”

  Pattler squinted. “Kennard, what are
you so all-fired cagey about?”

  The skipper moved toward the rail.
“Business is business. You said so your-
self. So I’m keeping what I know to my-
self, from now on. Maybe the commissioner
will give Vince and me a ride to Dilling-
ham.”

  But Pattler grabbed Kennard’s jacket.
“Listen, Kennard! What’ve you got up
your sleeve? Can you prove—”

  “I might prove that we pulled Burkun’s
tow off a shoal, last night. But—”

  “How?” Pattler yelled. “How c’n you
prove that?”

  “That,” Kennard stated calmly, “is my
own business, now. If you want me to work
for you again we’ll talk business. But it’s
going to cost you ten bucks a month extra
on my pay, for every time you told me I
was fired—about six times, I think, or sixty
dollars.”

  Pattler’s mouth sagged open, closed with
a click, sagged again. At last he managed
to wheeze, “All right—if you prove it!
And, if you don’t, I’ll see that you never
get a job, so help me.”

THE commissioner’s boat, carrying
Pattler and Kennard and Vince Waldo
now, in addition to the commissioner,
140

ARGOSY

crossed the broad reach of the river and
came alongside the cannery hulk. The four
went aboard.

  They were met by Burkun. The giant
glared at them and spread his feet de-
fiantly. “You guys whinin’ around here
again?”

  Kennard grinned. “Like to have a look
at those stern towing bits, Blaze. If you
don’t mind.”

  Burkun’s bushy red eyebrows lowered
suspiciously. But then he pulled air into
his barrel chest and let out a derisive snort.
“Go ahead! If you think you c’n make
anybody believe that yarn of yours, go
to it. Trouble with you guys is, you got
grounded on Chichagof Shoal, lost a towin’
job—an’ now you’re tryin’ tuh get even.”

  He followed them aft, though. And he
scowled when Kennard knelt at the towing-
bits.

  Burkun had, of course, removed the end
of the Togiak's cable from the bits.
But Kennard pointed to the weathered
wood.

  “There you are, Commissioner. This
hulk hasn’t been moved for years—and
ours is the only steel-cable towing line of
its particular size on Bristol Bay. Burkun’s
Manila line would never have bit into the

wood as our line did. Our steel line left
its fingerprints here, so to speak. And you
can check them any time, with a section
of our cable. Which proves Burkun was
lying. And when the hearing about a cer-
tain dirty deal that was pulled on Chicha-
gof Shoal comes up, the fact that Burkun
lied about this won’t help him any, will
it?”

  Pattler chuckled, as pleased as a little
boy. But Burkun let out a roar of fury.
He crouched with his nostrils flaring.

  Smiling, Vince Waldo drew a big wrench
out of his pocket. “Take it easy, Burkun.”
The red-headed giant blinked, looked
from Wraldo to the commissioner and then
back to Kennard. “Awright,” he grumbled.
“But you guys got nothin’ on me, see?
You can’t—”

  “If you come out of this with your ticket
still in its frame, I’ll sure be surprised,”
Kennard said. “Mister Pattler, shall we go
back to our vessel?”

  “Kennard,” the sharp-nosed little owner
complained, “what with that extra pay
you’re makin’ me kick in, you’ll damn’
soon be part owner of the boat!”

  “Not a bad idea/’ Kennard commented,
grinning. “I’d say it’s a good way of
handling an owner who won’t stay ashore! ”
MUTINY seizes us this morning.

•	Unrest has us in its grip. It’s
probably merely a symptom of
delayed spring fever, but we are conscious
of accelerated mutations, of a sense of life
rushing giddily ahead without much direc-
tion but with a great speed and gusto. On
our own private and figurative merry-go-
round, there is no reward but the exhilara-
tion of the ride—not even a brass ring.
And we are content that this be so.

  It is a dangerous mood, prompting us
to inaugurate all sorts of changes, to fill
wastebaskets with those perfectly useless
scraps of hieroglyphic-covered notepaper
that have been kicking around our desk,
to rip pages off calendars, even to wince
at the sight of a face familiar to us for
more than a day or two, and to abandon
old philosophies with shattering reckless-
ness. We knew perfectly well that we must
sternly hold ourselves in check; any im-
pulse obeyed today will be regretted for-
ever after. Our only hope of muddling
through this treacherous seizure is to sit
perfectly still and say nothing whatever
to anyone. Repression is the keynote.

  Be that as it may, our comparatively
antic frame of mind leaves us wide open
for the kind of letter that popped at us
out of the mailbag the very first thing.
(All you have to do to get your letter in
featured position, apparently, is to guess
in advance what weird frame of mind the
editor is going to be in when he opens it.
Simple, really.)

ROBERT ESSIG

  May I dare say I hope to be different? Can
I dart from the beaten path like a tangent?

  First of all—I have not read the Akgosy for
twenty, thirty, or—alas! not even forty years.
Hardly, I say, for this is the first copy I’ve

ever read. I haven’t sailed on your brilliantly
golden ship before it was merged with All-Story
and I didn’t live throughout the war for it. You
see, my dear editor, I am young, yes, painfully
so! Perhaps my ears need a toweling, and I
can use a razor blade almost a month without
changing.

  I like the Argonotes more than most of the
stories. I think they are very hypocritical and
sycophantish. I pride myself on my ability “to
be fourth dimensional and read between those
so well known lines.”

  Needless to say, I do like your stories. They
are different and what excitement they do
carry—certainly not harmful to my so innocent
ears.

  G’bless you.

  Pottstown, Penna.

THANKS, Mr. Essig, for falling in so
beautifully with our mood. There was
a place, though, in your third paragraph
where we weren’t exactly sure of your in-
tention. You like the Argonotes better than
the stories—but when you say “they are
very hypocritical and sycophantish,” do
you mean the Argonotes or the stories?
And if the Argonotes, are you being slight-
ly ironic, or do you really like things be-
cause they are “hypocritical and syco-
phantish?” Or what, exactly? We’re not
trying to be picky, but you do leave us
deep in a fine mist of bewilderment.

T. SCOTT OFFUTT, JR.

  I	was delighted to see that illustrious ex-
ponent of the formula yarn—Mr. Lester Dent—
appear in your pages. I have followed his Doc
Savage with much pleasure, and consider Deni
a veritable one-man factory.

  Also delighted to see my old friend Joe*
Townsley Rogers appear. See if you can’t per-
suade him to tackle a novel in the fine frenzj
of hurly-burly that characterized Once In A
Red Moon. But possibly too many years ol
the blue pencil have sobered his diction.

  To you, and to preceding editors—congratu-
lations! I doubt if there’s a pulp in existence

141
142

ARGOSY

which can claim as many devoted followers and
I attribute that to a most gifted and aggressive
line of editors. I won’t pick favorites—all your
writers are A-l. And I notice that not only
have a host of your contributors ‘graduated’ to
the slicks, but that a few appear simultaneously
in the Argosy and the slicks to-day.

  I’m collecting Argosies and would like to
contact any readers willing to part with old
ones—the older the better.

  Towson,. Maryland.

JUST to reassure Mr. Offutt, we hasten
to say that the work of Joel Towns-
ley Rogers and the editorial blue pencil
are almost utter strangers. In fact, Mr.
Rogers’ blissfully untrammeled condition
on our pages is practically an office scan-
dal.

  For weeks, we’ve been howling for let-
ters from new or newish Argosy read-
ers. So when we find them somewhat less
restful than the roseate reminiscences from
old-time Argonauts, it’s probably nobody’s
fault but our own. Anyhow Mr. Offutt
wants more Rogers, while the next gentle-
man wants a good deal less of him and
apparently none at all of J.T.R.’s contro-
versial colleague, Theodore Roscoe.

JOHN E. POTTER

  I am a rather new Argosy fan. I’ve always
liked your magazine, but until recently felt
satisfied with any pulp of the higher class. For
several months now I’ve been sticking to
Argosy, and am very well satisfied, except for
your pet Theodore Roscoe, whose stories I am
astonished to see included with those of Brand,
Challis and Bedford-Jones. Roscoe’s characters
lurch about the stage with aching muscles and
tortured lungs, until my tongue hangs out and
sweat beads my brow! I read for pleasure, so
I must skip Roscoe, who leaves me exhausted.

  But my purpose in writing is to cheer your
magazine. Each issue brings me new thrills,
new glimpses of far off lands and ancient times.
The farther back you go the better I like it.

I hereby order some Crusaders, Phoenicians,
Norsemen and Romans. I am yours unless you
find too many Roscoes and Townsley Rogers.

  Darien, Conn.

IT’S been a pretty much stag affair so
far today, so immediately to the south,
you’ll find two members of the distaff side
in full cry. First an elusive correspondent

who gives us no clue to identity except in

the superscription:

FROM THE HILLS O’ MAINE

  Have been reading numerous references to
republishing some of your older stories in an
Argosy Quarterly. Fine idea but when do you
begin? May I mention a few I should enjoy
again? The Black Butterfly, a Semi-Dual story
which first attracted my attention over 20 years
ago—All your Semi-Duals are worth repeating.
The Argus Pheasant, that interesting story of
Borneo and the Dutch East Indies. The Master
of the Hour by Achmed Abdullah (the story of
the man who would be ruler of all Africa);
The Three Hostages, a fine detective story.
How often I have recalled it by the cryptic
meaning of “On the side of Jordan.” In the
Green Fields of Eden—remember it? The Moon
Pool and its sequel both by A. Merritt were
eerie enough for anyone. That winter of 1917
and ’18 was full of splendid stories. The Ship
of Ishtar was another good one. These, in my
opinion, are much preferable to some of your
recent gangster stories. Madame Storey—what’s
become of her? Gillian Hazeltine was always
good, and Burroughs has always delighted boys.

  Why not print stories of Aneient Egypt,
Babylon, the Gobi Desert, and Persia ? Even
historical novels or novelets are better than
gangster stories. I skip the latter—but have
always enjoyed Argosy. A good interesting
magazine is to be enjoyed during the long win-
ters. I’ve tried many but like best the Argosy
because it is different.

MRS. HARRY W. WALKER

  The Argosy has a new cover* Long live the
Argosy.

  We did not begin with the early readers of
the Argosy. We began with the Cavalier, De-
cember, 1911. Later on, the Cavalier was mar-
ried to All-Story; and later All-Story became
the Argosy.

  We liked the early stories so much that we
have home-bound copies of George Allan Eng-
land's trilogy—Darkness and Dawn> Beyond the
Great Oblivion and The Afterglozv. Also, Jacob
Fisher’s Cradle of the Deep—August, 1912—
and Wm. Brown Meloney’s Golden Gate pub-
lished in December, 1913.

  We like nearly all the stories, but do not
miss any.

  We would like to see more Semi-Dual tales.
Also Madam Storey, Jimmie Cordie and the
Mr, Solomon stories. The fantastics, scientific
or futuristic are our particular favorites, but
we read them all.

  So I say good luck, and you have our wishes
for a long and prosperous run.

  Baltimore, Md.
ARGONOTES

143

FOR many months we have been aware
of the fact that the one thing which
Argosy does not need is a Poet’s Corner.
Why should we clutter our pages with non-
sensical jingles? Who gives a hoot about
moons in June and goons in tune? Nobody,
of course! A fig for that would be the viva-
voce vote of our Argonote legions.

  Therefore, with the fine logic for which
we are truly infamous, we herewith inaugu-
rate our Poet’s Corner.

  This sub-department, we are certain,
will loom large in the literary history of
this century. We plan to conduct it under
rules which are most unique. It will ap-
pear, for example, only at such obscure
times as we happen to be in the mood for
it. We shall pay not one penny for contri-
butions; in fact, each contribution must
be accompanied by a penny (or an unrea-
sonable facsimile thereof). All professional
and all amateur poets are barred. Not one
word do we want from Edna St. Vincent

Millay or Robert Frost. Hush, all you Ed-
gar Guests. Only the editors and authors
of Argosy, plus bonafide Argonotes stal-
warts, are eligible to this holy of holies.
In certain moods we will bar all poems
that rhyme; in others we will reject all
verse except that of most intricate rhym-
ing.

We inaugurate our epoch-making, revo-
lutionary, super-streamlined innovation to
wit and as follows:

            MULE

           I prithee

         Do not kick me;

          For I am slender-tender.

                 —Leo Lawson Rogers.

Or this, which we consider, frankly, a
masterpiece:

 Barbecue, Barbecue, where have you been?

Who, me?

 Yes, you, Barbecue. . . .

                          —L. L. R.

DRINK WE DEEP

Beneath the timeless rocks of the Helderbergs—slumbering
below Lake Wanooka’s unfathomed waters—-lies the seed of
earth-conflict. For there lives the strange and troubled race
of other worldlings, waiting, always waiting, for the hour of
deliverance . . . And on the earth’s surface, one man feels in his blood a resist-
less summons that calls him to their side. Beginning a most unusual novel of

                      genuine power and distinction, by
_ARTHUR LEO ZAGAT_

BLACK CARGO

Back in the days when black-birding was an adventurous and nearly respectable
means of livelihood, a slave ship, her hold crammed with terrified jungle natives,
begins the perilous voyage to the Americas. But First Officer Pritchard senses
trouble when the girl comes aboard. A complete novelet, by
CORNELL WOOLRICH

PAY THE DEVIL

Incarcerated in the steaming jungles of French Guiana was one prisoner—a doc-
tor—whose integrity of spirit could not be quenched or bought. A novelet of
man’s struggle with man under the terror of a living death, by

ATHLETE’S

    FOOT

       iWkmj According to the Govern-
       nient Health Bulletin, No.
       m’W E-28, at least 50% of the
       adult population of the
       - J United States are being
       Jf attacked by the disease
       W known as Athlete’s Foot.

       W Usually the disease starts be-
       r tween the toes. Little watery
       blisters form and the skin
       cracks and peels. After a while
       the itching becomes intense and
       you feel as though you would like
       to scratch off all the skin.

W The germ that causes the disease Is known
V as Tinea Trichophyton. It buries Itself deep in
r the tissues of the skin and is very hard to kill.

   A test made shows it takes 20 minutes of boiling
  to kill the germ, so you can see why the ordi-
  nary remedies are unsuccessful.

  H. F. was developed solely for the purpose of
treating Athlete’s Foot. It is a liquid that pene-
trates and dries quickly. You just paint the af-
fected parts. It peels off the tissues of the skin
where the germ breeds.

Beware of
It Spreading

  Often the disease travels all over the bottom of the
feet. The soles of your feet become red and swollen.
The skin also cracks and peels, and the Itching be-
comes worse and worse.

  Get rid of this disease as quickly as possible, be-
cause It is very contagious and it may go to your
hands or even to the under arm or crotch of the legs.

  Most people who have Athlete's Foot have tried all
kinds of remedies to cure it without success. Ordi-
nary germicides, antiseptics, salve or ointments
seldom do any good.

  As soon as you apply H. F. you will find that the
itching is immediately relieved. You should paint
the infected parts with H. F. night and morning
until your feet are well. Usually this takes from
three to ten days, although in severe cases it may
take longer or in mild cases less time.

 H. F. will leave the skin soft and smooth. You
will marvel at the quick way it brings you relief;
especially If you are one of those who have tried
for years to get rid of Athlete’s Foot without
success.
