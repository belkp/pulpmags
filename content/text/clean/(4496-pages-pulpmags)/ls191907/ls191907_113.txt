108 The Silver Lining SONNETS OF THE COMMONPLACE To a Fried Egg TO-DAY the golden sun sank in the west, And as I watched its mellow afterglow, And saw the changing colors come and go, By vagrant cloudlets kissed and e'en caressed, Unbidden tears came to my eyes distressed, And caused my memory to overflow With ever present dreams, and in my woe I cursed the sun in very wretchedness. For in the west, the world seemed turned to red, And then a smear of yellow overcast The sky; and as the color quickly spread, Brought visions of my early morn's repast; And all the scene recalled, as from the dead, The weary egg with which I broke my fast.
