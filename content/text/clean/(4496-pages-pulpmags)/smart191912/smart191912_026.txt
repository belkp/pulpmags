WHAT IS ISN'T 19    mured, burying her face between the [oth]er's neck and shoulder, and inhaling the fragrance of Bianca's favorite French sachet.  Then, for a space, both wept. Sarah [unco]ntrollably, but Bianca in a series of [hysteri]cal spasms which her will was [power]less to command.  Marie, standing in the bathroom [door], regarded the scene with approval. [It] was the first time her mistress had [cri]ed, and she believed with Ovid that ["]grief is satisfied and carried off by [tea]rs."  "To think, dear," Sarah managed to [sa]y at length, sitting on the edge of the [bed] and dabbing at her moist lashes and [che]eks, "that this awful thing should to you!"  She was half a head shorter than Bi- [anca] and fair. But for the unceasing [] she waged against over-plumpness [she] would have been chubby. As it [wa]s, she was most daintily moulded. Bianca, still sobbing, but more re- [fr]ainedly, was without words. But the [mor]e volatile Sarah continued:  "Yerday was terrible enough, but this morning's papers! I wonder you [are] alive."  To the wretched woman propped against the pillows, however, this []ant nothing. She didn't care what the papers might say; what additional [t]rails they might give. Even if they could have got Robert Holland's story [o]f his discovery it was all one to her. [] knew now the solitary secret of [her mi]sery. She had found it in her [dre]ams. Elliot Holland dead was more [pow]erful than Elliot Holland alive to [kee]p Lee Calvert from her. There had [ev]er been a time in all their acquaint- [ance] when she needed him as she did now. And there had never been a time [wh]en he was so securely held from her. She knew nothing of the actual con- dictions, of how by the machinery of the [] he was pinioned. She still saw [him] a free man in every sense but one. [Sh]e saw him at liberty to go and come [as] he pleased, everywhere save to her, []m whom alone Convention barred [hi]m. For the sake of her good name,     lest the world should see in his coming the casting of shadows behind, he must deprive both her and himself of the consoling sweetness of communion.  But Sarah Rhysdael had no inkling of the truth. Naturally enough, she had gathered from Marie's concern that her friend had gone nervously to pieces, not over her husband's death, but over this gruesome charge against and im- prisonment of the man she loved. Nothing else, she felt, could account for it. Nothing else could warrant it.  Sarah came not to fortify, not to brace, not even to comfort. She came dolorously to sympathize. To mingle her tears with the tears of the sufferer and to follow her, sacrificially, as she traversed her Via Crucis.  "Poor Lee," she went on. "It's sim- ply awful for him, too. No one can be- lieve that he did it. And yet there's no one else that could. But that's the newspapers, you know. Stanny says that they'll never convict him. I do hope that--"  It was at this point that Bianca, springing up wide-eyed, gripped her wrist.  "What are you saying?" she cried in sudden agitation, aroused by the dis- turbing pregnancy of a phrase. "What are you saying?"  Sarah was startled. She was so taken by surprise, indeed, that just for a moment she could not recollect what she had been saying. Certainly nothing disloyal, though. She knew that.  "My dear!" she gasped, parrying, feinting.  "'Never convict him!'" Bianca re- peated. "What do you mean?"  "That is what Stanny says," her friend qualified. "You don't--you can't believe that they will."  "Convict whom? Convict of what?"  Sarah paled with fright. Even now she did not divine the truth. It did not yet occur to her that Bianca knew less than she. There was, she thought, but one explanation: the horror had af- fected her friend's reason. She was not herself, poor thing. She turned about, her gaze seeking Marie. But
