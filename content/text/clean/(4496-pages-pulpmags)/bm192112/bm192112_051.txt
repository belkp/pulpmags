48 The Trap Thief He found Mary, benumbed with ter- ror, crouching in a corner of the cavern. Raising her in his arms, he comforted and revived her. Mary sobbed out her story with arms around his neck. "Say, sonny, let's go," Cox finally intervened. "Thanks to you, I've made the neatest round-up in my fourteen years of Government service-- Crooks, printing press, copper plates, engravers' tools--the whole outfit. Have a look at this--" He extended a crisp twenty- dollar bill--"the neatest take-off you'll see in a blue moon." "Mary--Miss Gage wants to go to my mother's in Honesdale." "Hum-- She's one of the gang." "I didn't know what they were doing here-- Indeed!" cried the girl. "She's right there!" It was Gage who spoke, scowling on them from the knot of prisoners. "Surely you won't punish her!" Jack insisted. "Why, Mr. Cox, she deserves all the credit for this. She told me how to find the trapdoor to this cave." "Oh!" Cox reflected in doubt. "We might let her stay with your mother till we need her in court--" One of Cox's men put in a decisive word. As he left his post as a guard for the prisoners and came forward, Jack saw that his left hand was covered with bandages. "They're right, Boss," he said. "I'm sure you're safe in letting her go. Miss Mary knew nothing of what was doing here. If she had been one of the gang and had known about it, I would have found it out, being with her all the time--" "Why Jimmie Willets!" cried the girl. "Present!" he replied with a grin. "Barring my whiskers and the other camouflage." "Then you're not half-witted?" "Not to notice it, Miss Mary." "And you hanging around our cabin all the time; helping me steal the traps--" "Got to do crazy things in my job, Miss Mary." "Oh, Jimmie!" "I'll take your word for it, Willets," Cox remarked. "Sonny, will you and Miss Gage accept our thanks and apolo- gies? You'd better hustle along now with your elopement."
