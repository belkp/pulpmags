I've saved $3 for a Rainy Day... on tooth paste alone   "MAYBE you think I'm not glad I changed to Listerine Tooth Paste! "It's worked wonders for my teeth. They used to be cloudy and dull. Now you can see how white and sparkling they are. My gums are firmer, too, and my whole mouth feels swell! I've never found any- thing at any price that I liked so well, or gave such good results. "And speaking of price, Listerine Tooth Paste has saved me about $3, and I've used it only a year. You see, it costs a quarter, and the difference between that and forty or fifty cents may look small, but it mounts up. " That old saying about saving for a rainy day has a new meaning for me. It had already been raining for a couple of years before I woke up, but believe me, I've learned to watch the small items now. I'm darned glad to save $3 on my tooth paste-- especially when I prefer Listerine Tooth Paste anyway!" * * * Smile into your mirror. Examine    your teeth.
