Blueberry Pie 13 way. What if she did? That wouldn't hurt Dennison. He'd be glad she was out of the way, really. If she could be found dead! If Den- nison could be blamed! That would be something. He would be electro- cuted for her murder! Of course! That would be clever! In her mind, now, she went over the whole thing--how she could kill herself--and leave little evidences about, so that it would look as if Dennison had killed her. She'd have to be careful, of course. Why, of course. She would have to make it look as if Dennison had planned to make it look like suicide or burglary! Burglary would be best. Dennison would die! She laughed almost wildly over that. She dressed and laughed all the while. She felt sort of funny. Was she mad? She didn't think she was. Of course not. Yes, that's the way she'd do things. But--then she would be dead. She didn't want to be dead. She wouldn't know about Dennison. She had to know. No, that wouldn't do either. She wanted to live. She was too young to die. She must get even with Dennison! That woman who had died--a blonde woman, too, nearly her age. She wondered about her. Then the thought came to Irene. It came to her, suddenly. It enveloped her, left her weak, dizzy. Could she get that body? If that body could be found--here--instead of hers ! The woman had no relatives-- surely that would be easy enough. She would try. That was it. She could do her best. It was the only way--a way to get even. . . . Her heart started to sing in a wild way, a way it hadn't sung for a year :--more than that. If she could--if she could fix things so that it would look as if Dennison. . . . She thought it over. If things went right! If not . . . well, she'd have to take some chances, anyhow. A ring at the door-bell. She trembled. The mail man. She went downstairs, a plan already formulated in her mind. She met Mrs. Peterson in the hall, started right in on the plaj^ ---talked with her . . . the vacation . . . a holiday with Dennison. She telephoned to Schmidt to bring her trunk up. He brought it and the bags up almost immediately. She talked with him eagerly, nervously. Another ring at the bell. It was the man for Dennison's trunk. She trembled as the man took it out. Mrs. Peterson, again. Dennison's trunk gone. She finished dressing, went out, the clipping about the woman suicide in her purse. Mrs. Peterson's door was still open. That prying little woman. She'd keep on talking--prepare her--in case things went all right. VI She hurried out of the apartment building, took a subway train, went to the address mentioned in the news story. It was a cheap rooming house. She hurried up the stone stairs, remembering to sniffle a bit. A weary looking woman with red eyes answered the door. Irene's voice trembled. She really was nervous. "I--I read in the paper just now--" she began. "Yes?" the woman looked at her, suspiciously. "My sister--her name--she disap- peared from home. I just happened to be here, visiting in New York-- she could sew--she was blonde--like me. . . The woman's expression changed.
