46 A Weapon of the Law "Surest thing you know. You're go- ing to live and get your dose o' misery." "Then I'll do it myself !" The Judge turned to the table at his elbow and pulled open the drawer. There in the front of the drawer lay a blued- steel revolver. Dodd, who was watch- ing him narrowly, sprang forward with a cry as he caught sight of it. Before Judge Lathrop could get his hand on the gun in the drawer, Dodd had clapped his own hand, that held the automatic, over it. "I tell you you got to live!" he cried, frowning down at the Judge. The Judge returned this gaze, and for a second they measured each other with their eyes. Then, with his eyes still fastened on Dodd, the Judge suddenly gave a mighty push and jammed the table drawer shut. There was a howl of pain from Dodd, and the drawer was deep enough so one could hear the automatic fall on the wood bottom. The Judge eased the drawer a trifle, at the same time shoving at Dodd with his foot. Dodd staggered across the room, where he stood wringing his hands in an agony of pain. The Judge quickly opened the drawer, picked up the auto- matic and covered Dodd with it. "Jack Dodd," said the Judge, "the crime for which I sentenced you is one of the filthiest, vilest deeds on the crimi- nal calendar. It will give me great pleasure to return you to your keepers." "You--you--" Dodd sputtered. "A trick, a damnable trick!" "Yes, a trick, Dodd. There are other weapons beside firearms." Dodd's lips curled back from his teeth with venom. "I hope that son of yours ends in the electric chair!" And then followed a string of vile oaths. "My dear Dodd," said the Judge as he took up the receiver to telephone the police, "I have no son."
