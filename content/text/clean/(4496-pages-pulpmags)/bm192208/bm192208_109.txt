106 The Mistaken Sacrifice suggest that you appropriated the money ?" "No," said Hanley. "And nothing to show I didn't. Yet, as a matter of fact, I've drawn only half my salary each month since I made the discovery. I wanted to put the money back and thus prevent all chance of my ever be- ing accused. Clayburne arrived about a year too soon. I hadn't quite made it good." For a moment he was silent, and then he shrugged his shoulders and laughed bitterly. "As it stands, Ah Fu's useless and foolish sacrifice not only fails to clear me, but establishes a motive which brands me as a crook as well as a mur- derer. He has even burned up the de- posit book, which would show my honest efforts at restitution. I haven't a Chinaman's chance of proving that I've played straight since my first and only mistake." "I'm genuinely sorry for you, Han- ley," sympathized the attorney. "It's rotten, too, after the devotion which prompted that crazy yellow heathen to give his life for you." "Be sorry for him, not for me," Hart- ley smiled. "If the world's going to think I stole Morely's money after all his kindness, I'd just as leave be hung for murder. Poor Ah Fu did the best he knew how when he tried to help me out; but the foolish fellow will be tor- tured through eternity when he learns-- as the dead surely must do--what a sorry mess his good intentions really made of things."
