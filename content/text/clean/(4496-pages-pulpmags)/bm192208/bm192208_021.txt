18 Blueberry Pie a position, even let her hair grow, maybe. A new name? Any name. She'd think one up. Only she mustn't change her initials. That would be bad luck, unless she got married. Any name but Irene Graham. . . . She pinned on her hat. She could go, now. She was hungry. She went into the kitchen. Where, in the dim light, she saw the pie she had made. Why not take a piece? She didn't care much for blueberry pie. She wondered, now, why she had both- ered--how she had had the nerve to make it. Why not eat a piece, as long as it was there. They might blame a neighbor--the police, any- one. She cut a piece of pie, ate it. It was good pie. Too good for what it was made for. To think of all the pies she had made during the two years, for Dennison. Stuart--she had loved him--really had. Well, he'd get what was coming to him. She'd forget it all--these two years-- Stuart Dennison--the apartment-- the--inside the closet. . . . She opened the front door, care- fully. There was no one in sight. She closed the door after her, quietly, and, suitcase in hand, went out to catch her train. VIII The newspaper dropped from Irma Martin's fingers. So--it was over. Really over, Dennison was dead. He had "paid for his crime with his life," as the newspapers had said. Mrs. Martin shuddered. She must get over being so nervous. She knew that. She stood up, began to gather together the blue and white break- fast dishes. Funny! She laughed, a bit mirthlessly, to herself. Funny, that she had happened to eat that piece of blueberry pie.
