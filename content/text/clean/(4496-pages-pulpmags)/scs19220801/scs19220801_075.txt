72 She Who Hesitates- Well, kid, you gotta hand it to me ain't you? Watch little Cherrie blossom out! A couple cool mil- lion! Say, don't get sore with me, and if you and Wally ever get hard up, I'll loan you a couple thousand berries. I'm sending this to Wally's hotel. Say, you two had better move into a flat! Cherrie. Nita arched her delicate brows and smiled pensively. Then, with a little yawn, she trailed over to an ivory desk and drew a sheet of monogrammed sta- tionery toward her.

I married Wally early this morn- ing, and not two hours later, his poor father, still ignorant of Wally's marriage, was killed in- stantly in an automobile accident while returning to his orange groves in southern California.

I wish you all the happiness you can derive from your marriage with old Anton. Do take care of him! He looks so withered. Nita. P. S. Still, you never can tell. Old Anton may live to be a hundred.
