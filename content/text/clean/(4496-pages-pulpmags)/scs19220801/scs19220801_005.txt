Four-o'Clock ByLeslie Nelson Jennings CINNAMON toast and macaroons, And little lingers crooked precisely-- At Mila's Thursday afternoons We all say nothing very nicely! Let old cats purr and praise the brew, While teacups pass and silver's clinking: That's Mila's four o'clock, where you Can't guess what anybody's thinking! She understands my patience; yes, And her bright smile has told me plainly That I will not go comfortless, That I will not have suffered vainly! Oh, what care I how many bores Corner me in the hurly-burly, So long as lovely Mila pours-- And I stay late, and they go early!
