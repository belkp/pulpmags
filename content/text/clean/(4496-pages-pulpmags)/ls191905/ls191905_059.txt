SHE LOVES ME!   By Hale Merriman  SHE loves me!  Until last night I never guessed, never dreamed that she cared. She has always been so apparently indifferent, so casual.  But last night I discovered that she has loved me all the time--that it was all a mask--maidenly shyness. She confessed it.  It came about in this way:  I was just reading over the evening papers when there came a timid rap upon the door of my bachelor apartment. Kato, my Japanese servant being out, I an- swered the door myself.  She shrank back as if contemplating flight when she saw me--covered her face with her hands.  Alarmed, as well as astonished, I drew her into the room.  She melted into my arms, clung to me passionately, kissed me.  She spoke in broken sentences. She could endure it no longer. She loved me so! It was stronger than pride, greater than maidenly reserve.  It was like a flame that scorched and seared and consumed her and would not be satisfied. Would I be kind to her, merciful?  She was lovely. ... I have always coveted her. My fragmentary phrases mingled with her own. Our lips clung. Kisses turned to wine upon them. I would have asked her to marry me long ago, but I am such a penniless beggar!  But she loves me for myself alone. Having compromised herself by appearing unchaperoned at my apartments, she suggested that we be married at once. Before the midnight bells rang out over the city, we had been made one forever. By Jove, the wonder of it! That queenly creature loves me for myself alone!  How glad I am. . . . Otherwise--  --She might be disappointed when she finds out that it was not her newly acquired husband but a cousin of the same name who inherited the fortune mentioned in the afternoon papers. 56
