64 May Dusk   but I've saved your life! (She clings to him.)  Bob (furiously) Yes, you've shot a damn' bad cook! (They go toward Wong, who opens his eyes and wink's feebly and with in- ebriated gravity at Bob.)  Wong Mister Bob no get mad. Wong pound like hell.  Violet Oh, isn't he dead?  Bob (disgustedly) No, worse luck; only drunk as a lord. (Sound of bugles off--drums and martial music.)  Violet The troops! We are saved!  Bob (holding her in his arms)     But you don't want to go now, do you?  Violet (shyly) I--I must. Unless--you send--for-- for Algernon.  Bob What? You're going to turn me down, after all? You still want to marry him?  Violet No-o.  Bob Then what--  Violet To--to marry--us, dear.  Wong (scrambling to his feet and wav- ing the firecrackers) Hooray! Celeblate! Mister Bob no get mad!  QUICK CURTAIN      MAY DUSK  By Clinton Scollard   THE dusk is weaving at its loom Of shadows, purple-dyed; The attar of the lilac bloom Drifts down the twilight-tide.  Illusive veils of vapor wreathe The meadows wide outspread; While rhytlimically the young leaves breathe In slumber overhead.  Drowsy with dreams the night birds croon, And o'er the hills afar Rises the lovely Dian moon With her Endymion star.
