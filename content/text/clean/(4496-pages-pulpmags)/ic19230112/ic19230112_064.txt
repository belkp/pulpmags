Prize Offers for 1923 An Announcement During this year of 1922 which has just slipped behind us, you, the readers, have made it possible for us to put considerably more copies of this magazine on the newsstands all over the country--just by liking--and buying it. So it doesn't seem fair--does it?--to have a contest without letting our readers take part in it. So, for this coming year we want you to keep sending in your letters of about one hundred words, telling us which stories you like and why. For all letters that are published we will pay at space rates, or even slightly more, if they are unusually good. That means that for a letter of about one hundred words, written just as if you were talking to a neighbor, you will receive a dollar or more. We plan to use four or five letters in each issue. And any reader can send as many letters as he likes. Won't you try for one of these prizes? For Writers of stories in this magazine, we will award during this coming year four prizes of fifty dollars each--in addition of course to payment at usual rates on acceptance. We want stories of the kind of people you know best-- whether they are crooks, or society people, or farmers in the Middle West. We want stories that show life as it is lived in any particular section of the United States--as, for instance, "The Untimely Tornado," in the last number, which pictures life on a "dry" farm in the far West. And of course we want stories that portray the emotions of real people--who love, hate, hope, fear, despair or triumph, as the case may be. Any person who can tell a good story that has the ring of real life to it can compete. This contest is not by any means limited to trained writers. And we hope, and feel sure, that those who read and those who write will help us make this magazine better than ever this year of 1923. With hearty New Year's wishes, THE EDITOR.
