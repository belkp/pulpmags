Seed of Hate 57 ruins of M. de la Chaubriand's chateau. . . . Everybody said it was the hand of God. But they gazed kindly at Auguste. AND that's the story. No more fur- tive glances through the curtains to watch my Auguste. Now on Sun- days, he sits on the doorstep before the cottage, instead of stealing away by him- self.

Then we sit in silence while the neighbors gather timidly about and linger awhile, saying little, understanding much. LAURETTE TAYLOR Will be seen soon in the screen version of "Peg o' My Heart"
