Her Great Moment 129 it was so hard. I thought I'd never see you again after you knew-" But no more words were neces- sary, for she was in his arms, lips pressed against his in a wild, sweet kiss that was a throbbing song of ecstasy. After a time Jack said softly: "Sylvia was only a crush, darling. But you are love, my one and only. I've loved you from the first night we went out together. I'll always adore you, my darling--forever and ever." The chauffeur had turned the car into the park, and in the sheltering darkness of the tree-lined road, their lips met and clung in a tender, pas- sionate kiss that fused their hearts together for all time. YOU YOU were born for summer days And flower-cup perfume, And all the green of April And all the gold of June; You were meant for dancing Every sunlit meadow through, Where thrushes spin their melodies Beneath a tent of blue. And I was born to follow you, To grant your smallest need, To keep your garden flower-filled And free from stone and weed; To walk in joy beside you And to tell you all the day That my love is deep as heaven is And cannot go away. That ever here beside you My heart is waiting, lest You tire of the dancing-- And come home to me and rest! Bert Cooksley. L3-9A
