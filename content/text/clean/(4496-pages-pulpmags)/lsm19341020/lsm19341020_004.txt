ADVERTISING SECTION "WHICH ONE GETS THE JOB?" THEY'RE ALIKE IN EVERYTHING -- EXCEPT JUST ONE THING! They're all intelligent men. All loyal and ambi- tious. Willing and anxious to work. But one factor--and one factor alone--makes one of these applicants the logical man for the job! HE HAS TRAINING! He's ready to step in and go to work. He invests a capital stock of spare-time training in his employer's business. Like him, today thousands of I. C. S. trained men are getting the "breaks" in this important business of landing jobs. They are turning spare time into ready cash. They're equipping them- selves for the jobs at hand and bigger jobs. Mastering an I. C. S. course is not easy -- it takes work and determination, but if you really have a fighting heart, this coupon is the first shot in a winning battle!
