Death Holds the Post By AUGUST W.

"They would spring that on us just when we're in a hole about Mediar," he said in irritation. His companion read the message, grunted perfunctorily, and handed it back without comment. Cranston went out into the deserted quadrangle where build- ings and ground alike baked in the mid- afternoon sun. He was unpleasantly aware of the heavy, hot lifelessness of the place. On the wall two guards were limned against the parched blue of the African sky; in the shade of a barracks doorway a native slept; there was no other sign of life.

Be- fore Lieutenant D'Oblier at Mechar could send out an investigating party, the post had been surprized by a formidable army of men and, after a futile battle on the part of the Legionnaires, had been taken.
