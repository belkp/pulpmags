DEATH HOLDS THE POST 227 footsteps, and then the man from Mechar came through the opened gate. Three Legionnaires who had been ly- ing atop the wall launched themselves downward, one of them striking the in- truder and carrying him to the sand with him. At the same moment men rushed at the man from Mechar from behind the gates and along the walls. The weapon he carried sounded only once; then it was wrenched from his grasp and he lay prone, unmoving, his kepi tipped off from his head. It was over. Then a long sob of horror rose from the men around the fallen Legionnaire, and there was a concerted backward movement. Cranston and Prageur pressed forward and saw. The face that had been hidden beneath the kepi was not a face. It was half exposed bone, half greenly rotting flesh! From it rose the odor of decaying flesh. The thing on the sand before them had been shot through the head a long time ago. "Mon Dieu!" breathed Prageur, star- ing with wide eyes, and abruptly turned away. "Tie it up and put it away some- where--oh, bury it!" Reluctantly, four of the men moved to obey. Prageur looked uncertainly at Crans- ton. "Come along," he murmured. He moved to where Gasparri was lean- ing weakly against the wall, shuddering at the memory this foul invasion had brought to fresh life. "Come, Gasparri," said Prageur gently, taking him by the arm and leading the way to his quarters. "All right," said Prageur without pre- liminary, "I'll grant you that story, Gas- parri. Don't ask me w-hat I think about it--I've got nothing to say. I want to ask you something." He took a fragment of paper from his desk. Cranston recognized it as the paper upon which he had written the message from headquarters earlier in the day. Prageur handed it to Gasparri. "Any- thing in that sound familiar to you?" he asked. Gasparri took the paper wonderingly and read. Abruptly his expression changed. "Dio, yes!" he whispered harsh- ly. "Tall thin man--sunken cheeks--livid scar on left cheek--gray hair," he read jerkingly, and looked up. "It's the man --the man who directs those dead ones!" A mirthless smile appeared on Pra- geur's lips. "Get that, Cranston. Wire headquarters at once for detailed informa- tion on Prettweg and his documents." Headquarters was vague. Their best was in a short wire that came two hours later: PRETTWEG DANGEROUS LUNATIC WHO BELIEVES IN CERTAIN FORMULA CON- CERNING REANIMATION OF DEAD BODIES STOP ESCAPED SANITARIUM AND MADE FOR COAST BELIEVED IN ALGERIA SINCE HE HAD TALKED OF GOING TO COUNTRY WHERE CONFLICT WAS IN PROGRESS STOP GERMAN GOVERNMENT RELUCTANT TO RELAY MORE STOP SURETE BELIEVES PRETTWEG IS ON TO SOMETHING DEVEL- OPED IN GERMAN LABORATORIES HAS ADDED DEVELOPMENTS FROM OWN DIS- EASED BRAIN STOP TAKE THIS MAN DEAD OR ALIVE. The message gave scant satisfaction to Lieutenant Prageur. He studied it for a few moments in silence; then he dropped the paper with a mutter of impatience. "Look here," he said, "reinforcements are due here almost any hour now, but we'll not wait. Forty of us march on Mechar tonight." "Lieutenant, sir!" protested Gasparri. "Those men go to something worse than death!" "Leave that to me, Gasparri," snapped
