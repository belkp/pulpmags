"I'm going to ask your forgiveness," he said earnestly. "Please don't think badly of me! Give me another chance! And some day when you have learned you can really trust me, Beatrice, I'm going to tell you something, and I hope you will listen. Will you?" Beatrice looked up shyly.

The Days of Old By Hale Merriman OLD man, your day is over, Go put your slippers on; Like old dog Tray, you've had your day, But now your day is gone!

From firesides warm and cosy, From easy chairs you came, With toothless smiles and ancient wiles To play at April's game.

Yield to the truth--our nation's youth Is home again from France.
