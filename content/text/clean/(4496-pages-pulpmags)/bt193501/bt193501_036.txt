GAY PAREE By PHILIP LAVERNE Three o'clock and all's well. . .so far!" George Taylor put his watch back in his pocket and filled his lungs with the keen night air. He He was standing on a small ledge, railed in like a miniature porch, that jutted out from the side of the house. A tortuous, winding street, typical of the older part of Paris, lay below him. Inside the dwelling, behind the curtain- ed windows and drawn shades, sounds of revelry cut into the stillness and came floating to his ears. "Speaking of wild parties!" George mused, lighting a cigarette. "This one certainly reminds me of a tornado back home!" He had arrived in Paris only a few days before, after winning a scholarship which entitled him to a year's post-graduate work in the science of medicine. He had taken rooms in a pension in the Latin quartier of the city, and had scarcely unpacked his belongings when he receive the invitation to the soiree that he had forsaken for a moment's breathing spell in the fresh air. "Phew!" he whistled, blinking his eyes. Leaning against the rail, his brain be- gan to rid itself of the surcharge of wine and cocktail fumes that were making him feel woozy and befuddled, eo he decided to stay out there in the air a little longer. But he had no sooner reached this deci- sion than he heard a feminine voice di- rectly behind him: "Ah, monsieur, I have been looking all over the place for you! Isn't the party enjoyable?" He turned to look into the dancing eyes of a titian-haired charmer who was his hostess.
