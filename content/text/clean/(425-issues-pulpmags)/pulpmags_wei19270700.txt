Strange Stories

WEIRD TALES has built its remarkable success on stories that are ut-
terly strange; stories such as are printed in no other magazine;
amazing tales that take the reader out of the humdrum environment of
everyday life into a deathless world of the imagination; eery stories that
send shuddery chills up the spine; ghost-tales, and tales of the weird mon-
strosities of ancient legend; bizarre and fantastic tales; weird-scientific tales
of the spaces between the worlds, and fantastic dooms that menace the
earth. Among the many thrilling stories in the next few issues will be:

THE WOLF-WOMAN, by Bassett Morgan

         They dug her out of a glacier, this golden-haired vampire of the North, and
         she called the white wolves to her side—an eery, creepy story, replete with
         thrills.

THE POLTERGEIST, by Seabury Quinn

        The old-fashioned ghost is a rarity in WEIRD TALES, but here is one that

         satisfies all requirements—a fascinating tale of Jules de Grandin.

THE MAN WITH A THOUSAND LEGS, by Frank B. Long, Jr.

        A horror-tale of the sea—a bizarre and fantastic story about a strange and
        terrible monster—a gripping tale, which should not be read at night.

FLY ISLAND, by B. Wallis

        Gigantic insects flashed through the air and stung to death all men or
        animals that approached their lair—a tale of terrifying adventures in the
        jungles of a Pacific island.

THE DEAD WAGON, by Greye La Spina

        A short but powerful tale of the curse that took the first-born son in
        each generation of Lord Melverson’s family—a ghost-tale of shuddery
        horror.

THE MOON MENACE, by Edmond Hamilton

        A terrifying prospect faced a darkened world—man gone forever, a lightless
        earth spinning blindly through the heavens, and the moon men its masters
        from pole to pole.

SATAN’S FIDDLE, by George Malcolm-Smith

        An unusual tale of the cataclysmic power of music—the death chord—and
        hideous dissonances that can bring a great building crashing into ruins.

They Thought I W&s A Wfeak Sister
-But I Took Their Bwath Away!

ALL of a sudden the office was very quiet, as some-
times happens for an instant or two, and a few
words reached me. "Oh, he won’t dare kick,”
the manager was saying, “he’s a pretty weak sister.”
Mechanically X went on with my work, wondering
vaguely who the weak sister could be. A new man
had just been hired for our de-
partment and desks were being
moved to make room for him. A
minute later I looked up and saw
the chief clerk standing at my
side. “Bob,” he crisply ordered,

"move your desk back in that
corner, I want this space for
the new assistant I’ve hired.”

Then he turned and strode away.

  I gulped and wilted down into
my chair. I was the wieak sis-
ter ! And I was actually being
demoted! The new man was be-
ing hired for my place! This
was my reward for all my hard
work—this was how I won out
by waiting patiently for my turn
to be promoted. I had even con-
gratulated myself on my close-
lipped, reserved manner —I
thought I was showing strength
of character by sticking to my
work and not trying to push
myself—to show off.

complete plan for rearranging our department—stat-

ing and forceful way. I actually took their breath away—they
were so amazed that they gave mo
full power to carry out my ideas!

 Soon I had won salary increases,
 promotion, popularity, power. And I
 accomplished all this by developing the
 natural power of speech possessed by
 everyone, but cultivated by so few—
 by simply spending 15 minutes a day
 in the privacy of my own home on
 this most fascinating subject.

1.	A Voice from the Dead

MANY years had passed since
last I had seen my old inn-
keeper friend, Pierre Gar-
nier, in far-away France.

  Disinclination, perhaps bom of
fear, perhaps mere laziness and sloth,
had kept me long near home. Travel
ceased to beckon, for as one grows
older he is ready to sit quietly by the
fire and think, dwelling more in the
past than either the present or the
future.

Once I was cursed with itching feet
which had carried me into strange
places, but now they seemed content
to rest easily in soft warm slippers,
6

the while my fancy rebuilt old scenes
and faces in tfye glowing embers.

Since the news of Pierre’s death
in far-away France, which had ar-
rived simultaneously with the curious
Latin work, written on human skin,
which I have described in the transla-
tion that was made public some
months ago, I had lapsed into apathy.

  Pierre had been the last of my
friends. Some correspondence had
passed between us lately, but never a
word in regard to his amazing ances-
tor, Wladislaw Brenryk of Ponkert,
the werewolf whose diluted blood
coursed in Garnier’s veins.

  That was one reason why I had
never returned to the inn. Where
lives the man who can converse calm-
ly with son of warlock or vampire?
Surely I am not the man who finds
it possible, and so I closed the chap-
ter, as I thought, and went away.
But still I handled with a fearful de-
THE RETURN OF THE MASTER

light the thought that once a thing of
other spaces had been so close to me
that I had hobnobbed in ignorance
with the descendant of a fiend, and I
surrounded myself with weird and
occult literature of many kinds. I
steeped myself in lycanthropical lore,
I drowned my common sense in fan-
tastic legend, myth, and fable, I be-
came a recluse, living alone with my
books and a single servant.

  One evening late in March, I was
speculating idly upon the peculiar
recurrence in a -frork on philology
that I had just finished, of the name
Garnier, Grenier, or Gangere, which
the writer had connected often with
the loup-garou, or werewolf.

  “What a peculiar coincidence,” I
thought, “that Pierre’s surname
should be one of these! I could tell
that writer something that would
interest him much,” for I had not
formerly revealed Pierre’s name in
full.

  While I still smiled, on the heels of
the furtive thought came a tapping
on the door, and I heard Parker
shuffling down the hall. Soon he re-
turned, in his hand an envelope of
yellow.

  “A telegram, sir,” he said, re-
spectfully. “Willie Thoms brought
it from the town, as the station agent
believed it was urgent.”

  “Very well,” I said, extending my
hand for the message. “Give the boy
a quarter, and let me alone,” for I
disliked being disturbed and Parker
kiL^.v this well.

  As he closed the study door, I tore
open the envelope and found that
which led to the most horrid adven-
ture I had ever yet encountered in
fact or fiction. It began:

Monsieur M-:

  You will know without names who this
is from. If you would aid an old friend in
the direst of peril come at once to the inn
that you know of. I feel that only you
can save. In God’s name, old friend, come
at once; a week’s delay may be too late.

P. G.

  My first emotion was one of glad-
ness. Pierre lived, and I should see
him again. For the first time in
months I felt cheery. But on re-
reading the cablegram, which had
been relayed by wire from the ter-
minal, I was struck by the agonized
tone of the message, so foreign to
Pierre’s usually placid demeanor.
Pierre was in danger, I was needed at
once! Again I read, “a week’s, de-
lay may be too late.”

  I rang for Parker, and when he
came in sight at the end of the hall,
called, “Pack my trunks at once. I
leave on the morning train.” With-
out waiting for a reply or question I
shut the door, and prepared myself
for bed.

2.	The Man on the Train

It is not necessary to burden this
narrative with minute details of
the journey, for it will be lengthy
enough at best. Suffice it then to
mention only that the ride to Boston
was without event, as also was the
trip to Paris. I chafed and fretted,
spending most of the time as far in
the bow as I could place myself, as
though I would be nearer to the jour-
ney’s end than any other. I was first
down the gang-plank, and in an
hour’s time was on the train, and on
the last stage toward my goal.

  It is necessary to change trains
about ten miles out of Paris, and
although I had a whole compartment
to myself on the first train, the sec-
ond time I was not so fortunate. I
ran down the platform, but all the
compartments were closed, signifying
that no space remained, and as the
wheels commenced to turn I dis-
covered a hand that beckoned from a
door. As it reached me I flung in
my grip, scrambled in myself and
shut the door.

  There were two occupants already
in the carriage, a slender woman
gowned in black, who wore a veil that
8

WEIRD TALES

concealed her features, and a small
dapper little man about whom there
was something repellent. I sensed
animosity the moment I entered, and
felt a surge of dislike in return. But
he smiled and nodded politely enough
in a smooth oily manner, saying
slowly as though he were choosing
his words, “You—are—agile—Mon-
sieur.”

  If his person was repugnant to me,
more so was his voice. I made some
conventional reply, and pretended an
acute interest in my paper. Seeing
that I was not to be drawn into con-
versation, he chose other methods of
amusement.

  Now it has always been my code to
keep strictly out of others’ affairs.
One can not be positive what are an-
other’s motives in performing a cer-
tain act. Hidden influences are at
work upon that person that are im-
possible for us even to dream of, and
interference may be not only im-
pertinent and unjust, but also dan-
gerous to ourselves. Such it was in
this case, but not wholly, for although
I might have been spared some mo-
ments of mental anguish and terror,
the end would have been much the
same. I did not realize the true na-
ture of my foe or I should never have
left America. There I should have
been safe, for there is a great ex-
panse of moving water between that
land and France.

  As I sat reading my paper I could
sec that the woman was restless. She
was continually glancing at me, as I
could tell by the movement of her
head, although the heavy veil hid her
face. Apparently she and the little
man were companions, though I re-
ceived the impression that it was not
friendship, but another bond that
held them together.

  The man addressed himself to her
in words so intentionally offensive
that I refuse to include them in my
narrative. I half laid down my pa-

per to interfere, but an imperceptible
gesture of her hand warned me that
it was none of my affair, and I re-
sumed my reading. But I kept close
watch of his actions.

  Now he attempted to seize her
hand, which she allowed him to do,
but as he moved nearer to her, plac-
ing his knee familiarly, so that it
pressed hers, she shrank away as far
as she could to the end of the seat,
and I felt that circumstances called
for action.

  I laid down my paper, rose, bowed
as courteously as might be in the
swaying carriage and inquired polite-
ly, “Is this man offending you, Ma-
dame?”

  “No, Monsieur.she said in a low
tone. “He is my brother.”

  The little man leaped to his feet,
yellow with passion.

  “You lie, you slut!” he cried, and
struck her in the face with his open
hand. Turning to me he began, “Sir,
I will thank you to mind your own
affairs,” but with the cowardly blow
I leapt, and we rolled together on the
floor.

  The woman screamed as we fought.

  With amazing strength he clutched
my throat; my mouth opened, and
my tongue protruded. Strange lights
flared before my eyes, and I knew
that I had met a power greater than
my own.

  Summoning my waning strength I
struck again and again, but my hard-
est blows were nothing against ' my
conqueror. Finally I gained my feet,
face black, and with a roaring as of
many waters in my ears. I staggered
across the carriage blindly, and fight-
ing for air crashed against the side.

  Faintly through the darkening
haze I saw the woman move toward
us, felt cold air rush by my face, as
the door swung open, felt tugging at
the hands that throttled, and sudden-
ly my enemy released his hold. With
the last of my power I smote at the

little man, felt his teeth pierce my
hand, and backward he plunged
through the open door, rebounded
once and lay quiet, soon far behind.

  The woman lifted the veil, hesi-
tated with her face averted, then
seemingly with a great effort turned
toward me and boldly looked into my
face.

  I searched her features with great
disappointment., When one has
plumed himself upon being gallant
and chivalrous, it is indeed sad to find
that the one for whom he has fought
is neither young nor beautiful. Al-
though I have long passed the prime
of life, still I have a keen eye for
beauty.

  Not long could she withstand my
gaze.

  She expectantly eyed me for a mo-
ment as though, most strangely I
thought, I was to show some sign of
recognition, but the face, seamed by
wrinkles, yellow and blotched, was en-
tirely unfamiliar to me. Then she
turned and watched the flitting land-
scape that passed so swiftly by.

3.	Regina’s Story

T was haunted by a vague sense of
^ the familiar after a bit, something
so indefinite that it seemed only a
fancy, something that eluded me in a
most aggravating fashion.

  While I still watched the small oval
of withered cheek that I could yet
see, down a wrinkle, as from a dried-
up creek courses the spring floods,
flowed a drop of something bright
and wet, followed by another and an-
other that glittered in the fading sun-
light. And I became aware that very
quietly she wept.

  I touched her shoulder.

  “Madame,” I said, “do not cry, I
beg. I meant only to preserve you
from annoyance. Surely this regret-
table occurrence was not of my mak-
ing. Never would I have interfered

had I thought that it was not your
wish. Shall I stop the train, so that
we may return and search for him?”
And I reached for the cord.

  With a strength that was ferocious,
she pulled me down into my seat
again, and held me there.

  “Stop the train? Rather pray that
it may never stop, and pray to all the
gods you know that he may be dead
or dying.. It is not for that I weep.
Could I but know that he was mashed
to pulp these would be tears of joy!”
she cried. “No, my sorrow is from
another cause. I can see in your face
that you know me not, but I know
you well, and once I was not a
stranger to you. Look into my face
if you will and tell me with your lips
that which your eyes already have
told me!”

  Desperately she strained back the
loose skin on her temples and fore-
head with her palms. The wrinkles
smoothed out a bit, but that was all.
I was, though pitying her evident dis-
tress, compelled to say, “I do not re-
member that we have ever met. ’ ’ _

  She beat upon the window-sill with
her gloved hand, then buried her
head in her arms, and burst into a
storm of tears. Between her sobs
came broken words.

 “Old! Old! And I was so
young! How horrible I am! How
changed! Only eighteen, and I look
a hundred. Once you knew me well,
and I—I worshiped you. I was very
young, and you were kind to the little
girl that served you. Have you for-
gotten Regina Noel that waited upon
the tables at the Blue Falcon ? ’ ’

  “Regina!” I gasped, scrutinizing
that haggard face. Indeed I had
known the little waitress, but she had
been a child of thirteen when I had
last seen her, and now this hag
claimed to be a young girl.

  “Impossible,” I said. “There is
no resemblance.”
10

WEIRD TALES

  There was silence, and the train
clacked on, rail joint after joint
speeding by beneath us.

  Up she flung her head, defiant.
“Yes, I was Regina, now I know
not what I am, save that a devil has
me for its slave! ’ ’

  “The Devil!” My lips shaped the
words.

  *	* That It is! The Black One! The
Enemy! He with whom you fought
Why, oh why did you stop him?
Can’t you see that it was a plot to
kill you? It is a miracle that you
escaped; he has planned this thing for
months to bring you into his power,
and now you have defeated his plans
in the first struggle. But it will not
be long. He has got me, and he will
have you. I feel him following fast!”
“Hush, my child.” I soothed and
patted the heaving shoulder in the
traditional clumsy manner of man
soothing his women folk. ‘ ‘ That man
is dead. He will not trouble you
again. ’ ’

  “Oh!” she cried: “it is not the
insult that troubles me; I have known
far worse than that. It is your dread-
ful fate that causes me to fear. He
has dragged you to him over half a
world to gain his ends, and you prate
over my troubles.”

  “I do not understand,” I said. “I
came in answer to a letter from my
friend Pierre, asking for help. ’ ’

  She looked up wofully. “I wrote
that message,” she replied. “Can you
guess who forced me?” Another
paroxysm of sobs racked her frail
body.

  She did not resist when I put my
arm around her.

  “Tell me about it, Regina,” I
begged. “I will help you.”

  “Nothing can help us now,” she
answered in a desolate tone. “We
are lost, but I will tell you. It was
five years ago, you went away and
did not come again. Pierre watched

and waited, but you never came, and
I wished that you would return, for
you were always so good to me. You
remember how you would not let the
cook beat me when I spilled the
wine ? ’ ’

  I nodded.

  ‘ ‘ So for three years we waited, and
then Pierre died. The manner of his
passing was dreadful. It came so
slowly that before we realized that he
was weaker the sickness had him.
Every day he moved more feebly un-
til one night he sat in his armchair
by the fire and could not get up
again. We had to carry him to bed,
and he never left it.

 “He was brave, a noble one.
Although he knew what ailed him he
never told. I think he tried to
shield us, and partly he succeeded.
I was the one he confided in.

  “ ‘Regina,’ he called, and I came.
‘I am going tonight. I feel it. But
before I leave you, listen. In yon-
der drawer is a book; bring it to me. ’

  “I did so, and he said, ‘Regina,
you must not read this. There is
meat in here too strong for you.
When I am dead, send it to my friend
across the sea who fears a poor old
man, dying all alone. Write that I
loved him, and wish him well, but
tell him not that I died like this.’

  “Then he raised his poor feeble
hand to his throat, and pulled a
bandage away.

  “ ‘Look close, girl,’ he whispered.
‘What do you see?’

  “ ‘Two small wounds,’ I said.
‘Have you cut yourself?’

  “ ‘No, dear,’ he answered. ‘Be
brave and not afraid, for much de-
pends on you, and I can trust no one
else. I am ridden by a demon every
night, and this is the mark of the
vampire. ’

  “Somehow I was not afraid. Per-
haps I did not understand his whole
meaning, and he went on:
THE RETURN OF THE MASTER

11

  “ ‘Tonight I am to die. I feel it
plainly., Do not weep for me, dear.
I am old, I have lived, I shall die, but
after I am dead’—his voice became
stern—‘ do you follow my instruc-
tions without fail!

  “ ‘I am the descendant of a man
who, four hundred years ago, became
a werewolf. While planning revolt
against his cruel master he was be-
trayed, and was forced to kill his
own wife as a warning to the other
members of the pack. His baby
daughter was rescued from him, and
later on all of the beasts were trapped
and killed except the leader. Down
the ages has his seed persisted,
always menaced by the still living
vampire, and out of each generation
has one been taken in payment for
the man’s treachery to his master.

  “ ‘So it has been revealed to me,
and I am the last of the line. I speak
from the grave, and in warning. Tell
my old friend that I am dead, but tell
him nothing else, lest he should come
hither and fall into the monster’s
power.

  “ ‘I am going to ask a dreadful
thing for a girl to do, but I know you
are brave enough to obey unquestion-
ing, much braver than these fools
that work here seeing nothing but
their weekly pay. ’

  “ ‘I am, sire,’ I said proudly.

  “ ‘I knew it,’ he smiled wanly.
‘Hark! You will go now, write as I
have told you, and mail the book and
letter at once. When you return I
shall be dead. Go to the priest, tell
him all that I have told you under
the seal of secrecy, and unless he does
certain things I shall become a vam-
pire after death, and shall live again,
a monstrous thing. You and the
priest must open the grave after I
have been buried. Sever my head
from my body; fill my mouth, nostrils
and ears with garlic. Upon each eye lay
a silver cross, and cfrive a silver nail
through my heart. Then return the

earth to the grave again and upon it
pour boiling water and vinegar.

  “ ‘If you do this, the good God will
bless you as I do, but if you fail, my
curse shall be upon you! Now go,
and do as I have said.’

  “I left the room, wrote the letter
and mailed it to you with the book
unread. The Latin is strange to me,”
she admitted, with a touch of uncon-
scious humor.

  “When I returned to report my
mission completed, I entered the room
and saw that Pierre was dead as he
had predicted, and there was another
present, sitting on the bed. It was
the man you fought with, and now
you know why I am here. I failed in
my pi’omise, I am a slave, and you
and Pierre are lost.

  “The monster promised me great
things, saying, ‘ Regina! Queen thou
art in name, queen thou shalt be over
my loyal subjects that I shall soon
secure. ’

  “Merciful God in Heaven,” she
cried, leaping to her feet. “Is this
the face of a queen? Am I in queen-
ly garb?”

  I pulled her down beside me. “Go
on, ” I said huskily.

  “The inn was closed after the fu-
neral and never opened again. The
Master lives there with one other,
and people shun the place as haunt-
ed. He searched for the book, but
never questioned me till you pub-
lished the story.* Why did you do
it ? Why did you ? How he obtained
a copy I have no idea, but he has
one, and in vengeance he swore your
death. He has sworn to start a devil
pack with you, and to add to it until
all France is humbled by him.

  “Sire, Hell is loose today, and
there is no hope. I cabled you under
his orders, and you know the rest.
Now if you can escape, do so, but
think no more of poor Regina!”

4.	Pursuit

Che was pale and bloodless. I was
^ about to speak when suddenly she
whispered. ‘‘Hush, do you hear it?”

  I listened, but heard only the
train noises, and so replied, but she
impatiently gestured for silence.

  She opened the door, and together
we looked back. Nothing was in sight,
but she said, “I feel him coming.
Monsieur, are you armed?” And
then, “Too late, too late,” as she
pointed.

  Far down the track behind us flut-
tered a thing monstrously formed,
growing yet more huge as it reeled
down the sky after the train. In
shape it resembled a bat, but one of
such tremendous size as has surely
not been seen before, since man first
dragged himself out of the mud and
began to breathe air with lungs.

  Rapidly it overhauled the rushing
train, soaring high over trees, build-
ings and wires, slanting down again,
dipping with effortless speed along
the level lands, and gaining, always
gaining, as it rocketed across the
fields that we were passing.

  Soon it paralleled our course,
passed our coach and flapped on-
ward toward the head of the train.

  Passing around a curve, the train
bent into a crescent, and from our
window we could see the creature dip
toward the windows of each coach,
hold the position, and drop back to
the next, searching for something or
someone, and I did not need Regina’s
horror-stricken moan, “It is He!” to
inform me for whom the monster
searched.

  The train straightened out, and we
could no longer see ahead, but down
the wind came shrill chirpings, almost
too high in the scale of sound to be
heard. Liquidly sweet, ari'owy sharp
and piercing, with a note of inquiry
in the pitch, the stridulation came
louder and nearer, and we were
seen.

I felt the girl cringe against me.

Beneath my protecting arm her body
stiffened, and muscles set rigid.. I
was no less afraid than she, but it is
the man’s part in times of stress to
hide fear from his women folk, so I
patted her shoulder reassuringly and
smiled. There was no mirth in the
grimace!

  It was four times the size of the
fox-bat, largest known of the species,
that I have seen in Java, but in many
ways the two were similar. It
possessed the same pointed muzzle,
instead of the fluted nose-leaf that
makes most bats hideously alien to
one’s conception of a face’s appear-
ance. Whiskers were present, on
either side of the nostrils, whose flar-
ing red contrasted strangely with the
jet-black appendages.

  Its six-foot body was bare in spots,
otherwise covered with a mangy,
dirty brown hair, shading to ash-gray
along its under side. Mud caked in
the matted fur, and not yet dry,
made it seem more appalling.

  Ten-foot membranes buffeted the
air as train and terror drove on to-
gether. The whistle screamed for a
crossing, and as if startled by the
sound, the thing turned its head and
stared at us again.

  Imagine a bat’s head the size of
a small tub, and you have its dimen-
sions. Picture if you can a mouth
that mowed and gibbered at us, dis-
closing sharp white teeth, and above
it eyes of evil in which lurked things
unutterable.

  Oddly there came into my mind
that perhaps this was the very bat
that had been lost in Hell, now newly
released with something of that un-
earthly horror lingering in its eyes.
I imagined the things it must have
seen fluttering down those murky
aisles, lost in the choking smoke,
soiled and scorched by the lurid
flames until it beat with throbbing
wings into the free and purer air
once more, with memories that noth-
ing could ever wipe away!
THE RETURN OF THE MASTER

13

  What curious things come into our
heads at the oddest times and most
peculiar places!

  Again the whistle shrieked, and
with it mingled a most bitter wailing
from outside. Suddenly the winged
beast zoomed upward, overshadowing
us with its mighty membranes, and
blackness rushed to meet us. As we
entered the tunnel I saw the creature
rise almost perpendicularly to sur-
mount the hill that we were passing
through.

  Regina shuddered as though re-
leased from a spell, and I recalled the
power that had held the Hungarian
numb in the sleigh when the were-
wolves pursued him along the river.
With the thought came action.
Although I had felt nothing of this
paralysis I knew that I might be
next, and it would be then too late
to do what I had in mind. I opened
my bag, garments flew over the com-
partment, as I searched for my auto-
matic which I usually carry while
traveling abroad. As I closed my
hand on its chill metal we burst into
the twilight. The dull red sun was
cut in half by the hill we had pierced,
and against its ominous glare a black
dot flickered for a second.

  We waited. Soon we saw our pur-
suer near the carriage. One gigantic
wing finger scratched the window-
pane, and while its wing was raised
for another stroke and its filthy body
was clearly exposed I poured six bul-
lets into the junction of wing and
trunk.

  To the music of tinkling glass and
eldritch squeaks of pain he danced in
air, rose high, somersaulted over and
over, and thudded to earth in a lash-
ing huddle of leathery membrane.

  The train rushed on. I hugged the
girl beside me in ecstasy. “He is
gone! The Master is dead!” I cried.

  “No one will ever say that,” Re-
gina replied. “You can not kill him.
Look!” And she drew her head back

from the broken pane with dull wo
written on her haggard face.

  I stared back, and far behind
bobbed a black shape like a large dog,
running with a limp, but following
with great speed.

  Over plowed fields he ran, dipping
out of sight and reappearing again
farther in our wake, still coming on
with the speed of the swallow.

  And the sun went down.

5.	Surprizes

The night was creeping in upon us
when we left the train, for
although I knew that Pierre was
truly dead I dreamed that perhaps I
might avenge him. How this was to
be accomplished I had no idea, but I
felt certain that if the Master had
gone to such labors to drag me across
half a world he would not allow me
to slip from him thus easily.

  Still less did I know what to guard
against, for the cunning of this be-
ing was beyond my power to compre-
hend. So, resolving to be constantly
upon the alert, I strolled down the
road toward the village, apparently
at ease, but instead a quivering
bundle of nerves, with every sense
exploring the literal and mental
blackness before me.

  Regina walked at my side, her
hand within the crook of my arm.
Although she pleaded with me to
hurry I knew it was useless. If I was
to tilt with the Powers of Evil that
night, as well in one place as another,
and I fancied myself well armed.

  So we slowly neared the village.
Suddenly Regina stopped and
gripped my arm.

  “Listen,” she whispered. “Do you
hear it ? He is coming! ’ ’

  At first I heard nothing, but soon
came a soft pattering of feet on the
other side of the hedge that grew at
the left of the road.
14

WEIRD TALES

  I could not see clearly in the dim
light, but I had the impression that
something was eyeing us through the
hedge. Watching carefully I saw a
dim shape bulk out from the shrub-
bery, and I knew from the old manu-
script what it was.

  My reading had given me knowl-
edge to cope with this emergency. I
reached down and picked up two
sticks, while Regina cowered behind
me. Holding them crossed I ad-
vanced resolutely upon the thing.

 “Oh, vampire! Werewolf!” I
cried. “Gaze upon this and fear.
Behold this cross and tremble! Here
is the Lord our God who died for us
upon the tree! I conjure you in the
name of the White Christ to vanish
and trouble this land no more.”

  I confess I can not understand
what followed. This incantation, so
claim the books, was a sure charm,
and never failed to work in many
cases in which it was used. But in
this case it did fail.

  The beast launched himself at me,
but rebounded from the hedge with a
baffled raging cry.

  In that moment I knew fear. Still
I was thankful for my books, for one
truth was holding good. I knew he
could not pass the hedge.

  But in my long absence what had
befallen the hedge? My recollection
told me that it extended around the
field, almost to the village, but how
had he entered? Somewhere there
was a gap, but if we could reach the
village before he could retrace his
steps we were safe for the night, and
the next day I would enlist the
powers of holy men against this child
of hell, and blast him back to whence
he came.

  I did not doubt that the exorcism
was efficient, but perhaps I had made
some mistake. Perhaps he was ar-
mored against minor spells, and if so
I was defenseless. So thinking I hur-
ried on. Life for more than myself
was at stake if I failed.

  Could I reach safety in time?

  As we began to near the village I
searched busily through my memory
for further exorcisms, and one that
the books had claimed to be of great
efficacy I determined to try.

  Again I paused, faced the hedge,
this time tracing the sign of the cross
in the air, and repeated in a loud
voice:

  “I exorcise thee, unclean spirit, in
the name of Jesus Christ. Tremble,

0	Satan, enemy of the faith, thou foe'
of mankind who has brought death
into the world, who has deprived men
of life, and has rebelled against
justice! Thou seducer of mankind,
thou root of evil, thou source of
avarice, discord and envy, disappear
forever!’ ’

  A scream from Regina, and a dark
shape plunging at the hedge was the
only result of this curse, and with a
frightful horror I realized the truth.

  The power that, fought against me
was so anciently evil, so horribly un-
natui’al, that only otlier magic as
ancient as itself could prevail against
it. Either that or the God or Gods
that rule us are indifferent to human
fates.

  We hurried on. Along the muddy
road we passed, slipping in the muck
of a much-traveled country highway.

1	heard, as an undertone to our noisy
splashes, three steps and a gap, a re-
current rhythm that kept pace with
us on the other side of the hedge.

  A stifled whine of eagerness that
held a note of furious thwarted de
sire now brought the girl near to
collapse. She became a dead weight
upon me, and I could go no farther.

  Vainly I urged the danger of our
position. She could not or would not
stir. The need for desperate haste
was terrible, but she seemed very re-
mote and unconscious of me or her
surroundings. Finally I seized her
by the shoulders and shook her might-
ily, crying I know not what, and then
she spoke. It was a very wee, very
THE RETURN OF THE MASTER

15

faint little voice, and although her
sad, piteously marred face was only a
few inches from mine, I had to bend
nearer to hear at all.

  She spoke, and the words were
worlds away, “Don’t—stay! Some-
thing—I don’t know what, is hap-
pening-’ ’

  Then as she leaned against me I
felt her body stiffen, she leapt away
from me, her fingers widely spread
as though pushing something from
her, and Screamed, “No! No! Ah,
Master—not that!” And then to me,

‘4 Run! ’ ’ And with the word she be-
gan tearing frantically at her
clothing.

  A glimpse I caught of snow-white
shoulders that belied that aged face,
and then I turned and ran, fled
stumbling through the dark, slipping
and falling in the mud, clawing my
way through the mire, praying for a
light ahead. For in my mind was
coursing a wild, maddening sentence
of the long-dead Brenryk’s story:
“When my body changed into a wolf
I had all the terror of a wild beast
for encumbering clothing! ’ ’

  Behind me—thank God it was far
behind!—there shrilled a long, high
keening, a wailing shriek that held
within it triumph and—despair!

  I had not followed that road for
years. I am old, the mud was cling-
ing and heavy, and many times I fell.
I heard no sounds across the hedge,
but the silence was more menacing
than a snarl.

  Where was the Master, and upon
whal business was he absent ?

  The lights of the village began to
gleam through the trees and across
the fields, but as I picked myself out
of the muck again I knew that I
should never reach them, for leaping
down the lane came something as
large as a collie, running with a
rabbitlike lope.

  I swung up my gun; it spat dryly
once, and was silent. The beast
stopped short, then came on more

slowly. I dared not turn my back,
so while I menaced with the empty
weapon I backed cautiously down the
road. It came nearer. I shouted
loudly for help, which seemed to
frighten it, but only for a moment.

  Then I recognized my surround-
ings. I threw the heavy automatic,
heard it thud on flesh, turned and
ran for the building at the roadside.

  Behind me, racing feet that fell
faster than the throbs of my wildly
pounding heart. Before me, the closed
door of the deserted inn, and as I
reached the step a lurching creature
charged from the side, and all three
of us struck the door together!

  It crashed in. I was thrown on the
floor, the beasts having struck each
other at an angle blocked the door-
way, each struggling to be first!

  I kicked the swinging door from
where I lay. It slammed between
me and those slavering jaws. I think
that never before in all my life had
I heard such a welcome sound as the
clicking of that latch.

6.	A Night at on Inn

Silence—inside the inn, silence and
a haunting dread. For there were
those that prowled without. I held
my breath and listened. There was
that odd rhythm of the injured crea-
ture, three steps grouped close to-
gether, a gap, felt rather than heard,
and again three.

  A rain of light pattering footfalls
that passed like a wind about the
grounds, and like the wind there were
dolorous wailing* also.

  Interwoven into the fabric of ter-
ror these two were weaving came an-
other thread of sound. A heavy
pound of unshod feet that were fall-
ing dull and lifeless upon the earth.

  My breath hissed loudly through
my teeth, and I lost the newer
sounds, but within me I knew,
although I could not say how or why,
that the being that tramped leadenly
outside was beyond mortal passions,
16

and the weapons that men use against
one another would not prevail against
it.

  And I suspected, nay, was almost
certain that I knew what it was that
strode automatonlike around the inn,
and who it once had been!

 The two that prowled were now
three, and as though this had given
them confidence they bunched to-
gether and struck the old door, a
mass of fury. It creaked, gave, but
held! And round again they flew.

  Now, curiously enough, my mind
perhaps slipping away from this peril
(as I have read it is like to do in
times of stress, one becoming calm
and poised, who before was frantic),
of a sudden my thought spanned
time and space to old Hadley, far
across the seas in Puritan New Eng-
land.

 I remembered how in the early
days of that struggling colony, so be-
set by foes and forces, a little maid in
her sleep heard tramping in the snow
outside the palisade, and when awake
the march did still persist. How the
fear flew like pestilence through the
fort, till all were awake and heard a
steady tramp that passed and re-
passed around the building, till
women sobbed in unison with the
steady thud of marching feet. How
a certain holy man, the Reverend
Abner Kelton, did order lights to be
brought, and Hadley became a blaz-
ing radiance through every window
and loophole. Hymns were sung and
prayers were voiced and with the
dawn came silence. The people of
Hadley saw that about the fort the
snow stretched like a frozen sea to the
forest, unsullied by print of foot.

  Now, I had my own opinions as to
the value of prayers against these
creatures that besieged me, remem-
bering well the unexpected result of
my exorcism. I had never a voice for
singing, and the hymn that seemed
appropriate to the occasion was
Brighten the Corner Where You

Are. I had forgotten the words to
this, but I lived up to the spirit of the
title at least.

  There was no sueh thing in this
village as electricity, near though it
was to Paris, and Pierre had always
depended upon oil lamps and candles.
With the light of a match I searched
the gutted rooms, from which every-
thing of value had been stolen, and
found four stubs of candle, the long-
est of which was well under two
inches, and a small lamp half full of
oil. With these I hoped to bridge the
night till dawn.

  I felt easier at once, such is the
effect of light in dispelling the unseen
terrors that haunt us all. To you
that read this it will seem strange
that I thought so belatedly of lights.
You may contend that the normal re-
action of a man beleaguered in sueh a
manner would be toward unhampered
vision. Granted, but I was not
normal. I was no longer a reasoning
being like yourself, but a quivering
bundle of nerves, most horridly
atremble at the sound of paws pad-
ding about in the night. I could
hardly think two consecutive
thoughts on the same subject, until
welling from the subconscious came
the half-forgotten story read so long
ago, with its curious analogy to the
present.

  After the lights were lit. I felt more
secure, and examined the fastenings
of the doors and windows. The glass
was gone, but there were heavy wood-
en shutters barred across the spaces.
Two swung opQn and the floor was
covered with dry leaves that had
blown in through the openings. These
I secured, noticing as I did so that in
one pile there was a hollow where
something had laired.

  The place reeked with a sickening,
musky odor, and I felt nauseated.
The rear door was rotten, and the
lock that held it was rusted.

  My situation was desperate, for
there were no weapons, nor anything
THE RETURN OF THE MASTER

17

that could be used as such. The house
had been systematically looted, it was
plain, and I found myself in much
the same plight as had been Brenryk,
the Hungarian—defenseless.

   But I consoled myself with the
thought that I was much better pre-
pared to cope with my enemies than
he had been. Was I not armed by
the knowledge of the ages? What
though my exorcisms had failed in
my most desperate need? The older
ja.nd more potent lore had prevailed,
and I knew with certainty that I was
safe while the light lasted. It is writ-
ten in the ancient Persian hymn to
Ormuzd (pure spirit of light) that

   “Those that follow Ahriman
      Shall fear him!

    Those who walk with me

Shall by my power conquer him!”

   So I waited for the dawn while the
candles flickered, though the air was
very still.

   There were night noises yet, some
of evil portent, and others that
seemed innocent. The building was
full of creaking joints, and small
sounds that a too eager ear might
translate as creeping things almost
ready to pounce resolved themselves
into natural noises after all.

   Still the pattering persisted, and
that dreadful sodden pounding of
heavy feet came now from the rear
of the inn, and again lumbered by the
door. Then came an ominous hush,
and I sensed that the storm was about
to break.

   A light stir overhead brought dust
sifting down from the decaying plas-
ter. Simultaneously with the sound
of someone walking in the room above
there was a mighty ripping crash as
the rotten door rent from its hinges
and thundered down!

   Over it, as it crumbled into punk,
limped a slavering beast; and behind
it a hulking brute, human in form
but expressionless and clumsy, moved
woodenly through the doorway.

   The dark beast came with a lurch-

ing leap, but when it entered the
circle of light, flinched and cried out •
throatily. Still it pressed forward,
but I could see that every movement
gave it pain.

  While it came, the man behind it
moved also, eyes fixed in a kind of
dumb adoration upon the Master, but
as he gradually slowed and stopped,
not daring to enter more fully, the
newcomer halted also, and together
they retreated into the sheltering
night.

  I was physically and mentally sick
at the sight, for in that bloated evil
face, brutalized by the filthiest vices
and seared with the seal of corrup-
tion, I recognized the dearest friend
I had ever known, Pierre Garnier, a
living dead man!

  I stepped back beside the lights
and collided with a soft warm body
behind me that moved.

  My heart almost stopped. I whirled,
ready to fight for my life, and Regina
stood there bravely facing me. She
was swathed in a heavy portiere from
one of the upper rooms, and her piti-
ful eyes begged dumbly for protec-
tion. I took her hand in mine and
'together we faced the foe.

7.	Shadows All!

XTow the wind through the doorway
■*- ^ flickered the candles even more,
and Life and Death played a game
upon the walls'with shadows as their
pawns, and the stake two human
souls!

  It was a scene that pen can do no
more than outline. A brush wielded
by one who habitually deals with
masses of color in his art might have
captured that eery moment, but
words are too inflexible. Black and
White Magic were battling, Light and
Shadow were at war, and the prize
for which they strove awaited the
outcome with no power either to fight
or flee!

  Shapeless forms crawled upon the
18

WEIRD TALES

walls, darting at us but retreating to
their corners with reluctant squirm.
Night was welling in through the
open door. Darkness and all the evil
that is held within it crouched just
inside the threshold.

 The Master resumed his human
form again, his left arm hanging
limply at his side. The shoulder was
a mass of blood, stiffening in the cool
breeze.

  As the candles flickered, horrid
phantoms hurtled across the ceiling,
and close in pursuit rippling banners
rushed. Banners of Light, fiercely
intolerant of evil, scattering that tat-
tered host of Night. The little points
of yellow waved wildly, but the lamp,
protected by a glass chimney, burned
steady and true.

  As the shadows raced upon the wall
those in the dark wavered, now
edging toward us under the protec-
tion of the sable wings that were
spread over them, now wincing back
from the demon-frightening light,
when the wicks flared up once more.

  I watched one candle-stub that was
almost gone. “When that dies,” I
thought, “will they rush us? Will
the remaining lights be strong enough
to defend?”

  It burned lower and more fitfully.
Thei’e was only a rim of wax like a
ring unbumed. Then the wick fell
into the melted wax, and the flame
expired. The shadows surged in, and
the watchers took one step nearer,
that was all.

  They dared not come closer while
the light lasted, but it was failing
fast, and the writhing coils of night
seemed to know, and ravened silently
for our lives.

  We waited—what else was there to
do? We could not flee elsewhere, we
could not defend ourselves, there was
nowhere to hide that they could not
reach us. So while the frisking phan-
toms danced stealthily about us, and
the dreadful prowlers leered, as
bravely as might be we waited.

  I looked at the girl and she smiled
back at me, touching a bruise on her
cheek that was beginning to blacken.
The realization was forcibly brought
home to me that this was the mark
where the gun had struck.

  I pitied her, but she misunderstood
my look.

  “Do not fear me,” she said. “He
can not change me now. I am resist-
ing his power, and he is trying hard-
est to beat down your guard. Sub-
mit and he will call you to him, where
he can reach you! Resist, and we
may yet escape him! ’ ’

  I fought back the growing lassitude
that was overcoming me. How I
longed for rest!

 “Sleep!” I was commanded.
“Fool, to pit yourself against me!
Rest and forget the world! Come to
me and I will give you rest,” the
wheedling voice insisted.

  Leadenly I stepped forward. An-
other candle died, and my enemy
came to meet me.

  Then it seemed that invisible hands
raised a barrier between us. Although
I pressed forward, and the third
flame went out, I was firmly urged
back against the wall and held there.

  Nothing could be seen, but the air
seemed palpitant with life. Life that
exulted joyously in the pleasure of
existing, life that pulsed with a
definite purpose that would not be
denied. Regina felt it, and her old-
young face looked piteously into
mine, and with a motion of protec-
tion I placed my arm about her
shoulders and drew her close tc me.
Side by side we faced the end.

  The thing that had been Pierre
ran its red tongue over pointed teeth
and watched us. Seemingly he did
not fear. His brutish face held no
gleam of intelligence. Only unspeak-
able vice and ravenous desire were
written there. And this was the
friend I had loved!

  But he that had brought death and
destruction to so many, that dread
THE RETURN OF THE MASTER

19

personification of loathsome evil, at
last realized what fear meant.

  The oppressive feeling lessened; I
felt free to move again, and once
more I thought coherently. A dead-
ening weight had been lifted from
my brain.

  Corpuscles of lambent cool flame
began to gather. Thickly clustering
in the room, they slipped through the
shutters that barred the broken win-
dows, and through the doorway. One
passed through the Master’s body.
He cringed, and it lingered as though
inspecting him carefully before enter-
ing farther. Even through the walls
they came, and watching them we
marveled at their numbers.

  “What can they be?” I whispered
to the girl.,

  “Wait,” she said. “I think I
know.”

  Now about each nucleus of light a
mist formed like fog around a street
lamp. It thickened, coalesced, and
bodies began to appear. Their gar-
ments represented all periods and
countries.

  Side by side, near an imperious
cavalier of Spain stood a gipsy wan-
derer gay in spotted neckerchief, pol-
ished leather, and gold coin buttons.
Farther away, I recognized a Roman
gladiator with his hand on the shoul-
der of a Persian spearman, whose
harness was that of Alexandrian con-
quests. An ugly crone with hooked
nose and protruding teeth tottered,
and was supported by a Chinese
bonze. Near them I saw the brown
of Eastern faces and the green robes
held as a holy color by the Moslems.
And in the breast of each glowed
dimly the central fires.

  “It is the rising of the slaves,”
(said Regina. “Here are those that
have suffered from the Master’s rule.
The spirits of the dead have come to
save us. Oh God, I thank Thee!
Pray, sire, and give thanks, for we
are saved!”

 “Perhaps,” I replied. “Look!
The last candle fails.”

  The shadows rushed in again, but
the Master and the Undead beside
him did not advance. They were
held in their tracks, and though they
longed to flee they stood glaring at
the accusing crowd, Pierre stupidly
shaking his head at us.

  One of this whispering company
was more opaque than the others. In
the throes of some gigantic struggle,
he sobbed and panted, his nebulous
light growing dim as he became more
visible. As his shape became more
pronounced the myriad radiant cor-
puscles waned in brilliance as though
he was draining them of force.

  The red of a British soldier’s uni-
form faded to pink, the knight’s ar-
mor, translucent at best, became
gauzy, then transparent and disap-
peared before my eyes. Together the
green robes of the Arabs and the yel-
low of the Chinese bonze vanished,
and in their place was empty air.

  One by one the strange throng be-
came invisible, but I knew that each
was still present, giving his all to his
comrade, who was becoming more
tangible every second.

  Now more than half had gone.

  The Master stood in the doorway
still, but there was a difference. The
hunter had become the hunted! As
he had frozen others in their tracks
while he worked his will upon them,
so he was held in a grip from which
there was no escaping.

  But he was not submitting weakly
to his former victims. He was fight-
ing valiantly for his life. Great
beads of moisture burst out upon his
forehead as he hurled his mighty will
at the shape that grew still more
plainly human. His tremendous
mental powers struggling against the
combined strength of the now wholly
invisible throng, buffeted the half-
man hither and thither about the
room.
20

WEIRD TALES

  Caught first in one eddy of force
and then another he hurtled like a
wind-blown leaf, and when he struck
walls or floor there was no sound. He
was not yet solid.

  It was a mighty scene, one whose
like has never been seen before. The
unbelievable and impossible was
occurring before our eyes. It was no
less than revolution! Evil that had
triumphed since unknown times was
being overthrown, and by agencies
that once were human.

  I felt proud that I was man, one
of the dominant race, and in a surge
of power I gave my feeble mite to the
struggle. Since obviously it was the
Master’s desire that the stranger
should not become strong, I willed
with all my force that he should. I
like to feel that it was the added
energy I gave that tipped the scales
so evenly balanced, and I hope that
it was.

  Suddenly, without warning, a man
as humanly solid as you or I stood in
the center of the room. Dressed he
was in harsh blue cloth, about his
throat was fur, and upon his head a
high hat of the same material.

 With the transformation came
vibrant joy that pulsed and throbbed
through the room, and I knew that
the invisible ones were rejoicing.

  Visibly the Master aged. His power
was ebbing from him, and the
strength that had held back Time
down through the ages was passing.
The years were rushing in upon him.

  Now the silence was broken for the
first time since the door had been
broken in. During the period of wait-
ing, and through the battle of wills,
nothing but the hoarse breathing of
the living corpse was to be heard, but
now the room echoed to long wild
peals of eery laughter.

  The stranger was giving vent to
merriment, and at the sound we
shivered. There were revenge, and
joy, and death in the cry!

  Then he spoke, and on© of the
strangest happenings of that remark-
able night occurred. Although he
spoke in unfamiliar language his
meaning was clear to me.

  “I have returned,” he said in a
slow, icy voice. “Do you know me?”
The Master did not answer, but I
could see that he was shaken. His
body visibly shrank, his hair grew
white, and a tottering senile old man
stood in the doorway, beside the dull
uncomprehending monster that he
had made of Pierre.

  “Before I died I prayed that I
might be given you for mine. I have
waited for many years. I bided my
time where I was sent to expiate my
sins. Others I met, more sinned
against than sinning. Together we
have come. Are we known to you?”
A croak replied, “Vermin of the
earth! Yes!”

  “Then,” cried the stranger, “pre-
pare, for now you die!”

  The Master stood more erect, with
something of his old pride and might,
and waited.

8.	Vengeance at Last!

npHEN the old formula of transmu-
tation was gone through again.
The actions that I was so familiar
with from the old manuscript were
repeated, and I saw for the first time
a werewolf at the moment of change.

  He tore off his suit of blue, and
stood a very giant before us. Then
he fell upon all fours, his limbs
withered and became long, lean
shanks. His hands grew claws and
became pads. Hair sprang out upon
his body. His head narrowed, mouth
widening and ears becoming pointed.
His eyes were bloodshot with fury,
as he howled in a long dismal tone.

  He was now a beast, and as I
formed the words in my mind, I
recognized my savior..

  “Wladislaw Brenryk!” I gasped,
      (Continued on page 141)
WHEN there was a-job to be
done, especially adventurous,
entailing skilful diplomacy
and undoubted peril, Tom Mansey
was summoned partly because he
knew Papua as well as a white man
may, partly that he seemed indiffer-
ent to probable torture and death
meted out by head-hunting savages
to intruders in hidden empires of the
hinterland.

  The stout officials sat about a table
viewing evidence which had promul-
gated fresh indignation. It had been
seized from the trophies of a globe-
trotting curio-hunter who parted re-
luctantly, indignantly from it, and
spouted wrath and threats of re-
prisal. It was a mummied •human
head no larger than a man’s doubled
fist, beautifully cured, furnished with
balls of cat’s-eye chalcedony in the
sockets, lips sewn in a kissing pout.
The shocking feature was its abun-
dant and flaming red hair. Nowhere

in Papuasia is red hair natural to a
native. The idea of a mummied head
with ruddy locks threatened the
fragile foothold of white civilization
on those dark flanks of a land as
treacherous as the panther it most
resembles.

  Mansey added the final note of
nausea to the assemblage.

  “A woman’s head, I should say.
Whether a white woman or not I
don’t know. The curing might
brown the skin. This hair is silky,
rather fine and waved, certainly not
bleached.. By the manner of lip-sew-
ing I should say it comes from the
north-shore people. I never saw nicer
work. ’ ’

  It was uncanny, horrid, weird, to
hear him enthuse over the craft of
cannibalistic savages, but his remarks
were crisp when they asked him to
investigate the source of supply, take
feasible measures to halt barter in
heads, intimate to the most indom-

itable, hellishly cunning race of
blacks that earth endures, that selling
human heads to tourists was indeli-
cate, inadvisable and immoral.

  “I’d suggest right here that you’d
better stop tourists buying heads. So
long as they pay big money for them,
the heads will be forthcoming, and
since heads with Nordic-colored hair
bring fatter prices, the natives will
swoop down on the ports and clean
out our little intrusion of white ex-
ploiters in one whirlwind of savagery
run amuck. However, I’m interested.
Using cat’s-eye quartz for eyes is a
new wrinkle that shows intelligent
progress in art.”

 Mansey crossed the room in a
weighted silence and traced a fore-
finger on a wall-map, traversing
from the Curlews south of Sarong,
then to the great island of Papua
marked on the north New Guinea.

 “What white men or women have
gone into here in the last decade and
who’s missing?” he asked of the
company’s clerk who had said least
and done most to assist in the investi-
gation. The clerk flipped pages of a
book and wrote rapidly on slips of
paper which he gave to Mansey.

  With these data, Mansey set out
with a power launch and a flock of
Tonga boys in small outrigger proas
hollowed from hardwood in a manner
that has not changed since the sea
spewed forth the South Sea Islands.
Mansey was lightly armed. Weapons
are small insurance against the peril
of penetrating tribal villages of
treacherous Papuasian black men,
and he knew that where that ruddy-
haired head was cured and fitted with
quartz eves, were intelligence and
barbed cunning.

  He had little information on which
to base conjecture. Official files men-
tioned a Scotchman, Andrew Keith,
who had gone native thirty years be-
fore, taken to the hinterland and
never reappeared. Besides Andrew
Keith, one other white man was in

that locality to which Mansey was
bound. His name was Homer Mullet,
he had been a surgeon in London, got
into disrepute and after a brief at-
tempt to establish himself in Port
Moresby, went north, evidently had
luck with the natives and sent down
frequently for drugs of surgical na-
ture and new cases of instruments.
His latest order was not more than
six months old. With this meager in-
formation on possible sources of red
hair Tom Mansey navigated the
treacherous tide rips and cross cur-
rents and after weeks of tentative
questioning located the lagoon where
Homer Mullet was reported to have
established himself as a sorcerer of
greater magic than any native chief-
tain.

Leaving his Tonga boys and their
proas outside, Mansey and a na-
tive launch man entered the reef
jaws of white coral just when dawn
turned the world pearl and the sea
was shimmering opal. Across the
lagoon were the triangular huts
fringed with tinkling shells, a fire
burning on the beach, cooking pots
steaming over it and the flower-deco-
rated savages who shouted yowls of
welcome. His launch churned bub-
bles in water clear as air, shining like
green flame. Beneath were sea-gar-
dens indescribably beautiful and
menacing, tinted coral, waving fem
weeds, wide-open flanges of tridacnas
that can take off a man’s foot if he
steps into one, pretty little fish clus-
tering and scattering like particles
of an exploding glass ball. The air
was hot and moist, perfumed by
flowers, thick with the stench of rot-
ting river swamp, pungent with sea-
tang, the^mingled scents of Papua’s
breasts teeming with desire, unfor-
gettable as the hells it transcended.

  With a feeling of high adventure,
Mansey sent the launch close to a
crude causeway jutting between the
nipa-thatched huts, knowing the
GRAY GHOULS

23

yelps of painted, spear-pronged sav-
ages might change at a breath to
cries of blood-lust and battle. His
heart pounded with the spice of the
thing and another discovery. Sitting
in state near the fire, remaining seat-
ed while the savages danced and
leaped in childlike frenzy, was the
white man he sought.

  A dozen black hands reached to
help him to the landing stage. The
center of a swarm of rowdy young
warriors hideously glorious in neck-
laces of human knuckle-bones, shark’s
teeth, crests of Paradise plumes, he
was led to the fire and an avenue
cleared down which he walked to the
white man who was distinctively un-
ornamented except by flower gar-
lands, a collar of many strands of
pearls, and pearl strings looped to
his midriff..

  “I’m Tom Mansey,” he said, “and
I suppose your name is Homer Mul-
let. I’ve been a month or two find-
ing you to have a little talk. ’ ’

  “Mansey,” commented Mullet
without rising or offering his hand,
“seems to me I’ve seen your name on
the company’s notations. Sit in for
breakfast and make yourself comfort-
able. I’m pretty chief here, and as
long as we agree you can sleep easy.
There’s turtle stewing and they’ve
learned to cook it white-man fashion.
It’s good to hear English again. You
haven’t by any possibility some
recent gramophone records, have-
you ?’ ’

  Mansey had. He breakfasted on
scraped ooconut cream and turtle
stew, a little fruit and remarkably
good coffee and was patient while
Mullet pumped and probed him for
world news and port gossip.

  He and Mullet ate alone. The
crowd had dispersed to a farther fire
and cooking pot. The women were
invisible in the huts. Mansey had
opportunity to observe many things,
a garden of sorts for that wilderness,
an almost new lagi-lagi house for the

men, and that Mullet’s abundant hair
curled to his shoulders but was so
dark brown as to be almost black.
Otherwise the renegade surgeon was
a giant in stature, growing too fat
and slightly insane, which Mansey
expected. No white man can fight
Papua. The land gets under'his skull
and behind his eyes.. It drugs and
stultifies his morale and finally kills
his soul. That had evidently hap-
pened to Mullet. But his talk was
rational. Mansey saw the slender,
tapering fingers always playing nerv-
ously with the pearl strands, and
the shifting prominent eyes. He had
been a man of character and person-
ality, a brainy intelligence, sensual-
mouthed, and his good looks spoiled
by a flattened nose and indulgence
which over-hampered his body.

  “You’ll stay a few days?” he
asked.

  “I’d like to,” Mansey told him.

  “You can have a house. Anything
else?” Mullet’s smile was suggestive
and Mansey shook his head.

  “The fact is I came for your help
in halting the sale of heads to white
tourists, if possible.” Mansey told
in detail the new menace which had
leaped to formidable proportions and
of the one ruddy-haired head which
had started the rumpus.

  “So you, knowing something of
heads,” said Mullet, “recognized the
lip-sewing and came north. They
know that I’m here, and that Sandy
Keith left his red-headed offspring
in these hills, eh?”

   “I suspected something of the sort.
I suspected you.”

   This man was clever, also friendly.
Mansey wanted that amiable feeling
to continue and he had no hope of
fooling Homer Mullet about his mis-
sion. Frankness might serve where
guile would antagonize.

  “You flatter me,” said Mullet,
laughing. “I start no line of devils
down here, my friend. Besides, my
hair isn’t red.”
24

WEIRD TALES

 “But the heads-” began Man-

sey. Mullet silenced him.

  4 41’ve no doubt my fellows do trade
heads. They cure them. I can’t stop
that, but I have managed to put the
fear o’ God into them enough to con-
fine their head-gathering to enemies
and killing them outright before they
begin. One thing I’ll admit: there
isn’t a fresh one in the village. Look
at the houses.”

  They strolled abroad and Mansey
saw that the heads on display were
old, rather green and misted with
mold. Wooden figures carved gro-
tesquely were plentiful. The village
was clean, the houses new, there was
evidence of sanitation and order un-
usual to natives. Yet instinct told
Tom Mansey he was hot on the trail
of trouble.

  He was sure of it when at one hut
there was a commotion and he saw a
young girl struggling with older
women and caught a glimpse of a
head of glinting gold curled^ in
cloudy beauty. Then amid shrieks of
the women she was dragged inside
and hidden. Mullet laughed.

  44Bleaching a new queen,” he ob-
served. “At present I am a widow-
er after a fashion. That shock you?”
44No.” Mansey shook his head.
44It isn’t good for man to live alone,
especially in savage lands. That new
queen is a beauty.”

  4 4 Six weeks in a darkened hut
bleaches them like mellow ivory, and
she’s been kept from betel-chewing,
or having her teeth filed. Making
wives to order is feasible here, Man-
sey. Old Sandy Keith knew that.”

 44 He is dead?” asked Mansey
quickly.

  4 4 He is dead, and I inherited a lot
of his troubles along with his trained
apes. Sandy was quite a scientist.
He was bent on learning the language
of orang-outangs and had a flock of
them.. I have them now, nicely
trained. You’ll see.”

  Mansey was relieved at the conver-
sational change, and puzzled. The
orang-outang is a formidable simian,
and he knew little about them except
that they would clear the jungle in
their vicinity of smaller monkeys and
birds on sight. Mullet’s laugh was
unpleasant, yet Mansey fancied it
sounded strange because laughter
was not often loosed in that place.
He sensed a sinister secret behind
this bland talk of Mullet, and he
knew instinctively that he was being
entertained nicely to hide that secret,
as well as Mullet’s almost pathetic
joy in companionship of his own
race and kind.

That night he watched a dance at
the lagi-lagi house and the ritual
of initiation of young men ripe for
manhood—the ritual that would en-
able them to take wives and heads. It
was not new to Mansey, but he hated
the evident relish of Homer Mullet
over the stoicism of young men en-
during greatly. He watched through
a haze of the final orgy, until satiated
with strong drink and blood-lust they
finally dropped inert and lay like a
strange harvest* of death as dawn
flowed over the hills and blazed on
the sea.

  He went to the hut they had given
him, but did not sleep. The settle-
ment was lifeless at that hour except
for a few older women at their house-
keeping and cooking. He thought of
the girl in the bleaching hut who
would be Mullet’s queen, and was
sorry for her, needlessly. He remem-
bered that Mullet had said he was a
widower at present, and during the
dance in the lagi-lagi house he had
confided drunken details of his rule
and the reign of Sandy Keith.

  4 4 He lorded it, Mansey. Had sev-
eral wives, and I married one of his
daughters, a red-headed she-devil.
She had all the beauty you’d ever
find in a woman, but she was worse
than native. She tried to kill me a

dozen times, knives, poison, sorcery,
until-”

  Mullet had laughed horridly. Tom
Mansey had no doubt in the world
that the red-headed wife of Homer
Mullet was killed, probably mur-
dered. It was not his concern, but it
sickened him. He knew that he was
on the track of that forbidden traffic
in heads, yet no nearer a solution of
the puzzle would be presented if he
tried to halt it.

  That day he slept fitfully and
awoke after the noon heat to find
Homer Mullet astir. Hearing his
voice, Mansey looked from the hut
door and saw Mullet coming down
the trail of white crushed coral fol-
lowed closely by a huge gray shape
that loped along in the way of the
great apes, paws trailing at its knees,
and Mullet was talking to the crea-
ture, which seemingly answered by
uncouth guttural sounds.

  He hailed Mansey. £ ‘ Going to take
a look-see at my queen. Come along ? ’ ’

  It seemed diplomatic to go along
and Mansey came down the notched
log a little on guard because of the
great ape.

  “Sheba won’t bother you,” said
Homer Mullet. “She’s jealous of
women but not men. I’ve got to get
her acquainted with this girl, whom,
by the way, I’ve named Cleo, short
for Cleopatra.” Mullet enjoyed the
joke loudly, and the great ape showed
her big teeth in a wide-mouthed grin
and an uncanny cackle.

  “Shut up!” yelped Mullet. The
effect was magical. The ape’s eyes
showed shame, even grief, and she
hung her head, but when Mansey
looked back he thought she was
snarling.

  When they reached the hut where
the potential queen was being
bleached and beautified, Sheba the
ape suddenly darted and swung to
its roof-peak, and no commands of
Mullet would make her descend.

  “All right, you jealous old she-
monk, take a look-see from up there
and you’ll see a real beauty. Bring
out the girl!” he called to the
scrawny old woman who peeped from
the door.

  On the roof, Sheba chattered
angrily as Mullet repeated the com-
mand in native. To Mansey the ex-
periment seemed considerable of a
risk. As the child appeared in the
hut doorway, Sheba showed jealousy.
The girl was the prettiest Mansey
had ever seen, her rounded body out-
lined in scarlet stain, her only cover-
ing a waist fringe of red and white
blossoms.

  Homer Mullet glanced at her, then
beckoned to the ape on the hut roof
and commanded in lurid curses,
which Sheba not only ignored but
chattered back her raging resent-
ment.

  “Look here,” howled Mullet,
“you’ll come down and behave or I’ll
get the whip. This girl is your mas-
ter-lady, hear what I say? You’ll
treat her nicely and none of your
tricks like last time. You had your
chance, you she-devil! And you
made hell for everybody. You know
what happened to you then, and it’ll
be woi’se next time. I’ll make a croco-
dile of you—understand? You know
how you hate water and the muggers.
Well, you behave or your next in-
carnation will be a mugger. Now
come down and kowtow.”

  Mansey listened in astonishment
and something of fear. The she-ape
was powerful enough to tear a man
limb from limb, and she was roused
to fury. Her eyes shot green fire, her
teeth flashed and ground on them-
selves. The pretty little bride was
gray-skinned with terror and dropped
to the ground, her golden eyes a wild
appeal. Mullet had been drinking
heavily all night and was still drunk.
His face grew purple-red, his eyes
were bloodshot, the veins on his neck
stood out and throbbed. But the ape
26

WEIRD TALES

defied him and in the end he snarled
a command to take the girl inside,
and strode off beckoning Mansey to
follow to a couch by a shaded nook
at the jungle edge.

  There he imbibed more fermented
coconut juice and gradually calmed
to coherency which was no less fright-
ful in its revelations than his exhibi-
tion of rage.

  “That ape is near human. I’d say
she is human. Old Keith made a
study of them. I went him one bet-
ter. I gave them brains. You saw
that she was jealous, didn’t you?
Well, I’m afraid of her. Six months
ago she killed my bride, another red-
headed beauty like this one. I’ve got
to prevent that, Mansey. Somehow
I’ve got to keep her from this girl.”

  “Why not do away with the ape?”
asked Mansey, more because some re-
ply was expected than as a sug-
gestion.

  ‘ ‘ I dare not. I’ve got seven of them
trained, equipped with brains, think-
ing brains. They’re my bodyguard.
Without them I wouldn’t last. here.
Oh, I know these blacks don’t love
me! I’m not that great a fool that
I’d feel safe long. The she-apes are
always near. You don’t see them,
but they don't let me out of their
sight. I made a mistake with Sheba,
though. Sheba was the name of that
red-haired she-devil of a wife that
tried to do me in. I remember telling
you about her last night. Well, Sheba
loved her red hair and beauty. She
loved me too damn well. And God,
how she hates being a monkey! But
that was no idle threat about the
muggers. I’ve never tried that, but
I will. I’ll make a crocodile of
Sheba, so help me God, if she touches
this new girl.”

  “Mullet, you’re about as drunk as
I’ve seen a man. Better quit that
stuff or you’ll be seeing monkeys,”
said Mansey.

  Homer Mullet laughed long and
loud.

  “You don’t believe that, eh?. Well,
I don’t blame you. But didn’t you
hear why they did for me in Lon-
don? No? Well, I’ll tell you. I took
the brain of a boy dying with con-
sumption and transplanted it to the
head of a half-wit homicide. And by
God, I made a success of it! And did
they hail me as the discoverer of a
new trail in surgery, and see as I
.saw, a way to empty our asylums and
make use of incurables? They did
not. They said I was crazy, they dis-
graced me. I barely escaped an
asylum myself. That’s why I came
out here and kept my hand in. And
I’ve done it time and time again.
There was plenty of opportunity. The
battles gave me subjects for experi-
ment, and many a head is mummied
and sold whose brain is still doing ex-
cellent service in a strange body.
That’s what I’ve done.”

  Mansey was staring at Mullet the
surgeon, who gloated over his own
skill. It was unbelievable, yet except
the wrath which shone in his eyes,
Mullet’s appearance was convincing.

  “But trying the ape business was
new. And possibly it was immoral.
Sheba tried so many times to kill me,
and one night when I was sleeping
she almost got me. I struck in self-
defense, stunned her and saw-myself
as a murderer. You may think mur-
der a small thing to a man like me.
It isn’t. I’ve never killed. I didn’t
kill then. The she-ape that Keith had
trained and which liked me was tear-
ing the hut to pieces when she heard
the row inside, and before I could get
a gun she had snatched the body of
my insensible Sheba. You won’t care
for details of what happened. I
hadn’t a weapon and I grabbed a bot-
tle of chloroform which Was handy
and tried to brain the ape. The bot-
tle broke and she was deluged. It
GRAY GHOULS

acts quickly on them, Mansey. And
something seemed to crack in my
brain as I saw the unconscious ape
and the dying woman. Well, the ape
is Sheba. Now you know. I’m a fool
not to kill her, but it’s gone farther
than that with me. I liked Sheba.
And she cared enough for me to pre-
vent my ever taking a second wife.
More than that, she has somehow com-
municated to the other orang-outangs
her jealous guardianship.

  “I can’t slaughter all the apes in
the jungle, and they haunt me. Sheba
has managed to people the land with
gray ghouls who watch me night and
day. Dante never conceived the hell
of torture that I’m living through,
Mansey.”

In the tropic heat, Homer Mullet
shivered and sweat broke cold on
the forehead of Tom Mansey.
Through terrific repulsion over-
whelming him, he found himself sorry
for the man who had made his own
hell with more ingenious cunning
than cannibal head-hunters could
have devised for him.

  “Mansey, if you could tell me a
way out, I’d hang these pearls on
your arm. An emperor’s ransom,
Mansey, for a plan to rid myself of
this hell and live in peace.”

  Mansey was silent. The avalanche
of horror had come so suddenly he
could not yet grasp the thing. He
assured himself it was the talk of a
maniac, wildly horrible, yet in spite
of reason he was convinced. And
sifting through the horror was the
fact of those red-haired heads drift-
ing down to be bartered. If what
Mullet said should be true, he was no
nearer accomplishing what he had
come to do. The authorities would
not believe this tale nor could he
halt the barter and trade.

  “What became of the—the head—
of Sheba?” he asked, licking dry lips
with the tip of his tongue.

 “They stole it from me. And I
had made a job of that head, was
rolling drunk when I did most of it.

I put eyes-”

  “Cat’s-eye quartz?” asked Man-
sey. Mullet nodded.

  “I’ve got it in the boat,” said Man-
sey. “That was the one that caused
the trouble. It was nicely finished.”
Mullet stared at him.

  “For God’s sake, hide it, Mansey.

Perhaps Sheba-”

  He did not finish, for swinging
down from tree branches overhead,
the great she-ape stood before them.

  Mullet ripped out an oath and add-
ed, “You heard what I was saying,

you-”

  Mansey fancied he heard the sound
of a guttural word of speech and he
leaped to his feet, ready to run for
cover. The ape regarded him a mo-
ment with her alert gaze, then
reached a paw, caught his shoulder
and flung him, as if he were a child,
at Mullet’s feet.

 “Better behave, Mansey,” com-
mented Mullet. ‘ ‘ She’s heard what I
said. She was old Keith’s daughter,
remember, and he taught all of them
his own tongue. If you speak French

now, we might manage-”

  He looked at Mansey enquiringly.
Mansey shook his head..

 “Very little. I do comprehend
‘sauve qui peut,’ however, and it
seems appropriate to this situation.”
“A fine chance,” snarled Mullet,
as he looked about him. Mansey’s
gaze followed that survey and again
he felt the chill of fear. In the thick
tangle of lianas and jungle growth
he caught glimpses of gray shapes
watching them, swinging in gro-
tesquely airy flight from tree to tree,
a company of gray apes, the for-
midable “men of the woods” known
to the‘world as orang-outangs.

 “My harem,” was hissed from
Mullet’s lips. “Each one equipped
28

WEIRD TALES

with the brains of a woman I selected
as a wife, sealing her doom at the

hands of this she-” The epithets

he applied to Sheba were unspeak-
ably vile. Mansey looked in appre-
hension at Sheba, but her eyes had
not changed expression. Evidently
there were a good many curses of
port dives and docks not included in
her knowledge of English. In place
of anger, the eyes held something of
the love-loyalty seen in the eyes of a
faithful dog for its master. She
squatted beside Mullet, took his hand
and stroked it with her black paw,
then held it to her cheek. Mullet
jerked it away with an expression of
disgust, and the great ape whimpered
sorrowfully.

  “You see?” snarled Mullet. “Yet
we must talk. How about those
gramophone records? Start a row
going-”

  “They’re in the launch,” .said
Mansey. “I’ll get them.” But when
he rose, the ape caught his ankle,
reaching wTith no apparent effort, and
Mansey was jerked to the ground.
Then, throwing back her head, Sheba
displayed her fangs in a wide-
mouthed and \mmistakable grin.
Mansey realized that he had walked
into a trap, that only by cunning
could he escape from the dread com-
pany of gray ghouls which Mullet the
surgeon loosed in that jungle. Now for
the first time he faced greater peril
than head-hunting savages seeking
trophies or glutting their unquench-
able blood-lust against white in-
truders.

  “Wait,” said Mullet, then ad-
dressed the ape. “You savvy music
records?” He made a circular mo-
tion writh his hand and hummed a
scrap of tune. “You fetchem white
man proa ’longside. Savvy?”

  Sheba uttered a sound from her
throat and swung in swift flight
through the trees. Mansey immedi-
ately scrambled to his feet and Mul-
let rose, but before they could take

a step there was a circle of great
apes hemming them in effectively.
They made no attempt to touch either
man, but formed a ring and marched
about the two prisoners in what
might have seemed a ludicrously
humorous array if it had not been
menacing and sinister.

  “Mansey, I’m going out with you.
I’ve got to go. God knows there isn’t
any other place for me—in white set-
tlements, I mean—but I’ll get to an-
other island. They can’t cross water.
Oh, you can speak now! These are
natives, not even very good at beche
de mer talk. It’s that devil of a
Sheba who understands and com-
municates with the others. You heard
her just now, calling them. Usually
they don’t come so close, but your ar-
rival has made her suspicious, no
doubt, and she doesn’t want to lose
me.”

  His laughter was mirthless and un-
canny, the sound of insanity cracking
in his voice. Mansey did not wonder.
He felt that his own reason would not
long stand the strain of this sinister
surveillance. Yet what reasoning
power was still uncluttered by the
impasse in which he found himself,
cautioned him against attempting to
assist Mullet to escape. The great
ape would frustrate such an attempt,
he felt sure. And there was danger
in releasing a madman like Mullet on
any other island, he thought. Aware
that his face showed reluctance, he
was again frank in speech.

  “Mullet, I’m of the opinion that
you can’t get away, and I must. I
could bring help, perhaps. I’ll give
you my word to do what I can, but
for two of us to attempt escape,
especially when you have such de-
voted followers, is utterly futile.”

  “Look here, don’t you fancy for a
moment you and that launch will
leave this lagoon without me, Man-
sey. You can’t, you know, unless I am
willing. Even if you got to the launch,
the blacks in their canoes would
GRAY GHOULS

29

halt you at the reef entrance. I’ve
had enough of this. Before you came
I was making the best of it. I was
content enough, only that I wanted a
woman. Oh, it’s my own doings!
Don’t think I’m shifting the blame,
but at that it was something stronger
than my will driving my hand to that
delicate operation. If they’d let me
alone in London, if they’d seen the
marvel of what I’d accomplished, the
greatest feat of surgery in this or any
other age, I wouldn’t be here and this
wouldn’t have happened. But they
drove me out, my own race and kind.
And you belong to them, Mansey.
I’ve got a grudge, not against you,
but all white men. Mansey”—his
voice became quieter, more confiden-
tial in tone—“what if we’d take
Sheba, you and I, and tour a few
countries exhibiting the greatest
marvel of the age? We’d need
money, and we’d make it. I’ve lorded
it here. I couldn’t go back and
grub and sweat again. But we could
do that-”

  “Mullet, either you talk rational
or-”

 “What will you do? What can
you do except put a bullet through
me, and you’d loose a hell-fury that
would tear you bit by bit in rags.
I’ve seen Sheba do that. Finger by
finger, Mansey, toe by toe, handfuls
of hair, eyelids—■—”

  “Shut up, you beast!” cried Man-
sey.

  ‘‘ That gets you, eh ? Well, it’s true.
And I’m your only protection.
You’ve got to save me to escape
alive. ’ ’

  “What about the natives?”

  “Sheba is half native, remember,
and she likes her own kind. They’re
safe. They’re not only safe but in-
vulnerable. When they go forth to
take wives and heads, the gray apes
go along and fight for them. It’s a

shambles when they leave, Mansey
It has one kick-back, though.” Mul-
let laughed again and Mansey liked
his curses better than his laughter.
“The natives don’t need to fight and
they will in time lose their own in-
itiative, their courage. Some day
this tribe won’t exist, but that won’t
come in time to save us.”

  “Listen, Mullet, suppose I go out
and bring help, a revenue cruiser
that will blast this village into noth-
ingness as has been done before now.

A few shells-”

  ‘ ‘ Shells * won’t reach the apes.
You’d merely murder the blacks who
aren’t to blame. Besides, I’ve no as-
surance that you’d come back or
send them. Who'd believe your story
of human apes? And where would I
be when they shelled the village? If
I went to the hills, the apes would go
along. If I stayed here to have them
killed I’d get it. What, don’t you
see I couldn’t even kill myself if I
felt like heroics to save you, because
you’d have Sheba on your neck the
minute I croaked? Pretty little mess,
eh, Mansey? And there is no escape
in the jungles or huts, none at all
except to cross the water where the
apes can’t follow, and you’re handi-
caped there because the natives know
just what would happen to them if
I’m not here to keep Sheba pacified.
I did try getting away with one of
my brides in a canoe and Sheba was
on watch that night. She tore a
lagi-lagi to bits, jerked the men to the
shore and sent them after me in
canoes. Then they gave me to under-
stand I must not try again to escape.
Oh, it’s a beautiful entanglement!
Here’s Sheba.”

The great ape dropped from over-
hanging tree branches and in one
arm she carried Mansey’s gramo-
phone case, without which he never
traveled. It was further proof of the
30

WEIRD TALES

uncanny intelligence of Sheba that
she had understood Mullet’s com-
mand and brought the case. She
squatted and deftly unfastened the
buckles of leather straps binding the
oil-cloth cover, fitted the handle,
opened a package of records and
wound the machine. In another mo-
ment the wail of She’s My Baby Doll
rose in the hot silence. An instant
later Mansey shrieked laughter of
hysteric abandon, for the great she-
ape was swaying from one foot to an-
other and gazing at Homer Mullet
with the amorous leer of a love-sick
crone. She put out a paw to take his
hand, but Mullet jerked it aside, and
kicked his bare foot at her chest.
Lacking his hand to fondle, she seized
his foot, precipitated him on his back
and cuddled the foot to her breast,
laying her cheek against it and fond-
ling each toe as mothers the world
over play with toes of their babies.

  “Laugh, damn you,” growled Mul-
let. “I’ll show you.” He spoke in
native to Sheba, who reluctantly re-
leased his foot, caught Mansey in her
arms and, despite his struggles,
swung to the tree branches. For all
her strength the weight of a fighting
man cumbered her movements and
she halted her flight to hold him by
both arms and shake him until
his teeth rattled. Then swinging
farther aloft she flung him over
the crotch of a branch and dropped
to earth.

 From below, Mansey heard Mul-
let’s shrieks of mirth. At that eleva-
tion he could see the village huts, the
lagoon and his launch, the long reef-
jaws, and ascending far down the
outer beach, the smokes of fires where
his Tonga boys cooked their meal.
About him were the palms glittering
like sabers in the sun, but the jungle
was silent, bereft of the gorgeous
birds of Paradise, the lorries and par-
rakeets, the little chattering harmless

monkeys. Where the great apes held
court, no other jungle life lingered.

 Mansey straddled the limb and
considered in frantic dismay the sit-
uation in which he was placed. Re-
luctantly, he accepted Mullet’s logic.
There seemed no escape. Watching
glimpses he obtained of the lagoon
through swaying palms and branch
plumes, he saw a dark object floating
and realized with his heart racing
that it was the body of his native left
in charge of the boat. Evidently he
had angered Sheba and she had killed
him without so much as an outcry.
Mansey almost envied the dead man.
For the first time in his years of
Papua he admitted that there were
worse things than murder: far worse
than the taking and curing of human
heads as trade to tourists was the fit-
ting of beast craniums with the brains
of thinking humans.

  Mansey looked below. The gramo-
phone still wailed its jazz music and
foolish songs. The seven great she-
apes were dancing clumsily, in con-
trast to their lithe grace in the trees.
Mullet lay prone on the mats, his
naked trunk crisscrossed by strings
of pearls, his arms over his eyes.
Above, Mansey racked his brain to
think of a plan of escape. Far off, the
black crouching hills quivered in the
heat, which was affecting Mansey in
spite of a breeze at that elevation
which did not penetrate below. He
felt thirsty and faint and he knew if
he should lose his grip of the tree
bole, he would fall to death. His
heart and blood began to pound, a
throbbing which presently drummed
in his ears. Then, suddenly, Tom
Mansey knew he heard drums, far off,
faint, inaudible to Mullet because of
the grinding gramophone diligently
kept going by Sheba.

  Mansey knew the meaning of the
drum-song of Papua, rising, falling,
sinister, maddening, the voice coaxed
by bare hands from bladderskins
GRAY GHOULS

31

stretched over human skulls, and a
new fear swooped and rode his
shoulders. That drum-song meant
savages on the march, and it was
coming nearer. He looked below and
saw that the she-apes had ceased
dancing and stood as if listening
through the blatant jazz music to the
voice of approaching peril.

  In another moment, Sheba had
clutched Mullet and shot him to his
feet and was chattering a warning.
The gramophone record died with a
moan, and the drum-song rose insist-
ent as the drone of bees, palpitant as
the quivering hills.. It roused sleep-
ing natives and the huts belched sav-
ages. They poured from the lagi-lagi
where they had been sleeping off
the night potations, arranging their
plume crests as they leaped to earth,
young men greedy for battle, eager
for slaughter, grimly meticulous over
their gaudy ornaments, proud of the
fine blue lace of tattooing and blis-
tered cicatrices obtained in agony.

  Mullet looked up to where Mansey
was hidden in the tree.

  “Need help to get down?” he
called. “Sheba wall fetch you.”

  Mansey yelled a refusal and began
to scramble down, but the great ape
swung aloft before he had compassed
more than a few feet of the descent.
She caught the branch on which he
was perched and bent it double,
plucked him from his vantage and let
the branch go. The crash as it flew
back proved the tremendous strength
of the beast-woman, and Mansey’s
heart missed a beat as he was swung
in flying leaps and dropped on the
mats, unhurt.

  “Hear those drums?” began Mul-
let. “That means reprisal. Now
Sheba and her sisters can help my
fellows defend the village.” He
looked at Mansey, and in the blood-
shot eyes of Mullet there was a mean-
ing Mansey tried to read because
neither dared utter his thoughts in

the uncanny hearing of Sheba. Mul-
let turned to the ape.

  “Good Sheba, pretty Sheba. Go
after the drums, Sheba. Show the
Kauloo warriors they can’t fight our
fellows. Take the other girls and
have a good fight, old girl..” He
patted her shoulder, and at that care-
less caress the great ape fawned on
him like a grateful cur that has
known only kicks and abus

The warriors were dressing for
battle in frenzied haste. They
scorned to go forth to fight or die in
aught but gorgeous array. And a
drum-song of their own arose, one
drum after another, purling the
blood-rousing tempo that stirs the
heart and soul of a man, tingles in
his flesh, prickles on his scalp, the
primal quickening call to war. Look-
ing at Mullet, Tom Mansey saw hope
born in his eyes and thought he
understood. They would be rid of
the apes for a time. His own thoughts
darted to the launch in the lagoon,
the Tonga flotilla on the beach out-
side. Then as he looked seaward
Mansey cursed. The Tonga boys had
heard that drum-song and understood
its meaning. They had no courage.
They had launched their canoes,
which ranged like slim dark beetles
on the sun-glitter of the sea, ready to
dart like arrows to safety far beyond.
They hovered about the lagoon en-
trahce evidently waiting a hail or
sign from Mansey, and he was power-
less to reach them.

  About the cooking fire, replenished
by old men, began the war dance, and
old women fetched gourds of fer-
mented coconut wine, which was
swigged by the warriors, who smacked
their lips loudly and leaped into new
frenzy, wild contortions, a hideous
Carmagnole in which the she-apes
joined, sometimes jumping to catch a
tree branch and swing madly, spin-
ning in midair like gibbet-fruit. Then
at a sign from the leader, the dancers
32

WEIRD TALES

                             «

filed into the jungle, and the great
apes leaped to the trees. Where had
been a ferocious swarm' of painted
savages was only the scattered fire
embers and the women gathering the
empty gourds.

  “Now,’' said Mullet, “now is our
chance. We’ve got the luck of fools.
Get to the launch and start it, Man-
sey, and I’ll get the girl. By God,
I’d have given Sheba credit for more
brains than she showed this time, but
the gods are with us.”

  ‘ ‘ Look here, you leave that girl be-
hind, Mullet.” Mansey’s voice was
stern.

  “To be killed by the she-ape?
What d ’you take me for ? Not much!
I know what’ll happen to every living
human left in this village when Sheba
comes home and finds me gone.
There won’t be a village. There
won’t be anything, Mansey, but rub-
bish, blood-soaked earth and bits of
flesh. That girl comes. And there’s
no time to argue. . .”

  It was the one outstanding fact;
they must hasten and get away.
Mansey turned and ran to the land-
ing stage where he had been swung
from the launch yesterday. He
shortened her painter, dropped in
and whirled the wheel. Then his
heart sank. The engine was dead and
a glance showed him the cunning of
Sheba, for she had unscrewed every
nut and bolt she could find and
emptied his spare gasoline. The cans
glittered at the bottom of the lagoon
when Mansey looked overside. The
ape had taken time to sink them, sink
every spare tool and all loose gear
she could find. She had even thrust
the oars, carried for emergency, into
the open jaws of tridacnas, which
closed on them. He leaned over, and
reaching into the water, wrenched on
one, but not all his strength released
it. His efforts broke the blade tip
and the maimed oar came up in his
hands. The second one was beyond
his reach.

  Some minutes had elapsed in his
cursory examination of the launch,
but his brain was never so alert be-
fore. He thought he might use the
maimed oar to scull the unwieldy
craft, and stood up to summon the
Tonga proas from beyond the reef,
for the old men and women of the
village were watching him covertly
and muttering among themselves.
Mansey remembered they did not
want Mullet to escape for fear of the
great apes’ wrath. But they would
probably not interfere with him. He
faced a decisipn of Saving his own life
and leaving Mullet to a hell he had
made for himself, or risking death in
the attempt to release Mullet from
horror. The choice was wrenched
from him when he saw Mullet leap
from, the bleaching hut to the ground
with the girl on his shoulder, and
Mullet’s free hand clutched a big
navy revolver.

  Mansey saw the reason for the gun
at once, and his own small auto-
matics were in his hands. For when
they saw their erstwhile white master
running like a deer for the shore,
there was a piercing scream from the
natives left behind the war party,
and they rushed at Mullet and the
girl, determined to hold him on his
perilous throne.

  Mansey heard the man’s warning
cry, then the crack of his gun as he
cleared a path, shooting as he ran,
crashing through the outthrust arms
that would have detained him, leav-
ing dead and dying in his wake. He
had almost gained the white strip of
coral beach from which the landing
stage jutted over the lagoon water,
when one courageous old man threw
himself headlong and Mullet tripped
and crashed to earth, the girl flung
from his arms and curled in a heap
on the coral. In another moment,
Mullet was the center of a heaving,
lunging mass of blacks who tried to
weight him to earth.
GRAY GHOULS

33

  Mansey, in the launch, heard his
fists thud on flesh, heard the thud of
the gun-butt used as a club, saw
black and white arms threshing like
flails, then with a mighty heave Mul-
let was free. A triumphant yell
burst from his throat and he had
leaped toward the shining head of the
girl who lay on the sand as she had
fallen, evidently knocked uncon-
scious. That yell died in Mullet’s
throat and Mansey’s heart missed a
beat, then raced painfully. For
from the quivering plumes of trees
dropped a gray ghoul shape, scream-
ing horribly in rage, and she flung
herself at the white man and sent
him spinning with a sweep of her
long arm. It was Sheba!

  With his brain in a whirl, Mansey
realized that if he was ever to get
away, it was the crucial moment.
Yet, loosing the launch painter, he
hesitated. Mullet lay prone on the
glistening coral sand, and after a
glance at him, Sheba had turned to
the girl whose shining brush of curls
turned slightly as if consciousness
was just returning. One awful scream
burst from her throat as the hand of
Sheba encircled her throat, then Man-
sey saw her bright hair through a
red mist, for he realized what was
going to happen, and saw from his
eye corners that Mullet had rolled to
his belly on the coral and was tak-
ing aim with his gun. Mansey’s
thoughts darted in wild speculation.
Mullet would shoot Sheba, and he
need not aim for the girl unless Mul-
let missed the ape. Otherwise—he
shuddered with horror of what would
happen in another moment as the
hammer of Mullet’s gun clicked use-
lessly, and Sheba, snarling horribly,
picked up the girl as if she were a rag
doll.

  Mansey’s gun cracked twice. He
felt sick, revolting with nausea, for
the girl’s body hung limp in the ape’s
paws, and on her golden skin two
bright soft ribbons spurted and

flowed. She was beyond pain. But
Mullet was creeping soundlessly, cau-
tiously on his belly over the coral,
making for the landing stage.

Mansey loosed the painter, held
the launch by his clutch of the
neai’est post, kept his gun aimed at
the head of Sheba, trying in spite of
the red mist over his sight to point
for the base of her brain, afraid to
risk a shot lest he should miss and she
would be upon them with lightning
speed.

  He had time to think how marvel-
ously the rapid-fire passing of events
had shaped for this get-away. With-
out the sudden arrival of Sheba, the
natives would have prevented their
escape; and if Mansey had not in-
sisted on bringing the girl, Sheba’s
attention would never have been dis-
tracted by this opportunity to glut
jealous rage on her rival in the affec-
tions of Mullet. The great ape was
extremely, dreadfully engrossed.
Mansey tried not to see what she did,
tried to believe it was a rag doll in
the hands of a mischievous pet. He
was bracing himself with all his will
to override the violent upheaval that
swept to his eyes and brain, while
Mullet crept toward the launch.

  Far off the drum-song was muffled,
like the croon of surf on coral. Be-
yond the reef his Tonga boys waited.
Another two minutes and Mullet
would tumble inlo the craft. Already
Mansey had braced the broken oar-
tip against the planks to shove out.
They must widen the water between
themselves and Sheba. Mansey won-
dered, in a vague, darting thought, if
orang-outangs could not swim, and
remembered that before this trans-
elementation the human body of
Sheba was probably adept and strong
in the w'ater.

  Mullet was on the landing stage.
Mansey. heard the planks creak, but
Sheba seemed to hear nothing but her

own animal snarling at the dreadful
task presented her. She was almost
finished. Her arm swept out and
held aloft something pitiful with long
bright hair which she played with
and stroked. Then from far out. be-
yond the reef one of Mansey’s boys
hailed his master. Mansey’s whole
body jerked as if his jierves were
strings of a puppet snatched by a
crude hand.

   ‘ ‘ Marster, Marster! ’ ’

  Mullet lunged as Sheba was on her
feet. The launch careened crazily
as he plunged in and Mansey heaved
on the oar, then tried to propel the
craft from the stern. One wild
screech of baffled rage rang and
echoed between the jungle-clad reef-
prongs, and swinging the head by its
long hair, Sheba sailed through the
air, flung herself- from the landing
stage into the water and swam after
the boat.

  Mullet was yelling and chattering
like a madman. His gun was gone
and he had seized Mansey’s auto-
matics and sent a sharp fusillade at
the swimming ape. If Sheba was hit,
the lead pellets did not halt her.
Mansey, sculling frantically at the
stern, saw her fangs bared, heard her
snarls, stared in horror as his muscles
cracked with the strain of propelling
the tubby launch, at the long, gray,
hairy ghoul which gained on them so
rapidly that the boat might have been
anchored for all headway they seemed
to make.

  A mighty lunge, and Sheba’s paw
caught the stern, seized the oar with
which he tried to batter her off, and
wrenched it from his grasp. Then
Mansey threw himself on the comb-
ing as the ape’s weight almost
swamped them. Mullet was scream-
ing, fighting, kicking as the paws
seized him, dragged him from his
clutch of the planks and hauled him,
still struggling, into the sea.

  For a moment there was a wild up-
heaval, and the clear lagoon water

churned in foam that was blood-
streaked. Mullet’s shots had hit the
she-ape, but that great body had the
strength and endurance of an el-
ephant. Yet in another moment,
Mansey saw that Sheba was badly
wounded, for her lips dripped redly
and her eyes showed glassy.

  Mullet was clasped in one arm and
she tried to swim with the other.
Beside the body of Mullet trailed a
head with bright hair, and Mansey,
helpless to avert further tragedy,
sick with the shock of dread, clung to
the launch combing, watching Sheba
suddenly cease swimming, and sink
beneath the lagoon water, with Mullet
in her grasp.

  The ripples spread in rings, the
bubbles broke. Through water clear
as air, Mansey saw the gray ghoul
go down, feet first, with the white
man still struggling futilely. Then
as the hairy gray shape parted sea-
fern fronds until her foot touched
a vantage by which she might have
shot her body to the surface, there
was a further commotion in the sea-
gardens, a violent upheaval writhing
below, a line of bubbles ascending,
breaking soundlessly as the souls of
man and she-ape escaped.

  Mansey stared. He knew. Sheba’s
foot had touched the tinted flesh
flanges of a giant tridacna and it had
closed like a steel trap. Not even in
the death agony had she released her
embrace of the man whom in human
shape she had loved so fiercely that
she took him with her to a transele-
mentation far removed from reach of
those bunglers who trifle with the
doors of life and death.

The hot sun blazed down on a man
inert, limp as a rag, lying on the
launch bottom, and presently the
Tonga boys who saw the launch put
out, came to investigate.

  They were some weeks towing the

‘‘Then came a blinding flash of
light, an odor of burning parch-
ment.”

     |ENTLEMEN, you of the
Wanderlust Club are my
friends. Among you are
numbered financial wizards, men of
scientific renown. Not only because
of your worldly standing, but also
because of our mutual regard, I have
come to you to obtain assistance in
freeing the world from the grasp of
that monster-octopus, fear!”

  To say that we of the club were
startled is putting it all too mildly.
Travis, the man who had just spoken,
had been absent from the country for
moi*e than four years, and now, evi-
dently laboring under a terrific
strain, he had returned to startle us.

  Some there were of us, I am afraid,
who thought our friend was unbal-
anced. But Travis waved us to seat
ourselves and calmly called out to the
attendant to lock the doors securely.

  “My friends,” he began, sweeping
the semicircle of faces about him with
eyes glittering strangely, “several

years ago I left you to go on a ram-
bling tour of the world. In Haiti, that
breeding place of wizardry and Black
Magic, I chanced to see a little more
than an outsider usually witnesses of
the clutching grasp those necroman-
cers have upon the fear-bound
natives. Perhaps many of you will
remember that I have ever been ag-
nostic concerning spiritualism; at any
rate, upon seeing the damnable hold
those magi have obtained upon the
throats of the ignorant natives, my
heart was filled with a great pity for
them; and, after many days and
nights of mulling the horror of it over
in my mind, I came to the determi-
nation to throw off the yoke from the
necks of the ignorant—if possible.

                                   35

  "Some there are who believe that
love—or hate—is the strongest of
human emotions; yet I think you will
agree with me that fear is, beyond
cavil, the most soul-stirring emotion
of them all. My life was worth noth-
ing to anyone save myself; and I
reasoned that if it were possible for
me to learn the secrets of Black Magic
and spiritualism, by broadcasting
throughout the world an explanation
of how the seemingly impossible
tricks of wizardry were done I might
remove that fear of the unknown
from the hearts of all.

  “I remember thinking, as I started
upon my strange quest for knowledge
of the mysterious, that, if I were to
accomplish my ends, I must needs
learn to perform the impossible. But,
gentlemen, the impossible has never
been done! It is quite true that we
poor mortals witness some certain
thing which is beyond our compre-
hension, and we dub it magic. I
might,” he added dryly, “call your
attention to Noah Webster’s defini-
tion of the word ‘impossible’.”

  Whether or not the man were mad,
at least he seemed sure of himself,
and we of the Wanderlust Club were
giving him strict attention.. Striding
through our midst, Travis went to the
window and took up a potted plant.
He placed it on the floor at his feet.

  “Not with an intention of being
theatrical, gentlemen, but merely to
show you that I am not taking up
your time with a drooling bit of
idiocy, I shall show you a few things
sometimes performed by magi. For
instance: look carefully upon this
plant. It is thoroughly healthy, and
its flowers very sweet ...”

  Our eyes fell to the thing; and, as
God is my witness, the plant shriv-
eled and died beneath our gaze!

  Travis was smiling. “You have
witnessed the impossible? No, no,
gentlemen; you have seen this thing,
and therefore it can not have been
impossible! Are there things impos-

sible? Indeed yes; but rest assured
that you shall never see them!

  “A man goes to a mystic; a witch;
a medium. He sees and hears things
which appear to be supernatural. His
wits are befuddled, there is an inde-
finable fear in his breast, and he
imagines more than he sees or hears.
He credits to spirits the mystery of
the revelations which have been made
to him. As for myself, I have seen
things in my search for the solution
of the riddle of the universe which
I would not have thought to be pos-
sible; yet I have solved the mystery,
and tonight I shall show you some
of these things.

  “As children, you witnessed the
magician upon the stage as he pro-
duced rabbits and geese and eggs and
miles upon miles of ribbon from an
ordinary hat. And you were, indeed,
witnessing child’s play. The adult
mind, broadened in scope of knowl-
edge, demands deeper mysteries. To-
night you shall see them, gathered
from Haiti, Egypt, India, and China..
My reason in thus displaying these
mysteries: before proceeding farther
with my astounding revelations, I
want each of you to see for himself,
for seeing is believing!”

Travis paused for breath, then pro-
ceeded with his novel and weird
demonstration. Trick after trick,
things which I would have staked my
life upon as being impossible, start-
ling, shaking us all to the very foun-
dations of our souls!

  In the tense moments of the de-
nouement of a rather bewildering bit
of magic, Amos Green sipped- at a
glass of water the attendant had just
handed him.

  “I am tremendously sorry,” called
Travis, “for the water you are drink-
ing, Amos, is a virulent poison!”

  We were all startled; but Amos,
grinning sheepishly, in a gesture of
foolish bravado drained the glass.
THE IMPOSSIBLE

  “Great God!” came from the lips
of the onlookers as the limp body of
Amos Green sagged and slipped for-
ward on the floor with a soft thud.

‘ ‘ Broome—Broome! ’ ’

  But Dr. Broome was already kneel-
ing beside the still, prostrate form.

 “Dead!” he whispered in an
awed voice. “Travis, you must in-
deed have eaten of the Fruit of the
Tree of Life and Death! ’ ’ Then, his
voice ringing with fury: “I thought
at first you wTere joking—that you
might have connived with Green—
but the man is a corpse! ’ ’

  A shiver, creeping flesh, sudden
chills seized upon me. I wanted to
rush from the room, felt an impulse
to scream, yet something seemed to
hold me fast in my chair and stilled
the shriek unborn upon my cold lips.

  “Pardon me, Doctor,” said Travis.
‘ ‘ Please make no mistake; you have
tested the body for signs of life?”
Broome drew himself up. “I think
that there can be no reflection upon
my professional conduct, sir! Would
that I were mistaken ! I have ap-
plied every known means of ascer-
taining life and it is an unquestion-
able fact that the man is dead, a
corpse. There is no respiration; no
action of the heart, lungs, or other
organs. The man is dead! ”

  “Please do not think that I wish to
discredit you, Doctor. But will you
stake your professional reputation
upon your statement that Amos
Green is without life?”
Unhesitatingly came Broome’s an-
swer: “Absolutely!”

  Our attention had been centered
upon Travis and the doctor. The
former pointed out, “Then may I
call your attention to the presumed
corpse?”

  We turned—to see Amos Green in
the act of rising to his feet; the
muscles of his throat were contract-
ing as though he were but taking up
the thread of life at the very point at

which he had left it.. He was swal-
lowing that last sip of water!

  Broome, poor soul, felt his way to
a chair and sank into it, consterna-
tion written upon his features; while
Amos, dazed and uncomprehending,
stared queerly at Travis.

 “Once again,” commented the
wanderer, “I have proved that the
impossible can not be done. Oh, I
realize that it appeared to be such!
But consider well: Dr. Broome—to
whom I now extend my apologies for
my seeming discourtesy—declared
Amos to be dead. The question in
your minds is: Was he really dead?
I shall permit you to answer that
question for yourselves; but, accept-
ing the doctor’s statement, we shall
assume that Green was, in fact, with-
out life. I killed him; and then I
brought him back to life. He now
lives, none the worse for his brief so-
journ in that outer world about
which we mortals know nothing.
But the point I wish to stress is this:
assuming that I did kill him, and as-
suming that "I did bring him to life
again, then, as you have seen this
with your own eyes it can not have
been an impossibility! There is no
such thing as doing the impossible!”

  “You lie!” came a strange, small
voice from behind the semicircle of
chairs about Travis.

ing old Chinaman. How he had got-

knows, for the doors had been locked
and members of the club had been
seated in each of the large windows
which looked out. upon the teeming
streets below. No man had seen the
Chinaman enter!

  “And I repeat,” the ancient spoke
again, “that you lie! The impossible
has been done—and shall be done
again!’ ’

  Senses whirling, uncomprehending,
I turned back to face Travis; and
38

surely if ever one man saw another
undergo a living hell, then I wit-
nessed all the torture of devilish in-
genuity being concentrated upon the
soul of the man I knew as Travis.

  There is a legend that, his soul hav-
ing been so great, Lincoln’s body
shrank in dimension upon that sours
departure; and now, before my very
eyes, I saw the body of my friend
shrink, and I knew that his soul had
left him, that it had gone out into
the ether to combat that of the China-
man. Here in this room a tremen-
dous battle of will-power was raging.

  I saw great beads of sweet break
out on Travis’ forehead. His eyes
were wide, staring; then, with a little
jerking of his flesh, he was himself
again.

  “You are too much for me, I ad-
mit,” he smiled..

  The Chinaman seemed to pity him.

‘ ‘ Think you that the pupil may teach
the master?” he asked quietly.

  Instantly I knew that it had been
from this wrinkled old Chinaman
that Travis had learned a great part
of what he knew of magic. But why
had the Chinaman followed him so
mysteriously into these rooms? Had

my friend-? My thoughts were

running wild.

  “I might choose no better time
than this to explain the situation,”
Travis was saying calmly. “Per-
haps some of you gentlemen have
been wondering just what my object
was in displaying the magic I have
learned. If you will be patient a mo-
ment, I shall satisfy your curiosity.

  “You, my friends, and myriad
hosts of human beings in every coun-
try and clime, have been, and, but
for me, always would be subject to
the age-old superstition that spirits
communicate with the living and that
with the aid and assistance of these
spirits, certain persons are able to
accomplish supernatural acts. As for
myself, I believe in God, and there
my belief ceases. I do not believe

that spirits help or restrain us, for
we are free agents.

  “Four years ago, I commenced a
world-wide search for knowledge of
Black Magic—supernaturalism—spir-
itualism—call it what you will. I
started with the assumption that,
while there is such a thing as the im-
possible, it had never been done. And,
gentlemen, I have proved my case.

  “Call back your Bible-study days;
recall the days of Moses; picture him
among the priests of Egypt, before
Pharaoh. Moses sent plagues upon,
the Egyptians—and the magicians
duplicated his miracles! Now if, as
the Bible states—and I believe it to
be true—God lent power to Moses to
perform these miracles, then who lent
power to the necromancers of Egypt ?
There, gentlemen, is a question! My
answer—and the only logical re-
joinder, so it seems to me—is that
the priests of Egypt used trickery.

 “I have shown you who are
gathered here some few things which
you could not understand, things
which bewildered you, frightened
you, and yet I have devoted but four
years to the study of magic. You,
men of scientific renown, men of
hard-headed business acumen, have
known fear this night. Consider what
groveling fear you might have felt
had you been of the masses, or of less-
er intelligence! Suppose I had been
born among magi, suckled and nour-
ished in an atmosphere of intrigue
and mysticism; do you doubt that
I might now perform even more
wondrous deeds?

  “And yet they would all have been
deeds of trickery! Of these things
which you have' seen, and of their
explanations, I shall speak further at
a later time, for I see that my es-
teemed visitor is becoming uneasy.

  “Some small satisfaction I shall
permit him by publicly admitting
that I am a thief.” Calmly, as a
ripple of disbelief swept over us,
Travis thrust his hand into an inner
THE IMPOSSIBLE

39

pocket of his coat and withdrew a
small, stained, tattered, ancient-ap-
pearing book. “I have here a chron-
icle of—but wait. I must begin at
the beginning.

  “It is well known that the magi-
cians and priests of the various East-
ern cults have kept knowledge of
magic alive by handing that wisdom
down from father to son. You might
torture or kill, but the' priests died
with their secrets of necromancy
locked in their breasts. Only to their
sons or successors would they impart
their learning. And down through
the ages, the peoples of the earth
have been as dust beneath the feet of
the sorcerers, bound to them by a
chain of fear hitherto unbreakable.
It is my purpose to break that chain!

  “And now, a moment of my his-
tory for the four years just past. A
few months here, several there, ap-
plying myself diligently and with
the aid of unlimited funds judicious-
ly spent, I passed from one sorcerer
to another, learning what each had
to impart. No need for me to go into
intricate details—time forbids. Let
it suffice that at last, a year ago, I had
seemingly reached my goal. I could
duplicate all the bags of tricks dis-
played by magicians of Egypt, India,
China. And yet I knew that some-
where there must be a source of
knowledge. I think that it cost me a
part of my soul, but I found that
source!

  “This man”—pointing to the stol-
id old Chinaman—“lived in a hovel
near a temple far from the haunts of
man. How I found him, God alone
knows. But I did find him, and, by
throwing myself whole-heartedly into
a living lie, I causcd him to believe
me a sincere and devout mem-
ber of his cult. And this little,
wrinkled old man held in the hollow
of his hand all the secrets of eternity!

  “Remember, please, that the knowl-
edge possessed by the ordinary magi-
cian or priest is but a very small

part of a great whole. Knowing com-
paratively little, he has but little to
impart to his son or successor. So
great are the secrets combined that
no man could ever hope to master
one tenth part of them; and so, per-
force, they must be written. This
book”—holding aloft the stained and
tattered parchment—“holds within
its covers the answer to every mys-
tery of the universe! I stole it from
this Chinaman—for all humanity I
beqame a thief.

  “And now you know why I have
come to you with these astounding
revelations; now you comprehend
why I have performed these acts of
magic tonight. I know that I have
convinced you that I am telling the
truth; and, together, we shall bend
every effort, lend every aid to broad-
cast to the world these logical and
simple explanations of hitherto in-
explicable mysteries of the super-
natural. And when we shall have
informed the world of the insidious
evil of the magi, then we shall have
removed for all time the clutching,
clawing grasp of fear from the hearts
of those who know no better than to
give credence to the supernatural! ’ ’

Exhausted by the force of his
fierce passion, Travis smiled tri-
umphantly at the Chinaman. “This
sorcerer’s presence, sirs, can mean
but one thing. He has trailed me,
over thousands of miles, intent upon
regaining possession of this book; for
exposure of its contents will wreak
incalculable ruin to the carefully
nurtured, age-old belief. Well”—
smiling into the Chinaman’s eyes—
“he shall not have it!”

  The Chinaman made no remon-
strance; he remained still and silent
as a carven statue.

  Travis thrust out the book, so that
the Chinaman’s eyes might fall upon
it. “Pei’mit me to point out to you,”
he said, “that while I did not suc-
ceed in overpowering your will, a

few minutes past, yet at the same
time you found to your sorrow that
you could not conquer my own.
Checkmate! Physically you are un-
able to overcome me; and you know
quite well that, sorcerer though you
are, I can thwart your magic with
other magic equally as powerful.
Therefore, I shall keep the book. ’ ’
Now, for the first time, the China-
man moved. There was something
sinister about his sinuous, gliding mo-
tion, and I felt a premonition of im-
pending evil, terror, horror!

  The Chinaman halted, spoke swift-
ly. ‘ ‘ One thing you forget; you have
not yet mastered all the secrets—you
are a fool! I know a thousandfold
more than you. Can you hope to re-
sist the accumulated knowledge of
eons of time?”

  I perceived a sardonic twitching at
Travis’ mouth.

  “I read your thoughts—you should
have guarded them more carefully.”
This was Travis’ answer to the
Chinaman. “You are thinking that
this book is written in the very oldest
form of written language, and that
you alone possess the key whereby the
writings become legible and in-
telligible. But you are wrong in
your assumption.” Travis’ voice
rang shrilly in my ears as he turned
from the Chinaman to us who were
his friends. “You may not believe
me when I tell you this thing; but
that man does not understand one
word of English, and he has been
speaking in the purest of the Mongo-
lian dialects. Yet you and I have
understood him perfectly, and he has
understood every word I have ut-
tered. The explanation is merely—
telepathy. When I speak, the
thought-wave is impelled from my
brain in perfect synchronization with
the spoken word, and it is the thought
which he has understood; likewise
our comprehension of his speech.
Now, it is true that, as an ordinary
man, I might never hope to read the

contents of this record, for any at-
tempt to decipher it would result in
failure. But what this master ne-
cromancer has forgotten is that when
these writings were put on parch-
ment by the guiding genius of Black
Magic, it was merely thought trans-
ferred to paper and that thought is
ever the same, changeless. I have
but to concentrate, and this ancient
thought instantly becomes intelli-
gible-”

  A wailing shriek broke from the
lips of the Chinaman; shrill, terrify-
ing in its intensity. His face blazed
with the demoniacal fury of a man
gone mad with rage and hatred. Too
late, he realized that Travis could, in-
deed, solve all that which he would
have given his life to conceal.

Why we of the Wanderlust Club
did not interfere none of us
was ever able to ascertain, after-
ward; it was as if we were chained
to our chairs by an irresistible force.

  Travis and the Chinaman were
almost face to face; their eyes burned
queerly as will-power met will-power
in mortal, terrific struggle. How long
they stood thus I do not know; it
seemed years, yet it could have been
at most only a few minutes.

  They say that a Chinaman’s fea-
tures do not betray his inner emo-
tions; still, I fancied that I saw a
trace of chagrin, of disappointment,
on the face of this little, wrinkled,
dried-up old Chinaman. For a mo-
ment he was baffled—even I knew
that. And then I saw him concen-
trating upon the book in Travis’
hand.

  The atmosphere of the room be-
came super-charged with a crackling,
rending power one could almost hear!
Then came a blinding flash of light;
an odor of burning parchment.

  In the very hands of Travis, the
books of secrets had burst into a dev-
astating flame!
THE IMPOSSIBLE

41

  “You devil from hell!” screamed
Travis. “That secret—lost to the
world since the day of the priests of
Baal and the Prophet! God sent de-
vouring fire upon the water-soaked
altar and the priests of Baal could
not duplicate the feat because the
only one of their number who knew
the secret of devouring fire had van-
ished. Lost throughout the ages;
and it now appears at the command
of this necromancer!”

  The Chinaman flicked a skinny,
clawlike hand in the direction of the
ashes upon the floor. “I told you
there were secrets which you did not
know,” he commented softly. “And

there are yet other mysteries-”

  Travis whipped out an ugly, squat-
looking automatic. “You have pre-
vented me from publishing that rec-
ord of deviltry,” he said, “yet I can
not permit you to return to your
temple and continue the breeding of
evil to visit upon the ignorant and
ill-advised. As you have destroyed
that which would have liberated the
world from fear, so I shall destroy
you.”

  There was a cold finality in his
voice; and scarce had the words left
his lips than he fired. The shot re-
verberated through the room. Came
the fumes of burned powder, acrid.
But the Chinaman was still standing,
unmoved.

  An expression of incredulity
touched Travis’ face. I could see the
puzzled, dazed, uncomprehending
look in his eyes, for at that distance
he could not have missed. He
squeezed the stock of the automatic
yet again—and again.

  Almost together those two last
shots; almost as one, so rapidly were
they fired.

  And the Chinaman had not moved
—until now. With one swift step he

reached the person of the man who
was my friend, and I saw a glittering
flash of gleaming metal.

  Travis crumpled. His body bent
in the middle, sagging; then he
crashed to the floor.

  “A little knowledge is a dangerous
thing,” murmured the Chinaman,
quite distinctly. A queer glint of a
peculiarly greenish tint showed in
his eyes. Then slowly, slowly, his
lids drooped lower and lower. As
his eyes were masked by those lower-
ing lids, he toppled as might a tower
undermined at its base, and fell to
the floor beside the body of Travis.

  The spell was broken; for the first
time in an hour I moved. Travis
was in my arms, his life-blood stain-
ing my garments, while all about me
I heard horrified cries.

  Stark terror depicted upon their
faces, they backed away from those
still bodies; all but Dr. Broome, who
was now crouched beside me.

  I, too, arose and backed away. We
waited an eternity.

  As Broome turned, there was an
awed hush.

  ‘ ‘ Travis — and that other — both
dead! Travis had learned too much,
and he has paid the penalty. For,
alone, he could not overthrow that
which had existed since first the
world began.

  “Gentlemen, tonight we have seen
the Chinaman kill our friend after
three bullets had struck him. Travis
did not miss, for, in a space which
might be covered by a half-dollar
coin, three bullets smashed their way
into the Chinaman’s heart.

  “Therefore, when he took that last
step forward and killed Travis, the
Chinaman was already a dead man.”

  His voice trailed away into a whis-
per: “We have witnessed the accom-
plishment of the impossible!”
M’ ARCH 3rd, 19-: Perhaps

somebody will believe my
story. I am a plain man not
given to imagination; surely not to
lying. You have seen me, no doubt.
When you came front at the Durand
Theater you saw me. I was the last
orchestra member to come out of the
“hole”—the one at the far left.
You thought me a hunchback, per-
haps. But I am not. My fingers
are knotted a bit and I have become
a little bowed by constant playing of
the bass viol. My eyes are not what
they once were. My arms have lost
their muscular freedom. I am nerv-
ous. I know; because of this I
shrink from the sight of the front
rows at the Durand. Sometimes I
twitch more than others. It is not a
42

disease. Nor is the tightness of my
muscles age. I am but forty-two,
though I look sixty.

  I must tell this story before—
well, I will be frank in these written
words—before I pass away. For I
can not live long. My nights of toss-
ing tell me this. My weird hours of
pain and nausea tell me. I am fad-
ing—fading—fading. I will tell it all,
and maybe you, who later read, will
believe my story. God, somebody
must believe me!

  It is the story of the Unchained
Devil.

 Twenty-two years ago I was a
pupil of the violin in Munich. Had
we possessed great wealth I would
have been there as a lad of ten, for
our neighbors said that my fingers
THE UNCHAINED DEVIL

43

 were those of a genius. At twelve I
 played better than our first-violin
 now at the Durand. We did not
 know then that Grandfather Printz
 owned the dye-works at Berlin. Nor

•	did we know that he had standing
 with the German royalty. Nor did
 we know that—but I am going too
 fast.

   When I finished at Munich I was
 a concert violinist. But my time
 had come for the Prussian army. I
 rebelled. My mother rebelled and
 wept because my art would be
 crushed by three years of army serv-
 ice. One day we learned our fate
 more certainly. Father came in with
 a face aflame. A ruling of the
 throne was about to snatch from him
 his toy-inventions. He had been
 years perfecting them. He cursed
 the ruling powers and said we were
 to flee to America.

   It would take thousands of words
 to tell all of our flight. I was about
 to be free in America. I had had
 distant relatives to return with their
 stories of America and her spirit of
 freedom and her great concert-halls
 and orchestras and her chances for
 being somebody and getting some-
 where. Father sat half-hidden
 among packs of emigrant belongings
 and whispered his dreams of toy
 production when he should reach
 Boston. Mother stroked my fingers
 and told of her dreams of me as I
 stood before great masses of the rich
 who sat in decorated boxes. And
 together we laughed and cried—
 sometimes hours at a time.

   Never with us—always alone—sat
 Grandfather Printz. He sat silent
 for the ten days we were on ship-
 board. And to add to the mystery
 of his silence he leaned against what
 appeared to be a wooden coffin-box.
 It was the only possession he had
 brought, and when it. had been
 loaded by four burly deck-hands he
 had refused all information as to its
 contents. Now and then he would
 take a small book from his pocket

and write down a few German
words. He was the only one, how-
ever, among us four who knew Eng-
lish, and he spoke it as a scholar. I
learned later from Mother that he
had been—years before—in diplo-
matic service and in his early man-
hood an instructor in the university
at Gottingen.

  Perhaps it was hia great joy, per-
haps it was the strain of early
army life. Before Father could get
a hearing with American manufac-
turers he died. Grandfather took
Mother and me to a little town north
of Boston. It was then we knew of
his wealth. Much to our surprize,
he purchased a beautiful, though
small, estate near the Atlantic. On
the newly-bought grounds was a
grove of hardy trees. In the heart
of the grove he had his coffin-box
opened for the first time—though the
custom-house officers had taken off a
slat or two to estimate the duty. It
revealed a carefully-crated statue of
Baron von Bismarck.

  Grandfather was radiant as his
workmen placed it.

  “This, Franz,” he said to me,
“this is to be our inspiration—yours
and mine. This is the likeness of
the world’s greatest spirit, the em-
bodiment of all that is power and
energy and courage and craftsman-
ship and ambition. Here is our idol,
the Iron Chancellor. Sit here with
him in the grove until you catch the
mystery of his being. Ponder on the
grass by the side of this marble be-
ing until you catch his ambition.
We have our work to do—you and
I. Remember, Franz!”

  Grandfather doled out his money
solemnly, almost stubbornly. Mother
wished to seek work until I should
come into my own. but he would not
hear to it. I found him once ten
days after we had become estab-
lished. I had been sent by Mother
to Boston and had chosen to see the
harbor rather than spend my vacant
time in some place of amusement. I
44

WEIRD

came upon Grandfather. He was
silently and with rare art charting
the harbor. His surprize at seeing
me was not as great as his apparent
uneasiness. He ordered me away.
But secretly I found his notations
later. In German words he had writ-
ten upon each sheet in small char-
acters, “For the Fatherland.”

  I wonder today, if Grandfather
Printz had lived, if the fate of
France and Belgium would not have
been America’s! But he aged rap-
idly after leaving Munich and he left
us suddenly. According to his pa-
pers we shipped his remains back to
Munich—the ashes of cremation as
he had directed. The papers and
charts he wished returned to Berlin
we did not send. Mother seemed to
divine that he had, in his loyalty to
the old, been unfaithful to the new.
His funds (I do not think we ever
found all of them), Mother directed
into a finishing course for me at Bos-
ton Conservatory and my initial ca-
reer.

T will rush by two years of study
A at Boston. My chance finally
came. I was to be soloist with a
great orchestra. Mother told me
that afterward managers would flock
to me and the critics would herald
me. In anticipation of the triumph I
went to rest for a month or more
back at the little estate which
Grandfather had bought.

  Perhaps I had been there four
days—at least four—when a strange
sensation came over me. I am about
to be absolutely honest. I do not
understand the spirit world. I have
never studied the unseen forces of
Nature and Mind. I am by trade a
musician—a violinist. T merely am
writing those sensations which I
felt. I do not know that I heard
actual voices. I do not know whether
or not actual sound-waves were pro-
duced. I can only tell what I actual-
ly heard.

  It was late on a Friday afternoon.

 1 had been telling Mother of my ef-
 forts at mastering English at the
 Conservatory. Later I had gone to
 my own room and was looking about
 on the photographic prints—some of
 Munich, many more of America.
 Suddenly I saw Grandfather Printz.
 .No form at the Judgment Throne
 will ever be more real. lie appeared
 to be touched with some great zeal,
 some big enthusiasm. His words
 Avere as clear as his living voice—
 only not as loud. “Have you for-
 gotten, Franz, our inspiration—
 yours and mine ? Ponder on the
 grass by the side of this marble be-
 ing until you catch his ambition. We
 have our woi*k to do—you and I.
 Remember, Franz!”

  By nature I am obedient. Even
then—in my early twenties—I still
asked permission of my Mother for
almost anything I wished to do. She
had often smiled and told me I was
a man. But the habit was strong
upon me. Now when Grandfather
looked straight at me with unusual
animation, I never questioned the
idea that I had an hallucination. I
saw Grandfather—actual, real. His
words went into the depths of me.
I quickly obeyed. Any other course
was out of the question. Without
thinking of Mother, I almost ran
from the room. I do not recall see-
ing the buildings in the outer barn-
lot. I do not remember whether I
leapt the fence or opened the gate-
way. But ten minutes later I was
in the heart of the grove, prostrate
upon the grass—and I was looking
stedfastly upon the marble statue.

   Nor will I try to imagine how long
 I was there. The sun must have
 crept below the hill. For I saw the
 - image in the moonlight. It was as
 distinct as a fine portrait.

   My story is honest. I do not know
 how long I was there; I do not
 even know why I did not hunger.
 Crouched there, I looked upon the
 face of my Grandfather’s idol—the
 embodiment of a giant ambition. I
THE UNCHAINED DEVIL

45

do not recall being numb, though I
do not believe I changed my position
for at least three hours.

  All of a sudden that finely chiseled
face changed. I believe the sky had
beeome overcast, for it was necessary
to look more intently to see the dif-
ferent features of the face. The face
of von Bismarck faded out into an
intense blackness. I would judge
that it remained so perhaps for
three or four minutes of time. The
mystery held me closely and I stood
to my feet and came a bit eloser.
One by one the features took on a
most gruesome, hideous likeness.
The nose became more pointed and
slender than Grandfather’s idol’s;
the whole contour was longer and
thinner and sterner, if anything. Be-
fore my gaze there came into being
a face of some terrible and mighty
force or personality or being—call
it anything you will. To me it was
nothing short of the face of Satan.
Not differing from the pictured like-
nesses, it shone almost as a dull-red
sun against a stormy sky. There
was no recognition. No smile—in-
deed, there appeared to be nothing
personal.

  Yet I heard a voice. Before God’s
throne, I would still declare I heard
a voice!

 The words came slowly and yet
with a terrible power that seemed
to make them burn their way into
my consciousness. The words sank
so deep that I could scarcely breathe.
I know I was absolutely motionless.
I felt the sensation of an all-engulf-
ing power of deity—call it what you
wish. The voice was harsh and as
if strained in the production. Like
brands each word burned its way
into memory.

  “Today,” said the voiee, “is the
night of toll. All things have their
price. You have bound me for years.
You have shackled me and trodden
me down. Loose me!—loose me or
you shall die! Loose me and your
dream shall come true! Loose me

and your art shall beeome wonderful
and terrible—and your name shall be
glorious. Loose me! Loose me! I am
bound, who should be free. Loose
me and into your fingers shall flow
my power—into your soul shall then
come the rivers of ambition that
none shall stem. I am the lord of
power! I am the king of all yet
to be!”

 As quickly as the words were
spoken the direful visage faded out
and I found my eyes looking once
more upon von Bismarck. I fell to
the ground as in a great swoon.
When I awoke, Mother was weeping
over me. She said they had not
found me until dawn.

1\/T ARCH 6th: The pain of the
writing stayed my stiff fingers
from their task. You who read will
never know the labor of my record.
But I will go 011 today after my rest.
You must know. You must judge.

  When I was strong again I went
back to the statue. This time with
a strange fear that hung upon me
like a cloak. But I saw nothing.
Neither did I hear a word.

  Today I met an American girl.
She lives near by and seems to be an
artist. Yes, she told me—a sculptress.
She interested me. But I am not for
women. I have my art.

  She told me to call her Minna.
She is frail and unlike my old-coun-
try women friends.

  She asked all about my story. I
did not tell her—she is young and
beautiful and she might—well, a
woman can change one’s ambition.

 I may see her again after my
debut.

  Her eyes were large and wistful
and she—am I an egotist to think
she is drawn to me ?

  Bah, with the entire sex!

  The night before I should go to
New York for the debut I saw
Grandfather. This was the last time
I ever saw his image. He repeated
only a phrase and went from view
46

WEIRD

TALES

into the darkness of my sleeping
room. But the phrase branded me
with a swift purpose. He said:

  “This is to be our inspiration ...”

  I walked slowly this time out into
the grove. My mood was unlike any-
thing I had known. A strange re-
ceptivity possessed me completely.
I felt as one being led into an un-
known land by an untried pathway.

  I had not long to wait. The spell
did not hold by mystery as on the
first occasion. I looked about me, I
even walked about the statue and
watched the sun go down behind the
hill. I felt oddly unafraid.

  With the darkness the terrible
face crept slowly into view and I no
longer viewed my grandparent’s idol
but the being of satanic likeness and
power.

  “You will loose me, my musician!
You have accepted my terms. You
will pay the toll . . . And yours is to
be the power and glory and kingdom
forever and ever and ever.”

  The voice faded and with it the
terrible face. I turned about with
deliberate purpose and walked
slowly back to my mother, whom I
found with friends on the veranda.
I was not shaken. Nor, to be honest,
had I known that I had reached any
decisions 01* made any surrender. I
do know that a very queer sense of
relief possessed me utterly. I amused
my mother’s friends with some
stories of Conservatory life. I found
myself laughing with a strange in-
toxication. Mother even felt my
cheeks, fearing a fever had come
with the approach of my great night.
T brought out Grandfather’s ancient
tankard and, as we were all of one
blood, we drank rather heartily of
the beer and ate with enthusiasm of
the German cakes which Mother al-
ways baked with such fine skill. I
am not by nature a wit; in fact I
have always taken myself too seri-
ously. Yet on that strange night—
that eve of victory—I became a pun-
ster of the worst sort. T sang lilting

snatches of folk-song, too; and to
cap the evening’s mirth, I told the
party that on the morrow I would
play like this, and—oh God, I tell the
truth!—I actually transfixed them,
my mother most of all. At the close of
the rhapsody I had chosen, my
mother held me for minutes to her
breast and every woman in the
party kissed me with the silly senti-
mentality of the French.

  Minna was among them.

  I think she had asked Mother if
she might not hear me sometime.

  The wistfulness of her eyes! I am
twice her age at least. Why do I
even think of her a moment? We
arc unlike. She asked me for a mo-
ment in the far corner away from
the others. She showed me rough
sketches of her sculpture. She, too,
has a gift.

  But she has no ambition. She will
not go far. She managed to reply
to my question about her career by
blushing and saying a home must be
more remarkable than all the careers
in the world.

  She is. weakly sentimental that
way.

Ji/¥ ARCH 20th: What surrender
I ever made will always be a
mystery to me. I can not name an
hour when I ever said to imp or god
that I would do thus or so. But
heart decisions are unlike mind deci-
sions. The mind may speak one
thing and the heart be acting along
lines quite contrary. The heart in
its decision is still; the heart is
never loud, never boastful; but it
wins over the mind—will or nil.

  I went to my debut with no con-
cern. In fact my calm puzzled my
friends and made my mother sorrow-
ful. She had never known an artist
to feel such an abandon, such buoy-
ancy—such utter lack of concern.
(My fingers ache with their task. I
will finish another day.)

  April 2nd: I could not go on. For
days I have been in physical misery.
THE UNCHAINED DEVIL

47

I can hardly play the bass viol afc
the Durand. I am aging. I am old
and stiff—at forty-two!

  But the story. I dare not delay it.
Perhaps I can never finish it, if I
neglect my chance.

  With nimble fingers, I wish to tell
you of that great evening. But
cramped fingers can not write with
rapidity, and besides, you all have
read—ah, you have read of Franz
Printz!

  I was everything that night! Lis-
ten, for I am not a boasting, lying
man. In the name of the Blessed
Virgin, I am even thought modest.
But it is God’s truth—I was every-
thing. I was Passion running with
wild abandon down flowering gar-
den-paths to find Youth eager and
unafraid in the secret of alluring
caves. I was Power with my hand
on the river, the mill, the dynamo,
and the forge. I was Love leading
to a million sacrifices. I was fiend-
ish, wooing, haunting, and Sir Gala-
had on lioly quests. I was man in
his striving. God with forgiving,
Satan with his subtle mockeries.

  Yes, they covered me with flowers
and they shrieked their voices hoarse
because their hands could not show
me their homage. I was mobbed,
kissed and applauded until-

  When it was, I do not know. I
was heavy with drinking and only
awake enough from to time to time
to feel bare-breasted women leaning
about me. It had been a mad car-
nival of the low and beast in me.
Mother told me later that I left the
stage with critics begging for photo-
graphs and interviews. But, so she
told, I broke away in a delirium of
joy and said that I oivcd a man some-
thing and that I must first pay him!

  It was Minna who found me. How
strange are the ways of good women!
She searched for me until she found
me. She took her own reputation
into her own hands. She fell down
by my side with painted women
showering me with their hectic at-

tentions. She dragged me away
against every protest. Leaning upon
her frail shoulder I came to a park.

  The giii confessed her love for
me. But I can have none of it. I
have a work—if they will only let
me—-and they will let me—whatever
gods there be!

  Days later, when I crept back, the
critics found me and the managers
crowded upon me. For genius is
readily forgiven its dissipations. But
when I found my violin it had been
smashed. I recall vaguely that I hit
a stage-liand who stood in my way
after my last great number. And
with managers pleading for my
booking time, I discovered that I
had truly paid a price dearer than
my goal. My fingers were worked,
not by nimble and trained, but by
surely knotted muscles. My whole
being was actually warped. I could
not stand straight. I seemed muscle-
bound and every atom of vital power
seemed to have left me—helpless.
Mother and the managers spared no
expense. I was rubbed and mas-
saged ; I was bathed in every known
mineral water. But to no avail.

  I paid my toll.

  And later with difficulty I man-
aged to hold the stubby bow and for
years I have been at the Durand
with a bass viol—the purchase of the
last money given me by a broken-
hearted mother. The estate went, the
friends, all save Minna, forsook me;
God turned away from me.

  Even the Unchained Devil never
visited me again.

  But Minna came. She came night
after night to share with me the
scant luxury of a walk to my home
or the jars of a surface-car.

  She bathes my fingers.

  Last night she told me that maybe
I could come to see her work. It is
an exhibit or something. But I will
never go. I will not ruin her stand-
ing, whatever it has grown to be. I
am an outcast, a failure! . . . I could
cry from the pain of humiliation
48

WEIRD TALES

until the stars shriek back at me in
mockery.

  Love has welled np in my hard
heart. I love the girl in return—
but I am man enough never to let
her know. She is gentle—like the
whisper of new spring in Central
Park. She must have some wealth.
I do not understand it. But I will
be fair to her. I will give her no
wreck.

  April 15th: I must add this. Some
unseen power compels me. I have
just gotten word from the manager
of the Durand to whom in a moment
of terrible despair I showed these
slowly-penned pages of my life. He
says that I must be treated yet
again. That new invention and dis-
covery will play upon my tightened,
stiffened muscles and I yet will play.
He has loaned me a violin and I am
trying daily to play.

  April 20th: The Symphony Or-
chestra needs a first-violin. My con-
ductor at the Durand has recom-
mended me.

TMf AY 1st: It is evening. I have
surrendered the bass viol at
the Durand and daily they are rub-
bing my muscles. I have come to
the old estate bought by Grand-
father. It will be sunset soon. I
am here pondering on the grass by
the side of a marble statue. Some-
thing has lured, something has
called me. I do not know what; I
do not care. Only I am here to wateh
and listen—and obey.

  It is so near the dusk that I can
hardly see to write ... Oh God, the

  face is changing into the likeness of
Satan I And the lips are moving—
moving as they did so long ago. Yes,
it is the same voice and I hear the
same words.

 “Loose me! Loose me and I
will-”

  Oh, I will, I will, I will! I will
loose you and I shall play in the
Symphony with the first violins! I
shall . . .

  May 15th: It was Minna’s hand
that stopt me at the writing. It
was the warm heart of a wonder-
woman who took me away.

  “I have something to show you,
My Own!” she explained.

  Then she took me back to the
garden. Her own funds had pur-
chased it all back for me.

  Then I looked on the miracle that
is Love. And, Oh you who read my
honest story, don't forget, as I did,
that Love is more than all Art or
Genius or Power.

  This was the miracle. She had
with skilled fingers changed the
statue of Bismarck—von Bismarck
the chancellor—into a being scarce a
fourth the size—and it was the like-
ness of a little child!

  “And,” she went on, “this is to
be our new inspiration until—until
the time comes, if it ever comes,
that God shall give to us a living
child—sent from His glory-throne to
lead us aright.”

  Daily she has massaged my fingers
with more than skill.

 Today I took a bow into my
hands.

  I	can play!—I can play a violin!

hastily. “Here is an item from Mon-
day’s Journal:

  Two Motorists Die While Driving Cars

  The impulse to end their lives apparently
attacked two automobile drivers on the Al-
bemarle turnpike near Lonesome Swamp,
two miles out of Harrisonville, last night.
Carl Planz, thirty-one years old, of Martins
Falls, took his own life by shooting himself
in the head with a shotgun while seated in
his automobile, which he had parked at the
roadside where the pike passes nearest the
swamp. His remains were identified by two
letters, one addressed to his wife, the other
to his father, Joseph Planz, with whom he
was associated in the real estate business
at Martins Falls. A check lor three hun-
dred dollars and several other papers found
in his pockets completed identification.
The letters, which merely declared his in-
tention to kill himself, failed to establish
any motive for the act.

  Almost at the same time, and within a
hundred yards of the spot where Planz’s
body was found by State Trooper Henry
Anderson this morning, the body of Henry
William Nixon, of New Rochelle, N. Y.,
was discovered partly sitting, partly ly-
ing on the rear seat of his automobile,
an empty bottle of windshield cleaner lying
on the floor beside him. It is thought this
liquid, which contained a small amount of
cyanide of potassium, was used to inflict
death. Police Surgeon Stevens, who ex-
amined both bodies, declared that the men
had been dead approximately the same
length of time when brought to the station
house.

 “What think you of that, my
friend, heinf” de Grandin demanded,
looking up from the paper with one
of his direct, challenging stares.

 “Why—er-” I began, but he

interrupted.

  “Hear this,” he commanded, tak-
ing up a second paper, “this is from
the News of Tuesday:

  Mother and Daughters Die in Death Pact

  Police and heartbroken relatives are to-
day trying to trace a motive for the triple
suicide of Mrs. Ruby Westerfelt and her
daughters, Joan and Elizabeth, who per-
ished by leaping from the eighth floor of
the Hotel Dolores, Newark, late yesterday
afternoon. The women registered at the
hotel under assumed names, went immedi-
ately to the room assigned them, and ten
minutes later Miss Gladys Walsh, who oc-
cupied a room on the fourth floor, was

startled to see a dark form hurtle past
her window. A moment later a second
body flashed past on its downward flight,
and as Miss Walsh, horrified, rushed toward
the window, a loud crash sounded outside.
Looking out, Miss Walsh saw the body of a
third woman partly impaled on the spikes
of a balcony rail.

  Miss Walsh sought to aid the woman.
As she leaned from her window and
reached out with a trembling arm she
was greeted by a scream: “Don’t try! I
won’t be saved; I must go with Mother and
Sister!” A moment later the woman had
managed to free herself from the restrain-
ing iron spikes and fell to the cement area-
way four floors below.

  “And here is still another account,
this one from tonight’s paper,” he
continued, unfolding the sheet which
had caused his original protest:

  High School Co-ed Takes Life in Attic

  The family and friends of Edna May
McCarty, fifteen-year-old co-ed of Harrison-
ville High School, are at a loss to assign
a cause for her suicide early this morning.
The girl had no love affairs, as far as is
known, and had not failed in her examina-
tions. On the contrary, she had passed
the school’s latest test with flying colors.
Her mother told investigating police offi-
cials that overstudy might have temporarily
unbalanced the child’s mind. Miss Mc-
Carty’s body was found suspended from
the rafters of her father’s attic by her
mother this morning when the young
woman did not respond to a call for break-
fast and could not be found in her room
on the second floor of the house. A clothes-
line, used to hang clothes which were dried
inside the house in rainy weather, was used
to form the fatal noose.

“TVTow then, my friend,” de Gran-

    *	din reseated himself and light-
ed a vile-smelling French cigarette,
puffing furiously, till the smoke sur-
rounded his sleek, blond head like a
mephitic nimbus, “what have you to
say to those reports? Am I not right ?
Are there not too many—mordieu,
entirely too many!—suicides in our
city?”

  “All of them weren’t committed
here,” I objected practically, “and
besides, there couldn’t very well be
any connection between them. Mrs.
Westerfelt and her daughters carried
THE CURSE OF EVERARD MAUNDY

out a suicide pact, it appears, but
they certainly could have had no un-
derstanding with the two men and

the young girl-”

  “Perhaps, maybe, possibly,” he
agreed, nodding his head so vigorous-
ly that a little column of ash detached
itself from his cigarette and dropped
unnoticed on the bosom of his stiffly
starched evening shirt. “You may
be right, Friend Trowbridge, but
then, as is so often the case, you may
be entirely wrong. One thing I know:
I, Jules de Grandin, shall investigate
these cases myself personally. Cor-
dieu, they do interest me! I shall
ascertain what is the what here.”

  “Go ahead,” I encouraged. “The
investigation will keep you out of
mischief,” and I returned to the sec-
ond chapter of Haggard’s The Wan-
derer’s Necklace, a book which I have
read at least half a dozen times, yet
find as fascinating at each rereading
as when I first perused its pages.

The matter of the six suicides still
bothered him next morning.
“Trowbridge, my friend,” he asked
abruptly as he disposed of his second
helping of coffee and passed his cup
for replenishment, “why is it that
people destroy themselves?”

  “Oh,” I answered evasively, “dif-
ferent reasons, I suppose. Some are
crossed in love, some meet financial
reverses and some do it while tem-
porarily deranged.”

  “Yes,” he agreed thoughtfully,
“yet every self-murderer has a real
or fancied reason for quitting the
world, and there is apparently no
reason why any of these six poor
ones who hurled themselves into
outer darkness during the past week
should have done so. All, apparent-
ly, were well provided for, none of
them, as far as is known, had any
reason to regret the past or fear the
future; yet”—he shrugged his nar-
row shoulders significantly—“voila,
they are gone!

  “Another thing: At the FacultS
de Medicine Legal and the Surete in
Paris we keep most careful statistics,
not only on the number, but on the
manner of suicides. I do not think
your Frenchman differs radically
from your American when it comes
to taking his life, so the figures for
one nation may well be a signpost for
the other. These self-inflicted deaths,
they are not right. They do not fol-
low the rules. Men prefer to hang,
slash or shoot themselves; women
favor drowning, poison or gas; yet
here we have one of the men taking
poison, one of the women hanging
herself, and three of them jumping
to death. Norn d’un canard, I am
not satisfied with it!”

  “H’m, neither are the unfortunate
parties who killed themselves, if the
theologians are to be believed,” I re-
turned.

  “You speak right,” he returned,
then muttered dreamily to himself:
“Destruction—destruction of body
and imperilment of soul—mordieu, it
is strange, it is not righteous!” He
disposed of his coffee at a gulp and
leaped from his chair. “I go!” he
declared dramatically, turning to-
ward the door.

  “Where?”

  “Where? Where should I go, if
not to secure the history of these so
puzzling cases? I shall not rest nor
sleep nor eat until I have the string
of the mystery’s skein in my hands.”
He paused at the door, a quick, elfin
smile playing across his usually stern
features. “And should I return be-
fore my work is complete,” he sug-
gested, “I pray you, have the excel-
lent Nora prepare another of her so
magnificent apple pies for dinner.”

  Forty seconds later the front door
clicked shut, and from the dining
room’s oriel window I saw his neat
little figure, trimly encased in blue
chinchilla and gray worsted, pass
quickly down the sidewalk, his ebony
cane hammering a rapid tattoo on the

stones as it kept time to the thoughts
racing through his active brain.

“ T am desolated that my capacity
is exhausted, ’ ’ he announced that
evening as he finished his third por-
tion of deep-dish apple pie smothered
in pungent rum sauce and regarded
his empty plate sadly. “Eh bien,
perhaps it is as well. Did I eat more
I might not be able to think clearly,
and clear thought is what I shall need
this night, my friend. Come; we
must be going.”

  “Going where?” I demanded.

 “To hear the reverend and es-
timable Monsieur Maundy deliver his
sermon. ’ ’

 “Who? Everard Maundy?”

  “But of course, who else?”

  “But—but,’’ I stammered, looking
at him incredulously, “why should
we go to the tabernacle to hear this
man? I can’t say I’m particularly
impressed with his system, and—
aren’t you a Catholic, de Grandin?”
“Who can say?” he replied as he
lighted a cigarette and stared
thoughtfully at his coffee cup. “My
father was a Huguenot of the Hugue-
nots; a several times great-grandsire
of his cut his way to freedom through
the Paris streets on the fateful night
of August 24, 1572. My mother was
convent-bred, and as pious as anyone
with a sense of humor and the gift of
thinking for herself could well be.
One of my uncles—he for whom I am
named—was like a blood brother to
Darwin the magnificent, and Huxley
the scarcely less magnificent, also.
Me, I am”—he elevated his eye-
brows and shoulders at once and
pursed his lips comically—“what
should a man with such a heritage be,
my friend? But come, we delay, we
tarry, we lose time. Let us hasten.
I have a fancy to hear what this Mon-
sieur Maundy has to say, and to ob-
serve him. See, I have here tickets
for the fourth row of the hall.”

 Very much puzzled, but never

doubting that something more than
the idle wish to hear a sensational
evangelist urged the little French-
man toward the tabernacle, I rose
and accompanied him.

  “Parbleu, what a day!” he sighed
as I turned my ear toward the down-
town section. “From coroner’s office
to undertakers’ I have run; and from
undertakers’ to hospitals. I have
interviewed everyone who could shed
the smallest light on these strange
deaths, yet I seem no further ad-
vanced than when I began. What I
have found out serves only to whet
my curiosity; what I have not dis-
covered-” He spread his hands

in a world-embracing gesture and
lapsed into silence.

  The Jachin Tabernacle, where the
Rev. Everard Maundy was holding
his series of non-sectarian revival
meetings, was crowded to overflow-
ing when we arrived, but our tickets
passed us through the jostling crowd
of half-skeptical, half-believing peo-
ple who thronged the lobby, and we
were soon ensconced in seats where
every word the preacher uttered
could be heard with ease.

  Before the introductory hymn had
been finished, de Grandin mumbled
a wholly unintelligible excuse in my
ear and disappeared up the aisle, and
I settled myself in my seat to enjoy
the service as best I might.

  The Rev. Mr. Maundy was a tall,
hatchet-faced man in early middle
life, a little inclined to rant and make
use of worked-over platitudes, but
obviously sincere in the message he
had for his congregation. From the
half-cynical attitude of a regularly-
enrolled church member who looks on
revivals with a certain disdain, I
found myself taking keener and
keener interest in the story of re-
generation the preacher had to tell,
my attention compelled not so much
by his words as by the earnestness of
his manner and the wonderful stage
presence the man possessed. When
THE CURSE OF EVERARD MAUNDY

53

the ushers had taken up the collection
and the final hymn was sung-, I was
surprized to find we had been two
hours in the tabernacle. If anyone
had asked me, I should have said half
an hour would have been nearer the
time consumed by the service.

  “Eh, my friend, did you find it
interesting ? ’ ’ de Grandin asked as he
joined me in the lobby and linked his
arm in mine.

  “Yes, very,” I admitted, then,
somewhat sulkily: “I thought you
wanted to hear him, too—it was your
idea that we came here—what made
you run away?”

  “I am sorry,” he replied with a
chuckle which belied his words, “but
it was necessaire that I fry other fish
while you listened to the reverend
gentleman’s discourse. Will you
drive me home?”

 The March wind cut shrewdly
through my overcoat after the super-
heated atmosphere of the tabernacle,
and I felt myself shivering involun-
tarily more than once as we drove
through the quiet streets. Strangely,
too, I felt rather sleepy and ill
at ease. By the time we reached
the wide, tree-bordered avenue before
my house I was conscious of a dis-
tinctly unpleasant sensation, a con-
stantly-growing feeling of malaise, a
sort of baseless, irritating uneasiness.
Thoughts of years long forgotten
seemed summoned to my memory
without rime or reason. An incident
of an unfair advantage I had taken
of a younger boy while at public
school, recollections of petty, useless
lies and bits of naughtiness com-
mitted when I could not have been
more than three came flooding back
on my consciousness, finally an epi-
sode of my early youth which I had
forgotten some forty years.

  My father had brought a little
stray kitten into the house, and I,
with the tiny lad’s unconscious
cruelty, had fallen to teasing the
wretched bundle of bedraggled fur,

finally tossing it nearly to the ceiling
to test the tale I had so often heard
that a cat always lands on its feet.
My experiment was the exception
which demonstrated the rule, it
seemed, for the poor, half-starved fe-
line hit the hardwood floor squarely
on its back, struggled feebly a mo-
ment, then yielded up its- entire nine-
fold expectancy of life. *

  Long after the smart of the whip-
ping I received in consequence had
been forgotten, the memory of that
unintentional murder had plagued
my boyish conscience, and many were
the times I had awakened at dead of
night, weeping bitter repentance out
upon my pillow.

  Now, some forty years later, the
thought of that kitten’s death came
back as clearly as the night the un-
kempt little thing thrashed out its
life upon our kitchen floor. Strive as
I would, I could not drive the mem-
ory from me, and it seemed as though
the unwitting crime of my childhood
was assuming an enormity out of all
proportion to its true importance.

  I shook my head and passed my
hand across my brow, as a sleeper
suddenly wakened does to drive away *
the lingering memory of an unpleas-
ant dream, but the kitten’s ghost, like
Banquo’s, would not down.

  “What is it, Friend Trowbridge?”
de Grandin asked as he eyed me
shrewdly.

  “Oh, nothing,” I replied as I
parked the car before our door and
leaped to the curb, “I was just
thinking..”

  “Ah?” he responded on a rising
accent. “And of what do you think,
my friend? Something unpleasant?”
“Oh, no; nothing important
enough to dignify by that term,” I
answered shortly, and led the way to
the house, keeping well ahead of him,
lest he push his inquiries farther.

  In this, however, I did him wrong.
Tactful women and Jules de Grandin
have the talent of feeling without be-
54

ing told when conversation is unwel-
come, and besides wishing me a pleas-
ant good-night, he spoke not a word
until we had gone upstairs to bed.
As I was opening my door, he called
down the hall, ‘ ‘ Should you want me,
remember, you have but to call.”

  ‘ ‘ Humph! ” I muttered ungracious-
ly as I shut the door. “Want him?
What the devil should I want him
for ? ’7 And so I pulled off my clothes
and climbed into bed, the thought of
the murdered kitten still with me and
annoying me more by its persistence
than by the faint sting of remorse
it evoked.

How long I had slept I do not
know, but I do know I was wide-
awake in a single second, sitting up
in bed and staring through the dark-
ened chamber with eyes which strove
desperately to pierce the gloom.

  Somewhere—whether far or near I
could not tell—a cat had raised its
voice in a long-drawn, wailing cry,
kept silence a moment, then given
tongue again with increased volume.

  There are few sounds moi’e eery to
hear in the dead of night than the
cry of a prowling feline, and this one
was of a particularly sad, almost re-
proachful tone.

  ‘‘Confound the beast!” I ex-
claimed angrily, and lay back on my
pillow, striving vainly to recapture
my broken sleep.

  Again the wail sounded, indefinite
as to location, but louder, more pro-
longed, even, it seemed, fiercer in its
timbre than when I first heard it in
my sleep.

  I glanced toward the window with
the vague thought of hurling a book
or boot or other handy missile at the
disturber, then held my breath in
sudden affright. Staring through the
aperture between the scrim curtains
was the biggest, most ferocious-look-
ing tom-cat I had ever seen. Its eyes,
seemingly as large as butter dishes,
glared at me with the green phos-

phorescence of its tribe, and with an
added demoniacal glow the like of
which I had never seen. Its red
mouth, opened to full compass in a
venomous, soundless “spit,” seemed
almost as large as that of a lion, and
the wicked, pointed ears above its
rounded face were laid back against
its head, as though it were crouching
for combat.

  “Get out! Seat!” I called feebly,
but making no move toward the
thing..

  “S-s-s-sssh!” a hiss of incom-
parable fury answered me, and the
creature put one heavy, padded paw
tentatively over the window-sill, still
regarding me with its unchanging,
hateful stare.

  “Get!” I repeated, and stopped
abruptly. Before my eyes the great
beast was growing, increasing in size
till its chest and shoulders completely
blocked the window. Should it at-
tack me I would be as helpless in its
claws as a Hindoo under the paws of
a Bengal tiger.

  Slowly, stealthily, its cushioned
feet making no sound as it set them
down daintily, the monstrous crea-
ture advanced into the room,
crouched on its haunches and re-
garded me steadily, wickedly, malevo-
lently.

  I rose a little higher on my elbow.
The great brute twitched the tip of
its sable tail warningly, half lifted
one of its forepaws from the floor,
and set it down again, never shifting
its sulfurous eyes from my face.

  Inch by inch I moved my farther
foot from the bed, felt the floor be-
neath it, and pivoted slowly in a sit-
ting position until my other foot was
free of the bedclothes. Apparently
the cat did not notice my strategy,
for it made no menacing move till I
flexed my muscles for a leap, sudden-
ly flung myself from the bedstead,
and leaped toward the door.

  With a snarl, white teeth flashing,
green eyes glaring, ears laid back, the
THE CURSE OF EVERARD MAUNDY

55

beast moved between me and the exit,
and began slowly advancing on me,
hate and menace in every line of its
giant body.

  I gave gronnd before it, retreating
step by step and striving desperately
to hold its eyes with mine, as I had
heard hnnters sometimes do when
suddenly confronted by wild animals.

  Back, back I crept, the ogreish
visitant keeping pace with my re-
treat, never suffering me to increase
the distance between us.

  I felt the cold draft of the window
on my back; the pressure of the sill
against me; behind me, from the
waist up, was the open night, before
me the slowly advancing monster.

  It was a thirty-foot drop to a ce-
mented roadway, but death on the
pavement was preferable to the slash-
ing claws and grinding teeth of the
terrible thing creeping toward me.

  I threw one leg over the sill, watch-
ing constantly, lest the cat-thing
leap on me before I could cheat it by

dashing myself to the ground-

  “Trowbridge, mon Bicu, Trow-
bridge, my friend! What is it. you
would do?” The frenzied hail of
Jules de Grandin cut through the
dark, and a flood of light from the
hallway swept into the room as he
flung the door violently open and
raced across the room, seizing my arm
in both hands and dragging me from
the window.

 “Look out, de Grandin!” I
screamed. “The cat! It’ll get you!”
“Cat?” he echoed, looking about
him uncomprehendingly. “Do you
say ‘cat’, my friend? A cat will get
me? Mort d’un chou, the cat which
can make a mouse of Jules de Gran-
din is not yet whelped! Where is it,
this cat of yours?”

  “There! Th-” I began, then

stopped, rubbing my eyes. The room
was empty. Save for de Grandin and
me there was nothing animate in the
place.

  “But it was here,” I insisted. “I

tell you, I saw it; a great, black cat,
as big as a lion. It came in the win-
dow and crouched right over there,
and was driving me to jump to the

ground when you came-”

  “Nom d’un pore! Do you say so?”
he exclaimed, seizing my arm again
and shaking me. “Tell me of this
cat, my friend. I would learn more
of this puss-puss who comes into
Friend Trowbridge’s house, grows
great as a lion and drives him to his
death on the stones below. Ha, I
think maybe the trail of these myste-
rious deaths is not altogether lost!
Tell me more, mon ami; I would
know all—all!”

  “Of course, it was just a bad
dream, ’ ’ I concluded as I finished the
recital of my midnight visitation,
“but it seemed terribly real to me
while it lasted.”

   ‘ ‘ I doubt it not, ’ ’ he agreed with a
quick, nervous nod. “And on our
way from the tabernacle tonight, my
friend, I noticed you were much dis-
trait. Were you, perhaps, feeling ill
at the time?”

  “Not at all,” I replied. “The
truth is, I was remembering some-
thing which occurred when I was a
lad four or five years old; something
which had to do with a kitten I
killed,” and I told him the whole
wretched business.

  “U’m?” he commented when I
had done. “You arc a good man,
Trowbridge, my friend. In all your
life, since you attained to years of
discretion, I do not believe you have
done a wicked or ignoble act.”

  “Oh, I wouldn’t say that,” I re-
turned, “we all-”

   “Parbleu, I have said it. That kit-
ten incident, now, is probably the
single tiny skeleton in the entire
closet of your existence, yet sustained
thought upon it will magnify it even
as the cat of your dream grew from
cat’s to lion’s size. Pardieu, my
friend, I am not so sure you did
dream- of that abomination in the
56

WEIRD TALE*

shape of a cat which visited you. Sup-
pose-” he broke off, staring in-
tently before him, twisting first one,
then the other end of his trimly
waxed mustache.

  ‘‘Suppose wliat?” I prompted.

  “Non, we will suppose nothing to-
night,” he replied. “You will please
go to sleep once more, my friend, and
I shall remain in the room to frighten
away any more dream-demons which
may come to plague you. Come, let
us sleep. Here I do remain.” He
leaped into the wide bed beside me
and pulled the down comforter snug-
ly up about his pointed chin.

  “. . . . and I’d like very much to
have you come right over to see her,
if you will,” Mrs. Weaver finished.
“I can't imagine whatever made her
attempt such a thing—she’s never
shown any signs of it before.”

  I hung up the telephone receiver
and turned to de Grandin. “Here’s
another suicide, or almost-suieide,
for you,” I told him half teasingly.
“The daughter of one of my patients
attempted her life by hanging in the
bathroom this morning.”

  “Par la fete bleu, do you tell me
so?” he exclaimed eagerly. “I go
with you, chcr ami. I see this young
woman; I examine her. Perhaps I
shall find some key to the riddle
there. Parblcu, me, I itch, I burn, I
am all on fire with this mystery! Cer-
tainly, there must be an answer to it;
but it. remains hidden like a peasant’s
pig when the tax collector arrives.”

“YVELL> •rcmnS lady, what’s this I

  ’ * hear about you?” I demand-
ed severely as we entered Grace
Weaver’s bedroom a few minutes
later. “What on earth have you to
die for?”

  “I—I don’t know what made me
want to do it. Doctor,” the girl im-
plied with a wan smile. “I hadn’t
thought of it before—ever. But T
just got to—oh, you know, sort of

brooding over things last night, and
when I went into the bathroom this
morning, something—something in-
side my head, like those ringing
noises you hear when you have a
head-cold, you know—seemed to be
whispering, ‘Go on, kill yourself;
you’ve nothing to live for. Go on,
do it! ’ So I just stood on the scales
and took the cord from my bathrobe
and tied it over the transom, then
knotted the other end about my neck.
Then I kicked the scales away and”
—she gave another faint smile—
“I'm glad I hadn’t locked the door
before I did it,” she admitted.

  De Grandin had been staring un-
winkingly at her with his curiously
level glance throughout her recital.
As she conchided he bent forward
and asked: “This voice which you
heard bidding you commit an un-
pardonable sin, Mademoiselle, did
you, perhaps, recognize it?”

  The girl shuddered. “No!” she
replied, but a sudden paling of her
face about the lips gave the lie to her
word.

  ‘ ‘ Pardonn cz-moi, Madem oiselle, ’ ’
the Frenchman returned. “I think
you do not tell the truth. Now, whose
voice was it, if you please?”

  A sullen, stubborn look spread over
the girl’s features, to be replaced a
moment later by the muscular spasm
which preludes weeping. “It—it
sounded like Fanny’s,” she cried,
and turning her face to the pillow,
fell to sobbing bitterly.

 “And Fanny, who is she?” de
Grandin began, but Mrs. Weaver
motioned him to silence with an im-
ploring gesture.

  I prescribed a mild bromide and
left the patient, wondering what mad
impulse could have led a girl in the
first flush of youne womanhood, hap-
pily situated in the home of parents
who idolized her, engaged to a fine
young man, and without bodily or
spiritual ill of any sort, to attempt
her life. Outside, de Grandin seized
THE CURSE OF EVERARD MAUNDY

57

the mother’s arm and whispered
fiercely: “Who is this Fanny, Ma-
dame Weaver? Believe me, I ask not
from idle curiosity, but because I seek
vital information! ’ ’

  “Fanny Briggs was Grace’s chum
two years ago,” Mrs. Weaver an-
swered. “My husband and I never
quite approved of her, for she was
several years older than Grace, and
had such pronounced modern ideas
that we didn’t think her a suitable
companion for our daughter, but you
know how girls are with their
'crushes’. The more we objected to
her going with Fanny, the more she
used to seek her company, and we
were both at our wits’ ends when the
Briggs girl was drowned while swim-
ming at Asbury Park. I hate to say
it, but it was almost a positive relief
to us when the news came. Grace
was almost broken-hearted about it
at first, but she met Charley this
summer, and I haven’t heard her
mention Fanny’s name since her en-
gagement until just now.”

  “Ah?” de Grandin tweaked the
tip of his mustache meditatively.
“And perhaps Mademoiselle Grace
was somewhere to be reminded of
Mademoiselle Fanny last night?”
“No,” Mrs. Weaver replied, “she
went with a crowd of young folks to
hear Maundy preach. There was a
big party of them at the tabeffiaele—
I’m afraid they went more to make
fun than in a religious frame of
mind, but he made quite an impres-
sion on Grace, she told us.”

  “Feu de Dieu!” de Grandin ex-
ploded, twisting his mustache furi-
ously. “Do you tell me so, Madamef
This is of the interest. Madame, I
salute you,” he bowed formally to
Mrs. Weaver, then seized me by the
arm and fairly dragged me away.

  “Trowbridge, my friend,” he in-
formed me as we descended the steps
of the Weaver portico, “this business,
it has Vodeur du poisson—how is it
you say?—the fishy smell.”

  “What do you mean?” I asked.

  “Parbleu, what should I mean ex-
cept that we go to interview this Mon-
sieur Everard Maundy immediately,
right away, at once? Mordicu, I
damn think I have the tail of this
mystery in my hand, and may the
blight of prohibition fall upon France
if I do not twist it!”

npHE Rev. Everard Maundy’s rooms
in the Tremont Hotel were not
hard to locate, for a constant stream
of visitors went to and from them.

  “Have you an appointment with
Mr. Maundy?” the secretary asked
as we were ushered into the ante-
room.

  “Not we,” de Grandin denied,
“but if you will be so kind as to tell
him that Dr. Jules de Grandin, of the
Paris Surete, desires to speak with
him for five small minutes, I shall be
in your debt.”

  The young man looked doubtful,
but de Grandin’s steady, catlike stare
never wavered, and he finally rose
and took our message to his employer.

  In a few minutes he returned and
admitted us to the big room where
the evangelist received his callers be-
hind a wide, flat-topped desk.

  “Ah, Mr. de Grandin,” the ex-
horter began with a professionally
bland smile as we entered, “you are
from France, are you not, sir? What
can I do to help you toward the
light ? ’ ’

  “Cordieu, Monsieur,” de Grandin
barked, for once forgetting his cour-
tesy and ignoring the preacher’s out-
stretched hand, “you can do much.
You can explain these so unexplain-
able suicides which have taken place
during the past week—the time you
have preached here. That is the light
we do desire to see.”

  Maundy’s face went masklike and
expressionless. “Suicides? Suicides?”
he echoed. “What should I know
of-”

  The Frenchman shrugged his nar-
row shoulders impatiently. “We do
fence with words, Monsieur,'’ he in-
terrupted testily. ‘ ‘ Behold the facts:
Messieurs Planz and Nixon, young
men with no reason for such desper-
ate deeds, did kill themselves by vi-
olence; Madame Westerfelt and her
two daughters, who were happy in
their home, as everyone thought, did
hurl themselves from an hotel win-
dow; a little schoolgirl hanged her-
self ; last night my good friend Trow-
bridge, who never understandingly
harmed man or beast, and whose life
is dedicated to the healing of the sick,
did almost take his life; and this very
morning a young girl, wealthy, be-
loved, with every reason to be happy,
did almost succeed in dispatching
herself.

  “Now, Monsieur le predicateur, the
only thing this miscellaneous assort-
ment of persons had in common is the
fact that each of them, did hear you
preach the night before, or the same
night, he attempted self-destruction.
That is the light we seek. Explain
us the mystery, if you please.”

  Maundy’s lean, rugged face had
undergone a strange transformation
while the little Frenchman spoke.
Gone was his smug, professional
smirk, gone the forced and meaning-
less expression of benignity, and in
their place a look of such anguish and
horror as might rest on the face of
one who hears his sentence of damna-
tion read.

 “Don’t—don’t!” he besought,
covering his writhing face with his
hands and bowing his head upon his
desk while his shoulders shook with
deep, soul-racking sobs. “Oh, miser-
able me! My sin has found me out! ’ ’

 For a moment he wrestled in
spiritual anguish, then raised his
stricken countenance and regarded us
with tear-dimmed eyes. “I am the
greatest sinner in the world,” he an-
nounced sorrowfully. “There is no

hope for me on earth or yet in
heaven! ’ ’

  De Grandin tweaked the ends of
his mustache alternately as he gazed
curiously at the man before us.
“Monsieur,” he replied at length, “I
think you do exaggerate. There are
surely greater sinners than you. But
if you would shrive you of the sin
which gnaws your heart, I pray you
shed what light you can upon these
deaths, for there may be more to fol-
low, and who knows that I shall not
be able to stop them if you will but
tell me all?”

  “Mea culpa!” Maundy exclaimed,
and struck his chest with his clenched
fists like a Hebrew prophet of old.
‘ ‘ In my younger days, gentlemen, be-
fore I dedicated myself to the sal-
vaging of souls, I was a scoffer. What
I could not feel or weigh or measure,
I disbelieved. I mocked at all re-
ligion and sneered at all the things
which others held sacred.

  “One night I went to a Spiritual-
istic seance, intent on scoffing, and
forced my young wife to accompany
me. The medium was an old colored
woman, wrinkled, half-blind and un-
believably ignorant, but she had
something — some secret power —
which was denied the rest of us.
Even I, atheist and derider of the
truth that I was, could see that.

  “As the old woman called on the
spirits of the departed, I laughed out
loud, and told her it was all a fake.
The negress came out of her trance
and turned her deep-set, burning old
eyes on me. ‘White man,’ she said,
‘yuh is gwine ter feel mighty sorry
fo’ dem words. Ah tells yuh de
speerits can heah whut yuh says, an’
dey will take deir revenge on yuh
an’ yours—vas, an’ on dem as foilers
yuh—till yuh wishes yo’ tongue had
been cut out befo’ yuh said dem
words dis yere night.’

  ‘41 tried to laugh' at her—to curse
her for a sniveling old faker—but
there was something so terrible in
THE CURSE OF EVERARD MAUNDY

59

her wrinkled old face that the words
froze on my lips, and I hurried away.

  ‘ ‘ The next night my wife—my
young, lovely bride—drowned her-
self in the river, and I have been a
marked man ever since. Wherever I
go it is the same. God has seen fit to
open my eyes to the light of Truth
and give me words to place His mes-
sage before His people, and many
who come to sneer at. me go away be-
lievers; but wherever throngs gather
to hear me bear my testimony there
are always these tragedies. Tell me,
gentlemen”—he threw out his hands
in a gesture of surrender—"must I
forever cease to preach the message
of the Lord to His people? I have
told myself that these self-murders
would have occurred whether I came
to town or not, but—is this a judg-
ment which pursues me forever?”

  Jules de Grandin regarded him
thoughtfully. “Monsieur,” he mur-
mured, “I fear you make the mis-
takes we are all too prone to make.
You do saddle le bon Dieu with all
the sins with which the face of man
is blackened. What if this were no
judgment of heaven, but a curse of
a very different sort, hein?”

  "You mean the devil might be
striving to overthrow the effects of
my work?” the other asked, a light
of hope breaking over his haggard
face.

  “U’m, perhaps; let us take that
for our working hypothesis,” de
Grandin replied. “At present we
may not say whether it be devil or
devilkin which dogs your footsteps;
but at the least we are greatly in-
debted to you for what you have told.
Go, my friend; continue to preach
the Truth as you conceive the Truth
to be, and may the God of all peoples
uphold your hands. Me, I have other
word to do, but it may be scarcely
less important.” He bowed formally
and, turning on his heel, strode quick-
ly from the room.

  That’s the most fantastic story I
ever heard!” I declared as we
entered the hotel elevator. "The
idea! As if an ignorant old negress

could put a curse on-”

  “Zut!” de Grandin shut me off.
"You are a most excellent physician
in the State of New Jersey, Friend
Trowbridge, but have you ever been
in Martinique, or Haiti, or in the
jungles of the Congo Belgique?”

“Of course not,” I admitted,

“but-”

  “I have. I have seen things so
strange among the Voudois people
that you would wish to have me com-
mitted to a madhouse did I but relate
them to you. However, as that Mon-
sieur Kipling says, ‘that is another
story. ’ At the present we are pledged
to the solving of another mystery.
Let us go to your house. I would
think, I would consider all this busi-
ness-of-the-monkey. Pardieu, it has as
many angles as a diamond cut in
Amsterdam!”

“^pELL me, Friend Trowbridge,”
-*• he demanded as we concluded
our evening meal, “have you perhaps
among your patients some young man
who has met with a great sorrow
recently; someone who has sustained
a loss of wife 01* child or parents ? ’ ’

  I looked at him in amazement, but
the serious expression on his little
heart-shaped face told me he was in
earnest, not making some ill-timed
jest at my expense.

  “Why, yes,” I responded. “There
is young Alvin Spence. His wife
died in childbirth last June, and the
poor chap has been half beside him-
self ever since. Thank God I was
out of town at the time and didn’t
have the responsibility of the case. ’ ’
“Thank God, indeed,” de Grandin
nodded gravely. “It is not easy for
us, though we do ply our trade among
the dying, to tell those who remain
behind of their bereavement. Rut
this Monsieur Spence; will you call
60

WEIRD TALES

on him this evening? Will you give
him a ticket to the lecture of Mon-
sieur Maundy?”

  “No!” I blazed, half rising from
my chair. “I’ve known that boy
since he was a little toddler—knew
his dead wife from childhood, too;
and if you’re figuring on making him

the subject of some experiment-”

  “Softly, my friend,” he besought.

*	‘ There is a terrible Thing loose
among us. Remember the noble mar-
tyrs of science, those so magnificent
men who risked their lives that yel-
low fever and malaria should be no
more. Was not their work a holy
one? Certainly. I do but wish that
this young man may attend the lec-
ture tonight, and on my honor, I shall
guard him until all danger of at-
tempted self-murder is passed. You
will do what I say?”

  He was so earnest in his plea that,
though I felt like an accessory before
the fact in a murder, I agreed.

  Meantime, his little blue eyes snap-
ping and sparkling with the zest of
the chase, de Grandin had busied
himself with the telephone directory,
looking up a number of addresses,
culling through them, discarding
some, adding others, until he had
obtained a list of some five or six.
“Now, mon vieux,” he begged as I
made ready to visit Alvin Spence on
my treacherous errand, “I would
that you convey me to the rectory of
St. Benedict’s Church. The priest in
charge there is Irish, and the Irish
have the gift of seeing things which
you colder-blooded Saxons may not.
I must have a confab with this good
Father O’Brien before I can permit
that you interview the young Mon-
sieur Spence. Mordieu, me, I am a
scientist; no murderer!”

  I drove him past the rectory and
parked my motor at the curb, wait-
ing impatiently while he thundered
at the door with the handle of his
ebony walkin'? stick. His knock was
answered by a little old man in cler-

ical garb and a face as round and
ruddy as a winter apple.

  De Grandin spoke hurriedly to him
in a low voice, waving his hands,
shaking his head, shrugging his
shoulders, as was his wont when the
earnestness of his argument bore him
before it. The priest’s round face
showed first incredulity, then mild
skepticism, finally absorbed interest.
In a moment the pair of them had
vanished inside the house, leaving me
to cool my heels in the bitter March
air.

“'\7'ou were long enough,” I

  *	grumbled as he emerged from
the rectory.

  “Pardieu, yes, just long enough,”
he agreed. “I did accomplish my
purpose, and no visit is either too
long or too short when you can say
that. Now to the house of the good
Monsieur Spence, if you will. Mor-
dieu, but we shall see what we shall
see this night!”

Six hours later de Grandin and I
crouched shivering at the road-
side where the winding, serpentine
Albemarle Pike dips into the hol-
low beside the Lonesome Swamp. The
wind which had been trenchant as a
shrew’s tongue earlier in the'‘evening
had died away, and a hard, dull bit-
terness of cold hung over the hills
and hollows of the rolling country-
side. From the wide salt marshes
where the bay’s tide crept up to
mingle with the swamp’s brackish
waters twice a day there came great
sheets of brumous, impenetrable
vapor which shrouded the landscape
and distorted commonplace objects
into hideous, gigantic monstrosities.

  “Mort d’un petit bonhomme, my
friend,” de Grandin commented be-
tween chattering teeth, “I do not like
this place; it has an evil air. There
are spots where the very earth does
breathe of unholy deeds, and by the
sacred name of a rooster, this is one
THE CURSE OF EVERARD MAUNDY

61

such. Look you at this accursed fog.
Is it not as if the specters of those
drowned at sea were marching up
the shore this night?”

  •‘■‘Umph!” I replied, sinking my
ncck lower in the collar of my ulster
and silently cursing myself for a fool.

  A moment’s silence, then: “You
are sure Monsieur Spence must come
this way? There is no other road by
which he can reach his home?”

  “Of course not,” I answered short-
ly. “He lives out in the new Weiss
development with his mother and sis-
ter—you were there this evening—
and this is the only direct motor
route to the subdivision from the
city.”

  “Ah, that is well,” he replied,
hitching the collar of his greatcoat
higher about his ears. “You will
recognize his car—surely?”

  “I’ll try to,” I promised, “but
you can’t be sure of anything on a
night like this. I’d not guarantee to
pick out my own—there’s somebody
pulling up beside the road now,” I
interrupted myself as a roadster came
to an abrupt halt and stood panting,
its headlights forming vague, lumin-
ous spots in the haze.

  “Mais oui,” he agreed, “and no
one stops at this spot for any good
until It has been conquered. Come,
let us investigate.” He started for-
ward, body bent, head advanced,
like a motion picture conception of
an Indian on the warpath.

  Half a hundred stealthy steps
brought us abreast of the parked
ear. Its occupant was sitting back
on the driving seat, his hands resting
listlessly on the steering wheel, his
eyes upturned, as though he saw a
vision in the trailing wisps of fog
before him. I needed no second
glance to recognize Alvin Spenee,
though the rapt look upon his white,
set face transfigured it almost be-
yond recognition. He was like a
poet beholding the beatific vision of
his mistress or a medieval eremite

gazing through the opened portals of
Paradise.

  “A-a-ah!” de Oran din’s whisper
cut like a wire-edged knife through
the silence of the fog-bound air. “do
you behold it, Friend Trowbridge?”

  “Wha-” I whispered back, but

broke the syllable half uttered. Thin,
tenuous, scarcely to be distinguished
from the lazily drifting festoons of
the fog itself, there was a something
in midair before the ear where Alvin
Spence sat with his yearning soul
looking from his eyes. I seemed to
see clear through the thing, yet its
outlines were plainly perceptible, and
as I looked and looked again, I recog-
nized the unmistakable features of
Dorothy Spence, the young man’s
dead wife. Her body—if the tenu-
ous, ethereal mass of static vapor
could be ealled sueh—was bare of
clothing, and seemed endued with a
voluptuous grace and allure the liv-
ing woman had never possessed, but
her face was that of the young wo-
man who had lain in Rosedale Ceme-
tery for three-quarters of a year. If
ever living man beheld the simula-
crum of the dead, we three gazed on
the wraith of Dorothy Spence that
moment.

  “Dorothy—my beloved, my dear,
my dear!” the man half whispered,
half sobbed, stretching forth his
hands to the spirit-woman, then fall-
ing back on the seat as the vision
seemed to elude his grasp when a
sudden puff of breeze stirred the fog.

  We could not catch the answer he
received, close as we stood, but we
could see the pale, curving lips frame
the single word, “Come!” and saw
the transparent arms stretched out to
beckon him forward.

  The man half rose from his seat,
then sank back, set his face in sud-
den l’esolution and plunged his hand
into the pocket of his overcoat.

  Beside me de Orandin had been
fumbling with something in his in-
side pocket. As Alvin Spenee drew
62

WEIRD TALES

forth his hand and the dull gleam of
a polished revolver shone in the light
from his dashboard lamp, the French-
man leaped forward like a panther.
“Stop him, Friend Trowbridge!” he
called shrilly, and to the hovering
vision:

  “Avaunt, accursed one! Begone,
thou exile from heaven! Away,
snake-spawn! ”

  As he shouted he drew a tiny pellet
from his inner pocket and hurled it
point-blank through the vaporous
body of the specter.

  Even as I seized Spence’s hand and
fought with him for possession of the
pistol, I saw the transformation from
the tail of my eye. As de Grandin’s
missile tore through its unsubstantial
substance, the vision-woman seemed
to shrink in upon herself, to become
suddenly more compact, thinner,
scrawny. Her rounded bosom flat-
tened to mere folds of leatherlike skin
stretched drum-tight above staring
ribs, her slender graceful hands were
horrid, claw-tipped talons, and the
yearning, enticing face of Dorothy
Spence became a mask of hideous,
implacable hate, great-eyed, thin-
lipped, beak-nosed—such a face as
the demons of hell might show after a
million million years of burning in
the infernal fires. A screech like the
keening of all the owls in the world
together split the fog-wrapped still-
ness of the night, and the monstrous
thing before us seemed suddenly to
shrivel, shrink to a mere spot of bale-
ful, phosphorescent fire, and disap-
pear like a snuffed-out candle’s
flame.

  Spence saw it, too. The pistol
dropped from his nerveless fingers to
the ear’s floor with a soft thud, and
his arm went limp in my grasp as he
fell forward in a dead faint.

 “Parbleu,” de Grandin swore
softly as he climbed into the uncon-
scious lad’s car. “Let us drive for-
ward, Friend Trowbridge. We will
take him home and administer a

soporific. He must sleep, this poor
one, or the memory of what we have
shown him will rob him of his rea-
son. ’ ’

  So we carried Alvin Spence to his
home, administered a hypnotic and
left him in the care of his wondering
mother with instructions to repeat
the dose if he should wake.

It was a mile or more to the nearest
bus station, and we set out at a
brisk walk, our heels hitting sharply
against the frosty concrete of the
road.

 “What in the world was it, de
Grandin?” I asked as we marched in
step down the darkened highway.

“It was the most horrible-”

  “Parbleu,” he interrupted, “some-
one comes this way in a monstrous
hurry!”

  His remark was no exaggeration.
Driven as though pursued by all the
furies from pandemonium, came a
light motor car with plain black sides
and a curving top. “Look out!” the
driver warned as he recognized me
and came to a bumping halt. “Look
out, Dr. Trowbridge, it’s walking! It
got out and walked! ’ ’

  De Grandin regarded him with an
expression of comic bewilderment.
“Now what is it that walks, mon
brave?” he demanded. “Mordicu,
you chatter like a monkey with a
handful of hot chestnuts! What is
it that walks, and why must we look
out for it, heinf”

 “Sile Gregory,” the young man
answered. “He died this mornin’,
an’ Mr. Johnson took him to th’ par-
lors to fix ’im up, an’ sent me an’
Joe Williams out with him this
evenin’. I was just drivin’ up to th’
house, an’ Joe hopped out to give me
a lift with th’ casket, an’ old Silas
got up an’ walked away! An’ Mr.
Johnson embalmed ’im this mornin’,
I tell you! ’ ’

  “Nom d’xin chou-fleur!” de Gran-
din shot back. “Arid where did this
THE CURSE OF EVERARD MAUNDY

63

so remarkable demonstration take
place, mon vieux? Also, what of the
excellent Williams, your partner?”
“I don’t know, an’ I don’t care,”
the other replied. "When a dead
corpse I saw embalmed this mornin’
gets outa its casket an’ walks, I ain’t
gonna wait for nobody. Jump up
here, if you want to go with me; I
ain’t gonna stay here no longer!”

 "Biende Grandin acquiesced.
‘ ‘ Go your way, my excellent one.
Should we encounter your truant
corpse, we will direct him to his wait-
ing biere.”

  The young man waited no second
invitation, but started his car down
the road at a speed which would
bring him into certain trouble if ob-
served by a state trooper.

  "Now, what the devil do you make
of that?” I asked. "I know John-
son, the funeral director, well, and I
always thought he had a pretty level-
headed crowd of boys about his place,
but if that lad hasn’t been drinking

some powerful liquor, I’ll be-”

  "Not necessarily, my friend,” de
Grandin interrupted. "I think it
not at all impossible that he tells but
the sober truth. It may well be that
the dead do walk this road tonight.”
I shivered with something other
than the night’s chill as he made the
matter-of-fact assertion, but forbore
pressing him for an explanation.
There are times when ignorance is a
happier portion than knowledge.

  We had marched perhaps another
quarter-mile in silence when de Gran-
din suddenly plucked my sleeve.
“Have you noticed nothing, my
friend?” he asked.

  “What d’ye mean?” I demanded
sharply, for my nerves were worn
tender by the night ’s events.

  “I am not certain, but it seems to
me we are followed.”

  “Followed? Nonsense! Wlio would
be following us?” I returned, uncon-
sciously stressing the personal pro-
noun, for I had almost said, “What

would follow us,” and the implica-
tion raised by the impersonal form
sent tiny shivers racing along my
back and neck.

  De Grandin cast me a quick, ap-
praising glance, and I saw the ends
of his spiked mustache lift suddenly
as his lips framed a sardonic smile,
but instead of answering he swung
round on his heel and faced the
shadows behind us.

  “Hola, Monsieur le Cadavre!” he
called sharply. “Here we are, and—
sang du diable!—here we shall
stand.”

  I looked at him in open-mouthed
amazement, but his gaze was turned
stedfastly on something half seen in
the mist which lay along the road.

  Next instant my heart seemed
pounding through my ribs and my
breath came hot and choking in my
throat, for a tall, gangling man sud-
denly emerged from the fog and
made for us at a shambling gait.

  He was clothed in a long, old-
fashioned double-breasted frock coat
and stiffly starched shirt topped by a
standing collar and white, ministerial
tie. His hair was neatly, though
somewhat unnaturally, arranged in a
central part above a face the color
and smoothness of wax, and little
flecks of talcum powder still clung
here and there to his eyebrows. No
mistaking it! Johnson, artist that he
was, had arrayed the dead farmer in
the manner of all his kind for their
last public appearance before rela-
tives and friends. One look told me
the horrible, incredible truth. It was
the body of old Silas Gregory which
stumbled toward us through the fog.
Dressed, greased and powdered for
its last, long rest, the thing came
toward us with faltering, uncertain
strides, and I noticed, with the sud-
den ability for minute inventory fear
sometimes lends our senses, that his
old, sunburned skin showed more
than one brand where the formalde-
hyde embalming fluid had burned it.
64

WEIRD TALES

  In one long, thin hand the horrible
thing grasped the helve of a farm-
yard ax, the other hand lay stiffly
folded across the midriff as the em-
balmer had placed it when his pro-
fessional ministrations were finished
that morning.

  “My God!’’ I cried, shrinking
back toward the roadside. But de
Grandin ran forward to meet the
charging horror with a cry which was
almost like a welcome.

  “Stand clear, Friend Trowbridge,”
he warned, “we will fight this to a
finish, I and It!” His little, round
eyes were flashing with the zest of
combat, his mouth was set in a
straight, uncompromising line be-
neath the sharply waxed ends of his
diminutive mustache, and his shoul-
ders hunched forward like those of a
practised wrestler before he comes
to grips with his opponent.

  With a quick, whipping motion, he
ripped the razor-sharp blade of his
sword-cane from its ebony sheath and
swung the flashing steel in a whir-
ring circle about his head, then sank
to a defensive posture, one foot ad-
vanced, one retracted, the leg bent at
the knee, the triple-edged sword
dancing before him like the darting
tongue of an angry serpent.

  The dead thins; never faltered in
its stride. Three feet or so from
Jules de Grandin it swung the heavy,
rust-encrusted ax above its shoulder
and brought it downward, its dull,
lack-luster eyes staring straight be-
fore it with an impassivity more ter-
rible than any glare of hate.

 “Sa ha!” de Grandin’s blade
flickei’ed forward like a streak of
storm lightning, and fleshed itself to
the hilt in the corpse’s shoulder.

  He might as well have struck his
steel into a bag of meal.

  The ax descended with a crushing,
devastating blow.

  De Grandin leaped nimbly aside,
disengaging his blade and swinging
it again before him, but an expression

of surprize—almost of consternation
—was on his face.

  I felt my mouth go dry with ex-
citement, and a queer, weak feeling
hit me at the pit of the stomach. The
Frenchman had driven his sword
home with the skill of a practised
fencer and the precision of a skilled
anatomist. His blade had pierced
the dead man’s body at the junction
of the short head of the biceps and
the great pectoral muscle, at the
coracoid process, inflicting a wound
which should have paralyzed the arm
—yet the terrible ax rose for a sec-
ond blow as though de Grandin’s
steel had struck wide of the mark.

  “Ah?” de Grandin nodded under-
standingly as he leaped backward,
avoiding the ax-blade by the breadth
of a hair. “Bien. A la fin!”

  His defensive tactics changed
instantly. Flickeringly his sword
lashed forward, then came down and
back with a sharp, whipping motion.
The keen edge of the angular blade
bit deeply into the corpse’s wrist, lay-
ing bare the bone. Still the ax rose
and fell and rose again.

  Slash after slash de Grandin gave,
his slicing cuts falling with almost
mathematical precision in the same
spot, shearing deeper and deeper
into his dreadful opponent’s wrist.
At last, with a short, clucking ex-
clamation, he drew his blade sharply
back for the last time, severing the
ax-hand from the arm.

  The dead thing collapsed like a de-
flated balloon at his feet as hand and
ax fell together to the cement road-
way.

  Quick as a mink, de Grandin thrust
his left hand within his coat, drew
forth a pellet similar to that with
which he had transformed the coun-
terfeit of Dorothy Spence, and
hurled it straight into the upturned,
ghastly-calm face of the mutilated
body before him.

  The dead lips did not part, for the
embalmer’s sutures had closed them
THE CURSE OP EVERARD MAUNDY

65

forever that morning, but the body
writhed upward from the road, and
a groan which was a muted scream
came from its flat chest. It twisted
back and forth a moment, like a
mortally stricken serpent in its death
agony, then lay still.

  Seizing the corpse by its grave-
clothes, de Grandin dragged it
through the line of roadside hazel
bushes to the rim of the swamp, and
busied himself cutting long, straight
withes from the brushwood, then dis-
appeared again behind the tangled
branches. At last:

   ‘ ‘ It is finished, ’ ’ he remarked, step-
ping back to the road. “Let us go.”
“Wha—what did you do?” I
faltered.

  “I did the needful, my friend.
Morbleu, we had an evil, a very evil
thing imprisoned in that dead
man, and I took such precautions
as were necessary to fix it in its
prison. A stake through the heart, a
severed head, and the whole firmly
thrust into the ooze of the swamp—
voild. It will be long before other
innocent ones are induced to destroy
themselves by that.”

  “But-” I began.

  “Non, non,” he replied, half
laughing. “En avant, mon ami! I
would that we return home as quick-
ly as possible. Much work creates
much appetite, and I make small
doubt that I shall consume the re-
mainder of that so delicious apple pie
which I could not eat at dinner. ’ ’

Jules de grandin regarded the
empty plate before him with a
look of comic tragedy. “May end-
less benisons rest upon your amiable
cook, Friend Trowbridge,” he pro-
nounced, “but may the curse of
heaven forever pursue the villain who
manufactures the wofully inadequate
pans in which she bakes her pies.”
“Hang the pies, and the plate-
makers, too!” I bufst out. “You
promised to explain all this hocus-

pocus, and I've been patient long
enough. Stop sitting there like a
glutton, wailing for more pie, and
tell me about it.”

  “Oh, the mystery?” he replied,
stifling a yawn and lighting a cigar-
ette. “That is simple, my friend,
but these so delicious pies—however,
I do digress:

  “When first I saw the accounts of
so many strange suicides within one
little week I was interested, but not
greatly puzzled. People have slain
themselves since the beginning of
time, and yet”—he shrugged his
shoulders deprecatingly—“what is it
that makes the hound scent his
quarry, the war-horse sniff the battle
afar off? Who can tell?

  “I said to me: ‘There is undoubt-
lessly more to these deaths than the
newspapers have said. I shall in-
vestigate. *

  “From the coroner’s to the under-
takers’, and from the undertakers’ to
the physicians’, yes, parbleu! and to
the family residences, as well, I did
go, gleaning here a bit and there a
bit of information which seemed to
mean nothing, but which might mean
much did I but have other informa-
tion to add to it.

  “One thing I ascertained early: In
each instance the suicides had been
to hear this reverend Maundy the
night before or the same night they
did away with themselves. This was
perhaps insignificant; perhaps it
meant much. I determined to hear
this Monsieur Maundy with my own
two ears; but I would not hear him
too close by.

  “Forgive me, my friend, for I did
make of you the guinea-pig for my
laboratory experiment. You I left in
a forwai’d seat while the reverend
gentleman preached, me, I stayed in
the rear of the hall and used my eyes
as well as my ears.

  “What happened that night?
Why, my good, kind Friend Trow-
bridge, who in all his life had done

110 greater wrong than thoughtlessly
to kill a little, so harmless kitten, did
almost seemingly commit suicide.
But I was not asleep by the switch,
my friend. Not Jules de Grandin!
All the way home I saw you were dis-
trait, and I did fear something would
happen, and I did therefore watch be-
side your door with my eye and ear
alternately glued to the keyhole.
Parbleu, I entered the chamber not
one little second too soon, either!

  “ ‘This is truly strange,’ I tell me.
‘My friend hears this preacher and
nearly destroys himself. Six others
have heard him, and have quite killed
themselves. If Friend Trowbridge
were haunted by the ghost of a dead
kitten, why should not those others,
who also undoubtlessly possessed dis-
tressing memories, have been hound-
ed to their graves by them?’

  “ ‘There is no reason why they
should not,’ I tell me.

  "Next morning comes the sum-
mons to attend the young Mademoi-
selle Weaver. She, too, have heard
the preacher; she, too, have attempt-
ed her life. And what does she tell
us? That she fancied the voice of
her dead friend urged her to kill her-
self.

  "‘Ah, ha!’ I say to me. ‘This
whatever-it-is which causes so much
suicide may appeal by fear, or per-
haps by love, or by whatever will
most strongly affect the person who
dies by his own hand. We must see
this Monsieur Maundy. It is per-
haps possible he can tell us much.’

  "As yet I can see 110 light—I am
still in darkness—but far ahead I
already see the gleam of a promise
of information. When we see Mon-
sieur Everard Maundy and he tells
us of his experience at that seance
so many years ago—parbleu, I see it
all. or almost all.

  "Now, what was it acted as agent
for that aged sorceress’ curse?”

  He elevated one shoulder and
looked questioningly at me.

 "How should I know?” I an-
swered.

  "Correct,” he nodded, “how, in-
deed? Beyond doubt it were a spirit
of some sort; what sort we do not
know. Perhaps it were the spirit of
some unfortunate who had destroyed
himself and was earthbound as a
consequence. There are such. And,
as misery loves company in the
proverb, so do these wretched ones
seek to lure others to join them in
their unhappy state. Or, maybe, it
were an Elemental.”

 “A what?” I demanded.

  “An Elemental—a Neutrarian.”
  “What the deuce is that?”

  For answer he left the table and
entered the library, returning with a
small red-leather bound volume in
his hand. “You have read the works
of Monsieur Rossetti?” he asked.
“Yes.”

  “You recall his poem, Eden Bow-
ers, perhaps?”

  “H’m; yes, I’ve read it, but I
never could make anything of it.”
“Quite likely,” he agreed, “its
meaning is most obscure, but I shall
enlighten you. Attendez-moi!”
Thumbing through the thin pages
he began reading at random:

  It was Lilith, the. wife of Adam,

  Not a drop of her blood was human,

  But she was made like a soft, sweet
    woman ....

  Lilith stood on the skirts of Eden,

  She was the first that thence was driven,
  With her was hell and with Eve was
  heaven ....

  What bright babes had Lilith and Adam,
  Shapes that coiled in the woods and
  waters.

  Glittering sons and radiant daugh-
    ters ....

  “You see, my friend?”

  “No, I’m hanged if I do.”

  “Very well, then, according to the
rabbinical lore, before Eve was
created, Adam, our first father, had
a demon wife named Lilith. And by
THE CURSE OP EVERARD MAUNDY

67

her he had many children, not
human, nor yet wholly demon.

  “For her sins Lilith was expelled
from Eden’s bowers, and Adam was
given Eve to wife. With Lilith was
driven out all her progeny by Adam,
and Lilith and her half-man, half-
demon brood declared war on Adam
and Eve and their descendants for
ever. These descendants of Lilith
and Adam have ever since roamed
the earth and air, incorporeal, hav-
ing no bodies like men, yet having
always a hatred for flesh and blood.
Because they were the first, or elder
race, they are sometimes called Ele-
mentals in the ancient lore; some-
times they are called Neutrarians,
because they are neither wholly men
nor wholly devils. Me, I do not take
sides in the controversy; I care not
what they are called, but I know what
I have seen. I think it is highly pos-
sible those ancient Hebrews, misin-
terpreting the manifestations they
observed, accounted for them by
their so fantastic legends. We are
told these Neutrarians or Elementals
are immaterial beings. Absurd? Not
necessarily. What is matter—mate-
rial? Electricity, perhaps—a great
system of law and order throughout
the universe and all the millions of
worlds extending throughout infinity.

  “Very good, so far; but when we
have said matter is electricity, what
have we to say if asked, ‘What is
electricity?’ Me, I think it a modi-
fication of the ether.

  “ ‘Very good,’ you say; ‘but what
is ether?’

  “Purlieu, I do not know. The
matter—or material—of the universe
is little, if anything, more than elec-
trons flowing about in all directions.
Now here, now there, the electrons
coalesce and form what we call solids
—rocks and trees and men and wom-
en. But may they not coalesce at a
different rate of speed, or vibration,
to form beings which are real, with
emotions and loves and hates similar

to ours, yet for the most part invis-
ible to us, as is the air? Why not?
No man can truthfully say, ‘I have
seen the air,’ yet no one is so great
a fool as to doubt its existence for
that reason.”

  “Yes, but we can see the effects of
air,” I objected. “Air in motion, for

instance, becomes wind, and-”

  “Mort d’un crapaud!” he burst
out. “And have we not observed the
effects of these Elementals—these
Neutrarians, or whatsoever their
name may be? How of the six sui-
cides ; how of that which tempted the
young Mademoiselle Weaver and the
young Monsieur Spence to self-mur-
der? How of the cat which entered
your room? Did we see no effects
there, heinf”

  “But the thing we saw with young
Spence, and the cat, were visible,” I
objected.

  “But of course. When you fancied
you saw the cat, you were influenced
from within, even as Mademoiselle
Weaver was when she heard the voice
of her dead friend. What we saw
with the young Spence was the shad-
ow of his desire—the intensified love
and longing for his dead wife, plus
the evil entity which urged him to
unpardonable sin.”

  “Oh, all right,” I conceded. “Go
on with your theory.”

  He stared thoughtfully at the
glowing tip of his cigarette a mo-
ment, then: “It has been observed,
my friend, that he who goes to a
Spiritualistic seance may come away
with some evil spirit attached to him
—whether it be a spirit which once
inhabited human form or an Ele-
mental, it is no matter; the evil ones
swarm about the lowered lights of the
Spiritualistic meeting as flies congre-
gate at the honev-pot in summer. It
appeal’s such an one fastened to
Everard Maundy. His wife was its
first victim, afterward those who
heard him preach were attacked.
“Consider the scene at the taber-
68

WEIRD TALES

nacle when Monsieur Maundy
preaches: Emotion, emotion—all is
emotion; reason is lulled to sleep by
the power of his words; and the
minds of his hearers are not on their
guard against the entrance of evil
spirits; they are too intent on what
he is saying. Their consciousness is
absent. Pouf! The evil one fastens
firmly on some unwary person, ex-
plores his innermost mind, finds out
his weakest point of defense. With
you it was the kitten; with young
Mademoiselle Weaver, her dead
friend; with Monsieur Spence, his
lost wife. Even love can be turned to
evil purposes by such an one.

  “These things I did consider most
carefully, and then I did enlist the
services of young Monsieur Spence.
You saw what you saw on the lonely
road this night. Appearing to him
in the form of his dead beloved, this
wicked one had all but persuaded
him to destroy himself when we in-
tervened.

  “Tres bien. We triumphed then;
the night before I had prevented
your death. The evil one was angry
at me; also it was frightened. If I
continued, I would rob it of much
prey, so it sought to do me harm. Me,
I am ever on guard, for knowledge is
power. It could not lead me to my
death, and, being spirit, it could not
directly attack me. It had recourse
to its last resort. While the young
undertaker’s assistant was about to
deliver the body of the old Monsieur
Gregory, the spirit seized the corpse
and animated it, then pursued me.

  “Ha, almost. I thought, it had done
for me at one time, for I forgot it
was no living thing I fought, and at-
tacked it as if it could be killed. But
when T found my sword eould not kill
that which was alreadv dead, T did
cut off its so abominable hand. T am
very clever, my friend. The- evil
spirit reaped small profits from
fighting with me.”

  He made the boastful admission in

all seriousness, entirely unaware of
its sound, for to him it was but a
straightforward statement of undis-
puted fact. I grinned in spite of
myself, then curiosity got the better
of amusement. “What were those
little pellets you threw at the spirit
when it was luring young Spence to
commit suicide, and later at the
corpse of Silas Gregory?” I asked.

  “Ah”—his elfish smile flickered
across his lips, then disappeared as
quickly as it came—“it is better you
do not ask me that, won chcr. Let it
suffice when I tell you I convinced
the good Pere O ’Brien that he should
let me have what no layman is sup-
posed to touch, that I might use the
ammunition of heaven against the
forces of hell.”

  “But how do we know this Ele-
mental, or whatever it is, won’t come
back again?” I persisted.

  “Little fear,” he encouraged. “The
resort to the dead man’s body was its
last desperate chance. Having elect-
ed to fight me physically, it must
stand or fall by the result of the
fight. Once inside the body, it could
not quickly extricate itself. Half an
hour, at least, must elapse before it
could withdraw, and Before that time
had passed I had fixed it there for
all time. The stake through the heart
and the severed head makes that body
as harmless as any other, and the
wicked spirit which animated it must
remain with the flesh it sought to per-
vert to its own evil ends henceforth
and forever.”

 “But-”

  “Ah bob!” He dropped his cigar-
ette end into his emptv coffee cup
and yawned frankly. “We do talk
too much, mv friend. This night’s
work has made me heavy with sleep.
Let ns take a tinv sin of cognac, that
the r»ie mav not give us unhappy
dreams, and then to bed. Tomorrow
is another da''', and who knows what
new task lies before us?”

“Exhausted, he flung himself back
into the pew. He felt drowsy,
dreamy; he lost consciousness.”

1 NEVER read of odd and bizarre
occurrences or of happenings
which seem beyond mortal ken,
but I think of a tale related to me by
a gentleman'in whom I have the ut-
most confidence, and which is in my
experience unique; although no doubt
students of the occult, particularly in
Eastern lands, will be able to parallel
it directly it sees the light of day,
which I think it has not done before.
I shall begin to relate it without any
further prolixity.

  It was on a warm July night that I
sat with my friend Cumberland—the
Reverend Wilfred Cumberland—in
his study. The roar of London traffic
had quieted down, the stars winked
at us gravely through the pall of soft
coal smoke that still overhung the

city, and which was added to by the
clouds of smoke from our cigars. It
was very warm.

  Cumberland is by nature one of
the untidiest men I know, and as
usual his desk was littered all over
with this and that, compelling him to
pull out a drawer to support his
elbow as he sat and smoked. This
drawer was also crammed full of
heterogeneous papers, some of which
appeared to be letters recently re-
ceived, and some of which were yel-
low and cracked at the edges.

  The untidy seldom censure our
neatness, but we always feel we must
chide their want of care. "Cumber-
land,” said I, "do you never clear
out your desk?”

  “About once a year,” he replied,

                                     GO

“but it does no good. There is sel-
dom much in it that I can bear to
part with. I don’t know how others
manage, but I am irresolution itself
when it comes to destroying old pa-
pers! For instance, this is a memo-
rial pamphlet gotten out at the time
of the death of Gibbons, the first rec-
tor I served under. A fine chap. This
is a copy of some verses—worthless
I haven’t a doubt—written by one of
the boys in my Sunday School class
on the occasion of my ordination. Of
course they are funny;—they would
be merely funny to anyone else. This
is a guide to Winchester Cathedral—
I might go there again, you know. So
you see how it is. In fact, the place
seldom gets weeded out except when
I happen—hang it! I’ve done it again
now! ’ ’

  By a careless gesture with the hand
which held his cigar, he had started
what was evidently his only method
of desk-clearing—an accidental con-
flagration. The hot ash from the
tobacco had fallen into the open
drawer and the papers had started
blazing merrily. Frantically he be-
gan to pull out the bundle of pa-
pers which were burning, before the
whole contents of the drawer were in-
volved.

  He was successful in saving the
rest of his cherished trash, but when
he had flung the blazing package into
the empty grate it was itself a total
loss.

 He viewed this with dismay.
“Now see!” he cried; “there goes a
bunch of papers which I valued high-
ly. I had rather burned all the rest
of the drawer than that!”

  One glance had showed me that the
bundle contained no securities nor
anything of real value, but I tried to
conceal my amusement nevertheless.

  He continued: “Those were the
notes from which I was about to start
constructing what I hoped would be
a very interesting monograph for the
Society for the Investigation of

Psychic Phenomena. I was, indeed.”
“And you don’t recollect the story
without the papers?”

  “Quite. But there are certain de-
tails which people would expect to
find included in such an article, and
as I always have been poor on dates

and other figures-” He sighed.

  “Would the tale suffer so much
with those left out?”

  “Not as a story, I suppose, but I
fear it would be unacceptable to a
scientific magazine. . It would not
sound convincing at all. In fact I
don’t believe I could ever have made
it sound anything but impossible, so
perhaps it is no matter. ’ ’

  “There is nothing so interesting as
an improbable tale from a truthful
person, my dear chap. Won’t you
let me have it from your lips some-
time, if I am. never to have the chance
to read it in the society’s bulletin?”
“Well then,” he retorted smiling,
“no time like the present. The mist,
I see, has turned to quite a heavy
rain. I couldn’t allow you to go out
in it, unless you were extremely de-
termined! So compose yourself, my
excellent fellow, to be talked to
sleep. ’ ’

  ‘ ‘ Instruct, then, your audience of
one, since a larger one is denied you,
and in doing so crystallize your own
memories before they become dim-
mer. ’ ’

After carefully closing the drawer,
the Reverend Wilfred lit another
cigar, crossed his legs and began:

  ‘ ‘ It was when I was at Oxford that
it all happened; that must have been
thirty years ago. My failings you
know well, of course, but in one sub-
ject I never came a cropper, that of
English literature. This fact came
very near to changing the entire
course of my life. I wonder if I
should ever have been able to get
used to life in an Indian palace, and
if I should have made a good raja

when my turn came. Well, no mat-
ter. I was not obliged to, after all.”

  I stared, and he went on.

  “I sat in my study at Magdalen,
smoking, one evening, when someone
knocked on the door. As my usual
companions dispensed with that
formality, I concluded it must be a
proctor, and rose to open. Instantly
I regretted rising, for my caller was
not only merely a fellow student, but
one for whom I cared very little,
although principally for racial rea-
sons. He was an East Indian.

  “No one could say that Chundun
had anything wrong with him, yet I
strongly preferred my own color and
race; and, childishly, the fact that I
had been so courteous as to rise and
open for him, irked me.

  *	‘ ‘ Good evening, Mr. Cumberland, ’
he said in his almost perfect Eng-
lish, ‘May I come in?’

  “ ‘Certainly,’ I growled, resuming
my seat and my pipe churlishly, but I
motioned him to a chair.

  “He entered, and shut the door be-
hind him. With a grace that seemed
a little out of place for some reason—
it suggested a panther to me—he
crossed the room and took the chair
I had indicated.

  “ ‘I have come to ask you a very
great favor, ’ he began immediately.

  “I frowned and was silent.

  “ ‘I am most anxious,’ he con-
tinued, ‘to return to my home. Eng-
land is no place for me. It is too
cold, too cold in every way. My
father is old, very old. He can not
live long now, we fear. I should be
with him; I should also be at hand
in case the time comes for me to suc-
ceed to the throne. There are other
sons, older than I (although I am the
only child of the ranee, and there is
but one ranee), and if I am not on
the spot, my father’s throne may be
polluted by the son of a nautch girl.
Who knows? And in that case what
would he do to my mother, who

would never acknowledge him? I do
not like to think, sir.’

  “ ‘Well, Chundun, I never realized
you were a prince before,’ I replied,
‘but the government will take care of
your rights, I have no doubt.’

  “ ‘Perhaps,’ he said, ‘and per-
haps not. As long as there was no
general massacre, your government
might keep its hands off. Ours is but
a small principality among the hills.
And with the best of intentions,
troops do not reach a place instantly
they are sent. Much can be done to
a woman in a few hours. My mother
is but a small woman. ’

  “This last sentence which he in-
troduced so irrelevantly somehow
brought up such a picture of horror
that I am still at a loss to account
for it except by means of thought
transference. I had never inquired
into the details of Indian methods of
torture.

  “I shuddered, and Chundun went
on, almost without a pause; ‘And I
can not return to India without my
degree. My father expects it.’

  “ ‘Naturally,’ I remarked dryly.
“I fancied the dark face flushed,
but Chundun went on quite calmly,
‘ I can pass in everything but English
literature. It—I ask your pardon—
fails to hold my attention, my inter-
est. No doubt the manner of think-
ing in the two races is too different.
This Addison, for example—what is
he to me ? I can read him, but after-
ward I can not answer questions
about what I have read. What is it
to me? Pardon me, it is only non-
sense. ’

  “ ‘Then why not elect something
else?’

  “ ‘Ah, but it is too late. I have
elected. At the end of this term I
should be finished all. I should re-
ceive my degree and return to my
dear father. And so I am asking
your help.’

  “ ‘If you want a tutor I’ll take
you on’ (I had become interested at
72

last), ‘but it’s awfully late to start
in with a tutor now! ’

  “ ‘Too late,’ replied Chundun.
‘The examination is but a week off, I
must use different means. Someone
must take the examination for me.’ ”

 Cumberland paused for a few
puffs, and then smiled at me rue-
fully: “Now I know just what I
should have done then, as well as you
do. I ought to have stood up and
showed Chundun the door. But I
didn’t. I was short of funds as
usual. I needed to return home, not
to succeed to my father’s throne, but
to help him with the family excheq-
uer. Where even the expenses of my
graduation were coming from I was
not certain. So, to my shame it is
spoken, I looked at the Indian with a
sickly smile and answered, ‘Do you
think we look enough alike that with
some sort of face stain-?’

  “ ‘I mean nothing so crude as
that, Mr. Cumberland,’ he rejoined.
‘I mean to suggest that we exchange
bodies for the day of the examination
in literature.’

  “ ‘We what?’ I jumped from my
seat.

  “ ‘Do not be so astonished, sir,’
went on Chundun smoothly. ‘I am
not surprized at your feelings, and
am deeply grateful that you have not
doubted my sanity, as many of your
countrymen would have done. It is
true, nevertheless, that I am able to
do this thing; in fact I have repeated-
ly done it. I exchanged forms several
times with a servant in India, and I
do not doubt that with some degree
of concentration it can be done equal-
ly well in England. If it does not
turn out as we expect, we shall be
none the worse off—you in particu-
lar.’

  “I flushed silently.

  “Chundun went on in his clear
smooth tones: ‘I am not, you see, as
densely ignorant of all matters as of
English literature. I have studied

for some years with the priests and
Brahmins of my country. ’

  He relapsed into silence.

  “My curiosity thoroughly aroused
by this time, I wished intensely to
see what this intended process could
be like. I had not the least faith in
it, but wanted to see it through, as I
should in those days have stayed out
a show in a cheap museum. Also I
wanted to laugh a little at Chundun
when he failed. We agreed to his
plans, which included a large fee to
me, part of which he insisted upon
paying immediately. His knowledge
of my finances seemed to me then
almost uncanny. Now I think it is
the most ordinary reasoning.”
Cumberland laughed. He contin-
ued:

  “The date for the experiment was
set the day previous to the examina-
tion in which Chundun expected in
his own character to fail. I had fin-
ished all my own, so was free. He
came to my rooms at 8 o’clock that
evening, and we talked awhile first,
he telling me something of his habits,
that the next morning Chundun
might not appear to be acting too
oddly.

  “ ‘And what do you call this
process, Chundun?’ I asked.

  “ ‘It is called in India’ (then fol-
lowed a long Indian word instantly
forgotten) ‘and sometimes’ (another
unpronounceable name). ‘In Eng-
lish it is termed a metempsychosis,
but this strikes me as singularly in-
accurate, as to change souls would
be manifestly impossible. The body
envelope, so readily laid aside uni-
versally at the hour of death, can
also be laid aside temporarily during
life. My soul, however, is indissolubly
connected with my consciousness!’
“I agreed with him.

  “At a quarter before 9, I remem-
ber looking at my clock as I lay on
my bed. The process of body ex-
change, according to Chundun, was
now about to commence.
TANGLED SKEINS

  “I had expected a fire in a brazier,
incense, smoke, incantations, and I
know not what of mystic ceremonies;
in this I was disappointed. I can not
remember any fear, only a faint sense
of amusement and a great curiosity.
Had I been a good Christian in those
days I should undoubtedly have had
nothing to do with the whole matter.
Had I been even a poor Romanist, I
should have protected myself in some
way by prayer. Alas! those were my
agnostic days!

  “Chundun began proceedings by a
brief injunction to me to concentrate
on the matter in hand, and then was
silent himself.. He was reclining on
my lounge. The body being wholly
at rest, he said, assisted the powers
of the mind and soul. We continued
in silence a few minutes, and I began
to get drowsy. Then I heard Chun-
dun’s voice a few moments in some
sort of singsong chant in what I knew
to be Hindustani, but could not
catch a word of. The voice now
ceased and I began again to grow
sleepy.

  “Presently, although the drowsi-
ness continued, it was strangely per-
meated by a sense, first of strain, then
of giddiness similar to the feeling
when succumbing to an anesthetic. It
was accompanied now, however, by no
drumming in the ears. As total un-
consciousness supervened, I was con-
scious of a sense of being lifted in
some way. Then I returned to my
senses very suddenly, with a feeling
of having been ‘out’ only about a
minute.

“'\7'ou may believe me or not, Gris-

  r wold, I awoke on the couch. I
looked over to the bed in surprize for
Chundun, but on it lay a white man
of a familiar appearance. I sat up
suddenly, and saw that my hands
were brown. I ran over to examine
the man on the bed. He was living
in my own body.”

  “So the thing really happened!”
I interjected.

  “Yes,” went on Cumberland, “the
impossible actually occurred, as one
hears of its doing every once in a
while. My powers of mind and mem-
ory were just what they had always
been (when I recovered from the
shock of surprize and terror which
accompanied my awaking from the
trance), and although my friend
would not allow me to go in my be-
wildered state to his rooms to spend
the night, but insisted on my occupy-
ing my own bed for the nonce while
he used the couch, in the morning I
was quite myself—in a brown body. ”
“And you took the examination
successfully for the Indian prince?”
“To my shame, yes.”

  “And then changed back, I sup-
pose ? Most astounding! ’ ’

  “The next night I spent in my own
rooms also, as Chundun and I agreed
it would be best to stay where one of
us knew exactly where everything
was. I could see, though, that my
striker was more than astonished to
find an Indian spending two nights
with me. He was plainly disgusted.

  “At 5 o’clock the following eve-
ning, thoroughly tired of each other’s
bodies, we agreed to resume our own,
and, locking the door as before, pre-
pared for the second change. We lay
down, we concentrated, Chundun
chanted, I became drowsy, and then
—nothing more. I awoke out of the
drowsiness (I had not lost my senses
completely as at first) to find myself
still brown, still a prisoner in a body
not my own!

  “How can I describe that endless
night? The repetition of the process,
the strained ‘concentrating’ which
one of us knew nothing about in
reality, the varied incantations in
Hindustani, all perfectly useless! We
faced the dawn in utter despair,
which even Chundun’s Eastern stoi-
cism could not conceal.

  “As we sat there in the gray mist
of morning, we could make no plans
save for the immediate present. The
74

WEIRD TALES

nest night we would both spend in
his rooms until I became accustomed
to where he kept his belongings, and
then the false life must continue, un-
til—what ?

  “ ‘Perhaps,’ Chundun suggested,
‘we are now unduly exhausted. All
may go well next time we make the
attempt to change. In the mean-
while let us rest, relax, refresh mind
and body.’

  “Rest? Relax? With this frightful
problem eating out our hearts?
Should I never again be myself, never
again see my family, embrace my
mother and sisters? Should I have
to go and be a prince in India?
Loathsome thought! How I should
undoubtedly hate the climate and the
surroundings! I had no fear but
that I would make an excellent ruler,
but this gave me little comfort.

  “Chundun being an Indian, I have
no way of guessing how much of
similar import went through his
mind. When I met him in the halls
and grounds of the college, his face
(my face!) appeared unmoved. But
I presume his face which I wore be-
trayed my grief conspicuously and
disgraced its real owner.

  “Our deceitful examination in
literature had been the last one
scheduled for either of us. The day
of commencement drew on, arrived.
I received Chundun’s diploma, and
he mine. I carried his continually in
a pocket.

  “That night I went to my old
rooms to see him. We tried once
more to regain our own bodies; it was
in vain. Under a calm exterior, he
looked haggard and worn. He in-
sisted on accompanying me back to
his rooms, where he divided equally
between us, come what would, the
thousand or so pounds which he kept
there. He declared that if we finally
failed to regain our own physical en-
velopes, I must go to India and take
up his duties, and he would let his
father know, lest I be found out and

suffer. I was silent. Never could I
counsel him to take my place. Could
I see my sisters in the arms of one
whose body was a brother to them,
but whose soul was that of an In-
dian? No, he must stay away from
Deven, I thought.

  “Most of the time we were now
alone. I suppose Chundun did not
act like me, and so was shunned as a
changed man by my old cronies. I
was too disheartened to care for any
company, and no one spoke to me but
the instructors and a couple of other
Indian students, who, I suspect, knew
all, having been confided in by Chun-
dun. It was manifestly impossible
for me to do the same with my
friends. My troubles would merely
have been aggravated by the risk of
being committed to a madhouse.

“It was now the day following the
graduating exercises. The pre-
vious day most of the students had
departed. I was glad that none of
my people had been up to the com-
mencement; I could not have borne
it. Today was the latest day I could
with any face start for home. I did
not know if Chundun intended to do
this for me or not. I could not bear
to think of him with my family. It
was worse than the thought of going
to India (I had not even asked the
exact location of the kingdom in
which he expected me to take his
place) and never seeing my dear ones
again myself.

  “I wandered about Oxford in a
despairing state, unable to make up
my mind as to my next move. The
only trouble that I did not have (I
felt) was lack of funds, and finally
I decided to take train for Liverpool,
and ship for America. There at least
I could lose myself among strangers,
and grief might finally dull itself
out. No doubt I should be able to
get some kind of work in time. And
as virtually 110 one in America was
acquainted with any of the tongues
TANGLED SKEINS

75

of India, I should not present the
anomaly of an East Indian unable
to talk a word of Hindustani.

  “I repaired to thfe railroad station,
and bought my ticket for Liverpool.
I took first class that I might be
alone. The train did not start for an
hour. I wandered about waiting. I
had no luggage. I did not know
which set of luggage belonged to me,
and was too discouraged to try to
find out.

  “As I traversed for the last time
the well-known streets of the old
town, I was drawn by the strains of
one of Chopin’s nocturnes and found
myself entering a small old church,
very dark and peaceful, where the
organist was giving a most beautiful
recital to himself and the doves in the
ivy-covered belfry above. I sank into
a pew, and seemed to stop thinking.

  ‘ ‘ I often wonder now how long that
blessed musician played, and I sat
motionless, scarcely knowing who or
what I was, stunned still by my grief,
yet comforted by the familiar and
beautiful strains of some of the best
music ever written by mortals. Final-
ly I think I fell asleep.

  “Suddenly I came to myself with
a start. The music had ceased; I was
wide-awake, with my mind unusually
clear, clearer far than it had been
since the day I had left my own
body. But what astonished me most
was that I had also a complete
change of mind. Not in regard to my
grief at my dreadful predicament,
but in regard to my worse than in-
difference to the religion of my
parents. Suddenly I saw myself as
I was, and the enormity of my offense
against God and Man in agreeing to
a cheat, in taking part in a mystic
ceremony of whose import I must
necessarily be ignorant, in carrying
out the deception. Come what
would, I thought, I would do what I
could to rectify matters. What should
I do? The first thing that occurred
to me was to find Chundun and re-

turn the money. Then a second and
stronger impulse forced me to un-
accustomed knees, and to a prayer of
penitence which was probably the
first genuine one I had ever offered.
The sweep of utterly new religious
feeling (I had always hated church
from a child, probably because I was
taken to too many services each Sun-
day) seemed to me far the most won-
derful thing in my whole experience.
And after praying for forgiveness, I
was moved to ask also for a deliver-
ance from my dreadful predicament.
Then, exhausted, I flung myself back
into the pew.

   *	‘ I felt drowsy, dreamy; I lost con-
sciousness.

  “Then I awoke with a start. I
leaped to my feet. The church would
be locked up for the night, perhaps.
I must find Chundun, I must make
restitution. I started for the door.

  ‘ ‘ Then I staggered back in sur-
prize. Where was I? Not in the lit-
tle old church near the railway sta-
tion but in my own room at Magda-
len. I fell back into a chair, as-
tounded. I glanced down at my
hands.

  “They were white!

  “I was myself again, thanks be to
God! But where was Chundun?

  “It took a few moments of reflec-
tion to see that he must have been sit-
ting, probably dozing and receptive,
in a chair in my sitting room; and I
upon my return to my own body had
found myself there. So he must have
awakened in the church. Thither I
hastened.

   ‘ ‘ It was still unlocked, but the sex-
ton was about to close it. I asked if
I might first see if a friend of mine
were there, perhaps asleep. ‘He has
just had a great shock,’ I.had the
forethought to explain. We went in
together, the sexton and I. The
church was empty.

  “I came out perplexed. I wan-
dered about and then sought the sta-
tion. Had an Indian gentleman
76

WEIRD TALES

taken the Liverpool train? He had.

  •	‘ Quick-witted Chundun! No doubt
he had found the ticket in my pocket
when he came to himself, and fearing
perhaps even to look once more on
myself or the scenes where his Indian
enchantments worked only in their
first part, he had fled incontinently
for home.

  “I never saw him again, nor heard
from him. He never even sent for
the contents of his rooms at the col-
lege, and I believe they were finally
sold at auction. I fancied he wished
me to have them, but he never left
any word to that effect, for which I
was very glad. The cheat was now
irrevocable, or at least it would have
served no purpose to have exposed it.
No doubt Chundun knew far more
than the average Oxford don. As
for the money, in the course of years
I have paid it to the church—to mis-
sions in 'India,” he added with a
smile.

  “And how do you account for it,
Cumberland?”

  “I don’t, altogether. Perhaps, as

I said, charms don’t work so well
away from their native heath. Per-
haps again, one person had to be
dominant at the»first change, the
other at the second. And I had
always left the responsibility to
Chundun. Perhaps again, the sweep-
ing changes of conversion in my own
soul necessitated in some way its also
returning to the body in which it had
been created. No, Griswold, I don’t
explain it. I am only very thankful
I am not on an Indian throne at this
moment, a place I should be about as
fit to occupy as Fido here. That is
all there is to the story.”

  And he arose and strolled to the
window. It was late. The rain had
ceased. Big Ben was chiming mid-
night.

  “After all,” I said as I rose to de-
part, “Cumberland, I don’t think it
is a paper for the society. I am in-
clined to think it is a sermon.”

  He smiled a little ruefully. ‘ ‘ Shoe-
maker, stick to your last!” said he.
“Anyhow it’s a story.”

  And in that I agreed with him.

Some prowless beach where a forgotten fisher dwells,

At length will leave the sea-flung jars of Solomon ;

And he, the fisher, fumbling ’mid the weeds and shells,
Shall find them, and shall rive the rusted seals, and free
The djinns that shall tread down thy towering iron hells

And turn to homeless rack thy proud Reality;

And lift Atlantis on their shoulders from the sea

To flaunt her kraken-fouled necropoli unknown;

And lift again those vaster peaks, that saw the veil
Of fire from primal suns on plains calescent thrown. „ . . .

O	lords and gods that are! I tell a future tale.
“Some frenzy must have overcome me
next. I tore away the wires and
overturned the globe.”

DURING the two years that I
had acted as secretary to Dr.
Brodsky, assisting him in his
psychical experiments, I had been en-
abled to build up an active medical
practise of my own.. My duties were
light; often the doctor did not call
upon my services for two or three
weeks together. More and more rare-
ly had he done so of recent months,
and gradually the conviction, sure,
although intuitive, was borne in upon
me that the days of our association
were numbered.

 Although comparatively young in
years, Brodsky lived through the
existences of three ordinary men.

  NOTE—This is the eleventh and last of a
series of stories, each complete in itself, deal ins?
with Dr. Ivan Brodsky. “The Snrtreon of Souls.”
The series began in WEIRD TALES for Septem-
ber. 1926.

His early revolutionary career in
Poland, his struggles in America, at
first for the mere necessities of life,
afterward for success; finally, the
dedication of his career to the solu-
tion of psychical problems had sa-
tiated him with worldly experiences.
He was unmarried; his only ties lay,
as he had told me, upon the veiled
shore of eternity. I felt that life held
nothing further for him.

  “Death,” he said to me once, “is
no result of physical processes. So
wonderful a machine is the human
body that there exists no reason at
all why it should not go on forever.
What kills is the satiation with earth-
ly experiences that comes to us; it is
the longing of the soul for its resting
place, where it stores up and absorbs
78

WEIRD TALES

all the results of its earthly achieve-
ments until it is ready to renew them
in some fresh incarnation. ”

  “And you—are you satisfied?” I
ventured to ask.

  “Not with the world,” he an-
swered. “But with my own person-
ality—yes, I am tired of Ivan Brod-
sky. These incarnations are the
merest halting places in the soul’s
long pilgrimage. I would like to take
up my work afresh, but in a different
body, so that I might forget Brodsky,
with his hopes and longings and dis-
appointments, and face the world
with the fresh anticipations and new
faith of a child.”

  “But that is annihilation!” I
cried. “All the dreams of immortal-
ity that are the hope of the world, the
desire for continued personal exist-
ence after death—are these all use-
less?”

  “By no means,” the doctor an-
swered. “The personality persists
after the change called death. It re-
mains so long as it is needed. Rein-
carnation is not fulfilled until the
soul has grown tired of its remem-
brances and voluntarily descends,
after some thousand years of dreams,
to gain new experiences. And then,
though it puts off the old personality
forever, the results of its acts remain
to modify its new life; shadowy re-
membrances flit through the brain;
old friends are encountered; besides,
in the end, everything is remembered.

  “For those who wish continued
personality there is a heaven of rest
where every dream and hope come
true. But as for myself, I confess,
if only I could start life again and
take up my work in a new body I
should be infinitely content. Nor
will this be long, I believe.”

  I knew that he alluded to his heart,
which was somewhat affected; yet
the danger was not imminent nor
likely to become so for many years
to come.

- “At any rate, I shall be ready to

answer the call, when it comes,” said
the doctor. He walked over to his
desk and unlocked a drawer. “Here
is a sealed letter that I have left
you,” he said. “After my death you
will open it.”

  I wondered even then why he did
not lock the drawer.

  I remembered this conversation the
more vividly in the light of subse-
quent events. It must have been a
little more than a week later when he
sent for me.

  “I am resolved to undertake an ex-
periment,” he said, “more difficult
than any that I have ever attempted.
It has been done before; yet it is
arduous and uncertain. You have
heard of the Indian fakirs who
actually pass over the borderland of
death, allowing themselves to be
buried in a grave, on which the grass
sprouts, only to be revived after a
period of months?”

  “You will not attempt such an ex-
periment as that ? ” I cried.

  “No,” answered the doctor. “It
would be senseless to attempt so fool-
ish an experiment without grave rea-
son. Nevertheless, I am planning one
somewhat analogous; I intend to pass
through the gates of death for the
sake of giving back to one who has
been deprived of it his inheritance
of the soul.”

  “You mean the imbecile!” I cried,
suddenly understanding.

  “Yes,” answered the doctor. “I
hope that this will succeed; but if my
own death be the result, at least the
last act of my life will have been to
some good purpose.” And I could
not dissuade him from his intention.

Among the dozen or more inmates
of Dr. Brodsky’s home, whom
he maintained out of his own pocket,
was an imbecile orphan, some seven
years of age. This child had never
exhibited the slightest sign of intelli-
gence; he lived a purely vegetative
existence, had never learned to erawl,
THE ULTIMATE PROBLEM

79

to utter a word. He did not even
possess the common animal faculty of
recognizing one person from another.
As there existed no apparent cause
for this defect, no deformity of the
head or body, and the vital functions
seemed in perfect condition, many
theories had been advanced as to the
cause of so singular an anomaly. Dr.
Brodsky, after studying the child for
many months, had finally formulated
his own conclusions.

  “It is one of those rare cases,” he
said, “in which the soul was not born
into the body. It remains shut out,
as you can imagine yourself shut out
of your house. Doubtless it is hover-
ing in close proximity to the mortal
form, connected, as it must be, by the
ethereal ligatures that bind it to the
spinal cord. In this condition, it is
virtually deprived of its existence
upon either of the planes; it is earth-
bound and spirit-bound. And there
is only one remedy; some other dis-
embodied soul must assist it. It is
my plan to pass out of the body
temporarily and to compel it to in-
carcerate itself.”

  “And if you can not return?” I
cried.

   “I shall ask your assistance in this
matter,” the doctor answered. “I
shall give you careful instructions,
which you will fulfil to the letter. If,
after the lapse of a certain time, you
find that these attempts are fruitless,
you will break open the letter which
I have left for you in the bureau
drawer, and read it,”

  I can hardly tell how this project
affected me. In vain I pointed out to
the doctor the inexpediency, from a
purely utilitarian point of view, of
risking his own life for the sake of
giving intelligence to the imbecile.
But my words were unheeded. I felt
that in truth this was to be our last
experiment, that it amounted almost
to premeditated suicide. I refused
to participate in it.

  Well, in the end, of course, I con-
sented, though I felt that this would
be the last occasion upon which I
should look into the doctor’s face
while he was alive. Looking back
now, I think my mind must have been
warped; I accuse myself a hundred
times of having been the cause of
Brodsky’s death. Yet the first lesson
that he had implanted in my mind,
ever since I first heard him lecture to
us students at the hospital, was the
duty of obedience. He had com-
manded and it was for me to obey.
Especially, however, I base my vindi-
cation upon that hypnotic power
through the medium of which Brod-
sky possessed the ability to compel
me, or anyone else, to obey him..

  Some days elapsed before the ex-
periment was made. Brodsky occu-
pied himself during this interval, as
I surmised, in setting his affairs in
order. At last, upon the afternoon
appointed, I repaired with him to his
laboratory, a long chamber in the
rear of the house, completely shut off
from all communication with the out-
side. Ordinarily there was no sound
within, but now a great electrical
engine buzzed and throbbed beside a
low, flat table, raised only some six
inches above the floor, and surmount-
ed by a large bowl of translucent
blue, into which the wires entered.
Upon the table the imbecile child sat,
propped up against a flexible pillow
of rubber, or some similar non-
conducting material, searching the
room with his large lack-luster eyes.
The doctor stooped over his machine
and made his adjustments; then he
connected a rubber sponge, at the
termination of a network of wires,
with the child’s spine, and boiind it
there with strips of cloth in such a
manner that it could not be removed.
He drew another wire, terminating
in a similar sponge, from the recesses
of the machine, and affixed it to him-
self in the same way; finally, he
united both to the metal base of the
80

WEIRD

TALES

globe with a clamp. Immediately the
globe became dark and opaque.

  ‘‘That is the measure of our vital
forces,” he said. “And now I will
give you your instructions.

  “It was my intention to ask you
to press the lever which will send the
high voltage through our bodies. But
in case of any untoward results you
would reproach yourself with being
my slayer. I shall, therefore, myself
press the lever, and lay upon you
only the responsibility of recalling
me to life again.

  “When I press this lever it will
send a current of electricity of
several thousand volts directly
through our bodies. The effect will
be the same as that which is produced
by an electrocution. Now it has al-
ways been my claim—although the
authorities of our prisons would
never permit me to demonstrate it—
that the man who has suffered elec-
trocution can invariably be revived
by the proper methods, since the cur-
rent merely paralyzes the nerve cen-
ters and suspends the vital functions,
without destroying any of the tissues.
The criminal who goes to the electric
chair dies, not from the effects of the
current, but under the surgeon’s
knife. I have especially contrived
this instrument for the purpose of
proving my contention, although I
little imagined at the time I set it
forth that I was likely to be the first
subject. The soul, which is purely
electrical, is attached to the body by
extremely tenuous, but none the less
substantial ligaments, and, when
driven out by some violent shock, re-
mains for some days floating above
it, until the ligaments give way and
set it free. By means of this mechan-
ism I claim that the expelled soul can
tie conducted along the wire and
stored within the globe, which is a
perfect vacuum, and where its pres-
ence will be indicated by the appear-
ance of a wisp of light,

  “To sum up, .1 shall electrocute

myself and the imbecile child. You
will wait until you see the two
threads of flame appear within the
center of the globe. Then you will
fling back the lever, and again push
it forward to the notch marked E.
That will be all your task. The re-
versal of the current will again force
each separate soul along the wire—
mine, into my own body; and the
imbecile’s, I hope, into his.”

  “But if you do not awake?” I
cried.

  “You will then wait until some un-
usual symptom intervenes, either in
the child or in myself. And now I
confess that I am sufficiently human
to feel a certain sense of apprehen-
sion. So give me your hand; remem-
ber, if this should be our last ex-
periment, we have yet many more
parts to play, and lives to play them
in; be ready to play your own part
sturdily in this.”

T Te gripped my hand in farewell.
L My own answered the pressure;
then I averted my head and waited.
Meanwhile Brodsky, kneeling on the
low table, in the position of a Japan-
ese in some old print, about to commit
the fatal thrust that should cause
instantaneous death, braced himself
against the rubber pillow and
stretched out his hand. I heard the
soft thud of the doctor’s body as he
collapsed sidewise; and suddenly the
opaque globe became a dazzling blue,
and blue fire spluttered along the
wires. It was almost too bright for
my eyes to look into it. Gradually it
subsided, the globe became a pearly
gray, and therewithin, dimly visible
through the glass, were two bright
flames. Butterfly-shaped, they seemed
to pursue each other as goldfish in
a bowl, cii’cling and doubling upon
their courses; now approaching each
other, now dancing apart, now fused
into one, elongating, and again re-
treating to opposite sides of the
globe; yet never for one instant did
THE ULTIMATE PROBLEM

81

they cease to hover, with poised and
pendulous wings. I stole a glance at
the body of the doctor. He had fallen
upon his side and lay motionless, ap-
parently lifeless, his limbs out-
stretched and stiffened as those of a
man in some cataleptic trance, while
at his side, in the same state, the im-
becile lay, with glassy eyes wide open.
Was it indeed possible, I asked my-
self, that those two souls, one imbe-
cile, the other a compendium of
knowledge and fineness, should in
reality be those foolish, circling, but-
terfly-shaped lights that hovered and
danced continually? I must have
watched them in fascination for fully
five minutes before I suddenly re-
called the doctor’s instructions.

  But my hands shook so that I could
with difficulty lay them upon the
lever. I caught it at last, reversed it,
and sent it forward again to the
notch E. Instantly the flames
divided; there came a hiss and splut-
ter, and the wire was once more
aflame with the blue light. Then a
convulsive trembling seized upon the
limbs of the imbecile. He gasped,
drew in a long breath, and sat up.
His eyes fixed themselves gravely on
mine. But it was no longer a glance
of blankness, as though there were no
mind behind the vision. He saw me;
when I moved, the eyes followed
mine, and a current of unintelligible
babbling came from between the
child’s lips. But Brodsky lay as
when he had fallen, nor was there
any relaxation in the stiffened limbs.

  A spasm of fear seemed to turn the
muscles of my heart to stone. I
stared into the bowl. There was but
one light there now, a tiny, fluttering
thing, that seemed each moment to
become more and more attenuated.
It danced more feebly, beating from
side to side in inefficiency, now dart-
ing back, now dancing forward once
again to where the wires entered the
vacuum. I bent over the body of the
doctor, chafing the hands in vain; I
touched the cheeks, now growing

cold. More and more slowly moved
that butterfly light. It hovered, a
pitiful, tiny thing, poised in the
midst of the globe, which was itself
changing in color and slowly fading
in brilliancy. Now it was a deep
blue, merging into indigo, and from
the edges black shadows seemed to
creep forward and envelop that little
spark at the heart of it. This became
but a pin-point of light; then it
glowed no more than the burnt-out
end of a match. One instant it
flickered up; then it went out abrupt-
ly, and the globe was utterly dark
and opaque. I placed my hand once
more on the doctor’s. It. was icily
cold, and as I bent over him, I saw
the stiffness go out of the muscles
and the limbs relax.

  Some frenzy must have overcome
me next. I must have torn away the
wires and overturned the globe, for,
when I came to my senses, nothing re-
mained of the apparatus except the
lifeless bulk of the electrical machine,
while all around me was a wreckage
of wires. I lifted the doctor’s body
in my arms and carried him into his
study. I laid him upon a lounge and
injected strychnin into the veins.
There was no response.. I placed my
ear against his heart; it did not stir.
Against his lips I laid a little mirror
of silvered glass. It was not clouded.
And suddenly I felt a thing pulling
at my coat. It was the imbecile
child; it had crawled after me. Then
I understood. This was the unusual
symptom of which Brodsky had
spoken. Then I knew that I had ex-
hausted all my resources. I rushed
to the telephone and summoned medi-
cal aid. Hours afterward, as it ap-
peared to me, though it was in reality
only a matter of minutes, a doctor ar-
rived. I tried to stammer out some
explanation, but he cut me short.

  "Heart disease,” he pronounced.
"I warned him only last week that he
must be prepared. There will be no
need of an autopsy.”
82

WEIRD TALES

  “But the soul!” I stammered.
“The soul in the glass globe!”

  The doctor looked at me gravely.

  “You must lie down and rest,” he
answered. “It must have been a
great shock to you. ” Sol knew that
my words would go for less than
nothing.

T was ill for weeks after that.

   Friends took charge of the fu-
neral, friends whom Brodsky had
aided, who appeared in countless
numbers from unexpected quarters.
The funeral partook almost of the
character of a public demonstration.
Even I had never known the extent
of Brodsky’s benefactions. Even the
physicians of the town, who had re-
garded him more or less with sus-
picion, participated in the cere-
monies. The newspapers were filled
with long accounts of the dead man’s
works; his psychical researches were
dismissed lightly, but not contemptu-
ously, as the vagaries of a great
thinker, the relaxations of a scientist.
When the will was read I found that
I had been left sole executor and
chief legatee. The remainder of the
doctor’s fortune was to go to endow
the home which he had established.

  Then, one day, while looking
through the doctor’s papers, I came
upon a sealed letter addressed to me.
I had forgotten all about it in the
strain that I had gone through.
Hastily I broke the seal and read:

  “You must pardon me, my dear
friend,” ran the letter, “if for the
second time I have wilfully deceived
you. The first occasion, as you will
remember well, was when you first
came to me, when I hypnotized you
in my study for the purpose of turn-
ing your mind from the gloomy
thoughts of suicide that possessed
you. On this occasion I felt impelled
to say less than the truth for fear
that you would attempt to dissuade
me from my purpose.

  “I told you that I intended to

make my most difficult experiment, to
go through the gates of death and to
search out and bring back with me
the soul of the imbecile child. For-
give me for having made 'this state-
ment. It was an impossibility. The
electric current that I sent through
my own body with my own hand de-
stroyed once and for all the vital
powers. Nothing on earth could have
restored them. I tell you this in order
that you may not think you were
remiss or negligent in your endeavors
to resuscitate me. The two flames that
you will doubtless have seen within
the globe were not the souls, but only
those N-rays which are given forth
from all living things, whether men,
beasts or trees. When the last flame
went out the organism was dead be-
yond possibility of recall.

  “The child revived because the
current was so graduated that it
merely stunned, without destroying,
that duller organism. Had it been
of a force proportioned to that which
passed through my own body, noth-
ing could have revived him. But now,
to explain more fully what it was my
intent to do, and what I hope and
think that I have done.

  “As I have told you, I knew that
no power on earth could bring the
soul into the child’s body. It was, in
fact, born soulless, nothing more than
a vital organism. It was my purpose,
then, in dying, to transfer my own
identity into that child’s body, so that
while the Ivan Brodsky whom you
knew disintegrated slowly, according
to the natural processes of the body,
his spirit might gain a new lease of
life and grow to manhood, forgetful
of the old ills and troubles, eager to
fulfil the work that I had laid down
for myself.

  “I leave him in your care. Doubt-
less within a few days he will begin
to manifest a human intelligence. As
he grows older he will have vague
memories of my own life. He will
repay your care with the truest affec-

tion, since I myself shall be his inspir-
ing spirit, and this, you know, I feel
for you. He will have, also, strange
reminiscences, will recall faces of per-
sons strange to him, but known to me.
These recollections you will discour-
age. Remember that he is a new
being, whose life is as yet an unwrit-
ten page, and that the past must
remain sealed to him through all his
life.

  “Train him, then, in the medical
profession, and guide his mind so
that when he reaches maturity he
will voluntarily take up those studies
of mine where I have dropped them.
I have embodied these in a typewrit-
ten document which you will find in
a secret drawer at the back of my
bureau.’’ [Here followed instruc-
tions for opening it.] “In these in-
structions you will learn much that I
have never told you of, things that in
the hands of evil men might plunge
the whole world into barbarism and
shake down the pillars of civiliza-
tion.” [Here followed some purely
personal instructions.] “But above
all, remember that I leave everything
to your absolute discretion, since all
things are appointed to their own
end, and if my hopes are vain, noth-
ing can bring them to fruition.”

When I had finished reading this
letter I sat thinking for a long
while. Then I went to the bureau

and, after some fumbling, found and
pressed the secret spring. A drawer
flew back.. In it I found a typewrit-
ten paper, half covered with dried
rose petals. I unfolded it and began
slowly to read. ... I read till the day
was gone. . .. Then I committed it to
the flames.

  For I felt, and still feel that, many
as were the evils which Brodsky
cured during the brief period of our
association, the world is better off
without this knowledge of his. The
risks were too many. And, after all,
as he had always said, this is a world
of light; there is a long eternity when
we shall be shut off from external
activities, when the things of the soul
only will be of account. Let us not
meddle with them here, but go about
our appointed tasks in the manner set
for us.

  The boy is growing to manhood.
Already he is planning to enter the
medical school; I find in him odd
traces of Brodsky, odd flashes of
memory and intuitive appreciation of
the things Brodsky cared for. But I
discourage all his interest in the
realm of psychic things. It may be
that his will will prove stronger than
mine, that he will succeed in taking
up the doctor’s work where Brodsky
abandoned it. In such event I shall
give way; until that happens I shall
fulfil my trust in the spirit of my
own interpretation.
A Story of the Australian Gold Diggings

THE EL DORADO
OF DEATH

      By PERCY B. PRIOR

THE brothers W akeford
worked together in a South
Australian chemical factory.
There was a strong bond of sympa-
thy between them, they were insep-
arable pals. Both of an adventurous
disposition, they chafed at the re-
strictions of city life, and constantly
planned to go prospecting. Like all
young men, and not a few elderly
ones, they dreamed of earning easy
money. Working merely in order
to make a bare living did not coin-
cide with their ideas of what life was
meant for. We have all of us, at
some time or other, experienced this
feeling.

  One evening, while they were
drinking together, they fell into con-
versation with a bearded man,
bronzed and weather-beaten, gaunt
and keen-eyed. They thought, at
first, that he was merely one of those
pests always to be found hanging
around hotels, but were not long in
discovering their error.

  Many of his reminiscences were
concerned with prospecting. He had
sought for gold along the banks of
creeks in lonely bush gullies, and
many were the stories he told the
two Wakefords of perils and hard-
ships, of occurrences—grim, some of
them, others ludicrous—that, by
turns, had gladdened and sad-
dened his adventiirous wanderings.
Warmed by their hospitality, the old
bushman told them, among other
places, of a valley in the Macdonnell
84

Range, and of a thin wisp of stream
that meandered through it, in the
dry bed of which, near a certain
gnarled and aged tree, gold-dust,
plenty of it, glittering in the sand,
could be scooped up in handfuls.

  In proof that his story was not an
hallucination he showed the brothers
a small quantity of the precious
metal in a tobacco tin, and also gave
them a plan of the gully roughly
scrawled on a scrap of paper, with
full directions for reaching it. They
were astonished that he made no en-
deavor to sell them his secret, in-
stead of divulging it gratuitously.
His explanation, however, seemed
reasonable enough. He had for
years, he said, been a martyr to
rheumatism, but, hopeful of shaking
it off sufficiently to go gold-liunting
again, he had never mentioned the
gully and its auriferous creek-bed
to a living soul. Alone in the world,
and no longer hopeful of recovery,
he saw no reason why its where-
abouts should continue to remain a
secret.

  Their meeting with the old pros-
pector inflamed imaginations and
roused dormant aspirations. Sudden-
ly deciding to throw off their shack-
les, they left their chemical factory,
and purchasing a tent, blankets, and
other equipment, set out in search of
their El Dorado.

  They could not have selected a
more inopportune time to begin their
quest. The heat that summer was
THE EL DORADO OF DEx\TH

85

phenomenal. Unused to hardships
that would have tried the stoicism of
hardened bushmen, the brothers
Wakeford trudged onward, with
their heavy packs, the sun blazing
fiercely down upon them. Their feet,
which had never previously been
called upon to carry them as far in
a week as now, tramping from dawn
to dark, in heavy blucher boots, they
were compelled to travel every day,
became blistered and raw. Insects
of many kinds, some of them poison-
ous, bit and stung the two men with
persistency.

  At last the younger brother, half-
crazed by the heat and parched with
thirst, became too ill to proceed
farther, and a camp was made in a
drear and lonely spot, beside a stag-
nant pool, in a forest of dead and
gaunt gum-trees that raised bleached
branches as though in supplication
to a relentless and white-hot sky.

  A more appropriate scene for a
tragedy, indeed, could scarcely be
imagined. A thunderstorm, at first
muffled and far away, crept even
closer, and finally crashed above the
tent of the two unfortunates, who,
weakened by privation and comatose
with fatigue and despair, huddled
inside it. The storm intensified the
desolation, the melancholy, and the
loneliness, filling them with a sense
of foreboding, as though of some im-
pending calamity.

  The younger Wakeford’s suffer-
ings, in particular, were intense,
much more so than those of his
brother, for, besides being weak and
light-headed for want of proper
nourishment and as a result of ex-
posure to the pitiless sun, he was a
nerve-racked and under-vitalized fel-
low, moody and imaginative.

Night, illuminated by flashes of
lightning and made hideous by
the cannonading of warring clouds,
closed round the desperate wayfarers.

  Despite the uproar, aches and

pains, and a strained and over-
wrought state of mind by reason of
which he was on the verge of hysteria,
the younger Wakeford, controlling
himself by an effort of will, deter-
mined to await, resolute and alert,
the issue of events which he somehow
felt, without knowing how or why,
were impending.

  The elder brother, overcome by
weariness, fell into a deep and dream-
less slumber.

  Wakeford, the younger, was aroused
toward midnight from a revery by
feeling that someone or something
had entered the tent. Raising his
eyes, he beheld bending over him a
tall figure in white, which signed to
him to follow. He rose immediately,
and, the white-robed figure leading
the way, they began to traverse a
succession of damp and dark corri-
dors, seemingly endless, until they
reached, at last, an enormous cav-
ern, filled with a moonlike radiance,
where dancing was in progress.

  Strains of weird music were pierced
by a continuous strange and staccato
clicking sound, like the turbulence of
castanets.

 Bewildered and dazed by the
sudden transition from darkness and
desolation to the glittering and
crowded hall of festivities, it was
some moments before Wakeford the
younger was able to comprehend in
its entirety what was going on.
When he did so, he was chilled to the
bone with horror, for the white-robed
figures, gliding hither and thither
across the crystal floor, were skele-
tons, and the curious and continu-
ous staccato sound which resembled
castanets was the clicking of their
fleshless jaws.

  The music ceased, and the couples
separated, seating themselves upon
benches of iridescent stalagmites
ranged round the walls. Then, after
a brief interval of awful and un-
broken silence, the invisible musi-
86

WEIRD TALES

cians commenced again, and the
skeletons, to a different rhythm this
time, began once more to glide about
the cavern floor.

  Young Wakeiord was petrified
with terror. The white-robed figure
he had followed into the cavern
seemed taller than any of the others,
and to be in a position of command.
It now ordered him, by signs, to se-
lect a partner for the next dance
from the hideous throng surrounding
him.

  Horrified, he shrank from it, tried
to run, but, held by some strange
power, was unable to move from
where he stood.

  Irritated, the tall figure, turning
upon him threateningly, raised its
arm to strike. Quick as thought

young Wakeford, whose legs alone
seemed stricken with paralysis,
pulled a revolver from his holster,
and, levelling it at the tall and
ghostly specter, pulled the trigger.

  With the shock of the report, the
dreadful dream was shattered. The
cavern with its ghostly radiance, its
fearsome and ghastly dancers, and
the threatening specter, all had van-
ished. Wakeford, the younger, was
back in the tent again, staring, dum-
founded, at his elder brother, who
lay bleeding from a bullet wound in
the chest, and gasping out his life.

  Scarcely had the elder Wakeford
breathed his last before another shot
rang out. The two brothers ended
the journey as they had begun it—
together.

AS ALWAYS

            By A. LESLIE

  "Behold, the face that launched a thousand ships!”
  Thus sang the ancient bard, of Trojan Helen.

  And the young men gathered,

  Each to hear, and each to dream his chosen dream
  Of Helen, and to give

  Her face and form to his own fancy and desire.

  For Helen lived in many lands—

  And Helen’s hair was softly brown,

  And black as dream-clouds, and as gold
  As summer sunlight of the dawn;

  And Helen smiled where’er the night
  Strode grandly down the stairway of the stars.

  And this was thrice two thousand years agone!

  But still the young men gather close to hear
  Of Trojan Helen, and to dream their dreams.

  For Helen lives, and Troy burns,

  And Odysseus sails westward to the setting sun.
IT WAS accidental, my meeting
the Chapmans at Tampa. I had
been doing Florida, as most
everybody does at least once, had
gone down the east coast, and on to
Havana in a Key West packet. I
was now on my way north up the
west side of the peninsula. I found
that the real estate sellers of the east
side of that incomparable sand-drift
haven’t anything on those of the west
side, if anybody should ask you.

  But the trip had all been different
enough from selling farm machinery
in Saskatchewan, which was my own
specialty, and as I went down the
hotel steps on the way to the railroad
station I carried, besides my travel-
ing bag, an equally heavy regret that
my week in Tampa was up.

  A hotel taxi was at the curb, and
as I crossed the walk toward it,
whom should I almost bump into but
Estey Chapman and—as I had every
reason to suppose—Estelle Morse?
They had just come out of a shop,
Chapman’s arms laden with pur-
chases, and were on the point of
climbing into their car, parked in
front of the store.

  I must have stood in open-mouthed
nonplus through a heartbeat or so
when 1 recognized them. Then my
amazement was swallowed up in our
mutual greetings. Chapman put me
right, in a bashful way, when I ad-
dressed Estelle as Mrs. Morse.

 "Mrs. Chapman—now,” he stam-
mered, across his armful of parcels.

  They both laughed, easily, at my

momentary funk. One risks a con-
tretemps or two, losing one’s self for
years, as I had done in the North-
west. I had left Estelle happily mar-
ried to Professor Morse—an event
following close on our university as-
sociation—and Chapman burning the
midnight electricity trying to break
into print.

  “You’ll have to come up to the
house and hear the whole story,”
Chapman said, turning to the car to
rid his arms of the parcels.

  Estelle nodded sweetly in confir-
mation. Everything Estelle did was
done sweetly.

  ‘ ‘ But I was on my way to the sta-
tion, man!” I half objected.

  Chapman wouldn’t listen to me.
He waved me into the tonneau seat
with Estelle, while he sat with the
driver, his big back squarely in front
of me. Chapman was massive. He
had played center on the football
team in his last two years at college.

  Estelle had kept something of her
old-time vivacity; but it seemed sub-
dued, as though it might have run
the gantlet of no telling what repres-
sive memories. She had, to my taste,
more than ever of brunette loveli-
ness, yet she didn’t look just fit,
somehow, and I noticed that Chap-
man helped her into the car as
though she were an invalid. I
couldn’t chaff her, as I once would
have done. There was some subtle
quality in her manner that stopped
me. We talked of the old days, but
we did so a little pensively.

  The car traversed the city’s streets
and its citrus-screened outskirts,
coming to a halt at last beside a
sandy plot bordered in the distance
with scrub pines. In the midst of
the plot stood the Chapman resi-
dence, bare and bleak, sans veranda,
sans stoop, and even sans shade trees.
It was just a great plain unrelieved
cube, with no projections of any
kind about it save the cornices.

  I found everything lovely inside
though: large, brightly lighted rooms
—the lighting was really extraordi-
nary—and the rich furnishings were
of the best, and in taste.

  “You’ll have a nice place of this,
when you’ve had time to grow some
trees,” I said to Chapman that eve-
ning, as we sat outside at sunset,
smoking.

  “We have all the trees we are
likely to have, soon.”

  There was abstraction in the man-
ner of his reply, which, I thought,
presaged the story I knew he had
to tell me. I had sensed his attempts
to get a start on it, all afternoon, and
had wondered what there could be
about it that was so deucedly hard to
tell. But if he was at the door of the
thing now he was diverted again, for
at the approach of the sudden dusk
of Florida latitudes, he started up
suddenly with a scared look and an
exclamation that we must go to join
Estelle.

  We found her in the music room,
just seating herself at the piano.
Something told me that if we had
not come when we did the instru-
ment beneath her hands would have
summoned us. A sense of queerness
struck me the instant we entered the
room. It was the lights, I think. All
the electric bulbs in the room, and
there were ten times too many, were
beaming garishly. I suspected Chap-
man or his wife of an odd passion for
light, light, and yet more light, as
though gloom or shadow were a
deadly gas that must be kept off.

  One of the maids was with Estelle
when we entered. I noticed that.
But she withdrew when we came in,
as though she had been there merely
to keep her mistress from being
alone.

  Estelle played for us until dinner
was announced. After dinner, the
three of us recalled old friends, trac-
ing this or that one to his or her sue-
THE MYSTERY OF SYLMARE

89

cess or failure. We went over a lit-
tle of Chapman’s work. A good deal
of it I had never seen, though it was
now being published. I had been out
of touch with most prints for years.

Estelle left us at 10:30, avowedly
to let us smoke without making
her cough, but really, I knew quite
well, to clear the way for Chapman’s
disclosures, that seemed so hard for
him to disclose. The thing he told
me could not have been told with her
present. That’s certain. We went
to Chapman’s den. It was already
bedtime, and Chapman made no
more false starts.

  “Had Morse shown any signs of—
of overstudy, before you went
West?” he asked doubtfully, when
we were settled in easy eliairs.

 “No.” My answer was prompt;
but. on his remaining silent, I recon-
sidered: “That is, he always
seemed intent on his work, when at
work, but he was able apparently to
forgot it when away from it.”

 “So he was. once,” Chapman
agreed. “But later on, his intensity
at his work grew on him, while he
lost entirely his way of letting go of
it when he knocked off. Finally, he
developed a tendency to drag his in-
fernal science into everything that
came up in everyday life. That got
to be devilish unpleasant for Estelle,
and, as I seemed the only one who
could fetch him out of it even tem-
porarily, they had me about as much
as possible. It was Estelle’s doings.
But Morse wanted me. too. T think
he felt that he was going a gait,
mentally.

 “His hobby eventually ran to
botany—that is, to that phase of bot-
any that considers its relation to
biology in general. Ho delved into
vegetable sentiency, and vegetable
consciousness—can you imagine it?
—and even into vegetable mobility!
He finally came to more than half

believe that plants have not only
feeling but a kind of mentality, or at
least consciousness, and at the last
he became next to noisy on the sub-
ject of chlorophyl and its powers.”

 Chapman stopped and stared at
the floor. I shook my head, at what
he had told me about Morse, and
wondered, meanwhile, how much of
the story I was to be cheated out of
by his intimate relation to it.

  “When Morse’s mother died,” he
resumed, “she left him the old home
place in Sylmare, on the northeast
coast. He and Estelle used to spend
their vacations there. It’s a sleepy
old town, but something of a sum-
mer resort for a few New York and
Boston people who like to dodge the
expense or the clatter of the more
popular places. There’s a writers’
and artists’ summer colony some
eight miles up the coast from Syl-
mare, and I spent my summers there,
what time I wrasn’t with the Morses.
I was there—at the writers’ roost—
when the thing happened.

  “It happened in June. The Morses
had visited Estelle’s people in At-
lanta at the end of the school year,
Morse going North a week in advance
of his wife, to get together a corps of
servants and put the old house in
order. Estelle never liked mussing
around a house. Morse telephoned
me, on his arrival, and I went down
the next day in my motor-boat. I
knew that Estelle would want me to
be with him as much as I could,
while she was not.

  “I found the house topsyturvy in
the hands of the cleaners. To get
away from the dust and litter, Morse
and I went out for a spin in his car.

  “The road ran along the foot of a
caveliko forest that covered the hill.
It used to be a fancy of Morse’s that
a dweller on some other planet,
wholly unacquainted with our forms
of life, would, on coming to Sylmare,
be sure to think the trees the real life
of the place, and that the people go-

ing about beneath them were some
sort of rather unimportant parasitic
form. At any rate, the gloomy old
town on the sea slope was dark and
dim with the shade of maples,
beeches and elms, and its steep
streets running down to the shell
road along the beach were very like
grottoes in some half-lit cavern with
sloping floor.

  "Imagine, now, a lot of men and
women running down those dim
aisles beneath the trees toward the
old wharf on the bayshore, and you
have a part of that which brought
our forty mile an hour clip in
Morse’s car to a sudden stop.

  " ‘Something’s gone wrong, here,
Ed!’ I exclaimed, turning to Morse
as the car slowed up.

  "I don’t think he heard me at all.
His face was turned to the wharf,
and his vibrant, ashen lips were ar-
ticulating, ‘It’s another! It’s an-
other ! ’

  "He unlatched the ear door and
jumped out, hurrying toward the
wharf. I was at his heels, the chauf-
feur at mine.

 "A fisherman’s rowboat was
drawn up at the wharf, and it had
in tow a small motor-boat. In the
last, as we drew nearer, we could
see the bodies of a youth and a girl.

  " ‘My God!’ Morse gasped, stop-
ping short and gazing stilly at the
two forms in the boat. ‘It’s Frank
Kirby and Alta Cline!’

  "I heard the chauffeur whisper
an oath as we went on toward the
wharf.

  "The youth and the girl looked
about nineteen or twenty. They
were dressed for outing. The boy
had on a Naval Reserve uniform,
queerly shot with little pricks and
rents of the fabric, and the girl’s
knickers bore the same strange
marks. Her bobbed brown hair lay
about her sweet set face like a lovely
soft frame about a picture. The
youth had a powder-smoked bullet-

hole in his right temple, and the girl
bore a wound quite like it. The queer-
est thing of all, however, was the
great number of scratches and slight
wounds on their faces, their hands,
and their wrists.

  " ‘The Ellis boys were like that!’
I heard a woman near me whisper to
another.

  " ‘Mrs. Van Scoyk, too!’ the other
answered, with a straight, wild look.
‘And Barry, also, I heard.’

 "The coroner came pushing
through the crowd about the wharf.
His examination disclosed nothing
we had not already seen, save a re-
volver with two empty chambers ly-
ing in the bottom of the boat. He
gave directions for the removal of
the bodies. As they carried the girl
out of the boat, one of her dead,
drooping hands still grasped and
carried a small bag of fir tips, such
as are used for stuffing aromatic pil-
lows. Eyes filled, at that sight.
Somehow, that was the most pa-
thetic thing about the whole solemn
scene.

  "I turned to Morse for an explan-
ation, but he shook his head, at my
questioning look, and led the way si-
lently to the group about the fisher-
man who had brought in the boats
and was now telling and retelling
his story.

  " ‘I was ’bout seven miles down
coast when I see their boat driftin’
out to sea, engine dead and nobody
rowin’. I could see ’em layin’ as you
saw ’em, here. They was so still that
I rowed up to ’em, toyin' to make
out what was wrong. But when I
got near enough to see them
scratches on their faces, I went weak
as a cat; for I saw the Ellis boys,
and Barry, too. It was all I could
do to nerve myself up to towin’ ’em
in.’ He shook his head and started
up the beach.

  " ‘You had no means of judging
how far they had drifted?’ Morse
THE MYSTERY OF SYLMARE

91

asked, as we walked beside the man
toward the road.

  “ ‘No; but I saw ’em leave the
wharf, this morning. They was gay
as two kids, then. Is it so, they was
to be married next fall?’

  “ ‘Yes, it’s true, I believe,’ Morse
replied gravely, following me to the
car.

  “ ‘What in the name of heaven do
you make of this, Ed?’ I asked, as
our machine moved away.

  “He shook his head, silently.

  ‘ ‘ * But what did they mean—about
the Ellis boys, and Barry?’

  “ ‘It’s a long story—too long to
tell here.’ His eyes were on the
driver, meaningly. I didn’t know,
then, as he did, that every servant in
the town was already on the verge
of pulling up stakes and leaving, be-
cause of this strange, deadly thing
that was killing people right and left
among them. True, these two latest
victims had evidently ^killed them-
selves ; but everyone seemed sure
that it was The Thing that had
brought it about.

  “ ‘Let’s go home,’ Morse suggest-
ed. ‘I don’t feel in the mood for a
drive, now.’

  “I nodded assent, and he gave the
order to the driver.

“TX7'hen we got back to the house
V V we found the library, at least,
out of the hands of the dusters, and
went into it. Morse was moody. It
seemed an effort for him to begin the
disclosures I felt he had brought me
there to make.

  “ ‘In the first place,’ he began, at
last, when he saw that I couldn’t or
wouldn’t talk of anything else, ‘the
two victims you saw at the wharf
just now are merely the latest of a
long series, though I’ll admit that
they have affected me more than has
any of the others, because of their
carefree youth and their promise of
life and love and happiness. But I
know of six such cases, directly; and,

indirectly, of a number of others.
They are all without a parallel—that
I can find—in human experience. ’

  “I shivered and shook my head,
moving my chair nearer to his in the
great, gloomy library.

  “ ‘The first of the more recent
cases,’ he went on, ‘was that of Mrs.
Van Scoyk. You didn’t know the
Van Scoyks?’

  “ ‘I never heard the name until
today. It was whispered, then.’

  “ ‘They summered here, or rather,
she did. Van Scoyk ran out from
the city usually Friday nights, go-
ing back Mondays. She went in for
boating; she was, in fact, an expert
with thef oars.

 “ ‘I was away when the Van
Scoyk affair happened. It was last
summer. Mrs. Van Scoyk had been
out on the bay in her rowboat. To-
ward evening, a passing boatman
saw her leap from the shore into the
water. This, mind you, was in sight
of her splendid summer home on the
North Bluff. She had everything to
live for. The Van Scoyks were
wealthy.

  “ ‘It came out at the inquest that
several of her acquaintances had
passed her as she rowed up the bay
on her way home, but she paid not
the slightest attention to any of their
greetings. She seemed dull and
dazed—dead alive, as one witness ex-
pressed it.

  “ ‘The boatman raced to her to
get her out of the water, calling an
alarm as he did so; but she could not
be revived. She was dead. On the
beach near by was her boat, and in
the deep sand near the waterside she
had molded with her hands a shal-
low grave, on which she^iad placed a
bouquet of wild flowers.

  “ ‘Now comes the strangest part
of this strange case: Mrs. Van
Scoyk’s clothing was all pricked and
torn, and her face and hands were
covered with mysterious scratches
and small wounds, like those of the

two you just now saw at the wharf!

I suppose you noticed that detail?’

  "‘Noticed it! I was so struck
with it that I saw little else—save
the bag of fir tips.’

  " ‘The fir tips . . . yes. That is
. . . something.’ Morse had evi-
dently forgotten my presence for the
moment, and was staring at the floor
in deep thought.

  “ ‘I have studied closely three of
the five cases that have occurred
since that of Mrs. Van Scoyk,’ he
went on. coming out of his abstrac-
tion. ‘The Ellis boys—you heard
Gibbs mention them?—were two lads
of twelve and fourteen. They, too,
were drowned. They had been out
clamming, but had come in and had
tied up their boat in its usual place.
Even at that, their death must have
been attributed to accident, but for
the fact that, when their bodies wrerc
recovered, their faces, hands, and
clothes bore those same strange
marks! Foul play, of some queer,
crazy kind, was suspected. I looked
for the affair to get into the head-
lines of the metropolitan press, but
it didn’t.

 " ‘The Barry case happened
shortly afterward, Barry was a
bachelor who lived with his unmar-
ried sister, about half a mile up the
coast. He was a farmer, a close-
fisted one who wanted his own, and a
man who apparently hadn’t a
thought above his meager daily sav-
ings. But Barry had one weakness—
fishing. He had spent the whole of
the day of his death somewhere on
the bay, fishing. Plenty of people
saw him rowing home at nightfall;
but he stared straight ahead in the
same half-dead way that Mrs. Van
Scoyk had done, answering the hail
of no one.

  " ‘Well. Barry never reached
home: that is. he reached the prem-
ises, but not the house. His sister,
hearing a shot, ran out to the barn-
lot, where she found him dying. He

had shot himself with a small rifle
which he kept at the barn for killing
rats. Now, listen: Barry’s face and
hands and clothes bore the same queer
marks that the others had borne!’

  ‘‘If Morse meant to impress me, he
succeeded. I sat staring from the
library window into the gloom be-
neath the shrubbery without, almost
as still and breathless as those forms
I had seen lifted from the boat.
When I at last looked up, Morse
went on speaking.

  " ‘But of all the victims of this
mysterious, baffling thing, those of
today are the most touching. They
were at the brink of life’s sweetest
period, the mating time. There was
no opposition to their love affair. I
am as sure as one can be of anything,
almost, that there w'as not a cloud in
their sky when Briggs saw them
leave the wliarf this morning!’

  “ ‘In God’s name, Ed, what can it
be?’ I cried out, springing up to pace
the floor.

  ‘‘He shook his head. ‘Not one
word has anyone ever heard any of
them speak, between what happened
—if anything happened—and their
death.’

  " ‘Their wounds suggest—a fight
with some bird or beast,’ I hazarded.

  ‘‘He looked at the floor, in thought.
‘I can’t think it,’ he replied at last,
raising his gaze to mine. ‘The
scratches are superficial, and there
seems no sign of the claw or talon
about them.’

  ‘‘ ‘Has no search of the vicinity
been made?’

  “ ‘No. It’s been talked of, but—
well, for what would one search, in a
case of this kind?’

  "That silenced me, for the mo-
ment.

  “ ‘But that is not the real reason a
search has not been made,’ he went
on. ‘There’s the danger that a,
search would result in—more fatali-
ties. ’
THE MYSTERY OF SYLMARE

  " ‘I’m willing to risk it,’ I ven-
tured grimly.

  " ‘Not alone!’ he objected, star-
tled by my remark.

  " ‘Well, with a party, then.’

 " ‘A party would be hard to
handle, hard to control. It would
destroy more evidence than it gath-
ered. Besides, a party would look—
silly, when you don’t know what
you’re hunting for. A still hunt
would be better.’

  “I took that as a sort of a chal-
lenge. ‘I’ll go with you, if you like,’
I said.

  " ‘When?’

  "I considered. I had an unfin-
ished article overdue, and an idle
typist up at the colony drawing pay
while she flirted with no telling
which one of the other scribblers or
dabblers.

  " ‘Would the day after- tomorrow
do?’ I asked.

  " ‘Perfectly. I have all the time
there is.’

  "He had become laconic, but I
could see that he was still tense and
nervous. To relieve the strain, I
asked: ‘These other cases you men-
tioned, outside of those you have
looked into, where did you learn of
them ? ’

  " ‘In the files of the local news-
paper. I went to the bottom of the
entire moldy heap. Fifty-four years!
A fire had destroyed everything up
to 1867.’ He was walking the floor,
now, his eyes gleaming like those of
an ecstatic.

  " ‘What did you find in the files?’
I demanded.

  " ‘I found eleven mysterious
deaths in the fifty-four years!’ he
hurled at me, stopping short in his
uneasy prance across the floor. ‘Too
many for one small town,’ he added.
‘I found, too, that all but one of them
happened in summer, and they all
exhibited a strangely identical lack
of cause. Four of the eleven are
known to have borne the strange

wounds we have seen, and I suspeet
that three of the others did. Their
bodies were never recovered from the
bay. Four of the eleven went in
pairs, and* were fishermen, without, I
should say, a thought above their
daily catch!’

  “ ‘There’s something deadly ab-
normal about it, Ed,’ I mused aloud,
peering at the floor.

  " ‘Yes—if the extremely rare, or
possibly the unique, is—abnormal,’
he countered.

  "He plainly was at his theorizing
again, and I thought I might as well
go to the bottom of it. ‘You have—
an idea about it, Ed?’ I half asked.

  "He hesitated, standing with one
foot on a chair to gaze gloomily
through a window. ‘Nothing credi-
ble, Estey,’ he replied, at last. ‘Noth-
ing that I would care to advance,
even to you.’

  "There was but one thought in
either of our minds, I’m sure, when
I left him, a few minutes later, and
that was our pi'oposed search for a
thing that I, at least, hadn’t the
least idea of what we were searching
for. He intended no publicity, no
unnecessary risk, no self-sacrifice, at
that time. I’m sure of that.”

Chapman took up a cut-glass de-
canter from the desk beside us
and went into a tiny lavatory just
off the den for a turn of fresh water.
It was a hot night. As he came out
of the lavatory he snapped a switch,
and I saw the lights in the library
go out.

  "They’re all in bed,” he said.
"There’s no use having the place lit
up like a power house. ’ ’

  We drank some of the water, and
Chapman lit another cigar. I had
had enough of smoking.

  "Morse intended to play square,”
Chapman resumed. "I am positive
of that. But when my telephone bell
rang at an unearthly hour of the
morning we were to go on our search,
94

WEIRD TALES

I knew that something had gone awry.
I got up and went to the instrument.
Its metallic whine, as aloof and im-
personal as though it was giving out
the weather forecast, let me know
that a milkman, early astir, had found
Morse sitting at a raised window of
his study, dead!

  “I threw on my clothes and ran
out to t]je boathouse. I had a key.
There was a line of daylight low in
the northeast, but no one was up. It
was supposed to be a fifteen minute
run to Sylmare, but I must have
jerked the painter through a stay-
ring in the old wharf at the foot of
the town in ten minutes at the most.

  “Early as it was, a crowd of towns-
folk had gathered outside the win-
dow of Morse’s study when I arrived.
They fell back in whispering groups
beneath the trees as I entered the
gate. Naturally, Morse’s death, fol-
lowing so close on that of Frank Kir-
by and Alta Cline, had fallen on them
with cumulative effect. They were
awed. In the dim light under the
trees they looked as might a group of
primitive men, huddled in the face
of some unknown, mysterious danger.

  “I approached the window slowly
iind in extreme dread, stopping short
when I reached it, to stare fixedly
into Ed’s face as at the Medusa! It
bore the baffling marks I was now
i'amiliar with, the marks I had seen
on the youth and the girl in the boat!

  “It was a moment between—him
and me. Not pleasant, those rare mo-
ments alone with the dead. I don’t
know whether death really adds
weight to what one has said, or be-
lieved, or advocated, before dying,
but I do know that my mind brushed
nearer Morse’s queer theory, while I
was standing there before his stark
body, than ever before.

  “Under the spell of his dead pres-
ence, I watched a green worm meas-
ure its laborious way along the sill of
ihe open window between us, watched
it rear its forward length in air,

pause an instant, then bring up its
trailing rear, as though it were a
dragged burden.

  “The worm brought to my mind
one of Morse’s favorite arguments:
that its kind are a significant con-
necting link between the two great
divisions of life, animals and plants,
its imperfect mobility relating it to
the one and its green color pointing
plainly to the other. He believed
that its alternate movement of first
one part of its body and then the
other was due to its scant dole of
mobile energy, sufficient only to ani-
mate half its body at a time.

  “I turned from the window and
went into the house. Everything
was just as it had been the last time
I saw him—everything but Ed him-
self. The familiar appointments of
the study, the books on their shelves,
the writing machine on its stand, the
pens gleaming dully in their wire
holder, seemed only to accentuate the
dead man’s inability to move. He
was now like them—inert. Somehow,
they brought out the fact, subtly,
that he was still all there except that
mysterious quality called conscious-
ness, with its accompanying parallel,
the power to move.

  “There were two doctors in the
town and they were both there, in
the room. I knew Knowles, and he
introduced me to Eberslee — in a
whisper. Imagine a doctor, whisper-
ing over the dead! It shows what the
thing had done to us—to all of us.
The coroner hadn’t yet been called.

  “ ‘We can make nothing of it,’ Dr.
Knowles whispered, meaning, clearly,
the cause of Morse’s act. There was
no mystery about the cause of his
death, or rather, of the means of it.
His lips were burned, and an empty
glass on the writing desk smelled of
acid.

  “ ‘He seems much like the others,’
Knowles went on; ‘but-’ He hesi-
tated, looked at Eberslee, then back
THE MYSTERY OF SYLMARE

95

at me, ‘You probably wouldn’t know
of-’

  " ‘Yes, I know,’ I interrupted.
‘Morse told me, himself. He—we
were—interested in the other cases.’

   " ‘We guessed that,’ Eberslee inter-
posed. ‘That’s why we telephoned
you. That, and these. He left these
written sheets for you.’ He crossed
the room to the writing machine
stand and lifted a paperweight from
a few pages of manuscript.

  “I took up the sheets of paper,
gingerly. There wasn’t a reason un-
der the blue sky why I should take
these two doctors into my confidence
in the matter of Morse’s last words
to me, but such was my immeasura-
ble interest and theirs, no thought
of any other course ever entered any
of our heads, I think. We tiptoed
from the study into the old parlor as
cautiously as though we feared the
contents of the precious sheets might
be jeopardized by a heavy footfall.
Grouped at a window for light, we
read the dimly penned pages, hand-
ing them from one to another as we
read. ’ ’

Chapman left off speaking and
leaned over the writing desk be-
fore him. He unlocked a drawer and
took out of it a Size 11 white envel-
lope. I felt goofy—felt definitely on
the verge of an ordeal. The taboo of
the cerements was about the thing
Chapman held in his hand. It was
getting an ugly time of night, and
the house was still as a crypt. From
off somewhere, a pensive chorus of
frogs reached us faintly, while nearer
at hand, without the screened win-
dows, the whine of baffled mosquitos
haunted the night.

  "Estelle doesn’t know I kept this,”
Chapman said, slipping the rubber
band off the envelope. "She thinks
I burned it. She has a horror of it,
and with reason. It very nearly sent
her after Morse.”

  I took the thing, when he held it

out. I had steeled myself to take it,
while he was fussing with it. I sus-
pect that he noticed my reluctance—
my nervousness. At any rate, he
took up a book, as I unfolded the
manuscript and read:

"My dear Estey:

  "I hope you will forgive my going
alone on the search we had planned,
when I tell you it resulted wholly
from an accident, the turning up of
an old, old book by the house-clean-
ers in their work. I came across it
soon after you left, yesterday.. It
gave me a lead that was irresistible.
I simply could not wait. You will
believe that I deeply regret grieving
Estelle and you; but the riddle drew
me, as a magnet draws metal. I
guess you know why.

  "At the outset, I want to warn you
against the tendency of the human
mind to dismiss as incredible and
unworthy of serious consideration
the exceedingly strange or the
unique. It is a grave fault, or limi-
tation, rather, of our mentality.
Since the mind itself is no more than
a set of comparisons of known forms,
it is at ease and satisfied only among
the known and comparable. The un-
like and the unfamiliar confuse and
offend it. The series of mysterious
cases which will—I have made sure
of that—culminate with my own
death, may be merely the result of
prenomena as definite and, once we
know them, as commonplace, as
gravity or the electric current, once
the laughing stock of incredulous
minds.

  "I have long had more than an
inkling of the nature of the fell en-
tity I set myself the task of bringing
to light. When I left Sylmare this
morning, I knew fairly well what I
was looking for. My problem was
chiefly one of where to look for it,
and in that, I had one governing
clue: that is, all the victims of this
deadly enemy of our kind which I
96

WEIRD TALES

was seeking liad apparently reached
it by means of boats. One of the
victims, too, had also brought away,
probably from the place I sought, a
bag of fir tips. This fact seemed to
me of some significance, since fir is
not a universal growth hereabouts.

  "Then, as if arranged by fate,
came the finding of the old book. It
was an odd volume of the Colonial
period, containing a legend which
assigned a haunted island to our bay,
an island that the redmen who had
lived here for centuries could in no
wise be induced to visit. I assumed-
that the tradition had something to
do with the present mystery.

  "With these premises, I set out in
a rowboat, before daybreak, reaching
the island directly east of Sylmare
soon after daylight. On it I found
no fir; in fact, this island is very
sparsely wooded, and I gave little
time to it. Rowing southward, I
came to the second island at 9:30 in
the morning. It is more densely
wooded, with a sprinkling of fir
among its pines. But, though I spent
upwards of an hour exploring it, I
found nothing unusual about it.

  “Leaving this island, I continued
my course southward. The morning
was now far spent, and I began to
feel that perhaps I had embarked on
a fool’s errand, when suddenly I felt
a strong presentiment come over me,
and I immediately fell under the
guidance of that ancient monitor of
the race, intuition. As I approached
the third island to the southward, I
felt strangely assured that some-
where within its wooded depths I
would find the lair of the unnamable
object of my search.

  “This island is not greatly differ-
ent from the others I had visited, ex-
cept that it is heavily wooded
throughout its extent. It is not
large, and has the general contour
of an ellipse. At its southern extrem-
ity there is a rocky headland, the ex-
treme point of the promontory being

occupied by a strangely sharp and
slender pinnacle of rock, undermined
by the beating sea until it seems to
point to the sun at noonday. This
singular formation, and the deep
gloom beneath the woods of the
island, lent it a distinctly weird and
eery aspect.

  “When I entered the dark wood
after beaching the boat, I had to
stoop and creep to avoid the thickets
of dead branches that clothed the
lower portions of all the trees. As

I	penetrated deeper and ever deeper
into the deathlike stillness of the for-
est, the darkness became as dense as
that of a dimly lit cave. A great
loneliness depressed me as I stopped
from time to time and stood in the
vast dim silence, tensely listening to
the beating of my own heart.

  "The sense of guidance that had
taken possession of me in the boat
still had me in its keeping. _ My
course through the wood was in no
sense a search; rather, it was a toil-
some passage to a definite point,
which a strange assurance told me I
would neithen fail to find nor fail to
know, when I came to it.

   "I at last ran onto a small, circular
rift in the forest, and stopped on its
verge as suddenly as though it had
been a precipice. The weird gloom
that hung above the carpet of dead
pine needles in the wood, here broke
into a half-light that, was like a thick
mist in color and opaqueness. Though
it was high noon, not a ray of sun-
light penetrated either the forest or
the rift by which I stood. Strangely
moved, as if at some hellish shrine,

I	sank to the ground with my back
against a tree.

  "I glanced down at my hands.
They were scratched and bleeding
from tiny wounds made by the sharp
points of dead branches with which
they had come in contact. I could
feel similar abrasions on my face.
Already, I bore the uncanny sign
with which the evil genius of this
THE MYSTERY OF SYLMARE

97

baleful death spot marked its vic-
tims !

  “My eyes fell on two slight inden-
tations in the thick bed of pine
needles under a double tree at my
feet. Between the two depressions
in the litter lay a little heap of fir
boughs from which the tips had been
removed. It was the discard from
Alta Cline’s pillow! I knew from
that, if from nothing else, that I had
found the thing I sought.

  “The trees about the rift were very
old, with knotted, gnarled, and mis-
shapen trunks. Their dead lower
branches, gleaming like whitened
bones through the gray light of the
place, and surmounted by their green
tops, suggested life superimposed on
death, ever growing, ever dying.

 “While I was musing on this
thought, I became conscious of a
sound. It was like the self-made mur-
mur one hears in the silence of a
cavern, but seemed to come from the
Tipper part of the rift, as though the
sound of the sea, by some freak of
acoustics, was caught and repeated
by the mystic cleft in the forest, The
soft, mill-like murmur had come
creeping on my senses unawares; but,
once I had taken note of it, I was
never afterward able to disregard it.

  “The sense of isolation was appal-
ling. The gloom of the wood and the
gray of the rift cast a deep depression
on me, and in the pulseless monotone
that filled the place there was all the
haunting sadness of the night wind’s
moan.

  “The voice of the forest, man’s
earliest lullaby, has ever affected
him deeply, imbuing him with relig-
ious fervor, abasing him in awe and
fear. The Druid’s oak with its pray-
ers and sacrifice, the African’s hal-
lowed fetish-wold, the sylvan shrine
of the South Sea savage—all are
remnants of an ancient kinship be-
tween man and tree that still appeals
through the subtle and desuete
avenues of the soul,
w. T.—3

  “But I attribute the unique power
this strange spot on the island pos-
sessed to a much older kinship, a
brotherhood dating clear back to
life’s dim beginnings, when the ani-
mal and vegetable forms were iden-
tical in their common ancestry. To
me this vengeful death-trap seems
nothing less than the ruing, on the
part of the trees that constitute it,
of an old, old bargain, an ancient
covenant tacitly made by first life,
when the materials it found here re-
quired a division of method for their
utilization, and the primitive forms
drew apart into two classes, the
plants remaining fixed and insen-
tient, securing their sustenance in
one spot, the animal forms develop-
ing mobility in their search for food,
along with its parallel, consciousness.

  “It is a sure thing that each of
these divisions of life still retains, in
suppressed form, the characteristics
of the other—rather, of its own dis-
used half: plants retain the sex char-
acter, while many animals are sex-
less ; the fungus remains in one spot,
yet feeds by alimentation; some ani-
mals have lost their power Of move-
ment, have vegetated, while others
possess the leaf’s power of direct
fixation of carbon; man, highest of
all animals, loses both sentiency and
volition in catalepsy and kindred
states, while insectivorous plants
have clearly developed both mobility
and consciousness.

“Thus I could go on at great
length to convince you that the at-
tributes of animal life merely slum-
ber in the plant, and that they often
are reawakened. No rational ex-
planation of the wood’s spell pre-
sents itself save that the old trees
on the verge of the rift, during the
centuries of arrested growth forced
on them by a sterile soil, had devoted
their idle eons to developing their
sleeping consciousness; that they,
though defeated in their efforts to
attain mobility itself, had yet
98.

«

achieved, preternaturally, some meas-
ure of mobility’s parallel, mentality,
or at least a weird power of sugges-
tion which they were able to employ
in a strange, telepathic way, on such
as fell into their gray and terrible
web.

  “As a pitcher-plant lies in wait for
its prey, these misshapen monsters
of the vegetable world awaited their
victims. The chief accessory by
which they conveyed their deadly
virus of depression to the minds of
their prey was the gray rift in the
forest. This was like a seer’s crys-
tal, in which floated dimly the entire
flux of being, .from incandescent
w'orld birth to dead orb whirling in
darkness, the vast wThole appearing
in a condensed brevity that wras like
the fall of a yellowred leaf. It wras
a cinematograph of eternity itself,
staggering—yes. fatal—to any mere
mote of humanity whose eyes fell on
the screen.

  “The infinite perspective one got
on gazing into the mistlike void wras
paralyzing, and its endless parade of
living forms made consciousness and
movement appear an unending pun-
ishment, an unfinishable task, like
the doom of Sisyphus. The inert and
somnolent vegetable, at rest and in-
capable of suffering, seemed to have
fallen on a better lot than had its
cousin, the animal. The latter, ever
prodded with the impulse to do, to
keep going, appeared to be playing
the clown’s part in the pageant of
being.

 “Such was the sophistry with
which the enormity of the island
poisoned the minds of its victims, the
while it sapped them of their will
and wish to live. And I am con-
vinced that this gloom-girt Upas of
the wood had learned through the
centuries a cunning that guided it in
the adaptation of its subtle propa-
ganda to the mind of every being,
savage or civilized, learned or illit-

 erate, child or adult, who came
within its deadly spell!

“TTow long I sat peering into the
A A mistlike void of the rift I do
not know. I was aroused from the
torpor that lay on me by the fall of
a dead branch from a tree at my
side. I started up, shaking as with a
palsy. The place had grown almost
pitch-dark. The returning tide of
animation and love of life flushed
through me and sent me fleeing
wildly from the spot.

  “I ran through the wood, scarcely
checking my half-mad course to feel
my way among the dead branches
that wounded me in the darkness. I
crashed out of the tangle at some
distance from the boat, and, as I
walked along the beach toward it, I
felt the spell of the rift, which I had
momentarily thrown off, settle back
on me. I heard again its inescapable
monotone of sound. I then recog-
nized the activity that had carried
me away from the spot as the mere
reaction of a wounded spirit, the re-
flex shrinking of sentiency from a
blow.

  “Deeply depressed, I approached
the boat and stood beside it in
thought. The lapping sea crooned a
low accompaniment to the ceaseless
sound that was in my ears. It was
nightfall. An early star twinkled in
the east, and as I gazed at it ab-
sently I found my imagination peo-
pling its unseen satellites with the
appalling infinity of living forms I
had reviewed at the rift.

  “I grew cold. A tremor like that
of a chill shook me, and I reached
for my coat, which I had left in the
boat. As I was about to put it on,
an idea was suggested to me by the
sight of a match-case that fell from
one of its pockets. Catching up the
little silver box, I ran back to the
wood and crept a little way into the
underbrush.

  “I struck a match and touched it
THE MYSTERY OF SYLMARE

to the layer of pine needles -on the
ground. I was startled as the flames
leaped up in the dark thicket, and
plunging out of the wood and across
the beach, I leaped into the boat
as though pursued by an embodied
spirit of the island, and pushed hast-
ily away front the shore.

  "The litter on1 the ground and the
dry lower branches of the trees fed
the Are like an inflammable oil, and
soon the entire wood was a mass of
flames beneath, above which the
green treetops writhed like a tor-
tured multitude.: The upflare of the
flames, lighting the level sea. fell on
me with a glare like that of the blaz-
ing eye's of a monster dying in rage,
as I rowed swiftly away from the
accursed island.

  "TwO hours later, I landed at the
old abandoned wharf south of town,
made my way home unseen, and at
once se't about this task—which is
to be "my last.

  "I apprehend that my theory in
this matter will encounter unlimited
skepticism, and I grant that certain
of my predilections may have made
me overcredulous. With such as
take this view of it I will have no
quarrel, but I suggest that they ex-
plore the fields of natural suggestion
and impression. There is a much
broader and more potent foi’ce in
this quai’ter, T am sure, than has yet
been uncovered. That definite and
effective impression, whether elating
or depressive, is a faculty of certain
aspects of nature is well known, and
I am quite sure that, whether or not
the deadly spot on the island was
conscious, was capable of volition,
the element of suggestion was a po-
tent factor in its fell spell.”

Co the amazing message ended.
^ There were no farewell clauses,
not even a signature, as though the
burden of mere existence had sud-
denly become more than the writer
could bear, and he had simply quit—

quit writing and quit living. In-
deed, the last lines of the script had
grown weak and indistinct, as
though the writer’s power to think
had outlasted his power to move the
pen across the page. The last of the
writing trailed off into an illegible
scrawl, a mere meaningless trail
across the paper—like the track of a
crawling worm!

  Chapman looked up from his book,
when I laid the sheets on the desk;
but he remained silent, forcing me to
speak first.

  "Of all the-!” I stopped, for

want of a fitting word with which to
express my opinion.

  “You think so?”

  There was a tentativeness in his
inflection, that might mask either de-
fense or derision of Morse’s madness.

  “And I thought you stupidly sane,
Estey!” I exclaimed.

  He smiled. “Well, I’m not going
to do anything about it, whether
Morse was right or wrong. In fact,
there’s nothing to do about it. But
there’s more to his theory than you
think. I’ve put the thing up to men
who ought to know, and they all con-
cede that Morse’s premises have
weight. But none of them, of course,
would follow him to his conclusions.
Even the great Sundberg was inter-
ested, though he finally labeled it a
case of a man finding what he started
out to find, whether it was there or
not: that is, he felt that Morse’s bias
had led him to his conclusions.
Oddly enough, Considine was the
kindest one among them. You knew
—or did you know?—Considine. He
must have joined the staff about the
time you went West.”

  “I knew him. I thought there was
a sort of a feud—professional jeal-
ousy or the like—between him and
Morse?”

  "There was. But Considine’s ill
will stopped at the grave. He met
Morse’s theory more than half-way,
went into Bergson farther than I
100

could follow him, and finished with
that old saw about the poorhouse or
the asylum being the only place for
the man in advance of his times.”

  “But the other victims!” I ex-
ploded. “How do you—how does
anyone—account for them ? They
hadn’t Morse’s predilections!”

 “Oh, there’s no mystery about
them, except their number. Even
their mimber is nearly or quite
equaled by a few other famous death
spots in this queer world. Why,
man, one of the most ill-famed of
them all is no more than blocks, I
should say, from the headquarters of
your own beloved Harvester Trust,
in the rotunda of a skyscraper. What
are its wire nettings, but a tangible
acknowledgment of its deadly spell?
And how many victims had it
claimed before the wire was put up?

  “Morse was right enough in his
second guess. It is a form of sug-
gestion that does it—depressive sug-
gestion. It is exactly as though mel-
ancholia were a communicable dis-
ease, and this spot on the island a
carrier of it; and a carrier able to
give the malady to everyone who
came near! There are a number of
places in the world that are known
to be fatal to certain people. The
one at Sylmare differed from the
others only in that it was fatal to all.
It was one lmndred per cent efficient.

  “Great waterfalls, high cliffs, and
even desert wastes, possess this de-
pressing power, as do high bridges
and lofty domes. It’s the perspec-
tive that does it, as Morse suspected.
It puts you under a reversed micro-
scope—makes you little. You may
be sure that I’ve gone to the bottom
of this thing, and you can take it
from me that any view which gives
us that crushing realization of our
infinite unimportance to the whole,
is not good for us. We must remain
unconscious of the whole, and espe-
cially must we be able to disregard
duration. No man can live, merely

waiting for the next instant. And
that was the peculiar doom of the
island. It set its victims counting
the spokes in eternity’s wheel!”

  “How did—Estelle take it all?” I
asked, to break the uneasy silence
that fell on us. My question sounded
crass enough, but I wasn’t quick
enough to stop it, once I had set it
going.

  Chapman hesitated. “She hasn’t
got over it yet, entirely. But she
will. The mistake was in letting her
see this, at all.” He tapped the
folded message in his hand. “But
what was I to do? Her father and
her married sister had come on from
Atlanta with her, and I put it up to
them. They wanted she should see
it. We none of us felt that we could
withhold sueh a thing from her.
What we failed to take into account
was her knowledge of the . other
cases, and of Morse’s work on
them.”

  Chapman sat staring at the desk-
top. “Estelle came nearer believing
Morse’s theory than has anyone else.
She was a nervous wreck, for awhile:
afraid of her own shadow—and of
all other shadows. Strangely or not,
she clung to me. I had been through
much of it with her. She had been
away from her own people, except
for brief visits, so long that I was
really nearer to her than they were.
The upshot of it all was that I mar-
ried her, after a decent time. Her
folks wanted that, too. They are a
sensible lot.

  “We spent a long time getting her
out of it. Travel wouldn’t do. We
tried that. It led us into too many
suggestive .surroundings, too many
gloom spots. You wouldn’t think
that just a flowing stream—or any
steady movement or sound—would
so upset anyone! The sea, too, is
taboo. She can’t bear the sight nor
sound of it, nor the shade of trees,
nor even the shade of a porch. That
is why we have neither- trees■, nor
THE MYSTERY OF SYLMARE

101

porch here. The steady roar of wind
in a grove would drive her to mad-
ness in twenty-four hours.

  "So we at last found this spot and
settled down. We are so far from
the bay that you wouldn’t know it
was there, yet near enough to the
city to avoid isolation . . . But if
I have given you, in all this, an im-
pression of being burdened-”

  I stopped him short, with a reas-
suring gesture. I could honestly do
that. Estelle, in any state of nerves,
could never be a burden to any man.
T recalled the thrill I had got from
the pressure of her soft cool hand at
our greetings, saw again her superb
figure at the piano, its loveliness sug-
gested, where it was not revealed, by
the tight and loose set of the becom-
ing house dress she wore. She was
so eminently desirable, so full of
warm, pulsing life, that I could not
ward off the thought that, whatever
Professor Morse might have done for
Sylmare or for science, he had done
Estey Chapman an immeasurably
good turn.

  T sat in silence, thinking, the deep
stillness of the great dark rooms that
opened upon the den pressing in on
me like a physical presence. To get
away from the eery feeling, I asked:
"What kind of a stir did this thing
kick up in Sylmare?”

  “It kicked up none, if you mean
this,” Chapman replied, reaching for
the envelope and putting the folded
sheets back into it. "They know
nothing of this, up there. The coro-
ner didn’t get within rods of it. I
saw to that. The whole affair
would be almost forgotten, in the
course of time, in Sylmare, if it
hadn’t left a reminder—a monument.
The island is there yet. I rowed out
and took a look at it, naturally.
Eberslee went with me. We went at
night, to avoid talk, and perhaps a
following of the curious.

  “The island lies black and desolate
on the horizon of passing boatmen,
its stony surface thick set with the
blackened boles of the burned pines,
still standing. There isn’t a living
beast, bird, or bush on it—the most
deserted spot on earth! I wouldn’t
want to—it isn’t a nice place to
be, on a moonless night, with the dull
faces of the rocks staring dimly at
the stars, and the night breeze from
off the lapping surf strumming the
low, haunting voices of the standing
dead.”

  Chapman seldom was eloquent,
and I sat abashed at this peroration
of his. In the deep silence that fol-
lowed it, we heard again the lonely
cry of frogs in the distance, the
weird wail' of mosquitos in the dark-
ness without.
A Tale of Dire Occult Evil

THE EDGE OF THE
SHADOW

 By R. ERNEST DUPUY

THAT you should believe this
would be remarkable. I have
no explanation. Limited knowl-
edge I have, and hearsay for the rest.
The hearsay at first I did not believe.
But when the man who lifted the cur-
tain had gone West—and he was a
hard-headed soldier man—I won-
dered. For his going, when one takes
everything into consideration, fitted
in. And to that, at least, I can bear
witness.

  We were lying in our dugout at
Romagne, waiting for zero hour. Out-
side, Fritz’s counter preparation was
messing things up considerably.
Through an instant’s lull came the
long-drawn howl of a dog—if it was
a dog. And something scratched and
slithered against the sturdy logs of
our shelter. A spray of shrapnel,
perhaps.

  “It’s calling me,” was all that he
said.

  I can still see his face and the quiz-
zical lift of his eyebrows in the glare
of our gasoline lantern—we were mo-
torized artillery and did things in
style. And as I returned his stare,
his yarn, forgotten for two years,
came back.

  He had to go out a few minutes later
to check up data at the guns, and
when we found him in the dawning
a splinter—or something—had ripped
away his throat. Nothing else. But
even now, when a dog gives dismal
tongue in the quiet of the night, I feel
102

my hackles rise and the ice creep up
my backbone, and I wonder.

  It was a book that had made him
open up to me in the first place—a
book called Dracula. Ever read it?
No? Well, sometime when you want
a good crawly chill, look it over., He
noticed it on the shelf one night when
he had dropped in at my quarters for
a chat, some time before we went into
the war. And he asked me what I
thought of it. He didn’t pay much
attention to my opinion, I guess, but
sat there sucking his pipe and nod-
ding while I talked. And then he
said:

  “I’ve scraped against the edge of
that stuff. Just the edge. It’s not so
good.”

  Now, he wasn’t at all the type of
man that one would link up with that
sort of yarn. And for that reason it
made all the more impression on me.
He didn’t attempt any explanation
either; just told it as it struck him.
And do not get the idea that he was
boasting of his conquest. I didn’t
know the girl, never would know her.
And we had been friends too long for
him to fear that I might blab. His
thoughts had just come to a boil, I
imagine, looking at the book and
bringing back the thing, so he had to
get it out of his system.

  It seems that he had met her in a
casual way, but first glance had been
like fire to tow. Headlong they went
into it, with open eyes, a well-matched
THE EDGE OF THE SHADOW

103

pair. She must have been a wonder.
A Russian, with all the Slavic grasp
of the ars amandi, one moment all fire
and passion, the next an iceberg. A
thoroughbred, too. "Gone wrong,” if
you will, but always a thoroughbred.
And he—was my friend. Not that he
elaborated on their adventure. I sim-
ply filled in, in my mind’s eye, the
brief, bold outline he blocked out.

'"pHE climax came one night when
-*• they were riding. They had had
several nocturnal prowls on horse-
back, I gathered; brief intervals of
dalliance. This night they took a
trail that was new to both. Imagine
them jogging side by side, the August
moon rising over the treetops, throw-
ing the masses of foliage into deep re-
lief; great blocks of velvet blackness
against the cloudless sky. About them
fields shining silver in the moonlight.

  The shadows swallowed them up as
the trail twisted into the woods, the
man leading, his white-shirted back
gleaming vaguely to the woman fol-
lowing close, the horses picking their
way up hill and down. Through
brush and trees the trail ran, now
sloping upward on hillsides whose
inky depths defied the faint moon-
light ; now plunged in woodland pock-
ets. I could feel the gloom that closed
them in, as he talked; a tangible thing
seemingly, ever surrounding, yet ever
giving way before their advance un-
til at last they broke through to a
moonlit plateau and cantered to-
gether over the swelling ridges to
draw rein on the very crest of the
cliff.

  Below them the lowlands spread in
tawny languor till they touched the
silver-flashing edge of the moon-swept
sea on the horizon; behind them the
swale of plateau ran clear to the cur-
tain of the woods..

  And then, he said, they decided to
explore farther. Again they entered
the woods—this time a clump of trees

guarded by a fringe of stunted, deso-
late-looking deadwood. And some-
how the air felt different. There was
a chill and dankness about it he had
not noticed in the other woods. The
girl shivered. Up a slight incline and
then into the open again and on their
right a dark mass—the gloomy pile of
a deserted house, its empty windows
black leering dead eyes, the moon-
light heaping fantastic shadows about
its front and through the ruins of
what had once been a noble porte-
cochere. A bit of broken pane in one
of the lower windows flickered eerily
in the moon-rays. The girl brought
her animal close to his, her eyes
shielded with one hand as she passed
the house with averted head.

  "What’s the matter, dear?” he
joked. “Afraid that you will see the
goblins holding carnival inside?”

  But she only cowered closer in the
saddle. And that was so odd, so dif-
ferent from her usual bold demeanor
that it chilled him. And then some-
thing, vague, unformed, brushed be-
tween them. He felt it touch his
boot, he said.

  The girl screamed, the horses
plunged, and she wheeled -her beast,
crowding the man into the brush as
she spurred past him. He followed,
only to see her throw her horse once
more upon its haunches as she turned
again, squarely in front of the house.
And the thought passed through his
mind of the house as a finite being,
an unclean object squatting there in-
side its circle of blasted trees.

  He rode up beside her as she sat,
with staring eyes and heaving breasts.
And to his question she answered sim-
ply-

  "It is the end,” she said.

  And then her mood changed and
her lips sought his and covered them
with voluptuotis kisses.

  “Dismount,” she whispered.. I
could see the perspiration gather on
his forehead as he told this part, al-
though his voice never changed.
104

WEIRD TALES

  "Dismount,” she coaxed again,
and her lips caressed his throat. Her
arms were about him now as they
pressed closely, the horses jammed
against one another.

  "We are going in there together,
dear boy,” and the white teeth
touched his flesh. And through him
passed a wave of pure terror.

 "I’m damned if we are!” he
snapped, and tearing himself loose,
snatched at her bridle and urged the
horses into a gallop. He didn’t re-
member how they got out, he said.
The horses must have found the way.
All he remembered was a rush
through the restraining underbrush,
the girl sobbing as they went, until at
last they broke through to the high
road and sanity.

  That night she told him her story.
Told him, with his arms about her;
and lie quivered now and then at the
telling, and once, as a dog howled
somewhere in the distance, he pushed
her from him for a moment. She un-
derstood and laughed, though the
tears were close beneath.

  She was twelve, she said, when the
Terror first came to her. In her home
on the Dniester, almost in the shadow
of the Carpathians—a feudal hold
whose foundations went back to time
immemorial, one wing was forbidden
territory. Blocked off from the rest
of the old castle it was, with its own
tiny court, the only entrance a door
giving from the east tower to the
courtyard. The gatekeeper, old Por-
tal, was the only human she had ever
seen go through its entrance.

  Playing with her jacks one after-
noon she found the courtyard door
open, and with the curiosity of a child
overcoming the strict injunction, had
slipped in.

  It was late and the rays of the set-
ting sun were striking the massive
tower door. Sitting on the lintel she
idly threw the jackstones against the
oak. Deeper the shadows grew except

for one bright spot, at the height of a
man’s head, where the sunlight
struck. Once again she carelessly
tossed the jacks against the door.
There was a rattle and stir inside, and
with a creaking groan the door swung
inward and the child found herself
staring at something that lurked and
mewed in the opaque shadow. Star-
tled, she rose to her feet, and It rose
too, and stood with head and shoul-
ders framed in the light of the dying
sun, gazing down on her.

  Terror froze the girl, for through
the dusk she could see the body—the
body of the Thing That Should Not
Have Been. And she! cowered there.
It bent toward her and she felt her-
self picked up in arms that were not
human, crushed against a form not
human, while the face that was hu-
man but should not have been blew
its fetid breath upon her. In a voice
rasping and metallic, like no human
voice, it spoke, in a horrid, unforget-
table monotone that thrilled and bit
deep into her brain.

  "You have come to me of your own
free will; you have called me. Again
will I come to you and yet again.
And you shall belong to me, body and
soul, to do my bidding, for the ages
and ages to come.”

  One arm forced the girl’s head
back, passing over her neck in a
dreadful caress. The Face bent over
her throat, the slavering lips touched
her skin, the pointed teeth pressed
against her flesh. Came one shriek of
terror from her and then oblivion.

  She was sixteen when she met the
Terror again. Riding through the
woods near Garenstein with her
cousin Ivan, the pair of them madly
in love, she had felt the icy blast of
a wave of horror and sensed the
shadowy Thing that loped on all
fours by her stirrup, its hot breath on
her boot and the touch of fearsome
lips on its leather. All that evening
she had cowered in her room, gazing
THE EDGE OP THE SHADOW

105

at the boot that lay where she had
flung it, a broad white mark blasted
on its shining surface. For she was
certain then, she told him, that what
they had said was a terrible dream,
four years ago, had been no dream at
all.

  Ivan, called to the colors the next
day by the mobilization, lay, a few
months later, a sprawling corpse in

the blood-soaked morasses of the Ma-
zurian lakes, she told him.

  Whether or not my friend ever saw
the girl after that I don’t know. At
any rate he never mentioned the tiling
to me from that day until the night
he died. So there the matter lies. I can
not give any explanation. Perhaps
you can. But the howl of a dog at
night annoys me.

The Old Crow of
Cairo

       By T. LOVELL BEDDOES (1803-1849)

                                     (Reprint)

          Old Adam, the carrion crow,

             The old crow of Cairo;

           He sat in the shower, and let it flow
           Under his tail and over his crest;

             And through every feather
             Leak’d the wet weather;

             And the bough swung under his nest;

             For his beak it was heavy with marrow.

Is that the wind dying? 0 no;

              It’s only two devils, that blow
              Through a murderer’s bones, to and fro,

                 In the ghosts’ moonshine.

          Ho! Eve, my gray carrion wife,

             When we have supped on kings’ marrow,

          Where shall we drink and make merry our life?

              Our nest it is Queen Cleopatra’s skull,

              ’Tis cloven and crack’d.

             And batter’d and hack’d,

               But with tears of blue eyes it is full:

              Let, us drink then, my raven of Cairo!

Is that the wind dying? 0 no;

              It’s only two devils, that blow
              Through a murderer’s bones, to and fro,

                 In the ghosts’ moonshine.
A \Tale of Reincarnation

The Algerian Cave

          By DICK HEINE

  A T FIRST it was strange, this
tragic thing, hard to under-
JL a. stand. But now it is so clear,
so logical. I thought Louis Fanon
insane. Perhaps I, myself, might
have perished if the bullet had come
two feet nearer. Who knows? But
I will tell all—all.

  At 2 o’clock in the afternoon of
that unforgettable day I was loung-
ing in the sitting room of my second-
story apartment in Paris and waiting
for my friend, Paul Mitrande, who
was to drive me to the art reception
at 3. I am an American artist,
Arden Dexter, finishing my studies
abroad. Paul had been my friend
since the great war, for we had
served in the same regiment when I
was brigaded with the French. I was
thinking of the picture he was going
to exhibit. He had never told me
its name, and I hadn’t the least idea
what kind it was; but he had assured
me that it was certain to win the
prize of fifteen thousand francs.
There are many reasons why I am not
going to mention the name and exact
locality of the place where the recep-
tion was held and where occurred the
strange event that led to stranger
things.

  Just before 3 Paul came in, smil-
ing as usual. He was about five
feet six inches, solid and strong. He
was dressed in his usual good taste,
this time in gray. His face was a
healthy tan, a fresh, beaming, open
face, upon which rested an expression
of satisfaction. His hair was sleek
and black, and beneath his small,
106

dark mustache showed a set of ivory-
white teeth. His brown eyes were
almost Oriental in their depth of feel-
ing. In spite of his French vivacity,
Paul was, at the same time, the soul
of calmness.

 He placed both hands upon my
shoulders when I rose to greet him.

 "And how are you, Arden?” he
asked. "The judges have told me
the decision will be reached by tomor-
row night. Just think—on the next
morning I shall be given the award. ’ ’
"You are always too sure, my
friend,” I said. "Your picture, no
doubt, is wonderful. I wish you
would tell me the name of it. ’ ’

 "The name—it is ‘The Algerian
Cave’, and I have created it from
sheer inspiration. It is a picture
from the well of my soul. I have
drawn upon the treasure house of the
subconscious. That, you know, bears
the writing of the Infinite; it is ever
revealing something new in the his-
tory of the individual and the race.
I am sure of the prize—my work
is a part of me. And I believe, of
course, that I am eternal.”

  "You have your chance, Paul, but
don’t forget there are dozens of good
rivals. When shall we go—now?”
His roadster was soon speeding
down an avenue lined with trees that
were just beginning to drop the col-
ored leaves of autumn. I settled back
comfortably, smoking and thinking
how pleasant it was to have a friend
I dearly loved and not a care in all
the world. At length we entered the
Rue de la Convention, and then- the
THE ALGERIAN CAVE

107

Avenue de Breteuil. We did not
drive long in this, but left it for a
less well-known .street not so very far
from the Place Vauban. Paul headed
for the parking space beyond a tall
building on the edge of a square,
where dozens of machines were placed
in line.

  A number of well-dressed gentle-
men were standing about in the ves-
tibule of the building when we en-
tered, and a few students were
pacing the hall by twos and threes
discussing learned subjects in clouds
of tobacco smoke. We greeted the
friends we saw and went to a little
open space among the flowers and
plants at the end of the exhibition
room, where we sat down and waited
for the reception to begin. It was
only a few minutes of the set hour,
and people were arriving in consider-
able numbers. From my position I
had a good view of the whole room.

  It was about fifty feet wide and
seventy long; the floor was of pol-
ished hardwood, and the ceiling
ornately decorated. Electric globes
in suitable places aided the skylight.
A fountain of water and a statue
stood in the middle of the floor.. On
the walls were hung the pictures to
be exhibited, each one covered with
its veiling cloth.

  In groups stood immaculate men
and handsomely gowned women and
girls. It was a crowd typical of such
affairs. I could see Sir Marden Ford,
who pulled always at his little mus-
tache; there was a lady, gray and
stout but finely finished, holding his
arm. The students, with their attempt
at correct dress and ease of manner,
moved leisurely and indifferently
about.

  But all these people did not hold
my attention long. Apart from any-
' one stood a man who interested me
in several ways. He was somewhat
taller than Paul and dressed in shiny
black. He had a black look hanging
about him, as if he might be a man of

shady thoughts and unknown deeds.

I sensed this personal atmosphere, or
whatever it was, in a way I could not
understand. His beardless face was
dark and sharp, and his hair jet-black.
A glance into his eyes, quick, venge-
ful, shrewd, made me nervous; his
prominent nose reminded me of an
eagle’s beak when he looked keenly
about at everything and everybody.
It was difficult to take my gaze from
him. I was attempting to form some
estimate of his character and wonder-
ing who he might be, when the recep-
tion formally began.

   Forty-five minutes later the gather-
ing was before the picture painted by
Paul Mitrande. The artist himself
stood near the wall directly by one
end of his canvas, and I was at his
elbow. Ford and his lady were at the
other end of the picture. The circling
crowd, with interested faces, awaited
the lifting of the veil. When a spec-
tacled member of some big society
performed that act, I saw “The Al-
gerian Cave” for the first time.

  The painting represented the in-
terior of a cave, lighted by the sun’s
rays streaming in through the mouth,
which, from the view selected, could
be observed opening upon the shining
stretches of a barren wasteland. In
one corner of the cave was a niche in
the wall; in this niche rested the
golden bust of a beautiful goddess.
She shone in the sunlight. On the
ground beneath her was an open
treasure chest filled with precious
stones. On each side of the chest were
stacks of bars of gold. Kneeling by
the treasure was a Roman soldier,
lightly armored but wearing a helmet.
His hands were filled with the stones,
and he was looking into the face of
the goddess. Back of this soldier
stood another similarly clad. They
were both fine examples of their race
and breed; doubtless, no better1 men
had ever thrust the short-sword. The
picture was marvelously colored,
and I felt that Paul Mitrande had in-
108

WEIRD TALES

deed created something from the
well of his soul. The eternal Rome
is forever in the hearts of men; this
picture called from the canvas the
gloi-y and adventure of the legions,
fighting their way of conquest over
the world. In the hinterland of
northern Africa, two brave men had
stumbled upon the workings of some
unknown race. As Paul explained,
perhaps the treasure and statue had
been placed there by thieves, who
had looted a far city ages before the
birth of Rome. He would leave that
to the fancy of the individual.

 Many were the sighs of wonder
and admiration. I could scarcely
realize myself the triumph of my
friend. Only one other picture had a
chance against his.

  The moment after the first wave
of enthusiasm, it happened.

  The people gave way to the dark
man in the shiny black suit. He
forced himself rudely to the front
and gazed with wild interest at the
picture. On his face was the keen-
ness of the hawk after its prey.
Suddenly he pointed his finger at
smiling Paul and cried: "You!” A
revolver flashed in the hand of the
man, and a sharp report followed.

  Paul fell into my arms with the'
blood spurting from his neck. The
stranger would have fired again, but
Sir Marden Ford sprang at him, tore
the weapon from his hand, and
choked him to the floor. I dragged
Paul out of the crowd and hastened
with him to a bench. With the as-
sistance of some other gentlemen,
Sir Marden secured his prisoner.

1 shall relate briefly the events pre-
ceding my visit on the following
afternoon to the Depot of Prefecture
of Police in the Palais de Justice. The
officers came in from the street when
summoned and relieved the gallant
Englishman of his charge. The mad-
man proved to be Louis Fanon, and
he was rushed away to the local com-

missaire de police and then taken to
the Depot and put in solitary con-
finement. An ambulance was called.
Poor Paul was carried to a hospital.
The examining surgeon performed
an emergency operation, but he
would give out no word about my
friend’s condition; I did not know at
7 o’clock in the evening whether
Paul would live.

  The people had been horrified at
the attempted murder, no one being
able to understand why such a sud-
den and brutal attack should have
been made. Sir Marden sent me a
personal note at my rooms, express-
ing his sympathy and asking to be
remembered to Paul’s mother; he
was sorry that he had not foreseen
the villain’s intention.

  All night I waited in anxiety. I
made no attempt to sleep, but paced
the sitting room, smoking and trying
to understand the thing that had
happened, in which I was so much
concerned. The thought of Paul's
possible death almost felled me.
A few years before, I had been
hardened against death and destruc-
tion, having seen them in all forms;
but now, relaxed into the ease of
peace, I felt the deep grief of a nor-
mal man. Paul was the dearest
friend I had in Paris. Life would
be sad without him. I felt as if I
could no longer continue my studies.
But the thing that hung about me
was the mystery of the attack. Why
should the man have attempted
Paul’s life ? Other pictures had been
exhibited. Where was the relation
between "The Algerian Cave” and
the brain of this insane criminal?
For the life of me I could make no
progress. If Paul were to die, I
should have a thing unsolved that
would haunt me down the years. I
wanted to see my friend, to clear up
this mystery, to know that in the life
of Paul Mitrande there was no justi-
fication for this deed. I decided to
go as soon as possible and see him;
THE ALGERIAN CAVE

109

then I should endeavor to discover
the motive of the criminal.

  At 10 o’clock I called on Paul’s
mother. She was so overcome that
she could hardly speak. While it
was true that so far I had heard
nothing of her son’s condition, I
tried to console her, saying that I
had indeed heard and that all was
sure to be well. She begged me to
go and learn more. I left her and
went directly to the hospital.

  The attendants were reluctant to
let me see the patient, but upon hear-
ing that I was the man’s best friend
and came at the request of his
mother, they admitted me to the
sickroom. Before I entered, the
nurse told me the bullet had missed
the jugular vein, but that some of the
smaller blood-vessels had been dam-
aged. Paul, having stood the an-
esthetic well, was resting quite
comfortably amid his white surround-
ings, but he was not permitted to
speak. His face indicated that he
knew of my anxiety, and when he
heard that I had reassured his
mother, his teeth showed in a game
grin. Yet there was a ghastly look
to his face, and I knew that if
chance there was, it was small in-
deed. Only the next few hours could
tell.

  "I am going to find out if possi-
ble, Paul,” I said to him, "why the
attack was committed. I suppose you
think, as I do, that the man is a
maniac. I shall ask permission this
afternoon to see him. If he will talk,
I shall no doubt have something to
tell you when I see. you again.”

 With a grasp of the hand he
thanked me for coming, and I left
him. But still I did not know
whether he would live. I should
have to lie again to his mother. If
death came, she would overlook the
lie; if life prevailed, there would be
no harm done.

 At 4 o’clock I made my way to
the proper officials. They said the

prisoner was not dangerous unarmed
and that I might have a short inter-
view. Soon, surrounded by things of
steel, I was face to face with Louis
Fanon. The conducting gentleman
of arms, chin in air, respectfully
walked away down the corridor,
holding liLs keys behind his back and
digging his heels into the floor with
an air of absolute indifference.

'C'anon sat on a bench in his cell *
and received me with perfect
calm. He was clad in his black suit
and looked quite comfortable. I was
surprized to see that the mean ex-
pression had vanished. He did not
look the same man at all; some sort
of relaxation had come over him.
The extraordinary keenness of his
eyes was absent, and they were now
of a softer light. I sat down oppo-
site him, and he spoke to me in
French.

  ‘1 So you are Monsieur Dexter, the
friend of Paul Mitrande?”

  "I am,” I said, "and I have come,
Monsieur Fanon, to ask you to tell
me why you committed this assault.
The man is unknown to you. You
doubtless had never seen him be-
fore.”

  "There are many things to be ex-
plained,” he said suavely. "But I
will tell them all. You assume,
Monsieur, that I am insane. I assure
you that nothing could be more un-
true. A saner man never walked; a
man more devout in his worship of
right never lived. I have achieved
my purpose, and my heart is calm.”

  "Calm! You are indeed cold-
blooded to speak so when at the hos-
pital this man lies near to death!”

  "Your feelings will be different
when you hear my story. There
are things—many things—beyond
the comprehension of materialistic
Americans like you. No doubt this
criminal Mitrande will have a few
apologies to make to me!”
110

WEIRD TALES

   I could not tolerate these caustic
comments; I was almost in a rage
when Fanon bade me keep my
temper.

  "You shall have no interview un-
less you let me say what I must say.
You may leave this prison wTith a
hand-clasp of affection for me in-
stead of with the hatred that you
bring.”

   "Proceed with your story,” I said.

  He placed the tips of his fingers
together, leaned back, and looked at
me with an air of complete ease.

  "I presume, Monsieur Dexter, that
you have some imagination. We
artists must have, or we could never
become artists. Imagine, then, if
you can, a shining stretch of desert
wasteland. Picture the sand, the far
distances, and reflections, and colors.
Make some blue mountains rising
into the sky a long way off. Imagine
that you saw two Roman soldiers
walking across the wasteland. They
were lightly armored and wore hel-
mets. They were a legion’s finest.
You can imagine those things, can
you ?’ ’

   "Easily,” I said, looking into his
eyes for some brightness or dilation
that would reveal his evident lunacy.

  "Then I shall proceed to tell you
the story of the two soldiers. One
was the soldier Quintian, and the
other the soldier Severus. And de-
voted friends they were. They would
have died for each other. They had
obtained leave from their company
in order to make a four-day trip
into the mountains in search of ad-
venture. The blue mountains you
created in the distance were not so
very far from them when their first
day’s march was over. The morning
of the second day found them high
in the hills, scanning the gorges,
peering into dark holes, and looking
everywhere for anything of interest.

  "At length they came to the
mouth of a cave. When they went
'inside, they”looked behind them and

saw the shining stretches of the
desert framed by the mouth of the
cave. In one corner of the cavern,
lighted by the rays of the sun, was a
little projecting ledge or table, upon
which rested the bust of a golden
goddess. Down on the ground was
a small treasure chest, and near each
end some stacks of gold bars.

 “With a sharp cry Severus
dropped on his knees before the chest
and lifted the lid. Quintian re-
mained standing behind him. They
saw, gleaming with the colors of
Paradise, a thousand precious stones
—jewels that would make them rich
beyond the dream of mortals. The
sticks of gold were nothing beside
the gems. Severus feasted his eyes
and scooped up a handful.

 “Now Severus could not have
known what went on in the mind of
Quintian nor what he did. But I
can easily imagine that. Quintian
stood looking down at what was be-
fore him. Slowly his face hardened.
His right hand went to his short-
sword. His left hand snatched the
unbuckled helmet from the head of
Severus. Then in a flash the butt
of the sword descended upon the
bared head. Severus fell limp and
unconscious with the blood pouring
from his scalp. Then what did
Quintian do? Oh, yes. He kicked
the body of Severus to one side and
stooped to examine the chest. He
filled it with the gold -bars and
strained to lift it to his shoulder. It
was almost too much for one man to
carry, but he carried it anyway. A
last satisfied look at the motionless
Severus, and Quintian left the cave.

  ‘ * Severus lay for a day and a half.
When he came to his senses, he
slowly turned over on his side and
tried to sit up. He succeeded feebly.
His hand went to his head, which
seemed bursting with pain. He
crawled to the mouth of the cave and
looked out. Nothing was to be seen
of Quintian. And Severus then re-
THE ALGERIAN CAVE

111

fleeted how fortunate he was to be
alive. He slept. Upon awakening,
his head was clearer, and he left the
cave and made his way down among
the rocks to a little stream. Here
he bathed and refreshed himself.
Then he ate some berries and de-
scended to the plain. A few days
later he was captured by a wandering
tribe and carried away to slavery.”

  "And what became of him after
that?’? I asked impatiently.

  "He escaped on the borders of
Egypt and fled into the interior of
that country. A few years ’ labor
found him still poor, and finally
sickness overtook him. He fell in
the streets with running sores, and
he had to beg for his bread. On his
deathbed he cursed the trusted
friend who had wrecked his life.

  "And now, Monsieur Dexter, you
doubtless want to know what be-
came of the soldier Quintian. Sev-
erus, befoi’e his death, had learned
a good deal about him by carefully
questioning travelers from Rome. In
fact, he had learned nearly all I shall
tell you. Quintian escaped from the
mountains with his treasure, hired
a substitute to serve in the army,
and went to Rome. There he dis-
posed of his jewels and gold. He
moved to Sicily and established him-
self in a fine estate. He built a great
house and made a vast garden sur-
rounded by marble walls. Now what
think you of the fate of Severus com-
pared with that of Quintian?”

 "Quintian was a knave and a
scoundrel, and Severus an unfortu-
nate man betrayed by his friend,” I
said. "Monsieur Fanon, you have
but imaginatively constructed a tale
around the picture painted by Paul
Mitrande, who lies now almost cer-
tain to die. You are indeed insane!”
I waxed angry and rose to my feet.
"Unless you can establish your san-
ity, you will be sent to a prison
worse than death, where are many
like you. If -you can prove that you

are in your right senses, you will fare
little better. You will be convicted
and put to death or given a life sen-
tence at hard labor. I shall rejoice
if the blade falls upon your neck!
You have no resource. I believe that
by this fabrication you hope some-
how to escape.”

  Fanon smiled.

  "You are inclined to doubt me,
Monsieur. There are many things
you may doubt. But do you not see
any relation between what I have
told you and my attack on Paul
Mitrande?”

  "Not the slightest,” I answered.

  "Paul Mitrande was the soldier
Quintian, and 1, Louis Fanon, teas
the soldier Severus!”

  I gasped -with staggering compre-
hension.

 "I refuse to believe you!” I
shouted. “How do you know? How
do you know?”

  "I was a queer child, Monsieur,
born in the south of France. At an
early age I used to stand upon the
seashore and point toward Africa,
begging my nurse to take me there—
just there, over there, where I used
to live. She would ignore, my child-
ish fancies and drag me back to the
house, sometimes punishing me. I
had flashes of some past existence—
visions of sands, of rivers, of black
slaves toiling in the sun. At five
years of age I fashioned a sword
from a board, though I had never
seen a sword, and drove my play-
mates from the nursery. At six I
lay supposedly dying of a fever. De-
lirious, I was crying in an unknown
tongue. The priest they brought in
rose from the bedside and rushed
from the room. Later he returned
with the most learned father in the
district. They both listened and
agreed that I was talking in Latin;
they would not translate, but said I
was calling for someone. The elder
placed his hand upon my head and
answered me in Latin. Immediately
112

WEIRD TALES

I became calm, the fever subsided,
and the old family doctor clapped his
hands for joy that life was mine.
But I was delicate for some time
after that. I still wanted to go
across the sea. The doctor advised
my father to take me to Africa to
satisfy the craving. We went. On
the desert I was at home. They said
I seemed to recognize places, to be
joyous at times. They observed a
great emotion when we approached
the Nile. After six months in Egypt,
I grew stronger in every way. I was
brought home to begin my schooling.

  "I learned rapidly. I seemed to
know some of the Latin stories, when
we came to that study, before I read
them. The teachers, astounded,
hinted at precocious idiocy. My
father feared I should die before ma-
turity. But my passion for outdoor
play developed me into a running,
tearing, shouting youth, who would
fearlessly charge upon his comrades
in the games.

  ‘ ‘ I know that I was Severus. There
is no other explanation. ”

  Fanon paused. Ilis face was tense
and wet with sweat.

  I felt as if I wanted to flee from
that cell, to hide myself somewhere,
to wipe the memory of this day from
my brain. Paul Mitrande-!

 I rose and stepped toward the
door. The hand of Fanon held me
back. His face had changed to
peacefulness again, and he spoke less
vehemently.

  "In my life, Monsieur, I have been
cursed with a passion for revenge—
a thing I could not understand. I
have hated my fellowmen since be-
coming a man. I have gone armed
of late years. Yesterday, when I
saw that picture, the things of my
other life flashed back to me. I
knew that Paul Mitrande could not

have painted that picture unless he
had been Quintian in that cave of
Africa two thousand years ago!
Hardly knowing wThat I did, I shot
him. You know the rest. Here I
am, perhaps to be adjudged insane,
perhaps to be convicted and impris-
oned or put to death, and never to fin-
ish my studies and become an artist
known to the world. But it may be
well after all. I have not the means
to complete my courses. I shall have
to wait upon the doing of the law.”

  Tears came into his eyes, and he
sank baek upon his bench.

  I left the prison hurriedly. In the
taxieab that hurled me along the
boulevards I tried to collect my rea-
son. I could do nothing but believe
the things Fanon had told' me.
The dangerous condition of Paul
Mitrande finally brought me in touch
with reality again, and when I en-
tered the hospital, I was almost my-
self again.

T>aul mitrande lived. He is calmly
-*■ sitting on my sofa now while I
finish the story I have set myself to
write. Every day he has driven over
to sit by the fire, to gaze into its
flames, and to muse over the things
that may be and that may not be.
Sometimes he is sad, sometimes joy-
ous; and often in his deep, brown
eyes, I see the welling of man’s im-
penetrable soul. "The Algerian
Cave” was awarded the prize. Paul
recommended that lenity be shown
Louis Fanon, and the court gave it.
The prisoner was released after a
very short term. The day he was
freed, Paul met him at the prison
gates and handed him a deposit-book
and a check-book; then Fanon
learned that Paul had deposited to
his credit ten thousand francs of the
prize money.
The Epic of the Microbe-hunters

The Dark Chrysalis

By ELI COLTER

The Story So Far

SAUL blauvette, working in his laboratory with
John Cloud and Henry Arn, discovers the
microbe of cancer—a germ shaped like a devil-
fish, that Is visible only when stained with a
combination of red and blue dye. He finds that
his mother is tainted with the cancer-microbe,
and feverishly works to find a cure for the
dread disease. He is spurred on by Helene Kin-
kaid’s faith in him.

THE scientist’s first succeed-
ing step was further experi-
mentation on the animals.
From every rat, mouse, guinea-pig
and rabbit and monkey in the lab-
oratory he with the aid of Cloud and
Arn examined a piece of flesh, while
he waited the doctor’s gruesome bot-
tles of samples. It took the three
men two days to make the final
round, and their findings were pre-
cisely the same as they had been
with human flesh. In several rats,
guinea-pigs, mice and one monkey
they found the devil-fish microbes
swarming like bees in a hive. The
other animals were free from the
bacterium. All these in the animals
on which they had as yet made no
attempt to produce a cancer. In all
the animals developing cancer the
microbe multiplied and throve. Hav-
ing satisfied himself so far, Saul be-
gan a series of ghastly experiments.

  Into each of the animals un-
touched by the microbe he injected
live, groping bacteria from the flesh
of the dead man’s tongue, saving out
only a few of each species immune.
On each of the animals receiving the
germ he began the process of irrita-
tion with his tar and oils and gums.
One monkey free of the cancer germ
he saved for a third test. He began

the process of irritation to deter-
mine whether an animal not having
the microbe in its flesh could de-
velop the cancer growth. All this
done, Saul thought of the doctor’s
bottles, and hurried away to
Whittly’s office.

  Whittly had the bottles ready,
and the little scientist stared at the
packet with its grisly contents,
wheeled abruptly and began pacing
aimlessly about the room. Then he
paused suddenly and faced the old
doctor.

  ‘‘Where’s Helene?”

  ‘‘Gone out for lunch, Saul. She’ll
regret having missed you.”

  “Not so much as I. But I’ll see
her soon. Doc”—Saul’s eyes cen-
tered on Whittly’s facc, harassed
and probing—“Arn and Mother are
swarming with those damned mi-
crobes. Arn’s healthy as a bear, ap-
parently. But Mother hasn’t been
well for a long time. She’s never
said a word to me about herself. I
never dared ask. She keeps such a
grim silence. I’ve been brought up
to respect it. But sometimes—I’ve
seen her eyes. Do you know any-
thing about it?”

  “I don’t know,” Whittly answered
slowly, turning his eyes out the win-
dow to escape Saul’s penetrating
gaze. “Her brother and her father
died of cancer of the liver. Didn’t
you know that? Well, they did. I
fancy she’s afraid. Her color’s bad.
But she stays in her shell. She’ll
never come to me till she’s driven

              113

 This story began in WEIRD TALES for Jane
114

sick by fear, and then it’ll be too
late.”

  “By God, it’ll never be too late!”
Saul interrupted swiftly. "Give me
those bottles.” He snatched the
packet from the table and ran from
the room, leaving Whittly staring
after him with strange eyes.

  He raced into the laboratory where
Cloud and Arn awaited him impa-
tiently. All that day three excited
men hung over the microscopes. In
none of the flesh did they discover
any microbes. In Saul there was
bom a frenzy that turned the labora-
tory into a shambles, littered with
blood and fur and stench, noisy with
the squeals and whimpers of suffering
and dying animals. The scientists
worked over the squealing brutes,
brewed soups of seeds and broths
from meat and set to work to obtain
a pure culture microbe for further
experimentation. The ghastly little
devil-fish grew with appalling speed.

  ‘ ‘ If they can grow at that rate, how
in blazes does it take a cancer so long
to develop?” Arn demanded, frown-
ing at the microscope and shaking his
head.

  "Amount of demoralization in the
tissue,” Saul returned. “The more
broken, down the tissue the faster the
bugs can get in their work. We’ve
got to find something that will kill
them when injected into the body,
and yet not injure the human being.
I know there’s no use in trying any
vaccine process with them. We’ve
got to make a totally foreign serum—
God knows from what we’ll make it.
But we’ll find it. And then all the
broken-down tissue in the world can’t
become housing space for a cancer.
But—proof! Proof! We haven’t
any proof! We’ve got to waste time
doing all these things to prove what
I already know—or even I won’t be
satisfied.”

  “Yes, we’ve got to get busy proving
something, all right. We don’t even
know yet that those microbes aren’t

in a dozen other diseases. They may
not have a thing to do with the real
causation of cancer.”

  "You’re ratty!” Saul snapped.
"Rats—pure rats! Of course they’re
the cause of cancer! Haven’t I just
got through explaining to you what I
know? But we don’t dare make a
move toward our goal till we’ve gone
through the maddening process of
proving—proving! I’m going to see
Doc Whittly!”

  So again the old doctor was called
into the ring, a willing and eager par-
ticipant in, the cause of materializing
Saul’s great dream. Again Whittly
turned over to Saul several bottles
with ghastly contents, shivering in-
voluntarily to think of the dangers
faced night and day by those three
tireless men. And Saul Blauvette and
his faithful coworkers bent unweary-
ing over blisters from measles pa-
tients, blood from a tuberculous man,
pus from the one smallpox patient in
town, and even the terrible discharge
from the flesh of a syphilis-eaten
baby. At the end of the long hideous
day Saul raised to his meager height
and looked at his two assistants tri-
umphantly. In not one of the other
diseases did a single devil-fish microbe
appear. It belonged to that malig-
nant thing called cancer, and that
alone.

  Cloud gave back Saul’s slight smile,
nodding, "You win, old man. I’m
beginning to think you’ll win all the
viay.”

  "Of course 1*11 win!” Saul retorted
vehemently. “That’s so much proof.
Now we’ve got to get back to the rab-
bits and rats and guinea-pigs. These
three things we’ve got to prove with
them: that only in the animals having
cancer germs will a cancer appear;
that in an animal not infested with
the germ you can’t start a cancer to
save your soul; and that the cancer
germ itself will never give us a serum
to do the trick of annihilating cancer.
And the world waits—and we’ve so
THE DARK CHRYSALIS

115

much to do! Let’s go!” Biit he was
thinking of his gaunt and silent
mother. She knew that he had lied.

A gain long days of experimenting,
and as they worked, weeks and
months began to fly. They searched
diligently through pieces of animal
flesh and examined sore and irritated
bellies. On none of the animals not
inoculated by the cancer germ did
any sign of cancer appear. Cracks and
small lumps grew, and the moment
the irritation was suspended they
healed quickly and passed away. On
the belly of one guinea-pig they had
inoculated with the germ a crack ap-
peared. A crack that did not heal.
Saul took a minute piece of the irri-
tated edge of the crack and put it
under the microscope. The membrane
was broken and angry. They re-
doubled their efforts at applying irri-
tation.

  In a few months another piece of
tissue from the small growing sore
was put under the microscope. The
delieate epithelial cells had grown
more numerous, thickened, and all
around the edge a congregation of
blood cells was gathered, trying to
assist the sore to heal. But the lit-
tle devil-fish microbes were hard at
work on the weakened tissue, and it
showed no indication of healing. In
a few months more the sore had
grown hard, bled easily and had a
look of going deep. The cells which
before were merely thickened and
angry, now apparently had begun to
grow. Saul pointed it out to Arn and
looked at him with triumphant en-
thusiasm in his enormous slate-colored
eyes.

  "See that? And they tell you can-
cer is a nucleus of seemingly normal
cells that suddenly begin to spread
and eat up all the surrounding tis-
sues! Rats! Look at those bugs!
The cells aren’t really growing! The
dirty little devil-fish have settled in
them and started housekeeping, mul-

tiplying, breaking down new tissue,
eating it cis fast as it breaks enough
to become susceptible! Then they
branch out, the cancer grows deeper,
the epithelial cells penetrate to the
lymphatics and follow to the nearest
glands. We’ve proved the causation
and explanation of that thing called
cancer, Henry!”

  "Yes.” Arn nodded somberly, as
Cloud bent over the lens and squinted
his red-rimmed eyes at the squirming
bacteria.

  "That wasn’t so difficult,” Saul
went on wearily. "What is to come
is the almost impossible task. ’ ’

  ‘ ‘ Conquering the microbe ? ’ ’ Cloud
half stated, half questioned.

  "And thereby, cancer,” Saul sup-
plemented. " We ’ve got our real work
ahead of us. We’ve proved conclu-
sively that the microbe itself can’t
aid us in making a serum—I knew
it all before we started. We’ve got
to find some serum that’ll do the
trick, though. Local application is of
course out of the question, since the
microbes go all over the body. And
when we do find the serum that will

knock the devil-fish-”

  “The world will go wild!” Cloud
cut in. “Think of it! All anyone
has to do is be tested to see whether or
not he has it in his system, and if,
he has it, take the serum, and he
couldn’t get cancer on a bet.”

  "But we’ve got to start some-
where,” Arn frowned, watching Saul.
"And if you know that—where to
start—we’re on the last lap.”

  "We’re on the last lap, all right!”
Saul strode over to the microscope
and stared into it. "But God knows
when we’ll reach the post! No—I
don’t know where to start, but we’ll
experiment with mercury for a be-
ginning.”

There were, then, three years.
Three years in which Saul’s
mother moved ever more slowly, ever
more gaunt, the faded sallowness of
116

WEIRD TALES

her face deepening to a sinister shade.
Three years in which fear and despair
came to brood over the great barn of
a laboratory and the adjoining living-
house, while Whittly looked on with
bitter silence and grim eyes. Three
years that whirled crazily by while
three men grew old in their youth,
turned gray at the temples, worked
frantically with devil-fish microbes
and did weird horrible things in their
tireless search for the serum that
would conquer the cancer microbe.

  They injected aged and devitalized
germs into rats and guinea-pigs half
eaten by cancer, only to see the germs
grow live and active the moment they
joined their kind, sending the small
animals to swift and hideous death.
They dried spinal cords and brains,
blood and body-juices, made serums
and injected them into animals
doomed with the malignant tumors
only to see the cancers increase with
appalling speed and send other small
beasts to horror and extermination.

  Three men grew thin of body, lean
of hope and sick of heart. But they
never relaxed their efforts. When-
ever despair descended to sit on the
shoulders of Saul Blauvette, he
looked into his mother’s eyes and
drove himself harder than ever. And
when he was too weary to go another
step without relief, he sought rest and
surcease in the arms of Helene
Kinkaid. A strange situation ob-
tained between Helene and Saul’s
mother. Never yet had the girl come
near the laboratory. Never yet had
Saul’s mother left it. Saul knew that
the gaunt, fear-ridden woman held
off from her harshly the idea of that
other woman iu Saul’s life. He told
Helene, delicately as he could, and
queerly enough Helene understood..

  "It’s jealousy, Saul,” she said
gently. "A strange kind of jealousy
all mothers know when their children
come to love and another person en-
ters the scene. I think she must be-
lieve that marriage with me will take

you from her. How can I convince
her that I long to take her to my
arms, in place of the mother that died
in my infancy? What can I do?”

  “Nothing.” Saul shook his head
somberly. ‘ ‘ It’s a situation that must
resolve itself somehow. I feel sure
that it will, by some twist of circum-
stance.”

  Helene nodded slowly, believing in
him with utter faith, and in all that
he said. But if either of them could
have looked ahead and seen the “twist
of circumstance” that was to bring
those two women together their
cheeks would have paled and their
hearts gone sick. Saul’s mind was
too occupied with his life-work to give
it much thought.

  Never once did he lose sight of his
great vision, forever holding an inner
mind-picture of the dark chrysalis
broken open at last, bringing light to
a fear-bound world. Here and there a
man sprang into prominence with a
new ‘ ‘ cure for cancer. ’ ’ Saul held his
breath, ready to cheer on a man more
successful than he, only to find the
cure as crazily erratic, as without
basis or virtue as all the old cures.
And he turned to delve anew into
his own research with John Cloud at
one elbow and Henry Arn at the
other.

  Then Henry Arn began to suffer
continuously with an ugly indiges-
tion. It had been bothering him per-
sistently through the last year, grow-
ing steadily worse. He had paid lit-
tle heed to it, dismissing it as nothing,
believing its cause to be mainly strain-
ing overwork, hastily snatched meals
and too little sleep. But when it be-
came so bad that he could keep noth-
ing on his stomach, when he found
himself with sharp pain and contin-
ual nausea for constant companions,
he went to Doc Whittly and asked for
some prescription for a ‘ ‘ slight stom-
ach disorder.” He had, strange as it
may seem, quite forgotten that in his
THE DARK CHRYSALIS

117

flesh the little devil-fish microbes
swarmed and throve and grew.

  Whittly examined him quickly, al-
most perfunctorily, and Helene paled,
listening, at the old doctor’s words.

  "I—Am, you want the truth?”
"Certainly!” Am started at the
doctor’s tone, and his own sallow
cheek grew a shade paler.

  "You’ve a well-developed cancer of
the stomach,” Whittly responded,
turning his eyes from the shock in
Arn’s face. “For God’s sake, man,
why didn’t you come to me before?
I’ve been watching you, I was dis-
turbed at your color. But none of
you ever said anything about your
having any symptoms.”

  "I didn’t think it amounted to
anything,” Am answered, shudder-
ing involuntarily. “Cancer! I’ve
got it! My God, Doc, can’t you do
anything for mef?”

  "It’s too late.” Whittly shook his
head, and his eyes were stricken. "I
could put you on the operating table
and cut you up, but it would be ut-
terly useless. Nobody can save you
now but Saul Blauvette.”

  Henry looked for a moment into
the pitying eyes of Whittly and
Helene Kinkaid, and turned to walk
slowly from the office, like a very old
man, too weary to lift his head and
mark which way he was going.

  So he came to the laboratory, white-
faced and weary-eyed, and Saul, look-
ing into his face, sprang toward him
with a startled cry: "Henry! What’s
the matter? Are you sick?”

  "Sick to death,” Am answered,
and Cloud paled as he heard.
"Whittly says I have cancer of the
stomach, and it’s too late even to
operate. He says nobody can save
me but you.”

 “Oh, my God! Henry! You?”
Saul’s enormous eyes went wide, then
blinked shut as though to close from
his sight some hideous picture.

  “And I.” A harsh, fear-chilled
voice came from the doorway.

  The three men wheeled to see Saul’s
mother, standing facing them, her
head high, her face grim, and in her
eyes the agony of all hell.

  1 ‘ Mother! What are you saying! ’ ’
Saul’s voice rose to a half-hysterical
shout.

  “Doctor Whittly was here yester-
day, at my request. You did not
know. I demanded his secrecy. He
told me what he told Henry. I have
cancer of the liver. Nothing can be
done. No one can save me but you, my
son.” She spoke with the grim con-
trol of her stern nature, but Saul read
the hopeless horror underneath.

  The little scientist threw his hands
over his head in a gesture of wild
despair.

  “And I am powerless! For three
years we have worked and slaved, and
nothing has rewarded us. Mother!
You—and Henry! My God, I’m go-
ing mad! I’ve got .to get out of
here!”

  He whirled and raced from the
room, out into the gathering dusk,
leaving behind him horror and pain
and sick despair. Straight as a hom-
ing pigeon flies he went to Helene.

  “Come to the hill,” he begged of
her, frigid in his terror of the thing
ahead.. “Come out to our little hill.
I’ve got to talk to you or I’ll go
mad!”

  Without a word of question she fol-
lowed him to the little birch-clad hill
between the laboratory and the little
town. And there he turned to her,
took her in his arms and hid his face
on her shoulder.

  “Helene,” he choked, shivering as
he put his horror into words,
“Mother and Henry Arn-”

  “I know,” the girl interrupted
him, gripping him with arms that,
would drive from him his soul-break-
ing desperation. “I know. Doctor
told me. Their salvation lies in you.
Saul, listen—listen, dear. You can’t
break now!”
118

  *	‘ I can’t go on! ” Saul’s voice rose,
and he lifted his head to stare into
her face through the deepening shad-
ows. “I don’t know which way to
turn. We’ve been working like mad
for three years to discover the ele-
ment that will kill that germ, and
we’ve failed. Failed miserably. We
may search on for three years more.
Helene, how long have Mother and
Am to live?”

  "Arn can have but a few months,
your mother at best a year,” Helene
answered, her voice bitter with regret.

 “A few months—a few months—a
year! Good God! ’ ’ Saul’s arms held
her convulsively, and his words were
harsh with his emotion. "And we
may work a dozen years, a lifetime—
and then not find it! There is some-
thing that will conquer that cancer
microbe! Somewhere in the world it
waits the man who can find it! But
only God knows what it is!”

 “Ah—there, you said it! Only
God knows! Haven’t you been for-
getting a bit about God?” Some-
thing in her tone struck deep, and the
frenzy that swirled in Saul’s racked
brain hushed to hear. “God knows.
And only God can help you now. I
tell you God guards his own, but God
does not will that they shall forget
Him. I told you once before that
man does all things through God,
Saul. And when men think they are
supreme, and that they can work the
world to their will without him, he
brings them to their knees. As he
has brought you. You can’t go one
step farther without the aid of God.
Saul, listen to me! You’ve got to
turn to God.”

  *	‘ I—yes, my own, yes. ’ ’ The scien-
tist nodded his head, his frenzy gone,
looking into her eyes with a strange
mixture of bewilderment and trust.
"I’m ready. Tell me what to do. I
guess I was forgetting about God. ’ ’

 “Most men forget about God”—
Helene’s lips quivered, then went still
—“till they are driven to the wall.

Down on your knees, beloved, here in
the grass. Lift your head, and pray.”

  She released herself from his arms
and dropped lithely to her knees,
pulling him down beside her, her face
uplifted. Saul gripped her hand with
both of his, raising his face to the
now dark and star-flecked sky, pray-
ing aloud a queer little stumbling
prayer.

 “God—are You there? Help me.
Can You hear? I—I don’t know how
to pray. A man drifts. I guess I’ve
drifted—away from You. Help me!
Send me some answer by which I may
know—give me the light. Help me
to save Henry—Mother—help me to
save the world! God—are You
there?”

  Silence, on the little hill. Silence,
singing, and a cool breeze blowing
down over two on their knees in the
grass, faces lifted to the eternal stars.
Helene’s voice, like a muted silver
bell.

 “He heard. I know—He heard.”

  In a solemn hush they went down
the little hill and parted.

  A lone Saul walked and waited till
the lights went out in the great
building where he worked and in the
adjoining house. And that night, in
the welter of writhing wo that
shrouded the laboratory, carrying his
faith and the memory of Helene’s
calm face, Saul Blauvette had a
dream.

  He dreamed that he stood on the
top of their little hill, with the birch
trees rising slimly around him and
the cool breeze blowing into his face.
Then suddenly ahead of him a great
devil-fish appeared, creeping down
from the sky, reaching and groping
with its long hideous arms. Stunned
with fear, sick to death of a weaken-
ing nausea, he could neither breathe
nor move a muscle to fight the thing,
but only stare at it and wait for the
horrible death that crawled upon him.
As it drew nearer he saw that it was
THE DARK CHRYSALIS

119

a mass of putrid stinking flesh, and as
the sinuous arms groped and writhed,
his mother and Henry Arn abruptly
appeared in its path. The ghastly
arms gripped and began to crush
them, and Saul, suddenly crazed into
action, began struggling and scream-
ing and beating at the terrible mass..

  His frantic efforts were of less ef-
fect than the puff of wind swirling
around his head, the horrible mass
choked him and his nostrils smothered
in the stench and fumes of its putre-
faction.

  Then a small snake, hardly a foot
long, came creeping over his feet,
through the wash of dew that covered
the grass, rattling its small tail men-
acingly. It reared its tiny head and
struck at the gigantic devil-fish. It
struck but once. Yet instantly the
monster quivered, loosed its hold on
its victims, shriveled up like a leaf in
flame and faded away.

  Saul Blauvette staggered back in
his dream, throwing up his arms with
a great cry, breathing gratefully the
clean air rid of the nauseous fumes.
And just ahead of him on a limb of
one of the slim birches he saw a dark
gray chrysalis. It burst open as he
gazed. A gorgeous butterfly crawled
out into the sunlight, tested its wings
and drank in the glow of a new day,
as the sun flamed in the sky and the
world was bathed with light. Then
the dream faded, and Saul woke with
a great start, sat up in his bed and
cried aloud to John Cloud.

 “John! John! Get up! Quick!
We have to get hold of some rattle-
snakes ! ’ ’

  Cloud leaped out of his bed where
he had been lying wide-eyed, came
running into the room and turned on
the light to stand staring at Saul with
startled eyes. Had the wonder-
seeker gone mad ? Saul saw the ques-
tion in his face, and answered it.

  “No, I’ve not gone mad. I’ve had
a dream! Listen.” And he went on
to explain rapidly the vision of the

devil-fish and the snake and the but-
tei'fly bursting out of the dark chrys-
alis into the light.

  “I wonder!” Cloud said, dazedly.
“I wonder!”

 “Don’t wonder!” Saul shouted,
leaping out of bed and catching at
his shoulders. “Mother and Henry
are dying. Don’t you realize that?
Don’t wonder! Get me some rattle-
snakes ! ”

 “But where will I get them?”
Cloud demanded, shaking himself
into coherent thought.

 “My God, I don’t know! Out in
Arizona, Wyoming—anywhere that
it’s hot, I guess. Hurry, man!
Hurry! ’ ’

  Cloud whirled and ran into his own
room, got into his clothes and rushed
into the garage where stood Saul’s
little-used powerful ear. A half-hour
later he was racing down the highway
toward the desert country three hun-
dred miles distant, where rattlesnakes
lived and multiplied. The great car
roared through the little town and
shot on, leaving waking wondering .
people behind it.

  In the town people looked at each
other and frowned. Spme rose and
went to their windows, to get a
glimpse of the big maroon car tearing
by in the moonlight. That crazy
scientist’s car! What, was he up to
now? For many months sentiment
had been rising in the town concern-
ing the laboratory. It was known
only as the isolated experimental lab-
oratory of the weird, erratic, queer-
looking little Saul Blauvette. Specu-
lation began to rise concerning what
grisly things might be going on in
that guarded, mysterious and silent
place. Sentiment in the town began
to frown at the great barnlike build-
ing, wholeheartedly wishing it away
from there, watching askance for
some tangible evidence of dark and
ugly deeds.

  The next day there passed secretly
from tongue to tongue the knowledge
120

WEIRD

of the passage of the great car roar-
ing through in the night. Where had
Blauvette gone? On what sudden
and imperative errand? Then some
saw Blauvette walking toward the
birch-clad hill with Helene Kinkaid,
and speculation rose higher. If it
were not Blauvette himself who had
raced away so summarily, then who?
And why?

  Saul had gone to seek Helene and
tell her of his dream. There on the
top of the hill they pieced it together,
and sought the answer to its riddle.

  “But there is no riddle, really,”
Helene said when Saul had finished
giving her the details of his vision.
“It is very clear. The rattlesnake
poison is the element you seek.”

  “Of course. I sent Cloud after
some snakes in the middle of the
night. ’ ’ Saul laid his hand over hers
where it pressed the deep grass. “And
the diminutive proportionate size of
the snake is significant that I shall
use the poison sparingly in my solu-
tion. The only other element clear in
the dream was the dew—water. The
world was wet with dew—and dew is
traditionally supposed to be pure. I
must distill the water. Distilled wa-
ter and rattlesnake poison. It sounds
wild, insane. But I know we’ve got
the answer. I even feel a sort of
calmness inside. All I’ve got to do is
wait till Cloud comes back, and we’re
on the home stretch.”

  “And here, in the morning of new
hope, must we thank God who sent
you the dream.” Helene’s face
raised to the light-washed sky—but
Saul bowed his head.

*	B 'hen for a week Saul paced the
laboratory restlessly, belying that
calmness he had felt for a moment in
his soul. Every waking hour length-
ened into an eternity as he waited
the return of John Cloud. Every few
moments he hurried into the house on
one pretext or another, to glance at
his mother’s face. He followed the

weakening, stricken Henry Am with
terrible eyes. Henry Am could now
with difficulty stay from his bed but a
few hours at a time. His nausea and
his gnawing pain had made of him
but a shell. And by the end of the
week of suspense Saul was a mad
ghost of himself, turning desperately
to Helene for strength when he felt
that he must know her steady poise
or break.

  Then John Cloud came back; came
with a box in the tonneau of the ear
that held seven huge rattlesnakes. He
rushed into the house, stared into
Henry Arn’s sallow pain-drawn
face and turned choking from Mrs.
Blauvette’s awful eyes to set down
the box before Saul. Inside of ten
minutes Saul had killed the seven
snakes and was cutting out their
poison sacs.

  There ensued one terrible frantic
month, in which Henry Am and Mrs.
Blauvette went steadily marching to-
ward the yawning doors of death,
while John Cloud and Saul worked
strange and fearful havoc with rat-
tlesnake poison and distilled water.
They took the hideous virulent stuff
and diluted it four-fifths. They put
a squirming mass of the devil-fish
microbes under the lens, while Henry
Am crept in and stood looking on
with staring, haggard eyes. Onto the
microbes they dropped the diluted
poison, and the microbes shriveled up
and died. They injected the solution
into a guinea-pig with three cancers.
Every microbe in the animal’s body
died, but the guinea-pig died also.

  And through that month, down in
the little adjoining town, rumor,
speculation and ugly suspicion, once
roused, grew and intensified against
the laboratory out in the trees.

  There was no one to tell of the
heroic nights and days through which
two tireless men worked frantically
on, eating little, sleeping less, madly
experimenting with ghoulish bugs
and deadly poison while two pain-
THE DARK CHRYSALIS

racked doomed watehed with staring
eyes. Helene and Whittly, hearing
breath of the rumor of dissatisfaction
and resentment against the labora-
tory, spoke of it with anxious hearts,
and held their tongues, knowing the
utter futility of anything they could
say.

  The laboratory became the housing
space for dozens of rattling, hissing
snakes. John Cloud had left orders
with an old prospector on the desert
to catch and ship him all the rattle-
snakes that he could ferret out of
rocks and holes. Those mysterious
boxes, arriving regularly, to spew
their deadly contents into the labo-
ratory, did their silent share in in-
creasing the sentiment daily rising in
the little town. The laboratory be-
came an abattoir, a madhouse.
Henry Arn and Mrs. Blauvette looked
on sick to the soul, afraid to hope,
while Helene and Whittly waited
apart in a numb, silent suspense.
Guinea-pigs died. Rats, mice and
rabbits died. Monkeys died—even as
the microbes died. Till the half-
crazed scientists had left but one
monkey, two rats, one tiny brown and
white guinea-pig and a few mice. All
the remaining animals bore rotting
hideous cancers on their bellies. And
the soul-weary men were no nearer
an effective solution than they had
been before.

  Then again the frantic little scien-
tist sought Helene Kinkaid, and again
they walked upon the hilltop and dis-
cussed the dream.

  "I’m almost at the end of my
tether.” Saul’s blue-ringed eyes and
haggard face were turned to the girl
as he spoke, and his body drooped
against her wearily as though it were
taking all his strength to keep his
feet. "I tell you, I’m about done.
What way is there to turn? And
every hour Mother and Henry Am
are dying.”

  "Sit down a moment and rest.”
Helene slipped to the grass and

pulled him down beside her. He
threw himself full-length in the grass
and laid his tired head in her lap.
She looked out across the trees into
the sky. "Was there no other ele-
ment in that dream? Dew—dew and
poison. And—Saul! The devil-fish
came crawling out of the sky, didn’t
he? Out of the air—ether!”
"Ether!” Saul leaped to his feet
with a wild shout, cursing his own
lack of divination, staring at her with
startled eyes. ‘ ‘ Ether! My God,
what a blind man I am! Of course.
We need ether!”

  He wheeled and raced down the
hill toward the laboratory, with only
a backward look, a shout, and a wave
of his arm, before he disappeared
running from her sight. Helene, un-
derstanding, smiled after him with
quivering lips, and her eyes were wet
as she turned to go down the other
side of the hill to tell Whittly of the
new idea and the rebirth of hope.

Saul burst into the laboratory with
a shout that brought Cloud run-
ning. “Ether! We need ether,
John. Bring me the ether!”

  Cloud whirled to a shelf across the
cluttered, stinking room, snatched
down an ether can and rushed across
the laboratory to place the can in
Saul’s shaking fingers. Then madly
they set to work again, while Arn and
Mrs. Blauvette, hearing the loud
cries, came stealing to the door to look
on like ghosts, and wonder.

  The last serum made, their five
hundred and tenth solution, had been
little short of seeming success. The
rat with cancer upon which they had
tried it had lived two days. In three
hours they had tested his flesh to find
the microbes dead and absorbed. The
cancerous growth had begun to
shrivel and dry up. The day he died
the flesh had begun to assume a
healthy tone around the edges of the
thick dry scab, and had started heal-
ing.
122

•

  To that solution Saul Blauvette
added his ether. He studied it out
minutely. The dew had covered the
earth, in his dream. The ether had
covered the earth. He must use equal
proportions of ether and distilled wa-
ter. The two scientists, with Arn and
the gaunt-eyed Mrs. Blauvette look-
ing on, held their breath and prayed
when the five hundred and eleventh
serum was injected into the leg of a
guinea-pig dying of cancer, whimper-
ing in his cage.

  But that guinea-pag did not die.
In two hours microscopic examina-
tion of his flesh showed that every
microbe was dead and absorbed. In
three hours more the cancerous
growths began to shrivel and dry.
Swiftly they degenerated into nothing
but a scab over the tender flesh. Then
Saul plucked the scab away to find
healthy firm tissue growing under-
neath. The guinea-pig scampered
about his cage, ate piggishly and be-
gan to grow fat. And when Saul
knew what he had done he stared at
his mother wildly, glanced once into
Henry Arn’s pain-racked eyes, and
fainted on the floor. John Cloud
picked him up, carried him into his
own room and went for old Doc
Whittly.

  His mother stood over him with a
ghastly face, her eyes glaring with
the insane light of fanatical hope,
like a woman in a dream, while Arn
exclaimed over what Saul had done.
Together those two doomed ones
waited like senseless statues by their
wonder-worker till Whittly and
Cloud came rushing in the door.
Whittly bent over him, felt his pulse
and raised to smile at Mrs.. Blau-
vette.

  "It is merely litter exhaustion.
Let him sleep. We’ll wait.” But he
thought of Helene. Helene, long
since asleep fitfully in her own room,
her mind following Saul every foot
of the way. And Whittly felt a grim

anger that she could not be here now
in this hour of triumph.

  They waited in an aching hush, the
four of them, while the hours passed
and the little scientist slept on.
Whittly ordered Cloud to lie down
and get some rest, but Cloud fought
his drooping lids and waited with
them. Henry Arn, unable to keep his
feet, had dropped into a chair, sleep-
ing fitfully, waking often to stare at
Saul with mad eyes. Saul slept for
eighteen hours, and when he woke it
was night again. His mother stood
by Whittly at the foot of his bed.
Cloud stood at his right hand, and
Henry Am dozed in a chair. Saul
sat up, stared at them and leaped out
upon the floor.

  "We’ve got it, Doc!” he shouted.
“We’ve got it. We’ve discovered the
formula that kills the microbe, with-
ers the cancer and lets the being
live! ’ ’

  “John told me.” Whittly held
Saul’s eyes with a steady gaze. “I
want you to give it immediately to
Henry Arn.”

  “Saul!” Henry shook himself
awake and staggered to his feet, be-
seeching the wonder-worker with
naked appeal. “Saul—I’m next!”

  “No!” Saul hurled the word at
him and took a step backward. “I
don’t dare try it on a human being
yet. Not till I’ve tested it on a few
more animals. That might have been
only a happy accident. Don’t ask
again! No, I tell you! No!”

  Arn drooped, glanced hopelessly at
Whittly, turned and dragged out of
the room. He knew too well the
strength of Saul Blauvette’s word. If
Saul said no, Saul meant no. The
others watched Arn go in stark si-
lence. It was like seeing a man walk
into the void of eternity. Then
Whittly turned to Saul with a harsh
reprimand.

  “Saul, don’t be a fool. He’s
doomed beyond all hope, anyway. He
hasn’t but a few days or weeks to live.
THE DARK CHRYSALIS

123

What better man for your last test
than the man who has worked with
you side by side ? ’ ’

  "No! I tell you, no!” Saul shouted
at him violently and started for the
door, to be met by the returning fig-
ure of Henry Arn. Saul stopped
short at the look on Arn’s face.

  The doomed man stood before them
as a soldier going into battle, his head
high, his eyes flaring with an exalted
light. Something about him sent a
hush over the room, and though his
voiice was little above a whisper it
rang through the room like a temple
gong.

  "I have taken it myself. You
wouldn’t give it to me; I know you
too well, Saul. So I have taken it
myself. It may be imagination, but
I think that already my deathly
nausea is lessening. Time will tell.
Time alone. I gave my life to this
cause, remember, not in the letter, but
in the deed.”

  Saul sank back on the edge of his
bed and buried his head in his hands.
No one moved, till Arn spoke again:
"Now I am going to bed, and sleep.
If I wake—in the morning-”

  "We’ll all be there,” Whittly an-
swered, and Cloud added a hoarse and
vehement amen to the promise, as Am
went again from their sight.

  They heard him go into his own
room. Then silence fell. Saul did
not move. None of them moved.
They knew Am had thrown himself
upon his blankets fully dressed. They
waited tensely for what seemed an
eternity, till Whittly stepped softly
across to Am’s room to find him
peacefully asleep. One by one the
others filed in and grouped them-
selves around his bed, Saul coming
last like a man drawn toward some
horror beyond his will. They waited,
asleep in their chairs, till dawn came
in the window to waken them. Whittly
moved, rose and stretched his tired
muscles, walked across to the bed and
felt Arn’s pulse. Arn stirred, opened

his eyes, smiled up at Whittly and
glanced around at the others sitting
suspense-racked in the cool dawn.

  "Yes—you’re all here, eh? I feel
like a new man, Doe. Nausea gone,
pain gone. A little weak. How’s
my pulse? Lord, it’s good to be free
of pain! Saul—you—you miracle-
worker! Do you know what it means
to be free of pain? And Doc—I’m
hungry. Can’t I have something to
eat?”

  "Why, yes—yes, I guess so.”
Whittly’s voice was husky, and he
turned to Mrs.. Blauvette, reading the
flaming hope in her eyes as he spoke.
"You might get him a soft poached
egg and a little milk, if you will?”

  Mrs. Blauvette moved out of the
room with more haste than Saul had
ever seen her show, and Arn closed
his eyes again, his drawn face relaxed
into the calm of rest and release from
pain. Silence fell once more. Si-
lences seemed a part of the great
barnlike laboratory and the adjoin-
ing house—tense silences, and shout-
ing frantic cries.

As Mrs. Blauvette came in again
noiselessly to give the food to
Arn, Whittly turned to Saul and
spoke: "We’d better go out now and
let the man sleep. He needs a lot. of
rest after all the pain and exhaustion
he has endured. He’ll have to come
baek slowly. But before I go I want
you to give 511 to—your mother.”

 “Mother!” Saul’s cry was
wrenched out of his throat, and his
cheek blanched as his gaze leaped to
her face. Involuntarily she straight-
ened, staring deep into his enormous
eyes, and in the tone of his cry and
the pallor of his features the gaunt
and silent woman read the love of her
son. ‘ ‘ Mother! I can’t! I’m afraid! ’ ’

  Whittly looked steadily into the lit-
tle scientist’s face, and read accu-
rately that fear. Rats and mice and
rabbits were one thing. And a
guinea-pig was only a guinea-pig.
124

Henry Arn had worked with him side
by side, had taken the matter of his
own life in his hands to prove or dis-
prove the efficacy of formula 511.
But this woman was his mother. The
woman who had given him of her
flesh and blood that he might walk
through the world and become a man.
The woman who had fed and clothed
him and believed in him when others
laughed and sneered. The woman
who would never fail him in the val-
ley of death nor the pits of hell, in
heaven or on earth. His mother. Her
blood in his veins, her substance in
his bones, her gift in his flesh. He
knew then how her mighty love had
grown in her grim silence and envel-
oped him and claimed him and made
him what he was. His mother.

  "I can’t. I can’t, I tell you!”
Saul sprang to his feet and backed
away, his hand held out as if to ward
off a blow. "I’m afraid!”

  “So is she!” Whittly’s harsh voice
cut in swiftly. ‘ ‘ She has been afraid
for twenty years. The whole world
is afraid. What of your dark chrys-
alis ? She can’t live another month if
you don’t do something for her.
You’ve got to work quickly. You’ve
proved your formula! Look at Arn! ’ ’

  Saul’s eyes leaped to Arn’s face,
and Arn looked back at him, sanely,
steadily, smiling his reassurance.

  “I know.” Saul’s gaze turned to
his mother, and his face was white
as chalk. “The solution works the
same on rat, monkey or mouse. It
should work the same on a human be-
ing. But I’m afraid!” He shook
his head, setting his teeth, and his
enormous eyes burned black in his
face. “I tell you I can’t do it! Not
yet! Wait a week to be sure that
Henry-”

  “And in a week your mother may
die!” Whittly’s voice was sharp; he
knew he was arguing against the pale
angel with the scythe, and he heard
the thud of clods on a grave.

  “She’ll not die by my hand!”

Saul’s voice rose, and he winced visi-
bly. “Mother! I’m afraid!”

  He swayed on his feet and his
mother walked up to him and placed
her hands on his shoulders, looking
down into his colorless face with her
terrible eyes. He quivered at her
touch. He stood like a man turned
to stone, as her voice broke upon his
ears in wild words. Strange words*
from her, the grim and silent woman,;

  ‘ ‘ Saul, you are too exhausted to use,
that magnificent brain. Reason, my
son! Reason! What if I should die
under the serum treatment ? It would
be a shorter, more merciful death. I
suffer! You can save me that, at
least. I ask you what Henry asked
you. Do you know what it means to
be free of pain ? But I shall not die.
I feel it—I know! You have life in
your two hands—life for me and for
the world. Are you going to let an
unreasonable, groundless fear con-
demn me to death before your eyes?
Saul—you have life. Give it to me! ”

  Saul stared at her, dumb, and
neither Whittly nor Arn moved. It
was as though in that gripping tense-
ness no one breathed. No one no-
ticed John Cloud as he swiftly and
silently passed from the room. He re-
turned almost instantly with a bottle
of 511 and a needle in his hands, to
find them as he had left them, trans-
fixed, a frozen tableau. Suddenly
Mrs. Blauvette moved in a quick flash
of frantic abandon to her own driving
fear, threw herself on her knees be-
fore her son and held up imploring
hands.

  ‘ ‘ Saul! I gave you life! You must
give life to me. Now—now while
there is time.”

  Saul continued to stare into her
face like a man hypnotized, and
Whittly ached for want of breath as
Cloud stepped silently across the room
to lay bottle and needle in Saul’s
hand. Slowly Said opened the bot-
tle, her eyes on him, holding him,
compelling him, begging, command-
THE DARK CHRYSALIS

125

ing, all the horror and fear of her life
plainly written on her face for him
to see.

  Then with one swift motion he filled
the needle, caught her upraised arm
and injected the serum into the tis-
sues. She winced slightly, bit her lip,
and threw her arms about his knees.
The first sob he had ever heard from
her throat shook her body as he bent
to raise her to her feet. Then behind
him he heard Whittly’s voice in a

startled, incredulously horror-shaken
tone. He wheeled, still gripping his
mother’s arm, to see Cloud and
Whittly staring fascinatedly at Am.

  Arn lay on his pillows, the food
half-eaten on the plate beside him.
His face was calm and smiling, and
his eyes gazed at them with a look
of infinite peace. But the look was
fixed and unmistakable, as was the
pallor of his face.

  Henry Arn was dea;d.

The Dragon Fang

By FITZ-JAMES O’BRIEN

CHAPTER 1

THE MIRACULOUS DRAGON
FANG

“^-sjOME, men and women, and
■ . little people of Tching-tou,
come and listen. The small
and ignoble person who annoys you
by his presence is the miserable con-
jurer known as Piou-lu. Everything
that can possibly be desired he can
give you;—charms to heal dissensions
in your noble and illustrious fami-
lies;—spells by which beautiful little
people without style may become
learned Bachelors, and reign high in
the palaces of literary composition;—
supernatural red pills, with which
you can cure your elegant and re-
nowned diseases;—wonderful incan-
tations, by which the assassins of any
member of your shining and virtuous

families can be discovered and made
to yield compensation, or be brought
under the just eye of the Brother of
the Sun. What is it that you want?
This mean little conjurer, who now
addresses you, can supply all your
charming and refreshing desires; for
he is known everywhere as Piou-lu,
the possessor of the ever-renowned
and miraculous Dragon Fang!”
There was a little, dry laugh, and
a murmur among the crowd of idlers
that surrounded the stage erected by
Piou-lu in front of the Hotel of the
Thirty-two Virtues. Fifth-class man-
darins looked at fourth-class manda-
rins and smiled, as much as to say,
"We who are educated men know
what to think of this fellow.” But
the fourth-class mandarins looked
haughtily at the fifth-class, as if they
had no business to smile at their
126

WEIRD TALES

superiors.. The crowd, however, com-
posed as it was principally of small
traders, barbers, porcelain-tinkers,
and country people, gazed with open
mouths upon the conjurer, who, clad
in a radiant garment of many colors,
strutted proudly up and down upon
his temporary stage.

  "What is a Dragon Fang, ingen-
ious and well-educated conjurer?” at
last inquired Wei-chang-tze, a sol-
emn-looking mandarin of the third
class, who was adorned with a sap-
phire button and a one-eyed pea-
cock’s feather. "What is a Dragon
Fang?”

  "Is it possible,” asked Piou-lu,
"that the wise and illustrious son of
virtue, the Mandarin Wei-chang-tze,
does not know what a Dragon Fang
is?” and the conjurer pricked up his
ears at the mandarin, as a hare at a
barking dog.	'

  "Of course, of course,” said
the Mandarin Wei-chang-tze, looking
rather ashamed of. his having be-
trayed such ignorance, "one does not
pass his examinations for nothing. I
merely wished that you should ex-
plain to those ignorant people here
what a Dragon Fang is; that was why
I asked.”

  "I thought that the Soul of Wis-
dom must have known,” said Piou-
lu, triumphantly, looking as if he be-
lieved firmly in the knowledge of
Wei-chang-tze. "The noble com-
mands of Wei-chang-tze shall be
obeyed. You all know,” said he,
looking round upon the people, “that
there are three great and powerful
Dragons inhabiting the universe.
Lung, or the Dragon of the Sky; Li,
or the Dragon of the Sea; and Kiau,
or the Dragon of the Marshes. All
these Dragons are wise, strong and
terrible. They are wondrously
formed, and can take any shape that
pleases them. Well, good people, a
great many moons ago, in the season
of spiked grain, I was following the
profession of a barber in the mean

and unmentionable town of Siho,
when one morning, as I was sitting

in my shop waiting for customers, I
heard a great noise of tam-tams, and
a princely palanquin stopped before
my door. I hastened, of course, to
observe the honorable rites toward
this newcomer, but before I could
reach the street a mandarin, splen-
didly attired, descended from the
palanquin. The ball on his cap was
of a stone and color that I had never
seen before, and three feathers of
some unknown bird hung down be-
hind his headdress. He held his hand
to his jaw, and walked into my house
with a lordly step. I was greatly
confused, for I knew not what rank
he was of, and felt puzzled how to
addrQss him. He put an end to my
embarrassment.

  " ‘I am in the house of Piou-lu,
the barber,’ he said, in a haughty
voice that sounded like the roll of a
copper drum amidst the hills.

  " ‘That disgraceful and ill-condi-
tioned person stands before you,’ I
replied, bowing as low as I could.

  “ ‘It is well,’ said he, seating him-
self in my operating-chair, while two
of his attendants fanned him. ‘Piou-
lu, I have the toothache!’

  “ ‘Does your lordship,’ said I,
‘wish that I should remove your
noble and illustrious pain?’

  “ ‘You must draw my tooth,’ said
he. ‘Wo to you if you draw the
wrong one!’

  “ ‘It, is too much honor,’ I replied;
‘but I will make my abominable and
ill-conducted instruments entice your
lordship’s beautiful tooth out, of your
high-born jaw with much rapidity.’
“So I got my big pincers, and my
opium-bottle, and opened the strange
mandarin’s mouth. Ah! it was then
that my low-born and despicable
heart descended into my bowels. I
should have dropped my pincers
from sheer fright if they had not
caught by their hooked ends in my
wide sleeve. The mandarin’s mouth
THE DRAGON PANG

127

was all on fire inside. As he breathed,
the flames rolled up and down his
throat, like the flames that gather on
the Yellow Grass Plains in the season
of Much Heat. His palate glowed
like red-hot copper, and his tongue
was like a brass stewpan that had
been on the salt-fire for thirty days.
But it was his teeth that affrighted
me most. They were a serpent’s
teeth. They were long, and curved
inward, and seemed to be made of
transparent crystal, in the center of
which small tongues of orange-
colored fire leaped up and down out
of some cavity in the gums.

  “ ‘Well, dilatory barber,’ said the
mandarin, in a horrible tone, while I
stood pale and trembling before him,
‘why don’t you draw my tooth?
Hasten, or I will have you sliced
lengthwise and fried in the sun.'

  " ‘0, my lord!’ said I, terrified at
this threat, ‘I fear that my vicious
and unendurable pincers are not
sufficiently strong. ’

  " ‘Slave!’ answered he in a voice
of thunder, ‘if you do not fulfil my
desires, you will not see another moon
rise.’

  ‘ ‘ I saw that I should be killed any-
way, so I might as well make the at-
tempt. I made a dart with my pin-
cers at the first tooth that came,
closed them firmly on the crystal
fang, and began to pull with all my
strength. The mandarin bellowed
like an ox of Tibet. The flames
rolled from his throat in such vol-
ume that I thought they would singe
my eyebrows. His two attendants
and his four palanquin-bearers put
their arms round my waist to help
me to pull, and there we tugged for
three or four minutes, until at last I
heard a report as loud as nine thou-
sand nine hundred and ninety-nine
firecrackers. The attendants, the
palanquin-bearers, and myself all fell
fiat on the floor, and the crystal fang
glittered between the jaws of the pin-
cers.

  "The mandarin was smiling pleas-
antly as I got up from the floor.
‘Piou-lu,’ said he, ‘you had a narrow
escape. You have removed my tooth-
ache, but had you failed, you would
have perished miserably; for I am the
Dragon Lung, who rules the sky and
the heavenly bodies, and I am as
powerful as I am wise. Take as a re-
ward the Dragon Fang which you
drew from my jaw. You will find it
a magical charm with which you can
work miracles. Honor your parents,
observe the rites, and live in peace.’

  “So saying, he breathed a whole
cloud of fire and smoke from his
throat, that filled my poor and des-
picable mansion. The light dazzled
and the smoke suffocated me, and
when I recovered my sight and breath
the Dragon Lung, the attendants, the
palanquin, and the four bearers had
all departed, how and whither I knew
not. Thus was it, elegant and re-
fined people of Tching-tou, that this
small and evil-minded person who
stands before you became possessed
of the wonderful Dragon Fang, with
which he can work miracles.”

This story, delivered as it was with
much graceful and dramatic
gesticulation, and a volubility that
seemed almost supernatural, had its
effect upon the crowd, and p, poor
little tailor, named Hang-pou, who
was known to be always in debt, was
heard to say that he wished he had
the Dragon Fang, wherewith to work
miracles with his creditors. But the
mandarins, blue, crystal, and gilt,
smiled contemptuously, and said to
themselves, “We who are learned
men know how to esteem these
things.”

  The Mandarin Wei-chang-tze, how-
ever, seemed to be of an inquiring
disposition, and evinced a desire to
continue his investigations.

  “Supremely visited conjurer,”
said he to Piou-lu, "your story is in-
deed wonderful. To have been visited
128

WEIRD TALES

by the Dragon Lung must have been
truly refreshing and enchanting.
Though not in the least doubting
your marvelous relation, I am sure
this virtuous assemblage would like
to see some proof of the miraculous
power of your Dragon Fang.”

  The crowd gave an immediate as-
sent to his sentiment by pressing
closer to the platform on which Piou-
lu strutted, and exclaiming with one
voice, ‘ ‘ The lofty mandarin says
wisely. We would like to behold.”

  Piou-lu did not seem in the slight-
est degree disconcerted. His narrow
black eyes glistened like the dark
edges of the seeds of the water-melon,
and he looked haughtily around him.

  "Is there any one of you who
would like to have a miracle per-
formed, and of what nature?” he
asked, with a triumphant wave of his
arms.

  ‘ ‘ I would like to see my debts
paid,” murmured the little tailor,
Hang-pou.

  "0 Hang-pou,” replied the con-
jurer, "this unworthy personage is
not going to pay your debts. Go
home and sit in your shop, and drink
no more rice-wine, and your debts
will be paid; for labor is the Dragon
Fang that works miracles for idle
tailors!”

  There - was a laugh through the
crowd at this sally, because Hang-
pou was well known to be fond of in-
toxicating drinks, and spent more of
his time in the street than on his
shop-board.

  "Would either of you like to be
changed into a camel?” continued
Piou-lu. "Say the word, and there
shall not be a finer beast in all
Tibet!”

  No one, however, seemed to be
particularly anxious to experience
this transformation. Perhaps it was
because it was warm weather, and
•amels bear heavy burdens.

  "I will change the whole honor-
able assemblage into turkey-buzzards,

if it only agrees, ’ ’ continued the con-
jurer ; “ or I will make the Lake Tung
come up into the town in the shape
of a water-melon, and then burst and
overflow everything. ’ ’

  "But we should all be drowned!”
exclaimed Hang-pou, who was cow-
ardly as well as intemperate.

  "That’s true,” said Piou-lu, “but
then you need not fear your cred-
itors,”—and he gave such a dart of
his long arm at the poor little tailor,
that the wretched man thought he
was going to claw him up and change
him into some frightful animal.

  “Well, since this illustrious as-
sembly will not have turkey-buzzards
or camels, this weak-minded, ill-
shapen personage must work a mir-
acle on himself,” said Piou-lu, de-
scending from his platform into the
street, and bringing with him a little
three-legged stool made of bamboo
rods.

  The crowd retreated as he ap-
proached, and even the solemn Wei-
chang-tze seemed rather afraid of this
miraculous conjurer. Piou-lu placed
the bamboo stool firmly on the
ground, and then mounted upon it.

  “Elegant and symmetrical bamboo
stool,” he said, lifting his arms, and
exhibiting something in his hand that
seemed like a piece of polished jade-
stone,—“elegant and symmetrical
bamboo stool, the justly despised
conjurer, named Piou-lu, entreats
that you will immediately grow tall,
in the name of the Dragon Lung! ’ ’

  Truly the stool began to grow, in
the presence of the astonished crowd.
The three legs of bamboo lengthened
and lengthened with great rapidity,
bearing Piou-lu high up into the air.
As he ascended he bowed gracefully
to the open-mouthed assembly.

  “It is delightful!” he cried; “the
air up here is so fresh! I smell the
tea winds from Fuh-kien. I can see
the spot where the heavens and the
earth cease to run parallel. I hear
the gongs of Pekin, and listen to the
THE DRAGON FANG

129

lowing of the herds of Tibet. Who
would not have an elegant bamboo
stool that knew how to grow ? ’ ’

  By this time Piou-lu had risen to
an enormous height. The legs of the
slender tripod on which he was
mounted seemed like silkworms’
threads, so thin were they compared
with their length. The crowd began
to tremble for Piou-lu.

  "Will he never stop?” said a
mandarin with a gilt ball, named Lin.

  "0, yes!” shouted Piou-lu from
the dizzy height of his bamboo stool.
"0, yes! this ugly little person will
immediately stop. Elegant stool, the
poor conjurer entreats you to stop
growing; but he also begs that you
will afford some satisfaction to this
beautifying assemblage down below,
who have honored you with their in-
spection.” .

  The bamboo stool, with the utmost
complaisance, ceased to lengthen out
its attenuated limbs, but on the mo-
ment experienced another change as
terrifying to the crowd. The three
legs began to approach each other
rapidly, and before the eye could
very well follow their motions had
blended mysteriously and inex-
plicably into one, the stool still re-
taining a miraculous equilibrium.
Immediately this single stem began
to thicken most marvelously, and in-
stead of the dark shining skin of a
bamboo stick, it seemed gradually to
be incased in overlapping rings of a
rough bark. Meanwhile a faint rust-
ling noise continued overhead, an(|
when the crowd, attracted by the
sound, looked up, instead of the flat
disk of eanework on which Piou-lu
had so wondrously ascended, they be-
held a cabbage-shaped mass of green,
which shot forth every moment long
pointed satiny leaves of the tenderest
green, and the most graceful shape
imaginable. But where was Piou-lu?
Some fancied that in the yellow
crown that topped the cabbage-
shaped bud of this strange tree they

could see the tip of his cap, and dis-
tinguish his black, roguish eyes, but
that may have been all fancy; and
they were quickly diverted from their
search for the conjurer by a shower
of red, pulpy fruits, that began to
fall with great rapidity from the
miraculous tree. Of course there was
a scramble, in which the mandarins
themselves did not disdain to join;
and the crimson fruits—the like of
which no one in Tching-tou had ever
seen before—proved delightfully
sweet and palatable to the taste.

  “That’s right! that’s right! per-
fectly bred and very polite people,”
cried a shrill voice while they were
all scrambling for the crimson fruits;
“pick fruit while it is fresh, and tea
while it is tender. For the sun wilts,
and the chills toughen, and the bluest
plum blooms only for a day.”

  Everybody looked up, and lo! there
was Piou-lu, as large as life, strutting
upon the stage, waving a large green
fan in his hand. While the crowd
was yet considering this wonderful
reappearance of the conjurer, there
was heard a very great outcry at the
end of the street, and a tall thin man
in a coarse blue gown came running
up at full speed.

  “Where are my plums, sons of
thieves?” he cried, almost breathless
with haste. “Alas! alas! I am com-
pletely ruined. My wife will perish
miserably for want of food, and my
sons will inherit nothing but empty
baskets at my death! Where are my
plums ? ’ ’

  “Who is it that dares to address
the virtuous and well-disposed people
of Tching-tou after this fashion?”
demanded the Mandarin Lin, in a
haughty voice, as he confronted the
newcomer.

  The poor man, seeing the gilt ball,
became immediately very humble,
and bowed several times to the man-
darin..

  “0, my lord!” said he; "I am an
incapable and undeserving plum-
130

WEIRD TALES

seller, named Liho. I was just now
sitting at my stall in a neighboring
street selling five cash worth of plums
to a customer, when suddenly all the
plums rose out of my baskets as if
Ihey had the wings of hawks, and flew
through the air over the tops of the
houses in this direction. Thinking
myself the sport of demons, I ran
after them, hoping to catch them,

and- Ah! there are my plums,”

he cried, suddenly interrupting him-
self and making a dart at some of the
crimson fruits that the tailor Hang
held in his hand, intending to carry
them home to his wife.

 “These your plums!” screamed
Hang, defending his treasure vigor-
ously. “Mole that you are, did you
ever see scarlet plums?”

  “This man is stricken by heaven,”
said Piou-lu, gravely. “He is a fool
who hides his plums and then thinks
that they fly away. Let someone shake
his gown.”

  A porcelain-cobbler who stood near
the fruiterer immediately seized the
long blue robe and gave it a lusty
pull, when, to the wonder of every-
body, thousands of the most beauti-
ful plums fell out, as from a tree
shaken by the winds of autumn. At
this moment a great gust of wind
arose in the street, and a pillar of
dust mounted up to the very top of
the strange tree, that still stood wav-
ing its long satiny leaves languidly
above the house-tops. For an instant
everyone was blinded, and when the
dust, had subsided so as to permit the
people to use their eyes again the
wonderful tree had completely van-
ished, and all that, could be seen was
a little bamboo stool flying along the
road, where it was blown by the
storm. The poor fruiterer, Liho,
stood aghast, looking at the plums, in
which he stood knee-deep.

 The mandarin, addressing him,
said sternly, “Let. us hear no more
such folly from Liho, otherwise he
will get twenty strokes of the stick.”

  “CTather your plums, Liho,” said
Piou-lu kindly, “and think this one
of your fortunate days; for he who
runs after his losses with open mouth
does not always overtake them.”

 And as the conjurer descended
from his platform it did not escape
the sharp eyes of the little tailor
Hang that Piou-lu exchanged a mys-
terious signal with the Mandarin
Wei-chang-tze.	I 7 .

 CHAPTER 2 ■■■, -
 THE SHADOW OF THE DUCK

It was close on nightfall when Piou-
lu stopped before Wei-chang-.
tze’s house. The lanterns were
already lit, and the porter dozed , in
a bamboo chair so soundly that PiOu-
lu entered the porch and passed the
screen without awaking him.. The
inner room was dimly lighted by
some horn lanterns elegantly painted
with hunting scenes; but despite the
obscurity the conjurer could discover
Wei-chang-tze seated at the farther
end of the apartment on an inclined
couch covered with blue and yellow
satin. Along the corridor that led to
the women’s apartments the shadows
lay thick; but Piou-lu fancied he
could hear the pattering of little feet
upon the matted floor, and see the
twinkle of curious eyes illuminating
the solemn darkness. Yet, after all,
he may have been mistaken, for the
corridor opened on a garden wealthy
in the rarest flowers, and he may
have conceived the silver dripping of
the fountain to be pattering of dainty
feet, and have mistaken the, moon-
light shining on the moist leaves of
the lotus for the sparkle of women’s
eyes.

  “Has Piou-lu arrived in my dwell-
ing?” asked Wei-chang-tze from the
dim corner in which he lay.

  “That ignoble and wrath-deserving
personage bows his head before you,”
answered Piou-lu, advancing and sa-
THE DRAGON FANG

131

luting the mandarin in accordance
with the laws of the Book of Rites.

  "I hope that you performed your
journey hither in great safety and
peace of mind,” said Wei-chang-tze,
gracefully motioning to the conjurer
to seat himself on a small blue sofa
that stood at a little distance.

  "When so mean an individual as
Piou-lu is honored by the request of
the noble Wei-chang-tze, good for-
tune must attend him. How could it
be otherwise?” replied Piou-lu, seat-
ing himself not on the small blue
sofa, but on the satin one which was
partly occupied by the mandarin
himself.

  "Piou-lu did not send in his name,
as the rites direct,” said Wei-chang-
tze, looking rather disgusted by this
impertinent freedom on the part of
the conjurer.

  "The elegant porter that adorns
the noble porch of Wei-chang-tze was
fast asleep,” answered Piou-lu, "and
Piou-lu knew that the great manda--
rin expected him with impatience.”

  "Yes,” said Wei-chang-tze; "I am
oppressed by a thousand demons;
devils sleep in my hair, and my ears
are overflowing with evil spirits; I
can not rest at night, and feel no
pleasure in the day. Therefore was
it that I wished to see you, in hopes
that you would, by amusing the de-
mon that inhabits my stomach, induce
him to depart.”

  "I will endeavor to delight the re-
spectable demon who lodges in your
stomach with my unworthy conjura-
tions,” replied Piou-lu. "But first I
must go into the garden to gather
flowers.”

  “Go,” said Wei-chang-tze. "The
moon shines, and you will see there
very many rare and beautiful plants
that are beloved by my daughter
Wu.”

  “The moonlight itself can not
shine brighter on the lilies than the
glances of your lordship’s daugh-

ter,” said the conjurer, bowing and
proceeding to the garden.

 Ah! what a garden it was that
Piou-lu now entered! The walls that
surrounded it were lofty, and built
of a rosy stone brought from the
mountains of Manchuria. This wall,
on whose inner face flowery designs
and triumphal processions were
sculptured at regular intervals, sus-
tained the long and richly laden
shoots of the white magnolia, which
spread its large snowy chalices in
myriads over the surface. Tamarisks
and palms sprang up in various
parts of the grounds, like dark
columns supporting the silvery sky;
while the tender and mournful wil-
low drooped its delicate limbs over
numberless fish-ponds, whose waters
seemed to repose peacefully in the
bosom of the emerald turf. The air
was distracted with innumerable per-
fumes, each more fragrant than the
other. The blue convolvulus, the
crimson ipomea, the prodigal azaleas,
the spotted tiger-lilies, the timid and
half-hidden jasmine, all poured forth,
during the day and night, streams of
perfume from the inexhaustible foun-
tains of their chalices. The heavy
odors of the tube-rose floated languid-
ly through the leaves, as a richly
plumaged bird would float through
summer air, borne down by his own
splendor. The blue lotus slept on the
smooth waves of the fish-ponds in
sublime repose. There seemed an
odor of enchantment over the entire
place. The flowers whispered their
secrets in the perfumed silence; the
inmost heart of every blossom was
unclosed at that mystic hour; all the
magic and mystery of plants floated
abroad, and the garden seemed filled
with the breath of a thousand spells.
But amidst the lilies and lotuses,
amidst the scented roses and the
drooping convolvuli, there moved a
flower fairer than all.

 “I am here,” whispered a low
voice, and a dusky figure came glid-
132

WEIRD TALES

ing toward Piou-lu, as he stood by
the fountain.

  "Ah!” said the conjurer, in a ten-
der tone, far different from the shrill
one in which he addressed the crowd
opposite the Hotel of the Thirty-two
Virtues. “The garden is now com-
plete. Wu, the Rose of Completed
Beauty, has blossomed on the night.”
“Let Piou-lu shelter her under his
mantle from the cold winds of eve-
ning, and bear her company for a
little while, for she has grown up
under a lonely wall,” said Wu, lay-
ing her little hand gently on the con-
jurer’s arm, and nestling up to his
side as a bird nestles into the fallen
leaves warmed by the sun.

  “She can lie there but a little
while, ’ ’ answered Piou-lu, folding the
mandarin’s daughter in a passionate
embrace, “for Wei-chang-tze awaits
the coming of Piou-lu impatiently, in
order to have a conjuration with a
devil that inhabits his stomach.”
“Alas!” said Wu, sadly; “why do
you not seek some other and more dis-
tinguished employment than that of
a conjurer? Why do you not seek
distinction in the Palace of Literary
Composition, and obtain a style?
Then we need not meet in secret, and
you might without fear demand my
hand from my father.”

  Piou-lu smiled, almost scornfully.
He seemed to gain an inch in stature,
and looked around him with an air
of command.

  “The marble from which the statue
is to be carved must lie in the quarry
until the workman finds it,” he an-
swered, “and the hour of my destiny
has not yet arrived.”

  “Well, we must wait, I suppose,”
said Wu, with a sigh. “Meantime,
Piou-lu, I love you.”

  “The hour will come sooner than
you think,” said Piou-lu, returning
her caress; “and now go, for the
mandarin waits.”

Wu glided away through the
gloom to her own apartment,
while the conjurer passed rapidly
through the garden and gathered the
blossoms of certain flowers as he
went. He seemed to linger with a
strange delight over the buds bathed
in the moonlight and the dew; their
perfume ascended into his nostrils
like incense, and he breathed it with
a voluptuous pleasure.

  “Now let the demon tremble in the
noble stomach of Wei-chang-tze,”
said Piou-lu, as he re-entered the hall
of reception laden With flowers.

‘ ‘ This ill-favored personage will
make such conjurations as shall de-
light the soul of the elegant and well-
born mandarin, and cause his illus-
ti’ious pei’seeutor to fly terrified.”

  Piou-lu then stripped off the petals
from many of the flowers, and
gathered them in a heap on the floor.
The mass of leaves were indeed varie-
gated. The red of the quamoclit, the
blue of the convolvulus, the tender,
pink of the camellia, the waxen white
of the magnolia, were all mingled to-
gether like the thousand hues in the
Scarfs of Felicity. Having built this
confused mass of petals in the shape
of a pyramid, Piou-lu unwound a
scarf from his waist and flung it over
the heap. He then drew the piece of
jade-stone from his pocket, and
said,—

  “This personage of outrageous
presence desires that what will be
may be shown to the lofty mandarin,
Wei-chang-tze.”

  As he pronounced these words, he
twitched the scarf away with a rapid
jerk, and lo! the flower-leaves were
gone, and in their place stood a beau-
tiful mandarin duck, in whose gor-
geous plumage one might trace the
brilliant hues of the flowers. Piou-lu
now approached the duck, caught it
up with one hand, while with the
other he drew a sharp knife from his
girdle and severed the bird’s head
from its body at a single stroke. To
THE DRAGON FANG

133

the great astonishment of Wei-chang-
tze, the body and dismembered head
of the bird vanished the moment the
knife had passed through the neck;
but at the same instant a duck, re-
sembling it in every respeet, escaped
from the eonjurer’s hands and flew
aeross the room. When I say that
this duck resembled the other in
every respect, I mean only in shape,
size and colors. For the rest, it was
no bodily duck. It was impalpable
and transparent, and even when it
flew it made no noise with its wings.

  "This is indeed wonderful!” said
Wei-ehang-tze. “Let the marvelous
conjurer explain.”

  "The duck formed out of flowers
was a duck pure in body and in spirit,
most lofty mandarin,” said Piou-lu,
"and when it died under the knife, I
ordered its soul to pass into its shad-
ow, whieh can never be killed. Henee
the shadow of the duck has all the
colors as well as the intelligence of
the real duck that gave it birth. ’ ’

  "And to what end has the very
wise Piou-lu created this beautiful
duek-shadow?” asked the mandarin.

  “The cultivated Wei-ehang-tze
shall immediately behold,” answered
the conjurer, drawing from his wide
sleeve a pieee of rock-salt and fling-
ing it to the farther end of the room.
He had hardly done this when a ter-
rific sound, between a bark and a
howl, issued from the dim comer into
which he had cast the rock-salt, and
immediately a large gray wolf issued
wonderfully from out of the twi-
light, and rushed with savage fangs
upon the shadow of the beautiful
duck.

  “Why, it is a wolf from the forest
of Manchuria!” exclaimed Wei-
chang-tze, rather alarmed at this
frightful apparition. "This is no
shadow, but a living and bloodthirsty
beast.”

  "Let my lord observe and have no
fear,” said Piou-lu, tranquilly.

  The wolf seemed rather confounded

when, on making a snap at the beau-
tiful duck, his sharp fangs met no
resistance, while the bird flew with
wonderful venom straight at his fiery
eyes. He growled, and snapped, and
tore with his claws at the agile shad-
ow that fluttered around and over
him, but all to no purpose. As well
might the hound leap at the reflection
of the deer in the pool where he
drinks. The shadow of the beautiful
duck seemed all the while to possess
some strange, deadly influence over
the savage wolf. His growls grew
fainter and fainter, and his red and
flaming eyes seemed to drop blood.
His limbs quivered all over, and the
rough hairs of his coat stood on end
with terror and pain—the shadow of
the beautiful duck never ceasing all
the time to fly straight at his eyes.

  “The wolf is dying!” exclaimed
Wei-ehang-tze.

  “He will die,—die like a dog,”
said Piou-lu, in a tone of savage tri-
umph.

  And presently, as he predicted, the
wolf gave two or three faint howls,
turned himself round in a circle as if
making a bed to sleep on, and then
lay down and died. The shadow of
the beautiful duck seemed now to be
radiant with glory. It shook its
bright wings, that were lovely and
transparent as a rainbow, and,
mounting on the dead body of the
wolf, sat in majesty upon his grim
and shaggy throne.

  “And what means this strange ex-
hibition, learned and wise conjurer?”
asked Wei-chang-tze, with a sorely
troubled air.

  “I will tell you,” said Piou-lu,
suddenly dropping his respectful and
ceremonious language, and lifting his
hand with an air of supreme power.
"The mandarin duek, elegant, faith-
ful, and courageous, is an emblem of
the dynasty of Ming, the true Chinese
race that ruled so splendidly in this
land before' the invaders usurped the
throne. The eowardly and savage
134

WEIRD TALES

wolf is a symbol of the Manchu Tar-
tar robbers who slew our liberties,
shaved our heads, and enchained our
people. The time has now arrived
when the duek has recovered its
splendor and its courage, and is going
to kill the wolf; for the wolf can not
bite it, as it works like a shadow in
the twilight and mystery of secret
association. This you know, Wei-
chang-tze, as well as I.”

  "I have indeed heard of a rebel
Chinese named Tien-te who has
raised a flame in our peaceful land,
and who, proclaiming himself a lineal
descendant of the dynasty of Ming,
seeks to dethrone our wise and heav-
enly sovereign, Hien-foung.”

  "Lie not to me, Wei-chang-tze, for
I know your inmost thoughts. Chinese
as you are, I know that you hate the
Tartar in your heart, but you are
afraid to say so for fear of losing
your head.”

  The mandarin was so stupefied at
this audacious address that he could
not reply, while the conjurer con-
tinued: "I come to make you an of-
fer. Join the forces of the heaven-
descended Emperor Tien-te. Join
with him in expelling this tyrannical
Tartar x*ace from the Central King-
dom, and driving them back again to
their cold hills and barren deserts.
Ply with me to the Imperial camp,
and bring with you your daughter
Wu, the Golden Heart of the Lily,
and I promise you the command of
one third of the Imperial forces, and
the Presidency of the College of Cere-
monies. ’ ’

  "And who are you, who dare to
ask of Wei-chang-tze to bestow on you
his nobly-born daughter?” said Wei-
chang-tze, starting in a rage from his
couch.

  "I!” replied Piou-lu, shaking his
conjurer’s gown from his shoulders
and displaying a splendid garment of
yellow satin, on the breast of which
was emblazoned the Imperial Dragon,
—"I am your Emperor, Tien-te!”

  “Ha!” screamed a shrill voice be-
hind him at this moment, “here he is.
The elegant and noble rebel for whose
head our worthy Emperor has offered
a reward of ten thousand silver taels.
Here he is. Catch! beautiful and
noble mandarins, catch him! and I
will pay my creditors with the head
money. ’ ’

  Piou-lu turned, and beheld the lit-
tle tailor Hang-pou, at whose back
were a whole file of soldiers and a
number of mandarins. Wei-chang-
tze shuddered, for in this compromise
of his character he knew that his
death was written if he fell into the
Imperial hands.

CHAPTER 3

“ALL IS OVER”

“Qtately and temperate tailor,”
^ said Piou-lu, calmly, “why do
you wish to arrest me?”

  “Ho! because I will get a reward,
and I want to pay my debts,” said
Hang-pou, grinning spitefully.

  “A reward for me, the miserable
and marrowless conjurer Piou-lu! 0,
elegant cutter of summer gowns, your
well-educated brains are not at
home! ’ ’

  “0, we know you well enough,
mighty conjurer. You are none
other than the contumacious rebel,
Tien-te, who dares to claim the throne
held by the wise and merciful Hien-
foung; and we will bear you to the
court of Pekin in chains, so that you
may wither in the light of his terrible
eyes.”

  “You think you will get a *reward
of ten thousand silver taels for my
head?” said Piou-lu.

  “Certainly,” replied the little
tailor, rubbing his hands with glee,—
“certainly. His Unmatched and Iso-
lated Majesty has promised it, and
the Brother of the Sun never lies.”
“Listen, inventive closer of sym-
metrical seams! Listen, and I will
tell you what will become of your ten
THE DRAGON FANG

135

thousand silver taels. There is a long
avenue leading to the imperial treas-
ury, and at every second step is an
open hand. When the ten thousand
taels are poured out, the first hand
grasps a half, the second hand an
eighth of the remaining half, the
third hand grasps a fourth of the
rest, and when the money-bags get
down a little lower, all the hands
grasp together; so that when the bags
reach the little tailor Hang-pou, who
stands stamping his feet very far
down indeed, they are entirely
empty; for Tartar robbers surround
the throne, and a Tartar usurper sits
upon it, and the great Chinese nation
toils in its rice-fields to gild their
palaces, and fill their seraglios, and
for all they give get neither justice
nor mercy. But I, Tien-te, the Heav-
enly Emperor of this Central Land,
will ordain it otherwise, and hurl the
false Dragon from his throne; for it
is written in the Book of Prognostics,
a copy of which was brought to me on
the wings of a yellow serpent, that
the dynasty of Han shall rule once
more, and the Tartar wolves perish
miserably out of the Land of Flow-
ers. ’ ’

  "This is treason against the Light
of the Universe, our most graeious
Emperor," said the Mandarin Lin.
“You shall have seventy times seven
pounds of cold iron put upon your
neck for these blasphemies, and I will
promise you that many bamboo splin-
ters shall be driven up under your
rebellious nails.”

  “Let our ears be no longer filled
with these atrocious utterances!”
cried Hang-pou. ‘ ‘ 0 brave and splen-
did mandarins, order your terrifying
tigers to arrest this depraved rebel,
in order that we may hasten with
him to Pekin. ’ ’

  “Before you throw the chains of
sorrow around my neck, O tailor of
celestial inspirations,” said Piou-lu,
with calm mockery,—“before the ter-
rible weight of your just hand falls

upon me, I pray you, if you would
oblige me, to look at that duck.” So
saying, Piou-lu pointed to where the
shadow of the duck was sitting on the
body of the wolf.

  “Oh, what a beautiful duck!”
cried Hang-pou, with glistening eyes,
and clapping his hands. “Let us try
and catch him! ’'

  “It is indeed a majestic duck,”
said Mandarin Lin, gravely stroking
his mustache. “I am favorable to
his capture.”

  “You will wait until we catch the
duck, illustrious rebel!” said Hang-
pou to Piou-lu, very innoccntly,
never turning his eyes from the duck,
to which they seemed to be glued by
some singular spell of attraction.

  “I will talk with the Mandarin
Wei-chang-tze while you put your
noble maneuvers into motion,” an-
swered Piou-lu.

  “Now, let us steal upon the duck,”
said Hang-pou. “0 handsomely-
formed duck, we entreat of you to
remain as quiet as possible, in order
that we may grasp you in our
hands. ’ *

  Then, as if actuated by a single
impulse, the entire crowd, with the
exception of Wei-chang-tze and Piou-
lu, moved toward the duck. The
mandarins stepped on tiptoe, with
bent bodies, and little black eyes
glistening with eagerness; Hang-pou
crawled on his belly like a serpent;
and the soldiers, casting aside their
bows and shields, crept, with their
hands upon their sides, toward the
beautiful bird. The duck remained
perfectly quiet, its variegated wings
shining like painted talc, and its neck
lustrous as the court robe of a first-
class mandarin. The crowd scarcely
breathed, so intense was their eager-
ness to capture the duck: and they
moved slowly forward, gradually sur-
rounding it.

  Hang-pou was the first to make a
clutch at the bird, but he was very
much astonished to find his hand
136

WEIRD TALES

closing on empty air, while the duck
remained seated on the wolf, as still
as a picture.

  “Miserable tailor!” cried Manda-
rin Lin; “your hand is a sieve, with
meshes wide enough to strain el-
ephants. How can you catch the
beautiful duck? Behold me!” and
Mandarin Lin made a rapid and well-
calculated dive at the duck. To
the wonderment of everyone except
Piou-lu and Wei-chang-tze, the duck
seemed to ooze through his fingers,
and, escaping, flew away to the other
end of the room.

 "If my hand is a sieve,” said
Hang-pou, "it is evident that the
noble mandarin’s hand is not a wall
of beaten copper, for it lets ducks
fly through with wonderful ease.”
"It is a depraved and abominable
duck, of criminal parentage,” said
Mandarin Lin, in a terrible rage;
"and I vow, by the whiskers of the
Dragon, that I will catch it and burn
it on a spit.”

  "0, yes!” cried the entire crowd,
—mandarins, soldiers, and the little
tailor,—all now attracted to the chase
of the duck by a power that they
could no longer resist. "O, yes! we
will most, assuredly capture this little
duck, and, depriving him of his
feathers, punish him on a spit that is
exceedingly hot.”

 So the chase commenced. Here
and there, from one corner to the
other, up the walls, on the altar of
die household gods,—in short, in
every portion of the large room, did
Ihe mandarins, the little tailor, and
the soldiers pursue the shadow of the
beautiful duck. Never was seen such
a duck. It seemed to be in twenty
places at a lime. One moment Man-
darin Lin would throw himself bodily
on the bird, in hopes of crushing it,
;>nd would call out triumphantly that
now indeed he had the duck; but the
words would be hardly out, of his
mouth. when a. loud shout from the
rest of the party would disabuse his

mind, and, turning, he would behold
the duck marching proudly down the
center of the floor. Another time a
soldier would declare that he had the
duck in his breeches pocket; but
while his neighbors were carefully
probing that recess the duck would
be seen calmly emerging from' his
right-hand sleeve. One time Hang-
pou sat down suddenly on the mouth
of a large china jar, and resolutely
refused to stir, declaring that he had
seen the duck enter the jar, and that
he was determined to sit upon the
mouth until the demon of a duck was
starved to death. But even while
uttering his heroic determination, his
mouth.was seen to open,.very, wide,
and, to the astonishment of all, the
duck flew out. In ani .jnstant. the
whole crowd was after .him again;
Mandarin Hy-le tumbled over Man-
darin Ching-tze, and Mandarin Lin
nearly drove his head through Hang-
pou’s stomach.

The unhappy wretches began now
to perspire and grow faint with
fatigue, but the longer the chase went
on the hotter it grew. There was no
rest for any of them. From corner
to corner, from side to side,—now in
one direction, now in another,—no
matter whither the duck flew, they
were compelled to follow. Their faces
streamed, and their legs seemed ready
to sink upon them. Their eyeballs
were ready to start out of their heads,
and they had the air of government
couriers who had traveled five hun-
dred li in eleven days. They were
nearly dead.

  "Those men will surely perish,
illustrious claimant of the throne,”
said Wei-chang-tze, gazing with
astonishment at this mad chase.

  "Let them perish!” said the con-
jurer; “so will perish all the enemies
of the Celestial sovereign, Tien-te.
Wei-chang-tze, once more, do you
accept my offer? If yon remain here,
THE DRAGON FANG

137

you will be sent to Pekin in chains;
if you come with me, I will gird your
waist with the scarf of Perpetual De-
light. We want wise men like you to

guide our armies, and-”

  "And the illustrious Tien-te loves
the mandarin’s daughter,” said Wei-
chang-tze, roguishly finishing the
sentence. “Light of the Universe
and Son of Heaven, Wei-chang-tze is
your slave! ’ ’

  Piou-lu—for I still call him by his
conjurer’s name—gave a low whistle,
and, obedient to the summons, Wu’s
delicate shape came gliding from the
corridor toward her lover, with the
dainty step of a young fawn going to
the fountain.

  "Wu,” said Piou-lu, "the marble
is carved, and the hour is come.”
"My father, then, has consented?”
said Wu, looking timidly at her
father.

  "When the Emperor of the Cen-
tral Land condescends to woo, what
father dare refuse?” said Wei-chang-
tze.

  "Emperor!” said Wu, opening her
black eyes with wonder. "My Piou-
lu an Emperor! ’ ’

  "I am indeed the son of the Drag-
on,” said Piou-lu, folding her to his
breast, "and you shall sit upon a
throne of ivory and gold.”

  "And I thought you were only a
conjurer!” murmured Wu, hiding
her head in his yellow gown.

  “But how are we to leave this
place?” asked Wei-chang-tze, looking
alarmed. “The guard will seize us if
they get knowledge of your pres-
ence. ’ ’

  “We shall be at my castle in the

mountains of Tse-Hing, near the
Kouei-Lin, in less than a minute,”
answered Piou-lu; “for to the pos-
sessor of the Dragon Fang all things
are possible. ’ ’

  Even as he spoke the ground began
to slide from under their feet with
wonderful rapidity, leaving them mo-
tionless and upright. Houses, walls,
gardens, fields, all passed by them
with the swiftness of a dream until,
in a few seconds, they found them-
selves in the mountain castle of Tien-
te, where they were welcomed with a
splendid hospitality. Wu became the
favorite wife of the adventurous Em-
peror, and Wei-chang-tze one of his
most famous generals.

  The day after these events some
Tartar soldiers entered Wei-chang-
tze’s house to search for the manda-
rin, when, in the receptiou-hall, they
were confounded at finding a number
of men lying dead upon the floor,
while in the midst sat a beautiful
duck, that immediately on their
entrance flew out through a window,
and was seen no more. The dead
men were soon recognized, and it was
the opinion of the people of Tching-
tou that Wei-chang-tze had poisoned
all the soldiers and mandarins, and
then fled. The tailor, Hang-pou, be-
ing among the corpses, was found to
have given his creditors the slip for-
ever.

  Victory still sits on the banner of*
Tien-te, and he will, without doubt,
by the time that the tea is again fit
to gather, sit upon the ancient throne
of his ancestors.

  Everything is now gracefully con-
cluded.
 IF ONE were asked to name the author whose genius made the weird tale
 popular, the instant answer would be Edgar Allan Poe. We owe not
 only the weird tale to Poe, but we are also indebted to him for the word
 itself. Poe was not the creator of the word ‘ ‘ weird, ’ ’ but he rescued it from
 oblivion and made it popular, so that now the word is understood and used
 by everyone.

     Lafcadio Hearn, in his chapter on Poe’s verse, thus describes how Poe
 picked up this almost forgotten word and restored it to the language: "When
 you read in Idyls of the King such phrases as ‘the weirdly sculptured gate,’
 perhaps you have never suspected that the use of the adverb ‘weirdly’ was
 derived from the study of the American poet. There were two words used by
 the Saxons of a very powerful kind, one referring to destiny or fate, the other
 to supernatural terror. ‘Weird’ is another form of the Anglo-Saxon word
 meaning fate. The northern mythology, like the Greek, had its fates who
 devised the life histories of men. Later the word came also to be used in
 relation to the future of the man himself; the ancient writers spoke of ‘his
 weird,’ ‘her weird.’ Still later the term came to mean simply supernatural
 influence of a mysterious kind. Poe found it so used and made it into a
 living adjective after it had become almost forgotten by using it very cleverly
 in his poems and stories. As he used it, it means ghostly or ghostly-looking,
 or suggesting the supernatural and occult. Hundreds of writers imitated

*	Poe in this respect and now it is so much the rule that the word must be
 used very sparingly. It is the mark of a very young writer to use it often. ’ ’
 "Weird Tales is getting better all the time,” writes A. Leslie, whose
 verse has been a feature of this magazine. “I am particularly interested in
 Ray Cummings’ new story; he is an old favorite of mine, and he appears
 to be surpassing himself this time.”

      Ralph Raeburn Phillips, of the Order of the Star in the East, writes to
 the Eyrie from Portland, Oregon: “Up till now I have been a silent but
 appreciative reader of Weird Tales, but now I must let you know that here
 is another constant reader and strong supporter of your incomparable mag-
 azine. You are doing a good work; keep it up. We of the great brotherhood
 who love the mystical, occult, etc., could not get along without our Weird
 Tales. Give us more good old ghost-stories. Your contributors are splendid.
 I especially like Greye La Spina and H. P. Lovecraft.”

     Writes S. V. Toomey, of East Orange, New Jersey: "I have been reading
 Weird Tales for three years and as yet have no fault to find. I thought
 138
THE EYRIE

139

your magazine the most interesting of ,any until you put in the reprint,
stories; now I know it is the most interesting. Cummings’ latest, Explorers
Into Infinity, has proved a masterpiece so far, but don’t you think the install-
ments too short?”

    "I am a new reader of Weird Tales, and want to congratulate you on
the publication of such a splendid magazine,” writes E. E. M., of Birming-
ham, Alabama, in a letter to the Eyrie. "I don’t like tales of supernatural
horror but I do like those of imaginative science and pseudo-science, such as
Explorers Into Infinity. Weird Tales is the best magazine of its kind in
print.”

     "The ‘snowbird’ story by Carr in the May issue, i. e., Phantom Fingers,
is a real corncracker and gets my vote by a jugful, ’ ’ writes the Rev. Henry S.
Whitehead from Oswego, New York.

    "Each month Weird Tales is improved in some distinct manner,” writes
Jack Snow, of Dayton, Ohio. “Perhaps it contains some mighty story or it
may be composed of a group of excellent tales, but it never fails to bear the
mark of progress. Please do not even consider discontinuing your reprints.
Weird Tales can find sufficient worthy material from the great library of
the past for one reprint story a month. I am taking this opportunity to thank
you for the March issue of Weird Tales which contained Lovecraft’s The
White Ship. It was a beautiful, exquisite little story, as remotely unreal and
Lovecraftean in character as his terror-striking masterpiece, The Outsider.
I wonder how many of your readers truly appreciate beauty of this sort.
Certainly your publishing material like this raises the magazine many points
as an artistic and worthwhile journal. Windows of Destiny, by James B.
M. Clark, Jr., in the April issue, is a really remarkable story. It is the first
story of its kind I have found in Weird Tales, and it is delightful. At times
this tale approaches the fairy-story and it is always an allegory, but the
author tells it with prosaic naturalness.”

    Sanford Aronow, of Toms River, New Jersey, writes to the Eyrie: "I
have been a .constant reader of your magazine for three years, and I like it
better than any other magazine. There were many excellent stories in the
May issue. It seems that every time you print the magazine it gets better. I
picked Explorers Into Infinity first, The Master of Doom for second, and
The Veiled Prophetess third. I like Ray Cummings’ story tremendously.”

    Private Howard A. McElroy writes from the Presidio in San Francisco:
"Here is how I became a member of the great order of Weird Tales readers:
I was cleaning up the office one night and as I was about to empty the
wastebasket I saw a copy of the August, 1926, Weird Tales and took it and
thought: ‘Here is something new.’ Well, I read that copy from back to back.
It is entirely different from anything I ever read, and I have read thousands
of magazines. My two favorite stories in the May issue are The Master of
Doom by Donald Edward Keyhoe and In Kashla’s Garden by Oscar Schisgall.
They are weirdly beautiful.”

    Here is a real knock, from Mrs. R. Snyder of Reading, Pennsylvania:
"Dear Sirs: I have been reading weird tales for years I have a habit of
saying what I think right out so dont get cross at what I write to you. But
you want to snap out of it. you are loseing your trade you print some
stories that is not interesting’ you have so many abut destroying the earth
and killing all the peopel that’s not interesting at all beside’s your stories

us more ghost stories you would be o. k. what is better than to read a
creepy ghost storie at night give us more of Seabury Quinn and Greye la
Spina allso Maria Moravsky espesly Seabury Quinn.”

    C. T. Byrd, of Des Moines, Iowa, writes: “I suggest that you print from
old books of magic a chapter or two in each issue in place of the reprint
stories. It would also be a good plan, I think, to have a department in which
the readers can write their own experiences in the land of the occult and
weird.”

    “I can not say enough for Weird Tales,” writes Miss Laura Johnson,
of Cincinnati. “I have just recently begun to read the magazine, and I
have never, in all my reading of books and magazines, come upon one that
I admired so immensely.”

    "The three best stories ever published which I have read,” writes Fred
W. Fischer, Jr., of Knoxville, Tennessee, "were these ever-to-be-remembered -
with-pleasure stories from Weird Tales: 1, When the Green Star Waned, by
Nictzin Dyalhis; 2, Invaders from Outside, by J. Schlossel; 3, A Runaway
World, by Clare Winger Harris. By the way—about a year ago you forecast
a tale entitled Other Worlds, by Will Smith. Why has it never been men-
tioned since? Will it ever be published?” [Editor’s note: Yes, it will.,]

"Revenge!” I cried, and the Hell-
hound sprang.

  Straight for the Master’s throat he
leapt, but seized instead the arm that
was flung across it. I heard a dull
crack, and I knew the bone was
broken. He staggered with the blow,
groaned, and sank to his knees.

  The beast shifted his hold and
grappled for the throat again. This
time he succeeded, but I could see
that the fangs did not penetrate the
skin. He toyed with the Vampire as
a cat with a mouse. With one great
paw on the Master’s chest he held
him flat, and snarled in his face.

  Tasting to the full a revenge that
had burned hot for many years, he
delayed the deatn-stroke too long. A
new factor was introduced into the
struggle. •

  Pierre, the hulking mass of brain-
less muscle, lunged forward, clutch-
ing the beast by the loins, although
the creature snapped fiercely at his
arms. With blood pouring down his
sides from his wounds he began to
raise the Hungarian above his head,
slowly as moves a ponderous machine.

  Under the will of the Master the
corpse was energized with movement,
and was operating as directed by the
Vampire.

  Into my brain poured commands,
and I knew they issued from the in-
visible company. Many voices, but
qll urged, “Hurl the lamp! They
can not pass the flame!”

  “But Brenryk?” I thought.

  “He will not be harmed,” they an-
swered. ‘ ‘ He lives in this shape only
by our wish.”

  “And Pierre?” I queried silently.
  “He is dead,” was the reply,

Bride of Osiris

By OTIS ADELBERT KLINE

 \ n Egyptian story of the pres-
 ent day, set- in the strange
 subterranean city of Karneter, un-
 derneath Chicago, where Mez-
 zar Hashin rules his subjects in
 true Egyptian pomp and splendor,
 with all the rites and ceremonies
 of the ancient Egyptian religion:
 A three-part serial story by the
 author of "The Cup of Blood”
 and "The Thing of a Thousand
 Shapes.”

 Startling kidnapings and
 strange murders make this
 fast-moving story replete with ex-
 citement. It is a fantastic and
 fascinating tale of Osiris, the Fes-
 tival of Re, giant negro guards,
 mystic rites, the Am-mits, weird
 and thrilling adventures, and the
 desolate dungeons of Karneter.

(Continued from page 34)

disabled launch to port, and during
that time Tom Mansey recovered
from a siege of sub-consciousness and
fever in which he raved and fought
a nightmare jungle peopled with gray
ghouls. And when some time later he
made a report to the authorities, it
contained prophecy and prediction.

   "It is fairly well established that
wherever the white man goes, it
means elimination of the savage, not
by slaughter, of course. We have
subtler ways. And the higher type
of skill and brains you send in, the
quicker you set the death-dealing
forces to work among the natives.
Compared with one courageous,
brainy white man, cobras, crocodiles,
tigers, any of the jungle terrors are
simple and innocuous. I know. As
regards moneyed idiots who were pro-
moting head barter, fine them enough
and jail them. Cut off the demand
and you kill the supply.”

  They rewarded Mansey rather well
for that investigation, although r
the launch bottom the Tonga boy .4
gathered a king’s ransom in pearls
from strands which broke as Mullet
struggled to escape death. They were
rather honest Tonga* boys and only
thieved half of the pearls to divide
among themselves, but Mansey is
barrassed. Pearls belong to
throats of pretty women, but those
pearls held memories too horrid to
give to a nice girl, so he is waiting to
trade them to curio-hunters disap-
pointed at lack of mummied human
heads.

“The Devils of Po Sung” another
  powerful weird story of the
  South Seas by Bassett Morgan,
  a tale of creeping horror, will

 to rise.

  "Now!” they shrieked, and I
threw the lamp.

mission finished. His last look was
one of gratitude to me.

  Then the walls began to crumble.
Pierre went down, struck by a fall-
ing beam, and the scene was blotted
out in a whirling veil of sparks.

  As I dragged myself and Regina to
safety I saw that it was gray dawn,
and people were running from the
village to stare open-mouthed at the
sudden flames. And I knew no more.

ISit in my chair and read the words
I have just written. It seems a
dream that I shudder out of, but all
is well now.

  We explained to the people that,
passing by the haunted inn, I saw the
girl in the grasp of a tramp, that I
fought to rescue her, and in the
scuffle upset a lamp. Some, I think,
believed the story, but I saw others
furtively cross themselves, and all
were glad to see us go.

  Part of the story I revealed to the
village priest, under pledge of se-
crecy. He pronounced anathema
upon the ruins, but I doubt that it
was of much value. I place more
faith in the whining wind that rose
and scattered those ashes far and
wide. It will be a powerful magic
that brings together that dread
world-wanderer again.

 Regina I brought with me to
America.. From this time my life is
hers, as my wealth shall be when I am
gone.

  Here I shall dwell in this pleasant
New England town, and I rove no
more.

  Happier times are in prospect for
the unhappy girl. Even on board
ship I noticed that the haggard face
was losing its wrinkles and careworn
look. Good food and rest are bring-
ing back the roses to her cheeks. She
is young and youth is elastic.

  The future? Who can tell? But
there is a lad across the way, with a
most engaging smile!

FOR THOSE WHO KNOW

 OLD MONEY!

Mrs. Sam Dowty of

sold B. Max Mehl
one-half dollar for
$400.00.

I PAID $200.00

        to J. D. Martin, of Virginia,
        for Just One Copper Cent

     "Please accept my thanks for your check for $200.00
     in payment for the copper cent I sent you. I appre-
     ciate the interest you have given this transaction.

    It's a	to do business with a firm that handles

 This is but one of the many similar letters we are con-
 stantly receiving. Post yourself! It pays! We paid
 Mr. Manning, New York, $2,500.00 for a single silver
 dollar. Mrs. G. F. Adams, Ohio, received $740.00 for
 some old coins. We paid W. F. Wilharm, of Pennsyl-
 vania, $13,500.00 for his rare coins. I paid J. T. Ne-
 ville, of North Dakota, $200.00 for a $10 bill he picked
 up in circulation. Mr. Mehl paid $1,000.00 to Mr. J. E.
 Brownlee, of Heardmont, Ga., for one old coin. Mr.
 Brownlee, in his letter to Mr. Mehl, says: "Your letter
 received with the check for $1,000.00 enclosed. I like
 to deal with such men as you and hope you continue
 buying coins for a long time.” In the last thirty years
 ive have paid hundreds of others handsome premiums
 for old bills and coins.

All Kinds of Old Coins, Medals,

Bills and Stamps Wanted

 J1.00 to $1,000 paid for certain old cents, nickels, dimes,

 There are single pennies that sell for $100.00.
 There are nickels worth many dollars—dimes,

 fortune is offered by collectors for rare coins
 and stamps for their collections. The prices
 paid are amazing.

   It Pays to Post Yourself on the Big
