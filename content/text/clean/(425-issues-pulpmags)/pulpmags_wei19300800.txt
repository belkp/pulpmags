 OU’LL NEVER KNOW LIFE

Until You've Read the Greatest
of All Forbidden Books!

YOU'LL ntver know the tremendous force of human
passions until you’ve feasted on the most thrilling
Tales from that greatest of all true-to-life books the
immortal Decameron! . . . Here art* the frankest tales
of love and intrigue ever set down on paper. Written in
an age of plain speaking they show us how real fiesh-and-
blood men and women act in time of stress—the deep
secret motives that influence our actions today no less
than they did centuries ago.

  And now for a short time only you can inspect these
great examples of realistic writing—the stories which you
have always longed to read—in your own home for^ five
days, without obligation! Read all about this surprising
offer, then send for your copy at once.

AMAZING .... INSPIRING

  For centuries the Decameron has thrilled millions—has
inspired countless great authors—has been lauded by the
most discriminating critics. Rich in fascinating plots,
vibrant with all the passions of a warm-blooded race, it
has furnished plots for the world's great masters of liter-
ature- Shakespeare. Chaucer, Keats. Tennyson. Dryden
and Longfellow. No one can know literature, can call
himself truly sophisticated, until he has drunk from the
bottomless loving cup of that genial old Italian. Giovanni
Boccaccio. . . . And far from being immoral as many
narrow minded people used to think, these Tales from the
Decameron are in reality almost a text book for the
earnest student of that greatest of all studies—human
nature.

  Boccaccio’s stories have already lived five times as long
as our United States. They were the "best sellers” when
Broadway was still a wilderness -and yet today they still
delight us with their immortal vitality, forever young,
forever gay, forever thrilling.

  The morals and customs of Italy of the fourteenth cen-
tury are all laid before you the way people lived, the
hovels and palaces they dwelt in. the strange pleasures
they indulged in—all are told with a wit and pathos that
never crept between the covers of any other book. Thus
the stories not only amuse and entertain, which after all
is the first requirement of good fiction, but they give us

the history of manners and morals of a long passed age.
They constitute a landmark of literature, which must not
be passed over, if you would broaden your vision—make
yourself truly cultured.

A GRATIFYING letter from Henry S. Whitehead, author of the Jumbee
stories, hiay prove of interest to our readers. "It pleases me,” writes
Doctor Whitehead, "from both writer's and reader’s viewpoints, to see
how you have brought the magazine up. Its conception as a medium for the
occult filled a vast need both for writers and readers. So important does this
existence of a medium for the publication of occult and similarly weird stories
appear to me that in 1927 I did an article entitled The Occult Story for The
Free-Lance Writer’s Annual. In that article, which is today regarded as the
standard statement on the subject, and along with John Farrar, A. Hamilton
Gibbs, John Gallishaw, Mary Roberts Rinehart, Burges Johnson, Augustus
Thomas, Henry Seidel Canby, John Bakeless, Robert E. Sherwood, Ivy L. Lee.
Ben Ames Williams, Coningsby Dawson and other contributors (for it was the
editor’s desire to cover the whole field of fiction writing), I took occasion to
mention Weird Tales as the sole medium for the occult story in the United
States.

  "To one particularized point all this comment of mine (intended to be read
by professional writers) was directed; viz: that editors in general, editors of
magazines, that is, would not touch the occult story with a ten-foot pole! This
need of both authors desiring to write in this medium and readers wishful of
reading their output, has been met by Weird Tales, and, I am tempted to add.
in the current argot of the flappers—'and how!*

  "It is on this 'how’ that I offer congratulations. When you took over the
magazine its front office was overloaded, as I happen to know, with material
purchased by the former proprietors, not all of it up to the standard you have
set by careful discrimination, wise and gradual improvement, and a steady pull
toward perfection. Professional writers (as witness Elliott O’Donnell’s forth-
coming tale, and E. F. Benson’s James Lamp in the current issue) are 'coming
back’ in Weird Tales. This, from my viewpoint, is one of the most encour-
aging signs for the future of Weird Tales. The magazine is far beyond (and
above) the pulp-paper 'news stand’ class which litters die wastebaskets and junk-

heaps of our beloved, reading-crazy land! It is a real accomplishment on your
part.

  "Your writers in the Eyrie comment twice on my own work in the magazine
in the June issue. I beg to thank both approving readers herewith. But it is
of greater interest, perhaps, to comment on that work by saying that I feel my
stories have, in the past, been handicapped by their very authenticity! The
Whitehead Jumbee stories are written with as much'care for that same authen-
ticity as though they were being composed for a posterity of classical commenta-
tors as numerous and one-minded as Edgar Allan Poe’s! They run through the
veritable gamut of the beliefs and practises of the Caribbean peoples, and there
has never been a single point about them which is not 'authentic,’ i. e., the beliefs
brought into and woven through their plots are real beliefs; the settings are set-
tings of actuality; the history involved is real history; the speech of the various
types of natives is taken from their own lips; and what Mr. Dwyer is kind enough
to call 'my color and real atmosphere’ is the color and breath of the West Indies
as they are. Like a Beethoven sonata (granted one has the technical skill to play
it properly), it is not necessary to do more than to reproduce what the composer
has set down.”

  Martin J. Eberhardt, of Brooklyn, writes to the Eyrie: "As a consistent reader
of Weird Tales, I should like to join in the monthly debate conducted in the
Eyrie. Specifically, I should like to offer a brief criticism of the criticism of the
magazine by Bernard Austin Dwyer, of Kingston, New York, which appeared
in the June issue. In the main, I think Mr. Dwyer is justified in all he says, but
I want to rise in defense of the thousands of readers who consider Seabury Quinn
the premier writer of the corps of entertainers who help make Weird Tales
the truly Unique Magazine. Beyond doubt both Lovecraft and Whitehead can
outwrite Doctor Quinn occasionally. Both have published occasional stories as
good as Quinn’s best, probably better than anything by him with the possible
exception of The Phantom Farmhouse. But what Mr. Dwyer overlooks is the
consistent high class of Quinn’s product. He doesn’t turn out an occasional
masterpiece, but he does write excellent, exciting, highly entertaining storiesi,
and writes them month after month, with no appreciable falling off in quality.
This, I think, is what we Quinn fans mean when we say we consider our favorite
your best writer. We may be thrilled or horrified once in a while by the truly
wonderful stories of the other writers. Every issue we’re sure of entertainment
and thrills by Seabury Quinn. He’s good, solid stuff from start to finish. His
opening situations are always novel, the adventures of Jules de Grandin are
widely different in each tale, and about the only thing the reader can safely pre-
dict when he begins one of Quinn’s stories is that the little French ghost-breaker
will develop a mighty thirst by the time the adventure is done. Just one thing
more: Mr. Dwyer complains that Jules de Grandin is speaking better English
now than he did when we first met him. Well, why not? He’s been living with

'Friend Trowbridge’ for upward of five years now, speaking English almost ex-
clusively. He wouldn’t be the brilliant little fellow we know him to be if his
English hadn’t improved in that time. 'When he remembers to make mistakes,’
as Mr. Dwyer has it, it’s only in the stress of extraordinary excitement; at all other
times he shows that he’s done what every foreigner does if he remains here long
enough: learned to think in English.”

  "I have been a reader of your magazine for over a year,” writes D. T. Logan,
of Redding, California, "and let me tell you it’s wonderful, absolutely wonder-
ful! The stories are just the type to make one forget everyday cares, they are so
different from the average run of stories. Be sure that you never let that good
author, Seabury Quinn, get away from you, he’s a marvel. So far I have only
found one thing wrong with Weird Tales, and that is the fact that it doesn’t
come around soon enough. A month is certainly a long time to wait for so much
pleasure, but at that, it gives one something mighty pleasant to look forward to.
Would it be asking too much to request you to publish Matthew Arnold’s poem,
The Forsaken Merman? I think that poem is sufficiently weird to merit a cou-
ple of pages in Weird Tales.” [It is against our editorial policy to print poems
more than one page long. The Forsaken Merman can be found in any public
library and we recommend its perusal to those who wish to read a fine weird
poem.—The Editors.]

 We smiled as he sullenly sank to sleep,

 We lowered him down to the dismal dead,
   The scourge of a thousand ships,

 A weight at his feet and a hole in his head,
   And a grin on his livid lips.

 We lowered him down to the dismal deep,

belt with a gun on it.

laid them down. He picked up a drill coat

 ' lother. And then he picked up something
 i that made me sit up; a bit of green, all
 cool-looking and transparent, like the sea
 out by the reef. 'Here,’ I says, 'let’s see
 that.’

   "He didn’t know I was awake, and it
 scared him. First off, he was all for
 putting everything away, but I talked him
 out of it; persuaded him; gave him an-
 other silver piece.

    "You know what that green thing was?
 Jade. A little piece of green stone no
 bigger than my thumb, as cool to the
 touch as it looked, and smooth. I tell you,
 sir, there is nothing smoother than pol-
 I ished jade. Carved, it was. I couldn’t
 make it out at first; then I saw. It was
 an elephant, fighting, trunk up and ears
 ,wide; and twined around him, choking
 him, was a snake. Think of it—a snake
 big enough to choke an elephant!

   "The mozo put out his hand; he
 Vanted that jade elephant back. "Wait a
 bit,’ I says. 'Where’d this come from?’

    "That Indian shook his head, scared.
 He didn’t want to talk; but when I hung
 onto the elephant he motioned over his
 shoulder at the jungle and muttered
 something. It sounded like 'Ximu-tal.’

    " 'Ximu-tal?’' I says. 'What’s that?’
 And finally I got out of him that Ximu-
 tal was one of the old gods; or maybe
 just a high priest, a big medicine man,
 ages before this Indian’s people had come
 to the coast. 'Where?’ I said, but he
 wouldn’t tell me.

    "I handed the jade piece back to him,
 hating to let go of it. It’s like that with
 jade, you want to hang onto it, smoothing
 of it. . . . And then I lay down and pre-
 tended to go to sleep again. I wasn’t
 asleep, though. I was watching that mozo
 to see where he’d hide the stuff. And I
 4>-as thinking. Funny that an Indian

would have a white man’s outfit like that.
I kept wondering where he got it, and
how.

  "I saw where he hid it, in the thatch
of the wall. The old fellow lay down
right in front of it, but after awhile when
I was sure he was asleep I got out of the
hut and went around outside where I
could burrow in and get it. I felt better
when I got that belt around me and the
gun against my leg. Bad customers, some-
times, those coast Indians. Treacherous;
yes, sir.

   "I was sitting there, back inside, look-
ing over the maps and things, when the
mozo woke up. They didn’t mean much
to me, those maps, not knowing the lay
of the country. One of the notebooks had
pictures, sketched in, and one of them
was of a stone building, sort of a temple,
on a little hill. What made me notice it
was the way it had a big snake around it,
carved in the stone.

  "The Indian was all for taking those
things away from me. Kept after me,
ugly. I didn’t have any more silver.
Finally I had to persuade him with the
gun, hitting him over the head with the
butt. I didn’t want to shoot him; the
whole village would have been in on top
of me. I tied him up and leaned him
against a wall. He wouldn’t talk; just sat
there looking at me with his eyes glinting
at me, hard, like brown glass. I was glad
he was tied up, I tell you, sir. They are
treacherous devils, those Indians.

  "But he had to talk. I made him. I
had to know. That jade elephant was in
my pocket, under my thumb. I had to
know where it came from. And the mozo
knew, I could see that. There was a
little fire in the hut. I shoved some coals
over against his feet and let him think
about it—hot coals.
THE CURSE OF XIMU-TAL

  "I slipped out of the village that
night. The Indian had a little boucan
hung up; there was a little fruit. I took
that, slung in a net over my shoulder. I
left the mozo tied up and gagged. He
couldn’t have followed me, though; not
far. No. . . .

c< Tust inside the green wall of jungle I
*1 found the road he’d told about, a
stone road running away from the coast
straight as a string. Sometime that had
been a great road, I tell you, sir; stone
blocks laid wide enough for two or three
to walk abreast. They had great engi-
neers, the old boys who built those lost
cities. Why, I saw later on—but never
mind that.

  "Three days I followed that road, and
didn’t make three times that many miles.
The jungle had taken it, smothered it.
Trees grew against the stones, across
them, between them. Vines wove green
nets until you couldn’t see beyond arm’s
reach. And the stone blocks, big as a
wagon-bed, were torn up and tossed
aside by the roots that reached in between
and under. And all the time I had a
queer feeling that the jungle was alive,
growing up behind me as fast as I was
cutting it away in front. I knew I was
watched, too. No, it wasn’t the Indians.
I wasn’t worrying about the Indians. The
way that mozo had talked I knew they
wouldn’t come that road. Snakes, he’d
said, but I didn’t see any; not many,
anyway.

  "The fourth morning I came into
more of an open. The jungle wasn’t quite
so thick. I tell you, I was glad! My hand
was one blister and my arm an ache from
using the machete so much to cut my way
through. My food was gone, too, and my
water; and so when the trees opened up

a little and I could see around, I was glad.

  "It was a queer place that road had
brought me to. A stone city that covered
acres and acres, and not a soul living in it.
Can you believe it? No, sir, not a living
soul. Great walls hundreds of feet long,
all carved with queer heads and curly-
cues. On the biggest building there were
heads that looked like elephants. Think
of that; elephants in a jungle where no
one had ever seen an elephant. But on
all the other buildings—over the big
arches of the doorways, along the tops of
the walls, twined about carved heads of
queer-looking men—were snakes cut
from- the stone. It got so after awhile it
seemed like they were alive. Oh, it was
a bad place! And everywhere—in the
streets, in the houses, on the walls—were
trees growing, hundreds of years old.

  "I was looking for that little hill with
the snake temple on top of it that I’d
found in the notebook, and by and by I
found it. The hill was a pyramid. Did
you know those old engineers built pyra-
mids, like the Egyptians did? Yes. Some
say both came from the same stock, from
that same sunken island where they made
the jade. . . .

  "There were wide stone steps running
up on all four sides of the pyramid to
the temple on top, and I climbed up. I
could see someone had been here not
very long ago, and I knew for sure this
was the place. From what that Indian had
told me, and what I could make out from
the notebook and maps, I knew pretty
well what to look for. And I found it—
a big stone block in the floor of the tem-
ple propped up with a rock, with a dark
hole under it.

  "I didn’t like the looks of that hole.
No, sir! I went outside and looked at the
stone snake that ran like a balustrade all
160

WEIRD TALES

around the temple, and I liked it less
than ever. Then my fingers touched that
jade elephant in my pocket and the
smooth feel of it made me go on. I made
up some bundles of dry wood, rolled
tight, for torches, and started down the
hole.

  "The white man, whoever he was, had
worked hard. I wondered how he knew
where to dig. The old passage had been
full of dirt and little rocks, and he had
carried it all out, burrowing. He must
have been a worker, that fellow. I lit one
of my torches and crawled down.

  "There was one bad place. A big rock
in the top of the passage had started to
fall in and the white man had propped it
up with a thick stick. Just room to edge
by, with dirt and little rocks dropping if
you just touched that stick. I didn’t like
it; no, sir!

  "Stooped over, bent double, I went
down that passage. First thing I knew,
there I was in a room. I was below the
level of the city, by then; ’way down
beneath the hill in the virgin rock. Part
of the wall looked like rock that water
has worn, and part of it had been cut
away and smoothed off.

   "First off, I thought this was as far as I
could go. There was just this room, a
score of feet, maybe, across. Not a sign,
anywhere, of an opening except that low
doorway where I’d come in. Silent, it
was; still. You’ve thought you knew what
silence was, maybe—out in the woods, or
at night. There never was anything as
still and silent as that low room down
under Ximu-tal’s temple. It was a stillness
that you could feel, if you know what I
mean; soft and gentle at first, but push-
ing and pushing until you’d feel you
couldn’t stand it any longer. Just wear
you out, it would, with its soft pushing.

  ' I couldn't find any way beyond, and
yet I knew there must be. That Indian

had said- It was then I noticed it.

that carved snake of Ximu-tal’s. It was
like that great carved snake around the
temple above, only not quite the same.
This looked a lot older. The old fellow
that cut it there in the living rock of that
cave didn’t know his job as well as the
one that came later, but you knew what
he meant it for. Oh, I knew what it was!
That head. ...

“T saw the tail of it first. That sculptor

  JL fellow had carved it so that it hung
down the wall and out upon the floor. I
lighted up another of my torches and
followed the body of the snake, winding
along the wall, over and above the door
where I’d come in; right around that
room until it came back to the side where
the tail was. And there was the head.
God, what a head! The old artist had
taken a knob of stone on the wall and cut
it into the head of a snake with jaws wide
open, just like the serpent was coming
for you, ready to strike.

  "They’d painted that snake. Green it
was, head to tail, all the length of it. And
between the open jaws, back in the throat,
it was red like a flame. But it was the
eyes—I tell you, sir, those eyes were
alive, bright and hard and glistening;
pieces of jade as big as my hand, round
and polished.

  "Beneath the snake’s head on one of
the stone blocks of the floor was carved
something; some of that picture stuff. It
was one of those old hieroglyphs that not
one of these blessed science sharps has
been able to read—not one of them.

  "I couldn’t read it, but I knew what it
meant. Just as plain as could be it told
me to turn around and go, and never
THE CURSE OF XIMU-TAL

161

come back. I looked from the picture
writing to the head of that emerald snake
and my heart was like water. I knew, if
I didn’t do what that old priest chap
Ximu-tal was telling me, that his snake
would get me. Yes, sir, I knew it.

   "I was going. I tell you I was going,
when my thumb hit upon the little jade
elephant in my pocket, cool and smooth.
And then I couldn’t go. I had to see it
through. It was like the snake was warn-
ing me to pull out, and the elephant was
telling me to stay. And I stayed.

,< "I knelt there by that picture writing,
just under the head of Ximu-tal’s snake,
and felt the carving over with my fingers.
I could see someone had been there before
me, doing that same thing; disturbing the
dust that had lain there nobody knows
how long.

   "I knew I was on the right track. I
felt the carving over. There was a snake
running through, and I had a thought. I
pressed on the head of the snake. I pulled
on it. Something I did, and one end of
that stone block swung up.

   "A queer, wicked smell came from that
black hole; a strange smell, I didn’t know
what. But I took the last of my torches
and went down. All the way down
those stone steps, all the way along the
passage that slanted off into the rock, I
knew—mind you, I knew!—that at the
end I was going to hit upon something
wickeder and more evil than anything I
had ever seen. But I went.

   ’’Pretty soon away off there in front of
me I saw a light; a little flickering light
like a green flame. I came to a doorway,
and put my torch through, and saw what
it was. I’ll tell you, but you won’t believe
me; nobody would.

   "It was a round room, deep down there
in the living rock beneath that dead city;

a big, round room with a vaulted ceiling.
It was like I was on the inside of half a
hollow ball. Out there in the middle, just
in front of me, was a stone coffin, with
more of that picture stuff on it. Ximu-
tal’s coffin, it was; huge and heavy. And
on top of the stone lid was a green snake.
That was what I had seen like green
flame ahead of me, the upraised head of
that snake of Ximu-tal’s.

  ”1 blew my torch into burning—my
last torch it was, too—and went over to
the coffin. There was something under
my feet, brittle things that snapped
under me like dried sticks, but I couldn’t
stop to look. God, what a thing that was,
that jade snake on Ximu-tal’s coffin! Big.
My two arms wouldn’t go around that
piece, I tell you; and cold and translucent
as green ice.

   "But that wasn’t it, not the size of it.
It was what it was. There was the snake
and the elephant again, but they weren’t
fighting. No, they weren’t fighting any
more. The elephant was down, dead—
crushed in the folds of that great snake.
Think what a snake must be to crush an
elephant that way!

  "Oh, it was a wicked thing, that snake,
head up, jaws wide. And yet the beauty
of it, the evil loveliness of that snake as
it reared above the stone coffin! My hands
ached for it. I wanted to feel the cool
smoothness of it flowing over my fingers,
up my arms. And I was afraid. I knew
that if I touched the snake of Ximu-tal
as the other man had—I could see where
his fingers had smoothed the dust from
it—I was done. I wanted it; and I was
afraid. My fingers went out to it—slow
—rslow. . . .

THE twigs which N'Longa flung on
the fire broke and crackled. The
upleaping flames lighted the coun-
tenances of die two men. N’Longa, voo-
doo man of the Slave Coast, was very old.
His wizened and gnarled frame was
stooped and brittle, his face creased by
hundreds of wrinkles. The red firelight
glinted on the human finger-bones which
composed his necklace.

    162

  The other was a white man and his
name was Solomon Kane. He was tall and
broad-shouldered, clad in blade close gar-
ments, the garb of the Puritan. His feather-
less slouch hat was drawn low over his
heavy brows, shadowing his darkly pallid
face. His cold deep eyes brooded in the
firelight.

  "You come again, brother,” droned the
fetish-man, speaking in the jargon which
passed for a common language of black
man and white on the West Coast. "Many
moons bum and die since we make blood-
palaver. You go to the setting sun, but
you come back!”

  "Aye.” Kane’s voice was deep and al-
most ghostly. "Yours is a grim land,
N’Longa, a red land barred with the black
darkness of horror and the bloody shadows
of death. Yet I have returned-”

  N’Longa stirred the fire, sayingnothing,
and after a pause Kane continued.

  "Yonder in the unknown vastncss”—
his long finger stabbed at the black silent
jungle which brooded beyond the firelight
—"yonder lie mystery and adventure and
nameless terror. Once I dared the jungle
—once she nearly claimed my bones,

Something entered into my blood, some-
thing stole into my soul like a whisper of
unnamed sin. The jungle! Dark and
brooding—over leagues of the blue salt
sea she has drawn me and with the dawn
I go to seek the heart of her. Mayhap I
shall find curious adventure—mayhap my
doom awaits me. But better death than the
ceaseless and everlasting urge, the fire that
has burned my veins with bitter longing.”

  "She call,” muttered N’Longa. "At
night she coil like serpent about my hut
and whisper strange things to me. At ya!
The jungle call. We be blood-brothers,
you and I. Me, N’Longa, mighty worker
of nameless magic. You go to the jungle
as all men go who hear her call. Maybe
you live, more like you die. You believe
in my fetish work?"

   "I understand it not,” said Kane grim-
ly, "but I have seen you send your soul
forth from your body to animate'a lifeless
corpse.”

  "Aye! Me N’Longa, priest of the Black
God! Now watch, I make magic.”

  Kane gazed at the black man who bent
over the fire, making even motions with
his hands and mumbling incantations.
Kane watched and he seemed to grow
sleepy. A mist wavered in front of him,
through which he saw dimly the form of
N’Longa, etched black against the flames.
Then all faded out.

  Kane awoke with a start, hand shoot-
ing to the pistol in his belt. N’Longa
grinned at him across the flame and there
was a scent of early dawn in the air. The
fetish-man held a long stave of curious
black wood in his hands. This stave was
carved in a strange manner, and one end
tapered to a sharp point.

  "This voodoo staff,” said N’Longa,
putting it in the Englishman’s hand.
"Where your guns and long knife fail,

this save you. When you want me, lay
this on your breast, fold your hands on it
and sleep. I come to you in your dreams.”
Kane weighed the thing in his hand,
highly suspicious of witchcraft. It was not
heavy, but seemed hard as iron. A good
weapon at least, he decided. Dawn was
just beginning to steal over the jungle and
the river.

2.	Red Eyes

Solomon Kane shifted his musket
from his shoulder and let the stock fall
to the earth. Silence lay about him like a
fog. Kane’s lined face and tattered gar-
ments showed the effect of long bush
travel. He looked about him.

  Some distance behind him loomed the
green, rank jungle, thinning out to low
shrubs, stunted trees and tall grass. Some
distance in front of him rose the first of a
chain of bare, somber hills, littered with
boulders, shimmering in the merciless
heat of the sun. Between the hills and the
jungle lay a broad expanse of rough, un-
even grasslands, dotted here and there by
clumps of thorn-trees.

  An utter silence hung over the country.
The only sign of life was a few vultures
flapping heavily across the distant hills.
For the last few days Kane had noticed
the increasing number of these unsavory
birds. The sun was rocking westward
but its heat was in no way abated.

  Trailing his musket he started forward
slowly. He had no objective in view. This
was all unknown. country and one direc-
tion was as good as another. Many weeks
ago he had plunged into the jungle with
the assurance born of courage and igno-
rance. Having by some miracle survived
the first few weeks, he was becoming hard
and toughened, able to hold his own with
any of the grim denizens of the fastness
he dared.
THE HILLS OF THE DEAD

165

  As he progressed he noted an occasional
lion spoor but there seemed to be no ani-
mals in the grasslands—none that left
tracks, at any rate. Vultures sat like black,
brooding images in some of the stunted
trees, and suddenly he saw an activity
among them some distance beyond. Sev-
eral of the dusky birds circled about a
clump of high grass, dipping, then rising
again. Some beast of prey was defending
his kill against them, Kane decided, and
wondered at the lack of snarling and roar-
ing which usually accompanied such
sCenes. His curiosity was roused and he
turned his steps in that direction.

  At last, pushing through the grass which
rose about his shoulders, he saw, as
through a corridor walled with the rank
waving blades, a ghastly sight. The corpse
of a black man lay, face down, and as the
Englishman looked, a great dark snake
rose and slid away into the grass, moving
so quickly that Kane was unable to decide
its nature. But it had a weird human-like
suggestion about it.

  Kane stood over the body, noting that
while the limbs lay awry as if broken, the
flesh was not torn as a lion or leopard
would have torn it. He glanced up at the
whirling vultures and was amazed to see
several of them skimming along close to
the earth, following a waving of the grass
which marked the flight of the thing
which had presumably slain the black
man. Kane wondered what thing the car-
rion birds, which eat only the dead, were
hunting through the grasslands. But
Africa is full of never - explained mys-
teries.

  Kane shrugged his shoulders and lifted
his musket again. Adventures he had had
in plenty since he parted from N’Longa
some moons agone, but still that nameless
paranoid urge had driven him on and on,
deeper and deeper into those trackless

ways. Kane could not have analyzed this
call; he would have attributed it to Satan,
who lures men to their destruction. But
it was but the restless turbulent spirit of
the adventurer, the wanderer—the same
urge which sends the gipsy caravans about
the world, which drove the Viking galleys
over unknown seas and which guides the
flights of the wild geese.

  Kane sighed. Here in this barren land
seemed neither food nor water, but he had
wearied unto death of the dank, rank
venom of the thick jungle. Even a wil-
derness of bare hills was preferable, for a
time at least. He glanced at them, where
they lay brooding in the sun, and started
forward again.

  He held N’Longa’s fetish stave in his
left hand, and though his conscience still
troubled him for keeping a thing so ap-
parently diabolic in nature, he had never
been able to bring himself to throw it
away.

  Now as he went toward the hills, a
sudden commotion broke out in the tall
grass in front of him, which was, in
places, taller than a man. A thin, high-
pitched scream sounded and on its heels
an earth-shaking roar. The grass parted
and a slim figure came flying toward him
like a wisp of straw blown on the wind
—a brown-skinned girl, clad only in a
skirt-like garment. Behind her, some
yards away but gaining swiftly, came a
huge lion.

  The girl fell at Kane’s feet with a wail
and a sob, and lay clutching at his ankles*
The Englishman dropped the voodoO
stave, raised his musket to his shoulder
and sighted coolly at the ferocious feline
face which neared him every instant.
Crash! The girl screamed once and
slumped on her face. The huge cat
166

WEIRD TALES

leaped high and wildly, to fall and lie
motionless.

Kane reloaded hastily before he
. spared a glance at the form at his
feet. The girl lay as still as the lion he
had just slain, but a quick examination
showed that she had only fainted.

  He bathed her face with water from
his canteen and presently she opened her
eyes and sat up. Fear flooded her face as
she looked at her rescuer and she made
to rise.

  Kane held out a restraining hand and
she cowered down, trembling. The roar
of his heavy musket was enough to
frighten any native who had never be-
fore seen a white man, Kane reflected.

  The girl was a much higher type than
the thick-lipped, bestial West Coast ne-
groes to whom Kane had been used. She
was slim and finely formed, of a deep
brown hue rather than ebony; he'r nose
was straight and thin-bridged, her lips
were not too thick. Somewhere in her
blood there was a strong Berber strain.

  Kane spoke to her in a river dialect, a
simple language he had learned during
his wandering, and she replied haltingly.
The inland tribes traded slaves and ivory
to the river people and were familiar
with their jargon.

  "My village is there,'' she answered
Kane’s question, pointing to the southern
jungle with a slim, rounded arm. "My
name is Zunna. My mother whipped me
for breaking a cooking-kettle and I ran
away because I was angry. I am afraid;
let me go back to my mother!”

  "You may go,” said Kane, "but I will
take you, child. Suppose another lion
came along? You were very foolish to
run away.”

  She whimpered a little. "Are you not
a god?”

  "No, Zunna. I am only a man, though
the color of my skin is not as yours. Lead
me now to your village.”

   She rose hesitantly, eyeing him appre-
hensively through the wild tangle of her
hair. To Kane she seemed like some
frightened young animal. She led the
way and Kane followed. She indicated
that her village lay to the southeast, and
their route brought them nearer to the
hills. The sun began to sink and the
roaring of lions reverberated over the
grasslands. Kane glanced at the west-
ern sky; this open country was no place
in w'hich to be caught by night. He
glanced toward the hills and saw that
they were within a few hundred yards
of the nearest. He saw what seemed, to
be a cave.

  "Zunna.” said he haltingly, "we can
never reach your village before nightfall
and if we bide here the lions will take
us. Yonder is a cavern where we may

spend the night-—”

  She shrank and trembled.

  "Not in the hills, master!” she whim-
pered. "Better the lions!”

  "Nonsense!” His tone was impatient;
he had had enough of native superstition
"We will spend the night in yonder
cave.”

  She argued no further, but followed
him. They went up a short slope and
stood at the mouth of the cavern, a small
affair, with sides of solid rock and a
floor of deep sand.	,

  “Gather some dry grass, Zunna,” com-
manded Kane, standing his musket
against the wall at the mouth of the
cave, "but go not far away, and listen for
lions. I will build here a fire which shall
keep us safe from beasts tonight. Bring
THE HILLS OF THE DEAD

167:

some grass and any twigs you may find,
like a good child, and we will sup. I
have dried meat in my pouch and water
also.”

  She gave him a strange, long glance,
then turned away without a word. Kane
tore up grass near at hand, noting how
it was seared and crisp from the sun, and
heaping it up, struck flint and steel.
Flame leaped up and devoured the heap
in an instant. He was wondering how
he could gather enough grass to keep a
fire going all night, when he was aware
that he had visitors.

  Kane was used to grotesque sights,
but at first glance he started and a slight
coldness traveled down his spine. Two
black men stood before him in silence.
They were tall and gaunt and entirely
naked. Their skins were a dusty black,
tinged with a gray, ashy hue, as of death.
Their faces were different from any ne-
groes he had seen. The brows were
high and narrow, the noses huge and
snout-like; the eyes were inhumanly large
and inhumanly red. As the two stood
there it seemed to Kane that only their
burning eyes lived.

  He spoke to them, but they did not
answer. He invited them to eat with a
motion of his hand, and they silently
squatted down near the cave mouth, as
far from the dying embers of the fire as
they could get.

  Kane turned to his pouch and began
taking out the strips of dried meat which
he carried. Once he glanced at his silent
guests; it seemed to him that they were
watching the glowing ashes of his fire,
rather than him.

  The sun was about to sink behind the
western horizon. A red, fierce glow
spread over the grasslands, so that all
seemed like a waving sea of blood. Kane

knelt over his pouch, and glancing up,
saw Zunna come around the shoulder of
the hill with her arms full of grass and
dry branches.

  As he looked, her eyes flared wide;
the branches dropped from her arms and
her scream knifed the silence, fraught
with terrible warning. Kane whirled on
his knee. Two great black forms loomed
over him as he came up with the lithe
motion of a springing leopard. The
fetish stave was in his hand and he drove
it through the body of the nearest foe
with a force which sent its sharp point
out between the negro’s "shoulders. Then
the long, lean arms of the other locked
about him, and white man and black
man went down together.

  The talon-like nails of the black were
tearing at his face, the hideous red eyes
staring into his with a terrible threat, as
Kane writhed about and, fending off the
clawing hands with one arm, drew a pis-
tol. He pressed the muzzle close against
the black’s side and pulled the trigger.
At the muffled report, the negro’s body
jerked to the concussion of the bullet,
but the thick lips merely gaped in a hor-
rid grin.

  One long arm slid under Kane’s shoul-
ders, the other hand gripped his hair.
The Englishman felt his head being
forced back irresistibly. He clutched at
the other’s wrist with both hands, but the
flesh under his frantic fingers was as hard
as wood. Kane’s brain was reeling; his
neck seemed ready to break with a little
more pressure. He threw his body back-
ward with one volcanic effort, breaking
the deathly hold. The black was on him
and the talons were clutching again.
Kane found and raised the empty pistol,
and he felt the black man’s skull cave in
like a shell as he brought down the long
168

barrel with all his strength. And once
again the writhing lips parted in fearful
mockery.

  And now a near panic clutched Kane.
What sort of man was this, who still
menaced his life with tearing fingers,
after having been shot and mortally
bludgeoned? No man, surely, but one of
the sons of Satan! At the thought Kane
wrenched and heaved explosively, and
the close-locked combatants tumbled
across the earth to come to a rest in the
smoldering ashes before the cave mouth.
Kane barely felt the heat, but the mouth
of his foe gaped, this time in seeming
agony. The frightful fingers loosened
their hold and Kane sprang clear.

  The black man with his shattered skull
was rising on one hand and one knee
when Kane struck, returning to the attack
as a gaunt wolf returns to a wounded
bison. From the side he leaped, landing
full on the black giant’s back, his steely
arms seeking and finding a deadly
wrestling hold; and as they went to the
earth together he broke the negro’s neck,
so that the hideous dead face looked back
over one shoulder. The black man lay
still but to Kane it seemed that he was
not dead even tKen, for the red eyes still
burned with their grisly light.

  The Englishman turned, to see the girl
crouching against the cave wall. He
looked for his stave; it lay in a heap of
dust, among which were a few molder-
ing bones. He stared, his brain reeling.
Then with one stride he caught up the
voodoo staff and turned to the fallen
negro. His face set in grim lines as he
raised it; then he drove it through the
black breast. And before his eyes, the
giant body crumbled, dissolving to dust
as he watched horror-struck, even as had
crumbled he through whom Kane had
first thrust the stave.

3.	Dream Magic

      REATGod!” whispered Kane; "these
Vj men were dead! Vampires! This
is Satan’s handiwork manifested.”

  Zunna crawled to his knees and clung
there.

  "These be walking dead men, mas-
ter,” she whimpered. "I should have
warned you.”

  "Why did they not leap on my back
when they first came?” asked he.

  "They feared the fire. They were wait-
ing for the embers to die entirely.”
"Whence came they?”

  "From the hills. Hundreds of their
kind swarm among the boulders and
caverns of these hills, and they live on
human life, for a man they will slay, de-
vouring his ghost as it leaves his quiver-
ing body. Aye, they are suckers of
souls!

  "Master, among the greater of these
hills there is a silent city of stone, and in
the old times, in the days of my ancestors,
these people lived there. They were hu-
man, but they were not as we, for they
had ruled this land for ages and ages.
The ancestors of my people made war on
them and slew many, and their magicians
made all the dead men as these were. At
last all died.

  "And for ages have they preyed on the
tribes of the jungle, stalking down from
the hills at midnight and at sunset to
haunt the jungle-ways and slay and slay.
Men and beasts flee them and only fire
will destroy them.”

  "Here is that which will destroy
them,” said Kane grimly, raising the voo-
doo stave. "Black magic must fight black
magic, and I know not what spell

N’Longa put hereon, but-”

  "You are a god,” said Zunna decided-
ly. "No man could overcome two of the
THE HILLS OF THE DEA.D

169

walking dead men. Master, can you not
lift this curse from my tribe? There is
nowhere for us to flee and the monsters
slay us at will, catching wayfarers out-
side the village wall. Death is on this
land and we die helpless!”

  Deep in Kane stirred the spirit of the
crusader, the fire of the zealot—the fa-
natic who devotes his life to battling the
powers of darkness.

  "Let us eat,” said he; "then we will
build a great fire at the cave mouth. The
fire which keeps away beasts shall also
keep away fiends.”

  Later Kane sat just inside the cave,
chin rested on clenched fist, eyes gazing
unseeingly into the fire. Behind in the
shadows, Zunna watched him, awed.

  "God of Hosts,” Kane muttered,
"grant me aid! My hand it is which must
lift the ancient curse from this dark land.
How am I to fight these dead fiends,
who yield not to mortal weapons? Fire
will destroy them—a broken neck ren-
ders them helpless—the voodoo stave
thrust through them crumbles them to
dust—but of what avail? How may I
prevail against the hundreds who haunt
these hills, and to whom human life-
essence is Life? Have not—as Zunna
says—warriors come against them in the
past, only to find them fled to their high-
walled city where no man can come
against them?”

  The night wore on. Zunna slept, her
cheek pillowed on her round, girlish
arm. The roaring of the lions shook the
hills and still Kane sat and gazed brood-
ingly into the fire. Outside, the night
was alive with whispers and rustlings
and stealthily soft footfalls. And at times
Kane, glancing up from his meditations,
seemed to catch the gleam of great red
eyes beyond the flickering light of the fire.

  Gray dawn was stealing over the grass-
lands when Kane shook Zunna into wake-
fulness.

  "God have mercy on my soul for delv-
ing in barbaric magic,” said he, "but de-
monry must be fought with demonry,
mayhap. Tend ye the fire and awake me
if aught untoward occur.”

  Kane lay down on his back on die
sand floor and laid the voodoo staff on
his breast, folding his hands upon it.
He fell asleep instantly. And sleeping,
he dreamed. To his slumbering self it
seemed that he walked through a thick
fog and in this fog he met N’ Longa, true
to life. N’Longa spoke, and the words
were clear and vivid, impressing them-
selves on his consciousness so deeply as
to span the gap between sleeping and
waking.

  "Send this girl to her village soon
after sun-up when the lions have gone
to their lairs,” said N'Longa, "and bid
her bring her lover to you at this cave.
There make him lie down as if to slum-
ber, holding the voodoo stave.”

  The dream' faded and Kane awoke
suddenly, wondering. How strange and
vivid had been the vision, and how
strange to hear N’Longa talking in Eng-
lish, without the jargon! Kane shrugged
his shoulders. He knew that N’Longa
claimed to possess the power of sending
his spirit through space, and he himself
had seen the voodoo man animate a dead

man’s body. Still-

  "Zunna,” said Kane, giving the prob-
lem up, "I will go with you as far as
the edge of the jungle and you must go
on to your village and return here to this
cave with your lover.”

  "Kran?” she asked naively.

  "Whatever his name is. Eat and we
will go ”
170

Again the sun slanted toward the west.
LKane sat in the cave, waiting. He
had seen the girl safely to the place
where the jungle thinned to the grass-
lands, and though his conscience stung
him at the thought of the dangers which
might confront her, he sent her on alone
and returned to the cave. He sat now,
wondering if he would not be damned
to everlasting flames for tinkering with
the magic of a black sorcerer, blood-
brother or not.

   Light footfalls sounded, and as Kane
reached for his musket, Zunna entered,
accompanied by a tall, splendidly pro-
portioned youth whose brown skin
showed that he was of the same race as
the girl. His soft dreamy eyes were
fixed on Kane in a sort of awesome wor-
ship. Evidently the girl had not minim-
ized the white god’s glory in her telling.

   He bade the youth lie down as he di-
rected and placed the voodoo stave in his
hands. Zunna crouched at one side,
wide-eyed. Kane stepped back, half
ashamed of this mummery and wonder-
ing what, if anything, would come of it.
Then to his horror, the youth gave one
gasp and stiffened!

   Zunna screamed, bounding erect.

   "You have killed Kran!” she shrieked,
flying at the Englishman who stood struck
speechless.

  Then she halted suddenly, wavered,
drew a hand languidly across her brow

—	she slid down to lie with her arms
about the motionless body of her lover.

  And this body moved suddenly, made
aimless motions with hands and feet, then
sat up, disengaging itself from the cling-
ing arms of the still senseless girl.

  Kran looked up at Kane and grinned,
a sly, knowing grin which seemed out of
place on his face somehow. Kane start-

ed. Those soft eyes had changed in ex-
pression and were now hard and glitter-
ing and snaky—N’Longa’s eyes!

  "At ya,” said Kran in a grotesquely
familiar voice. "Blood-brother, you got
no greeting for N’Longa?”

  Kane was silent. His flesh crawled in
spite of himself. Kran rose and stretched
his arms in an unfamiliar sort of way, as
if his limbs were new to him. He slapped
his breast approvingly.

  "Me N’Longa!” said he in the old
boastful manner. "Mighty ju-ju man!
Blood-brother, not you know me, eh?”
"You are Satan,” said Kane sincerely.
"Are you Kran or are you N’Longa?”
"Me N’Longa,” assured the other.
"My body sleep in ju-ju hut on Coast
many treks from here. I borrow Kran’s
body for while. My ghost travel ten
days march in one breath; twenty days
march in same time. My ghost go out
from my body and drive out Kran’s.”
"And Kran is dead?”

  "No, he no dead. I send his ghost to
shadowland for a while—send the girl's
ghost too, to keep him company; bimeby
come back.”

  "This is the work of the Devil,” said
Kane frankly, "but I have seen you do
even fouler magic—shall I call you
N’Longa or Kran?”

  "Kran—kah! Me N’Longa—bodies
like clothes! Me N’Longa, in here now!”
he rapped his breast. "Bimeby Kran
live along here—then he be Kran and I
be N’Longa, same like before. Kran no
live along now; N’Longa live along this
one fellow body. Blood-brother, I am
N’Longa!”

  Kane nodded. This was in truth a land
of horror and enchantment; anything was
possible, even that the thin voice of
N’Longa should speak to him from the
THE HILLS OF THE DEAD

171

great chest of Kran, and the snaky eyes
of N'Longa should blink at him from
the handsome young face of Kran.

  "This land I know long time,” said
N'Longa, getting down to business.
"Mighty ju-ju, these dead people! No,
no need to waste one fellow time—I
know—I talk to you in sleep. My blood-
brother want to kill out these dead black
fellows, eh?”

   " ’Tis a thing opposed to nature,” said
Kane somberly. "They are known in my
land as vampires—I never expected to
come upon a whole nation of them.”

4.	The Silent City

“ ’V T ow we find this stone city,” said
  JLN N’Longa.

"Yes? Why not send your ghost out to
kill these vampires?” Kane asked idly.

   ,“Ghost got to have one fellow body to
work in,” N’Longa answered. "Sleep
now. Tomorrow we start.”

  The sun had set; the fire glowed and
flidkered in the cave mouth. Kane
glanced at the still form of the girl, who
lay where she had fallen, and prepared
himself for slumber.

0', "Awake me at midnight,” he admon-
ished, "and I will watch from then until
dawn.”

, But when N’Longa finally shook his
arm, Kane awoke to see the first light of
dawn reddening the land.

   "Time we start,” said the fetish-man.
   "But the girl—are you sure she lives?”
   "She live, blood-brother.”

  "Then in God’s name, we can not leave
her here at the mercy of any prowling
fiend who might chance upon her. Or

some lion might-”

  "No lion come. Vampire scent still
linger, mixed with man scent. One fel-
low lion he no like man scent and he fear

the walking dead men. No beast come;
and”—lifting the voodoo stave and laying
it across the cave entrance—"no dead man
come now.”

  Kane watched him somberly and with-
out enthusiasm.

  "How will that rod safeguard her?”
"That mighty ju-ju,” said N’Longa.
"You see how one fellow vampire go
along dust alongside that stave! No vam-
pire dare touch or come near it. I gave it
to you, because outside Vampire Hills one
fellow man sometimes,, meet a corpse
walking in jungle when shadows be
black. Not all walking dead men be here.
And all must suck Life from men—if not,
they rot like dead wood.”

  "Then make many of these rods and
arm the people with them.”

  "No can do!” N’Longa’s skull shook
violently. "That ju-ju rod be mighty
magic! Old, old! No man live today can
tell how old that fellow ju-ju stave be. I
make my blood-brother sleep and do
magic with it to guard him, that time we
make palaver in Coast village. Today we
scout and run; no need it. Leave it here
to guard girl.”

  Kane shrugged his shoulders and fol-
lowed the fetish-man, after glancing back
at the still shape which lay in the cave.
He would never have agreed to leave her
so casually, had he not believed in his
heart that she was dead. He had touched
her, and her flesh was cold.

  They went up among the barren hills
as the sun was rising. Higher they
climbed, up steep clay slopes, winding
their way through ravines and between
great boulders. The hills were honey-
combed with dark, forbidding caves, and
these they passed warily, and Kane’s
flesh crawled as he thought of the grisly
occupants therein. For N’Longa said:
172

WEIRD TALES

  "Them vampires, he sleep in caves
most all day till sunset. Them caves, he
be full of one fellow dead man.”

  The sun rose higher, baking down on
the bare slopes with an intolerable heat.
Silence brooded like an evil monster over
the land. They had seen nothing, but
Kane could have sworn at times that a
black shadow drifted behind a boulder
at their approach.

  "Them vampires, they stay hid in day-
time,” said N’Longa with a low laugh.
"They be afraid of one fellow vulture!
No fool vulture! He know death when
he see it! He pounce on one fellow dead
man and tear and eat if he be lying or
walking!”

  A strong shudder shook his com-
panion.

  "Great God!” Kane cried, striking his
thigh with his hat; "is there no end to
the horror of this hideous land? Truly
this land is dedicated to the powers of
darkness!”

  Kane’s eyes burned with a dangerous
light. The terrible heat, the solitude and
the knowledge of the horrors lurking on
either hand were shaking even his steely
nerves.

  "Keep on one fellow hat, blood-
brother,” admonished N’Longa with a
low gurgle of amusement. "That fellow
sun, he knock you dead, suppose you no
look out.”

  Kane shifted the musket he had in-
sisted on bringing and made no reply.
They mounted an eminence at last and
looked down on a sort of plateau. And
in the center of this plateau was a silent
city of gray and crumbling stone. Kane
was smitten by a sense of incredible age
as he looked. The walls and houses were
of great stone blocks, yet they were fall-
ing into ruin. Grass grew on the plateau,

and high in the streets of that dead city.
Kane saw no movement among the ruins.

  "That is their city—why do they choose
to sleep in caves?”

  "Maybe-so one fellow stone fall on
them from roof and crush. Them stone
huts, he fall down bimeby. Maybe-so
they no like to stay together—maybe-so
they eat each other, too.”

  "Silence!” whispered Kane; "how it
hangs over all!”

  "Them vampires no talk nor yell; they
dead. They sleep in caves, wander at sun-
set and at night. Maybe-so them black
fellow bush tribes come with spears, them
vampires go to stone kraal and fight
behind walls.”

  Kane nodded. The crumbling walls
which surrounded that dead city were
still high and solid enough to resist the
attack of spearmen—especially when de-
fended by these snout-nosed fiends.

  "Blood-brother,” said N’Longa sol-
emnly, "I have mighty magic thought! Be
silent a little while.”

(Mj

Kane seated himself on a boulder and
. gazed broodingly at the bare crags
and slopes which surrounded them. Far
away to the south he saw the leafy green
ocean that was the jungle. Distance lent
a certain enchantment to the scene. Closer
at hand loomed the dark blotches that
were the mouths of the caves of horror.

  N’Longa was squatting, tracing some
strange pattern in the clay with a dagger
point. Kane watched him, thinking how
easy they might 'fall victim to the vam-
pires if even three or four of the fiends
should come out of their caverns. And
even as he thought it, a black and horrific
shadow fell across the crouching fetish-
man.

Kane acted without conscious thought.
THE HILLS OF THE DEAD

173

He shot from the boulder where he sat
like a stone hurled from a catapult, and
his musket stock shattered the face of the
hideous black thing who had stolen upon
them. Back and back Kane drove his in-
human foe staggering, never giving him
time to halt or launch an offensive, batter-
ing him with the onslaught of a frenzied
tiger.

  At the very edge of the cliff the vam-
pire wavered, then pitched back over, to
fall for a hundred feet and lie writhing
on the rocks of the plateau below.
N’Longa was on his feet pointing; the
hills were giving up their dead.

  Out of the caves they were swarming,
the terrible black silent shapes; up the
slopes they came charging and over the
boulders they came clambering, and their
red eyes were all turned toward the two
humans who stood above the silent city.
The caves belched them forth in an un-
holy judgment day.

  N’Longa pointed to a crag some dis-
tance away and with a shout started run-
ning fleetly toward it. Kane followed.
From behind boulders black-taloned
hands clawed at them, tearing their gar-
ments. They raced past caves, and mum-
mied monsters came lurching out of the
dark, gibbering silently, to join in the
pursuit.

  The dead hands were close at their
back when they scrambled up the last
slope and stood on a ledge which was the
top of the crag. The fiends halted silently
a moment, then came clambering after
them. Kane clubbed his musket and
smashed down into the red-eyed faces,
knocking aside the upleaping hands. They
surged up like a black wave; he swung
his musket in a silent fury that matched
theirs. The black wave broke and
wavered back; came on again.

  He—could—not—kill—them! These
words beat on his brain like a sledge on
an anvil as he shattered wood-like flesh
and dead bone with his smashing swings.
He knocked them down, hurled them
back, but they rose and came on again.
This could not last—what in God’s name
was N’Longa doing? Kane spared ,one
swift, tortured glance over his shoulder.
The fetish-man stood on the highest part
of the ledge, head thrown back, arms
lifted as if in invocation.

  Kane’s vision blurred to the sweep of
hideous black faces with red, staring eyes.
Those in front were horrible to see now,
for their skulls were shattered, their faces
caved in and their limbs broken. But
still they came on and those behind
reached across their shoulders to clutch at
the man who defied them.

  Kane was red but the blood was all his.
From the long-withered veins of those
monsters no single drop of warm red
blood trickled. Suddenly from behind
him came a long piercing wail —
N’Longa! Over the crash of the flying
musket-stock and the shattering of bones
it sounded high and clear—the only voice
lifted in that hideous fight.

  The black wave washed about Kane’s
feet, dragging him down. Keen talons
tore at him, flaccid lips sucked at his
wounds. He reeled up again, disheveled
and bloody, clearing a space with a shat-
tering sweep of his splintered musket.
Then they closed in again and he went
down.

  "This is the end!” he thought, but even
at that instant the press slackened and the
sky was suddenly filled with the beat of
great wings.

  Then he was free and staggered up,
blindly and dizzily, ready to renew the

RUSSELL dived sharply from the
yawl’s deck as the last great wave
*“ struck and submerged it. He rose
and sank in the foam-churned surf, then
rose again and with great strokes fought
toward the shoreline he could glimpse
through the spray. The waters were thun-
derous in his ears and behind him the
descending sun lit the world with cop-
pery fire.

  As he struggled on Russell was aware
by brief glimpses that the beach ahead was
nearer. The giant waves from behind bore
him forward toward it in great leaps, but
the deadly undertow gripped his feet with
serpent grasp to pull him back. He kicked,
struggled, and at last felt firm sand
beneath his feet, and staggered up onto

it beyond the clawing grasp of the waves.

  He looked about him, dazed for a
moment by his struggle with the furious
ocean. He was standing on the beach of
an island some three miles in length. Its
surface, clothed green with sycamore and
oak and brush, sloped gently up to higher
ground at the island’s center.

  A sound came to Russell’s ears over
the roar of the surf, and he half turned.
Down from the island’s wooded center by
a narrow path a shirt-sleeved and hatless
man was hastening toward him. As he
approached, Russell saw that he wras
over middle age, with quick eyes and a
keen, intellectual countenance beneath his
graying hair. His face held anxiety as he
came closer, hand outstretched.

  "My. dear sir! I saw your boat founder-
ing from my place—but it seems it was all
over before I got here. You’re not hurt?”
"More chagrined than hurt,” Russell
managed to smile. "They told me over in
Charleston that if I went too far out from
the coast the squalls would get me, but I
thought I could pull the yawl through
them.”

  The other seemed relieved. "Well, it
was as narrow an escape as I’ve ever seen.
These squalls are treacherous, and if you

hadn’t been near this island-”

  "It was just dumb luck that I was,”
Russell admitted. "And I never looked to
find anyone here until you appeared. Most
of the islands this far off the Carolina
coast are uninhabited, aren’t they?”

  "Most of them are,” said the other,
"but this one happens to be the site of the
Northern University Biological Station.
You’ve heard of it, perhaps?”

  "Of course!” Russell was interested.
"Over in Charleston I heard.”

  "I’m Dr. James Garland, the bio-
chemist of the station and just now its
only member,” the other introduced him-
self. "There are ordinarily a half-dozen
of us here—-Dr. Wallace, the head, Pro-
fessor Lowerman, and three others, but
they’ve all gone off to Charleston for a
vacation and I’m the unlucky one who
stays here to tend their routine-work while
they’re gone.”

  "Russell’s my name,” the younger man
replied. "Just one of New York’s strug-
gling young attorneys, on a trip south in
a yawl that I always thought until now I
could manage.”

  Dr. Garland smiled. "I’m afraid you’ll
have to put in a few days here with me
until the others get back, for they went
in our only boat. If you can put up with

a somewhat irregular one-man house-
hold-?”

  "Crusoes can’t be choosers,” Russell
told him, "Besides—I’ve heard something
about this station—I’m really glad of the
opportunity to visit it.”

  "Well, you’d better begin your visit by
changing to dry clothes,” observed the
other. "Lowerman’s about your size—
I’m sure he’d be glad to lend you anything
of his if he were here.”

  He led the way across the beach and
along the narrow path that twisted up-
ward through the spring-green woods.
The sun was sinking lower behind them
and the keen sea-wind, striking Russell’s
dripping garments, soon had his teeth
chattering. He was glad enough when
they came out onto the more sparsely
wooded plateau that was the island’s high-
est part, and glimpsed the squat frame
bungalow and the long and broad un-
painted frame building some distance
behind it.

  "The laboratories,” Garland gestured
toward the latter structure. "I’ll show you
all over them, later, but just now the
quicker you change the better.”

  Russell followed him into the bun-
galow and across a roomy living-room
with comfortable, masculine furnishings
to one of the bedrooms at the rear. There
the bio-chemist dug from a mass of care-
lessly piled clothing and impedimenta a
set of garments that were well-worn but
dry and warm. When Garland left him
with them darkness was falling, and
Russell switched on the lights.

  Arrayed in the dry clothes he ventured
back into the living-room and found Dr.
Garland busy with rolled-up sleeves in the
surprizingly neat little kitchen. Russell,
proficient in a boat’s galley, helped him
prepare the meal that they were soon

falling upon, their only conversation the
occasional monosyllables of hungry men
at table.

Sitting before the blazing fireplace a
little later and smoking one of the
cigarettes his host had proffered, Russell
reflected that there were, indisputably,
worse places. Over the whine of winds
outside there came to his ears the dim
thunder of the distant surf. He hitched
his chair closer to the comforting fire.

  “I’m really immensely interested in
your place here,” he told the other. "I
heard quite a bit about it over in Charles-
ton.”

  "All of it good?” asked his host quiz-
zically, and Russell grinned.

  "Well, as a matter of fact some of them
did talk a good bit of rot about you and
your friends. They had some melodra-
matic whispers about something pretty
diabolical going on out here, and I
gathered that you’re all regarded as so
many Twentieth Century Friar Bacons by
a good many of them.”

  Garland laughed, blowing smoke from
his cigarette. "Friar Bacon’s a good exam-
ple,” he said. "The ignorance of modern
people is often amazing, and the mere fact
that we came to this lonely spot to set up
our research station was enough to let
those good people know that we were up
to something that we wanted to keep
hidden.”

  "It is a rather unusual spot for a re-
search station, isn’t it?”

  "Not at all,” Garland promptly dis-
claimed. "The main purpose of this sta-
tion is to make an exhaustive study of
the evolutionary differences between some
of the lower invertebrate sea-creatures.
For that reason a sea-location with varied
depths and conditions is necessary; so
when we started the station we persuaded

the university to let us come here. Of
course we all have our own side-lines here
still—Wallace has his chromosomes, and
Snelling his cell-theory, and I my size-
changing work—but we’ve all got to
spend most of our time on the station’s
main research or the university wouldn’t
support it long.”

  Russell caught at one of his phrases.
"Your size-changing work?”

  The bio-chemist waved his cigarette.
"My pet hobby. I’ve been able to stimu-
late the pituitary’s functioning to an un-
heard-of degree, or to halt it almost alto-
gether. Of course, control is still rather
a problem.”

  "I’m afraid you’ll think me deplorably
ignorant,” Russell said, "but that means
as much to me as algebra to a Hottentot.”
Garland laughed. "These schools!
What do they teach you nowadays? Well,
the thing’s simple enough in theory. You
know, I suppose, that the size of a human
or animal body is directly dependent on
the functioning of its pituitary gland?”

  "I seem to have heard something about
a gland controlling the body’s size,” Rus-
sell admitted.

  "No doubt,” said Garland dryly. "Well,
the pituitary gland, which is located near
the center of the head, does actually con-
trol the size of the body by its secretions.
If it secretes normally your body is of
normal size. If it secretes more than nor-
mally you are a giant. If less than nor-
mally, you are a dwarf. Now since that
fact became known—I hope you will par-
don my classroom manner, but for years
I dinned these facts into sophomores—
since that fact became known biologists
over all the world have been attempting
an artificial regulation of the body’s size
by means of it. That is, they have sought
to stimulate or lessen the gland’s secre-
178

WEIRD TALES

tions, and so increase or decrease the
body’s size.

  "This experimentation has been on the
whole rather fruitless so far. It’s true that
by tampering with the gland biologists
have been able to make some animals a
little larger or smaller than normal, but
that’s all they’ve been able to accomplish
—a mere stunting or hastening of growth.
The fact is that the ductless glands like
the pituitary and thyroid are such delicate
organisms that when we tamper with them
surgically we damage them nine times out
of ten. I became aware of that years ago,
so left it off and started working from a
different point of attack.

 "I have-” Garland suddenly

halted, rising to his feet. Grasping a
heavy stick of firewood he stepped softly
to the door, then flung it suddenly open.

  Russell, amazed, heard the quick
scurrying of something on the veranda
outside as the door was flung open. For a
moment Garland gazed intently out into
the darkness, then closed the door.

  "Damn them—they get bolder every
day!” he exclaimed angrily.

  "Rats?” asked Russell, and the other
looked over at him and nodded.

  "And cursed annoying ones, too,” he
said irritably. "Under the house and
laboratory and all around them, yet you
can’t lay hands on them at all.”

  His brow cleared as he resumed his
seat. "Where was I? Oh, yes. Well, as
I was saying, I’ve gone at this problem
of influencing the pituitary gland in a
different way. I said to myself, why cut
open the head and take* immense risks to
reach the gland, when through the blood
that nourishes it we can reach it easily? I
said, what if I devise a compound which
when injected into the blood-stream will
in time flow through the pituitary gland

and excite it into unheard-of activity?
And what if I work out an opposite com-
pound that will reach the gland in the
same way through the blood, but that
instead of stimulating will halt, or almost
halt, its functioning? You perceive what
that would mean?”

  Russell’s brow puckered. "Why, good
Lord!” he exclaimed. "That would en-
able you to increase or decrease the body’s
size at will!”

   Garland bowed. "You see it. So I set
to work devising the two necessary com-
pounds. The thing seemed clear in
theory, but I don’t mind saying that it‘s
proved cursed difficult in actual fact. Na-
ture’s a mistress whose work is mighty
hard to change. But I’ve plugged away,
at the university and here, until I have
the formulas for my two compounds all
worked out, and have been able to make
enough of them to prove their efficacy
beyond any doubt.

   "I take a dog, for instance. I inject into
one of his arteries leading into the head
the stimulating compound. Soon that.
compound, carried by the blood-stream,
reaches the pituitary gland, and at once,
by reason of its irritant effect upon the
gland, spurs it to tremendous activity. It
throws its secretions into the dog’s body
at a terrific rate. I may say parenthetically
that the injection produces coma almost
at once in the subject.' Within a day that
dog, lying in coma, will have increased in
bodily size to a giant dog six times its
normal stature, if the stimulating com-
pound has been injected in sufficient quan-
tity. It will wake as a giant dog and will
remain that size indefinitely, the com-
pound in the gland stimulating it un-
ceasingly until neutralized by the op-
posing compound.

  "You will say, that dog increases six
PIGMY ISLAND

179

times in actual bulk and weight in its day
of coma; how can that be? I ask in turn
how did the dog increase from a small
puppy to a full-grown dog in a year? It
did so because in the food it ate and the
air it breathed it took in food elements
that its body-organism turned into tissue.
Had it breathed more or eaten more it
would not have grown faster, for the body
organism can only assimilate the food-
elements at a certain rate, and that rate
is directly dependent upon the secretions
of the vital pituitary gland.

  "But by immensely increasing their
secretions, I have immensely accelerated
the rate at which the body-organism can
assimilate food-elements. The sleeping
dog, in its coma, does not eat, but it
breathes. The air it breadies contains in
itself and in its carbon dioxid and water-
vapor all the vital food-elements of ox-
ygen, nitrogen, carbon and hydrogen.
These elements are assimilated thus from
the breathed air by the body-organism at
a tremendous rate, cells forming into
tissue and bone at incredible speed, build-
ing up a body several times the size of
the normal body.

  "If the opposite compound were in*
jetted, it would slow the secretion of the
pituitary gland, and with that vital func-
tion almost halted the body would begin
to throw off its own tissues with immense
speed. By the familiar waste-processes of
exhalation of air and perspiration it would
throw off matter from itself at an un-
heard-of rate until it had reached a size
consonant with the reduced functioning
of its vital gland. If that compound were
injected the.dog would wake from its
coma of a day to find itself but a fifth or
sixth of its normal size. That the whole
process would work in exactly the same

way with a human being I have no doubt
whatever.”

  Russell shook his head. "And you’ve
really made those compounds? You’ve
actually tested them on animals?”

  "Of course—and with very great suc-
cess. But that success will have to be
complete before I can publish.”

  "It seems like something out of fairy-
tales,” the younger man commented. "Of
course I don’t doubt your word—but to
make a living thing greater or smaller in
size—it’s one of those things you’d have
to see to believe.”

  Garland laughed, relighting his cig-
arette. "Simple enough,” he said. "I’ll
show you something over in the labora-
tory tomorrow that will make you believe.
I could show you tonight, but I’m afraid
your dreams would be rather night-
marish.”

  "Speaking of dreams makes me realize
that I’m half into them now,” said Rus-
sell, yawning. "I don’t know why I feel

so sleepy tonight-”

  "The usual effect of scientific dis-
course,” commented Garland. "Don’t
apologize—I’m used to it—my classrooms
were veritable halls of Morpheus when I
got well into a lecture.”

  "Much more likely it’s the effect of my
tough time today,” replied Russell, laugh-
ing. "That same room’s mine for to-
night? Well, I hope I’ll be wakeful
enough by morning to look at your
experiment.”

  "Don’t worry, you will be,” retorted
the other smilingly. "You’re the first
society I’ve had for a week, and as such
you can’t hope to escape without being
bored mercilessly!”

Russell found himself stretching and
. yawning hugely as he prepared to re-
tire, and it seemed to him that his head
180

WEIRD TALES

no sooner rested on the pillow than he
was slipping into sleep. He half-heard a
scratching and scurrying somewhere in the
room’s wall or floor, but was on the last
rim of consciousness by then, and in an-
other moment had drifted off it into
dreamless slumber.

  When he came back to wakefulness
his first sensation was of a strange
tingling in all his body, accompanied by
a recurring nausea. He stirred, rubbed his
eyes, sat up, his movements seeming odd-
ly clumsy to him. He opened his eyes,
blinking, looking around him with an
irritated incomprehension that in a mo-
ment more had changed to stupefaction.
His heart leapt uncontrollably.

  He was not in bed in the room where
he had retired, but was resting, quite un-
clothed, upon a thick mass of folded
cloths that made a small pallet. It rested
directly on the floor, but the floor itself
was of smooth glass that was apparently
immensely thick. And all around Russell
there rose the gleaming walls of a great
glass room, illuminated by clear sunlight.

  He staggered to his feet, uttering an
inarticulate cry. For almost a score of
feet above him, apparently, rose the foot-
thick glass walls. In them was no door or
window or opening of any kind. They
came to an end above with the glass
room’s ceiling or roof quite open and
roofless. Russell stumbled to the glass
wall of his strange prison and gazed
dazedly through it.

  Another hoarse cry came from him, for
he was gazing out upon a scene that
seemed at the same time unutterably
familiar yet unutterably strange and
grotesque. The great glass room seemed
to rest upon a long gleaming platform
of burnished metal, scores of feet in
width and hundreds in length. Upon it

there rested here and there objects famil-
iar in shape, metal and glass beakers and
retorts, balance-scales and microscope,
but all of size gigantic. The microscope’s
great tube loomed for twice Russell’s
height into the air! He could have hid-
den in the beakers!

  He swayed to another of his glass
prison’s four walls. From it the view
was different—a window a short distance
from the glass wall. But the window was
colossal in size, too, on a scale with the
microscope and beakers! Through it he
made out the fiery disk of the descending
sun, and against it outside swung branches
that seemed of trees huge beyond all
experience!

  Russell, strange sounds in his throat,
reached another wall, and saw that from
it the view was one of a room, a colossal
room of cathedral proportions but rectan-
gular in shape, with white walls and
ceiling and with huge tables and chairs
several times his own height ranged
along it. And it was on the metal top of
one such enormous table that his square
glass prison rested!

  There came to his giving brain a flash
of vague remembrance and comprehen-
sion—Garland’s talk of the night before
—Garland’s calm statement of his
powers—and Russell, his mind sub-
merged in horror, sank to the gleaming
floor.

  Into his stunned brain in the nexr
instant penetrated a great clicking and
clashing sound from the distance that
brought him to his feet in a bound. One
of the great doors at the vast room’s end
had swung suddenly open and there had
stepped inside an appalling figure. A
man colossal! Between thirty and forty
feet into the air he seemed to loom, a
giant who came toward Russell’s glass
PIGMY ISLAND

181

prison with thundering tread. And it was
Garland! Garland—his eyes keen with
interest as he bent over the glass en-
closure. As his huge head loomed over
the glass room’s open top Russell could
only stare upward, paralyzed. Then he
saw the great lips moving and there came
down to him the rumbling thunder that
was Garland’s voice.

tcT promised to show you something
JL that would make you believe in my
work, Russell,” he was saying. "Well,
behold that something—yourself!”

  "Garland, damn you!” Russell was
sobbing in his rage and terror. "What
have you done to me? Made me like this

—	made a pigmy — out of a human
being!”

  The scientist’s vast laugh thundered.
"Don’t take it so hard, Russell. You’re
not the first one to find yourself a foot in
height—Wallace and Lowerman and the
others of my esteemed co-workers are no
larger than you, so you’re not alone."

  "Wallace-” Russell almost forgot

his own terrible situation in that revela-
tion. ""Then Wallace and the others—
you did the same-”

  "The same as to you,” the great voice
rumbled. It became suddenly again
thunderous. “Do you think that I would
restrict my theory always to animals and
never try working it out on men? Men—
the mere raw material of experimentation,
to me! So many guinea-pigs to aid test-
tube and microscope in the search for
truth!” His great eyes burned.

  “I perfected the two compounds two
weeks ago, Russell. I drugged the other
five, Wallace and Snelling and Lowerman
and Johnson and Hall. I injected the
gland-depressant compound, the size-de-
creasing compound, into the neck-arteries
while they lay in that drugged sleep. Of

course it would have been just as easy to
use the other compound, but I knew too
well what their reactions would be when
they woke to try making the unsuspecting
subjects of my experiment giants!

  "Through the next score of hours the
bodies of the five shrank almost visibly
before me, their tissues disintegrating
and being thrown off at a terrific rate. I
brought them here to the laboratory
when they had ceased shrinking, each a
pigmy man hardly a foot in height, like
you. I had prepared a crude prison for
them and meant to use the size-increas-
ing compound on them when they woke.
That way, you see, I could test it also
without danger of making them large
enough to be formidable to myself. They
were dazed and crazy with rage and all
that when they woke, of course, just as
you are, but I counted on making the
second test even if against their will. So
many guinea-pigs, to me!

  "But they escaped, damn them! My
prison for them had been too crude and
they got away in the night, got down one
of die rat-holes in the laboratory here and
have been lurking around and under the
place ever since. You heard them last
night at the door? I hope the rats get
them, and they surely will in time — a
foot-high man is no match for a full-
grown rat or snake, I assure you.

  "But I had to have another subject to
go on with the experiment, and fate sent
me you, Russell. I would have swum out
into that surf to rescue you if you hadn’t
got ashore, I wanted you so badly to
work on. Well, you ought to know the
rest. You were so sleepy because your
food was drugged last night, and in the
twenty-odd hours since then you’ve had
the size-decreasing compound in your
pituitary, have been shrinking in size
182

WEIRD TALES

every minute until you’re the magnificent
pigmy proof of my work that you now
are. And now I can give the other com-
pound, the size-increasing one, its final
tests on you.”

  As Garland spoke he placed on the
table and opened a narrow black case. It
held two six-inch glass tubes, one filled
with a bright red liquid and the other
with a brilliant green one, and also a
hypodermic needle of odd design.

  Russell was raging futilely at the great
head bent above him. "Garland—you
fiend! You’re mad—mad!”

  Garland was calmly withdrawing the
liquid-tubes from their case. "Quite pos-
sibly,” he admitted. "Madness and genius
are so closely akin that no one has ever
been able to mark their exact dividing-
line. Are all madmen merely geniuses of
an order incomprehensible to us? An
interesting thought.”

  "But you’ll go no farther in your in-
sane experiments with me!” cried Russell.

  "You’ll do well to remember, Russell,
that on me depends your one chance of
regaining your normal size. I make no
promises, but-”

  Russell shook his hand grotesquely
toward the looming giant face. "No—
I’ll die this way first, Garland! You’ve
made a pigmy, a monster, of me—but
you’ll get no chance to go farther with
your devilish work on me!”

  Garland slipped the liquid-tubes im-
perturbably back into the case. "Quite
illogical,” he remarked. "I’ll give you
until morning, Russell, and if you’re still
so obstinate I think I can bring you to
terms. A few large spiders put in with
you—they’d seem rather terrible in size
and ferocity to you. Really, it would be
amusing. You’d better think k over, and

lest you have any hope of getting away

as the others did-”

  He drew over the top of the square
glass box a sheet of heavy wire-screen
that he fastened tightly over the box’s top
by means of projecting hasps, through
which ran a chain held by a small strong
padlock. Fastened thus it formed a
strong lattice-work secured over the box’s
top. With it in place Garland grasped
the black case.

  "Until the morning, Russell——”
Russell, leaning weakly against the
glass wall of his prison, saw Garland’s
huge form passing down the laboratory,
case in hand, and departing through the
door he closed behind him.

Eft alone, Russell crouched for some
f moments in silence, unmoving. The
sun was sinking outside, he saw, for its
level rays were fading and dusk was
beginning to thicken in the laboratory’s
corners. There came to Russell dim
memory of the sunset—how long before?
—that had seen him struggling through
the surf toward this island of horror. He
strove to think calmly, but his thoughts
dissolved with each attempt into un-
reasoning horror.

  He rose, paced along the wall of his
glass cage, then with sudden crazy im-
pulse flung himself against it. The im-
pact left him bruised and breathless. He
lay for some time panting, the shadows
in the laboratory deepening as night came
outside. Through an opposite window, *
though, an intensifying flood of silver
moonlight was pouring into the long
room, so vast to his diminished per-
ceptions.

  Russell looked up to where the heavy
screen that Garland had fastened over
his glass prison gleamed dully in the
moonlight. It seemed more than twenty
PIGMY ISLAND

183

feet over his head, and it took but a few
futile leaps to convince him that all hope
of touching it even was futile. The
smooth and perpendicular glass walls
gave no slightest hold and there was
nothing in his transparent cell to aid him
in climbing. There was nothing, in fact,
but the thick mass of dark cloth on which
he had lain. Russell tore from it enough
of the stuff to make a clumsy tunic which
he tied around him. The garment com-
forted him oddly.

  He sat down at last, his hope waning,
vanishing. Even were he to escape from
his prison, Russell told himself, only
Garland and his size-increasing com-
pound could release him from the more
terrible prison of his pigmy size. Only
Garland—and he knew without shadow
of doubt that whatever promises Garland
might make, he would never permit him
to leave the island alive, much less re-
gain his normal stature.

  Russell sat on with dull horror and
hopelessness gnawing his mind, unheed-
ful of the moonlight that was brilliant
nOw in the laboratory. It picked out
things here and there, the flange of the
microscope, the handle of a tool, the
pans of the balances—and made them
shine dazzlingly. To his ears there came
no sound from outside, and Russell was
only aware of how deep was the silence
in the laboratory, when it was broken
finally by a sound.

  It was an odd scratching sound from
the laboratory’s floor, beneath the shadow
of one of the tables. Russell listened in-
tently.

  The sound came again, stopped, and
then he heard light, hesitant footsteps.
He rose and sprang silently to the wall of
his glass cell, gazing into the laboratory.
At first he saw nothing unusual: then his

eye caught a movement and he saw that
out from the shadow of the great table
opposite were cautiously advancing two
figures. They were men, two pigmy men
of the same foot-high stature as himself!

  They were quite visible in the bright
moonlight, gazing cautiously around. Both
were dressed in rough, tunic-like gar-
ments not unlike his own, and both car-
ried what seemed long, metal-pointed
spears. They halted, and Russell saw
them gazing up toward his glass prison.
He almost uttered a shout but changed
it in time to a loud hiss. At the sibilant
call the two waved quickly, as though
glimpsing him, and then were running
away beneath him, along the laboratory'
floor and out of sight.

  Russell's heart was pounding. Had
the two fled? For a moment in which his
heart sank he thought so; then he saw
them again.

   Far along his great table a chair stood
close to its edge, and the two were clam-
bering up with some difficulty onto this.
Grasping rungs and leg, they pulled
themselves up until they were on the
chair’s seat. Then they were at the harder
task of climbing up one of the rungs of
the back toward the table’s level. Rus-
sell saw them toiling upward, the corru-
gations of the rung helping them, until
they were level with the table’s top, a few
inches from diem. They clung to the
rung an instant, then leaped.

  They struck the table’s metal top and
collapsed in a heap, but almost at once
were up and hastening along the table
toward his prison. As they came closer he
saw that one was young, his own age,
and the other somewhat older, both
dark-haired and unshaven men. The
Spears they carried were in fact slender
wooden rods about eight to ten inches in
184

WEIRD TALES

length, to the end of each of which had
been bound with fine wire, a small, sharp-
pointed nail. These were, for the foot-
high men, heavy and formidable weapons.

  The two came to the glass wall,
peered inside at him. He opened his
mouth to call to them but one shook his
head warningly. Russell was silent, watch-
ing them with pulse throbbing.

  They conversed with each other in low
whispers, pointing first to the thickness
of the glass wall and then toward the
heavy screen fastened over the box’s top.
At last one hurried off along the table,
searching for something, while the other
began to uncoil a roll of what seemed
strong rope rolled around his body. It
was in reality a length of ordinary twine.
By the time he had it uncoiled and had
knotted it here and there the other had
returned, a short piece of steel wire in
his grasp.

  The two grasped it and with a great
effort bent it into the form of a hook. In
a moment they had tied the twine-rope to
it; then the older of the two whirled the
shining hook around his head and sent it
hurtling upward. It curved down and
fell upon the-lattice-screen over the glass
box, was dragged along it for a moment,
then suddenly caught in one of the
screen’s openings. At once the younger of
the two was climbing upward by the
knots, the other holding the rope steady
beneath.

  Russell saw the climber gain the top
and inspect quickly the chain-fastening
and lock that secured the screen over the
glass cell. After a moment he whispered
down to the man below. The latter tied
one of his spears to the rope, and in an-
other instant the one above had it in his
hands. He inserted it in one of the
screen’s openings, pried and levered this

way and that until he had made an open-
ing a few inches across. Russell was
watching tensely.

  Then the man above drew up the rope
from outside and let it fall down through
this opening into the glass cell’s interior.
His whispered order was not needed, for
in an instant Russell had grasped the rope
and was climbing. He reached the top,
balanced beside the other on the glass
wall’s edge, panting.	. , -,

  "You’re Garland’s new experiment?”
the other was whispering hoarsely.
"You’re the man who came yesterday—
that Garland used the compound on?”
Russell panted his name. "And you?”
"I’m Snelling,” the other whispered,
"and that’s Lowerman down there. Did
you hear of us? I thought Garland might
have told you when you woke. We saw
you come with him yesterday—we did our
best to warn you, but couldn’t. There are
Wallace and Johnson and Hall, besides us
two. Garland’s experiments—pigmies,
all of us. The others are waiting for you
now.”	1 • '

  Russell struggled for reason; "But

where-?”

  "Down beneath the laboratory,” Snel-
ling whispered. "We have a place there
—we use the rat-holes and runways to
get about—and Wallace sent us after you

—has a plan-”

  There was a warning hiss from the
waiting figure beneath, and Snelling
pulled Russell toward the wall’s edge,
drew up and let down the rope again
upon the outer side of the wall. Russell
slid down it, the other close after him.

  Lowerman hastened to their side, his
haggard and unshaven face clear in the
moonlight. He grasped Russell’s hands.

  "We’ve got to get down to the others
at once,” he told him in a tense whisper.
PIGMY ISLAND

185

"There’s not much time left, and we only
have until morning.”

  "Until morning?” repeated the dazed
Russell, and Lowerman nodded swiftly.

  "It’s Wallace’s plan—he’ll tell you
about it—but we’ve got to get out of here
now. You have the rope, Snelling? Good
—there’s no time to lose-”

Russell found himself hastening along
. the long metal surface of table
gleaming in the moonlight, with Lower-
man and Snelling on either side of him.
It came to his dazed brain to appreciate
for a moment the utter grotesqueness of
it—that he, a pigmy of twelve inches
height, should run with two others like
him along the surface of a table! A sen-
sation of unreality held him until they
came to the spot where the chair stood
beside the table, its back-rungs a few
inches away.

  Lowerman, without hesitating, jumped
for the nearest or corner rung and grasped
it, clinging at the same time to his spear,
sliding down to the chair’s seat. Russell
followed, grasping the rung with all his
strength, lowering himself to the seat
also. Snelling was but an instant behind
him, and already Lowerman was clamber-
ing down from the seat to the floor. In
another minute they all stood there.

  Without hesitating, the other two hur-
ried Russell across the floor, a vast wooden
plain to his eyes, and into the lightless
shadow beneath the great opposite table.
They reached the wall, fumbled along its
juncture with the floor, until Lowerman’s
whisper indicated that he had found what
he sought. As Russell’s eyes became a
little accustomed to the darkness beneath
the table he saw that Lowerman and
Snelling had brought him to a round,
ragged hole that had apparently been
gnawed through the wooden strip at the

wall’s base. It was in reality, he knew,
but a few inches across, but seemed to
him that many feet.

  Lowerman had already stooped, was
wriggling through the hole and disap-
pearing into the still deeper darkness
inside. His whisper came out to Russell
but the latter shrank back. Snelling,
though, grasped his shoulder.

  "It’s the only way, Russell. Straight on
—we’ve used these rat-holes for the last
two weeks.”

  Russell mastered his instinctive terror,
stooped and wriggled through also. He
found himself in darkness absolute, and
felt in a moment the touch of Lowerman’s
hands. A scraping sound told him that
Snelling was beside them.

  There was a loud scratch and splutter
and a bright light flamed abruptly beside
him. Lowerman held in his hand what
seemed a short wooden cane burning
brightly at one end. It was only when
he suddenly remembered his own present
pigmy size that Russell recognized the
burning cane as an ordinary match.

  The flame illuminated the place in
which they stood, the interior of the wall.
It seemed a narrow long hall whose walls
towered up to colossal heights into the
darkness above. Lowerman had fumbled
for something on the floor, producing
finally a crudely shaped and thick little
piece of candle. With the great match he
lit it, and as its light replaced that of the
expiring match he motioned Russell on-
ward. With Lowerman leading, holding
the lighted candle-piece, they started
along the vast-walled narrow corridor
that was the wall’s interior. Russell
fought against his sense of utter unreality
as they went forward.

  They moved on until Russell estimated
that they must be approaching the corner
186

WEIRD TALES

of the wall. He wondered whither
Lowerman was leading. He wondered-

  "Snelling—back!”

  As Lowerman’s tense whisper hissed,
the three sprang back as though plucked
by a great hand. Russell heard from
ahead a strange rushing, loping sound,
then a confused deep squeaking grunt
that froze his blood. Lowerman had
thrust the candle-piece into his hands,
had sprung forward with Snelling, their
spears level! Russell glimpsed one—or
was it two?—great dark shapes ahead of
them, just beyond the range of the can-
dle’s light, saw the gleam of quick eyes;
then a swift rush of feet as the things
sprang.

  There were two of them, twin mon-
strous shapes that Russell could not recog-
nize as rats despite his brain’s assurance.
Fully half his own height they towered,
with bodies as long as he was high, great
fur-clad monsters whose eyes were
gleaming and whose open jaws were
white-fanged and snarling as they sprang.
He felt the impact of their rush, saw
Snelling go down and Lowerman
knocked to his knees as they thrust at the
onrushing beasts with their spears.

  One of the huge rats squealed as
Lowerman’s long nail spearhead sank to
its depth into its body. Russell glimpsed
Lowerman, braced against the floor,
thrusting the spear deeper into the thing
as its great furry body flexed and stiffened
convulsively against the wall. But Snell-
ing was down beneath the other, the great
jaws at his throat. Russell, a madness
of combat on him, threw himself for-
ward, thrust the lighted candle in his
hand against the beast’s side.

  There was a sickening smell of burnt
hair and flesh instantly and the beast
whirled with a squealing snarl upon Rus-

sell. He dodged sidewise, felt the needle-
pain of fangs closing on his thigh, then
felt those fangs unclosing almost instant-
ly. He staggered up, saw that Snelling
and Lowerman were driving their already
bloody spears again and again into the
second rat’s body. As Russell stumbled to
his feet the great rat lay still, its paws
slowly closing and unclosing. Russell felt
Lowerman and Snelling at his side, found
himself laughing weakly.

  "Fighting with rats in a wall! Fighting
death-combats with rats inside a wall!”

  "Steady, Russell!” Lowerman clutched
his shoulder. "We’ve got to go on—your
leg’s not hurt bad?”

  Russell shook his head weakly. "It
didn’t have even a good hold on me. But
let’s go on, then—for God’s sake Jer's
go on!”

  "Rats—more bold every day-”

Snelling was panting as they hurried for-
ward again. "Not afraid now of the
candle-fire, even—almost took Johnson’s
arm off two days ago-”

  "Down here, Russell,” Lowerman
directed.

  They had come to a gnawed aperture
in the wooden bottom of the wall. Lower-
man dropped through it, Russell handed
down the candle, and then followed with
Snelling.

  He found himself in another corridor,
but one whose walls were of damp earth.
It was narrow, and only by stooping could
they go forward in it. Widi Lowerman
ahead and Snelling behind again he
moved along it. The corridor twisted and
turned to right and left, and here and
there was crossed by other earth-tunnels.
Before coming to each of diese crossings
they waited, listening, before venturing
ahead.	1
PIGMY ISLAND

187

The earthen tunnel twisted onward
and at last Lowerman and Snelling
turned with him into a branching cor-
ridor. This, ended abruptly in a blank
earth wall, in which was a single round
opening that seemed a few feet across.

  Lowerman extinguished their candle
and as he did so Russell saw' that through
the opening from beyond came a faint
yellow light. They crawled through the
opening, and he found himself in a fairly
large den hollowed in the black earth. It
was illuminated by an ordinary candle
burning at its center, one that seemed of
enormous size to the pigmy Russell.

  Around this candle, less than twice its
height, three men awaited them. All were
as unshaven and haggard of face as
Lowerman and Snelling. One was big
and white of hair, older than the others.
Another had his shoulder tied in crude
cloth bandages. Against the den’s walls
leaned several of the nail-head spears,
some rude couches of cloth and grass,
some scraps of food and candle. The
smells of damp earth and smoke in the
place were almost overpowering.

  The white-haired man had grasped
Russell’s hand. "I hoped Lowerman and
Snelling could bring you,” he was saying
quickly. "We dared not all venture up—

Garland’s laid so many traps for us-”

  Russell dazedly returned the handclasp.

"Then you’re—you’re-”

  "Wallace—Dr. Fairfield Wallace. I
am, or was, head of this research station.
This is Hall here, and this Johnson—he
had a pretty bad time of it with a rat in
one of the runways, but he’s getting better
now.”

  They crouched down around the can-
dle. Until he died Russell would not for-
get that scene—their six pigmy figures
around the looming candle whose light

flickered across the damp earth walls of
the subterranean den and on the drawn
faces of his companions. Wallace was
leaning tensely toward him.

  "Russell, your name is? Russell, we've
got little time. Garland is mad. He is a
mad genius of science, if there can be
such a thing. He worked for years on his
gland compounds, his size-changing com-
pounds, until they have become a mania
or obsession with him. His great aim was
to try the compounds on human beings
and that’s why he got us to establish our
research station on diis isolated island,
though we never guessed it at the time.
And once here he drugged us and in-
jected the size-decreasing compound into
us all just as he drugged you and injected
it into you, making pigmies of us as he
has of you.

  "We found ourselves pigmies and we
were in horror of what further fiendish
experiments he might carry out on us, so
we managed to escape and get down into
this maze of rat-runways under the lab-
oratory and bungalow. The things we've
seen and done here in these last two
weeks! Russell, back home I have a
house, a family, a position in the scientific
world. And I’m here hiding from rats
and snakes, fighting spiders, hunting bats
to kill for food!

  "But no more of that. Our one aim
in these two weeks has been to get the red
size-increasing compound of Garland’s
that alone can restore us to our normal
size. He colored the two compounds red
and green to distinguish between them,
and the red one alone can ever bring us
back from pigmies to men. And Garland
knows that!

  "He knows that our one aim is to get
the red compound and he has taken care
that we should not do so. The only sup-
188 ,

ply of it is in the tube which he carries
with the other compound and his needle
in that small black case. That case never
leaves his person. And each night Gar-
land has locked himself securely in his
bedroom in the bungalow, with the com-
pound-case. There’s no hope of getting
the case from him while he’s awake, of
course, for in our pigmy size he could
kill all of us with a blow. Our one
hope is to steal the case while he sleeps.

  "In the last week we have been bur-
rowing up through the wall toward his
bedroom. We have a runway now lead-
ing up from one of the rat-tunnels be-
neath the bungalow to his bedroom
wall, and we’ve only a thin surface of
plaster left to break through now. So
tonight—now—we’re going to try it, go-
ing to break through into his room and
try stealing the case. If Garland dis-
covers us it means death for us all, of
course. But on the other hand only that
single tube of red liquid will ever bring
us back to normal stature. Are you go-
ing to try it with us?”

  Russell drew a long breath. His brain
seemed spinning. "I’m with you, of
course,” he said at last. "You’re going
to try it—now?”

  "Now,” Wallace affirmed. "We’ve
got to make the attempt before Garland
wakes, and it will take us some time to
get from here over into the bungalow
and up inside his room’s wall.”

  They all stood up. Wallace gave
quick orders to the others and they be-
gan crawling out of the cavity into the
corridor or rat-tunnel outside. Wallace
handed to Russell one of the heavy spears
with its nail head.

  "These wouldn’t do us any good
against Garland, God knows,” he said,

"but they help us against the rats and
others.”

  "We go through the rat-tunnels to the
bungalow?” Russell asked, but the other
shook his head.

  "No, just through them to the surface
and then over to the bungalow and into
its own tunnels. There is a perfect war-
ren of them beneath these two buildings.”

They crawled out after the others
and stood in the rat-tunnel, with
Lowerman and Hall carrying candles
whose flickering light feebly illuminated
the earth-walled corridor. At once and
without words they set forth along it, but
in an opposite direction from that by
which Russell had come. To Russell it
all was dream-like, by then—the flicker-
ing-lit low earth-tunnel they followed,
their little band of rough-garbed, spear-
armed men, the desperate venture that
took them forward.

  The tunnel wound this way and that.
Lowerman led with one candle and Hall
brought up the rear with the other. Once
Snelling jabbed forth his spear to pin
to the earth floor a great thing that had
been scuttling sidewise, a dark many-
legged shape that seemed of octopus size
to Russell and that he only recognized
after a moment as a big spider. Once,
too, as they crossed another tunnel, there
writhed in front of them a thick long
snake-like thing that they passed unheed-
ingly—a great earthworm.

  The tunnel curved upward, and the
going became harder, its roof still so low
as to keep them stooping in it. In mo-
ments there came to Russell over the
fumes of damp earth a breath of cleaner
air. He glimpsed a round starlit open-
ing ahead and above.

  They were within a few yards of it,
seemingly, when it was blocked by a dark
PIGMY ISLAND

189

shape rushing in from outside. With-
out a word Snelling and Wallace and
Lowerman had rushed forward with ready
spears. There was a grunt and click of
jaws, a threshing that dwindled sudden-
ly, and before the dazed Russell could
more than realize that another huge rat
had rushed into the corridor from out-
side, the three were beckoning them on,
panting and with their spears bloody.
Russell followed them sickly over the big,
still, furry body.

  The candles were extinguished and
they came out into open air. Russell
found that they were standing in grass,
whose great blades towered above their
heads all around them. He made out
the dark looming expanse of a gigantic
wall behind them, realized that it was
the side of the laboratory building up
from beneath which they had come.
Ahead, just visible above the grass-tops,
loomed another wall.

  They had halted, and Wallace point-
ed toward it. "The bungalow!” he
whispered to Russell. "Go quiet now,
Russell——”

  They started forward through the
grass.; It was like forcing through a
thicket of huge vegetation, as they strug-
gled onward through the towering blades.
The wall of the bungalow loomed slowly
closer as they went on.

  They halted once as a giant winged
thing that seemed of airplane size went
by just above them with a whir of wings.
A. bat or bird of some kind, Russell
knew. He caught himself glancing at the
stars as they fought on through the grass,
wondering if ever before they had looked
down on such a scene as this of their
pigmy band and its progress.

  There came suddenly from Johnson,
at the side of their little band, a low,

tense whisper, and he pointed to the
right with his unbandaged arm. They
all froze motionless, silent.

  Russell, heart pounding, saw that to
the right and ahead the towering grass
blades were stirred by a nearing commo-
tion, parting this way and that. There
was a dry, slithering sound coming near-
er. Then he saw what it was that ap-
proached. A snake. A huge snake that
was to their eyes more than a score of
feet in length, between one and two feet
in thickness. It was gliding through the
great grass slantwise across their path.

  The starlight showed clear to Russell
as it neared the enormous flexing and un-
flexing length of the snaky body, the tri-
angular head and great jewel-like eyes.
He strove to tell himself that the thing
was but an ordinary snake made mon-
strous to them by their own pigmy size.
He could only watch it with the others
as it glided nearer. It did not see
them, but glided past and vanished in
the tall grass behind them. Russell was
not aware of what horror was shaking
him until he felt Wallace’s steadying
hand on his shoulder. He stumbled on
with the others.

  The great dark wall of the bungalow
was closer, and as they went on through
the great grass they changed their course,
heading toward one of the building’s cor-
ners. Beneath a thicket of shrubs near
that corner they halted. A burrow-like
opening in the earth yawned blackly be-
neath them.

  Already Snelling and Lowerman were
dropping into it. Russell followed with
Wallace, heard the other two coming
after them. They were in darkness until
a match flared and spluttered to reveal
another rat-runway like those beneath
the laboratory. The candles were lit and
190

WEIRD TALES

they started along it. To Russell, his
brain already dazed, the earth walls
around them made it seem that their
minutes of progress through the towering
grasses in the open air was but a dream-
like interlude.

  The tunnel twisted upward. They
came to a great solid wood barrier over
their heads, a round hole gnawed
through it. When they had pulled them-
selves up through it they stood in the
interior of a wall, a narrow and towering-
walled corridor like that other laboratory
wall whose interior Russell had come
through. The little band went along this
and then after a few moments turned
into another narrow wall-corridor open-
ing at right angles from the one they
followed. They clambered over obstruc-
tions until they came to a place where
wood and plaster alike had been hacked
out and a tiny hole pierced through the
thin surface of plaster remaining on the
wall’s other side. At once the candles
were extinguished.

  Wallace drew their heads close. "This
is Garland’s room,” he whispered.
"We’ve worked for days to dig through
this wall, Russell. Don’t make a sound
now until we have a look.”

  He turned back to the tiny opening in
the plaster and peered through it. He
motioned then to Russell.

   "He’s asleep, all right,” he whispered.
"And the case—look!”

  Russell peered through the opening.
He saw a room like that which he had
occupied in the bungalow on the preced-
ing night—centuries before, it seemed—
dimly lit by the thin starlight from the
window, with a few chests and articles of
furniture and a simple cot. On the cot
stretched an unmoving figure, breathing
regularly in sleep — the figure of Gar-

land, gigantic to his eyes. And on a loW'
table beside the cot—his heart bounded
—the black case that held the two com-
pounds!

  "We’ll try it now!” Wallace whispered.
"If we can steal that case and get away
before he wakes-”

  "Enlarge the opening now?” Snelling
asked, his spear poised.

  Wallace nodded. "But quietly, for
God’s sake.”

Snelling and Hall began to dig.silent-
ly at the plaster around the opening,
chipping it away with their heavy spears.
It seemed iron-hard, but bit by bit they
broke loose little fragments of it, en-
larging the opening. Once a fragment
fell outside and rattled on the room’s
floor, a foot or two beneath the opening.
They all were silent and unmoving, but
the regular, loud breathing of Garland
continued.

  At last they had chipped away an op-
ening large enough to permit their pas-
sage through it. Snelling went first,
sliding down to the floor with spear in
hand and catching and steadying the oth-
ers as they too descended. Johnson was
last, half falling. They stood upon the
floor, a group of six pigmy figures but a
third the height of the great wooden
chest that loomed beside them.

  They started silently across the room
toward the low bedside table. Russell,
his breathing strangely tight, found him-
self carrying his spear poised, his eyes
on the sleeping, huge figure on the cot.
The absurdity of it came home to him—
the thought that with the tiny ten-inch
spear he could kill that enormous figure.
But they were almost beneath the low
table now—his heart drumming with ex-
citement—the eyes of the others brilliant
PIGMY ISLAND

191

with hope—the table—the case—the
case-

  A cry from Snelling, and they leapt
back, but too late! The huge motionless
form of Garland on the cot had sprung
into sudden activity, had leapt to the
wall and with a single shove of his giant
arm had pushed the great chest against
the wall, covering the hole by which they
had entered, blocking their retreat! Gar-
land’s hand found the,switch and far
overhead in the ceiling flared the sun-
like lamps, flooding the room with light.
And Garland, a forty-foot giant to their
eyes, confronted the six pigmy figures,
fully dressed, a gleaming pistol in his
hand!

  His laugh rumbled down to them like
thunder. "So you came at last!’’ he
jeered. "Wallace—Lowerman—all of
you—and even you too, Russell, escaped,
I see. I knew you would come—sooner
or later!

  "You thought your burrowing through
the wall quite unobserved, eh? You dolts!
You might have known that I was quite
aware of it, and only let you go on be-
cause I knew that you would be coming
in here to steal the compounds, and that
I need only wait to trap you here!

  "And trapped you are—trapped like
rats to die the death of rats! Do you re-
member how we used to shoot at the rats
with our pistols when we first came here?
Well, the next few minutes ought to be
just as amusing, with you six taking the
place of the rats. I can get other arid
more tractable subjects for my experi-
ments, I think. And as for you six, you

can now-” His arm came up with

the pistol.

  Wallace cried to the others as their
six pigmy figures sprang back beneath
the table’s shadow. "Snelling—Hall:—

get to his ankles—try to trip him—our
only chance-!”

  Snelling and Hall sprang beneath the
shadow of the immense cot just as there
came a terrific detonation across the great
room, and a smashing and splintering of
the floor beside them as the great bullet
crashed into it. The gigantic Garland,
laughing in crazy amusement and not no-
ticing the running two figures beneath the
cot, sent another bullet into the floor in
front of them as they leapt to escape the
first. Russell saw Johnson trip as they
recoiled again beneath the table, and
dragged him with him an instant before
another great bullet dug the floor at that
spot.

  The scene was fantastic, out of night-
mare! The vast room, the colossal shape
of Garland with pistol in hand, the mas-
sive leaden missiles that crashed at them.
They made for the shelter of the cot but
threw themselves back only in time to es-
cape another bullet which sent clouds of
great splinters over them. Lowerman,
struck by a flying splinter, was knocked
flat, and Russell saw Garland’s giant arm
train the pistol on him. But he saw too
the foot-high figures of Snelling and
Hall racing out from the shadow beside
Garland to stab furiously at his ankles
with their spears! Garland stumbled, his
fifth shot going wild. He started to whirl
around to stamp upon the two pigmy fig-
ures beneath him but they had gripped
his ankles and he tripped, fell, his body
across the room with head near the other
four pigmy men, pistol flying from his
grasp as he struck the floor.

  Instantly the four foot-high men were
upon him, clambering toward his throac
with spears fiercely outthrust. The bat-
tle of Gulliver and the Lilliputians re-
enacted, it flashed through Russell’s brain
192

WEIRD TALES

as he drove forward with his spear. But
Garland, a vast bellow of rage coming
from him, was scrambling up, his flailing
enormous arms knocking them this way
and that. Russell felt himself whirling
across the floor as a flailing arm struck
him, saw Garland rising to his feet, his
face crimson with rage. And Garland,
his crazy amusement dissolved into mad
fury now, was grasping a chair, whirling
it over his head to send it crashing down
on the scattered pigmy figures.

  Russell, staggering to his feet even as
Garland’s chair swung up, felt rather
than saw beside him a big metal shape,
the pistol that had slid from Garland’s
hand as the giant fell. To the foot-high
Russell the pistol was huge, but almost
without conscious exertion he had grasped
and lifted it, one arm encircling its great
butt and his other hand on its trigger as
he pointed it up like some clumsy big
rifle toward the giant Garland’s breast.
He was not aware that he had pulled the
trigger until the roar of the weapon
knocked him backward. There was si-
lence ....

  Garland swayed as though in stupid
surprize, the huge chair slipping from his
upraised hands and crashing to the floor
—swayed, a spreading red stain upon his
breast, until he too slumped and crashed
in thunderous fall to the floor.

  Russell was dazedly aware of voices
and running feet, of the others crowding
about him, weeping, sobbing, helping
him up. Wallace and Lowerman were
climbing to the low table, bearing down
from it the black case between them, the
six pigmy figures crowding round it as
it was opened with frantic haste. The
tubes of red and green compound—Wal-
lace was filling the big hypodermic nee-

                                                              ■*

die., the others supporting tube and needle
as the red compound filled the latter.
They crouched down near the room’s cen-
ter but away from the prostrate giant fig-
ure of Garland—and then Wallace and
the great needle—a stab of pain in Rus-
sell’s neck as it penetrated — and then
swift darkness—darkness—darkness ....

When Russell awoke, sunlight was
warm upon his face. He opened his
eyes, stirred, sat weakly up, nausea and
weariness infinite upon him. Around
him others were stirring. He looked
,about him dazedly, then with swift re-
membrance and comprehension. Wal-
lace and Lowerman and Snelling, John-
son and Hall, they all were stirring, wak-
ing like himself, in the crowded room
that seemed now not gigantic but small.
And beside them another figure that did
not stir—Garland! Garland—his dead
figure no larger in size than their own!

  They staggered to their feet, dazed
all by the transition from pigmy to
human stature once more. They were all
without clothing, and on the floor lay
the little rough tunics that had been theirs
as pigmies, and the absurdly little spears.
They groped out of the room after un-
locking the door, and groped into cloth-
ing in the other rooms, like men restored
suddenly from insanity to sanity. They
poured stumbling out of the bungalow
into the light of still another sunset, their
speech still incoherent.

  "The boat!” said Wallace thickly.
"Let’s get away—for God’s sake let’s get
away!” He halted suddenly. "But

first-”

He ran back into the bungalow, and
when he emerged disappeared into the
laboratory', then joined them. As they

while the somber black and white of
their escorts’ costumes furnished a pleas-
ing contrast and made the chiaroscuro of
color the more vivid.' Three of us—Jules
de Grandin, our host, Colonel Patrick
FitzPatrick, and I—sat on the front veran-
da and rocked comfortably in wide wicker
chairs, the ice in our tall glasses tinkling
pleasantly.

   "Mordieu, mes amis,” the little French-
man exclaimed enthusiastically, sucking
appreciatively from the twin straws in his
long glass,"c’est une scene tres charmante!
It is so—how do you say?—so—ah, mort
de ma vie, les belles creatures!” His gaze
rested on a pair of girls who paused mo-
mentarily beneath the luminous drops of
the crystal chandelier hanging from the
porch roof at the head of the stairs.

   Limned in vivid silhouette against the
background of smalt-blue sky and black-
green evergreens, the girls were oddly
alike, yet curiously unlike. Both were
gowned in green, tall and slender with
the modernly fleshless figure which simu-
lates boyishness more than femininity;
both had small, clear-carved features;
both wore their hair cut close at the back,
rather long and prettily waved at the
front; both possessed complexions of
milky whiteness, but one was yellow-
haired and violet-eyed, while the short-
shorn locks of the other were red as rose-
gold alloyed with Copper, and her eyes,
long, black-fringed and obliquing slight-
ly downward at their outer corners, were
green as moss-agate.

  "Parbleu,” the Frenchman swore de-
lightedly, "they are like a boutonniere—
she of the golden hair is like an asphodele
—a slender daffodil that sways and dances
in the evening breeze; while she of the
ruddy tresses, m or bleu, she is a poppy,

a glorious, glowing-red poppy to steal
men’s senses away, no less!”

  "Humph,” Colonel FitzPatrick re-
turned, "you’re nearer right than you
think, old-timer. She’s all of that, and
then some.”

  "Ah, you know her?” de Grandin
asked with interest.

  "Ought to,” FitzPatrick laughed. "The
yellow-haired one’s my daughter Joseph-
ine; the other’s my niece, Dolores. She’s
lived with us since she was a kid of ten,
and a queer lot she is, too.”

  "But certainly,” the Frenchman agreed
with a vigorous nod, "one with hair and-
eyes like hers could be no ordinary mortal.
She is a fee, a pixy out of some story-
book, a-”

  "I’m not so sure of that,” the other
interrupted with a chuckle. "Sometimes
I’ve thought her an imp out of quite a
different place. She’s been off to school—
so has Josephine—for the past two years;
but unless she’s changed a lot, some one’s
in for a bad time before she goes back.”
He paused a moment, drawing thought-
fully at his cigar, then: "They say Cleo-
patra and Helen of Troy, not to mention
Helen of Tyre, had hair of that odd,
metallic red; I’m inclined to credit the
legends. Dolores is the sort who’d go to
any lengths for a thrill. I can imagine
her on the throne of an Eastern despot
administering poison to her unsuspecting
lovers just to see ’em squirm as they died,
and having a few dozen assorted captives
disemboweled to find out what made ’em
tick. Pity, or even decent consideration
for others’ feelings just don’t exist when
her curiosity or convenience are con-
cerned.”

  The girls seemed engaged in some sort
of argument; the red-haired one striving
to interest the blond in some plan, the
DAUGHTER OF THE MOONLIGHT

yellow-haired girl stubbornly refusing. At
length, with a shrug betraying mingled
annoyance and resignation, the blond
girl gave in, and they passed toward the
dancing marquee arm in arm.

  "There you are,” FitzPatrick grumbled,
"never knew it to fail; Josephine’s got
plenty of will of her own where I’m con-
cerned—where any one else is, for that
matter—but Dolores can twist her round
her finger any time she wishes.”

  We rocked, smoked and cooled our-
selves with repeated orders from the club
steward’s stock, played several rubbers of
bridge, then returned to the porch for re-
freshments. By two o’clock the cars
began leaving the parking-lot, and by a
quarter of three the house and grounds
were all but deserted.

  "Confound it,” Colonel FitzPatrick
grumbled, "where the deuce are those
hare-brained girls? Don’t they know I’d
like to be home by daylight?”

  Interrogation of several homeward-
bound couples failed to elicit information
concerning the girls’ whereabouts, and
our host at last lost his temper. "Let’s
go round ’em up,” he proposed. "I’m
betting we’ll find ’em lallygagging with a
pair of shiny-haired sheiks in one of those
fool summer-houses!”

However well the Colonel knew his
women-folk, his prediction proved
at least half-way wrong before we had
walked a hundred yards from the club-
house. From a shaded bower of honey-
suckle, ideally adapted for the exchange
of youthful vows of undying affection,
the sound of a woman sobbing piteously
attracted our attention; as we approached,
the green gown and crocus-yellow hair of
Joisephine FitzPatrick told us half our
quest was over.

  "Why, Jo, what’s the matter?” Colonel
FitzPatrick asked as he paused beside his
daughter. His assumed bruskness evap-
orated as he saw her abject misery, and
real concern was in his voice as he con-
tinued: "Here all alone? Where’s Mar-
tin? I thought I saw him here tonight.”
"He was—he is—oh, I don’t know
where he is!” the girl returned with the
inconsistency of overmastering grief.
"He’s somewhere with Dolores, and—oh,

I wish I were dead!”

  "There' daughter, there,” FitzPatrick
patted the girl’s gleaming bare shoulder
with awkward tenderness, "tell Dad
about it. It can’t be so very bad. Why,
only last week Martin asked me for you,

and-”

  "That’s just it,” the girl interrupted
with a high, half-hysterical wail. "Dolores
knew he wanted me and I wanted him—■
she didn’t want him, really; she just
wanted to take him from me to show
she could do it. It’s always been so,
Daddy. When we were little girls she
always took the doll I loved the most, and
broke it when she tired of it. She beat me
for honors at school when she heard I
was out for the history prize; I never had
a beau she didn’t take away from me;
now she’s taken Martin, and—oh, Dad,

I never wanted anything in all my life as
I want him. Make her give him back!
She’ll take him as she took my dolls, and
—and she’ll break him when she tires
of him, too; she’ll never, never give himi
back to me. Oh, I hate her, I hate herP
"Now, Jo-” her father began awk-
wardly, but:

  "I know what you’re going to say!’8 i
she blazed. "You’re going to tell mej J
she’s an orphan, hasn’t any one to Iovei !
or care for her but us, and I must give ini

bccausc her father and mother are dead! j
She got away with everything I wanted j
most on those grounds when we were
children; but she shan’t have Martin, I
tell you; she shan’t! I love him and I
want him, and I won’t let her have him.
I’ll kill her first!”

   "Go get your things,” FitzPatrick inter-
rupted authoritatively. "I’ll bring Dolores
in—and Martin, too.” He turned away
with a stern, set face and tramped pur-
posefully toward the deeper shadow of
the evergreen grove.

  "Everything she says is true,” he con-
fided as we marched along. "Dolores
came to us when her parents were killed
in a railway accident in Virginia. She
was only ten then, and was the sole sur-
vivor of the wreck. Her father was my
younger brother; her mother—humph,
w'ell, none of us knew much of her. Jim
met her down South somewhere while he
was heading a surveying crew. Wrote us
all sorts of glowing letters about her, but
I never met her—Dad absolutely forbade
the match, you see, and when they were
married in spite of him, refused to see
either of them.' Jim got it in his head I
was opposed to it, too; so when Father
died and cut him out of his will, he’d
have nothing to do with me, wouldn’t
even answer my letters when I wrote and
offered to share the estate half and half
with him. Then he and Giatanas were
killed, and I took Dolores to live with us.
She’s co-legatee in my will with Joseph-
ine, and I’ve tried to be a father to her,
but—well, there have been times when I
thought I’d underwritten too big an
issue.”

  "Giatanas,” de Grandin repeated
softly. "An odd name for an American
woman, is it not, Monsieur? What was
her surname, if you recall?”

  "She didn’t have any, as far as I
know,” FitzPatrick returned. "That's
where the difficulties arose. She wasn’t
an American. She was a Spanish Gipsy,
the seventh daughter of the queen of the
tribe, who claimed to be a seeress, and all
that sort of tosh. Jim met her when his
crew came on their camp, and simply
went blotto over her at first glance. I
don’t know' much about the Gipsies, but
I’ve been told they’re not Christians. At
any rate, Giatanas and he were married
by the tribal rite, not by a clergyman, and
I suppose their marriage wasn’t absolute-
ly legal, but-”

  A crashing, as of some heavy-focfted
animal, sounded in the undergrowth of
a near-by pine copse.

  "Who—what the devil’s that?” Colo-
nel FitzPatrick demanded, striding bel-
ligerently toward the disturbance. "Come
out o.’ that, whoever you are, or I’ll come
in after you. Now, then, come on—good
God. look!”

                                                              f

   Parting the long-needled branches with
blind, groping hands, a young man in
evening dress stumbled and staggered
into the pool of luminance shed by a
Chinese lantern. His collar and tie were
undone, his shirt broken loose from its
studs, his clothing in utter disarray. Blood
streamed over his chin in a steady spate,
staining his linen and dripping on the
pine needles at his feet. At first I thought
his lips parted in a drunken grin, but as
he reeled nearer I gave an exclamation of
horror. The grimace I had thought
voluntary' resulted from dreadful mutila-
tion. Where the scarf-skin and mucous
membrane joined, his lips had been cut
away in two semicircular sections, like a
pair of parentheses laid horizontally, re-
vealing the white, staring teeth beneath
DAUGHTER OF THE MOONLIGHT

197

and drenching his chin and breast with
a spilth of ruby blood.

  "Martin, boy, whatever is the matter—
how did it happen?” FitzPatrick asked in
a shrill, half-unbelieving whisper.

  The young man gave a slavering, un-
intelligible answer, waving his arms
wildly toward the clearing behind as his
mutilated lips refused to form the words,
and goggling at us with rolling, horrified
eyes. His impotence and fright, his in-
ability to speak and the wondering horror
in his dazed eyes sickened me. It was
like witnessing the agony of some gentle,
dumb animal, tortured where it had
thought to find kindness.

  "Quick, Friend Trowbridge,” de Gran-
din cried as he snatched the handkerchief
from his breast pocket and deftly folded
it into a pack for the boy’s maimed
mouth, "help me get him to the house;
we must take immediate measures, for his
coronary vessels are cut—his hemorrhage
is dangerous. Let Monsieur FitzPatrick
seek his niece, here is work for us!”

While we clawed through the meager
supplies of the club’s first-aid kit
an attendant telephoned Harrisonville for
an ambulance and reported that the big
emergency car which Coroner Martin, in
his private capacity of funeral director,
kept available for service, was already on
its way, for the city hospitals resolutely
refused to send their cars beyond the
limits of the municipality.

  "Dieu de Dieu,” the Frenchman swore
feverishly, "if we could but obtain a styp-
tic, we might make progress, but this
gauze, this adhesive tape, these prepared
bandages—what use are they? On the
field of battle, yes; in such a case as this,
where we must ever consider the coming
operation which is to restore the young

monsieur’s countenance, non. Ah, parbleu,
I have it! Quick, Friend Trowbridge,
rush, run, hasten, fly to the so excellent
chef and obtain from him some gelatin
and a pan of boiling-hot water. Yes,
that will do most nobly, I apprehend.”

  Working quickly, he made a paste of
the gelatin and water, then applied the
transparent mixture to young Faber’s torn
lips. To my surprize it acted almost as
well as collodion, and in a few minutes
the entire flow of blood was staunched.
We had hardly finished when Martin’s
ambulance drew up before the door, its
powerful eight-cylinder engine panting
like a live thing with the strain to which
it had. been put in making the ten-mile
run. Assisted by the genial mortician,
who had dropped his other work to super-
intend the emergency trip, we bundled
the injured man into a chair-cot and bore
him to the car.

  ”Mon Dieu, my hat!” de Grandin
wailed as I was about to leap into the
ambulance and slam the door. "Quick,
my friend, get it for me, if you please—it
cost me fifty francs!”

  I hustled to the check room to retrieve
the missing headgear, and as I hurried
out again I caught a glimpse of Josephine
and Dolores FitzPatrick awaiting the
colonel and his car.

  Josephine, tear-scarred and tremulous,
had evidently been upbraiding her
cousin in no uncertain terms, but the red-
haired maiden was calm beneath the re-
proaches.

  “Martin?” I heard her exclaim in a
cool, ironical voice. "Why, Jo, dear, I
don’t want him; you’re welcome to him,
I’m sure.”

  Something like a draft of winter air
piercing through the sultry summer night
seemed to chill my spine as I listened.
198

Was it just a crack-brained fancy that
made me think her thin, red lips were
colored with a smear less innocent than
any brand of rouge obtainable at drug
stores?

The carelessness of a local fish-dealer
in failing to provide adequate re-
frigeration for his finny stock occasioned
a young epidemic of mild ptomaine poi-
sonings, and I was kept busy prescribing
Rochelle salt and administering hypo-
dermic doses of morphine throughout the
following day. By dinnertime I was in a
state bordering on collapse, but Jules de
Grandin was fresh as the newly starched
linen he had donned for the evening
meal.

  "What have you been up to?" I asked
as we enjoyed our coffee on the side
veranda.

  "Eh bien, three stories; no less/’ he
answered with a chuckle.

  "What?”

   "Three stories, I did say,” he returned.
"Upon the third floor of Mercy Hospital,
with the young Monsieur Faber. Jules de
Grandin is clever. The wounds upon the
young monsieur's face already make ex-
cellent progress, there is no infection, and
all is prepared for me to graft flesh from
his leg upon his mangled lips. When I
have done, only a little, so small mustache
will be needed to hide his scars from the
world. Yes, it is an altogether satisfactory
case.”

   "How the deuce did he receive that ap-
palling hurt?” I wondered. "It looked
almost as though some ferocious beast
had worried him. But that’s absurd, of
course. There isn’t any game more sav-
age than a rabbit to be found in this sec-
tion of Jersey.”

  "U’m,” de Grandin sipped a mouthful
of coffee slowly and beat a devil's tattoo

on the arm of his chair with small, slen-
der fingers. "One wonders,”

  "This one doesn't—not tonight, at any
rate.’’ I answered. "I’m too tired to think.
It’s been a hard day, and tomorrow looks
like another: I’ll turn in. if you don’t
mind.”

  "Happy dreams,” he bade with a wave
of his hand as I rose to go inside.

Perhaps it was the salad I had eaten,
perhaps the broiling heat of the July
night which made me so thirsty; at any
rate, I woke with parched tongue and
paper-dry lips some time between mid-
night and dawn and reached sleepily for
the carafe of chilled water on my bed-
side table. I upturned the chromium-
plated bottle, but no cooling trickle of
liquid reached my glass. "Hang it!” I
muttered as I sought my slippers and
started for the bathroom to replenish the
exhausted water supply.

  f;Dieu, non; I shall make no treaty with
such as you!" I heard de Grandin whisper
as I shuffled past his door on my return
trip. "Away, hell-spawn, I enter no en-
gagements-”

  I paused before his door, wondering
whether it were better to waken him or
let his nightmare pass, when a further
sound came from beyond the panels—a
queer, baffling sound, like something
scratching and clawing at the stout cop-
per screen at the window. I hesitated no
longer.

  "Good Lord!” I exclaimed as I entered
the bedroom. Jules de Grandin lay on his
bed, his limbs taut and rigid, his fingers
clutching at the linen. Beyond the screen,
clawing at the copper mesh with the fury
of a savage beast, was the biggest owl I
had ever seen. With beak and talon it
fought the woven wire, and in its glow-

ing, yellow eyes there blazed a steady j
glare of concentrated malignancy and;
hatred.

  A moment I stared at the uncanny
thing, completely taken aback; then, act-
ing without conscious thought, I hurried
to the window and dashed the contents
of my water-bottle full in its evil face.
"Be off!” I ordered sharply. The vis-
itant’s fiery eyes disappeared as though
they had been two glowing coals ex-
tinguished by the flood of water, and
with a scream of mingled rage and fright
it flapped away in the surrounding
shadows.

  ,fCordieu!” de Grandin woke with a
start and sat bolt-upright. "I have had a
most exceedingly evil dream, Friend
Trowbridge. I dreamed a mighty owl,
well-nigh as great as Uncle Sam’s so
glorious eagle, came clawing at the win-
dow, and bade me keep darkly secret a
fact I discovered today. I refused its
order, and it made at me with beak and
claws, as if it were a devil-bird from
hell’s own subcellar!”

  "H’m, the devil part of it was prob-
ably a dream,” I answered, "but the owl
was certainly real enough. The biggest
one I ever saw was scratching at the
screen like a thing possessed when I came
down the hall a moment ago. T

thought-”

  "Ha, do you tell me? And where is it
now?” he interrupted.

   "Drying itself, I imagine.”

 "You mean-”

   "I didn’t know what else to do to dis-
courage it, so I flung a quart or so of
water on it.”

  "Oh, Trowbridge, my good, my in-
comparable Trowbridge!” he applauded.
"You know not what you do; but always

you do the right thing. Did you also
address it?”

  "Yes,” I grinned sheepishly. "I said,
'Be off!’ ”

  "Mort d'un rat mort!” he cried, leaping
from the bed and flinging both arms
about me. "You are priceless, my old
I one. You are perfection's own self, no
less!”

  What the deuce-”

  "You did perfectly. If it were a phys-
ical. natural bird, which I greatly doubt,
the dousing you gave it was enough to
discourage its ardor, beyond dispute; if it
were what I damnation suspect, the bap-
tism and your unequivocal command to
I take itself elsewhere were precisely what
was required to rid us of its presence.
Oh. mv inestimable one, if I could be as
j 7
sure of myself in my wisdom as you are
in your ignorance, I should esteem Jules
de Grandin more highly.”

  "Thank heaven you aren't, then,” I
countered with a laugh. "You’re bad
enough as it is; if you admired yourself
any more there’d be no living with you!”
"Bete!” he cried. "I have killed for
less than that; the least I should do is

challenge you to mortal combat and-’

  "Confound it!” I interrupted. "And at
this unholy hour, too!” My bedroom
telephone had commenced ringing with
all the infernal insistence of which those
instruments of torture are capable when
we are blissfully asleep.

  "Hullo, Dr. Trowbridge,” came the
challenge over the wire; "FitzPatrick
speaking. Can you come over at once?
It’s Dolores—she’s gone!”

  "Gone?” I echoed. "Why, how do you

mean? Have you notified the police-”

  "Hell’s fire, no! This is a case for a
physician. She had some sort of seizure
this afternoon and-”
200

WEIRD TALES

  "All right,” I broke in, ''we’ll be
right out.”

  Ten minutes later de Grandin and I
were speeding toward Seven Pines, Fitz-
Patrick’s palatial country seat.

The place was in a turmoil when we
reached it. Lights blazed in the win-
dows from top to bottom; the colonel, his
daughter and the servants trod on each
others’ heels in aimless circling quests for
the missing girl; everywhere was bustle,
confusion and futility.

  "Hanged if I know what it was,” the
colonel confessed as we shook hands.
"Dolores had been acting queerly ever
since last night when young Faber was
injured. By the way, how is he, Doctor de
Grandin?”

   "Excellent, all things considered,” the
Frenchman replied. "But it is of Made-
moiselle Dolores we were speaking.
What of her?”

  "Well, after we found Martin Faber
last night I beat my way through the
pines to look for her, and found her
stretched out on the ground, unconscious.
It gave me a shock—I thought she might
be dead or injured, but just as I stooped
to pick her up she came round, rose with-
out assistance and walked to the house
with me as coolly as though falling in a
faint was an every-night occurrence with
her.”

   "T/ens, and was it?” de Grandin asked.

  "Not that I know,” FitzPatrick an-
swered shortly. "I asked her if she’d seen
Martin, and she said she had.

   " 'Was he all right?’ I wanted to know,
and:

   " 'As right as usual—he’s always some-
thing of an ass, isn’t he. Uncle Pat?’ she
answered.

   “ 'Perhaps you’d be interested if I told

you he’s been terribly hurt, had both lips
almost torn off,’ I snapped.

  " 'Perhaps I should, but I’m not,’ she
replied as cool as you please, and that’s
all I got from her.

  " 'You’re inhuman!’ I accused.

  " 'So I’ve been told,’ she admitted.

  "After that we didn’t speak till we
reached the clubhouse.

  "I think she and Josephine had a
pretty warm set-to later, for both of ’em
seemed rather huffy when we drove home,
and Dolores began acting queerly this
morning.”

  "How, by example?” de Grandin
asked.

  "Oh, she seemed unduly depressed,
even for one of her moody temperament,
wouldn’t eat anything, and seemed not to
hear when any one spoke to her. Just
before dinner she was sitting on the
porch, looking down the lawn, but not
seeming to see anything, when all of a
sudden I noticed her left foot was twitch-
ing and shaking like-” He paused

for an adequate illustration, then: "As
though a galvanic current had been ap-
plied to it.

  "I looked at her, wondering what the
matter was, and within a moment the
spasm seemed to spread all over her.
She’d shake as though with a chill, then
seem to relax, go limp as a damp cloth,
then tremble more violently than ever.
Before I could reach her she’d slipped
from her chair to the floor and lay there,
twitching and trembling like a mechanical
figure when the clockwork is almost run
down. Her eyes were partly opened, but
the eyeballs were turned up under the
upper lids so the pupils were invisible.
She seemed wholly unconscious when I
picked her up.”	,7

  "Great heavens!” I exclaimed, "that

has all the earmarks of an epilep-”

  "Zut!” de Grandin cut me short.
"What happened further, if you please,
Monsieur?”

  "That’s all. We put her to bed, and
she seemed to lapse into a natural sleep.
I hadn’t planned on calling you until to-
morrow morning; but a few minutes ago
when Josephine went in to see how she
was, we found she’d gone. We’ve
searched everywhere, but she seems to
have evaporated. If we’d only thought to
have somebody stay with her, we

might-”

  "Pardon me, sir,” FitzPatrick’s chauf-
feur suggested, pausing respectfully by his
employer’s elbow, "I’ve been thinking
Bruno might be able to help us here; he’s
a hunter, and his scent is keen, even if he
hasn’t been trained to track people.”

  "Nonsense-” the colonel began,

but:

  "Excellent, my old one, your idea is
entirely sound,” de Grandin applauded.
"Obtain from Mademoiselle’s wardrobe a
pair of shoes, and let the dog smell them
thoroughly. Then, by happy chance, if
the others have not already obscured her
tracks with their fruitless searchings, we
may be led to her.”

The dog, a long-legged, rangy hound,
was brought from the stable, given
the scent from a pair of Dolores’ bedroom
mules, and led out by the chauffeur.
Slowly the man and beast walked round
the house in ever-widening circles. The
hound’s nose was to the ground most of
the time, but every now and then he
would raise his muzzle and sniff the
upper air as though to clear his nostrils of
a confusing medley of scents. They had
almost completed their twelfth circuit

when the dog abruptly jerked forward
against his leash, thrust his muzzle for-
ward and gave a deep, belling bay. Next
instant, dragging himself free, he set out
toward a rise of ground behind FitzPat-
rick’s grove, his gray-and-brown body
extended, shoulders and hind-quarters
moving rhythmically as he galloped.

  "After him, Friend Trowbridge!” de
Grandin cried. "He has the scent, he
will assuredly take us to her.”

  Stumbling, scrambling over the un-
even ground of the wood, we followed
the dog, entered the deeper shadow of the
grove, then paused irresolute, for all trace
of our canine guide had vanished.

  "Sucre bleu,” de Grandin swore, "we
are at fault. Here, mon brave, here, noble
animal!” He put his fingers to his lips
and sounded a shrill whistle.

  Answer was almost immediate. From
the farther side of the wood the hound
came slinking, his ears and muzzle droop-
ing, tail tucked pitifully between his legs.
Like a frightened child the beast cowered
by de Grandin’s legs and whimpered in
abject terror.

  "Huh,” exclaimed the chauffeur, "th’
fool dawg’s lost th’ scent!”

  The little Frenchman slipped his finger
under the animal’s collar and advanced
slowly toward the clearing beyond.
"What lies yonder?” he asked, turning to
the chauffeur.

  "Th’ ol’ graveyard,” returned the
other. "Colonel FitzPatrick tried to buy
it when he took over th’ estate, but th’
heirs wouldn’t sell. Our land stops at th’
boundary o’ th’ woods, sir.”

  "Eh, do you tell me?” de Grandin ans-
wered absently, patting the whimpering
hound’s back gently. "It may well be our
good beast has found the trail only too
well, and returned to us for reasons of
202

prudence, vion ami. Look, what is that?” j
He pointed upward.

  Clear-cut against the faint luminosity
of the summer sky, a great, black-winged
bird went sailing on outstretched, almost
motionless pinions, circled slowly a mo-
ment, then swooped downward to the
fenced-in close of the old, dismantled
burying-ground which lay before us.
Almost at once another spectral shape,
and still another, followed the first in
ghostly single file.

  "H’m, they look like owls to me,” the
chauffeur returned, "but they're bigger
than any owls I ever seen. Jimminy
crickets, there’s three of ’em! Never seen
nothin’ like it before.”

  "Let us hope you may not do so again,”
the little Frenchman answered. "Come,
let us go.”

  "Not quittin’, are yuh?” the chauffeur
asked, half contemptuously.

  The Frenchman made no reply as, the
hound’s collar still clutched in his hand,
he strode toward the house.

  Once inside the lighted hall, he swept
the circle of servants with an appraising
eye. "Is there a Catholic present?” he
demanded.

  "Sure, I’m one,” volunteered die cook,
on whose countenance appeared the map
of County Kerry. "Wot ov it?”

  "Very good. Will you be good enough
to lend me your rosary, and a flask of
holy water, as well, if you happen to
possess it?” he returned.

  "Sure, ye can have ’em, an’ welcome,”
she answered, "but what ye’re afther
wantin’ ov ’em is more’n I can see.”

  Two steps carried de Grandin to her
side. "What is today, Madame•?” he
asked, staring her levelly in the eye.

  "Why, sure, an’ it’s July thirty-first—

i no. ’tis August first,” she answered won-
! deringly.

  "Precisement. In France we call this
day la fete de saint Pierre-es-Liens. You
know it as the feast of Saint Peter’s

Chains, or-”

  "Glory be to God! ’Tis Lammas!” she
cried, terrified understanding shining in
her face. "Wuz it fer this th’ pore young
gur-rl wuz stole away?”

  "I would not go so far,” de Grandin
answered, "but a moment since the hound
came whimpering and trembling to my
knee after he had been to the ancient
graveyard which lies beyond Monsieur le
Colonel’s woodland, and we did see three
monster owls, with yellow, sulfurous eyes,
fly past the moon. May I have the blessed
articles?”

  "Indade ye shall!” she told him heart-
ily. "An’ it’s th’ brave lad ye are to ven-
ture in that haunted place. Faith, Bridget
O'Flaherty wouldn’t do it if th’ Howly
Father stood at her elbow, wid th’ whole
College o’ Cardinals behint ’im! Ouch,
God an' th’ Howly Saints preserve this
house tonight!” She signed herself rever-
ently with the cross as she hastened to
procure the rosary and blessed water.

Once more we forced our way through
FitzPatrick’s wood lot. Wrapped
about his right wrist de Grandin wore the
cook’s rosary like a bracelet, in his left
hand he bore a half-pint flask adorned
with a label assuring the beholder that it
contained 'Golden Wedding Rye, 50
Years Old. Bottled in Bond,” but which
actually contained nothing more lawless
than water from the font of St. Joseph’s
church. At the Frenchman’s heels I
marched, a double-barreled shotgun
cocked and ready, that we might be pre-
DAUGHTER OF THE MOONLIGHT

203

pared to meet the foe on ghostly or ter-
restrial planes.

  "Careful, Friend Trowbridge,” he
warned, "we do approach.” Stepping
cautiously from the shadow of the oak
trees, he advanced stealthily toward the
tumbledown wooden fence enclosing the
disused cemetery.

  Almost as we emerged from the wood
there came a queer, high, piping sound,
a sort of sustained whistle, so shrill as to
be almost inaudible, yet so piercing in
quality that it stabbed the ear as a den-
tist’s whirling drill bites the tortured
tooth. Up, wheeling blindly in ever-
widening circles, then pouncing forward
like birds of prey came a trio of great,
sable bats, squeaking viciously as they
swooped at our faces.

  "Ha, evil ones, you find us not unpre-
pared!” the little Frenchman whispered
between drawn lips. "Behold this sign, ye
minions of the dark—look, and be
afraid!” He raised his bead-bound wrist,
displaying the miniature crucifix which
swung from the rosary, and at the same
time thrust his left hand forward, send-
ing a shower of holy water toward the
flying things.

  The bats were larger than any creatures
of the kind I had ever seen; in my excite-
ment it seemed to me they were as big as
full-grown rats, with wing-spread of a
yard or more, and their little, evil eyes
glinted with a red and fiery malevolence
as they swooped. I raised the gun and
loosed both barrels at them, then broke
the lock and jammed fresh cartridges
feverishly into the smoking breech.

  "Hola," de Grandin cried exultingly,
“you or I, or both of us, have put them to
rout, Friend Trowbridge; see, they are
gone!”

  They were. Look as I would, I could
espy no sign of the uncouth things.

  "Why, I must have literally blown
them to pieces,” I exclaimed..

  "U’m, perhaps,” he conceded. "Let us
see what further we may see.”

  Dolores FitzPatrick lay supine upon a
sunken grave, her head pressed tight
against the weather-gnawed tombstone,
her feet toward the lower end of the
sepulcher. Stretched to utmost length
diagonally from her shoulders, her arms
extended up and outward, while her
nether limbs were thrust out stiffly at
acute angles from her hips, making the
design of a white St. Andrew’s cross upon
the mossy graveyard turf. Briars and
clutching undergrowth had ripped her
flimsy silken nightrobe to tatters so that
scarce a shred remained to clothe her;
her slippers had been shed somewhere in
her flight, and stones and brambles had
bruised and torn her tender feet; more
than one thorn-gash scarred her slim
white body, and a wisp of short, ruddy
hair lay across her forehead like a bleed-
ing wound.

  "Good heavens!” I cried, dropping to
my knees and taking her wrist between
my fingers. "She’s”—I paused, put my
ear to her still breast, then looked up at
the Frenchman with dawning horror in
my eyes—"she’s gone, de Grandin; we’re
too late. The poor child must have
wandered here in her delirium and fallen
on this grave in a fresh seizure. See her
thumbs!”

  There was no mistaking the diagnostic
sign; her thumbs were bent transversely
across her palms and the fingers clutched
them with all the avid tensity of rigor
mortis.

  "Epilepsy, no doubt of it,” I diagnosed.
"The history of her case as detailed by
204

WEIRD TALES

FitzPatfick is absolutely unmistakable.
The poor girl’s lived beneath this shadow
for years without suspecting it—that was
the reason for her 'queerness and per-
versity’ that made her hardly tolerable.
She was at the dangerous age, and when
the blow fell it crushed her, absolutely.”
The Frenchman knelt beside her, felt
her wrist and temples, and listened at her
breast, then rose with what seemed to me
a strangely callous indifference. "Give me
the gun,” he ordered as he shed his
jacket and draped it over Dolores’ all but
nude remains. "Do you take her up and
bear her to the house, my friend.

  "Have you read your Bible much of
late?” he asked apropos of nothing as I
crudged in his wake with the lovely body
in my arms.

  "My Bible?”

  (!Precisement. That portion which deals
with those possessed of devils?”

  "No—why d’ye ask?”

  "I hardly know myself,” he answered
almost absently, holding back a branch
from my path; "it was but a thought
which came to me; perhaps it is of little
value, perhaps, again, it may have appli-
cation here. If so, I shall explain when
the time has come.”

The first faint sign came as I strode
up the graveled walk toward Fitz-
patrick’s house. Just as I was about to
mount the lower step of the veranda I
felt a slight stirring, the faintest sugges-
tion of fluttering motion in my burden. I
cook the short flight in two giant leaps,
and bent to examine her countenance in
the porch light’s glare. There was no
doubt about it. She had relaxed her
clutching hold upon her thumbs, and her
lower jaw, which had fallen, had once
more raised itself, closing the mouth and

giving to the thin, pale face a look of
natural sleep. Even as I gazed incredu-
lously into her countenance her bosom
trembled and a faint sigh escaped her.

  "De Grandin!” I cried. "De Grandin,
she’s alive!”

  He nodded shortly. "I thought as
much,” he said; then, his manner as
professionally impersonal as though he
were visiting physician at a charity hos-
pital: "See that the blankets on her bed
are well warmed, and that no disturbing
noises are permitted near her room. I
would suggest we administer the Brown-
Sequard prescription; it is often effica-
cious.”

However much it lacked in sympathy,
his advice was medically sound.
Within a week Dolores FitzPatrick ap-
peared quite normal. In ten days more,
against my protests, she had renewed her
febrile social life, driving at breakneck
speed along the country roads, attending
all-night dances, scattering a trail of badly
damaged masculine hearts behind her,
and, worst of all, indulging in the villain-
ous poison which passed for whisky
among the younger set.

  The Frenchman’s lack of interest in
the case amazed me. Curious as a child,
he was ordinarily wont to give my cases
as close attention as though they were his
own, and his weakness for a pretty face
was a standing joke between us, yet in
Dolores FitzPatrick, beautiful, heartless
and fascinating as Circe’s own seductive
self, he seemed to take no interest.

  "Well,” I announced as I entered the
study one scorching night some three
weeks later, "perhaps you’ll be interested
now. She’s gone. She died an hour ago
with cardiac hypertrophy; I knew she’d
burn herself out.”
DAUGHTER OF THE MOONLIGHT

205

   For the first time his mask of indiffer-
ence slipped. "Who will have the fu-
neral—Monsieur Martin?” he asked.

  "Yes, I’ve already made out die death
certificate for him.”

  He reached for the ’phone and called
the coroner’s number. "It is a most
strange request I have to make, Mon-
sieur,” he confessed when the connection
had been made, ''but you and I have been
associated before. You will understand
I do not act from idle curiosity. Will you
permit that I be present while you em-
balm Mademoiselle FitzPatrick’s body?
You may consider it impertinent, but—
nom d’un chou-fleur, do you tell me? But
you will not honor it, surely? Dieu de
Dieu, you will?”

  "What now?” I asked as he put back
the receiver and turned a blank face to
me.

  "A so strange testament has been
found in Mademoiselle Dolores’ room,”
he answered. "In it she does expressly re-
quest that she be not embalmed. You at-
tended her, my friend, you have author-
ity; will you not prevail on Monsieur
FitzPatrick to have an autopsy per-
formed?”

  "I can’t,” I told him. "The cause of
death was perfectly obvious; I’ve seen it
coming for days, and warned FitzPatrick
of it. He’d think me crazy.”

  "I shall think you worse, if you re-
fuse.”

  "I’m sorry,” I returned. "There’s no
earthly excuse for a post-mortem; I
wouldn’t think of asking one.”

   And there the matter rested.

The last humming echo of the final
gong-stroke spent itself in the still
summer air, and like the faintest whisper
of a breeze among half-dried leaves came
the subdued rustle which betokened turn-

ing heads and craning necks—that gesture
which even well-bred people make at
such a time.

  A momentary congestion at the church
door while six frock-coated and perspir-
ing gentlemen bent their backs to the un-
accustomed task, then:

  "I am the Resurrection and die Life,
saith the Lord: he that believeth in me,
though he were dead, yet shall he
live . . .”

   Dr. Bentley’s resonant voice sounded as
he marched slowly up the aisle before the
flower-decked casket. "I know that my
Redeemer liveth and that He shall stand
at the latter day upon the earth . . .”

   The afternoon sun shone softly through
the stained glass windows and glinted on
the polished mahogany of the pews.
Here and there it picked out spots of
color, a flower, a woman’s hat or a man’s
tie. Through a memorial panel to the
right of the chancel a single beam of
tinted light gleamed dully on the silver
mountings of the casket. The majestic
office for the burial of the dead proceeded
to benediction, the choir’s voices rose in
"Lead, Kindly Light,” drowning out the
muffled boom of the traffic in the street
beyond.

  As the organ’s final diminuendo vi-
brated to silence, the pallbearers rose to
their appointed task and once more the
solemn procession passed through the
center aisle. A momentary lull came in
the outside traffic as the suave mortician
appeared on the church steps; then a
motor purred to the curb, the hearse
moved forward, and the procession was
on its way.

   Jules de Grandin tossed his burned-out
cigarette from the window of Coroner
Martin’s limousine and gazed in undis-
guised admiration at the mortician. "You
206

WEIRD TALES

are marvelous, no less, Monsieur,” he as-
sured him. "In my own country, and any-
where in Europe, Mademoiselle Fitz-
Patrick would have been consigned to the
grave in four-and-twenty hours. We do
not embalm there. Here, under similar
conditions, you present her at the church
three hot summer days after death as
though she lay in natural sleep. Tell me,”
he leaned forward eagerly, "is it perhaps
that you ignored the injunctions of her
testament and embalmed her body after
all?”

  Martin shook his head. "Did you
notice the casket?” he asked.

  "It was a most beautiful piece of fur-
niture,” the Frenchman answered with
non-committal politeness.

  "I wasn’t referring to its appearance,
but to its construction,” the other re-
turned. "The outside case is mahogany,
carefully glued and jointed, practically
a water- and air-tight box. Inside is a
shell technically known as an 'inner
sealer,’ a separate copper case with an
hermetically sealed full-length top of
plate glass. This, in turn, is lined with
satin upholstery. Before we laid the
young lady in this inner casket we put
upward of a hundred briquettes of Car-
bon dioxid snow—the 'dry ice’ used by
confectioners to keep ice cream hard for
long periods—under the satin trimmings.
Then we fastened down the glass top and
made it airtight with rubber gaskets and
liquid cement. The air space between
the inner and outer caskets, and the her-
metic sealing of the inner case insured the
carbon dioxid against rapid evaporation,
the result being that the temperature in
the inner casket is, and will continue for a
long time to be, several degrees below
freezing. You see?”

  "Perfectly,” de Grandin agreed with a

quick nod. "You have refrigerated her—
she will remain in her present condition
indefinitely!”

  "Well,” Coroner Martin smiled depre-
catingly, "I’m sure there’ll be no immedi-
ate change in her condition, or-” he

broke off abruptly, for we had arrived at
the cemetery, and he was once more the
busy official, directing an undrilled per-
sonnel in the performance of unfamiliar
duties with the precision of a detach-
ment of trained soldiers.

  I kept my gaze fixed demurely on the
ground, as befitted a physician whose
patient was being buried, but Jules de
Grandin permitted no conventions to
hamper him. About the grave he strolled,
taking eye-measurements of the location,
noting the character of the upturned soil,
examining the approaches with the prac-
tised eye of one who had seen much mili-
tary service.”

  "There is a new moon tonight, Friend
Trowbridge,” he whispered as we re-
entered Martin’s car for the return trip;
"be so good as to make no engagements,
if you please.”

  "A new moon?” I echoed in amaze-
ment. "What the dickens are you drool-
ing about? What has the new moon to
do with us?”

  "Nothing, I hope; much, I fear,” he re-
turned seriously.

  His air of suppressed excitement told
me he had some enterprise on foot, but
his irritating habit of keeping his plans to
himself was strong as ever. To all my
questions he returned no more informa-
tive answer than a shrug of a lifted eye-
brow. At length he turned his shoulder
squarely on me, gazed out the window
and fell to humming:

          "Ma file, pour penitence,

            Ron et ron, petit patapon,

          Ma fille, pour penitence,

Nous nous embrasseronsV
DAUGHTER OF THE MOONLIGHT

207

The night air was heavy with dew and
drenched with the perfume of honey-
suckle as de Grandin and I let ourselves
through the narrow door flanking the
main entrance of the great Canterbury
gate leading to Shadow Lawns Cemetery.
Michaelson, the superintendent, was
awaiting us in the office adjoining the
graveyard’s imposing Gothic chapel, and
that he expected trouble of some sort
was clearly evidenced by the heavy re-
volver swinging in a shoulder-holster be-
neath his left armpit. ''Down, Hinden-
burg—charge!” he ordered gruffly as a
monstrous police dog with baleful, green
eyes half rose from its station before the
fireless hearth and bared a set of awe-
inspiring teeth.

  "I’ve been on the lookout all evening,”
he told us as we shook hands, "but noth-
ing’s happened yet. Sure you got a
straight tip, Doctor de Grandin?”

  The Frenchman tweaked the carefully
waxed ends of his tiny blond mustache.
"My informant is one I have every reason
to trust,” he replied. "I am not surprized
you have seen nothing thus far; but it
might be well if we took our stations now,
we know not when something may trans-
pire.”

  "All right,” Michaelson agreed, slip-
ping on a dark jacket and snapping a
woven-leather leash through the dog’s
collar. "Let’s go.”

  As we walked along the winding, well
kept roads beneath the arching trees to-
ward the FitzPatrick family plot, "Mighty
glad you got this information in time,”
the superintendent said. "Shadow Lawns
has been operating more than fifty years,
and we’ve never had a grave robbery, not
even in the days when medical schools
had to buy stolen bodies for their work.

I’d hate to have our record broken now.
Wonder if there’ll be a gang of ’em?”

  "I doubt it,” de Grandin answered.
"Indeed, I think this will be scarcely
what could be called a grave robbery; it
is more apt to be a violation.”

  "H’m, I don’t think I quite follow
you,” Michaelson confessed as we took
up our position in the shadow of an im-
posing bronze-and-granite monument.
"What makes you so sure it will be to-
night?”

  "The moon—the new moon,” the
Frenchman replied.

  "The mo- well, I’ll be damned!”

rejoined the other.

OUR wait seemed interminable. The
low, monotonous crooning of noc-
turnal inseas in the grass, the occasional
mournful cry of a night bird, the sub-
dued echo of the traffic of the distant city
—all blended into a continuous lullaby
which more than once threatened to steal
my consciousness. Michaelson yawned
and stretched full length on the grass,
Hindenburg lay with pointed nose be-
tween his outstretched paws in canine
slumber, only Jules de Grandin remained
watchful and alert.

  I was on the point of pillowing my
head upon my arm and snatching a nap
when the sudden pressure of the French-
man’s fingers on my elbow roused me.
"See, my friends,” he whispered. "He
comes!”

  Stealthily as a shadow, a figure stole
between the mounded graves toward the
flower-decked hummock beneath which
lay the body of Dolores FitzPatrick. The
man was dressed in some sort of dark
clothing, without a single highlight of
white linen in his costume; consequently
his visibility was low against the back-
208

WEIRD TALES

ground of the night, but from the supple-
ness of his movements I realized he was
young, and from the furtiveness of his
manner I knew he was afraid.

  "How the hell did that happen?”
Michaelson demanded. "The main gate’s
the only one open, and Johnson’s on
guard there with a shotgun and orders
not to let even the President of the United
States by without a written pass from
>>

me.

  "Ah bah,” de Grandin whispered,
"there never yet was fence so high that
desperate men could not swarm over it,
my friend, and this one is most desperate;
make no mistake concerning that.”

  Michaelson’s hand stole toward his
gun. "Shall I wing him?” he asked.

  "Mon Dieu, no!” de Grandin forbade.
''Wait till I give the word.”

  The great dog roused to his haunches,
and opened his mouth in an almost noise-
less snarl, but the Frenchman’s small
hand stroked his smooth head and patted
his bristling neck soothingly. "Down,
mon brave" he whispered. "Our time is
not yet.” Children, dogs and women
loved and trusted Jules de Grandin at
sight. The savage brute rested its great
head against his knee and seemed actually
to nod understandingly in assent.

  Meantime the figure at the grave had
unslung a spade and pick-ax from the
pack upon its back and commenced a
furious attack on the soft, untamped
earth. We watched in silence from our
vantage-point, saw the parapet of defiled
earth grow high and higher beside the
grave, saw the digger descend lower and
lower into the trench he made. From time
to time the ghoul would pause, as though
to measure the task yet incomplete, then
renew his attack on the yielding loam
with redoubled vigor.

  It must have been an hour before he
reached his grisly goal. We saw him cast
aside his spade, bend forward in the
excavation and fumble at the fastenings
of the outer box which shielded the
casket from the earth. Some fifteen
minutes later he rose, took something
from the sack which lay beside the opened
grave and twisted it between his hands.

  ”What the hell?” Michaelson mur-
mured wonderingly.

  "A sheet, if I mistake not,” de Gran-
din answered. "Watch carefully; his
technique, it is good.”

  He was correct in his surmise. It was
a sheet the resurrectionist twisted into a
rope, then knotted into a sort of running
noose and dropped into the grave.

  Straddling the desecrated sepulcher, one
foot on each lip, the despoiler seized the
loose ends of the sheet, twisted them to-
gether and hauled upward, like a man
dragging a bucket from a curbless well.

  Hand over hand he drew the twisted
linen in, at length his task was done, and
the ravished body of Dolores FitzPatrick
came once more into the outer world, the
linen band knotted behind her shoulders
and crossing her breast transversely from
underneath the arms. Her little head,
crowned with its diadem of ruddy hair,
hung backward limply, and her long
white arms trailed listlessly behind her as
the robber drew her from the rifled
grave and laid her on the grass.

  A sharp, metallic click sounded at my
elbow. Michaelson had cocked his pistol
and trained it on the ghoul, but de Gran-
din’s quick wrestler’s-grip upon his wrist
arrested the shot. "Non, stupid one!” he
bade. "Have I not said I will say when
to shoot?”

  From the corner of my eye I saw this
by-play, but my horrified attention was
DAUGHTER OF THE MOONLIGHT

209

riveted on the tableau at the grave. The
robber had laid Dolores’ body on the
warm, dew-soaked turf, composed her
limbs and folded her hands across her
quiet bosom, then bent and rained a per-
fect torrent of kisses on the calm, dead
face. "I’m here, dear love; I kept our
compact!” he choked between ecstatic
sobs. "I’ll keep the promise to the end,
and then you shall be mine, mine, all
mine!” His voice rose almost to an hyster-
ical shriek at the end, and before I
realized what he did, he folded the dead
form in his arms and pressed it to his
breast as though it would respond to his
mad caresses.

  "Good heavens, a lunatic!” I whis-
pered. "A necrophiliac; I’ve heard of
such perverts, but-”

  "Be still!” de Grandin’s sharply whis-
pered admonition cut me off. "Be quiet,
great stupid-head, and watch what is to
come!”

  The madman raised the corpse in his
arms as once I had borne her living body
through the woods, gazed hurriedly
about, then set off at a rapid pace toward
the rising ground which marked the cen-
ter of the cemetery.

  Taking cover behind the intervening
monuments, we followed, but our precau-
tions were unnecessary, for so absorbed
in his horrid task was the grave-robber
that we might have walked at his heels,
yet never been discovered.

  A circular row of weeping willows
crowned the hill toward which we moved,
and in the center of the ring thus marked
there stood a tall stone cross engraved
with a five-word legend:

fte JMss Pelobeb g>leep

  To this monolith the grave-despoiler
bore his prey and laid her on the close-

cropped grass before the cross, then knelt
beside the body and clasped the slim,
cold hands in both of his, while leaning
forward, he gazed into the quiet face as
though he would melt death’s chill by the
very ardor of his glance.

  "And now, my friends, I damn think
we shall see what we shall see!” de Gran-
din whispered. "Observe, if you please;
the new moon rises.”

  He pointed upward as he spoke.
There, beyond the line of willow trees
soared the crescent moon, slim as a shav-
ing from a silversmith’s iathe, sharp as a
sickle from the fields of Demeter.

  And even as I spied the moon I saw
another thing. Clear-cut as an image in
a shadowgraph against the moon’s faint
luminance came a great black-winged
owl, another and still a third, flying
straight for the morbid group beneath the
cross.

  "Good Lord, de Grandin,. look!” I
whispered, but he shook my admonition
off with an impatient shrug.

  "Do you look there, my friend, and
tell me what it is you see!” he ordered.

   I glanced in the direction he indicated,
then shook my head as though to clear
a film from before my eyes. Surely, I did
but fancy it!

  No, there was no mistaking. As the
silver shafts of moonlight fell upon it,
the body of Dolores FitzPatrick seemed to
gather itself together, the long-limbed
looseness of post-mortem flaccidity
passed, and the body was imbued with
life. Distinctly as I ever saw a living per-
son rise, I saw the body of the girl which
had been buried that very afternoon up-
rear its head, its shoulders, and rouse to
a half-sitting posture. More, it turned a
living, conscious face upon the man
beside it, and smiled into his eyes!
210

WEIRD TALES

  A low, trembling whine, no louder
than a cricket’s squeak, sounded at my
feet. Hindenburg, the great, fierce dog,
crouched and groveled on the grass, the
hair upon his back raised in a bristling
ruff, his bushy, wolf-like tail held closely
to his hocks, every nerve in his powerful
body trembling with abject fright.

  "Notv you may fire, my friend,” de
Grandin ordered Michaelson, and at the
same time drew an automatic pistol from
his pocket and sent a bullet winging on
its way. But as he fired he contrived to
stumble against Michaelson so that the
latter’s aim was deflected.

  Both weapons spoke together, and
there was a startled cry of pain as the echo
of the shots reverberated through the
graveyard.

  "Quick, my friends, on him—ckargez!”
the Frenchman cried, leaping toward the
man and girl who huddled in the shadow
of the cross. He was a step or two before
us, and I observed what Michaelson did
not. As he reached his goal, he brought
the barrel of his pistol crashing down
upon the robber’s head, striking him un-
conscious.

  "Did we get him?” the superintendent
asked, pausing beside the prostrate man.

  "I think so,” de Grandin flung over
his shoulder as he bent above the girl.
"Examine him, if you please.”

  As Michaelson bent above the man, de
Grandin took the woman’s body in his
arms.

  "Great heavens-” I began, but a

sharp kick from the Frenchman’s boot
against my shin silenced my ejaculation
half uttered. Yet it was hard to restrain
myself, for in the fraction of a second
while he lifted her I had seen the tiny,
blue-black hole drilled through the girl’s
left temple by the small-calibered auto-

matic the Frenchman carried, and saw the
warm, fresh blood gush from the wound!
Dead she undoubtedly was, but newly
dead. That bullet had crashed through
living flesh and bone into a living brain!

  "Say, this feller’s alive!” the superin-
tendent cried. "He’s unconscious, but I

can’t find a wound on him, and-”

  "He was most likely stunned by a
glancing bullet,” de Grandin cut in. "Our
aim is often erratic in the dark. Tie him
securely and take him to the office; Dr.
Trowbridge and I will join you as soon
as we have returned this poor one to her
grave.”

  "You’re—you’re sure she’s dead?”
Michaelson asked diffidently. "I know it
sounds crazy as hell, but I’d have sworn

I saw her move a moment ago, and-”

  "liens, my friend, our eyes play strange
tricks on us in the moonlight,” the
Frenchman interrupted hastily. "Come,
Friend Trowbridge, let us go.”

  We walked a little way in silence; then,
as though he were replying to my spoken
thoughts, de Grandin said: "Do not press
me for an explanation now, my friend.
At present let us say my aim was poor
and my bullet found the wrong mark.
Scandal will be avoided if we let the dead
bury the dead. Anon I shall surely tell
you all.”

“T think there is little to be gained by
A questioning him further,” de Gran-
din counseled some two hours later when
Michaelson had at last decided it was use-
less to press our prisoner for an explana-
tion and was on the point of calling the
police. "The families of all involved are
prominent, and only ugly scandal can re-
sult from an expose, and that would do
your cemetery little good, my frieftd.
This young man’s actions are undoubt-

lesslv caused by mental derangement;
Doctor Trowbridge and I will take charge
of him, and see he is looked after. Mean-
time. Mademoiselle FitzPatrick’s body is
interred and none need be the wiser. It
is best so, nest-ce-pas?”

  "H’m, guess you're right, sir,” the
superintendent agreed. "We’ll just hush
the whole rotten business up, eh?”

  The little Frenchman nodded. "Come,
Friend Trowbridge,” he said, "let us be
gone. Monsieur” he bowed politely to
the; prisoner, "we wait on your con-
venience.”

At his suggestion 1 drove directly to
cthe house and helped him escort the
captive to the study. Once inside, de
Grandin dropped his air of captor and
motioned our charge to a comfortable
chair. "You will smoke, perhaps?” he
asked, proffering his case, then holding a
match while the other set his cigarette
aglow.

  "And now, petit imbecile, it may be
you will be good enough to explain the
reason for this evening’s lunacy to us?”
he continued, seating himself across the
desk from the prisoner and fixing him
with a level unwinking stare.

  No answer.

  "Tiens, this is no coin in which to re-
pay our kindness, Monsieur,” he ex-
postulated. "Consider how inconvenient
we might have made things—may still
make them, unless you choose to talk.
Besides, we know so much already, you
would be advised to tell us the rest.”
"You don’t know anything,” the other
answered sullenly.

  "Ah, there is where you are most out-
rageously mistaken,” de Grandin cor-
rected. "We know, by example, that you
are Robert Millington, son of Ralph Mil-

lington, cotton broker of New York and
eminent church-member of Harrisonville,
New Jersey. We know you were deeply
—passionately to the point of insanity—
in love with Mademoiselle Dolores; we

know-”

  "Leave her out of this!” the young man

blazed. "I won’t have-”

  "Mille pardons, Monsieur,” the French-
man corrected in a cold voice, "you will
have whatever we choose to give; no
more, no less. Your escapade tonight has
brought you to the very gate of prison,
perhaps of the asylum for the insane, and
you can best serve yourself by telling
what we wish to know. You will speak?”
"You wouldn’t believe me,” the boy
responded sullenly.

  "You greatly underestimate our credu-
lity, Monsieur. We are most trusting.
We shall believe whatever you may say—
provided it be the truth.”

  Young Millington took a deep breath,
like one about to dive in icy waters. "She
made me promise,” he replied.

  "Ah? We do make progress. What
was it you promised her?”

  A flush suffused the lad’s cheeks, then
receded, leaving them pale as death. "I
loved her,” he murmured, almost breath-
lessly. "I loved her more than anything
in the world—more than family or
friends, or”—he paused a moment, then,
in a sort of awestruck whisper—"more
than the salvation of my soul!”

  "Eh bien, love is like that in the
springtime of life,” the little Frenchman
nodded understandingly. He tweaked
the ends of his tightly waxed mustache
and nodded once again. "Have not I
felt the same in the years so long buried
beneath the sod of time? But certainly.
Ah, la passion delicieuse!” He put his
joined thumb and forefinger to his lips
212

WEIRD TALES

and wafted a kiss toward the ceiling.
"Those moonlit evenings beside the river
when we kissed and clung and shuddered
in an ecstasy of exquisite torment! That
matchless combination of humility and
pride—that lunacy of adoration which
made the adored one’s heel-print in the
dust more kissable than the lips of any

other woman-”

  "That’s it—you understand!” the boy
broke in hoarsely. "That’s how I felt; so

when she told me-”

  The little Frenchman’s sentimental
mood vanished like the flame of a blown-
out candle. "Precisement, when she told

you-” he prompted sharply, his little

round blue eyes holding the youth’s gaze
with an implacable, unwinking stare.

  "She told me she was going to die—
apparently,” young Millington returned,
as though the words were’wrung from his
unwilling lips. "She said she had an ill-
ness which only seeming death could
cure, but that she wouldn’t really die, and
if I’d come to her grave and take her
from it, and lay her where the first rays
of the new moon could shine on her,
she’d rise again, in perfect health, and we

could go away-”

  "Ah, poor besotted one!” de Grandin
cried compassionately. "Truly, you would
go away, for your chances of remaining in
the world when once life had returned to
those cruel jaws and force was once again
behind those tiny, sharp teeth would
have been less than that of the lamb at-
tending a convention of famished wolves!
No matter; go on. You believed her; like
a silly fish you gobbled up her bait and
did become her tool in this night’s work.
I see; I understand. Say no more, my
poor foolish one. You may go, and we
shall keep your secret securely in our
breasts.

  "Only”—he laid his hand kindly on
the boy’s shoulder at the door—"if you
possess one single shred of gratitude,
when next you go to church, thank God
upon your knees that your scheme failed
tonight.”

  "Thank God?” the boy retorted. "For

what?”

  "Tiens, for Jules de Grandin, if for
nothing else,” he answered. "Good night
and much good luck to you, petit Mon-
sieur/’

(<^WTow, perhaps, you’ll condescend to

  1>I tell me something?” I asked sar-
castically as the echo of young Milling-
ton’s footsteps died away.

  "Exactementhe agreed, selecting a
cigar from the humidor and snipping off
its end with painstaking care. "To begin:
I flout my citizenship of France like a
banner proudly displayed before the
enemy; but I am a citizen of the world,
as well, my friend. The seven seas and
five continents are no strangers to me.
No, I have traveled, I have seen; I have
observed. In the lazarets of a hundred
places I have plied this gruesome trade of
patching broken bodies which we follow,
good friend, and the notebooks of my
memory are full of entries. By example:
in a stinking trading town of Java I was
once called to treat a human wreck who
had loved not wisely but altogether too
well. The object of his passion was a
savage she-tiger, a beast-cruel Sadist. She
bit his lips away in the moment of em-
brace. He was a most unpleasant sight,
one not to be forgotten, I do assure you.

  "Very good. The other evening at the
country club I did behold another poor
one similarly maimed. Once seen, such
injuries as that are not forgotten, and I
needed no second glance at the poor
DAUGHTER OF THE MOONLIGHT

213

young Faber’s lips to tell me he was even
as that other one in Java.

  " 'Now,’ I asked me, 'who have so
ruthlessly destroyed this young man’s
looks, and for what reason?’

  "Reason there was none, but very lack
of reason is often the best reason of all.
This Mademoiselle Dolores, she has the
history of taking all which is most pre-
cious to her cousin, not because it has a
value of its own, but because her cousin
prizes it. Therefore, I reason, she who
once broke her cousin’s dolls have now
ravished away her fiance and broken him,
too. She did it from pure wantonness.

  "And I am right, as usual. Next day,
as I prepare to recondition the poor young
Faber’s lips I ask him certain questions,
and he replied in writing. What does he
tell me? Parbleu, you would be aston-
ished!

  "He says he accompanied Mademoi-
selle Dolores to the clearing where the
moon shone, for she had said she wished
to tell him something. Once there she
tells him of her love and begs that he will
desert her cousin Josephine and go away
with her. But no, he is a young man of
good principle. He will not do it; he re-
pulses her. Ha, he spoke truly who first
said hell has no fury like a scorned
woman! Dolores asks that young Martin
will give her one little kiss in token of
farewell, and all men are weak where
lovely women plead thus humbly. She
lifts her face to his, and all suddenly he
sees the flesh melt from off her bones, and
it is in the bare-skulled face of a skeleton
he looks as he is about to kiss her!

   "He cries out and struggles to be free,
but it are useless. Her slender arms are
strong as steel, and her teeth—mon Dieu
—her teeth are like shears of white-hot
metal. They fasten on his yielding lips

and clip them clear away! Voila, it is
done, and sick with pain and horror he
staggers blindly through the trees until
we find him.

  "So much I learn, and I think deeply.
'Who, or what, are this so strange being
called Dolores?’ I ask me.

  "The nighttime comes, I go to bed and
anon there comes a great and dreadful
bird which claws at my window and
makes dire threats against me if I divulge
what I have learned that day. You say it
are an owl. Perhaps. B.ut does an owl
talk with human words, my friend? Not
ordinarily, you will concede.

  "All quickly comes the call from Mon-
sieur FitzPatrick, and to his house we go
to seek the lost Dolores. The dog leads
us well, but he scents something—some-
thing evil which we can not see—and
turns to run away. Long since I have
learned to trust the animal instinct which
warns of evil and unseen things, and so
I take us back to die house and ask for
spiritual ammunition with which to fight
the danger which awaits us in the cem-
etery.”

   "Yes, I wanted to ask you about that,”
I interrupted. "Wouldn’t anything ex-
cept a rosary and bottle of holy water
serve as protection diat night?”

  "Many things,” he agreed, "but they
were handiest. The Church of Rome has
no exclusive patent on fighting with and
conquering the evil ones, but her methods
are always efficacious—she has waged the
battle so long, and so successfully.”

   "But why should a cross, just because)
it is a cross, be valuable in such a case?”1
I persisted.

  He paused in thought a moment; then:
"Words much repeated, with a special
significance, in time acquire power,” he
replied. “Witchcraft is one of the world’s
214

WEIRD TALES

oldest curses. Before Egypt was, the
witch-cult flourished, and Babylonia and
Assyria both understood the witch's awful
power. Both had their charms against
her, but they are gone, and their charms
are gone with them. Then arose Chris-
tianity, and took up the battle with the
witch-brood. Now, when a rosary is
blessed and when holy water is dedicated,
the priest says certain words—always the
same, and always with the same intent.
The formula has become invincible
through centuries of repetition. Consider:
You can not hear the music of your na-
tional anthem without a sudden tingling
in your cheeks, a sudden contraction of
the throat, a quick feeling of exaltation.
Words, my friend, the power of words
to conjure into sudden being a certain
train of thought and a definite physical
reaction. So it is with prayers oft re-
peated. Yes.

   "Very well. With these spiritual weap-
ons we returned to the old cemetery, and
there we encounter and subdue three
evil creatures which posed as bats. Per-
haps they were such; perhaps, again, they
were something else. At any rate, we
routed them, and then we found Dolores
apparently lying lifeless on a long-for-
gotten grave. Morbleu, the whole thing
stank of witchery, my friend.

  "Bethink you: It was the night of
August first, the feast of St. Peter’s
Chains, or Lammas, as the English-speak-
ers call it. That was one of the great
gathering days of the witches of olden
times, the others being Candlemas in
February, Roodmass, or May Eve, and All
Hallow Eve, or Halloween. And, my
friend, in spite of all the learned fools
tell us to the contrary, tvitchcraft still
lives!

   "Through the years and centuries it has
given ground before the new religion,
but in remote places it still survives. In
Italy, despite repressive measures, ’the old
religion’ as they call it, la vecchia reli-
gione, still numbers many followers.

  "And in other lands—in every land-r-
who are better fitted to keep alive the old,
unholy fires of witchcraft than the
Gipsies? They are a race apart, they
neither mingle nor intermarry with th,e
people among whom they live. Their
men may be thieves, but their women are
open practisers of the black art. Do they
not boast of second sight and 'dukkering-
and charms to injure enemies or break the
spells laid on by others? But yes.

  "Nor have actual proven instances of
acts more sinister been lacking. In Estre-
madura four Gipsy women were taken by
the Spanish government and made to
own they had killed and eaten a friar, a
pilgrim and a woman of their own tribe.
And remember, Dolores’ mother was a
woman of the Spanish Gipsies. That has
much bearing on the case.

  "You will recall I asked you if you’d
read your Bible lately concerning those
possessed of devils? For why? Because
the learned numbskulls who write the
'higher criticism’ have been at pains to
tell us demoniacal possession was but
epilepsy. Perhaps, but will the rule not
work both ways? If epilepsy may simu-
late possession by fiends, why should not
such possession mimic epilepsy?

  M 'Nonsense,’ you say? Ah bah, I damn
think my hypothesis was proved when her
you did think dead of epilepsy came sud-
denly to life in your very arms that night.

  "I did foresee her second death. Yes.
Her body was the dwelling-place of evil,
and had been racked by its tenants. The
sleep and rest of death was needed, and
DAUGHTER OF THE MOONLIGHT

215

to it she resorted. Such cases are not un-
known.

  "And so, when she had apparently died
a 'natural’ death, I besought that she be
embalmed, or that you have her subjected
to an autopsy, so that she might be for-
ever rendered incapable of functioning as
a living being again.

  "But she was clever—almost as clever
as I. She had outguessed modern mortu-
ary science by leaving a testament ex-
pressly forbidding embalming, and you
refused an autopsy.

  "By Monsieur FitzPatrick’s permission
I went through all her correspondence.
There she had been lax—she had not
thought of Jules de Grandin, for he had
simulated indifference in her case and
had not called upon her once while his
good friend Trowbridge was treating her
to prevent the death she had already de-
cided on.

  "Among her papers I found but little
that would guide me, but finally I came
on that which I did seek, a little note
from the young Millington in answer to
one of hers, and in it he did renew his
promise to take her from the grave, 'if
she should die’ (how well she had re-
hearsed him for his role!) and lay her
body where the first faint rays of the new
moon might rest upon it!

  "That was the key, my friend. In
Greece, where warlocks still make sport
of science and religion, when members of
the witch-cult desire to shift their scene
of operations, or when discovery hovers
close behind them, they take refuge in
the tomb. They 'die’ as this one did. But
always their 'deaths' are due to some

cause which leaves no outward wound
upon their bodies—no injury which
would prevent their future functioning.
Then, if they be exhumed and placed be-
neath the new moon’s rays, soon after
burial, they rise again, as though re-
freshed by the nap taken in the grave—
and wo betide the poor unfortunate who
catches their first waking glance! With
teeth and nails, like maddened brute
beasts, they tear his throat away, and rip
his heart from- out his breast and eat it.
It is their custom so to do; a most un-
pleasant one, I think.

  "Accordingly, we watched beside her
grave tonight; we saw the poo:, infatu-
ated Millington exhume her; we saw him
bear her to the hilltop and lay her where
the moon could shine upon her; we even
saw the beginning of her return to life
and wickedness. But Jules de Grandin
nipped her resurrection in the bud by
shooting her, and now her lovely body
lies in the grave with shattered brain, and
never more may evil spirits use it for
their evil ends. No, she has said at last to
the grave, "Thou art my father and my
mother,’ and to corruption, 'Thou art my
lover and my bridegroom.’ Her business
in this world is finished.”

  "But,” I began, "in the philosophy of
witchcraft-”

  "Ho, you do remind me of another
philosophy,” he interrupted with a grin:

     "Who loves not woman, wine and song
     Remains a fool his whole life long.

  "I sing most execrably; the love of
woman is a gift denied me; but thanks
be to kindly heaven my taste for wine is
unabated. Come, let us drink and go to
bed!”

“Like a white wraith she darted here and there,
followed by the pack,”

1HAVE grown old and credulous.
Such a thing simply could not hap-
pen. Not in this country, and not
in this day. But—believe me or not, as
you please—I tell you I saw it.

  Ever since Ken Graham first walked
into my classroom, I have wished that I
might have had such a son. And as the
years went by, my fondness for him
grew, and I began to dream that some
day he should take my place, and com
plete the collection of minerals which has
bsroughc me and this old school fame.

    216

  Why not? After graduating with hon-
ors, the boy had two years of study in
the best schools abroad, and then a year
of practical work in the field. What else
did he need? Only that I should pull
the strings my own departmental Punch
dances to, and have him designated as-
sistant professor of mineralogy.

  So I pulled die strings, and the
appointment was made. But he answered
with a strange, incoherent letter begging
delay.

  I could not understand it. Perhaps
THE LAW OF THE HILLS

217

that chit of a girl he had married in Nor-
way preferred a director of mines with
five thousand a year to an assistant pro-
fessor with half that salary. Idiot!
Couldn’t she see that I meant to make
him head of the department?

   I took out of my desk die picture they
had sent from Norway, and all my sus-
picions vanished.

   Surely there was no stupid selfishness
of that sort in the mate Ken Graham had
chosen. A sweet, unspoiled young face,
with a fine delicacy of feature. And yet
—such a strange suggestion of wildness!
That fluffy aureole of whitish hair! Those
keen, deep-set eyes! Those sharply out-
lined features! She looked like a beauti-
ful wild thing.

  Hush! A jealous old man’s imagin-
ings.

  In the end I decided that I would go
to them. I would seek them out, and
bring them back. This old stone house
was big enough for all of us to be happy
in, if happiness was possible. Old men
are arrogant sometimes—and I had set
my mind on spending the rest of my
days near the boy I had learned to love
as a son.

   When I got off the train, they told me
where I should find him. It was late,
but he would still be in his office, the
expressman said.

  "A bear for work, that Graham. He’s
never stopped since his wife died. Too
bad about his wife. The wolves got her
and Louis Bar j on one night, just a few
weeks ago. A great pity—a great pity.”

  Oh, my boy! My poor, poor boy!

   I could see him, as I came up the walk,
his head bent over his hands before the
uncurtained window.

  I tapped on the door, and walked in.

  "You, Professor? You? What brought
you here?”

  "Rocks, my boy,” I lied. "Rocks.
Specimens. Clarke at Ten Mile has un-
earthed a curious fossil—some sort of
Dig, he says. He claims it’s Jurassic Per-
mian. He’s set it far too early, of course,
but 1 came along to look at it. But
there’s time for that tomorrow. I wanted
to have a chat with you.”

  "And no one could be more welcome,”
he returned. "Come inside. It’s late,
and you have had a long, hard trip in.”
Of course I had—a damned hard trip
in. I’m getting old, and thirty hours on
a little, one-horse railroad is no joke to
me. But I did not intend to be bundled
off to bed until I had got to the bottom
of this thing that was making my boy
look like a man who had been through
the Valley of Death.

   "I’m sleeping here now,” he explained,
as he took me into a little room off his
office. "I had this place built some weeks

ago, after-”

   He did not finish, but stooped, and set
a match to the fire. The great pine knots
flamed and roared in the open fireplace.
He boiled water, and made tea, talking
all the time of mines, and mine-manage-
ment, and minerals.

WE smoked in silence a long while
after he had put the cups away.
Then I leaned over and put my hand on
his knee.

  "Ken, my boy. Could you tell the old
man?”

   He started, and looked at me seardiing-

ly-

"You wouldn’t believe me, Professor.”
"I am not a scoffer, son,” I answered.
He rose, and threw another knot of
pine on die fire. I watched the flames
218

curl up and around it. The young man’s
face was lost in shadow.

  "Do you believe in lycantrophy?”

  "Of course not. There is no such
thing.”

  "Of course not. There never was such
a thing. And yet, I tell you, I have seen
it happen.”

  Was the boy insane? Why, that was
old English superstition. It belonged to
the days of witchcraft and burnings.
Never since the Sixteenth Century had
intelligent men of any country in the
world, save Russia, talked of such things
seriously. Absurd!

  "My wife,” he went on, without look-
ing up, "never knew much about her
father. He was killed, it was said, in a
hunting accident the second winter after
his marriage. His wife died of shock
the day the news reached her, and left
a little daughter two hours old. That is
all Hilde ever knew of her parents.

  "She was brought up on the old estate,
under the personal direction of her
grandfather. He was passionately fond
of her, but he watched with an eagle eye
over all her study and her play. The old
man was a constant contradiction to
Hilde. He would never allow her living
pets of any kind, for one thing. He
took her to England, France, and Egypt,
but never permitted her to holiday in the
mountains of her own beloved Norway.
Even when she went to Torghatten, her
course of study was laid down by that
inconsistent old man. He seemed to show
his affection for her by suppressing all
the instincts that were strongest.

  "It was at Torghatten that I met her
—and we loved each other.

  "The old gentleman received me with
great kindness, when I visited him. He
had many questions to ask me about my

parentage, and my work. I answered
them all as I could, and did not wonder
much at the seriousness with which he
asked them, though I had the impression
continually that there was something he
wanted to say to me, something that
preyed upon his mind. At times he
seemed happy in our happiness, and
planned with us the details of our mar-
riage. Then, in the very midst of the
planning, he would start up with fear in
his face, and speak as if it all must stop.

  "Once he started to say something
about his son, Hilde’s father, but stopped
short before he had well begun.

  "To the very day we sailed from Nor-
way, he was a constant puzzle to us.

  "When this offer came from Meakins
& Company, I hesitated to bring my
bride into a rough camp like this. But
Hilde insisted she would love it. All
her life she wanted to live in the solitary
places, to climb hills, and be free. She
begged me to accept at once.

  "We came north a few days later, as
you know. I built her a little bungalow
on the hill yonder, just across the river.
Before I had the foundation laid, she had
flowers growing all about the place,
native flowers which she had never seen
before, but which she transplanted and
tended with passionate care.

  "She turned our little cabin into a very
bower of beauty, and there was not in the
world anyone more exultantly happy
than she.

  "Often she took long walks alone,
while I was at the mill. I have come
home many times to find a note on the
table to say that we would have tea on
the Baldman. She would be waiting
there with a picnic supper. And all
through the long summer days we were
THE LAW OF THE HILLS

211)

happier by far than I had ever dreamed
of being.

  "Then came winter.

  "All of a sudden it came. The cold
set in overnight. A driving storm that
lasted for three days buried the country-
side in drifts. It was the northern winter
at its worst.

  "One night”—here the boy paused to
breathe heavily, and his face was set—
"one night we were sitting cozily by the
fire reading, when suddenly a woif
howled quite near.

  "Hilde went deathly white, and
clutched my hand.

  "I took her in my arms, and laughed
at her, and told her there was no cause
for alarm, and that his majesty would be
bold indeed, and very hungry, before he
would dare attack any human.

  "But nodiing that I could say really
comforted her, and from that time on.
she w-as in terror of being left alone,
especially at night.

“A month or so later, I was kept late
X*. at the mill, and it wras nearly
eleven before I started home. Going up
the hill, I heard the wolves again. There
is no mistaking the cry of the timber
wolf, and I ran up the steps hoping that
Hilde had not heard.

  "There was no light in the house, and
[ tiptoed into her room, trying not to
wake her till the sound had died away.

  "The moon shone in the window', and
there was my girl, crouched down on the
floor, peering out into the night. She
seemed in the grip of an agony of emo-
tion dreadful to see, and did not know
diat I was there at all.

  "I touched her on the shoulder. She
turned like a flash, and looked at me for
a moment with only fear in her face.

Then she crumpled up in my arms, and
sobbed hysterically until she fell asleep.’

  Ken drew a gusty sigh and paused, his
pipe forgotten in his hand.

  "I could not understand it at all,” he
went on. "She was not a coward. There’s
a little lake up in the hills where we used
to swim, and I have seen her dive into
the water from twenty feet up the cliff.
So it was more than fear that troubled
her. It was some deeper dread of which
she could not speak.

  "She was never her old self after that
night when she cried hefself to sleep. At
times she would lavish passionate, tear-
ful love on me. At other times, she was
absent-minded and lost in somber reflec-
tions of her owrn.

  "One night, when I came early home,
she was not there. I was searching
frantically for her when she came quietly
up the path, bareheaded and alone.
There was such a look in her eyes as I
have seen in the eyes of the dead, and I
followed her in silence into the house,
fear clutching at my heart.

  "The wolves were frequently to be
heard in those days. The heavy snow
had made them very bold. Once they
came so close to the house that I reached
for my rifle determined to teach at least
one of them a lesson in restraint. But
Hilde caught my arm, and stopped me.

"I knew her tenderness for wild
things, and put my .22 away in the shed.

  "When I came back into the room, she
was not there. Vaguely uneasy, I
searched for her in the bedroom. She
was not there. But the window was
open, and I saw among the trees a lithe,
gray-white form that flashed across the
shadows and was gone.

  "I won’t go into the details of that
night. All sorts of horrors came to me—
220

WEIRD TALES

old folk-tales of Norway that the people
of the hills believed in, stories of the
taint that ran in certain families and of
the dread deeds done at night 'by the
will of the Foul Fiend.’ I kept wonder-
ing, too, about the death of Hilde’s
father, and asking over and over again
whether I had gone out of my mind.

  "Suddenly the door opened and there
stood Hilde, her fair hair white with
loose fluffs of snow. She looked tired
and worn, and with only a furtive glance
at me she hurried to her room and slept
heavily till noon.

  "She was frequently absent after that,
and I never knew, when I came home at
night, whether she would be there or
not.

  Again the boy paused, staring at the
fire. And again he went on.

  "One day, there was an explosion at
the northern mine, and I went up to try
and get things moving again. No train
came out that night, so I decided to
tramp the eleven miles back rather than
leave Hilde alone.

  "Just a few miles from home, I re-
alized that I -was being followed by
wolves. I was not armed, and there was
nothing for it but to climb a tree. A
broken-off oak stump stood near the
track. It offered no protection from the
wind, but I knew that from it I should
be able to hail the log train in the morn-
ing if necessary. So I scrambled up in
some haste.

  "Within two minutes there were four-
teen timber wolves squatting in a circle
about that stump. You know their meth-
od—a short wait to see if you’re going to
run for it, then a half turn to the left,
and a steady circling march around their
victim.

  "I don’t know what the end of

that death-march would have been, for
just as I was bending all my will-power
to fight the hypnotism of it, there dashed
down the railway track a slender white
wolf. Like a mad thing she darted here
and there about that circle, then flashed
away among the trees, with the whole
pack behind her.

  "I waited till their cry had died away
in the distance, then climbed stiffly down,
and hurried home. Hilde was waiting
for me at the door. There was a curious
brightness in her eyes, and she listened
with some tension, I thought, to the ex-
planation of my lateness. But I said
nothing at all of my adventure with the
wolves.

“ \ few nights later, Louis Barjon
A dropped in after supper. For once
Hilde was almost herself. She was read-
ing by the fire, while Louis and I
smoked.

  " 'Never saw the wolves so bold as this
year,’ said Louis. 'Have you seen the
white one? White as a snow-drift, she is,
and swift as the wind. She seems to
come out of nowhere to join the pack,
and they’re devils when she’s with them.
She’s the most beautiful animal I’ve ever
seen, but I bet she’s as keen on the kill
as any of the dirty crew.’

  "Hilde dropped her book. 'The white
wolf never kills,’ she said.

  "Louis turned and looked at her in
astonishment. Was it merely girlish
sentiment for a lovely wild thing? Evi-
dently Louis thought so, for he laughed
tolerantly and went on, 'Well, maybe.
But folks is laying for her. It’s hardly
safe to go out at night, so keep your rifle
handy, boy.’

  "I remembered the one night when I
did take my rifle down. I glanced at
THE LAW OF THE" HILLS

221

Hilde. Her eyes were wide, and her
nostrils dilated. What was the emotion
that swayed her? My heart contracted.

  " 'Did you ever see her?’ demanded
Louis again. I thought of the gray-white
form I had seen flitting among the trees,
and of the beautiful white beast that had
saved me from the pack only a few
nights before. But I shook my head in
denial.

  " Tve seen her twice/ he went on.
'The other night I took a flying shot at
her, and I caught her on the right front
paw. But it was just a scratch, I guess,
for there was only a bit of blood on the
snow.’

  "In spite of myself, I glanced at
Hilde’s right forearm. She had it tightly
bandaged. I looked up at her face. Her
eyes were fixed on the back of Louis’
head as he picked a coal out of the fire
for his pipe.

  "Was it only fancy, or did her lips
draw back from her white teeth?

  "My heart seemed to stop beating.
That picture is engraved on my mind for-
ever. Old Louis, bluff and weather-
beaten, leaning down over the fire; Hilde
watching him with a sort of sinister
ferocity; and I dumb with terror.

  "In silence I let him rise, and wind
his long scarf about his neck, and go out
into the night.

  "I shut the door behind him, and
turned hastily to Hilde. I was too late.
She was gone. I went to her bedroom.
She was not there, nor in any other room
in the house.

  "A sense of black tragedy engulfed
me. I clung with all my might to my
love for her, and I prayed to know the
secret the old man in Norway would
have told me before we came away.

  "My whole soul revolted at the con-
clusions that were forcing themselves on
me, and I waited in horror for what the
morning would bring. I don’t think I
thought much after a while. My mind
seemed numbed. I just sat and waited,
with a curious sense of waiting for more
than her coming home.

  "Toward morning it started to snow
heavily. I built up the fire, and put the
kettle on to boil.

   "Then I heard a sound outside, a whin-
ing and a heavy scratching sound. I flung
open the door.

  "Call me mad, if you will—but there
in the snow was the white wolf. She was
staggering and covered with blood, and
scarcely able to drag her hindquarters
into the room. The beautiful animal
crawled weakly to my feet, and rubbed
her head against my knee like a dog.

  "I took her head between my hands,
and she looked up with those pleading
eyes I knew, licked my hand once or
twice, and sank on the floor—dead.

  "I knew my girl would never come
home again.

  "I knew—God! that such things
should be!—that the old law of the hills
had held, that ancient, dreadful law that
said there was no return for the were-
wolf that once had spilled the blood of
human kind.

  "I knew, too, what they would tell me
that day—that old Louis was dead, that
he had accounted for half the pack before
they had got him, but that they had got
him in the end.

  "And then I told them that my wife
had gone with Louis, that she had gone
to spend a day with his wife, to help her
with the quilting. They were deeply dis-
tressed, and searched everywhere. But
they found no trace or sign of her at all.

  "I buried the white wolf that night,
under the pine trees. And the wolves
howled about the place till dawn.

  "Since then I have waited, hoping
against hope that some day I will wake
and find that I have only been insane.

  "I have not the courage to sleep at the
cottage now, but I go there every day to
see if perhaps she has come home. But I
know, as there is a God in heaven, that
all that is mortal of my girl lies buried
there under the pine trees, where her
garden was last year.”

For an hour he sat there, his head
bowed in suffering, till from sheer
weariness he slept in his chair.

  I threw a coat around him, and built
up the fire, and sat there thinking, think-
ing, thinking in amazement and dread.

  The thing could not be, of course.
Yet, I had lived near enough to Mother
Earth to know that there are more things
under heaven than science has ever
dreamed of.

  But the proof of it? I had to have
some proof.

  I sat there till daylight. Then I made
strong coffee for the lad, and we had
breakfast when he woke. I told him all

that was going on around the old halls,
confessed that I had lied to him about
Clarke’s fossilized pig, and saw a hint of
the old twinkle return to his eyes.

  Then I slipped away.

  Now I should test this thing. Within
the hour I should know whethc-r the lad
had dreamed an ugly dream or had been
the victim of devil’s work.

  The cottage door was unlocked, wait-
ing Hilde’s return. Things were just as
she had left them, no doubt—her work-
bag in the corner, the book she had been
reading open on the table. But I did not
pause there. I went on through to the
garden.

  The grave was clearly marked by a
blazed cross on the giant pine. Frantical-
ly I began to dig, and as I turned out the
loose sand I prayed that I might prove
that the boy had only dreamed.

  I made my gruesome find. With my
hands I scraped away the earth that
covered the bare skull and the bony paws.
With my fingers I pried the long rows of
teeth apart, and looked.

  God! Was I too gone mad?

  In the sharp canines were little pits of
yellow, and one large molar had a solid
cap of gold.

“On the gravelly floor
lay the horror.”

FOR one who has never faced the:
danger of legal execution, I have a
rather queer horror of the electric
chair as a subject. Indeed, I think the
topic gives me more of a shudder than it
gives many a man who has been on trial
for his life. The reason is that I associate
the thing with an incident of forty years
ago — a very strange incident which
brought me close to the edge of the un-
known’s black abyss.

  In 1889 I was an auditor and investi-
gator connected with the Tlaxcala Mining
Company of San Francisco, which operated
several small silver and copper properties
in the San Mateo Mountains in Mexico.
There had been some trouble at Mine No.
3, which had a surly, furtive assistant
superintendent named Arthur Feldon;
and on August 6th the firm received a
telegram saying that Feldon had de-
camped, taking with him all the stock rec-
224

WEIRD TALES

ords, securities, and private papers, and
leaving the whole clerical and financial
situation in dire confusion.

  This development was a severe blow to
the company, and late in the afternoon
President McComb called me into his of-
fice to give orders for the recovery of the
papers at any cost. There were, he knew,
grave drawbacks. I had never seen Feldon,
and there were only very indifferent photo-
graphs to go by. Moreover, my own
wedding was set for Thursday of the fol-
lowing week—only nine days ahead—so
that I was naturally not eager to be hurried
off to Mexico on a man-hunt of indefinite
length. The need, however, was so great
that McComb felt justified in asking me to
go at once; and I for my part decided that
the effect on my status with the company
would make ready acquiescence eminently
worth while.

  I was to start that night, using the
president’s private car as far as Mexico
City, after which I would have to take a
narrow-gage railway to the mines. Jack-
son, the superintendent of No. 3, would
give me all details and any possible clues
upon my arrival; and then the search
would begin in earnest — through the
mountains, down to the coast, or among
the byways of Mexico City, as the case
might be. I set out with a grim determina-
tion to get the matter done—and success-
fully done—as swiftly as possible; and
tempered my discontent with pictures of
an early return with papers and culprit,
and of a wedding which would be almost
a triumphal ceremony.

  Having notified my family, fiancee, and
principal friends, and made hasty prepa-
rations for the trip, I met President Mc-
Comb at eight p. m. at the Southern Pa-
cific depot, received from him some writ-
ten instructions and a check-book, and
left in his car attached to the eight-fifteen

eastbound transcontinental train. The
journey that followed seemed destined for
uneventfulness, and after a good night’s
sleep I revelled in the ease of the private
car so thoughtfully assigned me; reading
my instructions with care, and formulating
plans for the capture of Feldon and the re-
covery of the documents. I knew the
Tlaxcala country quite well — probably
much better than the missing man—hence
had a certain amount of advantage in my
search unless he had already used the rail-
way.

  According to the instructions, Feldon
had been a subject of worry to Superin-
tendent Jackson for some time; acting
secretively, and working unaccountably in
the company’s laboratory at odd hours.
That he was implicated with a Mexican
boss and several peons in some thefts of
ore was strongly suspected; but though
the natives had been discharged, there was
not enough evidence to warrant any posi-
tive step regarding the subtle official. In-
deed, despite his furtiveness, there seemed
to be more of defiance than of guilt in the
man’s bearing. He wore a chip on his
shoulder, and talked as if the company
were cheating him instead of his cheating
the company. The obvious surveillance of
his colleagues, Jackson wrote, appeared to
irritate him increasingly; and now he had
gone with everything of importance in the
office. Of his possible whereabouts no
guess could be made; though Jackson’s
final telegram suggested the wild slopes of
the Sierra de Malinche, that tall, myth-
surrounded peak with the corpse-shaped
silhouette, from whose neighborhood the
thieving natives were said to have come.

  At El Paso, which we reached at two
a. m. of the night following our start, my
private car was detached from the trans-
continental train and joined to an engine
specially ordered by telegraph to take it
THE ELECTRIC EXECUTIONER

southward to Mexico City. I continued to
drowse till dawn, and all the next day
grew bored on the flat, desert Chihuahua
landscape. The crew had told me we were
due in Mexico City at noon Friday, but I
soon saw that countless delays were wast-
ing precious hours. There were waits on
sidings all along the single-tracked route,
and now and then a hot-box or other diffi-
cult)’ would further complicate the sched-
ule.

  At Torreon we were six hours late, and
it was almost eight o’clock on Friday eve-
ning—fully twelve hours behind schedule
—when the conductor consented to do
some speeding in an effort to make up
time. My nerves were on edge, and I could
do nothing but pace the car in desperation.
In the end I found that the speeding had
been purchased at a high cost indeed, for
within a half-hour the symptoms of a hot-
box had developed in my car itself; so that
after a maddening wait the crew decided
that all the bearings would have to be
overhauled after a quarter-speed limp
ahead to the next station with shops—the
factory town of Queretaro. This was the
last straw, and I almost stamped like a
child. Actually I sometimes caught my-
self pushing at my chair-arm as if trying to
urge the train forward at a less snail-like
pace.

  It was almost ten in the evening when
we drew into Queretaro, and I spent a fret-
ful hour on the station platform while my
car was sidetracked and tinkered at by a
dozen native mechanics. At last they told
me the job was too much for them, since
the forward truck needed new parts which
could not be obtained nearer than Mexico
City. Everything indeed seemed against
me, and I gritted my teeth when I thought
of Feldon getting farther and farther away
—perhaps to the easy cover of Vera Cruz
with its shipping or Mexico City with its

varied rail facilities—while fresh delays
kept me tied and helpless. Of course
Jackson had notified the police in all the
cities around, but I knew with sorrow what
their efficiency' amounted to.

  The best I could do, I soon found out.
was to take the regular night express for
Mexico City, which ran from Aguas
Calientes and made a five-minute stop at
Queretaro. It would be along at one a. m.
if on time, and was due in Mexico City at
five o’clock Saturday morning. When 1
purchased my ticket I found that the train
would be made up of European compart-
ment carriages instead of long American
cars with rows of two-seat chairs. These
had been much used in the early days ot
Mexican railroading, owing to the Euro-
pean construction interests back of the
first lines; and in 1889 the Mexican Cen-
tral was still running a fair number of
them on its shorter trips. Ordinarily I pre-
fer the American coaches, since I hate to
have people facing me; but for this once
I was glad of the foreign carriage. At such
a time of night I stood a good chance
of having a whole compartment to myself,
and in my tired, nervously hypersensitive
state I welcomed the solitude—as well a5
the comfortably upholstered seat with soft
arm-rests and head-cushion. running the
whole width of the vehicle. I bought a
first class ticket, obtained my valise from
the sidetracked private car, telegraphed
both President McComb and Jackson of
what had happened, and settled down in
the station to wait for the night express as
patiently as my strained nerves would let
me.

For a wonder, the train was only half
an hour late; though even so, the soli-
tary station vigil had about finished my
endurance. The conductor, showing me
into a compartment, told me he expected
226

WEIRD TALES

to make up the delay and reach the capital
on time; and I stretched myself comfort-
ably on the forward-facing seat in the ex-
pectation of a quiet three-and-a-half hour
run. The light from the overhead oil
lamp was soothingly dim, and I wondered
whether I could snatch some much-needed
sleep in spite of my anxiety and nerve-
tension. It seemed, as the train jolted into
motion, that I was alone; and I was hearti-
ly glad of it. My thoughts leaped ahead
to my quest, and I nodded with the accel-
erating rhythm of the speeding string of
carriages.

  Then suddenly I perceived that I was
not alone after all. In the corner diagon-
ally opposite me, slumped down so that
his face was invisible, sat a roughly clad
man of unusual size, whom the feeble
light had failed to reveal before. Beside
him on the seat was a huge valise, bat-
tered and bulging, and tightly gripped
even in his sleep by one of his incongru-
ously slender hands. As the engine
whistled sharply at some curve or crossing,
the sleeper started nervously into a kind
of watchful half-awakening; raising his
head and disclosing a handsome face,
bearded and clearly Anglo-Saxon, with
dark, lustrous eyes. At sight of me his
wakefulness became complete, and I won-
dered at the rather hostile wildness of his
glance. No doubt, I thought, he resented
my presence when he had hoped to have
the compartment alone all the way; just as
I was myself disappointed to find strange
company in the half-lighted carriage. The
best we could do, however, was to accept
the situation gracefully; so I began apolo-
gizing to the man for my intrusion. He
seemed to be a fellow-American, and we
would both feel more at ease after a few
civilities. Then we could leave each other
in peace for the balance of the journey.

  To my surprize, the stranger did not re-
spond to my courtesies with so much as a
word. Instead, he kept staring at me
fiercely and almost appraisingly, and
brushed aside my embarrassed proffer of a
cigar with a nervous lateral movement of
his disengaged hand. His other hand still
tensely clutched the great, worn valise, and
his whole person seemed to radiate some
obscure malignity. After a time he abrupt-
ly turned his face toward the window,
though there was nothing to see in the
dense blackness outside. Oddly, he ap-
peared to be looking at something as in-
tently as if there really were something to
look at. I decided to leave him to his own
curious devices and meditations without
further annoyance; so settled back in my
seat, drew the brim of my soft hat over my
face, and closed my eyes in an effort to
snatch the sleep I had half-counted on.

  I could not have dozed very long or
very fully when my eyes fell open as if in
response to some external force. Closing
them again with some determination, I re-
newed my quest of a nap, yet wholly with-
out avail. An intangible influence seemed
bent on keeping me awake; so raising my
head, I looked about the dimly lighted
compartment to see if anything were amiss.
All appeared normal, but I noticed that
the stranger in the opposite corner was
looking at me very intently—intently,
though without any of the geniality or
friendliness which would have implied a
change from his former surly attitude. I
did not attempt conversation this time, but
leaned back in my previous sleepy posture;
half closing my eyes as if I had dozed off
once more, yet continuing to watch him
curiously from beneath my down-turned
hat brim.

  As the train rattled onward through the
night I saw a subtle and gradual metamor-
phosis come over the expression of the
THE ELECTRIC EXECUTIONER

227

staring man. Evidently satisfied that I was
asleep, he allowed his face to reflect a curi-
ous jumble of emotions, the nature of
which seemed anything but reassuring.
Hatred, fear, triumph, and fanaticism
flickered compositely over the lines of his
lips and the angles of his eyes, while his
gaze became a glare of really alarming
greed and ferocity. Suddenly it dawned
upon me that this man was mad, and dan-
gerously so.

   I will not pretend that I was anything
but deeply and thoroughly frightened
when I saw how things stood. Perspira-
tion started out all over me, and I had hard
work to maintain my attitude of relaxa-
tion and slumber. Life had many attrac-
tions for me just then, and the thought of
dealing with a homicidal maniac—possi-
bly armed and certainly powerful to a
marvelous degree—was a dismaying and
terrifying one. My disadvantage in any
sort of struggle was enormous; for the
man was a virtual giant; evidently in the
best of athletic trim, while I have always
been rather frail, and was then almost
worn out with anxiety, sleeplessness, and
nervous tension. It was undeniably a bad
moment for me, and I felt pretty close to
a horrible death as I recognized the fury of
madness in the stranger’s eyes. Events
from the past came up into my conscious-
ness as if for a farewell—just as a drown-
ing man’s whole life is said to resurrect
itself before him at the last moment.

   Of course I had my revolver in my coat
pocket, but any motion of mine to reach
and draw it would be instantly obvious.
Moreover, if I did secure it, there was no
telling what effect it would have on the
maniac. Even if I shot him once or twice
he might have enough remaining strength
to get the gun from me and deal with me
in his own way; or if he were armed him-

self he might shoot or stab without trying
to disarm me. One can cow a sane man
by covering him with a pistol, but an in-
sane man’s complete indifference to conse-
quences gives him a strength and menace
quite superhuman for the time being.
Even in those pre-Freudian days I had a
common-sense realization of the danger-
ous power of a person without normal in-
hibitions. That the stranger in the corner
was indeed about to start some murderous
action, his burning eyes and twitching
facial muscles did not permit me to doubt
for a moment.

  Suddenly I heard his breath begin to
come in excited gasps, and saw his chest
heaving with mounting excitement. The
time for a showdown was close, and I
tried desperately to think of the best thing
to do. Without interrupting my pretense
of sleep, I began to slide my right hand
gradually and inconspicuously toward the
pocket containing my pistol; watching the
madman closely as I did so, to see if he
would detea any move. Unfortunately he
did—almost before he had time to register
the fact in his expression. With a bound
so agile and abrupt as to be almost incred-
ible in a man of his size, he was upon me
before I knew what had happened; loom-
ing up and swaying forward like a giant
ogre of legend, and pinioning me with
one powerful hand while with the other
he forestalled me in reaching the revolver.
Taking it from my pocket and placing it
in his own, he released me contemptu-
ously, well knowing how fully his phy-
sique placed me at his mercy. Then he
stood up at his full height—his head al-
most touching the roof of the carriage—
and stared-'down at me with eyes whose
fury had quickly turned to a look of pity-
ing scorn and ghoulish calculation.
WEIRD TALES

Ibid not move, and after a moment the
man resumed his seat opposite me; i
sriitfing a ghastly smile as he opened his
great bulging valise and extracted an arti-
cle of peculiar appearance—a rather large
cage of semi-flexible wire, woven some-
what like a baseball catcher’s mask, but
shaped more like the helmet of a diving-
suit. Its top was connected with a cord
whose other end remained in the valise.
This device he fondled with obvious af-
fection, cradling it in his lap as he looked
at me afresh and licked his bearded lips
with an almost feline motion of the
tongue. Then, for the first time, he spoke
—in a deep, mellow voice of a softness
and cultivation startlingly at variance with
his rough corduroy clothes and unkempt
aspect.

   "You are fortunate, sir. I shall use you
first of all. You shall go into history as
the first fruits of a remarkable invention.
Vast sociological consequences—I shall
let my light shine, as it were. I'm radiat-
ing all the time, but nobody knows it. Now
you shall know. Intelligent guinea-pig.
Cats and burros—it worked even with a
burro. ...”

   He paused, while his bearded features
underwent a convulsive motion closely
synchronized with a vigorous gyratory
shaking of the whole head. It was as
though he were shaking clear of some
nebulous obstructing medium, for the
gesture was followed by a clarification or
subtilization of expression which hid the
more obvious madness in a look of suave
composure through which the craftiness
gleamed only dimly. I glimpsed the dif-
ference at once, and put in a word to see
if I could lead his mind into harmless
channels.

   "You seem to have a marvelously fine
instrument, if I’m any judge. Won’t
you tell me how you came to invent it?”

  He nodded.

   "Mere logical reflection, dear sir. I
consulted the needs of the age and acted
upon them. Others might have done the
same had their minds been as powerful—
that is, as capable of sustained concentra-
tion—as mine. I had the sense of con-
viction—the available will-power—that
is all. I realized, as no one else has yet
realized, how imperative it is to remove
everybody from the earth before Quetzal-
coatl comes back, and realized also that
it must be done elegantly. I hate butch-
ery of any kind, and hanging is barbar-
ously crude. You know last year the
New York legislature voted to adopt elec-
tric execution for condemned men—but
all the apparatus they have in mind is
as primitive as Stephenson’s 'Rocket’ or
Davenport’s first electric engine. I knew
of a better way, and told them so, but they
paid no attention to me. God, the fools!
As if I didn’t know all there is to know
about men and death and electricity—
student, man and boy—technologist and
engineer—soldier of fortune. ...”

   He leaned back and narrowed his eyes.

  "I was in Maximilian’s army twenty
years and more ago. They were going
to make me a nobleman. Then those
damned greasers killed him and I had to
go home. But I came back—back and
forth, back and forth. I live in Roches-
ter, N. Y____”

  His eyes grew deeply crafty, and he
leaned forward, touching me on the knee
with the fingers of a paradoxically deli-
cate hand.

   "I came back, I say, and I went deeper
than any of them. I hate greasers, but I
like Mexicans! A puzzle? Listen to me,
young fellow—you don’t think Mexico
! is really Spanish, do you? God, if you
; knew the tribes I know! In the moun-

tains—in the mountains—Anahuac—
Tenochtitlan—the old ones. . . .”

  His voice changed to a chanting and
not unmelodious howl.

  "la! Huitzilopotchli! . . . Nahuatla-
catl! Seven, seven, seven ,.. Xochimilca,
Chalca, Tepaneca, Acolhua, Tlahuica,
Tlascalteca, Azteca! . . . Ia! Ia! I have been
to the Seven Caves of Chicomoztoc, but
no one shall ever know! I tell you be-
cause you will never repeat it. . . .”

  He subsided, and resumed a conversa-
tional tone.

  *’It would surprize you to know what
things are told in the mountains. Huit-
zilopotchli is coming back ... of that
there can be no doubt. Any peon south
of Mexico City can tell you that. But I
meant to do nothing about it. I went
home, as I tell you, again and again, and
was going to benefit society with my
electric executioner when that cursed Al-
bany legislature adopted the other way.
A joke, sir, a joke! Grandfather’s chair

—sit by the fireside—Hawthorne-”

  The man was chuckling with a morbid
parody of good nature.

   "Why, sir, I’d like to be the first man
to sit in their damned chair and feel their
little two-bit battery current! It wouldn’t
make a frog’s legs dance! And they expea
to kill murderers with it—reward of merit
—everything! But then, young man, I saw
the uselessness—the pointless illogicality,
as it were—of killing just a few. Every-
body is a murderer—they murder ideas—
steal inventions—stole mine by watching,

and watching, and watching-”

  The man choked and paused, and I
spoke soothingly.

  "I’m sure your invention was much the
better, and probably they’ll come to use
it in the end.”

  Evidently my taa was not great

enough, for his response showed fresh
irritation.

  " 'Sure,’ are you? Nice, mild, con-
servative assurance! Cursed lot you care

—but you'll soon know! Why, damn
you, all the good there ever will be in that
elearic chair will have been stolen from
me. The ghost of Nezahualpilli told me
that on the sacred mountain. They
watched, and watched, and watched-”

  He choked again, then gave another of
those gestures in which he seemed to
shake both his head and his facial ex-
pression. That seemed temporarily to
steady him.

  "What my invention needs is testing.
This is it—here. The wire hood or
head-net is flexible, and slips on easily.
Neckpiece binds but doesn’t choke. Elec-
trodes touch forehead and base of cere-
bellum—all that’s necessary. Stop the
head, and what else can go? The fools
up at Albany, with their carved oak easy-
chair, think they’ve got to make it a head-
to-foot affair. Idiots!—don’t they know
that you don’t need to shoot a man through
the body after you’ve plugged him
through the brain? I’ve seen men die in
battle—I know better. And then their
silly high-power circuit—dynamos—-all
that. Why didn’t they see what I’ve done
with the storage-battery? Not a hearing
—nobody knows—I alone have the secret
—that’s why I and Quetzalcoatl and Huit-
zilopotchli will rule the world alone—I
and they, if I choose to let them. . .. But
I must have experimental subjeas—sub-
jects—do you know whom I've chosen
for the first?"

  I tried jocoseness, quickly merging
into friendly seriousness, as a sedative.
Quick thought and apt words might save
me yet.

  "Well, there are lots of fine subjeas
230

WEIRD TALES

among the politicians of San Francisco,
where I come from! They need your
treatment, and I’d like to help you intro-
duce it! But really, I think I can help
you in all truth. I have some influence
in Sacramento, and if you’ll go back to the
States with me after I’m through with my
business in Mexico, I’ll see that you get
a hearing.”

   He answered soberly and civilly.

  "No—I can’t go back. I swore not to
when those criminals at Albany turned
down my invention and set spies to watch
me and steal from me. But I must have
American subjects. Those greasers are
under a curse, and would be too easy;
and the full-blood Indians—the real chil-
dren of the feathered serpent—are sacred
and inviolate except for proper sacrificial
victims . . . and even those must be slain
according to ceremony. I must have
Americans without going back—and the
first man I choose will be signally hon-
ored. Do you know who he is?”

   I temporized desperately.

   "Oh, if that’s all the trouble, I’ll find
you a dozen first-rate Yankee specimens
as soon as we get to Mexico City! I know
where there are lots of small mining men
who wouldn’t be missed for days-”

  But he cut me short with a new and
sudden air of authority which had a touch
of real dignity in it.

   "That’ll do—we’ve trifled long enough.
Get up and stand erect like a man. You’re
the subject I’ve chosen, and you’ll thank
me for the honor in the other world, just
as the sacrificial victim thanks the priest
for transferring him to eternal glory. A
new principle—no other man alive has
dreamed of such a battery, and it might
never again be hit on if the world ex-
perimented a thousand years. Do you
know that atoms aren’t what they seem? j

Fools! A century after this some dolt
would be guessing if I were to let the
world live!”

As i arose at his command, he drew

-	additional feet of cord from the
valise and stood erect beside me; the wire
helmet outstretched toward me in both
hands, and a look of real exaltation on his
tanned and bearded face. For an instant
he seemed like a radiant Hellenic mysta-
gogue or hierophant.

  "Here, O Youth—a libation! Wine of
the cosmos—nectar of the starry spaces—
Linos — Iacchus — Ialemus—Zagreus—
Dionysos—Atys—Hylas — sprung from
Apollo and slain by the hounds of Argos
—seed of Psamathe—child of the sun—
Evoe! Evoe!”

  He was chanting again, and this time
his mind seemed far back amongst the
classic memories of his college days. In
my erect posture I noticed the nearness of
the signal cord overhead, and wondered
whether I could reach it through some
gesture of ostensible response to his cere-
monial mood. It was worth trying, so
with an antiphonal cry of "Evoe!” I put
my arms forward and upward toward him
in a ritualistic fashion, hoping to give the
cord a tug before he could notice the act.
But it was useless. He saw my purpose,
and moved one hand toward the right-
hand coat pocket where my revolver lay.
No words were needed, and we stood for
a moment like carven figures. Then he
quietly said, "Make haste!”

  Again my mind rushed frantically
about seeking avenues of escape. The
doors, I knew, were not locked on Mexi-
can trains; but my companion could easily
forestall me if I tried to unlatch one and
jump out.\ Besides, our speed was so
great that success in that direction would

probably be as fatal as failure. The only
thing to do was to play for time. Of the
three-and-a-half-hour trip a good slice was
already worn away, and once we got to
Mexico City the guards and police in the
station would provide instant safety.

  There would, I thought, be two dis-
tinct times for diplomatic stalling. If I
could get him to postpone the slipping on
of the hood, that much time would be
gained. Of course I had no belief that
the thing was really deadly; but I knew
enough of madmen to understand what
would happen when it failed to work. To
his disappointment would be added a
mad sense of my responsibility for the
failure, and the result would be a red chaos
of murderous rage. Therefore the ex-
periment must be postponed as long as
possible. Yet the second opportunity did
exist, for if I planned cleverly I might de-
vise explanations for the failure which
would hold his attention and lead him
into more or less extended searches for
corrective influences. I wondered just
how far his credulity went, and whether I
could prepare in advance a prophecy of
failure which would make the failure it-
self stamp me as a seer or initiate, or per-
haps a god. I had enough of a smatter-
ing of Mexican mythology to make it
worth trying; though I would try other de-
laying influences first and let the prophecy
come as a sudden revelation. Would he
spare me in the end if I could make him
think me a prophet or divinity? Could I
"get by” as Quetzalcoatl or Huitzilo-
potchli? Anything to drag matters out
till five o’clock, when we were due in
Mexico City.

   But my opening "stall” was the veteran
will-making ruse. As the maniac repeat-
ed his command for haste, I told him of
my family and intended marriage, and

asked for the privilege of leaving a mes-
sage and disposing of my money and ef-
fects. If, I said, he would lend me some
paper and agree to mail what I should
write, I could die more peacefully and
willingly. After some cogitation he gave
a favorable verdict and fished in his va-
lise for a pad, which he handed me sol-
emnly as I resumed my seat. I produced
a pencil, artfully breaking the point at the
outset and causing some delay while he
searched for one of his own. When he
gave me this, he took my broken pencil
and proceeded to sharpen it with a large,
horn-handled knife which had been in his
belt under his coat. Evidently a second
pencil-breaking would not profit me
greatly.

   What I wrote, I can hardly recall at
this date. It was largely gibberish, and
composed of random scraps of memor-
ized literature when I could think of noth-
ing else to set down. I made my hand-
writing as illegible as I could without de-
stroying its nature as writing; for I knew
he would be likely to look at the result
before commencing his experiment, and
realized how he would reaa to the sight
of obvious nonsense. The ordeal was a
terrible one, and I chafed each second at
the slowness of the train. In the past I
had often whistled a brisk gallop to the
sprightly "tac” of wheels on rails, but
now the tempo seemed slowed down to
that of a funeral march—my funeral
march, I grimly reflected.

   My ruse worked till I had covered over
four pages, six by nine; when at last the
madman drew out his watch and told me
I could have but five minutes more. What
should I do next? I was hastily going
through the form of concluding the will
when a new idea struck me. Ending
with a flourish and handing him the fia-
232

WEIRD TALES

ished sheets, which he thrust carelessly
into his left-hand coat pocket, I reminded
him of my influential Sacramento friends
who would be so much interested in his
invention.

  "Oughtn’t I to give you a letter of in-
troduction to them?” I said. "Oughtn’t
I to make a signed sketch and description
of your executioner so that they’ll grant
you a cordial hearing? They can make
you famous, you know—and there’s no
question at all but that they’ll adopt your
method for the state of California if they
hear of it through someone like me, whom
they know and trust.”

  I was taking this tack on the chance
that his thoughts as a disappointed inven-
tor would let him forget the Aztec-relig-
ious side of his mania for a while. When
he veered to the latter again, I reflected,
I would spring the "revelation” and
"prophecy.” The scheme worked, for
his eyes glowed an eager assent, though
he bruskly told me to be quick. He fur-
ther emptied the valise, lifting out a
queer-looking congeries of glass cells and
coils to which the wire from the helmet
was attached, and delivering a fire of run-
ning comment too technical for me to fol-
low yet apparently quite plausible and
straightforward. I pretended to note down
all he said, wondering as I did so whether
the queer apparatus was really a battery
after all. Would I get a slight shock
when he applied the device? The man
surely talked as if he were a genuine elec-
trician. Description of his own inven-
tion was clearly a congenial task for him,
and I saw he was not as impatient as be-
fore. The hopeful gray of dawn glim-
mered through the windows before he
wound up, and I felt at last that my
chance of escape had really become tan-
gible.

  But he, too, saw the dawn, and began
glaring wildly again. He knew the train
was due in Mexico City at five, and would
certainly force quick action unless I could
override all his judgment with engrossing
ideas. As he rose with a determined air,
setting the battery on the seat beside the
open valise, I reminded him that I had
not made the needed sketch; and asked
him to hold the headpiece so that I could
draw it near the battery. He complied
and resumed his seat, but with many ad-
monitions to me to hurry. After another
moment I paused for some information,
asking him how the victim was placed for
execution, and how his presumable strug-
gles were overcome.

  "Why,” he replied, "the criminal is
securely strapped to a post. It does not
matter how much he tosses his head, for
the helmet fits tightly and draws even
closer when the current comes on. We
turn the switch gradually—you see it
here, a carefully arranged affair with a
rheostat.”

  A new idea for delay occurred to me as
the tilled fields and increasingly frequent
houses in the dawnlight outside told of
our approach to the capital at last.

  "But,” I said, "I must draw the helmet
in place on a human head as well as be-
side the battery. Can’t you slip it on
yourself a moment so that I can sketch
you with it? The papers as well as the
officials will want all this, and they are
strong on completeness.”

  I had, by chance, made a better shot
than I had planned; for at my mention of
the press the madman’s eyes lit up afresh.

  "The papers? Yes—damn them, you
can make even the papers give me a hear-
ing! They all laughed at me and wouldn’t
print a word—Here, you, hurry up! We’ve
not a second to lose!”
THE ELECTRIC EXECUTIONER

233

  He had slipped the headpiece on and
was watching my flying pencil avidly.
The wire mask gave him a grotesque,
comic look as he sat there with nervously
twitching hands.

  "Now, curse ’em, they’ll print pic-
tures! I’ll revise your sketch if you make
any blunders—must be accurate at any
cost. Police will find you afterward—
they’ll tell how it works. Associated Press
item—back up your letter—immortal
fame . . . Hurry, I say—hurry, confound

     I*’

you!

The train was lurching over the poor-
er roadbed near the city, and we
swayed disconcertingly now and then.
With this excuse I managed to break the
pencil again, but of course the maniac at
once handed me my own which he had
sharpened. My first batch of ruses was
about used up, and I felt that I should
have to submit to the headpiece in a mo-
ment. We were still a good quarter-
hour from the terminal, and it was about
time for me to divert my companion to his
religious side and spring the divine
prophecy.

  Mustering up my scraps of Nahuan-
Aztec mythology, I suddenly threw down
pencil and paper and commenced to
chant.

  "Ia! Ia! Tloquenahuaque, Thou Who
Art All In Thyself! Thou, too, Ipalne-
moan, By Whom We Live! I hear, I hear!
I see, I see! Serpent-bearing Eagle, hail!
A message! A message! Huitzilopotchli,
in my soul echoes thy thunder!”

  At my intonations the maniac stared
incredulously through his odd mask, his
handsome face shown in a surprize and
perplexity which quickly changed to
alarm. His mind seemed to go blank a
moment, and then to recrystallize in an-

other pattern. Raising his hands aloft,
he chanted as if in a dream.

  "Mictlanteuctli, Great Lord, a sign! A
sign from within thy black cave! Ia! Tona-
tiuh-Metztli! Cthulhutl! Command, and
I serve!”

  Now in all this responsive gibberish
there was one word which struck an odd
cord in my memory. Odd, because it
never occurs in any printed account of
Mexican mythology, yet had been over-
heard by me more than once as an awe-
struck whisper amongst the peons in my
own firm’s Tlaxcala mines. It seemed
to be part of an exceedingly secret and
ancient ritual; for there were character-
istic whispered responses which I had
caught now and then, and which were as
unknown as itself to academic scholar-
ship. This maniac must have spent con-
siderable time with the hill peons and In-
dians, just as he had said; for surely such
unrecorded lore could have come from no
mere book-learning. Realizing the im-
portance he must attach to this doubly
esoteric jargon, I determined to strike at
his most vulnerable spot and give him the
gibberish responses the natives used.

  "Ya-R’lyeh! Ya-R’lyeh!” I shouted.
"Cthulhutl fhtaghn! Niguratl-Yig! Yog-
Sototl-”

  But I never had a chance to finish. Gal-
vanized into a religious epilepsy by the
exact response which his subconscious
mind had probably not really expected,
the madman scrambled down to a kneel-
ing posture on the floor, bowing his wire-
helmeted head again and again, and turn-
ing it to right and left as he did so.
With each turn his obeisances became
more profound, and I could hear his foam-
ing lips repeating the syllable "kill, kill,
kill,” in a rapidly swelling monotone. It
occurred to me that I had overreached
234

WEIRD TALES

myself, and that my response had un-
loosed a mounting mania which would
rouse him to the slaying-point before the
train reached the station.

  As the arc of the madman’s turnings
gradually increased, the slack in the cord
from his headpiece to the battery had nat-
urally been taken up more and more. Now,
in an all-forgetting delirium of ecstasy, he
began to magnify his turns to complete
circles, so that the cord wound round his
neck and began to tug at its moorings to
the battery on the seat. I wondered what
he would do when the inevitable would
happen, and the battery would be dragged
to presumable destruction on the floor.

  Then came the sudden cataclysm. The
battery, yanked over the seat’s edge by
the maniac’s last gesture of orgiastic
frenzy, did indeed fall; but it does not
seem to have wholly broken. Instead, as
my eye caught the spectacle in one too-
fleeting instant, the actual impact was
borne by the rheostat, so that the switch
was jerked over instantly to full current.
And the marvelous thing is that there
was a current. The invention. was no
mere dream of insanity.

  I saw a blinding blue auroral corusca-
tion, heard 'an ululating shriek more
hideous than any of the previous cries of
that mad, horrible journey, and smelled
the nauseous odor of burning flesh. That
was all my overwrought consciousness
could bear, and I sank instantly into ob-
livion.

When the train guard at Mexico
City revived me, I found a crowd
on the station platform around my com-
partment door. At my involuntary cry the
pressing faces became curious and dubious,
and I was glad when the guard shut out
ftll but thetrim doctorwhohad pushed his

way through to me. My cry was a very
natural thing, but it had been prompted
by something more than the shocking
sight on the carriage floor which I had
expected to see. Or I should say, by
something less, because in truth there was
not anything on the floor at all.

  Nor, said the guard, had there been
when he opened the door and found me
unconscious within. My ticket was the
only one sold for that compartment, and
I was the only person found within it.
Just myself and my valise, nothing more.

I had been alone all the way from Quere-
taro. Guard, doctor, and spectators alike
tapped their foreheads significantly at my
frantic and insistent questions.

  Had it all been a dream, or was I in-
deed mad? I recalled my anxiety and
overwrought nerves, and shuddered.
Thanking the guard and doctor, and
shaking free of the curious crowd, I stag-
gered into a cab and was taken to the
Fonda Nacional, where, after telegraph-
ing Jackson at the mine, I slept till after-
noon in an effort to get a fresh grip on
myself. I had myself called at one
o’clock, in time to catch the narrow-gage
for the mining country, but when I got
up I found a telegram under the door.
It was from Jackson, and said that Feldon
had been found dead in the mountains
that morning, the news reaching the mine
about ten o’clock. The papers were all
safe, and the San Francisco office had been
duly notified. So the whole trip, with its
nervous haste and harrowing mental or-
deal, had been for nothing!

  Knowing that McComb would expect
a personal report despite the course of
events, I sent another wire ahead and took
the narrow-gage after all. Four hours
later I was rattled and jolted into the sta*
tion of Mine No. 3, where Jackson was
THE ELECTRIC EXECUTIONER

235

waiting to give a cordial greeting. He was
so full of the affair at the mine that he did
not notice my still shaken and seedy ap-
pearance.

  The superintendent’s story was brief, and
he told me it as he led me toward the shack
up the hillside above the arrastre, where
Feldon’s body lay. Feldon, he said, had
always been a queer, sullen character, ever
since he was hired the year before; working
at some secret mechanical device and com-
plaining of constant espionage, and being
disgustingly familiar with the native work-
men. But he certainly knew the work, the
country, and the people. He used to make
long trips into the hills where the peons
lived, and even to take part in some of their
ancient, heathenish ceremonies. He hinted
at odd secrets and strange powers as often
as he boasted of his mechanical skill. Of
late he had disintegrated rapidly; growing
morbidly suspicious of his colleagues, and
undoubtedly joining his native friends in
ore-thieving after his cash got low. He
needed unholy amounts of money for
something or other—was always having
boxes come from laboratories and machine
shops in Mexico City or the States.

  As for the final absconding with all the
papers—it was only a crazy gesture of re-
venge for what he called “spying”. He was
certainly stark mad, for he had gone
across country to a hidden cave on the
wild slope of the haunted Sierra de Ma-
linche, where no white men live, and had
done some amazingly queer things. The
cave, which would never have been found
but for the final tragedy, was full of hid-
eous old Aztec idols and altars; the latter
covered with the charred bones of recent
burnt-offerings of doubtful nature. The
natives would tell nothing—indeed, they
swore they knew nothing—but it was

easy to see that the cave was an old rendez-
vous of theirs, and that Feldon had shared
their practices to the fullest extent.

  The searchers had found the place only
because of the chanting and the final cry. It
had been close to five that morning, and
after an all-night encampment the party
had begun to pack up for its empty-handed
return to the mines. Then somebody had
heard faint rhythms in the distance, and
knew that one of the noxious old native rit-
uals was being howled from some lonely
spot up the slope of the corpse-shaped
mountain. They heard the same old
names—Mictlanteuctli, Tonatiuh-Metzli,
Cthulhutl, Ya-R’lyeh, and all the rest—but
the queer thing was that some English
words were mixed with them. Real white
man’s English, and no greaser patter.
Guided by the sound, they had hastened up
the weed-entangled mountainside toward
it, when after a spell of quiet the shriek had
burst upon them. It was a terrible thing—a
worse thing than any of them had ever
heard before. There seemed to be some
smoke, too, and a morbid acrid smell.

  Then they stumbled on the cave, its en-
trance screened by scrub mesquites, but
now emitting clouds of foetid smoke. It was
lighted within, the horrible altars and gro-
tesque images revealed flickeringly by can-
dles which must have been changed less
than a half-hour before; and on the gravelly
floor lay the horror that made all the crowd
reel backward. It was Feldon, head burned
to a crisp by some odd device he had
slipped over it—a kind of wire cage con-
nected with a rather shaken-up battery
which had evidently fallen to the floor from
a nearby altar-pot. When the men saw it
they exchanged glances, thinking of the
“electric executioner” Feldon had always
boasted of inventing—the thing which
236

WEIRD TALES

everyone had rejected, but had tried to steal
and copy. The papers were safe in Feldon’s
open portmanteau which stood close by,
and an hour later the column of searchers
started back for No. 3 with a grisly burden
on an improvised stretcher.

  That was all, but it was enough to make
me turn pale and falter as Jackson led me
up past the arrastre to the shed where he
said the body lay. For I was not without
imagination, and knew only too well into
what hellish nightmare this tragedy some-
how supernaturally dovetailed. I knew
what I should see inside that gaping door
around which the curious miners clus-
tered, and did not flinch when my eyes
took in the giant form, the rough corduroy
clothes, the oddly delicate hands, the
wisps of burnt beard, and the hellish ma-
chine itself—battery slightly broken, and
headpiece blackened by the charring of
what was inside. The great, bulging port-
manteau did not surprise me, and I
quailed only at two things—the folded
sheets of paper sticking out of the
left-hand pocket, and the queer sagging of
the corresponding right-hand pocket. In a
moment when no one was looking I
reached out and seized the too familiar
sheets, crushing them in my hand without
daring to look at their penmanship. I
ought to be sorry now that a kind of panic
fear made me burn them that night with
averted eyes. They would have been a pos-
itive proof or disproof of something—but
for that matter I could still have had proof
by asking about the revolver the coroner
afterward took from that sagging
right-hand coat pocket. I never had the
courage to ask about that—because my
own revolver was missing after the night
on the train. My pocket pencil, too,
shewed signs of a crude and hasty

sharpening unlike the precise pointing I
had given it Friday afternoon on the ma-
chine in President McComb’s private car.
So in the end I went home still puz-
zled—mercifully puzzled, perhaps. The
private car was repaired when I got back to
Queretaro, but my greatest relief was cross-
ing the Rio Grande into El Paso and the
States. By the next Friday I was in San
Francisco again, and the postponed wed-
ding came off the following week.

 As to what really happened that
night—as I’ve said, I simply don’t dare to
speculate. That chap Feldon was insane to
start with, and on top of his insanity he had
piled a lot of prehistoric Aztec witch-lore
that nobody has any right to know. He was
really an inventive genius, and that battery
must have been the genuine stuff. I heard
later how he had been brushed aside in
former years by press, public, and poten-
tates alike. Too much disappointment isn’t
good for men of a certain kind. Anyhow,
some unholy combination of influences
was at work. He had really, by the way,
been a soldier of Maximilian’s.

  When I tell my story most people call
me a plain liar. Others lay it to abnormal
psychology—and heaven knows I was
overwrought—while still others talk of
“astral projection” of some sort. My zeal
to catch Feldon certainly sent my thoughts
ahead toward him, and with all his Indian
magic he’d be about the first one to recog-
nise and meet them. Was he in the railway
carriage or was I in the cave on the
corpse-shaped haunted mountain? What
would have happened to me, had I not de-
layed him as I did? I’ll confess I don’t
know, and I’m not sure that I want to
know. I’ve never been in Mexico
since—and as I said at the start, I don’t
enjoy hearing about electric executions.

“ IT AM very grateful to you for
■ your warning, Delam Oblene. I
A have sensed that things are not
just right here; would you mind
telling me the nature of the danger
which threatens me?” Kiser’s voice
showed 110 trace of fear as he spoke,
although his voice was subdued lest it
might carry to the acute ears of the
sentinel Crobe,

 The Story Thus Far

I

T ADDING safely on the planet Mars after a voyage j
•-'from Earth, Professor Hervy and hiss daughter
Ruth send Joseph Kiser, the third member of the
party, to reconnoiter the Martian city which lies
across the canal. He is met by one of the Martian
scientists, whose niece, Delam Oblene, warns him
that he is in danger. He does not return to the
space-ship, but Hervy and his daughter are hos-
pitably received by the Martians and taken to the
city in a “kandike,” or small airship. They learn
thatthe Martians are all reincarnated Earthlings,
retaining a knowledge of their last life on Earth.
After weeks of search, Kiser is seen, apparently i
oat of his mind, and he seizes Ruth and runs off j
with her into the forest, which is inhabited by a !
race of sub-men known as “marbs.”	i
238

WEIRD TALES

  “I, too, sensed a flaw in my uncle’s
hospitality when he was so annoyed
at my own unexpected appearance
upon the scene. Afterward, quite by
accident, I overheard him discussing
with his assistant, Anhui Pilluth, a
plan to dispose of you permanently.”
“Dispose of me! Why should he
wish to dispose of me?”

  “For the most part to further his
insane desire for scientific knowledge,
and secondarily for patriotic reasons.
He considers you and your discovery
a menace to Masovada if you should
be allowed to return to Earth and an-
nounce the success of your voyage.”
“And how does he plan to dispose
of me?”

  “He has perfected an operation by
means of which he transfers the in-
telligence of one being to the physical
body of another, and he plans to in-
terchange your personality witli that
of Nebond, a young marb which has
but recently been domesticated. Fur-
thermore, he has set Crobe, another
marb, to watch you, and were he to
learn that you had escaped your room
he would probably become violently
angry and run amuck. Crobe has the
strength of many men and if he
should rim amuck he would undoubt-
edly kill you before anything could
be done to*stop him.”

  Ignoring her reference to Crobe,
Kiser asked: “Just what would it
mean to me if he performed such an
operation ? ’ ’

  “It would mean that your mind and
your intelligence would occupy the
body of Nebond, the marb. Nebond
will possess your body and you his.
You will have your own memory,
your own mentality—inasmuch as it
can function through the brain of a
marb, which you will have in place of
your own.

  “Of course you will be unable to
use the brain of a marb as you would
use your own. The brute will be able
to use yours better than he did his
own once he gets accustomed to it,
will do things which you would loathe

to see your physical body do, and eat
things at which you would rebel if you
knew. He will reason only as a marb,
or slightly better due to the fact that
he has a human brain at his dis-
posal.”

  “I am indeed grateful to you, De-
lam Oblene, for having warned me. I
shall take French leave of Kabo and
let him look elsewhere for his experi-
mental material.”

  “Yes, you must go at once, but
pray do not mention that Kabo has
entertained you; for should it be
known that he had done so without
reporting the matter to the Legisla-
tive Council he would incur the dis-
favor of all Masovada. It would hu-
miliate him very much and would
profit you nothing.”

  “But how was he to communicate
with the authorities so soon?”

  “He has but to attune his mind to
a certain vibration to send his
thoughts wheresoever he wills.”

  “Ah, telepathy!”

  “No, not telepathy. In the Masova-
dan brain there is a concentration
center and in the nostrils of the Ma-
sovadan there are certain cells sensi-
tized to receive all thought vibration
which is attuned in harmony with
them. Thus we are able to project our
thoughts to anyone whose vibratory
rate we know and concentrate upon. ’'
* ‘ Indeed I shall say nothing of hav-
ing met with Kabo. But where had I
best go?”

  “I shall conduct you by kandike
back to your craft, and tomorrow I
shall provide for your being found by
the proper person. Please do not
judge Masovadan hospitality by that
of my poor deluded uncle, who would
sacrifice his honor to his mania for
scientific achievement and his desire
to solve one of the mooted questions
of the age. Remain well hidden here
in the shadows and I will return with
the kandike presently.”

  “But might you not encounter
Crobe upon your way to the landing-

terrace?”
EARTHWORMS OF KARMA

239

  “I have nothing to fear from Crobe
so long as he doesn’t suspect that you
have escaped him. I shall-”

  Just what she had intended to say
Kiser never knew, for just at that mo-
ment there was a coarse growl behind
them, and, turning suddenly, they
stood face to face with the giant
Crobe; his eyes protruding to the ex-
treme limit of their telescoping ped-
icles and glowing ominously, his huge
teeth bared like those of an angry
dog, and his whole attitude threaten-
ing as he stood poised as though ready
to spring forward and annihilate
everything in his path.

  True to Delam Oblene’s prediction
Crobe had flown into a rage at sight
of the Earthman in the garden. He
growled and stamped his foot in
anger, and as Kiser watched he saw
white froth appear upon his lips.

  Delam Oblene addressed the beast
in the strange musical language of
the Martians; her tone was emphatic
and she pointed toward the house but
the marb appeared not to have heard.
v She stepped forward and repeated
her command with yet more emphasis,
but by this time the beast was in a
frenzy of rage, and as she approached
him, he stooped and snapped vicious-
ly, barely missing her outstretched
hand.

  Then it was that Delam Oblene did
a very Earth-like feminine thing. She
sprang back with a scream — and
fainted.

  Knowing his own superior strength,
Kiser had first planned merely to
evade the beast and hold his attention
until Delam Oblene should have had
time to get her kandike and return,
but when he saw the enraged animal
attempt violence to the girl he
changed his plan—or rather, the plan
changed itself, and he leapt forward,
covering the distance between them at
a single bound. Striking with all his
strength behind the blow, he landed
squarely upon the receding chin of
his antagonist just as the beast bent
his long neck forward to resume the

quarrel at the point where Delam
Oblene had interrupted it.

  There was a loud snap like the
crack of a whip and Crobe was flung
far backward, to land upon his shoul-
ders limp and inert, his neck broken
and his face crushed as though he had
been struck by a ten-ton truck! Ki-
ser’s blow had been delivered with
all the strength of muscles developed
upon a planet whose gravitational
pull was much greater than Mars, and
the Mai’tian creatures were not so
constructed as to enable them to with-
stand such violence.

  The growls of Crobe aiid the girl’s
scrcam had aroused Kabo, and sud-
denly, as if by magic, the garden was
brilliantly illuminated, showing Crobe
lying mangled and dead and Kiser
kneeling beside the prostrate form of
Delam Oblene.

  “A nice guest you are, indeed!”
said Kabo with biting sarcasm.

  Kiser turned his head slightly to
face Kabo, but did not rise. He was
unwilling to accuse the Martian of
the perfidy which the girl had attrib-
uted to him and thus betray that she
had warned him.

  “No harm meant, I assure you,” he
said. “I strolled out into the garden
to enjoy the moonlight and your niece
followed me here to warn me about
some supposed danger from Crobe.
True to her fears, he attacked me and
I fear that I have killed him, for
which I am very sorry; it seems that
I am much stronger upon Mars than

I	was upon Earth.”

  “A pretty story indeed!” snarled
Kabo. “You Earthworm! Is there
yet no decency upon your filthy
planet? I shall not await the morrow
to settle with you!”

  Kiser rose hastily and started to
voice an angry protest, when l.e no-
ticed for the first time a small box
which Kabo carried under his arm.
Could this be a weapon? As he
opened his mouth to speak, his tongue
was very thick, his knees sagged, his
vision blurred, and there seemed a
240

faint, far-away ringing in his ears;
he then seemed to be falling through
untold millions of miles of space and
into—oblivion!

9.	Transformation

JOSEPH kiseb awoke with a feeling
of intense drowsiness. His lids
seemed heavy and he was unable to
see well or control the direction of his
vision for some moments after he had
succeeded in opening his eyes.

  At length he glanced about him. A
white-uniformed nurse sat beside the
bed upon which he lay and he tried to
speak to her, but his tongue was thick
and the best he did was an unintel-
ligible grunt.

  His mouth seemed much too large
and he controlled his facial muscles
with difficulty. When he attempted
to raise a hand to his face he noted
with Avonder that he was in a strait-
jaeket, and his wrists were lean and
hairy!

  Again he essayed to speak to the
nurse, but his tone startled him into
silence, for it was coarse and rasping
like the growl of an animal and he
was quite unable to control his tone
or inflection.

  "Where am I?” he asked at last in
a voice that was utterly unrecogniz-
able.

  The nurse gave him a perplexed
stare. She spoke some words in the
Martian tongue and Kiser thought she
appeared to be somewhat mystified at
this patient who appeared to be fully
awake and yet who had attempted to
converse in an altogether unintel-
ligible tongue. She pushed a button
which was fastened upon the wall, and
after a lapse of some moments, Kabo
stepped into the room.

  At sight of Kabo the memory of
the experience of the last evening
came vaguely back into Kiser’s mind.
He remembered his stroll about
Kabo’s gardens, his being warned of
some seemingly remote danger by a
wonderful Martian girl, his fight with

Crobe—but why was he thus invalid-
ed and bound? “What has happened
to me?” he roared in his strange
gruff voice, turning his head the bet-
ter to see the Martian, for, although
it may have been mere fancy begot of
his recent surroundings, his eyes
seemed to be protruding, telescoping
and unwieldy.

  There was a triumphant gleam in
Kabo’s eye, and Kiser went cold as
he suddenly recalled the text of De-
lam Oblene’s warning and the Mar-
tian’s threat just as he had lost con-
sciousness. This, together with the
recollection of the appearance of his
arm upon awakening, sent a thrill of
intense horror through him and he
strove with desperation to loosen the
thongs which held his wrists.

  "You must lie still,” remarked
Kabo calmly, although his tone was
not unkind. "Above all things you
must not worry and struggle like
this; you may do yourself great in-
jury if you continue to do so.”

  Kiser calmed himself with an ef-
fort. "Did you carry out your das-
tardly design upon me ? Did you
exchange my physical body for that
of a beast as you planned?”

  Kabo showed his surprize, “How
did you happen to suspect that I
might have had designs upon you?”
he asked.

  When Kiser did not answer but be-
gan again to pull and tug frantically
in another effort to free himself, the
Martian gave some instructions to the
nurse, who at once administered a
hypodermic.

  “You must desist in your efforts to
free yourself lest you injure your
chance of recovery. I shall see you
again when you are stronger.” With
this Kabo turned and left the room.

Kiser saw no more of Kabo for
several days, saw no one, in
fact, except the nurse, and he was un-
able to converse with her; but since
his talk with the Martian he had been
kept under the influence of some
EARTHWORMS OF KARMA

241

powerful narcotie, either in a deep
sleep or so benumbed that he took no j
interest in himself or his surround- ;
ings.

  Just how long he was kept under
the influence of drugs Kiser never
knew, but it must have been for sev-
eral days; for, when again he gained
control of his sensibilities, most of his
.soreness was gone and he had re-
gained his strength to a marked de-
gree. He could pull and wrench at
the straps which bound him without
pain or discomfort, but he could not
break them. For some moments he
strove desperately to free himself,
and when quite exhausted he turned
his head to look for the nurse. She
had left the room, but in his efforts
he had uncovered his chest and he
noted with horror that it was not his
own chest at all! Instead it was
very broad and sloped upward at a
grotesque and unsightly angle, and
was thickly covered with long red-
dish-black hair!

  Then it was that realization of the
truth came to him. Kabo had ex-
changed his intelligence for that of a
huge marb! Here was he, his soul,
his intelligence, his individuality, oc-
cupying the physical body of a filthy
beast!

  Stunned and horrified by the real-
ization of this terrible truth, he
ground his huge strong teeth in im-
potent rage. He longed to .strike
Kabo just such a blow as he had
struck Crobe; he could picture the
large but comparatively frail Martian
crumpling before the force of his
mighty muscles and he strove with
renewed energy to free himself. Sure-
ly no Martian bond could hold him;
him whose mighty blow had crushed
in the skull of a marb! But, alas!—
and the thought came to him with
sickening horror-—he no longer pos-
sessed the sinews of an Earthman!
Physically he was a marb although
he possessed the mentality of a man!
Was ever any poor creature treated
with such fearful injustice? His !
w. T.—3

  mind writhed in an agony of wrath
  and he struggled with desperation at
  : the bonds which held his wrists and
  ankles. They held, but surely they
  could not withstand such violence for
  long! Some day they would break
  and then he would rend Kabo limb
  from limb. This was such an excep-
  tional case as to make murder a vir-
  tue! And Kiser raged on, tugging,
  wrenching, snarling, and foaming at
  the mouth until forced to desist from
  sheer exhaustion.

    The nurse re-entered the room, and
  at sight of her he again flew into a
  convulsive rage, swearing, biting, and
  struggling against the straitjacket.
  The nurse drew back in fright but
  secured a long pointed strap from
  her handbag and approaching the bed
  struck Kiser a stinging lash across
  his thighs.

    Surprized and outraged, Kiser de-
  sisted for the moment to stare with
  wonder and resentment at the Mai'-
  tian girl. Apparently she was not.
  overjoyed at being special nurse to a.
  marb and she intended to enforce a
  certain degree of discipline even if it
  required coercive measures to do so.
  Evidently she had been chosen for
  this duty because she did not speak
  English, and undoubtedly she was
  ignorant of the fact that the creature
  before her was other than the beastly
  marb he appeared to be.

    She seemed more frightened than
  relieved, however, at the expression
  in Kiser’s eye as he looked at her now,
  and running quickly across the room,
  she again pushed the button with
  which she had previously summoned
  Kabo.

    At sight of his malefactor as he
  entered the room accompanied by his
  assistant, Anhui Pilluth, Kiser was
  so overcome with rage that he could
  not speak. For a moment he lay and
  glared with intense hatred at the two
  of them, and then with all his
  strength he pulled and twisted at the
  restraining straitjacket. The leather-
  like straps creaked and stretched un-
242

  der his efforts, but they held fast. At
length he recovered his voice and
hurled at Kabo a most violent impre-
cation, stating in no uncertain terms
just what he intended to do when he
should succeed in making liis escape.

  "You certainly have worked your-
self up to a most frightful amuck,”
said Kabo calmly after he had dis-
missed the nurse. "The marb brain
and the Earthly temperament work
beautifully together, I see, to say
nothing of the beautiful body I have
given you; a wonderful improvement
over your former self, I call it. Go
ahead and struggle if you must; you
could not release yourself in a dozen
years and it will do you no harm now.

I	am sure it would be useless to tell
you to desist, for you are now
equipped with the brain of a marb
and you will find it more difficult to
control yourself than formerly, if
that is possible. ’ ’

  "You are a liar! I have my own
brain, although you devils have given
me a marb’s body! ’ ’

 "Oh, no. You have Nebond’s
brain. Only the pineal glands and
a portion of the solar plexus were
transplanted. It was your mind
which I interchanged; not your
brains. The brain is but the medium
of contact of the mind with the phys-
ical body. The more important seat
of the ego or consciousness is in the
solar plexus, through which functions
the so-called subconscious mind. By
means of the pineal body we are en- I
abled to remember past events, but !
we recall them through the function-
ing of the physical brain; therefore I
transferred that organ so that you
could remember your past rather
than that of Nebond as would have
been the case had T not done this in-
terchange. ’ ’

  "You are a fiend! What right
have you to tamper with my soul, or
that of the beast if he lias one? I j
came here from another planet and
you take me in under the pretense of
hospitality merely to take advantage

I

  of my confidence to perpetrate upon
  me a crime ten thousand times more
  heinous than murder! You intro-
  duced me into a world in which you
  say crime has been abolished, and at
  that very moment you were formu-
  lating a crime unprecedented in its
  horror! What do you hope to gain
  by this? What benefit can you or
  your planet possibly derive from such
  a gruesome experiment as this?”
  "Alas, what you say is only too
  true, and I regret very much to have
  betrayed your confidence; but the
  end justifies the means. I have sac-
  rificed you to science and you should
  feel honored. I owe you an apology,
  however, for having misjudged your
  motive with reference to my niece.”
  "You owe me far more than an
  apology! What has happened to my
  body? The marb who possesses my
  body had better be guarded carefully,
  for I shall hold you responsible for
  any mishap which may occur to him
  and in any way injure my physical
  body. ’ ’

   "Why should you worry about
  what may or may not happen to that
  which was yours but is now the body
  of a marb? The body which you
  have here is now yours; the other one
  is his.”

     Kiser was fast losing control of his
  temper. ‘ ‘ I shall not suffer this state
  to continue. You have had your ex-
  periment at my expense, and now I
  demand that you restore me to my
  rightful body!”

“And destroy an experiment of
| which I have dreamed all of my life?

  Hardly! Surely, Earthman, you do
  | not consider your puny little physical
  body of more importance than the
  I scientific knowledge to be derived
  from the furtherance of this experi-
  ment! I was not surprized that the
  marl) objected to the thing, and by
  the way. he was even more bitter than
  you; when he awoke and learned tho
  truth his lamentations were most ter-
  rible to behold. He has been kept
  under the influence of the Strotan
EARTHWORMS OF KARMA

243

Ray until the present, because we
have no strait jacket strong enough to
hold him. Perhaps in my old age,
when I have watched the progress of
the experiment to my heart’s content,
I shall restore you to your Earth
form if you can sustain yourself and
if Nebond can sustain your Earth-
body for that long. At present, how-
ever, I shall make no such change; I
have started and I shall see this in-
teresting experiment through to the
end, however wicked you may think
me for so doing.”

  "You are not only a scoundrel but
a coward!” roared Kiser in a rage.
"If you do not undo this thing you
have done to me, neither you nor I
will live to be old; you may rest as-
sured of that! ”	!

  Anhui Pilluth had stood all the
while, his face expressionless, appar-
ently desiring to take no further part
in the tragic drama which was being
enacted at the expense of the Earth-
ling. Kiser imagined that he saw the
stamp of disapproval at the jeering re-
marks of Kabo as he watched the
face of the younger Martian, but he
could not be certain.

 Pilluth was a much larger man
than Kabo and his face was very in-
tellectual, if an Earthling might
judge rightly; his eyes seemed milder
and less domineering than Kabo’s,
and Kiser involuntarily wondered if
this man did not already regret his
part in the ghastly affair.

  "Nothing would please me more,”
said Kiser as the two Martians left
the room, "than to see your assistant,
who appears much more intelligent
than you—than to watch him while he
transfers your soul to the body of—
of an earthworm! ”

  He felt, however, that nothing
could be more wasted than efforts to
taunt Kabo; he appeared to have no
resentment, no emotion whatsoever
but his insatiable desire to perfect his
scientific supremacy and—oh yes! his
hatred of Earth and all things Earthly.

Kiser regretted his hasty remark*
which had betrayed the fact that
he foreknew Kabo’s intentions with!
regard to him, lest it might have
caused him to suspect Delam Oblene’a
real mission in the garden; for he felt
that otherwise Kabo was ignorant of
the fact that his niece knew of his
plans or suspected the fate to which
he had subjected the Earthling.

  If only Delam Oblene might find
him her influence might be brought to
bear upon Kabo and prevail upon him
to right the wrong he had done.

  He wondered what had become of
his sweetheart and her father but
dared not inquire of them to Kabo for
fear that the Martian might subject
them also to a fate like his own. If
only he might escape and go to them!
But no, he could not bear the thought
of Ruth’s seeing him in this state!
Perhaps she was even now awaiting
his return in an agony of suspense,
wondering, hoping, praying; yet not
dreaming the dreadful fate that had
befallen him.

 And yet it must be remembered
that Kiser’s intelligence was function-
ing through the sluggish brain of Ne-
bond, the marb, and therefore he was
incapable of the extremes of emotion
which he might have suffered had he
had a human brain; that is probably
the reason that the next few weeks of
mental anguish, humiliation, and de-
spair did not drive him mad.

  Had Delam Oblene forgotten her
promise or had Kabo told her that
Kiser had escaped and returned to
Earth? Perhaps she suspected the
fate that had befallen him but had
been unable to find him. For some
twenty days now he had not seen
Kabo and all of this time he had lain
bound as he had found himself upon
awakening, but he managed to exer-
cise his muscles somewhat each day.
The nurse had left him now and only
came to bring his meals and feed him
twice each day.

  One evening just at twilight the
door of his room opened softly and
244

WEIRD TALES

someone entered. Thinking it was the
nurse returning to perform some un-
finished duty Kiser did not turn for
some moments, but when, after a
time, he heard no further sound he
opened his eyes suddenly to see Delam
Oblene gazing sorrowfully down upon
him. At first the sight of the Martian
girl caused him a distinct thrill of
hopeful joy, but this was immediately
supplanted by a sense of shame that
she should behold the grotesqueness
of his appearance and witness the
evidence of his complete defeat at the
hands of Kabo.

  "Oh, I am so sorry!” whispered
Delam Oblene, her voiee trembling
with emotion, her eyes tearful and
sympathetic. “This is a terrible out-
rage ! I shall demand that you be lib-
erated at once! If the council should
learn of this outrage, Kabo would be
severely punished; he will not dare
defy me.”

  "I can not express, Delam Oblene,
how glad I am to see you!” faltered
ICiser. "For days and days you have
been the only ray of hope that I have
dared hold on to. But beware! do not
put yourself in Kabo’s power; he is
the vilest demon in the universe! He
will stop at nothing, and it is unsafe
to threaten him. He does not know
that you are aware of his perfidy;
would it not be safer to go at once to
the council with the news of his crime
than to risk an argument with him?
Heaven knows what he might do to
you if you antagonize him.”

  “Oh, no, that would not be fair. We
must give him a chance. He will not
harm me ; such things are not done
upon Mars. He would not have dared
to injure you had he known that there
were others in your party. Just now
they are making exhaustive search
for you and Kabo is greatly worried.
He told me that Crobe injured you
very severely in the garden and that
he feared your reason might be per-
manently impaired when you recov-
ered, but enjoined me to say nothing 1
about your having been here lest we

be blamed for allowing harm to come
to you. I do not know what .dispo-
sition he intends to make of your
body, but I rather fear he intends to
kill Nebond so that your body may be
found and accounted for as soon as
the scars of the operation have disap-
peared under his treatment. That is.
in his judgment, necessary, since I
chanced to see you, which was con-
trary to his plans. To kill Nebond,
you see, would not be murder, for’Ne-
bond is only a marb. Had I not acci-
dentally come upon the two of you in
the garden archway and had there
not been others from Earth to tell of
your disappearance, Kabo could have
kept both bodies and observed the re-
sults of Ms art to Ms heart ?s content.”
“But my friends — what of them?
Are they safe? Are they not in
Kabo’s power?”

  “They are quite safe. They are the
guests of Frambrozo Himnun, whose
father in his Earth life was none
other than your own Benjamin
Franklin. ’ ’

  "Thank heaven for that! I have
been in an agony of suspense for
them. But what do you mean by his
Earth life? Have others come from
Earth to Mars?”

  "In spirit only. Your party is the
only exception. Do you not remem-
ber what was told, you regarding the
reincarnation upon Masovada?” ’ '
"Yes indeed! I remember clearly
now, but my marb brain functions
but slowly.”

  "I must not tarry longer. I shall
go at once to Kabo and demand that
you be released from your horrible
predicament.”

  "Whatever else you may do, Delam
Oblene, be careful. Why not go away
and broadcast your challenge to him
from a distance? Is there not some
way in which you may insure your-
self against harm?”

  "I do not fear my uncle. I shall
go to him in person with my ultima-
tum. There is naught to fear.” • s
EARTHWORMS OF KARMA

Less than ah hour after Delam Ob-
lene had taken her leave Kabo en-
tered Kiser’s room. Under his arm
was that same instrument he had used
so effectually upon that memorable
night in the garden and upon his lips
was a smile that might have meant
menace or chagrin.

  “It is unfortunate,” he said, “that
in our stroll about my garden on the
evening of your arrival we chanced to
meet my niece and still more unfor-
tunate that she chanced to overhear
the discussion of our plans.”

  Kiser attempted to smile, but as the
mouth of a marb is not made to ac-
commodate the effort to smile, it is to
be feared that the thing he really did
was to grimace horribly.

  “I can not understand,” he said,
“how you are able to construe that as
a misfortune. Delam Oblene has de-
manded my release at your hands and
you dare not refuse that demand for
obvious reasons.”

  “Remarkable reasoning that! And
with the brain of a marb too! Well it
is most unfortunate from her stand-
point. She shall be punished for her
insubordination and my experiment
shall proceed as I have planned it. I
shall not desist until I shall have
mated you with a female marb and
made the necessary observations re-
garding the mentality of the off-
spring. ’ ’

  “Then your experiment will fail!”
roared Kiser in a rage. “Whatever
you may do to my body, my soul is
that of a man and a gentleman; I
will remain as I am forever rather
than consort with beasts!”

  He strained again at the thongs
whieh bound him to the bed. If only
one of them would yield he could
quickly free himself and then he would
avenge himself upon this demon in a
very gratifying manner. He felt his
face go hot and he knew that it had
attained that fiery red which he had
twice seen in a marb running amuck.
He continued to struggle until his

reason began to return, when he gave
up the effort and lay quite still.

  Kabo smiled approvingly. “Won-
derful self-control for a marb! You
can run amuck and recover your rea-
son rather more quickly than the aver-
age marb. Now I must move you; I
shall give you only enough of the Ray
to benumb your senses, for you must
walk and do my bidding; it would be
far too difficult to move you other-
wise, for now I must work alone.”

  There was a slight buzzing sound
as the tiny motor of the Strotan Ray
machine was started, and Kiser expe-
rienced the same sensation as that
which had overcome-him in Kabo’s
garden. There was a whirring and
buzzing in his ears and he seemed to
be traveling through space, until at
length he found himself standing up-
right, clinging for support to an ill-
kept suspended bed in an almost bar-
ren room with one barred window
and a stone floor.

  Beyond the window and well out of
his reach stood Kabo, and upon the
wall just a few inches from the open-
ing—the window had no glass—was a
large mirror. One glance at the re-
flection of himself in this mirror and
Kiser uttered a cry of horror. For
weeks he had known he had the phys-
ical body of a marb, but when he saw
his reflection in the mirror the horror
of the situation struck him with such
force that he was terrified by the
gravity of his fearful predicament.
He stared impotently at his reflection
and then, with a scream of anguish,
flung himself against the bars in an
effort to reach his malefactor. These
bars were very strong, however, and
he only received several cuts and
bruises for his trouble.

  Recoiling from the rebound impe-
tus given him by his contact with the
barred window, he staggered back a
few paces, but recovered his equilib-
rium and advanced upon his enemy
again, when he chanced to see upon one
of the panels a long wriggling ver-
min which he had injured; it looked
WEIRD TALES

•y>r all the world like an earthworm
l td. having a natural loathing for
fweh things" Kiser stopped short, de-
sisting in his efforts to reach his
tiemv rather than touch it again.

 Cabo laughed. "Oh, you need not
^mdder at such creatures as that! It
i the lowest form of animal life we
lave upon Masovada, but, at that, he
ioesn’t have as far to go to reach
j'jur stage in evolution as you must

+> far behind you as you might fancy,
kit if your friend Nebond should
-eianee to see him he would eat him
*ith great relish!”

10.	Nebond

For some weeks Nebond had been
allowed the freedom of a small,
* ell-constructed enclosure in the een-
■iral and isolated portion of Kabo’s
tstate. No one except the scientist
limself ever went near this part of
the grounds, as the privacy he had
ilways maintained was respected by
ill and there was little likelihood that
•ius part of the estate would be tres-
passed upon.

 Nebond did not know what had
teen done to him—he had been hor-
ribly mistreated: his beautiful and
wapely body had been transformed
iito this grotesque, white, naked, slen-
ier one. Perhaps he had been very
Kck during the time which he so
Tuguely remembered, during which
La ho had ministered to him; for his
Matures were fearfully distorted and
Its eyes drawn back into his forehead
md fixed there! When he viewed
limself in the water basin which Kabo
i .d provided for him inside the hovel

  here lie slept he would fly into a
itge and pound himself violently
tJ»on the chest with growling lamen-
tations.

 Gradually, however, he became
**mewhat reconciled to this objection-
tble state of affairs, but his enforced
*<iitude was making him very ill-
ifeaapered. He was becoming a cross.

lazy, slothful marb—a marb with the
physical body of an Earth-being, but
a marb nevertheless.

  One day, quite by accident, Nebond
discovered that he possessed far
greater physical strength than he had
formerly had. Inside the enclosure
where he was imprisoned grew a small
tree, perhaps three inches in diameter
at the ground and about three feet
tall, and this he chanced to grapple
with while at the height of one of his
frenzied outbursts; and to his sur-
prize and delight it came up by the
roots!

  The muscles of Joseph Kiser, devel-
oped upon Earth where much more
physical strength is necessary than
upon Mars, had potentialities little
dreamed of by their erstwhile owner,
and having received this hint of his
unsuspected prowess, he next tackled
the hydrant, which likewise yielded
to his efforts and came away from its
anchorage, with resultant inundation.

  With his scant clothing thoroughly
wet and his efforts to stop the flow of
water unsuccessful, Nebonds mild
frenzy became a raging amuck and in
utter abandon he flung himself
against the wall of his enclosure,
crushing it as though it were an egg-
shell, and the infuriated marb
stepped out—free!

  Thus encouraged, he proceeded to
vent his wrath upon everything with-
in his reach. The walls about the
grounds he laid low, uprooting other
small trees and shrubbery, destroying
the stalls or enclosures for protection
of many of the other animals, and
striking boldly out at length across
the suburban district of Sendos, de-
stroying everything which would
yield to his strength, until he came to
the canal. There his frenzy of rage
passed off quite as suddenly as it had
appeared, and here he was discovered
by Himnuu, Ruth and Professor
Hervy.

  Vaguely and without a great deal
of interest Nebond wondered who
these creatures were and why they
EARTHWORMS OF KARMA

24T

had approached him. Perhaps they
were representatives of the Council
coming to reckon with him for his
recent dreadful amuck ? Should he sub-
mit to the authorities as he had always
done heretofore ? No; there was a spark
of something in him now that bade him
defy the authorities. Now that his
amuck was ended he would not harm
them unless they attempted to harm
him, but if they did that—well, they
would have to take the consequences!

  The three creatures had drawn
nearer now and were conversing in
some strange dialect. They seemed to
be addressing him—but no, perhaps
not, for he could not understand
them. He noted casually that two of
them were horrid hollow-eyed beings
like himself; and yes—he was quite
certain now that they were address-
ing him, but what eould they be say-
ing?

  He condescended now to give them
some of his coveted attention. He
saw or sensed that the smaller of the
three was a girl. Ah! Kabo had
promised him a mate; perhaps this
was the one. He would have much
preferred one such as he had had in
the forest before'his capture, but this
one had features like his own as re-
flected in the drinking-bowl inside his
hovel, and perhaps Kabo had cap-
tured her for him. At any rate there
was no other to be had and this one
would do.

  Nebond was convinced of the truth
of his surmise when the girl ap-
proached him without fear and began
stroking his hand caressingly, al-
though he could understand no word
of what she was saying; perhaps
she was even now begging to be al-
lowed to accompany him back to his
hovel!

  Ruth was somewhat frightened
when this mad creature snatched her ;
up in his arms and ran away from the ,
spot, but even yet she could not bring |
herself to believe that Joseph Kiser j
would harm her. For several years
she had known and trusted him; she

; recalled his gentleness, his gallantry,
his great love for her, and, although
she realized that he was now quite
mad, she could not associate him with
any degree of villainy despite the
evidence to the contrary. She talked
to him, pleaded with him, begged
him to answer and say that he
had not forgotten her—little realiz-
ing that this, the physical body of her
lover, now housed the soul of a vile
and savage beast whose physical
brain, though in itself a human brain,
could no more respond to Kiser's love
for her than that of a dead person
can respond.

  The comparatively flight Martian
gravitation offered but little antagon-
ism to the creature's Earth-developed'
sinews, and soon they arrived at
Kabo's garden. Here Nebond stopped
short — his hovel and the enclosure
which enc-ireled it were demolished.
Nebond had forgotten that he had
destroyed these walls which had held
him prisoner, and now that he was
returning with a mate for himself
there was no place for him to take
her!

 He stood Ruth upon the ground
and stood for a moment viewing the
ruins all about him. What was he to
do? Should he attempt to rebuild
! the hovel ? Oh no! He would not do
! that! Should he dare to defy the
i authorities and return to the forest
i from which he had been taken? Yes,
perhaps he should, but just here his
i planning was interrupted by the
sight of food—and Nebond was hun-
gry.

  Ruth smiled bravely up at him.
“Joseph, deal’, why did you take me
from my friends? Why, oh why, do
j you not speak to me, Joseph?” Then
l she uttered a scream of horror and
fell in a dead faint, for even as she
spoke Nebond had reached far up-
ward, seized a long wriggling vermin
between his fingers and was eating it
before her eyes!

  Nebond surveyed the still form of
the girl without interest. When he
248

finished his scant repast, he picked
her up again none too gently and
bolted away toward the canal, in-
stinctively bound for the forest where
he had been captured some months
previously.

11.	Transported

For many days Joseph Kiser had
resided in one of the several
small hovels which stood in the cen-
tral isolated portion of Kabo’s estate,
his mind a maze of agonizing doubt
regarding the probable fate of Delam
Oblene, and his hope of deliverance
at her hands dwindling as day suc-
ceeded day and began to number
themselves as weeks and yet there
came no evidence of the success of her
intervention in his behalf.

  One morning he awoke with a feel-
ing of intense drowsiness beguiling
him to further slumber. A groan,
however, from somewhere near caused
him to open his eyes listlessly, expect-
ing to see the roof and four walls of
his hut but he was surprized into full
wakefulness, as a vision of clean blue
sky met his gaze. It was not the
murky, almost black Martian sky, and
his first thought was that all of those
harrowing Martian experiences had
been but dreams and that he was yet
upon the Earth, but one glance at
his own hairy, huge-chested body suf-
ficed to quell this suspicion; and then
came the groan again.

  He looked about him to discern the
source of this noise and was elated to
find himself lying upon the ground
amidst a rather dense growth of shrub-
bery which waved gently with the mo-
tion of the damp, heavy, rather oppres-
sive atmosphere.

  Attempting to spring to his feet he
was surprized to find that his limbs
were numb and sluggish and his body
seemed very heavy, as though a great
weight were tied about his waist.

  He arose with some difficulty. There
was that characteristic ringing in his
ears which revealed the fact that once

again the Strotan Ray had been em-
ployed to subdue his consciousness,
and the atmosphere seemed-almost as
though it would strangle or even
drown him; his head swam, the scen-
ery spun around, and he clutched for
support at a tall bush.

  When he had secured a firm hold
all his giddiness suddenly left him
and he emitted a cry of agony as there
shot through the hand with wrhich he
held the bush a paroxysm of pain! He
quickly released his hold and stag-
gered backward, then recovered his
equilibrium and stood for some mo-
ments silently regarding his aching
palm. The weed which he had clutched
appeared innocent enough, being some
four feet tall with a stalk about three
inches thick at the ground, where it
was pink but gradually blended into
the husky green color of the branches
and foliage, the latter being a five-
pronged leaf somewhat resembling
the human hand, and as it waved in
the gentle breeze it seemed to beckon
with mock hospitality.

  Again came the groan he had heard
before, and turning quickly, he be-
held the inert bulk of another huge
marb lying in the shrubbery behind
him and only about ten paces distant.

  Standing there aghast, his mind but
barely recovered from the effect of
the Strotan Ray with which he had
been anesthetized and transported to
this spot, he wras for the moment be-
wildered ; then he recalled Kabo’s
threat to mate him with a female
marb in order to observe the manner
of offspring such a pair would beget.
Undoubtedly this threat had been ex-
ecuted and now he was here—where-
soever that might be—in company
with a potential mate to abide upon
some unfrequented land and prop-
agate a race of beings which would
satisfy the Martian’s craving for
scientific observation!

  Kiser stood for some moments gaz-
ing in half stupefaction at the inert
animal, and as he stood she began to
arouse. She raised herself upon one
EARTHWORMS OF KARMA

243

elbow and looked dazedly about; at
sight of Kiser she uttered a growl of
fear and made an effort to get upon her
feet with the evident intention of re-
treat, but she lost her footing and
slumped helplessly to the ground
again.

  She lay there gasping and trem-
bling, her protruding eyes dilated
with fear, and Kiser thought that she
looked remarkably like the one he had
seen in Kabo’s garden; but that was
not strange, as he had seen but one
female marb—she might even be the
same and perhaps she feared him be-
cause he had slain her mate, if indeed
she had intelligence enough to know
so much.

  At any rate she was only a female
marb and he was not interested in any
further speculation regarding her; so
he turned about at once and walked
deliberately away.

  For some distance he went through
shrubbery such as that amongst which
he had awakened; then he came sud-
denly to the border of a dense forest,
the trees of which were very large
and grew somewhat higher than those
in the forest east of Keto. The fo-
liage, too, was not nearly so large,
although somewhat larger than any
he had seen upon the Earth.

  Kiser wondered what remote part
of Mars this could be, where the vege-
tation was so luxuriant and the at-
mosphere so much less rare, and
where as yet there had been no
evidence of a canal. The planetary
magnetism, too, seemed much greater
than at Keto, for even now Kiser was
quite exhausted and found it neces-
sary to stop and rest.

  There was a distinct line of demar-
cation between the forest and the area
of shrubbery, and Kiser wondered
vaguely why that should be so. There
was no evidence of there ever having
been a forest fire, and yet the forest
ended abruptly where the shrubbery
began.

 Although Kiser knew that this
could not be the forest near the city

of Keto, yet he felt elated at being
free, and should Kabo attempt to re-
turn and observe the result of his
experiment he ■would now be in posi-
tion to offer him a warm reception.

  Having rested, Kiser plunged on
into the forest, half expecting to come
at any moment upon one of the large
Martian canals. He had walked per-
haps a mile when again the forest
ended almost as abruptly as it had
done pon the other side, but it did
not end at the shore of a canal nor
yet another area of shrubbery, but
instead there stretched out before him
a vast expanse of barren sand-covered
surface which glittered almost as
white as snow in the sunlight.

  The heat hdd grown oppressive
he neared this barren area, and as he
was again much fatigued, he again sat
down to rest himself before ventur-
ing farther upon his tour of explo-
ration. He had not noticed the hecf
before and wondered that it should be
so much more intense here than in
the depth of the forest; yet the fae:
remained and he found his rest so un-
refreshing that he remained longer
than previously.

Just as he was upon the point of
arising he saw the huge marb
whom he had left behind approac-:;
the sand oeean at some distance from
him. She did not see him and he
deferred his advance, intending to
allow her to proceed without knowl-
edge of his presenee.

  She had evidently arrived before
him, for she showed no evidence of
fatigue as she advanced and strode
firmly out upon the sand-covered area
apparently quite as intent as himseli
upon exploration of the land upon
which Kabo had marooned them.

 For ten—perhaps twenty—paces
she advanced without mishap; then
she seemed to pause, but thinking bet-
ter of it again went forward. Just
two more steps she took, then stoppec.
dead-still for an instant, turned and
attempted to retrace her steps, but
250

WEIRD TALES

before she could even .so much as re-
gain her equilibrium she began to sink
in the loose sand about her feet! She
attempted to throw herself forward
upon her face, but the sand upon
which she stood seemed to sway like
the waves upon a ropy, viscid fluid
with encrusted top. She made re-
peated attempts to withdraw her feet
from the sand but could not do so.

  Seeing that she was sinking deeper
and deeper and was quite unable to
escape, Kiser hastened toward her,
but before he had reached the spot
another creature appeared from the
depths of the forest and, tossing a
long rope, dexterously lassoed the
sinking marb and was pulling with all
his strength in an effort to rescue her
when Kiser reached his side.

  Kiser caught up the end of the rope
and assisted in the towing in, the task
being one which taxed the strength of
both.

  The creature which had come to the
rescue of the marb was about six feet
tall, walked upright like a human be-
ing and his physical build was indeed
much more human-like than that of
either of the others. His legs and
arms were long and muscular and
clothed with the well-tanned skin of
some animal; his skin was copper-
colored and quite bare, with chest and
body shaped quite like that of an
Earth-man, though the face and head
were covered with long l’ed hair which
hung down to his shoulders; he had
eyes that did not protrude, and a
large sneering mouth equipped with
strong yellow teeth. One glance suf-
ficed to convince one that he was of
some savage human species.

  So intent was he upon his duties of
rescue that he was not aware of
Kiser’s presence behind him and when
the huge marl) had been dragged to
the more solid sand nearer the edge
of the forest the creature drew a long
knife from his belt and with a savage
growl sprang toward her.

  The marb evaded her rescuer with
surprizing agility, but lie braced him-

self for another w$h, when Kiser
caught his upraised hand frojn. behind
and snatched the knife from his fin-
gers.

  Taken completely by surprize, the
savage creature turned to face this
new enemy, but the sight of Kiser
brandishing the knife and the other
marb approaching him from the side,
both much larger than and quite
as fierce-looking as himself, discour-
aged his making a renewed attack, al-
though had he but known it he might
easily have vanquished both; and he
slunk away into the forest, leaving
both knife and rope in the possession
of his enemies.

  When the beast had gone the marb
backed away from Kiser in evident,
fear and distrust.

  "You need not fear me,” he said,
forgetful that she could not under-
stand his English; "I shall not harm
you in the least.”

  When he had spoken, the marb
stopped and gasped in astonishment.

  "Joseph Kiser!” she said, as if
pronouncing the words with much
difficulty.

  Now it was Kiser’s turn to be
astonished. He remembered sudden-
ly that marbs can not speak any of the
Earth languages—how did it happen
that this one knew his name?

  "Yes, I am Joseph Kiser, but how
do you happen to know my name?
Can you speak English?”

  The marb answered him in the
Martian tongue, of which he could
understand no word. He shook his
head and tried to grin, but he must
have bared his teeth instead, for the
creature stepped back in evident
fright.

  She soon recovered herself, how-
ever, and seemed to be pondering; she
essayed to speak several times as if
groping for words, speaking each time
in the Martian language, although she
appeared to be trying to recall
another.

  After several such attempts at
speech this creature bent upon Kiser
EARTHWORMS OF KARMA

251

a gaze more appealing than savage
and sjaid: “Delam Oblene.”

  “What is that?” he asked, his in-
terest quickening. “Do you have a
message for me from Delam Oblene?”

  But again the marb was stumped.
She appeared to be able to say only
those two things which Kiser could
understand—pronounce his own name
and that of Delam Oblene.

  Of a sudden Kiser understood. This
was indeed Juak and she was trying
to denounce him for having killed her
mate. Perhaps her mention of Delam
Oblene was to impart that that young
lady had informed her regarding the
manner of Crobe’s death.

Ceeing that conversation with this
creature was impossible, Kiser
turned and strode back into the for-
est. And when he again became ex-
hausted and stopped, he noted that
the air was quite cold. He had noted
ofttimes before the very marked
difference in temperature between
the Martian day and night, but here
was a vast difference brought about
by only a few moments’ walk! Oh
well, it was useless to wonder where
Kabo had marooned him, for even if
he knew, yet he would be none the
wiser, since he knew nothing of any
part of Mars save Keto—and very
little of that. This marked change
in temperature, however, puzzled him
considerably; how was such a change
possible ? And why had the innocent-
appearing sand proved to be a
treacherous mire?

  At length his sluggish marb brain
reached the correct solution: the
sand-covered area was a great lava
lake which had cooled somewhat upon
the surface and near the margin of
the forest, the heat underneath caus-
ing the surface to crumble into a
sand-like powder, while underneath
the surface and farther out there was
only molten liquid lava or some
similar substance. This would ac-
count for the phenomenon he had

witnessed and also for the intense
heat at the forest’s edge.

  The sun had sunk quite low and
Kiser began to look about him for
some place to spend the night. He
found nothing which might suffice for
a shelter, and the cold was becoming
more and more noticeable; so, after
perhaps a half-hour of futile seareh,
he retraced his steps to the margin of
the lava lake.

  Upon several occasions he had sur-
prized a number of small animals as
they fed, which gave him a very valu-
able clue as to the edible fruits, and,
being hungry, he ate freely of a cer-
tain variety resembling the apple.

  It was quite palatable, and when he
had eaten his fill he felt as much re-
freshed as though he had had beef-
steak or eggs.

  Darkness came with a startling
suddenness—or, more coiTectly, the
sun disappeared quickly and without
twilight—for even after the sun had
set there was a most brilliant moon-
light.

  Looking upward to discover th©
source of this light, Kiser gasped in
astonishment, for directly overhead
there was an enormous satellite. It
was large—much too large to be
Phobus; in fact, it seemed many hun-
dreds of times larger than Phobus
had appeared upon that memorable
night in Kabo’s garden!

  So! He had been transported to
some other planet ? Indeed, Kabo had
taken no chances whatsoever upon his
victim’s escaping! Well, since this
was most certainly not Mars, what
planet was it? Could he be upon
Venus? No, for Venus had no such
satellite, and, too, he had been led to
believe that Venus was shrouded in
clouds. The day had been so short
that he was sure this was a very small
planet; yet what planet it might be
he could not guess.

  This was the most severe blow of
all. Upon Mars he might always have
some hope for his ultimate deliver-
ance from the horrible curse which
252

WEIRD TALES

had been placed upon him, but since
Kabo had taken the precaution to
maroon him upon some other planet
the situation was hopeless indeed.

  He had chosen a spot comfortably
near the lava lake, where he lay down
and tried to sleep, but his mind was
so filled with despair that for more
than an hour sleep did not come; so
he lay staring upward in almost un-
thinking agony, the enormous satel-
lite hanging mockingly directly above
him as if for no other purpose than
to remind him of his misery and
despair. And directly overhead it re-
mained. The sun had moved rapidly
across the horizon and yet this satel-
lite continued to hang directly over-
head.

  At length the center of the immense
satellite appeared to have opened and
a broad stairway descended to within
a few feet of his outstretched hands
but yet quite beyond his reach. He
sprang for it with a mighty effort,
clutched the lower rung with the tips
of his fingers, swayed for a moment,
making herculean efforts to hold fast,
and then fell.

  Kiser awoke with a start to find the
sun peeping from the horizon where it
had just risen. He glanced quickly up-
ward and—yes, there was still the
huge satellite op planet in exactly the
same position as when he had first
seen it!

  Since this planet had not changed
its position and remained always
directly overhead, then it was clear
that the sphere upon which he stood
did not rotate upon an axis, but in-
stead it revolved about that other,
larger planet with always the same
surface toward the planet about
which it revolved.

  Thus it was that Kiser reasoned he
had been marooned upon a satellite of
some one of the primary planets;
and, since the period of sunshine had
been but a few hours, he knewr that
he must be upon Phobus, the larger
and rapid-moving satellite of Mars.

 How Kabo had contrived to get

him upon Phobus he did not know.
Perhaps he had stolen the Amogant;
he might easily have done so in case
the craft had been left unguarded.
At any rate Kiser was here and now
he must find food and some manner
of abode to protect him from the
chill of the heavy, damp atmosphere
and from the ferocious beasts which
peopled the planet.

  He still had the long sharp knife
which he had taken from the "Rescue-
man, ’ ’ as he had named the creature
whom he encountered at the lava
lake, but the animal’s rope he had
left with the marb; he hoped she had
had intelligence enough to make use
of it.

  With this knife he began hewing
down such of the smaller forest trees
as would best suit his purpose and
fashioned them into a rude cabin,
stopping the cracks with mud from a
small forest stream near by.

  To complete this shelter required
many of the short days and some of
the nights. During this time he had
seen nothing further of the marb nor
of the Rescue-man. He subsisted
upon the forest fruits and such of the
small animals as he was able to catch,
the stream near his cabin furnished
an ample quantity of icy cold water,
and withal he was near enough to the
lava lake to make artificial heat un-
necessary.

IT- iser finished the roof of his cabin
none too soon, for no sooner had
he added the last bit of mud and
thatch than there began a slow cold
precipitation of mist which was to
continue for many days. His rude
roof held quite well, however, and in-
side his one-room cabin it was quite
cozy, although the rain had prevent-
ed his attempting to make even so
much as a bed or a chair in the way
of household furniture.

  Being kept thus indoors was very
irksome, for he had nothing to read,
and he wondered if he could read if
he did have; the marb’s brain not
EARTHWORMS OF KARMA

253

being equipped with a center con-
trolling the ability to recognize
printed characters. He could only lie
upon the leaf-covered floor and long
for the coming of the sunshine.

  For three of the short days and as
many nights he had been kept inside
by the rain. He was lying half asleep
upon the floor of his cabin when sud-
denly there came a knock at his door.
Surprized into full wakefulness he
sprang to his feet, drew his knife as
a precautionary measure, and cai’e-
fully opened the door. Juak, the
female marb, was standing upon his
doorstep!

  Angered at this brazen effrontery,
Baser was upon the verge of slam-
ming the door shut in her face, but
she was gesticulating frantically and
speaking with a great deal of em-
phasis in an effort to impart some
seemingly important information,
and although he could not understand
her words, he could at least attempt
an investigation of that part of the
forest she was indicating in an effort
to learn what it was which distressed
her; so he stepped out and closed the
door behind him.

  Kiser having signaled his readiness
to follow, the marb set out in the
direction she had indicated as hold-
ing something of rare interest, using
the greatest caution to avoid detec-
tion by some unseen foe by moving
with the greatest stealth—peering
from behind trees and moving from
one tree to another with great cau-
tion.

  Seeing that she had had the pres-
ence of mind to acquire the Reseue-
man’s rope, which she slung across
her shoulder, Kiser respected her
attitude of vigilance and did likewise.
From tree to tree and from bush to
bush they advanced, never more than
a few steps apart, until presently the
marb halted, assumed an attitude of
listening, and put a hand upon
Kiser’s arm, beckoning him to ex-
treme caution.

 For just a moment they waited

thus; then Kiser saw one of the Res-
cue-men emerge from behind a tree
trunk and advance to another point
of vantage. Soon he saw another and
still another; and they were moving
stealthily toward his cabin, each
carrying an armful of large yellow
fruit resembling the tomato!

  There were four of them and they
were slinking upon his domain pre-
sumably to poison him! Kiser’s first
thought was to let them try in vain,
but he feared that they might destroy
his cabin, which was none too strong-
ly built; so he impulsively stepped
out from his hiding-place and con-
fronted them with drawn knife.

  Taken completely by surprize, the
four creatures turned in their tracks
as one and beat an inglorious retreat,
leaving four small heaps of the toma-
to-like fruit lying upon the ground.
Kiser stooped and picked up one of
these and examined it critically.
There was certainly nothing wrong
with its appearance and it looked as
though it might taste delicious. Per-
haps, after all, the Rescue-men were
trying to be friendly and had only in-
tended to secure his good-will by an
offering of rare food.

  The marb, however, appeared to
think otherwise; for when she saw
him handling this fruit she uttered a
hoarse screech and motioned for him
to drop it.

  He could see no reason for haste in
disposing of the fruit, but when she
continued to protest he drew back his
long arm and dashed it against a
near-by tree.

  When he had done this, the marb
uttered a cry of alarm and fled, beck-
oning him to follow. Thinking her
fears quite probably due to super-
stition, however, he did not hasten
away, and when he had stood his
ground but a moment his eyes closed
with a severe paroxysm of pain, while
his nose and throat began burning as
though a red-hot iron had been,
thrust into his nostrils.

  He staggered, coughing and gasp-
254

WEIRD TALES

ing, away'from the spot, at a loss to
account for the extreme pain in his
eyes, throat, and lungs. He tried to
open his eyes in order to see some
avenue of escape, but they were tight-
ly closed by muscle spasm and it was
impossible to see at all. However, he
soon felt the guiding hand of the
marb upon his arm and he walked
beside her in an agony of pain, which
was not so great but that he pondered
upon the magnanimity of this beast
who was thus aiding the slayer of her
mate—or was it brazen grossness
prompting her to actually court the
marb who had vanquished her hus-
band?

  She guided him to the door of his
cabin and assisted him inside, but
when, after some moments, he suc-
ceeded in opening his eyes she was
gone.

  She had not been courting his at-
tention then, after all? What man-
ner of marb was this which would go
to such length to rescue a stranger—
an enemy—and then quietly slink
away when the danger no longer
threatened? The idea which Kabo
and Delam Oblene had given him re-
garding these animals, as well as his
own experience with two of them,
was indicative of their viciousness
and vileness of temper rather than of
any gentleness or amiability. He
could not understand any such action
upon the part of the mate of the
slain Crobe, unless-

  Heavens! Could it be possible that
Kabo had been so vile as to perlorm
his horrid operation upon someone
else—and had he sent some Martian
girl here to mate with Kiser after
having transplanted her soul into the
body of Juak, the marb?

  But no; if she were a Martian she
could probably speak some Earth
language, since all Martians had lived
on Earth in a previous incarnation
and could remember the incidents of
their Earth life. Yet there was the
case of his nurse who could speak
neither English, French, nor German.

  And yet, reflected Kiser, the Mar-
tians remembered their previous in-
carnations by virtue of a certain
brain center which served as a special
medium of contact between the ego
and the conscious mind, enabling
them to recall their pre-natal experi-
ences, and if a Martian were given
the physical brain of a marb which
has no such center, then most certain-
ly such a person could not recall his
terrestrial experiences nor could he
speak any other language than Mar-
tian.

  Again, this creature had known and
spoken his name as well as that of—
of-

 “By God!” Kiser sprang to his
feet in great agitation. “That is
Delam Oblene!”

12.	Abandoned

Ruth hervy regained consciousness
with a start. She gasped with
amazement and shock as she was sud-
denly immersed in icy cold water!

  She opened her eyes to find that
her abductor had plunged boldly into
the canal and was swimming toward
the opposite shore with her upon his
shoulder. And her remonstration
made not the slightest impression
upon him. She begged, pleaded,
scolded and threatened, but he con-
tinued on his way with apparent un-
concern until they reached the bank,
where he placed her upon her feet
while he shook himself and squeezed
some of the water from his clothing,
then lightly swung her across his
shoulder again and entered the forest.

  By this time Ruth was trembling
from fright as well as cold. She
struggled to free herself from this
madman by swinging her feet down-
ward, disturbing the equilibrium
with which he had balanced her. He
overcame this movement with a slight
effort and held her more firmly. She
continued her struggles with renewed
energy and at length succeeded in
freeing one of her arms from his em-
brace : then with a frenzy of fear and
EARTHWORMS OF KARMA

255

anger she slapped his face with all
her strength.

  Angered at this evidence of insub-
ordination, Nebond quickly stood the
girl upon her feet and faced her with
bared teeth and an animal-like growl,
and then as she recoiled from him in
horror and dismay, he seized her by
the throat and shook her until she
again lost consciousness!

  When again she opened her eyes it
was at the sound of voices. Strange
voices they were and in the Martian
tongue. That language being strictly
phonetic and very simple and easy to
speak, she had learned to understand
it quite well, although she spoke it
very poorly.

  Nebond placed her upon her feet
again, but she was too weak to stand.
She staggered weakly and fell to a
sitting posture, staring with renewed
horror at the sight before her.

  More than a dozen ferocious-look-
iiig marbs stood surveying the pair
with their pointed ears extended for-
ward and their eyes telescoping back
and forth in an attitude of hostile
inquiry.

 “You should remember me!”
roared her abductor. "I am Nebond.
I lived among you for years! One
day Kabo had me captured and car-
ried away; now I have come back. I
have came back to stay. I do not fear
Kabo! Do you hear me? Harken:
Nebond does not fear Kabo! Let
Kabo come and try again to capture
me and I shall rend him limb from
limb! Nebond is very strong, stronger
than the strongest among you; even
stronger than you, Pleck, and I have
come back to the forest to rule as
your king! If Pleck resists my ascen-
sion to supremacy Nebond will kill
Pleck. Pleck must now abdicate, for
Nebond is going to be your king!”

  There was a hoarse growl from the
largest among the marbs and he
stepped forward fearlessly. "You
are both a liar and a fool!” he
screeched. "You are not Nebond and
you are not stronger than I; neither

are you going to cause me to abdicnte
in your favor! You are some stranga
creature of absurd appearance whom
we never saw before; you are not onai
of us! Go away or I shall kill yon
even as I have killed Klegg and Beoa
and Huff and I\ibe and Jamon and
Ruel and Himbo and Jutt and Herb
and Parlo! Go away before I run
amuck!”

  "Yes, many of these I remember,”
replied Nebond; "some you may have
killed since my departure. And you
have failed to mention Lamo. Lame
was my father and though I hated
him and was glad when you killed
him, it placed a stigma upon my fam-
ily name which I am going to wipe
out this day by killing you. I shall
not only kill you but all your mates
and your children as well!”

  "Beware! Pleck is about to run
amuck; and when Pleck runs amuc-k
Pleck never maims nor cripples—
Pleck always kills!”

 "Nebond does not fear your
amuck! This day Pleck shall die!”

  Ruth was astonished at hearing the
creature who she thought was Joseph
Kiser speaking in the Martian tongue,
without hesitancy or brogue, just as
though he had never spoken any
other language. At first she had sur-
mised that Kiser must have lived
among these marbs and learned the
language from them, but now it
seemed that he was both unknown
and unwelcome here. His reference
to Kabo escaped her quite because
the name sounded so much like those
of the marbs mentioned that she sur-
mised the reference was applied to a
marb, and no thought of the scientist
entered her mind.

  Pleck was beginning to foam at the
mouth. “I shall now show you who
is going to be king of the marbs!”
he roared and bounded forward, his
huge form a great mass of fury and
hatred.

  Nebond nimbly side-stepped this
attack and sprang forward in an at-
tempt to obtain a hold upon the
256

WEIRD TALES

other's throat. He missed, however,
aud as his shoulder came in contact
with the body of the huge marb the
beast closed his strong teeth upon his
shoulder, having missed his throat by
the narrowest margin.

  Again and again Nebond tried to
obtain a hold upon his antagonist’s
throat and as many times he was
foiled in the attempt. He evaded the
brute’s efforts to sever his jugular
vein by his superior strength alone,
and he was fast becoming exhausted
by his strenuous efforts in this at-
mosphere which did not contain
enough oxygen to supply his needs
on account of his very limited lung
capacity, while his antagonist seemed
as fresh and sturdy as at their first
moment of encounter.

  Nebond was beginning to realize
that his present physique was not
built for fighting as the marbs fight;
his mouth was too small and his neck
too short to use his teeth to ad-
vantage, and too, the other marb had
an added advantage in his greater
reach and ability as well as his huge
chest and consequent greater lung
capacity.

  Nebond's head began to grow dizzy
—not from any injury Pleck had
been able to inflict but from lack of
oxygen. His breath came in quick
frothy gasps and his knees sagged.
At length Pleck secured a hold upon
his throat and the scenery spun
round, his vision blurred, his lungs
ached and had Pleck released his hold
just then Nebond would have begged
for mercy; but Pleck did not desist:
his hold tightened and all went black
for Nebond.

  Ruth watched this battle spell-
bound. Why did Kiser not use his
fists? Why did he not grasp the ani-
mal’s arm as he had done upon that
previous occasion and wrench it joint
from joint with his superior strength?
She saw him fight a losing fight
because he was attempting to use the
same fighting tactics as the marb and
was unable to do so. She saw that his

wind was going fast and at length she
saw him limp and xhert. in the grasp
of the murderous brute.

  With this sight something seemed
to snap in her mind and with tha
heritage of several generations of
fighting Hervys predominating she
sprang to her feet and assailed the
huge beast with her fists, striking
blows straight from the shoulders as
her father had taught her; for he had
often admonished her that "every
woman should be able to defend her-
self in case it might become neces-
sary to do so.”

  That Pleck thought but little of the
prowess of this new adversary was
evident. He did not release his hold
upon Nebond’s throat but he was pre-
vented from ripping open his jugu-
lar, as he attempted to ward off
Ruth’s blows.

  Recalling the fight Kiser had had
with the marb on the day of their
landing, she suddenly caught the
huge beast’s arm in both hands and
twisted with all her strength. With
a howl of pain Pleck released Nebond
and turned with renewed energy
upon the girl.

  Pleck was astounded and his rage
was redoubled, but regardless of how
fiercely he fought, those blows which
she drove against his comparatively
fragile facial structures inflicted such
punishment as he had never endured
before, and time after time he was
forced to desist in his efforts to reach
her throat. And, too, the arm which
she had twisted was all but useless
and consequently he fought under an
added disadvantage.

XTebond was beginning to regain
-*• ’ consciousness npw, and as he rose
to his feet a shower of derisive sar-
casm was cast at him from the other
marbs congregated about but who
had offered no interference with the
combatants.

  "See! See!” they shouted. "The
strong man is beginning to revive!
The very strong man who would be
EARTHWORMS OF KARMA

257

king of,the marbs! The strong man
who lets his mate do his fighting!
The strong man who is not half so
strong as his she!”

  Nebond stood gasping, glaring first
at the taunting throng and then at
the combat between Ruth and Pleck.
If he was astonished at seeing the
weak creature whom he had so easily
fetched into the forest thus besting
the mighty king of the marbs he did
not comment upon his surprize.

  Ruth’s composure was going fast.
She was gasping for breath now and
her vision was beginning to blur. She
made another attempt to twist her
adversary’s arm and failed.

  All things considered, Pleck prob-
ably desired least to have his arm
wrenched as she had wrenched the
other one; he stepped back, waving
her to truce.

  “I dislike to fight with females,”
he said. “Your man has recovered
himself, I see, and I prefer to combat
with him. You stand aside and see to
it that you do not interfere again! If
you do I shall have the entire tribe
upon you; if you do not they will not
interfere.”

  Nebond had recovered his wind to
an extent and now he rushed upon
Pleck, and using the tactics he had
seen Ruth use, he grabbed the long
slender neck of the marb between his
two hands and pushed with all his
strength in opposite directions. The
animal’s vertebra snapped and he fell
to the ground dead almost instantly.
Nebond had learned to use his great
strength effectively!

  He then turned upon the others
and with great gusto proceeded to
run amuck. The three marbs nearest
him were struck down with his
mighty fists, another was maimed for
life by having his arm twisted until it
was broken and badly crushed, and
Nebond with the Earth-developed
muscles of Joseph Kiser stood among
the other marbs loudly proclaiming
himself their king and demanding

 that Pleck’s mates and offspring be
 pointed out to him.

   This was very readily done, for the
 marbs had felt his prowess and they
 had no wish to antagonize him. The
 three wives and four young which
 comprised Pleck’s family were ruth-
 lessly murdered while Ruth looked on
 in horror, protesting as best she could,
 speaking brokenly in the Martian
 tongue, pleading with Nebond to stop
 his wholesale and useless carnage.
 But Nebond paid not the slightest at-
 tention to her pleas. He kept on until
 he had finished his gruesome task and
 then his amuck left him quite sudden-
 ly and he was calm. But eight marbs
 had died at his hands and as many
 others were injured.

   “Now I want Pike. Go and fetch
 Pike to me!” commanded Nebond to
 one of the marbs who stood trembling
 near by. This animal hastened to do
 his bidding and soon returned accom-
 panied by another marb, a female
 and somewhat smaller than himself.

  “Pike,” said Nebond, “I have
 come back to you. I am Nebond re-
 turned from captivity to be the king
 "of the marbs; I have just killed Pleck
 and all his shes and all his offspring;
 I am the king now and you shall be
 my favorite queen.”

   “You are not Nebond!” retorted
 the female marb. “You are not even
 a marb; you are that terrible creature
 who came from the sky in an iron
 craft and who so cruelly attacked
 Beck many small moons ago. You are
 a devil and the marbs do not want
 you for their king. Go away with the
 she you have with you and let the
 marbs alone!”

   “Do not dare to say to me that I
 am not Nebond! If you say that
 again I shall kill you! I am Nebond
 and you are Pike, my mate, even as
 you were my mate before I was cap-
 tured by the Masovadans. Come to
 me!” He held out his hand toward
 her, and not daring to refuse, she
 came and stood in his embrace.

  “But Nebond was a marb,” she
258

WEIRD TALES

protested. "Nebond would not dare
return from captivity to the forest
even if he might; therefore shortly
after Nebond was captured I mated
with Beck. I love Beck and I do not
wish to leave him, not even if the real
Nebond should return. ’ ’

  "I tell you I am Nebond and I told
you not to say I am not! ’ ’ He caught
the poor creature by the neck and
twisted until she screeched with pain,
to the delight of the onlookers, save
for Ruth, who watched with a feeling
of horror and disgust; but, even yet,
she could not associate any such
action with the Joseph Kiser she had
known, and she felt that this experi-
ence must be a horrid and unreal

nightmare—sureljS she would awake
presently, for it deemed that she could
not endure it much longer.

 "Yes, Nebond,” Pike was saying,
"I will be your queen if you say I
must. I dare not run amuck for I
know you would kill me. I will be
your favorite queen, but what are
you going to do with your other she?
She is much more like you in appear-
ance—will she not be your favorite?”

  "I shall give her to Beck in ex-
change for you. You are much more
beautiful and I do not care to mate
with her. I shall forage upon the
domains of other tribes to obtain my
other mates, but always you shall be
my favorite queen. ’ ’

 The weird climax of this story provides a fascinating feast of reading
 for the concluding chapter's in next month's WEIRD 'TALES.

DREAM STRIFE

  By BILLY CROSBY

               Still-born upon the dewy morning air,

                A vision stretched before me: fairyland
                It seemed to be, for lakes and trees and sand
                Were not of earthly hue; so strangely fair
                The tufted towers girt with jewels rare.

               The curving spires whereon the gnome-guards stand
               To give swift warning for the fays to band
               And march in dread array; oh man, beware!

               The faint sun dimmed; forth from a black-capped cloud
               Twelve monsters sprang to keep their savage tryst:

                 Then rose the roar of conflict fierce and loud,

    Of elfin shouting and of beasts that hissed;

               The heavens blazoned forth a flaming shroud—

    And all dissolved into the morning mist.
THE Fates which preside over the
destinies of mankind must have
been sitting up and taking notice
during the five minutes that I stood hes-
itating at the junction of the two paths
which ran in divergent directions over the
heather-clad Scottish moor.

   I had been fairly late in setting out from
Gairloch, where I had spent the previous
night, but I thought I had allowed my-

self ample time in which to cover the fif-
teen or so miles which lay between that
little town and the coast village of Mel*
vaig where, so I had been informed, I
could obtain comfortable lodgings. But
the proposed itinerary of a solitary walk-
ing-tour, such as I was then enjoying, is
liable to be somewhat elastic. I had
dawdled away most of the day, stopping
now and again to admire the glorious

                                   259

“Take that knowledge to hell with you!”
260

WEIRD TALES

scenery of the Ross coast and to indulge
in a quiet smoke while lying on the fra-
grant heather, and when the twilight be-
gan to close in unusually early by reason
of the dark and threatening clouds over-
head, I discovered that I was still a good
many miles from my destination.

  Such was the situation when I halted
at the crossroads in the gathering dusk,
undecided which to pursue. The path to
my left ran along the coast, and by fol-
lowing it I would ultimately arrive at
Melvaig, but the one which slanted off at
an angle to my right seemed to lead direct
to a very cheerful cluster of lights about
a mile distant across the purple moor.

  It was, I concluded, a village of some
sort; a village would probably mean an
inn, and an inn would mean shelter of a
more or less comfortable description. I
felt sorely tempted to forego the assured
comforts of Melvaig in favor of the near-
er entertainment which the winking lights
to my right seemed to promise.

  A sudden spatter of heavy raindrops
on my face decided me. I turned away
from the sea and headed across the moor
at my best pace.

  I soon discovered, however, that the
lights were not so near as I had first sup-
posed them to be. Moreover, the path I
was following did not seem to lead di-
rectly to them; it twisted and turned in
different directions, until I lost all pa-
tience with its devious windings. By this
time the rain had settled into a steady
driving downpour, and wreaths of white
mist were beginning to settle among the
hollows of the moor. I knew that the
folk who lived thereabouts kept early
hours; any moment they might take it into
their heads to extinguish the lights and
go to bed, in which case I might spend the

rest of the night in wanderiflg about that
desolate stretch of moorland. '. Finally I
found that the path I was treading seemed
to be branching off at right angles to the
place I was now desperately anxious to
reach. It was this last straw that snapped
my already overtaxed patience.

   "Here goes!” I cried, as I left the guid-
ance of the path and struck across country
in the direction of the beckoning lights.

  After I had been walking ten minutes I
began to notice that the ground was get-
ting very soft underfoot. At first I did
not attach much importance to this, set-
ting it down to the heavy rain, but I soon
found myself ankle-deep.

  I backed away from this muddy patch
and walked a few dozen yards to the
right, in order to avoid it. The next min-
ute I was immersed to the knees in the
treacherous morass.

  Too late I understood the reason for
the zigzag windings of the road I had so
rashly quitted. I turned and waded
back through the clinging slime, only too
eager to regain the road. But it was very
difficult to judge my sense of direction
once I had lost sight of the distant lights.
I floundered on almost at random, at ev-
ery' step sinking deeper in the sucking
ooze. Yet I knew I must keep moving,
for the moment I attempted to stand still
I began to sink.

  On I struggled, blindly, desperately,
trusting to chance to lead me out of that
quivering death-trap. Then of a sudden
the ground seemed to open, engulfing me
waist-deep in the marsh.

  Then did the icy hand of despair clutch
my heart in real earnest. I knew not
which way to turn: yet it meant death to
stand still. But whichever way I turned
I seemed only to sink deeper in the mire.
THE HOUND OF DUNCARDIN

261

In vain I tried to gain a firmer foothold—
the yielding slime encompassed me on
every side.

  ''Help! Help!” I shouted at the top
of my voice.

  But the only answer was the sough of
the wind and the bubbling of the ooze
around me. Far away across the dismal
expanse the cheery lights that had lured
me to my doom seemed to mock me with
their unchanging stare.

  In my frenzy I cursed them—cursed
my own folly in leaving the path—the
clinging mud—the darkness. . . .

  "Help!” I shouted with the full force
of my panting lungs.

  The echoes of my voice died away. My
strength was exhausted; I could struggle
no more. It was the end. But even as
I steeled myself to meet the inevitable, I
heard a deep-throated baying near at
hand, and a moment later a huge, shaggy
form loomed dimly through the dark-
ness.

  Thus did I make my first acquaintance
with the Hound of Duncardin.

A great wave of returning hope surged
through my heart at the coming of
this four-footed friend in need. Where
such an animal could tread a man could
follow without being engulfed. I turned
and struggled in the direction of the dog,
and he, on his part, seemed to encourage
my efforts by a series of loud but friendly
barks. Soon I had the satisfaction of
feeling the ground becoming firmer, and
presently I was able to drag myself, pant-
ing but elated, on to a grassy hillock. The
unerring instinct of the animal had saved
me from the fate which my own reason
had been powerless to avert.

  After a few minutes I rose to my feet,

whereupon the dog trotted on a yard or
so ahead, giving a low whine now and
again as though inviting me to follow
him. And I was only too pleased to avail
myself of his friendly guidance. I pur-
posely refrained from attempting to make
friends with him, thinking that I might
distract his attention and cause him to
follow me, instead of allowing me to fol-
low him. I trudged on in silence until
I heard my boots crunching on the hard
gravel of the highroad.

  "Good dog,” I called out coaxingly.
’'Wise old boy! I’ll buy you the finest
feed of meat you ever tasted, as soon as I
can. Home, boy, home! Show me
where you live, like a wise old doggie.”
He gave a short bark and wagged his tail
as if he understood my words, then trot-
ted on ahead as before. I quickened my
steps in order to get a nearer look at him.

  Until then I had naturally assumed it
to be one of the sheep-dogs belonging to
an adjacent croft, but now, even in the
darkness, I came to the conclusion that
the dog was much too large to belong to
that breed. Little as I felt inclined to
criticize its appearance, I could not help
thinking what a weird-looking creature
it was. It seemed to be built on some-
what similar lines to a greyhound, but it
was much larger and its coat, instead of
being smooth, was of long rough hair, in
hue a peculiar shade of pallid gray. My
impression was necessarily vague, for it
was gleaned by the flickering flame of a
match as I paused to light my pipe. It
appeared to me, however, that the dog
was an unusually large specimen of the
Scottish deerhound.

  But had he been the sorriest-looking
mongrel breathing, I should have been
quite content to follow my four-footed
262

WEIRD TALES

rescuer wherever he might lead. Truth
to tell, I was beginning to grow quite
fond of his company, and I determined
that if his owner was disposed to part with
him for a reasonable sum, he would find
a good home with me for the rest of his
days.

  As things turned out, however, I never
had the chance of speaking to his owner,
for we had no sooner arrived in the im-
mediate neighborhood of the lighted win-
dows which had been the initial cause of
my trouble, than he gave vent to a long,
mournful howl and raced across the moor
until he was swallowed up in the darkness
of the night.

  I called after him and whistled for sev-
eral minutes, but he did not return; so I
turned again to the welcoming lights—
only to utter a gasp of sheer amazement
and remain staring at what I saw.

I had fully expected to find myself con-
fronted with a tiny crofter’s cottage,
or at most with a fair-sized sheep farm.
Instead, I saw before me a massive, iron-
studded gate, defended by portcullis and
numerous machicolations overhead, and
flanked by turrets bearing the extinguish-
er-shaped roofs so commonly seen in Scot-
tish mediaeval architecture. Beyond the
outer walls I caught a dim impression of
the sheer towers and lofty battlements of
a central keep.

  This was certainly a very different end-
ing from what I had anticipated. For a
while I stood there, overawed by the im-
posing majesty of the mighty building I
had stumbled upon all unawares. The
very walls seemed to look down in frown-
ing disdain upon my weary and mud-be-
draggled figure, as though daring me to
invade their haughty precincts. -To use

the expressive Scotch j idiom, the place
looked "unco ghaisdy,” and 1 found my-
self wishing more heartily than ever that
I had kept to my original intention of
making for Melvaig.

  Presently my eyes caught the glint of
brass upon the ancient timbers of the gate.
It was a very modem-looking bell-button.
and on the outer rim it bore the prosaic
invitation, "Push.”

  I placed my finger on the ivory knob
and pushed accordingly, and presently, in
response to the distant whirring of an
electric bell, footsteps sounded on the
stone flags on the other side and the door
swung silently open.

  Although my appearance at that lonely
spot might well have occasioned some
surprize, there was no sign of such an
emotion on the sedate features of the el-
derly, liveried man-servant who appeared.
In a few words I explained that I had lost
my way on the moors and asked if he could
direct me to the nearest inn. The latter
request brought a ghost of a smile to his
shaven lips.

  "The nearest, said ye?” he repeated
with peculiar emphasis. "Wheest, man!
Do ye no ken that this is Duncardin Cas-
tle, and the nearest hoose o’ call is a mat-
ter o’ eight miles awa’?”

  As he mentioned the name of the cas-
tle something seemed to stir faintly in the
depths of my memory. When and where
had I heard that narrie before? For a
moment I stood vainly trying to fix the
half-forgotten associations; then, like a
flash of light streaming into a darkened
room, recollection came—Alan Duncar-
din, the young "one-pip” who had joined
our battalion when we were holding the
water-logged ditches which went by the
name of trendies to the west of Armen-
THE HOUND OF DUNCARDIN

263

tieres. Could it b? possible that there
was some connection between the two?

   The subject of the various nationalities
of the men who formed the Scottish regi-
ments was something of a standing joke
in the British army, for it was asserted
that they came from anywhere except
north of the Tweed. But the traditional
gibe had no point in the case of Second-
Lieutenant Duncardin. A tall, lanky, raw-
boned youth, with sandy hair and a seri-
ous freckled face, he was every inch a true
highlander—"Ye micht almaist see the
heather grawin’ betwix his taes,” as our
old pipe-major once declared solemnly.
All this passed through my mind so
quickly that there was scarcely a notice-
able pause before I again addressed the
man.

  "Does Mr. Alan Duncardin live here?”

  "Nae doot ye mean Sir Alan Duncar-
iin?”

  "Yes,” I returned, hoping that I was
speaking the truth. "Will you give him
my card?”

  The man ushered me into the lofty,
antler-hung hall and disappeared in quest
of his master. A few moments later the
door opened and I saw that my chance
shot had indeed hit the mark. The man
who came eagerly forward with out-
stretched hand was the young subaltern
whom I had last seen being carried down
the communication trench, badly gassed.

  No sooner did he learn of my misad-
ventures of the night than he dragged me
upstairs and insisted on my donning one
of his spare suits while my own soaking
clothes were drying. After a hearty sup-
per and a stiff glass of whisky I felt more
comfortable than I had ever hoped to feel
that night.

  "You had a close call on the marsh,”

said Alan. "If you had passed it by day*
light you would have seen the notices
which I’ve had put up, warning travelers
to keep to the road.”

  "I have to thank your dog that I am
here at all,” I rejoined, but my host shook
his head.

  "It wasn’t my dog. The only dog we
have is a toy spaniel belonging to Lady
Annabel, my stepmother. The dog you
<saw must have been a stray sheep-dog
from somewhere or other. The intelli-
gence of such animals is marvelous. I
have seen one of them, without any super-
vision, bring in a herd of thirty cows, one
by one, to the milking-house without ever
fetching a second time a cow which has
been milked.”

  I shook my head. "I’m positive that!
the dog that guided me here was a deer-
hound,” I said.

  "Impossible. The only dog of that
breed about here died over a year since,”
Alan said impatiently, and abruptly
changed the subject.

  We sat yarning and smoking and fight-
ing our battles over again until late in
the night. He told me that he had come
into the title and estates some eighteen
months previously, when his elder brother
had died after a brief illness. His father,
Sir James Duncardin, had married a sec-
ond time, and his widow, the present
Lady-Dowager Annabel, occupied a sep-
arate suite of rooms in the great rambling
castle, together with her son, Ian, who
was Alan’s half-brother and next in suc-
cession. Most of the older portions of
the feudal stronghold were shut up and
unoccupied.

   "It’s a very interesting old place,” said
Alan. "You must let me take you over
it in the morning—for of course you’re!
going to make this your headquarters foil
264

WEIRD TALES

the next week or so. I've already ordered
your room to be got ready. By die way,”
he added with a smile, "I hope you’re
not scared of ghosts?”

  "Why? Have you got a family specter
or two on the premises?” I laughingly in-
quired.

  "So they say,” he answered carelessly,
and proceeded to lead the way up a wind-
ing stone staircase to my bedroom.

I got something of a surprize when I
entered the breakfast room the follow-
ing morning. My mind, in response to
Alan’s description of his stepmother as
the "Lady-Dowager,” had conjured up a
vision of a venerable, silvery-haired old
Jady clad in rustling black silk who, more
probably than not, supported her tottering
footsteps with the aid of an ebony stick,
imagine my astonishment to find myself
being introduced to a radiandy beautiful
young lady who appeared to be scarcely
older than Alan himself. She must have
married the late Sir James unusually
young. I decided as I regarded her pale
though petal-clear skin and the wavy
masses of hair which, shining with the
glossy Mack luster of a bird’s plumage,
'framed the perfect oval of her face. Her
tyes, shadowed with long lashes, held in
their dark depths a baffling expression
that was at once languorous yet keenly
alert; the set of her firm, scarlet lips, the
enly touch of color in her face, appeared
ca hint at unusual determination and fix-
ity of purpose.

  Ian Duncardin, her son, had inherited
sjmething of her dark, exotic beauty; but
fe’is face bore a sulky expression, and for
s>me reason or other he seemed just then
e:* be somewhat ill at ease.

  We chatted on different subjeas dur-
isg the meal, and presently I began to
cR than of my adventure on the moor.

I had just reached the point where I was
describing the coming of the strange
hound when Alan thought fit to supple-
ment my tale with a few words of—to my
thinking unnecessary—explanation.

  "Of course it was some wandering
sheep-dog,” he interposed.

  I shook my head decisively. "No. I
am prepared to take my oath that the ani-
mal I saw was a huge, gray-coated deer-
hound.”

  A sudden crash interrupted me. The
coffee-cup had fallen from Lady Anna-
bel’s hand and she was staring across the
table at me with parted lips and wide-
open eyes.

  "A deerhound, did you say?” she
asked slowly.

   "I’m sure of it,” I returned, not a little
puzzled to account for her intense inter-
est in the breed of the dog. "I’m very
fond of dogs, and I take a great interest
in the various breeds. It was a deer-
hound, sure enough. I intend to take a
long tramp across the moor this morning
in the hope of renewing my acquaintance
with my friend in need.”

  "I don’t think you’ll meet that dog
again,” said Lady Annabel slowly. "But
if you do, I should advise you to give it
a wide berth.”

  I lifted my eyebrows at this. "Why,
do you think it is dangerous?”

   She nodded her dark head once or twice
as she regarded me through narrowed lids.

  "Yes,” she said at length. "It migfcc
be very dangerous.” And after a pause
she repeated the last two words under
her breath: "Very dangerous!”

  I smiled to myself but said nothing.
It seemed to me that Alan's beautiful
stepmother was unusually nervous where
dogs were concerned. Subsequent events
proved that she hsd need to be.
THE HOUND OF DUNCARDIN

   Breakfast over, Alan took me for a tour
of inspection over the old castle. I say
"tour” advisedly, for the place proved to
be much more extensive than I had at
first supposed. Although interesting
enough from an antiquarian point of
view, the dark corridors and deserted
chambers had a grim, forbidding air. The
old chieftain who had reared it had
planned with an eye to strength rather
than comfort, and but few modern im-
provements had been added subsequently.

  Lastly he showed me the chapel. It
was small, but a perfect gem of pure
Gothic architecture, with exquisite stone
carvings on the capitals of the pillars and
the frettings of the vaulted roof. Here
were the tombs of every head of the
House of Duncardin, from the first Sir
Roderick to Alan’s elder brother, who had
been laid their eighteen months ago.

   "He died young,” I remarked, as I read
the inscription chiseled on the marble
slab which covered the entrance to the
vault. "Did he meet with an accident?”

  Alan Duncardin shook his head with-
out speaking, and immediately turned and
led the way out of the chapel. Glancing
at his face, I noticed that he looked un-
usually pale, and as he mounted the spiral
stair his breathing became labored and
irregular.

   "It’s that cursed gas!” he gasped jerk-
ily. "I’ve never been the same since it
bowled me over that night when the Ger-
mans made their big drive at Bois Grenier.
I’m sorry to leave you on your own, but
I think I’ll have to turn in for a bit until
I feel a little better. Would you mind
helping me to my room and asking Du-
gald to send for Dr. Blair?”

  Although Alan tried to make light of
his illness, I could see that he was in con-

siderable internal pain, but somehow or
other I could not reconcile his symptoms
with the after-effects of poison gas. It
seemed to me more likely that he had
eaten something that had disagreed with
him.

   I caught sight of Dr. Blair as he passed
through the hall on his arrival. He was
stout and elderly, with a slow, pompous
manner, and he evidently possessed no
small opinion of his own importance.

  "Poor Alan has had one of his at-
tacks,” I heard Lady Annabel say as she
came forward to meet him.

   "Oh, I’ll soon set him right again,” was
the doctor’s confident reply. "Nothing
to be alarmed about, your ladyship. These
attacks are distressing while they last, and
—ah—undoubtedly painful. But a little
treatment — ah — palliative treatment,
which a practitioner of my large experi-
ence knows so well how to adminis-

  I could not help smiling to myself as
they passed out of earshot. Evidently
Dr. Blair was a type of medical man that
is fast becoming extinct.

In spite of the aged medico’s confidence
in the efficacy of "a little palliative
treatment,” it was quickly apparent that
Alan’s illness was no trifling matter. He
was confined to his bed the whole of the
next day, and I was rigidly excluded from
his room. Left to my own devices, I
routed out a very serviceable built-cane
rod and a book of flies, and, armed with
these, I determined to see what sport the
sea-trout would afford in the neighboring
loch. After lunch I waylaid Dugald, the
old butler, and made a few inquiries as to
the best places to try.

  "Aye, there’s some gran’ fush in yon
266

WEIRD TALES

loch,” he said in a tone which showed him
to be a keen enthusiast in the beloved
sport of Izaak Walton; and he surprized
me somewhat by offering to accompany
me and act as gillie.

   I was only too pleased to take advan-
tage of his offer, for local knowledge
means a lot of difference to your haul
when fishing strange waters. Dugald
changed his clothes for a suit of home-
spun tweed, and we set out together, he
carrying a creel and a gaff whose dimen-
sions seemed to augur well for the size of
the "fush” he expected to encounter.

   From a fly-fisher’s point of view the
weather was unusually promising. The
sky was overcast with a thin veil of fleecy
clouds, just sufficient to take the glare off
the water; the gentle westerly breeze was
just strong enough to cause a tiny ripple
on the otherwise calm waters of the loch.
Old Dugald pointed to where a series of
tiny swirling breaks showed on the sur-
face of the inshore shallows.

   "Guidsakes, sir, but they’re takin’ fine.
Ye’ll hae guid sport, A’m thinkin’.”

  The old man proved a true prophet.
After an afternoon of pleasurable excite-
ment I had the satis faction of seeing five
fine trout, none of them under three
pounds, safely gaffed and transferred to
the creel. By the time the fish had ceased
to rise, the sun was already low in the
western sky.

   I noticed that Dugald seemed unusually
silent and thoughtful as we started to re-
turn; he gave me the impression of want-
ing to say something without knowing
exactly how to begin. When we were
almost at the castle gate he turned to me
with a question:

   "Begging your pardon, sir, but did I
no hear ye tell her leddyship something

aboot a deerhoond that ye saw the nicht
ve came here?”	•••*•/

   I told him of my adventure on the moor
and of the dog that had shown me the way
out of the swamp. When I had finished,
the old man shook his head.

   "I dinna ken any such dog hereaboots,”
he said slowly, adding in a curious tone
of voice, "at least, no the noo.”

   "What do you mean?” I asked, puzzled
as much by his tone as the broad Doric.

   Dugald puckered his eyes and favored
me with an odd look.

  "The young laird, Sir Malcolm, used
to hae such a dog as yon, and verra’ fond
of it he was, too. After Sir Malcolm
died, the dog was aye scratching and
whining at his tomb in the auld chapel.
The puir critter’s grief was pitiful to wit-
ness, sir, and in the end her leddyship had
to hae puir Bruce—that was the dog’s
name, sir—she had to hae him destroyed.”

   "So the dog is dead?” I asked, rather
needlessly.

   "Deid an’ buried, sir, these eighteen
months.”

   "In that case it could not have been
Bruce that I saw on the moor,” I re-
marked with a laugh.

  There was a long pause during which
Dugald strode by my side in silence.
Glancing out of the tail of my eye, I saw
that he was stroking the strip of sandy-
gray whisker, at the side of his face, with
a curiously irresolute air. At last he
stopped dead and grasped my arm.

  "The young laird died michty queer
and sudden, an noo Sir Alan’s tuk wi’ the
same seemptoms—an’, mark ye, her led-
dyship’s ain son is heir to the title and
estates-■”
THE HOUND OF DUNCARDIN

267

  I scared, at the man blankly, only half
comprehending the sinister meaning of
the fiercely whispered words.

  "Good God. man!” I cried. "What
do you suspect?”

  "I suspect there's deil’s wurrk gang on
yonder/’ he jerked his head toward the
distant towers, now outlined black against
the glory of die dying sun. "It’s ma be-
lief that the hound ye saw was no mortal
critter, and, if I may make so bold. I’d
like ye to let me know the meenit ye see
it again. I sleep in the room wi’ the door
facing the passage belangin’ to your ain
room, sir, and I doot I’ll be wakin’ maist
the night.”

  As he said the words a faint sound was
borne to our ears on the wings of the ris*
ing night wind. Far off and intermittent
though it was, there could be no mistak-
ing the nature of that cry, and I shivered
suddenly as though a sponge soaked in
ice-cold water had been passed down my
spine.

  For the sound we heard was the long-
drawn, mournful baying of a hound.

Tired out as I was by my long day in
the open air, I found that sleep would
not come to me that night. My mind
was busy with a thousand thoughts, spec-
ulations, and wild, impracticable plans as
I lay staring up at the black-raftered ceil-
ing above my bed. counting the quarters
as they were told by the old clock at the
foot of the stairs, watching and waiting
for I knew not what.

  To my ears, strained to catch the slight-
est sound, the ancient pile seemed filled
with a thousand vague noises: the faint
impact of a shutter against the wall as it
swung in the wind, the occasional whine
of the weathercock on the pointed roof of

the tower overhead as it swung to the ran-
dom gusts, the flapping of a loose corner
of the tapestry on the wall, and the slow,
regular tapping of some beetle burrowing
in the ancient wainscot.

  At last I could bear the tedium of my
own thoughts no longer. I switched on
my electric pocket-lamp and took up a
book which I had begun earlier in the day.
But the commonplace plot and the trite
phrases proved a more effective anodyne
than I had anticipated; after reading a
page or two I was soundly asleep.

  How long I slept I know not, but I
woke with a start, every nerve a-tingle.
In the corridor outside was a sound differ-
ent from the natural noises of the night.
It was the faint, padding footfalls of a
large hound. Nearer and nearer they
came, not ceasing until they were opposite
the door of my room. Then there came
the sound of snuffing at the crack between
the woodwork of the panels and the floor.

  I passed my tongue over my dry lips,
then called softly.

  "Bruce!”

  The dog seemed to recognize his name,
for he gave a low whine of recognition
and pawed eagerly against the door. So
friendly and natural was his demonstra-
tion of delight that I felt my misgivings
vanish. I rose, put on a dressing-gown
and thrust my feet into my slippers. Then
I crossed to the door and—not without
some slight hesitation, I confess—pulled
back the bolt and allowed it to swing open.

  Standing on the threshold, wagging his
long, bushy tail with pleasure, was the
deerhound that had saved me from the
marsh.

  For a moment I stared at him in won-
dering silence, scarcely knowing what to
think. Then Bruce bounded forward,
268

WEIRD TALES

thrust his muzzle against my legs, his
great expressive eyes looking up into my
face and then at the door with an appeal
there could be no mistaking.

  I leant down and patted his coarse,
shaggy coat.

  "What is it, Bruce, old boy?” I said.

  The great dog trotted out into the cor-
ridor, then half turned and stood watch-
ing me, whining softly the while. It was
an unmistakable invitation for me to fol-
low him.

  Mindful of my promise to the old but-
ler, I tapped lightly on his door. It was
immediately opened by Dugald who,
fully dressed, had been awaiting the
summons.

  "Guid presairve us!” the old man whis-
pered in an awed voice. " ’Tis auld
Bruce himself!”

  "And he wants to lead us somewhere,”
I returned. "Come, let us follow him.”

  Treading as softly as possible, we passed
along the corridor and down the spiral
staircase to the ground floor. There the
dog made straight for the door leading
into the old chapel.

  " ’Tis as I thocht, sir. The puir beast
is makin’ for his maister’s grave!”

  The old man’s hands were trembling
so that he could scarcely fit the key in the
lock. But at last he had the door open;
then, straight as an arrow, the hound
made for the marble slab which covered
the tomb of the dead laird and began
scratching frantically at it with his paws.

  "Is there a vault below that stone?” I
asked the white-haired man at my side.

  "Aye, sir. But surely--”

  "Help me to raise it,” I interrupted.

  Exerting our united strength, we
shifted the slab to one side. Beneath was
a square, stone-lined cavity containing a

single coffin. The dog immediately leapt
down, and I, pausing only to thrust my
lamp into Dugald’s shaking hand and
bid him direct the beam downward, fol-
lowed. The agitation of the dog was piti-
ful when I commenced to loosen the
screws of the coffin lid with the blade of
my knife. But, unheedful of everything
save the task before me, I worked stead-
ily until the last one was extracted and
the lid was free.

  Slowly, reverently, I uncovered the
face of the body within; then-

  "What is the meaning of this?” de-
manded a harsh, metallic voice above me.

  It was Lady Annabel, her face death-
white, her dark eyes charged with hor-
ror, and, it seemed, with fear as well. I
scrambled out of the vault and stood fac-
ing her.

  "It means that I have solved the mys-
tery of Sir Malcolm’s untimely death,” I
said slowly, "and, unless I mistake not,
of Sir Alan’s present illness.”

  "You’re mad!” came from the woman’s
faltering lips.

  I pointed downward into the vault.

  "Look upon the face of the dead, Lady
Annabel,” I said sternly. "There is only
one thing that would preserve a body un-
corrupted for so long a time. Sir Mal-
colm met his death by arsenic!”

  Lady Annabel slowly raised her hand,
and for the first time I saw that she held
a small silver-plated revolver. I saw the
shining barrel change into a circle as she
aimed the weapon at me, and I gave my-
self up for lost.

  A horrible, rasping laugh came from
her lips.

  "You’re right—I poisoned him!” she
cried. "Take that knowledge with you to
hell!”

  I threw myself flat as the weapon
“JUST A SONG AT TWILIGHT”

269

cracked, and I heard the smack of the
bullet on the stones above my head. Im-
mediately afterward another report
echoed through the silent chapel. When
I rose unsteadily to my feet it was to see

the murderess lying, slain by her own
hand, by the side of her victim’s grave.

  But the faithful hound, whose love
and devotion death itself had been power-
less to quench, was nowhere to be seen.

A Brief IVeird 'Tale

“JUST A SONG AT
TWILIGHT”

By AUGUST W. DERLETH

THEY heard it first a week after
Edward had been taken ill. They
were sitting in the living-room
before the fireplace, waiting for the
doctor to come down to them from the
darkened room above, when they heard
the woman singing. It came quite sud-
denly, and Mrs. Grant started forward.

  "My dear,” she said, turning to her
husband, "I do believe that wretched
nurse is singing.”

  "Nonsense,” said he, “it is most like-
ly a woman somewhere on the street.”
Mrs. Grant hesitated. "I don’t think
it is, John. It’s somewhere in this
house, I’m sure. I think,” she said half
rising, "I shall go look for it.”

  He patted her arm gently. "You
should go and rest, darling. This con-
stant waiting is upsetting you too much.
I am quite certain that the singing is
outside, and if it isn’t, we can always
track it down tomorrow.”

  Abruptly, the doctor came into the
room. He put down his case, and came
over to the fireplace, where he stood
confronting them.

  "Well?” said John Grant, looking up
at him.

  The doctor took off his pince-nez and
rubbed them reflectively for a moment
before replying. Then he shrugged his
shoulders jerkily and said, "I can hardly
say definitely now. The boy has a strong
fever, and I’m afraid delirium is not far
away. In cases of this kind, absolute
quiet is necessary. Now, I heard some
one singing just before, and that must
be stopped at once.” The doctor cast a
quick glance in the direction of Mrs.
Grant.

  "Then it was not the nurse,” said
Mrs. Grant.

  "Certainly not,” replied the doctor.
"I thought—felt, that it came from this
floor.”

  "And I am sure it came from above,”
said Mrs. Grant.

  "A woman in the street, I think,”
said John Grant easily.

  "Oh!” exclaimed the doctor, "I am
sorry. I was so sure that it came from
somewhere in the house. Curious how
270

WEIRD TALES

one is deceived sometimes! But then,
you have such a big house.”

  "The cook,” murmured Mrs. Grant
in an undertone, as if she had not heard.
"My dear!” said John Grant sharply.
The doctor raised his eyebrows very
slightly, and for a moment his face
seemed very uneasy. "This boy,” he
said suddenly, "you say he is not your
own child?”

  "No,” said Grant. "No, he isn’t;
though, of course, we’ve made him feel
as much our own as the others. No, we
found him one night on our doorstep.
Bitter cold it was, and, of course, we
took him in.”

  "You advertised?” said the doctor,
putting on his glasses once more.

  "Nothing came of it; so we adopted
die poor fellow.” John Grant rose with
alacrity. "Let me go to the door with
you, doctor.”

  He took the doctor’s arm, and to-
gether the two men moved out of the
room. John Grant closed the door of
the living-room softly behind him.

  "Will you have a cigar, doctor?” he
asked, drawing a vest-pocket case from
his dressing-gown.

  "Thank you, I will.”

  John Grant waited until the doctor
was well started on the cigar before he
spoke. "You’ll forgive me for not
smoking with you, I hope,” he said,
"but there are a few things I’d like to
say to you.”

  "Yes, I thought there was something
on your mind, Grant,” said the doctor.
"Is it about your wife?”

  "Not exactly, no. It’s the boy.”
  "Oh,” said the doctor. "I’m afraid

for him, of course. I don’t think-”

   "It’s not that,” said John Grant hast-
ily. "It’s something else. You know, I

think the boy has the most startling de-
lusions sometimes.”

                                               , f •

  "Indeed. Well, that is rather com-
mon in cases like this.”

  "No, no. Doctor, you don’t under-
stand. I mean, when he’s not ill at all.
He has the delusions then. When we
first took him into this house—why, he
found his way about here with startling
rapidity. He seemed to know every
nook and cranny of the house before
either my wife or I did. I had the most
uncanny feeling—you know, it was al-
most as if the boy had been here before.”
The doctor raised his eyebrows and
regarded the glowing end of his cigar
reflectively. "I don’t think of that as a
delusion,” he said slowly. "That’s quite
a natural thing—this extraordinary ca-
pacity for finding their way about—in
children especially.”

  "No,” said John Grant. "If that
were all! The boy knew just where the
nursery was, for instance. And the
longer he stayed with us, the more pecu-
liar he became. He used to speak very
often of having played there before, and
then he’d mention the others. I can’t
make it out. My wife thought it very
peculiar at first, but finally she thought
that perhaps the boy was playing a little
game all his own.”

  "Possible,” said the doctor shortly.
"How old was the boy when you found
him?”

  "Four or five, I think,” said Grant.
"He’d evidently walked to this place
from wherever he came. He was hud-
dled up against the door in all that cold.”
"Well,” said the doctor. "Have you
ever considered that he might have been
here before?”

  "I looked up the family who’d had
this house for years before we came*
"JUST A SONG AT TWILIGHT'’

271

Family by the name of Carroll. There
was only one child, and he died quite
earl}', I understand.”

  The doctor nodded. “Well,” he said,
"I’ll go over my books and hunt up
parallel cases. You know, we scientific
men are rather skeptical. I’m afraid
what you’re driving at is some sort of
reincarnation, and that’s a little stiff.”
"I’ll expect to hear from you,” said
Grant.

  The doctor picked up his case and
moved toward the outer door.

  "And by the way,” said John Grant
on the threshold, "if you hear that sing-
ing again, doctor—I’d rather you said
nothing about it to my wife.”

  The doctor looked hard at Grant.
"Very well,” he said, "I won’t. But
I’ll tell you, it had better stop. For the
boy’s sake.”

  "A woman outside,” said Grant lame*

ty-

  "Sheer nonsense,” said the doctor
sharply. "That singing came from
somebody in the house, and it excited the
boy very much.”

John grant closed the door and
walked slowly down the hall and into
the living-room. His wife had gone
upstairs, but he saw the white-clad form
of the nurse waiting to speak to him.

  "My wife has gone up?” he asked, as
he came up to her.

  The nurse nodded. "Yes. She is
with the boy now, and I came down to
tell you, as you asked me to. about the
singing. It was so much louder to-
night; you must have heard it.”

  "I did. Both of us did, as a matter
of fact.”

   "Yes, the doctor did, too,” she con-
tinued. "And the boy . . . why, he was

positively wild in spite of his weak con-
dition—seemed to want to sing along,
and actually tried.”

  "Did you get the words?” asked John
Grant. "We couldn’t distinguish words
down here.”

  "The woman was singing Love’s Old
Sweet Song—quite an old piece,” said
the nurse.

  John Grant nodded thoughtfully. "Is
there anydiing more?” he asked.

  "Yes,” said the nurse. "I saw the
woman.”

   John Grant looked at tlie nurse. "You
saw her? How was that? Surely she
was not in Edward’s room?”

  "No, she wasn’t.” said the nurse.
"When the doctor first heard the sound
he said for me to go and see who was
singing. I felt it would do no good,
but I stepped outside the door of the
room for a moment, and there she was,
standing at the end of the hall.”

  "What did she look like?”

  "Seemed to be in some kind of bath-
robe. She was not very clearly outlined,
and except for her face, was all grayish.
I could see through her.”

   "What did you do?” asked Grant.

   "I went toward her. and she just van-
ished. Melted away,” said the nurse.

  "Brave girl,” said Grant. "Anybody
else would have screamed to bring the
house down!”

   "I’d better go back up now,” said the
nurse, and John Grant nodded.

Next day John Grant went to see the
agent who had sold him the house
and had told him about the Carrolls.

  "I remember telling you that there
were queer stories about the house,” said
Mr. Barnes, "and I think you made a
bit of a joke of the matter. The woman
272

WEIRD TALES

who sings the twilight song is one of the
stories.”

  "Well, who is she supposed to be?”
asked John Grant.

  The agent shrugged his shoulders.
"That’s more than I can say,” he said.
"But there’s one thing you might keep
in mind. Mrs. Carroll went a little mad
after the death of her son, and died not
long after. And the son’s name, by the
way, was Edward.”

  "Why!” exclaimed Grant. "That’s
more than a coincidence!”

  "I can’t tell you any more, Mr.
Grant,” continued the agent. "If any-
thing further happens, come in again to
see me. I’ll do what I can for you.”
"One thing more,” said Grant. "Tell
me, do you believe in reincarnation?”
Mr. Barnes favored his visitor with a
smile which very clearly expressed his
contempt for reincarnation. "Why, no,”
he said, very affably, "I don’t think I
do.”

  The doctor, when he came, was like-
wise inclined to look very severely on
Grant’s curious idea. "It’s preying on
your mind, Grant, and that’s bad for you.
Get rid of the idea somehow; it’s just
something that seems to fit a peculiar
set of circumstances, that’s all.”

  "I wish,” said Grant stonily, "that it
were. Let us drop the matter, doctor.
How is the boy?”

  "Very low,” said the doctor gravely.
"Frankly, I don't think I shall be needed
again.”

  Grant nodded. "All right, doctor.
About when, do you think?”

  "He may last through until morning;
that will give him a better chance again.
But if he is disturbed—in any way ex-
cited during the night—he can’t last.”

  John Grant nodded thoughtfully.
"Very well.”

   "And don’t, for his sake, let that woman
start singing again tonight.

  Grant smiled wryly. "Do you think
she would have sung before, if I could
have stopped her?”

   The doctor looked at Grant suspiciously.
"See here, Grant,” he said, picking up his
case, "you watch yourself, or you’ll go
under one of these days.”

  With that, the doctor was gone, and
John Grant turned back and went into
the living-room. His wife was watch-
ing for him, looking eagerly over the
back of the chair.

   "What did he say?” she asked.

   "There is little hope, darling. Very
little. But he may last through the
night, if he is not disturbed. Then he
will have a much better chance.” He
tried to smile encouragingly, but he felt
that the attempt was not quite successful.

   He dropped into a chair at her side,
reached out and took her hand, and sat
with her looking into the dancing flames
before them. There they sat, listening
for a sound above the ticking of the clock
and the distant hum of motors on the
road outside—a sound of quick feet, and
the nurse’s low call. But there was
nothing.

The minutes passed, and the hours, and
then, suddenly, came the singing.
It was very low, but clear and sweet.
John Grant must have dozed off, for his
wife’s convulsive grasp on his hand
brought him up in his chair, fullv awake
on the instant.

   "Just ... a song . . . at . . . twi-light,
   When ... the lights . . . are . . . low;

   And . . . the flick’-ring . . . shadows
   Soft-ly come . . . and . . . go . . . J"
"JUST A SONG AT TWILIGHT”

273

There it was, in the air, all about them.

  "Edward,” said Mrs. Grant suddenly.
"That is for Edward.”

  "My dear,” said John Grant, looking
with alarm at his wife’s strained features,
"it is probably the cook, after all.”

  "No, no,” said Mrs. Grant. "The
cook is gone. I know—what it is. She
is coming for the boy—I can feel it.”
Mrs. Grant sprang up suddenly. "I am
going up,” she said.

  At the same instant came the sound
of swift, pattering feet, and from the
stairs beyond came the low voice of the
nurse, "Come quickly ... I think he’s
going.”

   John Grant was in the hall as quickly
as his wife. Running up the stairs, they
heard the nurse going back to Edward’s
room, and above the sound of running
feet, the singing.

   "Tho’ ... the heart . . . be . .. wea-iy.

Sad ... the day . . . and . . . long . . . !”

And then, suddenly, just before they*
reached the second floor, the singing be-

gan all over again, and now . . . there
were two voices, and one was the voice
of a boy!

  John Grant and his wife were half-
way down the hall, quite near the sick-
room, when Mrs, Grant stopped abrupt-
ly and clung to her husband, sobbing.
"Too late,” she said, "too late!”

  At the same moment, the door of the
sickroom opened, and the nurse ap-
peared, nodding her head. "Gone,” she
said.

  Then, together, the three turned to
look down the hall, where at its end a
faint grayness of two figures had inex-
plicably appeared. There seemed to be
a woman, and at her side, clasping her
hand, a boy, and as they were walking
along, through the wall and out into the
sky, there came the sound of the song,
growing always fainter and fainter, and
dwindling away at last to nothing:

   "Just ... a song . . . at . . . twi-light.

   When ... the lights . . . are „ . . low;

   And ... the flick’-ting . . . shadows

   Soft-Iy come , . , and . . . go."

GHOSTS

By JEWELL BOTHWELL TULL

 ’Tis said that nothing lives in the dark,
   That growing things must have the light;

 But I have seen the moon grow big
   And beautiful at night.

 And in the night my soul grows big
   With doubt and hope and love and pain

 That fade away with morning light,

   Leaving me cold again.

 The moon is made of old dead dreams,—
   Pale echoes of a living sun;

 The moon and I are lonely ghosts
 That die when dreams are done.
  The Permanent Stiletto

By W. C. MORROW

I HAD sent in all haste for Doctor
Rowell, but as yet he had not arrived,
and the strain was terrible. There lay
my young friend upon his bed in the
hotel, and I believed that he was dying.
Only the jewelled handle of the knife was
visible at his breast; the blade was wholly
sheathed in his body.

  "Pull it out, old fellow,” begged the
sufferer through white, drawn lips, his
gasping voice being hardly less distress-
ing than the unearthly look in his eyes.

  "No, Arnolcf,” said I, as I held his
hand and gently stroked his forehead. It
may have been instinct, it may have been
a certain knowledge of anatomy that
made me refuse.

  "Why not? It hurts,” he gasped. It
was pitiful to see him suffer, this strong,
healthy, daring, reckless young fellow.

  Doctor Rowell walked in—a tall, grave
man, with gray hair. He went to the
bed and I pointed to the knife-handle,
with its great, bold ruby in the end and
its diamonds and emeralds alternating in
quaint designs in the sides. The phy-
274

sician started. He felt Arnold’s pulse
and looked puzzled.

  "When was this done?” he asked.

  "About twenty minutes ago,” I an-
swered.

  The physician started out, beckoned me _
to follow.

  "Stop!” said Arnold. We obeyed.
"Do you wish to speak of me?” he asked.

  "Yes,” replied the physician, hes-
itating.

  "Speak in my presence then,” said my
friend; "I fear nothing.” It was said in
his old, imperious way, although his suf-
fering must have been great.

  "If you insist--”

  "I do.”

  "Then,” said the physician, *'if you
have any matters to adjust they should
be attended to at once. I can do nothing
for you.”

  "How long can I live?” asked Arnold.

  The physician thoughtfully stroked his
gray beard. "It depends,” he finally
said; "if the knife be withdrawn you may
live three minutes; if it be allowed to re-
THE PERMANENT STILETTO

275

main you may possibly live an hour or
two—not longer.”

  Arnold never flinched.

  "Thank you,” he said, smiling faintly
through his pain; "my friend here will
pay you. I have some things to do. Let
the knife remain.” He turned his eyes
to mine, and, pressing my hand, said, af-
fectionately, "And I thank you, too, old
fellow, for not pulling it out.”

  The physician, moved by a sense of
delicacy, left the room, saying, "Ring if
there is a change. I will be in the hotel
office.” He had not gone far when he
turned and came back. "Pardon me,”
said he, "but there is a young surgeon in
the hotel who is said to be a very skilful
man. My specialty is not surgery, but
medicine. May I call him?”

  "Yes,” said I, eagerly; but Arnold
smiled and shook his head. "I fear there
will not be time,” he said. But I refused
to heed him and directed that the sur-
geon be called immediately. I was writ-
ing at Arnold’s dictation when the two
men entered the room.

There was something of nerve and
assurance in the young surgeon that
struck my attention. His manner, though
quiet, was bold and straightforward and
his movements sure and quick. This
young man had already distinguished
himself in the performance of some dif-
ficult hospital laparotomies, and he was
at that sanguine age when ambition looks
through the spectacles of experiment.
Doctor Raoul Entrefort was the new-
comer’s name. He was a Creole, small
and dark, and he had travelled and stud-
ied in Europe.

  "Speak freely,” gasped Arnold, after
Doctor Entrefort had made an examina-
tion.

  "What think you, doctor?” asked En-
trefort of the older man.

  "I think,” was the reply, "that the
knifeblade has penetrated the ascending
aorta, about two inches above the heart.
So long as the blade remains in the
wound the escape of blood is compar-
atively small, though certain; were the
blade withdrawn the heart would almost
instantly empty itself through the aortal
wound.”

  Meanwhile, Entrefort was deftly cut-
ting away the white shirt and the under-
shirt, and soon had the breast exposed.
He examined the gem-studded hilt widi
the keenest interest. "You are proceed-
ing on the assumption, doctor,” he said,
"that this weapon is a knife.”

  "Certainly,” answered Doctor Rowell,
smiling; "what else can it be?”

  "It is a knife,” faintly interposed Ar-
nold.

  "Did you see the blade?” Entrefort
asked him, quickly.

  "I did—for a moment.”

  Entrefort shot a quick look at Doctor
Rowell and whispered, "Then it is not
suicide.” Doctor Rowell looked puzzled
and said nothing.

  "I must disagree with you, gentle-
men,” quietly remarked Entrefort; "this
is not a knife.” He examined the handle
very narrowly. Not only was the blade
entirely concealed from view within Ar-
nold’s body, but the blow had been so
strongly delivered that the skin was de-
pressed by the guard. "The fact that it
is not a knife presents a very curious se-
ries of facts and contingencies,” pursued
Entrefort, with amazing coolness, "some
of which are, so far as I am informed,
entirely novel in the history of surgery.”
A quizzical expression, faintly amused
and manifestly interested, was upon Doc-
276

WEIRD TALES

tor Rowell’s face. "What is the weapon,
doctor?” he asked.

   "A stiletto.”

  Arnold started. Doctor Rowell appeared
confused. "I must confess,” he said, "my
ignorance of the differences among these
penetrating weapons, whether dirks, dag-
gers, stilettos, poniards, or bowie-knives.”

  "With the exception of the stiletto,”
explained Entrefort, "all the weapons you
mention have one or two edges, so that
in penetrating they cut their way. A sti-
letto is round, is ordinarily about half an
inch or less in diameter at the guard, and
tapers to a sharp point. It penetrates
solely by pushing the tissues aside in all
directions. You will understand the im-
portance of that point.”

  Doctor Rowell nodded, more deeply
interested than ever.

  "How do you know it is a stiletto, Doc-
tor Entrefort?” I asked.

  "The cutting of these stones is the
work of Italian lapidaries,” he said, "and
they were set in Genoa. Notice, too, the
guard. It is much broader and shorter
than the guard of an edged weapon; in
fact, it is nearly round. This weapon is
about four hundred years old, and would
be cheap at twenty thousand florins. Ob-
serve, also, the darkening color of your
friend’s breast in the immediate vicinity
of the guard; this indicates that the tis-
sues have been bruised by the crowding
of the 'blade,’ if 1 may use the term.”

  "What has all this to do with me?”
asked the dying man.

  "Perhaps a great deal, perhaps noth-
ing. It brings a single ray of hope into
your desperate condition.”

  Arnold’s eyes sparkled and he caught
his breath. A tremor passed all through
him, and I felt it in the band 1 was hold-
ing. Life was sweet to him. then, after

all—sweet to this wild daredevil, who had
just faced death with such calmness!
Doctor Rowell, though showing no sign
of jealousy, could not conceal a look of
incredulity.

  "With your permission,” said Entre-
fort, addressing Arnold, "I will do what
I can to save your life.”

  "You may,” said the poor boy.

  "But I shall have to hurt you.”

  "Well.”

  "Perhaps very much.”

  "Well.”

  “And even if 1 succeed (the chance is
one in a thousand) you will never be a
sound man, and a constant and terrible
danger will always be present.”

  "Well.”

  Entrefort wrote a note and sent it away
in haste by a bellboy.

  "Meanwhile,” he resumed, "your life
is in imminent danger from shock, and
the end may come in a few minutes or
hours from that cause. Attend without
delay to whatever matters may require
settling, and Doctor Rowell,” glancing at
that gentleman, "will give you something
to brace you up. I speak frankly, for I
see that you are a man of extraordinary
nerve. Am 1 right?”

  "Be perfectly candid,” said Arnold.

  Doctor Rowell, evidently bewildered
by his cyclonic young associate, wrote a
prescription, which I sent by a boy to be
filled. With unwise zeal I asked Entre-
fort:

  "Is there not danger of lockjaw?”

  "No,” he replied; "there is not a suf-
ficiently extensive injury to peripheral
nerves to induce traumatic tetanus.”

  1 subsided. Doctor Rowell’s medicine
came and I administered a dose. The
physician and the surgeon then retired.
The poor sufferer straightened up his
THE PERMANENT STILETTO

277

business. When it was done he asked1
me:	,,

  '‘What is that crazy Frenchman going
to do to me?”

   "I have no idea; be patient.”

IN less than an hour they returned,
bringing with them a keen-eyed, tall
young man, who had a number of tools
wrapped in an apron. Evidently he was
unused to such scenes, for he became
deathly pale upon seeing the ghastly
spectacle on my bed. With staring eyes
and open mouth he began to retreat to-
ward the door, stammering:

  "I—I can’t do it.”

  "Nonsense, Hippolyte! Don’t be a
baby. Why, man, it is a case of life and
death!”

  "But—look at his eyes! He is dying!”
Arnold smiled. "I am not dead,
though,” he gasped.

   "I—I beg your pardon, ’ ’ said Hippolyte.
Doctor Entrefort gave the nervous man
a drink of brandy and then said:

  "No more nonsense, my boy; it must
be done. Gentlemen, allow me to intro-
duce Mr. Hippolyte, one of the most
original, ingenious, and skilful machinists
in the country.”

  Hippolyte, being modest, blushed as
he bowed. In order to conceal his confu-
sion he unrolled his apron on die table
with considerable noise of rattling tools.

  “I have to make some preparations be-
fore you may begin, Hippolyte, and I
want you to observe me that you may be-
come used not only to the sight of fresh
blood, but also, what is more trying, the
odor of it.”

  Hippolyte shivered. Entrefort opened
a case of surgical instruments.

  "Now, doctor, the chloroform,” he
said to Doctor Rowell,

   "I will not take it.” promptly interposed
the sufferer; "I want to know when I
die.”

  "Very well.” said Entrefort; "but you
have little nerve now to spare. We may
try it without chloroform, however. It
will be better if you can do without. Try
your best to lie still while I cut.”

  "What are you going to do?” asked
Arnold.

   "Save your life, if possible.”

  "How? Tell me all about it,”

  "Must you know?”

  "Yes.”'

  "Very well, then. The point of die
stiletto has passed entirely through the
aorta, which is the great vessel rising out
of the heart and carrying the aerated
blood to the arteries. If I should withdraw
the weapon the blood would rush from
the two holes in the aorta and you would
soon be dead. If the weapon had been a
knife, the parted tissue would have
yielded, and the blood would have been
forced out on either side of the blade and
would have caused death. As it is, not
a drop of blood has escaped from the
aorta into the thoracic cavity. All that is
left for us to do. then, is to allow the sti-
letto to remain permanently in the aorta.
Many difficulties at once present them-
selves, and I do not wonder at Doctor
Rowell's look of surprize and incredul-
ity.”

  That gentleman smiled and shook his
head.

  "It is a desperate chance,” continued
Entrefort, "and is a novel case in surgery;
but it is the only chance. The fact that
the weapon is a stiletto is the important
point—a stupid weapon, but a blessing to
us now. If the assassin had known more

she would have used-”

  Upon his employment of the noun
278

WEIRD TALES

"assassin” and the feminine pronoun
"she,” both Arnold and I started violent-
ly, and I cried out to the man to stop.

  "Let him proceed,” said Arnold, who,
by a remarkable effort, had calmed him-
self.

   "Not if the subject is painful,” Entre-
fort said.

   "It is not,” protested Arnold; "why do
you think the blow was struck by a
woman?”

   "Because, first, no man capable of be-
ing an assassin would use so gaudy and
valuable a weapon; second, no man
would be so stupid as to carry so anti-
quated and inadequate a thing as a sti-
letto, when that most murderous and
satisfactory of all penetrating and cutting
weapons, the bowie-knife, is available. She
was a strong woman, too, for it requires a
good hand to drive a stiletto to the guard,
even though it miss the sternum by a
hair’s breadth and slip between the ribs,
for the muscles here are hard and the
intercostal spaces narrow. She was not
only a strong woman, but a desperate one
also.”

  "That will do,” said Arnold. He beck-
oned me to bend closer. "You must
watch this man; he is too sharp; he is
dangerous.”

  "Then,” resumed Entrefort, "I shall
tell you what I intend to do. There will
undoubtedly be inflammation of the aor-
ta, which, if it persist, will cause a fatal
aneurism by a breaking down of the
aortal walls; but we hope, with the help
of your youth and health, to check it.

  "Another serious difficulty is this:
With every inhalation, the entire thorax
(or bony structure of the chest) consid-
erably expands. The aorta remains sta-
tionary. You will see, therefore, that as
your aorta and your breast are now held
in rigid relation to each other by the sti-

letto, the chest, with eviery inhalation,
lulls the aorta forward out of place
about half an inch. I am certain that it is
doing this, because there is no indication
of an escape of arterial blood into the
thoracic cavity; in other words, the
mouths of the two aortal wounds have
seized upon the blade with a firm hold
and thus prevent it from slipping in and
out. This is a very fortunate occurrence,
but one which will cause pain for some
time. The aorta, you may understand,
being made by the stiletto to move with
the breathing, pulls the heart backward
and forward with every breath you take;
but that organ, though now undoubtedly
much surprized, will accustom itself to its
new condition.

  "What I fear most, however, is the
formation of a clot around the blade.
You see, the presence of the blade in the
aorta has already reduced the blood-
carrying capacity of that vessel; a clot,
therefore, need not be very large to stop
up the aorta, and, of course, if that
should occur death would ensue. But the
clot, if one form, may be dislodged and
driven forward, in which event it may
lodge in any one of the numerous
branches from the aorta and produce re-
sults more or less serious, possibly fatal.
If, for instance, it should choke either the
right or the left carotid, there would en-
sue atrophy of one side of the brain, and
consequently paralysis of half the entire
body; but it is possible that in time there
would come about a secondary circula-
tion from the other side of the brain, and
thus restore a healthy condition. Or the
clot (which, in passing always from
larger arteries to smaller, must unavoid-
ably find one not sufficiently large to
carry it, and must lodge somewhere) may
either necessitate amputation of one of
the four limbs or lodge itself so deep
THE PERMANENT STILETTO

279

within the body that it can not be reached

with the knife. You are beginning to

realize some of the dangers which await
    ii

you.

  Arnold smiled faintly.

  "But we shall do our best to prevent
the formation of a clot,” continued En-
trefort; "there are drugs which may be
used with effect.”

  "Are there more dangers?”

  "Many more; some of the more serious
have not been mentioned. One of these
is the probability of the aortal tissues
pressing upon the weapon relaxing their
hold and allowing the blade to slip. That
would let out the blood and cause death.
I am uncertain whether the hold is
now maintained by the pressure of the
tissues or die adhesive quality of the
serum which was set free by the puncture.
I am convinced, though, that in either
event the hold is easily broken and that
it may give way at any moment, for it is
under several kinds of strains. Every
time the heart contracts and crowds the
blood into the aorta, the latter expands
a little, and then contracts when the pres-
sure is removed. Any unusual exercise
or excitement produces stronger and
quicker heart-beats, and increases the
strain on the adhesion of the aorta to the
weapon. A fright, fall, a jump, a blow
on the chest—any of these might so jar
the heart and aorta as to break the hold.”
Entrefort stopped.

  "Is that all?” asked Arnold.

  "No; but is not that enough?”

  "More than enough,” said Arnold,
with a sudden and dangerous sparkle in
his eyes. Before any of us could think,
the desperate fellow had seized the
handle of the stiletto with both hands in
a determined effort to withdraw it and
die. I had had no time to order my fac-

ulties to the movement of a muscle, when
Entrefort, with incredible alertness and
swiftness, had Arnold’s wrists. Slowly
Arnold relaxed his hold.

  "There, now!” said Entrefort, sooth-
ingly; "that was a careless act and might
have broken the adhesion! You’ll have
to be careful.”

  Arnold looked at him with a curious
combination of expressions.

  "Doctor Entrefort,” he quietly re-
marked, "you are the devil.”

  Bowing profoundly, Entrefort replied:
"You do me too great.honor;” then he
whispered to his patient: "If you do
that”—with a motion toward the hilt—
"I will have her hanged for murder.”
Arnold started and choked, and a look
of horror overspread his face. He with-
drew his hands, took one of mine in both
of his, threw his arms upon the pillow
above his head, and, holding my hand,
firmly said to Entrefort:

  "Proceed with your work.”

  "Come closer, Hippolyte,” said Entre-
fort, "and observe narrowly. Will you
kindly assist me, Doctor Rowell?” That
gentleman had sat in wondering silence.

ENTRE fort’s hand was quick and
sure, and he used the knife with
marvelous dexterity. First he made four
equidistant incisions outward from the
guard and just through the skin. Arnold
held his breath and ground his teeth at
the first cut, but soon regained command
of himself. Each incision was about two
inches long. Hippolyte shuddered and
turned his head aside. Entrefort, whom
nothing escaped, exclaimed:

  "Steady, Hippolyte! Observe!”
Quickly was the skin peeled back to
the limit of the incisions. This must have
been excruciatingly painful. Arnold
280

WEIRD TALES

groaned, and his hands were moist and
cold. Down sank the knife into the flesh
from which the skin had been raised, and
blood flowed freely; Doctor Rowell
handled the sponge. The keen knife
worked rapidly. Arnold’s marvelous
nerve was breaking down. He clutched
my hand fiercely; his eyes danced; his
mind was weakening. Almost in a mo-
ment the flesh had been cut away to the
bones, which were now exposed—two
ribs and the sternum. A few quick cuts
cleared the weapon between the guard
and the ribs.

  "To work, Hippolyte—be quick!”

  The machinist had evidently been
coached before he came. With slender,
long-fingered hands, which trembled at
first, he selected certain tools with nice
precision, made some rapid measure-
ments of the weapon and of the cleared
space around it, and began to adjust the
pans of a queer little machine. Arnold
watched him curiously.

  "What-” he began to say; but he

ceased; a deeper pallor set on his face,
his hands relaxed, and his eyelids fell.

  "Thank God!” exclaimed Entrefort;
"he has fainted—he can’t stop us now.
Quick, Hippolyte!”

   The machinist attached the queer little
machine to the handle of the weapon,
seized the stiletto in his left hand, and
with his right began a series of sharp,
rapid movements backward and forward.
"Hurry, Hippolyte!” urged Entrefort.
"The metal is very hard.”

   "Is it cutting?”

   "I can’t see for the blood.”

  In another moment something snapped.
Hippolyte started; he was very nervous.
He removed the little machine.

   "The metal is very hard,” he said; "it
breaks the saws.”

  He adjusted another tiny saw and re-
sumed work. After a little while he
picked up the handle of the stiletto and
laid it on the table. He had cut it off,
leaving the blade inside Arnold’s body.

  "Good, Hippolyte!” exclaimed Entre-
fort. In a minute he had closed the
bright end of the blade from view by
drawing together the skin-flaps and sew-
ing them firmly.

  Arnold returned to consciousness and
glanced down at his breast. He seemed
puzzled. "Where is the weapon?” he
asked.

  "Here is part of it,” answered Entre-
fort, holding up the handle.

  "And the blade-”

  "That is an irremovable part of your
internal machinery.” Arnold was silent.
"It had to be cut off,” pursued Entrefort,
"not only because it would be trouble-
some and an undesirable ornament, but
also because it was advisable to remove
every possibility of its withdrawal.” Ar-
nold said nothing. "Here is a prescrip-
tion,” said Entrefort; "take the medicine
as directed for the next five years without
fail.”

  "What for? I see that it contains mu-
riatic acid.”

   "If necessary I will explain five years
from now.”

   "If I live.”

   "If you live.”

  Arnold drew me down to him and
whispered, "Tell her to fly at once; this
man may make trouble for her.”

  Was there ever a more generous fel-
low?

#	* # # # # #

I thought that I recognized a thin,
pale, bright face among the passen-
gers who were leaving an Australian
THE PERMANENT STILETTO

281

steamer which had just arrived at San
Francisco.

   "Doctor Entrefort!” I cried.

   "Ah!” he said, peering up into my face
and grasping my hand; "I know you now,
but you have changed. You remember
that I was called away immediately after
I had performed that crazy operation on
your friend. I have spent the interven-
ing four years in India, China, Tibet, Si-
beria, the South Seas, and God knows
where not. But wasn’t that a most
absurd, hare-brained experiment that I
tried on your friend! Still, it was all that
could have been done. I have dropped
all that nonsense long ago. It is better,
for more reasons than one, to let them
die at once. Poor fellow! he bore it so
bravely! Did he suffer much afterward?
How long did he live? A week—per-
haps a. month?”

   "He is alive yet.”

   "What!” exclaimed Entrefort, startled.
   "He is, indeed, and is in this city.”
   "Incredible!”

   "It is true; you shall see him.”

  "But tell me about him now!” cried
the surgeon, his eager eyes glittering with
the peculiar light which I had seen in
them on the night of the operation. "Has
he regularly taken the medicine which I
prescribed?”

  "He has. Well, the change in him,
from what he was before the operation, is
shocking. Imagine a young daredevil of
twenty-two, who had no greater fear of
danger or death than of a cold, now a
cringing, cowering fellow; apparently an
old man, nursing his life with pitiful
tenderness, fearful that at any moment
something may happen to break the hold
of his aorta-walls on the stiletto-blade; a
confirmed hypochondriac, peevish, mel-
ancholic, unhappy in the extreme. He

keeps himself confined as closely as pos-
sible, avoiding all excitement and exer-
cise, and even reads nothing exciting.
The constant danger has worn out the
last shred of his manhood and left him
a pitiful wreck. Can nothing be done for
him?”

  "Possibly. But has he consulted no
physician?”

  "None whatever; he has been afraid

                              \ 7

that he might learn the worst.”

  "Let us find him at once. Ah, here
comes my wife to meet me! She arrived
by the other steamer.” „

  I recognized her immediately and was
overcome with astonishment.

  "Charming woman,” said Entrefort;
"you'll like her. We were married three
years ago at Bombay. She belongs to a
noble Italian family and has travelled a
great deal.”

  He introduced us. To my unspeak-
able relief she remembered neither my
name nor my face. I must have appeared
odd to her, but it was impossible for me
to be perfectly unconcerned. We went
to Arnold's rooms, I with much dread.
I left her in the reception room and took
Entrefort within. Arnold was too great-
ly absorbed in his own troubles to be
dangerously excited by meeting Entre-
fort, whom he greeted with indifferent
hospitality.

  "But I heard a woman’s voice,” he
said. "It sounds-” He checked him-
self, and before I could intercept him he
had gone to the reception room; and there
he stood face to face with the beautiful
adventuress—none other than Entrefort's
wife now—who, wickedly desperate, had
driven a stiletto into Arnold’s vitals in a
hotel four years before because he had
refused to marry her. They recognized
each other instantly and both grew pale;
282

but she, quicker witted, recovered her
composure at once and advanced toward
him with a smile and an extended hand.
He stepped back, his face ghastly with
fear.

  "Oh!” he gasped, "the excitement, the
shock—it has made the blade slip out!
The blood is pouring from the opening
—it burns—I am dying!” and he fell
into my arms and instantly expired.

  The autopsy revealed the surprizing
fact that there was no blade in his thorax

at all; it had been gradually consumed
by the muriatic acid which Entrefort had
prescribed for that very purpose, and the
perforations in the aorta had closed up
gradually with the wasting of the blade
and had been perfectly healed for a long
time. All his vital organs were sound.
My poor friend, once so reckless and
brave, had died simply of a childish and
groundless fear, and the woman unwit-
tingly had accomplished her revenge.

The Curse of Ximu-tal

               (Continued from page 161)

tains—and knoiv that you were not alone?
Eh? That was the way it was with me.
1 wasn't alone! Not any longer. Some-
where in the shadows just out of reach
of my torch it was waiting for me. I knew.

  "And all at once it came to me that the
room was no longer still. I didn’t know
what it was. It sounded like the slow
running back of a wave over the pebbles.
It was a sound that went with the smell
of the place; a Sound that whispered with
the voice of all the evil of thousands and
thousands of years.

  "The sound was all around me, coming
in from the dark shadows of the walls. I
blew my torch into flame, half burned as
it was, and held it high over my head,
sparks dropping down on me like rain.

  "And I saw it. All about the room,
flowing over the stone floor like a green
river, was the body of a snake. I tell you,
sir, that snake was old. Big as my leg, it
was; thickening and pulsing and length-
ening out; tightening and drawing closer
in to the coffin of Ximu-tal, and me; mak-

ing a coil all the way around that room.
I didn’t see the snake’s head at first, off
in the shadows; just that thick green
cable of a body as it pulsed and flowed.

  "I was weak as water. I knew I was
done, finished. I knew that Ximu-tal’s
snake was going to crush me against that
stone coffin, just as he had crushed the
other white man. I knew that my bones
were going to join his there on the floor
of the great room—when the snake was
done. Just like that other white man—
only there wasn’t any mozo with me to
carry my canteen and gun back to his hut.

  "I hadn’t thought of that gun before.
I wouldn’t have had the guts to get it out
now, but my fingers were on that bit of
jade in my pocket, that fighting elephant.
It was like it was whispering to me, tell-
ing me to fight. I got the heavy gun in
my hand. The snake was close now, the
green folds two deep all around where I
stood backed up against old Ximu-tal’s
coffin.
WEIRD TALES

  "And then I saw the head. Floating in
the air it was, that head, just like the
carved head in the chamber above. Close.
The jaws were open, and I could see that
fiery patch of red in its throat, eyes of
jade above. Fire and ice, and both wicked
as hell.

“T shot, five times I shot, straight at
A that hungry, flaming throat. I hit it,
too. God, die anger of that snake! Writh-
ing, smashing, swinging—I tell you, sir, I
don’t know how I got away. Ximu-tal’s
coffin went over, wrecked, with a crash
that shook the stone floor under my feet.
Something splintered like breaking glass,
and a green spark flashed by me, the
broken head of the jade snake. Even
then I felt bad to think of that beautiful
jade carving all broken and smashed.

  "I was in the passage, Ximu-tal’s great
snake coming after me, blood dripping
from its angry jaws. The gun was empty.
The trigger clicked once, twice, on the
empty chamber, and I threw the gun at
that bloody head. I had nothing else;
nothing but the stub of my burned-out
torch. And I threw that back as I ran;
threw it back like a crimson ribbon down
the black passage.

  "All the long way up I could hear
Ximu-tal’s snake coming, like the flowing
of water over pebbles. And I ran. God,
how I ran! I threw off my coat, my gun
belt. I tell you, sir, I was afraid as I
never had been afraid before.

  "I ran. Up through the dark, up into
that chamber with the carved snake of
Ximu-tal running about it, the carved
head ready to strike. I thought it would
strike. I could not stir the carven stone
of the floor. I ran on, feeling with my
hands along the wall for that blessed way
out, finding it, and scrambling up the dug
passage, bumping my head, stumbling;

The

INVISIBLE BOND

By ARLTON EADIE

Daek and mysterious deeds are
done on the West Coast of Af-
rica, where voodoo rites are a com-
monplace and occult mysteries are
matters of everyday life.

A strange story of wild horror
was told by the man who was
picked up in an open boat in the
coppery haze of an African dawn
—the story of the white girl who
leaped and pranced like a glorified
dancing Venus in the savage and
hideous rites of the Red Drinkers.
A gripping tale of wild adventure,
this is a goose-flesh story to chill
the blood of the reader. It will be

all the time hearing behind me the dread-
ful flowing of the angry snake.

   "I tell you, sir, I was desperate. It was
terrible; the soft, pressing darkness that
held me back as I ran, and behind me,
closer and closer, the coming of that
great green snake of Ximu-tal’s. All this
time I had in my hand that tiny piece of
jade, the carven elephant fighting the
serpent. I did not know that I held it. I
do not know, sir, how it found its way to
my fingers, but I held it. And now I
turned and threw it. I threw it with all
my strength into the thick darkness where
the old priest’s snake was coming.

  "It was then my shoulder in the dark-
ness hit the stake that other man had put
in the passage to prop up the rock in the
roof. I struck it, and knocked it down
with the weight of my body.. I was run-
ning, and I was afraid, and I hit it hard.

The stake came down, and I fell over it.

  "Behind me, just at my feet, the big
rock fell down from the roof; and like
water the little rocks and sand flowed
after it, faster and faster. The sand
poured over my feet as I lay there,
trembling.

  "No, sir, I do not know how I got out
of there. I do not know how I got out of
that dead city where warfare had been
between Ximu-tal of the snake, and the
priests of the elephant. I do not know
how long I wandered in the jungle until
I came to the plantation. They did not
believe me when I told of the snake—of
the two snakes—of Ximu-tal.

   "Jade is an evil thing. I tell you, sir, it
holds all the wickedness of all the ages
since it was made in the furnaces of those
evil priests of the lost Atlantis. But I’d
like to see that great carved piece again.”

The Hills of the Dead

             '(Continued from page 173)

strife. He halted, frozen. Down the
slope the black horde was fleeing and
over their heads and close at their shoul-
ders flew huge vultures, tearing and
rending avidly, sinking their beaks in the
dead black flesh, devouring the vampires
as they fled.

  Kane laughed, almost insanely.

  "Defy man and God, but you may not
deceive the vultures, sons of Satan! They
know whether a man be alive or dead!”

  N’Longa stood like a prophet on the
pinnacle and the great black birds soared
and wheeled about him. His arms still
waved and his voice still wailed out
across the hills. And over the skylines
they came, hordes on endless hordes—
vultures, vultures, vultures! come to the

feast so long denied them. They black-
ened the sky with their numbers, blotted
out the sun; a strange darkness fell on
the land. They settled in long dusky
lines, diving into the caverns with a whir
of wings and a clash of beaks. Their
talons tore at the black horrors which
these caves disgorged.

  Now all the vampires were fleeing to
their city. The vengeance held back for
ages had come down on them and their
last hope was the heavy walls which had
kept back the desperate human foes.
Under those crumbling roofs they might
find shelter. And N’Longa watched them
stream into the city, and he laughed until
the crags re-echoed.

  Now all were in and the birds settled
WEIRD TALES

like a cloud over the doomed city, perch-
ing in solid rows along the walls, sharp-
ening their, beaks and claws on the
towers.

. And N’Longa struck flint and steel to a
bundle of dry leaves he had brought with
him. The bundle leaped into instant
flame and he straightened and flung the
blazing thing far out over the cliffs. It
fell like a meteor to the plateau beneath,
showering sparks. The tall grass of the
plateau leaped aflame.

  From the silent city beneath them Fear
flowed in unseen waves, like a white fog.
Kane smiled grimly.

  "The grass is sere and brittle from the
drouth,” he said; "there has been even
less rain than usual this season; it will
hum swiftly.”

  Like a crimson serpent the fire ran
through the high dead grass. It spread
and it spread and Kane, standing high
above, yet felt the fearful intensity of the
hundreds of red eyes which watched from
the stone city.

  Now the scarlet snake had reached the
walls and was rearing as if to coil and
writhe over them. The vultures rose on
heavily flapping wings and soared re-
luctantly. A vagrant gust of wind
whipped the blaze about and drove it in
a long red sheet around the wall. Now
the city was hemmed in on all sides by
a solid barricade of flame. The roar came
up to the two men on the high crag.

  Sparks flew across the wall, lighting in
the high grass in the streets. A score of
flames leaped up and grew with terrifying
speed. A veil of red cloaked streets and
buildings, and through this crimson,
whirling mist Kane and N’Longa saw
hundreds of black shapes scamper and
writhe, to vanish suddenly in red bursts
of flame. There rose an intolerable scent
of decayed flesh burning.

WEIRD TALES

  Kane gazed, awed. This was truly a
hell on earth. As in a nightmare he
looked into the roaring red cauldron
where black inseas fought against their
doom and perished. The flames leaped a
hundred feet in air, and suddenly above
their roar sounded one bestial, inhuman
scream like a shriek from across nameless
gulfs of cosmic space, as one vampire,
dying, broke the chains of silence which
had held him for untold centuries. High
and haunting it rose, the death cry of a
vanishing race.

  Then the flames dropped suddenly.
The conflagration had been a typical grass
fire, short and fierce. Now the plateau
showed a blackened expanse and the city
a charred and smoking mass of crumbling
stone. Not one corpse lay in view, not
even a charred bone. Above all whirled
the dark swarms of the vultures, but they,
too, were beginning to scatter.

  Kane gazed hungrily at the clean blue
sky. Like a strong sea wind clearing a
fog of horror was the sight to him. From
somewhere sounded the faint and far-off
roaring of a distant lion. The vultures
were flapping away in black, straggling
lines.

                        *

5. Palaver Set!

Kane sat in the mouth of the cave
. where Zunna lay, submitting to the
fetish-man’s bandaging.

  The Puritan’s garments hung in tatters
about his frame; his limbs and breast
were deeply gashed and darkly bruised,
but he had had no mortal wound in that
deathly fight on the cliff.

  "Mighty men, we be!” declared
N’Longa with deep approval. "Vampire
city be silent now, sure ’nough! No walk-
ing dead man live along these hills.”

  "I do not understand,” said Kane,

resting chin on hand. "Tell me, N’Longa,
how have you done things? How talked
you with me in my dreams; how came
you into the body of Kran; and how sum-
moned you the vultures?”

  "My blood-brother,” said N’Longa,
discarding his pride in his pidgin Eng-
lish, to drop into the river language un-
derstood by Kane, "I am so old that you
would call me a liar if I told you my age.
All my life I have worked magic, sitting
first at the feet of mighty ju-ju men of
the south and the east; then I was a slave
to the Buckra — the white man — and
learned more. My brother, shall I span
all these years in a moment and make
you understand with a word, what has
taken me so long to learn? I could not
even make you understand how these
vampires have kept their bodies from de-
cay by drinking the lives of men.

  "I sleep and my spirit goes Out over
the jungle and the rivers to talk with die
sleeping spirits of my friends. There is
a mighty magic on the voodoo staff I
gave you—a magic out of the Old Land
which draws my ghost to it as a white
man’s magnet draws metal.”

  Kane listened unspeaking, seeing for
the first time in N’Longa’s glittering eyes
something stronger and deeper than,the
avid gleam of the worker in black magic.
To Kane it seemed almost as if he looked
into the far-seeing and mystic eyes of a
prophet of old.

  "I spoke to you in dreams,” N’Longa
went on, "and I made a deep sleep come
over the souls of Kran and of Zunna,
and remove them to a far dim land,
whence they shall soon return, unremem-
bering. All things bow to magic, blood-
brother, and beasts and birds obey the
master words. I worked strong voodoo,
vulture-magic, and the flying people of
the air gathered at my call.
WEIRD TALES

   "These things I know and am a part of,
 but how shall I tell you of them? Blood-
 brother, you are a mighty warrior, but in
 >the ways of magic you are as a little child
 lost. And what has taken me long dark
 years to know, I may not divulge to you
 so you would understand. My friend,
 you think only of bad spirits, but were
 my magic always bad, should I not take
 this fine young body in place of my old
 wrinkled one and keep it? But Kran
 shall have his body back safely.

   "Keep the voodoo staff, blood brother.
 It has mighty power against all sorcerers
 and serpents and evil things. Now I re-
 turn to the village on the Coast where my
 true body sleeps. And what of you, my
 blood-brother?”

   Kane pointed silently eastward.

   "The call grows no weaker. I go.”
 N’Longa nodded, held out his hand.
 Kane grasped it. The mystical expression
 had gone from the dusky face and the
 eyes twinkled snakily with a sort of rep-
 tilian mirth.

   "Me go now, blood-brother,” said the
 fetish-man, returning to his beloved jar-
 gon, of which knowledge he was prouder
 than all his conjuring tricks. "You take
 care—that one fellow jungle, she pluck
 your bones yet! Remember that voodoo
 stave, brother. Ai ya, palaver set!”

   He fell back on the sand, and Kane
 - saw the keen sly expression of N’Longa
 fading from the face of Kran. His flesh
 crawled again. Somewhere back on the
 Slave Coast, the body of N’Longa, with-
 ered and wrinkled, was stirring in the
 ju-ju hut, was rising as if from a deep
 sleep. Kane shuddered.

   Kran sat up, yawned, stretched and
 smiled. Beside him the girl Zunna rose,
 rubbing her eyes.

   "Master,” said Kran apologetically,
 "we must have slumbered.”

stumbled away from the buildings and
down toward the island’s shore thin curls
of smoke lifted from the two structures.
They reached the shore of the island, op
posite that where Russell had first landed,,
and there was the long boathouse with
still upon its door the lock that Garland j
had placed there. They crashed into
It, and in moments had the cabin-boat out
and heading with noisy motor away from
the island.

   Clouds of dark smoke were lifting sky
ward from the island’s higher center as
the flames ate the two buildings there.
The sunset’s level rays struck in vain
against their black and billowing masses.
Snelling held the boat westward away
from the island, Lowerman and Hall and
Johnson sprawled in its cockpit. Wallace
pointed back with unsteady hand to the
lifting smoke-clouds as he and Russell
gazed.

  "There never were any of Garland’s
compounds—never any pigmies that he
made with them from men,” he said.
"Never anything but an accidental ere
that caught Garland. You understand?”

  Russell nodded weakly. "Better so,"
he whispered. "Better that the world
hear it so-”

  He crouched with Wallace, looking
back still. The island was dropping be-
hind, vanishing in the waters, but the
smoke from- it rose visible still into the
heavens like a great black column, an
enormous sign. Their eyes could mark
it still, though the island itself had
passed from sight. Snelling, though, had
not turned, had not looked, heading die
boat straight onward into the setting sun.

Splashes of

Chinese Color

ACCLAIMED BY CRITICS THROUGHOUT THE WORLD

New York Times: “Fanciful, touched by the super-
natural, exotic in thought and coloring. Flowers,
poems, music and jade are interwoven with their
themes and the effect is often both quaint and charm-
ing.”

The China Weekly Review, Shanghai, China: “Re-
veals a true sense of gentleness, the heart of a dream-
er, a deep sense of rhythm and beauty. He sees China
and the Chinese through misty, naive, sometimes
philosophic eyes.”

Honolulu Star-Bulletin, Honolulu, Hawaii: “They are
strange and glowing tales of an unearthly beauty.
Their scenes are laid in China but they might be any-
where. They are essentially a part of the history of
those lost lands where Dunsany’s heroes live and die
magnificently and where Walter de la Mare’s dark
travelers knock vainly at mysterious moonlit doors.”

Daily Argus Leader, Sioux Falls, S. D.: “This is a
collection to be read, laid down and read again.”

Wilmington Every Evening, Wilmington, Del.: “De-
serves a place among one’s favorite books.”

Ohio State Journal, Columbus, Ohio: "There is some
weirdness here, some mystery and some tender pas-
sages, enough of each to make a superlative ensemble
that won for this author a secure place in the field of
Far East fiction.”

Radio Station KDKA, Pittsburgh: “For those who are
interested in Chinese literature and traditions, we be-
lieve this book will find a cordial welcome. A very
beautiful book.”

The Globe, Toronto, Ont.: “Dealing with curious
phases of Chinese life, they are imaginative, colorful
and replete with poetry. For the first of Uteae quali-
ties they might be likened to some of the creations of
Edgar Allan Poe. bat even the weirdest of them pos-
sess a tenderness to which Poe -was a stranger.”
Arizona Republican, Phoenix, Ariz.: “It is not often
that such a book, as deserving of praise and as full of
real literary merit as “The Wind That Tramps the
World,” comes our way. This sounds like effusiveness,
but it isn’t. It’s merely giving credit for a real liter-
ary achievement. . . . They are masterpieces of a
rich imagination, deep and gripping in their beauty
and romance.”
