Do Ybu Smile at the Idea
of Learning Music by Mail?

  Here Are Some Facts That May Surprise You /

YOO HAVE undoubtedly heard of the 17. S. School
method of teaching music by mail. This remark-
able system of Instruction has been in operation for
over forty years and more than 700,000 people in
nil parts of the world have eprolled for it. Men,
women and children of all ages and from all walks of
life have taken up their favorite musical instruments
this convenient, money-saving way. They have
studied the piano, violin, guitar, accordion and, in
short, every kind of popular Instrument.

          No Special Talent Required
Many of those pupils did not know one musical note
from another when they enrolled. Many had previ.
ously tried other methods of instruction without
success. And not a few were frankly skeptical. They
doubted whether it was possible to learn music by
mail. just as you may doubt it.

 To some of these "Doubting Thomases" it came as
the surprise of tlielr lives when they actually heard
themselves playing. Simple popular melodies at first,
then more and more advanced pieces, all the way to
Grand Opera.

 One after another, pupils testify to the amazing
ease with which they learned, and the fascination and
pleasure they found In the Ipssons. They say It was
'•easy as A. B. C."—"so simple that a child could
understand"—thnt “with all the wonderful photo-
graphs and diagrams to guide you. you simply cannot
go wrong”—that “it's really fun to learn music this
easy, fascinating wny.”

Will You Accept This Challenge?

The experience of thousands upon thousands of peo-
ple should be proof positive that you. too. can learn
to nlny your favorite instrument by the famous print-
and-pioture method of the U. S. School of Music. Is
it not a pity, then, to deny yourself all the enjoyment,
the good times arid popularity that music offers? Do
you not owe it to yourself, at least, to examine all

 the facts, and to decide, once and for all, whether you
 can afford to pass by this opportunity to enrich your
 life with music?

    If you really »int lo plas a musical instrument—If you are willing
  to devote Just a few minutes a day to Itamlns, not through tedious,
  old-fashioned practice, but by actually playing real tuues. then you
  should mall the coupon at once. It will brins you an Interostln?
  illustrated booklet that tells all about this wonderful nay to learn
  music at home—without any special talent—without any previous

TOMORROW'S WOHIDS
By Edmond Hamilton

Author of “The Three Planeteers,”

This Month's Scientifiction Novel

THERE would be no purpose in writing
any more about myself. I told All, in
the sketch that was published in the
May STARTLING STORIES.

  So instead of talking about myself. I’d
like to talk a little atout THE THREE
PLANETEERS.

  A very common supposition in science-
fiction seems to be that when interplanetary
travel is finally achieved, and there are popu-
lations of colonizing Earthmen on the other
worlds, they will all be ruled by the same
government and law, and that war and strife
will be forgotten.

  Now, I never could see that as inevitable.
In fact, it always seemed more reasonable
to me to suppose that every world would
have its own government. And here’s why:

  Just think of what an effect distance has
right here on Earth. Englishmen migrate
to America—and a century or so later they
find they just can’t get along with the parent
country any more, and declare their inde-
pendence. The same thing happens to the
Spaniards who colonized South and Central
America. It’s happening right now to South
Africa and Australia.

  Now, if that is true right now on Earth,
surely it will be even more true in the fu-
ture in the Solar System! Think of yourself,
a few hundred years from now, on Mars.
Your father was bom on Mars, and your
grandfather. You know that several gen-
erations back one of your ancestors came
here from Earth, but you don’t feel any
loyalty to Earth. Mars is your world.

  And yet here you are, with a government
on Earth making the laws bv which you
live. Those Earth people dont know Mar-
tian conditions, and don’t know what is or
is not practical out here on your world.

  What would you do, in a situation like
that? If precedent or history mean any-
thing, ten to one you’d shine up your trusty
alom-gun and go out with a lot of your
fellow Martians to win your independence
from Earth. And the chances are that you'd
win it.

  And in the centuries that followed, your
descendants would be more and more true
Martians, wouldn’t they? They’d be modi-
fied by generations of life in a new environ-
ment. The people of the different worlds, all
of the same Earth stock, would grow more
and more unlike each other. If they couldn't
settle their differences they'd go to war.

  That’s the speculative background of THE
THREE PLANETEERS. But it isn't any
history of the future. It’s a story. I hope
it’s a good story.

THEY sauntered through the
crowded, kryptonlit street bor-
dering the great New York
spaceport, casually, as though there
was not a reward on their heads. An
Earthman, a Venusian, and a huge
Mercurian, looking merely like three
ordinary space-sailors in their soiled,
drab jackets and trousers.

But inwardly John Thorn, the lean,
dark-headed Earthman of the trio, was
queerly tense. He felt the warning
of that sixth sense which tells of
being watched. His brown, hard-
chinned face showed nothing of what
he felt, and he was smiling as though
telling some joke as he spoke to his
two companions.

  “We’re being followed,” he said.
“I’ve felt it, since we left the space-
port. I don’t know who it is.”

 13
14

STARTLING STORIES

  Sual Av, the bald, bow-legged
Venusian, laughed merrily as though
at a jest. His bright green eyes glis-
tened, and there was a wide grin on
his ugly, froglike face.

  “The police?” he chuckled.

  Gunner Welk, the huge Mercurian,
growled in his throat. His shock of
yellow hair seemed to bristle on his
head, his massive face and cold blue
eyes hardening belligerently.

  “How in hell’s name would the
Earth police spot us so quickly after
our arrival?” he muttered.

  “I don’t think it’s the police,” John
Thorn said, his black eyes still smil-
ing casually. “Stop at this next cor-
ner, and we'll see who passes us.”

T the corner gleamed a luminous
red sign, “THE CLUB OF
WEARY SPACEMEN.” In and out
of the vibration-joint thus benevolent-
ly named were streaming dozens of
the motley throng that jammed the
blue-lit street. Reedy-looking red
Martians, squat and surly Jovians,
hard-bitten Earthmen — sailors from
all the eight inhabited worlds, spewed
up by the great spaceport nearby.
There were many naval officers and
men, too — a few in the crimson of
Mars, the green of Venus and blue of
Mercury, but most of them in the gray
uniform of the Earth Navy.

  John Thorn and his two comrades
paused on the corner as though debat-
ing whether or not to enter the vibra-
tion-joint. Inwardly, Thorn was taut-
ly alert to everyone who passed in the
shuffling throngs. Every moment, his
sense of peril grew greater. He was
now certain that they were being
watched from close at hand.

  Sual Av suddenly grinned. “Look
at that, John. It’s a new one.”

  The Venusian nodded his bald head
toward the corner of the chromaloy
building, which was plastered with ad-
vertisements and official notices.
Among them was a bright new poster.

WANTED—THE THREE
PLANETEERS

  Reward of one million dollars offered by
the Earth Police for any information lead-
ing to the arrest of the outlaws known as
the Three Planeteera.

  Sual Av’s green eyes gleamed with
droll humor in his froglike face.

  “They’ve raised the price on us,
John. We ought to feel flattered.”
Gunner Welk was reading the rest
of the notice in a low, rumbling voice.

  “The identities and descriptions of
the Three Planeteers follow: John
Thorn, Earthman, twenty-eight years
old, deserter from the Earth Navy—"
“That’s enough,” Sual Av chuckled.
“The rest is just a long list of our
heinous exploits.”

  John Thorn took a long, green cig-
arette of Martian rial leaf from his
pocket and scratched its tip against
the wall, thus igniting it. As he puffed
on it, Thorn spoke under his breath.

  “Get ready, boys—here comes our
shadow if my guess is right.”

  Neither the grinning, bald Venusian
nor the big Mercurian changed ex-
pression. But their hands casually
dropped to the side of their jackets,
where atom-pistols bulged their pock-
ets.

  A man in the gray uniform of a non-
com of the Earth Navy was shoulder-
ing toward them out of the passing
throng. He was a middle-aged man
with a flat, grizzled face.

  “Can you spare a smoke, sailor?” he
asked Thorn.

  “Of course," John Thorn answered
calmly, and fished one of the green
cigarettes from his pocket. He kept
his face bent as he handed it over.

  “Thanks,” muttered the man, and
was gone in the throng.

  “A false alarm, after all,” grunted
Gunner Welk.

  “No,” clipped Thorn. “I know that
man. He was one of my non-coms be-
fore I deserted the Navy. He knows
I’m John Thorn, which means that he
knows we’re the Planeteers. He’s
gone for the police.”

 Thorn’s gaze swiveled rapidly.
Then he pushed his companions to-
ward the swinging door of the vibra-
tion-joint.

  “In here!" he exclaimed. “We can
go out another door.”

HRUMMING music hit John
Thorn and his comrades in the
faces as they entered the place. It
Sual Av

John Thorn

was a big metal-walled room, clogged
with green smoke. Men at tables in
the center were arguing in bull voices
as they drank black Venusian wine or
brown Earth whisky. In the booths
around the walls, many more men
sprawled somnolent, sleepy faces re-
laxed under the pale violet rays of the
brain-soothing “happiness vibrations."

 Thorn’s lean figure shouldered
through the noisy, crowded tables, the
bald-pated Venusian and the towering
Mercurian following closely. They
were half-way across the crowded
place toward the back door, when
there was a rush of feet through the
front entrance.

 Thorn twisted his head. Two men
in the white uniform of the Earth
Police had just burst in. With them
was the grizzled non-com. The latter
instantly pointed at Thorn and his
two companions.

  “There they are!” he yelled. “The
Three Planeteers!”

  For a moment, the noisy throng in
the place was petrified. Even that
motley, hard-bitten crowd was frozen
by the sudden declaration that there
in their midst stood the three half-
legendary interplanetary outlaws.

 Then the foremost of the two po-

licemen, drawing his atom pistol,
yelled to Thorn.

  “Stand where you are!”

  Thorn’s pistol was already in his
hand, as was the big Mercurian’s.

  “The lights, Gunner!” Thorn cried.

  At the same moment, Thorn shot up
toward the ceiling with the quickness
of a wolf’s snap.

  The pellets from his and the Mercu-
rian’s pistols hit the big cluster of
krypton lights in the ceiling. The
flare of white proton fire from the ex-
ploding pellets was followed by an
abrupt extinguishing of the lights.
The place was plunged in darkness ex-
cept for the faint blue glow of the
“happiness vibration” booths.

  Scores of voices yelled in the dark-
ness, and shadowy figures surged for-
ward in a melee of reeling, clutching
shapes. Some shouted for lights,
others to guard the door. Everyone
in the room had suddenly remembered
the big reward for the capture of the
Planeteers.

  “This way,” chuckled Sual Av’s
throaty voice in the darkness. The
Venusian was stolidly clearing a path
through the crowd.

  Men sought to hold the three in the
darkness, cried out that they were es-

 15

STARTLING STORIES

caping. Gunner Welk's huge fists
thudded down in resounding blows,
while Thorn struck with the heavy
barrel of his atom-pistol.

  Suddenly Sual Av was pulling them
out of the shadowy riot, through a
door. They stumbled out into an un-
lighted alley. As they did so, they
heard the whiz and roar of rocket-
cars racing up to the front entrance
of the Club of Weary Spacemen.

  “Police,” grunted Gunner Welk.
“They’ll be around here in a minute.”

  “Come on!” cried Thorn, starting
down the dark alley in a run. “We’re
all right now if we keep clear of spy-
plates.”

  “Yes,” came the Venusian’s chuckle
as he ran beside them. “The last place
they’ll look for the Planeteers is the
mansion of the Chairman!”

A HALF-HOUR later, the three
comrades were two miles across
the city from the spaceport, having
threaded devious ways to avoid the
omnipresent spy-plates of the police.

  “Spy-plates” were televisor eyes
mounted throughout the city, some
openly but many more cunningly con-
cealed. by which police headquarters
could keep watch on all parts of the
metropolis.

  The Planeteers entered the deep
shadow of tall trees that bordered ex-
tensive grounds. Through the trees
glimmered the lighted windows of a
magnificent metal mansion. The three
comrades moved soundlessly as phan-
toms toward it.

  The mansion was the official resi-
dence of the Chairman of the Earth
Government. It was on a scale com-
mensurate with the dignity of the
elected executive of the planet. The
huge tower that housed the Earth
Government itself soared into the
starlight from a great park nearby.

  The Planeteers met no guards as
they slipped cautiously toward the
rear of the impressive mansion. There
was a broad terrace here, splashed
with blue-white light from a single
window. John Thorn and his com-
rades stole up onto the terrace toward
that window.

 Thorn peered tautly into the

lighted room. It was a small, paneled
study. The only furniture was a big
desk which lay in the blue-white pool
of a krypton lamp. A gray-haired
man sat at this desk, writing.

  “It’s the Chairman,” Thorn whis-
pered. “And he’s alone.”

 “Good,” muttered Gunner Welk.
“That makes it easier.”

  Thorn gently reached and pushed
on the window. It was unlocked, and
swung inward on soundless hinges.
He stepped silently in upon the soft
rug, and Sual Av and Gunner Welk
followed as noiselessly.

 The man at the desk suddenly
looked up. His haggard, aging face
stiffened as he beheld, ten feet from
him, the three silent men—the lean,
browned young Earthman, the bald,
bow-legged Venusian. and the tower-
ing, hard-faced Mercurian.

  “The Planeteers!” exclaimed the
Chairman, rising to his feet. “Thank
God, you’re here!”

CHAPTER II
Cold-World Menace

THE career of the Three Plane-
teers had begun four years previ-
ously, in 2952.

  That year had seen the splitting of
the eight i.idependent inhabited
worlds of the Solar System into two
hostile alliances. The great and pow-
erful League of Cold Worlds had been
formed by Jupiter, Saturn. Uranus
and Neptune, under a ruthless, ambi-
tious dictator. Feeling themselves
menaced, Mercury, Venus, Earth and
Mars had formed the Inner Alliance.
The Alliance had sent out many spies
to gain information of the League's
threatening plans, but nearly all of
them had rapidly been detected and
executed.

  Then John Thorn, captain in the
Earth Navy, had conceived his patri-
otic plan. He and two friends, Sual
Av, Venusian engineer, and Gunner
Welk, Mercurian adventurer, would
go forth into the underworld of the
system as outlaws. And as fugitives
THE THREE PLANETEERS

17

from the law, they would never be sus-
pected of being agents of the Alliance.

  The three friends had deliberately
established criminal records. Thorn
had deserted from the Earth Navy.
Sual Av had fled after supposedly em-
bezzling a great sum—a sum which
was being secretly held in trust for its
rightful owners. Gunner Welk had
broken jail after a brawl on Mercury.

  The three fugitive friends had fore-
gathered, and thus had been born the
three Planeteers. They had per-
formed one daring exploit after an-
other. Each time, their exploits
seemed mere criminal raids or rob-
beries. Yet each time, their real pur-
pose had been the securing of infor-
mation as to the purposes and plans
of the hostile, threatening League of
Cold Worlds.

  Now, the Three Planeteers were the
most famous outlaws in the system.
Three lone wolves of the void, extrav-
agantly admired by all criminals and
pirates, bitterly condemned by all
law-abiding men. Only one man—the
Chairman of the Earth Government—
knew that the notorious Planeteers
were really undercover spies.

  Now that man, Richard Hoskins,
faced the three comrades with glad-
ness in his eyes. His powerful face,
deeply lined by strain of responsibil-
ity, quiverted with emotion.

  “Thank God, you’re here!” he re-
peated. “It’s been days since I sent
out that call to you on the secre' au-
dio-wave. I was beginning to fear
something had happened to you.”

  “We were almost picked up by the
Earth Police tonight, sir," John
Thorn said quietly. “I was recog-
nized.”

  The Chairman hastily closed the
metal shutter of the window. There
was a look of deep anxiety in his hag-
gard eyes.

  “Thorn, I knew I was summoning
you three into danger when I called
you here. But I had to do it, for
I’ve something to tell you which I
dared not trust even to the secret
wave. Something upon which the
fate of the whole Inner Alliance may
depend!

  “But first, what can you report?”

the Chairman asked tensely. “The
League is still preparing to attack

us?”

  Thorn nodded tightly. “Yes, sir.
Every dock and arsenal from Jupiter
to Neptune is humming with activity.
The League will have at least ten
thousand cruisers ready in a few
weeks, the story goes. They’re work-
ing their mining bases out on Pluto
at full capacity, digging fuel ores.
And there’s a rumor that they’ve
planned some new and terrible agent
of destruction with which they will
blast our worlds into submission, after
they’ve smashed our fleet!

  “Furthermore,” Thorn added, “the
League dictator, Haskell Trask, is
constantly broadcasting inflammatory
speeches to his four worlds. He’s
stirring up their war fever to frenzy,
telling them that since the worlds of
the Inner Alliance refuse to cede any
territory, it must be taken from them
by force.”

CHAIRMAN HOSKINS nodded
somberly. “I’ve heard Trask’s
broadcast speeches. It’s that cursed
power-lusting dictator who’s driving
the system toward war. If we’d only
recognized sooner what a menace he
is, we wouldn’t have let the League
get so far ahead of us in armaments.
As it is, when their attack comes,
they’ll outnumber our combined,
navies by two to one. They’ll over-
whelm our fleet, unless—”

  “Unless what, sir?” Thorn asked
tensely.

  “Unless we can use a new weapon
we have,” the Chairman finished. “A
weapon such as the system never
heard of before.”

  He paced the little study for a few
moments, and then turned back to the
rigidly watching Planeteers.

  “You’ve heard of Philip Blaine, our
famous Earth physicist?’’ he asked.

  Sual Av’s bald head bobbed. “I
have, sir. He disappeared, a year ago.
No one knows where he is now.”
“Blaine,” said the Chairman, “i6 in
Earth’s moon. For a year, he’s been
working in secret laboratories in the
lunar caverns. He’s developed a radi-
cal, revolutionary new weapon. I dare
18

not tell even you the nature of that
weapon. But it will enable us to de-
feat the overpowering attack of the
League fleet—if we can use it!”

  “If we can use it, sir?” puzzled Gun-
ner Welk.

  “Yes. For Blaine’s weapon is use-
less, as it stands now. To operate the
thing requires concentrated power of
incredible volume. Atomic energy
from ordinary fuels is insufficient.
The only fuel that will furnish
enough atomic energy to operate this
thing is radite, that rare isotope of ra-
dium. To make use of Blaine’s great
weapon, we must have a ton of pure
radite.”

  “A ton of pure radite?” exclaimed
Thorn incredulously. “Why, not one
of the eight worlds has more than a
few pounds of the stuff! It takes
thousands of tons of ore to yield an
ounce!”

  “There is a ton of pure radite in the
system,” the Chairman affirmed. “But
it’s not on any of the eight inhabited
worlds.”

  “It can’t be on Pluto, surely,” pro-
tested Sual Av. “The League mining
bases there would have found it long
ago.”

  “It’s farther than Pluto,” the Chair-
man said.

  John Thorn stared. “You mean, it's
on Erebus?”

 The Chairman nodded slowly.
“Yes, it’s on Erebus, the tenth and out-
ermost planet, that mysterious, unex-
plored world that swings out there in
space a billion miles beyond even
Pluto’s orbit.”

  “How can anyone know the radite’s
there?” Gunner Welk demanded un-
believingly. “Why, no one knows
what’s on Erebus! Not one of the ex-
peditions that sailed for that planet
ever came back. For centuries, no one
has even tried to explore that mystery
world!”

  “Years ago,” the Chairman said, “as-
tronomers detected the presence of a
mass of pure radite on Erebus,
through their spectroscopes. Super-
valuable as radite is, no one has tried
to go after it, for all know it’s suicide
to try to visit Erebus.”

  The Chairman’s lined face quivered.

“But now we’ve got to have that ra-
dite! It alone will operate Blaine's
new secret weapon. It alone will en-
able us to resist the League’s attack,
and preserve the liberty of these four
inner worlds.”

HE looked at the three comrades
solemnly. “We have sent five
big secret expeditions to Erebus dur-
ing the last year, in desperate hope of
getting the radite. Not one ship, not
one man, not one message has ever
come back from them. The sinister
mystery there swallowed them up, as
it has swallowed all who tried to visit
Erebus.

  “Now I am calling on you Plane-
teers. If anybody in the system can
reach Erebus and bring back the ra-
dite, you can. The chances are a thou-
sand to one you’ll perish there as mys-
teriously as have all other would-be
explorers of that world. But that
thousandth chance that you might
succeed and bring back the radite, is
the last chance of the Alliance worlds
to preserve their liberty.”

  “We’ll go, sir, of course!” Gunner
Welk exclaimed instantly. “Hell,
whatever’s on Erebus, it can’t stop
us!”

  Sual Av scratched his bald head. “I
wonder what is really there? Any-
way, if human men can bring that ra-
dite back—”

  “Wait a minute!” Thorn exclaimed,
his lean, brown face suddenly eager.
He turned to the Chairman. “You
said nobody had ever landed on Ere-
bus and returned, sir. But one man
did land there and come back. Martin
Cain, the great space pirate of a gen-
eration ago.”

  The Chairman nodded. “Yes, I re-
member the story now. Cain is sup-
posed to have made for Erebus alone
in a lifeboat when his ship was gunned
to a wreck outside Pluto’s orbit. They
say he spent two weeks there and re-
turned safely, the only man ever to do
so.”

  “Martin Cain,” Thorn pointed out
tensely, “must have discovered the se-
cret of how to land safely on Erebus.
If we knew that secret, we could land
there safely and lift the radite!”
Using their impellers, the Three Planeteers left the wreck and rocketed gently toward the open
air-lock of the waiting pirate craft (Chap. IV)

STARTLING STORIES

  “But Cain has been dead for years,”
the Chairman reminded. “And he
never told anyone what was on Ere-
bus, they say.”

  “He told one person the secret of
Erebus, if what I’ve heard in the un-
derworld is true,” John Thorn per-
sisted. “His daughter, Lana Cain.”
The Chairman stared. “Lana Cain,
the girl who’s leader of the space
pirates out in the Zone? The girl
they call the pirate princess?”
“That’s right,” Thorn said tautly.
“They say that Martin Cain, her
father, before he died told her the
secret of how to visit Erebus safely,
so she could take refuge there if ever
she had to. She’s never told anyone
the secret. But she knows it!”

  Sual Ay’s green eyes glistened. “If
we could get that secret from Lana
Cain—”

  “That’s my idea!” Thorn exclaimed.
“If we three go straight to Erebus to
get the radite, the chances are a thou-
sand to one as you say that we’ll
simply meet the same mysterious fate
as all other explorers, and never come
back. Our lives don’t matter, of
course, but the Alliance wouldn't get
that precious radite.

  “Our only real chance, as I see it, is
to make first for the Zone, and get this
girl Lain Cain’s knowledge of Erebus,
by trickery or force. With that knowl-
edge, we can go on to Erebus and have
a fighting chance of winning through
and bringing back the radite.”

  A flame of eager hope leaped into
the haggard eyes of the Earth Gov-
ernment executive.

  “It's the best plan yet, Thorn! But
dare you enter the Zone and seek out
this pirate girl? Those corsairs are
ferociously hostile and suspicious of
all strangers.”

 “You forget, sir,” flashed John
Thorn, “that we are the Three Plane-
teers!”

 “Yes,” rumbled Gunner Welk, cold
blue eyes gleaming. “We have a repu-
tation of our own among the outlaws
of the system, sir.”

UAL AV grinned.

  “I always did have a hidden long-
ing to be a pirate.”

  “Thorn, you give me new hope!” de-
clared the Chairman. “If you can do
this, in the little time left us—"

  “Listen!” commanded Gunner Welk
suddenly.

  Through the locked door and metal-
shuttered window of the study pene-
trated a rising tumult, the roar of
rocket-cars racing up to the mansion.
Then came a rush of running feet
through it, and a loud knock on the
door.

  “Mr. Hoskins!” called a secretary
anxiously to the Chairman through the
door. “The police are here! They say
the Three Planteers are in the city to-
night, and were glimpsed by spy-
plates heading toward this mansion.
They want to make sure you’re safe.”

  “The cursed Earth Police!” flared
Gunner Welk in a hoarse whisper.
“We overlooked some of their spy-
plates.”

  Thorn’s eyes were black pinpoints,
his brown face taut. He knew the
Mercurian was right, that they had
been glimpsed by some of the hidden
visiplates planted cunningly through-
out the metropolis for the benefit of
the police.

  “I'm all right, Ames!" called the
Chairman to his secretary. “Tell the
police not to bother me.”

  But in the next moment came a loud
cry from a police officer outside the
shuttered windows.

  “The Planeteers are in there with
the Chairman!” the man shouted.
“Their tracks lead to the window—
they must be making him say he’s all
right!”

 "Break down the door!" roared
another officer's voice. “Quick, before
they kill the Chairman!”

 A resounding battering began
against the locked door, and another
banging at the metal shutter that
closed the window.

  The Chairman looked helplessly at
Thorn. “I'll have to tell them the
truth, that you Planeteers are really
my agents, or they’ll haul you off to
prison.”

  “No!” said John Thorn fiercely.
“Once the secret that we’re Alliance
agents gets out, it would spread
swiftly over the whole system. Our
THE THREE PLANETEERS

chance of getting the secret of Erebus
from that pirate girl would be
wrecked—our whole plan ruined.”

  “But you can’t escape from here
now!” the Chairman exclaimed.
“They’re at both window and door!”

 “We can escape,” Thorn said
swiftly. “But we've got to make it
look as though we came here for a
criminal purpose. Otherwise, people
will ask why the Planeteers came to
the Chairman’s mansion, and it will be
guessed that we’re really your agents
after all.”

  Thorn drew a roll of flexible metal
cord from his pocket, and sprang
toward the Chairman.

  “Forgive me for this, sir,” he cried.

  The bewildered Chairman did not
resist as Thorn bound his arms and
legs tightly. Then the young Earth-
man straightened.

  “Tell them we tried to kidnap you,
sir,” he said swiftly to the Chairman.
“That we meant to hold you for ran-
som.”

  Gunner Welk stood ready now to
open the window shutter. And Sual
Av had taken a little metal sphere
from his pocket.

  “You’re right—the light-bomb is our
best chance,” Thorn clipped. “Throw
it when Gunner opens the window.”

GUNNER WELK suddenly flung
open the shutter. Before the
police hammering outside it could en-
ter, the bald Venusian flung out the
tiny sphere. The Planeteers clapped
their hands in front of their eyes.

  The sphere burst out on the terrace
amid the pressing group of police. A
terrific glare of blazing white light
exploded from the bomb. A tiny
charge of atoms inside it had been sud-
denly broken down, not into energy,
but into pure radiation in the fre-
quency of light. The awful glare of
radiation instantly paralyzed the optic
nerves of the unprepared police, tem-
porarily blinding them.

  The glare died swiftly. Thorn and
his two comrades were already plung-
ing out through the blinded men.

  "This way!’’ Thorn cried.

 “They’re escaping!” yelled a
blinded officer.

  The Planeteers plunged around the
corner of the huge mansion, toward
the long, low rocket-cars parked in
front.

  Sual Av jumped into one, whose
power-chamber was throbbing. As the
others leaped in after him, the bald
Venusian yanked back the throttle.
The car rabbited out through the dark
grounds with a rising roar from the
rocket-tubes at its rear.

  “Straight for the spaceport!” Thorn
yelled.

  “Hold tight!” called Sual Av, with a
throaty laugh. “I always did want to
let one of these things out!”

  A whizz and roar, a spuming flash
of fire—that was the stolen rocket-
car it shot through the streets.
Its speed was suicidal, but streets were
almost empty at this late hour.

  Now the spaceport was close ahead
—Thorn could see the soaring tower
of the starter, flashing vari-colored
landing signals to a huge freighter
that was sinking ponderously down
out of the stars with all its blasts
braking.

  The audio speaker in the car broke
into frantic voice. “All police! The
Planeteers have stolen a police
rocket-car and are making for the
spaceport, after making an attempt to
kidnap the Chairman! Shoot on
sight!”

  “Look ahead !” yelled Gunner Welk.

  Men in white uniforms were run-
ning across the spaceport toward
them, between the great docks and the
big freighters and liners that rested
like huge torpedoes on the tarmac.

  “They’re too late!” the Venusian
chuckled. “Here’s our ship.”

  Before them loomed the three-man
scout cruiser that had brought them
to Earth, a long, torpedo-slim craft of
gleaming inertrum, on its nose the
number N-77. The thick-clustered
tubes at its stern told of immense pow-
ers of acceleration and speed.

  John Thorn and his comrades tum-
bled into the little ship, as atom-pis-
tols coughed and shells exploded in
white proton-fire around them. Sual
Av spun the heavy, round door shut
while Thorn and the Mercurian leaped
into the control-room in the nose.
22

STARTLING STORIES

Thorn’s hands flashed amid the be-
wildering array of controls, and the
power-chambers in the stern began a
soft, rising roar of atomic energy.

 Thorn jammed down two firing-
keys. With thunderous blast, white
fire burst from the keel tubes of the
cruiser. It lurched upward, riding its
columns of proton-flame, then shoot-
ing obliquely up across the spaceport
as Thorn cut in all the stern tubes.

  He was flung back deep into the
cushioned pilot chair, his entrails
seeming crushed by the terrific acce-
leration. The shadowed convexity of
Earth fell away appallingly beneath
them, as the sharp clang of the fric-
tion-alarm told of walls being danger-
ously overheated by the too-rapid rush
through the air. Then the roar of air
outside the walls died rapidly away.
They were out in space.

  “We’re clear!” shouted Sual Av,
stumbling into the control room, his
grin twisted by pain of shock.

  “Clear, yes—but every Earth cruiser
in space will be after us now for try-
ing to kidnap the Chairman!" Thorn
rapped. “We’ve got to reach the Zone
before they catch us!”

        CHAPTER III
        Into the Zone

"Oh, the gloom of outer space,

Where the tailless comets race,

And the sun's a star that almost disappears.
When our rockets? steady roar.

Sings the good old song once more.

We’re outzvard bound again, oh, Ploneteers!"

SUAL AV’S throaty bass rever-
berated through the little control-
room of the cruiser, in which he sat
with Gunner Welk. It rose above the
soft hissing of the rocket-tubes.

  “Curse me if I can see anything to
make up songs about,” growled the
big Mercurian.

  “You have no poetry in your soul,
Gunner,” retorted the little Venusian
with a grin. “A poetic genius like
myself doesn’t make up his songs—
they come to him out of the great
ether.”

  “They sound uncommonly like the
bellowing of a Jovian marsh-calf when
they do force themselves out,” said
Gunner Welk dourly. “Besides, you’ll
wake up John.”

  “I’m awake,” came a voice behind
them, and they turned.

  Thorn came into the control-room,
rubbing his eyes. Then he peered
tautly through the broad window that
framed a magnificent vista of black
space and stars.

  “What about the cruisers on our
tail ?” he asked quickly.

 The big Mercurian shrugged.
“They’re hanging on — we’ve heard
their audio calls. And they’ve called
up every Alliance cruiser in this part
of the system. We’ve stirred up a hor-
nets’ nest this time, John!”

  John Thorn cut in the switch of the
audio. From the speaker came a weird
jumble of meaningless sound. All
naval calls were always “scrambled” to
prevent eavesdropping; only an official
unscrambler could translate them.

  There was such an unscrambler in
this little ship. Thorn had built it,
out of his own naval experience. He
hastily snapped it on, and the inco-
herent jumble of sounds from the
speaker at once became a crisp, under-
standable voice.

 “—our auras, which shows that
present course of the fugitives is
straight toward the Zone. Undoubt-
edly they’re hoping to hide out there.
It is imperative that we cut them off
before they enter the Zone. Flagship
Gull, signing off.”

  “The Gull!” Thorn exclaimed, his
brown face strange for a moment. “I
know that ship. It was old Comman-
der Leigh speaking. He commands
the Alliance patrol squadrons out
here.”

  His thoughts swept him back into
memory for a moment. He had, only
four years before, commanded a
cruiser of the Earth Navy that helped
patrol this very sector of space, out
here beyond the orbit of Mars, against
a surprise League attack.

  “They’ve guessed that we’re making
for the Zone,” Thorn went on. “It’s
where all outlaws head for when
things get too hot for them."
THE THREE PLANETEERS

23

  "The whole system is too hot for us
right now,” observed Sual Av. “You
should have heard the audio news bul-
letins going back and forth while you
were slepping. “Three Planeteers try
to kidnap Earth Chairman!’ ‘Notorious
outlaws foiled in daring attempt.’ The
system’s ringing with it!”

  “It’ll ring with the news if we’re
gunned out of space by those cruisers
converging on us,” grunted Gunner
Welk sourly. “Do you think we can
slip through them, John?”

  “I think so,” Thorn clipped. “We’ve
got to keep straight on. Turkoon, the
asteroid that’s the pirates’ main base,
lies in the part of the Zone almost di-
rectly ahead.”

THORN stared with narrowed eyes
through the broad window, into
the magnificent star-flecked vault.

  The little ship of the Planeteers was
roaring out through the void at top
speed, millions of miles outside the
orbit of Mars. The bright, small disk
of the sun was dead astern, its rays
hiding the gray blob of Earth, away
from which they had been fleeing for
so many long hours.

  Ahead of them, the void was thick
with bright stars. Brilliant among
them gleamed the big yellow topaz of
Saturn, and beyond and to the left
the fainter green sparks of Uranus
and Neptune. Pluto was somewhere
farther, away off to the right. And
Erebus, their mysterious, ultimate
goal, lay invisible still farther off—
the dark, enigmatic outpost of the
solar system.

  Directly ahead of the racing little
ship, only a few million miles away,
extended a wide band of countless tiny
specks of light, stretching parallel
with the equator of the system. That
broad band of light-specks was the
Zone, the great asteroidal belt whirl-
ing between the orbits of Mars and
Jupiter.

  Thorn gazed tautly into the Zone.
That mighty wilderness of countless
planetoids and meteor-swarms. which
all ordinary shipping avoided by run-
ning above or below, was the No Man’s
Land of the Solar System. In it the
space pirates had long had their lairs,

from which they still sallied forth to
levy toll on the interplanetary ship-
ping. Countless naval expeditions had
tried to clean the place out, and had
been baffled by the shifting swarms of
meteors and tiny planets which made
it impossible to conduct organized op-
erations in there without prohibitive
losses.

  John Thorn’s brown hands clenched.
In there in the Zone, at the pirates’
asteroid base, was the girl who alone
in the system held the secret of
mysterious Erebus, the secret that
would make possible the securing of
the precious radite from that far, dark
planet. Somehow, that girl’s secret
must be secured.

  “Calling flagship Gull!” suddenly
boomed a deep voice from the audio
speaker. “Cruiser Tharine, reporting.
Our aura shows the Planeteers’ ship
four hundred thousand miles from us,
eighteen degrees counter-sunwise.”

  “Orders to Tharine,” rapped back
Commander Leigh’s hard voice
swiftly. “Close in before they slip
past you into the Zone. Calling cruiser
Rantal!”

  “Rantal speaking!” came a quick
voice.

  "Change your course to eighty-six
degrees sunwise,” hammered the Com-

Haskell Trask
24

mander. “You and the Tharine can
catch the Planeteers between you if
you put on all speed.”

  Sual Av scratched his bald head and
looked at Thorn. “They’re converg-
ing on us from two sides, John.”

  “Damn them!” growled the huge
Mercurian angrily. “If they only
knew that we Planeteers are risking
our necks for the sake of the Alli-
ance—’’

  “But they don’t know. To them,
we’re outlaws who must be either cap-
tured or gunned,” John Thorn clipped.
“We’ve got to outrun those two cruis-
ers! Turn the injectors on full, Gun-
ner.”

  The Mercurian quickly obeyed.
Thorn leaned toward the bank of fir-
ing-keys, his eyes on the power
gauges.

  All modern space ships were pro-
pelled by the atomic disintegration of
copper or a similar metal. The pow-
dered metal’s atoms were broken down
by terrific electric voltages, in power
chambers of heavy inertrum. Only
inertrum, that artificial metal whose
atoms were synthetically “crystal-
lized,” could stand the awful strain.

MUCH of the atomic energy gen-
erated in the chambers had to
be fed back into them as electric vol-
tage, to continue the process. But
there was enough surplus to eject
streams of protons at high speed from
the inertrum rocket-tubes, propelling
the ship.

  John Thorn cut in all stern tubes.
The little ship jerked forward with
the deafening roar of the blast.

  “Check the aura-chart,” he ordered
Sual Av. “See if we’re losing those
cruisers.”

  The Venusian snapped on their
ship’s aura. The “aura” was a field of
electro-magnetic vibrations radiated
for a million miles in all directions
by a projector in the ship. The vibra-
tions were reflected back by any ob-
ject within that radius of space, and
automatically plotted and recorded
on the aura-chart.

  The chart was a sphere of pale
light, poised above the window. At
the center of the luminous sphere was

a black dot representing their ship.
Off to right and left of the black dot
moved two red sparks, cutting in ob-
liquely toward them as all advanced.

 “They’re close—no more than a
quarter of a million miles,” reported
Sual Av.

  “The Zone isn’t much farther than
that ahead,” Thorn declared.

  “But there’s a big meteor swarm in
the Zone directly ahead of us!” Gun-
ner Welk exclaimed. “We can’t run
into that!”

  In the fore of the aura-chart sphere
glimmered a cloud of very tiny crim-
son flecks, whirling, seething. It was
the edge of a great cloud of meteors
at the lip of the Zone, stretching across
a million miles of space in front of their
fleeing little ship.

  Thom could see the swarm in black
space ahead. Not the myriad meteors
themselves, but a constant winking and
flashing of tiny flares, where meteors
in the whirling storm of stone struck
and fused every few minutes.

  “Rantal reporting!” rapped the
audio speaker. “Planeteers are now
keeping their lead on us, and running
straight on toward the Zone."

  “Keep after them!” ordered the Com-
mander’s grim voice. “Swarm six-sixty-
two is just ahead of them and they
won’t dare enter that—we’ll have them
boxed.”

  “You heard, boys,” said John Thorn
tightly. “There’s just one thing to
do—run the swarm.”

  “Let her go!" grinned Sual Av. “It
takes more than a few meteors to stop
the Planeteers.”

 “One thing sure,” said Gunner
grimly. “If we do run it safely, we’ll
lose those cruisers. They won’t dare
follow.”

  John Thorn knew the peril into
which their little ship was roaring.
The chance of their winning through
that vast, whirling stone-storm was
less than one in two.

  But the naval cruisers would not fol-
low them in there, he was sure. And
if he could run the swarm, he would be
well inside the Zone and could turn and
run counter-sunwise toward the
asteroid Turkoon, without fear of
further pursuit.

‘Here goes!” Sual Av breathed, JA3 ’'THbrn frantically swung'the ship up

the aura-chart showed their ship ap-
proaching the edge of the great swarm.

  The chart showed the two converg-
ing cruisers making a frantic effort to
head them off. But it was too late.
Already, in the chart, the Planeteers’
ship was entering the swarm.

  Thorn looked forth tensely through
the window. The aura was useless now
that they were actually in the swarm.
His only chance now was in the quick-
ness of his eyes and hands.

SPACE outside the window still
looked empty, for the density of
even the densest meteor swarm is not
high. But Thorn could glimpse all
around them the quick red glows,
quickly fading and re-appearing, of
meteors colliding and fusing.

  A jagged black oblong mass, turning
over slowly, expanded with lightning
speed in front of him. His hand
smashed a starboard-tube firing key,
and the little ship lurched wildly aside
from the oncoming monster.

  A moment later, two smaller black
masses passed some distance on the
right, revolving around each other.
Then there was a rattle as of hail, as
tiny particles struck the ship walls.

  Scree-e-e! The tiny scream of air
escaping through a pierced wall
reached their ears with startling sud-
denness.

  “Hull punctured!” rasped Thorn,
without turning.

  “I’ll get it!” panted Sual Av, grab-
bing up the electro-fusing kit and dart-
ing toward the tiny hole in the wall.

  “Better get our space-suits on,”
Thorn continued rapidly without turn-
ing his head. “We may get holed
again.”

  Gunner Welk hastily hauled in the
suits from a cabinet amidships. The
Mercurian took over for a moment
while Thorn struggled into the suit
and glassite helmet, and then Thorn
went back to his tense watch while his
two comrades donned their suits.

  A soundless flash of red light bur-
geoned on the left in space, faded, and
then blazed up again and veered toward
the ship as a third meteor struck the
two that had just collided.

ward. The fusing, swiftly-cooling
mass passed close underneath.

  Another mass of bulletlike particles
struck the racing ship. Air screeched
out through new holes, and the air-
gauge on the panel started flashing a
warning red light as pressure dimin-
ished. Sual Av was working hastily
with the fusing kit to close the new
hull-punctures.

  Thorn glimpsed a peculiar gleaming
meteor directly ahead, coming dead on
at the ship. He had plenty of time to
curve the ship aside. But as he did
so—

  “Above you!” yelled Gunner Welk
wildly.

  Thorn looked up, just glimpsed the
huge, ponderous mass thundering down
on the ship from above—a tiny
planetoid, black and jagged and mass-
ive, spinning on its axi3 as it bore
noiselessly down on them.

  Thorn’s hand on the keys blasted the
ship to starboard with the speed of
light. But he knew, even as he acted,
that he was too late. He could not quite
get clear.

  There came a grinding shock, a
scream of riven metal. He and Gunner
Welk were thrown crazily together at
a side of the control-room. His head
rang inside his helmet.

  He scrambled up, clutching a stanch-
ion. There was a dead, unusual silence.
He looked back into the stern of the
ship, past Sual Av, who was scram-
bling unsteadily to their side.

^W*7E’RE wrecked!” Thorn ex-
   ww c

claimed, his heart plummet-

ing.

  The little planetoid had crumpled up
the whole stern half of the ship like
cardboard. The air inside it was gone.
The crumpled little craft was drifting
silently in space, revolving slowly
around the jagged planetoid that had
been its Nemesis.

  “Hell!” swore Gunner Welk, his
voice coming to the other two in their
helmets through the short-range audio
with which all space-suits were
equipped. “We were almost through,
too!”

“What do we do now?” Sual Av
26	• >	STARTLING STORIES

asked, hlj greSn eyes perplexedly star-
ing throu£H#hfe glassite of his helmet.

  Thorn Shrugged heavily. “I don’t
know. I was a fool to try to run the
swarm. But" it looked like our best
chance.” g,

  “It was^ laid the big Mercurian
loyally. “Rv5n though we didn’t quite
make it.”

  “We’ve gpt'to get out of here some-
how to Tunkoon, that pirate asteroid,”
Thorn said' “We can’t just cling to
this wreck until the oxygen in our suit-
tanks gives out.”

  He examined the audio and other in-
struments. All wrecked by the shock.
“I suppose we’re lucky to escape with
our lives. But we’ve merely postponed
death if we can’t get away from here.”
Sual Av peered out through the
cracked window, into the black abyss
in which they were floating. The Ven-
usian stiffened as he glimpsed some-
thing beyond the jagged, spinning
planetoid about which their wreck was
revolving.

  “John, a ship is running up along the
edge of the swarm!” he exclaimed. “I
can see its lights!”

  Thorn and the Mercurian leaped to
the window. They stared at the little
blob of light, coming slowly closer.

  “If it’s one of those cruisers that pur-
sued us, we’re done for,” said Gunner
Welk tautly.

  “It’s not!” cried Thorn suddenly.
“It’s a pirate ship !”

       CHAPTER IV
       Pirate Princess

THEY saw the distant ship coast
the edge of the vast meteor swarm
for some minutes and then come to a
halt in space, with a prolonged flash
of its bow rocket-tubes halting it.

  A moment later a cracked, shrill
voice sounded from the little audio-
speakers inside their helmets.

  “Ahoy, Planeteers! Are any of you
alive in that wreck?”

  Thorn answered instantly. “We’re
all alive—John Thorn speaking.”

  “I figgered it’d take more than a

meteor-swarm to finish you three,”
retorted the cracked voice, chuckling.

  “Who’s speaking? What ship is
that?” Thorn demanded.

“Cautious, ain’t ye?” said the shrill
voice, with a cackle of mirth. “I don’t
blame you, seeing how you boys was
chased. But you needn’t worry—this
ain’t no naval cruiser. We’re Compan-
ions of Space. Want to come aboard?”
“Companions of Space? Pirates, eh?"
Thorn said. “Yes, we'll come aboard.”
“Figgered you would,” cackled the
other. “We’ll stand by. and you can
come across with your impellers.”
Thorn switched off his suit-audio
and spoke to his two companions,
clutching their arms to conduct his
voice to them.

  “Cut your audios and listen,” he said
tautly. “These pirates may plan some
kind of treachery, but I don’t think so.
This looks like our chance to get to
their base at Turkoon. But if we get
there, don’t mention Erebus or the
radite, whatever you do.”

  “We understand,” Gunner Welk
muttered.

  They each got a torchlike metal im-
peller from a locker, and then wrenched
open the door amidships. Bracing his
feet against its edge, John Thorn
leaped out into the abyss.

  He shot floatingly away from the
wreck. As his momentum faded and he
began to float back toward the wreck.
Thorn switched on the impeller in his
hand. The blast from it kicked his
space-suited figure on through space.

  Sual Av and the big Mercurian were
following closely. The three progressed
thus, with frequent flashes from their
impellers thrusting them on toward the
distant waiting pirate ship.

  Bright stars gleamed like millions of
watching eyes all around Thorn. He
glimpsed the ominous red flash of col-
liding meteors, nearby. He had to
turn constantly to make sure that they
were moving toward the waiting craft.
Soon they were very close to it, moving
faster now that its slight gravitational
field drew them.

  Thorn eyed the long, grim ship that
floated here in space just outside the
edge of the vast swarm. He judged
that it had once been a Neptunian or
THE THREE PLANETEERS

27

 Uranian naval cruiser — the design
 was one adapted to great distances, and
 the ominous muzzles of atom-guns
 peering forth along its sides spoke of
 heavy armament.

   The Planeteers bumped the side of
 the vessel. They scrambled along it,
 and into the waiting open air-lock.

 A MINUTE later they were inside,
 unscrewing their helmets and
 gazing about a lighted metal chamber.
 A half-dozen armed men were here, and
 one of them came forward to the three.

   “So you’re the famous Three Planet-
 eers, eh?” he asked in the same cracked,
 quavering voice they had previously
 heard.

   The speaker was an old, snow-haired
 Martian, his thin figure stooped, his
 red face incredibly wrinkled with age,
 his faded, rheumy eyes peering at
 them shortsightedly. He wore two
 atom-pistols in his belt, and was chew-
 ing rial leaf whose green juice he spat
 occasionally into a floor receptacle.

   “Curse me if it doesn’t do me good
 to look at you,” quavered the oldster,
 his oath making astounding contrast
 with his cracked voice and senile ap-
 pearance. “Aye, it warms my heart to
 look at men the like of which I was
 myself, in the old days.”

  “"Who are you?” Thorn asked
steadily. "How did you happen along
to pick us up?”

  “As for who I am, the name is
Stilicho Keene. Ever hear of it?" the
old pirate answered shrilly.

   “Stilicho Keene?” repeated Sual Av
 incredulously. “The notorious pirate of
 forty years ago?”

   “The same,” answered the old Mar-
 tian complacently. “Aye, long before
 you Planeteers was ever born, I was
 one of the leaders of the Companions
 of Space, back in the days when there
 were men in space and not the kind of
 milksops I have to give orders to now.”
 “You still haven’t told us how you
 happened to be near to pick us up,”
 Thorn reminded.

The CAUPHUL hurtled be-
tween the LIGHTNING and
the League cruiser grappling it
(Chap. Vll)
28

STARTLING STORIES

  Stilicho Keene turned his rheumy
eyes on the young earthman. He
chuckled as he spat rial juice.

  "Sharp and curious, ain’t ye? Well,
I’d expect it of you. I was the same
at your age, smart and quick and bold.
But you were asking how we hap-
pened along. Well, this is the Ven-
ture, and we’ve been to Jupiter on a
little errand for Princess Lana. Com-
ing back, we heard the audio-calls of
them cruisers chasing you Planeteers.

  “We heard them give up the chase
after you ducked into that meteor-
swarm. So I gave order to lay a
course near the swarm, hoping we
might meet you—and then we sighted
your wreck. It looks like you’ll have
to go on to Turkoon with us now.”
The old pirate continued admiring-
ly, “I’ve heard a lot of you lads and
the fine things you’ve done. The time
you raided the governor’s office at
Titan and stole all that platinum, and
the time you three alone held up that
big Martian liner and robbed all the
passengers of their valuables.”

  The old pirate could not know,
Thorn thought grimly, that that raid
on Titan had been really to secure
League naval secrets and the platinum
a mere blind, or that the hold-up of
the Martian liner had had as its real
objective the securing of a valuable
new atom-gun drawing among the ef-
fects of a Jovian engineer.

  "So when we get to Turkoon,” old
Stilicho Keene was continuing eager-
ly, "maybe you Planeteers would
think of joining up with us Compan-
ions, eh? It would be good to have
some real men with us again, men
such as I used to rocket with when I
was young.”

  John Thorn’s pulses leaped at the
offer. But he kept his excitement
hidden, and frowned a little.

  “The Three Planeteers join an out-
fit led by a girl?” he returned a little
disdainfully.

  “You wait till you meet this girl,”
the old Martian told him. “You’ll find
she’s a real leader, is Lana Cain.”
“We’ll talk of it when we get to
Turkoon,” Thorn told him. “Any-
way, we’re damned grateful to you for
picking us up.”

  “Aye, you bit off a little more than
even you could chew, didn’t you, on
Earth?” cackled the hoary old sinner.
“It warmed my heart to think of it.
Kidnaping the Chairman of Earth!
Only the Planeteers would have
thought of trying that!”

OLD Stilicho Keene led the way
through the dusky corridors and
catwalks of the ship. The Planeteers
shouldered past members of the crew
who stared admiringly at them.

  These pirates were a motley aggre-
gation from every planet in the sys-
tem—Martians, Saturnians and Ura-
nians, wicked - looking Earthmen,
fighters all, from the look of them.

  Thorn and his comrades emerged
after old Stilicho Keene into the
broad, glassite-fronted control-room.
A surly Jovian stood at the firing-
keys, and a nervous, green-faced, hol-
low-eyed Saturnian at the bank of in-
struments on the right.

  “Get going to Turkoon, Barbo,” or-
dered the old pirate commander.

  With roar of stern-tubes pouring
forth proton-fire, the heavy cruiser
shot forward in space.

  John Thorn looked through the
broad glassite windows. The Venture
was moving counter-sunwise into the
very heart of the Zone. Space ahead
seemed thick with whirling clouds of
light-specks that were meteor swarms,
and steady bright sparks that were
booming planetoids.

  “How the devil do you navigate this
damned jungle, anyway?” Gunner
Welk asked the old Martian.

  Stilicho Keene's wrinkled face
grinned. “That’s easy. We’ve got a
little projector of vibrations planted
on every big asteroid and in all
swarms—each projector emitting a
wave of a different frequency. We
pick up the signals, and they show us
just how far and in what direction
each swarm and asteroid is, so we can
avoid them. Just like the lighthouses
on the Earth seas, centuries ago.”

  He added with cunning satisfaction,
“The signals don’t help naval cruisers
or other ships navigate the Zone, be-
cause they don’t know the frequency-
code and can’t tell what’s meant by the
THE THREE PLANETEERS

29

signals they hear. They’ve lost so
many cruisers trying to get in here at
us. that they gave it up as a bad job.”
The ship forged on through the wil-
derness of the Zone, constantly de-
touring to avoid the many perils to
navigation that abounded here. It
coasted along vast swarms, cut sharply
upward to evade planetoids, slipped
close past a small tailless comet that
glimmered like a little white ghost
sun.

  Then John Thorn made out a small
green speck in the blackness, toward
which the Venture was now heading
directly. It widened rapidly into a
green disk. His black eyes narrowed.
“That's Turkoon, isn’t it?”

  “Aye, that's old Turkoon,” quavered
Stilicho Keene. “The sweetest, safest,
snuggest little harbor in the whole
system. Good air and good water, and
ringed round with all those swarms
and asteroids that keep the prying
naval cruisers away. A paradise for
us gentlemen of the void. Aye, there
it lies, like a pretty emerald in space,
just as it lay when I first saw it long
ago.

  “It’s seen a plenty, has old Turkoon.
It’s seen the bloody days of the old
wild corsairs, with the scarred ships
roaring in to it, loaded with ores and
jewels and silks and women. It’s seen
the days of Martin Cain, a generation
ago, when full a thousand ships of the
Companions put forth to space at one
time. It’s seen them all come and go
—all the great, brave gentlemen of the
void, has old Turkoon.”

  “And now.” Thorn said ironically,
“it sees the Companions led by a girl.”
“Aye, boy,” shrilled the old pirate,
“it sees a girl leading us now. But
she’s Martin Cain’s daughter — as
deadly dangerous as ever her sire was.
Aye, and as great a leader.”

THE Venture roared closer to the
green asteroid and then dropped
rapidly toward it, air whistling out-
side its walls.

  “I didn’t think an asteroid this small
could have an atmosphere,” com-
mented Sual Av, peering downward.

  “It must have unusual mass for its
size—probably a core of neutronium

or other super - heavy elements,”
Thorn guessed. “Otherwise, the es-
cape of its air molecules would be in-
evitable, and it wouldn’t be able to
hold an atmosphere.”

  “Let’s hope that nothing holds us
here, once we get what wp’re after,”
muttered Gunner Welk.

 Thorn was taut with the same
thought. Down in this hell’s nest of
pirates was a girl with a secret that
would save four worlds from conquest
—if they could get it from her.

  Turkoon widened beneath them, a
little world blanketed by thick green
fern-jungles. Directly underneath
was a raw brown oval, a big clearing
that had been blasted from the jungle.
At one end of it gleamed the strag-
gling chromaloy buildings of a town
of considerable size, while parked
ships covered the rest of the field.

  The Venture landed with a roar of
brake-blasts and a bumping jar beside
the scores of parked ships. The door
ports were rapidly unscrewed, and
warm, heavy air hit the Planeteers’
faces as they followed old Stilicho
Keene out of the ship.

  “We’ll go right up to the Council
House. Martin Cain’s house, it was,
and Lana lives there now,” the old pi-
rate told the three. Hia rheumy eyes
glistened. “I want to see the faces of
some of these young milksop captains
when they learn that I’ve brought in
the Three Planeteers!”

 They went with Stilicho Keene
across the field and through the main
street of the straggling pirate town.

  Turkoon Town sprawled, unkempt
and somnolent, in the pale wash of
light from the shrunken, setting sun.
The looming dark green wall of the
jungle was only rods from the outer-
most metal cabins.

  Solemn, green and dark towered the
fifty-foot jungle all around. Colossal
ferns crowded each other, the space
between their huge trunks choked
with underbrush. Here and there in
the tangle blindly writhed “crawler
vines,” parasitic fungoid creepers that
wandered with their peculiar power of
self-locomotion, searching for a host.
Through the upper jungle and out
over the town drifted “floating flow-
30

STARTLING STORIES

ers,” white blooms that drank sunlight
and water vapor from the air, and
never touchcd ground after they
budded free.

  Thorn and his two comrades were
eyed without interest by the motley
population of the town—a population
as varied in origin as the pirate crew
they had already met. The men were
from every inhabited world in the sys-
tem. And there were also many
women here—hot-eyed red Martian
girls, languid white Venusian women,
tall, awkward green girls from Saturn,
brazen-faced Earth girls. All were
clad in incongruously rich tunics and
jewels—pirate loot.

CHILDREN, hybrids of a half-
dozen different peoples, fought
and chased each other along the dusty
brown street. And there was an
astounding variety of animals from
all planets, some chained, others run-
ning free. Solemn-eyed, furry Mar-
tian vardaks, green Venusian swamp-
pups, a big, hopping uniped from Io,
and many others—all of them brought
home here by the far-ranging pirate
crews.

  The crew of the Venture was stump-
ing into town behind them, calling
loudly to let all know they had re-
turned. But by now Stilicho Keene
had brought the Planeteers to the
long, low chromaloy building that
faced the end of the main street.

  The snow-haired old pirate pain-
fully climbed the steps, and led them
into a big, low-ceilinged, dusky room.
A small group of men stood in it, all
wearing atom-pistols.

  “Where's Lana?” demanded the old
pirate as this little group turned to-
ward him.

  “We’re waiting for her. She’ll be
out in a moment,” answered a squat,
scarred-faced Jovian who was one of
the group. “So you finally got back,
Stilicho?”

  “Yes, I'm back,” shrilled the ancient
Martian. “And a cursed strange thing
it is that old Stilicho Keene has to go
out on reconnaissance while you
younger men rest your bones.”

  The old pirate spat rial juice vi-
ciously out the open door and then

turned to Thorn and his two com-
rades.

  “Boy, I hate to admit it, but these
are the captains of the Companions
now,” he told Thorn. “Aye, these are
the worthless lot who call themselves
pirates in these degenerate days. Yon
ox of a Jovian is Brun Abo. The pret-
ty fellow beside him is Kinnel King,
and the fat hog yonder is Jenk Cheer-
ly. the latest to join our ranks.”

  Thorn's black eyes swept the pirate
leaders. The man beside the Jovian,
the man called Kinnel King, was an
Earthman, middle-aged, with a very
handsome face and brooding eyes.

  Jenk Cheerly, the third pirate cap-
tain, was a Uranian of incredible obes-
ity. His fat, puffy body seemed about
to burst his jacket, and his pale-green,
rotund face was featureless except for
two bright, piglike little eyes.

  The obese Uranian stared at Thorn
and his two comrades with those little
eyes, and then spoke in an incongru-
ously high and squeaky voice to old
Stilicho Keene.

  “Where did you pick up these
three?” he asked. “And why did you
bring them here?”

  Stilicho Keene cackled, his rheumy
eyes glistening.

  “You’ll find out who they are in a
minute, Jenk,” he shrilled. “It’s go-
ing to be a surprise for you, and all
you other louts who call yourselves
pirates.”

  A door in the rear of the room sud-
denly opened, and a girl in white silk
jacket and trousers entered the room.

  “You’re back, Stilicho?” she ex-
claimed eagerly as she saw the old
Martian. “What did you learn at
Jupiter?”

  Thorn’s gaze riveted on the girl.
He heard a low whisper from Sual Av
behind him.

  “So that’s Lana Cain,” whispered
the Venusian.

  Lana Cain’s eyes looked past the old
Martian into Thorn’s face. He felt
the impact of her challenging stare as
though it were a tangible shock.

THE pirate girl was a slender, im-
perious figure in her silk gar-
ments. Her proud, graceful form
THE THREE PLANETEERS

31

seemed somehow vibrant with force.
The bronze-gold hair that hung to her
shoulders was like a casque of dull
gold flame around her face, catching
little glints of sunlight in its strands.

  Her face was white, dynamic, with
hardness in the straight red mouth
and in the stubborn set of her small
chin. Her dark blue eyes, as they
stared into Thorn’s face, were grow-
ing slowly darker, as though storm
were gathering in them, tiny light-
nings seeming to flash in their depths.

  Thorn was momentarily bewildered,
badly startled. He had expected some
blowsy, barbaric, aging wench, whom
he could without difficulty trick out
of the secret he wanted. But this girl
was as beautiful—and as dangerous-
looking—as a sword-blade.

        CHAPTER V
        Secret Enemy

IN the queerly tense silence Thorn
stared at Lana Cain. Then the si-
lence was suddenly broken by the
shuffling entrance of a grotesque,
four-legged creature that had fol-
lowed the pirate girl into the room.
It stared at Thorn with blazing green
eyes.

  “It’s a space-dog, John!" exclaimed
Sual Av wonderingly. “You've heard
of them."

  “I’ve heard of them," Thorn mut-
tered. “But this is the first one I’ve
ever seen."

  The space-dog stood three feet high
at the shoulder. Its body was of
dusty, mineraline gray flesh that had
an inorganic look. Its four legs
ended in heavy digging paws, and its
mouth was furnished with great
grinding tusks. It had no nostrils, for
the creature was not an air-breathing
animal.

  It was, in fact, one of a unique spe-
cies. The early explorers who first
visited the asteroid Ceres had been
amazed to find these creatures living
on that airless little world. They
were product of an evolution working
without atmosphere, creatures able to

assimilate the inorganic elements they
dug from the ground, and consume
them by a chemical process other than
oxidization. They had dim telepathic
powers by which their rudimentary
minds communed.

  “Ool will not hurt you,” said Lana
Cain crisply to Thorn.

  She glanced at the blazing-eyed
creature, and it lay down at her feet
as it received her telepathic command.

  "Stilicho, you brought these three
men here?” the girl asked the old Mar-
tian. “Who are they?’’

  “Yes, who are they?” squeaked Jenk
Cheerly, the obese, beady-eyed Ura-
nian. “What's all the mystery about
them?”

  Stilicho Keene’s rheumy eyes glis-
tened, and his wrinkled face quivered
with excitement as he answered.

  “Why, they’re just three lads I
picked off a wreck coming back, and
fetched along to Turkoon,” he qua-
vered. The old man paused to enjoy
his coming triumph, then added,
“Maybe you’ve heard of these three
boys. They’re called the Three Plan-
eteers.”

  “The Three Planeteers!”

  Brun Abo, the squat Jovian, uttered
that startled cry. He and everyone
else in the room stared at John Thorn
and Sual Av and Gunner Welk in rig-
32

STARTLING STORIES

idly frozen amazement.

  The beady eyes of Jenk Cheerly, the
fat Uranian, were wide with astonish-
ment. Kinnel King, the Earthman,
stiffened. And Lana Cain's dark blue
eyes narrowed incredulously as she
stared at Thorn’s dark face.

  “It's them, all right,” muttered the
Jovian in a moment. “I’ve seen their
pictures on reward notices.”

  “Those pictures on the notices were
poor likenesses,” said Sual Av, a grin
on his froglike face. “They hardly
did me justice, as you can see for
yourselves.”

  “What do you Planeteers want here,
if you are the Planeteers?” demanded
Jenk Cheerly suspiciously.

 Gunner Welk stiffened at the fat
green pirate’s question.

  “We’re not in the custom of asking
anybody’s leave for our coming and
goings, Uranian!” he flared.

  “Not even the Planeteers can talk
to me like that!” squeaked Jenk
Cheerly furiously, his hand dropping
to his side.

 “Draw that atom-pistol, and I’ll
Bhove it down your fat throat,”
warned the towering Mercurian omi-
nously.

 “Quiet, Gunner,” snapped John
Thorn. “I’ll do the talking.”

  “Let them fight!” urged old Stilicho
Keene with quavering eagerness, a
ghoulish avidity in his rheumy eyes
as he leaned forward. “There’s noth-
ing to warm the blood like the sight
of two good men in a stand-up fight.”
"There’ll be no fighting here!”
flared Lana Cain. “You all know my
rules! If any of you doesn’t like them
he can get out of Turkoon and out of
the Zone!”

THE girl’s voice cracked like a sil-
ver whip, and her dark blue eyes
were stormy now with little light-
nings. The space-dog, Ool, had
sprung to his feet, his great green eyes
blazing.

  Thorn sensed the electric force in
this girl which had kept her the ac-
knowledged leader of the wild Com-
panions of Space. The others in the
room were stricken to sullen silence
by it.

  Lana’s stormy eyes swung back to
Thorn.

  “Jenk’s question was a fair one,
John Thorn,” she declared. “What
are you Planeteers doing here? You
never came into the Zone before—you
always worked by yourselves.”

  Thorn shrugged. “We didn’t come
here by choice. Perhaps you heard of
the trouble we got into at Earth?”
“We heard of your attempt to kid-
nap the Chairman there,” Lana nodded
curtly. “Go on.”

  “We bungled the job and had to run
for it with half the Earth Navy on our
tail,” Thorn continued coolly. "We
tried to lose them in a swarm and got
wrecked. The old Martian there
picked us up and brought us here to
Turkoon. It’s not a place we’d have
picked voluntarily.”

  Lana stiffened, and asked danger-
ously, “You don’t think much then of
we Companions and our ways?”

  “Not much,” Thorn answered cool-
ly. “I’ve no doubt your followers are
good fighters, but they look like rather
an undisciplined rabble.”

  Thorn was playing his part to the
hilt. He knew well that for the fa-
mous Planeteers to seem too friendly
on first acquaintance, too eager to join
the pirates, would quickly arouse sus-
picion.

  “But, boy, I was hoping that you
three would join up with us!” qua-
vered old Stilicho Keene dismayedly.

 “The Planeteers work alone,”
Thorn declared frowningly. Then he
appeared to hesitate, and added, “It’s
true that we’re stranded here now
without a ship—”

  Sual Av instantly played up to him.
“Yes, John, we need a ship and equip-
ment. Maybe we could work with
these people for a while, and take a
new cruiser as our share of loot.”
“You haven’t been asked to join the
Companions yet,” flared Lana Cain.
“You Planeteers are just three men
here. I could order you gunned down
and it would be done.”

  John Thorn looked at her steadily
with cool black eyes. “Would you do
that?”

  “No, I wouldn’t,” she admitted after
a moment. “Turkoon is a refuge for
THE THREE PLANETEERS

 every outlaw who comes into the
 Zone, as long as he obeys my rules.
 And I don’t countenance killing
 here."	'

   Thorn smiled. “After all, we Plan-
 eteers are in no position to be choos-
 ers. We need a ship. We’ll join up
 with you for a while, if you’re agree-
 able, and take a ship as our share of
 spoil, and then be on our way. What
 do you say?”

   Lana frowned in thought, her anger
 gone. “We do need captains,” she
 murmured.

   “And where will you find better
 ones than the Planeteers?” cried old
 Stilicho Keene with shrill eagerness.
 “Take them in, lass—it’s heaven sent
 them here to help us in the big new
 foray we’ve planned.”

   “We can pull that job without their
 help,” squeaked Jenk Cheerly, his pig-
 like eyes malignant. “What do we
 need with the Planeteers?”

 BRUN ABO, the squat Jovian,
 nodded sullen agreement. But
 Kinnel King, the handsome Earthman,
 turned on the obese Uranian.

   “After all, Jenk,” said Kinnel King
 silkily, "you yourself are still a new-
 comer in our midst. We don’t need
 advice from you on this.”

   “No brawling!” Lana ordered impe-
 riously. She continued, “John Thorn,
 I’m taking you three into the Com-
 panions. But understand one thing—
 when we blast off Turkoon, everyone
 is under my command, even the Plan-
 eteers.”

   Thorn frowned, though inwardly
 his heart was pounding with elation.

   “We’re not used to being under or-
 ders of anyone,” he declared.

 “Take it or leave it!” Lana flashed.
“There can only be one leader when
ships go into action.”

 Thorn finally shrugged. “Well, as
I said, we’re not in a position to be
choosers. We follow your orders in
space.”

 “That’s settled, then,” Lana said
curtly. Her slender figure swung
round to Stilicho Keene. “Now what
about your reconnaissance, Stilicho?
Did you find out anything at Jupiter
about those scheduled freighters?”

   The old Martian nodded his white
 head vigorously. “Sure did. We
 slipped in to Jupiter without bein'
 spotted, and landed secretly in that
 big marsh near Vosek. Me and one of
 my boys went into the city in disguise
 and hung around the docks. We saw
 rich cargo bein’ loaded in them
 freighters—thirty of ’em. We waited
 till they took off, a bunch of tankers
 with ’em. They're blasting along
 without any naval convoy. I figger
 them to cross under the Zone tomor-
 row, on their way to Saturn.”

   “Didn’t I tell you they’d sail with-
 out convoy?” squeaked Jenk Cheerly,
 the obese Uranian’s eyes glistening.
 “Wasn’t my tip right? This’ll be a
 rich haul, and without even a fight.”
 Lana Cain turned to Thorn and his
 two comrades and explained crisply.

   “Jenk just joined us two weeks ago.
 He came with his ship from Jupiter,
 where he had a secret base on one of
 the outer moons. He brought advance
 notice of these rich Jovian freighters
 scheduled to transit across the inner
 orbits of the system to reach Saturn
 which is now approaching opposition.

   “They’re without convoy,” the pi-
 rate girl continued rapidly, “because
 the League of Cold Worlds is concen-
 trating all its cruisers at Saturn right
 now, preparing for the great attack
 they’re going to make on the Alliance.
 I sent Stilicho to check their sailing
 and make sure they had rich cargo.
 We'll surprise them tomorrow when
 they pass under the Zone.”

   “Yes, and fine loot there’ll be to di-
 vide,” squeaked the obese Uranian
 gloatingly. “We’ll gun them to a
 wreck, and gut them of every scrap of
 spoil, and leave not a man alive on
 them to take the tale to Saturn.”
 “No!” exclaimed Lana hotly. “No
 massacre! I told you my rules when
 you joined us, Jenk. The Companions
 willfully spill no blood as long as I
 lead them!”

 “My rule has always been to leave
 nobody alive to testify against me in
 a space-court,” grumbled the fat Ura-
 nian shrilly. “This tender-hearted-
 ness—”

 “It isn’t just tender-heartedness;
it’s good stategy!” flashed Lana Cain,
34

her blue eyes determined. "When
freighter-men know they’re going to
be massacred if they surrender, they
fight to the last man. But when they
know that only their cargo will be
taken, and their lives spared, they sur-
render a lot more quickly. Further,
the hunt against us is never so bitter.
It was my father's rule to take no life,
and it’s mine, and it’s paid returns to
the Companions.”

  “That it has!” declared Brun Abo,
the Jovian. “It’s saved us many a bit-
ter fight—and possibly extermina-
tion.”

THE girl looked around them as
she gave her orders.

  “Our chief spatial navigator will
check their course against Saturn’s—
and ours. We’ll blast off tomorrow
dawn, with forty ships. That’ll give
us time enough to be waiting in the
Zone, and when the Jovian freighters
pass underneath, we’ll swoop down on
them.”

 “What about Gunner and Sual Av
and me?” John Thorn asked her. “We
have no ship, remember.”

  “You'll be furnished one, and a crew
to go with it,” Lana answered crisply.
“From what I’ve beard of you Plan-
eteers, you’ll be able to handle your
part.”

  She ran her hand a little tiredly
through her mop of dull-gold hair.

  "That’s all, men. See that your
ships and men are ready to blast off
at dawn. And not too much drinking
tonight!”

  As the pirate captains started to
troop out, the girl added to the old
Martian, “Stilicho, find a cabin for the
Planeteers.”

  Thorn was starting out with his
two comrades after the old pirate,
when Lana’s voice halted him.

  “Wait, John Thorn. There's some-
thing I want to ask you.”

  Thorn turned, surprised. The girl
was looking at him with a queerly
thoughtful expression in her blue
eyes, her small hand idly patting the
space-dog that had risen beside her.

  “You were in the Earth Navy be-
fore you became an outlaw, weren’t
you?" she asked him.

  Thorn nodded. “Until I deserted,”
he admitted curtly.

  Lana pointed up to a picture on the
wall, a portrait of a hard-faced, mid-
dle-aged man with piercing eyes.

  "My father. Martin Cain, was an
officer in the Earth Navy, too, before
he became an outlaw,” she said slowly.
“Do they ever speak of my father on
Earth? What do they say of him?”
Thorn told her the truth. “They
speak of him only as notorious pirate.
Few remember he was ever a naval
man.”

  “But he was, and one of their best
officers,” Lana said bitterly. “It was
the jealousy of other officers over his
promotions that formed a cabal which
had him dishonorably discharged.
That was the reward of Earth for all
the service he’d given his native
planet.”

  “You don’t think much of Earth,
eh?” Thorn said curiously. “Yet, after
all, it’s really your native world.”
“The Zone is my world—I was born
here. I hate Earth for what it did to
my father!” the girl flashed. “I'll be
glad to see the League smash the inner
worlds, for though I hate the League
and its dictator. I’ve an even greater
hate for Earth!”

  Thorn felt a faint hope he had cher-
ished until now die within him. He
had hoped that the pirate girl might
be induced to save Earth from con-
quest by telling him the secret of
Erebus. But he saw now futile had
been that slight hope. This girl had
only bitter hatred for the world she
deemed to have wronged her father.

  “Your father was an extraordinary
man,” Thorn mused, looking up at the
portrait. “A great fighter and or-
ganizer, a wonderful navigator. They
say that he even visited Erebus, the
tenth world, though I suppose that's
just a baseless legend.”

  “It’s the truth!” Lana declared
proudly. “My father was on Erebus
two weeks, and came back safely—
the only man in the whole history of
the Solar System that ever did so.”
John Thorn stared incredulously.
“How did he do it? How did he avoid
whatever peril there has swallowed so
many men?”

ffW CAN’T tell you that,” the girl
i said slowly. “I’ve never told
anybody what my father told me about
Erebus.”

  “Then,” Thorn said wonderingly,
“you’re the only person in the whole
system who knows anything about
that mystery world? The only person
who knows how it might be visited
safely?”

  The girl nodded slowly. A queer
expression, one of somber, haunting
memory, had come into her vital blue
eyes.

  "Yes, I’m the only one who knows
the secret of Erebus,” she admitted.
“And nobody will ever learn it from
me. I have reasons for keeping silence
about that world!”

  She trembled slightly. Thorn,

35

watching her tautly, felt a queer chill
as of a cold, alien breath in the room.

  “But I do not know why I am talk-
ing of Erebus,” she said impatiently.
“I am tired. I shall see you tomor-
row at dawn, before our ships blast
off.”

  Thus dismissed, Thorn left the
Council House and walked slowly,
deep in thought, down the street of
Turkoon Town. The sun was setting,
and from the little crimson disk a flood
of pale red light uncannily illumi-
nated the dark, surrounding fern-
jungle, the raw field and parked ships,
and the straggling metal town.

He found the metal cabin as-
signed them. Gunner Welk and Sual
Av sprang up eagerly as he entered.
“We’ve made it so far, John!” ex-
36

STARTLING STORIES

claimed the bald Venusian excitedly.
“We’re in with the pirates now, at
least. Did you find out anything about
Erebus from the girl?”

  Thorn shook his head. “She won’t
talk about Erebus—she seems almost
afraid to. I didn’t dare press ques-
tions.”

  “We can’t wait forever to get the
secret out of her,” rumbled Gunner
Welk warningly. “Even when we get
it, it’ll take a lot of time to get out to
Erebus and lift the radite, remem-
ber.”

 “I know,” Thorn muttered. “But
we’ll ruin all our chances if we're too
rash now.”

  He fished in his pocket for a rial
cigarette.

  “It's possible,” he said, “that what-
ever her father told her about Ere-
bus—”

  Thorn stopped speaking. His face
froze as he pulled out the thing he had
felt in his pocket. It was a tiny metal
sphere, only a half-inch in diameter,
with a minute aperture in it.

  “An Ear!” exclaimed Sual Av ap-
palledly.

  Thorn dropped the thing like a pois-
onous snake and ground it under his
heel. His dark face was grim as he
looked down at the shattered frag-
ments of the Ear.

  The thing was a super-compact and
super-sensitive audio transmitter. It
picked up all sound in its immediate
vicinity and broadcast it electro-mag-
netically, for a short range. Both po-
lice and criminals of the system used
Ears for eavesdropping at a distance.

  “Someone slipped it into my pocket
in the Council House J” Thorn rapped.
“See if there are any more.”

  But a swift search of their clothing
and of the cabin disclosed no more
Ears.

  “Whoever put that Ear in my pocket
suspects us I” Thorn said grimly.
“And whoever it is knows now from
our talk that we came here after the
secret of Erebus, that we’re after the
radite!

  “Thank heaven,” he added tightly,
“that we didn’t give away the fact that
we want the radite for Earth, that
we’re Earth agents.”

  “This is bad, John,” said Sual Av,
his ugly face sober. “Who do you
think suspects us? Lana Cain her-
self?”

  “If it were she, or someone loyal
to her,” rumbled Gunner Welk, “she’d,
have sent men here to seize us by
now.”

  “Gunner’s right—it can’t be Lana,”
muttered Thorn. “Someone here is
playing a deep game of his own. And
whoever it is doesn't like us, and
knows now just what we’re here for.”

  “John, our hidden enemy will have
a fine chance to gun us tomorrow in
the confusion of this attack on the
Jovian freighters,” warned Sual Av.

  Thorn’s brown face hardened. “I
know. But we have to keep right on
playing our part here, until we get
the secret. We’ve got to take our part
in the foray, and keep looking out for
trouble.”

CHAPTER VI
The Trap

FORTY pirate ships throbbed
steadily through the wilderness of
the Zone. Their course through the
jungle of swarms and debris was sun-
wise. The six basic directions in space
navigation are sunwise and counter-
sunwise—that is, in the same direction
as the rotation of the sun or in an op-
posite direction; sunward and out-
ward—that is, toward or away from
the sun; and up or down, from the
equatorial plane of the Solar System
as plotted by the fixed stars.

  The pirate fleet moved in a close for-
mation of short columns. In the lead
was Lana Cain’s silvery cruiser, the
Lightning. The ship that had been
given the Planeteers to command, the
Caaphul, was close behind her. On
one side of them sailed old Stilicho
Keene’s cruiser, and on the other the
ship of Jenk Cheerly, which was
marked on the bows with an ominous,
painted black skull.

  John Thorn stared through the
glassite window of the control-room,
as they throbbed on. In the pilot’s
THE THREE PLANETEERS

37

chair beside him sat Sual Av.

  “I don't like this raid,” the Venusian
was saying, his ugly face troubled.
“An attack on peaceful freighters—
it’s out of our line, John.”

  “Nobody on those freighters will be
killed,” Thorn reassured him. “You
heard Lana’s orders. And we’ve got to
help rob those ships, to keep up the
part we’re playing here. We’ve got to
do anything until we get that secret
out of the girl. And they are not Al-
liance craft.”

  “I still can't see how we can get
it from her,” muttered Sual Av, his
green eyes thoughtful. “We can’t use
force, when she’s surrounded by hun-
dreds of her men all the time. She
doesn’t look the kind who can be
tricked. And from what you said,
she’ll never tell it to you of her own
free will.”

  “We’ll find a way,” Thorn declared
tightly. “But I wish I knew who
planted that Ear on me, and what his
game is.”

 Thorn watched the wilderness of
meteor swarms, cross-orbiting plane-
toids, and occasional stray comets past
which they sailed. There was no need
for navigating by the wave-code, with
Lana’s cruiser leading the way.

  Finally the silvery torpedo-shape of
the Lightning slowed down and
stopped. At once all the other pirate
ships responded with a blast of fire
from their bow tubes, braking them-
selves.

 Thorn looked out. They were ly-
ing low in the Zone, close by a meteor-
swarm whose myriad masses of stone
showed very near their ships in the
aura-chart. They had reached the
point under which the Jovian freight-
ers would soon pass, when they de-
toured downward under the Zone as
all ordinary shipping did.

 Thorn spoke into the interphone
connecting the ship’s divisions.

  “Gunner, are you cleared for action
down there?”

 Gunner Welk’s rumbling voice
came through the instrument from the
gun-decks where the mighty Mer-
curian had taken command.

 “All ready! Every man’s at his
post.”

  “On space-suits, everybody,” Thorn
ordered sharply. “Then stand by.”

  It was customary before an action
in space for all the crew of a ship to
don their suits, so that in case their
hull was torn open they could con-
tinue to work and fight the ship until
there was time to make repairs.

  Thorn and Sual Av put on their own
suits and helmets. Then they waited
in silence, their ship floating beside
the others. Lana Cain had strictly
forbidden use of the audio between
ships until the attack opened, lest the
freighters be given the alarm.

THORN peered through the eye-
piece of the telescope built into
the wall between the broad windows.
He could see no sign of the freighters
sunward, and his eyes tired.

  A little later, Sual Av gripped his
arm and pointed ahead at Lana’s ship.

  “The signal, John! They’re com-
ing!”

  Lana’s silvery cruiser had emitted
three short flashes of fire from its bow
and stern tubes, the agreed signal.

  Thorn peered again through the
’scope. Now he saw the coming
freighters, far down and sunward.
They were coming straight on, and
would pass the Zone directly under-
neath the pirates.

  There were thirty big freighters,
and lagging after them came forty
tankers of the type used for trans-
porting liquefied gases, broad-beamed
and very dumpy ships. Thom’s keen
eyes searched space for sign of a naval
convoy, but found none.

  “Those are the dumpiest tankers
I’ve ever seen,” he muttered. “It's a
wonder that freighters running with-
out convoy would take such old tubs
along to hold their speed down.”

 Sual Av shrugged. “The League
worlds are pressing every old ship
they’ve got into service, in their prep-
aration for war. Anyway,” he grinned,
“these pirates aren’t going to bother
the tankers.”

  The merchantmen came steadily on,
and now the freighters that led were
directly underneath the part of the
Zone in which the pirate fleet hov-
ered. Thorn knew the aura-charts of
38

STARTLING STORIES

the freighters would show the pirate
ships only as part of the great meteor
swarm they were lying near. That was
why Lana had chosen the position.

  Thorn’s nerves tensed as the Jovian
freighters came directly underneath, a
little flock of gleaming specks swim-
ming on through black space toward
distant Saturn, the slow tankers still
lagging behind. Sual Av was leaning
tensely over his bank of keys, and
there was no sound in the ship exeept
the throb of its power chambers.

  Abruptly from the audio-speaker
flared Lana Cain’s silver voice.

  “Attack! Dive on them!"

  Forty pirate ships streamed blast-
ing white fire from their stern tubes,
forty grim torpedoHke shapes roared
down through the spatial vault toward
the thirty hapless freighters.

  As they swooped, the forty corsair
craft split into five divisions of eight
ships each. The eight led by the flash-
ing cruiser of the Three Planeteers
headed toward the sunwise end of the
freighters. Jenk Cheerly and his
division headed for the counter-sun-
wise end. Kinnel King for the sun-
ward and Brun Abo for the outward
sides. Lana Cain herself, with Stili-
cho Keene’s ship and six others, com-
eted down below the merchantmen.

  John Thorn saw that the swift
maneuver had succeeded. The
freighters were “boxed”—hemmed in
on every side except the upward one,
which was closed by the dreaded Zone.
The pirates had not included the
worthless, lagging tankers in their
trap, and those dumpy ships were still
coming bewilderedly on.

  The freighters, as the corsairs
swooped down around them, milled
confusedly with blasts from their
bow-tubes braking them, seeking to
find a way out of the trap. The few
atom-guns with which they were
armed spat shells frantically, that ex-
ploded in blinding flares of atomic
energy.

  “Ahoy," freighters!” rang Lana’s
silvery voice from the audio. "Cease
firing or we’ll gun you out of space!
Surrender and nobody will be
harmed!”

  “How do we know you’ll keep your

promise?” came the hoarse, fear-laden
voice of the freight squadron com-
mander.

 “This is Lana Cain speaking!”
answered the girl’s voice instantly. “I
keep my promises.”

A MOMENT’S silence. The scat-
tered fire from the trapped
freighters suddenly stopped.

 The freight commander’s answer
came. “You’ve the reputation of not
killing. We’ll surrender.”

  Sual Av, his green eyes gleaming
with excitement through his helmet,
glanced swiftly at John Thorn.

  “The girl’s policy of mercy does pay
dividends, John,” he muttered.

  “Stand by to board the freighters!”
crackled Lana’s voice to her pirate
followers. “Two ships in each divi-
sion stand off to keep watch. Hurry,
men!”

  Like sharks eager for prey, thirty
of the forty pirate cruisers one to each
victim, dashed in at the helpless
freighters. The lead-ship of each divi-
sion, with one other, stood by ready to
turn its guns on any freighter that
might resist the boarding.

  Thorn’s cruiser, the Cauphul, was
one of those that stood off to keep
watch. He saw the pirate ships already
hooking onto the freighters by means
of the magnetic grapples they shot
forth. The grapple-lines were winched
in swiftly, the pirate and merchant
ships were drawn close together, and
the flexible metal catwalks run swiftly
out between them by the corsairs.
Then the space-suited pirate horde
was pouring across the short, swaying
catwalks, hammering at the doors of
the freighters until they opened.

  Back across the precarious catwalks
staggered the helmeted pirates, laden
with bales and cases, sacks of valuable
minerals, bars of rare metals, crates of
silks and wines and foods.

  “Why can’t we be in on this?” de-
manded Sual Av, twitching with ex-
citement. “There’s no fun to lying off
here watching the others.”

  “It’s Lana’s orders,’* reminded John
Thorn. “And we Planeteers agreed
to take her orders when we were in
space.”
THE THREE PLANETEERS

39

 Thorn looked sunward, and
frowned. “Why the devil haven’t
those tankers run for it? The fools
are blundering right on.”

  The forty tubby tankers that had
been laboriously trailing the freight-
ers in space were coming stupidly on
to the scene of the hold-up, as though
unable to realize what was happening.
They were now quite close.

  Thorn’s brain suddenly sounded an
alarm, as he stared at the oncoming
tankers. His eyes, trained by long
naval experience, saw something
queer about the lines of those dumpy
ships, something—

  He leaped to the audio. “Lana,
those tankers are disguised naval
cruisers!” he yelled. “They’re—”
His warning was too late. At the
very moment Thorn shouted, the forty
“tankers” were unmasking.

  Their bulging sides suddenly fell
away. Those sides had been only a
skin of thin metal plates. Their dis-
appearance exposed the ships, not as
tankers, but as sleek, grim-lined naval
cruisers with batteries of heavy atom-
guns all along their sides, and with the
four interlaced circles of the League
of Cold Worlds on their bows.

 Instantly the unmasked League
cruisers shot forward. Their rocket-
tubes burst fire, and from their bat-
teries hailed a storm of deadly shells
that burst in blinding lightning-flares
among the startled pirate ships.

THE trap had been perfectly
sprung. The League cruisers, lag-
ging behind in the guise of slow tank-
ers, had waited until the pirate ships
were hooked onto the freighters by
grapples and catwalks, their crews en-
gaged in looting. Then they had
thrown off their disguise and leaped
in on the Companions’ ships.

  “Cut away!” cried Lana Cain’s voice
from the audio. “It’s a trap! Cut
loose and break for the Zone!”

  Thorn saw her silvery cruiser leap
forward to engage the rushing League
battleships, to try to hold them back
while the pirates engaged in looting
could cut away from the freighters.

  Loyally, old Stilicho Keene’s long
black cruiser, and four or five others

dashed forward with the pirate girl’s
silver ship. And Thorn’s cruiser was
one of those that followed her, for
Thom had yelled the order to Sual
Av.

  Blinding, dazzling flares of burst-
ing atom-shells from the League
cruisers seared space around Thorn’s
ship. Sual Av was following Lana’s
lead right into the forefront of the
formidable League battle-squadron.

  “Drive in to cover Lana’s ship!”
Thorn cried to the Venusian. “If
they get her, everything’s ruined for
us!”

  He yelled into the interphone. “Let
go with all batteries to starboard,
Gunner!”

  The Cauphul shook to the roar of
its straining rocket-tubes and the
thudding thunder of its atom-guns go-
ing off as Sual Av flung the ship in be-
side Lana’s silvery cruiser.

  The very madness of the wild coun-
ter-attack of the little handful of pi-
rate ships, as they dashed fiercely at
the League cruisers, seemed momen-
tarily to disconcert the latter. Pre-
cious moments were gained in which
the main body of the pirate fleet was
hastily cutting away from the freight-
ers they had grappled.

  Thorn was wild with anxiety for
Lana Cain. If anything happened to
the girl, if the mysterious secret of
Erebus died with her—

  The League cruisers had not con-
centrated any fire upon her silver ship
yet. They were pouring shells upon
the other pirate craft, including
Thorn’s, but Lana’s had escaped fire
even though she had her batteries
streaming shells forth.

  Thorn was thrown from his feet as
a salvo of blinding bursts rocked the
Cauphul. He heard the scream of es-
caping air below, the slam of auto-
matic doors as he staggered up.

  “They’ve got Lana’s ship!” Sual Av
shouted hoarsely. “Look!”

  Thorn’s heart plummeted as he saw
through the fight. A League cruiser
had got its magnetic grapples onto
Lana Cain’s silver ship, and was draw-
ing it closer. It had grappled her
craft by its keel, so that she was un-
able to use her guns.
40

STARTLING STORIES

 "They’ve got my ship, Compan-
ions!" stabbed the pirate girl’s voice,
clear and unafraid, from the audio.
“You can't save me—break for the
Zone while you have the chance!”

  “If we don’t do as she says,” cried
Sual Av tensely, “we'll be gunned to
a wreck. But if we leave her—”

  “We can’t leave her!” John Thorn
exclaimed fiercely. “Our plan for the
Alliance depends on her!”

CHAPTER VII
Shadow of the League

JOHN THORN’S ship rocked
wildly as another shell struck it.
The shells of all atom-guns contained
a charge of powdered metal whose
atoms had been brought to a critical
point of instability. When an electric
charge stored in the shell was re-
leased, either by impact or a timer, it
detonated the unstable atoms into a
destroying flare of atomic energy.
These deadly shells were fired from
guns and pistols by the push of an
electro-solenoid built into the barrel.

  Red lights flashing on and off in the
panel in front of him warned Thorn
that already a half dozen compart-
ments of the Catiphul had been holed
and had lost their air. Down below.
Gunner Welk was still keeping his
crew batteries going, pouring shell
out on the encircling League cruisers,
but at any moment a hit on their
rocket - tubes or power - chambers
might disable them entirely.

  Thorn’s mind was crazy with worry
for the fate of Lana Cain. The
League cruiser that had hooked its
magnetic grapples on the keel of her
ship was still winching her helpless
craft closer. The capture or killing
of the pirate girl meant the collapse
of his great plan, and the probable
ruin of the four inner worlds.

  “We’ve got to free Lana’s ship!” he
cried to Sual Av over the thudding of
guns. “There’s only one way—drive
our ship between hers and the one
that’s hooked her—break the grapple-
lines!”

  Sual Av’s green eyes widened star-
tledly inside his glassite helmet.
Then the bald Venusian laughed reck-
lessly.

  “All right—here goes, John! Hold

tight!”

  “Cease firing!” Thorn yelled into
the interphone to Gunner Welk at the
same moment.

  Sual Av’s fingers smashed down on
firing keys. The Cauphul jumped
forward in space, a raving torrent of
energy streaming from her stern
tubes.

 The Venusian drove the ship
straight toward the two craft ahead,
the League cruiser and the Lightning.
The half-dozen grapple-lines had been
now so far drawn in that there was not
enough room for a third ship to pass
between the two.

  But Sual Av steered the hurtling
Cauphul between the two, anyway.
Space around them seemed blazing
with continuous flares of bursting
atom-shells.

  Crash! The grinding shock that
flung Thorn to the floor of the control-
room seemed to him the end of every-
thing. The Cauphul, rushing in be-
tween the Lightning and the League
cruiser grappling it, sideswiped both
ships with stunning force.

  Thorn tried to clutch a stanchion
and pull himself up, as the control-
room rocked wildly around him. He
heard the triumphant shout of the
bald Venusian clinging to the control-
panel.

  “We’re through, John! We did it!”

  Thorn’s ship had crashed in between
the other two, forcing its way through
and breaking the grapple lines.

  “Blast away, Lana!” yelled Thorn
into the audio. “You’re clear now!”

  Like a streak of light, the silvery
cruiser of the pirate girl shot upward.
And with it cometed the battered
Cauphul, and old Stilicho Keene’s
black ship. The other pirate craft
that had tried to help Lana counter-
attack the League cruisers had been
riddled to helpless wrecks by the
heavy fire of the enemy.

  But the main body of the pirate
fleet had had time to cut away from
their prey during the few minutes of
THE THREE PLANETEERS

41

the furious fight below. They were
shooting out like startled hawks of
space, joining Lana Cain’s cruiser and
the other two as they sped upward.

  “Up to the Zone!” pealed the girl’s
voice from the audio.

MASSING together as they
roared through space, the pi-
rate ships streaked upward through

   “If we can get into the Zone, we
 can lose those cruisers,” Sual Av was
 muttering. “If she’ll just keep going
 until then!”

  Thorn could hear the Cauphul
groaning and creaking beneath the
fierce thrust of her blazing rocket-
tubes. The hull of the ship, weak-
ened by shell-fire and badly strained

the vault. Hot after them raced the
League cruisers, which now outnum-
bered the pirates.

  “What in the devil’s name’s going
on?” roared Gunner Welk’s voice.
“That crash strained our sides—it
looks down here as though the ship

by the side-swiping collision, threat-
ened to crumple up without notice.

  The pirate ships could not match
the heavily armed League cruisers in
fire-power. But one thing the ships
of the Companions of Space did have,
and that was speed. They were draw-
42

STARTLING STORIES

ing slowly away from the hotly pur-
suing cruisers as they rushed upward.

  It was a wild yet thrilling scene to
John Thorn’s eyes! The black vault
of abysmal space around them tapes-
tried with countless blazing stars, the
blinding flares of atom-shells bursting
like exploding lightning, the raving
flame of proton-fire from pursued and
pursuing ships, and the vast, vague
cloud of light-flecks of the Zone
stretching above.

 They were thundering up into the
Zone flow, Lana Cain’s silver ship
leading, curving sharply to avoid the
meteor-swarm directly above. But
the League cruisers were pursuing
them into the vast wilderness of de-
bris.

  “Scatter!” came the girl’s sharp or-
der from the audio. “We’ll rendez-
vous at Turkoon!”

  “That finishes us, John,” said Sual
Av bitterly. “We don’t know the
wave code. We can’t navigate this
damned jungle.”

  But hard on the heels of his words
came a quick call from the girl.

 “Planeteers! Keep your ship with
mine!”

  The pirate ships scattered in all di-
rections, like a frightened flock of
wild fowl. Darting away through the
swarms and planetoids, navigating by
means of the coded wave-signals from
the projectors on every swarm and as-
teroid, they melted away.

  The League fleet could not hope to
pursue all those diverging ships
through the wilderness of debris in
which they were perfectly at home.
But a dozen League cruisers followed
purposefully after Lana’s silver ship
and the Planeteers’ crippled craft as
they raced away through the Zone in
a counter-sunwise direction.

  “Damn them, they must have recog-
nized Lana’s ship and they’re deter-
mined to catch her!” Sual Av ex-
claimed.

 Gunner Welk’s towering space-
suited figure came thrusting hastily
into the control-room.

 “John, the compartment walls are
cracking down there!” exclaimed the
Mercurian. “If they—”

  A thunderous explosion from below

interrupted his words. Instantly, the
CauphuVs acceleration decreased, the
roar of its rocket-tubes sharply dimin-
ished.

 “One power - chamber has ex-
ploded!” yelled an engineer’s voice
from the interphone.

 “We’re sunk!” the big Mercurian
cried.

 “No—Lana’s coming around!” John
Thorn exclaimed.

THEY had been rushing close to
the coast of a far-flung swarm,
with the pirate girl’s silver ship just
ahead, the League cruisers a fair dis-
tance behind, when the explosion had
occurred. Now the silvery Lightning
was darting back around to their side.

  “I’m standing by to take you on!”
Lana cried from the audio-speaker.
“Hurry!”

 “Break open the portside door to
abandon ship!” Thorn yelled into the
interphone. “Cut the tubes, Sual, and
come on!”

 The Planeteers hastened down out
of the control-room through the
wrecked ship. The motley crew of
the Cauphul, all in suits and helmets
like the three comrades, had got the
round door on the portside open.
There was no air now in the whole
ship, and its walls and beams were
sagging and cracking ominously as it
floated on in space under inertia.

  Up to the side of the Cauphul drove
the Lightning. There was no time to
hook on with magnetic grapples or
run out catwalks, for the League
cruisers were coming up along the
edge of the great meteor swarm in hot
pursuit. The Lightning’s starboard
door was open, the silvery ship keep-
ing even with the wreck only a few
yards away.

  “Jump for it!” Thorn yelled to his
crew. “Hurry!”

  Across the gap between ships shot
space-suited figures like human pro-
jectiles, leaping toward the big open
door of the Lightning. Those who
missed the door grabbed lines that had
been flung out, and were hauled in like
floundering fish.

 There was a thundering crash of
metal as a whole section of the Caup-
THE THREE PLANETEERS

43

hul's stern collapsed. The wreck
sagged drunkenly in space, and the
League cruisers were racing closer.

  “This is getting a little too hot for
even the Planeteers!” laughed Sual
Av as he leaped.

  Gunner Welk followed, and John
Thorn jumped last. He felt himself
hurtle floatingly across the gap to-
ward the open door of the Lightning,
infinity below and above him. Then
he hit the edge of the door and a hand
grasped his arm and pulled him in.

  Instantly the Lightning sprang for-
ward with renewed acceleration as its
stern tubes blasted. The door was
ground shut.

 Thorn and his two comrades
climbed to the control-room. When
he entered it, a glance showed him
that they were now pulling steadily
away from their pursuers.

  Lana Cain, her slender figure bulky
in space-suit and helmet, was leaning
beside the Jovian pilot at the firing-
keys. She was listening intently to
the constant buzzing from the section
of the panel that received the naviga-
tion wave-signals.

  “Turn ninety degrees outward, and
fifteen degrees upward. Rimil!” ex-
claimed the girl. “That’ll take us be-
tween swarms where they won’t fol-
low for long.”

  The Lightning curved sharply, shot
between the two vast clouds of dan-
gerous debris.

W O OKING back through the rear
MJ window of the bulging control-
room, Thorn saw two of the pursuing
League cruisers glow red and fall out
of line. They had been meteor-struck.
Trying to cut across after their quarry
without aid of the wave-code naviga-
tion signals, they had blundered into
the edge of one swarm.

  The other League ships slackened
speed, and tried to grope their way
ahead. But the Lightning, dashing on
at full speed and then changing course
abruptly to cut up across a “family” of
whirling planetoids, soon lost them
from sight.

  "Off suits. We’re safe from them
now!" Lana called into the interphone.

  Thorn and his two comrades divested

themselves with relief of their suits
and helmets, as the girl did likewise.

  Lana turned toward the Planeteers.
The girl’s bronze-gold hair was tossed
in disorder, her face flushed, her dark
blue eyes blazing with excitement.
There was something vital and dy-
namic about her, and there was a throb-
bing, eager emotion in her eyes as she
faced Thorn, impulsively holding out
her hand.

 “You Planeteers saved me down
there!” she exclaimed. “If you hadn’t
rammed in between ships and broken
those grapple-lines—”

  John Thorn felt a queer sense of
shame as her warm little hand grasped
his. If she knew his real reason for
taking such desperate chances to save
her, he thought— But it was for four
great worlds.

  “I’ll never forget this, John Thorn,”
Lana was saying earnestly.

  “I’ll never forget it, either," growled
Gunner Welk, rubbing a bruised shoul-
der. “When we wedged between the
two ships it nearly threw me right
through a wall of the gun-deck.”

  Sual Av grinned ruefully. “I’m not
so sure I want to be a raid pirate, if
this kind of thing happens often.”

  “It was a cunning trap set for us
Companions by the League navies,”
declared Lana. “They even actually
loaded those freighters with rich
cargo, knowing we'd have spies watch-
ing who would report that, and that
we’d make an attack when we heard.
And they had those cruisers disguised
as tankers, ready to gun us as soon as
we were busy looting the freighters.”
Her blue eyes flashed. “But we es-
caped their trap! We didn’t lose more
than four of our ships, and we’ve got
a good portion of the freighters’ car-
goes—the cargoes that were to be the
bait of the trap!”

  “If old Stilicho Keene watched
those freighters and tankers sail from
Jupiter why didn’t he suspect their
game?” Thorn asked her keenly. “A
close look at the tankers would have
showed him that they were disguised
cruisers.”

  Lana looked troubled. “I can’t under-
stand why Stilicho didn’t see that.”
She added loyally, “But it can’t be any
44

STARTLING STORIES

fault of his. And, anyway, we got out
safely.”

  “If that League cruiser that grappled
onto you had gunned you, it would
have been the end of you,” John Thorn
told her. "I can’t understand why they
didn’t when they had you helpless.”
“Neither can I,” Lana confessed.
“They must have wanted to' capture
me, and take me to be tried and exe-
cuted as a lesson to the whole system.
If so, they overreached themselves!”

SHE turned to the Jovian pilot, and
ordered, “Straight to Turkoon,
now. There's no danger of more pur-
suit."

 As the Lightning throbbed on
through the Zone, homing toward the
jungle asteroid like all the other scat-
tered pirate ships, John Thorn drew his
two comrades unobtrusively back
down into the privacy of the narrow
corridor below the control-room.

  “There was something damned queer
about that trap the League set!” Thorn
declared. “Their whole object seemed
to be to capture this ship—to capture
Lana—and they took good care not to
fire once at her craft, lest they kill her.”
Sual Av stared, perplexed. “But
why would the League set such an
elaborate trap as that to capture her?”
“Why did we come here to seek out
the girl?” Thorn countered meaningly.
"Because she has a secret that we
want.”

 Gunner Welk started. “You mean
that the League may be after the se-
cret of Erebus, too? That the League
may be trying—”

  “Trying to get that radite on Erebus,
the same as we are?” Thorn finished.
He frowned. “It’s possible. Remember,
we heard that the League planned
some frightful new agent of destruc-
tion to use on the Alliance worlds, to
beat them into submission after they
smash our fleet. Maybe the radite has
something to do with that!"

 Sual Av’s green eyes widened.
“Then it might be a League agent who
put that Ear in your pocket yesterday,
who is working from inside the pirates
as we are and helped plan this trap?
But who is it? Brun Abo, or Jenk
Cheerly, or old Stilicho, maybe?”

   “Whichever it is, if a League agent
is after the girl’s secret, we’ve got to
beat him to it!” burst Gunner. “But
how?”

  “She’ll never tell me the secret. I’m
sure of that, even though she feels
grateful to me now,” Thorn said,
frowning. “But she may have written
down what her father told her about
Erebus. She may have the secret among
her papers.”

  Sual Av’s ugly face stiffened. “You
mean to search her papers? John, it’s
too dangerous! If these pirates caught
you—”

  “I’ve got to take the chance,” Thorn
rapped. “With the League working
against us, there’s no time to lose
now!’’

CHAPTER VIII
Out of the Past

........I,., .,,.1,

    From Mercury to Pluto,

    From Saturn back to Mars,

    We'll fight and sail and blase our trail
    In crimson through the stars.

    We’ll cram our holds with (<lunder
    From every world and moon,

    And thunder back on the homeward track
    To feast at old Turkoon!

THAT song that was roaring now
from hundreds of lusty throats
had been the traditional song of the
space pirates for centuries. Every
corner of the Solar System had shiv-
ered at the sound of it, at one time or
another. It echoed now in a fierce,
swinging chant through the night at
Turkoon Town.

  The pirates and their women were
feasting at rude tables and benches
around a huge fire of dry fern-logs
that blazed in the center of the street.
The tables groaned with enormous
masses of food, huge haunches of
Jovian marsh-steers, rosy canal-fruit
from Mars, sticky confections looted
from Neptunian ships. And there
were platoons of bottles and bulging
casks from every world in the system.
Strong drink was going down with the
food as the Companions celebrated
their partially successful foray.
THE THREE PLANETEERS

45

  Above the firelit feasters stretched
the night sky of the Zone, the most
wonderful in the system, a black can-
opy gaudy with thousands of blazing
stars, with the yellow topaz of Saturn
and the far green emeralds of Uranus
and Neptune blazing high. Comets
moved like mysterious white ghosts
through the jungled heavens, and con-
stantly meteors flashed and ran across
the black sky-span.

  At one of the tables sat Lana Cain,
her smooth hair gleaming like dull
gold in the firelight, her hand absently
patting the neck of the great gray
beast crouched beneath her—Ool, the
space-dog.

  John Thorn sat beside her, his dark
face inscrutable and his black eyes
watchful. Sual Av was feasting
heartily farther down the table, jok-
ing and laughing with the other pirate
captains, while Gunner Welk ate in
brooding silence.

  ‘‘They are like children, the Com-
panions,” the girl said to Thorn over
the din of voices and clatter of bot-
tles. "Already they have forgotten
that they nearly met death in that trap
today, in their rejoicing over the loot
we got.”

  Thorn shrugged. “I can’t say that

I	blame them. An outlaw has to take
his fun when he can—he never knows
whether he’ll see the next day or not.”

  Lana’s blue eyes, dark in the ruddy
firelight, studied Thorn’s lean face
thoughtfully.

  “But you Planeteers are not like
most outlaws, John Thorn,” she said.
“There is something different about
you—something purposeful, I don’t
know what."

  Thorn sensed faint danger, but he
smiled as he fingered a goblet of won-
derful pink Martian glass.

  “The only real purpose we Plane-
teers have is to hunt excitement, I
guess,” he told her. “We've done a
lot of damn fool things, without much
reason.”

  “Thorn, why do you not stay here
with me, with the Companions?”
Lana asked, impulsively grasping his
hand. Her blue eyes eager on his, she
added earnestly. “I have great plans,
and with you Planeteers helping—”

  She was interrupted by a sudden up-
roar in a fierce voice along the table.
Thorn jumped up.

  Old Stilicho Keene was standing,
his rheumy eyes glaring with rage,
his thin, bony hands trembling with
passion as he faced the obese green
Uranian, Jenk Cheerly.

  “Say that again,” shrilled the old
pirate to the Uranian, “and I’ll blow
your lying head off your pig’s body!”
Jenk Cheerly’s small eyes glittered
with hate as he rose to face the en-
raged old Martian.

  “I do say it again!” squeaked the
obese Uranian. “I say it was your
fault that we nearly got trapped by
those League cruisers today! You said
you spied out the freighters and tank-
ers before they blasted from Jupiter.
If you did, you would have been sure
to see those tankers were disguised
battle-cruisers. So you didn’t do it.
Or you knew about the trap, and led
us right into it!”

OLD Stilicho seemed to suffocate
with his own passion. His bony
figure was quivering, his wrinkled face
livid.

  “You’re accusing me of treachery!”
he shrilled. "Me, Stilicho Keene, that’s
rocketed with the Companions for
fifty years! By space, Uranian, no
man can—”

  The old pirate’s clawlike hand was
darting toward the atom-pistol at his
belt. Jenk Cheerly’s fat hand flew to-
ward his own weapon.

  But Lana Cain sprang in between
them. Her eyes were flaming with
wrath.

  “If you draw, I’ll blast you both
down! ’ she flared. “You know our
rule—no quarreling among ourselves!”
“But, lass, you heard what he ac-
cused me of!" shrilled the old pirate,
outraged. “I tell you, when I saw those
tankers as they sailed from Jupiter,
they were tankers, nothing else.”
“Isn’t it likely that real tankers did
sail with the freighters,” John Thorn
said quietly, “to deceive any spies who
might be watching them take off, and
that the tankers were replaced by the
disguised battle-cruisers at some se-
cret rendezvous in space?”
46

STARTLING STORIES

  Kinnel King, the handsome middle-
aged Earthman captain, nodded quick-
ly. “That must be the explanation.”
“That may be so,” grumbled Jenk
Cheerly in his squeaky voice, “but I
still say there was something queer
about it. We should have got all the
cargoes of those freighters, instead of
just part of them.”

  Stilicho Keene stiffened again, but
Lana hastily intervened to calm the
old pirate.

  “You’ve forgotten to initiate the
Planeteers into the Companions, Stil-
icho,” she reminded. “The Eight Gob-
lets!”

  The old man’s face slowly cleared,
and he turned around to Thorn and
Sual Av and Gunner Welk.

  “That’s right,” he cackled. “You
boys ain’t real pirates till you’ve drunk
the Eight Goblets. Eh, Companions?”
A roaring shout of laughter rose
from the fierce-faced corsairs and their
women gathered at the firelit tables.

  “Yes, the Goblets! The Eight Gob-
lets for the Planeteers!”

  “What the devil is this?” growled
Gunner Welk suspiciously. “If they
try any of their tricks on me—”

  Under cover of the roar of laughing
voices, Thorn spoke in a rapid, low
voice to his two comrades, as they
three stood close together behind the
tables. They were momentarily un-
watched, for all the mirthfully shout-
ing pirates were watching old Stilicho
as he supervised the preparations for
the coming ceremony.

  “I’m going to try my plan of search-
ing Lana’s papers tonight!” Thorn
told his comrades swiftly. “If she ever
wrote down what her father told her
about Erebus, she’d surely still have
it.”

  “John, it’ll be deadly dangerous!”
warned Gunner Welk in a taut under-
tone. “Remember, someone here
knows what we’re after.”

  “Yes, whoever put that Ear in your
pocket must be watching us all the
time,” muttered Sual Av.

  “I’ll never have a better chance than
tonight, with everyone present at the
feast,” Thorn whispered. “You two
stick here—it would awake suspicion
if all three of us left.”

HE stopped whispering abruptly
as the roar of laughing voices
began to lessen. Old Stilicho had held
up a hand to quiet the pirate throng.

  “Planeteers,” he shrilled to the three
comrades, “you’ve got a great name in
the system, and you showed today you
deserve it, for you saved our Lana
from that trap when no one else could
have done it. We’re proud and glad
to welcome you three among us. Eh,
Companions?”

  “Yes!” roared back the pirate feast-
ers with one voice. Lana was sitting
again, smiling at Thorn’s puzzled face.

  “But before you can really be of the
Companions,” the old pirate contin-
ued in his shrill, cracked voice,
“you’ve got to drink the Eight Gob-
lets, in proper order—to show that as
a true Companion you defy the gov-
ernments and navies of all the eight
inhabited worlds!”

  Three grinning pirates advanced,
each carrying a tray on which rested
eight small glass goblets filled with
various colored liquors.

 Sual Av’s green eyes widened.
“Are we expected to—”

  Stilicho Keene cackled. “Yes, lads.
You’re expected to drink defiance to
the eight worlds as we call them off.”
Thorn and his two comrades took
the little goblets first handed them.
They were brimming with colorless
rock-liquor, the fiery distillate that is
the favorite drink of Mercury.

  Stilicho, grinning, raised his bony
hand. And from the firelit feasters
crashed a mirthful shout.

  “Mercury!”

  The Planeteers tossed off the burn-
ing liquor. It seared Thorn’s throat,
but Gunner Welk smacked his lips.

  “Venus!” crashed the shout an in-
stant later.

  Down went the little goblets of
heady black Venusian swamp-grape
wine. And the pirate horde, without
giving the Planeteers time to catch
breath, called out planet after planet.

  A goblet of tingling brown Earth
whisky; another of suave, smooth des-
ert-flower cordial from Mars; and a
bumper of raw, potent marsh-apple
brandy from Jupiter followed each
other.
THE THREE PLANETEERS

47

  Thorn gasped for air, but neither he
nor his comrades hesitated. A goblet
of musty-tasting wine from the fun-
gus-fTuits of Saturn; another of sour,
strong Uranian beer; and finally a last
goblet of sweet, cloying Neptunian
sacra liqueur.

  Thorn’s head was spinning as he
smashed the last of the eight goblets
on the ground. Sual Av was stagger-
ing, and even Gunner Welk looked un-
steady. Old Stilicho slapped Thorn’s
back.

  “You’re true Companions of Space
now, Planeteers,” cackled the old pi-
rate, and approving roars went up
from the crowd.

  Every pirate there knew it was the
Planeteers who had saved their idol-
ized girl leader in the fight that day.
The heartiness of their lusty welcome
was unmistakable.

  Thorn fought to keep the liquor
from overcoming him, as he went back
to his seat beside Lana. His senses
were hazed—he was only dimly aware
that now wild music was thrumming
from stringed instruments somewhere,
and that two white-limbed Venusian
girls were swaying in a languorous
dance near the blazing fire.

  Gradually, Thorn felt his senses
clear. But he took care to appear still
fogged. Now was the time for his at-
tempt !

  "I need some air after the Eight
Goblets,” he told Lana, keeping his
voice thick. “I’m going for a walk.”
To his discomfiture, Lana rose from
her place and took his arm. “I’ll walk
with you, John Thorn.” she smiled.

THORN could not reject her,
though inwardly he chafed. They
moved away from the firelit feast, the
space-dog Ool padding silently beside
the girl. None of the crowd seemed to
notice them leaving, for now a lithe
red Martian girl was twisting in a furi-
ous desert dance, to the roaring ap-
plause of the Companions.

  The roar of shouts and laughter and
crashing glass behind them faded
away as they walked a little down the
dark, silent and dusty street of Tur-
koon Town. The blazing sky above
them seemed alive with the long, shin-
ing trails of flashing meteors.

  Thorn looked down at the girl’s
gold head. Her starlit white face
seemed softer now, with a queer yearn-
ing in it as she gazed along the dark
street. It all seemed strangely dream-
like to the Earthman—he and the
pirate girl and the green-eyed, pad-
ding space-dog walking together un-
der the meteor-blazoned night sky.

  Lana Cain looked up at him and
asked the question that she had al-
ready voiced earlier that evening.

 “Why don’t you Planeteers stay
here with us, John Thorn? With you
to help, my plans could—”

  ‘‘Your plans?” he repeated, inter-
rupting. “What do you mean, Lana?”
She stopped and looked up at him.
“Do you think that being leader of
the pirates is all I want? No, that is
only a means to an end. I have a
dream, the same dream my father had
—a dream of making the Zone a place
of orderly life and happy cities, in-
stead of just a wild, lawless jungle.”
Her words came with an eager rush.
“There are hundreds of asteroids in
the Zone that are habitable or could
be made habitable. A whole new world,
that could be independent and self-
sufficient, and could be a refuge for
oppressed people from all parts of the
system, people fleeing from tyranny
and injustice.”

  Lana's voice throbbed with earnest-
ness. “My father worked with that
dream in mind, organized the scat-
tered bands of pirates and made them
temper their bloodthirsty ways. I’ve
worked toward that goal, too. And
now, when the League of Cold Worlds
is about to attack the Inner Alliance,
the chance is coming to make that
dream come true. For with interplane-
tary war going on, we could organize
our new world in the Zone without
interference! And millions of people
may want a safe refuge.”

  Thorn was impressed by the girl’s
sincerity and breadth of ambition.

  “But, Lana, are all the eight worlds
as bad as you seem to think?” he said
slowly. “It’s true the four worlds of
the League are crushed under the
fanatical tyranny of Haskell Trask,
their dictator, but what about Earth
and the other three inner worlds?
They have no tyranny or oppression.”
“They have black injustice that is as
bad as tyranny,” answered Lana, her
starlit face hardening. “Look at what
they did to my father!"

  Thorn saw that he could not change
her bitter obsession on that subject.
He shook his head.

  “Perhaps you’re right," he said.
And he added thoughtfully, “I was
wondering why a girl like you was
content to live as leader of these wild
pirates. But I understand, now that
you’ve told me of your scheme.”

 “And you’ll help me make that
dream come true, John Thorn? You
Planeteers will stay?" Lana asked
eagerly. She added earnestly, “You’re
the first one I’ve ever told of my plan.’’
Thorn was touched. “I’ll have to
talk to Sual Av and Gunner Welk be-
fore I can promise to stay,” he evaded.

  He put his hand to his head, and
winced. “I’m not feeling so good yet,
after those Eight Goblets. I think I’ll
pass up the rest of the feast, and sleep
it off."

  “You’re not ill?” Lana asked anx-
iously. “If you are—”

SHE was gazing up at him, her dark
eyes wide with worry in her star-
lit face, her hand on his shoulder.
Thorn felt a sudden strong impulse
THE THREE PLANETEERS

49

to kiss her. He mastered himself, but
he suspected that his feelings had
shown in his face, for Lana’s expres-
sion changed.

  “I—I must go back to the feast," she
said, with an unaccustomed shyness.
“If I am not there, they will be quar-
reling. I will see you in the morning."

  He watched her move back down the
dark street toward the firelit feast, the
space-dog silently accompanying her.
Then Thorn turned and walked with
assumed unsteadiness to his cabin.
But instead of entering the cabin, he
slipped around it, and then hastened
along the back of the street toward
the Council House.

  The long, low metal building was
dark and silent. Thorn listened out-
side a back door, then pushed stealthi-
ly inside. The dull red ray of his
pocket fluoric flash-lamp lighted him
through store-rooms and a kitchen.
The place was deserted.

HE found Lana's bedroom quickly.
It was a bare chamber with a
chromaloy cot and chest, and a rack
of atom-pistols on the wall. There was
a closet, to which Thorn went first. In
it hung a dozen suits of the mannish
silk jackets and trousers the pirate
girl always wore. But in the back of
the closet, Thorn found a single gay-
ly-flowered flowing tunic-dres6 of the
type worn by Earth women to social
functions.

  A queer wave of tenderness swept
him as he touched the gay, flowered
dress. It was obviously unworn. He
could picture Lana taking it secretly
from pirate loot, trying it on—

  “Hell, am I going soft on the girl?”
John Thorn muttered to himself. “I’m
wasting time!”

  He searched through the big chest.
In it he found a flat viridium box that
was packed with papers.

  Thorn’s pulses raced as he hastily
started scanning the papers by his lit-
tle ray of dull red light. The first he
unfolded was a parchment document,
discolored with age. It was a captain’s
commission in the Earth Navy, dated
over forty years before, made out to
Martin Cain. Across it was stamped
“CANCELLED.”

  Most of the other papers were old
letters of Lana’s father. They told
nothing. Then Thorn muttered an ex-
clamation as he took out of the box a
thick log-book, bound in marsh-calf
skin, and filled with the square, pre-
cise writing of Martin Cain.

 Swiftly Thorn riffled the pages
until he found the year he was look-
ing for. With taut eagerness he read
the entries.

  9-27. (Off Pluto.) It looks as though our
raid on the Pluto mining bases with a single
ship was too daring. We are being hotly
pursued by Neptunian cruisers, and can hear
the audio-calls of others.

  9-28. Fear net is closing in on us. Space
alive with audio calls.

  9-29. I, Martin Cain, am sole survivor of
my ship’s company. We were trapped and
attacked at 7:22, sun-time, by eight Nep-
tunian cruisers. We got two, but the rest
gunned us till our power-charnbers exploded
and tore our ship apart. I was flung clear,
and found one of our lifeboats that also had
been thrown clear. Got away in it unno-
ticed. But am far outside Pluto’s orbit,
whore they had chased us. Dare not go back
to Pluto, and have not half enough fuel to
take me to Saturn, the next nearest world
sunward.

  9-30. I am taking a desperate chance—
am heading OUTWARD, toward Erebus. I
know no one has ever yet visited that world
and returned, but my last chance is to get
fuel-ores there, for it is far nearer than Sat-
urn. I greatly fear that I shall never get
back to the Zone to see my little girl and
my wife again.

  Thorn turned to the next entry, his
pulse poundiag with excitement. But
the next entry was dated weeks later.

  12-7. Back to the Zone again, thank God,
thank God! I shall never go beyond Pluto’s
orbit again.

  Thorn desperately ran through the
following pages. But there was no
mention whatever in them of Erebus.

 Why had not Martin Cain made one
entry about his visit to Erebus? What
was there on that far, dark, mysterious
planet that Cain had so carefully kept
secret?

  “Raise your hands, John Thorn!”

  Thorn turned, appalled. Lights had
flashed on in the little room. Stand-
ing in the doorway were two men.

 They were Jenk Cheerly, the fat
Uranian, and the Earthman, Kinnel
50

STARTLING STORIES

King. They were covering him with
atom-pistols, and their faces were
deadly.

CHAPTER IX
Imprisoned Planeteers

THORN rose slowly to his feet,
keeping his hands raised. A wrong
movement, he knew, would mean in-
stant death. Inwardly he was bitter-
ly reproaching himself for letting
himself be surprised.

  "So, Planeteer,” said Kinnel King
in a deadly low tone, “you and your
comrades seem to be traitors. Less
than an hour after you’ve been
initiated into the Companions, we find
you here rifling Lana’s secrets.”
“Didn’t I tell you, Kinnel?”
squeaked Jenk Cheerly, the fat Uran-
ian’s little eyes glittering with beady
triumph. “Didn’t I tell you this Thorn
was up to something when he slipped
away from the feast, and that we
ought to follow him?”

 “Take his atom-pistol, Jenk,”
ordered Kinnel King without remov-
ing his eyes from Thorn. "Then go
and get Lana and the others—and
make sure you get the other two
Planeteers!”

  Jenk Cheerly lifted the weapon
from Thorn’s pelt, and then the obese
Uranian waddled hastily out of the
room. Thorn stood, his hands still
raised, facing the other Earthman.

  Kinnel King’s middle-aged, hand-
some face was dark with loathing, and
there was a deadly expression in his
brooding eyes as he watched the
Planeteer.

  "King, listen to me!” John Thorn
said desperately. “You’re an Earth-
man, and I—”

  “Be silent!” Kinnel King hissed, his
eyes narrowing to pinpoints. "I’ll
blast you where you stand, traitor.”

  In heavy silence, Thorn waited. He
knew there was not the slightest
chance for him to make a break under
the muzzle of the other’s weapon. To
do so would be merely to commit sui-
cide without gaining anything.

  Presently there was a rapid tramp
of many feet, an excited babel of
voices entering the Council House.
Into the lighted rooms came Lana
Cain, and with her were old Stilicho.
Brun Abo, the Jovian captain, and
the waddling, gloating green-faced
Uranian, Jenk Cheerly.

  With them came four pirates who
held atom-pistols against the backs of
Gunner Welk and Sual Av. Gunner’s
clothing was torn, his temple bleeding
from a wound, his cold blue eyes like
icy flames. Sual Av’s ugly face was
taut and watchful.

  “They’d never have got us, John,”
rumbled the big Mercurian as they
entered, “if they hadn’t jumped us
from behind.”

  “It’s all my fault,” Thorn said bit-
terly.

  Lana Cain was looking at Thorn.
The girl’s face was white and stunned,
her blue eyes wide and unbelieving.
Then as her gaze swung from Thorn’s
face to the rifled papers on the floor,
her expression changed to one of flam-
ing wrath.

  “It’s true, then,” she whispered
throbbingly to Thorn. “You are a trai-
tor to the Companions, a paltry thief
trying to steal my secrets. And I know
what you were after!” she flared. “The
secret of Erebus! Because I wouldn’t
tell it to you, you slipped in here, try-
ing to steal it.”

  “Lana, listen—” Thorn began with
desperate earnestness.

LANA cut him off with a stinging
slap across the face. The space-
dog Ool jumped forward, great eyes
blazing.

  “All the time you were listening to
my plans, pretending sympathy, you
were only thinking of how you could
get that secret from me!” flamed Lana.
“I wouldn’t tell it to you, because I
didn’t want you or anybody else to go
to that terrible world. I almost wish
now that I’d told you, that I’d let you
go blundering out to Erebus to meet
the horrible fate you’d meet there!”
“What are we waiting for? Why
don’t we blast these dogs down now?”
demanded Brun Abo, the scarred-
faced Jovian.
THE THREE PLANETEERS

51

  A fierce growl of approval of the
suggestion went up from the other
pirate captains. Even old Stilicho
Keene was looking at Thorn and his
two comrades with accusation in his
face.

  “Boy, I never thought you Plane-
teers would do a thing like this," said
the old pirate dismally.

  Thorn was thinking with desperate
rapidity. Should he tell Lana the
truth, that they Planeteers were
agents of Earth who only sought the
Erebus secret to get the radite that
would save the Alliance?

  He saw that it would gain nothing
to tell. It would make no difference
to the girl, who was so bitter against
Earth she would do nothing to help
that world. And it would give away
the great secret that the Alliance had
a weapon with which it might be able
to resist the League attack.

  “Lana, listen to me,” Thorn said
rapidly. “I’m not denying that we
Planeteers came here seeking the
secret of Erebus. We have a vital rea-
son for wanting it, and when you
wouldn’t tell it, I -had to try to steal
it. I admit all that.

  “But I want to warn you that there’s
someone else here—someone right
here in this room now, if I’m right,
who means to get that secret and use
it to take millions of lives. You can
save all those lives by giving us the
secret and letting us go!”

“You pile one lie on another!”
blazed Lana. “You try to cover your
own guilt by accusing innocent men!”
“Let’s take them out and blast them
down .now!” cried Brun Abo.

 “It’s the penalty for treachery
among the Companions,” old Stilicho
said miserably. “I guess we got to do
it.”

  Lana Cain paled a little. She shook
her head.

  “No, we’ll not kill them now,” she
said. “Put them in the brig until
morning.”

 “And why shouldn’t we kill them
now?” demanded Brun Abo of her.
“Is it possible you’ve a tenderness for
this Thorn?”

  The girl turned on the Jovian, as
though stung.

  “I’ve only hate for such treacherous
liars!” she flared. “But we're going to
execute them, not murder them. In
the morning is soon enough.”

 Surprisingly, Jenk Cheerly sup-
ported her.

 “Lana's right,” the Uranian
squeaked and the girl glanced grate-
fully at him.

 Thorn tried to speak again, but
Brun Abo snarled an order, and the
four pirates covering the Planeteers
forced the three comrades to march
out of the Council House into the
night.

  The brig, as the pirates called their
prison, was a small, square, metal
structure behind the main street of
Turkoon Town. It had but one room,
into whose dark interior they were
rudely thrust. The heavy metal door
slammed, and the wave-lock clicked.

  “Make the best of your time till
morning, Planeteers,” rasped Brun
Abo as he and his men left.

  “John, they didn’t leave any guards
outside,” said Sual Av quickly in the
darkness. “Maybe we can get out.”

THEY rapidly inspected their pris-
on. £ it Thorn found that there
was no cha.:ce whatever of escape
from it.

 The building •vas wholly con-
structed of inertrum, ri.ost intractable
of metals. The two tiny, barred win-
dows were mere loophol.’s, and the
wave-lock of the door couid only be
operated by the secret frequencies of
its wave-key applied from the out-
side.

  “There’s no getting out of here,”
grunted Gunner Welk. “Damn that
fat Jenk Cheerly! It was he who sus-
pected you were up to something,
John, and followed you with Kinnel
King.”

  “Either. Cheerly or Brun Abo must
be the League spy here!” Sual Av
declared tensely. “And it looks to me
as though Cheerly is the man. He only
joined the pirates recently, and it was
he who tipped them off about the
Jovian freighters, the League trap
that nearly succeeded in capturfng
Lana.”

 “What the devil are we going to
52

STARTLING STORIES

do?” demanded the big Mercurian.
“We can’t break out of this place and
we're due to be blasted at dawn.”
“There’s only one chance left us,”
Thorn rapped. “When they take us
out in the morning, we’ll make a break
and try to seize Lana. I don’t think
the pirates would take a chance of
hurting her by firing at us then. We
might get away with her.”

  Gunner Welk’s rumbling voice came
slowly, “But the girl might get hurt
in the fight, John. I thought you were
sort of in love with her.”

  “Yes,” added Sual Av, “and it looked
to me as though she was beginning to
feel the same way about you.”

  “Are you two space-struck to say
such things?” Thorn demanded fierce-
ly. “Me, in love with that wild pirate
girl?”

  Then his voice wavered a little.
"Even if I did love her, I’d have to
forget it. For we have to get that
secret out of her somehow, if the Al-
liance is to have a chance. That is big-
ger and more important than every-
body in the entire zone.”

  “AH right, we’ll try it,” rumbled
Gunner Welk. “It looks like our last
bet.”

PRESENTLY he Lnd Sual Av
were sleeping ou the floor calmly
oblivious to whatever fate the dawn
might bring.

  But John Thorn could not sleep.
Restlessly he paced the darkness of
the little metal room. In his mind
queenly persisted the image of Lana’s
white, stunned face and accusing eyes.
He tried to drive that reproachful face
from his thoughts and couldn’t-
White mists from the jungles had
seeped into Turkoon Town as the
night advanced, a cold fog that nipped
the bones.

  A little wind moaned through the
dark, sleeping pirate stronghold, and
at intervals came raucous calls of
weird life teeming in the fern-forest.

  Thorn heard a ship blasting off from
the distant field, the thudding thunder
of its tubes rapidly dying away. He
wondered broodingly if ever he and
his two comrades would see space
again.

  Or was the coming dawn to end for-
ever the career of the Planeteers?

  Hours dragged past, and finally a
faint dawn light began to illumine the
swirling gray mists outside. Suddenly
through the fog came a wild, distant
cry. It was echoed in a minute by raw
shouts in other voices.

  Thorn leaped to the little window,
but could see nothing through the
mists. He heard his comrades scram-
bling up.

 “What’s happened?” exclaimed
Sual Av, rubbing his eyes sleepily.

  “I don’t know!” Thorn cried. “But
something’s wrong.”

  He could hear a babel of raging
shouts and calls crackling like flame
through Turkoon Town, waking
everyone. And men were running
through the clearing mists toward the
field of ships.

  “Stilicho!" yelled Thorn through
the window as he glimpsed the old
Martian pirate running painfully
along the street.

  The old man hesitated, then hob-
bled quickly over to the window of
the little prison. He was buckling on
his atom-pistols with trembling hands,
and his wrinkled face was wild.

 “What’s happened?” Thorn de-
manded tensely.

 “Lana — she s been kidnaped!”
hissed the old Martian. “Jenk Cheer-
ly did it some time last night.”

 “Lana kidnaped?” Thorn yelled
wildly, his brown face suddenly hag-
gard. “How do you know Cheerly did
it?”

 “This morning one of our men
found our guards at the ship-field ly-
ing murdered!” babbled the raging old
man. “And one of Cheerly’s Uranian
crew, too—fatally wounded and left
for dead. The Uranian boasted about
what Cheerly had done, before he
died.

  “He said that Cheerly was not any
pirate at all, like he pretended, but a
League spy—the head of Haskell
Trask’s secret service! He said
Cheerly had planned the trap that
nearly captured Lana in the attack on
them freighters, and that when that
failed, Cheerly had used another plan
to kidnap Lana last night. He used
THE THREE PLANETEERS

53

you in his plan, John Thorn!”

  “Cheerly used me to kidnap Lana?”
Thorn gasped. “My God, man, what
are you talking about?”

  “Lana’s soft on you,” spat old Stili-
cho. “She didn’t want to see you
blasted this morning, and Cheerly
knew it. So, according to that dying
Uranian, Cheerly told Lana that he'd
help you Planeteers escape if she re-
leased you. He got Lana to start
secretly with him to this brig to let
you out, and once he had her alone
like that, he and his men grabbed her.
They blasted down the field-guards
and took her in his ship. He’s taking
her to Saturn!”

THE raging old pirate turned from
the window. “We're going to fol-
low Cheerly’s ship. And God help
that Uranian when we catch up with
him!”

  “Stilicho, wait—” Thorn cried wild-
ly, but the old pirate was already hob-
bling urgently away in the mists.

  A few moments later came the thun-
derous roar of many ships taking off
in the distance. As it died away,
Thorn turned to his comrades, his face
stricken.

  “She was going to help us escape,”
he said in a slow, choked voice. “Even
after I’d tried to steal her secret, she
was going to help us get away. And

because of that, she’s in the hands ot
Haskell Trask’s spymaster now!”

  His eyes were wild. ‘‘Think of what
Trask and that fat fiend Cheerly wilf
do to her to wring the secret out oi
her! And all because of rrte. She’d
never have been kidnaped if she hadn’t
tried to help me!”

  “It's not your fault, John,” rumbled
Gunner Welk, his hard face showingt
his emotion. “Cheerly would have-
found one way or another to get hold
of her, even if we’d never come here.”
“And Stilicho and Kinnel King and
all the rest of those pirates are trail-
ing him now,” Sual Av added quickly.
“They’ll catch him and bring the girl
back all right.”

  “I hope to heaven they do,” mut-
tered the big Mercurian. “For if they
fail, and Cheerly gets that girl to Sa-
turn, it means that the League, and
not the Alliance, will get that radite
from Erebus.”

  Thorn started violently. For the
moment, in his first wild concern for
Lana’s safety, he had forgotten the
larger issue.

  “The last hope of the Alliance is
gone if that happens!” he exclaimed.
His fists clenched convulsively. “And
we’re locked up here! Isn’t there
something we can do?”

  “Nothing but wait,” answered Gun-
ner heavily.	(Turn Page)

STARTLING STORIES

  The long hours of that day were a
torture infinitely prolonged to John
Thorn. Pacing the little room, peer-
ing tensely from the wihdow, he
waited in terrible suspense.

  They were not brought any food or
water. They had been completely for-
gotten for the time being in the
greater catastrophe. They could see
the street of Turkoon Town thronged
with excited pirate women and men
who had been left behind by the hasty
expedition that had thundered forth
in chase of Jenk Cheerly.

 Night came, and more hours
dragged past. Then from the distance
came the thudding thunder of many
ships landing.

  “They’re back!” Thom cried tautly.
“But did they rescue Lana?”

  ‘‘We’ll soon know,” muttered Sual
Av.

 They heard the pirate crews and
captains trooping back into town,
heard a loud uproar of voices. They
waited tensely.

  Then a thin, snow-haired figure ap-
proached their window in the star-
light. It was old Stilicho Keene, mov-
ing slowly.

 "Did you bring Lana back?” Thorn
cried.

 The old man’s cracked voice was
unsteady and choking with emotion as
he answered.

  “No, we didn’t.” His accents became
shrill and wild. “We were only a few
hours behind Cheerly’s ship—we
could see it in our ’scopes and were
sure to overtake him. And then he
was joined by a force of fifty League
cruisers, as an escort.

  “He must have had secret arrange-
ments with them cruisers to be wait-
ing for him, damn him!” Stilicho con-
tinued. "We only had twenty ships.
I wanted to keep after them anyway,
and fight it out, but Brun Abo and the
rest said it would be suicide f*

TILICHO’S old voice broke. “I
guess they were right, maybe.
Getting ourselves all killed wouldn’t
have saved Lana. Nothing can save
her now—and I don’t want to live any
more, with the lass gone.”

  Tremulous tears were glistening on

the old Martian’s starlit face. He
wiped them with a quivering hand.

 Thorn felt a cold, ghastly shock
from what he had heard. Blind emo-
tion surged in him. And then the in-
stinct to fight back, to persevere, rose
to dominate him.

  “Are you going to give up Lana for
dead?” he demanded fiercely of the
old man outside. “Are you just going
weep like a woman for her, or are you
going to do something?”

  “What can I do?” Stilicho quavered.
“I’d give my life for the lass, but
there’s nobody can 6ave her now. She’s
in Haskell Trask’s dungeons on Sa-
turn, by now, and a thousand men
couldn’t get her out of there.”

 “A thousand men might not, but
three men could!” Thorn flashed
fiercely. “We three—we Planeteers!”
Stilicho stared hopelessly. “How
could even you Planeteers hope to
snatch her from the claws of Haskell
Trask?”

 “We’ve done things as seemingly
impossible as that in the past, haven't
we?” Thorn demanded. “Give us the
chance, Stilicho, and we’ll get her out
of there or die trying!”

  The old Martian’s eyes widened. “If
anybody could do it, you Planeteers
could,” he muttered. He stared doubt-
fully at Thorn’s starlit face. “But you
Planeteers are only after the secret
Lana knows, the same as Cheerly.”
“We want that secret, yes,” Thorn
said tensely. “But the only way we
can hope to get it is by rescuing Lana!
Can’t you see that? I’m hoping that
if we save her, she‘ll tell us the 9ecret.
But whether she does or not, she’ll
have been saved, and that’s all that you
care for!”

 And as Stilicho still hesitated,
Thorn hissed a grim reminder.

 “Think what Cheerly will do to
Lana to wring the secret from her!
Haskell Trask isn’t above torture!”
The old man’s figure quivered at
that.

  “She’ll never tell them,” he mut-
tered, “even though they kill her. I
know Lana.”

  Then the old pirate stiffened with
decision, and he spoke rapidly to the
tensely waiting three.
THE THREE PLANETEERS

55

  “I’m going to take the chance you
Planeteers can save her. It looks like
the only chance the lass has got. I’m
going to release you, and we’ll head
out in my ship for Saturn, before Brun
Abo and the rest find out what I've
done.”

  “Will the crew of your ship follow
you?” Thorn asked quickly, his pulses
pounding with excitement and hope.

  “Hell, they’d sail straight into the
sun if I laid the course!” exclaimed
the old pirate. His cracked voice
throbbed with eagerness as he con-
tinued. “I’ll have to steal the wave-
key of this brig from the Council
House to let you out. And I’ll pass a
whisper to my crew to gather in the
Venture at once.”

THE old Martian hastened away
through the starlight. John Thorn
swung round to his comrades.

  “It’s a fighting chance we’ve got
now, at least!” he exclaimed.

  “A pretty slim one,” said Gunner
Welk somberly. “How in hell’s name
are we to get that girl away from Sa-
turn in the teeth of all the League
forces? An army couldn’t do it.”

  “We’ll have to do what an army
couldn’t, then,” Thorn said grimly.
“There must be some way.”

  Presently they glimpsed Stilicho
Keene hastening back to their prison.
At the old Martian’s heels followed a
great, gray shape with blazing green
eyes—Lana's space-dog, Ool.

  Stilicho turned the wave-key’s beam
on the lock. The frequencies actuated
the delicate mechanism, and the door
opened.

  “I had a time stealing the wave-
key!” panted the old man as Thorn
and his comrades emerged. “Brun
Abo and the rest are up in the Council
House. As soon as they remember you
three, they’ll be here to have you exe-
cuted.”

 “Why did you bring the space-
dog?” Gunner asked.

  “I didn’t bring him—he followed
me,” Stilicho said. “He’s been wild
since Lana was kidnaped, and I think
he senses we’re going after her. The
critters are a little telepathic, you
know.”

  “Let him come along—we don’t
want to arouse any commotion,”
Thorn said swiftly. “Is your crew
waiting at the ship?”

  “All ready, by now,” the old pirate
replied. “Follow me. We’ll have to
slip out to the field without being
seen.”

  He led the Planeteers through the
starlight, close against the towering,
dark wall of fern-jungle that encircled
Turkoon Town. By that circuitous
route they reached the field where the
massed pirate ships lay glinting under
the meteor-blazoned sky. The big
space-dog padded beside them as they
approached the Venture.

  They climbed hastily into the long
black ship, the animal following them.
Stilicho’s motley crew were waiting.
The doors were already grinding shut
as the Planeteers followed the old
pirate up to the control-room.

  A few moments later, with a thun-
derous blast of fire, the Venture shot
skyward on its desperate mission.

CHAPTER X
Under Saturn’s Rings

A HARP-STRING tenseness
gripped the four men in the Ven-
ture’s control-room as they peered
ahead into space.

  “So far, so good,” muttered old Sti-
licho Keene, leaning forward over the
bank of firing-keys to gaze with faded
eyes. “We’re past the outer League
patrols. Now if we can only slip
through the inner.”

  “We’re in their zone now,” John
Thorn warned tautly. “See anything
in the ’scope, Gunner?”

  “Not yet,” the big Mercurian rum-
bled without taking his eyes from the
eyepiece.

  The Venture moved steadily on
through the void, its rockets cut down
to a low, soft purr. The aura-chart
was dead. They were running blind
so their own aura would not cut the
aura of any vigilant patrol cruiser and
give them away unnecessarily.

  Saturn bulked colossal in the star-
56

STARTLING STORIES

gemmed vault ahead, an enormous,
yellowish sphere encircled by its im-
mense, sweeping white rings. Even
from this distance of a few million
miles, the mighty rings looked quite
solid. The thin black gap between the
two outermost rings, Cassini’s divi-
sion, stood out sharp and clear. It was
hard to realize that those great, solid-
seeming white bands were really vast
swarms of tiny satellites circling the
planet.

  Out beyond even the huge rings
marched the planet’s nine brilliant
moons. Titan was a bright little disk
far on the other side of the spinning
monster world. Tethys and Rhea
shone to the left. And Iapetus, a
bright white moon almost as large as
Mercury, lay close ahead on the right.

 “The Satumian Navy has a big
outer base on Iapetus,” warned Thorn.
“It’ll be alive with cruisers now that
the navies of all four League planets
are concentrated here.”

  “I know, but we got to run close to
Iapetus if we’re going to slip around
to the night side of Saturn,” quavered
the old Martian pirate.

  “Keep at least two million miles out,
to clear the auras of the base,” Thorn
told him.

  The Venture purred on, and the big
white moon began to march slowly
past on their right. The Planeteers and
the old pirate were silent and strained.

  Sual Av scratched his head ir-
ritably. “Curse me if I can get used
to this wig,” he muttered.

  The Venusian’s appearance was cur-
iously changed. His bald pate had
been covered by a wig of short, coarse
black hair, and his face and skin had
been stained pale green. John Thorn
and Gunner Welk were similarly
transformed. Their faces too were
now a livid green, and the Mercurian’s
bristling yellow hair was dyed black.

  The people of Saturn, and also of
Uranus and Neptune, had acquired
their peculiar green complexion dur-
ing the past thousand years. Their
worlds, like all the others in the sys-
tem, had first been colonized by
pioneering Earthmen in the 21st cen-
tury, though a few centuries later all
those seven colonized worlds had se-

ceded from Earth and become inde-
pendent planets. In the generations
since the first colonization, environ-
ment had gradually changed the orig-
inal Earth stock.

  The men of Jupiter had grown into
a squat, great-boned race, because of
the dragging gravitation of their
world. The men of Mars had acquired
their red skin because of the pre-
dominance of certain metallic ele-
ments in their air and food. And sim-
ilarly, the men of Saturn and Uranus
and Neptune, because of a lack of cer-
tain elements on their worlds, had ac-
quired their characteristic jaundiced
green complexion.

THORN and his two comrades had
realized that disguise was vitally
necessary for their daring venture on
Saturn. So, during the days that the
Venture had hurtled at top speed to-
ward the far ringed world, the Plane-
teers had worked to make themselves
look as much as possible like Saturn-
ians.

 Now the Venture was well past
Iapetus, and swinging around to the
night side of Saturn in a great para-
bola.

  “Shall we pass under the rings?”
asked the old Martian pirate, turning
from the firing-keys.

  Thorn nodded. “It’ll keep us in
shadow by going under them. Better
cling close beneath them.”

  Saturn filled all space before them
now, looming colossal in the firma-
ment with the tilted plane of its outec
gigantic ring shadowing above them
as their ship shot beneath it. The ring,
more than thirty thousand miles in
width, was brightly sunlit on its upper
side because of the tilt of its plane,
but here beneath it they were in
shadow.

  Space above them was now roofed as
far as the eye could stretch by the
white, gleaming, concentric rings. At
this close distance they could clearly
see the millions of separate satellites
that made up the rings, vast circular
swarms of tiny planetoids endlessly
whirling. Then they were in past the
rings, and only six thousand miles
from the nighted surface of Saturn.
THE]^RE^^ANETEERS

57

  Stilicho Keene pointed a bony fin-
ger toward a misty glow of lights that
lay slightly north of the equator.

  ‘•Them’s the lights of Satumopolis”
the old piratel&Bare&.NArTO

 “Run westward,” John Thorn or-
dered. “The fungus forests are in that
direction, and if we three are to pose
as s/if/j-hunters, that’s where we need
to land.”

  The first Planeteer watched with
emotion as the distant lights of Sa-
turnopolis slid away to the left. Down
there in the great capital city of Sa-
turn, somewhere, was Lana Cain. She
would likely be prisoned in the citadel
of Haskell Trask, dictator of the
League—the big fortress-palace that
was the very storm center of the gath-
ering menace threatening the four
inner worlds.

  Thorn had had the girl in his mind
every hour of the long flight out to
Saturn. Again and agaip. he. had vi-
sioned her eager whiteffice^s sne had
stood with him under the meteor-blaz-
ing night sky of Turkoon, telling him
her dreams for the future. She had be-
come much more to him, he realized
deeply, than just the pirate girl who
held the secret he must obtain.

  The lights of Satumopolis disap-
peared as the Venture throbbed west-
ward through the night. They
glimpsed the lights of another, smaller
city far to the north. Then Stilicho
sent the ship in a long, descending
glide toward the far-stretching black
wilderness that now lay beneath.

  Air whistled thinly outside the
walls. The ship dropped into thin
mists. Then through the mists the
surface rushed up toward them—a
vast and endless forest of grotesque,
towering growths, dimly lit by the
radiance of three moons and the
majestic arc of the ring.

  With a prolonged flash from the
keel tubes, and a soft, bumping jar,
the Venture landed. They were in
silent darkness.

 “Here’s the fungus forest you
wanted to be landed in,” said Stilicho
doubtfully. “It's a long way from here
to Satumopolis, though.”

  “We’ll get there,” Thom told him
grimly. “It would be inviting capture

to land too near the capital. By land-
ing here and working our way toward
Satumopolis as slith-hunters, we’ll
be much less likely to be suspected by
the secret police.”

Gunner welk and Sual Av

were gathering the atom-guns and
other equipment they were to take
with them. The Planeteers had al-
ready changed into jackets and boots
of soft Jovian leather.

  “You’re sure you understand where
you’re to wait for us with the Ven-
ture?” Thorn asked the old pirate.

  Stilicho’s white head bobbed. “Out
in the ring, in Cassini’s division just
at the west limb of the planet-shadow.
We’ll lie there in the ship till you
come. But how will you get out
there ?”

     .'teTgfcf out safely,” Thom
'clipped, “we’ll steal a small ship some-
how and get there.”

  They went down to the ship door. It
had been opened and the frigid, misty
air of Saturn, faintly tainted with am-
monia, was pouring into the ship. The
motley crew was silently watching as
the Planeteers prepared to disembark.
And Ool, the big gray space-dog,
pressed against Thorn’s legs and
looked up at him with great green
eyes that held an almost human ex-
pression of anxiety.

  “Ool wants to go with you,” said
Stilicho. “He senses you’re going
after Lana.”

  “We daren’t take him—it’d arouse
too much attention for poor slith-hxmt-
ers to own such a rare beast. You hold
him, Stilicho,” Thorn said.

  “Won’t you change your mind and
let me go along with you?” asked the
old Martian .plpadingly.

  "We’ve argued that out,” Thom re-
minded him. “One of us four has got
to keep the ship waiting at the ren-
dezvous in the ring, and that’s the way
in which you can best help us.”

  Stilicho, holding the space-dog’s
neck, reached up to grip Thorn’s hand
with bony fingers. His cracked voice
quavered.

  “Good luck, boy—and God grant
you bring the lass out safely.”

  The door ground shut. With a re-
58

STARTLING STORIES

sounding reverberation of blazing
keel-tubes, the Venture blasted off.

  The Planeteers stood silent in the
frigid misty darkness, watching the
ship disappear into the sky.

  “So we’re on our own now,” rum-
bled Gunner Welk. “And all we
have to do is make our way into Sa-
tumopolis through ten thousand se-
cret police who are watching for spies,
break into Haskell Trask’s citadel that
even Saturnians don’t dare go near,
and steal away the dictator’s most im-
portant prisoner right from under his
nose. It’s almost too easy!”

  “I hate to see you grow sarcastic,
Gunner,” said Sual Av worriedly.
“It’s the mark of a small mind.”

  The Venusian dodged, chuckling, as
the towering Mercurian aimed a bear-
like blow at him.

  “Be quiet!” snapped John Thorn
tautly. “I hear someone or some-
thing.”

  The other two Planeteers were in-
stantly silent, all three gripping their
heavy atom-guns and listening in-
tently.

  The great fungus forest that covers
much of Saturn stretched about them
in the cold mist, illuminated by the
combined ring-light and moonlight.
All around the little clearing in which
they stood towered the enormous fun-
gi, huge gray growths in the form of
bulbous spheres, drawing their sus-
tenance by parasitism from the thick
mat of spongy mosses underfoot.

T^TOTHING appeared stirring ex-
±.yi cept a few “diggers”—furry lit-
tle beasts with flat, spadelike noses,
whose red eyes fearfully watched
from tunnel-mouths nearby. The only
sounds were the occasional zooming
drone of pinkly luminous “fire bats”
winging through the towering fungi,
and the long, distant ululation of a
pack of “climbers.”

  The sky over the Planeteers’ heads
was weirdly magnificent—dominated
by the colossal arc of the rings that
spanned the heavens just south of the
zenith like a huge, shining, white rain-
bow. Out beyond the rings shone the
bright shield of Titan, sinking rapidly
toward the horizon while Tethys and

Rhea rose like twin jewels among the
stars.

“I don’t hear anything,” muttered
Sual Av finally. “But the noise of the
ship landing may have attracted—”
“John, look out!” yelled Gunner
Welk suddenly. “A slith!”

  One of the smaller bulbous gray
fungi of the forest had suddenly be-
gun to move. It came toward them
with rocket-speed, a charge almost
faster than the eye could follow.

  Thorn knew it was slith as he flung
his atom-gun to his shoulder. That
creature alone could so perfectly
mimic the gray fungi by means of its
protective coloration.

  Thorn glimpsed the charging thing
over the sights of his weapon for an
instant, a bulbous, oily gray monster
ten feet high, its dumpy, shapeless
body running with incredible swift-
ness on thick little legs, the two cold,
bright eyes in the front of its faceless
body flaming as its white-fanged
mouth gaped unbelievably wide.

  He fired and missed. His shell ex-
ploded blindingly just behind the
charging slith. Gunner fired an in-
stant later, and his atom-shell hit the
creature’s side. When the flare of the
shell vanished, they saw the great
gray mass lying unstirring only a doz-
en feet from them.

  “We let that thing catch us nap-
ping!” Thorn said harshly. “We
should have remembered this forest is
alive with sliths.”

“You’re right about that!” yelled
Sual Av. “There’s another of them!”
The Venusian’s gun fairly leaped
to his shoulder. But instead of firing,
he stared stupefiedly.

  “Devils of space, look at it! The
thing’s coming apart!'’

  The second slith that Sual Av had
glimpsed was a hundred yards away
among the fungi. It was an even bigger
creature than the first, and its great
gray mass was grotesquely different in
shape, consisting of a large mass with
the cold, bright eyes and wide, lipless
mouth, and a smaller attached mass
with eyes and mouth also.

  The smaller mass was detaching it-
self from the main body of the crea-
ture. Soft gray flesh stretched and
THE THREE PLANETEERS

59

snapped. And instead of one slith,
there stood two, a large one and a lit-
tle one. A moment later, both of them
charged toward the Planeteers.

  The shells of three atom-guns ex-
ploded together around the onrushing
monsters. Both lay dead when the
flares died.

 “Am I seeing things or did that
creature really divide into two?” de-
manded the Venusian.

  “Planetary zoology must be a closed
book to you,” Gunner Welk told him
dourly. “If you knew any, you’d
know that the aboriginal animal life of
Saturn is asexual, and propagates by
fission.”

 “Come on—we’ll get the teeth out
of these carcasses,” Thorn said. “It's
lucky we’ve killed a few. for slith-
hunters going back to town without
any teeth might arouse suspicion.”

THEY advanced to the torn dead
bodies, feeling with this first loco-
motion the powerful drag of Saturn-
ian gravitation. Only the fact that
that gravitation was partly neutral-
ized by the centrifugal force of the
planet’s rapid spin made it tolerable
to men. The space-trained muscles of
the Planeteers quickly began to ad-
just themselves to the greater load,
though they felt very slow and heavy.

 With their keen knives of Earth
steelite they hacked and slashed at
the repulsive bodies of the sliths, dig-
ging the huge white fangs out. Those
teeth, the hardest and most perdurable
organic substance in the system, were
in high demand on all worlds for carv-
ing into jewelry and for certain in-
dustrial processes. The system-wide
demand for them was responsible for
the fact that s/iYA-hunting was a pro-
fession on this world.

  Dawn was rapidly filtering through
the mists about them. The brief five-
hour night of Saturn was ending.

  “Curse these cold fogs!” muttered
Sual Av, his teeth chattering as he
worked. “I wouldn’t trade one hot,
steamy swamp of Venus for all these
outer worlds.”

  “If you liked that mud-puddle na-
tive world of yours so much, why did
you leave it?” demanded Gunner.

  They had the last of the teeth out,
and were putting them into the pouch-
es at their belts, when Thorn sudden-
ly sprang to his feet, gripping his
heavy atom-gun.

  “Stand by, boys, and don’t show any
excitement,” he said in a low, rapid
voice.

  Through the chill, dawn-lit mists of
the fungus forest toward the three
comrades were coming a dozen green-
faced Saturnians, all heavily armed.

CHAPTER XI
Secret Police

JOHN THORN perceived that the
approaching Saturnians were
slith-hunters. They were a rough-
looking crew, wearing stained leather
and carrying heavy atom-guns. In
their lead was a hulking man of mid-
dle age who hailed the Planeteers in
a bull voice.

  “What luck, friends?” he called
jovially. “I see you’ve got a few
sliths, at least.”

  “A few is right,” John Thorn an-
swered ruefully. “We've been roam-
ing the fungi for days, and these are
the first teeth we’ve got.”

  Thorn was careful to speak with the
heavy Saturnian accent. The lan-
guage of all the system’s peoples is the
same, since all are descended from the
original colonizing Earth stock. But
each world has developed its charac-
teristic accent.

  Sual Av and Gunner Welk had risen
to their feet. They stood, casually
wiping the gray blood of the slain
sliths from their leather jackets as the
Saturnians came up.

  "I’m Kribo,” announced the hulking
leader of the newcomers in his bull
voice. “I thought I knew all the hunt-
ers in these parts, but you lads are
new.”

 Thorn nodded. “We came down
here from Karies, figuring the hunt-
ing might be better here. Instead, it’s
worse.”

Kribo nodded his big head in em-
phatic agreement. "Aye, it’s getting
60

STARTLING STORIES

so a hunter can’t make a living in these
parts,” he boomed. “Too near Saturn-
opolis, I guess.”

  He slapped a bulging pouch at his
belt. “Anyway, we’ve made a fair haul
of teeth and we’re on our way back to
Saturnopolis. Want a lift in our rock-
et-plane?”

  John Thorn’s pulses leaped at the
offer. Here was a quick way to get
into the Saturnian capital in company
that would nullify suspicion. But he
frowned doubtfully, and looked ques-
tioningly at the other two Planeteers
beside him.

  “What about it?” he asked them.
“Shall we pull out of these forests
with what few teeth we have?”

  “I say yes,” growled Gunner Welk
disgustedly, in Saturnian accents.
“This section isn’t as good hunting as
where we came from.”

  Sual Av nodded his agreement. ‘‘I
want to see a few lights and get a few
drinks, after two weeks like we’ve
had.”

  “Ho, ho!” guffawed the hulking
Kribo. “Don’t be so down-hearted
about your bad luck, lads. It’ll change
soon, sure.”

  The disguised Planeteers trudged
through the towering fungi with their
new-found friends. Thorn and his
two comrades had to exert all their
strength to keep from showing the
dragging, leaden effect of the Satur-
nian gravitation upon them.

  The wan, sickly day of Saturn had
come. The little, far-off disk of the
sun was rising rapidly to cast its thin,
feeble rays upon the looming gray
fungi and spongy gray mosses. Across
the dusky sky, the incredible arc of
the rings soared stupendously. The
usual cold morning rain was dripping
from the mists by the time they
reached the rocket-plane.

  Kribo’s vehicle proved an ancient,
battered one whose glassite windows
were cracked and whose inertrum
power-chamber had been strained, and
crudely reinforced with chromaloy
bands.

  As they piled into the tubular body,
Thorn hoped fervently that that
power-chamber would not choose to
let go at this particular time.

KRIBO started the antique ma-
chine, and it lurched crazily up
from the fungus forest into the rainy
mists. The Saturnian turned to Thom
with a large, ostentatious air.

  “I suppose you’re wondering where
a s/j'fA-hunter got money enough to
buy a fine rocket-plane like this,” he
boomed to Thorn over the irregular
roar of defective tubes. “The fact is
that me and ray boys here own it to-
gether.”

  “It’s a fine machine,” Thorn said
admiringly. “I always hoped to own
one. But times are hard for a hunter.”
“Aye, and getting harder,” growled
the hulking Saturnian. “Since this
war-scare cut off all trade with the in-
ner worlds, the price of teeth has gone
down almost to nothing. When the
war really starts, our market will be
gone altogether.”

  A youthful Saturnian behind them
spoke up, his face flushed with patri-
otic ardor.

  “You forget, Kribo, that once we
have conquered the Inner Alliance and
have access to the rich resources of
those worlds, we’ll all be prosperous.
The Chairman has said so, hasn’t he?
And the Chairman is always right.”
“Oh, sure, the Chairman is always
right,” hastily boomed Kribo, with a
doubtful glance at the Planeteers.

  It was the slogan of the four League
worlds, Thorn knew, the formula that
Haskell Trask, the dictator, had im-
pressed almost hypnotically upon his
followers. Everyone in the rocket-
plane, to show his patriotism, hastened
to repeat it.

  “The Chairman is always right,”
they chorused together, the Planeteers
joining in.

  Sual Av choked over a sneeze that
sounded suspiciously like a chuckle,
and Thom shot the disguised Venu-
sian a furious glance.

  Thorn guessed after a little while
that they were approaching Saturn-
opolis. The city was not yet visible
through the misty rain, but below
them now lay vast cultivated groves of
the queer fungus-fruits developed on
this world. Many workers could be
seen down there, toiling and plodding
through the cold, dripping rain.
THE THREE PLANETEERS

61

  Saturnopolis came into sight, low on
the distant horizon ahead. Under-
neath the dusky daylight sky, framed
by the colossal shining arch of the
rings, the metropolis showed as a
great mass of low black structures. A
square, terraced black fortress rose
near the center of the city, vague and
distant in the mists.

  John Thorn’s hands clenched as he
glimpsed, miles north of the capital,
the huge expanse of an enormous
spaceport. He could make out rows
of hundreds on hundreds of battle-
cruisers parked there, and others land-
ing or taking off. That hive of swarm-
ing activity, he knew, was the main
base at which most of the ships of the
League navies were gathering for the
coming attack on the Alliance.

  Kribo had followed Thorn’s intent
gaze. The booming voice of the hunt-
er startled the disguised young Earth-
man.

  “They say any rocket-plane that
flies within five miles of that space-
port is gunned down,” Kribo declared.
“I always give the place a wide berth.”

  Thorn nodded. For the moment, as
he stared at the gathering armada that
was intended to carry conquest and
destruction to the inner worlds, he
could not trust himself to speak.

  “Here we are," boomed Kribo a few
minutes later. He added proudly, “It
didn’t take long in this machine, did
it?”

THEIR rocket-plane was gliding
down over the flat, black roofs of
the city. They poised in the rainy mist,
edged into a descent-level, and pres-

ently came down on a parking-roof.

  Kribo turned genially to Thorn and
his comrades as the party of slith-
hunters emerged from the battered
machine.

  “You three lads come along with us
to Mother Bombey’s p 1 a c e,” he
boomed. “It’s our favorite drinking-
spot here.”

  “Sorry, we can’t,” Thorn told him.
“We’re out of money, and these few
teeth we have won’t bring more than
enough to pay our way back to Ka-
ries.”

  “Who said you would need money?”
demanded Kribo indignantly. “I’m
paying for everything, lads. I know
what it is to come back from a hard
trip with only a handful of teeth.”

  Thorn thought rapidly. He had a
plan for seeking Lana, but could not
try it until night came. The Plane-
teers would be safer if they stayed
off the streets in the meantime.

  “All right, we’re your men if you’re
paying,” he told Kribo with a grin, as
they descended to the street.

  Saturnopolis looked a dreary place
in the sickly daylight beneath the fall-
ing rain. The cold mists that fogged
its streets were bone-chilling.
Through the streets roared rocket-
cars, and the pedestrian-walks were
crowded with the Saturnian populace
and with hordes of officers and men
of the four League navies. The four-
circle emblem of the League v/as show-
ing everywhere, and it was clearly
evident that Haskell Trask had
whipped the people to war-fever.

Far away across the city there rose

[Turn page]
62

STARTLING STORIES

from the ruck of low, black cement
buildings the huge, terraced square
pile that dominated everything. It had
been built two centuries before, as the
seat of the Saturnian government.
Now, Thorn knew, it was the guarded
citadel in which the ruthless dictator
of the League of Cold Worlds lived
and worked and wove his plans of con-
quest.

 Sual Av and Gunner Welk pressed
close beside Thorn as the noisy hunt-
ers pushed through the crowded
streets.

  The Mercurian, glancing at the dis-
tant, frowning pile, spoke guardedly
in deep undertones.

  “The girl will be in that fortress,
John. And I still don’t see how we
can hope even to get in there.”

 ‘‘We’ll get in,” Thorn muttered
with grim determination.' "I’ve been
here before, and I have a plan.”

  “It’ll have to be damned good to get
us past the net of secret police around
that place,” whispered Gunner.

  Thorn’s eyes clung with fierce in-
tensity to the looming, mist-vague
fortress. Somewhere behind those
forbidding walls was the pirate girl
who was the focus of all his thoughts.
What tortures were Haskell Trask
and his fat spymaster using upon her
to make her reveal the secret of Ere-
bus?

  ‘‘Here we are!” boomed Kribo, stop-
ping in a dingy cross-street. He
pushed through a door, the others fol-
lowing.

 Thorn perceived that Mother Bom-
bey’s was a shabby rendezvous, with a
drinking-counter, tables, and a few
“happiness vibration” booths. Kryp-
ton lamps lit the place, a few “glow-
ers” dispelled the chill, and it was
more than crowded with rough slith-
hunters.

 “Welcome, Kribo!” roared a dozen
voices. “What luck this time?”

 “Fair, boys, fair,” answered the
hulking hunter complacently. He
turned. “Meet some lads from up in
Karies.”

  He pointed to the disguised Plan-
eteers, introducing them to the crowd
by the false names that Thorn had
given him.

A HARD-FACED, ample-figured
old Saturnian hag reached over
the drinking-counter with an out-
stretched hand.

  "Pass over the guns, Kribo,” she or-
dered harshly.

  “This is Mother Bombey,” Kribo
told Thorn with a grin. “She makes
us check our guns when we come in,
so that our little arguments won’t
wreck the place.”

  Thorn made no objection to hand-
ing over the heavy atom-guns, for he
and Sual Av and Gunner Welk re-
tained their atom-pistols inside their
jackets.

  "Drinks or vibrations for every-
body!” ordered Kribo, slapping down
a platinum coin with a lordly gesture.

  Thorn ordered fungus wine, which
he knew was the Saturnian favorite.
Sual Av and Gunner Welle followed
his lead.

  "Here'3 better time6 and plenty
teeth for every hunter!” proposed
Kribo, quaffing the pale liquor.

  John Thorn could not help liking
the hulking hunter. He sensed that
here was a representative of the real
population of the League worlds, hard-
working, fundamentally decent peo-
ple all, when not whipped up to war
fever by an ambitious dictator’s in-
flammatory lies.

  Two hours went past in the crowd-
ed, noisy place. Thorn had been
forced to swallow more of the musty,
powerful fungus wine than he wanted,
and he was glad when night fell out-
side, for Kribo was a little drunk and
was giving him a candid opinion of
the political situation. And a thin-
faced Saturnian nearly seemed to be
listening.

  “The Chairman keeps saying we’ve
got to arm to the teeth and take terri-
tory from the inner worlds because
we’re poor,” Kribo declared. “But it
seems to me we’re poor because we
spend everything on this big fleet of
battle-cruisers we’ve built.”

  “Shut up, Kribo,” Thorn warned
anxiously. “That kind of talk will
get you into trouble.”

  Kribo winked at him. “It’s all right,
lad—I know you feel the same way. I
THE THREE PLANETEERS

63

saw your partner choke off a laugh on
our way here, when we said, ‘The
Chairman is always right.’ ”

  Thorn knew the peril of such talk,
and determined the time had come
for the Planeteers to get started, since
it was already full Hight outside. Sual
Av and Gunner rose quickly at his nod.

  “We’ve got to be on our way, Kribo,”
Thorn told the big hunter. “Thanks
a lot for what you’ve done for us.”

  He and his two comrades started for
the door. But the thin-faced Satur-
nian he had noticed barred their way.

  “Stand where you are!” snapped this
individual. <rYou three and that hunt-
er are nnder arrest—authority of the
SP.”

  As he spoke, the thin-faced Satur-
nian turned back his jacket to show
a viridium badge with the dreaded
emblem.

  “Secret police!” gasped Kribo, his
face livid.

  The whole place was frozen with
terror, every man staring silently, for
throughout the four worlds of the
League, the secret police of Haskell
Trask was a name to inspire fright.

  The SP man was drawing a pocket-
audio from his jacket. So sure was he
of the power of his organization’s
name that he had not troubled to draw
a weapon.

  “You’ll get a year in the mines of
Pluto for your subversive talk,” he
told Thorn and the others with thin-
lipped satisfaction. Then he spoke
into the little audio. “Forty-three-
twelve calling headquarters. Send—”

  Thorn’s fist crashed on his jaw, at
that moment. The SP man went down
in a crumpled heap, and a cry of fear
and horror went up from the crowd
in the place.

  “Come on, Kribo!” yelled Thorn,
grabbing the dazed hunter’s arm. He
rushed out into the street, Sual Av
and the Mercurian at his heels.

THE four of them plunged down
the dark, dingy little thorough-
fare, hearing an excited roar of voices
from behind. The streets were far
less crowded now, and the mists had
cleared a little with the stopping of
the rain. The stupendous bow of the

rings blazed white overhead, and Ti-
tan was rising.

  “Good God, we’re all in for it now!”
gasped Kribo as they stopped a few
blocks away. “You hit an SP man!”
“We’ll take care of ourselves,”
Thorn rapped. “You’d better get back
out into your fungus forests and stay
there till this blows over.”

  Kribo grasped at the suggestion
eagerly. He gripped Thorn’s hand a
moment in his huge paw.

  “Thanks for pulling me out of there,
lad,” he said fervently, and then has-
tened away.

  Thorn started with his two com-
rades in a run through the darker
cross-streets, heading toward the huge
pile of the distant citadel that frowned
black against the stars.

  “This is fine—this makes things
perfect!” Gunner Welk was growl-
ing as they ran. “Now we’ve got all
the secret police in Saturnopolis look-
ing for us. That’s all we needed.”
“Shut up and keep running,” Thorn
panted. “We’ve got to get into the
citadel before the SP net picks us up.”
“Get into the citadel?” cried the
Mercurian. “Are you still crazy
enough to think we can?”

  “You talk too much, Gunner,”
laughed Sual Av breathlessly. “Save
your wind—you’ll need it.”

  They were all gasping from the
strain of their efforts against the
greater gravitation when John Thorn
halted at the corner of two dark streets
of warehouses, a mile from the citadel.

  Thorn looked swiftly around to
make sure they were unobserved,
then stooped and tugged at something
in the cement paving. It was a chrom-
aloy metal plate that came loose to
reveal a dark, yawning cavity below.

  “Quick, down with you!” he or-
dered.

  Bewilderedly, the Venusian and
Mercurian dropped down through the
aperture. Thorn followed, quickly re-
placing the plate above them.

  They were in dank, absolute dark-
ness, bitterly cold. But Thorn got out
his fluoric flash-lamp and its little red
beam showed they stood in a big ce-
ment tube at whose bottom ran a
stream of icy water.
64

STARTLING STORIES

  “This is one of the city’s drains,”
Thorn said rapidly. “They have to
have a whole network of them, to run
off the water from these perpetual
rains. I learned about them when I
first visited Saturn with an official
Earth mission, years ago before Has-
kell Trask came to power.

  “There are drains beneath the cita-
del that opens out into these main
ones,” Thorn continued tautly.
“That’s our way into the palace!”

 “Up the drains?” Sual Av said
startledly. “Why, I never thought of
any way as simple as that.”

  “It’s too simple,” rasped Gunner
Welk. “Do you think these people
are so dumb that they won’t have
planted some kind of death-trap to
keep intruders from entering the cita-
del thus?”

  Thorn's jaw hardened. “We'll have
to take that chance. Lana’s in there,
and this js our only way in to her.”
He started along the great drain, the
red beam lighting their way. The
cold, dank air and the icy water they
splashed through were freezing. Shad-
owy things scuttled away ahead of
the Planeteers, as they pushed on
through the gloomy tunnels toward
the guarded stronghold of the dicta-
tor.

       CHAPTER XII
       Citadel of Fear

JOHN THORN paused. They had
been following the huge drain for
half an hour, and had now reached a
point where a smaller drain-tube
opened into it from the right.

  “This must be one of the citadel
drains,” Thorn muttered, Sashing his
red beam up it. “Come on, we’ll soon
find out.”

  “We’d better not stay down in this
maze of pipes too long,” warned Sual
Av. “The rains will start again when
dawn comes, and these tubes will be
full of rushing water.”

  John Thorn was clambering into
the smaller side drain. It was so small
that he had to go forward in it on

hands and knees. It sloped very gen-
tly upward, and its floor was damp.

  He led the way, the little red beam
of his fluoric lamp lighting him for-
ward. Sual Av followed him closely,
and the big Mercurian brought up the
rear.

 Thom guessed that by now they
must be passing under the wall of the
great fortress. His hopes were run-
ning high. So far, they had met no
barrier.

  Then suddenly, Thorn met the bar-
rier. And he almost died before he
realized it.

  The little tubular fluoric lamp he
held outstretched in front of him sud-
denly flared red hot, its chromaloy
case starting instantly to melt. Thorn
recoiled with a smothered exclamation
of pain and surprise, dropping the red-
hot thing. They were plunged into
absolute darkness.

  “What is it?” exclaimed Sual Av
anxiously.

 “I don’t know—something ahead
melted my lamp before I could draw
back,” Thorn answered, his voice wire-
taut in the darkness. "Pass me your
lamp, Sual. We've run into some devil-
ish trap!”

  The Venusian passed his lamp for-
ward. Thorn, without venturing any
farther forward, snicked on the beam.

  The red ray quivered up the gently
sloping black cement tube. Thorn
stared tensely. There was nothing
ahead—nothing except a row of small
holes across the curved floor of the
drain, and a similar row of holes in
the roof exactly above.

  “I can’t see anything,” said Sual Av.
“Your lamp must have burned out ac-
cidentally.”

  “Wait,” said Thorn tensely.

  He tore a bit of cloth from his jack-
et, and cautiously pushed it forward
until it was over one of the row of
holes. Instantly the cloth burst into
flame and vanished in fine ashes.

  John Thorn felt cold sweat stand
out on his brow. He knew now the in-
visible death he had nearly blundered
into.

  “There’s a web of heat-beams here
across the drain," he said hoarsely. “A
little trap fixed up by Haskell Trask’s
THE THREE PLANETEERS

65

guards for anyone who might try to
enter the citadel this way.”

  The nature of the diabolical trap was
clear. Buried somewhere near the
cement drain was a generator of heat-
beams—those “focused” rays of ra-
diant heat which were produced in
a mirrored inertrum chamber by trans-
formation of atomic energy into vibra-
tory force in the proper octaves. Such
beams had an effective range of only
a few feet, but were deadly within that
distance.

  “The beams are projected through
three holes in the floor and disappear
through the holes in the roof of the
drain, to be dissipated above,” Thorn
said. “It’s a fiendishly clever idea.
Anyone crawling up this drain would
never see anything until he blundered
into those beams that would sear
through and kill him instantly.”
"Hell, we can’t pass this until we
find some way to shut off these
beams!” swore Gunner Welk from be-
hind.

THORN frowned tensely. “We
can’t get at the generator of them,”
he muttered. “That must be located
outside the drain. It would take lots
of tools and time to dig down to it.”
“Inertrum is proof against high
heat,” Sual Av said hopefully. “If we
had some inertrum plugs to stop those
holes the beams come up through—”
"That’s fine,” rasped Gunner an-
grily. “Now all we have to do is to go
back out in the city, order a nice set of
inertrum plugs, and come back here
with them. The secret police out there
wouldn’t think of bothering us while
we’re doing all that.”

  “Shut up, Gunner,” Thorn said.
“I’ve an idea which might work.”

  He fumbled in the pouch that was
still attached to his belt. Out of it
he drew the gleaming white sJith teeth
they had taken from the monsters they
had slain in the fungus forest. There
were a dozen of the teeth, long, con-
ical fangs an inch across at the root.

  “These slith teeth might do the
trick,” Thom muttered. “They’re one
of the hardest and most perdurable
substances in the system, remember—
almost as hard as inertrum. If we

plugged the heat-beam apertures with
these—”

  “They couldn’t last more than a few
seconds before the beams burned them
out!” Sual Av exclaimed.

  “A few seconds ought to be enough
for us to get past,” Thorn retorted.
He hesitated, then added, “The last
man will rim the most danger. We’ll
back down to the main drain, and I’ll
take the rear position.”

 “You’ll not!” Gunner Welk de-
clared. “Hell’s name, do you want to
play around in these slimy pipes all
night? Go ahead and put the teeth in
those holes, and let’s get on—if it
works.”

  “All right,” Thom said grimly.
“When I give the word, jump after me
as fast as you can, and don’t knock
any of the teeth out of the holes!”

  Thorn rapidly prepared for their
precarious stratagem. There were six
holes around the perimeter of the
drain from which the deadly, invisible
beams emerged. He took the six most
regularly-shaped of his slith-teeth,
and laid them in readiness.

  Then with the end of his lamp,
Thorn swiftly pushed the teeth into
place. As each big white tooth was
shoved forward, it became a conical
plug to close the beam-aperture. By
the time the sixth tooth was tamped
into place, the first one was already
charring and smelling.

 “Come on!” Thorn cried, and
plunged forward in a scrambling
leap through the teeth-plugged circle
of holes.

  Sual Av followed instantly, the
Venusian’s wigged head butting into
Thorn’s back. A moment later, Gun-
ner Welk caromed into the Venusian
from behind with battering force.

  “Jacket’s—on fire!” gasped the Mer-
curian, beating at his side. A smell
of scorched cloth filled the dank air.

  There was a frantic squirming in
the cramped tunnel as the other two
Planeteers tried to help Gunner beat
out his smoldering jacket. He and
Sual Av soon had it extinguished.

 “Are you hurt, Gunner?" Thorn
asked anxiously.

  “No—just my side scorched a lit-
tle,” panted the Mercurian. “One of
66

STARTLING STORIES

those teeth burned clear out just as
I jumped. It’s lucky it was one on
the side instead of in the middle!”

  Thorn glanced back past them. The
slith-teeth with which he had plugged
the apertures had vanished. Even that
super-hard substance had been
charred away in a few seconds by the
beams.

  “Let’s get on,” growled the Mercur-
ian in a moment. “These damned
drains aren’t exactly a pleasure re-
sort.”

AGAIN Thorn started forward on
hands and knees, lighting the
way with his red beam. He moved
with extreme caution, alert to detect
the presence of another invisible,
deadly web.

  But they met no more such barriers.
Presently they reached a place where
the drain forked into five smaller
tubes.

  “Which one?” whispered Sual Av
to him.

  “We’ll each take one, trace it and
come back and meet here,” Thorn mut-
tered. “One of them ought to lead
to the dungeons.”

  Thorn crawled into the right drain-
tube. It was so small he had to inch
forward by creeping. It slanted up-
ward also.

  Blue light finally glimmered ahead.
Thorn extinguished his lamp and
stealthily crawled on. He came to the
end of the drain, which was closed by
inertrum bars set in the cement, over
his head.

  Cautiously he peered upward. The
grating over him was set in the Ce-
ment paving of a large court sur-
rounded on all sides by the dark,
towering mass of the citadel. Kryp-
ton lamps cast a blue glow on space-
ships parked in the court, three swift-
lined small cruisers. Two armed
guards paced to and fro beside them.

  “Haskell Trask’s personal space-
cruisers,” Thorn muttered to himself.

  He backed down to the fork where
the drains diverged. Gunner Welk
and Sual Av were just emerging there
also.

  “The dungeons are up there at the
end of that pipe J" Sual Av whispered

excitedly, pointing to the second
drain.

  “Come on, then," Thorn said swift-
ly-

  He led the way, all three of them
crawling up the narrow pipe the
Venusian had explored. Its opening,
also, was barred by inertrum bars set
in the cement.

  Thorn peered up through the bars
into a short blue-lit corridor, along
whose walls were the inertrum doors
of cells. Almost all of the cells seemed
unoccupied, their doors half-open. No
prisoner stayed long in Haskell
Trask’s dreaded private dungeon!

  "It’s Trask’s dungeon, all right,”
Thorn whispered. “And no guards in
sight. Go back down the pipe a lit-
tle.”

  The other two Planeteers obeyed,
all three backing down the tube a lit-
tle way. Thorn drew his pistol,
sighted carefully at the grating above,
and pulled the trigger.

  The little atom-shell exploded in a
small, brilliant flare of atomic energy,
with a thudding reverberation. The
flare burned away a mass of cement at
one side of the grating, completely ex-
posing the ends of the imbedded iner-
trum bars.

  Thorn clambered eagerly up to the
grating at once. At the same moment
he heard a cry of alarm from up in
the corridor. Two Saturnian guards
came rushing out of one of the cells,
dropping a flask of fungus-wine they
had been secretly drinking, and draw-
ing their atom-pistols. The thud of
the atom-shell had roused them.

  They saw Thorn’s head below the
grating and fired at him instantly.
Their shells struck the floor in front
of the grating and a flare of blinding
light and scorching heat hit Thorn’s
face. He fired his own atom-pistol,
triggering quickly. More flares of
energy burst brilliantly beside the two
Saturnian guards, down the corridor.

  The two green-faced soldiers crum-
pled and lay still, in a scorched and
lifeless heap. Thorn waited, his face
wild in the pale blue light, gripping
his weapon. But the swift thudding of
the shells was not followed by any
further alarm.
THE THREE PLANETEERS

67

  "Those must be the only guards on
duty inside the dungeon,” Thorn
panted, tearing away the freed iner-
trum bars with quivering hands.

THE Planeteers scrambled hastily
up out of the drain into the short
single corridor of the dungeon.

  “Listen! I hear someone!” Sual Av
exclaimed.

  Then the other two comrades heard.
It was a voice from the farther end of
the corridor, a distant, monotonous,
strangely metallic voice speaking on
and on.

  “—Erebus—won’t think of Erebus
—think of anything but Erebus—
won’t think of Erebus—”

  Thorn started wildly. “Erebus?
That must be Lana talking! Come
on!"

  “It didn’t sound like a human
voice," Gunner muttered, as he and
the Venusian raced after Thorn.

  They leaped over the scorched
bodies of the dead Saturnians, and on
down the corridor. The voice came
from the last cell in the passage. Now
they heard it more clearly, and it was
not a human voice. It spoke in cold,
metallic, inflectionless tones, on and
on without stopping.

 “—mustn’t think of Erebus—
mustn’t think of the secret! Keep my
mind on something else—”

  Thorn reached the door of that last
cell. He peered through the little
grating in the inertrum door. And his
brown face froze, his eyes widened
wildly, at what he saw.

  “Good God, it’s Lana!" he whispered
hoarsely. “They’ve got a psychophone
attached to her!”

  The cell into which Thorn wildly
gazed was a windowless cubicle, lit by
a single krypton lamp in the ceiling.
Under the uncanny blue glow, in a
metal chair to which her arms and
legs were tightly strapped, sat Lana
Cain. The girl’s slender little figure
was sagging in her bonds, her eyes
were closed, her white face infinitely
weary and exhausted. It was not Lana
who was speaking, but the complex
machine that was attached to her head.

  Tiny, needlelike incisions had been
made in the base of Lana’s skull. From

them, two thin black wires ran upward
to the mechanism suspended above
her, a compact complexity of trans-
formers and vacuum tubes, upon
which was mounted an audio-speaker.

  The metallic, monotonous voice
came from that audio-speaker. It was
still speaking steadily on, and every-
thing it said was being taken down,
upon the moving tape of a recorder
whose microphone hung in front of
the speaker.

  “Think of something else,” the
metallic voice came from the speaker
as the Planeteers listened. “Think
of the Zone—of Stilicho—of my
father—”

  “A psychophone!” repeated Sual
Av, wide-eyed. “So that’s how Trask
is trying to get the secret of Erebus
from Lana!"

  Thorn too was thunderstruck by the
ingenuity of the means being used to
secure the girl’s secret knowledge.

  The psychophone was a mechanism
that made thought audible. Once it
was connected to a subject’s nerve-
centers, every conscious thought in
that subject’s brain was translated
into mechanical speech by the ma-
chine and spoken aloud. That was ac-
complished by transmitting the tiny
electrical neural currents of the sub-
ject’s thought-impulses into a com-
plex scanner, in which the particular
vibration of each thought actuated the
nearest word or phrase that expressed
that thought, in the phono-recorded
vocabulary of the thing.

  The machine was the recent and lit-
tle-known invention of a Venusian
psychologist. It was a far-advanced
adaptation of the ancient encephalo-
graph, the device used by Earth
scientists as far back as the third
decade of the twentieth century to
record thought as a varying electrical
vibration.

W ANA CAIN was sitting silent, her
JWLA eyes closed, but every thought
that passed through her mind was be-
ing remorselessly translated and
spoken aloud by the mechanism above
her head, and taken down by the
recorder so that it could be studied
later at leisure. She could not possibly
68

STARTLING STORIES

keep from thinking, and whatever she
thought, the psychophone spoke
forth.

  “—my father,” the mechanical voice
was speaking on as Thorn and his
comrades peered incredulously.“Wish
my father were alive. He would get
me out of here. He would—”

  “Lana!” Thorn whispered tensely
into the cell.

  The girl opened her eyes. Their
blue depths were wells of utter weari-
ness and hopelessness as she stared at
Thorn’s face through the grating in
the door.

  Her face hardened in bitter hatred
as she looked at him. She said noth-
ing, but the psychophone’s mechanical
voice spoke her thoughts.

  “Saturnian — hate all Saturnians,
now. Green faces peering at me—
trying to make me think of Erebus—”

  Thorn, for a moment stunned by her
bitter reaction, suddenly understood.
He and his comrades, the green stain
on their faces, were still disguised as
Saturnians.

  “Lana, it’s I—John Thorn!’’ he said
hoarsely. “It’s the Planeteers!”

  Lana stared unbelievingly. Then as
she recognized his features, her tired
eyes lit with incredulous joy.

  “John Thorn?” she whispered. That
was all that came from her lips.

  But from the psychophone over-
head, there sounded her thoughts in
that metallic voice.

  “John Thorn, I love you! I love
you!”

       CHAPTER XIII
       Dictator of Worlds

THE girl’s white face flushed crim-
son, as the machine over her head
blared forth her secret thoughts. Then
she raised her gold head and looked
at Thorn with brave steadiness.

  “I would not have told you, John
Thorn,” she whispered. “But since,
the psychophone has spoken it, I must
admit it—I do love you.”

  Thorn’s green-stained face worked,
and in the rush of his mingled emo-

tions, it was a moment before he could
speak.

  “Lana, I love you, too," he said un-
steadily. “I have, since that night of
the feast at Turkoon.”

  “You do?” she whispered, incred-
ulous, wondering joy dawning in her
eyes. “You do, John Thorn?”

  There was a long moment in which
Lana’s shining blue eyes clung to his,
as he stared through the door-grating.
And in that moment, the psychophone
attached to the girl was speaking
metallically on, stiltedly trying to
voice her rush of joyous emotions.

  Sual Av stirred restlessly beside
Thorn. He and Gunner Welk had
listened in silence until now.

  “John, we’d better not be lingering
here,” the Venusian cautioned.

  “Yes, this is no place for love talk,”
rumbled Gunner. “God help us if
Cheerly catches us here before we get
Lana out!”

  “Cheerly!” The psychophone spoke
the girl’s blazing thought as she heard
the name. “I hate that traitor!”

  “Lana, what have Cheerly and Has-
kell Trask done to you?” Thorn ex-
claimed, his face hardening. “Have
they harmed you ?”

  “Since they brought me here they’ve
had this psychophone attached to me,”
Lana said bitterly. “All these days
I’ve sat here trying not to think of the
secret of Erebus that they want. And
I’ve known that sooner or later I’d
slip and think of it.”

  Each time Lana spoke, the psycho-
phone was metallically speaking also,
voicing the thought behind her words.

  “They mustn’t get that secret!” she
cried. “On the way here I learned by
overhearing Cheerly’s talk, why they
want it. There’s a mass of radite on
Erebus, and that’s what they're after.
They plan to use that radite against
the Alliance in their coming attack.
They intend to make atomic bombs of
the radite!”

  “Radite bombs?” exclaimed Thorn,
his face blanching under its stain.
“Good God, one atomic bomb charged
with that super-powerful stuff would
destroy a whole metropolis!”

  “Then that is the terrible new agent
of destruction we heard the League
THE THREE PLANETEERS

69

was planning!” hissed Gunner Welk.

  “That is why Haskell Trask is de-
laying his attack on the Alliance until
he gets the radite from Erebus!”
Lana exclaimed. “He wants to fol-
low up his expected naval victory by
a terrific bombing that will break all
the inner world’s resistance. That’s
why I’d rather die then give them the
secret of Erebus!”

 The girl looked at John Thorn
through the grating with pleading
earnestness in her worn white face.

  “John, I told you I hated Earth for
what it had done to my father, that its
fate didn’t concern me. But when I
heard what Trask plans to do to Earth
and the other Alliance planets, I real-
ized Earth is still my native world,
that I couldn’t let that happen.

  “And it’s your native world, too,
John. Even though you Planeteers
are outlaws, you’re bound to the inner
worlds by blood and birth just as I am.
We mustn’t let Trask's plan succeed!”

I^TOW was the moment to explain.
i.^1 “Lana, we Planeteers are not
really outlaws at all!” Thorn said
eagerly. “We’re secret agents of the
Alliance, and we’re after that radite
on Erebus because it can save the Al-
liance from defeat when the League
attacks.”

  “Then I’ll tell you the secret of Ere-
bus !” the girl cried joyfully. “If. it
means saving the Alliance worlds
from conquest, as you say—”

  “Hush, Lana! Don’t think of it now!
Wait!”

  Sual Av had been searching the
bodies of the two slain guards. The

Venusian hastened back now to
Thorn’s side.

  “John, there’s no wave-key on those
guards,” he reported anxiously. “How
are we going to get Lana out?”

  “We’ll have to break through this
cell-door somehow!” Thorn exclaimed
urgently.

  “Break through an inertrum door?”
said Gunner Welk incredulously.

  A quick examination of the door
justified the big Mercurian’s doubt.
The heavy inertrum of the door would
resist even their atom-pistols. And
the wave-lock was wholly invulner-
able.

  “We’ve got to get her out some-
how!” Thorn cried.

  “John, listen to me,” said Lana
quickly. “You can’t get me out. But
you Planeteers can get away, by the
way you came. I’ll tell you the secret
of Erebus, the way to land on that
world safely, and you three can get
away and go there and lift the radite.
Even though Cheerly and Trask read
the secret from the psychophone rec-
ord. you’ll have a start on them.”

 “But we can’t leave you here,
Lana!” Thorn cried desperately.
“Just when you and I have found each
other—”

  “You must!” she declared, her blue
eyes bright with purpose. “What is
my safety against that of all the inner
worlds?”

  “She’s right, John,” said Sual Av in
a low, strained voice. “God knows I
hate to go and leave her here. But
remember, we promised the Earth
Chairman we’d do anything to get that
radite.”	| Turn page]

STARTLING STORIES

  “We’ve got to do it, yes,” muttered
Gunner. His huge fists clenched. “But
we'll come back, and if they’ve harmed
her—"

  John Thorn faced crucial decision,
his mind torn by conflicting emotions.
His heart throbbed with desperate
anxiety for Lana. Yet clear before
him came the weary face of the Earth
Chairman, telling him the Alliance’s
last hope was in the Planeteers.

  “We'll—do it,” Thorn said hoarsely.
He could not say more. He could only
stare haggardly into Lana’s eyes.

  “Then listen to the secret of Erebus
that my father told me, John!” the
girl cried. “It is doom, hideous and
ghastly doom, to land anywhere on
Erebus except—”

  “Listen!” Sual Av cried suddenly.
“Someone is coming!”

  From beyond the locked door at the
end of the short corridor came a sound
of voices and approaching footsteps.

  “It must be the captain of guards on
his inspection!” exclaimed Lana fear-
fully.

  “No time to get back to that drain!”
Thorn rapped. “Quick, into one of
these cells! Drag those bodies in,
too!”

  In an instant, he and the Venusian
and Mercurian had seized the scorched
bodies of the two dead guards and had
dragged them into an empty cell
across the corridor from Lana’s cell.
As they swung shut the door of their
hiding place, the door at the end of
the corridor opened, and men entered
the prison.

JOHN THORN, peering through
the grating in the door of the hid-
ing place, stiffened in every muscle as
he saw the men. One of them was a
tall Saturnian captain of guards. An-
other was an obese, waddling figure
with a puffy green face and piglike
little eyes—Jenk Cheerly.

  But it was the third man of the
group, the one who strode in front,
upon whom Thorn’s eyes riveted.
This man was a middle-aged Saturn-
ian of tall stature, with a bony, nerv-
ous green face and very deep, dark
eyes that stared gloomily straight
ahead.

  “Haskell Trask!” murmured Sual
Av in Thorn’s ear, his faint whisper
surcharged with excitement.

  Haskell Trask, self-appointed
Leader of the League of Cold Worlds,
absolute dictator of Jupiter, Saturn,
Uranus and Neptune! Thorn’s pulse
pounded at sight of that bony, nerv-
ous face.

  “Why are no guards on duty here
as I ordered?” Jenk Cheerly was ask-
ing the captain of guards in his
squeaky voice.

  “I did station two here, sir,” replied
the officer worriedly to the fat spy-
master. “They must have sneaked out
for some reason. I’ll have them court-
martialed for it.”

  “I should have put my own Secret
Police here instead of depending on
you,” said Cheerly in vicious anger.
“You’ve failed in your duty, Captain.”
“No man must fail in his duty now!”
declared Haskell Trask in his harsh,
high, fanatical voice. “In this great
hour when we approach our fated des-
tiny, every man in the League worlds
must give his all for the tremendous
and glorious work that faces us!”
Haskell Trask spoke as though he
were exhorting a crowd of thousands,
his voice incongruously declamatory.
His gloomy eyes flashed with a deep
fire, his tall, bony figure rigid.

  John Thorn felt a chill as he heard.
The voice and face of Trask were
those of a madman, a man utterly con-
vinced of the rightness of his actions
and the wickedness of his enemies.

  The captain hurried ahead to the
door of Lana’s cell and was turning
the invisible beam of a wave-key on
its lock. Trask and the fat Uranian
spymaster halted and waited.

  “John, we can gun down Trask from
here!” Sual Av whispered excitedly,
tensely fingering his atom-pistol.

  “No—killing Trask now wouldn't
stop the League, for there are a hun-
dred of his underlings ready to take
his place," Thorn muttered tautly.
“Wait! I’ve a better plan.”

  The door of Lana’s cell clicked open.
Watching through the grating, the
Planeteers saw the dictator stride into
the girl’s prison-room, followed by
Jenk Cheerly and the captain.
THE THREE PLANETEERS

71

  “—almost morning. Days and nights
arc so short on Saturn,” the psycho-
phone was speaking forth Lana’s
thoughts.

 Thorn understood. Lana was try-
ing to avoid giving away the presence
of the Planeteers, by thinking of other
things.

 Haskell Trask surveyed the girl
bound in the chair, his gloomy eyes
meeting her defiant blue ones.

  “Are you ready yet to tell us what
we want to know, girl?” he demanded
harshly.

 Lana made no vocal answer. But
the psychophone spoke her thoughts.

  “I’ll never tell them! Never!”

  Trask’s nervous face twitched vio-
lently and he seemed seized by a rag-
ing passion. He flung his arms out
widely.

 “Everything is against me in my
great task—everything!” he cried with
theatrical self-pity. “But I shall per-
severe and conquer in spite of every-
thing! The system shall see!”

  “Perhaps the girl has given away the
secret to the psychophone by now, sir,”
Jenk Cheerly suggested hastily.
"Shall I examine the record?”

TRASK nodded curtly. The fat
spymaster reached up and touched
a switch of the recorder. Instantly
from it began speaking the recorded
thoughts of Lana, as spoken by the
psychophone in the preceding hours
and phonographically recorded on the
tape.

  John Thorn soundlessly opened the
door behind which he and his com-
rades were hidden, and whispered
tautly to them.

 “Come on—but don’t shoot Trask,
yet!”

  Haskell Trask and Cheerly were so
intently listening to the record that
they did not see the armed Planeteers
appear silently at the open door of the
cell. But the captain saw, and uttered
a startled cry. Trask and the fat spy-
master spun around.

 “Hands high!” John Thorn rapped,
his atom-pistol leveled. “Quick, or
we'll blast you down!”

  Stupefiedly. the three men in the cell
raised their hands. Haskell Trask’s

bony face went livid with rage.

  “You dare turn weapons upon me!”
he choked to the disguised Planeteers.
“Upon me, your Leader!”

  But Cheerly’s pig eyes suddenly
widened as the fat spymaster’s gaze
searched Thorn’s green-stained face.

  “These aren’t men of ours, sir!” he
cried to the dictator. “I know them—
they’re the Three Planeteers!”

  “The Planeteers!" exclaimed Trask.
His deep eyes blazed. “The outlaws
whose brazen robberies have made us
so much trouble in the past, who have
stolen so many of our secrets—”
Thorn interrupted in a hard, cold
voice. “Take their guns, Sual Av.
Gunner, release Lana. Careful with
those nerve connections.”

  In a moment the girl was freed, and
the Venusian had the weapons of
Cheerly and the captain. Trask had
been unarmed.

  “We’re going out of here with this
girl,” Thorn told the Saturnians icily.
“We’re going to that court nearby
where the space-cruisers are parked.
You three are going to lead us there,
by the shortest and least-used route.
If we are challenged by anybody, or if
there is any alarm, your Leader here
will die first.”

  The captain gasped with horror at
the threat, and Cheerly’s pig eyes nar-
rowed. But Trask's bony face was un-
moved.

  “You cannot kill me,” the dictator
told Thorn harshly. “Destiny has re-
served me for a great work.”

  “My trigger-finger can change des-
tiny pretty quick, Saturnian!” warned
Gunner Welk, his voice throbbing
with hate.

  Thorn motioned to the door at the
end of the corridor.

  “Get going, and remember my warn-
ing! Lana, keep beside me.”

  They started, Haskell Trask and
Cheerly and the captain moving with
hands upraised, the Planeteers follow-
ing with weapons leveled. Lana stag-
gered, her limbs numbed by long con-
finement in her bonds, the back of her
head aching. Thorn helped her along
tenderly with his free arm.

  They passed thus through the door
at the end of the corridor, out of the
72

STARTLING STORIES

dungeon into the dusky, diverging
corridors that ran in a labyrinth here
beneath the great citadel. No one was
in sight in these passages as they went
forward. Thorn’s hopes soared.

IF they could get away with Lana
to where old Stilicho’s ship wait-
ed out in the rings, they would soon
be racing toward Erebus! And with
Lana’s secret knowledge to help
them—

  They were passing a dark cross-cor-
ridor at this moment. And Sual Av
suddenly whirled around to face it.

  “Look out—a trap!” he yelled wild-
ly-

 “They’ve got a damper!” shouted
Gunner Welk, leveling his atom-pis-
tol swiftly to fire.

 Too late! The Mercurian’s atom-
pistol only clicked futilely. Thorn
pulled trigger, but his weapon too was
dead.

 A score of Saturnian guards had
been lying in wait in that shadowy
cross-passage! And one of them held
a cylindrical damper pointed toward
them—an electrical mechanism that
generated a short-range beam of vibra-
tory force which damped or neutral-
ized the electric propulsion-currents
of any atom-gun’s barrel solenoid,
rendering it useless. The damper’s
beam covered the Planeteer’s guns.

  The Saturnian soldiers poured out
of the cross-passage onto the Plane-
teers. Thorn clubbed his useless gun
and tried to get at Haskell Trask, but
went down under a smothering mass
of green-faced men. He heard Lana
scream as he fought fiercely.

 The one-sided fight ended. Thorn
was jerked to his feet by four Saturn-
ians who gripped him. Sual Av and
Lana were similarly held. Gunner
Welk lay unconscious on the floor.

 “We shall now find out why these
Planeteers came here and who they
are working for!” Haskell Trask de-
clared.

  “But they dared threaten you, sir!”
protested the tall captain. “They de-
serve instant execution for that
crime.”

  “The indignity to me is nothing,”
declared the dictator fanatically. “I

am thinking only of the great cause
we all serve.”

  “You Planeteers are not as cunning
as I thought,” Jenk Cheerly told
Thorn tauntingly, “or you’d have
guessed that there would be a spy-
plate outside the entrance to the dun-
geon.”

 Thorn’s heart sank. So that was
how they had been detected—by a hid-
den spy-plate outside the dungeon en-
trance, by which a distant officer could
keep watch over all who entered or
left the prison. The spy-plate watcher
had seen them forcing the dictator and
the other two ahead of them, and had
summoned guards with a damper to
nullify the Planeteers’ weapons and
make sure they had no chance to harm
the Leader when they were captured.

  Thorn’s wild hopes had crashed in
utter ruin. He could not face Lana.
He felt with bitter self-reproach that
he had failed her, and that he had
failed the Alliance.

CHAPTER XIV
Under the Psychophones

A METALLIC voice was speak-
ing.

 “—distance from the sun to Mer-
cury is thirty-six million miles. To
Venus it is sixty-seven million
miles—”

 The psychophone suspended over
John Thorn’s head droned on in its
monotonous metallic voice, speaking
his thoughts.

  He sat in one of the blue-lit cells,
bound by broad leather straps into a
chair. Sual Av and Gunner Welk sat
nearby, similarly bound. And they
too had psychophones attached by
thin black wires to tiny incisions in
the back of their skulls.

  “—distance to Earth is ninety-three
million miles. Earth—doomed now,
and my fault. They’ll never get that
radite that would—no, don’t think of
that! Distance to Mars, a hundred
and forty-one million miles! To Ju-
piter—”

 Thorn was desperately trying to
THE THREE PLANETEERS

73

keep his mind upon abstract things
and figures. For two days and nights
he and his comrades had sat bound
here like this. Time had become
meaningless, and it seemed to him that
he had sat here thus forever, trying to
think of anything except what Has-
kell Trask wanted to know.

  Trask had ordered psychophones
attached to the captured Planeteers.
For Trask knew now that the Plane-
teers were secret agents of the Alli-
ance, and that they were after the Ere-
bus radite. The dictator had learned
that from Lsna’s psychophone record,
which had transcribed the informa-
tion when Thorn had told it to her
through the door of her cell.

  “So that is why the Planeteers have
seemed to blunder into so many of our
secrets in these last few years!” Trask
had exclaimed. “It wasn’t blundering,
but deliberate purpose."

  “If they were out to get that radite
for the Alliance, that must mean that
the Alliance has some plan of using
the radite against us!” Jenk Cheerly
had pointed out shrewdly.

  “Why did the Alliance send you to
get the radite?" Trask had demanded
of the Planeteers.

  Thorn and Gunner and Sual Av had
remained silent. And the tall, bony
dictator had been seized by one of his
rages.

  “You refuse to tell ? Then you shall
sit with psychophones attached to you
until your thoughts disclose why the
Alliance wants that radite!

  “See to it, Cheerly,” the dictator
had ordered the fat spymaster. “And
put the girl back under the psycho-
phone again and keep her there until
she yields the secret of Erebus.”

  Thorn had seen Lana dragged back
into her cell, before he and his com-
rades were placed in another cell. The
tiny incisions in their skulls had been
rapidly made, and the little electrodes
of three psychophones inserted. And
they had sat here ever since, the re-
morseless mechanisms speaking and
recording all their conscious
thoughts.

  John Thorn’s mind hovered on the
brink of absolute despair. It was Lana
he was thinking of. The girl, he knew,

could not withstand the awful strain

of this diabolical mental inquisition
much longer. She would surely soon
give way under the strain and let her
mind wander to the secret that, their
captors wanted.

  “—if she does, it’s the end of every-
thing,” the psychophone above spoke
Thorn’s thoughts. “She mustn’t—”

THEN, discovering that he had let
his mind stray from abstract
things, Thorn fiercely forced his
thoughts back to safe subjects. He
made himself concentrate on inter-
planetary history.

  “The first space-flight was made by
Robert Roth in nineteen-ninety-six.
Roth visited Venus and Mars, and in
two thousand and one made a second
flight to Jupiter and Saturn, but
crashed upon his return to Earth and
lived only two days. After his death
his chief aide, Clymer Nison, visited
Uranus, Neptune and Pluto, but Cly-
mer Nison never returned from an at-
tempt he made to visit Erebus—
“Keep your mind off Erebus! If
you think of Erebus, you’ll think of
the radite and the Alliance weapon—
keep thinking of interplanetary his-
tory! First permanent colonies estab-
lished on Mars and Venus by two
thousand and eighty-five. By twenty-
one-fifty all the planets from Mercury
to Neptune had been colonized. The
first independence movements started
in twenty-four-seventy, and by two
centuries later, all the colonized plan-
ets had become independent worlds.”
As Thorn desperately strove to keep
his mind concentrated on interplane-
tary history, his two comrades were
using similar stratagems to keep from
revealing any information.

  He could hear the psychophone at-
tached to Sual Av blaring forth the
bald Venusian’s thoughts.

  “—and then there was that fat girl
on Callisto—what the devil was her
name?” Sual Av was thinking. “Can’t
remember her name, but I do remem-
ber that she was plenty big. Callisto’s
gravitation was so weak that she
seemed light as a feather, but if I’d
held her on my knee on any other
world, she’d have flattened me! And
74

STARTLING STORIES

then that tiger-cat of a Martian wench
I met when I was engineer at the Syr-
tis chromium mines. Tried to knife
me one night—”

  Sual Av was obviously thinking of
all the girls he had ever known, to oc-
cupy his thoughts safely. But Gun-
ner Welk's psychophone was pouring
forth a much different stream of
thoughts.

  The big Mercurian, ever since their
incarceration under the psycho-
phones, had occupied himself in
thinking of what he would do to Has-
kell Trask if the opportunity ever of-
fered.

  “—glue his eyelids open and stake
him out on the hot side of Mercury to
look at the sun a while. No, he’d die
too quick that way! It’d be better to
take his skin off with that acid the
Jovian tanners use, and then—”

  The cell was like a bedlam to John
Thorn's dazed mind. The three psy-
chophones blaring metallically and
without pause had become a torment
to his ears.

  He felt that he could not stand this
much longer. And he understood now
the full horror of the days that Lana
had spent under the relentless instru-
ment. And Lana was again being tor-
tured by the psychophone!

  On and on the hours dragged. The
blue-lit cell swam about Thorn, and he
closed his eyes tightly. Yet still the
remorseless machine blared his
thoughts, repeating interplanetary
history, chemical formulae, mathemat-
ical tables—anything that would keep
his mind on safely abstract subjects.

  Thorn had cudgeled his mind for a
means of escape. But there seemed
none. He and his comrades were
bound into their metal chairs by the
broad leather straps. The door of
their cell was secured by one of the
invulnerable wave-locks. And two
guards—two of Cheerly’s Secret Po-
lice this time—stood on constant duty
out in the dungeon corridor.

  Thorn dozed finally. It was his
only escape from the torment of the
blaring psychophone. Yet he could
sleep for but a brief period at a time,
and he was dully unsurprised when he
awakened a little later.

HE went rigid in his bonds. He
had been awakened by the en-
trance of Jenk Cheerly into their cell.

  The Uranian spymaster’s puffy
green face showed suppressed excite-
ment. His little eyes were gleaming
triumphantly.

  “You Planeteers may as well give
up and tell why the Alliance wants the
radite, now,” he said exultantly.

  Thorn made no vocal answer, but his
raging thoughts blared from the psy-
chophone.

  “If I could just close my hands on
that fat throat—just once—”

  The psychophones of Sual Av and
Gunner were voicing similar thoughts
as they gazed with blazing eyes at
Cheerly.

  The fat Uranian sneered. “It’s too
bad you lads still feel that way. For
the Alliance will never get the radite
now, anyway. The League is going
to get it. Lana Cain has just given
up the secret of Erebus at last!”

  “That’s a lie!” John Thorn shouted.
“A trap to make us talk!”

  “It’s the truth,” Cheerly taunted tri-
umphantly. “Did you think the girl
could go on forever without thinking
of the secret? The more she tried not
to think of it, the more her mind
turned toward it. You’ll find out the
same thing will happen to you."

  There was such visible triumph and
excitement in the Uranian’s fat face
that Thorn felt a pang of fear.

  At that moment there was a clang
of opening doors, and a tramp of feet.
Haskell Trask strode into the cell, his
bony face and deep eyes ablaze with
excitement.

  “You reported that the girl has
finally told what she knows about Ere-
bus, Cheerly?” the dictator exclaimed.

  “Yes, sir,” answered the obese spy-
master triumphantly. “Her mental
control finally weakened, and she
thought of what her father had told
her. The psychophone put it all into
the record.

  “With what she told to guide us, we
can land safely on Erebus and get the
radite, sir!” the Uranian continued ex-
ultantly. “We wouldn’t have had a
chance without her secret. For it
seems that there’s only one spot on
THE THREE PLANETEERS

75

Erebus where men can land without
meeting a ghastly fate.”

  Haskell Trask’s pale green, bony
face twitched with visible emotion.
The dictator’s gloomy eyes flashed.

  "You’ll sail at once for Erebus and
get the radite!" he ordered Cheerly.
“A naval cruiser is waiting in the
court now. As soon as you get the
radite and start back with it, flash
word to me by audio. When I get
your message, I’ll order our fleets to
blast sunward at once for the attack
on the Alliance.”

  His fists clenched. “Then at last our
day will have come! Even while our
fleets are crushing the Alliance navies,
we will be making that radite into
bombs that will break the resistance of
the inner worlds utterly.”

  "I’ll take the girl and a psychophone
with me to Erebus, sir,” Cheerly said
shrewdly. “She may know a little
more about Erebus than her conscious
thoughts have revealed. If that is so,
I’ll get it out of her.”

  Trask, recalled from his oratorical
flight, nodded his head indifferently.

  “Take her, then. But make all speed
to Erebus and back. Remember, the
mightiest armada in the system’s his-
tory will be waiting for your message
as a signal for it to sail sunward!”

JOHN THORN had listened in
gathering horror. This was the
end of all hope, surely! Cheerly
would get the radite and there would
be no chance for the Alliance ever to
operate Philip Blaine’s great secret
weapon in the lunar caverns—

 "—Philip Blaine’s great secret
weapon in the lunar caverns,” the
psychophone attached to Thorn was
blaring.

 Too late, Thorn suppressed his
thoughts! In his momentary horror,
he had let his thoughts stray, and the
psychophone over his head had been
speaking them.

  “Did you hear that, sir?” cried Jenk
Cheerly to the dictator. “A secret
weapon of the Alliance, built by the
physicist Philip Blaine in the caverns
of Earth’s moon! That’s why the Alli-
ance wanted the radite—to operate
that weapon!”

  Haskell Trask’s eyes snapped. The
dictator strode to where Thorn sat
cursing his own loss of mental control
that gave the secret away.

  "What is the weapon that the Alli-
ance has hidden in the lunar caves?"
he demanded of Thorn. “Speak,
Earthman!”

  Thorn remained rigidly silent.
With a violent burst of anger, the dic-
tator struck him across the face.

  “We’ve got to find out what that
secret Alliance weapon is!” Trask
snapped to his spymaster. “There’s
just a chance they might be able to
operate it without the radite.”

  “He’ll give it away to the psycho-
phone, in time,” Cheerly assured his
master. “He can’t help but give it
away—the psychophone pulls out all
their secrets, sooner or later.”

  “You’re wrong this time,” John
Thorn said bitterly. “I don’t know the
nature of the Alliance weapon. None
of us know it—and I’m damned glad
now we don’t!”

  "He’s lying, of course,” Jenk
Cheerly said calmly. "But he’ll have
to think the truth, sooner or later.”
"We’ll keep these Planeteers under
the psychophones until they do tell
what that weapon is,” Trask declared
harshly. “Meanwhile, don’t delay,
Cheerly. Get started now for Erebus!”
John Thorn writhed as Lana was
brought out of her cell by two of
Cheerly’s men, and carried down the
corridor. He could just glimpse her
white, worn face through the grating
in the door, and heard her despairing,
sobbing cry.

  "John, I gave up the secret to them.
I couldn’t keep from thinking of it
longer! And now they’re taking me
with them to Erebus. Everything is
lost, and it’s all my fault!”

  "Lana, it’s not your fault!” Thorn
cried hoarsely. "Lana—”

  But she was gone. For a moment,
Jenk Cheerly’s fat, green face grinned
in at them through the grating. His
eyes were sinister and hateful.

  "Goodbye, Planeteers,” the Uranian
squeaked mockingly. “Wish me a
pleasant voyage to Erebus—for by the
time I get back with the radite, you
three will be dead!”

CHAPTER XV
Through the Tempest

STORM raged over nighted Satur-
nopolis. Dazzling sheets of weird
crimson lightning seared across the
sky, and thunder bawled hoarsely like
a hubbub of giants. Torrents of rain
and of big hailstones battered the dark
metropolis. This was one of the
periodic "satellite storms” which oc-
cur whenever three or more of the
ringed planet’s moons are in conjunc-
tion, exerting their combined gravi-
tational pull to set up tidal dis-
turbances in the deep atmosphere.

  The great citadel of the dictator
loomed vague and black in the tem-
pest, its windows shining with blue
light. Even night and storm could
not lessen the intense activity that was
going on in this nerve-center of the
League of Cold Worlds, as Haskell
Trask and his lieutenants drew up
their final plans for the greatest con-
quest in history.

  Deep down in the dungeon below
the citadel, the roar of the raging
storm was muted to a deep, continu-
ous rumbling. And down here in the
blue-lit cell, John Thorn was working
feverishly.

  He was hitching his chair across the
floor, an inch at a time, by throwing
his body forward in his leather bonds.
Slowly, he was edging toward the
chairs of his two sleeping comrades.

  “—got to make it tonight or never!”
Thorn’s psychophone was droning.
“They’ll read my plan from the record
when they next take and examine it
We’ve got to make it before then—”

  Thorn's face was haggard, his eyes
burning with a febrile light. His brain
had conceived a desperate hope of
escape.

  Days and nights had passed since
Jenk Cheerly had sailed for Erebus,
with Lana Cain his prisoner. How
many days and nights, Thorn could not
estimate exactly. Time had become a
blur to him as he and his comrades sat
bound here beneath the psychophones.

Thorn had felt his mind cracking

from strain as the hours and days
dragged. He had almost felt that if he
had known what Trask wanted to
know, the nature of the Alliance’s
secret weapon, he would have told it. *
He had been glad then they did not
know it.

  Most agonizing of all in those
blurred hours had been the thought of
Cheerly, on his way to far Erebus with
Lana. The Uranian would come back
with the radite. But he would not
bring Lana back, once all her possible
usefulness was ended!

  Tonight, an hour before, Trask’s
men had removed from the Planeteers’
psychophones the spools of tape which
contained the record of their thoughts
for the last day and night. New
spools had been inserted and the men
had left. It had been then that
Thorn's feverish mind had suddenly
conceived his crazy plan of escape.

  As he thought of the plan, the psj'-
chophone had spoken it and the re-
corder had transcribed it. And so
Thorn knew that he must put the plan
into effect before the record was ex-
amined again, or his plan would be
read from the record and forestalled.

  Thorn, convulsively rocking his
chair forward, prayed inwardly that
the rumble of the storm would keep
the two guards out in the corridor
from hearing. He inched on, his chair
moving slowly, the thin black wires
that connected his skull to the psycho-
phone above, slowly lengthening out.
Finally Thorn had got his chair close
to those in which Gunner Welk and
Sual Av were sleeping exhaustedly.

 “Gunner!” Thorn whispered
fiercely. “Wake up!”

TiHE big Mercurian slowly opened
bleared, red-rimmed eyes. Sual
Av also awoke, yawning. Their psy-
chophones started droning their awak-
ening thoughts.

  "Gunner, I want you to tip your
chair over to bring your head down
on my chair,” Thorn whispered.
“Then maybe you can chew through
one of these leather straps that bind
my arms."

  “What good would that do?” said
Gunner with dull hopelessness. “Even
THE THREE PLANETEERS

77

if we all three got free of our bonds,
we couldn’t get out of this cell—not
with the door bolted by a wave-lock.”

  “I’ve an idea that might get us out!”
Thorn said feverishly. “It’s a chance—
our only one!”

  “Try it, Gunner!” urged Sual Av,
wide awake now.

  With no hope in his face, Gunner
Welk obeyed. He rocked back and
forth in his chair until it tipped for-
ward, his head coming down against
Thorn’s lap. Hitching painfully side-
wise, the big Mercurian got his teeth
into one of Thorn’s leather arm-straps.

  They heard his jaws working as he
bit into the tough Jovian leather.
Their psychophones continued to
drone on, uttering their varying
thoughts. But the rumble of the rag-
ing storm above was loud enough to
keep the guards in the corridor from
hearing.

  Thorn felt the strap Gunner was
chewing weaken. He tensed his arm
in a fierce effort. The strap broke!

  Quickly, Thorn unbuckled the other
straps that held him. He tipped Gun-
ner’s chair back to normal position.
Then he reached around and with
numbed fingers found the tiny,
needle-like electrode at the back of his
skull, and gently pulled it out. He
felt his scalp close over the minute
incision. His psychophone went silent.

  Thorn got to his feet. He stag-
gered, his numbed limbs buckling
under him at first. Then he steadied,
and unbuckled the straps that held
Sual Av and the Mercurian to their
chairs.

  “Don't disconnect your psycho-

phones yet!” he warned them. “If the
guards outside happened to notice
that all our psychophones were dead,
they’d suspect something at once.”
“Now what?” Sual Av whispered.
“How can we get out of this cell with-
out a wave-key to operate the lock?”
“Yes, what’s your idea?” Gunner
asked hoarsely.

  “It came to me as I watched them
changing spools in the psychophones
tonight,” Thorn muttered. “I shut
my mind off it till after they’d gone,
so they wouldn't hear.”

  He was taking down from its mount-
ing the psychophone that for so many
days had blared his thoughts. With
quivering fingers, he began dissem-
bling the intricate little machine.
Tubes and coils and condensers came
from it, as he rapidly took it apart.

  “There are enough parts here,” he
muttered feverishly. “If I can just
remember enough of my tech-school
training.”

  Thorn began putting certain parts of
the mechanism back together again, in
a totally different hook-up. The tiny
atomic generator that furnished
power, the transformers and rectifiers
—and then he worked long upon re-
wiring an “alternator,” connecting it
electrically to a master modulator
tube.

  An hour passed—and another. The
hubbub of storm was even louder
from above. The droning of the other
two Planeteers’ psychophones was al-
most inaudible through the roar.

  Thorn finally straightened, holding
the compact rebuilt mechanism in

trembling hands. His face was drip-
ping.

  “Now for it!”, he whispered shakily
to the other two Planeteers. He ad-
vanced with the little machine to the
locked door.

  “You've rebuilt the psychophone
parts into a wave-projector?” Sual Av
whispered, staring. “To use as a
wave-key?”

  “It won’t work,” Gunner muttered.
“It may project waves, but you don’t
know the secret frequency that will
operate this lock. It might be any one
of countless possible frequencies.”

UT Thorn only nodded.

  “I thought of that!” he said
hoarsely. “I built an automatic modu-
lator into the thing. It will start pro-
jecting waves of frequency down in
the sixteenth octave, and run up to
the forty-fifth, by steps of twenty vi-
brations each. You know all wave-
locks are keyed in those octaves, for
above them you get heat radiations.”

  “It might work,” Sual Av agreed.
"Most locks have an error-margin of
ten vibrations per second, so your au-
tomatic step-ups ought to overlap all
frequencies in those octaves.”

  Thorn was already at the door. He
held the end of his little makeshift
projector against the inertrum door
just inside the wave-lock. He was
counting on the high power of his vi-
brations to penetrate the inertrum
from inside, and reach the lock.

  The little projector hummed as he
touched its switch. Invisible waves
were shooting from it into the lock,
changing frequency by 20-vibration
jumps each fraction of a second.

  In a moment came a click from the
wave-lock! The bolt had drawn back,
as the right frequency released the
lock.

 “By heaven, it worked!” Gunner
Welk exclaimed hoarsely, his eyes
lighting with wild hope now.

  Thorn peered tautly out through the
door-grating. The two SP guards on
duty were standing a few yards down
the corridor, evidently discussing the
storm that roared above.

Gunner and Sual Av now removed
the needlelike electrodes of the

psychophones from the tiny incisions
at the back of their skulls. They stag-
gered stiffly from the chairs to Thorn's
side, as he gently opened the unlocked
door.

  One of the SP men, seeing the cell
door open from the corner of his eye,
yelled and reached for his atom-pistol.

 “Get them!” Thorn shouted
hoarsely, lunging out.

 The charging Planeteers reached
the two Saturnians before they could
level the weapons they had drawn.
Thorn grabbed the atom-pistol of one
of the green men, and twisted fiercely.

  The Saturnian suddenly let go of the
gun and jumped back, clawing a
pocket-audio from his jacket. He
shouted wildly into the little instru-
ment.

  “Dungeon-guards calling for help!
The prisoners are—”

  Thorn brought the atom-pistol down
on the man’s head, and he sank with
a groan. Gunner and Sual Av had al-
ready knocked out the other guard,
and the Mercurian had his gun.

  “That call will bring guards down
here at once!” Thorn cried. “Quick—
the drain by which we got in here!
It’s our one chance now to get to the
space-ship court!”

 They ran down the short dungeon
corridor to the place where the drain
opened. The inertrum bars had been
reset in new cement to repair the
drain-grating, Thorn saw instantly.

 He leveled his gun and triggered
rapidly. The bursting flares of blind-
ing energy burned away the new ce-
ment, again freeing the inertrum
bars. As Gunner Welk bent and tore
loose the bars, Thorn heard over the
roar of the storm a rush of running
feet.

 “They’re coming!” he cried, and
leaped headfirst down into the narrow
tube. The others followed him.

 Thorn writhed down the cramped
pipe with frantic haste, ahead of the
Mercurian and Venusian. He heard
distant yells as soldiers burst into the
dungeon which they had just quitted.

IN a moment Thorn emerged head-
first into the place where the five
citadel drains converged into one big
THE THREE PLANETEERS

79

tube. Water was rushing down here,
flowing down through three of the
pipes that drained courts open to the
raging storm.

  “This is the drain that leads up to
the space-ship court!” he cried, scram-
bling into the right-hand pipe.

  As he crawled at the head of his
comrades up this different pipe, icy
floods of water from above smashed
unceasingly into his face. The drain
was almost full of downrushing
water. Blinded, gasping, he fought
upward through the tube until he
glimpsed the grating above, outlined
against terrific red lightning flares.

  Thorn drew his gun and fired up at
the grating through the rushing
water. The whizzing flare of bursting
atom-shells above was almost drowned
by another appalling burst of scarlet
lightning, accompanied by a tremen-
dous shock of thunder.

  He pushed on upward through the
streaming water. His hands found the
bars of this grating, loose where their
ends had been exposed by burning
away of the cement. With a convul-
sive effort, Thorn pushed the bars
upward and scrambled up into the
court.

  The full fury of the tremendous
Saturnian storm beat upon him in this
open court. Rattling showers of big
hailstones crackled like musketry, tor-
rents of icy rain smashing down upon
him from the black sky. Gunner and
Sual Av were scrambling up out of
the drain to his side.

  Blinding red lightning arced across
the heavens in awful, burning splen-
dor, and showed Thorn two small
space-cruisers parked near the center
of the court. It also showed him that
a troop of guards was running hastily
out from the other side of the court.

  “They’ve guessed we’d make for
these ships. Come on before they cut
us off!” he yelled hoarsely to his com-
rades.

  They plunged forward. The crim-
son lightning died, and in the succeed-
ing thick blackness, the whole citadel
rocked wildly about them to the deaf-
ening shock of thunder.

  The Planeteers collided with a wet
metal wall in the darkness. The side

of one of the ships! Then another fiz-
zing flare of fiery lightning showed
Thorn the ship door, a few feet away.

  He pushed the unsealed door in-
ward, and fell rather than jumped in-
side. As the other two Planeteer6
leaped in after him, through the bel-
lowing thunder came a shout of voices.

  Atom-shells flicked into the iner-
trum wall of the ship and exploded
in bright little bomb-bursts of light.
The guards running across the court
toward them were shooting.

  “Seal the door, Gunner!” Thorn
yelled wildly. “I’ll take her up!”

  He pitched forward in darkness
toward the control-room, Sual Av at
his heels. He heard the door grind-
ing shut as he pawed frantically for
the controls, standardized in all ships.

  More atom-shells flared outside. By
their glare, Thorn found the injector-
lever and pulled it frantically. The
power-chamber of the little ship burst
into a roar.

  The panel-lights sprang on as Sual
Av found the switch, Thorn leap-
ing to the firing-keys. His fingers
flashed down.

  With a nerve-shattering roar of all
keel tubes blasting, the little cruiser
shot almost vertically upward, rising
on spuming fire-jets out of the big
court at the heart of the citadel.

  Thorn cut in all stern tubes, and the
little ship screamed up on a steep
slant through the raging storm.
Rocked by buffeting bursts of thun-
der, lit by the dancing flares of red
lightning, it roared up across storm-
swept Saturnopolis with dizzying
speed.

  Sual Av had the oxygenators throb-
bing by now. Gunner Welk came
staggering into the control-room,
fighting the terrific acceleration pres-
sure. Up through the storm they
climbed till they were above the tem-
pest, the roar of air outside now fad-
ing away.

SUAL AV uttered an exultant cry
as they burst out of mists into
open space, with the colossal, gleam-
ing arc of the rings spanning the star-
thick black firmament ahead.

  “Clear space again!” he cried.
80

  “They'll call an alarm to all their
bases on the outer moons!” Thorn ex-
claimed. “If Stilicho isn’t waiting at
the rendezvous—”

  Everything depended now, all three
knew, on reaching the rende2vous in
the rings where old Stilicho Keene had
agreed to wait with the Venture, in
Cassini’s division at the west limb of
the planet-shadow.

  The colossal yellow bulk of Saturn
was behind them, the mighty bow of
the rings now close ahead. Thorn was
heading toward the segment of the
rings obscured by the shadow of the
planet. Their little ship raced above
the innermost, thinnest ring, roaring
at top speed low over the vast circular
swarm of whirling planetoids.

  Soon ahead yawned Cassini’s divi-
sion, the gap of clear space between
the two great outermost rings. As
Thom sent their craft flying down into
the gap at the point where the west
limb of the planet-shadow lay across
it, he flipped the audio-switch.

  “Stilicho, the Planeteers calling!”
he spoke into the instrument. "We’re
being chased. Where are you?”

  In a moment, there came a shrill, ex-
cited reply.

  “Coming, boy! We’ve got you in
our aura. Stand by and get your suits
on, and we’ll take you aboard!”

  A few moments later the long, grim-
lined Venture drove up from the gap
between rings, and hovered beside the
Planeteers’ little ship. The air-lock
of the pirate craft was open.

  Then a brief interval saw the Plane-
teers inside that air-lock, tearing off
the space-suits they had worn as they
jumped the gap between ships. And
the Venture was roaring on through
space with all the power of its great
tubes, away from Saturn.

  “I thought you boys were dead
sure!” Stilicho Keene was babbling
wildly to the Planeteers. “It’s been
days we’ve waited here. But where’s
Lana? You didn’t leave the lass be-
hind?”

  The old pirate’s wrinkled red face
and rheumy eyes were tense as his
cracked voice shrilled the question.
And Ool, the space-dog, looked up at
Thorn with pleading eyes.

 “Cheerly has Lana,” Thorn said
hoarsely. "He sailed in a navel cruis-
er for Erebus, days ago. He has
Lana’s secret now, but he took her
along in case she knew more than
she’d told.”

  “Erebus?” Old Stilicho’s wrinkled
face became ghastly. “God in heaven,
if he’s taken the lass there—”

  “We've got to follow them, Stili-
cho!” Thom cried. “For if Cheerly
gets what he wants on Erebus, he’ll
come back, but he’ll never bring Lana
back.”

 The old man’s faded eyes blazed.
“We’ll follow to Erebus, yes! I’d fol-
low the lass to hell itself!”

  They climbed hastily to the control-
room, where Stilicho seized the con-
trols from the Jovian pilot on duty
there.

  “Calling Titan and Iapetus bases!” a
Saturnian voice was yelling from the
audio-speaker excitedly. “All cruis- >
ers out in net-patrol! The Planeteers
are loose and breaking for space!”
“They can’t catch us now!” Gunner
cried fiercely.

 The Venture was already roaring
out to the orbit of Titan. Stilicho had
changed course, and the huge, ringed
bulk of Saturn and the small, bright
sun lay dead astern. They were head-
ing out toward the farthest limit of
the system, toward the Solar System’s
last home of mystery.

 Black reaction and apprehension
were cold in John Thorn’s heart as he
looked haggardly ahead. Could they
hope to overtake Cheerly’s ship when
it had such a start? And if they did
not, and so did not have Lana’s secret
knowledge to guide them, what would
be their fate when they reached
mysterious Erebus?

      CHAPTER XVI
      Forbidden World

THE frontier of the Solar System!
A vast and gloomy darkness, a
region of eternal night remote by six
billion trackless miles from the far,
bright star of the sun. A cold and

awful immensity of space beyond
which stretches only the shoreless
sea of the interstellar void.

  Yet even out into these far, dark
spaces reached the invisible grip of
the sun, to hold the outermost of its
planetary children. Out here in eter-
nal silence and darkness, far from the
flaming orb that gave it birth, sol-
emnly moved the dim world of Erebus
on its slow, stupendous patrol.

  A ship was moving out through the
colossal dark toward the last planet.
It was moving at tremendous speed
under inertia, yet it seemed merely to
bn crawling through the vast empti-
ness as it held its course toward the
dim, slowly largening sphere of Ere-
bus.

  John Thorn peered fixedly from the
window of the control-room at the
mysterious world ahead. It was like
a little ghost-world, shining in the
dark vault with a feeble blue light.

 “It must have an extraordinarily
high albedo to reflect so much sun-
light at this distance,” Thorn mut-
tered.

  “Yes, it’s cursed queer,” Sual Av
agreed, frowning intently.

  Beside the Planeteers, who had dis-
carded their Saturnian disguises, old
Stilicho Keene peered forward, a
haunting apprehension in his faded
eyes. The space-dog crouched at his
feet.

  Gunner Welk was at the eyepiece of
the ’scope, staring toward dim Erebus.
The towering Mercurian turned to
Thorn.

  “Cheerly’s ship isn’t in sight, John,”
he rumbled. “He must already have
landed on Erebus.”

 Thorn’s brown face contorted in
agonized emotion.

 “We should have overtaken him!”
he cried, his voice raw and self-accus-
ing. “If we’d put on a little more
speed—”

  “But boy, the Venture’s been at top
speed in all the long days since we
left Saturn!” Stiljcho quavered. “It’s
been like a nightmare voyage, with the
power-chambers throbbing to the lim-
it, and my crew getting more scared
each day, and us sailin’ on toward God
knows what on that world ahead I”

  It had, indeed, seemed like a strange
dream to all of them as their craft had
for days crept out into the trackless,
forbidding immensities. Stilicho’s pi-
rate crew had whispered fearfully,
only the hope of rescuing their idol-
ized girl leader keeping them from
mutinying. An alien chill gripped all
except John Thorn.

  Thorn had become more and more
feverishly anxious each day, as he
thought of Jenk Cheerly speeding on
with Lana to seize the precious radite,
the radite whose taking would signal
Lana’s death and the launching of
Trask’s attack on the Alliance!

  “Shall I try the spectro-telescope?”
Gunner was asking. “We’re near
enough to Erebus for it to detect the
radite.”

  Thorn nodded quickly. “The radite
should show up clearly. I’ll check our
aura again for Cheerly’s ship.”

 Thom snapped on the aura. But
something was wrong. The aura-
chart did not come on—the device was
dead.

  “What the devil?” Sual Av mut-
tered astonishedly. “Something must
be jamming the ether to kill our aura
like that.”

  “All our other instruments are dead,
too!” burst out Stilicho, looking up
worriedly from the panel. “The grav-
itometers and space-sextants and even
the audio!”

  “Is it some trick of Cheerly’s?” Sual
Av cried.

  “It couldn’t be—he wouldn’t have
power enough to jam the ether like
this,” Thom declared.

GUNNER WELK swung around
from his instrument, his massive
face puzzled.

  “John, there’s somethingwrongwith
this spectro-telescope, too,” he said.
“I adjusted its limits to the field of
radioactive elements, but all of Ere-
bus still shows up in it.”

  Old Stilicho looked anxiously from
the faintly shining blue ghost-world
ahead, to the puzzled Planeteers.

  “We’ll soon be close to Erebus,” the
old pirate said. “What are we going
to do? Land and hunt for Lana on
foot?”
STARTLING STORIES

  There was lurking terror in his
faded eyes as he made the proposition,
yet he kept his shrill voice steady.

  “We dare not just sail in and land,”
Thorn muttered. “It might mean the
end of us, right there.”

  His face worked. “Yet we daren’t
lose time either! If Lana had only
been able to tell us the secret.”

  “John, remember what Cheerly told
Trask in our cell on Saturn, after he’d
got the secret from Lana!” Sual Av
said eagerly. “That he’d learned from
Lana that there was only one spot on
Erebus where men could land without
meeting a ghastly fate!"

  “One spot, but where is it?” Gunner
demanded. “There's no use of our
hunting for that spot, for we wouldn’t
know it if we saw it."

  “Yes, we would know it!” Thorn
cried suddenly. “Cheerly’s ship would
have landed in that one safe spot. If
we can find where Cheerly has landed
here, we can land safely beside him!”
He swung around to Stilicho Keene.
“We’ll reduce speed and circle around
Erebus looking for Cheerly’s ship.
Don’t go lower than a hundred miles
above the surface.”

  Unutterable tension gripped the
Planeteers and the old pirate as the
Venture swept in closer toward the
mysterious planet from which only
one man in all history had returned.
Erebus slowly expanded ahead, a
small world hardly larger than Mer-
cury. At last the ship dropped to
within a hundred miles of its surface.

  It was a strangely luminous planet-
scape they looked down upon, a world
shimmering everywhere with the
dusky blue radiance they had noticed
from afar. They had thought that
faint luminescence a trick of reflected
sunlight, but they saw now that it
was somehow inherent in this world.
Through that dusky blue haze they
looked down upon a weirdly forbid-
ding landscape.

  Low, jagged, barren mountains rose
like fangs bared at the dark, star-
studded sky. Beyond their rocky
slopes stretched dim deserts, wide
blank wastes upon which moved little
whirls of dust. And all this dreary
landscape of eternal twilight was

wrapped in the uncanny faint blue
radiance.

  “It’s queer, the way it all shines,”
muttered Sual Av. “But I can’t see
anything dangerous down there.”
“There’s something dangerous there
—terribly so,” Thorn said tautly. “If
thereweren’t, thisworld wouldn’t have
swallowed up so many hundreds of
explorers in the last nine centuries!”
•‘There’s air of some kind down
there, anyway,” old Stilicho quavered.
“See them there whirling dust-dev-
ils?”

  “But there can’t be an atmosphere
here!” Gunner declared. “That would
mean that Erebus is comparatively
warm—and what would keep it warm
at this distance from the sun?”
“Everything about this world is
wrong, somehow,” Thorn muttered.
“The way it shines, its warmth and
atmosphere, the way our instruments
went dead when we neared it.”

THE Venture was now moving on
an even keel a hundred miles
above the surface of the ghostly blue
planet. Stilicho handled the controls
as they moved at reduced speed
around the equator of the mystery
world. Gunner Welk swept the ter-
rain beneath with the ’scope as they
sped along.

  The cruel, barren mountains swept
back and disappeared in the glowing
blue haze behind them. They moved
on above the endless wastes of faintly
shining desert.

  “Thought I saw something shiny
moving down there,” Gunner ex-
claimed in a moment. "My eyes must
be playing me tricks.”

  “Cheerly’s ship is what we want to
find,” Thorn rapped. “It’s somewhere
here. He hasn't had time to lift the
radite and leave, considering how fast
we followed him.”

  Within a few hours, they had com-
pletely circumnavigated the equator
of the little mystery world. They had
seen nothing but the deathly deserts
and mountains, wrapped in the un-
changing, shimmering blue haze.

  “Run north and circle the planet
again midway between the equator
and the pole,” Thorn ordered Stilicho.
THE THREE PLANETEERS

83

  “It’s kind of like lookin’ for a nee-
dle in a haystack, hunting one ship
on a whole world,” Stilicho muttered.

  “This world isn’t big—we'll sweep
every mile of it if necessary,” John
Thorn declared.

  Soon they were again circling Ere-
bus, midway between the equator and
the northern pole. Before they had
gone far, Gunner pointed to a black
speck on the northern desert horizon.

  “Something odd about that black
mountain yonder!” he reported from
the ’scope eyepiece. “It has none of
the shining haze over it—the only
place I’ve seen here that hasn’t.”

  “Steer toward it, but keep high,”
John Thorn told the old pirate.
"We’ll take a look."

  The black speck on the horizon ex-
panded rapidly as the ship rocketed
north. It grew into a big black moun-
tain that loomed in solitary majesty
out of a wide expanse of the haze-
wrapped desert, brooding beneath the
star-flecked dark sky.

  It was a mountain almost perfectly
dome-shaped, the regularity of its out-
line startling. It was two miles across
at the base, and a mile in height. It
stood out bold and black because none
of the shining blue haze hovered over
it.

  “Queer, the symmetrical shape of
that mountain,” Sual Av muttered. “Is
it possible that it i9—”

  “There’s a ship parked on that
mountain!” Gunner Welk yelled sud-
denly in high excitement.

  Thorn leaped to the ’scope eyepiece.
The huge, frowning black mass of the
domed mountain jumped into close
view. Upon the curved, rough eastern
side of the great mass, near the top,
rested a long, torpedo-like metal
shape.

  “It’s Gheerly’s cruiser!” Thorn ex-
claimed. “If they landed on that
black mountain, it must be the one
spot on Erebus where it’s safe to land.
We’re going to land there and seize
his ship!”

  He swung, his pulses hammering.
“Veer off, Stilicho, and run back to-
ward the mountain from the west at a
mile altitude! Cheerly can’t have seen
us yet. We’ll land on the west side of

the mountain and take him by sur-
prise!”

  The old pirate swung the Venture
in a wide detour, and soon they were
rocketing low toward the mountain
from the west, hidden by the domed
mass from the ship parked on the
other side. Expertly, the old Martian
brought the ship down to a landing on
the rough, curved western side of the
great mass.

AS the blasting roar of the rockets
died, Sual Av turned from the
instrument he had been manipulating.

  “The atmosphere checks as air, but
loaded with elements I can’t identify
it without analysis,” he reported.

  “We’ll play safe and wear our space-
suits,” Thorn declared. “Come on!"

  They hastened down into the mid-
compartment of the ship. Stilicho’s
motley pirate crew were waiting there,
all of them looking a little scared by
the fact that they had actually landed
upon the surface of Erebus.

  “We’re going over the top of this
mountain and capture Cheerly’s ship,"
Thorn rapped to them. “On suits,
everybody! And bring all the damp-
ers we have. There’s to be no using of
atom-guns unless absolutely neces-
sary, for we don’t want to hurt Lana.”

  Five minutes later, the big door port
of the Venture ground open. Out
through the air-lock moved the com-
pany of forty men, all in suits and hel-
mets, with John Thorn in the lead.

  Thorn noted that they stepped out
onto a rough, jagged surface of black
metal. The whole mountain, it seemed,
was of black metal, pocked here and
there with deposits of glistening ores.
The top of the dome-shaped mass
loomed starkly against the dusky,
starry sky.

  Thorn could not repress a tautening
of his nerves. This was Erebus, the
forbidden world that had claimed so
many explorers’ lives since nine cen-
turies ago. From the curving side of
the mountain on which the Venture
lay, he could look out westward across
the barren deserts, wrapped in mys-
terious, shimmering blue radiance.

  The little party was armed with sev-
eral of the cylindrical dampers that
84	STARTLING STORIES

could put atom-guns out of commis-
sion, and with atom-pistols belted out-
side their space-suits. They started
up the side of the metal mountain,
trudging against a gravitation that
was surprisingly strong for so small a
world. The Planeteers and old Sti-
licho led, and beside them ran the
space-dog, Ool, his green eyes blazing
as though he sensed they were on the
same world as Lana Cain.

  They reached the top of the domed
mountain, and Thorn crouched down
with his comrades to reconnoiter.
Cheerly’s ship, a long, many-gunned
Saturnian naval cruiser with the name
Cargo1 on its bows, lay only a few
hundred yards down the curved rough
metal slope. They could see a few
men in space-suits outside the ship,
digging glistening ores from the de-
posits that packed the metal moun-
tain.

  Sual Av’s voice reached Thorn by
conduction, as the Planeteers
crouched with the old pirate and the
space-dog.

  "They're digging fuel-ores for the
return trip,” the Venusian muttered.
“They can’t have sighted our ship.”

  Thorn nodded his glassite helmet
tensely. “Here we go,” he said, rising
to his feet and signaling the pirates
behind them. “Whatever you do, be
careful you don’t injure Lana!”

  The space-suited attackers swept
down the rough curve of the mountain
in a silent run toward the Saturnian
ship. They were half-way to it before
one of the diggers there glimpsed
them.

  Instantly, the man fired his atom-
pistol at them. The little shell struck
a man behind Thorn, a pirate who fell
as the blinding flare of energy envel-
oped him. Thorn swung the damper
he carried toward the Saturnian who
had fired, and killed his weapon.

  “Quick, men!” Thorn yelled, then
remembered that their audios were off,
and signaled with his arm.

  The little pirate band swept fiercely
down the metal slope. Out of the
ship, Saturnians in space-suits were
pouring and leveling atom-pistols.
The dampers carried by Thorn and
several of his men deadened many of

the weapons, but atom-shells from
others flared blindingly among the
pirates and felled a half-dozen men.

THEN Thorn and his followers
reached the Saturnians. It be-
came a fierce fight at close quarters,
shells of atom-pistols flaring and men
falling, under the solemn stars of the
dark sky. The space-dog leaped and
tore horribly with his great teeth and
talons among the enemy. Thorn
swung his heavy cylindrical damper
as a great club as he and Gunner and
Sual Av fought forward.

  The Saturnians, appalled by the
fierceness of the pirate attack, scram-
bled back through the air-lock of the
ship.

  “After them!” Thorn cried, waving
his arm in a fierce forward gesture.
“Don’t let them get away with the
ship!”

  Gunner flung the damper he carried,
and it jammed the air-lock door. Then
Thorn’s men were pushing into the
ship.

  In ten minutes, the fight inside the
ship was ended. Taken by surprise,
unprepared for an attack, the Satur-
nian crew had not been able to with-
stand the rush of Thorn’s followers.

  A dozen of the Saturnians lying
dead, the survivors stood with hands
raised in surrender. As soon as the
air-lock door was closed and the oxy-
generators functioning. Thorn ripped
off his helmet and ordered the massed
prisoners to take off their helmets
also.

  As each sullen green Saturnian face
emerged to view, Thorn’s pulse
pounded. But when all the prisoners
were unhelmeted, he felt a shock of
bitter disappointment. Neither Jenk
Cheerly nor Lana were in the ship!

  “Where’s Cheerly and the girl?” he
demanded fiercely of the crestfallen
Saturnian cruiser captain.

  “Cheerly left here yesterday, taking
two men and the pirate girl,” an-
swered the captain sullenly. “They
went toward those mountains west-
ward.”

  “Cheerly had located the radite
there?” Sual Av cried eagerly. The
Saturnian nodded sulkily.
THE THREE PLANETEERS

85

  “Yes, after we landed our ship here,
Cheerly worked with our spectro-
scopes until he ascertained that the
deposit of radite lay somewhere in
those mountains. He took the girl
with him because he believed she
knows exactly where it is, though she
said she didn’t.”

  “Then all we have to do is to wait
till Cheerly comes back here with the
radite, and grab him!” Gunner ex-
claimed.

  “No, we can’t do that!” Thorn cried.
“Cheerly would bring back the radite
—but he wouldn’t bring back Lana!
We’ve got to go after him!”

  “In our ship?” old Stilicho asked
eagerly.

  Thorn shook his head. “We daren’t.
This is the one safe place on Erebus
where a ship can land, remember.
We'll have to follow on foot, in our
space-suits.”

  He saw a quick gleam of satisfac-
tion in the sullen eyes of the Satur-
nian captain. And Thorn’s face tight-
ened.

  “You will come along with us,” he
told the green-faced captain suspi-
ciously.

  The Saturnian went livid. “I won’t
gol” he gasped, all his secret satisfac-
tion gone at once. “I won’t!”

  Thorn seized him by the throat,
“Why not?” he barked. “What are
you afraid of? What is it that made
you glad at the idea of us going on
foot to those mountains?”

  The Saturnian was silent, helpless
rage and fear contending in his face.

  “Tell, or I’ll make you walk out
there by yourBelf!” Thorn menaced.
The threat crumpled the captain’s
spirit.

  “I’ll tell!” he gasped. “It means a
hideous doom if you venture off this
mountain without protection. For all
the matter of those deserts and moun-
tains out there, all the matter of Ere-
bus except this single metal moun-
tain, is radioactive matter.

  “Erebus is a radioactive world!
That’s the secret the pirate girl knew,
that no one else guessed. A ship that
landed anywhere except on this moun-
tain would instantly itself become
radioactive by induced radioactivity

from the soil on which it landed. The
same fate would befall an unprotected
man who stepped off this mountain.
This metal mountain is the only non-
radioactive matter on the whole
planet!”

CHAPTER XVII
In the Shining Wastes

RADIOACTIVE world ! A
world, every atom of which was
throbbing with natural or induced
radioactivity, constantly emitting
streams of deadly radiation, changing
slowly and spontaneously through the
long ages into different elements far-
ther down the atomic scale! This,
then, was the secret of Erebus!

 The thing was so stupefying that
the Planeteers and old Stilicho and his
pirateB were silent, stunned. Every
man there looked wildly at his neigh-
bor, bewildered by the incredible as-
sertion the Saturnian captain made.

 “It’s impossible!” John Thorn
burst, finally. His eyes were almost
dazed in expression. “A whole world
of radioactive matter—it can’t be
true!”

  “It is true!” cried the Saturnian
captain fearfully. “The girl knew it
all the time. Her father, that old space
pirate, Martin Cain, discovered it
when he came here a generation ago.
If he hadn’t landed on this mountain,
he’d have met the same doom as every-
one else who has come here—his ship
and his body riddled by the terrific
radiation the moment he landed.”

  “But why in the devil’s name should
this metal mountain alone on the
whole planet remain non-radioac-
tive?” cried Gunner Welk, his massive
face incredulous. “It doesn’t make
sense.”

  “I think I understand that,” Sual Av
said keenly, his green eyes gleaming.
“I took a good look at the black metal
of this mountain as we climbed up
over it. It’s a solid mass of asterium.”

 “Asterium?” Thorn echoed. “That
queer element they’ve found in mete-
ors from outer spac#?”
^ w i

STARTLING STORIES

  Sual Av’s bald head bobbed eagerly.
“Yes, the element whose discovery
forced them to revise the periodic ta-
ble—the most inert element ever dis-
covered. It’s completely resistant to
radioactive action, they found.’*

  “But asterium was supposed to be
an element foreign to our solar sys-
tem, one formed somehow in far-off
giant stars!” cried Gunner. “How the
devil would there happen to be a solid
mountain of the stuff here on Ere-
bus?”

  “This mountain of asterium was not
always native to Erebus, if my guess is
right,” retorted the Venusian. “This
mountain came here from outer space.
It’s a gigantic meteorite of almost
solid asterium that fell here on Ere-
bus in some past age.”

  “By heaven, I believe Sual’s right!”
Gunner exclaimed excitedly. “That
would explain the peculiar domed
shape of the mountain. It's roughly
spherical, but half of it is buried.”
Old Stilicho Keene had listened,
only half-understanding. Now he
ventured an anxious question to
Thorn.

  “If it’s doom to step off this moun-
tain, as that there Saturnian says, then
how could Cheerly and his men and
Lana dare to leave here on foot to
search for'Jffi^ radite?”

  “If my guess is right, they had some
sort of protection against the radioac-
tive emanations out there,” Thorn
clipped. He turned to the Saturnian
officer. “What about it?”

  The green-faced captain nodded
nervously. “You’ve guessed it. We
were here two days, before Cheerly
figured out a way to protect them
when they left the mountain. He fig-
ured that since the asterium of this
mountain is proof against the radio-
active emanations out there, he would
melt some of the asterium and coat
their space-suits with it to make them
ray-proof. That’s what he did, and it
worked all right.”

HE first Planeteer looked grim.
“It’ll work for us, too, then!”
John Thorn declared. “We’ll proof
three space-suits for ourselves at once,
and go after Cheerly and Lana. We’ve

got to overtake them before they find
that radite—for Cheerly will do away
with Lana as soon as he has the stuff!”
“But, boy, can’t I go with you
Planeteers?” old Stilicho pleaded.

  "You’re needed to stay here and see
that these prisoners don’t break
loose,” Thom told him. “Take some
men back over to the Venture now,
and bring it over and park it beside
this cruiser. We’ve got to work rap-
idly to overtake Cheerly.”

  Soon the Venture had been brought
over the mountain, and settled down
beside the Cargol, the Saturnian
cruiser. The prisoners were locked in
a compartment of their own ship, and
a guard set over them.

  “You needn’t be afraid of us follow-
ing you out there,” the Saturnian cap-
tain told Thorn, with a shiver.
“There’s none of us would dream of
going out in those deadly deserts,
among God knows what kind of shin-
ing demons that roam there.”

  “Shining demons?” Sual Av asked
the green man. “What are you talk-
ing about?”

  “We’ve seen them, from atop the
mountain here,” the Saturnian an-
swered with a shudder. “Glowing, un-
earthly creatures of some kind far out
on the blue haze. I don’t know what
they are.”

  “You must have seen some dust-
whirls, that’s all,” Thorn clipped.
“Come on, Sual!”

  The Planeteers set to work with
urgent haste, helped by a party of
Stilicho’s men. They found the
atomic furnace whiqh Jenk Cheerly
had set up to melt some asterium was
still in place. They had it going in a
few minutes.

  Wearing their space-suits con-
stantly, the Planeteers and their help-
ers soon melted down a mass of the
solid asterium into liquid state. Then
three of their flexible metal space-
suits were dipped into the molten
black asterium.

  The glassite helmets, immune to all
heat and cold, were also coated with
the black element. Before it hardened
on the helmets, Thorn scraped two
spots thin, making them semi-trans-
parent for vision.
THE THREE PLANETEERS

87

  “It means dim vision, but I dare not
remove it completely from the eye
plates of the helmets," he muttered.
“Anything more would be dangerous,
in the hell of radiation that must rage
out there.”

  The asterium coating on the suits
and helmets hardened rapidly. When
it was cool, they took the ray-proofed
suits into the Venture, and put them
on in place of the ones they wore.

  “Hell, it’s as stiff as a suit of armor,”
muttered Gunner Welk, as he moved
in his new suit.

  “And these eyeholes can scarcely be
seen through,” complained Sual Av as
he donned the helmet.

  “Will you two stop chattering and
hurry?” John Thorn demanded vio-
lently.

  His two comrades stared at him.
And Thorn realized that he had
shouted at them.

  ‘’Sorry,” he said hoarsely, “but I’m
half-out of my head, thinking of Lana
out there with Cheerly.”

  “We understand,” Sual Av nodded.
“But we’ll find them, sure, before any-
thing happens to Lana. And we’re sure
of the radite now, if all goes well.”
“It isn’t only getting the radite
that’s on my mind,” Gunner said. His
face was deeply troubled, as he added
slowly, “Even if we get the radite
back safely to Earth to use in Philip
Blaine’s secret weapon, how do we
know that weapon will really save the
Alliance from the League attack?
What kind of weapon can hope to de-
feat ten thousand armed cruisers?”

JOHN THORN felt a chill of fore-
boding at the big Mercurian’s
words. Thorn, too, all this time, had
been haunted by the very possibility
that Gunner had put into words.

  “Suppose Blaine’s invention fails,
after all?” Gunner continued. “Sup-
pose it’s sound in theory, but imprac-
tical in fact. We don’t know a thing
about the nature of it, remember!”
“I’ve thought of that, too,” Sual Av
muttered worriedly. “Blaine has the
name of one of the greatest physicists
in the system—yet what could he in-
vent that would sweep ten thousand
cruisers out of space?”

  “Blaine must have something tre-
mendous,” Thorn insisted desperately.
“The Chairman has faith in his
weapon. We’ve got to have faith, too,
and get the radite that will operate
the thing. And we won't get it by de-
laying here!”

  The Planeteers emerged from the
Venture, wearing the black, asterium-
coated suits and helmets. Stilicho
Keene came hastily toward them,
holding to the collar of the space-dog
Ool. The beast reared up against
Thorn, its green eyes pleading.

  “Ool senses Lana somewhere on this
world,” Stilicho said. “Are you go-
ing to take him with you?”

  “We can't. His unprotected body,
non-organic though it is, would be af-
fected by the radiation out there,”
Thorn said. He grasped the space-
suited old Martian’s hand. “Keep a
close watch over the prisoners, Stili-
cho. We’ll come back with Lana and
the radite—or we won’t come back at
all.”

   "Good luck to ye,” Stilicho said.

  The Planeteers started down the
western curved slope of the huge
black meteorite-mountain. Soon they
reached the base of the mountain, and
stood for a moment, looking out
awedly across the uncanny world into
which they were to venture.

  Under the dark, starry sky stretched
the forbidding deserts of Erebus, dim
wastes whose every grain of sand
throbbed with a faint blue radiance
that gathered in drifting azure haze.
The shining blue mists swirled and
pulsated slowly, wrapping the whole
dusky landscape before them, veiling
the mountains westward.

  They knew that when they stepped
out on that glowing waste, into those
shining mists, they would be stepping
into a hell of radiation streaming
ceaselessly from the radioactive mass
of the planet—a torrent of alpha par-
ticles and of beta rays and of hard
gamma radiation as withering as super
X-rays.

  Determinedly, John Thorn strode
forward. The other two Planeteers
followed. Their feet sinking slightly
into the glowing sand, they trudged
westward,

 They felt no change. But when
Thorn tried to use his suit-audio, there
came from it only a shattering roar.
He linked hands with his comrades,
speaking to them by conduction of
sound.

  "The radiation kills our audios
completely,” he said. “It’s what dead-
ened all our instruments as we ap-
proached Erebus.”

UAL AV nodded his black-hel-
meted head vigorously. “The
gamma radiation alone from this mass
would do that.”

  “How in hell’s name does this whole
world come to be radioactive?” Gun-
ner muttered. “If it was thrown off
the sun in a tidal disturbance like the
other planets, it should consist of the
same kind of matter.”

  “I believe Erebus is the product of
an older and deeper disturbance than
that which produced the other plan-
ets,” Sual Av said keenly. “A dis-
turbance so deep that it hurled out a
mass of the heavier radioactive ele-
ments at the sun's heart, which formed
a huge radioactive core for this world
when it hardened.”

  “But there must have been some non-
radioactive elements here originally,
even so,” objected Gunner.

  "Yes. but they would inevitably be
made radioactive also by the radiation
from the core,” Sual Av replied. “You
know, the familiar phenomenon of in-
duced radioactivity, which was dis-
covered by the old Earth scientists
way back in the first third of the twen-
tieth century. The phenomenon by
which a sheet of aluminum or some
other normally non-radioactive ele-
ment will become itself radioactive if
subjected to radiation from radioac-
tive elements.”

  “That must be what has happened,”
Thorn agreed. “And any ship that
landed here would instantly also be-
come radioactive in every particle,
from the same cause.”

 They trudged on. Weird journey
across a blue-hazed planet beneath the
eternally nighted sky! On over the
desert, crunching the feebly glowing
sands beneath their feet, constantly
aware that the failure of the asterium

coating on their space-suits would
mean doom.

  Thom steered by the stars, for the
black metal mountain had dropped
from sight behind them. Infinitely
strange it seemed, on this outermost
world so far from the sun, to look up
into the dusky sky and see there the
familiar, glittering constellations!

 Then they glimpsed the western
mountains in the distance ahead, loom-
ing low, dark and barren-looking
through the drifting blue mists. The
Planeteers held toward those drear
peaks.

  “I see someone ahead!” exclaimed
Sual Av suddenly, stopping, "Some-
one coming toward us.”

  “It must be Cheerly coming back!”
cried Gunner, his hand darting to the
asterium-coated atom-pistol belted
outside his space-suit.

  Thom’s heart went cold with fear.
If Cheerly was coming back with the
radite, it meant Lana was already
dead.

  “No!” Sual Av cried, stupefied. “It’s
not Cheerly and his men—look, it’s
something shining!”

  “Good God, can there be any truth
in what those Saturnians told of hav-
ing seen shining demons out here?"
Thorn exclaimed hoarsely.

  For the two creatures moving to-
ward them through the blue mists
were unbelievable! They were man-
formed creatures, but they were glow-
ing with soft blue light!

  The two shining things came on,
straight toward the Planeteers. And
they stopped a few yards away from
the three comrades. They wore no
space-suits or protection of any kind.

  “God!” came Sual Av’s thick-voiced
exclamation. “They're men—shining
men—radioactive men!”

  Thorn’s brain reeled at the sight.
He felt as though he was looking at
some weird mirage born of the shining
mists.

  The two men before him were hu-
man in every respect. They wore the
tattered remnants of leather clothing
such as space-sailors had worn in the
past. One of them was tall, rangy of
body. The other was smaller, with
Martian features.

  But both of the two men were glow-
ing. Every atom of their bodies and
of their clothing shone with faint ra-
diance. These men were living hu-
man beings whose bodies had become
as radioactive in every particle as all
else on this world.

CHAPTER XVIII

Damned Souls of Erebus

THORN could not believe his eyes.
The sight of men, living men,
whose bodies were composed of radio-
active matter that glowed with its own
spontaneous energy, was brain-shat-
tering. He and his comrades stood
rigid, staring at the two glowing men.

  The radioactive men returned their
gaze with weirdly glowing eyes. Ancf)
now Thorn saw that in their shining
faces was a tragic, weary sadness and
deep despair. The radiant counte-
nance of the taller man, a strong, thin
face that seemed vaguely familiar to
Thorn, was a shining mask of haunt-
ing horror.

  “They’re men like ourselves—but
men made radioactive by the terrific
radiation here!” Sual Av exclaimed
hoarsely. “Induced radioactivity,
working somehow upon living be-
ings!”

  The Venusian’s words carried by vi-
bration of his helmet through the hazy
air to the two glowing men. For the
taller, the one whose face seemed
vaguely familiar, answered.

  “You are right,” he said slowly, in a
deep, strangely husked voice. “We
are men like yourselves, who came to
this hellish world in the past. And it
made us into what you see.”

  “How is it possible for you to live,
when your body has been changed into
radioactive matter?” Thorn asked
wildly. “It has never been dreamed
that there could be radioactive life!”
“Life,” said the tall glowing man
heavily, “is dependent upon energy.
Your bodies draw energy from their
chemical processes. But my body
needs now no chemical consumption
of air and food to give it energy, for

every atom of it now flames with the
energy which itself radiates. Noth-
ing can halt that spontaneous flow of
energy from the atoms of my body.
It will go on for ages until every atom
has completely lost its energy and has
been transmuted into elements lower
in the atomic scale. I cannot die, until
then.”

  A sound of bitter laughter tore from
his lips as his glowing eyes held the
three horror-stricken Planeteers.

  “I cannot die, do you hear? Though
I were to cut my own limbs off, though
I were to hack my body, it would still
live, for each atom of each fragment
would still emit ceaseless energy. My
brain—my consciousness—would still
remain living! And even if my brain
were cut to bits, each bit of it would
retain the flame of my life and con-
sciousness.”

■;n("Gftd1? . muttered Gunner Welk
thickly. “Then this is what has be-
fallen all the explorers of the past
who came here to Erebus!”

  The tall radioactive man nodded his
glowing head somberly.

  “Aye, it has befallen hundreds of
others who came here, as it did me. I
did not dream of the nature of this
devil world when I came here. How
could I? I thought the shining hazes
a mere phosphorescence. I landed my
ship—and at once my ship crumbled
as certain of its metallic elements
were swiftly disintergrated by the
radiation. And then the radiation
quickly changed my body—into this.

  “And I have dwelt here ever since,
as you see me now,- A travesty of life,
a mockery of a human being living on
and on, unable to die, unable even to
kill myself!”

  “How long?” Thorn asked hoarsely.
“How long have you two lived thus
on this world?”

AT this the tall radioactive man
pointed to his companion. “This
is Chan Gray, who came from Mars to
explore Erebus five centuries ago—,l
“Five centuries ago!” Thorn cried
dazedly. “You mean that he’s been
living here, in that horrible state, for
five hundred years?”

“The thing’s not possible I”
90

STARTLING STORIES

claimed Gunner Welk thickly.

  The taller radioactive man answered
heavily. "He has been living thus five
centuries, yes. I was here when he
came. For I have dwelt as you see me
now on Erebus for nine centuries. I
landed on this devil world in two
thousand and six.”

  "That can’t be!” objected John
Thorn. "Why, in two thousand and six
interplanetary travel was only a few
years old! The only men who had
made space-flights by that date were
Robert Roth himself, the first of them
all, and his lieutenant, Clymer
Nison—”

  Thorn’s voice broke off as he stared
in shaken horror and recognition into
the glowing face of the tall radio-
active man.

  “God above!” Thorn choked. “Your
face! I thought it was familiar from
pictures. You—Clymer—”

  “I am Clymer Nison, yes,” answered
the tall glowing man dully.

  A spell held the Planeteers, a trance
of stupefaction and awe, as they
stared at the man before them. A man
whose name had been famous in the
system’s history for nine hundred
years, whose name stood second only
to that of Robert Roth in the great
roll of the space-pioneers.

 "Clymer Nison!” said Gunner
hoarsely, unbelievingly. "The man
who helped Robert Roth build the
first space-ship of all, the man who
was first of all men to visit Uranus,
Neptune and Pluto, and who—”

  *—and who wanted to be the first
man to visit Erebus, also,” Nison fin-
ished heavily. “And who has remained
here ever since, in living death, the
most horrible of dooms.”

  The Planeteers could not speak.
They could only stare at the glowing
man in stricken awe.

  To them, as to all who sailed space,
this man ranked almost as a demigod.
He and the immortal Robert Roth had
statues in their honor on every in-
habited planet. And now they had
found him on this far mystery world,
not really living, yet not dead!

  “So long—so long ago it was that

I	came here,” Clymer Nison was say-
ing in his heavy voice, his shining

eyes staring tragically into the
haunted past. "So long, since I left
Earth on that fatal outward voyage
that brought me to this doom.

  “And yet there are times when all
the long centuries of living death here
seem but a moment, when it seems that
it was only yesterday that I sailed
with such high hopes. When it seems
only yesterday that I toiled with
Robert to build that first ship of his,
and watched him roar out into space
to glory.”

  “You say there are others like you
two on this world?” John Thom asked
unsteadily.

I^JTSON nodded heavily. “Aye,
1.^1 there are several hundred of us
radioactive men wearily roaming this
hellish world. All of them men who
have come here in past centuries, and
have been trapped, as I was trapped,
by the deadly radiation. You are the
first men I have ever seen come here
and escape the doom that seized us.”
“We landed on that black meteorite-
mountain of asterium,” Thorn told
him. “And we ray-proofed our suits
with the metal.”

  “Ask him about the radite, John,”
muttered Sual Av tensely.

  Jerkily, Thorn told the two glowing
men what had brought them to Ere-
bus. There was a brooding silence be-
fore Clymer Nison spoke.

  “And you say that this radite will
save the inner planets from dreadful
conquest, if you can take it back?” he
asked.

  "We hope it will,” Thorn answered
tensely. “If Blaine’s secret weapon is
effective—’’

  “I do not see,” said the glowing man
slowly, “what weapon or invention
could ever defeat such a fleet as you
say the outer planets have gathered.”
The old doubt and fear that Thorn
had felt increasingly as the days went
by, tautened his voice as he answered.

  “We don’t know either how Blaine
can hope to do that, what the nature
of his mysterious weapon is,” Thorn
admitted. “Yet, that secret of his is
the one last possible chance to prevent
the conquest of the Alliance.”

  He voiced a desperate appeal to Ni-
THE THREE PLANETEERS

son. “Earth is your native world, as
Mars is that of your companion. It’s
to prevent the wreck and ruin of those
two worlds, and of Venus and Mer-
cury too, that we're asking you to help
us find the radite.”

  “I will help you,” Clymer Nison said
slowly, his tragic radiant face heavy
with thought. “Though the Earth you
serve cannot be the Earth of nine cen-
turies ago from which I came, yet it
is still—Earth.”

  His glowing companion, the little
Martian, Chan Gray, slowly nodded
his head, and spoke to the Planeteers
for the first time.

  “Aye,” }ie said huskily. “And I re-
member the Mars of five centuries ago
—the pleasant desert cities, the sun
shining on the polar snows. I would
not want the hordes of the outer
planets to devastate that.”

  “You know where the radite lies?”
Thorn asked Nison eagerly.

  The glowing space-pioneer inclined
his head.

  He turned and pointed westward
through the swirling blue haze.

  “In the mountains yonder, a lump
of it lies. But it will be dangerous to
try to take it,” he explained. “The
terrific emanations that stream from
that mass of radite are more penetrat-
ing than any other. To the bodies of
us radioactive men who wearily wan-
der immortally over this planet, those
powerful emanations of the radite are
stimulating, as sunlight is to you.
There are always some of us radio-
active men gathered about that radite,
basking in the grateful radiation from
it.

  “And all these poor creatures like
myself will resist your taking the
radite. For to bask in its emanations
is almost the only pleasure they have
in this terrible mockery of existence.
Yet—with the safety of Earth and the
inner worlds at stake, I will help you
attempt to take the radite.”

  Nison turned heavily, and he and
his radiant companion looked back at
the Planeteers.

  After a moment, he spoke to them.
“Follow us,” Nison’s voice reached
them. “We will lead you to the
radite.”

THEY started on westward across
the shining desert, forging
through the luminous blue haze be-
neath the dark, star-studded sky. An
unearthly party—the three Planeteers
in their grotesque black ray-proof
space-suits, led by the two glowing
radioactive men.

  “It’s like a nightmare,” Gunner’s
voice reached Thorn, the Mercurian
gripping his arm as they trudged
along. “This hellish world, haunted
by these pitiful ghosts of men.”

  “No wonder Martin Cain wouldn’t
tell anyone about what he’d seen here,
when he got back,” muttered Sual Av.

  They forged on for hours, ever west
across the dim desert. The Planeteers
followed closely behind their glowing
guides, but the three comrades were
beginning to tire from the weight of
their asterium-coated space-suits,
while the two radioactive men showed
no sign of fatigue.

  “Damn the gravitation of this
world!” Gunner gritted. “It’s as
strong as Earth’s, and it shouldn’t be
half that strong on a little planet like
this.”

  “The huge radioactive core of this
world gives it its unusual mass,” Sual
Av declared. “And the radiation from
it is responsible for the warmth that
permits a gaseous atmosphere here.”

  Thorn’s heart quickened as he saw
beyond their radiant guides, a low,
barren dark range of mountains loom-
ing up through the haze.

  “We’re getting there!” Thorn cried
eagerly.

  Clymer Nison and his radioactive
Martian comrade led them on through
a pass between two peaks. The moun-
tains towered a few thousand feet on
either side, somber, bare rock slopes
faintly luminous with the emanations
throbbing from their radioactive
atoms.

  On into the tumbled peaks, through
valleys thick with the shining blue
haze, over long ridges, Nison led the
way. For the space-pioneer who had
wandered this dreary world for nine
long centuries seemed to know each
square yard of its surface.

  They entered a deep chasm, a
gloomy gorge with precipitous shin-
92

STARTLING STORIES

ing walls and a floor strewn with fallen
masses of radiant rock. Along this the
two radioactive men led the way. The
shimmering sand of the chasm floor
was deeply marked by a path, that had
been trodden by many men coming
and going in past times.

  To the Planeteers, this gorge was an
awesome and uncanny place. The
great shining boulders through which
the path wound, the feebly radiant
cliffs that towered on either side, the
strip of starry black sky far overhead,
all combined to depress the spirit by
their alien, forbidding atmosphere.

  Through the blue, shimmering hazes
that floated thick in this chasm, Cly-
mer Nison and his companion led the
way. At last Nison turned.

  “The radite lies in a niche in the
side of the cliff, just ahead,” he said
heavily to the Planeteers. ‘‘We must
be careful now, for there are almost
sure to be some of my poor fellow-
sufferers near it, bathing in its rays.”
“I hope not,” Gunner Welk mut-
tered. “If these radioactive men can’t
be killed, they’d be tough customers.”
They moved on, Nison and the
glowing Martian leading, going more
slowly and cautiously now.

AS they rounded a turn in the
crooked chasm, they saw ahead a
place where the sand had been beaten
down by many feet, over a long time.
There was a small natural niche in the
chasm wall there—but there was no
radite in it.

  “The radite's gone!” cried Clymer
Nison in amazement, staring unbeliev-
ingly at the empty niche in the rock.

  “Gone?” exclaimed John Thorn.
His heart sank with despair. “Then
Cheerly has been here ahead of us.
He’s taken the radite, and—”

  “Listen!” Sual Av cried, turning his
helmeted head sharply. “Hear that?”
They heard, then. A dim uproar of
raging voices from farther along the
chasm, punctuated every few moments
by the rumbling thunder and crash of
great rocks falling.

  “What can it be,” Nison wondered,
his radiant face perplexed.

  “I have an idea what it is!” Thorn
cried. “Come on!”

  They pressed on along the gloomy
gorge. In a few minutes they had
rounded another turn in it, and
stopped short, petrified by the as-
tounding scene ahead.

  A few hundred feet ahead in the
chasm was gathered a mob of dozens
of glowing men. Radioactive men like
Nison and the Martian, garbed in
ragged remnants of clothing that
showed they were of every time in the
last nine centuries, of every world.
Glowing men who had come to Ere-
bus in past centuries and had been
trapped here, transmitted into radio-
active beings!

  This crowd of glowing men was
wildly seeking to storm a narrow
ledge that jutted from the chasm wall
a dozen feet up from the floor. With
shrill, raging cries, the radioactive
mob would scramble up to win the
ledge, but would be repelled by the
rocks rolled down upon them by the
defenders.

  The defenders of the ledge were
three men clad in asterium-coated
space-suits like those of the Plane-
teers. Behind them was another figure
in a coated space-suit, but with arms
bound together. And also on the ledge
was a rude sledge of black asterium,
upon which was tied a small mass of
something that had been carefully
wrapped in thick sheets of asterium.

  “It's Cheerly and his men, and the
bound figure is Lana!” Thorn ex-
claimed hoarsely. “And that mass on
the sledge—”

  “Must be the radite!” Gunner Welk
cried. “Cheerly got the stuff from the
niche, but the radioactive men caught
him taking it!”

CHAPTER XIX

Cheerly’s Cunning

THE scene was one out of night-
mare. The gloomy chasm of shim-
mering blue haze, the shining cliff
upon a ledge of which the three space-
suited men desperately defended
themselves, and the insanely shouting,
raging mob of weirdly glowing radio-
THE THREE PLANETEERS

93

active men who attacked them.

  John Thorn, his heart hammering at
having come within actual sight of
both Lana Cain and the precious ra-
dite. leaped forward. But the up-
raised warning hand of Clymer Nison
stopped him.

  "No!” said the glowing man. “That
raging crowd of doomed ones would
tear you to pieces if you tried to make
your way through them. For very
many of my fellow-sufferers on this
world are crazed, made mad by our
horrible existence.”

  ‘‘We’ve got to get Lana and the ra-
dite out of there quickly!” Thorn
cried. “Cheerly and his men can’t
hold that mob off much longer!”
Cheerly and his two men were plain-
ly being hard pressed. Only by snatch-
ing up shining rocks that lay strewn
on the narrow ledge, and dashing them
down at their attackers, could they
keep the radioactive men from win-
ning up to them.

  "They’ll run out of rocks soon and
that’ll be the end of them!” Sual Av
exclaimed.

  "Why the devil don’t they use their
atom-pistols?” Gunner demanded.

  “They would be useless against such
men as myself,” Clymer Nison de-
clared sadly. “I know a way to get
onto that ledge farther back along the
chasm. Follow me!”

  The Planeteers raced back along the
chasm after Nison and his companion.
The glowing men swerved and started
climbing up a narrow crack in the
shimmering cliff.

  Thorn and his comrades struggled
to follow. By tremendous effort, they
hoisted their heavy figures up after
the two glowing men. They found
themselves on a precariously narrow
shelf of the rock wall.

  Nison and the glowing Martian led
the way now back along the chasm to
the battle, following this narrow shelf.
There were places where it was hard-
ly a yard wide. But in a few minutes,
they had followed it to a point where
it connected with the ledge upon
which Cheerly and his men were de-
fending themselves.

  Cheerly turned, appalled, as the
Planeteers and their two glowing

guides appeared. The Uranian, un-
recognizable in his shapeless space-
suit and coated helmet, made himself
known by the cry that vibrated from
him as he saw them.

  “Have you come from the ship to
help?” Cheerly cried, not recognizing
the Planeteers. “How did you get
here with those two glowing devils?”

 “We came after you, Cheerly!"
Thorn cried throbbingly. The Ura-
nian shrank back as he heard Thorn’s
voice.

  “The Planeteers!” he exclaimed
wildly.

  Lana stumbled forward, unrecog-
nizable in her ray-proofed suit, but
her silver voice wildly glad from in-
side it.

  "John! John Thorn!” she cried. "I
knew you would follow somehow.”

  Thorn, gripping her tightly for a
moment, saw beyond her the little as-
terium sledge, and the mass upon it
which was wrapped in the sheets of
asterium Cheerly had prepared and
brought. That mass was no more than
four feet in diameter each way, and a
corner of it that protruded through
the hastily wrapped sheets showed
that it was a huge chunk of dense mat-
ter blazing with intolerable white
brilliance.

HERE was the radite, at last! The
isotope that was the rarest ele-
ment in existence, the block of blaz-
ing matter that contained locked with-
in it incalculable power that might
sway the future of the whole system!

  “I knew you would escape from Sa-
turn and come after us,” Lana was
sobbing wildly. “But I feared—”

  "John, here they come!” Gunner
Welk yelled wildly.

  The radioactive mob below were
scrambling up to the attack again.
And this time, as though enraged by
the appearance of the newcomers with
two of their own glowing kind, the
maddened mob of radiant men came
with ferocious determination.

  There was no time for Thorn to deal
Cheerly the fate he deserved, no time
for anything. The first of the glowing
men was already scrambling onto the
ledge!
94

STARTLING STORIES

  Gunner fired his atom-pistol at them
viciously. But the flare of blinding
energy did not harm the glowing men.
The emanations from their radioactive
bodies simply repelled that energy.

  “Use rocks!” Thorn yelled, stoop-
ing and picking up a chunk of shim-
mering stone and hurling it.

  It knocked one of the glowing men
off the ledge. But others were scram-
bling onto it. It became a wild battle
to hold the ledge against them.

  Clymer Nison and Chan Gray, the
glowing Martian, fought by the side
of the Planeteers and Cheerly’s men.
They seized glowing attackers and
hurled them down. But still others
gained the ledge, and it became a crazy
hand-to-hand melee.

  Thorn, struggling in the insane grip
of one of the glowing men, saw others
tear the helmet off one of Cheerly’s
followers. As the terrific radiation
omnipresent on this planet struck the
luckless Saturnian’s unprotected face,
he screamed like a hurt animal. And
almost instantly, his face and body be-
gan to glow with that ghastly blue
emanation.

  The Planeteers fought with their
metal-clad fists. Gunner Welk's great
arms swept a clear circle around him,
the big Mercurian roaring. Sual Av
pulled off a glowing attacker who had
leaped on Thorn’s back and was try-
ing to wrench away his helmet.

  For minutes the crazy struggle went
on. A fight with maddened lost souls
on a planet of the damned! But with
Nison and the Martian helping, the
Planeteers forced the radiant men
back off the ledge. They gathered
below, howling with fury.

  Thorn turned quickly. Lana was
stumbling to her feet from the back
of the ledge.

  “John, Cheerly’s gone!” she cried.
“While you were fighting, he and his
remaining man slipped away along the
ledge with the sledge of radite! They
6truck me down—”

  Thorn whirled, wild with rage and
apprehension. The cunning Uranian,
seizing the opportunity when the
Planeteers were engaged in the wild
melee, had with his remaining follow-
er stolen away with the radite. They

could be seen now in the distance,
hurrying along the shelf by which the
Planeteers had come to the ledge.

  “After them!” Thorn cried.

  They rushed back along the shelf,
Nison and Chan Gray following join-
ing in pursuit of the two fugitives.
Rapidly they gained on the two fugi-
tives who were encumbered with the
sledge.

  They saw Cheerly and his follower
round a narrow place in the shelf
ahead. As they rushed after them,
atomic shells burst ahead and a mass
of the shimmering cliff was dislodged
by the flare of energy and fell in an
avalanche across the shelf. It blocked
the narrow way completely, halting
the Planeteers.

HEERLY used their pistols to
cause that rock-fall!” Sual Av
cried furiously.

  “Down to the floor of the chasm!
We’ll follow that way, and beat them
back to the ship!” Thorn shouted.

  “We can’t!” the Venusian cried.
“Look, that mob has followed us!”

  The maddened crowd of radioactive
men below, seeing the Planeteers’
party moving away along the narrow
ledge, had followed along the floor of
the chasm. They were gathered now
below, preparing to climb up in furi-
ous attack once more.

 “We’re trapped!" Gunner Welk
yelled. “We can’t go further along
the ledge and we can’t go down
through that crazy mob!”

  Already the crazed radioactive men
were climbing up to the ledge. Lana
uttered a hopeless cry.

  Thorn swept her behind him, and he
and his comrades and their two glow-
ing friends sprang to repel the assault
of the shining horde. With rocks,
with their fists, with their clubbed
atom-pistols, they beat back their in-
sensate attackers.

  But again and again the radioactive
men came up at them. Time was drag-
ging past. Thorn felt as though he
were struggling in an endless night-
mare of horror and despair.

  The radioactive attackers had limbs
broken, bodies crushed in many places
—yet still they came on. The flame of
THE THREE PLANETEERS

strange energy and life that throbbed
in every atom of their bodies could
not be extinguished or dimmed by any
bodily harm.

  As the glowing men below gathered
for another charge up the rock wall,
Clymer Nison spoke to the exhausted,
staggering Planeteers.

  “I may be able to turn them,” said
the space-pioneer. “It is a chance to
stop Cheerly.”

  Thom saw Nison step to the edge
of the ledge and speak to the radio-
active horde gathering again below.

  “There is no use in attacking us any
longer!” Nison cried to them. “We
do not have the radite. Those who
took it from the niche have fled with
it, and are escaping!”

  A chorus of insanely raging yells
answered him, as the half-crazy horde
started forward to climb again to the
attack. But a huge Jovian among the
glowing horde held back his compan-
ions.

  “Clymer Nison speaks truth!” he
shouted. “See, the radite is gone from
the ledge and so are some of the men.
We must scatter and search for the
thieves!"

  “Scatter and search!” went up the
husky, furious shout from the radio-
active mob.

  They began to split up, starting
along the chasm in both directions,
searching carefully for Cheerly and
the radite.

 “By heaven, Nison, your idea
worked!” panted John Thorn. “Quick,
now—we’ve got to get back to the
meteorite-mountain. That’s where
Cheerly will have headed with the
radite.”

  “There’s nothing for us to fear,
since Stilicho and his men hold Cheer-
ly’s ship and crew prisoner,” Sual Av
gasped.

  “Cheerly must know something has
happened to his ship,” Thorn retorted.
“That Uranian is a devil for clever-
ness.”

  Thorn helped Lana as they scram-
bled down the rock wall, to the floor
of the chasm.

  And as they started at a trot back
eastward, he half-supported, half-car-
ried the staggering girl.

•'■'HEIR two radioactive allies,
•M. Nison and the Martian, led the
way out of the barren mountains.
They saw none of the glowing horde,
which had split in all directions to
search furiously for the takers of the
radite.

  Lana, suffering from exhaustion and
nervous reaction, could hardly walk.
Yet she trudged valiantly with the
last of her strength as they hastened
over the dim desert.

  “John, if we get the radite away
from Cheerly now, will it be in time
to save the Alliance?” she panted.

 “Yes. Haskell Trask will not
launch his attack until he hears from
Cheerly that the radite has been se-
cured,” Thorn told her. “If we get
the stuff back to Earth’s moon, and if
Philip Blaine’s weapon really
works—”

  He stopped, that goading doubt tor-
turing his mind, that chilling, un-
voiced fear that Blaine’s mysterious
invention might prove a failure.

  The huge black mass of the domed
meteorite-mountain loomed slowly out
of the shimmering blue mists, bulking
darkly against the starry sky. They
pressed toward its base, and were
starting to climb up its rough asterf-
um side, when a sound reached their
ears. The roar of a ship’s rocket-
tubes!

  “Look!” Sual Av yelled frantically,
pointing upward. “The Gargol.”

  The Saturnian cruiser was blasting
off, rising from where it had been
parked beside the Venture, with a re-
verberating roar of tubes. It shot up
at dizzying speed, and disappeared in
the dark sky.

  “God, Cheerly has got away in it,
somehow,” Gunner cried hoarsely.

  They scrambled frantically on up
the mountain, driven by overmaster-
ing fear. When they came to where
the Venture lay, they stopped, aghast.

  A fight had taken place here. A
half-dozen space-suited pirates lay in
a scorched, dead heap. Other men in
space-suits were running out from the
Venture.

  Out of that little crowd sprang a
gray beast with blazing green eyes,
that limped on a scorched leg as it
96

STARTLING STORIES

bounded frantically toward Lana and
nuzzled against her. After the space-
dog came Stilicho Keene, his wrin-
kled face recognizable through his
glassite helmet.

  “You brought the lass back!” he
cried, joy lighting his faded eyes.
Then as his gaze fell on the glowing
forms of Clymer Nison and Chan
Gray, he gasped, “But who—”

 “What happened here? Who was
in the Gargol when it took off?” Thorn
cried fiercely.

  “Cheerly—and that there radite!”
groaned the old pirate. "He fooled us,
neat. He and his man came up here
a half-hour ago, dragging the radite on
their sledge. They were wearing suits
like yours, ray-proofed and with even
the helmets coated, so we couldn’t see
their faces plain enough. And
Cheerly imitated your voice so that I
thought he was you, John Thorn!

  “He said that he and Sual Av had
brought the radite back, and that Gun-
ner was following with Lana. We
never suspected him, he imitated your
voice so well, and we couldn’t even
recognize his fat figure in that shape-
less suit. He took the radite into the
Gargol, saying we’d use the Saturnian
ship to return to Earth in. He even
went into the Venture for a few min-
utes—I suppose to see if you’d any
papers or secrets worth stealing.”

E fell silent.

  “Go on, man!” Thorn cried.
“How did he get away with the Gar-
gol, when you had its crew under
guard?”

  “He did it easy,” groaned the old
man. “He and his man, posing as you
and Sual Av, went into the Gargol.
We didn't follow, never suspecting.
And Cheerly and his man blasted
down our guards in there, set free his
Saturnian crew, and took off, with a
blast of their guns that killed six of
our men!”

  “And now he’s on his way back to
Saturn with the radite!” Gunner
cried. ‘‘We’ve got to catch him!"

  “We’ll catch him—the Venture can
overhaul him!” Thorn cried. “Into
the ship, all of you! We’re blasting
off!”

  They tumbled into the Venture,
leaving the two radioactive men stand-
ing staring. Inside the craft, its doors
closed, the Planeteers and Lana and
Stilicho climbed to the control-room.
The old pirate yelled urgently into the
interphone.

  “Power chambers on!” he ordered.

  They heard the clash of the injec-
tors below, and then the rising roar
of the power-chambers.

  A terrific explosion shook the ship
next moment. They were all thrown
from their feet, and heard cries of pain
and terror from below.

  “Good God, something’s let go!”
Gunner yelled.

  Thorn led as they hastily climbed
down to the stern compartment that
housed the four big power-chambers.

  The compartment was a wreck. The
power-chambers had exploded with
frightful force, killing three pirate
engineers.

  “That damned Cheerly mu6t have
done this when he came into the Ven-
turer a wounded, staggering engi-
neer gasped. “The power-chamber
safety was jammed — deliberately
jammed!”

  "Cheerly’s won again, curse him!”
Gunner yelled wildly. “It’ll take us
days to rebuild these power-chambers,
if we can do it at all. And by that time
he’ll be half-way back to Saturn!”

      CHAPTER XX
      At Uranus’ Orbit

THE cruel stars above Erebus
looked down upon a scene of
strange activity. Out of the dimly
shining deserts of that terrible world,
out of the shimmering blue hazes that
perpetually wrapped its surface, rose
the huge black bulk of a rounded
metal mountain. And on the top of
that mountain, space-suited men who
staggered from days of frantic labor
were now nearing the end of their
toil.

  The Venture was being made ready
for blast-off. New power-chambers
had been built into the ship in the
THE THREE PLANETEERS

97

days that had passed. Lacking iner-
trum with which to build the new
chambers, John Thorn had used the
metal of the mountain, the black as-
terium which was fully as strong as
inertrum itself. With atomic furnaces
and atomic welding-torches, the Plane-
teers and Stilicho’s pirates had labored
almost unceasingly to construct the
new chambers. Lana Cain’s order had
been enough to make the pirates obey
Thorn utterly.

  Thorn had been torn with almost
unbearable apprehension in these days
of terrible toil. Each day, each hour,
meant that Jenk Cheerly was millions
of miles farther toward Saturn with
the radite. No one of them all, except
Thorn himself, believed there was the
slightest chance to overtake the spy-
master now.

  Gunner Welk and Sual Av, reeling
with fatigue, stumbled up to where
Thorn was superintending the last
preparations.

  “All ready, as far as I can see,” Gun-
ner said hoarsely.

  Stilicho Keene and Lana came up
anxiously as he spoke.

  “Boy, are ye crazy to think that you
can overtake the Gargol when it’s got
days’ start of us?” quavered Stilicho.

  “Weil overtake them,” Thorn said
fiercely. “We’ve got to!”

  “But to do it, we’d have to travel
three times as fast as any space-ship
ever traveled before!” Stilicho ex-
claimed.

  “That’s what we’re going to do!”
Thorn clipped.

  They stared at him, as though they
believed his mind had been strained
by the days of superhuman toil and
anxiety.

  “We’re going to use radioactive
matter for fuel in our power-cham-
bers!” Thorn explained. “It will
yield several times as much power as
ordinary metallic fuel. We can get
up to a speed no ship has ever attained
before!”

  “But no one's ever dared use radio-
active fuel before,” Lana whispered
stunnedly. “It would crumble any
power-chamber it was used in.”

  “You forget we’ve got asterium
power-chambers in the Venture now!”

Thom cried. “And asterium is proof
against radioactivity.”

  The daring originality of Thom’s
plan burst upon the others, taking
their breath away.

  “By heaven, it may work!” Gunner
exclaimed excitedly. “If the power
doesn’t make our rocket-tubes back-
blast.”

  “We’ll have to take that chance,”
John Thom said harshly. He turned.
“Here come Clymer Nison and Chan
Gray now. They volunteered to bring
the radioactive fuel we’ll need.”

  The two glowing figures of the ra-
dioactive men were coming up onto
the top of the metal mountain, drag-
ging after them the asterium sledge.
Upon the sledge, in a rudely forged
asterium box, was a great mass of shin-
ing mineral.

  Thorn’s quick orders superintended
the pirate engineers as they carried the
asterium box of minerals into the
Venture, and prepared it for use.
Then Thorn turned to the two radiant
radioactive men.

  “We’re ready to start,” he told Cly-
mer Nison haggardly. "We want you
to come back with us, to Earth.”

I^TTSON shook his shining head
sadly. “That cannot be. We
would be death to you. The radia-
tion from our bodies would slay you,
in time, and would disintegrate your
ship.”

  “But you can’t stay here, wandering
this hellish world forever!” Thorn
cried. “You, one of the greatest of
men in the system’s history, you whom
Earth would welcome with joy.”

  Clymer Nison’s haunted, shining
eyes looked past them, far away into
tragic memory.

  “To Earth I am dead, now,” he said
slowly. “And the Earth I knew nine
centuries ago, is dead, too. It must
remain that way. But one thing you
can do for us.”

  “Anything you name!” Thorn ex-
claimed.

  “You can give us poor damned souls
upon this world, us radioactive men,
the boon of real death,” Nison said.
“If scientists of Earth came here with
the needed mechanisms, they could
STARTLING STORIES

end the flame of unhuman life within
us by using forces to transmute the
radioactive atoms of our bodies into
pure energy, dissipating our atomic
structure, our life and consciousness,
forever. That is the greatest gift you
could give us—the peace of death."

  Thorn felt a hard lump in his throat.
It was moments before he could an-
swer.

  "It shall be done,” he choked. “A
party of scientists will be sent here to
do what you ask.”

  He turned toward the awe-stricken
group behind him who were staring
in deep,silence at the tragic, glowing
men.

  “We must start,” Thorn said un-
steadily. “Into the ship!”

  Inside the Venture, the Planeteers
climbed again with Lana and Stilicho
to the control-room, while the door
was ground shut. They removed their
space-suits, and then Stilicho nerv-
ously gave the order into the inter-
phone.

  “Power-chambers on!”

  All stiffened, as from below came
the soft, rising roar of the chambers,
growing rapidly to a thunderous
throbbing that shook the whole fabric
of the cruiser. The radioactive fuel,
being broken down in the power-
chambers, was yielding such unprec-
edented torrents of energy as to
threaten a new explosion.

  “Blast off!” Thorn told the old
pirate.

  Stilicho’s thin hands descended on
the firing-keys. With a raving roar of
released titanic energy, a spuming
plume of fire from their rocket-tubes,
the Venture shot skyward.

  Up from the domed metal mountain,
up from the shimmering blue hazes of
Erebus, the cruiser arrowed, picking
up speed with appalling acceleration.
Air screamed briefly outside, then
faded away.

  Night-black space, starred with the
bright yellow speck of the far-distant
sun, lay ahead. Rocketing faster and
faster, shuddering and creaking to the
thrust of its tubes, the Venture flashed
on.

  Sual Av was hanging tensely over
the instrument panel, and the Venus-

ian’s green eyes flashed as he turned.

  “Instruments are operating again!"
he reported. “But our audio was per-
manently wrecked by the radiation of
Erebus.”

  “Lay a course straight for Saturn,”
Thorn ordered Stilicho. “Cheerly will
be making straight for that world, and
we’ll be following him directly.”

UNNER WELK grunted.

  “And if we catch up to him,”
he gritted, “I’ve got plans for what I'll
do to that Uranian.”

  “Shall I cut some of the tubes
now?" the old pirate asked nervously.
“We’re shaking now like we're fit to
come apart."

  “No! Leave all stern tubes on for
utmost acceleration!” Thorn rapped,
his haggard, worn, brown face stiff
with desperate determination. “We’ll
either wrcck this ship by back-blast-
ing, or we’ll overtake Cheerly—one of
the two!”

  Lana came silently to Thorn’s side,
looked up at him with a deep anxiety
in her blue eyes.

  “John, you must sleep a little,” she
begged. “For days you’ve been toiling
and worrying. You’ll collapse unless
you rest.”

  “Rest? How can I rest when the
radite we’ve come through hell to get
is millions of miles ahead of us!”
Thorn said rawly.

 As the next hours passed, the
rocket-tubes of the Venture continued
to roar unceasingly, the ship quiver-
ing and creaking sickeningly. Their
speed was mounting to tremendous
heights—already they were traveling
faster than the fastest ship in the sys-
tem’s history.

  And still the stern tubes roared, the
Venture’s velocity accelerated. Ere-
bus faded to a dim speck behind them,
vanished. The sun-star was brighter
and bigger ahead, and the yellow
spark of Saturn was largening dead
ahead.

  Time passed, slow, tense hours that
dragged into a full day, and then an-
other. The exhausted Planeteers and
pirates took turns sleeping and watch-
ing. They could not know how fast
they were traveling now—the instru-
THE THREE PLANETEERS

99

ments were not calibrated for such
tremendous velocity—but knew their
speed must be an appalling one.

  They neared the orbit of Uranus,
and by now Saturn presented a per-
ceptible disk ahead. Thorn haggardly
watched the little glowing sphere of
the aura-chart.

  “Cheerly’s ship can’t be far ahead
of us now,” he estimated. “The high-
est speed the Gargol could attain
would bring it about this far by now.”

  Lana stood with her gold head by
his shoulder, watching as tensely as
he.

  “There, John!” she cried in a mo-
ment, pointing.

  In the fore of the aura-chart a red
speck had appeared, a ship a million
miles ahead of the Venture.

  “That’s the Gargol—it must be!”
Thorn cried. “Cut the stern tubes,
Gunner!”

  Gunner Welk, standing turn at the
firing-keys, obeyed instantly. But the
aura-chart showed they were still
rushing after their quarry with such
speed that they would flash past it.
Thorn ordered the bow-tubes fired for
the purpose of slowing them down.

AS the ship rocked and quivered to
the blasting brake-thrust of the
tubes. Sual Av came up into the con-
trol-room, sleepily rubbing his eyes.
Old Stilicho’s anxious face was be-
hind him.

  “We’ll come up to Cheerly soon,”
Thorn rapped. “That means a fight.
He'll never give up that radite will-
ingly.”

  “The Gargol has heavier batteries
than we do, and a bigger crew,” re-
minded Stilicho Keene.

  “But we can outmaneuver them!”
Lana said. She cried into the inter-
phone to the pirate crew, “On suits
and prepare for action, men!”

  “Go down and take command of our
batteries. Gunner,” Thorn ordered.
“I’ll take the controls. Suits on, every-
one V

  In a few moments Thorn, in his
space-suit now like the others, was
poised over the firing-keys. Sual Av
tautly watched the aura-chart, while
Lana and old Stilicho peered ahead.

  “We’re close,” muttered the Venus-
ian, his eyes on the chart.

  “There’s the Gargol!” Lana cried
suddenly, pointing ahead through the
glassite window. “And they’ve spotted
us!”

  Thorn saw the Saturnian cruiser in
the black, starry vault ahead—a long
torpedolike shape pluming white fire
from its rocket-tubes as it put on all
possible speed to escape. Jenk Cheerly
obviously had no desire to risk battle.

  But the Venture, imbued with its
unprecedented potential speed, swift-
ly came up on the tail of the naval
cruiser. Now atom-shells began to
burst in blinding flares near Thorn’s
ship as the Gargol cut loose with its
stern guns.

  “I’m going to run up under their
keel!” Thorn called into the inter-
phone. “Try to score a hit on their
stern tubes, Gunner!”

  The Gargol veered around suddenly
ahead, to bring its broadside batteries
into play. The heavily-gunned cruiser
loosed a brief hail of shells in the di-
rection of the Venture.

  But the pirate ship shot clear like
lightning as Thorn smashed down a
key. Swiftly, it veered after the Sa-
turnian ship, seeking to run beneath
its keel.

  The Gargol rolled, to keep present-
ing its guns toward its enemy. For a
brief moment the two ships rushed
side by side through space, their
rocket-tubes flaming and their guns
pouring shell at each other.

  Whizzing white flares of energy
burst around the Venture, and it
rocked wildly as it was hit. Red lights
flashed on in the panel before Thorn,
warning that two keel compartments
had been holed.

  But Gunner’s pirates were not idle.
They were concentrating all their fire
upon the Gargol's stern, hoping to
wreck its tubes and completely disable
the cruiser. The Saturnian ship vol-
leyed upward through space in a sharp
veering turn to escape that fire.

  “We didn’t get ’em!” Stilicho mut-
tered. “But they’ll get us if we come
to close quarters again. Their guns
and inertrum armor are too heavy for
us!”
100

STARTLING STORIES

  “We’re closing in again!’’ Thorn ex-
claimed, his black eyes blazing now.
He called down to Gunner, “Stand
ready! And get those stern-tubes!”

LIKE two fighting hawks of space,
locked in a death combat out here
in the lonely immensity of starry
space, the two ships maneuvered.
Then again, using his superior speed,
Thorn drove the Venture in close
against the Saturnian ship.

  Guns of the Gargol vomited shell
that blinded Thorn as they broke
around the Venture. He clung with
wild recklessness to the side of the
enemy, as Gunner's batteries let go.

  “They’re hit!" Lana cried, her blue
eyes blazing with electric excitement.

  The Gargol’s clustered stern rocket-
tubes had been struck by a salvo of
atom-shells that had blasted the tubes
into a fused, horribly twisted mass
of inertrum.

  They saw the Saturnian cruiser rock
wildly as the fused rocket-tubes back-
blasted. An instant later, they saw a
vastly greater explosion rip out the
whole stern wall of the Gargol, blow-
ing mangled men and twisted metal
into space.

  “Their tubes back-blasted into the
power-chambers, and the chambers
themselves let go I" cried Sual Av,
momentarily aghast. “It must have
killed almost everyone aboard!"

  “We’re going aboard the wreck I"
John Thorn exclaimed. “Take over,
Stilicho, and run us alongside.’’

  The old pirate brought the Venture
quickly alongside the silent, drifting
wreck. Magnetic grapples hooked on,
and then the Planeteers and Lana and
a dozen pirates donned space-suits
and clambered through the great hole
that had been torn in the stern of the
Saturnian ship.

  The interior of the Gargol was a
scene of utter devastation. The ter-
rific violence of the explosion had
bent solid inertrum like tin, had slain
most of the crew outright. A few
space-suited Saturnians who had sur-
vived dazedly raised their hands in
token of surrender.

  "The radite? Where is it?” Thorn
demanded fiercely of them.

  “In the lower bow-compartment,”
answered the stunned, shaking men.

  The Planeteers pushed through the
wreck toward that compartment. They
burst into it, and Thorn sprang for-
ward with a cry.

  The asterium-wrapped mass of
radite was in this metal chamber. But
toward the precious element was
crawling Jenk Cheerly, his body bad-
ly crushed inside his space-suit, but
with a heavy atom-gun in his hand.
The Uranian, fatally injured by the
explosion, was making a dying at-
tempt to destroy the radite.

  Thorn tore the gun from his hand.
Cheerly looked up, his face livid gray-
green inside his glassite helmet, his
small eyes glistening with undying
hatred.

  “You’ve—not won, Planeteers!” he
choked. “You’re too late. I notified
the Leader days ago by audio that I
had the radite, and the League fleet
rocketed then to conquer the Alliance!
Already they’re driving the Alliance
navies sunward!

  “And what is more,” he gloated in
a dying whisper, “Haskell Trask him-
self and a picked strong force have
landed on Earth’s moon and seized
Philip Blaine and his weapon! The
radite is useless to you now!”

A LAST flicker of life throbbed in
Cheerly’s little eyes, a last gleam
of triumph.

  “I was—always too clever for you
—Planeteers!” he choked. And then
his broken body relaxed as death
came.

  Thorn looked up at the others, his
brown face grave inside his helmet.
“If what he said is true—”

  “I’ll find out with the Gargol's
audio!” Sual Av cried, and sprang to-
ward the control-room.

  When the Venusian came back, his
face was pale, his green eyes stricken.
He spoke unsteadily.

  “It’s true, John! I heard the audio-
calls. The Alliance navies have re-
treated sunward past the orbit of
Venus, attacked by the League's tre-
mendous fleet. The inner worlds are
in wild panic, and Haskell Trask is
directing the League operations from
THE THREE PLANETEERS

101

the advanced base he's established on
Earth's moon!”

  Thorn’s body sagged inside his
space-suit For the first time, ultimate
despair claimed him.

  “Then this radite that might have
saved the Alliar.ce is useless,” he said
hoarsely. “With Trask holding the
moon—Blcine’s weapon in his posses-
sion—the Alliance is doomed!”

CHAPTER XXI
The Fight on the Moon

LANA CAIN gripped Thorn’s arm.
The pirate girl’s blue eyes blazed
with compelling force into his.

  “No, John!” she exclaimed. “There’s
still a chance. We can attack Trask’s
force on the moon and recapture
Blaine’s weapon. We can give Blaine
a chance to operate it!”

 “Recapture the moon?” Thorn
echoed deadly. He laughed bitterly.
"With the few dozen of us, with this
one ship, against the strong force Has-
kell Trask has there?”

  "We can get a force strong enough
to take the moon!” Lana cried.

  “Where?" he asked dully. “Every
ship of the Alliance navies is inside
Venus’ orbit, retreating from the
League fleet.”

  “We can get a force at Turkoon!”
the pirate girl flared. “The Compan-
ions of Space—my pirates! There’s
enough of them to capture the moon,
if they’ll follow me!”

  Thorn’s dead, hopeless eyes lit with
a faint spark of desperate hope. He
gripped Lana’s shoulders.

  “It could be done!” he cried hoarse-
ly. “But will they follow you in such
an attack, Lana?"

  “I’m afraid they won’t, lass,” Stili-
cho said apprehensively. “To the
Companions, the war between the
League and the Alliance doesn’t mean
anything.”

  “I think I can get them to follow
me,” Lana insisted with desperate de-
termination. “It’s the last chance for
the Alliance, John!”

  “We’ll take it!” Thorn cried.

"Quick, get the radite into the Ven-
ture! Every minute counts now!”

  With urgent haste, the precious
radite was transferred to the pirate
ship. Also the few dazed survivors in
the Saturnian cruiser were brought
along as prisoners by Thorn and his
party. In a few moments it had been
done, and Thorn ordered Stilicho to
start.

  “Top speed toward the Zone, Stili-
cho!” he cried. “Everything may de-
pend on how soon we reach Turkoon.”

  Like a shooting star, the Venture
swept sunward as it again built up to
phenomenal speed. For hour after
hour it raced toward the Zone, while
the Planeteers and Lana took turns
relieving the old pirate at the controls.

  Thorn’s state of mind was chaotic,
hope alternating with despair. The
knowledge that the long-menaced at-
tack of the League had finally been
launched, that the Alliance navies
were desperately retreating from the
overpowering armada of the outer
planets, was a goading agony.

  Stilicho was again at the firing-keys
when the Venture at last swept into
the Zone. Speed had necessarily been
reduced, and Thorn chafed at the
delay as the old pirate navigated
through the wilderness of great
meteor-swarms and planetoids.

  Then Turkoon appeared, a pale
green speck in the distance, largening
rapidly. ‘Down through the atmos-
phere of the pirate asteroid swept the
ship, toward the field of parked ships
that adjoined the straggling metal
patch of Turkoon Town.

THEY landed, and Lana and the
old pirate and the Planeteers were
first outside the Venture. A crowd of
hundreds of pirates and their women
was approaching hastily from the
town.

  Thorn recognized Brun Abo, the
scarred-faced Jovian pirate captain,
and Kinnel King, the handsome Earth-
man. They, and all the mass of hun-
dreds of Companions, uttered shouts
of joy as they recognized Lana.

  "You’re back, Lana! We thought
you dead for sure!” shouted Brun Abo
joyfully. Then the Jovian’s face stif-
102

STARTLING STORIES

fened and his hand darted to his pistol
as he recognized Thorn and Sual Av
and Gunner. “The Planeteers!”

  “The Planeteers and Stilicho were
the ones who rescued me!” Lana’s
silver voice rang out.

  She faced the jdyfully shouting
mob of pirates gathered in the pale
sunshine on the field. Her white face
was determined, as she spoke to them
in quick, ringing words.

  “Companions, you know of the at-
tack the League is making upon the
Alliance,” she began.

  “Aye!” roared a pirate in the
throng. “We’ve heard on the audio.
The latest word is that the League
fleet has pushed the Alliance navies
inside Mercury’s orbit, and are trying
to trap them and bring them to bat-
tle!"

  “We can save the Alliance from de-
feat, Companions!” Lana cried, her
blue eyes flashing. “On Earth’s moon
is a great weapon that can defeat the
League, if it could be used. But Has-
kell Trask and a strong force hold the
moon. That weapon can’t be used un-
less we pirates storm the moon, and
recapture it!”

  There was a dead silence. The pi-
rates looked at each other. Then a
tall Martian broke the silence.

  “Why should we do that, Lana?” he
demanded, “Whether the League or
the Alliance wins means nothing to
us. Now, while this war going on,
is our chance to raid all commerce.”
“Does it mean nothing to you that
the world of your birth is about to be
conquered and enslaved by a tyrant?”
Lana asked passionately. “You, Kin-
nel—you are an Earthman, will you
let Earth be ground under Trask's
heel? Most of you were born on the
inner worlds. You may be outlaws and
pirates now, but surely you have some
patriotism left?

  “And you, Brun Abo,” she con-
tinued scorchingly to the Jovian, “you
fled from Jupiter and became an out-
law to escape Trask’s tyranny. So did
nearly all you other outer-planet men.
Now is your chance to strike back at
the dictator who enslaved the outer
worlds and now is trying to enslave
the inner ones also!”

  “That’s all very well, Lana.” grum-
bled Brun Abo. “But I still don’t see
why we should fight for the Alliancc.”

  “Aye,” called a Venusian pirate.
“Let’s do any fighting we do for our-
selves.”

  “You will be fighting for your-
selves!” Lana flared. "You’ll be fight-
ing to establish in the Zone the new,
independent world I've dreamed so
long of establishing here."

LANA went on to tell them of her
cherished dream of making an in-
dependent world of the Zone, that
might be a refuge to all the oppressed
of the system, in the future.

  “That’s what you'll be fighting for!”
she finished fierily. "For if Haskell
Trask wins and dominates the whole
system, that dream can never be real-
ized. But if the Alliance wins, they’ll
help us establish our world here, from
gratitude!”

  The Companions’ eyes were shining
now as they listened. Lana’s plan, re-
vealed to them for the first time, had
fired them with excited enthusiasm.

  "We follow you then, Lana!” they
yelled.

  “Ah, now you’re talking like true
Companions,” cackled old Stilicho
Keene.

  "All ships prepare to blast off with
full crews!” Lana’s voice rang. “We’ll
need every man. Trask must have a
heavy force of cruisers and men on the
moon.”

  “Ho, we’ll show the cursed tyrant
how the Companions of Space fight!”
boomed Brun Abo.

  Kinnel King’s eyes were burning.

  “It will be good to strike a blow for
old Earth,” he muttered, as he hurried
off.

  The jungle-surrounded field became
a scene of intense, shouting activity as
the hundred ships of the Companions
were hastily prepared. Lana had or-
dered a new audio hastily installed in
the Venture to replace its damaged
one. She and the Planeteers listened
to the storm of messages vibrating
through the system, carrying word of
the League’s continued pursuit of the
Alliance fleet.

  “There’s so little time!” Thorn mur-
THE THREE PLANETEERS

103

mured hoarsely, "And, even if wc can
recapture the moon, if Blaine's inven-
tion fails—”

 Stilicho burst into the control-
room. “All ships ready to start, lass!”
he cried.

  “Take over, Stilicho,” she ordered,
and then spoke ringingly into the
audio.

  “Our course is straight sunward out
of the Zone, then directly toward
Earth's moon at top speed. Blast off!”

  With a roar of tubes, the Venture
leaped up from the field. And as it
cometed up through the atmosphere
of Turkoon, the five-score pirate
cruisers were rising like a flock of fal-
cons behind it, following its lead.

 “Keep down our speed to the top
speed of the others!" Lana told the
old pirate.

 Out through the Zone, a hundred
strong, throbbed the grim formation
of pirate ships, streaming in short
columns after the Venture, that led
the way through the swarms and
whirling planetoids. Quickly they
emerged from the Zone, and headed
toward the bright, shining planet and
smaller satellite that were Earth and
its moon.

 Thorn stared feverishly toward
their goal, as the pirate fleet picked up
speed in empty space. Somewhere
there in the barren moon was Trask,
and somewhere there, too, was the
mysterious mechanism that might, or
might not, decide the destiny of
worlds.

 Gunner Welk and Sual Av peered
forth with him. The Planeteers all
three sensed that they were approach-
ing a show-down in their long strug-
gle against the League dictator.

  Lana watched from beside old Stili-
cho, the space-dog, Ool, pressing
anxiously against her side.

  “Trask is sure to have a heavy force
there with him on the moon,” she mur-
mured. “If we don’t manage to break
through—”

 “We will!” Thorn exclaimed.
“You’ve set these pirates of yours on
fire with that plan to establish the
Zone as a new world. They feel now
that they’re fighting for their wOrld,
too.”

ROCKET-TUBES spouting white
fire from straining power-cham-
bers, the pirate force swept on for
hour after hour. At last they had
crossed Mars’ orbit and were thunder-
ing on at hazardous speed toward
Earth and its satellite.

  Earth largened ahead. Upon the
great, gray, cloudy sphere, Thorn
could glimpse the outlines of the
familiar continents, the white sheen of
the polar snows. And the moon was
expanding, too — lifeless, gleaming
white sphere, all its earthward face
in full sunlight.

  “Cut to landing-speed!” Lana cried
into the audio, and the velocity of the
pirate ships began to lessen.

  Sual Av, from the ’scope eyepiece,
shouted to John Thorn, who was now
holding the controls of the Venture.

  “League cruisers are pouring up out
of Copernicus crater—at least a hun-
dred and fifty of them!”

  “Then Copernicus must be where
Philip Blaine’s laboratories are, where
Trask is now!” Gunner yelled.

  “We’ll hit those cruisers before they
can form up for battle!” Thorn cried.
“On suits, everybody! Give the order,
Lana!”

  As the pirate girl shouted the or-
der into the audio, the pirate ships
grouped swiftly together into a pha-
lanx of which the Venture was the
apex. And as they drove straight
down toward the lunar surface, the
crews struggled hastily into their
suits.

  Thorn, at the controls, saw the sun-
lit surface of the moon rushing up to-
ward them, an airless, white desert
plain, with Copernicus crater almost
directly underneath, the vast white
blankness of the Mare Imbrium north-
ward, and the towering Appenines
northwestward.

  Out of the circular crater of Coper-
nicus, a fifty-mile plain surrounded by
a ring of stupendous peaks, League
cruisers were swarming up like star-
tled hornets from their nest. But be-
fore they could gain altitude or fall
into battle formation, the phalanx of
pirate ships crashed down among
them.

  It was a whirling chaos of battle
104

STARTLING STORIES

then for minutes—a raging dogfight
of League and pirate ships low across
the surface of the moon. Atom-shells
clogged space with blinding flares,
fatally hit ships went whirling down
out of control to crash on the lunar
desert, other ships collided in mid-
space and tumbled in a single twisted
mass of wreckage.

  But the Companions of Space main-
tained their formation. The pirates
were fighting with traditional feroc-
ity, pouring shells from every gun, in-
creasing the disorganization of the
League ships. Unable to form up,
broken into scattered groups of ships
that rapidly fell prey to the concen-
trated fire of the pirates, Trask’s
squadron was losing two ships to the
pirates’ one.

 When but a score of the League
ships survived, those survivors turned
and fled back toward Copernicus. At
once, Thorn swung the Venture
around in the same direction.

  “After them!” he shouted. “Now’s
our chance!”

  More than sixty pirate ships had
survived that terrific battle above the
moon. They raced after the Venture,
toward Copernicus.

  Thorn glimpsed the League cruisers
landing in the great crater, their crews
pouring forth in space-suits, retreat-
ing across the crater to where a great
glassite window glistened in its floor.

DOWN into the crater swept the
Companions’ ships, landing near
the deserted League cruisers. The
Planeteers and old Stilicho and Lana
raced down to the door of their ship,
the excited pirate crew gathering to
follow them out. “Lana, you can’t go
with us!” Thorn cried.

  The girl's eyes flashed inside her
glassite helmet.

  “I go!” she flared. “I’ve led the
Companions to battle before, and I’m
leading them now!”

  The door opened, and they poured
out onto the surface of the moon, onto
the floor Of the giant crater. Out of all
the other ships, the space-suited pi-
rates were pouring in hundreds.

  “Follow, men!” Lana’s voice rang
from her suit-audio. “See, they run

before us!"

  The League sailors were retreating
still toward that big glassite window
set in the floor of the crater. They
were firing back at the pirates with
their atom-guns as they retreated.

  The Planeteers and Lana and Stil-
icho led the pirate rush forward. And
beside the girl bounded the blazing-
eyed space-dog. Ool was in his native
element upon the airless surface of the
moon!

  Thorn saw that the League men
were retreating into the entrance of a
big airlock set in the crater floor be-
side the great window. An airlock
that he knew must give entrance into
the lunar cavern beneath that held
Blaine’s laboratory.

  With a fierce rush, the pirates swept
on. Men among them fell by dozens
from the bursting shells of the en-
emy’s guns. But they were firing back
as they charged, using their atom-pis-
tols with deadly effect as they ran.
Old Stilicho was shooting with two
weapons, his faded eyes burning in-
side his glassite helmet with fierce
battle-light. “They’ve jammed the air-
lock!” Thorn yelled. “At them!”

  The retreating League soldiers
could not all pass through the airlock
quickly enough. Down among those
who were congested at its entrance
swept Thorn and his wild followers.

  The League men, hopelessly out-
numbered, refused to surrender. Only
when all lay dead could Thorn and
his party advance through the door
of the airlock, which led downward.

  They poured into it, forcing open
the inner door. Air whistled out past
them, and from the blue-lit depths be-
low atom-shells whizzed up at them.
But they pressed savagely on, down
the ramp below the airlock, down into
the vast and gloomy lunar cavern.

sions, a thousand feet across and two
hundred in height. It was illuminated
by krypton lamps and by the flood of
brilliant sunlight that poured in
through the big glassite window in the
rocky ceiling.

  At the center of the cavern, under
that window, loomed a colossal and
unfamiliar mechanism. It was a great,
gleaming chromaloy sphere, support-
ed by girders above a massed com-
plexity of power-chambers and gener-
ators. Everything else in the cavern
was dwarfed by that towering, gleam-
ing globe.

  The space-suited League soldiers,
both those who had retreated from
outside and those in the cavern who
had hastily donned their suits, were
firing savagely at their attackers.

  Thorn tried to keep Lana behind
him as he advanced with Gunner and
Sual Av at the head of the pirates, his
atom-pistol hot in his gloved hand
from firing.

  “Gun them all down!" old Stilicho’s
shrill voice was crying from his suit-
audio.

  “John, look—they’re destroying the
machine, over there!” Sual Av yelled,
wildly pointing.

 Thorn glimpsed where the Venu-
sian pointed, far on the other side
of the colossal mechanism. A little
group of space-suited men there were
firing into Blaine’s huge machine with
their atom-pistols, endeavoring to de-
stroy its generators.

  “Forward!” Thorn shouted. “We’ve
got to stop them.”

  They rushed forward. And ahead of
them bounded the space-dog, Ool,
great-fanged jaws yawning wide!

  Reckless of their own lives, mad-
dened with apprehension, the Plane-
teers shot their way forward through
the disorganized mob of League de-
fenders.

 The September STARTLING STORIES was
very good. It had an excellent cover, quite
Intriguing. "The Bridge to Borth" was one of
the best novels I've seen in a long time.
STARTLING STORIES has certainly clicked
on the novels—the only one I haven't liked
Was “Giants From Eternity.”

  Williams’ story had a human touch to It
that was appealing. We could do with a good
sequel to It. "Cosmic Stage-' was a fair short,
but nothing extraordinary. "The Misty
Wilderness” was good; I enjoyed the scien-
tnle.

  The departments of S.S. are the best of any
scientlfictlon magazine out. In fact, I be-
lieve the departments help to make the maga-
zine an A-l presentation, ranking high up
with the leaders in the field.—P. O. Box No.

DEPARTMENT DEVOTEE

By Loretta Beasley

  Tour stories in the November issue of
STARTLING STORIES are good, and I liked
them. But this latter is about your depart*
ments.

  "Meet the Author” is o.k., and interesting,
but I would like to know more about the au-
thor, and less about how he came to think of
his plot.

  The Guest Editorial by Ralph Milne Farley
was well written, brief and had a reAl idea in
it. It made mo stop and thinlc; so many edi-
torials and article* are just a rehash of old
ideas and arguments.

  THRILLS IN SCIENCE is unique. No other
mag has anything like it, and the writing, by
Mort Weisinger, has real craftsmanship.

  I especially like the SCIENCE QUESTION
BOX, but I wish you would publish it in
smaller type bo that we could have more ma-
terial in it; every now and then you print a
question I’ve always wanted answered and
never could And out about.

 THE ETHER VIBRATES is perfect, in my
estimation. Please leave It as It is. and don't
print letters a mile long from some fans, be-
cause they take up too much room. Here's
where I put In a good word for the SCIEN-
TIFIC CROSSWORD PUZZLE. I love to do
them and they are hard to find, being prac-
tically as scarce as hen’s teeth. The puzzle is

  Now all these remarks are just one wom-

an’s opinions, so maybe the rest of your read-

  Anyhow. I’m still enthusiastic about your

HAMILTON TOPS
By Alan Saun

 “The Bridge to Earth," by Robert Moore
Williams, in the September. 1989, Issue of
STARTLING STORIES, was a marvelously
written story by an author who 1s fast becom-
ing one of my favorites. One of the reasons
why I enjoyed the novel immensely was be-
cause it was a subatomic yarn—my favorite
type of science action story.

 The first few HALL OF FAME stories were
familiar to me. But tho fifth one was new.
And I was glad to read "The Space Visitors,"
by Edmond Hamilton. I’ll never forget the
tremendous enjoyment I received while read-
ing that outstanding story. Hamilton pos-
sesses a truly magnificent Imagination. Now-
adays the majority of sclentifictlon stories we
read are quickly forgotten. Hamilton’s mas-
terpiece was certainly not among those. His
was a story that made you think after finish-
ing it. Edmond Hamilton Is my favorite fan-
tasy author. Very few readers will deny
that Hamilton's "The Prisoner of Mars, in
the May issue, was one of the greatest stories
ever written.

  How about getting those great artists, Alex
Schomburg and Marchlonl to illustrate future
issues? Wesso, incidentally, is very good.

"UTOPIA" PERFECT

By E. Earl Bielfeldt

  I have just finished reading the November
issue of STARTLING STORIES. It's a
"corker," as they say. "The Fortress of Uto-
pia" was one of Jack Williamson's boat, if not
the best, that I have ever read. One can al-
ways depend upon that versatile fellow to
turn out a bang-up story, though. It really
had a surprise ending. Every one of William-
son's stories is so different that one wonders
where he gets so many ideas. Usually, a
writer Will pick out a style and theme and run
It into the ground but not Jack Williamson.
Here's hoping he never runs out of ideas and
words.

 The Weinbaum masterpiece. "A Martian
Odyssey," was really a treat. I had never read
it, and was wondering if I ever would, when
along came S.S. with it in The Hall of Fame.
That feature is the best in the magazine. To
be sure, publish “The Valley of Dreams." If
it Is a sequel to this one. I'm sure that every-
one will want to read It.

  "Three Wise Men" was cleverly worked out.
I was really surprised at the hoax. The three
were pitiful—after the- disclosure of the trick.
This was a different type of story.

 "They Changed the World,” by Jack Bin-
der, is a very informative feature. It Is even
better than “If” in T.W.S. These two features
are the best things that Binder does. His
work Is of a variable nature, sometimes good
and sometimes bad. Never very bad, though.

  I could go on and on, but I don't wont to be
tiresome, so I’ll close with best Wishes.

BLASTING THE EDITOR

By Langley Searles

  Though I haven't yet found time to read the
latest Issues of T.W.S;, STARTLING STORIES
or STRANGE STORIES. I still have enough
material to fill a letter to you with.

  First, I want to compliment you on obtain-
ing artist Finlay, and compliment Finlay on
the magnificent double-page Illustration for
“The Citadel of Darkness" in the August
STRANGE STORIES. And also for the second
illustration to Talne's novelette In your An-
niversary Number. In my opinion. Finlay does
his best work for your magazines. I'd like to
see more of hi* work.
.110

STARTLING STORIES

  "While on the subject of artists, how about
bringing back Dold to s-f? Like Finlay, he
puts atmosphere into his drawings; often I
get the impression of pure crystallized action
—like a suddenly-snapped photograph—when
1 view some of his work. Some said that he
deteriorated In '3S and '89, but 1 rather think
that he simply was not given stories to illus-
trate that would properly show his individ-
ual, refined technique to the best advantage.
1 have followed hla work since '31, and have
always rated his artistic criterion high.

  Retain Schomburg; his work seems to be
meticulously up to standard the majority of
the time. However, I suggest that you give
Marchionl a friendly slap on the back and send
him packing olf—where he goes is immaterial,
as long as he keeps away from here.

 In the November STARTLING STORIES
Williamson's novel looks promising, although
I haven't started it yet. The cover shows up
well and the only fault I can find with it is
that you forgot to remove the "Ark of Space's”
price-tag—It’s still sticking on her nose.
Well, you're forgiven this time. After ex-
perimenting with color combinations on the
magazine’s backbone, why not adopt one for
uniformity’s sake? Personally. I prefer the
one on the latest issue (I think it shows up
the best) but any one will suit yours truly, if
you Btick to it regularly.

  I got to thinking the other day. I do little
correspondence with fellow fans, but almost
without exception—when I do, that is—the
fans mention In their reminiscences some-
thing like this: "Say, remember the readers’
columns in the old Wonder?” or: "Now take
the old Wonder Stories; they had a readers’
department to be proud of!" And so on. And
I thought—and still do think—that you could
have the best readers’ section In s-f right
now. Why not? Of course you can't supply
the columns’ material- that's up to the read-
ers. But a little careful choosing of the let-
ters printed, a little paragraph from the edi-
tor after each letter—all that would help at-
tain the goal. Little things like that all add
up, you know, and personal touches aid in
building up a friendly atmosphere of oanm-
rndcrle among the fans. More important, it
brings the editor closer to them, which also
goes a long way. A couple of years ago a fan
suggested that you eut down the type-size of
“The Reader Speaks." You did. He also
asked you to concentrate on making it a real
department. Whether or not you put con-
scious effort into doing that or no. I've no
idea; but 1 do know that since then I think
It's a better department. Now it's up to you
again: how about editorial answers to the
published letters?—19 East 235th St., New
York City.

  (No, the editor isn't a sphinx. Comments to
readers' letters are always appended when the
published letter calls for a reply. We won't
comment on a letter for comment's sake. The
ether vibrates with the opinions of the read-
ers—not the editor. And, quite often, a short
answer to a note would be Inadequate. A
long reply would be unfair to the readers
for whom this department is Intended. At

any rate, we'll talk when we have something
to say—either here, or in our editorials!—Ed.)

GENIUS

By R. Bayless

  I have followed science fiction for a number
of years now with the result that I can, I be-
lieve, compare the trends of this tjjie of writ-
ing with some degree of safety. Your maga-
zine has attempted to create a new form that
has been long anticipated and needed, that of
raising the ethical tone of the stories to a con-
siderably more mature (if I may use the
word) level. This is an extreme advance over
your predecessors and undoubtedly a verv
welcome one.

  We readers have been fed material that, If
not for its savagery, would be absolutely
childish and completely lacking in any taste
and discrimination whatsoever, and yet the
fault was not of the editor wholly, for he was
giving the public nothing more than they
wished. In presenting dwellers upon other
planets as beings with a reasonably developed
ethics, and not as the usual malignant mon-
sters intent upon nothing but murder and
ruin, you have raised science fiction from the
customary ten-year-old level to a state that
deserves praise.

  There Is one thing that still smacks of the
comic-section. however, and that is reflected
in the hero of your stories, for a hero under
seven feet without blond hair is apparently
unthinkable.

  There is one more grievance that needs air-
ing, that of the rather novel and promiscuous
use of the word genius. Apparently, science-
liction writers have never comprehended the
fact that a culture Is indicated, probably,
more by its artists, musicians, poets and
writers than by its scientists. At least as
great an indication as its science, if the last
sentence is too strong, though I would never

Elace a great scientist, with due regards for
is importance, in a class with Beethoven or
Rembrandt.

  A genius, according to such tales, need only
have a good deal of mathematical-mechanical
ability and if he should be so lucky as to work
in an underground laboratory and be acid-
stained, then his genius is undeniable. Some
day, perhaps, such writers will become aware
of the fact that scientists are of the utmost
importance, undoubtedly, but that when
placed by the titanic figure of Beethoven, they
must, of necessity, dwindle to relative Invisi-
bility. or compared to the flaming genius of
Shelley, be hidden.

 The scientists probe the Universe for
knowledge and do a most worthy job. but the
mighty genius of the arts needs no such tools,
or scratchings. tor he is absorbed in the very
flow of the universe and experiences the pas-
sions of reality.

  In spite of my criticisms, your advance Is
truly praiseworthy and I am hopeful that you
will continue in such improvements.—1146 S.

WATER IN THE SUN

Editor. SCIENCE QUESTION BOX:

Is there any water in the sun? That may sound like a foolish question, but the spec-
troscope tells us that oxygen and hydrogen exist in the solar orb. So why not water,
too?—G. H. W., Cheyenne, Wyoming.

Scientists are quite certain that there is no
water in the sun. True, oxygen and hydro-
gen, both components of water, exist in the
sun. as they do on Earth. And also, Inasmuch
as both gases have a tremendously strong
affinity for each other to combine and form
water, your question has some grounds.

But there can be no water In the sun be-
cause the cun is so Incredibly hot that none

 of the elements, not even oxygen and hydro-
 gen. can combine there. As a matter of fact,
 by producing intense heat science can sep-
 arate hydrogen and oxygen of water apart.
 That is exactly what happens in the sun: or.
 rather, the sun has never been cool enough
 to allow them to come together, and so there
 can be no water produced.—Ed.

WEIGHT Of THE ATMOSPHERE

Editor, SCIENCE QUESTION BOX:

Is there any way of determining the weight of our atmosphere? If so, what is its
weight?—J. C., Washington, D. C.

  The pressure of the atmosphere at sea level
averages about 14.7 pounds to the square Inch,
which corresponds to a reading of 2S.92 inches
or the barometer. The density and pressure
of the air decrease rapidly as we ascend. At
an altitude of 8.6 miles above sea level they
are reduced one hair. The atmosphere ex-
tends, however, many hundreds of miles above
the earth, becoming rarer and rarer with in-

crease of altitude.

  Above six miles, as we know, it Is too rare
to support life. Still higher it becomes more
tenuous than the best "vacuum" we can
attain with an air-pump. The total weight of
the atmosphere. It is calculated from these
premises, is about B.683,000,000,000,000 tons.—
Ed.

THE LAWS OE CHANCE

Editor, SCIENCE QUESTION BOX:

A few years ago I read a science fiction story, “The Circle of Zero,” by Stanley G.
Weinbaum, which I believe was published in your companion magazine. THRILLING
WONDER STORIES. The story, as part of its theme, discussed the laws of chance.
In connection with this, can yon enlighten me on one point concerning the laws of chance?
Let us suppose I’ve tossed a coin ten times, and each time the coin showed up with heads.
Now, the next toss, the eleventh, should be tails, for it seems extremely unlikely that the
heads Streak will continue. But isn’t the chance that heads will turn up again equally pos-
sible? How do the laws of chance operate in this case?—M. K., Beaver Dam. Wisconsin.

 Good work! You're quite right In your
surmise. Bertrand, the French mathemati-
cian. illustrates your point with the observa-
tion that the coin has neither memory nor
consciousness, The coin Is an Inorganic, in-
animate object. and the motivation guiding
the fact whether heads or tails shows up Is
due to Its actual physical construction, and
not to any predetermination on the part of
the coin. On each and every chance there
Is always the same probability that heads
or tails will turn up. Whether you're bet-
ting on what turns up after the coin has
showed up with the 3ame surface for several
consecutive times has nothing whatever to

do with the following toss.

  In his book, “Science Examines the Laws
of Chance." Dr. Horace C. Levinson reminds
us that it is not true that "In the long run
there ought to be as many heads as tails.”
The correct statement is: in the long run
we expect the proportion of heads and that
of tails to be approximately equal. The pro-
portion of heads means the number of heads
divided by the total number of tosses: If the
coin Is tossed one thousand times, and there
ore 547 heads, the proportion of heads Is
547 -r- 1,000, or 547/1,000. while in this same
series the proportion of tails Is 453/1.000.—

 The Men froni Mors Were
 Freaks—But They Were
 More Than Human!

By
OSCAR J.
FRIEND

Author of "Coup d'Etat" “Robot Al,” etc.

ZENTOR, instructor in astron-
omy and mathematics, faced his
class, his faintly lavender aura
pulsing like a corona about his tall
and pallid form. His large, bulging
eyes flashed a benign glance as a stu-
dent’s tentaclelike little arm rose in
salute.

  "Your lesson, Taurel,” Zentor or-
dered.

 The Martian student’s dead-white
little body pulsed bravely with its
faint aura as the child put forth his
concentrated mental reply. All of the
other students glowed in pale lumi-
nence as they put themselves in re-
ceptive state to receive his thought
emanations.

 “Yes, sir,” communicated Taurel.
‘Helios turns toward the east. Due to
its gaseous nature, it does not rotate
as a solid body, the regions nearer its
poles moving more slowly.”

  The little student’s pulsing aura
subsided, and the professor glowed his
approval.

 “Excellent, my little man. Now,
who can name the inferior planets,
giving their diameters and mass?”
Another tentacular little arm went
up, and Zentor signaled permission to
broadcast.

  ■‘There are nine planets in the fam-
ily of Helios,” came the pulsing re-
ply. “The—”

juncts. Hairless, pallid of counte-
nance, bulging of eye, arms terminat-
ing in three fingers, they looked more
like slugs than children of men. And
about each, like a delicate cloak of
shimmering light, pulsed a visible
aura.

  Zentor, in full maturity, stood a
good eight feet tall. Otherwise, he
was a larger specimen of the same or-
der as the little tots before him. And
little tots they were, not a one of them
being more than six Earthly years of
age.

   A panel in one wall slid noiselessly
open, and a second, tall man entered
the chamber. His aura pulsed out
brilliantly as he transmitted an urgent
message to Zentor.

  “You are wanted at home, Profes-
sor. Your wife just televised. The
mentor of the museum is waiting.”

  Zentor’s aura paled, then pulsed an
angry red.

  ‘‘Thank you, Laktos. Will you take
the class?”

   Zentor hastened out in the shuffling
walk peculiar to these people. His
substitute pulsed sympathetically.
Alas, poor Zentor was pitied by all
who knew of his affliction. He was
the father of twin monstrosities.
Phobos and Deimos, named for the
moons of Ares, were sports—atavistic
throwbacks to a dim and distant past.

  Now nearly eight years of age, the
twin sons of Zentor were physical
monstrosities. Born with five fingers
on each hand, five toes on each loot,
even their color was the pale green of
the ancient dwellers of the outer
world. They were freaks. Nothing
remotely resembling them had been
born on Ares in more than a hundred
thousand years.

  Zentor bitterly contemplated all
this as he entered his gravi-slide,
gripped the long rod at the right of
the pilot’s stool, and let a detached
portion of his brain activate the bank
of machinery behind him. The per-
pendicular rod, similar in construc-
tion to the emergency brake of a mo-
tor car, was not unlike the joy-stick of
an early airplane. Its function, how-
ever, was vastly different. It was the
thought-energizer.

  Inhabiting the underground, men

of Ares had gone far beyond atomic
power and electro-magnetics. The
boilerlike machine behind Zentor,
with its rows and banks of condensers,
came to life with a silent ease that was
uncanny. Zentor was driving his
queer sled by sheer mental force.
Operating the two simple pad pedals
beneath his rudimentary feet, he
steered the gravi-slide out into the or-
derly flow of traffic.

  For nearly eight years Zentor had
fought against the inevitability of this
hour. Shocked and aghast at the birth
of the twin monstrosities he had un-
wittingly sired, he had been at a loss
to account for their weird appearance
until he had searched through vol-
umes of ancient records. Relief at
finding they were not alien forms was
submerged in the shocking fact that
they were atavisms reaching back two
hundred thousand years.

  The only comfort in the entire
tragedy was the fact that their minds
were brilliant. It was as if Nature
were trying to compensate in gray
matter for the terrible affliction she
had imposed physically.

IN the vaulted dome of his library
Zentor found the mentor of the
great museum of Ares and a commit-
tee of four members awaiting him.
Standing respectfully in the presence
of their elders, clad in their specially
tailored garments of blue metal cloth,
their outlandish feet encased in pli-
able metal boots the like of which had
not trod the ground of Ares In two
hundred thousand years, stood Dei-
mos and Phobos.

  “Ah, Zentor!” the mentor com-
municated. “You will have to accede
to the orders of the Supreme Council.
Here is the authority to take your
monstrous progeny into custody and
place them in the museum for the edu-
cation and edification of the race.”

  He held forth in one undulating
tentacular hand a thin metal scroll
embossed with the seal of the Supreme
Council.

  “I knew you would never rest, Mb-
lees, until you succeeded in tearing
my sons from me,” flashed back Zen-
tor as his great eyes read the order.
“And you have still failed. Before I
114

STARTLING STORIES

will let my sons be placed on exhibi-
tion like—like freaks, I will appeal to
the Council in person.”

 Malees gave the equivalent of a
shrug.

 Zentor’s wife came forward and
placed a tentacle on her husband’s
shoulder.

 “Oh, Zentor,” she communicated
sorrowfully, “must our own flesh and
blood—be exhibited to the common
public gaze like—like the fossil skele-
ton of the Wau-wau, the chained and
caged specimens of the prehistoric
Sauk?”

  “Not while I live!" flamed Zentor.
“Malees, you and your precious com-
mittee get out! Leave my dwelling!”
“You mean you will disobey the or-
der of the Council?” Malees was in-
credulous.

  “Father,” the aura of Phobos pulsed
in lavender beauty. “Loath as Deimos
and I are to submit to such treatment,
you must not incur the displeasure of
the Council. We will submit to the
command.”

 “Why must you?” Zentor flashed
back. “What crime are you guilty of,
my sons? Only that you have been
born with obsolete bodies. Your
brains are the equal, nay, superior to
others of your age. It would break
your mother’s heart for you to be
placed on exhibition like common—”
“After all,” Deimos flashed, gesticu-
lating at his brother and himself with
slender green hands, “we are freaks.
If we can advance science, if we can
entertain the people of Ares by a
shameless exhibition of our bodies—’’
"No, no!” pulsed their mother. “I
can’t bear the thought.”

 “Wait!” communicated Zentor. “I
will appeal to the Council first. I am
not disobeying, Malees; I am claiming
the right of intercession. Now, be
off!”

THEIR auras pulsing all colors of
the rainbow, the mentor and his
committee withdrew. The two un-
fortunate lads and their mother
turned anxiously to the frantic Zen-
tor.

 "I must think! I must think!” he
flashed to them in agony. "Rather
death than the pitiless exposure to all

of Ares. And for what? Simply be-
cause you are physical throwbacks.
Ah, the cruelty of evolution.”

  “Isn’t there some place we can go,
Father?” asked Phobos, speaking
aloud as well as thinking his query.
The sound made them all jump, so un-
accustomed were they to audible
speech.

  “Two hundred thousand years be-
hind us in physical evolution,” pon-
dered Zentor bleakly. “And that
makes you freaks!”

  “Some place to go,” repeated Dei-
mos, looking at his brother. “Hasn’t
astronomy taught us anything?
Hasn’t it shown us a place of refuge?
Are you afraid to risk the death of an
explorer, Phobos?”

  Suddenly, Zentor’s aura pulsed
brightly.

  “I have it! I have it—thanks to
you boys!” he flashed. “Attend me.
Ancient astronomers spent much time
studying the heavens. A forgotten
fact that I uncovered in seeking an ex-
planation of your bodies comes to
mind. Life is not peculiar to Ares.
Upon the next inferior planet of our
Solar System—Terra—there is life of
the same general classification as ours.
Terra, having a race that is startling-
ly similar to ours, should just now be
at the approximate stage of evolution
which your two bodies represent.
There, on Terra, you would be super-
men!”

 “But—but, how would they get
there?” demanded the mother help-
lessly.

  “The gravi-slide!” exclaimed Dei-
mos, his brilliant young mind follow-
ing his father’s thought.

  “A transparent plastic shell about it
would protect us from the airless cold
of the void!” flashed Phobos enthusi-
astically. “With the mental energy of
both of us to activate it, a two-seated
gravi-slide will be ample to essay the
voyage.”

  “It is possible!” flashed Zentor.
“There are many details to work out,
but it can be done.”

  “Oh, my poor sons!” mourned the
mother. “Victims of a terrible acci-
dent. Zentor, I cannot let them at-
tempt—”

  “Better that than a life in a freak
MIND OVER MATTER

115

museum,” reminded Zentor. “How-
ever, the choice is theirs.”

  "We choose Terra!” flashed the
monstrous twins together. “Let us
make ready. . .

EARTH was mad! Upon that
beautiful, cloud-mantled, ver-
dant globe spinning gracefully
through the majestic void at a mean
distance of 92,900,000 miles from the
sun there was war—holocaust! That
devastating spark touched off by the
Second World War of 1939 had been
the final catastrophe. Nation was bat-
tling against nation indiscriminately.
Vast armies and navies and air forces
were marching and steaming and fly-
ing eagerly to their rendezvous at
Armageddon. The fury and hatred of
mankind blazed to the greatest and
most consuming height in history.

  Then, out of the western sky, flash-
ing like a meteor through the strato-
sphere, came a queer machine. It
looked like a glorified bob-sled. Upon
two pedestal stools in the very front
of the aerial sled sat a pair of the
strangest creatures ever to appear in
man’s form on or above Earth. And
the entire contraption was encased in
a transparent shell of what looked like
fused quartz.

  Alien, fearsome, terrifying and awe-
inspiring, this bizarre craft with its
more grotesque passengers swept
across the sky. But there was no one
to give the alarm, to peer through the
mighty telescopes and warn the world
of alien invasion. Man was busy at
more important things. He was
butchering his fellowmen and de-

stroying such things as telescopes and
observatories and industrial centers.

  Phobos and Deimos, exhausted and
weary from their miraculous flight
across the void, their great, bulging
green heads fairly aching from the
terrific mental strain of their inter-
planetary journey, were conscious of
a withering blast of hatred which
smote their senses in an almost over-
powering wave before they had
plunged their craft through the ob-
scuring clouds.

  “Deimos,” pulsed Phobos, who was
operating the dual controls while his
brother relaxed beside him, “take your
energizer quickly! I—I need assist-
ance. We’ve struck a mental vortex.”
But Deimos was already reaching
out for his control rod, his feet already
on the foot treadles aiding his twin in
managing the mentally driven craft.

  “By the Infinite Creator, Phobos!”
he communicated. “What hellish
emanation is this?”

  “Mass hatred,” flared Deimos. “No
one or even a dozen mentalities could
generate this awful power.”

  For a space the two brothers were
silent as they guided their gravi-slide
down through the chaos of poisoned
thought waves and received their first
glimpse of Terra. Two great rows of
portholes in the floor of their sled be-
gan to glow, shooting out the pale
green rays of gravitation nullifiers.
Like a great albatross the aerial sled
glided smoothly along in a sweeping
rush at the rate of five or six hundred
miles per hour.

  Now, for the first time, the rush of

[Turn page]
116

air became audible to their large and
pointed green ears. They were speed-
ing across Central Europe—although
they did not yet know it by that name
—and the terrible concussion of gun-
fire quivered against their delicately
receptive eardrums.

  “Mankind is mad I” Phobos com-
municated to his brother. “Explo-
sives! Antique aircraft! Look,
brother, a fleet of ten are circling to—
to attack us!”

DEIMOS' only answer for the
moment was an increasing glow
of his aura as he expended his mental
energy to throw a protective shield
about the gravi-slide. The rat-tat-tat
of machine-gun fire broke upon their
ears. The mushrooming clouds of the
bursting shells of anti-aircraft guns
blossomed around them. But they
swept, unscathed, through shot and
shell and angrily attacking planes.

 “Primitive weapons!” communi-
cated Deimos. “Men of Terra haven’t
even yet discovered atomic power, a
simple force which we of Ares dis-
carded a hundred thousand years ago.”
"True. What do you suggest we do,
brother? We can’t encircle this globe
in this fashion for eternity. We must
land and replenish our supplies. You
realize what happens to men of Ares
who burn up their mental capacity
without pausing to rest and rebuild
and replenish."

 “Their minds blank out—bum up
like dynamos," Deimos pulsed in re-
ply. “Remember Cronos, the presi-
dent of the Supreme Council? He
drov« himself without cessation for
thirty days in his battle with the forces
of the subterranean worm people.”

  “He became as a child again,” com-
municated Phobos in reply. “He gave
his mind for his country.”

  “And we have been nearly thirty
days making this spatial voyage,"
pointed out Deimos.

  “But there have been two of us, re-
lieving each other. And we have
taken turns ingesting nutriment and
resting. I say, let us explore this globe
and find a more suitable spot for land-
ing. Let us get out of this maelstrom
of hate emanation. It is making me
weary and ill. Here! Surrender the

entire control to me and relax.”

  Gratefully, Deimos obeyed. He re-
laxed on his stool and reached behind
him for the door of a little cabinet as
his twin gripped his own energizing
rod tighter, and his aura flamed out
in miniature rivalry of the corona of
Helios. The gravi-slide accelerated
in a breathless swoop which shot them
across the battlefields of France and
over the Pyrenees to glide above the
war-torn reaches of Spain.

  From the cabinet Deimos extracted
a crystal vial of concentrated glan-
dular tablets and placed two of the pel-
lets in his mouth, permitting them to
dissolve like sour balls before he
slowly chewed up the fragments with
the hardened ridges in the front of his
mouth which were the vestigial re-
mains of Martian teeth.

  His aura slowly brightened as his
system assimilated the vital nourish-
ment. From the ground below thought
waves still bombarded the twins, but
there was an underlying note of misery
and despair in the blanket of mental
emanations that tore at their heart-
strings.

  “Phobos, this planet is sick," Deimos
communicated. “Let us span its conti-
nents and study the inhabitants. If we
stay out of war zones, we can devote
one lobe of our brains to research. Per-
haps we will be able to aid these suf-
fering men of Terra.”

  “Agreed,” promptly pulsed h i s
brother.

FIOR forty-eight hours the huge
gravi-slide slipped through the sky
faster than a projectile, winding its
path around and around the spinning
globe of mankind while the two pilots
received the mingled thought im-
pulses of men and probed and sought.
Gradually a comprehensive picture of
the miserable sufferings and struggles
of humanity came to them.

 It was when they were passing
above the devastated area of bleeding
China that the twins reached a mo-
mentous decision.

  “Look, Deimos!” pulsed Phobos.
“Yellow men—more nearly like us
than any other of the confusing races
of Terra. And all of them weary of
war and dying of bitter hatred of their
MIND OVER MATTER

117

fellows.”

  “Yes,” communicated Deimos. “I
have looked. I have listened. Pho-
bos, are you afraid to become—like
Cronos?”

  “You mean?” questioned Phobos,
but he already knew what his brother
was thinking.

  “I mean that we could concentrate
our thought emanations and combat
the hate thoughts of Terra with broth-
erly love and benevolence. Perhaps
we could blot out all hatred and greed
and intolerance within the soul of
mankind—if we gave all. While our
poor bodies are only a few hundred
thousand years in advance of men of
Terra, our minds are half a million
years beyond them.”

  “Ah!” communicated Phobos softly.
“Perhaps our combined efforts, supple-
mented by the machinery of the gravi-
slide, might beat down through the
puny consciousness of terrestrials and
obliterate their baseness. A noble ex-
periment, brother. But can we suc-
ceed against the combined mass
thought of teeming millions?”

  “We can try,” pulsed Deimos.
Phobos looked down. He had
learned to love the celestial beauty
of the sky, the clouds, the blue
mountains, the green-clad hills, the
sparkling blue of lakes and rivers, the
wind, the birds—everything of beauty
about this sister world to Ares—every-
thing of joy and ecstasy that barren
Ares had not.

  “A wonderful planet,” he murmured
aloud. “A world worth living for.
And men are laying it waste, dying
for it—and never gaining it. We will
try, Deimos!”

  For seven days and nights the huge
gravi-slide from outer space circled
with the sun about the spinning globe
of Terra. From the incredible height
of twenty miles the pale green cones
of light from the two rows of port-
holes increased in intensity and
spread fanwise across the surface of
the Earth.

 And a miracle happened. War
suddenly ceased to exist. Soldiers
threw down their weapons and ran
forward to laugh and cry and embrace
their enemies. Strong men bent to
perform all sorts of acts of kindness.

Mankind, stunned at his own former
savagery, set about rebuilding a tot-
tering civilization. A new era, a new
millennium was dawning.

THE end of their spiraling journey,
the seventh day, brought Phobos
and Deimos northward across the
mighty Pacific Ocean and across an
isthmus of land where an ingenious
system of locks and canals wedded
two mighty bodies of water. The
Panama Canal!

  Locked in battle for possession of
this powerful waterway two great
armies were fighting — yellow men
from the Orient and khaki-clad white
men from the United States of
America.

  The week had wrought a terrible
change in the twins. Gaunt to the
point of emaciation, faces drawn and
withered, their auras pulsing weakly
with a sickish mauve hue, they di-
rected their sled heavily, sluggishly.
Two days ago they had ingested the
last of their concentrated food. They
had exhausted every possible bit of
substance and supply. They were
burning up their brilliant mentalities.

  “Look, Phobos,” pulsed Deimos,
weakly raising one hand to indicate
the scene of carnage below. “One su-
preme effort we must make. This is
the last plague spot.”

  “And it means our utter annihila-
tion,” communicated Phobos.

  “Are you afraid to die, my brother?”
asked Deimos.

  “Not with you at my side,” pulsed
Phobos. And he directed the gravi-
slide lower and across the battlefront
so that the weakening rays of benevo-
lent effulgence could bathe the com-
batants impartially.

  Squarely above the flaming holo-
caust of bursting bombs the gravi-slide
swept. American soldiers in units of
three on brazen platforms that looked
like golden discs looked up in terror
and swiveled their ray guns to blank
out the approaching nightmare craft.

  “The Japs! The Japs!” they cried,
and the rays seared like vivid fire
through and through the gravi-slide.

  So exhausted and drained by their
Herculean task were the twins that
they no longer could maintain a pro-
118

tective shield about their craft. But
the green rays did their work. And
the last men in the world bearing
arms threw down their weapons and
left their stations, stumbling about in
bewilderment.

  With a last, almost convulsive ef-
fort, Phobos headed the gravi-slide
northward and impelled it onward
toward the sweeping prairies of Texas.
Like a dying meteor, the queer craft
flashed over the rim of the horizon,
sinking heavily.

  It crashed just north of Austin,
Texas. There was a vivid flash of light
which lit up the prairie for several
miles, and then darkness. . . .

ffW NCREDIBLE! Simply astound-

 M mg!”

  Dr. Frederick Corning removed his
stethoscope with trembling fingers.
He looked from one to the other of the
two bizarre forms stretched out on the
pair of hospital cots. He looked
around at his circle of assistants.

  "I still don’t believe it," he de-
clared. ‘‘It’s impossible!”

  The staff, collectively, nodded.
When Dr. Corning, the head surgeon
of the City Hospital, didn’t believe
anything, it couldn’t be so.

 “Where are the men who found
these—these monstrosities?” the sur-
geon went on. “I want to interview
them.”

 The two farmers were quickly
brought in.

  “Zeb and me had just finished milk-
in’,” explained Lem Thompson, re-
peating his story, “when we seen a
flash of light. Then we heard a kind
of crash in the lower pasture. It
scared us for a minute. We thought
the Japs had come up from Mexico.
Then we found these here freaks lyin’
half in the frog pond. Up on the bank
was what was left of some kinda ma-
chine they musta had—looked like an
engine boiler, and there was a lot of
broken glass. It was still blazin’.

  “But these—these things was still
breathin’, so we loaded ’em in the
truck and brought 'em straight to
town.”

  “And you never saw them before?”
inquired the surgeon.

  “Never even heard o’ such crazy-

lookin’ folks. They're foreigners of
some kind.”

  The doctor turned back to the limp
forms on the cots.

  “Yes.” he said slowly, “they’re for-
eigners—of some kind. And the
miracle is that they've lived from birth
—not that they survived their acci-
dent.”

 "But, my God, Doctor!” murmured
an intern, shuddering. “What man-
ner of things are they?”

  “Don’t lose your nerve, Hardwick,”
said the chief of staff. “We will make
a thorough examination—if they live.
They look like Egyptian mummies—
travesties of mummies—but there is,
of course, a natural explanation.
Hmmm—nearly seven feet tall. That
is odd. But their color, if it isn’t due
to the explosion, indicates that a valve
of the heart has not closed properly,
thus giving them that greenish blue
cast. And the bulging cranium—
acromegaly, if I ever saw it—indicates
an advanced stage of phrenitis which
has all but burst the bony structure.
The huge and protruding eyeballs
show ophthalmic goiter or brain
tumors.

  “They can’t possibly live in this
condition, but we’ll do the best we can
for them.”

 “Where are we going to keep them
—if they live?” inquired an associate
physician. “And who will pay for
their treatment? Who are they, any-
way?”

  “That comes later. Our duty now is
to alleviate their misery.”

 Astonishingly enough, Phobos and
Deimos survived their disaster. No
longer mantled in shining aura of
glowing energy, carefully secluded
in a private ward, they grew stronger
and recuperated—physically. Their
minds, too weak and burnt out to send
or receive thought transmissions, re-
mained imbecilic. And all during the
days of their convalescence a frantic
search went on to locate the guardians
or institutions from which they had
escaped.

 John William Prescott solved the
problem of their future care. Mr.
Prescott was a publicity promoter.
Arriving in the van of the swarm of
news reporters and newsreel men, he
MIND OVER MATTER

went out to see the wreck at Thomp-
son's frog pond.

  “Yeah, men from space, that’s it,” he
said in reply to the farmer's query.
“So you have an option on them—see-
ing as how you found them on your
place. Well, listen, friend, here’s how
you and I can both become rich. Weil
exhibit them as living monstrosities!
That wreck yonder as a space ship?
Naw! That piece of junk couldn’t fly
a kite. Weil build them a fake rocket
ship—bill them as Castor and Pollux,
the heavenly twins. . .

THE fat lady from Iowa paused
just north of Times Square in
front of the “Believe It If You Can”
museum and looked at the huge poster
as her ears strained to catch the pat-
ter of the bull-throated barker.

  “Constant and complete show of
amazing oddities of the entire world,
ladies and gentlemen. Twenty-five
cents, and you see the greatest collec-
tion of monstrosities in the world.
Don’t miss Castor and Pollux, the
giant boys from Venus. See fragments

of their rocket ship picked up in the
Texas badlands. Most marvelous ex-
hibit of its kind. . .

 The lady succumbed. Paying her
quarter, she entered the museum par-
ticularly to see the twins. For a long
moment she stood before the platform
where a pair of attenuated green
skeletons seven feet tall stared idiotic-
ally out over the jostling throng of
curious spectators.

 “Ridiculous!” snorted the lady
from Iowa. “Castor and Pollux, in-
deed! Mike and Ike is more like it.
They’re fakes!”

  And then she stared violently and
looked around in sudden fear. But
she knew nobody had spoken. The
thought had simply exploded in her
brain, spontaneously.

 “Not fakes, madam. Freaks!”

 The worthy lady, her face white,
took one last look and scurried for
the exit.

 Two pairs of great, bulging eyes
followed her retreating form in such
idiocy as to haunt her for all the rest
of her days.

STARTLING STORIES

THE THREE PLANETEERS

(Continued from page 105)

them, they forced through to the other
side of the gigantic machine.

  Thorn recognized the tall, space-
suited figure of the leader of the little
group who were trying to destroy the
mechanism. The face inside that
glassite helmet was the bony green
face and insanely raging eyes of Has-
kell Trask.

  “Throw down those guns!” Thorn
yelled through his suit-audio. “Sur-
render!”

  “I’ll surrender this way!” Trask’s
crazed, harsh voice came back.

  The dictator shot at Thorn in the
same instant. The little shell flicked
past Thorn and exploded behind him
—and Lana Cain sank to the floor as
the blinding flare touched her side.

  Wild with rage, Thorn raised his
gun to fire. But Ool was ahead of him.
The big space-dog, eyes terrible as it
saw its mistress fall, arced through
space in a leap straight at Trask.

 The huge jaws closed upon the
throat of the dictator’s space-suit—and
tore. The other League men beside
Trask shrunk back appalled, raising
their hands in surrender.

  The battle in the cavern behind the
Planeteers was over. The remaining
League defenders, seeing their Leader
fall, raised their hands in surrender
also, dropping their weapons.

  Thorn was bending frantically over
the fallen pirate girl.

  “Lana!” he cried.

  “I’m—not much hurt,” the girl stam-
mered, stumbling up with his help.
“The side of my suit is scorched. I
threw myself aside to avoid the shell,
and that’s why I fell.”

SHE sprang unsteadily forward,
and gripped Ool’s collar to pull
him off the prostrate dictator. But it
was too late. The space-dog’s great
tusks had ripped through Haskell
Trask’s suit and torn his throat.

  Trask looked up at them with pale
eyes curiously drained of emotion.

  “I—would have ruled the system for
—its own good,” he murmured. “I
would have—” He sighed, and was
still.

  So a dictator died. . . .

  Thorn straightened shakenly. The
airlock doors had been closed and oxy-
generators were throbbing. And old
Stilicho, his helmet off and face still
flaming with battle-light, came forc-
ing through the excited pirate throng
with another man.

  “Found this fellow prisoned in a
separate chamber,” the old pirate
shrilled. “He says he’s—”

  “Philip Blaine!” Sual Av shouted.
Blaine, greatest of Earth physicists,
the man who had built the mysterious
mechanism that towered over them!

  He was a thin, frail-looking little
man, with disheveled gray hair and
wide eyes frantic with anxiety.

  “Trask made me a prisoner when his
force captured the moon!” he babbled.
“He tried to make me tell him what
my machine is, how it’s operated—”
“Blaine, we’ve brought you the ra-
dite that will operate this thing!”
John Thorn cried. “But even now the
Alliance navies are being cornered in-
side Mercury by the League fleet. Can
you save them with this thing?”
Blaine’s eyes flashed. “You’ve
brought the radite? But some of my
generators have been damaged!”

  The little physicist sprang forward,
bending with wild anxiety over the
fused generators that had been
wrecked by Trask and his men in those
last moments.

  “Can you repair them in time?"
Thorn asked with feverish tensity.

  “I can try,” Blaine rasped. “I have
spare generators in my supply cavern,
but it will take time to install them.”
“For God's sake, hurry!” Thorn
begged. “Gunner, take some men and
bring in the radite from the Venture!”
Pirates under Thorn’s direction
hastened to carry in the spare gener-
ators from the supply cavern adjoin-
ing. Blaine began the task of install-
ing them, the little physicist working
alone, none of the hundreds of others
in the cavern able to assist him.

Thorn looked up haggardly through
the great window in the ceiling, at the
blazing sun. Somewhere there in the

HAVE you ever tried? Have you ever at-
tempted even the least bit of training, un-
der competent guidance?

  Or have you been sitting back, as it is so
easy to do, waiting for the day to come some
time when you will awaken, all of a sudden, to
the discovery “I am a writer”?

If the latter course is the one of your chousing, you

Srobably never will write. Lawyers must be law clerks,
ngineers must be draftsmen. We all know that, in
our times, the egg does come before the chicken.

   It Is seldom that any one becomes a writer until lie
(or she) has been writing for some time. That is why
so many authors and writers spring up out of the
newspaper business. The day-to-day necessity of
writing—of gathering material about which to write
—develops their talent, their insight, their back-
ground and their confidence as nothing else could.

   That Is why the Newspaper Institute of America
bases its writing instruction on Journalism—continu-
ous writing—the training that has produced so many
successful authors.

Learn to write by writing

\JEWSPAPER Institute training Is based on the New

writing in your own home, on your own time. Week by
week you receive actual assignments, just as if you were
right at work on a great metropolitan daily. Your writing
is individually corrected and constructively criticized by
veteran editors. You will find that (instead of vainly trying
to copy some one else's writing tricks) you are rapidly de-
veloping your own distinctive, self-flavored style—under-
going an experience that has a thrill to it and which at
the same time develops in you the power to make yonr feet

  Many people who thotdd be writing bccome awe-struck
by fabulous stories about millionaire authors and give little
thought to the $25, $60 and $1C0 or more that can often
be earned for material that takes little time to write—

 burning reaches of space near the flam-
 ing orb, the combined navies of Mer-
 cury, Venus, Earth and Mare were
 seeking to elude the League armada
 bent on their destruction.

   Sual Av came running up to where
 Thorn stood rigidly with Lana.

   “John, I got a flash from Blaine’s
 audio just now!” the Venusian pant-
 ed. “The League fleet has divided in-
 to two forces and is boxing our navies
 five million miles off Mercury!"

  “Can't you hurry, Blaine?” Thom
 begged the little scientist desperately.

  “I’m—almost through,” panted the
 physicist. He was gasping from ex-
 haustion, as he made his last connec-
 tions.

   “This thing won’t save our navies.
 It can't save them!” groaned Gunner
 Welk. "How can a machine here in-
 side the moon affect a space-battle six-
 ty million miles away?”

  “Ready—now,” gasped Philip
Blaine. “Bring me that radite!”

 THE Planeteers hauled forward
 the asterium-wrapped mass of ra-
 dite. With tongs, Blaine tore away
 the protective asterium sheets. The
 unveiled radite blazed with dazzling
 white radiance, like a solid chunk of
 the sun.

   Blaine rolled it into the injector-
 hopper of his power-chambers, with
 the tongs. He slammed down the lid,
 and then stumbled toward the huge
 switchboard set in the cavern wall.

   “Stand back, all of you!” he panted.

   His trembling hands moved rapidly
 among the switches and relays of the
 panel. And the power-chambers be-
 low the gleaming sphere began to
 throb with mounting energy.

   Louder and louder throbbed the mas-
 sive chambers as the radite was disin-
 tegrated inside them to produce such
 concentrated power as had never be-
 fore been produced in one place. And
 now the proton-turbines of the great
 generators were droning loud, adding
 to the deafening throb of the cham-
 bers.

   Blaine watched his gauges with fev-
 erish eyes, while the Planeteers and
 their companions stood rigid, watch-
 ing

   "Almost voltage enough,” Blaine
 murmured hoarsely. “Almost—now!”

  He closed another switch. And
 then—

   Blackness! An utter darkness that
 enveloped them in a split-second of
 time, a rayless obscurity such as none
 of them had ever experienced before.

   Thorn looked up bewilderedly, to-
 ward where the sun should be blazing
 down through the ceiling-window.
 But there was no sunlight now—no
 light of any kind—nothing but black-
 ness.

   “Blaine, what's gone wrong?” he
 cried hoarsely. “This darkness—”
 “Nothing has gone wrong I” shrilled
 Philip Blaine’s thin voice triumphant-
 ly. “My neutralizes my great inven-
 tion, has succeeded! I knew it would
 if I had power enough!”

   “You mean that it’s this machine
 that has killed all the light here in the
 cavern?” John Thorn cried.

   “It’s done more than that!” Blaine
 exclaimed. “It’s killed all light every-
 where! I’ve blacked out the whole
 Solar System!”

   A babel of cries of terror rose from
 the throng in the cavern, above the
 thunderous throb and drone of the
 great machine.

   “Killed all light in the solar sys-
 tem?” Thorn gasped. “Impossible!”
 “The neutralizer has done it, I tell
 you!” Blaine shrilled exultantly.
 “It broadcasts a damping wave that
 neutralizes and kills all vibrations in
 the electro-magnetic spectrum from
 three to eight ten-thousandths of a
 millimeter in wave-length. That in-
 cludes the whole range of visible light,
 and the terrific power of this radite-
 powered generator casts its vibrations
 out over a radius of eight billion miles,
 embracing the whole Solar System.

   “There is not one ray of light now
 in the whole system, on any world,
 anywhere—neither sunlight or star-
 light nor artificial light of any kind.
 Every world and every mile of space
 in the system has been plunged into
 utter darkness. And it will remain in
 darkness as long as the neutralizer
 is kept on!”

   The stupefied Thorn felt Blaine
 shove something into his hand. It was
 a small pair of eye-lenses.

   “Put those on!” Blaine’s voice came
 in the darkness.

  John Thorn put the lenses over
his eyes. He cried out in amazement.
He could see, through the lenses, by a
dusky red light that seemed to perme-
ate everything. The sun blazed
crimson and weird in the heavens
above the glassite window.

  Sual Av and Gunner, and Lana and
old Stilicho were also staring wildly
up through the lenses the little physi-
cist had given them. Blaine himself
wore the lenses on his eyes.

  “You are seeing by light normally
invisible to your retinas, light above
the wave-length of ordinary light,”
Blaine told them. “The so-called in-
fra-red vibrations, which are unaf-
fected by my neutralizes and which
are made visible to your eyes by these
fluorescent lenses.”

  “But what good will blacking out
the whole solar system do the Alli-
ance navies?” Gunner Welk cried.
“The League fleet won’t be able to see
or maneuver, but neither will our
ships!”

  “The Alliance ships will be able to
see!” Blaine retorted. “Each Alli-
ance cruiser has been furnished with
a supply of these fluorescent lenses,
during the last year. They were giv-
en secretly to each cruiser’s captain,
without telling him anything except
he was to use them in case of sudden
darkness in space. They’ll use them
now, there off Mercury, and—”

  “And they’ll be able to see and to
overpower the blinded League ships
without a struggle!” Saul Av shouted.

  John Thorn’s heart bounded with
wild, new-born hope. He clutched
Lana feverishly to his side.

  “If it works!” he prayed. “If it only
works!”

  They gathered around Blaine’s au-
dio. Out of it, as the physicist turned
it on, came panic-stricken calls from
worlds plunged into absolute darkness,
from blinded populations.

  The whole system was seething in a
turmoil of mad fear. Crowds stum-
bling blindly through the darkness of
lightless streets were screaming that
the end of the universe had come.
Others were wailing that they had
been suddenly stricken with blindness.

  An hour passed. The tensity of the
group around the audio increased.

Appalling news of hysterical panic
was increasing.

  "This can’t go on!” Lana exclaimed
shakenly. “It’s destroying all civili-
zation in the system—”

  “Listen!” Thorn cried suddenly.
Out of the audio came a hoarse,
familiar voice—the voice of Richard
Hoskins, Chairman of Earth.

  “Blaine! Philip Blaine!” he was
calling. “This is the Chairman!
We’ve won! Commander Leigh has
just audioed me that his Alliance
forces off Mercury have captured the
whole League armada! Every League
ship, its men utterly blinded, was
forced to surrender under threat of
being destroyed by our own cruisers.

  “And I’ve called authorities on the
outer planets. They’ve agreed to de-
clare the war ended, to terminate
Trask’s rule and set up popular gov-
ernment again, and to dissolve the
League of Cold Worlds into four in-
dependent planets again!”

 “Trask himself is dead!” John
Thorn called back into the instru-
ment.

  “You Planeteers are safe?” cried the
Chairman’s voice. It throbbed with
emotion as he added, “I knew you
would bring the radite in time, Thorn.
I knew you would!”

  “Shall I turn off the neutralizer
now?” Philip Blaine asked, and the
answer came back swiftly.

  “Yes! Give the system light again,
Blaine!”

THE little physicist leaped to his
control-panel. His switches
clicked. The droning of the genera-

tors and the throbbing thunder of the
power-chambers died.

  And suddenly light blazed about
them! Not the dusky red infra-red
rays by which they had been seeing
through the lenses, but brilliant,
blessed sunlight pouring through the
window in the ceiling.

  “We’ve won!” Sual Av was shout-
ing, his ugly face wild with joy. “The
Alliance safe now—the menace of the
League gone forever!”

  “And that machine did it. That
thing in front of us did it!" whispered
Gunner Welk, incredulously staring.

  Lana’s blue eyes were shining as she
looked up at Thorn.

  “It means the realization of my
dream and my father’s dream, John.
A new independent world built up in
the Zone. You’ll help me build it?”

  He held her close, tears standing in
his eyes, unable to speak for the mo-
ment in the flood of his emotions.

  Then they all stared amazedly at
Philip Blaine, who had crumpled
down beneath his switch-panel with
his face buried in his hands. The lit-
tle physicist looked up shakenly at
them.

  “I hope I never have to use the neu-
tralizer to black out the system again!”
he said hoarsely. “I felt when it was
on that I was trespassing against the
command of the One who said, ‘Let
there be light!’ ”

        From Mercury lo Pluto,

       From Saturn back to Mars—

 LUSTILY the old song of the Com-
 panions of Space was roaring
 from hundreds of throats, resounding
 across the huge sunlit spaceport of
 great New York. Lana’s pirate fol-
 lowers, after being feasted and
 honored for weeks on Earth, were
 trooping out to their ships to follow
 their leader back to the Zone. And
 that roaring chorus that always be-
 fore had inspired dread was now
 greeted by a tremendous cheer from
 the vast throng gathered around the
 spaceport.

  At the edge of the spaceport stood

a little group—the Planeteers, Lana,
old Stilicho Keene, and the big space-
dog that pressed close to its mistress.
Facing them were Richard Hoskins,
Chairman of Earth, little Philip
Blaine, and grim-faced Commander
Leigh. Drawn up to one side were
solid ranks of gray-uniformed men of
the Earth Navy, an honor-guard of
many thousands.

  “I don’t know what to say to you
Planeteers," the Chairman told them
•jnsteadily. “You know what you’ve
done, the whole system knows, and
will never forget. But I wish you’d
stay here.”

  John Thorn smiled, his arm around
the slender waist of the pirate girl.

  “We’re goin^ to be needed out there
in the Zone, sir,” he answered. “It’s
not going to be so easy to bring law
and order to those wild asteroids, even
though you’ve caused all eight plants
to recognize the Zone as a ninth in-
dependent world.”

  “Curse me if I like this idea of me
sidin* with law and order after all
these years,” grumbled old Stilicho,
his wrinkled face dismayed. "All I
know is piracy, and—”

  “You’ll like it, Stilicho,” Lana told
him fondly. ‘‘We’ll need a strong
space-police to cover the whole Zone,
and it will take plenty of force to sub-
due some of the outlaw asteroids.”
“Plenty of fighting, ye say?” echoed
the old Martian. He spat rial juice
thoughtfully. “Well, maybe at that
it might—”

  “Every world in the system will
have only friendship for the Zone,”
the Chairman told them earnestly.
“Now that the League is gone forever,
and popular government restored on
the outer planets, I hope and pray that
interplanetary war is over forever.”
“And the scientific expedition to
Erebus?” John Thorn asked.

  “It rockets off next week,” the
Chairman said, a deep sadness in his
eyes. "It carries sufficient cyclotron
equipment to bring dissolution and
peaceful death to the doomed ones of
Erebus.”

  A hush fell upon them all. And then

the Chairman, his fine face working
with emotion, shook their hands in
farewell.

  Lana started to move away, but
Thorn checked her.

  “I've a wedding present for you,
Lana,” he said diffidently. “I had the
Chairman re-open the old case of your
father’s dismissal from the Earth
Navy. The investigation was impar-
tial, and showed that in fact Martin
Cain was unjustly cashiered from the
navy because of the conspiracy of a
jealous cabal.”

  Lana’s eyes widened startledly, and
clung to Thorn's.

  “John, you mean—”

  “Listen!” he said.

COMMANDER Leigh had turned
and was loudly reading a paper
to the solid gray ranks of naval offi-
cers and men.

  “Order of the Earth Naval Staff,
June fourteenth, Twenty-nine-fifty-
six: Martin Cain, deceased, is hereby
posthumously returned to full rank of
captain in the Earth Navy, and his
name is ordered inscribed at Head-
quarters on the roll of officers who
have served with honor.”

  Lana was crying. “My father’s name,
where he always longed for it to be.”
The sixty pirate ships were waiting.
They moved out to the Venture, and
Stilicho climbed inside. But they
were all surprised when Gunner Welk
drew back from the door.

  “I’m not going with you, John,” the
big Mercurian rumbled. “I didn’t
know how to tell you all before, but
this is good-by.”

  Thorn was startled. ‘‘Gunner, you’re
not going to separate from us now?
Not after you and Sual Av and I have
been so long together?”

  “What’s the matter that you want to
break us three up now, Gunner?” Sual
Av asked, his ugly face distressed.

  Gunner avoided their eyes. He
stared off into space with brooding
cold blue eyes, his massive counten-
ance queer.

  “You’re getting married and that
changes things,” he told Thorn. “It
can’t help but change things.”

 His voice deepened. "There were
three comrades frora different worlds,
and they raised a racket from Mercury
to Erebus in their time—three Plane-
teers who did some things that the
system won’t soon forget. But one of
them got married, and that was the
end of the Planeteers.”

  He shrugged heavily. "But I sup-
pose we had to split up some time.
Just because three fellows go through
hell together with a grin doesn’t mean
that they have to stay together after-
ward. I’m wishing you good luck,
John, and you, Sual.”

  Lana stepped forward, and looked
up with steady searching blue eyes
into the Mercurian’s massive, brood-
ing face.

  "Gunner, when we fought together
and spaced together, I did my part,
didn’t I?" she asked quietly.

  "Of course!” he rumbled. "I’d fight
the man who says you’re not the
staunchest, bravest girl in the sys-
tem.”

  "Then John and I marrying isn’t go-
ing to break up the Planeteers,” she
told him. “It’s going to give you an-
other comrade, that’s all. And all four
of us together won’t be too many for
the work of making a civilized world
out of the Zone.”

  Gunner stared at Lana, and slowly
his craggy face relaxed. He looked
from her to John Thorn.

  "Four of us together? And plenty
of trouble ahead? Then I stick!”

 He turned toward Sual Av, and
shoved the grinning Venusian toward
the door of the ship.

 "What the devil are you hanging
back for?” he rumbled. "Don’t you
know that we’re needed out in the
Zone—we Four Planeteers!"

Legal Reserve Insurance... No Medical
Examination

There is no reason now why any member of your family
should be without life insurance. One policy, costing
only $1.00 a month, can insure them all.

This amazing policy was created after our actuaries
found that if all members of the family were insured
in one policy’, we could save enough on policy costs,
clerical costs, mail, stamps, etc., to materially reduce
insurance costs. Further savings are made by eliminat-
ing agents who often get up to 50% of the premiums...
savings are also made by eliminating medical examina-
tion fees.

Anyone — Age 1-7S — May Apply

The hug* reserve of this strong, reliable company are alls'
invested In United Slate* Government Bonds, which are locked
in the vaults of the State of Illinois.
