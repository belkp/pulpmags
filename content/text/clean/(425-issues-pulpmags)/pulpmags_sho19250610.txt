Million Dollar Face

  The high-priced faces aren’t all in
  Hollywood. Would you take a
  million dollars for yours ?

   Until you start using Mennen Shav-
   ing Cream you won’t be treating that
   face of yours in a manner befitting its
   value. It has taken ten years to per-
   fect Mennen’s, but your skin will know
   the difference in three minutes.

   The razor blade will cut the whisk-
   ers as close as a Scotchman, and your
   face won’t realize it’s being shaved.
   That’s because Mennen dermutation
   (absolute beard softening) takes all the
   fight out of whiskers.

  If you’re addicted to the rub-in
  habit, or a secret slave of hot towels,
  Mennen’s will emancipate you. If you
  don’t make Mennen’s a life-long friend
  after a week’s use, the price of the tube
  is on me. 50 cents at druggists’.

   amp towels are dangerous hamper companions

for chiffon blockings

When delicate silks are put in a hamper with
the towels, sheets and colored cottons of the
weekly wash, they wear out long before they
have given the service you have reason to
expect of them.

  Why? Because, even though not obviously
soiled, they contain perspiration acids from the
skin, which are kept moist by the hamper damp-
ness and destroy the silk fibres.

  So, to preserve fragile garments and prolong the
  length of their service, many women have made it
  a habit to tub them in Ivory suds as soon as pos-
  sible after they are worn, whether they look
  soiled or not.

Tn this way acid action and the fading and
streaking that come from tossing such garments
into stuffy hampers are all prevented. All delicate
things reward this simple care with far longer life.

  Of course, a soap that is the
slightest bit too strong will
spoil your whole effort by in-
juring the fabrics and colors.

  Ivory (cake or flakes) is safe.

For, as you know, Ivory has

for 46 years protected the complexions of
millions of women.

  The best test we know of for determining
the safety of any soap for delicate silks and
woolens is this: Ask yourself, “Would I use it
on my face?”

How to 'wash blankets safely

Harsh soap, rubbing and extremes of tempera-
ture cause sensitive wool fibres to mat down,
shrink and become hard and scratchy.

  Keep blankets fluffy by squeezing lukewarm
Ivory Suds through the fabric, rinsing in luke-
warm water and airing well.

  The Ivory suds assures you of beautiful, safe
results and absolute cleanliness.

COMMON SENSE

HOLMAN DAY
PEAVY WORK - - - -
CLAY PERRY

 COMMON sense, horse sense, as we say,
 the practical view of life, is a fine and
 necessary thing. People who lack it have
 got to have a Tot of talent in various ways
 to get by in any degree without it. And
 yet, like many
 other good things,
 even common sense
 can be carried too
 far. It can be car-
 ried to the place
 where life loses all
 color and joy, it
 can be carried to
 the place where
 you make of your-
 self a machine do-
 ing an endless
 round of seemingly
 necessary things—
 and nothing else.

 That, of course, is
 not living. It is
 only existing, and
 the useful things
 you are doing are
 becoming your
 master.

   So it becomes
 necessary for us to
 know when the
 point of common
 sense has been
 reached and when
 a little un-common
 sense and exalta-

tation of the spirit is required. In an article
on another subject, Kathleen Norris, a
very wise woman as well as a talented
author, said, “You can carry common sense

 to the point where anything seems too much
 effort—nothing is really worth while.”

   To do that is to sign yourself into the
 bondage of things. It always seems to us
 that the people whose happiness rests on the

                        least secure foun-
                        dation are those
                        who are bound to
                        things; property,
                        houses, money
                        automobiles. If we
                        are to move for-
                        ward in the scale
                        of life, such people
                        say, shouldn’t one
                        have these conven-
                        iences, these pleas-
                        ant standards of
                        progress? Surely,
                        if you can afford
                        them, but not to be
                        an end in them-
                        selves, for then
                        they master you.

                         What end? Well,
                       that’s up to you
                       and your own cap-
                       abilities to see
                       what you can make
                       of yourself really.
                       A millionaire is
                       the saddest mess on
                       earth if he is just
                       a millionaire. His

 HUGWATER WALLIE

By CLEM YORE
Author of “Mac of the Tumbling K,” “A Son of th<e Circle,’’ etc.

CHUGWATER WALLIE AND THE MEN WHO HAD HIRED HIM FOR HIS DAN-
GEROUS WORK HAD THOUGHT HIS ADVENT INTO THE VALLEY WOULD
BE UNNOTICED. INSTEAD, HIS ARRIVAL WAS AWAITED, HIS WELCOME
WAS A BULLET. AND THAT BULLET WAS BUT A HINT OF WHAT
WAS TO COME BEFORE CHUGWATER COULD RIDE IN SAFETY AGAIN

LETTIE BUFORD had been asleep
on the window bench in the sit-
ting-room of the T Hanging
^Box when the drowsy murmur
of voices, coming through an
open window, aroused her. She heard the
late afternoon breeze stirring the tops of
the blue gums, caught the faintest tinkle of
running water from an irrigation ditch,
and listened langourously to the drone of
bees coming from the Virginia creeper
climbing the heaven-tree. Those voices,
they nettled her. Then she heard the rush
of a running horse, a sudden stop, a strain
of leather; the plomb of boots as they
struck the gravel of the ranch-house yard.
Sleep vanished.

  “Whence come you, caballero andante?”
She recognized the sneering voice of Luis
Perez, the foreman of the T Hanging Box,
which adjoined her father’s ranch, the K
Seven Quarter Circle, fifteen miles away.

  “Caballero andante!" the arrival repeat-
ed, and she caught the bitter hurt he hurled
in the repetition of the phrase meaning
“knight errant.” “I am a New Mexico
Mexican,” he shot,” and care nothing for
your high-blown talk. I am American by
birth. I vote. I belong to-”

  “You rode in fast!” Talk the same way,
Gringo !”

  Lettie was an adept at border Spanish.
The voices grew in excitement, then calmed
to a hum. She knew tidings of grave na-

ture had arrived. After a moment she
heard a complete speech.

  “I tell you he is on the way now. He
leaves the freight train at Querida and
comes here by horse. He is fine Por Dios!
But they say he rides like a god, and is as
handsome as a matador. If you move,
now, it must be now!”

  “Again, thou gnat! Tell me his name!”
“Chugwater Wallie, from Chugwater,
Wyoming. And he rides as a hireling to
the Cattlemen’s Association. We had it
from Fort Collins by wire, my brother and
myself. I have, as you know, two cousins
there in the sugar factory. They know
many things. And are sly as toads. Bu-
ford’s man talked, I wager that.”

  “He will ride from the railroad into this
valley? Is that so?”

  “Si, Luis Perez. Now, if all you want
is a few days, this is your chance. Buz-
zards cover a trail like nothing else.”
Lettie arose and went to the well, drew
a bucket of cool water and filled a pitcher;
on her return to the house she saw the men
who had been talking. They were Luis,
Max, and a swarthy Mexican she did not
know. A horse, lather covered, stood
chomping a bloody bit under a pepper tree.
She washed her face, tidied up her dress a
bit, and her hair, then strolled onto the ve-
randa. The talk of the Mexicans per-
plexed her. She did not like it. After a
while a woman came out of the house and
\

4	SHORT

said something to her in a low tone. She
hurried through the wide hall, across a
patio and into a room where a man of sixty
reclined on an elbow in a bed.

  “Lettie,” he said painfully, “I want to
thank you for the attention you have
shown to me. It’s been downright neigh-
borly. But Manuela and I have decided
you needn’t stay any longer, the fever’s
gone.”

  “Are you sure ?”

“There’s the thermometer; but I took
my temperature a moment ago. Ninety-
eight and a half—that’s what it read, even.”
“And the wound?” she asked, “does it
ache ?”

  ■’•“A-little, but when the cool of the eve-
ning comes I’ll get relief. Go, honey, your
dad must be worrying about you. Some
of the boys are coming up tonight, sure.”
“I’ll go then, Mr. Worley, for I know
father needs me.”

  At the door she turned back and said,
“I just heard Luis talking to a strange
Mexican, and they said something about a
rider the Cattlemen’s Association was send-
ing in here today. His name is Chugwater
Wallie. What do they mean?”

  The blood drained from the sick man’s
face.

  “They said that?”

  “Yes. And the black Mex insinuated
that buzzards are fine to hide a trail. I
don’t like that kind of talk in this valley,
Mr. Worley.”

  “You know Mexicans, my dear. Some
woman, I think, is at the bottom of that.
You understood the words they spoke to
mean Cattlemen’s Association ? Maybe
they were something else.”

  “Maybe,” she said and turned to leave.
At the door she looked back and smiled.
“I’ll come right back if you need me.
Don’t hesitate to send for me, will you?”
“Adios!” he replied. “Get Luis to hook
up your pony, and when he is done send
him to me.”

  As the girl clattered away Luis Perez
entered the room where the wounded man
lay.

  “Well ?” he said, a diabolical twinkle in
his eye.

  “When you talk, do it low! That girl
heard every damn’ word you said. Tell it,
quick! Spill everything, pronto!”

  And Luis repeated what his messenger
’lad conveyed to him.

“What’s on the tapis?” asked Worley.
“I’m riding our east fence, then down
through the Wagon Mound hills, across
the big pear-patch and laying there till this

STORIES

 baby comes along. He must never get into
 Engle.”

   “That’s right. Fly at it. What did you
tell the boys in town about my wound ?”
“You was hanging up a gun when it fell
and punctured your hip. Nobody’s seen a
thing. Nobody knows nothing.”

    “Slide out, you got to hurry to beat the
 sun to that pear!”

    “I’ll be there. I’m picking up a change
 of horses in our big ditch pasture. That
 Blue’s all right, now, huh?”

   “He’ll carry you. So long.”

   Luis opened the door, and almost
— knocked Manuela down. She was picking
some potatoes which had fallen from
her apron as he collided with her.

    Luis didn-’t like the look he saw in that
 kindly old face.

    “If ever you open that trap of yours,”
 he sneered in Spanish, “I’ll slit it for you!
 Did you hear ? Greasy snake!”

   “You mean about your two wives? I
 am from Valencia, these many years
 Ah, que! One cannot blame lovers!”

   He spat close to the hem of her dirty
 old dress.

   “Valencia! Where all the women are
 false and pretty! Where there’s a church,
 a long pavement, worn by the dirty feet of
 lying women, and a dead man.”

    She smiled.

   “Go,” she said. “What a temper you
 have!”

 CHUGWATER WALLIE dropped
 out of a caboose on a siding near
 Querida, and by the aid of the train
 crew worked a tall sorrel gelding down
 some bridge planks and out of the car in
 which it had been riding with a string of
 other horses. Quickly he threw his outfit
 on the animal atid jogged away from the
 railroad. When the train was nothing but
 a clot of dust, with a topknot of white at
 its fore which he knew to be the escaping
 steam from a safety valve, he pulled a pa-
 per from his shirt pocket and staring at it
 raised his eyes and searched the horizon.
 Grimly he smiled and put the sketch back
 in his shirt.

    “This is shore one easy country to map,”
 he mused. “If all them hills ain’t twins,
 then I'm Prohibition. I reckon all I kin
 do is keep a-ridin’ till I runs into some-
 thin’ that looks human, or maybe a string
 o’ wire. Come on, Hayburner, I’m crav-
 in’ distance.” The horse flecked an ear
 and increased its slow lope. Chugwater
 warbled a song, urged to music by a deep
 gnaw at the pit of his stomach.

I knows just why I’m achiri
’Cause I’m hank’rin’ after bacon
An’ a-cravin’ for a can of java, too;

  Now, beans, is what I means,

  Just a shovelful of beans,

Unless y’u got a yard o’ kidney stew.

Now come along, pie-trammer,

  These yere chaps is my pa jammer,

An’ I’m empty from the belly-band to heel.
  Just deal ’em off yore arm,

  Sling ’em slick, an’ sling ’em warm-

  “Oh! Oh, Hayburner, I seen it. too!”
he said, ending the ballad abruptly. A
flash of dust swirled in a tangle of heat
waves on the crest of a distant rise. It
lingered a fraction, then vanished. Chug-

water lost all
thought of
hunger.

  “I’ll bet he
turned that
b r o o m-tail
around on less
ground than

Jhis hat w’u’d
cover. In about
twenty minutes
I’m a-thinkin’,
I’ll shore be a-dreamin’ it’s the Fourth of
July.”

  He loosened the 30-30 carbine in the
saddle scabbard. Carefully he drew it
out, held it against the side of the horse,
and wrapping the lines around the pom-
mel tested the gun and saw that a shell was
in the chamber. As he rode he carried
the saddle-gun’s muzzle hooked in the top
of the stirrup taps and half concealed in
the flap of his Texas-wing chaparejos.

  Imperceptibly he guided his mount, by
knee pressure and body-leaning, in a gen-
tle curve away from the region where the
burst of dust had appeared.

  The same pace was maintained, however,
and the miles slipped gradually away. Of
a sudden the magic of the heated air un-
wound and he saw before him a vast field
of detestable vegetation. It looked like a
region of lost souls.

  “Hayburner,” he chuckled, “old Lara-
mie County never learned y’u nothin’ about
pear; but in fifteen minutes y’u better keep
them laigs o’ yores just so. Pear’s hell
on hosses; fool bosses.”

Pi-ing! Yzeee<e! A stab of pain!
Chugwater slumped in the saddle, threw
his body on the off side of the horse and
clutched desperately at the horn. With a
hidden heel he jammed a five point rowel
to

into his pony’s flank and the animal tore
forward at a desperate pace. His back
burned.

   “Now, boy,” he said, his face turned up
along the gelding’s neck, “do yore stuff.
When I quits y’u, shove on, I tells y’u, an’
shove on some mo’!”

  When a dense thicket of prickly-pear
was reached Wallie dropped clear of the
flying legs and rolled along the sand. His
rifle was thrown just as he fell, and a mo-
ment later was covered by his body which
lay huddled in a limp heap, the head partly
under an extended arm, the face buried
'in the sand, and the feet asprawl. Chug-
water’s left hand was hidden beneath his
chaps and in it he held a bone handled six-
gun.

  After a minute he heard the sound of
galloping hoofs, then the threshing of a
moving horse in the cactus.. The sound
came closer and closer, then ceased and was
replaced by the unmistakable crunch of
boots running in slipping soil. A hand
grasped at the neck of his shirt and he
was flung over on his back. From this
position he jerked his gun into the air and
fired. Then he rolled; rolled toward the
boots, now so close to his body. There
was another discharge, and he felt powder
sting along his neck. The figure above
him crumpled, a single-action Colt dropped
to the earth, and a Mexican doubled up
and buckled backward into a pear tree.
Chugwater emitted a long shrill whistle
and the gelding rushed to his side. Kick-
ing sand over the fallen Colt, he grabbed
his carbine, touched the horn of his sad-
dle, mounted on the run and disappeared.

  “Desert coyotes, Hayburner, an’ they
runs in pairs,” he cried as he bent low
down on the neck of his horse. “Le’s go,
old sweetie; we just gota go, now. They
burnt yore daddy!”

   Making the top of a small rise he looked
back and saw a fleeting horse dashing
toward the spot of his encounter. He
caught sight of a lurid shirt. It was blood
crimson with wide double line checks;
about the arms he thought he glimpsed blue
garters; but he was dead certain that the
hat was an El Stroud Stetson with a five
inch brim and a seven inch crown, and
around it was a diamond-design bead hat-
band.

   He flung a bullet ahead of the flying
horse as it entered the clump of cactus,
then flew into the vegetation before him.
At the end of thirty minutes he came out
on a loose gravelly floor which rose abrupt-
ly toward a greasewood slope.
6

SHORT STORIES

  Picking out one of two arroyos he rode
up it as fast as he could and reaching the
top hesitated long enough to take a look at
the paper in the shirt pocket. Then he
headed directly for a sugar-loaf hill, stuffed
the carbine in its boot and settled the geld-
ing to its long and accustomed stride.

  “If that ain’t a greetin’!” he mused.
“Somebody’s leaked. Somebody’s wised
up these centipedes. But I introduced my-
se’f, Hayburner. I an’ y’u, oldtimer, we
shore took our seats, right now. Didn’t
we!”

  His back burned and after a while it felt
sticky.

  “Ain’t I the doggonest old son of a gun,”
he said aloud, “I ain’t never goin’ to show
that on the Chugwater. Them hoss thieves
always w’u’d swear I was jack-rabbitin’ it
away, when I got that. Nope! I’ll change
my shirt out in the harness-shed, or I won’t
change it.”

  Shortly after nine o’clock he drew rein
at the K Seven Quarter Circle ranch and
shouted at the house. A door opened and
a middle-aged man stood in the light.
“Who is it?” he hailed.

  “Is this Mister Buford?”

  “Yes, sir.”

  “I’m gotta note to y’u! An’ if y’u don’t
mind I’d like for y’u to come on out yere
an’ loan me the loan of a shoulder. If I
tries to leave this saddle I’m goin’ to
bounce, shore.”

  The man in the door hurried across the
porch and assisted Chugwater from the
saddle. Slowly he limped into the house
where the first thing he saw was the face
of a girl, very white and very beautiful,
staring at him as he was helped into a chair.
“What is it, father?” she asked.

  "This gentleman is hurt, it seems. Now,
my boy, what can we do for you.”

  “Read that.” And Wallie brought out a
slim envelope and gave it to the ranchman.
Tearing it open Buford held out his hand.
“Chugwater,” he smiled, “I’m glad to know
you. And you’ve just arrived in time.

My brother’s direc-
tions were success-
ful?”

  “Ya’as, suh,” an-
swered Chugwater,
“I wasn’t expected
much neither, I
reckon. Or maybe
I was. Some hom-
bre made a right fine shot at me; I reckon
it must ’a’ bin a good three hundred yards,
an’ he burnt me, too.”

  “Why, he’s wounded, Dad!” cried the

girl. “Can’t you see that? Take off his
boots and let’s get him on the sofa while

I	run for some water and a first-aid!”

  “Don’t touch them boots, suh,” spoke
Wallie.

   “Why?” asked the girl.

  “That left one’s plumb full of blood.
Let’s ramble out on the porch an’ thay
won’t be no mess in yere.”

  The room whirled. The girl floated
away in a mist, the center of which was a
crazy lamp that revolved with a sickening
motion. Then a vast ringing came into his
ears and he settled limply in the chair.

  When next he opened his eyes the same
beautiful girl was seated by an open win-
dow beside the bed and she was fanning
the flies from his face.

   “Why, ma’am, it’s plumb day, ain’t it?”
were the first words he spoke.

   She jerked about in the chair and fixed
him with a curious look. “How do you
feel?” she asked.

  “Lordy!” he grinned. “Just like Santa
Claus done drove up an’ left me in the lap
of Old Lady Luxury. How’m I corn-
in’?”

  “Fine,” she answered. “You have lost
a great deal of blood, but the bullet passed
through the flesh along the shoulders. Dad
didn’t send for a doctor, for after we
looked at the wound he decided it wouldn’t
be necessary. Then he doesn’t want any
one to know you’re with us. He thought
that would be your desire, too.”

   “That’s right.”

   “I am Lettie Buford,” she said.

  “Daughter of the Colonel?” he re-
marked.

  “Un-huh,” she smiled, “but he isn’t a
colonel.”

  “Oh, ya’as’m he is! I’m from Kentuck,
an’ all them Bufords is Colonels, except
them as is Gen’rals. Y’u better not never
call one of ’em Captain. No, sir. My
gracious! I w’u’dn’t like to make such a
blunder.”

  “You are better,” she laughed. “After
what I know you went through, Chug-
water, I fancy you could call a man most
anything, if you felt like it.”

   “Shucks!” he replied in confusion. “If
ever y’u seen a fella leave a country, that
was me, when them boys began slammin’
lead at me. I an’ Hayburner shore took
no pity on that pear. An’ I wants y’u to
' know, Ma’am—Miss-”

   “Lettie,” she aided.

   “Lettie,” he went on, “that when I an’
that horse starts high-tailin’, why we leaves
town! I leaned ag’in’ that landscape down

                                                     10

there till I bet I bulged it wide.”

  “Are you hungry?” she asked.

  “Am I what? Say, Miss Lettie, if it
was raining rations, an’ I was standin’ in
a forty acre field, thay w’u’dn’t a blade o’
grass get hit by so much as a bean.”

  “Then I’ll get you some of the broth
from the stew we had dinner.”

  “Stew. What kinda stew?”

  “Irish stew. This is the seventeenth of
March!”

  “St. Paddy’s Day! Lord! Yestiddy, I
thought it was Independence Day an’ we
was givin’ the British hell. Never mind
the broth. Just bring in the stew—I'll get
the broth! I’ll just nacherly use that to
grease the stew with.”

  And that was how Chugwater Wallie
came to the K Seven Quarter Circle. While
Lettie was gone for the food he turned his
head and looked out of the window across
the fields of alfalfa, now growing green
and in blossom, close to the house. A calf
bawled down in a corral. A humming-
bird whisked like a veil across his vision
and fluttered for honey about the holly-
hocks. A mocking-bird warbled in low
rich minor from the top of a cotton-wood,
and a vagrant wind stole through the win-
dow and fanned his cheek.

  “This country is shore hell-for-pretty,”
he murmured, “an’ if I ever leaves it, why

I—I hope somebody romps on my neck!”

II

IN TWO weeks Chugwater was up and
around; in three he was sound as a
dollar and fretting to be at his work
—the breaking up or ferreting out of the
gang that was in charge of the entire coun-
ty, its outlawry, its politics. That was his
enterprise.

  His convalescence had been a dream to
him, a vision of the most exquisite loveli-
ness he had ever known.

  Lettie and he stood near the corral gate,
while Wallie rubbed down his gelding with
a currycomb and brush. After a while
the girl spoke. Her silence prior to this
had been formidable, and he fancied some-
thing grave was troubling her. Now as
she spoke, a quality in her voice made him
whirl and glance at her face.

  “You think a great deal of that sorrel,
don’t you ?” was what she said.

  “Oh, ya’as’m,” he answered, relieved.
“I bought him from a fella who was said
to be the wisest hoss trader in Wyomin’.
He said Hayburner oughta be worth ten
dollars of any man’s money; fifteen, if the
coin was stole. So I haggled a bit, an’
19

give him seven-fifty. He was wise, that
fella. Ya’as’m! If y’u pulled one of his
wisdom teeth y’u’d yank out a shoulder
bone.”

  “What made him under-rate the horse?”
“Well, he never seen the pony ’cept in
winter, when the snow was so deep y’u had
to use a pitchfork to find a haystack, an’
then all the range stock was as pore as
bees runnin’ on alkali water. An’ their
spirit was gone. Hayburner looked like a
Kansas preacher dealin’ Monte. But that
fella was a fool. Now, for me, gimme a
good man goin’ off half-cocked, sometimes;
a smart thief that looks it; a bang up,
twenty-four carat, six-day-a-week, stem-
windin hypocrite. But Lord, Miss Lettie,
deliver me from a damn’ fool! If ever a
white man took a cheatin’ it was that
scoundrel as sold me Hayburner.”

  Lettie was silenced by the outburst.
Chugwater thought he had offended by the
use of the expletive, damn. “I’m lurid,”
he smiled, “when I uses hoss-talk. Y’u
had oughtn’t let it, though, bother y’u none.
I’m quittin’ it, right soon.”

  She smiled. “I wasn’t thinkin’ of the
words, I was just forming an opinion.
Perhaps you are right about that kind of
fool you mentioned. I’m afraid daddy
comes under the classification.”

  “Now, shucks, Miss Lettie, I w’u’dn’t
let nary one but y’u talk thataway. What
y’u mean?”

  “The day you came to our house I was
nursing a neighbor rancher, and I heard a
Mexican tell his foreman, another Greas-
er, that Chugwater Wallie was to arrive by
way of Querida. Then Luis was told that
buzzards hid a trail. They said, and I’m
sure they knew, that the Cattlemen’s Asso-
ciation had employed you to ferret out the
members of the rustlers gang. I told
father and dad hasn’t done a. thing yet.
He isn’t afraid, but I don’t know what it
is. I think he hates to start a war. He’s
been through two.”

  “Is this Luis a ganglin’, long windin’,
stoop shouldered, blond Mexican?”

  “He’s tall and thin, yes. And is rather
light, with gray eyes.”

  “Does he wear fancy shirts an’ a classy
Stetson ?”

  “Yes.”

  “An’ was ary one of them other fellas
with the foreman tall, and a real black
Mexican—what I means is, black?”

  “Yes. I should judge he was five feet
eleven. The whites of his eyes showed
horribly. His face was like a negro’s.”
“Y’u’ve shore classified him—sound to

go, without a blemish to sell, and his notch-
es all even up. Miss Lettie, them was the
birds what started to burn me out the
country.”

  “I thought so,” she answered, “but
father rather figured it was the gang from
across the Rio Grande. But you would
know them again if you saw either of them,
wouldn’t you ?”

  “Know ’em ? Why if I was froze up in
hell, I’d grade both of ’em through forty
feet of red hot ice. An’ when I see ’em,
I’m goin’ to give ’em hell-an’-repeat, an’
y’u needn’t guess twice about that, neither.
Who’s that cornin’ down the road ?”

  “Father,” cried the girl, and hurried
toward the house.

  Buford ran his pony into the yard and
yelled for Chugwater. And when the
young rider had put away his horse the
two men and the girl went into the living
room where the elder man spoke swiftly.

  “My boy,” he said, his voice quavering,
“there is trouble abroad now. And it’s
open warfare on this range, I’m afraid.
Last night the five horse thieves we had in
the county jail escaped. Do you know
what that means ?”

  “I reckon they’re dustin’ landscape,
now.”

  “It means that some man in authority
allowed them to go free, gave them the
saws to break jail. And then went away
from the court house while they did it.
They are headed for the country west of
Hot Springs, up, in and around, the old
Nigger-diggings.”

  “Who were they, suh ?”

  “Buck Tilley, he’s the leader; the Hot
Tamale Kid, a half-breed Mexican and
Apache; One-Eye John, a large Norweg-
ian ; Big Foot Alec and Abilene Al. Here’s
a description of them all. And a photo re-
production of their faces.”

  Chugwater studied the reward notice for
a few moments.

  “I reckon I kin keep this,” he said.
“When 1 was a kid I knew this Abilene
Al. He useter be a railroad cop for the
U. P. at Cheyenne an’ he was strict. Why,
he’d run y’u two miles if he smelt whisky
on yore breath. First thing I heard he’d
stole a whole carload of beef cattle. Drove

’em out of a car that had been shunted into
a sidin’ for feed. But he don’t know me.
If Miss Lettie will sling me up a little
grub, an’ y’u’ll dig me up a light bed roll,
I’ll be slantin’ out.”

  “Where?” asked Lettie.
“Nigger-diggin’s,” replied Wallie. “If
anybody asks y’u where I’m gone tell ’em
any place but west. If Hayburner is still
handy with his feet, I figgers on bein’
pretty thick with Buck Tilley right soon.”
“That’s death, boy!” exclaimed Buford.
“I took a job, an’ I’ve earned three
weeks’ pay lookin’ at Miss Lettie wrangle
me my feed. Now it’s time I was shovin’
011. The way I got this yere thing fig-
gered is this. This Luis an’ his boss is in
with this gang; they’re the only ones what
saw me. Not a man in the Association
ever laid a eye on me except y’u. I’m just
as liable to travel in a straight line in this
country without gettin’ graded as anybody
I know. But I want y’u to do something.”
“Anything we can,” responded the
rancher.

  “Find out then what become of the fel-
low I dropped in the pear; an’ if Luis or
his boss, or any of them fellas what seen
me, goes across the Rio Grande, an’ y’u
finds it out, send somebody to the bridge
an’ tie a white cloth or something on the
steel struts on the north side. I done stud-
ied the west end of this country an’ I got
a map with me now. I reckon the Dig-
gin’s ain’t more’n seven mile from the
bridge, is it?”

  “A little less. But what will this mean
to you?”

  “That I’ll be done over yonder. I’ll
make it a point to stick close to that river-
crossin’. Don’t forget, somethin’ white on
the north side on any of the struts.”

  “The boys are coming home. Daddy,”
announced Lettie, looking from the win-
dow. “Gracious, I didn’t expect them for
another week.”

  “Yore men, suh?” asked Chugwater.
“Yes, they’ve been hunting strays, mend-
ing fence and branding. They left here
the day before you arrived.”

   ‘‘Is they all right ?”

  “As far as I know.”

  Lettie left the room to get food for Wal-

lie while Buford sought a bed roll, and just
as Chugwater was ready to ride away
ten K Seven Quarter Circle boys rode into
the yard.

  Chugwater pulled down his hat, humped
a shoulder and was edging around the grain
shed with his horse when a pair of gray
eyes caught and held his. He recognized
that face, knew it at a glance. It belonged
to Sandy Stuart, a man with whom Wallie
had quarreled in the Brown’s Hole country
of Colorado. There was malevolence of a
violent character in the glance Stuart gave
Wallie and the look stayed with him until
the ranch-house was lost to sight. That
night he camped on a high flat among the
pinon-pine.

  The following morning as he ishook
some coffee out of a small bag into his
stew pan, a piece of paper caught his eye
coming out of the sack. He literally
grabbed it and read a few lines written in
pencil.

  Please don’t take too many chances.
  And depend on it if zee find you
  have been traced we will get the
  signal to you. I will ride, myself,
  and place it on the bridge. Remember
  what you told me about a d— fool.
  And come back to the Ky—soon.

                                  L.

  “Doggone!’ he ejaculated, and read the
note again. His horse was hobbled near-
by and cropping the grass beneath a small
tree. “Hayburner,” yelled Wallie; the
horse raised its head. “Boy. if I felt any
better I’d have a runaway. Come yere!”
The sorrel hobbled over to the little fire.
Chugwater put an arm around its neck,
then loosened the gunny-sack hobbles.
“Does y’u know, sweetie, that I’m just that
larrupin’ fine that I’ll be feedin’ the but-
terflies all this day; an’ I’ll bet right this
minute I c’u’d fall five hundred feet with-
out dirtyin’ a shirt. Dern y’u, didn’t I
learn y’u to eat oats ? Then lissen !” Hay-
burner rubbed his cheek against Wallie’s
shoulder. “Quit that! Hear me! In my
haid thay’s somethin’ that’s millin’ to beat
hell an’ is tryin’ to bed-down. Don’t look
at me like that! If y’lt kin understand talk,
then hear me. One look at that Lettie
girl w’u’d make a Panhandle onion taste
like a peach. If I thought—but Lord! If
I keeps thinkin’ them fool thoughts I’ll be-
lieve my mother wasted milk on me as a
kid. Besides, if I study about that much,
an’ it don’t grow hay, why I’d cave in like
a wind-house. Go on now an’ eat. Soon’s
10

I get this java brewed, I’ll drink to her an’
y’u, honey, to her an’ y’u.”

  Hayburner strolled away and after a
few minutes raised his head. Chugwater
stood before the fire, a steaming can of
coffee held beneath his lips.

  “Here’s mud in yore eye,” he said.

  After breakfast Wallie packed up and
rode away.

  And that night he camped on the west
side of the Rio Grande. He noted, as he
crossed the river on the bridge, that the
water was roily and that the spring freshets
in southern Colorado were being carried
swiftly to the Gulf. Soon that stream would

be a raging torrent. In this event the only
passage in a hundred miles would be the
very bridge on which he stood. No man
could ford that dirty rushing current which
now, at quarter flood, looked murderous in
its seething beds of sucking whirlpools.

  He built a roaring fire, directly, on the
highest point of a steep pine ridge, and sat
beside it smiling vacantly and staring into
the flames. Soon he heard Hayburner
emit a loud snort. Wallie knew what that
meant. A human being was coming up
the slope. Out of the pines a voice hurtled.
“Stay squintin’ just like y’u is.”

  “Come on!” yelled Chugwater. “I don’t
know what y’u’ll do, but I shore know
what y’u is.”

  A man’s laugh broke the stillness.
“Well,” a voice cried, “he ain’t no bum-
bola, anyhow. Put down the gun an’ let’s
all slant a eye over him.”

   Five figures circled the fire.

  “Howdy,” greeted Wallie, “shall I move
over or kin y’u boys find plenty room on
this rim-rock?”

  “Where y’u from?” asked a vicious look-
ing man whom Chugwater recognized,
from the reward notice he had studied, as
Buck Tilley.

“If I was to tell y’u all them things the
first thing I knew y’u’d be gettin’ my mail.”
“We seen that road-eater of yours corn-
in’ down from the San Jacinto-way, late
this afternoon.”

  “Yep, we was.”

  “Been to San Felipe, too?”
IO

SHORT STORIES

  “Yep.”

  One of the men jumped back. He was
the half-breed, the Hot Tamale Kid.

  “Let him alone. Thay’s small pox at
Felipe!” he cried. “I gotta enough. Give
him orders an’ let’s get goin’!”

  “I circled that air town,” said Wallie.
“I jams into a fella afore I gits to that sin-
hole an’ he was as white as a tombstone
runnin’ ag’in’ the country. I says, ‘what’s
wrong, podner?’ ‘Small pox!’ he says,
‘they’s dyin’ like rats. Black small-pox.’
An’ he was gone! All I seen of him was
his old fryin’ pan puttin’ four feet up and
four feet down an’ leavin’ twenty feet in
between.”

  Buck Tilley sat down.

  “When didja leave Wyomin’?” he asked.
“Round about thirty days ago, maybe.”
“Borrowed something before y’u quit?”
“Say, if y’u is the law, I’d like right well
to look at yore jail. I’ve inspected an’
condemned mo’ jails than most anybody I
know. If y’u hombres is the law, all I
kin say is nobody pays taxes down yere.”
Buck locked his fingers around a knee
and tilted backward, swaying to and fro
and scrutinizing Chugwater’s features.

  Up to that instant Wallie had refrained
from glancing at the other members of the
band, but as Tilley fixed his eyes upon him
he estimated th6 faces of the other men;
just at the end of the circle he saw Abi-
lene Al. He looked boldly into the face of
the man and laughed aloud.

  “I got y’u placed, anyhow,” he said.

  Al moved toward him.

  “Meanin’ which?”

  “The last time I seen y’u I was slippin’
down between a string of empties in the
yards at Cheyenne an’ y’u was wearin’ a
pie plate on yore bosom as would dazzle a
headlight.”

  Tilley laughed.

  “Didn’t I tellya, Al. I kin spot these
fancy guys as far as sand shows. This
kid’s broke an’ lookin’ for some place to
lay out a lotta police gossip. Am I right ?”
“Deal me a hand,” remarked Chugwater
casually. “All I’ve got off this country
for the past ten days is a big bundle of
laughs.”

  “Kin y’u ride?”

  “Y’u’re a cow-hand or y’u w’u’dn’t be
eatin’ yore neighbor’s beef.”

  “Rope?”

“With both hands. All the way to a
sixty-five foot piece of twine. An’ I kin
build ’em an’ braid ’em, too—Injun raw-
hide, silk-manila, or Monterey maguay.”
“Are y’u known in Engle?”

  “Hell, no! All I understands about that
town is that it’s got four wheels an’ no
brakes. Ain’t thay a place there called
the Cow Daddie saloon ?”

  Several of the men glanced at Buck.
“Yep,” he answered, “the sheriff of this
county runs it.”

  “That’s the place. A friend of mine
from over on the Sweetwater was down
there two year ago an’ he said the boys
rode in one door, took a drink, an’ rode
out the other. If a fellow got down off
his horse to drink he c’u’dn’t get back on
ag’in.”

  Everybody laughed.

  “Come on, Kid,” said Tilley genially,
“let’s all of us be gettin’ up to our lay-out.
Y’u’re shore in among Christians now.
An’ if y’u knows a good fast game when
y’u sees one, right here’s where y’u can
get a change of shirt entirely to yore lik-
in\ We’ll tell y’u somethin’ when we get
the whole crowd in one room.”

  “Let’s go,” remarked Chugwater. “I’m
shore tired of sleepin’ in this San Antonio
duck.”

  And while Hayburner was being sad-
dled the men stood off and admired him
by the light of the fire.

  “That’s a plumb road hoss, boy,” com-
mented Buck Tilley.

  “Yep. The hombre don’t live that kin
fork a hoss an’ camp alongside me an’ this
baby, night in an’ night out, if we don’t like
the way he makes pancakes. I got him
off a fella in Wyoming for a little less’n
six bits. An’ I’ll bet he thinks creation
done played him for a white chip ever
since.”

  “Y’u’ll need just such of a pony. I aims
to run y’u ragged between here an’ Engle.
At least till election time.”

  Wallie swung himself into the saddle
and followed Tilley.

  “Hey, chief,” jibed Chugwater as the
men reached their horses, “I’m right anx-
ious to know how y’u placed me as from
Wyomin’. How come?”

  “I knew that little old Cheyenne saddle.
The roll in the seat looks like a bee stung
it. I’d just as soon be in the middle of thg
Atlantic in a rowboat as sittin’ a livin’ hoss
in a stingy thing like that.”

  Chugwater felt relieved.

  “Huh,” he laughed, “if I rode a bear-
trap like that thing y’u got I’d have cal-
louses on my knee-caps. But I’ll bust a
thirteen hundred pound sacred-cow, bawl-
in’ it for the fields of Satan, with this slick
rollin’ pin, an’ y’u won’t see no fork come
out of her, neither.”

  “That’s why I knew y’u was a rider an’
a roper,” said Buck. “Have a town boy
cigarette ?”

  Wallie took a smoke, lit a match and
leaned from his saddle. He cupped his
hands over the light, and Tilley bent his
head and started his cigarette. In that
swift and fleeting action Chugwater had
glimpsed the features and poise of the ban-
dit leader and for the rest of the journey
to the rendezvous he had no fears. Buck
did not suspicion his identity.

IF CHUGWATER had been loquacious
upon meeting the captain of the gang
he was surely cured of the excess
when he found himself seated among the

member-
ship. This was
made up of
twenty of the
hardest counte-
nances and
toughest fig-
ures he h a d
seen in many
a day. He met
them all; met
them with an
iron grip in his fingers, a chill repulsion in
his greeting, and a stolidity of demeanor
which carried away all antagonism to him.
Yet he knew he was on trial.

  He drank sparingly, often not at all, of
the jug which went around the room from
time to time. Narratives were spun,
reminiscences told of old episodes on many
frontiers of the cow-country. Wallie
seemed an interested, a charmed listener.

  “Well, how does she lay, boys?” said
Buck, after an hour or more of casual con-
versation. “What’s yore likin’? Does he
stay an’ throw in with us. or shall we give,
him a fresh horse an’ guide him up in the
Black Range.”

  “I’d like to see him lay a loop on some
beefsteak,” commented the Hot Tamale
Kid. “I’m shore stuck on him the way he
sits down.”

  “That’s me, too,” added One-Eye John.
“Un-huh,” muttered a third. Others
nodded. Then Buck summed up.

  “Kid, tomorrow we’ll send y’u out to
bring us in some meat. An’ we'll tell y’u
just where to get it. Two of the boys will
go along leadin’ a coupla packhosses. If
y’u brings down the cow we wants, where
we wants it, then I reckon I’ll send y’u into
Engle to nose around. In the meantime,
what’s yore name?”

  “They calls me Criss Cross, most places,
    te

but that’s not the name my mother give me.
I reckon y’u ain’t interested in them
things ?”

  “Criss Cross is good enough, if y’u kin
do it. Now, let’s bed down. One of them
boys, Tamale will do, will show y’u whert
to flop. Big Foot, it’s yore night on the
dog-watch, go out an’ let Snaky come in.

  Big Foot left the room and the band
sought various cabins where they tumbled
into bunks arranged along walls. Chug-
water was given a bed above the Hot Ta-
male Kid.

  Just before he went to sleep he leaned
out of his blankets and said to Wallie, “I’m
shore glad y’u didn’t hesitate in Felipe.
God, I’m nigger-skeered of black small
pox. I’ve seen it rage; an’, man, thav
ain’t nothin’ kin break its strangle-hold on
death once it hits y’u. An’ carry? Say,
it’s worse’n musk on a Mex woman for
spreadin’ over a country.”

  “I’m afeared of it, too,” replied Wallie
with a yawn.

  But in his mind a thought was revolving.
It made him smile. Then he remembered
the note from Lettie which he had hidden
in the band of his Stetson. He reached
to the peg on which the sombrero hung
and quietly removed it and laid it in a cor-
ner beside his head. Then he nestled into
the covers and went to sleep.

Ill

THE next day, accompanied by two
members of the band, he made an
excursion into the hills to the south
and toward noon came upon a stragglin ;
herd of fine white faced cattle. Here after
some maneuvering he roped a yearling
steer, threw it, and hog tying it, cut its
throat. Quickly the three men cased it out
and dressed it and then cut it up into con-
venient pieces for packing, and after load-
ing the pack animals started for camp.

  During the process of skinning Chug-
water managed to cut the hide in such
manner that he left the unhealed brand
burn on a hind quarter; this he read as the
Reverse B. L. And on the way home,
while he was following his companions
with one of the packhorses, he loosened a
knot in the basket-hitch which the thief had
employed to pack the beef on the horse,
and after a few hundred yards the load fell
and dragged along the ground.

  “Hey!” he shouted, “which one of y’u
fellers done this job? Better come back
an’ let me learn y’u how to braid one of
these lousy squaw hitches. Never mind,”
he added as one of the men started toward
12

SHORT STORIES

him, “I was just a foolin’. I’ll yank her
up in a jiffy an’ be with y’u soon.”

  The men continued on their way.
Quickly Wallie removed the hide con-
taining the brand and jammed it deep in a
saddle-bag, then threw a single-diamond on
the meat and hurried ahead. They reached,
camp toward late afternoon where the re-
mainder of the band stood watching them
approach.

  “He’ll do,” shouted one of those with
Chugwater, “he shore ain’t a stranger to
that kinda toil. An’ when y’u sink a tooth
in this sirloin y’u’ll imagine he’s a right
good judge of eatin’ meat.”

  Buck was visibly pleased and after the
animals had been unsaddled and the meat
carried to the kitchen, Tilley told Wallie
he wanted him to take charge of the cows
the band had hidden in the hills.

  “We got an election on yere soon, kid,”
he said, “an’ it’s us kind of hombres ag’in’
the law an’ order bunch. I’m workin’ in
with some of them fellas on the other side
of the Rio Grande, such as Worley, Tuck-
er, Moorhead, Ashton, Billings an’ others.
Y’u see I’m edgin’ y’u in right deep; spill-
in’ it all now, so’s y’u kin see where we’re
at. Pecos Willie Wainright, who runs the
Cow Daddie Saloon in Engle an’ is sheriff
of this county, is takin’ orders from them
ranchers over there who are tryin’ to run
some of these other guys like Buford an’
the Association men, out of the county.
We does the dirty work an’ is allowed to
get a few cows out of the country for doin’
it.”

  “Why, that’s as handy as a pocket in a
shirt,” expressed Chugwater. “Seems like
top an’ bottom dealin’ to me. Where kin
y’u lose ?”

  “We come dern near it, a while ago.
Five of us got caught drivin’ two hundred
calves up Sausalito way. I just bin outa
jail a short time. Pecos Willie give us a
box of hack saws an’ we went. Buford
was the fella what done it. Brought spe-
cial men from the Governor’s office an’
they high-tailed an’ got us. Now what
we’re after is to elect Pecos an’ Judge
Moss. With them two, an’ a few cases
of right good rustlin’, I’m a-thinkin’ Bu-
ford will quit buckin’ us an’ sell. If he
don’t, then one of us will have to put him
away.”

  “Where do I come in ?”

  “I’m expectin’ a Greaser in from San
Marcial any day now, and when he comes
he’ll have the names of three hundred vot-
ers which we wants registered. Y’u takes
these to Pecos an’ he gets the county clerk

to stick ’em on the books of about eight
votin’ districts on the other side of the
river. With them three hundred we’ve
got ’em beat. We only lack two hundred
now. That’s the important thing this
minute, that an’ gettin’ news from Pecos
Willie. But in the mornin’ I want y’u to
ride up an’ look over the bunch of critters
we’ve got up on some high pasture. An’
maybe I’ll have y’u take over the feedin’
end of ’em. I want ’em able to walk to
the railroad, anyhow.”

  “I c’n do that. Maybe y’u better have
some wagons bring in a little feed.”

  “What ever y’u say.”

  And the next day Wallie saw the cows.
They were first class range cattle and in
extraordinary condition. All of them had
passed through the operation of brand-
blotting, the burns of which were almost
healed. He counted in the neighborhood
of three hundred head.

  A week went by. A week of thrilling
excitement for the young puncher, every
evening of which he strolled to a high
knoll above the headquarters and looked
at the bridge over the Rio Grande. No
white signal met his eye. At any event his
presence in that end of the county had not
been suspected by Luis or Worley.

  To hasten the healing of the altered
brands he had applied axle grease to the
sores, and many of the animals were now
singularly in condition to pass any inspec-
tion. The work had been done well; the
old method of a wet gunnysack and a me-
dium hot iron had accomplished the alter-
ation. And then one day-

  Carrying a bucket of the grease into the
single cabin where the and the Tamale Kid
now slept, which was a little apart from
the other houses, a curious expression!
wreathed Wallie’s face. It had seemed to
him as though the repulsive mass of
splotchy-colored lubricant in the bucket
had conveyed to him a startling thought.
“Doggone,” he mused, “I shore think it

will work.
But maybe
thay won’t be
no call. Here
goes just the
same.”

 He took a
handful of the
sticky stuff and
moulded it into
the chinking of
the logs in a
dark corner of the room.

  “If I wants y’u, there y’u is,” he thought.

                                                     to

Then he heard a hurrying of hoofs coming
up the slope and saw a Mexican rider dash-
ing into sight from the west.

  “Huh,” he thought, “I bets four dollars
I’m headed toward Engle in the mawnin’.”
And sure enough he was. The messen-
ger arrived with the list of names to be
registered and Chugwater set out early for
the county seat. Toward noon he began
to see horizon formation which he knew
outlined the ranch of Buford. In a slowly
converging half circle he wound toward
the boundary of the K Seven Quarter
Circle. And as he rode, daring and aston-
ishingly singular ideas filled his racing
mind. What if he could stop that election?
Then what? Would it serve his purpose?
Wouldn’t Wainright, M or ley and the rest
of the conspirators still be in the same rela-
tive position? What would his testimony
be? He had received a list of names from
a fugitive of justice? He had been a mem-
ber of that band ? That wasn’t evidence!
No! Those names must be entered.
Then crashing through him went a plot
and a plan that set his blood tingling, and
over and over it revolved in his mind and
stood the test of every assault he made
upon it.

  Buford had influence at Santa Fe. Fine!
Great!

  Maybe he could get the governor to ask
the United States Department of Agri-
culture to send some men down. That
was the scheme. If he could do just that.
Get the names on the election books and
get something from Pecos Willie to prove
that he had delivered them to him person-
ally. Chugwater went suddenly hot and
cold. Assurance came upon him with the
same lassitude with which failure would
have smote him. A silly sort of smile
twisted his face into a boyish grin. He
thought of Lettie. It was confusion !

  “Yep,” he mused, “I gotta lay out in the
hills long enough to let the sun go down,
then slide in an’ see her an’ her dad. Oh!
Oh, Chugwater! Y’u knows damn’ well
y’u ain’t a-thinkin’ a thing about her old
daddy. Ain’t y’u the snake-twistin’est
sneaky devil what is? Now ain’t y’u?”
Hayburner cocked an ear at a strange
note in his master’s song, then forgot about
the rich baritone. For in the distance he
had caught the sight of another horse. It
was winding slowly in and out of the cool
scrub-timber high up in the hills.

  Wallie sang on.

What will y’u be when the round-up’s
  done?

   10

   Cowboy?

Where will y’u be when they ring the bell?
An’ what are the tales y’u then xvill tell?
Will y’u be a bronc on the range of Hell?
Cowboy, oh Cowboy!

I likes the cut of yore sunburned jaw,
    Cozvboy!

An’ doff my hat to yore code an’ law,
Y’u’re the whitest man I ever saw,

An I’m plumb delighted to share yore paw,
    Cozvboy, oh Cowboy!

  “Whatcha see, honey?” he remarked to
his sorrel, trying to pierce the plain be-
fore him for the object that had caught the
attention of Hayburner. Then he made it
out, a pinto pony winding along the west
slope of the far hills that marked the west-
ern line of the K Seven Quarter Circle.

  A recognition went booming through
him.

  “Come on, Hayburner, lay down them
feet. An’ take yore time; but if y’u takes
too much of the same, watch yore step.
Daddy’s in no mood for dee-lay. Y’u
knows who that is, don’t y’u ?” The horse
literally raced over the earth. It, too, had
felt the contagion of that moment. Then
a marvelous thing happened. The pinto
stopped, faced into the west; and from the
shrapnel like puffs of dust which arose
from the slope of the hills down which it
traveled, Chugwater knew that the paint-
horse was coming with a sliding and slip-
ping down that abrupt decline. He felt a
tightening of his throat muscles. “Dog-
gone that pinto!” he ejaculated. “If he
tangles them feet an’ so much as busts her
nose, I’ll whup him, I’ll whup him-”

  But the pinto came on. It flashed in
beautiful style away from the steep hill-
side and out across the level greasewood
and mesquite plain.

  “Lady Lettie,” he exclaimed, rising stiff-
legged in the stirrups, “I shore mighta
known that no Buford ever lived what
c’u’dn’t ride a hoss. Lord! Ain’t that a
sight, Hayburner? I’d rather see that gal
forkin’ a hoss than see Lord Dunraven’s
yacht race; yes, or hear old Pat Gilmore’s
band. Shucks, Chugwater, an’ y’u bin
dreamin’ about her! Say, y’u ain’t in her
class. Slie’s Princess-bred an’ y’u, why,
y’u—y’u belongs to the Poverty Aristocra-
cy ; an’ y’u cain’t even talk her language—
never learned no grammar at all.”

  Then he saw her, and waved his hat in
wide circles about his head. They came
together with a rush and she reined in the
spirited pony to a perfect stop. At the
14

SHORT STORIES

same time her flushed cheeks, loosened
hair falling about her face, her eyes aflame
and laughing lips sent a sensation to his
heart that thrilled him utterly. She reached
from her saddle and caught his hand. The
touch of her palm was like a caress.

  “Oh, I’m glad, I’m glad!” she cried.

  “Me, too, Miss Lettie, I’m shore pleased
to see you.”

  “I’ve—Dad and I have worried ourselves
sick over you. We made up our minds
last night that one of us would ride to the
river and hang that signal just to watch
and see if you were alive. What have you
been doing?”

  “Stealin’ cows an’ healin’ brand-burns.
Now I’m goin’ into Engle to talk with
Pecos Willie Wainright. If y’u is want-
in’ me, for the next two days, my address
is the Cow Daddie Sayloon.”

  She literally guffawed as she turned her
horse around. Then they started off to-
gether. Occasionally she caught a strange
furtive glance in Wallie’s eyes. It was
one of appraisal; filled with admiration,
and something else. She did not know
what it was but it intrigued her greatly and
caused small spasms of joy to lift up from
her throat.

  She listened to the narrative of his*ad-
ventures and seemed to think his recital
humorous, for at frequent intervals she
burst into silvery laughter. When he had
told all, she gushed into words.

  “Really, Chugwater, I think it is the most
ridiculous story I ever heard. The idea
that you were able to get in with those
men! The way you planned it, by build-
ing that large fire on the ridge, so that
they would be sure to find you; the steal-
ing of that Reverse B. L. yearling. I
think it is great; dad will be tickled to hear
that. Let’s hurry!”

  “But, Miss Lettie, I reckon y’u don’t get
me quite yet. I ain’t goin’ in to yore place.
I’m goin’ to Engle.”

  “Absolutely not! You have the evi-
dence in that list. You know where those
men are. And now we’ll get our side to-
gether and end this thing.”

  “Not a bit. To do what y’u wants
means blood an’ a lot of it. Why them
boys lay up in them hills an’ they’s got
glasses which makes a lizard, ten miles
away, look like a alligator. They’d see
y’u before y’u got within five miles of the
river. Nope, Miss, I’m playin’ solo on
this game an’ I’m headin’ back to Buck
Tilley’s gang day after tomorrow.”

  She became silent. She looked away
toward the sun scorched plain out of which

Chugwater had ridden. Then after a while
she said, and her voice was tremulously

serious, “Do you
know that you’re
notb ing but a
boy; a big clean
minded boy with
a lot of cock-
sureness about
you ? Do you
know that?”
“Ya’as’m, I’m
stuck up.”

  “I didn’t mean
that. I meant that it is your youth and
your supreme contempt for danger that
makes you think you can play this game
alone. Why, Wallie,”—It was the first
time she had ever employed such a tone
toward him, and he caught the infection of
her mood—“those men would kill you like
they would a snake if they even suspected
who you were. Take charge of the posse,
if you will; get into the fight that must
come; but don’t go back there single-
handed any more. I’m a ranch girl, born
and bred on this land, and I know all the
things that make a man do what you are
doing. But don’t go back. Please!”

  She saw him avoid her pleading eyes.
She saw his strong face fall into hard grim
lines and then his lips drew in and she
knew that his jaws had set. Despair
clutched at her heart. She realized that
he had reached an unalterable decision
which no word of hers could change. At
last he said.

  “Miss Lettie, I’m right proud to feel the
interest y’u’re takin’ in me.”

  “Interest!” she exclaimed. “Why it’s
more than that. It’s the regard, the friend-
ship, that sprang up during the days you
were sick. Don’t I know what you suf-
fered? And didn’t I see how game you
were? Didn’t I see the light in your eye
when you rode away around that grain-
shed ? It was desperate, that’s what it
was, desperate gratitude. You think I did
something that helped you get well.”

  “Y’u did, Ma’am.”

  “Don’t you ‘ma’am’ me. You big blind
—” a sob was precious close to her throat
at that instant. “I’m a friend of yours.
I’m almost as old as you are. And I’m
Lettie, to all my friends.”

  “Thanks,” he said, “I like that, Lettie.
Seems like Kentucky mountain folks, when
y’u Bufords takes up with a runt like me.
It shore does. Y’u never will know, girl,
how much y’u tickled me by puttin’ that
note in the coffee.”

  The anxiety fled from her features.

  “I’ll bet you thought it mighty funny.”
she said.

  “I’ll bet I thought it mighty sweet! Hay-
bumer figured I was a bit teched by the
sun. I read the thing eighty-two times
between them pinon hills an’ the slope this
side of the Rio Grande. Looka yere, Let-
tie.” He pulled off his hat and exposed
her note under its band.

  “You foolish thing,” she flouted, “throw
that away. It might be the very cause of

your death. If they found that-”

  “Throw it away? Say. wild horses
c'u’dn’t yank that from me. No, nor all
the Yankee cavalry. Y’u kin believe it or
not, but this yere paper is the first note I
ever got from a girl in my life.”

  “I suppose you regard that as a love let-
ter ?”

  “No, Lettie.” There was something
sober in his words, something that lacked
any degree of triviality. “No, I ain’t no
kind of dog that thinks just ’cause a lady
is kind an’ good that he had oughta think
she’s in love with him. I ain’t that kind.
My daddy w’u’d ’a’ lammed hell outa me
if he thought I was thataway when I was
at home. I knows my place, Lettie; don’t
y’u mistake that.”

  “I should say you do,” she commented,
and he fancied there was intolerance in the
reply. He looked at her sharply but her
face was an unrevealing mask.

  “Then y’u said thay was somethin’ fun-
ny in the way I looked when I rode away
from y’u an’ the colonel. Thay wasn’t
no sech thing. Sandy Stuart’s workin’
for y’u, an’ I an’ him had a fight, one time,
up in Colorado. I came mighty close to
killin’ him. He’s just as crooked as the
Canadian River. T seen him just as he
seen me. That was what made me look
thataway. I reckon I’m right poisonous
appearin’ when I shore enough gets riled.
Where is he now ?”

  “Why, come to think of it, I passed him
and some of the other boys mending fence
on the other side of this ridge. Right
ahead of us. Do you think, Chugwater,-
that he could be mixed up with Buck’s
gang ?”

  “Well, I heard him say once that all
calves belong to all the people, an’ any
man’s got a right to go out an’ stick a iron
on any of ’em an’ call ’em his own. He
thinks a cow that feeds off’n open range
grass might belong to her owner, but her
calf is anybody’s what discovers it. If he
ain't with this other crowd I’ll bet it’s be-
cause he ain’t never knowed about it.”
to

  “Then perhaps we had better fly into
these trees. Those hands were going to
stretch wire to the top of the ridge and he
could easily see us from there. You’re
determined to go through with your
plans ?”

  “Oh yes, Lettie,” he laughed as they
broke into a gallop. “My way’s the short
trail to jail for them fellas, without lettin’
no blood. I just gotta hunch it’ll whittle
’em down calm an’ gentle. But y’u gotta
he’p. Willya?”

  “You try me!”

  “Then meet me yere, day after tomor-
row, at four in the afternoon. Right up
by that big dead pine that’s a-slantin’ over
ag’in’ that clump of pinon.”

   “I’ll be there.”

  “An’ bring twenty-five pounds of cop-
peras. I wants it plumb fresh—an’ pul-
verized.”

  “Copperas ? Are you going to make vit-
riol?”

  “I ain’t a-goin’ to say. I gotta hunch
an’ wants y’u to be my podner, blind.”

  She closed her eyes. The very words
to her heart were like a prayer. His pard-
ner, blind! She heard his voice continu-
ing.

  “I don’t want even yore dad to know.
Then I wants Colonel Buford to get out
tonight for Santa Fe an’ talk with the gov-
ernor. Remember this! Ask him to get
the Department of Agriculture of the U. S.
to send two men down to the bridge just
an even ten days from today. Not one
hour sooner. I’ll be on the spot to meet
them. Tell them inspectors that I knows
thay’s diseased cattle in that country an’
they ought not be allowed to cross over
that bridge. Tell them to wait an’ inspect
all cows as will come across the river.
Then here’s another thing. Have yore
daddy get the governor to quarantine ev’ry-
thing in an’ out of San Felipe, ’cause of
the black small pox. I have a idea that’ll
stop some votin’ up yonder.”

  “Wallie!”

  “Have y’u got it all?”

  “Why,” she cried, “I see what you are
trying to do! I see it! Isn’t this it?
You want that copperas because-”

  “Never mind. Y’u is my podner,
blind.”

  Once more the shock of his words, again
the tightening of the cords of the throat.
She paled a little.

  “Didja hear about the man I hit in the
pear?” he asked.

  “Yes, and Luis had to take him to El
Paso. And evidently he’s getting better*
i6

SHORT STORIES

 for Luis isn’t back yet. Father thinks
 that they are afraid to leave him for the

 reason that he
 might talk.
 Why don’t you
 want him
 jailed ?”

  “Not yet.
I’ll tend to
them fellas!
They shot at
me an’ the law
ain’t got nary
thing to do
with that.”

   There was a chill grimness to the man-
 ner in which he dismissed the idea of ask-
 ing for warrants against his enemies. It
 seemed to the girl that the very nature of
 the man had changed in that swift flash
 of vindictiveness. It numbed her. And
 she said to him very quietly, “Wallie, I
 don’t like you to say that. I don’t believe
 it is ever justifiable to take a human life

 •	out of revenge.”

   “Ya’as’m.”

   Again she felt a shudder of revulsion at
 the click of that single noncommittal com-
 ment.

   “I never thought of you as a killer be-
 fore, Wallie. Really you have seemed to
 me as a good natured boy who ought to be

 around me all the time. But now-”

   “Y’u see, Lettie, I an’ y’u is some dif’-
 rent. I bin on my own since I was ten.
 I was just left to rustle my ideas of life as
 I did my hash, pretty much as I found ’em.
 No woman ever told me it was wrong to
 smoke, or chew, or swear. Thay wasn’t
 any women. Men, why they thought it
 was funny to see me per-formin’. I
 breshed up ag’in’ life an’ found that the
 man or the hoss what does the most defen-
 sive an’ offensive is after a time let alone.
 I’ve had it hard. My first lesson in the
 out of doors was keepin’ my dad’s powder
 dry, under my coat, while my hands grew
 blue an’ numb outside. Next I knew what
 fight meant, an’ how to tell when it was
 cornin’ by lookin’ in a fella’s eye. Eyes
 don’t lie! I’ve learned to read ’em.”
 “Expertly?” she asked; but he did not
 catch the query.

   “Yore dad an’ his friends, through Mis-
 ter Buford’s brother, heard about me
 from the Front Range Cattlemen’s Associ-
 ation an’ the work I did around on the
 Poudre. They bargained with me. They
 knew I was handy with a gun an’ had a
 tol’able amount of nerve to take a chance.
 The letter I gave yore dad was this agree-

 ment. I was to get a top-hand’s wages
 an’ expenses for myse’f an’ hoss, if I come
 down an’ tried to break up this gang. An'
 five thousand in money if I done it. That’s
 what the dicker was. An’ it goes as it
 lays. They knew thay might be killin’s;
 they hoped it w’u’d be Buck’s boys, but
 they figgered it might be me. I lit in this
 country an’ got plugged before I got set.
 Somebody squawked. I hate to think it,
 but I believe it was yore daddy’s brother.
 I know he got drunk in Collins; an’ if he
 did, well these Mexicans down yere ain’t
 mind readers, an’ thay’s lots of Mex por-
 ters an’ sugar-hands in Fort Collins. Now
 the fella what dropped me settles with me,
 that’s all, when I’m done with my work.
 Maybe he won’t get killed. But if he’s a
 fightin’ fool an’ loves pov/der, one of us is
 a-headin’ for Kingdom Come when we
 yanks the first gun. Otherwise I’ll man-
 handle him with my hands.”

  “You make me shudder when you ex-
press yourself like that Wallie!”

  “It ain’t altogether me, Lettie. It’s fam-
ily after family of mountain bred men back
where I come from. Where thay’s a Bible
weighing twenty pounds an’ bound in the
heart of white oak trees brung over from
England, an’ what the Good Book says is
given to y’u at every meal. All the time
thay’s the latest model rifle a-hangin’ on
the wall. I know some of these fellas out
yere think a lie is a abomination in the
eyes of the Lord an’ a ever-present help
in time of trouble. But among my folks,
a lie’s a fightin’ name an’ a liar is four de-
grees lower’n the roustabouts in hell. An-
other thing is, when a man tries to fight
y’u, gun, knife, or go-as-y’u-please, an’
y’u lets the white feather wave in the air,
shucks, y’u best just leave the country.
Pride, that’s what it is, Lettie! Nothin’
y’u kin sell, swap or give away. But when
y’u got it, Lord, how it eats out yore
heart!”

  “But suppose you knew that the exer-
cise of your pride caused someone else
pain, would you still go ahead in a stubborn
way ?”

  “I dunno. I never had nobody tell me
anything I’d do w’u’d hu’t ’em; except
when some bad-hombre hollered for me to
let loose his eye or something.”

  “I’m asking you, now, not to follow up
the fight with Luis and his man. They
won’t fight fair! They’ll shoot you in the
back like they did before. Oh, Wallie,
I’m afraid-!”

  “Why, Lettie! What in the world does
y’u mean?”

                                                       it

  She stopped her horse and it seemed to
Chugwater that her lower lip drooped a
bit and sank at the corners, and that a curi-
ously rapid blinking of her eyelids held
back tears. But before he could formu-
late an opinion she had swung the pinto
around and was pointing with a hand
toward a small hog-back ahead of them.

  “Alongside of that little saddle, you’ll
come across a trail that drops into the road
to Engle about four miles from here.
Good-by, till day after tomorrow,” she
said.

  “I hope I naven’t made y’u feel bad,”
he said to her, and she turned in the sad-
dle and smiled at him through her tears.

  “You said something a while ago and I
don’t believe a word of it.”

  “What?”

  “Eyes!” she exclaimed, and touched her
pony with a spur.

  Chugwater watched her vanish among
the pine, then rode on.

  Three figures, high on the ridge above
him, watched Wallie gaze a long time after
Lettie, then canter out of sight.

  “Ain’t that the fella we seen the night
we was cornin’ in home from that three
weeks’ trip of brandin’?” asked one of the
figures.

  “Yep, that’s him,” replied another.

  “He shore sits a saddle, don’t he, Sandy ?
Y’u knew him up no’th, didn’t y’u?”

  “Yes. An’ he’s one killin’ devil, also.
Fast, either hand, an’ plumb expert, too,
when it comes to any kinda fightin’. I’d
like to see him get his, plumb center.”

  What Sandy Stuart saw quickened his
pulses, and for the rest of the afternoon he
planned and plotted how he was to get off
from the K Seven Quarter Circle long
enough to pay a visit to the Cow Daddie
saloon at Engle. Destiny, however,
dropped his pony’s foot in a badger-hole
on the return to the ranch and in the spill
that followed Sandy was rendered un-
conscious and did not come-to till late at
night. At that time he was in his bunk
and a great throbbing pain compelled him
to roll over and forget all else save his
misery. The next morning he was so
stiff he could hardly move.

IV

BEFORE entering the headquarters
of Pecos Willie Wainright, Chug-
water surveyed the town; laid its
methods of egress and ingress clearly in his
mind; located the livery stable, the hotel,
the principal streets and the railroad; then
he walked into a store, bought two hand-
10

 kerchiefs, and went to the hotel.

   In his room he took a shriveled object

from a parcel, wrapped it inside the hand-
kerchiefs and writing a brief note to Let-
tie’s father, sealed it and walked to' the
Post Office, where he stamped and mailed
it.

  In that package he had furnished Bu-
ford with the brand which he had cut from
the flank of the Reverse B. L. steer. This
enterprise over he strolled across the street
and entered the Cow Daddie Saloon. Pe-
cos was watching him as he came through
the door.

  Chugwater sought a secluded part of the
lower bar and signaled with an eye to
Wainright. The proprietor got up from
his seat and joined him.

  “What’ll it be?” asked Wallie.

  “Raw licker,” replied Pecos.

  “Add that an’ carry one mo’,” smiled
Chugwater at the bartender.

  “Who is y’u?” asked Wainright.

  “They calls me Criss Cross. I’ve just
come from Buck an’ the boys. I got that
list to be tallied by y’u fellas. Here it is.
It come last night.”

  “An’ y’u left, when?” said the saloon-
sheriff, accepting the roll of names.

  “This mornin’ just before the sun
jumped up.”

  “Boy, that’s a ride! Sixty miles in
thirteen hours over them sands is plenty
hoss work. Y’u musta come right along.”
“Yes, but I’m ridin’ a hoss. That’s got
somethin’ to do with it, too. Cain’t we
talk some place, private ?”

  After the drinks Wainright led the cow-
boy into a side room and threw him a
chair.

  “Let her ramble,” he said. “What’s on
your mind except yore hair ?”

  “We’ve got three hundred cows ready to
go out an’ Buck was thinkin’ to send ’em
to Sausalito the same day them Mexicans
comes in yere to vote. He figgered they’d
get clean across the big flats an’ mesas
without nothin’ but women seein’ ’em, on
account all the men bein’ in town to vote.
An’ he’s put me in charge of the job of
i8

SHORT STORIES

gettin’ ready. What y’u got in the nature
of fattenin’ feed.”

“Maize, barley, chop; most any kind.”
"C’u’d y’u get me two wagons of young
maize chopped fine an’ mixed with ground
barley, out of this man’s town tonight?”
“I reckon.”

  “An’ two mo’ day after tomorrow?”
  "Sure.”

  “That’s all I’ll be a-needin’. That’ll fix
’em ready to move, anyhow. I got all
them brands healed up an’ Buck’s right
pleased. I’m waitin’ over till day after
tomorrow. Tilley wanted me to tell him
if y’u fellas got the names down; an’ if
any trouble come out of it.”

  “He knows we don’t get throwed in our
own loop down this way.”

  “I dunno. An’ he told me to have y’u
send him some kinda paper tellin’ him I got
’em to y’u, correct.”

  “What kinda paper ?”

  “That’s what I’m wonderin’. What
kinda paper kin y’u sign for a raw deal
like that. Y’u ain’t perzactly altogether a
half-wit,” Chugwater smiled. “I’m just
new, y’u know. Maybe he thinks I’d go
to tamperin’ or somethin’. But if the pa-
per y’u has is what y’u was to get, maybe
he thought y’u’d say somethin’ to him in
pencil.”

  Pecos examined the list of names care-
fully, noted curiously marked lines at the
bottom of the list, and when he looked into
Wallie’s eyes he smiled.

  “All right, kid, I’ll give y’u somethin’.
Buck says y’u’re not pewter an’ I’ll tie to
his gradin’, any time. Whatcha doin’ to-
night? Playin’ calico or green-cloth ?”
“Say, I’ve heard about this town an’
they tells me it’s day all day in the day time
an’ thay ain’t no night a-tall. I’m pound-
in’ my ear, to quit feelin’ like I was pound-
in’ leather. Right now I’m gaited like a
man with a plaster-paris laig an’ a cork
nose. If thay was ary place in town where
a fella c’u’d feed, I believe I’d go in an’
buy four thousand duros’ worth o’ hawg
meat an’ hen pickles.”

  “Let’s feed,” chuckled Pecos. “Over at
the Broad-Daylight Restaurant is where
they’ve got T-bones as bellow an’ cove-
oysters as crow.”

  During the meal Chugwater sized up the
man before him and looked him squarely
in the eye at every opportunity that pre-
sented itself. When the apple pie was fin-
ished Pecos pulled a note book from his
pocket and wrote:	,

  “Three hundred received.	is some

addition.”

  He flipped it to Wallie who read it and
smiled.

  “Part of it’s in Chinook, ain’t it?”
“Them marks is yore name, kid; I criss
crossed it so the devil hisse’f c’u’dn’t read
it, if anything happened to y’u.”

  “Ain’t I the turtle-headed boy-wonder?
Y’u know what I took that for?”

  “What?”

  “Th<e double cross!”

  “Go on to bed. An’ drop around some-
time in the afternoon. It’ll take us pretty
much till that time to get these names scat-
tered over them sheets. An’ they got to
go to the votin’ places inside the next three
days.”

  The next morning Pecos reported that
all was well and that the head of the cattle-
men was out of town. He had seen Bu-
ford take the Cannonball for the north.
That assured the court-house crowd that
there would be no protest of any kind.

  At noon the following day Chugwater
rode out of town and at four o’clock met
Lettie as agreed. She removed several
small sacks of copperas from her saddle
bags and* Wallie stuffed them into his.
Then he gave her the receipt Wainright
had written for him.

  “When I went to town yesterday,” she
said, “I saw you entering your hotel.
Wallie, I had a lump in my throat as big as
a Bellflower apple. Before you leave I
want to have an agreement with you.”

  “If y’u asked me to dust the moon, I’d
do it.”

  “No, but a day or two before those Mex-
icans cross the bridge on their way to
vote, I’ll be up in the hills somewhere east
of the river and I’ll have a camp outfit with
me. I intend to be around you some-
where.”

  “Don’t y’u think of such a fool thing!”
“But it isn’t a fool thing. I’m as good
as a man when it comes to roughing it, and
I want to be on hand to see that nothing
happens to you, and to rush for help if I
think you are discovered.”

  “But y’u cain’t cross the river except
at the bridge an’ the water’s gettin’ higher
all the time. This side will not have a man
from anywhere west unless he gets this
way on that bridge. That’s my scheme.”
He smirked openly at her, but she
evinced no concern in his attempt to arouse
her curiosity.

  “Remember, I’ll be east of the river
within a mile north of the bridge two days
before the Mexicans cross. That’ll be the
day before the election, won’t it ?”

  “Yies. Buck figgers on placin’ ’them
CHUGWATER WALLIE

greasers twenty-four hours before they
vote. Dad got away all right, Wainright
told me.”

   “Yes, and he has such faith in you that
he’ll make the governor do what you want.
He’s in love with you, Wallie. I think
you’ve bewitched him. He called you my

boy!”

   Chugwater’s face was a study of turbu-
lent emotion. All he could do was to rub
a palm on his saddle-horn and chuckle.
After a spell of strangulation due to rapid
smoking he said, “Lettie, girlie, please don’t
come out thataway. But if y’u does, don’t
bring nobody along, an’ keep out of sight.
That pinto ag’in’ them red chalk cliffs to
the east of our camp, w’u’d look like the
court house burnin’ down.”

  “I’ll be alone. Oh, Wallie, I forgot
the most important bit of news! Sandy
Stuart fell with his horse and was laid up
for two days. Now he wants to be taken
into Engle. I remembered what you told
me and I have told the foreman to delay
sending him till I got home.”

  “Uh-huh. He seen I an’ y’u the other

day. An’ y’u kin
bet now he’s
wantin’ to see
Pecos or Luis.
If y’u have to
break one of his
laigs, keep him
out of Engle.
Can y’u depend
011 the fore-
man?”

   “Absolutely.”
“Then tell him that thay’s five hundred
on him for calf stealin’ up at Hayden, Col-
orado, an’ to keep him solitaire till I gets
back. Lord, it’d shore be my luck to have
him make a call on me right over on the
river. Y’u c’u’d use me for a clabber-
strainer two hours after he spilled what he
knows on me.”

   “Wallie!”

   He had headed his horse west.

   “Wallie, please don’t go! All the cattle
in this valley aren’t worth the risk you
are running.”

   “At the feet of yore grace. An’ go with
God—as the Mexican women say.”

  Then Hayburner tore madly into the
west.

FOR three or four days after he re-
joined the outlaws Chugwater was
given to spells of moodiness. The
anxious lines he had seen in the face of
Lettie and a strange fluttering suggestion

       10

of her meaning to his life would not dis-
appear from his intuitive processes; he was
a creature half mad at times with the fan-
tastical workings of some vague hope, and
at others a numb staring automaton that
circulated among the cows with a lagging
step and a formidable unconcern.

   This state of affairs aroused the fears of
the Hot Tamale Kid. He didn’t like it.
He watched Wallie; saw a hot flush creep
up along his throat and change suddenly
into a ghastly pallor; saw the fine eyes of
his room-mate glow with a rich flaming
fire and fade to a dull listless haze.

  Many times he muttered half aloud, “I
don’t like it. I just shore don’t like that
kid’s actions, an’ if I thought—God! An’
me a sleepin’ with him, too.”

   One morning, three days before election,
Chugwater arose an hour earlier and step-
ping to Hot Tamale’s bunk shook him and
said, “I’m goin’ to give them cows that
special feed this mornin’ an’ y’u can take
care of them this afternoon.”

  The Kid grunted and went back to
sleep.

  Chugwater hooked up a team and piled
the wagon with the mixed chop sent by
Pecos. Under the front sacks were the
bags of pulverized copperas.

  An hour later, as he was putting the
horses away, Hot Tamale came up behind
him suddenly and stood straddle-legged
immediately behind him.

   “Criss Cross,” he said in such a low and
startling tone that Wallie swung around
on the pivot of a single heel.

  “Oh, y’u Kid,” he said, “that ain’t no
way to do.”

  “I wants to know something.”

  “Go ahead.”

  “Is y’u well? Plumb well?”

  “Yes. Why?”

  “Lemme feel yore haid?”

  He advanced his hand, laid it on Chug-
water’s forehead, then jerked it away with
a whip. “Fever!” he exploded in a loud
toneless voice. “Fever!”

  “No, that ain’t fever; that’s just yore
warm hand after turnin’ outa them blan-
kets. I ain’t got nothin’ wrong with me
that a very little lump of the dinero won’t
heal.”

  The Kid walked away perplexed.

  That afternoon Hot Tamale fed the
cows.

  And each of them received a small
amount of the copperas which Chugwater
had sprinkled in the feed boxes and thor-
oughly mixed in the morning. His work
was done in this regard. And he had not
20

SHORT STORIES

been caught at it. Two doses had been
given.

  When Tamale came back, he and Chug-
water sat in their cabin playing a game of
Seven Up. Buck Tilley came to the shack
and joined them. And during the game
the rustler appeared in high glee. He ex-
pressed himself as fully confident that the
care Wallie had taken with the stolen stock
would enable him to get five dollars a head
more for them than he would otherwise
have obtained. He promised Chugwater that
he would have charge of the drive. And the
hour for starting the cattle was settled on
as ten o’clock in the morning the day be-
fore election. When the game broke up
Tilley said that on the following morning
he wanted all the "cows brought down to a
corral close by the bridge. From this po-
sition they could be driven across the river,
quickly, without any delay, and with a min-
imum loss of flesh due to the excitement
always attendant upon a drive.

  A hail was heard down the hill and Buck
arose hurriedly and left the cabin. In a
short time Hot Tamale picked up a bucket
and went to the spring. He was gone for
what seemed to Chugwater to be a very
long time, and when he returned he glanced
at Wallie in a furtive fearful manner.

  Then he began to roll down his shirt
preparatory to shaving.

  Chugwater sat down to a table and was
riffling the cards preparatory to a game of
Napoleon solitaire when he heard the voice
of the Kid rasp behind him and felt some-
thing cold at the base of his skull.

  “Stick up them paws, Chugwater, an’
don't monkey with me!”

  Wallie’s hands went into the air. Hot
Tamale yanked a gun from Chugwater’s
holster, then walked backward to the door,
flung it open and yelled, “Come on in, he’s
tame!”

  The room filled immediately.

  Back of Buck Tilley Wallie saw Sandy
Stuart, Pecos Willie Wainright, a tall
Mexican whom he estimated by the same
shirt he had glimpsed in the pear-patch to
be Luis; and around these were members
of the gang on whose faces were venomous
expressions of curiosity and loathing. Buck
fixed his eyes on him and then spoke.

  “Go through him.”

  Two men searched Wallie’s clothes.
They found nothing.

  “Maybe it’s in the hat,” suggested Pecos,
and Hot Tamale picked up Wallie’s Stet-
son and pulled out a sweat soiled piece of
paper. This he handed to Buck who read
it aloud.

  “Well,” sneered Sandy, “that Buford
gal knows now that he’s traced an’ the
next thing we’ll see is her a-headin’ this
way. If it hadn’t been for Luis, yere, I'd
bin there yet. That note’s from Lettie
Buford, Buck!”

  “Some of y’u boys take some hoss-feed,
grub, an’ a bed roll, an’ cross the river an’
watch them red bluffs. If that gal shows
up, bring her yere.”

He named three men who left the cabin.
“Willie,” said Buck, “are y’u daid shore
this hombre didn’t meet nobody in Engle ?”
“Not a fella. He went to his hotel an’
stayed there. When he come out I was
with him. An’ after the first fifteen min-
utes I had Pablo on his tail all the time.
He never spilled nothin’ in Engle.”
Chugwater sneered.

  “Y’u knows what’s a-comin’, don’t y’u ?”
shot Tilley.

  “Lead yore ace! I’ve played my hand,”
replied Wallie.

  “Pecos, does y’u reckon—” began Tilley,
when Sandy Stuart interrupted.

  “This magpie’s a cute fella, don’t go
wrong that he ain’t! But if he says he’s
all set, behind him, I’d lay even money he’s
jammed. I w’u’dn’t believe nothin’ he
volunteered. My guess is that we got him
just in time.”

  “That’s me, too,” offered the Hot Ta-
male Kid and he told of the strange moods
of Chugwater. This was taken to mean
that Wallie was on the point of escaping
and that the band had detected him at the
right hour. Looking through the open
door Chugwater saw an old Mexican wom-
an passing into a cabin opposite. Luis
saw her at the same moment and shouted,
“Manuela, come yere!” The woman en-
tered the cabin.

  “This old dame,” introduced Luis, “is
the sister of the Mexican woman who was
a nurse to Lettie Buford. And she’s thick
with the girl. Now tell the captain what
the girl told y’u.”

  “When I am on my way to Engle a few
days ago I meet Senorita Buford. I ask
her how’s the good luck and we talk, cliar-
lamos un poco, maybe ten minutes. Then
I say when I go on, where’s the good
Senor Buford? And she tell me he is
gone to Trinidad for to look at two prize
bulls. That is all I know, hones’!”

  “That’s right,” remarked Pecos. “The
station agent told me he bought a ticket
to Trinidad.” Manuela managed, during
the next few seconds, to hold the eyes of
Chugwater an infinitesimal length of time.
But in that swift and somehow penetrat-

10
CHUGWATER WALLIE

21

ing stare, she conveyed to him a feeling
that she was in sympathy with him. Her
words to the bandit chief had pleased Wal-
lie totally. At a nod from Luis the old
woman slipped out of the room.

  Big Foot Alec at a command from Buck
left the cabin and when he returned a pair
of hand-cuffs were snapped on the wrists
of Chugwater and he was thrown on the
bed. The Hot Tamale Kid was given the
key and left as a guard. All the other men
filed out of the cabin.

  Later Tamale locked Chugwater in and
went to supper.

  When he came back he carried a tin
plate filled with food, and a cup of coffee.
He laid the food on the table, tossed Wal-
lie the key to the
manacles and told
him to unlock the
wristlets and eat,
while he himself
sat near the door
with a drawn gun
in hand. After the
meal Wallie locked
the hand-cuffs on his wrists and the Kid
examined them to see that they were se-
curely closed. He stuck the key in a shirt
pocket.

  That night Wallie was roped in bed and
the cabin door locked on the outside.

  Twice during the night he awoke the
Hot Tamale Kid with nightmarish screams.
In the morning he said he did not feel like
eating and refused the meal the Kid
brought. The day passed slowly and no
one approached the cabin. Hot Tamale
spent a great deal of time looking from the
window and alternating this with a word-
less staring at Chugwater.

  Shortly before sundown wagons began
to arrive, bringing in great loads of Mex-
icans. And from the babble of sound out-
side Chugwater knew that a meal was be-
ing served in the open. Presently as the
Kid looked from the window he turned to
Chugwater and said, “They’re bringin’ the
Buford gal up the hill. I reckon that
plumb tickles y’u, don’t it?”

  Chugwater made no reply but a rising
gulp in his throat almost choked him. Fear
of a numbing and loathsome nature filled
his mind. He knew that unthinkingly he
had been the means of making it impossi-
ble for relief to reach Lottie. He recalled
her promise to tell no one where she was
going and to bring no one with her. Now
—God! Her note had sent them after
her.

  “Come on over to the window, fella,”

   10

jibed Hot Tamale, “an’ y’u kin get a right
good look at her. She’s passin’ now! If
she don’t land in Buck’s lap y’u kin eat my
liver. Class, all over her!”

  Chugwater rushed from the bed and
pressed his face against the glass of the
window, and as he did so Lettie saw him.
For a fraction of time her eyes widened,
stared at him incomprehensibly, then she
turned her head. In a door directly before
her and staring at the girl, stood Manuela.
The end of an apron was held in the old
woman’s mouth and a white pallor beneath
the tan of her cheeks gave to her counte-
nance a miserable aspect.

  Lettie passed out of sight and Chug-
water returned to his bunk. Hot Tamale’s
eyes were windows to a fear-filled mind.

  A deep racking groan escaped from
Chugwater. In the confined interior of
the cabin it sounded like a death agony.
He raised his cuffed hands and swept their
backs across his forehead. Once more the
groan. Hot Tamale couldn’t endure the
sound.

  “What’s the matter?” he asked. “Did
the sight of that gal give y’u the belly-
ache ?”

  “I don’t know what it is. Give me a
drink of water.”

  The Kid brought a dipper and gave it to
Wallie who drank and fell back on the pil-
low. “I reckon—” he began; then ceased
to talk.

  “What y’u reckon?”

  Chugwater did not reply. Again Ta-
male put the query. No answer. He
came to the bed and stared down on his
prisoner.

  “Fainted!” he said, then walked to the
door, opened it, and passing outside, locked
it. As his footsteps died away Chugwater
sprang from the bunk and picked up some
matches from the table. Next he secured
some of the axle-grease from the loosened
chinking and placing this in a piece of
newspaper hid it under his blankets; then
he lay down on the bed. He was inordi-
nately famished. Yet when Hot Tamale
brought him his supper he refused to eat.
The night wore on. Hot Tamale was
away from the cabin for two hours; when
he returned Chugwater was sitting on the
bunk, looking disconsolately at the floor.
The Kid lit the lamp.

  “Better?” he asked.

  “Yes,” replied Wallie, “I must have
caved, a little.”

  “An’ that ain’t all, bo! Tomorrow we
moves out them cows. An' when they’s
on their way Buck an’ me an’ two more
SHORT STORIES

boys takes y’u for a ride, to hell. That
hoss of yores is shore goin’ to be a or-
phan.”

  “I don’t care! Maybe y’u won’t!”

  “Thay ain’t no maybe about this. The
five of us cain’t cross east of that river,
but Pecos an’ the other boys is goin’ to
run them cows to the railroad. While
they’re gone we aims to plant y’tt so deep
y’u won’t sprout.”

  “Then y’u better clinch me on the roof
o’ hell,” Wallie taunted and smiled. “I
may s’prise y’u yet, y’u damn’ stogey-
built whip-snake. If I had my hands free
I’d make y’u eat that gun; spit it up, an’
digest it slow. If y’u thinks I’m hot-
house, just keep on tryin’ to make me wilt.
But if y’u knows what I knows, y’u’d be
usin’ that key an’ throwin’ my riggin’ on
Hayburner for me an’ the girl. Shore as
hell I’ll be slantin’ a eye on y’u when y’u
tries to dance on air.”

  The Kid wet his lips.

  “Shut up,” he said. “If y’u open that
trap ag’in, I’ll fold this smoke-eater right
over yore brow.”

V

THE cattle drive began the follow-
ing morning at a little after six and
at nine-thirty Pecos and his aids had
them fairly well strung out and headed for
the bridge over the Rio Grande. Through
the clouds of dust rolling before the herd,
Wainright made out a wagon on the east
side of the bridge. ^ He spurred his horse
around the cows and crossed the bridge;
on the last steel girders he saw three log
chains had been stretched and locked with
padlocks. The river-crossing was effect-
ively closed.

  He flipped back his vest and exposed his
badge.

  “I’m sheriff of this yere county,” he an-
nounced. “Who are y’u birds ? An’what
is it y’n want with them chains where they
is?”

  A little gray-haired man who had been
seated on the concrete abutment of the
east approach arose and looked into the
eyes of Pecos Willie.

  "Y’u knows I’m United States Marshal
up at Gallup, don’t y’u, Pecos?” he
drawled, his voice full of a resonant men-
ace.

  “Of course I knows y’u,” replied Wil-
lie, "y’ure Cool Charlie Kibbe. Ev’ry-
body knows y’u. But what is it y’u want
down here?”

  “These men,” said Kibbe pointing to his
companions, "have been sent down here to

inspect all cattle coming across this river.
They’re animal health-inspectors of the De-
partment of Agriculture, Are those dog-
ies cornin’ this way ?”

  “They was.”

  “We’ll have to look at them,” said one
of the health-officers, ducking beneath the
chains.

  “Sure,” replied Pecos. Then he shouted
a command to some of the punchers flank-
ing the herd, and within a few moments
seven of the leaders of the band of cattle
had been roped, thrown, and hog-tied. The
Government men examined them carefully
for black-leg, then pried open a cow’s
mouth and instantly dropped the head.

  “What’s the answer?” asked Wainright.

  “I condemn all this herd and order you

men to drive it into the nearest fence at
once. Not an animal can cross this bridge.”
“What?”

“There’s hoof and mouth disease of a
flagrant character running through this
stock and I will have to kill every animal.”
The Mexicans came up in their wagons
at that instant.

  Pecos turned to the chief inspector and
said, “Take down those chains an’ let these
boys through; they’re goin’ home to vote
an’ got to ride forty miles, some of them.”
“No animal can cross this bridge, to-
day ; and what’s more, no man either until
we can get some fumigating houses erected
on this side of the river. I quarantine
all you men and order you to stay within
sight of this place.”

  A mutter hurried through the ranks of
the outlaws, a chattering began among the
Mexicans. The face of Wainright was
that of a man stricken with utter stupefac-
tion ; then he roused, rode to one of the
band, and told him to ride back and tell
Buck. The bandit tore away toward the
hills.

  "Come on, Pecos,” shouted one of the
riders, unhooking a carbine, "let’s go.
Are y’u a-goin’ to let two hoss doctors an’
that old coffin-fodder- from Gallup run a
sandy on yu’ like this?”

  Cool Kibbe flashed two guns, set them
squarely against his hips and shouted at
the cow-boy.

                                                       10

   “Bring that hand up off that boot, quick!
An’ let it come empty, too!”

  The rustler obeyed with a ludicrous
haste. Kibbe continued to talk.

  “Now let me tell y’u birds somethin’.
This ain’t New Mexico y’u’re tantalizin’.
It’s the U. S.! An’ that means us; me an’
sixty millions mo’; an’ two troops of the
Seventh at Wingate; an’ all the tel-ee-
graphin’ an’ railroadin’ we wants to feed
y’u petty-larceny, near-bad boys just the
kinda pills that’s good for yore how-come-
y’u-sos. Turn them cows slant-wise, an’
back ’em up the river. I kin perforate
twelve of y’u fellas, more’n likely, before
y’u gets me. After that somebody else
will get the rest of y’u. Start stringin’
’em out.”

  Pecos dropped his head on his breast and
the cattle were milled about and prodded
up the back-trail; the Mexicans held a
parley and headed their wagons for San
Marcial. More than one of them had
gazed into those gray-green eyes of Kibbe;
voting was exactly what they didn’t want
none of. They had their money, or some
of it, and now they craved traveling.
They headed home in an utter rout.

  “I’m shore sorry, sheriff,” mocked
Kibbe, “but if y’u ain’t quarantined, then
I’m a liar that never heard of that sorta
thing before.”

   Pecos rose in the stirrups, glanced across
the river and saw a great cloud of dust
coming toward the west. One look was
enough; he fled after the cattle.

  AN HOUR after the drag moved, the
Mexicans started away -from the
J. JLcabins, and thirty minutes after they
were gone Tamale left Chugwater. As
soon as the Kid was fifty feet from the
shack Wallie arose, pulled out the grease,
and standing before a piece of looking-
glass dipped a match in the repulsive stuff
and daubed his face with it.

  He built up splotches; pimply cone-like
formations; a lone mound of black and
brown and faint yellow; and when he had
finished to his satisfaction he lay back on
the bed.

  In a short time Tamale returned.

  “Get up!” he commanded.

   “I cain’t get up.”

  “Whatcha mean, y’u cain’t get up?”

   “Tamale, I lied to y’u boys.”

  “How?”

  “About San Felipe. I got drunk in that
town an’ stayed till I sobered up. I slept
next to a fellow the small-pox got while I
was gettin’ nacheral. Now-”

       10

  “Now what? Whatcha mean?”
Chugwater moaned, edged backward
from the bed and then weakly standing,
took several steps which placed his body
between the door and the Kid, and turned
suddenly and squarely into the light.

  Hot Tamale took one swift look and his
jaw dropped.

  Then he jerked his gun.

  “Back away from that door or I’ll sali-
vate y’u!” he cried.

  “Unlock these cuffs for the love of God
an’ let me get the air. I want to die in the
air! I’m suffocatin’ in yere!”

  “Get outa the way!” The hammer of
the gun slowly rose.

  “Shoot! I’ll get my hands on y’u be-
fore I go. I just know I kin last that
long. Y’u’re too close; y’u can’t beat me
outa one grab anyhow An’ one’s shore a
plenty! An’ when I does, this face goes
right ag’in’ yore mug! Do I get the key
to them cuffs?”

  “God, yes!” shrieked the Kid, and reach-
ing into a chaps pocket brought out the
manacle key and flung it on the floor.
Wallie jumped behind the wall, away, from
the window, and Tamale unlocked the door
and fled. In his haste to get away from
the scene and while he attempted to shove
a padlock through a hasp-staple the lock
flew out of his hand. Instead of search-
ing for it he inserted an iron pin hanging
on a piece of wire beside the door casing
and ran for the main-buildings.

  Buck was standing beside a door and
saw the Kid rushing toward him.

  “What’s up?” he yelled.

.“Small-pox!” he screamed. “Small-
pox ! Chugwater is broke out all over an’
I been sleepin’ in there. He lied about
Felipe! Got drunk an’ sobered up there.
I wish y’u c’u’d see his face.”

  He was nearly alongside of Tilley when
the rustler’s gun jumped out of its leather
and covered him.

  “Back up!” sang out Buck. “Back up
an’ take any hoss y’u want an’ high-tail
away from yere; y’u’re done, plumb done,
with any of us. Git!”

  Tamale stopped, stared, and started on
the dead run for a corral where he mount-
ed his horse and tore away through the
timber. At that moment Buck heard the
rider Pecos sent. In an instant the chief
and his aid had entered one of the cabins
and the horseman was telling his leader
what Kibbe and the inspectors had done.

  Across from Chugwater’s cabin old
Manuela stood looking out of a window.
She had heard the loud words between
24

SHORT STORIES

Wallie and the Kid and comprehended ex-
actly what she was doing when she flung
open her door, rushed into an adjoining
cabin and took down a carbine and car-
tridge belt which belonged to Luis, and
then turned and hurried to Chugwater’s
cabin where she slipped the pin and called
on him to come out.

  As he sprang from the building, she
pressed the gun into his hands and gave
him the belt.

  “Where is the senorita?” he asked.

  “There,” she replied, “in that small cab-
in at the b i g
pinon. Go, I
have the key!”
The old feet
reached L e t-
tie’s shack im-
mediately b e-
hind Chugwa-
ter and in an
instant the man
and woman
had entered
and closed the door.

  “Quick,” yelled Wallie, “come on! Let's
be gettin’, Lettie!”

  “Manuela at the window screeched back
into the room, “Too late, senor, here they
come!”

  Chugwater pumped the lever to the gun
half way, saw that a shell was in the bar-
rel, tried to stuff a cartridge in the maga-
zine and found it already full; then peer-
ing out of the window saw Buck, One-
Eye John, Big Foot Alec, Abilene Al, and
the man Wainright had sent to Tilley,
standing with their backs to him, staring at
the open door of the cabin he had just left.

  He saw they were non-plussed. And
with a bound he reached the door of the
cabin and flinging it wide shouted, “Paws
in the air, y’u coyotes! The man that is
last in gettin’ up his hooks drops first!”

  Five pairs of hands flew above heads.

  “Y’u, Buck! Fling that iron on the
ground, then back to the sky with that mit.”

  Buck’s gun was tossed to the earth.

  “Now, One-Eye, follow suit. If y’u re-
nig, any o’ y’u boys, it’ll be just once too
often for y’u, that’s all.”

  Another gun was thrown aside.

  The remaining men were similarly
treated.

  “Now get in that shack, pronto, an’ slam
the door.”

  “Shoot, damn y’u, shoot!” yelled Buck.
“I’d rather have it thataway than to go in
there.”

  He reached for his discarded weapon,

but at the crack of Wallie’s rifle he fell in
a side whirl and grasped at his right hand
which was now a mass of reddened flesh.
The other bandits jumped into the cabin.
“Get in there, Tilley!” sang out Chug-
water. “Looka yere!”

  The rustler raised his face and saw
Wallie wipe a hand across his countenance;
the pimply visage was transformed into a
ghastly smear out of which issued the il-
luminating grin of Chugwater.

  “I don’t go in for fancy face lotions,”
he shouted, “this yere recipe of mine calls
for I. X. L axle grease.”

  “By God!” groaned Tilley and getting
to his feet jumped into the cabin.

  “Close the door.”

  The door slammed instantly.

  Wallie rushed to the cabin, pulled the
hasp into place and finding the lock
snapped it through the staple; this done he
gathered up all the sixshooters and carried
them back to the cabin where Manuela and
Lettie stood waiting for and watching him.
“Wash it off, dear!”

  “What!” Chugwater’s knees suddenly
shook. The armful of guns clattered to
the floor.

  “Wash off that horrible stuff, Wallie.”
“Oh!” he said, and stepped to a basin
and washed his face and wiped it on a
brown towel.

  Lettie’s eyes were aflame as she saw
Chugwater looking at her, and when he
stepped toward her they closed, and she
swayed suddenly as though she were about

to faint. Then-

  From far down the slope there came the
intermittent bellowing of bulls, the bawls
of mother-cows seeking their calves, the
“Ow! Ooo! Ooee!” of the herding punch-
ers. The herd was returning!

  He forgot Lettie, forgot Manuela, stand-
ing there with a rosary in her hands, her
lips moving, and her eyes closed. Fear
gripped him.

  He brushed the women aside and leaped
through the door. And as he reached the
outside he heard Lettie exclaim, “Manuela,
isn’t he stupid ? Did you see how he treat-
ed me?”

  "I’ll be back,” he yelled, reaching the
carbine leaning against the wall, “and when
I does, y’u better not try that once mo’!”
He was gone.

  Down to the corral he sped, whistled
for Hayburner and as the horse came to
him he found his saddle and quickly
mounted and rode away. At the crest of
the hill which permitted him to see the
road all the way to the river-crossing, a

sight greeted his eyes which made him
grow chill. There, right there on the salt
flats was the entire herd, and it was on the
run and behind it men, many men.

   And not a mile away was a clot of dust
 rapidly rolling along and coming pell mell
 after the cows. He watched it entranced.
 Soon he saw a solitary horseman break
 ,.,away from the drag and dash ahead at
 breakneck speed; then another rustler
 darted from the bunch, but he took an
 angling course to the west and headed for
 the trail which led to San Marcial and the
 railroad. Rapidly the men driving the
 cows left them, and in a few seconds they
 were strung out like steeple-chasers along
 an extent a mile wide. Their pursuers
 gained. A puff of smoke flew out of the
 mist of dust a faint flick of sound reached
 Wallie’s ears.

   “Buffalo gun,” he commented mentally.

  The lone horseman was approaching
him rapidly.

   It was Pecos Willie Wainright.

   Wallie led Hayburner behind a clump of
 juniper, and secreting himself along the
 trail, waited for the sheriff. When Pecos
 came through the trees, Wallie stepped out
 and threw down his gun on him. Wain-
 right collapsed and fell from the saddle.
 Willie disarmed him, took handcuffs from
 his saddle-bags, and manacled his arms
 around a tree.

   Then he looked down the slope.

   A part of the horsemen, he estimated it
 at thirty, was in pursuit of the rustlers
 who had fled across the wide swale; the
 remainder was coming up the road toward
 him, and in the lead was the lean long form
 of Buford.

   When the men reached him he halted
them and exhibited Pecos.

   “Lettie! Where is she ?” asked Buford.

   “She’s safe, sir,” replied Chugwater.
“How come y’u to be so plumb prompt?”

   “Last night we found the body of a fore-
 man of one of the ranches east of Engle
 who had been missing since two days be-
 fore you arrived in this country. He had
 been buried between my place and that of
 Worley. In his body we
 found a copper jacketed old
 style Remington slug of the
 British make. That told us
 something there. Worley is
 the only man in this county
 who carries a Remington six-
 gun. We gathered a posse
 and called on him. He was
 out, but the greaser who shot
 you in the pear was there and we put it
 10

up to him square. It was either come
clean to us or decorate a pepper tree. He
told us that he was present when Worley
shot the foreman because this man had
caught them red handed cutting the brand
out of one of my calves Before the man
died he got one bullet into Worley’s leg.
I had been told by my foreman that he
thought Lettie had gone to the river. At
daybreak we were getting close to the Rio
Grande and had found her trail. We
saved our horses and jogged in slow till
we saw the dust around the bridge; then
we came ahead on the run.”

  “How about Worley, didja get him?”
“No. But we sent some men to Engle
with that Mex and we knew that Worley
was in town. The two of them ought to
have left for Tucumcari on the early morn-
ing express.”

  Chugwater released Pecos and forced
him to lead the way into the retreat of the
rustlers.

  Arrived before the cabin where he had
been a prisoner, he jammed his gun-barrel
under the hasp and with a quick pry tore
the steel band with its screws from the
door.

  “Come out,” he said.

  Tilley and his companions issued from
the building.

  Buford and the men with him literally
tossed back their heads and cheered.

  Lettie rushed up, and as her father dis-
mounted she threw her arms about his
neck and gave way to tears.

IATER in the afternoon the posse re-
turned with fourteen prisoners;
_Vsome of the rustlers had shown bat-
tle and were killed at close quarters. Herd-
ing the outlaws into several buildings and
placing guards at the door, Buford and
Chugwater were about to join Lettie and
Manuela when Wallie saw Cool Kibbe and
an inspector ride out of the trees.

  “Some of y’u hombres come down an’
drive them damn’ cows,” shouted the mar-
shal. “I quit punching twenty year ago.”
“Let ’em alone, Charlie,” greeted Chug-
water. “I reckon y’u is owin’ me a right
good snort.”

  “Y’u sin-twisted, good-for-nothin’, low-
down hill-billie, how is y’u?” And Kibbe
was off his horse, slapping Wallie across
the back. “I’ll buy the snort; lead me to
it f”

  “Them cows is mostly Reverse B. L.,
Cool, an’ I was figgerin’ on shootin’ ’em
out across the flats an’ lettin’ ’em browse
back to their own feed-grounds.”
26

SHORT STORIES

  “I’ll have to kill every one,” interrupted
the inspector. “They have hoof and mouth
disease among them.”

  In Chugwater’s eyes a dancing light
grew and his lips wreathed in a silly grin.
Cool Kibbe, who had been staring at him,
suddenly wheeled on the United States
man and yelled, “Wait a minute, I’ll make
him chatter!”

  He whipped out a gun and stuck it into
Wallie’s side.

  “Talk!” he said, “talk! Y’u ain’t got
that grin on yore map just to be laughin’.
Spurt out the history!”

  “Them cows ain’t diseased.”

  “But I saw the raw blotches, and the
purple and pink areas in their mouths.
There was every indication,” sputtered the
inspector.

  “Ya’as, sir,” replied Chugwater, “y’u
see I give them cows, or some of ’em, three
doses of that air stuff called copperas,
mixed with the feed. Then when they
belches up their cud, why y’u see, sir, that
air old green vitriol went sure-enough-for-
hell to work on the mouth lining. It was
a plumb good scheme, I figgered, to stop
them Mexican votes from gettin’ across the
river I wasn’t aimin’ on bein’ able to do
what Colonel Buford done went an’ did.

I	thought they’d be a lotta killin’ that-
away.”

  “Well by God,” wailed Kibbe, “now
ain’t y’u played hell on the old U. S.?
Y’u oughta be ashamed o’ yo’se’f!”

WHEN the moon came up that night
Lettie and Chugwater walked out
among the trees and he pointed to
the roaring Rio Grande flowing full-
banked below them like some luminous
monster highlighted and wriggling through
the hills.

  “Shore is pretty,” he said.

  The girl made no reply.

  “How come Manuela to be with these
crooks,” he asked out of sheer shyness and
for the want of something to say.

  “Luis Perez compelled her to follow him,
for he was afraid of her when she was out
of his sight. And he had reason to be.
It was Luis who killed the son of her sis-
ter, who was my old nurse. Wouldn’t you
like to know how old that boy was? The
color of his hair? And where Manuela
was christened? And how long she has
been an old maid? And what father said
when he got that bloody piece of hide?
And what I have done with the Criss Cross
joke Willie Wainright wrote? And if the

law and order citizens will elect their tick-
et tomorrow? Oh-!”

  She struggled half-way to her feet when
Wallie laid a hand on her arm and forced
her back at his side.

  “When I heard them cows a-bawlin’,
y’u said something as I hot-footed from the
cabin. If I ain’t got the lyin’est ears of
any white man out of Kentuck, then I
dares y’u to repeat them words! I’ll show
y’u. I shore will show y’u!”

  “Look into these two eyes!”

  She upturned her face and expanded
her eyelids.

  “You told me once, that eyes never lied.
Now, do they?”

  “Let me see,” he murmured, and lit a
match. As its light flared up a new uni-
verse was revealed to him.

  He flung away the match and folded her
into his arms.

  How long they sat in that delightful
madness they never knew. But the moon
traveled on and on till it dropped the tree
shadows in long and purplish images upon
the ground at their feet.

  Buford, missing his child, came in search
for her; and as he stepped gingerly over
the earth he saw how greatly she was occu-
pied. He stopped suddenly as he heard
Wallie say, “No, ma’am, Lady Lettie,
honey, it ain’t a-goin’ to be any such of a
time. No June for me! I’m goin’ to take
that five thousand dollars, an’ six months’
diggin’, an’ learn old Chugwater how to
talk. I’m goin’ to be eddercated, plumb
fancy. For I’ve got a podner wbat is a
podner, an’ I don’t never want for her to
be shamed of me.”

  “It’ll be June, Chugwater, you old dear.
Early in June! And if there is to be any
learning, I’ll learn you grammar and how
to talk, just like you have learned me how
to love.”

  Buford stepped on a twig.

  Lettie sprang to her feet and rushed into
his arms.

  “Oh, Dad,” she cried out of an exuber-
ance of emotion, “say something, Daddie!
Can’t you see how happy I am ?”

  “My boy!” spoke the old man, with a
trace of a gulp in his voice as he reached
out a hand.

  Out of the pinon there came the wail of
a dwarf-owl.

  “Who?” it moaned. 'Who?”

  “Me! y’u feather-whiskered, wise old
son-of-a-gun!” laughed Chugwater, and
grasped Buford’s hand in the powerful
grip of his fingers.

THE CRICKET

By HOLMAN DAY
Author of “Barrateers,” “A Case at Castonia,” ctc.

HE WAS A WOODSMAN, WAS THE CRICKET, AND LOOKED ON LIFE AS A JOYOUS

ADVENTURE. BUT ONE THING HE FORGOT-THE TENACITY OF A MAN

     WITH A BULLDOG GRIP ON A GRUDGE. YET EVEN THAT GRUDGE WAS
     TO DIE AWAY IN THE SHADOW OF THE FORESTS AND THE GREAT TREES
     WERE TO LOOK DOWN ON A MIRACLE IN THE WORKING OUT OF DESTINY

I

UT of the black forest of
Riviere du Loup leaped young
Chariot Belleau.

  He emerged from the sha-
dows into the broad valley of
the Chaudiere whose waters, fretted by
boulders and boiling in pools at the foot of
cataracts, had suggested the river’s name
to the pioneers.

  And like the waters did the blood of
Chariot’s yearning body boil! He sought
adventure, opportunity, life, gaiety. He
had rebelled all of a sudden. He had
broken away from duty self-imposed. In
order not to think backward he merely
looked ahead for the moment, assuring
himself that he was doing the right and
proper thing, after all.

   Out in the sunshine of the Chaudiere he
permitted the glory of new prospects to
flood out of him the shadows of repentance.
And why should he harbor repentance?
Had he not slaved for others until he had
almost lost the right to his nickname. The
Cricket? Who could feel like leaping and
dancing and singing after the long days
with the ax ? And the big trees were laced
overhead to keep out the sunshine, and the
great trunks seemed everlastingly march-
ing and countermarching like grim soldiers
intent on barring his escape to the world
outside. Chariot’s fancies made them
such! He was imaginative, volatile, sub-
to	27

 ject to prankish whims. His thoughts
 were leaping in lively fashion, just like
 crickets.

   And now he had rushed out past the
 threats of the barrier of the solemn trees;
 he laughed when he waved them a taunt-
 ing adieu.

   He looked up smilingly at the sun and
 then gazed thankfully across the rolling
 meadows of the broad valley. He eased
 his knapsack upon his shoulders and from
 a velvet sack, side-slung, pulled his violin;
 its music was the jolly chirp of Le Cri-
 quet.

   His collie ran frenziedly around him,
 rolled over and over, arose and scampered
 some more, transported with delight at
 this, his first, experience in the open fields.

   Chariot responded to his comrade’s show
 of exultation. With his violin against his
 breast he danced down the long slope of
 the lea and sang his liveliest chanson.

   So he came to the broad ribbon of the
 highway, the King’s Road, the interna-
 tional thoroughfare which extends from
 the Border all the way down the Laur'en-
 tian slope to Point Levis, opposite Que-
 bec. He was absorbed in his joy. He did
 not note that automobiles were halting in
 the highway, that their occupants were sur-
 veying him with interest.

   He danced down to the side of the road,
 singing, and was startled when he beheld
 the strangers—overwhelmed with confu-
 sion when they clapped their hands.
28

SHORT STORIES

“More!” They called, men and women.
“More music!”

  He shook his head and swapped apolo-
getic glances with Joie, the collie, for
whom Jollity now seemed a misnomer.
The dog cowered, frankly afraid of the
strange vehicles.

  “Come here, son!” called a man, beck-
oning. When Chariot stepped meekly to
the side of the car the man stuffed a bank-
note into the youth’s hand. “Now go to
it!”

  “I play for the fun, m’sieu’, only for
fun,” stammered Chariot, brokenly.

  “Don’t do anything in this world for fun
only, when you can get cash for doing it,”
warned the man. “Make that your
motto.”

  And as Chariot had come from the big
black woods to seek fortune as well as to
see the world, he paid deference to this
advice from the wise man of the outside
who could afford to ride in such a won-
derful machine and could carelessly give a
crisp bill to a stroller who took his fancy.
Chariot, let it be understood, was not seek-
ing money for himself by this adventuring
into what lay beyond the woods; he hoped
to find money—yes. But it was so that he
might salve with it the situation he had left
behind him in the woods.

  He tucked the money in his sash and
swept a deep salute, arms extended, violin
and fiddle-bow in his dipping hands.

  “Look how graceful—and the way he’s
dressed!” chattered a woman. “It’s like
something on the stage or in a picture.”

  Chariot’s heart jumped and there was a
flush under his tan. How silly it had been
to wait so long before testing the world
outside. Sunshine and green fields!
Money from a man and compliments from
a woman almost before his eyes were wont-
ed to the sun-glare! Surely he had been
wise to fare forth. Now he could do
much, in the right and better way, for the
folks he had left behind him. It had been
wisdom, not desertion of duty. He could
make them glad back there in the woods,
thankful because Chariot knew the best
way and was not merely the thoughtless
cricket they had twitted him with being.

  So the joy of life flared in him again.
The fires had been fluttering and dying,
back there in the dim woods.

  He played for the strangers his best
tunes and sang to the music and danced
on the meadow sward beside the great
highway. And other cars halted and the
folks tossed money which he did not hurry
to pick up. His dog sniffed at it and

frisked around the leaping master and
barked joyously as if he knew that for-
tune was at last on its way.

  Then the motors hummed and the merry
folks rolled on.

  “It is all very good and wonderful, this
world outside, Joie, bon ami!” laughed
Chariot, putting the money away. “So
soon the fine things have begun to happen
for us. And now let us skip along on our
tiptoes to see what we shall see. It will be
gay, eh, my Jollity?”

II

KEEPING discreetly to the extreme
side of the road, Josue Laliberte
trotted his little white nag, taking
to the fair at St. Chrysostome in bis two-
wheeled cart the wooden toys which he had
whittled. He, too, dwelt in the big woods
of Riviere du Loup.

  He scowled and muttered when he be-
held Chariot and Joie on the highway
ahead of him.

  He spoke out when he pulled his horse
to a walk, overtaking the young man. “So
at last you have run away from your duty,
eh? I do not ask you to ride with me. I
will not help you in the bad thing you are
doing.”

  Chariot flung the sunshine of his gay
smile into the scowl on the old man’s wrink-
led face. He danced along beside the
slow-moving cart. “But, anyway, I would
not cramp my legs in your foolish little
wagon, Josue. See, they are too lively!”
He leaped high and kicked above his head
and whirled about.

  “Bah! Le criquet sotto!” growled Jo-
sue.

  “Yes, the foolish cricket who has stayed
too long in the dark woods.”

  “How can you dance and grin, friponf
Yes, you are a rogue. You leave your
honest brother to fight alone, so weak and
sick he is, and always will be so, unless the
good saints give him back his health. He
and his wife and the seven children—how
will they find food now? Have you no
shame ?”

  “Yes,” confessed Chariot, sobering.
“It’s a cloud that keeps whisking across the
good, gay sun up there. I keep pushing
the cloud away.”

  Then he brightened, his quick emotions
always tumbling over each other, brisk
hope ever wrestling with sombre thought.
He pulled money from his pocket, bills
and coins. “See, Josue, so soon! All this.
And there’ll be much more.”

  “Not honestly do yon get that money so
soon,” protested the old man, though his
keen eyes gleamed avariciously. “One
must work with patience to get honest

money.”

  “Like you whittle all day and half the
night on your toys,
some silly bauble
to sell to a child?
Not for me!”
taunted Chariot.
“In just a few min-
utes I earn all this,
only by dancing
and singing. And now I go to earn some
more.”

  “It is not honest money, got that way by
your prancing legs and not with your
hands,” insisted Josue. “It will bring
much trouble—that money. Now you
chirp very high, M’sicn’ Lc Criquet. You
will mourn very low a bit later.”

  “Pooh, for your cawing, old crow I Do
you stay at St. Chrysostome all the days of
the fair?”

  “Yes,” admitted Josue. “I must sell my
toys.”

  “I’ll have money and many tilings to
send back to my brother Elie by you; and
I’ll pay you for taking the things—if you’re
not afraid and think the black magic is on
my money,” said the young man, vaunting-
ly and widi sarcasm. “You will see me at
the fair. Yes, you will hear much of me.
They all will like my dancing and my mu-
sic. And maybe,” he added in his boast-
ful confidence in the future, “I’ll buy the
toys you have not sold and I will toss them
to the children—like this.” He pirouetted
and flung his hands gracefully.

  Josue grunted his disgust and whipped
his horse into a trot.

  “He is like all the others who stay too
long in the woods,” declared Chariot to
JolHty, grinning widely into the attentive
visage of the dog whose extended jaws
seemed to give a smile in response. He al-
lowed the collie to sniff at the money, un-
closing his palm. “It will bring trouble to
me, eh?” Old fool Josue! Only because
it was not earned with the ax? Only be-
cause I did not stay in the woods and earn
it for Elie and Flore and the children? I
will earn more for them out here. They
shall see. Come along, Joie. We go to
find money and have much fun.”

  Old Josue turned to look as he went out
of sight over a dip in the broad road.

  Le Criquet leaped high and waved his
arms, intent on teasing die gloomy ancient
who had reproached him.

C HARLOT sauntered at last into the
village of St. Chrysostome. He ad-
mired the great arch which spanned
the highway. It was wreathed with bunt-
ing and, in letters made of the evergreen of
shrubs, was spelled, “Bienvenue.”

  “Thank you!” he said, flinging a salute
to the word. “Your welcome makes me
feel much at home.”

  It was all so festal, everywhere. There
were rows of booths and tents. He loved
music. It sounded all about. It was a
rude melody, almost cacophony. But his
woodsman’s soul was thrilled by the emo-
tions that such prodigality of melodies
aroused. A hoarse mechanical organ
squalled in the midst of the flying horses of
the carousel. Inside tents the flutes
squealed and tom-toms were beaten. His
blood responded to the primitive appeal of
this exciting sound. He did not know
what was the matter with him. This was
surely a new and wonderful and stirring
world, after the silence of the big woods.

  The dog was apprehensive and carried
his tail low and glanced about with evi-
dences of much concern.

  But Chariot was exalted—felt very bold
—became eager for derring-do and real ad-
venture. There was so much in the world
—he became thirsty in his craving for all
—he desired to drink deeply of this new
experience. He went where there was as-
sembled the largest crowd—to a platform
in front of a striped tent. Several girls
were standing on the platform and a loud-
voiced man was extolling them coarsely.

  Chariot blushed when he saw their short
skirts. He was a true man of the woods,
and his Gallic chivalry respected all wom-
ankind. He frowned as the man talked
on.

  Then he was shocked, almost horrified.
He recognized one of the girls. She was
Elisiane Fortier. She had been his neigh-
bor in the woods; her folks were honest
people.

  Chariot had felt no regret when she had
gone into the world. He was glad, be-
cause she had courage enough to venture.
She had merely put into action what he
had long wanted to do.

  He felt no thrill of joy when he beheld
her here. He was conscious only of grief.
There never had been anything except
careless friendship between him and Eli-
siane. There never could be anything else,
he was sure. But she was from the woods
—his own home place. He resented the
30

SHORT STORIES

leering glances of the crowding men. She
had daubed paint upon her face. He was
sorry to see that. What a shame for the
Fortiers! Old gabbling Josue would carry
gossip of this, be sure of that.

  Chariot’s emotions were keyed high that
day. He took no heed, in his concern for
her, of place or occasion. “Elisiane,” he
called, “run and hide yourself or your folks
will be shamed. Tattling Josue Laliberte
is here.”

  The crowd howled laughter. The bar-
ker cursed. The girl hopped in sudden
panic. Then she got control of herself and
simpered at Chariot and shrugged her
shoulders.

  “I am sorry for you,” he persisted. “It
will be a bad story to go back to your good
folks.”

  She made up a face at him. “Go and
squeak somewhere else, Le Criquet!”

  The throng took up the nickname and
made much of it in ridicule and sarcasm.

  The girl joined with them. “And come
up here, M’sieu’ Cricket, and do your danc-
es ! Oh, gentlemen, he is very lively with
his feet. All his wits are in his toes—so
’tis said about him in the place from which
he comes.”

  Men seized upon Chariot and kicked
away the growling, snapping dog who tried
to defend his master. They heaved their
captive high and tossed him upon the plat-
form. Some of them commanded him to
dance; others called to the girls to kiss him
and cure him of his foolishness.

  To Chariot’s horror they obeyed and
smeared their carmined lips on his cheeks.
The onlookers guffawed when he fought
the girls to keep his lips from theirs. Then
the barker interfered and pushed Chariot
off the platform. He fell upon a burly
man and bore him to the ground in his fall.

  The man rose first and dragged up the
Cricket and cuffed him soundly.

  Chariot pulled himself away and made
sure, first of all, that his precious violin
was not harmed.

  “I have a mind to crack that fiddle over
your head,” snarled the burly man. “To
pay for half cracking my ribs, you blun-
dering fool.”

  “I couldn’t help it—I was thrown on
you,” stammered Chariot.

  A man was anxiously and cautiously
feeling the big individual over, asking
questions. The subject of the investiga-
tion kept growling oaths, working up more
fury.

  “You came near making it a very bad
job on a man who needs all his bones safe

and his muscle good,” confided a bystander
to Chariot. “That’s the great champion,
Tom Moriarty, who has promised to meet
all comers at the fights of the fair.”

  The pugilist winced and cursed under
the prodding fingers of his manager. “And
did you hear the shrimp butting in and try-
ing to get my girl off the hooks—telling her
the folks would be ashamed of her?”

  He gave Chariot a vicious stare; the
young fellow did not flinch. His cheeks
were smarting cruelly. His pride was
stinging him, too. He was getting back
some of his courage and poise, recovering
from the confusion of his involuntary ap-
pearance before the public and his treat-
ment on the platform; the onslaught by the
girls had upset him more than had the cuf-
fing by the pugilist.

  “How do you dare to speak to my girl?”
demanded Moriarty. “Insulting her!”
“You do her the insult, allowing her
to be gaped at by all these men,” retorted
Chariot stoutly.

  “Lookit!” roared the fighter. “The dam’
grasshopper—or whatever it is they call
him—dares to talk back to me!” He
broke away from his manager and lurched
toward the young man. “I guess you don’t
know who I am.”

  “This gentleman has just told me,” said
Chariot, lifting his chin and meeting the
glaring eyes. He
broke in on the
other’s ferocious
oaths. “If I hurt
you I ask pardon.
It was not my
fault, though. But
for warning Elisi-
ane Fortier I ask
no pardon,
m’sieu’.”

  “And that’s the
main point, and it’s for that you are going
to ask pardon,” retorted Moriarty sneering
the last word.

  “Don’t hurt him, Tom,” pleaded the girl,
suddenly serious.

  Now jealousy was added to the flame in
the brute. This fellow for whom she
asked mercy was from her home, eh ? Her
lover in the woods, was he ? Probably!

  Moriarty doubled his fists. Then he
grinned evilly, cast side-glances at the by-
standers, and unclosed his hands. He lift-
ed his broad, open palms. “Oh, I won’t
risk cracking a knuckle on you, little
cricket! I’m saving my fists for my real
business. But come here and take your
spanking.”

                                                      10
THE CRICKET

  This jovial tolerance caught the crowd;
they had begun to mutter their protests at
a threatened fight between antagonists so
illy matched. There was much hilarity.
“Take your spanking, Cricket!” was the
chorus.

  A strange pallor settled on Chariot’s
tense features.

  He had acted for the girl only in the
spirit of friendship and natural chivalry.
Now they were making a jest of it all.
His woodsman’s pride was hurt. In the
woods a real man did not take a beating
without doing his best for himself in the
affair.

  And now the uplift of new world-adven-
ture was in his blood. Here and there the
tom-toms were beating. It was old stuff to
Moriarty—it was strange incitement for
Chariot. “Look here, M’sieu’ Two-fists,
you are making the fight. I do not want to
fight.”

  “You’ll get down on your knees and beg
me for pardon about the girl, then. You’ll
also beg her pardon for your saying she
has done anything to be ashamed of.”

  “No, m’sieu’. I have said my say as to
that.”

  “Then you’re due for the licking of your
life.”

  Chariot paid no heed to warnings and
urgings by the bystanders.

  When Moriarty lunged at him the young
man slipped off his knapsack upon which
Joie promptly flung himself as guardian.

  Chariot dodged around and entrusted an
onlooker with the violin. Moriarty was
reaching for his victim with eager, clutch-
ing hands. Chariot eluded the pursuer
and jumped backward. Doubled forward,
the pugilist rushed at him, disdaining to
maintain any defense of his person.

  Chariot was shod with pacs, a sort of
moccasin of heavy rawhide, without hard
soles.

  He leaped high in air, half turning and
struck Moriarty full in the temple with the
right foot. The prize-fighter grunted, fell
on his face and rooted his nose in the soil.
Partially stunned, he lay there for a mo-
ment. When he struggled to his knees he
bellowed, “What kind of fighting do you
call that, you damnation barnyard roos-
ter?’,’

  “You have your way to fight—I have
mine,” replied Chariot.

  The pugilist’s manager rushed forward
and helped Moriarty to his feet. “Call it
off, Tom! Don’t risk getting hurt. What
in the devil does this Quedaw know about
ring rules ? His tribe fights with their

feet. They have a name for it.”

  “Yes, m’sieu’,” volunteered a man in the
crowd. “It’s the coup de pied”

  “I don’t care what you call it,” raved
Moriarty, feeling his reputation at stake.
Who would pay money at the gate of the
arena tent in St. Chrsostome to see a man
who had been worsted out there in public
by one who had been laughed at as the
Cricket? He shouldered the manager
away. “I can lick any man, any way. I
don’t care if he's got more legs than a cen-
tipede.”

  “You ain’t going to make a fool of your-
self for nothing,” clamored the manager,
sticking to his professional ethics. “Be-
sides running a risk of getting out of con-
dition !”

  Chariot had not lost his pallor; he was
breathing quickly. “M’sieu’, I ask you to
call it square between us now!”

  “Damn you. I haven’t started yet,”
bawled Moriarty, lashing up his rage. He
flung his manager away with such force
that the man went rolling under the feet of
the crowd. Again he rushed at Chariot.

  This time the pugilist was more wary.
When Chariot leaped Moriarty was ready
to grab the right leg. But Chariot merely
feinted with that foot, seeing ahead the
intent of the adversary; he kicked with his
left foot, squarely in the face of Moriarty,
and sent him reeling backward. The man-
ager was in the way, on his hands and
knees. Moriarty was tripped and fell
heavily on his back.

  In a flash Chariot, now flaming with an-
ger, fairly beside himself in the surging of
his quick emotions, leaped on the prostrate
figure and began to pummel Moriarty with
fists which toil with the ax had hardened.

  The manager, full of alarm for his chief
asset, leaped to his feet and kicked Chariot.
The crowd howled protest at this combina-
tion of two men against one. Men rushed
on the manager and hustled him to one
side, out of the press. As he was dragged
away he yelled, over and over, “Come
along, Tom! Don’t waste yourself like
a fool.’;

  Moriarty, getting back wind and wits,
easily heaved Chariot away, only the young
man’s agility saving himself from a blow
which would have cracked his skull.

  The pugilist, after having been rolled
twice in the dirt, was not much less than a
maniac when he was again on his feet.

  “Now I warn you, m’sieu’,” cried Char-
iot, his shrill tones quavering. “I want no
more fighting.”

  “You bet you don’t,” growled the chain-
32

SHORT STORIES

pion, settling into the grim, ruthless sav-
agery of a bulldog.

  “If you keep on I’ll stop at nothing,”
shrieked Chariot.

  “Mister, he’s become one o’ them crazy
Frenchmen—and you must have heard
about ’em,” warned a man in the crowd.
“You’ll show good sense if you quit!”

  “What kind of a dam’ nightmare is this,
anyway?” snarled the prize-fighter. “Some-
body telling Tom Moriarty to quit? After
I’ve been kicked down twice?”

  Then once more the girl pleaded. This
time with the pugilist. “Tom, dear, listen
to me. Don’t get hurt.”

  This advice served as the bellows’
draught to make the brute’s fury white hot.

  He had been striving to swagger in front
of the girl, to increase her pride in his
prowess. Her plaintive interference, in-
dicating that she was afraid for him in this
contest with one whom she had been laugh-
ing at as the Cricket, served as a madden-
ing goad. Roaring like a bull, he rushed
at Chariot.

  The nimbler adversary ducked under the
swinging arms and before Moriarty could
halt his rush and whirl to defend himself,
Chariot leaped high and from behind drove
both heels against the thick neck.

  The plug-ugly had become unpopular,
there was no questioning the fact. The
manager’s act had started the resentment;
the fighter’s coarse oaths and his vengeful
persistence in pursuing this little chap, who
had been dragged into conflict, fanned the
resentment into anger. No arms were
reached to save Moriarty from a fall when
he staggered forward. He tumbled on his
face.

  Pouncing like a wildcat, no longer think-
ing but acting on the instinct of the forest
creatures among which he had dwelt all his
life, Chariot relentlessly made himself safe
from further attack. He came down with
all his weight on Moriarty’s arm, extended
on the uneven earth, and the bone of the
upper arm cracked with a muffled, porten-
tous sound. Blended with the hog-squeal
of the victim were the oaths of the man-
ager, held on the sidelines. The girl
leaped down from the platform and ran
and kneeled beside the squirming pugilist.

  Chariot turned from them. His mien
was ominous. He had allowed himself to
go to the extent of his fury; even after his
victory he was controlling himself with dif-
ficulty. They who looked on him marked
his dangerous qualities. They muttered
among themselves.

  “If any m’sieu’ now has anything to say

to me, let him speak it out!”

  They shook their heads.

  When he retrieved his violin the man
who had held it patted Chariot’s shoulder.
“He asked for what he got, son. I guess
they’ll lay off’m that nickname of yours
from now on.”

  Joie wagged an applauding tail and sur-
rendered the knapsack to the master. The
two walked away.

  Behind them Mori-
arty bellowed. His
anathema was hide-
ous. He rang changes
on his vicious de-
termination to get the
damnation Canuck
good and plenty if he never did anything
else in his life.

  “And it looks like he’d have plenty of
one thing—and that’s time away from his
regular job to attend to private matters,”
grumbled a man who followed Chariot out
of the crowd. “What the blazes I’m going
to do now in the way of a show, I don’t
know, damme if I do!”

  Then his forehead cleared of wrinkles of
puzzled despair and he hurried and over-
took Chariot and clapped a hand on
the stroller’s shoulder. The young man
whirled, posturing against threatened at-
tack.

  “You’re a smart one, all right!” stated
the man with a grin. “I can show you how
to earn a good lot of money. You’re after
cash, of course? We all are.”

  “Yes, m’sieu’! I want to earn money.”
“My name is Connick. That’s my big
tent over there. It’s where Tom Moriarty
was going to meet all comers. But you
have spoiled my show. An idea has just
come to me. You are much talked about
right now. They’ll all want to see the man
who has licked the champion. I reckon I
can dig up some other lads who are good at
this foot fighting. I’ll give out word that
you’ll meet ’em all. What say?”

  Chariot shook his head. “No, m’sieu’!
I fight to save myself from harm. I’ll not
fight for a show and for pay.”

  “But I’ll give you a hundred good dol-
lars right now in your fist. Later I’ll hand
you a slice of the receipts.”

  Chariot walked on. “No, m’sieu’. I’d
be ashamed to fight for money.”

  “Then what else can you do?” queried
Connick, following. “You have become a
good attraction, all at once. You’ll draw
a crowd. But you’ve got to do some-
thing.”

  “I can sing the chansons—all the Cana-

                                                          10

dian boat songs. I can play on this.” He
patted his violin. “I can dance very fine.”

  “Oh, yes, I heard that girl say some-
thing about it.” He made up a wry face.
“It’s a devil of a shift from a good fight,
but I can make up a fighting bill out of the
second-raters who were going against the
champ. And you can do your stuff. You’ll
be worth a hundred to me, even if you do
nothing but your fiddle tunes and your hop-
and-skip. You’ll pull in the crowd to see
you, all right. Here’s fifty—the rest
later.”

  Chariot trembled with delight when he
took the money, more money than ever he
had seen all at once before. He promised
to be in the tent that evening.

  Then he sauntered on while he talked to
Joie. “So quick have all the wonderful
things happened, bon ami. Why did we
hide in the woods so long?”

  In his joy he gave small thought to the
analysis of his situation. Fortune was
flooding in on him. That was enough.

  He would have been puzzled if some-
body had pointed out that he had taken on
the trials and perils of life in the outside
world, along with the premiums. In the
few hours since he had leaped into the sun-
shine from the shadows of the woods of
Riviere du Loup he had become involved
in the coil which makes a drama of exist-
ence. He had made his fortune, so it
seemed to Chariot, he had won fame in a
world which had never heard of him till
then; only a moment ago the man in the
fine clothes had said everybody wanted to
see Chariot Belleau; but the drama of life
cannot be rounded out without an enemy.
However, Le Criquet was giving little
thought to the enemy. Had there not been
a wonderful victory ? That ended it.

  But the enemy, while the surgeon at-
tended to the hurt, gave all his thought to
Chariot.

  It was not malevolence which merely
flamed high and furiously, promising to
burn out soon. The fuel was too plentiful.
Moriarty, piecing his maledictions with a
few nouns and verbs, itemized his reasons
for getting the Canuck good and plenty.
Those reasons comprised about everything
which could make for implacable grudge.
Loss of prize money, loss of prestige, his
girl insulted without redress, an arm which
might keep him out of the ring for all
time. And all on account of a bouncing
bantam who fought with his feet!

  In the midst of the diatribe came Con-
nick, demanding fulfilment of the agree-
ment as to the return* of the forfeit money
10

which had been posted by both sides to
guard against a broken contract.

  Moriarty and his manager begged to be
allowed to take back their money. They
showed their empty pockets; they were flat
broke; they needed the money to get out
of town.

  Connick railed at a pugilist who was so
much of a fool as to risk the fortunes of all
concerned. He heartlessly insisted on the
terms of the contract.

  “I can only half square myself by get-
ting a new attraction. I’ve signed the
Quedaw for his song and dance stuff.”
Connick was not afraid of a pugilist with a
right arm in splints. “Even that shrimp
will draw a bigger crowd than you can pull
after this, Moriarty.”

  “Get me a gun,” the fighter commanded
the manager, when they were alone. “I’ll
shoot that Canuck when he steps into the
ring tonight.”

  “Want to get hung on top of all the
rest ?” sneered the manager. “What you’ll
do is give me your watch and that diamond
ring. We’ll cash in and buy railroad tick-
ets. I’m no good at hiking.”

   “I’ll have you arrested if you touch ’em!
I’m going to stick around in this section till
I can eat a bantam—broiled!” declared the
fighter, grinding his teeth.

  “Stay if you want to. You’re no good
to me any more. Hope you’re hung. I’ll
sell my own watch and get out. Good-
by!”

  Alone, sneaking into a rear seat that
night, Moriarty watched Chariot dance and
heard the simple songs.

  He growled his disgust.

  And the crowd in general did not seem
to be entertained, particularly. That men
were there to see the second-rate fighting,
such as it was, did not serve entirely as an
excuse for their lack of interest. It was a
tame performance, there in the big tent—
Chariot’s untrained voice and the faint
squeaking of the violin. Their curiosity
regarding this man who had felled the
mighty Moriarty was soon appeased.

  Those songs and the music of the violin
belonged in the open, demanded pictur-
esque settings and the air of the unconven-
tional—such as when Chariot came danc-
ing down the lea, sincere and unstudied in
his exuberance. The men and the women
of the motor cars, caught by the spirit of
the thing, had been the right kind of an
audience.

  Chariot frowned when the men in the
tent yelled for him to kick high and show
how he licked Moriarty. When they
34

SHORT STORIES

drowned out his music by their clamorous
demand that he fight somebody, Connick
stopped the show and gave Chariot the rest
of the money agreed on.

  So Chariot went out into the night. He
was not a bit discouraged. The money
was in his pocket. Those men who wanted
everybody to fight, who were they to judge

his songs?

 “They are
only fools, Jo-
ie,” he assured
the dog. “We
are the wise
ones. We get
much money;
now we- go to
find much
more where the
folks hate fighting, as you and I do.”

  Moriarty, slipping out behind, loomed in.
the darkness when he hurried to intercept
Chariot. “I can’t do to you what I want to
do, not here, not now. But I’m going to
do it later. I’m a fair fighter, Canuck!
They have always said that about me. I
don’t dare to talk about what’s happened.
I’d lose myself and go blooey! All is, look
out for yourself. I’m going to get you
good and plenty.”

  “I'll fight no more with you,” insisted
Chariot.

  “It ain’t going to be as you say! You’ve
had your square steer from me. After
this, any kind of a punch goes, see ? That
was a mouthful when you said it—‘you
have your way to fight, I have mine.’ And
there won’t be any more talk. I ain’t
much of a talker.”

  He marched away into the shadows.

  Just as he had dodged lightly from un-
der discouragement in the tent, so now did
Chariot put off dismay, shrugging his
shoulders. As ever, he made a confidant
of his dog.

  “Un coup sur la tcte, Joie! One, two,
three fine cracks on his head did I give him.
His wits are still rattling. Pooh! He’ll
forget after his sleep.”

  Chariot’s emotions were quick, tricksy,
shuttling; he could not understand the na-
ture of Moriarty’s one track mind—the
tenacity of a bulldog grip on a grudge.

  So Chariot, forgetting all troubles in the
pleasing dreams of the night, went gaily
about his projects the next morning, with
money burning in his pockets. He was
wholly absorbed—he did not even show es-
pecial interest in the ominous shadowing
by his declared foe.

  Moriarty drew his own conclusions from

what he saw of Chariot’s doings; the Ca-
nuck was stocking up for a return to the
woods.

  For Chariot was buying recklessly. Not
necessaries! Le Criquct, in his Gallic
flareback, intended to make Elie, Flore and
the children happy with the things his own
nature suggested—buying what he himself
had always longed for in the forest. A
talking machine first, with many songs and
jolly tunes. Pictures, too, and lace cur-
tains for the windows of the log house—
it should be made pretty. And plenty of
ribbons and some gay fabrics for Flore and
the children; then a generous sprinkling of
knickknacks and gewgaws.

  Moriarty saw in these purchases proba-
ble material for some of Chariot’s adven-
tures among the woodland queens and the
thought suggested Elisiane; then his grouch
grew more bitter. The girl had flouted
him that morning, having no more use for
a maimed and discredited champion. Feel-
ing sure that he understood what Char-
iot’s future movements would be, and
knowing he could locate his prey in the
Riviere du Loup woods, Moriarty went to
the village inn to ease his aching arm.

  Chariot, making several trips to Josue’s
little booth, deposited his wrapped treas-
ures and secured the old man’s grudging
consent to deliver them.

  Josue hefted the various bundles and
estimated them as shrewdly as their wrap-
pings would permit. “If it’s foolishness
I will not take them. If it’s food for their
hungry mouths in the woods, it’s my duty
to carry them, even if they have been
bought with money not honestly earned.”

  “It’s all food, good Josue,” pledged
Chariot, carelessly flinging the lie—a lie
that would sweep in its wide arc, as so
many lies do, and deal disaster later on.

  But prudence prompted Chariot in the
matter of the grim Moriarty whose espion-
age had at last stirred apprehension during
the morning. “Joie, he’s a very black
cloud,” the master confided to the dog.
“If he follows us he will keep away the
good sunshine from us.”

  Therefore, Chariot sauntered slowly past
the inn, singing. From the corners of his
eyes he beheld the ugly face of his foe at
the window.

  Chariot trod briskly and openly 011 the
way back toward Riviere du Loup. When
he made sure, after; a few miles, that the
black cloud was not following, he took to
the fields and avoided St. Chrysostome in
his back tracks by a wide detour, going on
toward the great river of which he had

heard so much. He had only a few coins
to jingle in his pocket. But he was glad
because the pocket was so nearly empty, re-
flecting on the happiness he was sending
into the woods.

  Moriarty was taking his own time about
following. He remained in St. Chrysos-
tome for several days.

  He wanted to come across his foe later
in a place where there would be less haz-
ard of witnesses who could swear a man
into the hangman’s noose.

  The fact was, Moriarty was living in
sort of a nightmare. It had begun when a
gnat had vanquished him; it persisted in
his small mind, now that he had little else
to do except meditate on revenge. He had
been so high. Now he was nothing. The
loafers laughed at him when he ventured
forth from the inn.

  He wanted to hide himself away from
ridicule. The forest would be a refuge,
at any rate. And he had a grinding hank-
ering to come upon that Canuck in the
woods.

  Moriarty paid his inn reckoning and set-
tled with the surgeon and fared forth for
the woods of Riviere du Loup.

IV

HOPE for his fortune and faith in
his way of getting it died hard in
Chariot. But he came at last to
know that fortune is fickle when one de-
pends on favor instead of toil. He re-
flected on what old Josue had said and ad-
mitted that many years make for practical
wisdom. And he realized, too, that his lit-
tle songs and his dances belonged in the
open instead of in the saloons of Levis by
the waterside.

  The autumn frosts had come and there
was no longer any hope of interesting the
passers along the broad highway. Their
ears were muffled and they hurried. In
the saloons indifferent men threw him pen-

nies. Such gifts were doles as if he were
a beggar. It was not pay for honest music.

  Chariot confessed to Joie that he was
ashamed. The world was not at all what
it had seemed to be on that first day of
sunshine.

    10

  The clouds came dragging across the
skies and the rains lashed the great river.
Chariot sought for employment, but in the
big town he found no work for the un-
skilled ; there were no trees to be cut
down; in the way of tools he knew only
the ax.

  To get bread for himself and a bone for
the dog he went the rounds of the taverns.

  Seeing so many men, he at last saw David
Roi who was headed toward the Mistas-
sini country in the north because the trap-
ping in the region of Riviere du Loup was
no longer good. David talked with Char-
iot. But the trapper stumbled awkwardly
in his speech, looked aslant at the young
man and mumbled when Chariot put eager
questions about Elie and Flore and the
children.

  At last David became snappily wroth,
showing the air of one who thinks he is
being mocked. “Why do you make be-
lieve you don’t know the bad thing what
has happened ?”

  Chariot’s goggling eyes and open mouth
and paling face served as mute appeal and
for proof that he did not know.

  Roi blurted his facts ruthlessly. “Your
brother is in jail for murder. And you
didn’t know that, hey ?”

  “No!” gasped Chariot.

  “Sacre! You have been about here and
there,” Roi waved his arm, “and you don’t
hear that news so much talked about!”

  “I sing and dance. I talk so little with
men,” wailed the other.

  “Lc Criquet! Always so busy about
your foolishness,” scoffed the trapper.
“Well, ’tis said your brother shot and
killed Munson, the traveling paymaster
for the crews of the Three Rivers Timber
Company. For his money, so they say.”
Chariot swayed on his feet and sat
down at the little table opposite Roi, in the
saloon. “But Elie did not do that—by the
sacred thunder, no!”

  “Oh, I do not much believe in it myself,”
agreed Roi, setting down his glass, “but it
shows up bad against him, and he cannot
hire the smart law chaps to hunt up the
proof that it’s not so. Elie needed money;
so many mouths to feed after you left him
sick and in the lurch. And then they
found in his camp so many things he could
never earn money to buy. There was a

talking machine and-”

  “I know,” mumbled Chariot, groping for
the words, trembling, all but fainting. “I
bought those things myself. I sent them
by Josue Laliberte. He knows. Why has
he not spoken out?”
36

SHORT STORIES

  “He says you sent only things for them
to eat. He swears that’s so—you told
him that.”

  The lie—how wickedly it had dealt with
the little family in the woods!

  “So they are keeping Elie in the jail at
St. Francois,” said David, naming the
county seat nearest the woods of Riviere
du Loup. “They will have his trial soon.
I think they will hang him; he is only a
poor man and the Three Rivers Company
is rich. Poor men can’t hire smart law-
yers. And Elie had too many fine things
in his camp—more than a poor man could
explain away.”

  Then Roi went along on his journey be-
cause the bell was ringing at the Levis
ferry house. He was in a hurry to go
north before the big snows came.

  Chariot stood up and sifted through his
fingers the few coins in his pocket. He
bargained with men in the saloon for the
sale of his violin. One of them bought
it; but he was not willing to give much.
The sum was not enough to buy a ticket to
St. Francois, so Chariot learned when he
went to the wicket of the railroad station.

  He looked down into the plaintive, sym-
pathizing eyes of Joie.

  “A nice dog,” said the man behind the
wicket. “I see you need more money.
I’ll buy him.”

  Chariot had long trod the road of sacri-
fice. It had been hard to do so in the
woods. He had rebelled, and now see
what had happened! His simple mind
found rightful punishment in his present
plight. He had leaped out into the sun-
shine to follow the tempting ways of ease
and selfish delight. And now Elie was in
prison because Chariot had been thought-
less as he always had been in spite of re-
proach. Chariot was in a mood to do his
penance to the bitter dregs. “I must get
the money, m’sieu’, you may have my
dog.”

  The man paid and came out with a rope
and dragged the dog away.

  Chariot was glad because his tears
blurred his vision; he could not see Joie
in the mist. He shut out the dog’s pitiful
cries, hands over ears, and hurried to the
waiting train.

  It went jerking slowly out of the sta-
tion; it halted soon for a switch to be
turned.

  Chariot, close to the door m the smok-
ing car, suddenly beheld an eager, appeal-
ing face at the door through the dingy
glass; the dog was on his hind legs and
was pawing at the glass. The master

rushed and opened the door and received
Joie in his arms as the train started on.

  “You must put that dog in the baggage
car,” said the surly conductor.

  “Yes, m’sieu’! I’ll go there and stay
with him, if you’ll allow.”

  “Suit yourself!”

  “Thank you.”

  So Chariot rode, sitting on the floor in a
dark corner, the dog’s head on his knees.
Joie kept whining softly while Chariot
sobbed, unknotting the broken rope from
the dog’s collar. “We have not been hon-
est with the man who paid the money,
Joie. But I cannot take you back to him
now. I must hurry to Elie at St. Fran-
cois. You and I, we broke our ropes to
run away—and it’s bad, very bad, Joie!”

V

IN ST. FRANCOIS, trotting along the
street toward the jail, Chariot felt the
goad of desperate resolve. He was
taking on himself the responsibility for
Elie’s plight; therefore, he was on fire
with zeal. He would smash the walls of
that jail, he would get Elie out!

  But by the time he was inside those
walls—he had begged so frantically to be
allowed to see his ■ brother—the sight of
bars and bolts and clanking keys and iron
doors had thoroughly bashed in him hope
and spirit. He had never seen a jail be-
fore; he had not dreamed that such pains
were taken to pen prisoners.

  He wept with the abandon of a child
when they brought Elie into the guard-
room. Elie was a woeful figure. The
poignant worry for a wife and children,
left to make shift for themselves in the
woods, had prostrated him more piteously
than the illness aggravated by this con-
finement which wore cruelly upon a man
accustomed to the open.

  “Elie, you will die unless I get you out,”
wailed Chariot.

  The guard growled and searched the
visitor’s pockets all over again. “No more
talk about getting a prisoner out—or out
you go, yourself, my fine fellow!”

  They allowed Elie and Chariot to sit on
two chairs which were held three feet
apart by an iron rod.

  “I have been thinking much, EHe,” whis-
pered Chariot. “We have good friends in
the woods. There are the Beaulieus, the
L’Abbes and many more. Ill bring them
here; we’ll find some way to break through
and take you out.”

  "No, I would not have it happen that
way,” protested the prisoner. “I never
THE CRICKET

37

could go home. That’s all I want—only to
go home. Could I be happy, running and
dodging and hiding here and there in the
world ?”

  “I had not thought about that part,”
mourned Chariot.

  Elie’s temper flared. After being strick-
en with grief for so long he needed the re-
lief of righteous anger, and here in his
presence was the real culprit, according to
Elie’s indignant belief. “You never do
any thinking about sensible things, Le
Criquet! Did you think before sending us
all those things which Josue brought?”
“Yes, I thought how happy they would
make you and Flore and the children.”
“And what do you think now, seeing all
the trouble those folderols have piled on
us ?”

  “I can tell the truth to the law men,
EHe!”	^

  “But honest Josue sticks to what you

told him. You
are my broth-
er, and they’ll
say that now
you lie to save
me.”

  “Oh, Elie,
they must set
you free —
they’ll find you
did not do any
bad thing!”
“The law has its paid men to fasten the
thing on me. I have no money to hire
those who can find the truth for my sake.”
“I have a little money in my pocket. I’ll
give it all to you.”

  “No! I’ll not take it. If you have
money carry it to Flore. Go to her quick-
ly, Chariot. I stay awake all the nights,
so crazy it makes me to think the children
may be hungry.”

  After a pitiful silence, the prisoner con-
tinued. “Why have you been so long in
coming? Why did you not hurry to Ri-
viere du Loup?”

  “I heard only this very day! David
Roi told me in Levis. Now,” Chariot de-
clared stoutly, “that job of finding the
truth for your sake is mine.”

  He spoke almost joyously. He might be
able to serve and to repair his fault, after
all!

  “I tell you, you shall not,” commanded
Elie. “Then Flore and the children will
have nobody to work for them. Promise
me, Chariot, you will go to them as quick
as you can, work for them, think only of
them. If they keep me here, away from
10

the woods and my home in this slow jus-
tice, I shall die. But don’t let me live in
hell by not knowing you at least are with
them. What would they do without you?
Promise me, Chariot. You owe me that
much to pay for your thoughtlessness.
See! I call it by no worse name.”

  So Chariot promised in order to soothe
an anguished soul. But he knew, when he
looked on his brother’s wan face and
realized what confinement would do, that
again he was swearing to a lie. Ready
to do penance, he would have gladly taken
his brother’s place in prison, enduring sto-
ically. In his thoughts, seeing only conse-
quences, he was insisting on his soul guilt
in bringing about the catastrophe. He felt
he must solve the mystery of the real mur-
derer, and expiate that guilt.

  This dread punishment of the innocent
roused in him a tumult of emotions, and
when the time of his visit was up he went
stumbling out to join Joie whimpering at
the iron gate.

VI

TO CHARLOT’S credit was it that
he walked from the open fields back
into the shadows of the woods of
Riviere du Loup without regret. He was
even glad because he was again among the
sturdy trees, and they seemed to be pro-
tectors instead of sullen soldiers who
barred his way.

  His return struck a fleeting fire of joy
from the flint of woe, when he flung open
the door of the log house. But dolor and
tears quickly dashed out the flash of joy.

  Flore had no harsh words for him; out
of her own volatile temperament she had
always understood Chariot and had sympa-
thized with his fancies. Her only refer-
ence to the incriminating gifts was in her
appeal to him to take them away and sell
them. “You meant all for the best, Char-
iot, but I cannot look at them any more.”
So he went the rounds of the settle-
ment’s scattered houses and sold all the
articles, though some of the folks shud-
dered a bit as if they were trafficking with
things bought by blood; but, on the other
hand, they avowed their belief in the inno-
cence of Elie.

  Chariot’s real stumbling block was Josue
Laliberte, whittling at toys like a Santa
Claus and shaking his head and wagging
his white beard. “No, Chariot, I shall
stick to what you told me was in the
wrapped packages. I am one who prays
to the saints and I could not kneel with a
lie on my soul.”
3«

SHORT STORIES

  “But Elie has been nowhere to buy such
things.”

  The old man squinted inimically at the
rattle-brain who had sauced him -so many
times. “Oho! So say you who do not
know? Well, Elie borrowed my horse
and cart. To go to the Ornis tract after
stock for his ax handles and yokes, so
he said! And a day or so later the body
of the paymaster was found in the woods
where it had been lying under the fallen
trees for a week or more. So, you see,
you don’t know all things, you who have
your wits in your toes instead of in your
noddle.”

  “And you’ll say all that at the trial, will
you?’ demanded Chariot hotly.

  “I don’t tell any lies,” returned Josue,
creasing with his sharp tool a simper into a
doll’s face.

  Chariot yanked the grinning toy from
the maker’s hand and flung the taunting
image violently into a corner of the shop.
It was only partial satisfaction of his ire;
but he could not bring himself to cuff the
ears of a man so old as Josue.

  This sensible control of rampant desire
brought a reward to the Cricket, of a sort.
Old Josue came to the door and called to
Chariot when he was stamping away across
the yard of the shop.

  Josue crooked an inviting finger and
winked significantly and the young man
obeyed the summons, returning in a sullen
mood.

  The old man was more amiable; he had
satisfied his pique; he had, as he put it to
himself, set the bumptious young chap
where he belonged. “But you know I’m
sorry for Elie. He has had to put up with
so much from others, not calling names. I
don’t think he killed the paymaster, even if
he had the chance to do it, but the law puts
much weight on a killer having the chance
and needing money.”

  “Of course, Elie did not kill a' man,”
stormed the brother.

  “I always stick to the truth, though it
may be bad for others. Now I give you
some more truth. I, too, was after hard
wood one day in the Omis tract. I heard a
gun shot. Then I heard two men having a
great fight with tongues and fists. So I
hid in a tree, to be safe.

  “Then, in a little while, I saw one man
go limping, his face all bloody. Ah, he
had a fine whipping! Then I saw another
man go off another way. It was the big
fighter-man. Ah, you made a fine fool of
yourself with him at the fair!”

  “Then you must go to the law-men—you

must say all that at the trial,” urged Char-
iot with fire.

  The crafty old man winked. He shook
his head. “Those two wicked men are still
loose in the world. I do not run the
risk!”

  “And my poor brother is locked up and
cannot harm you when you swear against
him ! You’re a bad old man, Josue!”

  “I’m old and feeble and I cannot fight
bad men who are loose.”

  “How about your truth-telling you brag
so proudly about?”

  “If I must lie at times to save myself
from harm, then I do my penance as the
cure orders. That is all I have to say to
you, Le Cnquet! You go find those two
bad men and make them tell what is the
truth. That’s a fine job for you. That
you can save your brother—as you ought,
after getting him into such a mess.”

  Josue slammed the door of his shop and
dropped the bar.

  Le Criquet looked out into the sunshine
above the trees and got no comfort from
the glory.

  Two bad men to search down and from
them wrench the truth!

  He was glad because one was Moriarty.
As a creature moved always by impulse,
he instantly plunged into the quick belief
that the savage swaggerer who would fight
in the ring only for money would do almost
anything else for money. He lashed him-
self into full belief that Moriarty had killed
the paymaster. It was' good to have one
object on which to center all his furious
attempt to save his own people. Thus,
two men were abroad in the world, both
filled with the spirit of vengeance.

  The sale of the incriminating articles had
brought enough money so that the children
would not be hungry while a search for the
truth could be made in the world, and
Chariot gave all the money into Flore’s
hands.

  Then he put himself to asking many sly
questions in addition to those he had al-
ready put as he made the rounds.

  Yes, the big man had been seen in the
woods of Riviere du Loup, here and there,
many times. He said he had grown to
like the woods, excusing his staying on.
When the splints were off his arm he had
practiced with the ax. Then he had hired
as a chopper. From one and another
Chariot gleaned these bits of information.
It was guessed, rather than known, that the
big man had hired for the Megantic cut-
tings. He was very sly in his going away;
he had not told anybody what he intended

                                                      10
THE CRICKET

to do. But such a blustering, cursing man
would be likely to pick upon the Megantic
cuttings, so the talk ran, because wild Jock
Britten was boss of a camp there and in-
vited just such
savage men as
Moriarty seemed
to be. It was the
boast of Britten
that he liked to
welcome law-
breakers because
that kind would
be obliged to stay
with him and
work. They were
safe with him, he
declared to all,
therefore his attitude was well known in all
the region. He boasted that never had his
crew allowed a law officer to take out a man
from his camp.

  All this did Chariot learn—and he had
heard of Jock Britten’s vicious crews.

  Nevertheless, he went down to the edge
of the woods of Riviere du Loup, to the
hiring-office of the Megantic company, and
presented himself with his ax and made the
chips fly handsomely when he tackled the
much-hackled test stump at command of
the agent.

  “You’ll do,” said the man. “I always
like a really spry Frenchman for the
woods. You may take your pick of our
four camps. There’s Jock Britten’s-”

  “I’ll go there!”

  “You’ll be in a tough gang, young fel-
low. There’s even a prize-fighter who
wants to tackle every newcomer so as to
keep his muscle up.”

  “But I’ll go, if you’ll allow.”

  “Suit yourself,” said the man carelessly.

  Then Chariot pleaded the cause of Flore
and the children and asked for an advance
of wages.

  “Well, if you haven’t broken a law and
don’t need Jock’s camp as a hiding place,
I may as well nail you to the job by an
advance,” assented the agent.

  Chariot hurried back to Flore with the
money; he gave her a written order to go
to the agent for more of his wages as
earned. Perhaps he would be obliged to
work for a long time. It might not be
easy to get very soon what he wanted from
Moriarty, but he felt glad that he could
be on his trail, and still keep his promise to
his brother. He said nothing at all to
Flore about the big man, and she perceived
only the natural thing in his hiring as a
chopper.

       10

  He went away with the grateful kisses
of the family on his lips.

  He was able to leap gaily and send them
back a cheerful laugh before he turned into
the lane of the big trees.

VII

IT WAS not gay, that trudging for so
many miles along tote-roads and by
tortuous trails.

  The skies were slatey and there were
hard, steel-gray banks in the south, promis-
ing the first snows very soon. And at the
end of the trail, so Chariot knew, would be
waiting something very grim and grisly.

  He looked over his shoulder every little
while. The trunks of the trees crowded
themselves together, so it seemed, making
serried ranks to close in, to shut off his re-
treat. But more and more the hatred for
Moriarty burned in him, and he fed the
fire with fuel of assurances to himself that
the enemy must have done the deed which
had brought so much woe on Elie and the
family.

  He came upon other men who were
bound, from here and there, into the Me-
gantic cuttings. They warned him sym-
pathetically when he said he was heading
for Britten’s camp. This one and that,
sheering off the trail to Britten’s, urged
him to come along.

  “You’re a little chap. You seem to be
a good man. Those bad fellows will eat
you up.”

  But he lifted his chin valorously and
kept on.

IT SEEMED quiet enough when Char-
iot came into Britten’s clearing just
as the twilight was settling into black
darkness; he had trotted for several miles
in order to distance the night.

  He was panting for breath when he pre-
sented himself before Britten in the office
camp, and tendered his credential slip
from the agent.

  “You sure act like a willing chap, Ca-
nuck, running to get here to your job; you
may not be so glad you’re here—a fellow
of your size,” averred the grim Britten.
“But maybe you’re like all the rest—ready
to run their legs off so as not to miss a
meal.”

  He put the paper in his wallet. “And
what are you running away from? Who
have you killed ?”

  “I have never hurt anybody! I’m an
honest man, m’sieu’.”

  “You don’t fit in this gang then! But I
see the agent has nailed you by an advance.
40

SHORT STORIES

If you try to run away from me you’re a
goner. Remember that! You’re here to
work out your time, Canuck, no matter
what kind of a razz you get from the
gang.”

  The cookee’s shrill call cut the silence
outside. “Gru-u-u-b on the ta-a-a-able!
Who-o-o-oo! Grub on the table!”

  “Better hustle in and get your setting!
Else you’ll have to dab and pick over
somebody’s shoulder.”

  But Chariot disobeyed his first command
from Britten, delaying about entering the
meal camp.

  When the young chap was out in the
darkness, trepidation shook him. Warn-
ings—warnings, it had all been warnings!
Even Joie was whining now at his feet.

  Had this been merely his own affair—
only himself to suffer—he would have
slunk away into the night, and he knew it!

  But limned there before his staring eyes
was the memory-picture of his brother,
wan and shattered, surely to be killed by
confinement in the slow course of justice,
and the uncertainty of a murder charge
unless Chariot made his best haste.

  “No!” he said to Joie. “By the good
God, I will stay here to do what can be
done!”

  But he lingered many minutes in the
shadow of one of the horse hovels, before
he could gather courage to go into the pres-
ence of the crew.

  Joie dodged in at the master’s heels and
went to take a patient post in a corner,
waiting for a dole.

  Chariot stood for a few moments, meek-
ly surveying the double rows of eaters at
the long table, searching for a crevice
where he might squeeze in. The men
grinned and muttered and shouldered to-
gether on the benches. Evidently they in-
tended that any newcomer should “make
his bigness” by a show of prowess of some
sort.

  But Chariot was more interested in a foe
than in food. His eyes sought and found
Moriarty. The young man was nerving
himself for instant trouble. He expected
to be assailed by oaths and threats. If
Moriarty had leaped across the table and
attacked then and there Chariot would not
have been surprised.

  But on the big man’s countenance, after
a twist of a queer, quick expression, there
was slowly creased a grin; anybody except
Chariot would have found it a friendly
smile. But Chariot believed he knew what
sort of ugly menace crouched behind that
smile and he found the grimace sinister.

However, Moriarty’s tone was welcom-
ing and hearty when he called to Chariot
to come around the table.

“And crowd over, you!” snapped Mori-

arty, roughly tipping over the men on
either side of him. “Where ’n’ ’ell’s your
manners, all of a sudden?”

  It was plain that the prize-fighter had
won his standing there in the camp. The
men hastened to move.

  “Step in here, stranger. Hurry up!”
commanded Moriarty when Chariot came
slowly. “You’ve got one friend in the
gang, you see.”

  The newcomer straddled over the bench
and, in spite of his test efforts to seem at
ease, he cringed beside the burly man who
kept up his grin, looking sidewise at the
chap he ostensibly befriended.

  Chariot had always dealt sparingly in
guile; he did not understand such methods.
This attitude of his foe wrought upon the
young man’s frank nature more cruelly
than curses and direct attack, which he
would have understood.

  Promptly all the others were interested
only in gobbling their food and gabbling
their clamor of talk. Table ware rattled
and voices were high. They paid no more
attention to the new man in the crew.

  Under cover of the noise Moriarty seized
his opportunity. “Didn’t know I was
here, hey? Some surprise for you, hey?”
Cbarlot was too much perturbed to do
crafty lying. And he had been finding lies
dangerous. “I knew I’d find you here,
m’sieu’. That’s why I have come.”

  A few minutes later there was a general
roar of laughter roused by a coarse story.

  “You didn’t come up here to get killed,
Canuck!” growled Moriarty, taking advan-
tage of the covert of hilarity. “What’s
your real reason for coming? Out with
it! You’ve come for a reason.” He laid
down his knife and fork and strove to bore
Chariot with a demanding stare. But after
a few moments his eyes wavered under
the steady gaze from the other. “You’ll
find out why I’m here! Yes, I think you
know already.”

  The fighter went back to his food, but

                                                      10

his hairy hands shook. He grew pale. He
glanced up and found Chariot’s eyes accus-
ing him.

  Something strange was working in Mo-
riarty, and Chariot perceived it. A man’s
level look and his few words had set the
something in motion.

  The two men went on with their food in
grim silence.

  ‘‘Hell, a dawg!” yelped the cookee, on
his way to the table with a big can of tea.
“Whose?” He knew perfectly well to
whom the dog belonged. But he was im-
pelled by an impish desire to rasp the new
man, to start something.

  “Who had the gall to bring a dog in
here where gents are eating?” shouted a
man, affecting great indignation. “Kick
that mutt out. cookee !”

  “It’s my dog,” cried Chariot. “If he is
not liked in here I’ll take him out.”

  “I order him kicked out,” insisted the
objector. “Then he’ll know better’n to
come in here again.”

  The cookee set the can on the table and
started toward Joie in the corner.

  Chariot leaped over the bench and made
all haste, intercepting the cookee, barring
the way with an arm. The cookee, a
husky young fellow, struck the arm down.
A chorus of voices declared for the kick-
ing. It was only a pretense of dislike for
the dog, of course. It was seizing an op-
portunity to set two young fellows at each
other for the sake of providing mealtime
entertainment; it was a chance to give a
new man some of the razz that was coming
to him.

  “You heard the orders, Quedaw!” blus-
tered the cookee. “And orders go for me.
Get out of the tote-ro’d!” He kicked at
Chariot in the way of practice. The
Cricket was not at a loss in all quick-as-
flash tactics. He grabed the swinging foot
and at the same time leaped forward and
with his free hand drove a staggering blow
under the cookee’s ear. With blow and
the quick hoist of the captive foot he
piled the attacker heels over head and the
cookee fell with a violence that knocked
breath and sense out of him. Chariot
stood over him when he opened his eyes.
“Is it enough ?” demanded the victor.

  “I guess so,” admitted the cookee, get-
ting up stiffly. When he went limping
back to his duties he called to Moriarty.
“You haven’t been giving me any line on
that kind of fighting in your lessons.”
“Don’t you dare to call them tricks by
the name of fighting,” roared Moriarty in
protest. “The damnation Canuck!”

     10

  “Hi! Look-a-here, Big ’Un,” admon-
ished one of the crew. “What has hap-
pened to that friendship all of a sud-
den?”

  With difficulty, bethinking himself, Mo-
riarty managed to work rage out of his con-
torted features and substituted his grin.
“Oh, it makes me mad to see ring rules
knocked a-hooting! No matter who does
it. But as to my new friend—Canuck, I
adopt your pup along with you. Come
over here and get him a plate of grub.”
He pounded his fist on the table when men
muttered. “Being a friend of mine, that
dog is classy enough to eat over there in
the corner. What I say goes! See?”

  But the other men continued to mutter,
apart from Moriarty, when they were back
in the bunk house. It was plain enough
that the prize-fighter had won his way
there by violence and not by inspiring any
liking.

  “He’s gitting too cocky,” averred a
critic. “Always wanting his own way, no
matter how the rest of us feel. Now that
he’s fell so much in love with Frencliy,
he’ll prob’ly try to stall us off if we want to
give the freshie the reg’lar Britten bazoo!”

  “We ain’t going to break the biggest
camp law only to please Moriarty,” said a
man, and he was endorsed in his stand by
all.

  “And this special bazoo will need to be
a boomer,” declared the spokesman, his
voice incautiously loud. “Else the freshie
will think he’s running the place because he
has licked the cookee.”

  Moriarty overheard. He came thrust-
ing forward. “Nothing doing. See?
There ain't going to be a bazoo for the new
chap.”

  “Why not ?” was the surly query. Men
swapped a lot of understanding, scowling
at each other, saying no word. This bump-
tious Moriarty, fairly new in camp him-
self, was certainly doing too much boss-
ing! “Why not?” was the general de-
mand, now that the issue had been made.

  Moriarty merely cursed them. His ideas
were somewhat mixed just then. He
realized that he was having some difficulty
in explaining to himself just why he in-
tended to keep the young fellow from the
hazards of a bazoo. Now that they were
making plans for a “boomer” in order to
teach the newcomer a lesson, the hazards
were real. A poor chap had been killed
only a few days before in the Britten camp
—a death reported out to the authorities
as an ordinary tripped-timber casualty;
but hands had slipped from the edges of
42

SHORT STORIES

the horse blanket in which the fellow was
tossed.

  Moriarty did not intend to have his man
subjected to any such perils. Just then his
notions were confused—but he venomously
declared that what he said went! This
career-wrecker, this fellow who just stirred
in Moriorty a still mightier tumult of
emotions by a few simple words and an
accusatory stare, was not meat for amuse-
ment of that gang of
roisterers. Moriarty
had serious business
of his own with the
man who, on top of
all the rest, had in-
vaded the sancitity
of the law-defying
refuge.

  Moriarty was in a
frame of mind to
mix it with the
whole of them; by
getting his ferocity out of his system in
that manner he could content himself to
take his own good and torturous time with
the single victim. “I tell you, nothing do-
ing. And that’s why not!”

  “How many of us do you think you can
lick all at once, Moriarty?” asked a man
vengefully.

  “All of you. Come on!” He backed
to the wall of the camp, rolling up the
sleeves of his mackinaw.

  His constant assumption of more and
more authority in the camp had made him
feared and had won for him a standing.
But the grouch against him had been slowly
developing. His sneer when he declared
he would meet all of them suddenly torched
the laid tinder of the grudge. They massed
for a concerted attack; then they thought
of better strategy and spread out in knots
of two and three.

  “I’m going to punch to kill,” roared Mo-
riarty.

  Rage now whirled in him like a torch.
He did not wait for their onslaught. He
dove away from the wall, the scattered
knots suggesting his opportunity to him.
He struck down men right and left before
they had a chance to herd. Their blows
glanced off him as he leaped here and there.
He picked up victims whom he had
knocked down and made missiles of their
bodies, hurling them against his grouping
assailants. Then he flung himself back to
the wall to gain a respite, panting, sweat-
ing, cursing.

  There was quick, mumbled conference
among the men who were left standing.

There was malignant, ruthless agreement.
Moriarty was using his tongue on them,
threatening to kill. “I’ve got a right to do
anything, with these odds,” he yelled.
“And I’ll do it! So help me!” He
stooped quickly and picked up an oak sap-
ling. It was the poker for the barrel
stove. The stick had been kicked about
the room in the struggle.

  The men rushed on him in a concerted
attack, the leaders carrying a long deacon
seat as a shield. He struck over the
shield, knocking down man after man.

  It was a dizzying swirl of struggling
fighters, a piling forward, a tangle of re-
treat and new charges; nobody could see
what the other man was doing.

  All at once there was a porcine shriek
from Moriarty. “I’m stuck! You’ve got
me. I’m knifed! Hell on this kind of
fighting!”

  Instantly the crowd fell away from him;
it was a tumult of retreat; the guilty man
and the innocent associates were equally
anxious to avoid the responsibility for a
dirty trick.

  Moriarty fell on the floor and writhed,
screaming for aid.

  Chariot had held aloof from the struggle.
He was poised on a bunk, holding on to a
stanchion.

  Anguished fear swept through him now.
Was he to lose this man on whom all the
desperate hopes were placed? That was
his first thought—his initial spur to action.
Then he felt something like pity for this
wretch abandoned to his fate. At any
rate, the big man had been brave, taking on
such odds.

  Chariot leaped from the bunk, drag-
ging his belt from its loops. He flung
himself beside his enemy. Blood soaking
through the trousers below the knee gave
the Samaritan his grim hint for action.
He dragged up the loose cloth and applied
the tourniquet of the belt. He twisted it
taut with all his strength while the victim
wailed. The limb had been cruelly
slashed. Chariot’s poor knowledge of sur-
gical aid stopped there. He pleaded with
the other men. They shook their heads.
They did not know how to do anything
else, more than Chariot had done.

  “You send for a doctor, to save his life,
yes?” was the young man’s eager plea to
Britten. But the boss, like his men, shook
his head.

  “You will let me go? I will go. Yes!”

  “Don’t leave me, Canuck; they mean to
get me!” quavered Moriarty. He set
trembling hands around Chariot’s leg. All

at once he had become broken and full of
fear. In the revulsion of his emotions he
made the strange choice of his enemy as

his aid and pro-
tector ; there was
nobody else to
whom he could
appeal. “T a k e
me out of here,
Canuck. Take
me to a doctor.”
“That’s a good
idea,” affirmed
one of the men.
The cookee,
bringing more wood for the barrel stove,
flung open the bunk house door. A whirl
of snow followed him in; the promise of
the slatey-gray cloudbanks had been kept.

  “The devil isn’t playing in with his pet
on this thing,” sneered a man. “He has
sent a snow-storm—and you’d better not
to tackle it, Canuck.”

  “M’sieu’, the good God has sent the
snow,” declared Chariot. “It’s to make
the runners of the sled slip all fine!”

  “Yes, if you can find your way,” said
Britten. “But you can’t find it, Frenchy.
No man can do it.”

  “Perhaps a man cannot, m’sieu’.” Char-
iot leaned and patted Joie’s head; the dog
had come sidling close to his master. “But
here I have my good friend who knows
how better than any man.”

  The hostile individual who had mum-
bled, and who had protested against the
going, shuffled near. Chariot was bend-
ing over Moriarty, buttoning the mack-
inaw.

  “Watch him! Don’t let him get near
me, son,” whispered the victim. “Damn
him, he knifed me. That’s Dawse Wad-
den. Remember him—he stuck me!”
Chariot appealed to the crew, kneeling
beside his charge and protecting him. The
volunteer asked for a sled, for a lantern,
for blankets.

  A few moments later Moriarty had been
wrapped in the blankets and was laid on
the moose sled. By Chariot’s direction
the lantern was slung from the dog’s collar.

  Then into the night and thrusting
through the storm went the little expedi-
tion.

VIII

HARLOT did not mark the hours
and was only guessing at time.

  But he knew he was very weary
and he was glad to stop when Moriarty
begged to be eased on the sled. “And I’m

all of a chill, son. I guess I’m dying.

  “I think it’s the cold of the night,
m’sieu’, and because you lie so still on the
sled. We shall help that feeling!”

  He broke dry limbs from the slash scat-
tered beside the tote-road and built a fire
at which he warmed his charge, turning the
heavy body tenderly so that it might be
soothed in all its parts by the heat. Then
he filled the big man’s pipe and held a
flaming twig to the tobacco.

  “I guess I ain’t going to die if we get
to that doctor in time,” admitted the
wounded man, now finding solace in his
pipe. “I’ll stand the ache. I won't
whine any more.”

  Chariot crouched at the fire beside the
dog. The young man was silent, trying
to straighten out his thoughts. He had his
man at last, to be sure, but he had not won
his victory by any real effort of his own.
The prisoner had delivered himself, beg-
ging like a child to be helped. After all,
so ran Chariot’s thoughts, it would be
something like betraying a trust if he de-
livered this man to the law. And Chariot
realized that he possessed none of the ac-
tual knowledge which the stern law would
require. Puzzlement and a sense of honor
were curiously mingled in his thoughts.

  Moriarty suddenly started to speak. It
was startling in the silence and Cliarlot
jumped; the other had so surely hit upon
the sensitive spot. “Well, son, you’ve got
what you came to Britten’s to get. You’ve
got me. Now what are you going to do
with me, after the doctor mends me up into
something you can use?”

  “I don’t know, m’sieu’.”

  “Well, what do you know, anyway?
You handed me a dam’ queer lodk when
we were sitting at table tonight! What’s
the big idea of chasing me to Britten’s?”
“I’m trying to get my poor brother out
of the jail wbere he’s dying.”

  “And you reckon on putting me into
that jail in his place, do you?”

  Chariot was glad because he had been
doing some thinking on the problem; he
was able to declare himself honestly. “No,
m’sieu’! I have no right to do that. I
really know nothing about you—about any
good reason for putting you in the jail.
But I have a better reason of my own.
You have put yourself in my hands, man
to man. I have been thinking much about
that, m’sieu’. I have lived all my life in
the woods. They make a man honest—
except at Britten’s camp, perhaps!” he
added with bitterness.

  “Gawd!” ejaculated Moriarty, finding
44

SHORT STORIES

no other words for the expression of his
emotions.

  Once more Chariot harnessed himself to
the thongs of the sled, bent his shoulders
to the burden and they went on.

  The patient dog trudged ahead, swing-
ing the beacon from his collar.

  Now the sky began to match the color
of the snowflakes—the night graying into
the white of dawn. Chariot patted Joie’s
head and puffed out the lantern-light.

  “How about this brother of yours, son?”
demanded Moriarty thickly. “And how
about yourself, too, for that matter ?”

  So Chariot told.

  And simply and innocently he revealed
the heart of a child-man—his hopes, his
dreams, his disappointment, his repentance.

THE sunshine blessed them when
Chariot trudged, hauling his charge,
into the settlement at the fringe of
the forest.

  The surgeon, opening his door, was a
kindly man who allowed Chariot to puli
the sledge into the house.

  After the hurt had been repaired, the
Samaritan tugged the sledge out of doors
and gazed down compassionately on the
big man. “You’ll need much rest after
so bad hurt, m’sieu’. I’ll haul you to the
little inn.”

  “No, not yet,” growled Moriarty
through clenched teeth. He was still in
dreadful pain; the surgeon’s work had in-
volved agony. On the sufferer’s face
resolution was grooved into the furrows
set there by his ordeal. “Didn’t I see,
passing when we came, a sign on a house
down yonder ? The sign was 'Avocat ’
wasn’t it?”

  “Yes, m’sieu’.”

  “Means lawyer—notary—and all that

stuff, hey? All
right! Take me
there.”

 And Avocat
Bernier was as
kind as the sur-
geon had been,
he allowed the
sledge to be
drawn into his
sitting-room.

  The lawyer’s
wife was there.
Seeing her, Moriarty asked Chariot to
draw off tbe mackinaw which the fighter
had not pulled off, even in the stress of

 •	the combat in Britten’s camp. “Pull the
 stitches out of the lining, ma’am, if you’ll
 be so kind. Pick out what’s hidden in
 there.” He put up his hand, halting all
 else, until the woman began to pull out
 money, bill after bill; the mackinaw was
 lined with notes.

   Moriarty grunted his approbation when
the money was heaped on the table. “Now
get ready your ink and pen and paper, Mr.
Lawyer. I have a story to tell and to
swear to about seeing a man shoot Mun-
son, the paymaster. I’m no murderer.
But I ain’t any cheap squealer, either. I’m
guilty, too. I waited and beat that killer
up and took the money away from him.
That’s the cash, what she’s been taking out
of my jacket. I meant to keep that money,
even if I had to do worse to the killer. He
chased me into Britten’s camp. He was
laying for me. He thought he saw his
chance when he knifed me. That man is
named Dawse Wadden, Mr. Lawyer, and
you’d better start a dick with a little army
to get him—get him quick, if they have to
tear down Britten’s camp to get him. But
first take down what I have to say so I
can swear to it.”

   The notary, tense and white, hurried to
 get his writing materials.

   Moriarty rolled his head on the sledge
 rail and smiled on Chariot, who sat on the
 floor, aghast and trembling.

   “You see, son, you thawed it out of me.
 Remember how I bragged once away back
 that I was a square-shooter ? I didn’t half
 mean it; I was always handing out cheap
 bluff while I was thinking about what
 one helluva fellow I was in the world.
 You tackled me with a new one on me,
 son—a brand new twist. You couldn’t
 have pounded it out of me—what you
 came after. But you have thawed it out.
 And now I’ll go to jail and wait for the
 trial and take my medicine—whatever is
 coming to me. At any rate, I won’t have
 to be thinking about a poor devil dying in
 a jail or dancing on air, and leaving his
 wife and kids. Yes, sir. It was a great
 twist you put on me, son. Twice you have
 done it. Once with kicks, this time with
 kindness. Almost the only real touch of
 real friendship I’ve had from anybody in
 a fighting life. Suppose we shake!”

   Then, with Joie close-cuddled to him, his
 arms around the dog’s neck, Chariot sat
 on the floor of the little sitting-room and
 with tear-wet, staring eyes watched the pa-
 tient notary write down the wonderful
 words which would bring Elie home again.

PEAVEY WORK

By CLAY PERRY
Author of “Sides to A River,” “Boss of the River,” etc.

     HE WAS ONLY A BOY, AFTER ALL, EVEN THOUGH HE WAS IN CHARGE OF
     BOOM ONE DURING THE LOGGING DRIVE. AND WHEN HIS DOG WAS IN
     TROUBLE WITH A BLACK BEAR, IT WAS HARD FOR THE BOY IN HIM TO
     KNOW WHAT TO DO-EVEN THOUGH THE DRIVE HAD ITS ENEMIES

T.HEY’S only one thing you got
to look out for, Tod Raine.
That’s the links of them chain
couplings. You watch ’em.
You know, no chain is any
stronger’n its weakest link.”

  Slim Curtin, timber cruiser, who had
brought Tod Raine to Boom One on the
Rainy River four days ago stopped at
Tod’s lonely shanty on the north bank on
his return trip from the timber-cut camps
far above.

  “Humph!” Slim chuckled, after a mo-
ment, his weathered face crinkling about
the eyes in mirth. “Boss Whitney, he
don't believe in these ready-made proverbs,
though. Know what he said to me when
I asked him why he was settin’ a boy to
watch Boom One ?’’

  Tod shook his head and colored a trifle.
He expected some jibe at his youthfulness.
Tod was but sixteen, though in stature and
physical development he was a man. He
held a man-size peavey in his hands. Idly
he kicked at a boom-chain and sparks flew
from steel on iron. He wore heavy calked
boots, the sharp steel spikes projecting a
quarter of an inch to half an inch out of
the thick soles. He had qualified as a
seasoned river-driver a year ago.

  “Boss Whitney, he says, ‘A chain is
often stronger than the link that looks the
weakest’. Humph! Sort of a reverse
10

English twist to it, eh? I don’t see’s it’s
much different from the old one. Well,
you seen anybody movin’ around up here ?”
“Nobody. Nothing but porcupines and
skunks. But a black bear cut his nose 011
an old molasses can out behind the shanty
the first night after you left, Slim. I didn’t
even hear him, though and got no chance
at him.”

  “Where’s yer dawg?”

  “Well, that’s what worries me,” Tod
confessed. “Rip’s been missing ever since
yesterday morning, Slim. I reckon he’s
after that bear.”

  Something in Tod’s voice and face
caused Slim’s wise eyes to narrow. “Well,
you let Rip do all the bear hunting,” he
said. “If he meets up with one you’ll
know it all right.”

  This was one thing Tod feared—that
Rip had “met up” with the bear. As soon
as Slim had gone on his way down river
to where the Great Northern crew was at
work building the new dam, Tod fell to
calling and whistling for Rip. He knew
it was hopeless. The loud voice of the
river npuftled every other sound, drowned
out echoes; and the deep-drooping boughs
of hemlock and balsam formed a screen
along each shore, shutting the forest away
from the river.

  “Rip! Here Rip! Here, here, here!”
  Tod was in mid-stream, calling, balanc-

45

SHORT STORIES

ing himself on the teetering boom. There
was no sharp, glad bark, no rush of padded
feet along the stretch of spruce logs hewn
flat on the top, fashioned into a long
wooden barrier from one bank to the other.

  “Now, where is that doggone dog
gone?” he demanded of the wilderness—
and the wilderness remained discreetly
silent. It held its secrets close, Tod knew,
for he had solved some of them and his
wood-lore only made him the more re-
spectful. The greenhorn is indifferent to
the wilderness, but to the initiate it is a
many-paged book which grows more won-
derful and awesome as the leaves are
turned.

  “Doggone dog!” repeated Tod querul-
ously, then he smiled as the picture of the
dog came to him, that comical, wistful old-
mannish face of the airedale with its blunt
muzzle, wire hair standing out in whorls
and swirls about the eyes and the head,
like the shock-head of a roustabout. A
picture of rough and ready cocksure im-
pudence and wisdom. “He-e-ere Rip!”

  Tod took a quick turn on the boom and
walked it from one end to the other. It
was of double strength, each twenty foot
section made of two spruce logs cleated
together side by side with wooden pegs
which grew tighter as the water soaked
them. Heavy chains ran through ring-
bolts of thick iron driven into the end of
each of the log sections. The chains, of
half inch malleable iron, were made “end-
less” with patent lock links which could
be opened by driving out a steel rivet. It
was easy to replace weakened couplings
by this arrangement, and to break up the
boom, when necessary. The couplings
likewise gave the long boom more elas-
ticity, so that the shock of the battering
current and bumping logs would be ab-
sorbed.

  Tod’s job was to guard, day and night,
this stretch of boom across the Rainy—
with his life if necessary. Not that any-
one believed such desperate defense would
be necessary, Tod least of all. There was
nothing to fear. To be sure, there was old
“Pine” Garvey, the river-squatter who had
fought, tooth and nail, against the Great
Northern building the dam at Bent Creek,
from which Garvey ran his pine logs, and
who regarded pulp sticks, the commodity
in which the Great Northern dealt, as
picayune timber compared to his pine.
Garvey had been beaten, muzzled by the
law, forbidden to place any obstacle in the
way of progress as represented by the
concrete dam. Slim Curtin had spoken of

“Crook Knee” Joe, the wretched habitant
who was “Pine” Garvey’s tool, and who
poled the river in a rotten bateau and made
what trouble he could for construction
bosses and timber bosses.

  Crook Knee Joe, Slim had said, was a
rank coward. And Tod had his .32 rifle
in the shanty, which he was under strict
instructions to use “only in emergency,
and then only as a threat.”

  Dusk was falling. Tod walked slowly
along the boom to the shanty which was
his home. He shot a final glance up the
turgid flood of the Rainy. It was clear.
The logs had not yet started down from
the cuttings above. But soon they would
be, for the headwater was rising fast. Be-
fore another day had passed the drive
would be bumping the boom, piling up a
brownish, grayish field of timber.

  Tod pursed his lips for a final shrill
whistle for Rip—and the whistle died into
a low “Whew!” as his eyes lighted on an
object lying on the ground before the
shanty door. He stopped and picked it
up. It was a worn leather mitten—Slim
Curtin’s. The cruiser must have dropped
it as he took his departure.

  Tod grinned. “Good thing Rip wasn’t
here,” he said. “Slim wouldn’t find his
mitten again. Doggone that dog!”

  But he grinned again as he recalled Rip’s
playful trick of snatching up every loose
object in the shape of clothing he could
find and running away with it—so that he
could be coaxed back and petted when he
returned it.

  “He-e-ere Rip!” His call was almost
unconsciously given. The answer was the
rasp and squeak of boom chains, the liquid
roar of the river, a blue-jay’s mockery, a
crow’s caw of alarm.

  Tod did not sleep well that night. The
absence of Rip weighed more and more
heavily upon him. For one thing the dog
had done night sentry duty for Tod.
Curled up in a bush just outside the shanty
door—refusing to sleep inside—Rip was a
better guard than a man could be. For
another thing—Tod had found his imagin-
ation terribly active. It projected him far
into the forest and pictured for him his
dog engaged in a furious combat with a big
black bear.

  He was up early in the morning, pacing
the boom, his peavey over his shoulder, its
heavy curved hook swinging. He looked
not unlike a soldier of some ancient army
of the days when bill and pike were com-
mon weapons, and it was not hard for Tod
to imagine himself some such soldier—a

Briton guarding a chain defense on the
Thames, a Roman soldier holding the
bridge across the Tiber, a Gaul fiercely
watchful and jealous of a pontoon across
the Seine.

  His imagination, however, swung always
around to the scene of his waking dreams
—the trail of the bear and the airedale.
His calked boots crunched crusted snow,
his peavey became a rifle, his eyes blazed.
He lowered the peavey to his arm-pit,
took aim, pulled the trigger—that is, the
steel hook and--

  "Boom I”

  He started as if the peavey had turned
into a rifle and had gone off unexpectedly
in his hands. Then he grinned at himself
and cried out, “Hello, Mister Log!”

  The “boom!” was the bump of the first
log of the drive against the boom.

  The logs drove down, at first in a drib-
ble, then in increasing clumps and tangles.
By noon a bobbing floor of timber lay
against the boom, stretching one hundred
yards upstream. Tod had a busy time.

He zig-zagged
across the
loose - lying,
tricky floor
with the ease
of an expert,
his calked
shoes gripping
bark and bare
logs with equal
sureness, his
educated feet
seeking just the right spot, leaving a sink-
ing log at just the right instant, treading
timber, leaping aside, running the length
of a big one, birling another beneath him.
He straightened out piling tangles, made
the logs lie flat and easy. It was part of
his job.

  The. boom bowed into an arc. The
coupling chains tightened and grated
sharply, link on link. Tod walked the
boom and inspected each coupling closely.
There was considerable wear on the chains,
subjected to the corroding influences of
river water, ram, snow and frost. One
half of each coupling lay under water aM
the time. Tod noticed that the patent
links, all of them, were submerged, as if
with purpose. He puzzled over that. It
would make it very hard to unlink a weak
chain and replace it with a new one, but
in a flash it occurred to him, also, that it
would make it hard for anyone to uncouple
the boom. Crook Knee Joe, for instance.
He smiled at the thought. Boss Whitney

would, never leave this boom to be guarded
by a lone boy if he thought there was dan-
ger of that sort. Would he?

  “A chain is often stronger than the link
that looks the weakest!”

  So this was Boss Whitney's philosophy.
Well! Tod wondered how to apply that.

  Abstract wonderings were erased by
concrete considerations, now. The strain
on the boom was greatest in mid-stream,
the sharpest bend of the bow. Here must
one expect danger, if anywhere. The pos-
sibility of a break in the boom, however,
was remote. Ten times as many logs would
fill the broad stretch of the Rainy, extend
for a mile up-stream and the boom would
hold fast. It was built to hold.

  “He-e-re Rip! Here, here, here!”

  His call was almost a wail of despair.

If he only knew-

  In mid-afternoon the drive slackened.
The flow of logs ceased entirely before
four o’clock.

 “Uh, huh! They’ve got a jam up
above,” Tod said aloud, “Gosh! I’d like
to go up and see it, and help.”

  He was yearning for companionship, for
action. If Rip were only here to join in

the game of running logs-

  He had convinced himself absolutely
that Rip had followed the snooping bear.'
Tod went to the shanty, took down his .32,
fingered it, sought out a blackened stump
along the shore which bore some resem-
blance to a bear, sought a vital spot—and
hit it, first shot. With a swift glance
across the river, which showed him the
logs lying quiet, 110 more timber coming
down, he stepped about the corner of the
shanty and studied the footprints of the
bear. Driblets of blood in the caked snow
told of Bruin’s reckless search of a jagged
tin for molasses. Tod cut a wide circle,!
seeking for Rip’s paw-prints, too. He did
not find them.

  “By Jove I I’ll just follow this bear’s
tracks until I do find where Rip hit the
trail,” he told himself with a thrill, and
plunged into the thicket whither the trail
led.

  An hour later Tod Raine floundered out
of the morass of a tamarack swamp to the
baaik of the Rainy, his face set, his breath
coming in great gasps, his eyes stony and
fierce. In that bush he had come upon
something that sent him crashing wildly
through the morass. It was the scene of a
furious combat between a hear and a dog.
Blood and hair and torn up roots and snow
told' the tale. Tod had turned another
page in the secret book of the wilderness^
48

SHORT STORIES

and its secret, solved, froze his blood.
Bear’s hair and dog’s hair lay in tangled
mats in the bloody snow.

  The serious part of it was that, for
many yards beyond the scene of that com-
flict there had been blood in the dog’s
tracks, and the tracks showed that the
dog had limped for long distances on three
legs.

  The story was plain. The bear had
turned to face the trailing airedale, had
fought, had been worsted, had turned and
fled—the dog, bleeding but fearless, in pur-
suit. .That had been two days ago!

  On the retina of his inner eye Tod got
the picture of the final stand of the bear.
It was in a ravine, deep in the forest,
where a swollen creek blocked Bruin’s prog-
ress. He turned and in fierce defiance,
faced the limping dog. Before the savage
attack the bear—a young one, though quite
large—climbed a tree.

  “Rip’s got him, and he’s waiting for me
to come and help him,” Tod told himself,
with the conviction of one who sees.

  But His searching, feverish eyes were
torn from the trail where it mounted a rise
on the river-bank—where the bear had
turned away from that barrier and plunged
into the thicket again. What he saw on
the bosom of the swollen Rainy was a mass
of moving logs, driving down in almost
solid formation, from bank to bank!

  Tod shuddered from the violence of
emotional reaction. A lump rose in his
throat and made his labored breathing
more difficult. For a dizzy moment he
stood, torn between the desire which
amounted to a frenzy of fear for his be-
loved Rip, the desire to keep on that
blood-stained trail to the end, and the
knowledge that his place at this moment
was down at the boom, on the job.

  Just for an instant he hesitated, then
stooped low and sent a piercing whistle
into the forest, beneath the drooping
boughs; and with the sound of that shrill
call ringing in his ears as the only answer,
he sped down the bank and leaped onto the
first log that swerved close to the shore.

  The river claimed him. Tod knew that
were it not for the sweep of that current,
carrying him down, he could never have
returned to the boom as he did. It needed
the mighty pull of the river, against his
own volition, to do it. He rode with the
drive until the glint of open water told
him he was nearing the boom. The open
water lay beyond the barrier.

  For the last time he turned his face to
the north, up the river, his muscles tighten-

ing with the impulse to dash ashore and
take up the trail again. A line from an old
verse of Kipling’s ran in his head:

  Brothers and Sisters, I bid you beware

  Of giving your heart to a dog to tear.

  “Well, he ran away from me, doggone
him!” he cried, trying to justify himself.
But his throat continued to ache. Some-
thing like a film over his eyes made the
log-field waver and quaver as he turned
his face downstream. He bit his lip, shook
his head to clear his sight—and started as
if he had been stung.

  What was that dark object down there
in mid-boom? A dog?

  Clutching his rifle in both hands across
his chest he started running the logs as
they moved.

  “Doggone dog! Bet he’s been back
waiting for me all the time—thinks I’ve
gone and left him. Well, it’s good enough
for him. I—say! That don’t look like
Rip!”

  He halted suddenly in his zig-zag sprint
and rode a big sprwce which lay amid its
fellows with steady balance.

  “It's bigger than Rip—sorta black—and
I wonder—if it could be—the bear. Now,
hold steady Tod Raine!”

  The sun, sinking, shone almost directly
in his eyes, the way the river curved from
north to west. It was difficult for Tod
to make out much but a dark blot on the
boom. But at last, banishing the distor-
tion of desire
which made him
think it was Rip
and the illusion

o	f imagination
which made it a
bear his judg-
ment forced him
to the slow be-
lief that it was
neither dog,
bear, porcupine
nor any four-footed thing—but a man
crouching on his heels!

  Slim back? No, Slim wouldn’t come
back after a night and a day—not for a
lost mitten. Tod poked at the bulge in his
blouse where he had thrust the mitten,
automatically hiding it from Rip.

  Then swift alarm came to him with the
sharp, metallic ring of steel on steel. His
eyes, for an instant, shielded from the sun
by a tall spruce, caught a clear glimpse of
the object on the boom.

  It was a man squatted there, swinging
a short-handled sledge.

  With a guttural rasp in his throat Tod

                                                            10

sprang forward. For a distance of forty
yards on the moving drive, which meant
sixty or more on the river, he ran, reckless
of himself. He had only the grim purpose
to charge the squatted figure. It was plain
enough what the man was doing. He was
cutting a boom-chain with a cold-chisel.

  At the edge of the log-field Tod halted
his sprint. He was within two hundred
yards of the boom. Plainly he saw the
sledge rise and fall, with the sound of its
metallic clink reaching his ears an instant
later. He raised his rifle, balanced him-
self carefully on a teetering log and aimed
for a spot on the boom near the trespasser.

  The shot ripped splinters from the boom
and ricochetted on the open water beyond,
whining at it whirled. With a start the
man with the sledge jumped up, then he
turned and ran, flinging the sledge and
cold-chisel into the river, each in a different
spot.

  Tod noted instinctively, where they fell,
knowing that their recovery, later, might
be important. He noted, also, the curious
gait of the fleeing man, and knew who it
was though he had never seen him. It was
Crook Knee Joe, the habitant, Pine Gar-
vey’s tool.

  Tod let him go. To fire at him was
useless, unless he wished to shoot to kill
—and he did not. That was against or-
ders, and against his own desire. The im-
portant thing was to get to the boom as
quickly as he could and see what Crook
Knee Joe had done.

  Tod sped so fast that he stumbled and
fell, his rifle crashing across a log, and
when he picked it up he found the gun
wrecked. It was but a step to the boom.
Tod slammed the useless gun down,
crawled over the logs on hands and knees
to the boom and scrambled desperately to
the coupling place where the man with the
sledge had been busy.

  He gasped as he reached it. One of the
chains that held the double ends was gone
entirely. It had been cut and slipped out
of the rings. The other, alone, held the
boom. He ran his fingers along the tight-
drawn section, gasped again as their sensi-
tive ends came in contact with a sharp-cut
notch in the under side of a link.

! The second chain had been cut half-way
through. Only a quarter inch of iron held
the boom, the grinding, bumping horde of
logs, the swollen, swift, tearing Rainy—
and protected the growing dam, five miles
down the river.

  “A chain is often stronger than the link
that looks the weakest.”

    10

  Tod sent up a prayer that Boss Whit-
ney’s philosophy was true. And then he
sent up another prayer for himself. His
quickened thought brought home to him a
lesson. It was this, that he was one link
in the chain upon which Boss Whitney
depended for the harnessing of the Rainy,
for the safety of the dam and of the hun-
dreds of workmen swarming over the
structure^ the comfort and well-being of
the thousand employees of the paper mills
far down river. He was one link, and
Boss Whitney had chosen him because he
believed in that proverb of his—and in
Tod Raine. Others had shaken their
heads doubtfully, looking him over, when
the boss chose a boy. Boss Whitney had
smiled and, later, Slim had brought Tod
a reason for that smile.

  “Rip, Rip, why did you go away?”

  Tod half-sobbed the words as he got to
his feet and stood for an awful moment,
bewildered, seeking to clear his brain, to
think out the first step he must take to
strengthen that weakened boom.

  It was not broken, yet. He was not
broken, yet. But he felt as if a sledge
had driven down upon his very soul. It
sickened him. Upon him depended
whether that cut link, when it broke—and
it must—would mean the bursting of the
boom, the rush of millions of feet of rac-
ing timber down the raging stream to bat-
ter and crash against the false structure
which diverted the river from the setting
concrete of the new dam.

  Tod turned and ran for the shack. His
feet dragged. His legs were wet to the
thighs, but it was not this which hauled
at his heels, it was the fear that when he
left the weakened coupling it would break
before he could return. He dug his calks
into the flat boom and raced on. At the
shack he caught up his peavey, snatched
from a nail on the wall a length of chain
with a patent link, fished from beneath his
bunk the sledge and the piece of railroad
iron which was to be used as an anvil,
felt in his mackinaw for the slender steel
punch he carried, always, and then again
whirled out to the boom. A few steps and
he stopped, dumped everything onto the
boom and went back. He snatched a sec-
ond length of chain from its hanging, be-
rating himself for his haste.

  The sun had set. The swift northern
dusk faded like a fragment of dream.
Tod bent low over the boom-ends. If only
he had brought the lantern! Too late now
to go back.

  The huge iron circles of the ring-bolts
5<>

SHORT STORIES

lay as flat as the links running through
them would allow and he had to use his
peavey point to raise them and thrust
through the new chain. The boom moved
restlessly. It seemed to Tod that every
yank would be the last. If the chiseled
link snapped, all would be over. Still, he
had become very cool and calm and sure.
It was a job of running a length of chain
through those rings, drawing the ends to-
gether, snapping the patent link shut and
riveting it tight. In emergency he might
even omit the rivet.

  But to draw the ends past each other and
give slack enough for the connection was
one thing to try, another to do. The chain,
when he got both ends through their rings,
fell short. The ends would not meet.
Tod gasped in dismay. He saw the reason.
The old chain was now stretched so taut
that it stood out of the water, entirely, and
the half-cut link was opening.

  The wonder was that it held at all. Tod
thrust the long spike of his peavey through
one link, just behind the weak one, caught
Jhe barb of the curved cant-hook through
an other link, beyond the yawning bit of
iron, seized the handle at the top, which
rose to the level of his eyes, and applied
his weight to the lever.

  He w^jt not a second too soon, for the
yawning link dropped off, even as he
grasped the peavey handle, broken at its
sharpest curve, where it fitted into its
brother.

  Tod gulped and his skin seemed to con-
tract all over his body as he saw that hap-
pen. But an instant later he exulted as he
found that his weight applied to the leve-
rage which the peavey gave him was more
than sufficient to hold the broken chain—
and even to draw its ends closer together.
Now, if he could manage to draw it far
enough, so that he could join the ends of
the new chain-

  He bit his lip and cried out, “You dog-
gone fool! You’ve got to use both hands
to snap that link on!”

  He held tight and pondered. Then he
brought the handle of his peavey down
toward the boom, crooked one knee over it
and, tentatively, tried holding it that way.
He found that it was possible, and began
to see his way clear to making the con-
nection. He dragged his anvil forward,
with some idea of using it, later, and bent
his body toward the boom-end.

  The movement gave him a frightful
thrill of alarm for, as he shifted his weight
forward, the peavey-handle came up, too,
and almost took him off his balance. To

keep his advantage he must put his weight
well to the end of the handle. And to do
this and reach the dangling ends of the
chain—well, it simply couldn’t be done,
that was all.

  He must hold the boom, himself. With
this realization a huge weight seemed to
settle down upon Tod’s shoulders. The
logs ground and bumped the boom, seemed
to rise like an avalanche of wood, the river

leaped and tore
at the lx>om,
the lx>om wav-
ered in eccen-
tric curves
from shore to
shore. Blood
seemed to start
from his fin-
ger-tips, then
they grew cold.
The darkness fell and with it a chill of
frost. He shivered as his warm blood
cooled after the strenuous log-running he
had done, and he settled to his vigil.

  Along toward midnight Tod roused him-
self from a sort of creeping stupor of cold
and fumbled in his blouse for Slim’s mit-
ten. It would keep one of his hands from
freezing, anyway.

 “Here Rip!” He thought he heard
something. “Rip! Out here!”

  Long afterwards, it seemed hours, Tod
was brought from another stupor by the
soft patter of toenails on wood. The steps
were irregular, hesitant. He reached down
for his useless rifle.

  “Sounds like a porky,” he muttered
sleepily. Then he cried out, letting the
rifle fall, “Rip!”

  It was the dog. In the darkness Tod
could not see him, but he knew that the
airedale was sorely hurt. No sound of
whining told him, for Rip did not whine
nor yelp. He was a thoroughbred. He
knew, first, from the dog’s hesitation, his
creeping approach, and then, when he
reached down one numb hand to the dog’s
muzzle, Iris fingers touched a sticky sub-
stance caked all over the dog’s head. It
was blood. Carefully he coaxed Rip close
and, hooking his knee firmly about the
peavey-handle, with one hand beneath it,
as he had done off and on during the vigil,
he felt over the dog, for broken bones.
Rip winced when he touched one forefoot,
but he sat on his haunches and allowed his
master to examine the blood-clotted leg
without jerking away.

  Tod took out his bandanna, dipped it in
the water and began sopping the blood

                                                       10

from Rip’s wounds. The water was icy,
and it was that helped to stanch the flow
of blood from the raking scratches of
bear’s claws. It made Tod’s numb hands
still more numb. He took off the mitten,
the better to work over Rip, and the mo-
ment he laid it on the boom Rip sniffed at
it and gave a sharp bark.

  As if the dog had spoken human lan-
guage Tod answered him, husky with cold
and excitement.

  “Yes, Rip, that’s Slim’s mitten. Slim’s,
you understand ? Slim is down river—
that way,” he gestured in the darkness.
“Rip, take it to Slim!”

  The dog got to his feet. Tod fumbled
for a match and lighted it with some diffi-
culty. Pointing down river he repeated
his first half-hysterical command more
firmly.

  “Slim Curtin,” he said. “Down that
way. Take it to Slim. Take it!”

  The dog’s eyes gleamed in the match-
light, his ears came up—one of them rag-
ged and torn.

  Tod moaned, but he knew that his pity
must be hidden. He must only command.
He must send this battle-scarred pal of his
five weary miles down the river trail to
bring help.

  He thrust the mitten toward Rip’s muz-
zle. Rip sniffed it again, then quietly
opened his jaws and took it, and with a
look that was at once understanding and
reproach, he turned and with his tail wag-
ging, trotted back toward shore.

  The darkness swallowed him up and it
hid, also, something very much like tears
in Tod Raine’s eyes. They were not tears
of weakness, though his hands were so
numb he could scarcely close the fingers,
and his neck ached from the strain of hold-
ing to the peavey-handle and his wet feet
and legs were stiff and chilled to the bone.

  It was breaking dawn when two men
strolled up the river trail, behind them
limping a dejected, sore-footed airedale,
who now and then stopped to lick at a
great raking rip in the skin of one fore-leg
and to shake off drops of blood from a
torn ear. They made for the shack on the
shore, set back in a little clump of balsams.
The boom was hidden from them for a
short distance on the trail.

  “Can’t see that anythin’s wrong,” spoke
Slim Curtin, looking out over the clear
flow of the river, which was visible to
them. “The boom’s held, all right, or the
Rainy’d be alive with logs. But I figger
I dropped that mitten here, and the dog
must have been back here after I left to

   10

pick it up, and something sure happened to

that dog, and-”

  “What’s that out there, Slim?”

  “Well, I swan!”

  The man who asked the question, a
powerful young man with an air of capa-
bility about him, a square chin but humor-
ous lips, kindly, keen gray eyes, broke into
a run and leaped onto the boom. A brist-
ling figure sprang past him. It was Rip,
suddenly alert, forgetful of his own trou-
bles, as his eye caught sight of his master.

  It took the combined strength of Boss
Whitney and Slim Curtin to unlock Tod
Raine’s clenched hands from about his
peavey-handle.

  “Gosh, he’s a strong kid!” exclaimed
Slim. “Lots of power in those hands.”
“Strong is right,” ejaculated Boss Whit-
ney, bending closer over the clenched
hands as Slim, with a quick grasp of the
situation, took Tod’s place at the peavey-
lever. “Those hands are frozen stiff!”

Tod was revived by the warm tongue
of a dog who answered to the name of

Rip. He was ly-
ing in his bunk,
his hands curi-
ously detached
from himself, it
seemed. He
looked down at
them, they were
as red as fire,
but he felt no
sensation from
them. The quer-
ulous thought came to him that he ought
to scold those hands. They ought not to
be here, they should be out in mid-boom,
wrapped tightly about the smooth, cold
handle of a peavey.

  He coughed. The convulsion hurt him.
He moved his arms and the hands with
them, like lumps of lead attached to his
wrists.

  “Rip! H-e-ereRip!”

  The dog reared on his hind feet and
laid his forefeet across Tod’s chest. With!
a quick, human-like up-tilt of his head
he seemed to be reassuring his master.

  “Doggone dog, you! Did you take it
to Slim?”

  At this moment Slim appeared, and be-
hind him Boss Whitney. Tod came to full
consciousness with a rush. He sat wildly
up in his bunk.

  “The boom!” he cried. “The boom!
Crook Knee Joe cut the chain. I went
after Rip, to kill that bear and he cut the
chain!”
52

SHORT STORIES

  Boss Wliitney came over and took one
of Tod’s helpless hands in his own. At
the touch sharp needles seemed to strike
through the member. He winced.

  Boss Whitney smiled. “So you can feel
it, eh? Well, I guess they’ll be all right,
then. Thought they might be frozen
worse. How long did you hang onto that
peavey handle, son?”

  “What time is it?” countered Tod.
“Well, it’s past noon now, but it was
only five o’clock this morning when Rip
brought us up here.”

  “About twelve hours then, I guess,”
Tod answered the question the boss had
asked. “Then I—the boom—I let go?

After all that? And the boom-”

  “The boom is all right. Slim and I put
in two new connections, and Slim can’t
figure out, yet, how you managed to hold
the old one together, with a link gone en-
tirely.”

  Tod sat up and told them. He did not
attempt to excuse himself for going on
the bear’s trail for Rip.

  “Well, Tod Raine,” spoke Boss Whit-
ney, when Tod had finished his story. “I
guess you realize you ought not to have
left the boom, at all. I’m not going to

reprimand you, however. Because, Tod,
110 man without a human weakness is
worth much—if there is such a man. Your
devotion to your dog was part and parcel
with your sense of obligation to hold that
boom if it killed you. And you held it.
That’s enough for me. I tell Slim, here,
that a chain is often stronger than its
weakest link looks—and I believe that. I
want to take you down river with me and
give you a real man’s job—even more of
a man’s job than guarding Boom One.
I’m going to put you on duty as head
watchman at the new dam. You and
Rip.”

  “Yes, sir,” gulped Tod. “Yes, sir. I
guess I’m cured of that weakness of mine
—I mean nothing could get me to leave my
post again for a minute.”

  “I know it,” smiled Boss Whitney.

  “And I’ve got to cure Rip of his weak-
ness, too,” Tod added, “if he’s going on
the new job with me. He’s got to learn
to leave bear’s tracks alone and stay with
me.”

  “I think Rip has learned that already,”
chuckled Boss Whitney. “Judging from
his looks.”

  Rip rolled a solemn eye in his direction.

A DELAYED RETURN

EORGE FRISBEE shuddered
as his native village came in
sight beside the rocky banks of
Gold Creek.

  The mere scenery of the
day’s journey, scenery which he well re-
membered and which he had long wished
yet feared to behold again, had made him
profoundly depressed. In other places he
loved the great rugged mountains, green
and red below, where the pine forests were
gashed by granite and sandstone cliffs,
bald and white above where patches of last
winter’s snow still remained in the high
clefts to mingle with the first covering of
approaching winter.

  But in the last few miles these moun-
tains had had eyes, black, empty, sightless
eyes, scores of them, the long-abandoned
prospect holes of forgotten pioneers, eyes
looking silently and sadly upon the traveler
10	S3

 until the train passed out of their range,
 when a new group would immediately take
 up the vigil beyond the next curve.

   George Frisbee, reputed a very matter-
 of-fact young man, a lawyer, with fine sen-
 sibilities perhaps, but certainly not usually
 a creature of dreams or fancies, had lapsed
 into a settled melancholy. His mood was
 a vague and general sense of tragedy and
 sorrow.

   A slight jolt and an almost impercepti-
 ble shifting of his own weight as the train
 started down the mountain side toward the
 town huddling in the bottom of the lofty
 bowl, and then came the thing which he
 had been subconsciously fighting off, the
 thrill of distinct and red and horrid mem-
 ory—his father lying with his head
 against the wall of that very building yon-
 der, a smoking pistol falling from his hand,
 blood running from his mouth and stain-
 ing his shirt, curses on his lips. The
 curses ceased as the boy threw himself,
 sobbing, on the man’s breast. Then came
54

the last words, thrown brokenly at a tall
man who stood in the doorway of the
building opposite, holding another pistol.

  “You ain’t got me, Gass Dubonnet. You
can’t get me. I’ll stay right with you till
I get my rights. Rights! Rights! D’ye
hear! Rights, for my wife and kid!”

  That was more than nineteen years ago,
and his mother had taken him away a few
days later. He had never returned to
Jamestown. When he had had business
there he had sent his partner, Griswold.
But a thousand times in the intervening
years his mind’s eye had reconstructed that
moment. Once, in the last few weeks, he
had met in the streets of the Capital, a tall
old man with a pointed beard who had
looked curiously at him in a startled man-
ner. It could hardly have been the same
tall man, and yet—there had been some-
thing grimly reminiscent about him.

  Now, with the very street spread before
him, George Frisbee not only visualized the
tragic event of long ago, he heard and felt
it, felt and tasted the salt red mixture of
his father’s blood and his own tears, felt
his father’s hand clutching fiercely at him,
felt the quick throbs of the man’s heart
and the one last hard desperate heave of
his breast.

  He shuddered, then pulled himself erect
in his seat. He had work to do in this
town, work which was important, at least
to him, work which called for a pleasing
appearance and a cheerful and confident
manner. He was there to inspire confi-
dence in himself.

  For George Frisbee, aged twenty-seven,
was a candidate for the office of attorney-
general, election was only three weeks off,
and this old Colorado mining camp, seedy

and moribund, was still the heart of the
opposition and the residence of his oppo-
nent. With a tremendous effort of will
he shook himself out of his morbid mood
and braced himself to assume the character
of his part.

  His own name greeted him from a pos-
ter on the station wall. “Grand Political
Rally. Court House. October 17TH, 3
p. m. Hon. George Frisbee, Candidate for
Attorney-General, and best local speakers
And here on the platform were residents
of Jamestown, whom he had seen occa-
sionally at the Capital.

  “Hello, Mr. Frisbee. In on time, I
see.”

  “All set for the meeting? Going to have
a good crowd.”

  “Yes,” said a third voice, “everybody be-
ing out of work, they can afford to waste
an hour.”

  The last speaker, grinning with a slightly
malicious expression, proved to be Kene-
han, the district attorney, Frisbee’s oppo-
nent in the present race.

  “That’s ail right, Charlie. I’ll give ’em
something to talk about, and that’s more
than you’ve been able to do.”

  Guffaws of mountain laughter greeted
this sally, and Frisbee was introduced
around.

  “Here’s Judge Dunaway. He’ll be your
chairman. He’s lived here forever. Guess
he founded Jamestown.”

  Judge Dunaway, a lanky round-should-
ered, middle-aged giant, with an unkempt
grayish beard, extended his hand.

  “Well, well, Georgie Frisbee! Welcome
home! Reckon you don’t remember me.
But I remember you, a serious-faced bare-
footed kid, and I remember your mother
and—and your dad.”

  The last was spoken as if he had men-
tally questioned whether to say it and then
had decided to let the words come as orig-
inally framed.

  Another mental surge of the ancient
scene almost staggered Frisbee as he
grasped the older man’s hand. His eye
involuntarily turned to a place a block up
the street. Dunaway was holding him
with a sort of deliberate and intensive
friendliness. Sensing a momentary em-
barrassment, he added, “Sorry you’ve been
away so long. Always wanted to know
you after you’d grown up.”

  Next to the station, Kenehan was talk-
ing with another little group. One said,
with sneering lip, “He’s too much like his
dad to be any good. The young upstart!
.Thinks he can coddle this town now, at

                                                   10

election time, after he’s been too good for
it for twenty years.”

  Dunaway, catching the voice but diplo-
matically ignoring the words, turned pleas-
antly toward the speaker.

  “Slade,” he said, “I want you to know
Mr. Frisbee. He’ll probably be the next
attorney-general, but anyway we’ll have
one from this little old burg of James-
town.”

  Frisbee extended his hand. “Well,” he
remarked, “of course I agree with Judge
Dunaway. Glad to meet you, Mr. Slade.”
“Say, Frisbee,” said Kenehan, “don’t
forget that Slade is the coroner up here.
He’s been burying your party so many
years now that he just naturally can’t get
out of the habit.”

  “Well, come to our meeting, boys,” re-
turned Dunaway. “You’ll find us very
much alive. And, George, you won’t find
all the people, or even all the county offi-
cers, against us. Here’s Sheriff Bates and
his boy. Mr. Bates, shake hands with Mr.
Frisbee. Mr. Billy Bates, Mr. Frisbee.
Billy’s only eighteen, but if Kenehan don’t
watch him close he’s likely to slip a ballot
for you into the box.”

  “Nix on that, Judge,” protested the grin-
ning youth. “I’m an officer of the law, I
am. But I’ll bet I can get a few votes
for any candidate that you are for.”

  The judge escorted Frisbee up the street
toward the hotel, stopping at frequent in-
tervals to introduce his charge. Among
some of the old-timers there seemed to be
an undercurrent of hostility or resentment
which Dunaway breezily disregarded, as-
suming that the person introduced would be
glad to meet “the next attorney-general.”
Several times the question, “Why have-
n’t you ever come to see us before?” was
put, in one form or another, and it was a
rather awkward one. “Guess you’ve been
too busy making money in the city,” was
an occasional comment in connection with
the question.

  “No, I can’t say I’ve made much money,”
laughed Frisbee in response to such a re-
mark from old Dad Postlewaite at the
hardware store. “I always thought the
mountains were the place to find gold.”
“Well, it’s all ghost-gold now. Nothin’
but memories, like everything else in this
place. Gee! You’re a memory yourself!”
“I think it’s memories that have kept
George away,” said the judge quietly, then
added hastily, “Come along, George.
There’ll be folks at the hotel I want you
to meet. Most everybody in town comes
there to dinner. Drop in at our meeting,
10

Dad. The boy’ll show you how he can
trot.”

  Postlewaite looked after them reflect-
ively. “Just the double of his father!
If he’d had a whisky breath and a flannel
shirt I’d ’a’ sworn it was Jack Frisbee
walkin’ the streets to get Gass Dubonnet,
like he said he would.”

  He glanced up past the end of the street
to where, at the foot of the mountain, a
mile and a half beyond the town, stood a
great, bare, weatherbeaten structure. The
fall air was chill and raw, presaging a com-
ing storm. Postlewaite shivered again and
turned into his store, where he kicked
open the stove door and added two stout
chunks of wood to the fire. “Dreary,
haunty place up there,” he soliloquized.
“That’s where Jack Frisbee’s ghost is, if
he’s anywhere this side of hell.”

  Dunaway was saying to the young man,
“Slade’s been getting the town sore about
you because you haven’t been back. And
he’s been digging up old stories about your
dad. I knew your father well, boy, and
liked him. You’re certainly the breathing
picture of him. Don’t get peeved at these
old codgers. Their point of view has got
twisted in the last twenty years. They’re
always thinking of the old busy feverish
times and it makes ’em bitter to see the
place so dead. An’ then, since you haven’t
been here, they haven’t had any chance to
know you, and they’ve all been hearing
the other side of the story for a long time.”
He paused and looked at the mill.

  “I must say, he never tells the story
himself. He lives up there, all alone.”
“He?”

  “Yes, Gaspard Dubonnet. I feel sorry
for him, too. Do—do you mind my talk-
ing about him?”

  “No, no, go ahead,” said George, with
the fascinated horror of a child. “I want
to hear.”

  “Well, you remember—no, I guess you
don’t—what a gay
spark he used to
be. Always had
plenty of money.
Always slinging it
around. Always
spending it like
water, but never
spending it for
water. Every
mine promoter,
every drummer, every politician, used
to know him well. He knew all the
big ones. He and Senator Lamson were
great cronies. Lamson used to say that
56

SHORT STORIES

Gass was the !>est drinker, an’ the best pis-
tol-shot, an’ the best engineer he ever
knew, and he was right all ’round. The
senator used to come up here to j amestown
to go on sprees, an’ then he’d stay with
Dubonnet till he’d slept off his jag.

  “Hot old days they were, lx>y,” he con-
tinued, as they turned in at the hotel. He
glanced from the hall into the lobby. “No-
body here yet. Well, we can chat a few
minutes. I like to talk about those good
old, bad old, times, when everybody had
money an’ liquor. The old Saddle Rock
Saloon never closed its doors from one
year’s end to another, and when miners up
the gulch would get their month’s pay
they’d make a bee line for the Saddle Rock
and they’d never leave till their last cent
was gone. Then Jim Slade—father of
Tom Slade, the coroner—would stake ’em
to enough to get back to the mines, after
they’d passed all their money to him over
the bar or played it on his roulette wheel.

  “The miners at the end of each month,
and some rich daily customers like Gass
Dubonnet and Senator Lamson and your
—and twenty or thirty other chaps like
’em—made Jim Slade a rich man. At
night when Gass Dubonnet and Lamson
and some of their gang weren’t playing the
wheel or playing poker in some other gam-
bling joint, they’d be singing and carousing
over at Slade’s or down the line at Mag
Lovejoy’s.

  “Lord. I wonder now when we boys ever
slept! We all lived so fast you’d think
we’d have just naturally burned out—and
now we live so awful slow that I don’t sup-
pose we'll ever get through living.

  “Most of the old gang’s gone, now.
J im Slade finally took to drinking, himself,
and died of delirium tremens even before
the town died. Old Mag Lovejoy’s still
alive and still here. Runs a miners’ board-
ing house now, though she ain’t got many
boarders. People have almost forgotten
she didn’t used to be respectable. Not to
say she wouldn't still bootleg a little for
you.”

  “And she’ll still show you a hole right
in the eye of a picture of Buffalo Bill.
Gass Dubonnet shot that hole with one of
those old French duelling pistols—excuse
me, boy, I forget-”

  “That’s all right. Go ahead, please.”

  “Well, it’s nothing anyway, except a re-
markable stunt. Gass Dubonnet shot that
hole just to show he could. He drilled it
so neat in the middle of the eye that you’d
hardly know it was there. But that’s only

half of it. He was standing with the other
pistol in his left hand and—I know you
won’t believe this, but I saw it myself—he
plunked just exactly the same kind of a
hole in Buffalo Bill’s other eye.”

  The judge whistled reminiscently at the
exploit and then changed the course of his
remarks.

  “Well, I’m left, and Dad Postlewaite,
and half a dozen of us old no-account fel-
lows that were only second-rate sports in
the old days. Maybe that’s the reason
we’re still allive. We haven’t had pep
enough or money enough to get away.
But that ain’t the reason Gass Dubonnet
has stayed. He’s always thought there
was gold still in the old Golconda. He
isn’t the owner, at that. He’s just a sort
of volunteer manager, with a half-interest
for life. He’s managed to raise money—
God knows how, but mostly by selling the
machinery, I believe—to redeem the old
judgments and to pay the taxes. He’s
never taken out an ounce of gold in a
dozen years as far as I know. Sometimes
you’ll see the old man puttering 'round up
there and even running out a car of loose
rock by hand. He buys a little powder
occasionally, and everybody knows he’s
tapping and drilling around in the old
stopes.

  “Here, lately, he’s kind of thawed out
a little. We think he’s got somebody in
the city interested with him, enough to
give him an occasional stake. He goes
down every couple of weeks or so, and he
seems to have a little money. But until
lately we’d hardly see the old fellow from
one month’s end to another. He’d get
some canned stuff and some bacon and a
little powder and caps and just hide him-
self in the mine and in the old mill. I’ve
been up there occasionally—I'm about the
only man in town that goes there—and he’s
friendly enough to me, but at that he ain’t
exactly what you’d call hospitable. When
he ain’t puttering in the mine he’s reading.
One end of the old mill room’s his kitchen
and the other’s his bed-room and library,
and books—you just ought to see ’em.
There’s been a new box of ’em at the sta-
tion for him every two or three months, as
long as I can remember, and more of ’em
lately than before. Last time I was up
there he was reading one on spiritualism.”

 Dunaway paused for a moment and
stroked his ragged beard. He looked at
Frisbee thoughtfully.

  “He talked about spiritualism last time
I was up there,” he resumed reflectively,
taking his eyes from his companion’s face

                                                    to

and looking vacantly into space. “I guess
I'm the only man he ever talks to, at all
confidentially, an’ that ain’t very much.
But he does come to see two women, two
very different women. One of ’em’s old
Mag Lovejoy and the other is—is Miriam
Packer.”

  “Packer? Packer?”

  “Yes, the school-ma’am—one of ’em.
Why, I guess probably you might remem-
ber her. She was a little kid when—Let’s
see, she must be just about your age.”

  “A little red-headed girl, with a long
mouth and great big staring blue eyes.”
“Well—er, yes. Leastwise she’s red-
headed, all right enough, and she does have
rather a long mouth, but I don’t think her
eyes are any bigger than ordinary.”

  They were big, however, in the recollec-
tion of George Frisbee, for it was made up
of several principal impressions. There
was the child’s horrified look when he had
put a little garter snake in her desk at
school. There was a wide stare of right-
eous indignation which she had habitually
directed at him for several weeks after
that. And there was a still more horrified
stare on that last terrible day.

  That last look burned in his memory
now, but the burning was eased by the
words which had accompanied it, awkward,
childish, tender words. She had run to
him and his father as they lay together in
the street, run apparently without fear.

She had put her
hands on the boy’s
shoulder.

  “Georgie,” she
had faltered, “dear
Georgie, I’m so
sorry.” And her
compassionate eyes
had been like great
blue marbles under
their wide-open
lids.

  And those same eyes looked at him now
from the hallway of the little hotel, eyes
wide with astonishment The young wom-
an liad paused, apparently to nod to Judge
Dunaway. The nod stopped half way as
she saw the judge’s companion.

  “Miss Parker,” said Dunaway, “do you
remember George Frisbee?”

  “Is it really George Frisbee?” gasped
the girl. “Well, I declare, you did give me
a shock. I thought I had seen a ghost.”
The big blue eyes turned downward in
confusion and her face reddened as she
realized what she had said,
to

Chapter II

A STORM BREWING

DUNAWAY broke the embarrass-
ment by making his customary
boast about his candidate.

  “George has grown a lot in every way
since you two knew each other as kids.
Now he’s come up here to talk you into
voting for him. It ought not to be a hard
job, but come to his meeting this afternoon
anyway.”

  “I should be glad to come and I shall
probably be able to. I expect to let school
out early so that the children who live up
the gulch can get home. Mr. Suggs, the
bus-man says there’s a bad storm coming
and that it’s already snowing hard in the
canyon.”

  Dunaway whistled softly and looked out
of the window. A few large flakes were
falling on the sidewalk.

  “George, I’m afraid this means good-by
to your meeting at Summit. I guess you
could make it up there all right, even if
Miss Packer is nervous about her kids, but
if we get one of our real good heavy early
snowstorms you couldn’t get back. Better
make your plans to enjoy the hospitality of
your native town tonight.”

  “Well,” Frisbee replied, “I hope I can
get to Summit because I promised the peo-
ple there that I’d come up.”

  “Well, we’ll see. You can call ’em up
by ’phone after your meeting here. There’s
the dining-room open. Let’s go in.”

  Miriam Packer, it appeared, was accus-
tomed, on schooldays, to take her dinner
at the hotel. She lived in an old house at
the lower end of the narrow town, which
spread, never more than three blocks wide
and most of the way only one block wide,
through the long narrow basin which the
crowding mountains grudgingly gjranted
the creek at this place.

  On Frisbee’s inquiry she told him that
her parents were both dead. She rented
the lower story of her house to a married
couple and lived in the upper story with
the other teacher of the little school. This
other girl, she said, had been confined to
the house for several days.

  Dunaway sat at one side of Frisbee and
Miriam Packer at the other, and although
the young man was introduced to the other
noon boarders across the red tablecloth, he
found all his attention concentrating upon
the girl.

  When she was leaving to go back to the
school, he went to the doorway to help her
into her coat—rather a shabby coat he
58

SHORT STORIES

  thought—and her long mouth curved into
  a delightful smile as she buttoned the collar
  tightly around her throat. Was she pretty ?
  It was hard to say. No. Probably not.

Her features were
too large to be
pretty, too irregu-
lar to be hand-
some, and yet,
somehow, it was
a beautiful face.
Certainly it was
a sweet face, a
most winsome
face, a strong
face and—a good face.

    Frisbee saw Dunaway smiling broadly
  from the side of the table, and in momen-
  tary embarrassment he stepped out of
  range beyond the door.

    “I mustn’t keep you, Miss—Miriam,” he
  said, “since you’re going now in order that
  I may see more of you today, but—” he
  glanced out of the window where the snow
  was now driving before the wind in small
  steady flakes, “I don’t believe I’ll be able
  to go to Summit tonight and-”

    “Oh, but, George, you must go. It
 means votes, doesn’t it? George, I’m so
 anxious for you to be elected.” She looked
 down, in sudden confusion. “Good-by,”
 she said, hurriedly, “I must run.”

    Dunaway chuckled as Frisbee returned
  to his coffee and his dried-apple pie. The
  others at the table were grinning broadly.

    “Must say you’re a fast worker, boy,”
  he remarked. “But nobody can blame
  you. Miriam Packer’s just about the nic-
  ' est little lady I ever knew, but you’ll have
  some competition from the home boys.
  There’s her cousin Henry, for instance.”

    “Henry’s certainly been pretty busy over
  there lately,” remarked one of their table
  companions. Apparently it was not at all
  out of order to discuss a lady’s personal
  affairs at the hotel dining table.

    “And Mort Caythorne,” said another.

    In the midst of his growing resentment
  it dawned upon Frisbee that this forgotten
  little town was a sort of family, in which
  the intimate concerns of each were the in-
  timate concerns of all.

     “I don’t think she’s given Caythorne very
  much encouragement,” said one of the
  group.

    “Well, he’s one of the home folks any-
  way. She’s known him since he was a
  boy.”

    The speaker glanced at Frisbee with a
  look in which there was a half-hidden inti-
  mation that he was an unjustified inter-

loper. A tight little family, this. It was
evidently necessary that he should estab-
lish his own title to membership in it.

  “I may say that I knew Miss Packer my-
self, when I was a boy,” he remarked quiet-
ly, and sought to change the subject.
“Snow coming down quite steadily now.”
“Yes, and blowing awful mean,” said the
man at the end of the table, looking toward
the window. “That’ll make it kind of un-
pleasant for another of Miriam’s beaus,
the old man o’ the mill.”

  “Well, Gass doesn’t call there every
single night.”

  “No, but he generally calls after each of
his trips to the city. Brings her a present,
I suppose,” looking at Frisbee to enjoy his
discomfiture, “an’ I don’t think he called
after he got back yesterday, so he’ll prob-
ably come tonight.”

  Frisbee could stand no more of this
stuff. He rose quickly and strode through
the hotel waiting room, where he savagely
bit off the end of a cigar and stood in an-
gry disgust, contemplating the dreary scene
without.

  Guffaws of laughter sounded from the
dining room, but he scarcely noticed as
two sentences were ringing in his ears,
one from long ago, and one from the im-
mediate present.

  “Georgie, dear Georgie, I’m so sorry.”
“George, I’m so anxious for you to be
elected.”

Chapter III

TRANSMIGRATION ?

BY THE time set for the afternoon
meeting it was evident that Fris-
bee could not proceed to the next
town, and Dunaway telephoned to the
chairman there to cancel the speaking en-
gagement. However, the Jamestown meet-
ing was promising. The room of the dis-
trict court was fairly well filled, in spite
of the weather, when Judge Dunaway
tapped for order at three o’clock.

  “Fellow citizens,” he began, “we shall
listen this afternoon to a native son of
Jamestown. Mr. George Frisbee, as a lit-
tle boy, was favorably known to us old-
timers of the mountains. As a man he is
favorably known to the whole state and
has become the candidate of a great po-
litical party for the office of attorney-
general, one of the most important in the
gift of the people.”

  While he was speaking Frisbee’s eyes
searched the audience to find Miriam
Packer. He was thinking of what he

                                                        10

could say to her, rather than of what he
could say to the others. He did not lo-
cate her at first, probably because the rear
of the courtroom was rather dark, but as
his gaze roved the chamber he felt a rather
uncomfortable sensation, as if it were be-
ing drawn to a particular spot.

 The compulsion seemed to grow
stronger.

  At last, like the final spring of a piece of
steel to a magnet, his glance jumped to the
place which had been drawing it. The spot
was the piercing black-eyed gaze of a man
in the back row of his audience.

  The impression was only of those eyes,
deep and sad and inscrutable. And yet
they seemed not unfriendly. Except for
the fire hidden in their depths they some-
what resembled the prospect holes which
from the mountain sides had watched each
mile of his advance into this fastness.
Weirdly they held his own with a power
he could not shake off. They seemed to
penetrate his soul. There was some mes-
sage—some inquiry. Inquiry? Well, an
inquiry or a demand. They seemed to call
for some concession.

  In some strange way their expression
changed a little as he gazed into them.
Those eyes, like the black muzzles of a pair
of pistols, were demanding that he surren-
der something, some secret. Secret? His
own eyes flashed back the return. lie had
no secrets. His life was an open book.

  With this establishment of communica-
tion he felt his own strength returning,
like that of a man who, sinking in a quick-
sand, should suddenly feel a rocky ledge
lieneath his feet. The other’s gaze left
him for a moment and he xealized that
Dunaway had turned toward him and, with
an introducing gesture of his right hand,
was summoning him to arise and greet his
former townsmen. What Dunaway had
said, after his opening paragraph, had been
completely lost to Frisbee, but a very con-
siderable salvo of applause marked the con-
clusion of the introductory speech and the
rising of the visiting speaker, the clapping
no doubt being generously intended for
both men.

  As Frisbee rose lie felt his feet slip-
ping from the ledge into the quicksands.
Those pistol points must be aimed at him
again. He must fight this out, somehow.
His voice sounded husky to himself as he
began. “Friends and fellow-citizens”—he
cleared his throat— “and, I am proud to
say, fellow-townsfolk—” Those eyes!
Those eyes! They were drawing him with
an unearthly power. His feet were on the
very brink of the sustaining ledge. If he
could only find some other support! Ah, a
saving idea, a simple idea!

  “It is so long since we have had a chance
to see each other,” he continued, “and the
storm has made it so dark in this room,
that I wish some one who knows where the
switch is would be good enough to turn on
the light. Besides, I want to show you
that politics is really not a dark subject at
aJl.”

  With the appreciative titter which greet-
ed this mild sally, the room was flooded
with light, and George Frisbee found him-
self normal, capable and smiling, before a
smiling audience. His nightmare was past.
The ghosts and goblins of the twilight
seemed to have departed.

  “There, that’s better,” he remarked,
glancing with approval at the new chande-
lier whose stout prongs of shining brass
decorated the center of the room. “It
reminds me that the principal business of
the legal department of the State, the prin-
cipal business of your attorney-general, is
to let the light into dark places. The busi-
ness of that office is to discover and sup-
press graft and extortion and to see that
people are protected in their rights.”

  He looked, voluntarily now, to find the
eyes which had watched him from the back
row, and saw a tall elderly gentleman with
iron gray hair brushed back in smooth
waves from a splendid broad forehead.
The man was sitting very erect. He wore
a neatly trimmed pointed beard and long
upturned mustaches which wlere almost
white. Above the beard rose a strong
aquiline nose. Those compelling eyes
were deep-set under shaggy brows. They
seemed now to be burning like live coals.

It was the face of a mystic, a dreamer, pos-
sibly a fanatic.

  Frisbee paused again, almost shivered,
as he confronted those eyes. Once more,
but with cruelly intensified vividness, the
old scene flashed before his mind as he
realized that he was looking into the face
of Gaspard Dubonnet, his father’s slayer.

  The audience, awaiting his next words,
shifted uneasily in their seats. Some fol-
lowed his gaze to the rear of the room.
There was a whispering here and there.

  Frisbee, realizing that the pause was be-
coming awkward, endeavored to recover
himself by repeating his last word.

  “Rights” he said—Dubonnet’s wide eyes
had narrowed in their deep caverns and he
was stroking his beard with long sensitive
fingers, like an artist’s—“rights are what
most of us think of in our relations to
other people and to the government.”

  It was strange indeed that he hadn’t
seen Miriam Packer in the hall until that
very moment, especially strange because
she was right beside Gaspard Dubonnet
in the back row. The sight gave him an
odd pang which was closely akin to jeal-
ousy but which helped to steady him from
his own spiritual vertigo. Dubonnet
stopped stroking his beard and appeared
as if about to rise from his chair. The girl
passed her hand inside his arm and said
something to him. Then—she looked at
Frisbee and smiled.

  The speaker continued, and as his speech
gathered force he felt that the crowd was
more and more with him.

  Miriam’s face was aglow with delight
and satisfaction. She smiled a benedic-
tion at the speaker and he felt his spirit
expanding under the warmth of her en-
couragement. Half turning, to spread his
thought to other parts of the audience, he
caught the eyes of Slade and Kenehan, the
latter thoughtful, the former contemptu-
ous. He would
win at least
their secret
tribute.

  “Our sturdy
pioneers o f
these m o u n-
tains well un-
derstood that
rights depend
upon duties.
They under-
stood that jus-
tice means self-restraint; that if men
should be permitted to take the law into
their own hands there would soon be no

law; that if each individual should be al-
lowed to enforce his own rights there
would soon come a time when no one would
have any rights to enforce.

  “Their peace, their industry, their prop-
erty, their mines, were too precious to be
left to the haphazard and arbitrary adjust-
ment of the six-shooter and the sawed-off
shotgun. They must have the machinery
for an orderly adjustment of their dis-
putes, an adjustment without passion or
violence.

  “There were indeed times when our own
pioneers forgot their creed of law—”
Confound it, why should his eyes be drawn
again to those burning coals in the rear of
the house? The rest of the audience be-
gan to sense the strange duel. People
turned and looked from Frisbee to Du-
bonnet, from Dubonnet to Frisbee.

  Frisbee concluded his sentence rather
lamely—“but those times, happily, are
past.”

  Turning his glance by a strong effort of
will to the faces of others in the crowd,
Frisbee was disturbed by an expression of
uneasiness, almost of alarm, which he not-
ed here and there among the older men
and on the face of one elderly woman.
Dad Postlewaite’s mouth was open and his
countenance registered something akin to
both fascination and fear as he stared at
the speaker. Nor was that expression
changed, it was rather enhanced, when
Frisbee deliberately smiled at him. As if
terrified by the smile Postlewaite shrank
into his collar and then suddenly turned
around, looking at Dubonnet in the back
of the hall. Tbither Frisbee looked again,
and then there came a diversion while he
stood silent upon the platform. Dubonnet
rose suddenly and went to the rear door.
There he turned for a moment and looked
fixedly at Frisbee. With every nerve
tense, George steadied himself to return
the stare unflinchingly.

  The audience was greatly but silently
excited. Men rose in their seats and
gripped the backs of their chairs, looking
first at one and then at the other of the
two apparently hypnotized men. Strange-
ly again the consciousness was borne upon
Frisbee that there was no hostility in the
compelling gaze of the other man—merely
soul-searching question, insistent, desper-
ate inquiry or demand.

  Suddenly Dubonnet lifted his head
proudly, bowed to Frisbee and abruptly
passed out.

  The audience caught its breath with re-
lief. Frisbee felt faint. He swayed

                                                     10

slightly, resting his hand on the edge of
the speaker’s table to steady himself.

  Suddenly his eye caught Miriam Pack-
er’s. She looked almost wistful. Fris-
bee in his turn felt a sort of childish yearn-
ing to lean on this woman for support.
And now he seemed to get the support
from her eyes. He spurred himself to
continue his speech and then decided that
it would be better to conclude it.

  “My friends,” he said, “sometimes I am
flooded with a rush of old memories of
this town where I lived as a child.” There
was a slight murmur throughout the audi-
ence. “I really came up here to get ac-
quainted with you, not to make speeches
to you. I believe I have nothing more to
say from this platform, but I hope you
will remain, and let me mingle with you
and chat with you.”

  The simple friendliness of it was effect-
ive. People who had sensed some strain
without knowing what it was suddenly
clapped their hands in generous applause.

  And some of them did remain to greet
him. These were mostly the younger peo-
ple. But while they were shaking his
hand, Frisbee, his nerves still tense and
his senses still sharpened by this after-
noon’s struggle, overheard some scraps of
whispered conversation near him.

  “Did you see what Gass Dubonnet
saw?” came the hoarse sibilants of Dad
Postlewaite. “No wonder he left. He
saw Jack Frisbee’s ghost—an’ so did I—
an’ I ain’t sure that I don’t see it now.
Let’s go.”

  And soon the few people who remained
were drifting toward the rear of the hall.

  Frisbee felt Dunaway’s hand on his
shoulder. “It’s all right, boy. You did
your best, and it was good, too. But
there was a spell in the air today. Gass
Dubonnet brought it with him, I think.
He was here, but he was years away from
us. He looked just like he did the last
time I talked to him at the mill. I remem-
ber he asked me then if I believed in the
transmigration of souls.

  “Well, I’ve got to go to my office for a
few minutes. See you this evening,
George.”

Chapter IV
“I Beg to Be Excused”

MIRIAM PACKER had come for-
ward to the place where Frisbee
was standing, near the platform.
S le had been talking to Dunaway, and he
turned back to her for a moment before

leaving. “All right,” he said, “in just a
few minutes.”

  She smiled at the judge and turned to
Frisbee. She invited him to “supper”
with herself and her school-teacher com-
panion. Frisbee assured her that he was
very glad indeed that it had been found ne-
cessary to call off the meeting at Summit.

  “Well, I’m sorry,” said Miriam, “be-
cause I believe each of these public meet-
ings is important in your campaign. But
I’m glad, too, because I want to visit with
you. I’ll see you about six-thirty. I must
be off now. . Have one little matter of
business to attend to before supper.”

  She gave him a roguish smile at that, as

if the “matter of
business” c o n-
cerned him.
George guessed
that it involved
a visit to the
butcher shop.

  He spent the
next two hours
in very pleasant
anticipa-
tion. Queer, he thought, how he had al-
ways had in his mind a picture of a girl
who looked just like Miriam Packer.

  Miriam’s house was typical of James-
town construction. Its lower floor, front-
ing on the narrow street which bordered
the creek, consisted of two rooms,- one be-
side the other. Its upper floor, reached by
a stairway up the steep hillside, consisted
of four rooms, the two rear ones burrow-
ing back into the hill, the two front ones
perched over the lower story. At this par-
ticular part of the gulch there were no
houses higher up, and the side windows of
Miriam’s rear rooms, the sloping ground
reaching almost to their sills, commanded
a view of the hillside for a considerable
distance both ways.

  Miss Chapin was a sweet-faced girl,
charming and cultivated, though rather col-
orless, George thought, by comparison with
Miriam. But she had a bright and pleas-
ing style of conversation. She had trav-
eled more than Miriam, who had never
been about at all, and she had a somewhat
wider superficial knowledge of the world,
though Frisbee was more impressed by
Miriam’s keenness and soundness of judg-
ment.

  The evening meal passed very pleasantly
indeed. Miss Chapin excused herself soon
afterward, saying that she had been suffer-
ing for several days with a severe cold.

  Miriam sketched her own history,

Oi
62

SHORT STORIES

briefly, for George Frisbee. Her father
had died ten years previously. He was at
that time the sole owner of the Golconda
mine which, however, had pinched out and
suspended operations five years before that.
Gaspard Dubonnet, her father’s engineer
and manager, was granted by his will a
half interest in the property and its pro-
ceeds for life. She was glad of that be-
cause it had given the old man a place to
live.

  “And he insists,” she said, “that the
property will yet make us both rich.”

  Frisbee was searching his memory for a
remark which his father had made and
which his mother had occasionally repeated.
Finally it returned to him. “My father al-
ways said that his fortune was under the
big tree just below the Golconda shaft-
house. Did my father have any interest
in the Golconda?”

  “Well, of course he did at one time.
He was the locator of the original claim.
That was the beginning of his quarrel with
Mr. Dubonnet.”

  “Yes, I know.”

  “But Mr. Dubonnet has been so good to
me. And he is so quiet and retired now,
and so self-sacrificing. I really believe
that at times he hasn’t had enough to eat.
He sold all the machinery at the mine and
the mill and I had hard work to get him
to take half the proceeds. He said that his
life interest in the property didn’t include
the permanent equipment. He said that
was a part of the property itself.”

  “Well, he was right, from a legal stand-
point.”

  “But I’m quite sure that he used his
half, or most of it, to pay off some old
debts and to take care of the taxes. I’ve
finally got him to promise to show me an
account of them. But he says that when
the mine begins to pay again it will be time
enough to reimburse him for what he has
spent to preserve it. He’s very confident
that time will come soon. I—I have rea-
sons to believe he is right.”

  She seemed about to explain further,
when their conversation was interrupted by
the arrival of another guest, Miriam’s cou-
sin, Henry Packer, a shifty-eyed young
man, flashily dressed, who apparently had
been drinking.

  Young Mr. Packer seemed surprised and
not altogether pleased to find Frisbee there,
but he made an effort to be affable. He
conversed agreeably enough, but Frisbee
was at a loss to understand what there
might be in common between this supercili-

ous cheap sport and his serious, sensible
cousin. He gradually reached the conclu-
sion, more by intuition than from anything

that was said,
that there
was absolutely
nothing in
common be-
tween them ex-
cept the tie of
blood.

  Miriam ap-
parently took
only a perfunc-
tory interest in
his conversa-
tion, and the
visitor seemed
to be getting a
trifle impatient.
He appeared to be waiting for Frisbee to
go. The latter caught a glance of inquiry
directed toward Miriam, as if Packer were
seeking to know when they might be rid of
the stranger.

  George had no intention of allowing the
fellow to “sit him out,” but an interruption
presently occurred which changed the situ-
ation for all three.

  Another visitor arrived. It was Gas-
pard Dubonnet. He was carrying a small
heavy satchel.

  For just a moment before the attempt
was made to present him to this visitor,
Frisbee saw Miriam glance with a sort of
apprehension at the satchel and then at
Henry Packer. And he saw Henry Pack-
er look for an instant at the satchel and
then turn his face away from the others
with a covert half-smile. What did it
mean? What was the confidence, involv-
ing a lack of confidence, which existed be-
tween these people?

  Then he looked at Dubonnet. The old
man was standing very erect, dignified, un-
smiling. So he must have looked, thought
George Frisbee, when he slew his father
twenty years ago. So he did look, in
George Frisbee’s memory, as his childish
eyes had turned from his father’s pros-
trate form to the doorway of the saloon
across the street.

  A wave of repulsion seized him, filled
him with sudden nausea.

  He was dimly conscious that Miriam was
speaking. “Mr. Frisbee, let me present
my old friend, Mr. Dubonnet.”

  Before him was Dubonnet’s extended
hand. Frisbee remembered afterward that
that hand, with its long, thin, delicate fin-
gers, was trembling. He recoiled from the

                                                      10

hand as if he had seen his father's blood
upon it.

  “I—I beg to be excused,” he stammered.
His eyes rested for a moment on the face
of his hostess. She was very pale. He
bowed stiffly to her.

  In a dream he heard her say, “As you
wish, Mr. Frisbee.”

  He half groped his way to the door, for
strange visions mingled themselves before
his eyes. In a daze he found his hat and
overcoat. He let himself out in silence,
leaving silence behind him. He staggered
up the street toward the hotel, over-
whelmed, half crushed, under a surge of
conflicting emotions.

  The heavy wet flakes of the driving
snow, and the effort of walking in the
storm had a tendency to cool and steady
him.

  He paused in the doorway of the ho-
tel to brush the snow from his coat. There,
turning for a moment toward the street, he
saw, hurrying past him, one of Miriam
Packer’s visitors of the evening, her cou-
sin Henry. That young man must have
left almost immediately after he did.

  Packer was swaying a little. Perhaps
he had taken another drink. If so, it
must have been from a pocket flask, for he
would hardly have had time to stop any-
where. He hastened unsteadily past the
hotel, muttering and swearing to himself.

Chapter V

A SHOT IN THE NIGHT

FREED from the immediate emotional
pressure under which he had left
Miriam Packer’s house, and en-
deavoring to consider the situation in the
light of reason and candor, Frisbee was
soon blaming himself bitterly for hurting
her. The matter had been beyond her con-
trol and in no wise her fault. After all,
the old murderer was her father’s manager,
and her own partner, agent and trustee.
Apparently she had every reason to feel
grateful to him.

  She had not caused the embarrassing
meeting. When it did occur, what else
could she have done than she did do ?

  He would find an early opportunity to
make amends. He would even seek out
Dubonnet and apologize to him, but he
could not do it tonight. He wanted to
see Miriam before he saw Dubonnet, and
Dubonnet was still at her house. Tomor-
row was Saturday. She would not be at
school tomorrow. He could see her in the
morning before train time. And if he had
10

to stay over a day to make formal apology
to the man who had robbed him of his
parent twenty years ago, why, he would do
that, too.

  In the meantime, what was he here for?
He was not here for a courtship. Certain-
ly he was not here to dig into old wounds,
either of himself or others. He was here
for politics. He was here to make friends.
He might as well forget, for the present,
the early misadventures of the evening and
improve the time remaining. It would do
him good, anyway, to chat with strangers
about ordinary matters.

  The pool-room 011 the corner above
seemed to be open. Buttoning his over-
coat around his throat, he went out into
the storm and entered that place. He
bought a cigar for himself, and one also,
in accordance with political custom, for the
proprietor.

  “I was at your meeting this afternoon,”
said the latter. “You made a good talk.
Wish you’d talked longer, but I s’pose you
wanted to visit with folks you knew when
you were a kid.”

  He smiled roguishly at Frisbee. “Saw
you talking with our school ma’am. Well,
I don’t blame you. Mighty nice girl. She
has my two kids and they think there just
ain’t anybody in the world like Miss Pack-
er. Smart girl, too.”

  Frisbee attempted to steer the talk to
politics. But from state politics, in which
the other seemed little interested, the con-
versation slid into local politics, and thence
back again to other local affairs and to lo-
cal people, including the two whom Fris-
bee particularly disliked to talk about, but
whom he could not help thinking about.

  “Funny,” said the pool-room man, “how
old man Dubonnet got up and went out.
But then, nobody ever knows what’s work-
ing inside that old fellow’s head. Lately
he’s been making occasional calls on Miss
Packer. About once every two or three
weeks. Goes to the city about that often
and calls on the girl generally the same eve-
ning after he gets back, or the next da}',
anyhow. Probably it’s partly on business,
because he always carries a little satchel
that he might have papers in. Odd that
he should take a notion to do that lately,
l>ecause for years he’s hardly budged out
of the mill, except to buy a few provisions.
Some folks think the old boy has been ne-
gotiating a sale of the mine, and has been
getting some money for a first payment,
1>ecause he seems to have a little money
now, and so does the girl.

   “And so does that chap, Packer, her cou-
64

SHORT STORIES

sin, though he hasn’t any interest in the
mine, that anybody knows about. He
goes to the city, too. He’s making up to
the girl, and he acts as if he was jealous of
old man Dubonnet. Seems to think the
old fellow’s tryng to cut him out.”

  “Has he got so far that it’s a case of cut-
ting out ?”

  “We-ell, I can’t say how far Henry’s
got, but I’ll say he sure is attentive to the
lady. Young Caythorne’s been kind of
shining up to her lately, too. Caythorne’s
never seemed to care for that kind of a girl

before. He must have an idea that she’s
coming into a little money, somehow.

  “And I wouldn’t be surprised if old Gass
didn’t think he’d found something in the
mine. There hasn’t been any engineers up
here to look it over, so I don’t think it’s
possible he’s been negotiating a sale. But
occasionally, lately, he’s hired one of the
Quillin boys, up the Creek, to muck some
rock out of the old lower tunnel. He
won’t allow anyone else in the mine, and
believe me, no one’s going to try to get in
without the old man’s permission. He
comes out with them two old long-barreled
pistols, one in each hand. He can shoot
just the same with either hand, and like as
not he’ll do a little target practice, just for
fun.

  “There was a tourist foolin’ around up
there last summer, and old Gass plugged
two holes through his hat, pretty as you
please, one with each pistol. Right or left
hand, it’s all the same to him. I ain’t ever
heard of his missing yet, but I don’t take
any chances myself. Some day he’ll go
an inch under a feller’s hair instead of an
inch over it.”

  In the enthusiasm of his narrative, the
pool-room proprietor had not noticed the
effect that the story of Dubonnet’s marks-
manship was making on his visitor. As
Frisbee listened, his muscles tightened, and
his fists clenched automatically. “My
father never had a chance!” he was saying
to himself. “It was cold-blooded mur-
der.”

  The man behind the counter continued,

“You’d never think, to look at him, that he
knew anything about shooting. They say
he killed several men in duels before he
came to this country. They say he killed
a man right here in this street twenty years
ago.

  “Hey! There he goes, now! Poor old
feller! He doesn’t look much like a fire-
eater, does he?”

  Indeed he did not, a stern ascetic old
man. As the bright lights from the pool-
room window fell in his strong but sharp
and rather pinched features, his fierce black
eyes seemed to pierce the storm as if they
were demanding an answer from the future
or from infinity. It was a baffling face,
noble yet humble, savage yet refined.

  Frisbee mumbled something to the man
behind the cigar-case, and passed out to
the deserted street. He glanced at the thin
figure half a block away and was almost
tempted to follow. But how fast the old
man traveled! In a moment he was lost
to sight in the snow.

  Frisbee returned to the hotel and sat
down by the stove. It would be cold in
his room. In his morbid mood he dreaded
the dark and the cold.

  There was something unnatural about
the old man he had just seen, something
uncanny in his own relation to that man.
Right now he craved warmth and the com-
pany of ordinary commonplace humans.
He would smoke a cigar by the stove and
get back to normal by talking politics with
the clerk and with the doctor, who had
just come in and was hanging his snowy
overcoat on the back of a chair.

  The stove was warm, the cigar was com-
forting. The clerk and the doctor, if not
brilliant, were at least cheerful and sensi-
ble. Thank goodness, there was nothing
unusual or mysterious about either of these
men. And, whether from accident or
from some unexpected considerateness,
they both refrained from talking about
Gaspard Dubonnet. They each accepted a
cigar from Frisbee, as he lighted his sec-
ond.

  Ten minutes later, the three of them
suddenly stiffened in their chairs. There
was the sound of a shot, muffled somewhat
by the storm, but still distinct. To Fris-
bee it sounded as if it came from a distance
of two or three blocks.

  The doctor ran to the door and looked
down the street. “Snow’s coming too
thick, now. Can’t see a thing!” he ex-
claimed.

  The clerk, at his heels, turned back to
answer the telephone.

                                                      10

  “Hello! Yes, this is the hotel. What!
Miriam Packer! Who? Yes, yes, he’s
here!” He faced quickly toward the
others.

  “Doctor Martin,” he called, “Miss Pack-
er has just been shot. Get there, quick!”
Then he spoke into the telephone with a
further inquiry, but the person at the oth-
er end had hung up.

Chapter VI

AN EMBARRASSING MISSION

THE announcement of the catastro-
phe, perhaps a tragedy, had struck
George Frisbee not only with horror
and amazement but with a sudden and
overwhelming sense of frustration, of per-
sonal failure.

  In a rush of mixed feelings he got into
his overcoat as quickly as the doctor and
hurried out with him, without asking or
thinking of asking for permission to go.
He would have been much surprised if
anybody had suggested that he should not
go. Instinctively he felt that he should be
near her.

  Miriam Packer shot! Who could pos-
sibly have wished to do an injury to that
lovable girl? What enemy could she pos-
sibly have made?

  Ah, his own failure had been that he
himself had done her an injury, that very
evening, and that he had not yet atoned!
Would he ever have a chance to atone now ?
Would she pass out of his world on the
very day when he had found her again,
bearing with her to the unknown country,
as a last thought of him, the remembrance
that he had repaid her friendliness with a
cruel hurt? Why, why, had he not gone
back to her immediately, with an apology
and a plea for forgiveness ?

  And if he had been there through the
evening as he had expected him to be, as
she had expected and wanted him to be,
this monstrous and unnatural thing could
not have happened. He would have pro-
tected her. His churlishness had lost him
the great opportunity of his life, had per-
haps cost the life of this splendid woman.

  Young and vigorous as he was, George
Frisbee was hard put to keep up with the
doctor in his rapid progress down the nar-
row street beside the creek, and he was half
a dozen steps behind the physician as they
ran up the long stairway at the side of
Miriam Packer’s house. Miss Chapin
opened the door for them before they had
a chance to ring the bell.

  With the assistance of the people in the
    10

downstairs part of the house, she had car-
ried Miriam to her bedroom. After call-
ing the doctor at the hotel she had called
the sheriff, but he had not yet arrived.
Several other people, neighbors, had come
in, but she had asked them to remain in the
dining room until Dr. Martin had made his
examination.

  The sheriff arrived a moment later, and
Miss Chapin gave the very brief narrative

of what had oc-
curred, which
was simply that
Miriam, while
washing the din-
ner dishes, had
been struck
down by a bul-
let fired through
the window
from the side
hill.

  Several men had gone out there to in-
vestigate, but in the falling and drifting
snow, any tracks which might have been
made by the would-be assassin were almost
instantly obliterated. It had taken a few
minutes to clamber down the steep hill-
side through the snow, and they could see
no one on the street except several people
running toward the Packer house, among
them Doctor Martin and Mr. Frisbee.

  Here, some inquiring glances were lev-
eled at Frisbee. “Yes,” he said, “I was
sitting at the hotel with the doctor when
we heard the shot.”

  The doctor came out from Miriam’s
room.

  “Well,” he said, in response to their anx-
ious looks, “it’s one of those cases where
you can’t tell what will happen. The
wound itself doesn’t seem so bad, though
any gunshot wound in the body is a mighty
serious thing. The bullet—not very large
caliber, I judge—passed completely through
her right shoulder just below the collar
bone. It didn’t sever any important vein
or artery and it seems to be a clean wound.
The danger in these cases is, first, the ner-
vous shock to the patient, and second, even
worse, the danger of pneumonia. A per-
son is extremely likely to contract pneu-
monia after a gunshot wound in the upper
part of the body. We’ll have to use every
precaution to prevent that. If we succeed
she’ll soon be well. Oh, yes, she’s bearing
up wonderfully. But she seems to be wor-
ried about something. She doesn’t seem to
be light headed at all, but she’s extremely
anxious that somebody should go up to the
Golconda mill tonight—right away—and
SHORT STORIES

66

tell Dubonnet what has happened. I’m
sure I don’t know why she thinks it’s so
important, but I do know that her ease of
mind is important, very important indeed
at a time like this.”

  “I’ll go, of course,” said Sheriff Bates
promptly. “But I’ll have to make some
investigation around town before I can
start.”

  The other men were looking at each
other rather sheepishly. They had seemed
almost to shrink into their collars at the
proposed trip in the storm to that uncanny
place guarded by the eccentric old recluse.

  But to George Frisbee the suggestion
came as a heaven-sent opportunity to re-
pair his earlier mistake.

  “I'll go, right away,” he exclaimed eager-
ly. “Please tell Miss Packer that I shall
be very, very glad to go.”

  The doctor looked at him gratefully, the
others admiringly but curiously, as if they
suspected that he was losing his mind.

  Frisbee set out at once for the mill.
The way seemed oddly familiar to him,
even in the storm.

 “She shall know that I can make
amends,” he assured himself.

  But he felt a strong pang of jealousy
that she should particularly want Dubon-
net, of all men, to know immediately of
anything that had befallen her.

           Chapter VII
           "work to do”

THE mill itself, as seen from the vil-
lage earlier in the day, had brought
no sense of recognition to George
Frisbee’s mind. He could not remember
that he had ever seen it before. But he
did distinctly remember the way to it. As
he passed the uiitenanted houses in the de-
serted upper outskirts of the town, even
though he saw them but dimly through the
storm, he knew that he had been this way
many times before. He even remembered
some of the people who lived long ago in
these habitations now standing lifeless and
deserted. In this one had thrived the tur-
bulent Malone boys with whom he had
played in the remote past. And in that
farthest house—yes it was there yet,
though the windows were all gone—had
been old Mother Fridhof who had kept
the fierce billy goat that used to charge at
little boys.

  He had been wont to hurry past the
place twenty years ago when he walked up
that road with his father’s dinner bucket.
But, oh, how pleasant it had been, espe-

cially in summer, to come back down the
mountain with his daddy. How defiant he
had been of the Fridhof goat when his
father was at his side!

  A hundred little circumstances, hidden
in some out-of-the-way corner of his me-
mory, little things forgotten since child-
hood, suddenly came out clear and fresh.

And he remem-

*	bered little sto-
ries that his dad-
dy had told him
about the creek,
stories about the
funny little
gnomes that dug
the gold out of
the middle of the
mountains, and
about the fairies that sprinkled it, in little
bright specks in the sand of the stream
where men could find it if they had faith
and patience. And his daddy had said that
he was trying to find the place where the
little gnomes dug, so that daddy and moth-
er and Georgie could have the things they
needed, and so Georgie could go away to
school when he got bigger.

  And his father had shown him, too, how
the stream was always running away and
hiding from you, how on this very road
you couldn’t see much of it at a time be-
cause it kept curving away from you all
the way to the mine, and there was a high
bank that hid the bottom when you were
on the road, unless you were on the very
edge. And a little boy must be mighty
careful, especially when he was alone, not
to walk off the road.

  But the warning given in childhood
should serve him now, Frisbee reflected.
He must exercise caution because he had
tome to the place where the road began to
curve, and there was real danger that he
might not follow that curve in the blind-
ing snow.

  He had an odd but persistent feeling that
he was being led, or at least that somebody
was preceding him by a very short dis-
tance. Suddenly, in a sheltered spot where
the road turned away from the creek for a
short distance, between a high boulder and
an abandoned building, he was almost posi-
tive that he was following a man’s footsteps.
Of course Dubonnet himself had come this
way within an hour, but his tracks would
doubtless have been completely obliterated
before this. These appeared to be more
recent. Still, even as he looked at them,
they were filled up beyond recognition.

  Soon Frisbee was able to distinguish a

light in the window of the mill. As he
approached, he found that the window on
the south side, nearest to him, was very
high, at least twelve feet from the ground.

  There was no entrance to the building
on this side, though there was a mine tun-
nel door below and a little to the east of
the window. The tunnel entrance was evi-
dently under the mill. Frisbee noticed
that its old plank door was ajar and ap-
parently blocked by the snow about the
base.

  The entrance to the mill floor was evi-
dently on the west side, near the creek.
Yes, the ground ascended rapidly here.
The space between the mill and the creek
was quite narrow, giving barely room for
the road. In fact, the road at this place
was partly on made ground, extending over
a bed of broken mine rock to the retaining
wall or “rip-rap” which kept the creek
from encroaching on the road and the
building. The bottom steps of the stairs
to the mill door had been broken, probably
by the wheels of passing vehicles. There
were two windows on this side, each about
twenty feet from the central door.

  Frisbee passed the southern window,
which was high above his head, and ascend-
ed the steps. He knocked repeatedly but
got no response. He called. He tried the
door. It was locked. He shook it vigor-
ously.

  The northerly window on this side began
about seven feet from the ground. Fris-
bee went to it, and by the exercise of
“chinning himself” pulled himself up un-
til he could get a view of the interior. He
found a slight toe-hold on the logs of the
base of the building, which enabled him
to ease the strain on his fingers.

  His man was there.

  There was a fireplace on the north side
of the room. A wood fire of several logs
was burning there, brightly. At a table
before this fireplace sat Gaspard Dubonnet.
The table was covered with books. Fris-
bee shuddered as he saw beside the books
two long old fashioned single-barreled pis-
tols in an open leather case. But Dubon-
net was apparently not concerned with
either the books or the pistols. He was
playing with a little mound of yellow and
glistening mineral, tossing and fondling
the pieces, his lips moving strangely.

  The man’s hands suddenly ceased their
movements, as if paralyzed. His lips
parted, but became still. His strange
black eyes turned slowly until they looked
full into Frisbee’s own. Then his body
suddenly became tense.

   10

  Frisbee expected to see a pistol leveled
at him, but he himself seemed to be frozen
in his place, unable to move, his aching
fingers incapable of loosening their claw-
like hold on the windowsill.

  Dubonnet was saying something, but
Frisbee could not distinguish the words
through the closed window. He motioned
with his head for Dubonnet to come near-
er. Dubonnet suddenly rose, laid the
pieces of quartz on the table, and advanced
deliberately to the window. His stare at
Frisbee’s eyes was steady, yet unnatural.
From the motion of his lips, he seemed to
be repeating the same words, as he ap-
proached.

  Frisbee’s every muscle was tense as the
old man’s face came within two feet of his
own, on the other side of the glass. Then
he heard the words.

  “Jack Frisbee! Jack Frisbee. Again
tonight! Again tonight!”

  He put his face still closer, and added,
while Frisbee’s scalp prickled, “I will fight
you again, if that is still my destiny, but I
would rather be at peace with you. I have
tried to atone to you—for years I have
tried, and again this very day. How often
have I asked you to come in! Come in!
Come in!”

  With every nerve tingling, Frisbee
nodded his head sideways toward the
locked door. Then he dropped to the
ground and ran to it. The old man opened
it and, as in a trance, motioned him in.

  As the door closed behind him, Frisbee
extended his hand. The old man began
suddenly to tremble.

“Will you pardon me, please?” said
Frisbee huskily. “I owe you an apology.”
“Jack Frisbee! Jack Frisbee! What

do you mean ?
Would you
shake hands
with me twenty
years after I
killed you?”

 It was the
young man’s
turn to tremble.
It was evident
that he had a
madman to deal
with.

  “You are mistaken,” he said, collecting
himself with difficulty. “I am not Jack
Frisbee. I am Jack Frisbee’s son.”

  “Yes, yes, that is the way you come,
now. I saw you, Jack Frisbee, this after-
noon, at the court house.”

  “No, you saw me, George Frisbee, at
68

SHORT STORIES

the court house. You saw me, George
Frisbee, this evening at Miriam Packer’s.
I refused to shake hands with you, then.
Will you let me shake hands now? Please
do not refuse me.”

  The old man stood swaying. Frisbee
caught him by the shoulders. The action
seemed to steady his mind as well as his
body. Then came a queer sound, which
made Frisbee’s flesh creep, but which
brought the other back to sanity. It was a
sliding sound, followed by a distinct thump.
It came from a wooden structure project-
ing slantingly downward into the upper
part of the building, on the far side.

  Dubonnet listened for an instant inquir-
ingly, then he smiled slightly, as if reas-
sured about something.

  “Just a rock falling down the old ore
chute,” he remarked. “They get loosened
occasionally, by moisture in the mine.
That’s why I blocked up the end of the
chute.”

  He passed his hand before his eyes for
a moment, and when he turned them again
at Frisbee they had entirely lost their wild
look.

  “Yes,” he said with simple dignity. “I
am very glad to shake hands with you.”

  He did so gravely.

  “Won’t you be seated, sir,” he contin-
ued. “You have come quite a distance on
a bad road, in a bad night. You have
found me a little upset. I fear I must
have been dreaming.”

  “Thank you, Mr. Dubonnet, I must not
stay. I came for two purposes. One of
them is already performed. That was to
apologize to you for my boorishness earlier
this evening. I hope you will believe that
my apology is sincere, even if it is brief.”

  “You owe me no apology. The debt is
the other way, and is much heavier than
mere words. I would be much pleased if
you would stay a while and talk about—
yourself.”

  With a sort of old fashioned formal
courtcsy Dubonnet waved his visitor
toward a seat by the fire at the end of the
room.

  “No, really, I must burry back. There
has been a crime, perhaps a murder, in the
town this evening. I was commissioned to
tell you, but I want to return quickly and
learn how she is.”

  “She?” repeated Dubonnet, with a sud-
den intake of his breath.

  “Yes, Miss Miriam Packer. Some das-
tard, some would-be assassin, shot her this
evening, through the window of her house.
It happened very shortly after you left.”

  Dubonnet’s eyes had opened wide. “Is
there danger that she may die tonight ?” he
inquired.

  It occurred to Frisbee, later, to wonder
why the question had related so specifically
to “tonight.”

  “The doctor thinks not. He says that
though her condition is very dangerous she
will recover quickly unless she contracts
pneumonia as a result of the wound. That
cannot be determined for a day or two.”

  Dubonnet exhaled his breath, as if with
great relief. But almost immediately the
wild look came into his eyes again. “Go!
Go, at once!” he exclaimed. “But if your
father will come, I do not fear him now.
The pistols—ah, the pistols!” He glanced
at the pair of them, crouching side by side
in their leather case on the table.

  Frisbee feared that his own life was in
danger, yet he also feared to leave the man.

  “Go! Go!” repeated Dubonnet fiercely,
actually shoving him toward the door. “I
mean you no harm, young man. I wish
you well, with all my heart. But you must
go, and go at once. 1 have little time for
what I must do—for Miriam and—and an-
other.”

  Frisbee departed from this extraordinary
interview with his brain in a whirl. After
the punctilious courtesy with which he had
been received, why was he dismissed with
such unceremonious and desperate haste?
What was it that Dubonnet must do in
such a hurry for Miriam—and who in the
world was the “other ?” Why could he not
have been asked to help?

   As he passed down the road he heard
through the storm a sound which puzzled
him a little, a sound of hammering. He
paused and listened. The sound continued
for, perhaps, ten minutes. Well, what-
ever it was, it was none of his business.
Part of the strange old man’s secret, no
doubt.

  During the hour in which he plodded his
slow journey through the heavy snow, the
storm ceased entirely and the stars came
out bright and clear and cold. Glancing
back at the mill he could see the lights
twinkling dimly from Dubonnet’s window.
He was troubled as he thought of the old
man alone there with his crazy delusions.
Vaguely and ineffectually he blamed him-
self for leaving, even though he had vir-
tually been thrown out.

  At the hotel he found the clerk awake
but yawning. Frisbee was evidently the
last guest of the little hostelry to be ac-
counted for.

  “Well, Mr. Frisbee! Understand you

                                                       to

went way up to the mill in the storm. Bad
night for a stroll, I should say! I’ve just
put an oil stove in your room so you can
dry out your clothes. How’d you find the
old gentleman? Did he let you in?”

  “Let me in?” repeated Frisbee wonder-
ingly. “Sure, but I’m worried about him.
How’s Miss Packer?”

  “Getting along as well as he expected,
according to the doctor. He came in and
went to bed an hour ago.”

  “I’d like to see him,” said Frisbee.

  “Oh, don’t bother him now. He said
Miss Packer was asleep and resting easy.
He’s got Mrs. Lovejoy to go over there
and stay in the house so as to spell Miss
Chapin. One of ’em’ll call up the hotel
if anything goes wrong. I’m going to
sleep, myself, but I’ll hear the bell, if it
rings.

  “No, don’t disturb the doctor, Mr. Fris-
bee. He’s had a hard day. Gee, it’s quar-
ter after eleven right now. That’s awful
late for us folks up here in the hills.”
Frisbee still protested. “I’m disturbed
about Mr. Dubonnet,” he said. “I don’t
think it’s safe to leave him up there alone
tonight. He—he seemed to be a little out
of his head.”

  The clerk smiled. “Seeing ghosts, was
he? Well, that’s nothing new with him.
He’s been doing that ever since—for a long
time, now. Don’t worry. That old boy’ll

live forever.
He’s queer, but
he ain’t crazy—
not by a darn
sight—and h e
can jolly well
take care of
himself.”

  Frisbee, worn
out both with
physical fatigue
and with the emotional strain of the day,
got upstairs to his room. His bones ached
as he removed his clothes and hung them in
front of the smoky little oil stove.

  He stretched his tired frame under the
blankets and was soon asleep, but it was a
troubled sleep, a sleep full of weird dreams
and grisly images.

  In those dreams he heard a sound of
hammering, like that which had followed
him from the mill. In those dreams he
heard Dubonnet calling, “Jack Frisbee!
Jack Frisbee!”

  Then, dimly, he realized that it was his
own name that was being called, “George
Frisbee! George Frisbee!”

  And, not dimly at all, he realized that the
  10

hammering was a loud and insistent ham-
mering at his own door.

  Wide awake, he switched on the light
and blinked at his watch. The time lacked
several minutes of three o’clock.

  “George Frisbee! George Frisbee!
Open the door!”

  He opened it and a man pushed his way
in, roughly, a man whose scraggly mus-
tache was full of little melting icicles and
whose overcoat was caked with snow.

  The man held a revolver in his right
hand.

  “George Frisbee,” he said, “it is my duty
to arrest you for the murder of Gaspard
Dubonnet.”

Chapter VIII

TWO PISTOLS

THEY served an early breakfast in
the Jamestown jail. It was brought
by Mr. William Bates, the sheriff’s
eighteen year old son, and it was quite sur-
prisingly good, consisting of ham and eggs,
toast and excellent coffee.

  Young Mr. Bates seemed to harbor no
aversion toward the prisoner.

  “Dad says for me to do anything I can
for you, Mr. Frisbee,” he remarked pleas-
antly, “and mother says she hopes you’ll
like the breakfast.”

  Savory as it was, however, Frisbee had
little stomach for it, though he finished the
coffee. Young Bates informed him that
he would be taken to a coroner’s inquest to
be convened at nine o’clock to investigate
the death of Gaspard Dubonnet.

  “Nine o’clock!” he exclaimed. “May I
use the telephone again ?”

  He had already used it, immediately fol-
lowing his arrest, to summon his partner,
Griswold, by long distance. Now he
called the coroner, Slade, who had been up
most of the night, and was in a very disa-
greeable temper.

  Yes, Slade informed him, the inquest
would be at nine o’clock, and the sheriff
had been ordered to bring him to it, but of
course he would understand that it was for
the district attorney to decide whether he
should be permitted to be present while
other witnesses testified.

  Frisbee protested vigorously. His part-
ner, Griswold, could not reach Jamestown
until noon. Griswold ought to have at
least a day to make some investigation.

  The plea was entirely lost on Slade, who
reminded him that a coroner’s inquest was
not a trial, that a person suspected of or
charged with crime was not entitled to be
70

SHORT STORIES

represented by counsel at an inquest and
that it was his, Slade’s, duty, as a public
official to make his investigation immedi-
ately and while the evidence was fresh.

  Oh, yes, the inquest would be public.
Mr. Griswold would not be barred from
attendance if he should come, but the cor-
oner would not tolerate any interference
with his own investigation or with the evi-
dence.

  Frisbee was unable to get Kenehan, the
district attorney, by telephone. Mrs. Kene-
han informed him, rather cuitly, that her
husband was out investigating the “mur-
der.”

  At nine o’clock, however, when Frisbee
was taken into the cold and dusty offices
of the coroner, where there was already a
considerable crowd, he renewed his protest
to Kenehan. That gentleman, a little more
diplomatic than the coroner, was no less
insistent that the inquest must proceed im-
mediately, though he said that Frisbee
would be at liberty to remain, under guard,
throughout the hearing.

  “Will you tell me something else?” in-
quired Frisbee. “How is Miss Packer this
morning, and what progress has been made
toward discovering who shot her ?”

  “I don’t think I am obliged to disclose
information acquired by my office in the
course of its investigations,” responded the
district attorney icily. “As to her physi-
cal condition, well—she’s alive. That’s all
I know.”

  Doctor Martin was called as the first
witness. He testified that a little after
midnight he had been awakened by a call
from Miss Chapin, who was worried about
the condition of her charge, Miriam Pack-
er; that the hotel clerk expressed regret
at having to rouse him, saying that when
Mr. Frisbee had returned from the mill
about an hour earlier he had wanted to
speak to the doctor about Dubonnet, but
that the clerk had refused to disturb him
on that account.

  The doctor had gone to Miss Packer’s,
he testified further, but had been there only
a few minutes when Hawkins, the night
marshal telephoned to him from the hotel,
stating that Dubonnet had been killed, and
asking him-to go out there immediately to
make an examination.

  Hawkins, he said, had previously
stopped at the livery stable and ordered a
team to drive to the mill. He had called
the sheriff and the coroner, and they all
went together. On arrival there the sher-
iff had asked Hawkins to hitch the horses
on the south side, below the mill, and had

directed the party to proceed to the steps
in such manner as to disturb the snow as

little as possible, and not to go north of
the steps at all.

  Dubonnet had previously been laid by
the marshal on his library table. There
was a bullet hole clear through his body
and he had been dead for, probably, two
hours.

  The coroner seemed surprised at the lat-
ter statement, which evidently did not cor-
respond with his own opinion.

  “Two hours, Doctor? Shouldn’t you say
he had been dead longer than that? You
remember it was nearly two o’clock when
we got there.”

  “Well, it’s hard to tell. We judge it
by several things, the extent to which rigor
mortis has set in, the extent to which blood
has clotted, and in several other ways. No
•—I should not think he had been dead more
than two hours, if that long.”

  The coroner was persistent. “You
wouldn’t care to say, would you. Doctor,
that he could not possibly have been dead
for three or four hours ?”

  The doctor did not seem to regard the
point as of very great importance, but he
was a little nettled.

  “Oh, no, I wouldn’t say it was impossi-
ble. I would say it was extremely im-
probable. Such a conclusion would not
correspond at all with my own professional
experience.”

  Mr. Billy Bates who, in the capacity of
bodyguard for Frisbee, was sitting beside
him, looked at the coroner with a percepti-
ble curl of his lip.

  The doctor proceeded with other details
of the appearance of the body. The bullet
had entered the right arm-pit and had
passed out at the left arm-pit, imbedding
itself in the left arm just below the shoul-
der.

  Was there any other mark of the bul-
let? Yes; it had cut the flesh on the little-
finger side of the right hand and had
ploughed a furrow up the right arm as far
as the elbow, clipping the bone of the el-
bow, the furrow commencing again on the
upper part of the arm and extending until
it reached the place where it entered the

                                                       10

7i

body, in the right arm-pit.

  Would it have been possible for a man
to shoot himself in that manner? No, it
would have been absolutely impossible for
a man to hold a weapon with his left hand
so as to sear both the upper and lower
part of the right arm on the under side,
clear to the shoulder, and shoot himself
horizontally through the body. He could
not have done it by firing the pistol with
his foot. In that case, no matter what the
man’s position, the course of the bullet
would have been upward, not horizontal.

  Could he have aimed the weapon at
himself with his right hand? The doctor,
wriggling his finger experimentally, didn’t
think it possible to fire a weapon with the
right hand so as to cut the fleshy part of
that hand just below the base of the little
finger.

  “Did you see any weapon?” inquired
Kenehan.

  “Yes, one of the old-fashioned single-
shot dueling pistols, which Dubonnet had
for so many years. Yes, that is the pis-
tol.”

   “Had it been fired recently?”

   “Well, it smelt strongly of powder.”

  Frisbee objected that the person who
first found the pistol should be the one to
testify as to its condition. The district
attorney replied, curtly, that he would con-
duct the case in his own way to get at the
truth.

  “Was the bullet which you found in Du-
bonnet’s left arm of the caliber of this pis-
tol?”

  “I judge so, but I’m not sure. I don’t
know much about pistols. Anyway, it was
a little bit battered out of shape by passing
-through his ribs.”

  Judge Dunaway was called as a witness
and identified the pistol as one of a pair
owned by Dubonnet. He had seen them
often, he said. They had been old fash-
ioned when Dubonnet had brought them
from France, “but he always claimed that
they had been made by the best gunsmith
in Paris, and that they were more accurate
than any modern pistol. He said they had
a long record behind them in the old coun-
try.” Judge Dunaway made this state-
ment with a quite nonjudicial disregard for
the hearsay character of such testimony.

   The other pistol, he stated further, was
just like this one. The barrels were about
ten inches long. Each butt had a steel
plate on the bottom.

  It appeared that the plate on this one,
otherwise dull, was now marked with a nar-
row light streak, apparently new, running

    10

parallel with the barrel of the weapon.
Dunaway looked at this streak curiously.
He rubbed it with a moistened forefinger,
and then put the end of his finger to his
tongue. He said nothing, awaiting the
next question.

   “Do you see anything peculiar about that
pistol?”

   “I never noticed that mark on it before.
I’ve seen the pistol many times.”

  “Was there such a mark on the other
pistol?”

  “Not when I last saw it. The pistols
were identical, except that this one always
had a little file-mark on the under side of
the barrel. Here’s the mark. That was
the only way you could distinguish them.”
“When and where did you last see the
other pistol ?”

   “At Dubonnet’s library, in the old mill,
the last time I was up there, a month or
six weeks ago.”

  “Where was it then?”

  “They were both together in the leather
case on his table.”

  “Have you ever seen the pistols other-
wise than to-
gether ?”

  The witness
hesitated a mo-
ment and looked
at Frisbee be-
fore replying,
“Yes; once.”
“When and
where was
that?”

  “That was nearly twenty years ago, in
the street out here. I saw one pistol in
Dubonnet’s hand, and the other one drop-
ping from Jack Frisbee’s hand.”

  Again the cruel, bitter, surge of memo-
ry, for George Frisbee!	'

  “What were the circumstances?” pur-
sued the district attorney.

  Frisbee objected to the question. The
coroner told him that his objections would
not be entertained and that if he should
again disturb the proceedings he would be
returned to jail and left there until his tes-
timony should be required.

  Dunaway, declining to answer, was
threatened with punishment under the
statute requiring witnesses to give testi-
mony at a coroner’s inquest, but Kenehan
said, “Let me ask this question, first. Was
George Frisbee present on that occasion?”
“Yes, but he was a little child, only six
or seven years old.”

  Slade said to Frisbee, “Do you remem-
ber that incident ?,J
72

SHORT STORIES

  “Since I am not permitted to make other
objections,” said Frisbee, “I would like to
remind you that I am not on the witness
stand.”

  “Well, you will be soon!” snapped the
coroner.

  “If I consent to be,” returned Frisbee
quietly. “I believe the Constitution is still
applicable in Gold Creek County, is it not ?”

  The district attorney, who had heard of
the Constitution, even if Slade had not,
approached Dunaway from another angle.

  “Did you ever hear Dubonnet express
any unkindly feeling toward Mr. George
Frisbee?” he inquired.

  “No. On the contrary, I have heard
him express a friendly feeling toward him,
though, as far as I know, he had only seen
George Frisbee once since he was a child
■—until yesterday. But he was always
afraid of Jack Frisbee.”

  “Of—of Jack Frisbee? You mean
twenty years ago, when Jack Frisbee Was
alive ?”

  “No ; 1 mean during all of the last twen-
ty years, after Jack Frisbee was dead. No;
he wasn’t afraid of him. That doesn’t
quite express it. But he believed Jack
Frisbee was coming back to fight with him
again.”

  The people in the court-room were lean-
ing forward, with intense interest. A light
began to dawn on George Frisbee.

  “Mr. Kenahan,” said he, “if the witness
is willing to answer, I will withdraw my
objections to his stating the circumstances
of the death of my father.”

  “All right,” said Kenehan, rather un-
graciously. Turning to Dunaway he con-
tinued, “Are you willing to state them
now?”

  Dunaway hesitated a moment. Then he
said, “I don’t know all that preceded it.
But there was a quarrel in Jim Slade’s—
in the old Saddle Rock—saloon. Oh, yes;
] was there. I was generally there, and
so were Dubonnet and Jack Frisbee. We
knew that Frisbee had located the Golconda
mine, and it seemed he’d given a power of
attorney to Dubonnet, and he accused Du-
bonnet of selling it to Fred Packer for a
song.

  “Well, one word led to another, and
Frisbee—he’d been drinking a little too
much, 1 guess—called Dubonnet a cheat
and a crook. Dubonnet didn’t have a gun
on him, and neither did Frisbee, and Du-
bonnet didn’t slug him like an American
would have done, but he says, very cold
and polite, like a French grandee, ‘Will
you fight, Mr. Frisbee?’ And Jack says,

‘The sooner the better, and the longer the
better.’

  “Dubonnet lived upstairs, right there in
Slade’s hotel, over the saloon, and he goes
up, very dignified, and gets his pistols, in
their leather case. Yes, that’s one of them.
He hands ’em to Slade and he says, ‘Here
are Romulus and Remus, the wolf-whelps
with the bark and the deadly bite. Take
either one you want, Mr. Frisbee,’ he says
to Jack, and then, when Jack had taken
one of the pistols, he says to Slade, ‘You
toss a coin, and the man that calls it right
stays here in the doorway. The other
goes across the street, and when he gets
there and turns around, you'll holler,
‘Fire!’ and we’ll shoot. There’s just one
shot apiece.’ He bows to Frisbee, very
polite, and he says, ‘Is that satisfactory,
Mr. Frisbee?’ ‘Suits me, fine,’ says Jack.

  “And Jack calls the coin wrong, so he
goes across the street. The pistol that he
had was the other one, Remus, but they
were exactly alike, except for this little
file-mark.

  “I always thought that Jim Slade hol-
lered ‘Fire!’ just a second before Frisbee
got turned around so as to get a good
chance to aim, but I might be wrong. Of
course we were all over in the other side
of the saloon, by the window farthest from
the door, and we ducked down pretty low,
too. Anyway, they both fired, once, and
lack Frisbee was killed. He never touched
Dubonnet. I believe his bullet is in the
wall over the saloon door yet.”

  “What did he say after he was shot?”
inquired the district attorney, gripping the
arms of his chair. He had heard the story
a thousand times, but now it took on for
him a professional interest.

  Again the witness hesitated.

  “Go ahead, as far as I’m concerned,”
said George Frisbee, nerving himself to
hear his own recollection confirmed. The
district attorney shot him a look of mingled
rebuke and incredulous pity. “Do you re-
member what he said?” he asked the wit-
ness.

  “I remember it mighty well. He said,
‘You ain’t got me, Gass Dubonnet. You
can’t get me! I’ll stay right with you till
I get my rights. Rights! Rights for my
wife and kid!”

  “Was his kid the def—Mr. George Fris-
bee. here?”

  “George Frisbee was the only kid he
had, and he ran up—he was on his way
from school—just as his dad dropped to
the sidewalk.”

  Everybody breathed deeply at this nar-

                                                       10

ration, by an eye-witness, of the old story
which seemed to have some connection with
the recent tragedy. Mr. Kenehan at-
tempted to establish that connection.

  “You say that Dubonnet saw the defend-
ant—Mr. George Frisbee, I mean—only
once since that time?”

  “Well, he saw him yesterday, of course,
at the court-house, and perhaps several
other times. I only know of one previous
time, and I only know that by what Dubon-
net told me.”

  “What did he say?”

  Dunaway looked inquiringly at Frisbee.
“Go ahead, as far as I am concerned,”
said George.

  “Well, he told me he had seen Jack
Frisbee on the street, in Denver.”

  “Jack Frisbee?”

  “Yes, that’s what he said. But then he
was always seeing Jack Frisbee. I told
him he must have seen George Frisbee, his
son, and he said yes, he’d heard of George
Frisbee and that he seemed to be a fine
young man, from all reports, and duing
well, and that he wished him luck. And
then he said that he’d thought about it for
a good many years and that he didn’t be-
lieve Jack Frisbee did have his rights in
the mine deal, and he’d like to make it up
to him if he could.”

  “What do you mean when you say that
he was always seeing Jack Frisbee?”

  “Well, that was a persistent fancy with
him. You know he had got interested in
spiritualism and transmigration of souls,
and all that sort of
thing. He said that
Jack Frisbee used to
come and look into
his window at

night-”

 George Frisbee
shuddered so violently that many people
looked at him, and the witness paused.

  “—used to come and look in his window
at night, and used to tell him to keep the
pistols ready, for they were going to fight
it out again.”

  The night marshal, in the front row of
the audience suddenly cried out, “An’ that
other pistol wasn’t nowhere in the room
when I found Gass Dubonnet.”

Chapter IX

CAN GHOSTS KILL?

SLADE was distinctly annoyed. So
was the district attorney. The in-
vestigation was getting a little out of
hand, it seemed. This was supposed to

be a plain inquest into facts, not into the
realm of the supernatural. It must be
brought back to earth.

  To George Frisbee, wondering about the
absence of one pistol, whereas he had very
distinctly seen them both an hour or two
before Dubonnet’s death, Pete Hawkins,
the marshal, soon contributed another con-
tradiction on a minor detail.

  The witness was greatly agitated as he
began his story. He said he had been rid-
ing around Jamestown all evening, looking
for a trace of some person who might have
shot Miriam Packer. He knew that Du-
bonnet had been at her house earlier in the
evening. He finally rode out to the mill,
starting from town a few minutes after
eleven. But it was slow going, on account
of the snow, and his horse continually get-
ting his feet balled up.

  No, it wasn’t snowing then. It had
stopped, probably half an hour before he
started.

  He finally got up to the south side of the
mill, he said, and was going to tie his
horse to the bolt of the old tunnel door,
but when he got near it he observed that
the door was nailed up.

  Frisbee distinctly remembered that it
had been open when he observed it.

  “Ask him if he’s sure of that,” he said,
in an undertone, to the district attorney.

  Kenehan looked at him sharply. “What
do you know about it?” he inquired.

  The witness had overheard the colloquy
apparently, for he hastened to answer. He
seemed very anxious to get along with his
story.

  “I certainly am sure, because I noticed
it awful particular, an’ I’ll tell you why.
Gosh!” he ejaculated, running his hands
through his hair, “I guess I know. I was
sittin’ my horse there for a minute. It was
kind of in a shelter, an’ I was lookin’ at
that plank door to see if there was a place
where I could tie old Dandy, because I
didn’t want him to get impatient and wan-
der back home without me while I was call-
in’ on Mounseer Dubonnet.

  “1 noticed that it was nailed up good and
tight. The snow was kind of tramped
down in front of it. That door was made
of inch planks, the regular kind that you
buy for a foot wide, an’ that run about
eleven inches, but they wasn’t all the same
length. There was one of ’em, I reckon,
eight or ten inches shorter than the oth-
ers, an’ that left a little porthole through
the bottom of the door at the end of that
plank.

  “Well—so help me, Mr. Kenehan, while
74

SHORT STORIES

I was lookin’ at that door I suddenly seen
a pair of eyes lookin’ at me from that hole.
Old Dandy seen ’em, too, an’ he gave a
sudden snort an’ jumped away from there
like he’d seen a ghost, an’ I believe he had.
If an animal an’ a man both see a ghost,
it’s there, ain’t it ?”

  The audience seemed in no mood to
laugh, but the district attorney smiled in a
superior manner. “Did you investigate
the ghost that looked at you through the
hole in the door ?”

  “Yes; I did, Mr. Kenehan. I do claim
that I ain’t no coward, an’ I did that very
thing—a little later. An’ I’m sure it was
a ghost, because I didn’t find it there an’
because—because I did see it—it must ’a’
been it—at the other place.”

  “Other place?”

  “Yes, in the air in front of Gass Du-
bonnet’s north window. You see, it was
like this. Dandy had shied away from
that door awful quick. I didn’t want to
have the thing in the rear of us, so I man-
aged to get him around to the west side of
the mill, around the corner beyond the
steps. I got my gun out and watched that
corner that we’d just come around, but I
couldn’t get Dandy to face back, he was
that nervous, so I had to kind of turn in
the saddle. Well, nothin’ come off after
we’d waited there a minute, an’ I began to
think maybe we’d made some fool mistake,
an’ I’d better go on an’ finish my errand.
An’ then I looked around again, in front
of Dandy this time, to see where I could
leave him. We was beyond the steps, an’
almost to the north window. It was
propped open, a little, with a stick or some-
thin’, I suppose—just a little, perhaps three
or four inches.”

  “Propped open!” thought George. “It
was closed tight, when I raised myself by
the sill to look through it.” He hung
breathless on the witness’ next words.

  “ ‘An’,’ thinks I, ‘I won’t have to hitch

Dandy at all. I
can just talk
through the win-
dow to old
Gass.’ Because,
you see, his light
was still burn-
ing, an’ I knew
he must be up.
He sits up—he
used to sit up—
half the night,
readin’ them queer books. That’s what
Judge Dunaway says.”

  “Never mind what Judge Dunaway

says,” cautioned the coroner. “What did
you see?”

  “Well, I’m tellin’ you, ain’t I? Good
God, I seen enough! I’d moved Dandy
up a step or two. His head was in front
of the window, when I heard Gass holler,
inside. An’ then—my God, Mr. Slade, it
makes my blood run cold!—then the shot
came, an’ just that minute—right with the
shot—somethin’ jumped or flew away from
that window, above the road, right in front
of me!”

  “Something! Well, what in the world
was it ?” inquired the district attorney,
leaning forward.

  “Good Lord, Mr. Kenehan, I wish I
could tell you! Dandy reared up back-
ward, whinnyin’ pitiful—a kind of whin-
nerin’ shriek, an’ dumped me off in the
snow, an’ ran home. Mr. Kenehan, I hear
animals can tell a ghost quicker’n a human
can. I know I can’t tell what the thing
was. It was somethin’ bright. It seemed
as if you could see through it. It was—
Why, I think it was round, an’—an’ about
as big as a dinner plate. Well, I dunno,
either. It might ’a’ been bigger or smaller
than that.

  “Now, Mr. Kenehan, I ain’t no coward,
an’ you know it. I’ve been in all kinds
of gun fights, an’ sometimes against some
pretty bad hombres, but I hadn’t never
fought with no ghosts-. I just got back
against the wall an’ stood there, with my
gun in my hand, for I don’t know how
many minutes.

  “An’ nothin’ at all happened, an’ I didn’t
hear nothin’ at all, an’ then I kinda begun
to come to myself, an’, thinks I, ‘There
ain’t no ghost lookin’ for me. An’ any-
way, I’m an officer of the law, lookin’ for
a criminal.’ An’ finally I got up my nerve
to holler, ‘Gass! Gass Dubonnet!’ I
didn’t get no answer. My own voice kinda
give me a little courage, as you might say.
An’ then I went up the steps to the door,
an’ knocked on it, an’ then pounded an’
kicked on it an’ shook it, but I couldn’t
raise a sound inside. The door was locked,
all right enough. I stuck my jackknife in
the key-hole an’ found the key was in it.

  “An’ then I looked for somethin’ to
stand on, to look through the window.
An’ I had to go ’round by the tunnel door
again. God! It sure did give me the
creeps, but I remembered I had my electric
flashlight—I’d been so flustered I’d forgot
all about it before—an’ I turned it on that
little hole at the bottom of the door, an’
there was nothin’ there at all. An’ 'I
realized that the thing must have flew away

from the north window. Just the same, I
looked inside the hole to see if I could see
any tracks, though I don’t believe ghosts
make tracks. Do they, Mr. Kenehan?
Anyway, there wasn’t any. No, I didn’t
put my hand in. No, sir, I didn’t want
some skeleton to grab it. The space inside,
near as I could tell, seemed to have been
swept—there was nothin’ that would show
any tracks.

   “But ghosts don’t make tracks, I’m sure,
because, later, I looked with my light all
over the ground from the north window to
the creek. You could see real plain with
the electric torch. I didn’t disturb the
snow. I didn’t go any further than Dan-
dy’s front hoofs had gone just before he
jumped. There was some holes in the
snow; partly filled up, like as if somebody
had gone to the north window and back to
the steps not long before the snow had
stopped. But there 'was no fresh tracks
on top of the snow anywhere around or
near that north window—no, sir; not as
much as a snow-bird. Of course, as I said,
the snow around the south side of the
building an’ near the tunnel door had been
pretty well tracked up.

  “Well, I got hold of an old ore-car,
there, an’ managed to tip it up on end, so’s
I could climb up 011 it an’ look through
the south window. Gass’ light was burn-
in’ bright, and there was a bright fire in
the fireplace, an’ through the window I
seen Gass lyin’ with his body forward on
the table, stretched out toward the win-
dow that that thing had flew away from.
His right arm was stretched out ahead of
him, an’ the pistol was near his hand.
There was a pool of blood under his chest,
drippin’ down from the table to the floor.

   “Well, I managed to get an iron handle
off that ore car, an’ smashed in the door—
it was a hard job—an’ got in. Gass’ pis-
tol barrel was still warm, but he was dead-
er’n a door nail. There was a pile of gold
nuggets 011 the table. Sonic of ’em was
pretty big, an’ they all seemed fairly clean.

   “His dead eyes was open wide, but they
didn’t look crazy at al-1, like they used to
sometimes when he was alive. An’ he had
the peacefulest expression I ever saw on
him. Looked just as if he’d died happy.”

  “How far was he from the window?”
asked the coroner.

   “Well, I should say all of twenty feet.
It’s a great big room. But the table ain’t
been moved. You can measure it.

  “Now, Mr. Kenehan,” he continued,
“here’s something queer. That window
that the thing had flew away from was

    10

closed an’ locked. The other windows wa
closed and locked an’ nailed down. There
was only one door, an’ that had been
locked, an’ I’d broke it open to get in.
There was a trap door leadin’ down under
the mill, into the old tunnel, but that was

locked above,
with a strong
padlock an’ liasp.
An’ besides that,
the tunnel door
was nailed up. as

I’ve told you.
There had been
an ore-chute go-
ing into the build-
ing when it was
used for a mill. That’s over on the other
side, away from the window, through the
top of the wall. It was nailed up tight.
There positively wasn’t any way for a hu-
man being to get into that room, or out of
it. except by the door where I came in or
the window where the thing had jumped
away. Nothin’ or nobody else came out
while I was there, or after the shot. But
when I got in, there was no one in the
room except me an' Gass Dubonnet’s body.
There was only one pistol in the room.
An’ Gass couldn’t have shot himself with
that pistol, as the doctor says.”

  “Well, then,” said Kenehan impatiently,
“what’s the answer? You seem to know
so much about the supernatural! Who did
shoot him?”

  “Mr. Kenehan,” said the witness hum-
bly, “that’s what we’re here to find out, I
reckon—but I know, now.”

  “You know!” shouted the district at-
torney. “How can you know?”

  “I know from what Gass Dubonnet said,
when he hollered, just lie fore the shot.”
Kenehan leaned back in his chair and
stared at the witness.

  “Well, what did he say?”

  “He hollered out loud, ‘The pistols are
ready. Jack Frisbee! Fire!’ ”

A WOUNDED HORSE

PETE HAWKINS, though a plain
and matter-of-fact person, was not
insensible of the effect which his
astounding narration produced upon the
audience and upon the six men of the cor-
oner’s jury. Those gentlemen all shiv-
ered a little, even two of them who had
been sitting with rather scornful expres-
sions during the earlier part of the recital.

experience again, wiped with a red cotton
handkerchief a brow which was sweating
freely in this cold, damp room.

  In the tension of the moment, the open-
ing of the street door created a slight but
welcome diversion. With the entering of
a gust of outside air, the thoughts of the
occupants of the room turned a little
toward normalcy. The man who came in
with that fresh air was Griswold, Frisbee’s
partner, just arrived from the station.

  “Good morning, gentlemen,” he said, in-
dicating Kenehan, Slade and the jury, with
a comprehensive bow. “I’ll sit here beside
Mr. Frisbee, if I may.”

  Slade started to tell him that he could
not, but was deterred by a look in Fris-
bee’s eye. And the district attorney whis-
pered, “Don’t make this too strong, Tom.
It’ll cause a reaction.”

  “Sorry I had to interrupt,” remarked
Griswold pleasantly, though he sensed the
hostility. “Please proceed.”

  “Let’s go back a little now, Mr. Haw-
kins,” said Kenehan, really gratified at an
interruption which seemed to draw the sit-
uation a little away from its supernatural
atmosphere. “Let’s go back to the time
when you heard the shot. Did it sound
from outside the room or from inside
it?”

  “That’s the funny thing,” replied the
witness. “I can’t just tell. It seemed to
come from inside and it seemed to come
from right in front of me, too. The more
I think back to it, the more it seems as if
it came right from the window in front of
Dandy’s nose. But it was a funny sound-
in’ kind of a shot, a kind of a ghost
shot-”

  “Let’s not put any ghosts in this thing,
now. It had a real sound didn’t it ?”
“Ye-es, but—I’m try in’ to tell you—it
had a funny kind of a sound.”

  “Well, well, now what do you mean by
that ?” pursued the district attorney, great-
ly annoyed.

  “I mean I never heard any shot just like
it, and I’ve heard lots of shots, too. The
only way I can describe it is to say it was
a kind of a long-sounding shot. I don’t
mean it wasn’t sharp. It was sharp
enough, but the crack of it seemed to kind
of rise a notch, just a tiny fraction of a
second after it first started. Instead of
going ‘bang,’ real short and quick, like an
ordinary pistol shot, it kinda went ‘ba-ang,’
an’ that thing jumped away from the win-
dow just as the shot sounded.

  “I tell you what I think, Mr. Kenehan

  “Well, you needn’t tell us any more
ghost stories,” said the district attorney.
“What we want is the plain facts.”

  “I wish you’d let him finish his answer,
Mr. Kenehan,” volunteered one of the jur-
ors, “it may throw some light on the situ-
ation.”

  Kenehan waved his hand resignedly.
“Oh, all right, all right! Give us the bene-
fit of your theory, Mr. Hawkins.”

  “Well, Mr. Kenehan,” resumed the wit-
ness, “there’s a lot of things that us ordi-
nary folks don’t know about. We don’t
know much about spirits. But there’s a
little thing—I mean two little things—that
I found there, that makes me believe that
Gass Dubonnet tried to get the—the—to
get Jack Frisbee to agree to somethin’ an’
they couldn’t agree, an’ they got mad, an’
then they had their duel again, an’ this time
Jack Frisbee shot him.”

  The district attorney waved his hands
above his head in desperation. “Ghosts!
Ghosts! You’ve got ghosts on your brain,
Hawkins! Get rid of your ghosts, and get
down to sense. We know that George
Frisbee, a living man, a young and active
man, was at the mill very shortly before
Dubonnet was killed. We know that that
living man had a reason to hate Dubon-
net-”

  “Stop it, I demand!” shouted Griswold.
“What kind of fair play do you call this?
What semblance of legality has such a
statement? Mr. Coroner, I protest against
this-”

  “Oh, well,” said George Frisbee qui-
etly, “I was there, about an hour and a half
before midnight. I have nothing to con-
ceal.”

  The coroner and the district attorney
looked at him in amazement.

  “But,” continued Frisbee, “why not let
the witness proceed ? He is telling an hon-
est story and, whether his conclusions are
correct or not, he evidently has some more
facts to tell. Why not ask him what was
the thing, or the two things, which he
found there, to give him the idea which he
has ?”

  “They was two pens,” interrupted the
witness, without waiting for the question
to be put by the district attorney.

  “Two pens!” repeated the latter, in per-
plexity.

  “I saw two pens, in cut-off penholders,
on the table this morning,” stated the cor-
oner, disregarding the order of proce-
dure.

  “That’s them,” said the witness. “I

                                                      to

picked ’em up from the floor. Two new
pens, in penholders that had been cut off
with a jackknife so they was about four
inches long. Both pens had the points
split open, just as if two men had started
to write with ’em, an’ then got mad, an’
jabbed ’em down hard on the table or
somethin’.”

  Judge Dunaway, who had been follow-
ing the testimony with a very thoughtful
and studious expression, tiptoed over to
the district attorney and whispered some-
thing to him. Then he looked at George
Frisbee and smiled.

  Kenehan addressed the witness. “Did
you find those pens on the table?”

  “Why—why, no,” replied Hawkins, as
if the idea had just come to him. “I found
’em on the floor—on the floor just under
the north window.”

  The witness seemed vaguely disturbed,
as if he had overlooked the significance of
this fact, and as if it might cast a doubt on
his theory. Then he brightened.

  “The thing—the ghost—must have taken
them to the window,” he added reflectively,
“an’ dropped ’em before it went out. Or
perhaps Gass started to hand him a pen at
the window.”

  The district attorney himself smiled at
this hypothesis.

  One of the jurors, who thought it was
time to display a little practical common
sense, remarked, “I think, Mr. Coroner,
that we ought to see the premises while the
snow is still fresh and before conditions
change.”

  “I intend to take you there right away,”
replied Slade. “You may go, too, if you
wish, Mr. Griswold,” he added indulg-
ently.

  “Why, certainly I'm going,” said Gris-
wold quietly.

  “In the meantime, Mr. Hawkins,” said
the coroner, ignoring the lawyer’s attitude,
“have you anything more to say ?”

  “Yes, somethin’ else, but it’s somethin’
I don’t understand. I don’t see why a
ghost should have any grudge against a
horse, especially poor old Dandy. He’s a
gentle, harmless critter. But that thing
cut him—twice.”

  “Cut him!” exclaimed the coroner and
the district attorney simultaneously.

  “Yes, gentlemen, that’s just what it did.
You know, Mr. Kenehan, after I’d come
back here to town on foot, an’ called you
an’ the doctor, an’ Mr. Slade, an’ the sher-
iff, an’ arrested Mr. Frisbee, like you said
for me to do, I went home and let Dandy
into the barn. He was whinnerin’ an’ cry-
in’ outside. I was so excited I didn’t
notice anything wrong with him, except
that the poor beast was awful cold an’ mis-
erable. I put a blanket over him an’ tied
him in his stall. Well, this mornin’ I
noticed that he had a little cut across his
nose, an’ another one, quite a deep little
cut or jab, in his neck, just in front of the
right shoulder. The cut on his nose was
raw, but had started to scab over a little.
The place 011 his shoulder was swollen up
pretty bad.

  I started to wash it out with some weak
carbolic acid solution, but Dandy quivered
an’ jerked so that I don’t believe it did
much good.”

  Judge Dunaway thoughtfully took off
his glasses, wiped them, and put them in
their case, as if the principal work of the
day was concluded.

  Others in the court-room stared blankly
at Hawkins, wondering what this strange
and apparently irrelevant detail could pos-
sibly have to do with the strange and un-
natural story just told by this straightfor-
ward and honest man.

"find cousin henry”

ILL you be sworn, George Fris-
bee?” inquired the coroner.

  “Just a moment, Mr. Coroner,”
interposed Griswold. “I understand that
Mr. Frisbee has no objection to being
sworn, but I am going to advise him
against it, for the present. He is arrested
on a charge of murder. This inquest is
speeded up, over his protest, without even
the elementary fairness of allowing his
counsel to be present at its commencement.
The whole proceeding seems to me a pal-
pable attempt to convict him before he is
tried. I am convinced that his own can-
dor and frankness would be used-”

  “That will do, Mr. Griswold,” snapped
the coroner. “He doesn’t have to testify,
and it isn’t your province to make a speech
to the coroner’s jury, as you very well
know. His reasons for not taking the wit-
ness stand are immaterial. The jury can
draw their own conclusions.”

  “I’m willing to trust the jury, but I’m
not willing to trust George Frisbee’s per-
sonal and political enemies. I-”

  The coroner rapped with his gavel,
drowning the flow of words.

  “Silence!” he shouted. “This session is
adjourned. The jury will accompany the
coroner and the district attorney to the
Golconda mill. The sheriff will keep
George Frisbee in custody at the jail.”
“Mr. Slade,” said the sheriff, “wait a

minute till I give
you a note to my
men. I’ve posted
guards on the
road about a
hundred yards
each side of the
mill.”

  “What d i d
you do that
for?” said
Slade, with sud-
den and unaccountable vexation. “It
wasn’t necessary.”

  “I did it on Judge Dunaway’s advice,”
replied the officer.

  “A very wise precaution, sheriff,” said
Griswold. “It is not only necessary to
see that the mill is not disturbed, but—”
he looked Slade squarely in the eye and
continued deliberately—“where a man is
accused of a murder, committed at the
mill, and the ground is covered with snow
that fell before the murder, it is important
to keep that sheet clear—to show that the

accused man’s tracks were not in the snow
after it stopped falling.

  Slade and Kenehan exchanged the look
of conspirators who have been caught,
and each of whom desires to shift the
blame to the other. Several of the jurors
glanced at each other knowingly.

  Dunaway looked at Griswold with high
approval. “Just exactly what I thought,
Mr. Griswold,” said he, “and I wish you’d
take me on as associate counsel for the de-
fense.”

  “By the way, Kenehan,” added Gris-
wold, “let me ask by what authority you
are keeping Frisbee locked up. Have you
filed any complaint against him ? Has any
grand jury indicted him? If not, I’m go-
ing to demand his release today on habeas
corpus.”

  Kenehan was in an embarrassing posi-
tion. He could, of course, prevent Fris-
bee’s release by filing a formal complaint
for murder and, as a commitment on this
charge was not bailable, Frisbee would be
kept locked up until his trial—until after
election. Until after election—that was
the trouble. If he didn’t file such a com-
plaint he might be subject to some criti-
cism; but if he did he would probably be
accused of taking an unfair advantage of
a political rival by detaining him so that
he could not present his case to the people.

  Frisbee was well respected throughout
the state. People generally would not be
inclined in advance to believe that he was
guilty, even with considerably stronger evi-
dence than had yet been discovered. And,
in any event, Frisbee could not get away
without his knowledge. He could not pos-
sibly walk over the precipitous snow-cov-
ered mountains. The only way out was
down the railroad track. The only pre-
caution necessary was to keep an eye on
the track and to watch the departure of
the daily train.

  It suddenly dawned on Kenehan that un-
der the circumstances it was the height of
political folly to detain Frisbee. Slade
had put him up to this. Slade was a fool.
Well, he would undo this folly as rapidly
as possible. Generosity, confiding and
noble generosity, was the correct—indeed,
the only permissible—play.

  “Now, now, Mr. Griswold,” he said
rather pompously, “we plain country law-
yers are perhaps a little too punctillious,
sometimes, in the performance of our
duty. Personally, I don’t believe Mr.
Frisbee is guilty of this crime. But an
atrocious crime has been committed. Mr.
Frisbee was on the scene—by his own ad-

                                                         10
THE GHOST OF THE GOLCONDA	79

mission—at least a very short time before
the crime. He had a possible motive,
though —er, personally, knowing his high
character—I would be the last man to at-
tribute it to him. Under the circumstances
it seemed to Mr. Slade and myself that it
was our duty, as sworn officials, to detain
him until some investigation could be made.
However,” here he swelled to noticeably
larger proportions, “I think I am justified,
since—er—no formal charge has yet been
filed—to release him on his promise not to
leave this town without my permission.”
Thus establishing both his dictatorship
and his magnanimity, in the minds of his
fellow townsmen, Kenehan bowed to Fris-
bee and waved his hand with the liberal
gesture of benevolent royalty. Dunaway’s
lip curled a little scornfully. Griswold
smiled faintly. But the jurors and the
others present—who included most of the
inhabitants of the little town—applauded
vigorously, with generous disregard of the
proprieties of the court-room.

  “Ain’t that just like old Charlie Kene-
han !” “He’d never think ill of anybody.”
“He’s too high-minded to suspect anybody
of a crime.” “Trouble with Charlie is he’s
too generous to be a district prosecutor.
We’ll have to elect him to a higher office.”
These and similar expressions were
heard on every side. Kenehan glowed as
he realized that he had increased his popu-
larity and extricated himself from a diffi-
cult situation by one clever stroke.

  Frisbee was tactful enough to play to
the same lead. “That is very generous of
you, Mr. Kenehan,” he said, warmly, “and
I want to assure you that I shall stay right
here in Jamestown until this mystery is
solved.”

  A murmur of approval was his reward.
Dunaway gripped his hand. “Come on
with us to the mill,” he exclaimed.

  “No,” said George, to the surprise of
everybody, and the suspicion of some. “I
have an errand to do here in town. I’ll
wait for you at the hotel.”

  Slade, the only person in the building
who was not pleased at any part of what
had happened, glowered at him and whis-
pered to the pimply faced youth who acted
as his clerk and general assistant. And
when Slade, the jury, Kenehan, Griswold
and Dunaway departed for the mill, in
Suggs’ bus, George discovered that he was
followed from the room.

  Of course he had not expected to be at
liberty without being under surveillance.

  Not pausing even to return to the ho-
tel, he went at once to Miriam Packer’s.

    10

The young man, Caythorne, stood below
him on the sidewalk, as he knocked gently.
Miriam’s teacher companion opened the
door. She seemed greatly surprised to see
him, but was quite friendly and asked him
in.

  “How is Miriam—Miss Packer?” he
inquired eagerly.

  “Getting along very nicely. The doctor
says it was a clean wound and is well
sterilized. If he can keep her from hav-
ing pneumonia she’ll be sitting up in a cou-
ple of days, and will probably be out in a
couple of weeks. She kept asking if Mr.
Dubonnet knew of her wound—got a bit
flighty over it, in fact. Along about mid-
night she was delirious for a little while.
Seemed to think something horrible was
happening. Kept saying—well, 1 don't be-
lieve I ought to tell you.”

  “Please do.”

  “Well—I will. I don’t understand it,
but it may be important. She kept saying,
‘Dear Georgie, I’m so sorry.’ ”

  “I think I understand,” said Frisbee
solemnly.

   “I was quite alarmed about it,” continued
Miss Chapin, “and I called the hotel and

J	got Doctor Mar-

yj	He came over and

medicine to put
her to sleep, and told me, whatever I did,
not to excite her, but to keep her quiet.

  “But then the doctor and 1 got pretty
excited ourselves”—here Miss Chapin low-
ered her voice—“because, just as he was
putting on his coat, Mr. Hawkins tele-
phoned from somewhere for him to come
out to the mill, and then he took me out
into the kitchen and told me that Mr. Du-
bonnet had been shot, too.

  “And it was odd about Miriam. I hadn’t
given her any of the doctor’s medicine, but
when 1 went back into her room, after the
doctor had gone, she was entirely in her
right mind, but she was crying. She said,
‘And so he’s dead, poor man! I might
have known it.’ I thought we’d been aw-
fully quiet in the kitchen, but she must
have overheard us. Still, the doctor didn’t
tell me that Mr. Dubonnet was dead. He
only said he had been shot. Well, anyway,
8o

SHORT STORIES

Miriam went to sleep after that, and she’s
still asleep.”

  A faint call from the adjoining room
proved that Miss Chapin was mistaken.
She left the visitor, but returned immedi-
ately.

  “Miriam just asked if you were here.
She says, ‘Tell him to find Cousin Henry.’
She’s quite excited. You’d better go, Mr.
Frisbee. See if you can get Doctor Mar-
tin over here right away. I’m afraid.”

  The doctor, however, entered the house
as Frisbee left it. He greeted the young
man briskly but not unpleasantly .

  Frisbee walked back to the hotel, fol-
lowed by his shadow, Caythorne.

  “Find Cousin Henry.” Well, that ought
to be easy enough. He couldn’t very well
get out of town. But wait a moment.
Where could he be? When had he been
seen last? At Miriam Packer’s house, and
coming from it, shortly before she was
shot, so far as Frisbee knew.

  But it was a little odd that with most
of the people of Jamestown at the coroner’s
inquest this young man, who had no regu-
lar occupation which would keep him away,
had been conspicuous by his absence.

  Nor was he present when the coroner’s
little court reconvened.

Chapter XII

THEORIES, FACTS AND FIGURES

GEORGE FRISBEE, although he
did not go with the others to the
mill, was too preoccupied to think
of luncheon. But apparently the coroner,
the jurors and others concerned in the in-
vestigation, had found time not only to
visit the scene of the crime, but also to
eat a hearty noonday meal.

  When the coroner tapped for order at
about two-thirty, for the benefit of the
record, Mr. Hendricks, the county sur-
veyor, who, it seemed, had attended the
examination at the mill, made a diagram of
it and a profile sketch of the interior of
the mine. He based the latter upon his
own acquaintance with the property and
upon a blue-print of the Golconda mine
prepared by Dubonnet several years pre-
viously.

  “I remember something of the early his-
tory of the Golconda,” said he. “John
Frisbee sank the shaft and located a small
but rich vein within thirty feet of the sur-
face. He dropped the shaft a few feet
below it and ran a short cross-cut to the
vein, which seemed to have a dip to the
west and a strike almost north and south.”

  One of the jurors, a tenderfoot named
Hazelton, who had recently come from the
East to regain his health in the mountains,
and who had then tied his own decaying
fortunes to those of the little town by in-
vesting his savings in a Jamestown store,
caused a smile at this point by requesting
information.

  “Mr. Hendricks,” said he, ‘I wish you’d
explain the terms ‘dip’ and ‘strike.’ ”

  “Certainly,” replied the witness, adding
as a friendly rebuke to the others, “The
language of mines seems simple enough to
those who have grown up among them, but
it is not familiar to other people. Mr.
Hazelton could get most of us balled up, I
guess, if he should talk in Iowa farming
terms.

  “It’s like this. Just suppose that your
vein, sometimes called a lode, is a sheet
of paper. Of course the edges are ir-
regular, and it’s full of holes, and in some
parts it is thin while in other parts it is
thick. But although it is called a vein, it
is a mistake to think of it as a tube, like the
veins in your body. A vein of mineral is
conceived of as a sheet between walls of
rock in the earth—a sheet lying on a slant.
The sheet is generally bent and twisted.
Take this sheet of paper, now.”

  He held it, sloping, before him, to illus-
trate.

  “The top edge of this sheet is its apex,
the apex of the vein. That is to say, the
apex is not the high point but the high
edge. The direction of that edge is the
‘course,’ or ‘strike/ of the vein, and the
slope of the sheet is what we call its ‘dip.’
You get at the vein by cutting down to it
or across to it. If you cut across to it by
a tunnel you follow it up on its dip, and
sideways along its course, by excavations
in the rock. We call those excavations
’stopes.’ Is that clear now, Mr. Hazel-
ton ?”

  “That’s fine, thanks. These chaps have
made my head swim with their talk about
‘stopes’ and ‘shafts’ and ‘winzes’ and it’s
all been Greek to me.”

  “It’s easy enough when you know it.
The shaft, of course, is the vertical hole in
the mine, a sort of well. A winze is a ver-
tical excavation made in a tunnel, as for
instance, to get at ore below the tunnel.
You have to do that sometimes, but the
best mining practice is to carry the stopes
upward.”

  “All right now, Mr. Hendricks,” said
the coroner a little impatiently. “If you’re
through with this lecture on general min-
ing practice, suppose you go ahead and tell

10
THE GHOST OF THE GOLCONDA

81

us about this particular mine.”

  “I was about to do so,” replied the sur-
veyor calmly. “Frisbee ran a tunnel west
from the shaft a hundred feet below the
surface and hit the vein again a hundred
feet from the shaft. You can see from the
old blue-print showing these workings, that
the vein had a dip of about forty-five de-
grees. It showed up a little thicker there,
but the greater values seemed to be below,'
as Frisbe demonstrated by a winze which
he sank in his tunnel at the hundred foot
level.

  “So he dropped down with his shaft an-
other hundred feet, and this time, tunneling
west again, he struck the vein, still not
very thick, a hundred and fifty feet from
the shaft.

  “That is to say, the dip had become
steeper. The vein was not far from ver-
tical at that point.

  “It was about that time, I believe, that
Frisbee’s interest went to Packer. Du-
bonnet took over the management. I re-
member Dubonnet thought that Frisbee’s
vein didn’t promise very much at that
depth, but he was confident that it would
show heavy values lower down. That is
rather characteristic of the lodes in this
section. And of course there was always
the chance of cutting another vein. So
Dubonnet dropped the shaft to seven hun-
dred feet and then he tunneled west again.
If the vein had continued to dip at the
same angle, or if it had maintained its ten-
dency to drop toward the vertical Dubon-
net would have cut it pretty near the shaft,
or at least within four or five hundred feet.
But he had to run a lot further than that.
I know that Mr. Packer thought the vein
had pinched out entirely. As you might
say, Mr. Hazelton, Packer thought they
must be below the bottom edge of the
sheet.”

  He held his simple model up again for
illustration.

  “Packer was in favor of starting a tun-
nel higher up. But they finally struck the
vein twelve hundred feet from the shaft.
You see, somewhere between the two hun-
dred foot level and the seven hundred foot
level the vein had flattened out till it was
only about thirty degrees from horizontal.
Well, it was good, rich stuff when they did
find it. Dubonnet stoped upward from
the seven hundred foot level for perhaps
two hundred feet, taking out good values.
Then he started to follow it down below
the seven hundred foot level. But you
see, from there down, he was pretty near
the side of the mountain, and so, to avoid
10

the necessity of winzes and underhand
stoping, and also the necessity of running
all his rock to the shaft and hoisting it to
the top, he simply ran a short tunnel from
the outside, about a hundred feet lower, in
the direction of the shaft.

  “That made it mighty easy to work the
mine, especially so because the short tun-
nel was run right from the county road.
He didn’t have to run that tunnel more
than thirty feet before he struck the vein.
Its further dip would carry it below the
road and below the creek, if it didn’t pinch
out. However, it was pretty thin at the
lower tunnel level. Dubonnet simply
stoped up from there, taking out the ore
till he hit the place where he had been
working in the seven hundred foot level.

  “Well, there seemed to be an unlimited
supply of ore above. They assumed that
it went clear up to where Frisbee had left
off, and it was rich, free-milling stuff, so
Dubonnet thought he’d save expense by
putting up a little ten-stamp mill. And he
had an ingenious scheme for running his
ore into it. He didn’t have to hoist it out
of the mine and then tram it down to the
mill. He simply
made a chute from
the mill itself up in-
side the mine to the
seven hundred foot
level, following in a
general way the hole
that he’d made when
he had stoped out
the ground between
it and the lower tunnel. Of course he had
to enlarge that hole in some places. The
chute must have been about two hundred
and fifty feet long. He’d simply drop his
ore into it at the seven hundred foot level.
He had some contrivance of heavy gates,
swung from the top, inside, to keep the
rock from coming too fast and wrecking
his mill. I remember he had to experi-
ment a little with those gates, but he finally
got them so the ore would feed in, nice and
easy, to the upper floor of the mill, which
he used for a crushing room. The chute
is still there. You’ve seen where the low-
er end of it runs into the mill. But the
machinery is all gone from the mill, and
even the upper floor has been taken out.
It was made of very heavy timber, and I
believe Dubonnet used it all up in the mine,
since the mill stopped running. Timber
is rather expensive up here nowadays, you
know, because there are no more sawmills
left in the mountains.

  “When the mill was running, Dubonnet
82

SHORT STORIES

sifted his ore right in the mine. It was
very simple. All he had to do was to put
a grizzly in the bottom of his chute and
let the siftings come through a funnel-
shaped arrangement below, that carried the
finer stuff right down into cars on the short
tracks in his lower tunnel.”

  “Excuse me,” said Hazelton again.
“What do you mean by a grizzly ?”

  “Oh, that’s just a set of bars that you
run the ore over, in order to sift it. Of
course Dubonnet had to hoist the sifted
stuff into his mill, but it wasn’t much of a
hoist.

  “The country rock he would let run
down into the lower tunnel, and then he
hauled it out and ran it alongside the road
to convenient places where he dumped it
into the creek. He used the creek for
nearly half a mile, up and down, but he
rip-rapped the outside of his dump so as
to make a pretty good retaining wall all the
way along the east bank. It really im-
proved the channel and protected the road.
That cost him something in labor, but he
wasn’t pinched for money in those days
and he and Packer were always public-
spirited men.

  “He had ore-bins down below his
crusher floor and he would feed his stamps
from them, but they’ve all been pulled out
now. The poor old boy didn’t have any-
thing but bookcases in there, these last few
years, and aside from those the place has
been about as empty as a barn. I guess
you’d say it looked emptier still, stretch-
ing way up in the dark, with the upper
floor out.

  “Well, I don’t know how far Dubonnet
followed the vein up above the seven hun-
dred foot level. I do know that it finally
tapered down so thin that the expenses
ate up the property. The mine got deeply
in debt and Dubonnet had hard work to
save it. For the last few years we’ve won-
dered how he managed to live, and poor
Miss Packer has had to teach school.

  “However, it looks now as if he’d found
at least a little pocket of high-grade stuff
lately. Nobody knows where, or how
much of it there is.”

  Mr. Hendricks then sketched the in-
terior of the mill, showing its relation to
the surrounding ground.

  In front of the mill the road, which ne-
cessarily followed the creek from James
town, had barely room to pass between it
and the building, as the space north of the
steps was not more than fifteen feet wide.
The mill consisted of one large room,
forty by sixty feet. In the north end of

it, in the middle, Dubonnet had construct-
ed a fireplace. It was connected simply
to an ordinary iron stove-pipe* outside, but
inside the building it had a fairly wide
flue. However, the flue was not large
enough to hold a man. He had measured
the flue. It was eight inches wide by
twelve inches long. There was also an
opening in the concrete floor at the back,
for ashes, and doubtless intended also to
improve the draft, but this opening was
smaller, only eight inches by eight.

  Dubonnet ate, slept and lived in this
large room. There was a line of very
heavy studding through the middle of it,
but these posts, connecting with the enor-
mous logs which had served in former
years to support the crushing room floor,
were evidently intended to sustain those
logs and that floor and had never served

to divide the mill into two rooms. At the
north end of the room these pillars were
missing. They had doubtless been pulled
out, Mr. Hendrickson explained, for use
in the mine. The same reason probably
accounted for the absence of one or two
of the great rafters, which were the size
and length of telegraph poles. And in
spite of the width of the room probably
none of these rafters needed the support of
the central stulls, now that the weight and
vibration of the machinery were gone. If
Dubonnet had lived there much longer he
would probably have used up all the in-
sides of the old place.

  His cook-stove and a small kitchen table
were in the south end of the room. His
cot-bed was on the east side, near the north
end, and under the old ore-chute. The

                                                      10
THE GHOST OF THE GOLCONDA

83

end of this chute projected seven feet into
the room, at a height at least sixteen feet
from the present floor. The chute itself
was approximately six feet square, and it
entered the room on a slope of about forty-
five degrees,through the eastwall. Its lower
end was about four feet above the rafter
log which had originally supported the
crushing room floor. The end of the chute
was provided with a door which swung
from the top. The door was secured by a
padlock through a hasp at the bottom. Mr.
Hendricks explained that this door, which
would have been of no use or effect to
stop the fall of ore when the mill had
been in operation, had probably been put
in by Dubonnet to prevent the entrance of
sneak-thieves into the mill from the mine.

  Not only was the padlock fastened, but
the door had recently been nailed securely
in place. Recently, the witness repeated,
because the nail-heads were bright and the
wood about them showed fresh hammer
dents.

  Frisbee wondered if this could account
for the sound of hammering which he had
heard after his departure from the mill.

  Against the walls extending from the
fireplace Dubonnet had made bookshelves,
and these were full of books. Mr. Hen-
dricks said that he and the coroner had
taken out all the books and examined the
space behind them, and the walls. There
was not room there for the concealment of
a man, and the walls appeared to be solid.

  At this point in the county surveyor's
testimony one of the jurors asked that
Hawkins be recalled to say whether he had
looked behind the books.

  “No, not behind the books,” replied the
night-marshal, “but I looked everywhere
else, in and under the cot, under the library
table and under and behind the kitchen ta-
ble and the stove, though there wasn’t
room for a man there.

  “Yes, and I climbed up on rthe rafter
that was under the ore-chute and-”

  “How did you get up there ?” asked the
juror, quickly.

  “How did I get up there ? Why, I used
Gass Dubonnet’s ladder. There was a lad-
der, about twelve feet long, I guess, lying
against the east wall. I looked on top of
all the rafters and on top of the ore-chute.
There would possibly be room for a man
up there, but he couldn’t be up there with-
out my seeing him and he couldn’t have
got into the chute from the top because
it was boarded over. Anyway, a man
couldn’t get up there without something
to stand on. The ladder, as I say, was on
10

the floor against the wall, and the table,
with Gass Dubonnet lying on the east end
of it wasn’t directly under the rafter, or
near enough to jump to the rafter from the
top of it. Would you think so, Mr. Hen-
dricks ?”

  “It would certainly take a very athletic
man to get onto the rafter from the ta-
ble,” responded the surveyor. “I don’t
believe it could be done. I measured some
of those distances, with the same thought
in mind. The table is two feet and six
inches high. It is three feet wide and a
little more than five feet long. It was al-
most squarely in front of the fireplace,
parallel with the north wall. But the
north side of it was six feet from a point
below the center of the rafter. The top
of the rafter was ten feet from the floor,
that is, seven and a half feet higher than
the top of the table. A man would have
had to make a standing jump that would
enable him to grasp a log a foot and a half
or two feet higher than his head at a dis-
tance of six feet fyom where he stood.
No, gentlemen, as the table stood, it seems
to me it would have been impossible for a
man to get from it onto the rafter that
was under the ore-chute.”

  "Mr. Hawkins,” persisted the juror,
“how long was it after you heard the shot
before you got into the room?”

  “We—ell, I should think it was all of
ten minutes.”

  “Gentlemen,” said the surveyor, "you
saw the situation yourselves. Even if the
table had been under the rafter log it
would have been very difficult for a man
to get onto the rafter from the table. The
rafter would have been a couple of feet
higher than his head, and he would have
to have tremendous strength in his hands
to grip that rounded surface after he had
jumped to it, and then to swing himself up
onto it.” .

  “And, Anyway, Mr. Slade,” contributed
the night-marshal, “the table couldn’t have

been moved. I’d
have heard it.”
“You’d have
heard it, while
you were break-
in the front door
with an iron
bar?” persisted
the inquisitive ju-
Tor, disregarding
the coroner’s
’frown. “I ain’t sure about that.”

  “You forget I looked in at the south
window before I broke in. And when I
84

SHORT STORIES

looked in, the table was where it is now,
an’ Gass Dubonnet was lyin’ on the end of
it.”

  “Uh-huh,” continued his cross-examin-
er, “an’ how long was it before you looked
in? How long was it that you was shiv-
erin’ outside the wall waitin’ for a ghost ?”
“We-ell, I—really, I dunno. Five min-
utes, mebbe. But I’d ’a’ heard a mouse
if one had moved across the floor then, and
believe me, gentlemen, there wasn’t no
sound at all inside that room while I was
listenin’.”

  “Just a minute more, Mr. Coroner,” per-
sisted the juror. “Let me ask you this,
Mr. Hawkins. Could you have heard a
mouse, or a man, while you was wrestlin’
with that ore-car to get it up to the south
window, so’s you could look in ?”

  “I’m pretty sure I could. I didn’t make
much noise. Really, I was kind of scared
to make much noise. I believe I’d ’a’
heard any noise even then. But now let
me ask you a question, you’re so awful
smart. Suppose while I was movin’ that
ore-car—it didn’t take me very long—a
man had moved the table under the rafter
and stood on it and jumped to the rafter,
and then climbed to the top of the chute
—he’d certainly have to be some gymnast
to do any part of that stunt—an’ perhaps
got into the chute—God knows how—then,
this is what I’m askin’ you, how could that
man have put Gass Dubonnet’s body back
on the table and moved the table back six
feet to the rear of the rafter?”

  The amateur sleuth on the jury subsided
in the general snicker which immediately
enlivened the grim proceedings.

 The coroner rapped for order. “I
think there’s been quite enough of this in-
formal discussion,” he announced. “Go
ahead, Mr. Hendricks, and give us any
other information which you have pre-
pared.”

Chapter XIII

FINGER-NAIL MARKS?

MR. HENDRICKS gave the jury
some further figures. The sill of
the north window on the west
side was seven feet from the ground, and
the slope to the south end of the mill made
the height of the other windows greater,
the one on the south end being a little more
than nine feet above the ground at that
point. The tunnel door was below, but a
little to the right, or east, of that window,
and it, like the chute in the mill-room, had
recently been nailed tight.

  On a question by the inquiring juror,
who was endeavoring to re-establish his
reputation as an acute observer, the county
surveyor confirmed Hawkins’ statement
about the small porthole at the bottom of
the tunnel door. It was the width of one
board, that is to say, about eleven inches,
and it was not quite seven inches high, the
end of the board being cut somewhat on a
bias. A man could not possibly get
through this opening. The trap door in
the mill floor, evidently used in times past
to hoist ore from tunnel cars in the base-
ment of the mill and, more recently, as a
means of descent from the mill into the
basement and thence into the tunnel, was
firmly locked from above. The key to
this lock, like the key to the chute, was on
the ring which Dubonnet customarily car-
ried and which Mr. Slade had taken from
his pocket. This door, when locked, could
not be moved more than half an inch. Mr.
Slade had opened this trap door and, with
Hendricks and several of the jurors, had
descended into the space below the mill
floor.

  Frisbee happened to glance at Duna-
way during this part of Hendricks’ story,
and saw that gentleman watching Slade
very keenly. Dunaway whispered some-
thing to Griswold, and the latter addressed
the district attorney. “May I ask a ques-
tion, Mr. Kenehan?”

  “Certainly,” replied the district attor-
ney, with an access of his new-found con-
sideration.

  “What I wanted to ask, Mr. Hendricks,
was whether Mr. Slade went ahead of you
into the tunnel?”

  “Why, yes, naturally. He put the lad-
der down into the basement and climbed
down ahead of us and walked back and
forth for a few seconds. Then he turned
his flashlight so that we could see to get
down.”

  Frisbee thought he saw the shadow of a
smile behind Dunaway’s unkempt beard.
“The old chap certainly has some theory of
this case,” he thought. “Wonder what it is.”
“Well, below the mill, the tunnel wasn’t
actually cut out of the rock, was it?”

  “Oh, no, of course not. The mill had
simply been built on pilings a few feet
above the ground, and under the mill the
tunnel wasn’t really a tunnel at all, but a
cellar, except where it curved into the
mountain almost under the east wall of
the mill. However, the cellar was very
small, because practically all the space had
been filled up, clear to the floor of the
mill, with loose rock hauled out of the

                                                        10

mine. It was a narrow passageway for
perhaps thirty feet from the south door,

and t h e n it
widened into a
triangu-
lar space under
the northeast
corner of the
mill. There
was room for
the tracks,
leading to the
tunnel, proper,
and there was
room left to
get under the fireplace on the north end,
so as to remove ashes. There was some
empty space in the north end, but most of
the basement was filled up tight with rock
from the mine. It was easier, of course,
for the old man to dump his cars there than
it was to trundle them by hand down
alongside the creek.”

 “Was—may I go on, Mr. Kenehan?”
asked Griswold. “Thank you. Weren’t
there plenty of places where a man could
hide among those boulders?”

  “No; I think not. They were piled up
pretty even, so as to prevent falling, and
they had the effect of a walling in of the
passage and of that triangular space. We
didn’t see any place where it looked as if
a man could be concealed in that cellar.
Of course the tunnel ran back a little way
into the mountain. We followed it in,
but we didn’t try to climb the stope above
it.”

  “Did Mr. Slade go ahead of you into
the mine, by the tunnel ?”

  “Sure. He had the only flashlight.”
Dunaway was leaning forward, greatly
interested.

  “Did you see any depression in the
ground, the floor, of the tunnel?” he in-
quired.

  “Wait a minute,” said Slade, rapping
with his gavel. “We can’t allow this. If
the district attorney -wants to permit one
of you gentlemen to ask a few questions,
that’s all right, but I’m not going to have
all of you butting in, haphazard, trying to
develop theories of your own. Please
proceed in the regular way, Mr. Kenehan,
or we’ll dismiss this witness.”

  “Well, never mind that question, any-
way,” said Dunaway, unabashed. “I’ll
suggest one to the district attorney, if I
may.”

  He did so, and the district attorney
asked, “Mr. Hendricks, do you know
whether that tunnel was ever used for
10

any other purpose than as a passageway
for ore and rock from the mine and as an
entrance to the stope above it ?”

  “Why—er—I don’t know from personal
observation, but as an engineer I know that
it must have served another purpose.”
“Exactly. What purpose, please?”
“Why, as a drain, of course. There’s
more or less water in all these mines up
here, as you know, Mr. Kenehan.”

  “Well, that’s just what I was getting at.
Now, did you see, in this tunnel, any sign
that it was used as a drain. Was there
water flowing in it, or was there a water
channel ?”

  The witness had not thought of it be-
fore. He was frankly puzzled. He seemed
to think that his failure to observe some-
thing of the sort was a reflection upon his
professional keenness. He finally stated
that he had noticed a little water trickling
down the stope, but had not noticed where
it ran out of the tunnel. In order, per-
haps, to cover his own confusion, he re-
marked, “Of course you know there have
been a good many deep tunnels cut in this
district since the Golconda was opened up.
They’ve drained the country to a consid-
erable extent. And for that reason there’s
not nearly as much water in many of the
older mines as there used to be.”

  Dunaway was scratching his head re-
flectively, as if he was trying to remember
something. Mr. Slade again took a hand.

  “I don’t see, Mr. Kenehan, what is the
purpose of going into all this. It cannot
have anything at all to do with the case.
It makes no difference what the tunnel or
the cellar was like. Gaspard Dubonnet
could not possibly have been shot by a man
hiding there, even if there were any evi-
dence that anybody had been there. It is
as clear as can be that he was shot by some-
body in the room, or by somebody through
the window. It is also perfectly clear that
after he had been shot nobody could have
got into that tunnel.”

  “Oh, very well,” said Kenehan rather
testily. “It’s the coroner’s business to de-
termine the manner of this man’s death—
if he can. I’m willing to drop this line
of inquiry for the present. Mr. Hen-
dricks, tell us about those windows, if you
please.”

  “Well, as has been already stated here,
they were all permanently fastened, that
is, nailed, except the north window on the
west side. They had been nailed from
the inside, and they had evidently been
fastened that way for a long time. The
north window on the west side had no
86

SHORT STORIES

weights—I don’t believe any of them had,
for that matter. To keep the window
open, you would have to prop it open. But
when it dropped down, it would fasten
automatically, because there was a little
spring catch on each side. When I ex-
amined the window those catches were
both fastened.”

  “Same as when I saw it, right after Gass
Dubonnet was shot,” ejaculated Hawkins
from his seat. “But not the same as when
I saw it the minute before that.”

  “That will do, Hawkins!” snapped the
coroner.

  Mr. Hendricks’ further testimony re-
lated to the topography of the country out-
side. The creek

bed,	proper, was
about thirty feet
wide at that
point, and its
bottom was very
rocky. It was
not frozen over,
though there
was ice in the
pools. The wa-
ter was a little
above average height right now, and, op-
posite the mill, was perhaps eight or ten
feet below the road.

  The near bank was the practically ver-
tical rip-rap wall. The far bank rose
rather smoothly for about a hundred yards*
in which distance the total ascent was
about seventy-five feet, which would bring
it above the top of the mill.

  There was absolutely no track of a man
or an animal in the snow on that opposite
slope. The witness—at the suggestion of
Judge Dunaway, it appeared—had exam-
ined it most carefully. And between the
creek and the mill there was no sign of a
track on the top of the snow at any point
as far north as the south edge of the
north window. The most northerly marks
were the front hoof-marks of a horse just
south of that point. There was some dis-
turbance in the snow, there, which the wit-
ness thought was sufficiently explained by
Mr. Hawkins’ testimony.

  Also, there were some depressions in
the snow under the north window, made
before the snow had stopped falling, and
hence not readily distinguishable.

  “Those were my tracks,” volunteered
George Frisbee.

  “Your turn will come directly,” said the
coroner, sarcastically.

  As for the stream itself, it would hardly
show tracks. But there was no disturb-

ance of the snow on either bank, or on the
rocks in the stream, such as would be made
by a man or an animal walking in it. The
rip-rap was a smooth snowy wall, not only
at this point but as far north and south as
he could see from the mill.

  “Anything else of interest that you can
tell us, Mr. Hendricks, either about the
mill or the ground near it,” inquired the
coroner, apparently relieved, though not
satisfied.

  “No-o; I believe not. I did notice one
little thing in the mill that I couldn’t un-
derstand. It probably has no significance.
There were two little fresh cuts or gouges
on the top of the window sill, inside. They
were not much more than short, deep
scratches, about an inch long, I should
think, and an eighth of an inch deep. They
were about four inches apart and they were
just inside the window. I only noticed
them because they seemed to be new.”

  Again that queer suggestion of a smile,
behind Judge Dunaway’s beard.

  Hawkins suddenly ejaculated, trembling
with excitement, “My God! They musta
been the marks of the ghost’s fingernails
when he was bracin’ himself for a shot!”

  Even Slade laughed. Dunaway alone
looked thoughtfully at the marshal. “Some-
thing like that,” he murmured, as if to
himself.

Chapter XIV

A THEORY OF MOTIVES

GEORGE FRISBEE, later in the
afternoon, told simply and in con-
cise language the story of his visit
to Dubonnet. He remembered that when
he had got back to the hotel it was five
minutes before eleven. It had taken him
perhaps three quarters of an hour to walk
down from the mill in the snow. It had
stopped snowing a few minutes before he
reached the hotel.

  He made no effort to conceal any fact
which might have a bearing on the tragedy.

  He was asked if he had felt any enmity
toward Dubonnet? Well, he must admit
that he had entertained such a sentiment.
It had been difficult to overcome it. But
he had offended Miss Packer by displaying
it, earlier in the evening, and after that he
had endeavored to suppress his own feel-
ings.

  Did Dubonnet display an animosity
toward him? No; Mr. Dubonnet had re-
ceived him very courteously, had not mani-
fested any enmity or dislike, and had shak-
en hands with him. He said nothing about

                                                     01
THE GHOST OF THE GOLCONDA

87

Dubonnett’s initial refusal to do so, deem-
ing this matter of hallucination not ma-
terial to the inquiry.

  The jury went out to consider their
verdict. Dunaway, Griswold and Fris-
bee went to the latter’s room in the hotel.
There, Dunaway closed the transom and
looked carefully down the hall, then locked
the door and hung his overcoat over the
knob.

  “Let’s be brief, here,” said Frisbee. “I
want to go over and inquire about Miriam
Packer.”

  “Of course you do,” said Dunaway,
smiling seriously, “but there are some
things to be considered first. Let’s re-
view this case a little, and kind of think
out loud—but not so very loud. You have
some enemies in this town. I don’t mean
Kenehan. I think he would really like to
be decent, but he’s never learned how, and
he was put up to fix this on you, George.

   “Now, as a starting point of our inquiry,
let’s consider who would be interested to
kill Gass Dubonnet. You have a possible
motive, revenge for the killing of your
father. Would anybody else have a mo-
tive? What’s the usual motive for the

crime of mur-
der, outside

o	f revenge —
which isn’t very
common. Well,
it’s usually ei-
ther jealousy or
cupidity. What
about jealousy?
It seems a little
far-fetched tp
imagine that
anyone could be jealous of the attentions
of an elderly man to a young woman, but
stranger things have happened. Gass Du-
bonnet was only about sixty, and he was a
pretty fine figure of a man, mentally and
physically, though lately he’s seemed to
me to be rather losing his strength. If it
was possible for anybody to have that
motive, there are two men who might have
it. One of ’em’s yourself.”

  “But—” began Frisbee rather angrily.

  “Now don’t fly off the handle, George.
I believe you’re as innocent as I am. I’m
just suggesting how other people might
look at this. It’s the other people’s point
of view that we’ve got to consider now.”

  “Who’s the other person?” asked Fris-
bee.

  “Why, her cousin, Henry Packer, of
course. He’s been a frequent visitor at
her house.

    10

  “Now, then, there were two crimes com-
mitted last night within several hours of
each other. The man who was shot—”
he paused and changed the form of ex-
pression, to the mystification of his audit-
ors—“the man who is dead was a frequent
visitor to the woman who was shot. He
visited her in fact on that very evening
only a few minutes before she was shot
and only several hours before he was—
before his own death.”

  Frisbee and Griswold looked at each
other, frankly puzzled by Dunaway’s odd
choice of words.

  “Now,” continued the old lawyer, “ev-
ery police officer, every criminal lawyer,
every judge, knows that it’s a very com-
mon thing indeed for a jealous suitor to
kill both his favored rival and the woman
who has disappointed him. If jealousy
was the motive it couldn’t have inspired
Frisbee to commit both crimes because at
least it is clear that he did not commit the
first. He was at the hotel in conversation
with Doctor Martin when the shot was
fired in the first crime.

  “Could the other suitor—if you can call
either of them a suitor—have committed
both crimes ? Well, he might possibly have
committed the first. He might have com-
mitted the second if anybody, any assas-
sin, committed it. Of course we are up
against the difficulty of finding out how
any assassin could have done it.

  “Now, personally—of course I may be
wrong, I don’t believe that Henry Packer
was enough in love with his cousin to be
goaded to murder on account of her re-
jection of him. And we don’t know
whether she ever rejected him, or had oc-
casion to. Henry is rather a vindictive
sort of a chap, but I don’t believe that
Dubonnet’s attentions were of the sort to
inspire jealousy.

  “But if it wasn’t jealousy, was there any
other motive and is there any other person
who would be affected by it? The usual
motive is cupidity.

  “A very interesting thing was developed
at the inquest which surprised me and
which I know surprised lots of other peo-
ple, though it wasn’t emphasized to any
great extent. Kenehan apparently didn’t
think it was important. I know from
Slade’s expression that he did think it was
important, but for some reason he didn’t
choose to dwell on it or inquire into it at
length. That interesting thing was that
Gass Dubonnet had before him a pile of
gold nuggets, raw gold, practically pure,
probably worth several thousand dollars.
88

SHORT STORIES

You saw them when you looked in at the
window. Hawkins saw them. They were
there when the doctor came. It would
seem that Dubonnet wasn’t killed by some-
body trying to rob him of that gold, or at
least any such robber was unable to com-
plete the intended robbery.

  “The coroner took possession of those
nuggets. I’d rather see them in the hands
of a more honest man. I don’t trust Mr.
Slade.

  “But the significance of their presence
is that Dubonnet must have actually found
an ore body in the mine where we sup-
posed there had been nothing to speak of
—certainly no high-grade—discovered in
the last fifteen years. If that is correct it
probably means that Dubonnet had taken
out more of the same kind. That explains
to me his frequent trips to Denver with a
heavy grip. He could carry several thou-
sand dollars’ worth of such stuff in an
ordinary satchel. A good deal of it he
could take right to the mint. As for the
rest, any assayer could separate a few
thousand dollars’ worth for him. That
kind of gold is almost pure. It wouldn’t
have to be milled or smelted. It was al-
most as negotiable as cash.

  “And if there’s any of that stuff in the
mine there ought to be a lot of the next
grade, high-grade milling ore. In other
words, the mine is valuable, probably im-
mensely valuable. Now in that case who
would benefit by Dubonnet’s death?”

  “Of course, if the person who would
benefit didn’t know he would benefit, then
it would provide no motive to him. But
oddly enough—and I believe that I’m the
only living person who knows it so far, ex-
cept Miriam Packer—the only person in
the world who would benefit at this time
by both Dubonnet’s death and Miriam
Packer’s death is-”

  “Her cousin!” exclaimed Frisbee.

  “No indeed—yourself.”

Chapter XV

A LEGAL DISCUSSION

  AT THIS remarkable statement the
two young men looked at Dunaway
Z A and then at each other as if they
doubted the reality of their own existence.
Frisbee spoke first, endeavoring to wake
himself from this queer dream.

  “You say I am the only one who could
derive a benefit from the death of both of
these people, and yet you believe I am in-
nocent ?”

  “Well,” said Dunaway judicially, “I’ll

put it this way. You are the only person
who could derive a permanent benefit from
Miriam Packer’s death—at this time. And
you are the only person who could de-
rive a permanent benefit from Dubonnet’s
death as it has already occurred. It’s pos-
sible that some one else, most any evil-
disposed person, might derive a temporary
advantage by having him out of the way.
But you couldn’t have known that you
could get either that permanent benefit or
that temporary advantage.”

  “Well, George,” said Griswold, “this
case has more mysteries in it than anything
I’ve run against in my experience as a law-
yer.

  “Yes, and more dangers, I’m afraid,”
replied George. Judge, or heaven’s sake,
explain.”

  “That’s what I got you here for. It’s
a matter of the title of the Golconda Mine.
Give me your professional attention for a
few minutes. What became of that title
depended partly on which died first, Miri-
am Packer or Gaspard Dubonnet. If Du-
bonnet died first, all the property would
belong to Miriam Packer for her to dis-
pose of as she saw fit. If she died first,
half of the property, her half, would go to
her natural heirs, and then, when Dubon-
net should die, the other half, his half,
would also go to her heirs.”

  “Her heirs? Who were they, and how
would they get Dubonnet’s half ?”

  “She has only one, now, her cousin,
Henry Packer. You see, it’s this way.
Old man Packer wanted to provide both
for his daughter and
for his engineer and
manager, Dubonnet.
His will left the
Golconda mine to
them by undivided
half interests during
the period of their
joint lives, “with-
out impeachment of
waste,” to use the expression of the old
law-books that you boys are familiar with.
They could mine and sell all the ore there
was in the Golconda if they could find it
and get it out—until today I wouldn’t have
thought that was a very valuable right—
but while both of them were alive they
couldn’t sell the mine itself, and neither of
them could dispose of his or her half in-
terest.

  “That isn’t quite a correct statement of
it either, because Miriam was allowed to
dispose of her half interest after she should
become twenty-six years old, whether Du-

                                                       10
THE GHOST OF THE GOLCONDA

89

bonnet was still alive or not. In other
words her life interest in the half would
become a clear title in fee when either of
two things should happen; first, when Du-
bonnet should die, no matter how old she
should be then; second, when she should
become twenty-six years old, even if Du-
bonnet should still be alive.”

  “Why twenty-six?” inquired Griswold.
“Well, old man Packer didn’t have a
very high opinion of the business judgment
of women. He often said that if a man
could dispose of his property at twenty-
one a woman ought to be at least five years
older than that before she should be al-
lowed to do it.”

  “This is rather curious,” said Frisbee.
Miriam must be close to twenty-six right
now.”

  “Very close indeed,” said Dunaway,
smiling. “Today happens to be her
twenty-sixth birthday.

  The young men both whistled softly.
“Remarkable coincidence,” said Gris-
wold.

  “Not exactly coincidence. Coincidence
implies chance. I don’t think it was chance
that caused her to be shot the evening be-
fore her birthday. It fits too closely with
somebody’s financial interests. If she had
been killed last night instead of being only
wounded, her title to the mine would have
descended to her natural heirs—heir. Not
only that, but Dubonnet’s title would go to
the same person when he should die. You
see, his life interest was only a half in-
terest in any event, even if he should sur-
vive Miriam.

  “Packer wanted him to have the income
from half the property during his life, but
it was all to go to Miriam or her heirs
finally. Of course he naturally expected
that she would marry and that her heirs
would be her husband and children.”
“Well,” said Frisbee, “it sounds fright-
fully cold-blooded—of course any murder
is cold-blooded—but this seems pretty
nearly to convict Henry Packer of both
crimes. He would gain by having Miriam
Packer die before she was twenty-six be-
cause her property would go to him-”

  “And Dubonnet’s half, too, as soon as
he should die,” interposed his partner.

  “Exactly. Whereas if she should live
until today she could deed her part away

  “And Dubonnet’s part, too, after his
death,” interrupted Griswold again.

  “Precisely. Or she could dispose of it
by will so as to cut out her natural heirs.”
10

  Dunaway was smiling quizzically at
them.

    “You’re a discerning lawyer, George,”
he remarked.

  “I don’t know whether that is sarcasm or
not,” replied Frisbee, “because, for the life
of me I can’t see how all this affects me at
all. She certainly hasn’t sold the property
to me. Probably she hasn’t the physical
ability to make a deed today, even if she
has the legal right to do so.”

  “And if she’d made the deed yesterday,
do you say it wouldn’t convey anything be-
cause she then didn’t have any title which
she could convey?” said Griswold.

  “We-11,” responded Frisbee, “I suppose
it could operate as a covenant to convey
such title as she might acquire later.”

  “Yes—if there was a consideration for
it,” said Griswold argumentatively. “You
haven’t been buying mines from a lady in-
stead of playing politics here, have you,
George ?”

  “Boys,” said Dunaway, “you’re getting
into ratber fine legal distinctions. This
case is simpler than that. I’m quite sure
she didn’t make any deed. I certainly
should have advised her against it. But
she didn’t need to do that in order to ac-
complish her purpose. Now we’ll continue
this bar examination a minute or so while
you bright young city lawyers tell me how
else she could dispose of her property.”
“By will, of course,” said Frisbee.
“Effective, when?”

  “Why, at her death, certainly.”

  “Go to the head of the class. So it
wouldn’t matter when she made her will,
what kind of a title she had then, or, in-
deed, whether she had any title at all. The
will would pass whatever title she might
have at the moment of her death.”

  “This is elementary stuff, professor,”
said George, “but I don’t see how it affects
me.”

  “Of course you don’t, because there’s
one important fact that you don’t yet know.
Unless they told somebody, there were only
two persons beside myself who did know
that important fact. One of those two
persons is dead, and the other one is
wounded and may die. Those two are
Gaspard Dubonnet and Miriam Packer.

  “Now, strictly speaking, I have no right
to tell you this, but from something Miri-
am Packer said to me I’m going to assume
authority to do so, because it is a link in a
chain of evidence affecting the charge
which has been made against you and
which may be made against you again.
90

SHORT STORIES

But you and Griswold must promise not to
breathe a word of it until Miriam Packer
releases us—or dies. In that event it will
become a matter of public record.”

  The two young men, leaning forward in
their chairs, eagerly promised.

  “Right after jour meeting yesterday,”
continued Dunaway, “Miriam Packer and
Gaspard Dubonnet went to my office. Du-
bonnet, in fact, went there before the close
of the meeting. He left early, as you
must remember. Miriam asked me to go
Ayith her and meet him there.

  “Dubonnet—he was something of a legal

draftsman him-
self, like most
mine managers
here in the
mountains— had
a will made out
in his own hand-
writing-”

  “His will ?**
interrupt-
ed Frisbee.

  “No, her will.
It was short and he had it all prepared for
her signature. I looked it over and I
must say the contents of it surprised me
very much, but it was all right from a legal
standpoint—and I reckon it was all right
from a moral standpoint, too, a mighty
high moral standpoint.”

  “Moral standpoint?” said Frisbee, puz-
zled.

  “Well, they both explained some things
to me, particularly Dubonnet, but I won’t
go into that now. Don’t think I’d better
assume that much authority. Miriam exe-
cuted the will herself, then and there, in
due form, with Dubonnet and myself for
witnesses. I joshed her just a little about
a document which probably wouldn't be
effective for about sixty years, and she
said she’d attend to other steps long before
that time, but she was just doing this for
the sake of—of a possible emergency.
That will’s in my safe now, and—mind
you, mum’s the word—the will devises all
her interest in the Golconda Mine to
George Frisbee, his heirs and assigns for-
ever.”

Chapter XVI

FOUND IN THE ASHES

WHILE George Frisbee was en-
deavoring to adjust himself to this
astonishing information there
came a knock at the door. Dunaway

opened it and greeted the hotel clerk.

  “I thought you gentlemen would like to
hear the coroner’s verdict,” he said. “I
just got it by telephone. I wrote it down.
There’s lots of queer things in this world,
ain’t there, Judge?”

  Dunaway took the slip of paper and
read: “We, the jury, find that Gaspard
Dubonnet came to his death at about mid-
night, on or immediately following the 17th
day of October, from a gunshot wound not
self-inflicted, but inflicted by some per-
son or agency unknown. We are in doubt
as to whether any earthly human agency
inflicted said wound, but recommend fur-
ther investigation by the district attorney
of the possible connection of George Fris-
bee with said crime.”

  “Well,” remarked Griswold, “there’s one
thing about a coroner’s jury. They have-
n’t any responsibility and they can say any-
thing they please. But you see, George,
that regardless of evidence you’re still un-
der suspicion.”

  “But,” said Frisbee, “that jury was
simply a prey to superstition. Let’s be
sensible about this. A pistol shot may be
an unnatural thing—of course it is, in a
sense—but at least it isn’t a supernatural
thing. A human hand must have fired
that shot. It couldn’t have been anything
else. Don’t you say so, Judge?”

  “I would certainly say that a human—”
the judge paused a moment, again appear-
ing to be casting about for the right word
—“a human agency fired that shot. I
agree that bullets are not fired supernatur-
ally. But I’m not going to spring any
theory about this till we clear up a few
things. Here are a few questions.

  “Where is the other pistol? He always
kept the two of them together, and George
saw them both together on his table a cou-
ple of hours before he was killed. George
didn’t have the other pistol in his posses-
sion or in his effects when he was arrested.
Could he have taken that pistol and thrown
it into the snow on the way home? Pos-
sibly, but why should George have taken
the pistol except to use it ? And he could-
n’t have fired the fatal shot because he was
here in bed in this room at the time it was
fired. The clerk saw him come in and go
upstairs to bed nearly an hour before the
time when Hawkins heard the shot. That
alone would seem to be a clear alibi for
George, unless he managed to sneak out
again and go back to the mill to commit the
murder. And that would be very far-
fetched. At least it hasn’t been suggested
yet.
THE GHOST OF THE GOLCONDA

  “Which pistol fired the fatal shot ? The
pistol in the room had just been fired when
Hawkins broke in, and, if it was not fired
by Dubonnet’s hand but by some other
hand, it might be the one which killed him.
It was near his body and in front of his
hand when it was found, but it might pos-
sibly have been thrown there by an assas-
sin—if there’s any way of accounting for
an assassin’s presence in the room or his
escape from the room.

  “But were there two shots, or only one ?
Hawkins says he heard only one, but from
his statement I’m inclined to think he heard
two, fired almost but not exactly to-
gether.

  “If there were two shots, from what
place was the other one fired ? I mean the
one not fired by the pistol which was
found. It couldn’t have been fired from
the road between the mill and the creek, or
from the ground beyond the creek, because
the ground at both places conclusively
shows that nobody was there. It couldn’t
have been fired from the bed of the creek,
because a person standing there wouldn’t
be in range. The bottom of the creek is
too low, even if the man had been on
horseback.

  “And how could anybody get out of the
room? The door was locked from the in-
side. No one could have gone out through
it without being seen by Hawkins, and even
if anybody had gone out of it there was no
one inside who could have locked the door
after him. Dubonnet, gasping out his last
breath on the table, could not have done so.
The windows, except one, were nailed shut,
and that one was fastened on the inside.
Of course if anyone had raised that win-
dow and got out it would have fastened
automatically in place behind him, but he
would have been seen by Hawkins, and,
furthermore, the ground shows that nobody
did get out that way. There were no foot-
prints in the snow except the half-filled de-
pressions made by George Frisbee two
hours before.”

  “Could somebody have shot Dubonnet
from the ore-chute?” asked Griswold.

  “That seems quite impossible, though I
will say that that ore-chute is one thing I
want to examine further. However, the
end and sides and bottom of it were board-
ed up tight. Anyway, a shot from inside
the chute or from the top of it would have
shown a downward course in Dubonnet’s
body, and from the other side.”

  “Could the shot have been fired from
the hole in the floor in the fireplace?”

    10

  “Well, that would have given the bullet
an upward course. But I don’t see how a
man could get both his head and his arm
through a hole eight by eight inches. He’d
have to have them both through in order to

aim and fire a
pistol. But
there was a
fire in that
fireplace when
Frisbee saw it
a couple of
hours before
the shot, and
also when
Hawkins saw it five or six minutes after
the shot.

  “No, I don’t see how the shot could
possibly have been fired from there, but I
do think that fireplace will bear further
consideration. I considered it a little to-
day, when we were up there, and I also
considered the space below it. It’s an ash-
heap. I poked around there for a minute,
v/hile Slade and the other fellows went a
little way up the tunnel, and I found—
this.”

  He drew from his pocket a semi-circle
of steel. The ends were bright, as if they
had been recently filed. It was a pistol
trigger-guard.

  “Now, boys,” said the judge, “I don’t
know yet what this means, but I have an
idea. There’s several other questions in
this case. There’s a question of where the
other pistol bullet went, if more than one
were fired. There’s a question of who
nailed up the cellar door, and why. There’s
a question of where is Miriam Packer’s
sole heir-at-law, her precious cousin. It’s
most remarkable that he hasn’t been
around here all day. I’m glad to say the
sheriff guarded the mill last night. He
stayed there after he went up with the doc-
tor and the coroner. Bates is a mighty
diligent officer. No doubt he will main-
tain his watch for several nights, if neces-
sary. I believe something’s going to show
up there.

  “I’ve got to go, now. I want to see how
Miriam Packer’s getting along, and then I
promised to look at Pete Hawkins’ horse.
I used to drive the stage up here when I
was a kid, and I always thought I was a
fairly good amateur veterinary surgeon.
Right now, some of the boys will tell you
that I’m more of a horse-doctor than a
lawyer, and I guess they’re right. But,
even at that, I do try to be a horse-sense
lawyer.”

Chapter XVII

A FEMALE OLD-TIMER

I WANT to go with you to Miriam’s,”
said Frisbee. “She wasn’t able to see
me this noon.”

  “All right, come along. But mind you,
not a word on her affairs.”

  “Oh no, they’re not for discussion yet, I
know,” replied George, “but I’ll be think-
ing about them a lot.”

  Miriam, however, so they were informed
by her friend and nurse, Miss Chapin, was
not yet able to see anybody. The doctor
thought she might have a visitor or two to-
morrow, if she had a good night’s rest.
However, if they would wait a moment she
would tell Miriam that they were there.
She might have some message for them.

  She did have a message. She thanked
them for coming and hoped to see them in
a day or two. Had they learned anything
of the whereabouts of Cousin Henry ?

  Dunaway stroked his chin thoughtfully.
"You tell her,” he said, “that we’ll look for
him till we find him.”

  He continued to George as they left the
house, “Henry wasn’t home last night, so
his landlady says, and I don’t see how he
could have got out of town. There hasn’t
been a freight train out since he was at her
house last night, and only one passenger
train. That was the afternoon train to-
day, the one that brought Griswold up,
when it went back on its return trip. Of
course the snow-plow came up and went
back, early this morning, but they didn’t
take him on that. The sheriff had both it
and the train watched to see who went out
of town, and he asked the engineer of the
snow-plow and the conductor of the train
to wire him the names of all passengers he
might get farther down the canyon. Those
fellows know everybody on this jerk-
water line. The wire came back a while
ago, and Henry Packer wasn’t on the list.

  “The wagon road isn’t passable either
on foot or by wheels and there’s been no
wagon or motor traffic since the storm, ex-
cept locally around town. Of course he
might possibly have walked down the track
after the snow-plow 'had been over it, but
it would have been pretty hard going at
that, and he would have been practically
sure to be seen. I believe he must still be
in town somewhere. There’s one person
that possibly might know. That’s old Mag
Love joy. We’ll just blow around to her
place, and I’ll postpone my medical visit
to Pete Hawkins’ horse.”

Mrs. Lovejoy’s place somewhat belied

her name, in its outward appearance, but
the old girl greeted them very pleasantly
and took them into a cheerful though clut-
tered and disorderly back parlor. There
was a merry little fire in the grate, there
was a bird-cage in the window, and beside
Mrs. Lovejoy’s rocking chair there was a
basket of heavy wool men’s socks. Evi-
dently she had been darning them for some
of her boarders.

  “Mag,” said the judge, “you look so do-
mestic that I can hardly believe I know
you. Meet my friend Mr. George Fris-

bee.	Mr. Frisbee, Mrs. Lovejoy.”

  “I knew your father years ago—by
sight,” said Mrs. Lovejoy.

  “By the way, George,” interrupted the
judge, “there’s that picture of Buffalo Bill

I	was telling you about.”

  There it was, indeed, and so neatly had
the bullet holes been drilled in the pupils
of the old plainsman’s eyes that at first
they appeared to be only slightly enlarged
so as to give Mr. Cody a rather surprised
expression.

  “Would you and your friend like a little
drink?” inquired
their hostess, going
to the cupboard.
“Good stuff, I can
tell you, and per-
fectly lawful. Some

I	had left since be-
fore prohibition.”

 “I was hoping
you’d say something
like that,” replied Dunaway. “But don’t
try to slip any of that before prohibition
stuff over on me. I know something
about this town—but I’m not a magistrate
now. I’m—just a sort of investigator.
In that capacity I’ll try a little sample, just
to see what its quality is.”

  “Thanks very much, none for me,” said
George, as the lady produced the bottle.
“Never learned to use it.”

  “Well,” said Mrs. Lovejoy, “even at
that I guess your family could make a
pretty good average. Oh, excuse me, I
didn’t mean to say anything unkind. Since
I’ve said it, though, I’ll say that’s the only
fault your dad had, as far as I know.”
“Mag,” said the judge, “the subject of
liquor is really what we came here to in-
quire about. We’re looking for Henry
Packer—” Mrs. Lovejoy raised her eye-
brows inquiringly— “I’ve got to talk to
him about business matters arising on ac-
count of Gass Dubonnet’s death. Know-
ing that Henry is fond of his tea, and
knowing that you generally have a little—

                                                        10

left over from before the war—and that
you occasionally accommodate a friend, it
occurred to me that Henry might possibly
have called on you in the last twenty-four
hours and that you might know where we
could find him.”

  “Hasn’t he been to see his cousin since
she was shot?”

  “No, and she’s very anxious to see him.
That’s part of the reason we’re looking
for him.”

  “Well, the young pup! So he’s never
been near her, eh? That’s funny. I’ll tell
you all I know about him, Judge. I’ve got

a little bit sore at that boy lately-”

  “Does he owe you any money?”

  “No, not now. He did, for quite a
while, but he’s paid it all. But I don’t like
his style. He’s drinking too much, for
one thing.”

  “Great Scott! That from you, Mag!”
“Well, it’s the fact, but I can’t tell you
much. He came in here last night. I
should think it was a little before nine.
He bought a bottle of whisky, same as
this.”

  “Did Henry spend any time here with
you?”

  “No. To tell the truth I didn’t want
him around. He’d been drinking some al-
ready.”

  “Did Henry have a gun with him when
he came here?”

  “Oh, my God, Judge! You don’t think
he—? Why, no—leastwise I didn’t see
any. Of course he might have had a pis-
tol in his pocket. I know he has a rifle,
because he left it with me once as security
for some booze. But he took it away
when he paid me a couple of weeks ago,
and I haven’t seen it since.”

  “Do you remember what kind of a rifle
it was?”

  “Why—I don’t know much about rifles.
It was one of those guns that they hunt
deer with. He told me it was a good one.”

  “Small cali-
ber?”

  “Well, yes, I
think so. But
I don’t know
much about it.
The boys used
to handle six-
g u n s around
the house in
the old days,
and I’ve seen
one or two shooting scrapes, but I don’t
know much about rifles or any kind of long
guns, myself.”

    10

  “Did Henry say where he was going?”
“He said—I lectured him a little about
drinking too much, of course I was talking
against my own business—that he was go-
ing away for a day or two and wanted a
little to take along with him.”

  “Didn’t he say where he was going?”
“No, not that I remember. I just sup-
posed he was going to the city.”

  “Well, much obliged to you, Mag.
George and I’ll be on our way. We may
drop in on you again.”

  “Glad to see you any time. Come again,
Mr. Frisbee, even if you don’t want any-
thing in my line. I like straight men, and
I believe you’re straight, like your father
was.”

  Frisbee and Dunaway proceeded up the
street in the gathering dusk.

  “Not much information there,” said
Dunaway, “but every little bit helps. I
had a sneaking idea that Henry might be
at her house, but I believe she was on the
square with us.”

  “So do I,” said Frisbee.

  “One thing I do know,” continued the
judge, “wherever Henry went, he didn’t
leave that rifle behind him. I went to his
room this morning. Told his landlady I
had an appointment with him and that he’d
asked me to come there and wait. His
rifle wasn’t anywhere in the room. I picked
up several cartridges.”

  He exhibited two long-nosed 30-30’s.

Chapter XVIII

FALLING STONES

  AT THE hotel, Frisbee discussed with
his partner the events of the last
J. Jk.twenty-fours hours.

  “George,” said Griswold, “it seems to
me that tbere’s one thing that’s very im-
portant, and that is to see that the Golconda
mine is guarded night and day until this
mystery is thoroughly cleared up. Let’s
go over and talk to the sheriff. He'll
probably see the propriety of it himself.
Aside from any other feature of the case,
the mine is Miss Packer’s property, and it
seems to be a valuable property now, or at
least to have some value in it.”

  The sheriff had gone home to an early
supper, and they followed him to his
house, adjoining George’s quarters of the
previous night.

  “I agree with you boys about guarding
the mill,” he assured them. “I’ve had two
men there all day, and I’m posting two
there for tonight.”

  “Not only the mill, sheriff,” said Gris-
94

SHORT STORIES

wold. “I think the whole mine should be
guarded. Miss Packer is the sole owner,
now, I understand. If Gaspard Dubonnet
found some high-grade in the mine there’s
probably more of it. They tell me those
nuggets are practically pure gold. Some-
body’s likely to try to carry off fifty or
a hundred pounds of that stuff. At around
twenty dollars an ounce it wouldn’t take
long for a good many thousand dollars’
worth to disappear. How much of a job
would it be to guard the whole property?”

  "H-mm,” said the sheriff. “Not much,
I reckon. So far as I know there’s only
one entrance to the mine besides the tun-
nel. That’s the shaft. The shaft-house is
up on the hill. But it hasn’t been used
for years. What Httle work Gass did was
done through the tunnel. I doubt if the
old shaft is in good enough repair for any-
body to get down it. But we’ll just take a
look at the shaft-house. If that girl has
some real pay-dirt in that mine you bet
I’ll see that it stays there till she’s well
enough to look after it. Lemme hitch up
and I’ll drive you up there with me. Go-
in’ up there anyway to take two fellers to
relieve the boys that are there now. Hey,
Billy 1” he called up-stairs to his son.

  “Yes, Dad!”

  “You go up the street and get Axel Ol-
son, and then you two boys be ready to go
with me to the mill, as soon as I get the
team hitched. Has your mother got your
lunch ready?”

  She had, it seemed. A comfortable moth-
erly hamper of sandwiches, boiled eggs
and pie, with a thermos bottle of hot
coffee.

  Frisbee and Griswold accompanied the
sheriff to the barn and watched him while
he put his faithful work-horses to the an-
cient buckboard. He conversed amicably
during the operation.

  “Motors are all right most anywhere but

not in the mountains, especially in winter.
Our roads ain’t good enough for motors
up here, away from the bulk of the tourist
travel, and there’s too much snow. I don’t
believe an automobile could make it from
here to the mill tonight.”

  “Well/' said Frisbee, playfully provok-
ing an argument, “at any rate the automo-
bile wouldn’t get scared at eyes in the dark
like Pete Hawkins’ horse.”

  “That’s so, too, but that’s because a
horse has some intelligence. For my part,

I believe every word Pete Hawkins said,
and I don’t believe in ghosts, neither. He
may not ’ave seen what he thought he saw,
but he did see somethin’. That’s one rea-
son why I’m sendin’ the boys up there to-
night an’ why I’ve kept a guard on the
place ever since that night.

  “Of course, Mr. Frisbee, I don’t be-
lieve you’re any guiltier than I am. Slade
and Kenehan might criticise me if they
knew I was takin’ you up there with me,
but in the eyes of the law you’re an inno-
cent man yet, and I believe you will be
just as innocent when this thing is all
thrashed out.”

  “I appreciate your confidence, Mr.
Bates. I assure you it isn’t misplaced.
I’m more anxious than anybody in this
town to solve this mystery.”

  “Well, I think we’re goin’ to find that
murderer right around here,” said the sher-
iff confidently. “I wouldn’t be a bit sur-
prised if he was somewhere in the old mine
this very minute, though I’ll admit I don’t
know how he could have got into the mill
house or out of it.

   “The place has been watched, I’m tellin’
you. Except for the time when Pete
Hawkins was walkin’ back to town, an’ the
time it took the doctor an’ the rest of us
to get back there, there’s been somebody
at the mill ever since the murder. I stayed
there till morning after the doctor went
back to town. Slade came up early to
look the place over, and then I came back
and sent a couple of men up. Slade told
me he’d stay there till they came.”

  “Did you notice anything peculiar while
you were there?” inquired Griswold.

   “N-no; I can’t say that I did. I thought,
once or twice, that I heard some little noise
back in the old ore-chute, but I ain’t
sure.”

  “In the ore-chute, you say?” said Fris-
bee curiously. “Well, now, that’s odd. I
heard a thump in the ore-chute myself
when I was there with Dubonnet. He said
it was a rock falling down.”

   “Like as not,” said the sheriff casually.
“I guess that’s what I heard, if I heard
anything. There’s always rocks falling in
an old mine.

  “That's one reason why it’s dangerous to
be in one of ’em. The timbers gradually
THE GHOST OF THE GOLCONDA

95

rot away, of course, and there’s always
moisture loosenin’ the rock in the walls
and roof. Why, I’ll bet the old Golconda
levels and stopes are half caved in. I
know old Gass ain’t done hardly any real
timbering in the last dozen years.

   “So if there’s somebody hidin’ in there,

I wouldn’t like to be in his place. An’ I
don’t just see how he’s goin’ to get out
without runnin’ against my men—though
I hadn’t thought- about the shaft. It
didn’t occur to me that anybody could get
out by it.

  “Slade seems kinda crabby about ex-
plorin’ the mine, for some reason. And
Kenehan was the same way until this eve-
ning. Seemed to take it for granted it
wasn’t necessary, because you musta been
the murderer, Mr. Frisbee. I mentioned
it to him tonight, and he said it was non-
sense to think the murderer was in the
mine and that anyway we’d better wait
until Miss Packer got well enough to talk
about it, so she could give us authority to
investigate.

   “We’ll watch it, just the same. Here
come the boys. Hop aboard, gentlemen.
We’ll take a little pleasure drive up the
creek.”

  Billy Bates was obviously impressed
with the importance of his assignment,
guarding the mill for the night, as his
father’s deputy. His partner, Axel Ol-
son, was a year or two older and apparent-
ly somewhat more phlegmatic. Bates had
a small hunting rifle, and Olson was pro-
vided with an army Springfield.

  “Dad, I wonder how Pete Hawkins’
ghost would like the taste of a bullet,” said
Billy. “I believe, if I see any ghosts, I’ll
just start in to plug ’em.”

   “You won’t do nothin’ of the kind,” said
his father. “If you see any ghosts you
just arrest ’em, that’s all.”

   Bill subsided, while the other lad snick-
ered.

   “And look here,” continued the sheriff.
“I want one of you boys to be awake and
outside the mill all the time. I want that
one to be near the corner where he can see
both sides of the mill, an’ the tunnel door,
an’ the mill door. You can take turns
sleepin’. One feller can sleep inside for
three hours at a stretch, but I want the
other one of you to be where he can see
the road and both sides of the mill, and
not leave that place except to wake up the
other feller when it’s his turn to relieve
him. You understand me, boys?”

   They assured him that they did.

   “Well, it ain’t so cold tonight, I’m glad

to say,” continued the sheriff. “But,
Billy, when you’re outside, keep your coat
buttoned around you. If you catch cold,
your mother’ll never forgive me for puttin’
you on guard here.”

   Between the solicitude of a parent and
the severity of a superior officer, Mr. Bates
pretty well filled up the time with instruc-
tions and admonitions until their arrival at
the mill. There he greeted two young
men waiting on the steps. They seeme l
very glad to see him.

   “Anything new, boys?” he inquired.

   “Quiet as a graveyard, Mr. Bates,” said
one of them.

   “H-mm,” replied the sheriff. “Well, it
is a sort of a graveyard. You’ll have to
wait here, boys, for about half an hour,
unless you want to walk back to town. I’m
going to take these gentlemen up to where
they can see the shaft-house. We’d better
walk, Mr. Frisbee. It ain’t very far, but
the road ain’t broken, and I know the team
can’t make it up the hill.”

   He pointed out the shaft-house, a lonely
structure a quarter of a mile up the side
of the mountain and apparently six or sev-
en hundred feet higher than the mill.

  “There she is. We’ll walk up the old
road. It’s the only way we can get up
there, and it winds about half a mile
around the mountain.”

   They followed him past the mill to where
an ancient road, whose ruts were deep
enough to have left their outline in the
snow carpet, led away from the main high-
way and took a steep course by two switch-
backs up to the old building.

  The sheriff, for all his sixty years,
plugged steadily through the heavy snow at
a pace which his companions found diffi-
cult to follow. He even had breath enough
to talk.

  “Well, one thing’s a cinch,” he re-
marked. “This convenient snow proves
that at least no one has been up here since
it stopped falling.” He grinned back at
the laboring young men. “Can you step
out, a little, boys, or is it too hard for
you ?”

   They “stepped out” to the best of their
ability, but were vastly relieved to arrive
at last, panting and with their knees shak-
ing, at the comparatively level piece of
ground which surrounded the front and
two sides of the old building. The reat
ran into the hill.

   The shaft-house was built of substan-
tial timbers, and, though weather-beaten,
was in pretty good repair. The door,
however, was locked.
96

SHORT STORIES

  “Slade has the key, of course,” muttered
the sheriff. “He took Gass’ keys along
with all his other personal stuff. But this
lock doesn’t look as if it had been opened
since the nineteen-ten census. I doubt if
the key would unlock it now. Say, boys,
ain’t that a pretty view of Jamestown and
the canyon from here? Just look at that
sunset, will you! Did you ever see any-
thing finer in your life?”

  The view and the sunset were all that he
claimed for them. Frisbee stood with him
for a moment, marveling how the sordid
village had become ennobled when seen in
the pure whiteness of the snow, its twink-
ling lights beginning to sparkle like gems
on the long shadow-fingers cast by the
peaks across the canyon.

  But Frisbee’s admiration was broken by
a remark from his more practical partner.

  “Yes; it’s a peach of a view, all right,
but I wish we could get a view inside this
old building. Thunderation! It’s cer-
tainly too bad that we haven’t got the
key! ’

  He applied his eye to the narrow space
between two of the upright boards.

  “Too dark inside to see anything, of
course.”

  Suddenly he held up his hand for si-
lence. All listened intently. In the depths
of the mountain below them they heard a
dull crash, quickly repeated twice at a
greater distance.

  “Gosh!” said Bates, with a shudder.
“That must be a section of the shaft wall
failin’ in. Boys, it’s lucky for us we ain’t
in that shaft right now. Well, let’s go.
There’s nothin’ we can see—from here.”

  The return was easy. They walked
back in the trail which they had broken in
the snow on their upward journey.

  The sheriff was silent on the downward
trip. At the mill he picked up the two
young men, who had waited for the ride
back, and gave a parting admonition to his
son and Olson.

  “Boys,” he said, “mind you, no shoot-
in’ unless in self-defense. That won’t be

likely, but don’t let anybody go up or down
the road unless you know all about ’em.
An’ be ready to report to me everything
you see, and every noise you hear. An—
oh yes, be sure to arrest all ghosts.”

  But after this joking parting shot he re-
lapsed into a thoughtful silence which con-
tinued during the drive back to town. At
the upper end of the village he bade good-
by to his deputies telling them he would
pick them up about eight o’clock in the
morning.

  “There’s one thing I’ll ask of you two
fellers," he added as his assistants alighted
from the buckboard. “An* that is, don’t
tell anybody about our goin’ up to the
shaft-house tonight. We didn’t find any-
thing up there, but I don’t want it talked
about, around town.”

  The two young men gave him their as-
surance. Bates clucked to his horses.

  As the wagon moved down the street, he
turned to the two lawyers.

  “Boys,” he said, “I don’t think it’s ne-
cessary to post a guard at the shaft-house
tonight. We’ve seen that nobody but us
has been up to it or has come from it since
the snow. Nobody could get up there
from the town without being seen an’
stopped by my boys at the mill. There
ain’t many people up the creek, an’ there
surely ain’t any of ’em that would come
snoopin’ into an old shaft at night—or any
other time, if they could help it. They’re
miners, an’ they’ve got some sense.

  “But I'm puzzled about them sounds.
There’s always rocks failin’ in an old mine,
as I said. But there’s too many of ’em
failin’ there in a short time. Frisbee heard
one in the mill-end of the chute last night.
I thought I heard two, way back in the
chute, later last night, though if that’s
what it was it’s odd that they didn’t come
on down the chute. We all three of us heard
quite a fall in the shaft tonight. It ain’t
normal. I’m satisfied there’s somethin’
goin’ on in those old diggin’s, an’ I’m go-
in’ to find out what it is—tomorrow. I’m
kind of anxious to hear what the boys’ll
have to report, in the morning.”

LOVE AND DOUBT

SHERIFF BATES came to the hotel
a few minutes before eight the next
morning. Judge Dunaway was
with him. Inspired by the early-rising
habit of the mountain inn, even on a Sun-
day morning, and perhaps rather restless
because of their excitement, Frisbee and
Griswold had been up for an hour and
were just finishing breakfast.

  Bates and Dunaway joined them at their
table in the dining-room and conversed in
low tones, though there was no one with-
in convenient earshot.

  “Mr. Frisbee,” Said Bates, “I asked
Judge Dunaway to come with me, because
I want him to see Miriam Packer—if any-
body can see her—and get permission to
examine the mine. I think it ought to be
done today, but I don’t just
like to do it without her per-
mission. Besides, Slade has
the keys to the shaft-house
and to the trap-door in the
mill, and I’m positive he
won’t give ’em up unless Mi-
riam demands ’em. Kenehan
might force him to do it, but
Kenehan doesn’t just know
where he’s at in this whole
matter, and I’d rather not
have to depend on him. Of course I
guess I have the legal right to break in, in
search of a criminal.”

  “I think so,” said Griswold, “even with-
out a search-warrant. The mine isn’t
anybody’s house.”

  “Well, Bates,” said Dunaway, “I sup-
pose it would be possible to smoke ’em out.
All you’d have to do would be to start a
good smudge in the lowest level.”

  “I’ve thought of that,” replied the sher-
iff, “but I’m afraid it won’t do. Whoever
it is that’s in the mine might be suffocated
by the smoke. I don’t want to kill any-
body in making an arrest, if I can help it.”
“And we’re not dead sure,” added Duna-
way, “that the man in the mine, or the men
in the mine”—he appeared to be measur-
ing his words carefully— “have committed
a capital crime. Besides, I’d like to talk
to the fellow, the fellows. I think they
might have something important to tell us.”
“Oh,” said Bates, “the thing to do, plain-
ly, is to search the mine, but I don’t want to
do it without Miriam’s consent, except as
a last resort. Judge Dunaway thinks that
you, Mr. Frisbee, have some special influ-
ence with Miss Packer, and he wants you
10

to come with us. Can you come right
now ? I want to pick up them two depu-
ties as soon as I can, and, as it is, I’ll be a
little late relieving the boys I posted at the
mill last night.”

  “But we’ll have to get hold of Doctor
Martin, first,” said Dunaway, “and get his
permission to talk to the girl.”

  “I certainly think so,” said Frisbee. “No
matter what happens at the mine, it isn’t
so important as what happens to her. Let’s
call the doctor.”

  He went to the desk and was asking the
clerk to call Doctor Martin, when the phy-
sician himself came down the stairs on his
way to breakfast.

  “What is this, gentlemen? A reception
committee?” inquired the doctor, as the
four men surrounded him and led him to a
corner of the hotel office.

  “A reception committee, and a visiting
committee,” replied Frisbee. “In the first
place we want to know how your patient
is.”

  “My patient? Say, do you fellows think
I’m such a poor doctor that I only have
one patient? There’s generally more than
one person sick at a time, even in a healthy
place like Jamestown.”

  “Oh, he means your most important pa-
tient,” said Dunaway.

  “Oh, yes, of course,” returned the doc-
tor. “So far as he is concerned, there is
only one. Well, I’m glad to say she was
a whole lot better last evening. If she
rested well last night, I’m going to let her
sit up a little today.”

  “That’s fine,” said Bates. “I want to
ask her something that’s important,
though it’s simple enough.”

  “Business matter?” inquired the doctor,
looking serious.

  “Yes, in a way. I want her authority to
make a search of the Golconda mine.”

  The doctor whistled softly. “Don’t
know about asking her a thing like that.
Don’t want to get her excited, now. Her
wound has closed nicely, and I don’t want
to run any risk of starting a fever. What’s
the matter with your making a search with-
out anybody’s authority. You’re the sher-
iff, aren’t you? Seems to me I voted for
you for sheriff. Scratched my ticket to do
it, too.”

  “Oh, yes, I can do it that way, I reckon;
and I may have to do it that way. But I
don’t want to. I’d like to have her own
say-so, if I can get it.”

  “Well, come along to her house, and
we’ll see how she is. Guess my breakfast
can wait half an hour. I was feeling so
98

SHORT STORIES

easy about her, I was going to wait till
I’d had my ham and eggs, but I’m not so
sure about this kind of a proposition.”

  The whole five of them repaired to the
sheriff’s buckboard and drove the block and
a half to Miriam’s house.

  Miss Chapin greeted them with pleas-
ant surprise at the top of the high side
stairs. “Well, I declare! Are all of you
gentlemen calling on Miriam?”

  “Well, I’m not going to let them all see
her,” responded the doctor. “How is she
this morning ? Oh, excuse me, I don’t be-
lieve you’ve met Mr. Griswold, Mr. Fris-
bee’s partner. Miss Chapin, Mr. Gris-
wold.”

  Miss Chapin acknowledged Griswold’s
bow, and turned to the physician.

  “Why, I think she’s just fine. She had
a splendid restful night. She’s just waked
up, hungry, and wants her breakfast. I
wasn’t going to give her any until you told
me what she could have.”

  “Hungry, eh?” said the doctor, rubbing
his hands. “Well, you can give her some
grape-fruit, and some oatmeal, and some
lamb chops, and some fried eggs, and a big
plate of waffles and syrup, and some tea
and toast—especially the tea and toast.

She can have
that, now—b u t
make the tea
rather weak.
You can give
her the other
things along
about next Sun-
day. But let me
see her. Wait
here, gentlemen. You can call on Miss
Chapin for a few minutes. She’s good
company.”

  The grinning men seated themselves in
the parlor while the doctor disappeared.

  He came back directly. “She’s in fine
trim this morning,” he announced. “But
I want to keep her that way. I guess she
can talk a little business, but make it brief.
Dunaway, you and Mr. Frisbee go in.
She wants to see you both.”

  Dunaway turned smilingly toward the
younger man. “You go in first, George.
I’ll wait a minute.”

  George went in the direction indicated,
and knocked at the door of Miriam’s
room. “Come in,” said the voice he had
been longing to hear.

  She was propped up in bed and greeted
him with a radiant smile.

  “I knew it would be you, George. Sit

down beside me and tell me what has hap-
pened.”

  “First,” said George, “I want to beg
your pardon for my cruel rudeness to you
and your guest. I hope—I do hope you
can forgive me.”

  “George, I knew you couldn’t help it.
Some things overpower us at times, and
you were simply overpowered that eve-
ning. Poor Mr. Dubonnet said so, him-
self. He didn’t criticise you.”

  “No, he was very generous to me. He
shook hands with me when I went out to
see him, that night, at the mill.”

  “Oh, I’m so glad! George, for twenty
years he had been fighting a terrible sor-
row and remorse. He was as sensitive as
a child. But he was so—so good and kind
to me.”

  Her chin quivered a little. “He couldn’t
have been any kinder if he had been my
own father. Oh, poor man, poor man!
Why, why, did he do it?”

  “Oh, Miriam, don’t think about that old
affair. Up here in the mountains the
bloody old frontier days lasted for a long
time. And, anyway, men’s minds and pas-
sions change in twenty years.”

  “You—you don’t understand me,
George. But what happened yesterday ?
They wouldn’t tell me, but I knew there
was something going on, something that
involved you.”

  “Yes,” said George, smiling grimly. “It
involved me a whole lot. They had me in
your charming city Bastille all night,

charged with-”

  “Oh, George, they blamed you for Mr.
Dubonnet’s death!” Her eyes opened
wide again, and she clasped her hands.
“Oh, what a stupid, cruel wrong!”

  “There, there! I shouldn’t have said
anything about it. The doctor told us we
positively mustn’t get you excited. Any-
way, it’s all right now, as far as I’m per-
sonally concerned. They turned me loose
yesterday afternoon at the inquest.”

  “George, what did—what did the coron-
er’s jury decide was the cause of Mr. Du-
bonnet’s death?”

  She looked at him rather strangely, Fris-
bee thought.

  “That’s the trouble. They didn’t decide
anything except ‘gunshot by some person
or agency unknown.’ They put in the
‘agency’ because some of them seemed to
think the old gentleman was killed by a
ghost—the ghost of my father, I suppose.
But they still have their eagle eyes on me.
I’m not formally charged with the crime,
but I’m suspected of it.”

  “Why, George, this is terrible! It must
be cleared up.”

  She half rose to a sitting position, but
immediately dropped back, her lips twitch-
ing with pain.

  “Oh, Miriam, dear girl, I shouldn’t have
talked so much. I’m going, now. There’s
just one thing more I want to say—at
present. There have been noises heard in
the mine. The sheriff wants your permis-
sion to examine it.”

  The girl suddenly shrank back in the
pillows.

  “No, no, George! I thought so at first
myself, but I was wrong. It can’t be.
Not now! Not now! Don’t ask me why.
But don’t let them go in there!”

  George was, naturally, amazed. He start-
ed to say something, but paused because
he could find nothing to say. Then he be-
thought himself of another commission
she had given him through her young
woman companion.

  “You wanted me to find your cousin
Henry,” he said. “Well, I have to report
failure so far. We’ve looked all over
town, and made many inquiries, but we
can’t locate him.”

  “I—I guess he’s gone to Denver—or

        ......

            mm

somewhere. It doesn’t matter now. Are
—are you going, George?”

  He had risen, and was lifting her hand.
He put it, limp and unresisting, to his lips.

  The hand tightened around his fingers
and drew him back toward her. He
looked at her face, and she drew him with
her eyes. He dropped on his knees beside
her and kissed her lips. He felt her arms
around his neck, crushing his face to hers.

  “Miriam, precious girl!” he murmured.
“I know, now. I must have loved you all
my life.”

  “George, dearest—I was afraid I might
die before you had kissed me!”

  She pushed him gently from her, so that
she might look into his face. “But now—
now that I shall live, and we shall both
live— Oh, everything is different. George,
don’t let them search the mine. And
whatever you do please don’t search it
yourself.”

  The strangeness of it bewildered him.
“Won’t—won’t you tell me why?” he
stammered pathetically.

  “George, oh, my darling boy, don’t quar-
  to

rel with me. George—I—love you with
all my soul! I’ll—I’ll tell you later.”

   George was rising again.

  “Send Judge Dunaway to me, please.”

  George turned away. She spoke his
name faintly, and, as he looked back, he
saw her arms outstretched to him.

  “Once more, dear heart! Once more,
then go.”

   His arms, his lips, found her again.

Chapter XX

SENTRY-GO

SHE doesn’t want the mine searched,
now, Mr. Bates,” said George, as he
re-entered the sitting room. “I’m
sure I don’t know why, but her word is law
with me—from now on forever.”

  “Congratulations, dear fellow,” said
Dunaway. “But let me see her. Per-
haps I can persuade her.”

  He could not however, and when he
emerged in his turn he was equally at a
loss to explain why. He declared that the
lady had given him no reason, but that he
hoped the sheriff would respect her wishes
for the present.

  Frisbee, watching him narrowly, some-
how gained the impression that he had a
theory concerning the reason; but what-
ever that theory was, the judge did not dis-
close it.

   “Gentlemen,” said Bates, “I don’t like
. this. I think we ought to search the mine
right away. I believe it’s important. But
you’re the one principally concerned, Mr.
Frisbee, and I’ll take the chance of post-
poning it a little longer. Of course it’ll
save some trouble —and possibly some
danger—to myself and my men.”

  “Danger?” inquired Frisbee, hoping to
get a more definite idea of what was in the
sheriff’s mind.

   “Yes—there’s a lot of rocks falling in
that mine,” responded the sheriff dryly.
“It’s always dangerous to go into an old
mine.”

   “It certainly is,” agreed Dunaway, “es-
pecially this one.”

   “But,” said the sheriff, “believe me, I’ll
watch it. I’ll have to hurry now and re-
lieve those boys. Want to go along, any-
body?”

   They all did, it appeared, except the doc-
tor.

   Bates stopped in the upper end of the
village and picked up the two men whom he
had taken home the evening before, and
soon arrived at the mine. The road had
become pretty well beaten down, and in
IOO

the frosty morning before the sun had
warmed it up, it was rather hard, though
rough, and the sheriff’s horses made pretty
fair time.

  They found the night guards sitting on
the mill steps, both looking rather fagged.

  “Well, boys,” said Bates, cheerfully,
“guess you’ve been on your job all right
enough. You both look as if you were
awake most of the night.”

  “I’ll say we were!” said Olson.

  “Oh, now, Axel, this is just beginning
to get interesting. Say, Dad, lemme stay
up here with these fellers today. We’re
just startin’ on an elegant ghost-hunt.”
“What’s that! You boys been seein’
ghosts, too?”

  “I’ll say we have,” repeated Olson.
“An’ I’m tellin’ you I don’t wanta see no
more.”

“Oh,” protested Billy, “we didn’t see
nothin’ but the eyes, and Axel only seen
’em once, but they scared him to death.”
“Tell me all about it,” directed his
father, “and tell it in order.”

  “It was this way,” narrated the boy.
“Axel, he took the first shift out here, and
I went inside to sleep. I’d put the cot
down here at the south end, so’s to be near
Axel if he should holler, an’ because I
didn’t like to sleep under the ore chute.
I’d thought I heard a noise in there like a
little rock slidin’ down, and a kind of a
bump against the end. Axel didn’t call me
till eleven o’clock—well, it was about quar-
ter of eleven—” he turned a reproachful
look at his companion. “He did wake me
up a little bit early, the big lobster. I sup-
pose he got tired of doin’ sentry duty out
here in the cold.

  “Well, when I went out, I put a couple
of ma’s ham sandwiches in my pocket. An’
after I’d been out here a few minutes, I
took one of ’em out of my pocket, and had
just started to unwrap the paper she’d put
around it, when all of a sudden I looked at
that little hole in the bottom of the tunnel
door, an’ there was a pair of eyes lookin’
at me. I can tell you I was scared plum
stiff, because I remembered what Pete
Hawkins had said about them eyes—
What you laughin’ at, Judge Dunaway?”
The others looked at the judge in sur-
prise. His mouth was open in a broad
grin.

  “It wasn’t no joke to me,” continued the
boy, and the others agreed with him.

  “Go on, kid,” said the judge. “You’re
doing fine, and I believe every word you
say. What happened next?”

  “Well, I kind of pulled myself togeth-

er, and I pointed my rifle at the eyes, an’
then I remembered that dad had said, ‘No
shootin’ except in self-defense’, an’ thinks
I, ‘I ain’t been attacked yet; the thing is
just lookin’ at me.’ So I hollers out, real
bold, ‘Halt!’ says I, ‘Who comes here?’
But there wasn’t no answer. The thing
just kept lookin’ at me. And I looked
around for somethin’ to throw at it, but the
snow was kinda hard, and I couldn’t find
a stone handy, an’ then I grabbed the sand-
wich—I’d dropped it when I aimed my gun
—and I shied the sandwich straight at the
eyes. An’ the eyes disappeared, quick as
a wink, an’ the sandwich went right square
into the hole. An’ then I started to come
a step or two toward the tunnel door. I’m
bound to say I didn’t come very fast. I
wouldn’t be surprised if it took me two
minutes to walk them two steps.

  “An’ then—now I can’t be quite sure
about this—but it seemed to me there was
a faint glimmer of light back somewhere
under the mill. Anyway, I heard a little
noise somewhere inside, a little noise like
‘psst!’ ”

  Judge Dunaway suddenly clapped his

hand on his
thigh and broke
into a guffaw of
merriment.
“‘Psst! Psst!’ ”
h e repeated.
“Say, kid, this
is the best
ever!”

  The b o y’s
pride was hurt.
The others were
annoyed by the unseemly levity.

  “Well,” said Billy, “I—I ain’t abso-
lutely positive I heard it. It wasn’t a very
loud sound. But I think I did.”

  “I think so too, Billy,” replied Duna-
way. “I’m almost positive you heard it.
It’s just exactly the kind of a sound you’d
be likely to hear.”

  The boy looked at him doubtfully and
rather resentfully. Was this sarcasm?
Was the judge insinuating that he would
be likely to hear imaginary sounds ?

  “Go on please, Billy,” said the judge.
“I’m strong for you. What happened
next ?”

  “Well, Axel had heard me holler, an’ he
come tumblin’ out, with his rifle in his
hands. We waited a while an’ didn’t see
nothin’ more, an’ then I took a flashlight
an’ went close up to the hole an’ looked
around inside of it, an’ couldn’t see noth-
in at all. I put the flashlight inside, an’

—I was kinda scared to do it at first, be-
cause I remembered that Pete Hawkins
thought a skeleton hand might grab a fel-
ler’s wrist if he put it in there, but I laid
down first with my face to the opening and
looked around as far as I could see. I
reached my arm inside an’ felt around, but
I couldn’t feel nothin’ except the rocky
ground. I couldn’t even find the sand-
wich. It must ’ave rolled quite a ways to
one side. I found the paper it had been
wrapped, in, right near the opening, but I
couldn’t find any part of the sandwich.”
“Nothing unnatural about that,” inter-
posed Dunaway. “The ghost was hungry,
and ate it up, that’s all. I don’t think that
ghost has had his regular meals since Gass
Dubonnet died. What happened next?”
“Well, nothin’ happened then,” said the
boy rather peevishly, “an’ finally Axel said
he didn’t believe I’d seen the eyes, an’ any-
way he was goin’ to sleep.

  “I stayed out there to finish my three
hours’ sentry-go, an’ bimeby I seen the eyes
again—just lookin’ at me out of the hole.
So—I wanted Axel to see ’em an’ not
think I was tellin’ him a fairy story—I
went up the steps an’ called him, not very
loud. He musta heard me in his sleep,
because he stopped snorin’, but he was
sound asleep just the same. I went in an’
shook him awake. He was kinda cross,
an’ didn’t want to come out, but I dragged
him out; it was about half past one, I
reckon. The eyes wasn’t there when we
got back, but pretty soon they came to the
hole again. And Axel—he hadn’t be-
lieved me before, but he sure did, then—
he was that scared he nearly crumpled up
on the ground. You see ’em, didn’t you?”
Billy inquired, turning to his comrade.
“I’ll say I did,” replied Axel sheepishly.
“Axel kinda got his nerve back after a
bit, an’ he wanted to shoot, but I wouldn’t
stand for it except in self-defense, as dad
had said, an’ of course the eyes wasn’t do-
in’ nothin’ to us except lookin’ at us. That
was kinda scarey, I will say, but I didn’t
feel quite so nervous when Axel was there
with me, so I says to the eyes, ‘What do
you want?’ an’ then I says, ‘What you
lookin’ for?’ but I didn’t get no answer.”
“Looking for the other sandwich, of
course,” interposed Judge Dunaway. “Did
you feed the ghost again?”

  Billy vouchsafed a very cold reply to
this impertinent interruption.

  “There wasn’t any sandwich left. I’d
et it myself. Now, as I was about to tell
you, I started up to the eyes, but I’d just
10

taken a couple of steps when they disap-
peared.”

  “Did you have a sandwich in your pock-
et when you started,” asked Dunaway.

  “Of course I didn’t. Say, Judge,
what’ye keep joshin’ me for? Well, we
stayed there a while, but the eyes didn’t
come back, an’ nothin’ happened then un-
til Mr. Slade came up.”

  “Mr. Slade!” exclaimed the sheriff.
“Yes, he came up, on foot, about half
past two. Told us he’d been thinkin’
about Pete Hawkins’ ghost story, that he
didn’t believe in ghosts, himself, but he
just thought he’d come up, to see if there
really was anythin’ hoppin’ ’round here at
night. So we told him about the eyes, and
he seemed real interested, and we all
watched for them together, but they didn’t
come again, an’ finally he says, ‘Boys, I be-
lieve you’re dreamin’, or ejse you’re spoof-
in’ me.’ An’ he says, ‘It’s too cold to stay
outside.’ I went in with him, because it
was Axel’s turn for sentry-go. Axel
wanted to come in with us, but I said, ‘No,
dad wouldn’t like that,’ so he stayed out-
side. Mr. Slade sat for a few minutes
talkin’ with me, an’ I asked him to help
himself to the lunch, an’ he did. An’ then
I said I was tired, an’ would he mind if I
went to bed, an’ he said, ‘Certainly not,
Billy. I’ll just set here by the fire a few
minutes,’ he said, ‘an’ get warmed up, an’
then I’ll go out an’ keep Axel company.”
“How long did Mr. Slade stay here?”
asked the sheriff, rather severely.

  “Well—er—Dad, you’ll have to ask
Axel that.”

  The sheriff turned inquiringly to the
other.

  “I—I don’t just know, Mr. Bates.”
  “Don’t know?” repeated Bates.

  “You—you see, it’s like this, sheriff.
Mr. Slade stayed out there with me for a
while, an’ finally he says, ‘You’re tired ain’t
j'ou, kid ?’ An’ I allowed I was, ’cause I’d
taken the first turn, an’ been up most of
the second turn besides, an’ he says, ‘I’ll
relieve you for an hour or so, if you want
to get a little nap,’ an’ so I just give him
my gun, an’ went in an’ sat in the arm-
chair by the fire to take a little bit of a
snooze, an’ the first thing I knew, it was
quarter after five, an’ Billy was movin’

around, an’-”

  “I must have waked myself,” said the
sheriff's son. “When I went to sleep, I
kept thinkin’ it would be my turn again
from five to eight.”

  The sheriff, who had been glaring at
Olson with mounting indignation, shot a
102

SHORT STORIES

momentary glance of pride at his own off-
spring. Then he turned savagely on the
other young man.

  “You’re a hell of a sentry, you are, Ol-
son!” he exploded. “I left
a man here to relieve you
at the proper time—and a
good man, too, even if he
is only an eighteen year
old kid, and my own son.
I didn’t say anything to
you about being relieved
by anybody except me or
my deputies. And you desert your post,
and even give up your gun to a stranger!”
“But, Sheriff, Mr. Slade ain’t no strang-
er. He’s a county officer. I thought it
was all right to let him relieve me, if
he-”

  “Well, you’ve thought yourself out of a
job with me, that’s all. You beat it right
down the road for town. I don’t want you
around here, and I don’t want you in my
rig when I drive back. Come around to
my office after breakfast and get your pay
—though you ain’t worth a cent.”

  “Oh, say, Dad—” began Billy.

  “Oh say, nothin’!” snapped his father.
“Duty is duty and orders is orders. No
man can hang around me that won’t do his
duty, and no man can work for me that
won’t take my orders. Where’s Olson’s
gun? Have him take it, an’ git.”

  “I—I reckon Mr. Slade musta took it
with him when he went,” said the wretched
ex-deputy. “I’ll get it at his office. Good
—good-by, Billy.”

  He started disconsolately down the road.
“I suppose,” said Griswold, “that Mr.
Slade simply decided that guard duty was
unnecessary.”

  “Humph!” snorted the sheriff. “I’ll do
the decidin’ myself in my own department.
Well, come in, gentlemen. Maybe you’d
like to look around in the mill again.”

Chapter XVI

  A HUNGRY GHOST-AND OTHER THINGS

THE judge had withdrawn from the
group and was on the other side of
the road, gazing reflectively at the

creek.

  “Ain’t it remarkable,” he said irrele-
vantly, “how quick our mountain streams
rise and fall? Saturday forenoon, after
the snow, Gold Creek was quite high. Of
course it hasn’t been very cold, and the
snow went almost as fast as rain, after old
Sol had begun to get in his work. And
now you d think most of it had run down

the canyon. The creek has dropped more
than a foot.”

  “Say, Billy,” he continued, turning
toward the group by the door, “wouldn’t
you like to see your mysterious eyes by
daylight. I think I can show them to you
again. Got another sandwich left in your
bucket ?”

  “Why, sure, I guess so,” said the boy,
perplexed. “I’ll bring it.”

  It was a fair-sized basket, not an ordi-
nary dinner-bucket, which his mother had
packed for him, but he was much surprised
when he opened it, on the top step of the
mill.

  “Well, by gosh!” he ejaculated. “I guess
Mr. Slade did help himself, or else Axel
ate my lunch, as well as his. There ain’t
nothin’ left except this little odd scrap of
meat.”

  “That’ll do fine,” said the judge. “You
just watch now, while I make a ghost
trap.”

  He laid the scrap of meat about a foot
from the hole and sat down beside it, with
his back against the tunnel door, his hand
over the opening.

  “If your ghost doesn’t come pretty soon,
I’ll call to it,” he remarked, grinning, “but
let’s wait a minute or so.”

  That was all that was necessary. Billy
blushed with mortification, as the “ghost”
appeared at the entrance. An instant later
it uttered a “psst—psst” as the judge’s
hand clutched the back of its neck. The
cat was rather wild, but Judge Dunaway
maintained his grip while he soothed it.

  The newly arrived deputies were doub-
ling up with laughter. The sheriff’s stout
form was shaking, and the tears were run-
ning down his cheeks.

  “Say, Judge! Say, Dad!” began the
wretched Billy. “Don’t give me away.
Please, fellows,” turning to the other depu-
ties, “don’t talk about this business around
town.”

  “Oh, Billy, this is too good—too good to
keep,” said one of the young men, starling
to open his lunch box.

  “A cat, or anybody else, would get hun-
gry staying up here in this old mine for a
couple of days,” remarked the judge.
“Come over here a minute, Billy. I want
to talk to you.”

  He led the crestfallen youth to one side.

  “Here’s something for you to think
about, lad,” he said, in an undertone. “As
you remarked a moment ago, it’s quite
singular that you didn’t find any part of the
sandwich you threw at the ghost last night.
Cats don’t care much for bread, though I

                                                       10

 suppose this cat might possibly have been
 hungry enough to eat it all. Even at that,
 there ought to be a few crumbs when we
 look behind that door—if the cat ate the
 sandwich. But if the cat was eating the
 sandwich, its first meal in two days, it
 ought to have been happy. Why should
 it have snarled the ‘psst’ that you thought
 you heard?”

   “Why, because it was mad or scared at
 something,” I suppose/’

  “Exactly. Now, what would make it
 particularly mad? Let’s assume that cats
 are just as natural as human beings.”
 “Well—er—it would have been pretty
 sore if it had lost its meal.”

   “Of course it would, just like anybody
 else. But that suggests that there was
 something or somebody else in the mine
 that was hungry, too, hungry enough to
 rob a cat. I have a pretty strong idea who
 it was.”

   “So have I!” exclaimed the boy. “And,
 believe me, I’ll find him. I ain’t goin’ to
 have those guys callin’ me a ninny because
 I was afraid of a cat.”

  The judge looked toward the mill.
 “Where’s your dad and the boys?” he in-
 quired, and then answered his own ques-
 tion. “Guess they’ve gone inside. So
 much the better. You and I’ll just play
 partners in this game for a little while,
 ' Billy. You’re the kind of a sentinel I
 like, and I owe you something for letting
 that cat out of the bag. Sit down here on
 the bank with me for a minute, and let’s
 talk about the old times. You don’t know
 much about the early days in this camp,
 but there’s some things worth knowing.

   “In the first place, do you know that all
 the original mining up here was placer
 mining—when they washed the gold out of
 the sands of the creek ?”

   “Why, sure,” replied the boy. “Every-
 one knows that, I reckon. They washed
 gold out of the creek before they found the
 lodes under the ground.”

   “And there’s still gold in the creek, isn’t
 there ?”

   “There’s some, of course. You’ll see
 old Tod Hargroves and Jed Snook workin’
 along here, most any time in summer, with
 a little mercury and a dishpan.”

   “They make tobacco money out of it,
 and I guess that’s about all. But the point
 I’m working at is that gold isn’t the only
 thing there is in this creek. The whole his-
 tory of the camp is in it. I've camped
 beside it many a night and talked to

(Concluded in the next

    to

® it while it’s talked to me. v It can tell you
  many a 6tory, and show you lots of
  things, if you have ears to hear and
  eyes to see. It knows where the gold
  is hidden, and sometimes it tells men
  that. It knows other things. I be-
  lieve it knows who killed Gass Dubonnet,
  and I believe it’s trying to tell us, now.
  That’s why it’s sunk so low in the last
  couple of days. That’s so it can talk low.
  It's trying to whisper to us—just to you
  and me, Billy. And I’m afraid that if we
  don’t get the secret, some old fool like
  Hargroves or Jed Snook might stumble
  across it, and maybe the creek never could
  tell that particular secret after that. Or
  maybe Slade might catch it—and then it’s
  a cinch you and I could never learn it.

    “Now, listen close. I mean look close.
  Turn your head this way a little. Look
  right square in the middle of the stream,
  right at the base of that rock. See any-
  thing ?”

    “Well, by criminy, I believe I do see
 somethin’. Somethin’ kinda shiny. Looks
 to me sort of like the edge of a sardine can
 buried in the sand.”

    The judge glanced toward the mill.

    “Those fellows are all inside,” said he. •
  “Now, Billy, if this is what I think it is,
  you go and tell your dad what you’ve
  found, and I reckon it’ll more than make
  up for the cat. You just wade in and in-
  vestigate that sardine can. Go below
  there, a little ways, where the rip-rap is
  broken. I reckon a spry young fellow like
  you can get down ail right, from there.
  I’d do it myself, only my rheumatism’ll kill
  me if I get my feet soaked—to say noth-
  ing of my kgs. And besides, this is your
  discovery. Remember, boy, you and I are
  partners."

    In a few seconds the boy, quite excited,
  was stumbling through the chilly water,
  which reached nearly to his knees, but ran
  into a little shoal at the base of the rock.
  When he pulled up the object, he nearly
  dropped it in his amazement.

    It was a long single-barreled pistol, with
  the trigger guard filed off and the trigger
  broken off!

    As Billy Bates brought this prize to the
  bank and handed it up to the judge, at the
  top of the wall, he latter drew from his
  pocket the semi-circle of steel which he had
  picked up underneath the mill. It was ob-
  viously the trigger guard of this identical
  weapon, Gaspard Dubonnet’s missing pis-
  tol.

THE MID-WATCH TRAGEDY

                 By VINCENT STARRETT

          Author of “The Missing Men ” “The Fugitive Statue,” etc.

    JIMMIE LAVENDER WAS ON HIS VACATION WHEN HE STEPPED ABOARD
    ONE OF THE BIG ATLANTIC LINERS, BUT EVEN THE VACATIONS OF FAMOUS
    DETECTIVES MAY TURN UP MURDER, ROBBERY AND SUDDEN DEATH

THE military-looking gentleman
produced a thin, expensive
watch from his waist-coat
pocket, and put it away again.
“The bar,” said he sagely,
"will be open in half an hour.”

  I acquiesced with a smile. He flicked
the end of his cigarette overboard, and
idly watched its descent until a wave took
it. Then, as if the action had removed
a weight from his mind, he turned briskly
and continued. “Do you play bridge, Mr.
Gilruth?”

  “No,” I said thankfully, “I don’t.”
Where the devil, I wondered, had he got
my name? We had been hardly an hour
at sea. He was excessively friendly—
much as, I understood, were the profes-
sional gamblers against whom the company
had thoughtfully warned its passengers.

  “My wife will be disappointed,” said he.
“You and your friend are about the only
eligibles she and her sister have discovered,
to date. I can play—but I won’t.”

  I resented his easy assumptions. My
acquaintance with Jimmie Lavender had
not been without its practical value, and I
had learned to distrust plausible strangers.

  “That, I believe, is my friend’s situation,
also,” I replied stiffly. “However, he must
answer for himself.”

  “Of course,” said he with a courteous
nod. “My respects to him, please. His
reputation is well known to me. My name
is Rittenhouse,” he added, handing me his

card. “And now I must run along and see
what has become of my women.”

  He turned away, and I watched him for
a moment as he threaded the crowded deck,
before I, too, turned and went in search
of Lavender. It was Lavender’s vacation,
I mused, and I was in a sense his nurse—
at any rate, his companion—and I did not
intend that he should be bothered, if I
could prevent. Not that Lavender was ill,
but certainly he was tired; and even if
the plausible Mr. Rittenhouse were not a
professional gambler, bridge was no game
for a man who needed rest.

  I circled the promenade deck in my
search, and at length climbed to the boat
deck, just in time to see Lavender appear
at the top of the aft companionway, closely
followed by a deck steward dragging a cou-
ple of chairs. The detective indicated a
spot amidships, somewhat sheltered, and
balanced an either side by a giant air
funnel.

  “Dump ’em down here,” he ordered.
“Hullo, Gilly! This looks like as good a
place as any. A quiet spot on the aft boat
deck is always to be preferred to the chat-
ter and publicity of the promenade. I’m
sick of crowds!”

 “See anybody you know?” I asked
casually.

  “Nary soul,” said he, “and don’t want
to. I’ve seen the purser, however, and
the dining-room steward. We’re to sit at
the purser’s table—all men. It’s rough on

                                                      to
THE MID-WATCH TRAGEDY

you, Gilly, but I haven’t enough small talk
to be good company for the women.”
“There are two of them looking for
you,” I said grimly, and told him of my
meeting with Rittenhouse, at whose card
until that moment I had not troubled to
look. It revealed that the military-looking
man’s name was Joseph, and that he was
a Major, retired, in the United States Ma-
rine Corps.

  Lavender snatched the card, as if to
verify my assertions, then chuckled de-
lightedly.

  “By George!” he cried. “It’s Rit!”
“You know him, then?” I asked some-
what taken aback.

 “Know him! Why we’ve hunted men
together! He served two terms as police
commissioner of Los Angeles, where I met
him. A better man never held office. And
you thought he was a crook!” He chuckled
again with great happiness. “Where is
he?”

  “Looking for his wife and her sister,
I believe.”

 “I must hunt him up. I hope you
weren’t rude, Gilly! Anybody else of in-
terest on board?”

  “I’ve looked over the passenger list,” I
replied airily. “There’s a British lord—
Denbigh, I think; a Sir John Rutherford;
Betty Cosgrave, the screen actress; an
Italian baroness whose name I forget, and
the Rev. Henry Murchison of Cedar
Rapids, Iowa.”

  “Good!” laughed Lavender. “You have
them pat. The baroness, I fancy, is the
dark woman who looked me over carefully
as I came on board. She was standing at
the rail, and I thought she looked as if she
knew me, or believed she did. She looked
Italian, anyway, and she was romantic
enough looking to be a baroness. I thought
for a moment that she was going to speak
to me, but if she was she thought better
of it.”

  “Confound it, Jimmie,” I said, “I hope
you’re not going to be bothered hy baron-
esses or Majors or Majors’ wives, on this
trip; or Majors’ wives’ sisters, either.
Your nerves are all shot to pieces.”
“And you are an idiot,” was the amused
reply. “However, I’ll promise not to play
bridge.”

  “It would be just our luck to blunder
onto trouble of some sort,” I went on
morosely. “Jimmie, if anybody robs the
ship’s safe, you are not to interfere. Let
the Major run down the thief, since he’s
such a good man.”

  He laughed again. “All right,” said he,
   10

105

“I’ll go and see him about it now.” And
off he went, to hunt up his erstwhile crony,
the retired Major and man-hunter, whom,
I suspect, he discovered in the smoking-
room (which was also the drinking-room),
for the bar had been open for several
minutes.

  And that is the way it all started, the
memorable voyage of the trans Atlantic
liner, Dianthus, which added laurels to the
reputation of my friend Lavender, and
began his vacation in a manner—from
Lavender’s point of view—highly satisfy-
ing and successful.

  Actually, it was the evening of the sec-
ond day at sea that the first whisper of the
trouble I had predicted reached our ears.
My sardonic prophecy, however, was not
accurate in its detail. The ship’s safe—if
it carried one—remained unmolested.

  The day had been warm enough, but the
evening called for wraps. The promenade
deck was a scene of some activity, what
with the hustling stewards and the eter-
nally tramping Britons, who toiled around
the oval like athletes training on a track.
An Englishman is never happy unless he
is walking or sitting before his fireplace;
and the ship had no fireplaces. The boat
deck, however, was comparatively deserted,
and Lavender and I, wrapped in our rugs,
looked out into the windy darkness and
smoked contentedly. Our nearest com-
panions were a spooning couple some
yards away, half hidden by funnels, and
wrapped in blankets and their own emo-
tions. Major Rittenhouse, a likeable fel-
low, as I had rapidly discovered, had
surrendered at discretion, and was playing
the amiable martyr in the card room.

  An occasional steward drifted past, and
once the second officer of the ship stopped
for a word and a cigarette, but for the
most part we were left to ourselves.

  “Indeed,” said I, “I believe we have the
choice of locations, Lavender.” And at

that instant the Italian baroness hove into
view.

Her name, we had discovered, was
Borsolini—the Baroness Borsolini. She
io6

came forward uncertainly, wavered in
passing, passed on, and in a few moments
came back. She was quite alone, and ob-
viously she wished to speak to us. On the
third trip she had made up her mind, and
came swiftly to our side.

  “You are Mr. Lavender?” she mur-
mured. “I must speak with you. May I
sit down?”

  “Of course.” said my friend, and rose to
his feet to assist her. “Something is wor-
rying you, I fear.”

  “You are right,” said the baroness. “I
am very much afraid.”

  Her English was perfect. Her manner
was pretty and appealing.

  “Something has frightened you?” asked
Lavender encouragingly.

  She bent forward and studied his face
closely in the darkness.

  “You are a good man,” she said at
length. “I can tell. I think you are a
poet.”

  Lavender squirmed and feebly gesticu-
lated. Before he could deny the amazing
charge, she had hurried on.

  “Yes, I am afraid. Last night—after I
had retired—someone was in my cabin!”
“A thief?”

  The words came eagerly from the de-
tective’s lips. In his interest, he forgot
her preposterous notion about his profes-
sion.

  “I think so. But nothing was taken
away. He did not find what he sought.”
Lavender’s interest deepened. “What
did he seek?” he asked.

  “My jewels,” said the baroness.1! “What
else?”

  “They are valuable then?” -V ‘

  “They are very valuable, my friend.
They are valuable because it would cost a
fortune to replace them; but they are price-
less because they are my family jewels.
I speak of replacing them, but believe me,
they could not be replaced.”

  My friend’s cap came off to the breeze.
“Tell me how you know there was some-
one in your cabin,” he said.	'

  “I awoke suddenly—I don’t know why
I awoke. I suppose I felt someone there.
There were little sounds in the room—soft,
brushing sounds—and breathing. Light,
so light, I could scarcely catch it. It was
only for an instant, then the man was gone.
I must have made some little sound my-
,self that alarmed him. As he went, I al-
most saw him—you understand ? He
seemed to glide through the door, which
he had to open to escape. He made no
sound, and what I saw; was just black

against gray as the door opened. I only
half saw him—the other half I felt. You
understand ?”

  “Yes,” said Lavender, “I understand
perfectly. But how can you be sure it was
a man? Probably it was—but are you
sure ?”

  “I think so—that is all. It is my feeling
that tells me it was a man. I can not ex-
plain—but if it had been a woman, I think
I should have known.”

  Lavender nodded. “No doubt you are
Tight,” he said. “Whom have you told of
this, Baroness?”

  “I have told no one but yourselves. You
will advise me whom I should tell ?”

  “You had better tell Mr. Crown, the
purser. He will, if he thinks best, tell the
captain, I suppose, or whoever handles in-
vestigations of this sort. At any rate, Mr.
Crown is the man to whom the first report
should be made. I am sure he will do
whatever is necessary. Probably he will
have his own way of getting at the man
who did this. I would see the purser at
once, Baroness, if I were you.”

  She rose promptly. “Thank you. I am
sure your advice is good. I shall go to Mr.
Crown at once. You are very good.”
“Meanwhile,” said Lavender, “we shall,
of course, say nothing. Good night,
Baroness, and I hope you will not be dis-
turbed again.”

  We rose with her, and watched her as
she tripped away to the companionway.
With a wave of her hand, she descended
the steps and vanished. Lavender shoved
me down into my chair.

  “Stay here, Gilly,” he said. “I’ll be back
shortly.”

  A moment later he, too, had disappeared
in the direction of the lower deck.

  Well, it had come 1 My unthinking pro-
phecy had borne fruit, and Lavender al-
ready was involved. Where would it end ?

I	lay back in my deck chair and earnestly
consigned the baroness and her family
jewels to perdition. It occurred to me that
it had been nothing less than criminal for
her to come on board our ship with the
infernal things. She could just as well
have waited for the Maltania! And Laven-
der might then have been allowed to have
his vacation in peace.

  In ten minutes, the subject of my pater-
nal flutterings was back.

  “She went, all right,” said he laconically.
“I should hope she would,” I retorted.
“Did you think she wouldn’t?”

  “I -wanted to be sure, Gilly,” answered
Lavender kindly. “I’m wondering why

                                                     10

she didn’t go to the purser first; why she
singled me out for her attention; why she
didn’t put her blessed jewels in the pur-
ser’s charge when she came on board—it’s
the thing to do. I’m also wondering how
she knows me. For I’m convinced that,
she does know me, in spite of her assertion
that I was singled out because I look like
a ‘good man.’ I am more than ever con-
vinced that she recognized me when I came
on board. She wanted to speak to me then,
although she had no attempted jewel rob-
bery to report yesterday. Really, it’s all
very interesting.”

  “Yes,” I admitted, “it is. Do you think
there wil be another attempt, Jimmie?”

  “I wouldn’t be surprised,” said he
thoughtfully. “In fact, I would almost bet
on it.”

II

IN THE dining saloon, the next morn-
ing, the company had perceptibly
thinned out, for a stiff breeze and a
choppy sea had sprung up in the night.
At the purser’s table, however, we sat six
strong, as we had begun the voyage.
Crown, the purser, pink complexioned and
almost ridiculously fat, beamed good na-
ture upon his charges, from his seat at the
head of the table. He was in jovial spirits.

  “If there were a prize offered for the
table that showed no desertions,” said he
with a chuckle, “I think we should win.”
Beverley of Toronto, who sat at my
left, growled humorously. “There are sev-
eral days ahead of us,” he significantly ob-
served. “I, for one, do not intend to
crow.”

  Lavender, who had been the last one to
sit down, was looking around the room.
The Major’s wife, thinking him to be look-
ing in her direction, raised her brows and
smiled, and he caught the gesture and
smiled and nodded back. He spoke to the
purser, beside whom he sat.

  “Two of the notables have not mate-
rialized,” he remarked casually. “The
baroness and the clergyman are missing.”
The purser looked startled.

  “Yes,” he answered, “I noticed that.
Murchison is ill, I hear; but I don’t under-
stand the baroness’s absence. She looked
to me like a sailor.”

  He seemed worried for a moment, and
looked back at Lavender as if longing to
confide in him; but the presence of the
others at the table prevented. Lavender
himself, having given the officer the hint
he intended, devoted himself to his break-
10

fast. From time to time, however, during
the progress of the meal, he glanced to-
ward the baroness’s seat at a neighboring
table, as if hoping to see that it had been
occupied during the moments of his inat-
tention. But the breakfast hour passed
away and the object of his solicitude did
not appear. The purser, too, continued to
be worried, although he kept up a lively
flow of conversation.

  Outside the saloon door, the detective
and the ship’s officer paused while the pas-
sengers dispersed.

  “She may be ill, of course,” said the pur-
ser, at length. It was almost humorously
obvious that he would have been relieved
to hear that the baroness was very ill in-
deed.

  “Of course,” agreed Lavender, “but we
had better find out. She told you, I sup-
pose, that she came to me first ?”

  “Yes,” said the purser, “one of my assis-
tants tried to look after her, but she in-
sisted on seeing me. I’m glad she was so
cautious about it. Usually, a woman gets
excited, tells everybody her difficulties, and

then in loud
tones demands
to see the cap-
\ tain. As a
result, the
trouble—what-
ever it is—is
all over the
ship in no time,
and everybody
is nervous. I
suppose I’m a fool, Mr. Lavender; but
somehow I’m nervous now, myself. I hope
there’s no further trouble.”

  “What did you do, last night?”

  “Spoke to the night watchman. He’s
supposed to have had an eye on her cabin
all night. Of course, he couldn’t watch
it every minute, and do the rest of his
work too; but he was ordered to notice it
particularly every time he passed, and to
hang around a bit each time. I fancy he
did it; he’s a good man.”

  “And the baroness herself ?”

  “Refused, in spite of all my persuasion,
to place her jewels in charge of my office.
Of course, in the circumstances, if any-
thing does happen to them, it’s her own
lookout. Just the same, that sort of thing,
if it gets out, gives a ship a black eye, so to
speak.”

  “Well,” said Lavender, “we’d better
have a look at her cabin. Nobody seems
to be interested in our movements. Come
on, Gilly!” He started up the stairs to
io8

SHORT STORIES

the cabin deck. “Who is her stewardess,
Purser ?”

  “Mrs. King, a nice old soul. I spoke to
her too, but all I said was that the baroness
was nervous, and to do what she could for
her. We’ll see Mrs. King at once.”

  He sighed and rolled heavily away, and
we followed closely at his heels, down the
corridors of the lurching vessel to the
stewardesses’ sitting room. Mrs. King,
however, had nothing to tell us.

  “She didn’t call,” said the woman, “and
I didn’t go near her.”

  “She wasn’t down to breakfast this
morning,” explained the purser, “and we
thought perhaps she was ill. You haven’t
been to her cabin yet, this morning?”

  “No, sir,” replied Mrs. King, “having
had the lady’s own orders not to wake her
if'she didn’t choose to get up.”

  “I see. Well, you must go to her now,
and see if she needs you. She may be ill,
or she may just have missed the breakfast
gong and be sleeping. Give her my com-
pliments, and say that I was inquiring for
her.”

  The woman seemed reluctant, and hung
back for a moment; then she moved slowly
off to the door of the cabin numbered
13.12, where she paused uncertainly.

  “All right,” said the purser impatiently,
“knock, and then go in!”

  Mrs. King timidly knocked, and again
stopped as if in apprehension.

  “What’s the matter?” asked Lavender,
in his friendliest tones, seeing that the
woman was frightened.

  The ship lurched heavily, lay over for
a long moment, and came up again. We
all braced our legs and clung to the nearest
woodwork.

  “She doesn’t—answer,” said the matron
faintly.

  “Open the door!” ordered the purser.

  Thus adjured, Mrs. King turned the
handle, and with a terrific effort put her
head inside the door. In an instant the head
was withdrawn. The woman’s face was
pale and scared. The purser looked angry.
Lavender, however, knew what had hap-
pened. With a quick frown, he pushed
past the motionless woman and entered
the little cabin, the purser and I at his
heels. We filled the place.

  There was no particular disorder. The
port stood half open, as it had stood
through the night, to allow ventilation.
On the upholstered wall bench stood the
baroness’ bags. Her trunk half projected
from beneath the bunk. The curtains blew
gently with a soft, swishing sound.

  Even in the bunk itself there was small
disorder. Yet beneath the white cover-
ings, with tossed hair and distorted fea-
tures, the Baroness Borsolini lay dead.

  For an instant, we all stood in silence.
Then, from the corridor without, sounded
the frightened whimper of Mrs. King, the
stewardess. Lavender beckoned her in-
side, and she docilely obeyed.

  “Stay here until we have finished,” he
quietly ordered.

  “Good God!” said Crown, the purser, in
awed dismay. Then he continued to stare,
without speech, at the bed.

  Lavender bent over the silent figure of
the woman who, only the night before, had
whispered her trouble to him.

  “Strangled,” he murmured softly.
“Killed without a sound.”

  “Good God!” said the purser again.

  Once more the stewardess’ scared
whimper sounded.

  “Don’t, please,” said my friend, gently.
To me, he said, “Gilly, can you say how
long she has been dead?”

  Anticipating the question, I had been
examining the body, although without
touching it. Now I stepped forward for
a closer examination.

  “Six or seven hours, at least,” I said at
length. “The ship’s doctor—Brown—will
tell you better than I.”

  “We’d better have him in,” said Laven-
der, “although you are probably right.
Excuse me, Mr. Crown,” he added. “I
don’t mean to usurp your position in this
matter.”

  The purser shuddered. “Go ahead,” he
said. “I’ll be glad to do whatever you
suggest.”

  “Then get the doctor here, quietly, and
ask Rittenhouse if he cares to come down.
What else there is to do, you will know
better than I—that is, I suppose you will
have to report to the captain, or something
of the sort. You’d better take Mrs. King
out of this, too, Crown. I’d like to talk
to her a little later, though.”

  He looked keenly at the frightened,
shaking woman, but his touch on her arm
as he uttered his last words was gentle.
I knew that he was wondering about her
hesitation before opening the door. I, too,
had been wondering. Was it merely a
woman’s uncanny prescience, or some-
thing more significant?

  When the purser and the matron had
gone away, he turned to me.

  “A queer, unhappy case, Gilly,” he
quietly remarked. “Do you sense it ? The
beginning, if I am not mistaken, of some-
THE MID-WATCH TRAGEDY

109

thing very curious indeed.”

  Without further words, he turned from
the bed and began a swift search of the
cabin. His nimble fingers flew as he
worked, and under his touch the posses-
sions of the murdered baroness came to
view and disappeared again with skillful
method. Apparently he found nothing to
guide him.

  When he had finished, he said, “The
question is, of course: did he, or she, or
they—whichever may have been the case
—find what they were looking for?”

  “The jewels are gone?” I asked. “You
don’t find them?”

  “They are not here,” he replied, “unless
they are very cleverly hidden. The second

question we are
bound to consider,
Gilly, is: were
there any jewels ?”
That startled
me. He answered
my surprised
glance.

  “We have no proof that she ever had
any jewels. She was vague enough about
them, when she spoke to us—vague about
their value—and she refused to deposit
them with the purser, which was her
proper course. We have only her word
for it that she possessed the jewels, and
that she carried them with her. None the
less,” he added firmly, “she may have had
them, and they may have been stolen.
Certainly she was not murdered as a mat-
ter of whim.”

  “I think you suspect something that you
are not mentioning, Jimmie,” I remarked,
with another glance at the dead woman.

  He followed the glance. “Yes,” he re-
plied, “you are right. I believe this all
began somewhere on shore. Almost the
most important thing to be done, is to es-
tablish the identity of this woman.”

  “You doubt that she is—?”

  “The Baroness Borsolini ? Well, yes
and no. She may have been just what she
claimed to be, and yet nobody in particular.
Baroness, in Italy, means nothing of im-
portance. The last Italian baron I knew
was floor-walker in a Chicago department
store. And, of course, she may not have
been a baroness at all. My doubt of the
poor woman, I will admit, goes back to the
fact that she seemed to know me. How-
ever, if we are fortunate, we shall know
all about her before long.”

  Again I looked a question.

  “Last night,” said he, “I sent a wireless,
in code, to Inspector Gallery, in New
10

York. I was curious about the baroness
and her tale, and suspecting further trou-
ble, I tried to anticipate some of our diffi-
culties.”

  “You anticipated—this?”

  “No,” he flared quickly. “Not this, by
Heaven! If I had, Gilly, I’d have stood
guard myself all night long. I anticipated
another attempt on the jewels,” he added
in lower tones. “Another attempt on what-
ever it is this woman had that her mur-
derer wanted. We must have a talk with
that night watchman, too, before long. I
wonder who occupied the cabin across the
way ?”

  “We can soon discover that,” said I; and
at that moment the purser came back with
the doctor.

  Brown, a fussy little man with a beard
the color of his name, had heard the story
from the purser, and was prepared for
what he saw. He conducted a swift and
skillful examination that proved his ability,
and verified my statement as to the time
the woman had been dead.

  “Let us assume seven hours, then,” said
Lavender. “That would fix the murder at
about two in the morning—^possibly a little
earlier, possibly a little later. Where the
devil would the watchman have been at
that hour? No doubt he had just passed
on, for certainly the murderer would have
been watching for him. By the way,
Crown, who occupies B.14?”

  The baroness’ cabin was at the corner
of an intersecting passage, and its entrance
was off the smaller corridor. B.14 oc-
cupied the corresponding position across
the pasage, and was the opposite cabin to
which Lavender had referred.

  “I’ll find out for you,” answered the
purser; but the doctor replied to the ques-
tion.

  “A clergyman,” he said. “Murchison,
of some place in Iowa. He’s ill. He had
me in, last night.”

  “Last night?” echoed my friend.

  “Yes,” said the doctor, “and it can’t
have been very long before—before this
happened! About one o’clock, I think.
It’s not nice to think that this may even
have been going on, while I was just across
the way.”

  “How is he?”

  “Oh, he’s sick enough, but it’s the usual
thing. It was new to him, though, and I
suppose he thought he was going to die.
The poor chap is pretty low.”

  “He may have heard something, if he
was awake,” suggested Lavender. “Can
he be questioned?”
SHORT STORIES

  “Oh, yes, but I doubt if he heard any-
thing but his own groans. Somebody’s
with him now, I heard talking as I came
by.”

  “I told Major Rittenhouse,” volun-
teered the purser. “He said he’d be right
down. He ought to have been here by this
time.”

  “We’d better go to my stateroom,” said
Lavender. “There’s nothing further to be
learned here, I think. I shall want to talk
with the night watchman, Purser, when
I can get to him. I suppose he’s asleep
now. Doctor Brown, would you care to
speak to your patient across the way ? Ask
him if he heard anything in the night, you
know; and press the point. Any trifle may
be important.”

  The door opened and the tall figure of
Major Rittenhouse entered softly. He
closed the door quietly behind him.

  “I heard the last question,” he remarked,
then glanced at the bed. For just an in-
stant, his eyes rested on the dead woman,
then without emotion he continued. “I’ve
already questioned Mr. Murchison, Laven-
der. It occurred to me as a good idea to
look up the nearest neighbor. In a case
like this, time is of considerable impor-
jtance. Murchison was awake most of the
night, and had the doctor in, once. About
four o’clock he got up and staggered
around his room a bit, then opened his
door. He saw someone leaving this cabin,
and supposed the baroness to be ill, too,
for he thought no more about it.”

  “Four o’clock!” cried Lavender. “And
if he thought the baroness was ill, he must

have seen-”

  “Mrs. King!” gasped the purser, with
jnew horror in his voice.

  “I don’t know her name, and neither did
Murchison,” said Rittenhouse; “but the
woman he saw was one of the steward-
esses.”

Ill

RAIN fell heavily throughout the
afternoon, filling the smoke-rooms
. and lounges of the floating hotel
with animated conversation; but in Laven-
der’s stateroom, as the great liner shoul-
dered through the squall, a grimmer
conversation went forward, unknown to
the hundreds of our fellow passengers. It
was feared that, soon enough, the ill tid-
ings of death would spread through the
ship, and throw a blight over the happy
voyagers. Meanwhile, the task of appre-
hending the murderer of the unfortunate
baroness had to move swiftly. It is prob-

able that no shipboard mystery ever
occurred more fortuitously; that is to say,
with two more admirable detectives than
Lavender and Rittenhouse actually on
board to handle the investigation; but it
is equally probable that no more mysteri-
ous affair ever engaged the talents of either
investigator. We were a little world of
our own, isolated from the rest of civili-
zation by hundreds of miles of salt water;
our inhabitants were comparatively few in
number, and there was no opportunity
whatever of escape. Somewhere in our

midst actually
moved and ate
and slept a man
or a woman
guilty of a
hideous crime
of violence; yet
not a single
clew appa-
rently existed
to the identity
of that indi-
vidual, unless Murchison’s testimony had
supplied it.

   Mrs. King, the stewardess, was reluctant
to an extraordinary degree, when for the
second time she was questioned about her
murdered charge. At first, she denied
pointblank any knowledge of the events
of the night, then, as Lavender continued
to probe, she burst into a storm of hyste-
rical weeping. Confronted with the pur-
port of the clergyman’s information, she
made a statement that only added mystery
to the case.

  “I did go in there at four o’clock,” she
said tearfully, addressing the purser, “and,
so help me God, Mr. Crown, she was al-
ready dead!"

  The purser’s anstonished glance went
round the cabin and settled on my friend;
but Lavender only nodded.

  “That is what you should have told us
at once,” he said. “You were afraid of
compromising yourself, but you only com-
promised yourself more deeply by keeping
silent. You see, Rit,” he continued, turn-
ing to the Major, “the time element re-
mains unconfused. The murder occurred
at about two o’clock, as the body indicated.
Now, Mrs. King, let us have no more
evasions and no more denials. If you stick
to the truth, no harm will come to you that
you don’t deserve. Tell us exactly why
you went to the baroness’ cabin at four
o’clock in the morning.”

  “She—she called me!” whispered the
woman, in a voice so low that we caught

10
THE MID-WATCH TRAGEDY

hi

the words only with difficulty.

  “That, of course, is nonsense,” said
Lavender, severely; but Major Ritten-
house had caught a glimpse of the truth.

  “You mean that the call board showed
a call from her room,” he interrupted.
“But you didn’t hear the bell ring, did
you ?”

  The woman shook her head.

  “She was probably asleep, Jimmie,” con-
tinued the Major. “She didn’t hear the
bell, but when she awoke, some hours after
it had rung, the board showed the baron-
ess’ number up. She answered—and
found the body!”

  “Is that what happened?” demanded
Lavender of the woman.

  Again Mrs. King responded with a ges-
ture of the head, this time affirmative. The
purser was angry.

  “You are the night stewardess,” he cried.
“You have no right to be asleep.”
“Nevertheless,” said Lavender, “she
was asleep. It doesn’t help matters now
to scold her. What happened, is this: the
murderer entered the cabin about two
o’clock, and the baroness woke—possibly
she had not been asleep. She heard the
intruder, and sat up. Before she could
scream, his hands were at her throat.
There was a struggle, sharp but brief, and
somehow the victim managed to reach and
touch the call button. The ringing of the
bell in the passage alarmed the murderer
and he fled. Mrs. King was asleep and
did not get the call. Two hours later, she
awoke, saw that a call had come from the
baroness’ cabin, and responded. Mur-
chison, across the way, opened his door
and saw her leaving the room. A pity he
didn’t open his door at two o’clock!”
Rittenhouse nodded and took up the quiz.
“You saw nothing in the room when
you entered?” he asked. “Nothing that
would give you an idea as to who did this
thing ?”

  “No,” answered the woman faintly.
  “Was there a light in the room?”

  She shook her head.

  “Then how did you know the baroness
was dead?”

  “I—I turned on the light.”

  “Why did you turn on the light?”

  “She had called me,” answered the
woman, somewhat defiantly. “I spoke
when I went in, and she didn’t answer.
I thought maybe she had got up and gone
out—I thought maybe she was ill. So I
turned on the light, and then I saw—I saw
her!”

  Rittenhouse nodded again.

   10

  “And then you turned out the light, and
went away?” Lavender finished. “Why
didn’t you tell somebody what had hap-
pened ?”

  “I was afraid,” said Mrs. King simply.
“I was afraid they would think I had
done it.”

  “Hm-m!” said Lavender. He looked at
the Major, who shrugged his shoulders.

  “I guess that’s all, Purser,” said Laven-
der, at length. “Let’s have the night
watchman in.”

  But John Dover, the night watchman,
an ex-sergeant of the British army, could
tell nothing. His story was straightfor-
ward enough.

  “Yes, sir,” said he frankly, “Hi passed
that room many times, sir. There was no
trouble that Hi could see, sir, hat any time.
Hif there ’ad been, Hi’d ’ave looked into
it. There was no light in the room, sir,
hat any time.”

  This, after an hour’s questioning, was
still his story.

  “It’s probably quite true, too,” observed
Lavender, when the man had been cau-
tioned to keep his mouth shut, and had
been dismissed. “The murderer wouldn’t
be fool enough to attract the watchman.
Well, Rit, where are we?”

  “Just about where we began, Jimmie, I
should say,” answered the Major.

  “You believe the stewardess’ story?”
asked the purser dubiously.

  “There’s no earthly reason to disbelieve
it, as yet,” frankly responded Lavender.
“She could have done it, I suppose, but
so could a dozen others. Extraordinary
as her statement is, it has many of the ear-
marks of truth. I believe she did exactly
what eight out of ten women would have
done in the circumstances. We can’t leave
her out of our calculations, of course, but
certainly we must allow her to believe that
we accept her story in toto. In point of
fact, I do accept it.”

  It was not long after these developments
that tidings of the death of the Baroness
Borsolini were all over the ship. Exactly
how the news was started, nobody knew,
for everybody with direct knowledge had
been sworn to secrecy. It is a difficult
thing, however, to hush up as serious a
matter as murder, particularly on ship-
board; and no doubt the leak could have
been traced to the night watchman or Mrs.
King, or the clergyman of the ship’s doc-
tor, or possibly even to the Major’s wife
or her sister. It is not the sort of knowl-
edge one human being can possess without
telling to another.
112

SHORT STORIES

  The purser, Crown, was deeply annoyed,
for he was worried about the good name
of the ship; but Lavender only grunted
and said it could not be helped. As a mat-
ter of strict accuracy, it was the very reve-
lation of the murder that brought us one
of our strongest and strangest clews. It
brought to Lavender’s stateroom, the Hon.
Arthur Russell, of Beddington, Herts.,
England, son of that Lord Denbigh whose
name I had discovered on the ship’s pas-
senger list.

  All over the ship the rumor of tragedy
flew, once it had started, and the passen-
gers gathered in groups to discuss the

fearsome occurrence. In the smoking-
rooms, the male passengers bragged and
told each other what they would do to
apprehend the murderer, and in the
lounges the women twittered and hissed
like the gaudy birds of passage that they
were. Many were frankly alarmed at the
thought that the assassin was still at large,
walking among them. They stated their
fears audibly, and the purser was stormed
by brigades of them, seeking information
and assurances of safety.

  “We may all be murdered in our beds,”
said they, in effect, so vehemently and in
such numbers that Crown probably wished
in his heart that many of them would be.

  “Idiots!” said Lavender to me in pri-
vacy after the harassed purser had told him
what was going on. “They are, if any-
thing, safer than before. The murder of
the baroness was not a result of blood-lust,
nor the beginning of wholesale assassina-
tion. The selected victim has been killed,
and for the murderer the episode is over.
Quite the last thing he would do, unless
he is crazy, is kill someone else. What he
wants to do now is keep himself a secret,
not to advertise himself by further crime.
People are funny, Gilly; they don’t think.
Most murderers are really very safe men
to be near, after they have committed their
murder. They have it out of their system;
their hate or their vengeance has been sat-
isfied ; the one who stood in their path has
been removed, and in all probability they

will never again commit that crime. The
way to stop murder—philosophically
speaking—is not to lock up or kill mur-
derers, but to prevent the accomplishment
of crime, or even the desire to kill, by
scientific, educational -methods. This, how-
ever,” he added, with a smile and a shrug,
“is not a doctrine that I often preach, and
never in public. It would land me in the
insane asylum!”

  I was inclined to agree with his last
assertion; but Lavender is a queer fellow,
and his philosophy, as he states it, is very
plausible. I merely smiled politely, and
at his suggestion rang the bell and asked
that our tardy luncheon be sent to the
stateroom. As it happened, the Hon.
Arthur Russell came in with the tray—that
is, he was hard on the heels of the waiter
who bore it, and he apologized profusely
for interrupting. He was a mannerly young
Briton, handsome and likeable, and we
asked him to sit down and have a cup of
tea.

  I supposed him to be spokesman for his
father, or for some group of the passen-
gers, but his mission, it developed, was
quite a different one. He was not seeking
information; he had it to impart.

  “I say, Mr. Lavender,” he began, “is it
all true, this that I hear ? That the Baron-
ess Borsolini is dead?”

  “Yes,” replied my friend, “quite true.
She was found dead in her berth, this
morning.”

  “And that she was—” he boggled over
the word “murdered,” and substituted an-
other one—“that she was killed?”

  “Yes,” said Lavender again. “There is
not a doubt in the world that she was mur-
dered, Mr. Russell.”

  “Good Lord!” said the boy. He drew a
long breath. “That’s what everybody is
saying. I couldn’t believe it!”

 “Why?”

  “Because—well, I couldn’t, that’s all!
It seemed too horrible. Why, only last
night, sir, she was with me on deck—full
of life—and happy—why, I may have been
the last person to see her alive!” he fin-
ished.

  “The individual who killed her was the
last person to see her alive,” said Laven-
der coolly.

  “Of course!” cried the boy. “I didn’t
think of that. Say, that’s clever!”

  Lavender smiled a little, not displeased
by the boy’s quick admiration.

  “I think perhaps you have something to
tell us, Mr. Russell,” continued my friend.
“Don’t hesitate, if you have. Any infor-

                                                        10

mation is very welcome.”

  The Hon, Arthur Russell gulped his tea,
suddenly and convulsively, then put it
aside.

  “Well, I have!” said he. “Not much—•
but I’ve got her address!”

  “Her address?”

  “Yes, sir. She gave it to me last night.
You see, we had struck up, an acquain-
tance, and we liked each other. We sat
out on deck and talked, pretty late. I told
her about my school life, and she told me
a lot about America; and when we were
parting, I said I’d like to write to her.
So she gave me her address. Wrote it on
a piece of paper and gave it to me. Here
it is!”

  With something of the air of a conjurer,
he produced the paper. His youthful face
was alight with the excitement of his news,
which he believed to be of the highest im-
portance. He could have been no more
than twenty, while the baroness had been
all of thirty-five, although pretty enough.
Apparently, the boy had been greatly smit-
ten. It was rather amusing, and rather
pitiful.

  As he spoke, he handed Lavender the
scrap of paper that he had taken from his

pocket.

  “That’s it,” he concluded. “Florence,
Italy. The Hotel Caravan. That’s her
writing, sir!”

  Lavender rose to his feet and carried
the paper to the light. The boy too rose,
and followed him. The interest of both
was profound, although for the life of me
I could see no reason for excitement in the
discovery of the dead woman’s address.

  “Interesting,” commented my friend, at
length. “Very interesting indeed! And,
if I’m not mistaken, very important, too.
I’m really very much obliged to you, Mr.
Russell.”

  “I’m glad if it’s a help,” said the boy,
flushing. His eyes sparkled. “I’d like to
think that I had—” Suddenly he broke
off, and his eyes bulged. “Why,” he cried,
“you’re looking at the wrong side!”

  “No,” said Lavender, with a little smile,
“this is the right side. I saw the other
side too, and it’s interesting also—particu-
larly as there is no Hotel Caravan in Flo-
rence, that I ever heard of. But it is the
reverse that interests me most. You say
that she took this paper out of her bag?”

  “I didn’t say so,” answered the boy ac-
curately, “but as a matter of fact, she did.
Tore it off a large piece, and wrote on it.
That’s her handwriting!”

  He was still stupefied by Lavender’s
  10

curious action, and still certain that in a
veritable specimen of the baroness’s hand-
writing he had furnished us with a sensa-
tional clue. But Lavender continued to
study the reverse of the fragment. At
length, he handed it to me.

  “What do you make of it, Gilly?” he
asked.

  I looked, and saw nothing but a frag-
ment of what apparently had been a
printed form of some kind, for there were
upon it several words in small print, and
a perforated upper edge. The words were
quite meaningless, removed from their
context. Above the small print, however,
was the one word “line” in larger type.

  “A ship’s form of some kind?” I haz-
arded. “Torn from a book of similar
forms ?”

  “Exactly,” agreed Lavender. “The word
‘Line,’ of course, is the last word of ‘Rod-
gers Line.’ The rest, at the moment,
means nothing. If we had the whole form,
it might be very illuminating.”

  There was a tap on the door, and a mo-
ment later Major Rittenhouse entered the
stateroom.

  “Jimmie,” said the newcomer, “there’s
a message coming in for you, upstairs.

One of the
wireless boys
just told me,
and asked me
to let you
know. What’ve
you got ? Some-
thing new ?”
“Yes,” said
Lavender.
"What do you think of it, Rit?”

  Rittenhouse turned the paper over in
his fingers, and at the baroness’ written
name and address, he blinked.

  “We are indebted to Mr. Russell for it,”
explained Lavender, and repeated the
young Briton’s story. “But what do you
make of the other side, Rit?”

  After some cogitation, the Major made
of it exactly what I had made.

  “Well,” said Lavender, with a sigh, “I
may be wrong; but I thought I saw more
than that.” His eyes narrowed. “I’ll tell
you what, Rit,” he added suddenly, “take
it to your wife, or her sister, and ask
either one what it is. I’ll gamble that one
of them will tell you.”

  The Major appeared surprised.

  “Are you joking, Lavender?” His tone
was a bit indignant.

  “Not a bit of it. I’m intensely serious.
Will you do it?”
114

SHORT STORIES

  “Yes,” said Rittenhouse. “I’ll do any-
thing you say, Jimmie; but I’m damned
if I know what my wife has to do with
this thing!”

  “Meanwhile,” continued Lavender, “let’s
see what New York has to report on the
Baroness Borsolini. I’ve a feeling that
another revelation is at hand.”

  “May I come?” asked Arthur Russell
eagerly.

  “If you like,” smiled Lavender, “but I’ll
be right back. Better stay here, all of you.
We don’t want to parade about the ship
in groups, and start a new set of rumors.”
He hurried away, and we sat back in
our seats and impatiently awaited his re-
turn. In a few minutes he was back, with
a small square of paper folded in his palm.

  “Another interesting document,” he ob-
served. “This is Inspector Gallery’s reply
to my request for information concerning
the baroness. It is in code, but I have
translated it. Bear in mind, Rit, that he
didn’t know when he wired that the baron-
ess was dead.”

  He began to read the message.
“Baroness Borolini probably Kitty Des-
mond, well known adventuress and inter-
national character. If she has a small mole

at left corner of mouth it is-”

  “She has!” interrupted Arthur Russell,
in high excitement.

  “Yes,” said Lavender, “she has.” He
continued to read: “—it is almost cer-
tain. Jewels probably famous Schuyler
jewels, worth half million, stolen here two
months ago. Have cabled Scotland Yard
to meet you at Quarantine. Gallery.”

IV

  AT THE purser’s table that evening,
f\ the murder of the Baroness Bor-
A JL solini was the sole topic of conver-
sation. We still sat six strong. Besides
Lavender and I and the purser, there were
Beverley of Toronto, Dudgeon of New
York, and Isaacson of St. Louis. The
latter three were acquainted with all the
rumors, and they questioned Lavender and
the purser diligently. That Lavender was
.a famous detective, and had been placed
in charge of the case, was a piece of news
that had circulated with the rest of the re-
ports. Our fellow passengers at table felt
themselves very fortunate indeed, to be so
fortuitously placed with reference to the
fountain-heads of information, and I fancy
they were vastly envied by passengers at
the other tables. Throughout the meal,
heads were turned constantly in our direc-
tion.

  The rotund Crown, who, by virtue of his
office, had been harassed even more than
had Lavender, was inclined to be reticent
and a bit short. Lavender merely smiled
coldly, and replied with scrupulous ac-
curacy to all questions leveled at him. The
facts, he admitted without reserve, but he
declined to indulge in speculation.

  “It is obviously a case of a falling out
of crooks,” he concluded. “I have re-
ceived a wireless message from New York,
which positively identifies the baroness as
a well 'known and, if you like the term, a
high class crook. The stolen jewels, if
they have been stolen—and apparently they
have been—are said to have originally dis-
appeared in New York, some two months
ago. I have no doubt that the baroness
was on her way to Europe with them, and
that the division of spoils was to be made
there. Possibly she was to sell them. Her
accomplices in the original theft, I should
imagine, are for the most part on the way
to Europe on other vessels. One, how-
ever, it would seem—or, any rate, some-
body who knows the truth about the jewels
—is on board this vessel. There is no
cause for alarm. The decent passengers
are quite safe.”

  “She would have had to smuggle them
in, wouldn’t she?” asked Beverley of To-
ronto. The remark was more of a state-
ment than a question.

  “Yes,” replied Lavender, “but that plan
was probably worked out to the last
comma. Smuggling offers no great diffi-
culties to a clever person.”

  At the close of the meal, we were sur-
rounded by interested questioners; but not
even the wiles of Betty Cosgrave, the
screen star, could shake Lavender’s re-
serve. We heartlessly left the purser to
answer all interviewers, and hurried on
deck. On the way up, we passed the cap-
tain, a pleasant faced Englishman some-
what past middle life. He had something
on his mind.

 “Er—Mr. Lavender,” he observed.
“Mr. Crown has been keeping me in-
formed, of course, of this extraordinary
business. Nasty—very nasty indeed! Sin-
ister! Mr. Crown, of course, acts for me
and for the company. I have no wish to
interfere with what is in better hands than
my own; but you will understand that I
am deeply affected by it all. May I ask
whether you anticipate a—a successful
conclusion?”

  “Entirely successful, Captain Rogers,”
replied Lavender seriously. ‘It is the sort
of case the very simplicity of which makes

                                                        10

it difficult; but I believe it is yielding to
treatment. I believe, quite honestly, that
before long I shall be able to present you
with the murderer of the Baroness Bor-
solini, and to turn over the stolen jewels.”
“Thank you,” said the captain with a
nod. “I have every confidence in you. And
in Major Rittenhouse, too. Crown tells
me you are both quite famous men in your
field. I am sorry I could not have you at
my table. If I can be of service, please
command me.”

  We finished our journey to the boat
deck, without further interruption, and
found our long unused deck chairs await-
ing us. The night had cleared, but a cold
breeze was blowing over the sea, and we
wrapped ourselves in rugs to our chins.

  “You seem pretty confident of success,
Jimmie,” I ventured, when our pipes were
going strongly, and the moment seemed
propitious.

  “I am confident,” said he. “It is beyond
credence that this fellow can escape. I am
working privately on an idea of my own
that, I confess, may not work out; but it
looks promising. Frankly, Gilly, it has to
do with that fragment of paper that the
baroness gave young Russell; but that is
all I dare say about it, at present. And I
will ask you to keep that much a secret.
What I want, of course, is the other piece
of the paper—the larger piece.”

  “Did Mrs. Rittenhouse identify it?” I
asked curiously.

  “She did,” replied my friend, almost
grimly. “She identified it in a moment,
because both she and her sister have papers
exactly like it. Rit is working with me in
this, and I may hear from him at any min-
ute. He is less of a figure than I, in this
thing, and can snoop about with less at-
tention.”

  We sat in silence for a few moments,
listening to the throb of the ship’s great

engines, and
the rush of
water beyond
the white line
of the rail.
Then I spoke
again.

  “Gallery was
a bit previous,
wasn’t he, Jim-
mie, in cabling
Scotland Yard
to help you?”

  “No, it was all right,” replied my friend,
with a little smile. “Don’t be jealous,
Gilly. I know exactly why Gallery did
10

that. He thought that I might, at the last
moment, feel some embarrassment in using
the wireless; that is, that I might find my-
self in a position where I could not use
it without betraying my suspicions, what-
ever they might be, to the person sus-
pected. He anticipates that my use of the
ship’s wireless, if my actions are being
watched—and, rest assured, they are being
watched—may alarm the murderer. It
was a piece of clear thinking on Gallery’s
part, a resourceful man’s safeguard against
chance or probability.”

  I nodded, and again we sat without
speech, until a step sounded along the
boards, and the tall figure of the Major
hove in view. Rittenhouse seated himself
without a word beyond a greeting, and for
a few moments we all smoked in silence.
I’m prepared to accept it.”

  “Murchison is still ill,” he said, “but he’s
coming around. I’ve seen him again. He
has nothing to add to his first statement.
He saw no one but the stewardess last
night; he is willing to swear to that. I’ve
had another whirl at Dover, the watchman,
too. He now remembers seeing the doc-
tor leave Murchison’s cabin. The incident
made no impression on him, and he didn’t
think of it before; it was just a part of
routine to him, to see Brown in attendance
somewhere or other. All in all, Jimmie,
there is no escaping your conclusion, and
I’m prepared to accept it.”

  “Yes,” replied Lavender, “it’s pretty
certain; but the fellow must be made to
betray himself. We haven’t enough to go
on, as it is. It’s dangerously near being
guess-work. You asked Crown about the
baroness’ papers?”

  “I did. He has them in safe keeping.
Not a thing in them, he says, that gives us
a clue.”

  Lavender smiled. “There wouldn’t be,”
he rejoined laconically. “Anyway, I’ve
been through them twice, myself.”

  “However, I told him of the fragment
of paper Russell gave you,” continued Rit-
tenhouse. “It startled him.”

  “When are you going to tell me?” I de-
manded, at this juncture. “Where do I
come in, Jimmie? Can I do nothing?”
Lavender turned to me very seriously.
"The fact is, Gilly,” he said, “you will be
a much better witness in all that is to fol-
low, if you know nothing for a while. You
can do one thing, though, you can keep an
eye on me! I mean it. The fat is in the
fire, if I’m not mistaken, and from now on,
I shall be a marked man. I shall go calmly
about my business, as if all were well, and
ii6

it is up to you and Rit to see that I don’t
get a knife in my back, or something
equally unpleasant. Rit and I know the
murderer. The question is: does he know
that we know? I don’t think he suspects
Rit; but he may suspect me. And the more
innocent you appear, Gilly, the better it
will be all around. But keep your eyes
open.”

  “All right, Jimmie,” I replied obediently.
But I was horrified by the turn the case
was taking, and for a long time I sat and
thought deeply, while the two curious fel-
lows who were with me actually sat and
talked about baseball.

  Who, by any chance, could have com-
mitted the crime? Who had the oppor-
tunity? I faced the problem squarely, and
admitted that there were plenty of persons
who could have done it. In addition to the
great numbers of obscure passengers, first
and second class, who had not even been
named in the inquiry, there were undoubt-
edly half a dozen principals who might
very well be definite suspects. The second
class outfit, I was inclined to disregard, for
a second class passenger surely would have
been noticed by one of the stewards, if he
trespassed on holy ground. And yet, as I
came to think of it, was there so much
difference between a first and a second
class passenger? Actually, I was forced
to admit, there was none, so far as appear-
ance was concerned. Of the principal
figures, however, five at least, as I now
numbered them, stood forth clearly as pos-
sibilities. All had been, or could have been,
near the scene of the .murder at the time
it occurred. And with something of a
thrill, I realized that I must add young
Russell to the list. I did not for a moment
suspect him, but for that matter I hardly
suspected any of the others.

  And Lavender was in actual, active dan-
ger of one of them! Clearly, there was
only one thing for me to do, and that was
to watch everybody. I resolved to watch
the entire ship from the captain down, not
excluding Rittenhouse himself. Since I
was to be Lavender’s guardian, by Heaven,
I would suspect everybody!

  In this frame of mind, I went to bed and
dreamed a mad, fantastic dream in which
the captain of the liner, which curiously
had become a pirate ship, stole into Laven-
der’s stateroom and stabbed him with a
fragment of paper, while the Baroness
Borsolini joined hands with Rittenhouse
and danced around them. Waking with
a start, I sat up and listened. Finally, I
knocked three times on the wall of my

cabin, and listened again. After a pause,
there came back to me Lavender’s reply,
in similar code. And after this perfor-
mance, I turned over and managed to get
to sleep.

  The morning of the fourth day broke
clear and fair and cold. I went at once to
Lavender’s room, to find him already up
and gone. He did not appear until break-
fast, and I had no opportunity to ask him
where he had been; but it occurred to me
that he was not playing fair. If I was to
guard him against assassination, he ought
at least to keep me posted as to his move-
ments. So I thought.

  Breakfast passed with the usual chatter
about the uppermost subject in everybody’s
mind, and at a table not far removed from
ours sat Murchison, the Iowa clergyman,
eating his first meal in the saloon. He
looked pale and thin, but happy to be on
earth and able to eat. Later, I saw him in
conversation with the purser, and still later
with the captain. Was he, then, the heart
of the mystery, and were the coils begin-
ning to tighten ?

  Lavender too had a brief talk with the
captain, after which they vanished in com-
pany, while Rittenhouse and the purser
talked in low tones at the door of the lat-
ter’s office. Obviously, something was
afoot, and I felt strangely out in the cold.
Then Mrs. Rittenhouse, and her sister,
Miss Renshaw, corralled me, and for an
hour I was forced to sing the praises of
my friend Lavender to their admiring ac-
companiment.

  After this, however, the suppressed ex-
citement seemed to loosen up, and for an
entire day the routine of ship life went '
quietly forward with only casual mention

of the crime.
Some g a y e t y
was even ap-
parent in the
lounges and
smoking - rooms,
and I reflected
sardonically o n
the adaptability
and the callous-
ness of human
nature. The fifth
day would be the
last on board,
for the sixth
morning would
bring us into port. It was this knowledge,

I suppose, that cheered the passengers, al-
though the Lord knew that the voyage had
been anything but boresome.

THE MID-WATCH TRAGEDY

117

  When I asked Lavender what progress
had been made, he answered merely that
he was “waiting.”

  On the fifth morning, I suddenly re-
membered that the day was the anniver-
sary of my birth—not a particularly sig-
nificant occasion, Heaven knows, but at
least a subject for trivial conversation.
Lavender, however, greeted the tidings
with singular enthusiasm, and promptly
ordered a splendid dinner for the evening;
Rittenhouse ordered wine during the after-
noon, to drink my health, and Mrs. Ritten-
house and her sister embarrassed me im-
mensely by presenting me, with ridiculous
speeches, with tiny bottles of perfume and
post-shaving lotion, purchased of the ship’s
barber. The dinner went off with gusto,
with everybody ordering champagne and
making idiotic addresses, to which I lamely
responded. My humble birthday, indeed,
was made an occasion for strained nerves
to relax and for worried men to forget
their problems. To cap the climax, when
I went to my cabin in the evening, there
was a gorgeously wrapped and tied box
of cigars and cigarettes, with the captain’s
card attached to it, and a huge box of can-
dies, with the purser’s compliments sim-
ilarly presented. I felt excessively guilty
about these latter gifts, feeling as I did
tliat they were intended to show apprecia-
tion of Lavender’s services. Lavender,
however, only laughed and was pleased
that my birthday should have passed off
so well.

  “Any occasion is good for a celebration,
at sea,” he observed.

  Late in the afternoon, we had dropped
anchor in the outer harbor of Cherbourg,
while a tender took off our passengers for
Paris. Then, with a fresh breeze, we had
headed for England and the end of the
voyage. I had noted that, during the
transfer of passengers for France, Laven-
der stood at the gangplank stretched be-
tween the steamers, and carefully observed
every person who went aboard the tender.
For a time, I had looked for fireworks,
but apparently there was no call for his
interference.

  We sat late that night, upon the deck,
the three of us, and for a time the purser
made a quartette. It was with reluctance
that Crown took his departure.

  “We dock in the morning,” he said, as
he prepared to go. “I’ve a nasty report to
make to the company, Mr. Lavender. You
haven’t anything to tell me that will make
it easier?”

  “The report will be full and complete,”

replied my friend. “The murderer will be
apprehended at quarantine, by Scotland
Yard officials, and the jewels will be turned
over at that time.”

  Crown was startled and amazed.

  “You don’t mean to say that—that
you’ve got your man!”

  “Not yet,” said Lavender, “but I shall
certainly get him. Crown, he is one of the
officers of this ship.”

  The purser’s jaw dropped; his fat
cheeks sagged. His eyes searched the eyes
of Lavender.

  “My God!” he said. “I’m almost afraid
to ask you—who he is!”

  Suddenly he got to his feet. “Will you
come to my cabin?” he asked. “This is
no place to discuss what you have to tell
me.”

  Lavender nodded his head and stood up.
They moved off together in the direction
of the forward deck.

  “Ready, Gilruth!” said the Major,
sharply, and I saw that his face was hard
and set, his limbs braced. “After them
quickly.”

  The sudden intelligence seared my brain
like a hot iron, and then I went cold. But
Rittenhouse was already on his way, and
mechanically I followed him.

  We were none too soon. Lavender and
the purser had barely disappeared beyond
the cheek of the wireless cabin, when the
huge criminal fell upon his companion.
There was a shout, and then a scuffling of
feet and the sound of blows. The next
instant, Rittenhouse and I were on the
scene.

  In the deep shadow of the piled life-
boats, a desperate struggle was in progress,
with the rail and the water dangerously
close. Even as we reached them, the
wrestlers pitched toward the edge; the
great bulk of the purser was forcing the
slimmer figure of Lavender back over the
rail. I heard the cold rush of the water,
and the heaving breathing of the comba-
tants. The wind snatched away my cap,
and tingling spray beat upon my face.

  Then Rittenhouse was upon the purser
like a wolf, and with cleared wits I was
beside him, aiding.

  The powerful Crown fought like a
maniac, but the odds were now against
him, and slowly we wore him down. Hag-
gard and disheveled, he struggled to the
last. At length, Rittenhouse tripped him
and brought him down with a thud that
seemed to shake the deck. Kneeling on
the great heaving chest of the beaten man,
the Major forced the purser’s wrists to-
n8

SHORT STORIES

gether, while Lavender snapped on brace-
lets of steel. As the struggle ended, Cap-
tain Rogers and his first officer ran up out
of the shadows.

  “Mr. Crown, Mr. Crown,” panted the
captain, “what is the meaning of this?”
But as the purser could only glare and
foam, Lavender, slightly breathless, re-
plied for him.

  “It means, sir,” said he, “that Mr.
Crown has just been frustrated in an at-
tempt to throw me overboard. Major Rit-
tenhouse and Mr. Gilruth prevented him.
As I explained to you, our actual evidence
was slight, and it became necessary to
force Mr. Crown to incriminate himself.
The attempted murder of James E. Laven-
der will do for the present charge. Later
it will be changed to something more
serious.”

  The first officer was incredulous.

  “Do you mean,” he began, “that Mr.
Crown had anything to do with—?”

  “I believe the murder of the Baroness
Borsolini to have been accidental,” an-
swered Lavender. “None the less, it was
Mr. Crown who committed the crime.”
Suddenly the fat face of the prostrate
man wrinkled like that of -a child, and the
great frame began to heave. Then sobs of
anguish broke from the lips, and incredible
tears rolled down the massive cheeks.

  “I didn’t mean to kill her,” sobbed the
purser. “I swear to God, Captain, it was
an accident* I never meant to kill her.
So help me God, it was an accident!”

V

WITH the purser safely locked in
his room, under heavy guard,
Lavender, in the captain’s cabin,
repeated the tale as chronologically it
should be told.

  “The Baroness Borsolini,” said he, “was
really Kitty Desmond, a well known ad-
venturess. Crown has made a full con-
fession to me and to Rittenhouse. Miss
Desmond was made the repository of the
stolen Schuyler jewels, and sent to Eng-
land with them, where they were to be sold,
I imagine, and the money divided. She
recognized me when I came on board, and
wondered if I were on her trail. It wor-
ried her, and she made the bold play of
coming to me with a cock-and-bull story
of attempted theft, in order to find out
what I knew and, if I knew nothing, to
gain my sympathies. I am convinced that
there was no attempt on her room, the
first night.

  “Crown, however, recognized her. She
had been a frequent voyager on the At-
lantic, and many men knew her. She had
been pointed out to Crown, a year ago, on
another ship. He knew
only that she was a
police character, and
probably up to no good.
When I sent her to
him, to test her story,
she was obliged to carry
the thing through, and
tell him the same story
she had told me. She
trusted Crown’s office,
as she had every right to do, and actually
deposited the jewels there, and received
the usual receipt.

  “But the temptation was too great for
Crown, he was desperately hard up—
deeply in debt—back home in England. It
looked to him like a sure thing. He would
keep the jewels himself, steal the receipt
which had been issued to Kitty Desmond,
and defy her to say anything. He was,
of course, in a position to fix the records
in his own office, and being a matter of
routine no one else likely to remember the
issuing of that particular receipt. There
could be no appeal for the woman; her
story would be laughed at, if she reported
it, for her reputation was against her.
Probably she would accept the inevitable
and make no outcry.

  “Crown’s slip occurred when, on the
second night, he stole the receipt which
had been given her. She woke up, and to
keep her from screaming, he choked her.
His reputation depended upon his silencing
her, at least until he could talk to her. If
he had not killed her, he would have
offered her—when she caught him in the
act of theft—a share of the profits. Un-
fortunately, she died under his hands; he
is stronger than he suspects. He got the
receipt, however, and fled. No one saw
him; he had timed everything very well.

  “As it happened, in giving young Russell
a false address, the night before, the
Baroness—so to call her— had torn off a
fragment of the receipt, the only piece of
paper that came to hand in the darkness.
Whether she knew what it was, or not,
we shall never know. Perhaps she did,
for she tore off only a small piece; not
enough to spoil the receipt. But there was
enough of the print on the reverse of the
written address, for me to guess what the
entire paper must have been. If then, she
had deposited something with the purser’s
office, the purser had lied when he told me

                                                       10
THE MID-WATCH TRAGEDY

119

she had not. In the circumstances, the
logical conclusion was that she had de-
posited the jewels.

  “Crown is a bold man, and he played his
part well, once he was forced to it. But
in the end, I let him know, through Ritten-
house, the importance I attached to a cer-
tain fragment of paper. As he had the
rest of the paper himself, he knew very
well what it was that I had, and what I
probably suspected. He tried to bluff it
through, even tonight, for he wasn’t posi-
tive that I knew, and he had destroyed the
rest of the receipt. Nevertheless, he was
badly frightened, and he had already re-
solved to get rid of the jewels, and try to
clear his skirts.

  “As for me, my case was purely circum-
stantial, and would have been difficult to
prove in law; I had to force Crown to in-
criminate himself. I told him point blank,
just before he sprang upon me, that he
would be arrested, told him where the
jewels were, and asked him what he in-
tended to do about it. You know the
rest.”

  “And a wonderful beginning of your va-
cation it has been!” I said bitterly, looking
at his lacerated hands.

  “Don’t be silly,” said Lavender. “I
never enjoyed myself more in my life.
This has been just what I needed. And
I’m sure the sea air, as a background, has
been very beneficial to my nerves.”

  “But where are the jewels?” asked the
captain suddenly.

  “I asked Gilruth to bring them with
him,” replied Lavender with a smile. “As
a last resort, Crown tried to get rid of
them, as I said, and so he palmed them off
on Gilly. The birthday gave him his
chance. The jewels are at the bottom of
the box of candy, which was the purser’s
gift to my friend.”

  Whereupon, I emptied the box onto the
table; and the chorus of exclamations that
followed were Lavender’s reward for his
efforts, and the final proof of the truth of
his deductions, even though later the sui-
cide of Albert Crown made legal proof
unnecessary, and made unnecessary the
prosecution of that unfortunate man.

               THE HOME OF A VANISHED RACE

THE once brilliant capital of the lost Maya race, a race which reared an amazing culture
in what is now Yucatan before the dawn of the Christian Era, is being exhumed from the
covering debris of twenty centuries and more.

    Mosaic temple floors, palaces, pyramids, ball courts, market places, terraces, tombs and
plazas cover an area two miles long and a mile wide; and beyond this in every direction for
miles stretch the homes of the humbler folk of the lost race.

    The work of excavating the ruins of Chichen Itza, the center of the old civilization, from
the jungles of Yucatan is being carried on by an expedition of archaeologists sent by the
Carnegie Institute of Washington. It began last May and probably will take ten years,
according to the estimate of Dr. Sylvanus G. Morley, who heads the work.

    Part of the excavation, already done, discovered to the explorers beautifully carved
columns, whose great numbers have given to the court which was the center of the old city
the name of “The Court of a Thousand Columns.” In it has been found a figure of Ku Kul-
can, the patron diety of Chichen Itza, surrounded by sculptured figures of jaguars and flowers.

    A map of the ancient capital has been prepared by J. O. Kilmartin of the United States
Geological Survey, whose services were loaned to the Carnegie Institute. This map will en-
able the archaeologists now working in Yucutan to locate every temple and plaza in Chichen
Itza.

    The work of excavation has to be suspended during the summer and autumn of each
year because of the rains.—L. R.

  PITILESSLY HUNTED BY HIS ENEMY, MAN, THE GREAT WOLF SOUGHT THE REFUGE
  OF HIS NATIVE DESERT. THROUGH THE NIGHT HE MADE GOOD HUNTING. BUT

  THERE WAS LONELINESS IN HIS HEART-UNTIL THE DEEP THROATED, PULSING

  CALL HE SENT ACROSS THE DARKNESS BROUGHT THE ANSWER HE AWAITED

THE desert was a place of exotic
grandeur, of silvered half-lights
and toned shadows. From a
heaven of vast distances came
the subtle, mercuric glow of
myriad stars like crusting diamond chips
on the softness of purple velvet. The night
was a time of magnificence unparalleled
by the hours of day. The Joshua trees and
the giant yuccas were dark, weird sentries
in the elfin hours when Nalin, the Night
Girl, as the old legend called the moon,
came from her cave and rode her celestial
pathway, illuminating the flats with her re-
flected beneficence.

  The awkward branchings of the desert
trees and the crude forms of the giant cac-
tus lent unreality and added confusing
shadows. The sharp leaves of the sotol,
the cat’s claws, the great dagger plants and
all manner of queer growths lost their for-
bidding appearance and merged into false
softness under the night’s touch of magic.

  It was such a night as Shinav, the great
Wolf God might choose for one of his sal-
lies against the things of evil, loosing his
arrows that the white men find in the val-
leys which are stained with the blood of
strife, and, finding them, call them petri-
fied trees.

  The desert was under the spell of the old
gods now, and Hie power of the newer

things could not prevail. Enchantment
and almost forgotten spells could work
again for a few brief hours. Not a night
breeze stirred. From vague distances
came the unreality of a coyote’s voice, lost
at last in the far waste places. One thing
moved. It was a shadow, a darker streak
than the purples. It wavered in and out
among the spiny growths and it made no
sound in passing. There was solidity
about it, yet it was as a wraith in the night,
dark, sinister, strange.

  Far off, inaudible to ears less keenly at-
tuned to read the message of the very cur-
rents of air, was a sound other than that
of the coyote’s voice. The great wolf
stopped and there was a silent snarl. The
hunting pack sent forth by men was baffled
again.

  It had happened before, often. They
had harried him and he had retaliated
against their masters. It was ceaseless war
with extermination the only terms that
could end it. Ten miles, each night, the
great lobo had circled in days that were
gone, making his kill sometimes when hun-
ger drove him into the herds of men. But
after a fashion this was their fault. His
kind had existed on the buffalo and the
antelopes before the white man came.
Now that ten miles circle was a thing of
the past. The trailing dogs and the fight-
UNDER THE MATING MOON

121

ing pack that yipped so eagerly behind
them drove him afar at every opportunity.
Into the desert wastes they could not track
him. Here on the hot sands even their
keen noses were at a loss.

  Not so with him. Here he found com-
fortable abode. And how he hated them!
To him all dogs were anathema. There
had been nights, many of them, when he
had deliberately used every wile of that
cunning brain to lure the fleetest of them
away from the others. They were big dogs,
these long-eared, deep-voiced hounds, and
game to death, but he held them in con-
tempt. Only once had his plan worked.
That night he sat on the rising slope above
a ranch house and howled his fierce de-
fiance at the race of men and their dogs.
Then the pack came, their trailing methods
forgotten in the mad pell-mell of the sight
hunt.

  Two of them distanced the rest by a full
hundred yards, and the great lobo held
back that amazing burst of which he was
capable. A dark arroyo opened in front
and he sped nimbly down its steep sides
with the big hounds following. At the
bottom an explosive thing happened. The
lobo’s feet seemed scarcely to touch the
fallen sand as he leaped in and slashed
twice, then he trotted in that shambling
fashion on up the aroyo, circled a patch
of greasewood and was gone into the night,
while the trailing pack, stopped by their
dying companions, resumed the chase too
late.

  Tonight again he had tried it, but one
lesson was sufficient for these dogs which
had been brought only after poison and
traps failed. And tonight they had hung
together and chased him long. Hours after
they took the trail he left them at the edge
of the desert and he was tired. New un-
derstanding of their gameness came in that
chase. He hated them with an unreason-
ing hatred.

  Perhaps some of the emotion which had
never found opportunity in his own kind
and therefore soured within him, went into
that hatred. In the years of his maturity
he had never known another of his breed.
By the hand of man, which distributes
poisoned haits cleverly concealed, his
mother had died. He had seen her pick
up the piece of meat, then fall writhing in
the awful convulsions that the strychnine
wolf pill brings. An iron thing with sharp
jaws had leaped out of the earth near a
freshly killed calf and held the leg of his
litter brother until the men came and killed
him. Two of the shaggy fighting dogs had
10

caught and killed the other member of the
litter, a small female, and since that time
the lobo understood all the hunting wiles
of men so well that they termed it un-
canny.

  On all the sweet grass ranges, in the
cooler hills, amid the hot wastes of the
desert there had never been an answer to
his long, deeply reverberating howls. And
now he trotted in that strange, slinking
gait amid the desert growths and his mind
was filled with hatred for the pack that
was left so far behind. He was their mas-
ter, individually, in every quality. And
he was their master even as a pack, in some
things. In power of fang, in the cunning
of battle he was more than a match for any
of them. More, for any three of them.
In speed, in shrewdness he surpassed them
all together. There was nothing of vanity,
none of over-confidence in that supreme
contempt he knew for them. He had tested
them in every fashion and gauged them
nicely.

  Here they would not come after him.
The desert was his sanctuary. He ruled it
supreme, and accorded respect only to the
side-winders and the red rattlers that were
to be found within its reaches.

  Miles behind him, on the very edge of
the sand waste, the dogs had given up, but
the lobo went on, and here the desert was
broken. Its sharp, luxuriant vegetation
gave way to sparser and even sharper
growths amid the rocky outcroppings that
told of rising heights and the ancient
mountains. Century plants and Spanish
daggers grew in crevices. The shadows
were stronger, sharper cut and more dense.
A sense of harsh mysticism pervaded.
There were luring valleys that were prom-
ising but that promise, too, was false.

  Into the entire region the lobo fitted by
every characteristic. About him was that
same indefinable harshness; it was as
though in him the vaguely ominous spirit

o	f the wastes
found being. He
was the symbol
of the inanimate,
living, a thing
that represented
death and hard-
ness and hate.
Yet there was
something
strangely sinu-
ous about him
as he moved, suggestive of slinking power.

  Once he stopped with forefeet on a rock,
silhouetted against the soft glow of the
122

SHORT STORIES

heavens. His head rose, muzzle high, and
went back. His mouth opened and the
long fangs that were turned inward in-
stead of out, as are those of a dog,
gleamed. But no sound came and in his
eyes was a greenish fire, clouded, flaming,
ebbing.

  Thoughts of the pack he had left so far
behind dulled and faded. He had nothing
in common with them. Thief and mur-
derer of the wild reaches they considered
him, and to him they represented all that
is deserving only of death. Tonight they
had run him long. He was tired, but the
silences of these desert mountains did not
bring him content. Again he halted and
that lambent flame in his eyes was opales-
cent in the darkness.

  High in the heavens the Night Girl
flooded her pale softness, diffused into in-
terminable distances. It was magic, irre-
sistible. Again the lobo stopped and his
head went back. There was a low sound
like the yip of a tiny dog, then from deep
in his chest came the howl. It was heavy,
throaty, a great basso. It rolled forth as
thunder in the distant hills, throbbing,
beating, rising in tone as it fell in volume.
In it was unfathomable depth of loneli-
ness. Over the miles it pulsed, long drawn,
to merge at last with and die in the still-
ness. It was the wail of a wraith that is
lost in outer darkness.

  An interval of silence followed, then it
pulsed forth again straight up to that moon
of magic and back to the far reaches of
the desert, carried by echo.

  A night breeze stirred, hot, a moving
current close to the sand and rock, drifting
into the crevasses. Circling about to curl
up there amid the rocks, the great lobo
stopped, then sank to a crouch and stif-
fened. Those flames of greenish hue
played and faded in his eyes as cold fire
in the boreal skies.

  There was no perceptible movement, yet
he seemed to be up, alert, tense. The
clouded fires were brighter in his eyes.
Noiseless as one of the ghost folk which
the red men assert wander of nights in
these mountains of the desert, he moved
and was lost in the stygian blackness of a
rocky dip where the boulders lay in jum-
bled fashion. A patch of moonlight re-
vealed a flitting shadow and he was gone
again into the blackness where the celestial
illumination did not penetrate. This was
the cunning of his brain and instincts,
masterful at all the arts of concealment.
Only his eyes were visible in the darkness
and it may have been the intensity of hate

that made them glow so vividly as though
eager fires burned.

  That hot ground breeze came steadily
and was stronger as he crossed a sharp
ridge and went down into the forgotten
bed of an ancient watercourse that told of
the days when the world was young. His
advance became a swift lope; the mane was
stiffened about his neck and added an ap-
pearance of weightiness as though he was
swollen. Abruptly he went into a crouch-
ing run, a fierce closing rush, and stopped,
head high, over a cringing form. A rum-
bling was in his chest, an ominous sound,
but he looked away from that lighter, cow-
ering thing.

  Minutes passed and the two figures were
motionless, like graven things. The lips
of each were lifted and a stray shaft of
moonlight filtering through a break in the
rocky ridge revealed the bared fangs of
dog and wolf.

  Theirs was a hatred of heritage, an emo-
tion developed through the centuries. Be-
tween them was a chasm greater than
anything which separates the races of man,
its depths sunk into the chaos of utter hate.
Tonight the hunting pack from the ranches
of men had run him miles, every booming
mouthing of the trailers, every sharp yip
of the fighters pronouncement of the hate
of their kind for him. And he had led
them on hoping to separate one or more
from the rest that he might kill them alone.
No individual among them could cope with
the speed of his lunging stride and he had
longed for just this opportunity—but he
did not leap in to attack.

  Slowly he backed off a few stiff-legged
steps, and sat down. His head went up and
his keen muzzle was pointed at the silvered
stars. Across the desert that awful throb-
bing roar sounded, beating, pulsing, rising
in cadence to the desolation of utter lone-
liness. There had never been an answer
to that wail though at times he sent it forth
often through the night and traveled afar
over the sand wastes and the rock.

  The dog trembled at that sound and the
great wolf approached again and stood
close, towering over the lighter form of
the hound. He leaped back once lightly as
a wind blown leaf, and the dog’s teeth
clicked on empty air. Again and again
he advanced, stood close and leaped nim-
bly to avoid those teeth. Also he saw the
pathetically thin flanks of the dog that
rose and fell so rapidly in strained panting
at the slightest exertion, and then he fol-
lowed a few feet behind as the dog moved
weakly off to where a rock overhang shut

                                                        10

out even the dim glow from above.

  Throughout the hours of night the lobo
hung close. At times he, too, was gone
from sight beneath that overhang only to
appear suddenly, bounding back into the
open like a rubber thing. But the inter-
vals were longer and at last he did not re-
appear.

IN THE eastern sky rose tints diffused
the gray and spread as bands of
orange, the heat colors rising on the
brow of day. The last star was gone and
the time of mystic enchantment gave way
to that harsh reality. The heat increased
and the sands and rock magnified it and
gave it back until the heat waves became
visible, dancing their oppressive haze
higher and higher from the surface. The
rocks took on reddish hues and browns
shading to sepias and crimsons. It was as
though nebulous flame from that inverted
cauldron in the heavens touched and fired
them. The flats with their tawny sand
glittered and the cactus and other growths
cast thinnest of shadows that were.lost en-
tirely as the sun passed overhead. Grad-
ually it westered and the jagged crests of
stone in the mountains gave lengthening
shadows. The fierce reds, the mad colors
of the rocks, faded to the hue of dried
blood, became dun and deepening browns.

  Under the rock overhang something
moved. A long, gray brown head with
slanted, reddish eyes appeared and the lobo
lay with muzzle on forepaws, watching a
lengthening shadow of purple that came
from a sharp needle of rock.

  Dusk was in the canyons ere he moved,
sitting up. He yawned and his head turned
in a slow half circle, peering all about.
Then he got up, stretched and moved out
into the world of vague shadows even as
one of them. On the high ridges were
tints of red gold as the last rays of the sun
burnished them to richly metallic color-
ings. Higher toward the peaks that last
touch of day mounted and was gone at last.
Stars were out and in the east the brass
disc of the Night Girl appeared to claim
her world of desert.

  Through the night the lobo moved, a
part of it. Once he stopped on a low shelf
of rock and looked away toward the east
where lay the lands of men with their
herds and their calves that were so easy to
take. He looked toward them over the
miles and his muzzle wrinkled and lifted
slightly in what might have been a snarl.
But he went on toward the south, a mov-
ing segment of the vague darkness, and

   10

remained among the mountains. The miles
passed under that swift lope. Once a coy-
ote fled, streaking low across the wastes
at his approach, and a few moments later
a bagnio of sound told that it had stopped
to voice its resentment at the invasion of
another to its solitudes.

  The lobo paid no heed, and passed over
a broad table of rock, then down into a
widening canyon. His pace was slower
now and often he stopped to test the air.
He dropped into a crouch and his mane
was up again. Where the canyon spread
broad and flat there was running water,
cold from the springs of hidden caverns
far back in the mountains. But the scent
that came to the lobo was not of water.
It was the man scent.

  Those lambent flames played more
strongly across the great lobo’s eyes and
he was up. Silently he trotted off, swing-
ing wide and testing the air. Uneasily he
looked back often as he went down the
canyon to where the sage growths started
in the lower reaches. There he leaped
forward in a galvanic burst that was like

the swishing of a
sudden gust. The
huge jackrabbit
at which he had
leaped bounded
up a fraction too
slow and died be-
fore it could
squeak. The lobo
appeased his hun-
ger somewhat,
then went on and
a half mile be-
yond the tragedy was repeated, for he was
a masterful hunter by every instinct. But
this second jack he did not eat. A few
moments he rested, then picked it up and
carried it down to the water. There he
lapped a long time, again took up the rab-
bit and turned back as he had come, back
through the rock wastes of the rugged,
desert mountains. Only the moon saw his
passing and the eastern sky was pale with
the dawning as he came to the rock over-
hang, still carrying the jack in his great
jaws.

  Again followed one of those days of
heat, of glaring light and fierce tints on the
rocks, a day when the world was a place
of flame and reds darkening to deepest
browns that turned to purples as the long
shadows crept. And with the advent of
dusk the lobo appeared once more. His
way led again as it had the night before
and when he came to the place where the
124

SHORT STORIES

drifting currents of lazy air brought him
the man scent he stopped as he had the
night before, his lips lifting in the silent
snarl of hatred.

  He went on down toward the sage flats
where he had killed the jackrabbits, all un-
aware that through the night a lighter
form had followed him from the rock
overhang. As the dog came to where the
breeze drifted up with its scent from the
prospector’s camp it stopped, looked in the
direction the lobo had gone, whimpered
and hesitated. Twice it started toward the
canvas flap of the men’s camp only to halt
each time and peer through the darkness
after the lobo. Then it went on down to
the man, a tall, dark figure.

  Eagerly the man welcomed the hound.
His words were kindly as he knelt and
examined the scrawny form in which the
marks of starvation and thirst were evi-
dent.

  “I thought you were gone, sure,” he
said, “an’ I tramped two whole days lookin’
fur you. Where you been?”

  The dog whimpered, looked at the man,
then turned its head to stare away into the
darkness where down in the flats the lobo
hunted long.

A JACK got up far in front of the
hunting lobo and sped off with such
an advantage that even his speed
could not overtake it. An hour went by
and another as he ranged along with head
low, seeking air currents that hung closest
to the ground. At last came his chance
and he drove in, crushing down a small
sage clump wherfc the jack nestled. He
was intensely hungry himself, but he did
not stop to eat as he had the night before.
Instead he looked toward the heavens. It
may be he measured the hours of night
that remained to travel the distance to the
rock overhang. Once again he stopped at
the creek to drink and the water increased
his hunger, but he picked up the jack and
fell into that trotting lope which consumed
the miles.

  The heavenly lights were paling and the
first ribbons of rose and orange in the east
were the heralds of day as he came to the
rock overhang. He was gone beneath it
but emerged almost instantly without the
rabbit. There was something eagerly alert
about him and he ranged in a wide circle
with head high in the air. Once he howled,
that deep-throated, pulsing howl. The
fierceness was gone from it and the lone-
liness was intensified. He stopped to listen,
then howled again. His head came down

until his muzzle was close to the rock and
sand. It seemed there was something
frantic about his movements as he circled
back and forth.

  One brief moment he halted, sniffing,
then sped off, head low. A little while-yet
that scent would hold. It was very faint.
Even his keen nostrils might have passed
it by unnoticed under other circumstances.
An hour more and it would vanish entirely
under the touch of the sun’s rays. His
speed was amazing, but the sun rose faster
and sooh the last vestige of that scent was
gone. No living thing could have held the
trail. On the edge of a ridge the lobo
stopped and his head went back but he did
not howl for daylight was brilliant over the
desert.

  The sun had passed its zenith when he
returned again to the rocky place. The
jack was still there, untouched, and he
nosed it and licked it. His hunger was
great and it was tempting, but he did not
eat it. His head stretched out on his paws
as he lay and his eyes were closed, but they
opened often, slanted, amber hued eyes
that looked out as though they expected
to see something that did not appear. His
ears moved slightly on occasion. Again
he watched the purpling shadows, sharp
cut as they slid down from the western
heights, saw the reds lose their fire and
turn to brown, then merge into solidity of
tone with gradations of density.

  Slowly, as though wearied, he arose and
was gone into the night. Smoldering fires
were renewed and burned consumingly
within him as the moon rose. He had been
hungry but the hunger was forgotten. On
other nights the creek with its cold water
from the heights had been his first thought.
Now he went toward it, but the desire that
came was not to be quenched there.

  At last he came over the same way as
he had come before. Once the night
breeze told him of a rabbit not far off, but
he paid no heed and went on, up over the
region of boulders, up where the rocks
mounted higher to a low mesa that stood
silhouetted against the mercuric glow of
the heavens, a vast block of harder stone
that had been left by the erosion of the
centuries.

  There, high above the desert he stood
and his keen eyes saw far through the half
lights. Then, out over the wastes his cry
sounded, mournful, deep. The very air
seemed to tremble with it and in this re-
gion of silence it throbbed off into dis-
tances unbelievable. Often he had given
voice to that howl when this moon illu-

                                                      10

125

mined the heavens, and it had never been
answered. Twice his neck and throat
swelled and that awful sound pulsed forth.

  In his camp the prospector heard it and
saw his dog’s head lift, then witnessed that
which made him wonder. The dog was
up, quivering. Suddenly it leaped away
into the night and he called after it. But
the dog did not return. Again the man
called, then mused aloud.

  “You fool! You got lost before an’
I don’t know why you didn’t die for want

q’ grub an’
prater. You
ain’t got sense
enough to
know that’s a
lobo’s howl an’
if he gets wind
o’ you he’ll kill
you sure.”

  H e peered
through the
semi - darkness
up the canyon and thought he saw a light-
ish form that moved very rapidly. Out
of the stillness again came the howl of the
lobo, faint, distant. The man shook his
head resignedly and sat down, while far
off the lobo turned down off the mesa. He
no longer traveled at that easy lope. His
walk was slow and .his head hung lower.
Life had played strangely with him. Never

an answer, and there were times as now
when that moon was a thing that brought
madness to his kind. He seemed very
tired as though the years had suddenly
taken heavy toll. Again he was going back
toward that rock overhang. Something
lured irresistibly. He was almost there
when he stopped and turned. In his chest
was a deep rumbling, and afar he saw
something of lighter hue that approached
rapidly.

  Suddenly the lobo’s head arose, his mane
stood out in swollen fashion. A marked
change came over him. He moved a few
steps toward the approaching thing and
the shuffling walk gave way to that stiff-
legged trot. All the old power was evi-
dent and he broke into a wild run beside
the dog, circling, leaping over and ahead
of the lighter form. His feet seemed
scarcely to touch the sands.

  In front of the rocky overhang they
stopped together, then the dog entered and
came out with the forgotten form of the
jackrabbit. Stiff-legged the lobo circled
about and once his head went back as the
howl throbbed over the reaches. But it
was different. The loneliness was gone
out of it, given way to something of fierce
defiance, of possession perhaps. The dog
trembled, then came and licked his muzzle
and the lobo stood in guardian fashion as
she returned to the rabbit.

SEQUOIAS

IN ONE of the groves of Sequoias or “Big Trees” in Tulare County, California, is found
mute evidence of the wonderful span of life and the enduring quality after death of these
giant trees.

    Count of the annual growth rings shows that the increase in diameter approximates one
foot per century. A tree one foot in diameter may not show one hundred annual rings but
one seven or ten feet through will usually show about seven or ten hundred, respectively.

    Trunks now lie prostrate in the forest, still perfectly sound, with trees more than seven
feet in diameter growing in positions where they could have started only after the fall of the
prostrate trees.

    Death, barring the hand of man, the great destroyer, seems to come to this family only
through accident, like uprooting in softened soil or by some freak wind storm. Lightning
does not seem to kill them, for many thrifty trees show scars of the Jovian bolts, and forest
fires fail even to injure the bark.

    One tree that fell and has now entirely disappeared in the almost countless centuries
elapsed since its fall, made and still shows a lasting monument in the form of a trench-like
depression formed by the accumulation of mold and soil against its trunk while existent
and now made visible by the total disappearance of the tree. Within this trench or vacant
bed, now grows a Sequoia more than twenty seven feet in diameter as high from the ground
as a man can reach to measure it. This living successor to the older tree could only have
sprouted after the disintegration of its predecessor. Excavation within the depression gives
evidence that the old tree was not destroyed by fire.—M. L. W.

By WALBRIDGE DUDLEY

        WAITING OUT THERE IN THE LANE OF THE BIG LINERS, CAPTAIN HO-
        GAN OF THE “LAUGHING LADY” WAS CONTENT TO KEEP HIS HANDS
        OFF THE SMUGGLING ACTIVITIES OF HIS SINISTER PASSENGER, UNTIL
        DAVY TENCH TEMPTED HIM, THEN THINGS TOOK A CURIOUS TURN

LATE of Georges Banks, later of
Nassau and Rum Row, the
Laughing Lady, Captain
Thomas Hogan commanding,
was slogging into it, with stay-
sail taut as a Congo drum; her standing
gear all a-whine to the lash of the shouting
wind and white water over her weather
shoulder every forty seconds. Smash!
She would cut into a long, hogback roller 1
Then a tall geyser of spray would nod,
glitter, collapse in a lather on the deck and
vanish with a gurgle over the taffrail,
ghost pale in the faint fire of the splinter-
ing stars.

  “Ten knots, easy,” barked Hogan over:
his shoulder, and spat where the lee
smoked to the rush of black water. “Ten
knots. We’ll be pickin’ her up any minute,
Mister—uh—Mister Jones.”

  “You have already. Look ahead.”

 “And so we have,” acknowledged
Hogan, squinting eastward over the other’s
pointing hand.

  On the rim of the tossing world a tiny
diamond and ruby cluster sparked at them
across a dark infinity.

  “We’re south of her course, aren’t we,
Captain ? Might as well lay up, now.”

  “Ah, sure, an’ that’s wan thing I got
tired of, a-layin’ there in the Row off the
Jersey coast; but it’s right ye arre, Mister
Jones, an’ so be it.” His thick voice rose
in a sharp succession of bellowed orders.
The deck sprang to life; the wheelman

slammed her fair into the wind. Up she
came, slatting and whipping. Hogan bel-
lowed again, and whing—clink—whir—
whir—whir—down dropped jib and fore-
sail, and there rode the Laughing Lady,
with the reef points on her mainsail snap-
ping, a block up forward rattling like a
snare drum and the black water sneaking
by.

  “Good! Hold her so!” said Hogan, and
turned to his passenger. “I’ll be steppin’
below wan minute, Mister Jones. Will ye
be after havin’ a small snifter? ’Tis cold
work, this.”

  “I’ll be along in a little.”

 “Right ye are,” said Hogan; but he
paused at the companion head to stare back
at the spare figure silhouetted against the
stars.

  “Cripes!” muttered Hogan, “there’s a
pr-roper hard lad. Salted, he is and no
mistake. A bad guy in a squabble, I’m
thinkin’, and I’m no tremblin’ lilly meself.”
He shrugged and went below.

  It was true. Hogan was not the first
man who had seen the winter in Jones’
pale eyes. And this business he was on
tonight called for all that, keeping him
briefly above decks now. He looked back
over the way they had come.

  It had rained the day before and now
a horned moon drifted down the sky; a
combination that lit the ocean with long
streaks of an intense phosphoresence.
Their wake still swarmed behind the
126	10

Laughing Lady like some gigantic jeweled
scimitar slowly returning to the sheath of
night.

  He looked forward again. The liner
was climbing the curve of the world, up,
up, mounting with a startling rapidity.
The wind veered, came in fitful gusts,
seemed about to die away. Somewhere up
near the bow a man began to sing. From
the four hours he had been aboard Jones
knew already that it must be the cook, a
Barbadoes nigger with bag eyes, an Eng-
lish accent, and a voice like an angel’s.

  “Never For You,” he sang, fixing his
pitch, and then his great baritone boomed
into the night:

“You may not greet the scented halms
That drift across a breathless sea
From those low coasts, where slender
palms

Dream in the moonlight, silently-

  On and on went his booming voice while
the cordage hummed a cello accompani-
ment, on and on across the distance,
mounting into the colossal void, climbing
the pale stairway of the stars. And the

liner came on and on-

  Jones shook himself as though rousing
from the vagueness of a dream, from the
depths of some hypnotic spell. Captain
Hogan appeared on deck and handed his
passenger a flask silently. The negro’s
song died away.

  “She’s coming fast,” said Jones.

  “Aye, that she is,” acknowledged Hogan.
“Steppin’ right along. Ain’t goin’ to miss
us more’n a thousand yards either. Prob’ly
not that. She’s bearin’ this way.”

  “All right. Got those lanterns ready I
spoke about? Yeah? Well, better run
’em up.”

 Hogan shouted, “Tench! Oh, Tench!”
Then he muttered, “Where the two horned
divvil is the lad? Ah, now, here he comes.
This is a felly with sinse, Mister Jones,
very stiddy.”

  The aproaching man called out, “Aye,
Cap’n.” It was too dark for Jones to
make out much except that he seemed well
knit, held his head high and gave an inde-
finable impresion of youth. “Aye, Cap’n.”
“There’s two side lights lashed together
with a white lantern below,” ordered
Hogan. “Get thim, Tench, an’ run ’em
up.”

“On my way, Cap’n,” answered Tench
in a pleasant, throaty voice, disappeared,
and within five minutes the red, green, and
yellow lights were a cluster at the fore
10

truck, dipping and swaying in wide arcs
to the roll of the racing seas.

  It was plain now that the liner would
pass them close; she seemed to be veering
in. But Hogan was not looking at her.
Studying Jones, he swayed closer to him.

  “Ye certainly got wan divvil of a swell
lay, Mister Jones. They bring it right to
ye, don’t they? Man, it’s fair wunnerful!”

  A grim, slow smile slid down Jones’
angular face, avoiding his pale eyes as it
came. The pulse of the liner’s screws was
loud across the water.

  “I don’t know, Cap. You got a tough
gang here. S’pose you decided to frisk
me an’ then tie a little scrap iron to my
ankles, eh?”

  Hogan recoiled. “May the good God
forbid!” he stammered. “In cold blood?
Never! ’Tis a good figger ye’re payin’.
Me and me bould boys share it. ’Tis
enough without neck stretchin’.”

  “Just the same,” answered Jones, with
his sleep walker’s staring smile, “you were
thinking of it, or you wouldn’t have
jumped so when I mentioned it.”

  Hogan’s resentment was muffled by a
hail from the liner’s bridge. The shout
spewed down on them, thickened by a
megaphone: “’Hoy theer! In any
trouble ?”

  “No!” bellowed Hogan between his
cupped paws.

  “Why the lights?”

  “We’re signallin’ fish!” roared Hogan,
and the Barbadoes nigger cackled as he
lurched to the curl of the wash from the
enormous black bulk rushing by, tier on
towering tier of golden port holes, and a
faint burst of music spattering through the
wind. Then the whoosh, whoosh, of the
giant screws, the slick sides rounding into
the stern, and a flash of white falling, fall-
ing, from some obscured port.

  "What was that?” called someone in the
waist sharply.

  “Shush, a bit of paper, Mist’ Tench,”
answered the nigger’s baritone.

  “It fell too fast!”

  Jones smiled his slow, frosty smile.

  “Get a boat over!” whooped Hogan.
The men sprang to it.

  “Well, well,” put in Jones, “a little ex-
citement, eh?” He raised his voice.
“Guess I’ll go along if y’ don’t mind, Cap-
tain.”

  Hogan stared at him curiously. Jones
fluttered a parchment eyelid.

  “Tench is such a bright boy, didn’t you
say, Cap’n?”

  Hogan shrugged. “Passenger’s goin’
SHORT STORIES

128

fer the ride,” he shouted.

  Jones dropped into the stern as the
boat got away to a succession of furious
climbs and breathless descents. Between
powerful pulls at the stroke oar, young
Tench was studying the passenger cov-
ertly, as well as the vague light would per-
mit. As they skittered over an enormous
roller Jones suddenly flashed a powerful
hand searchlight full in Tench’s face,
blinding the boy for an instant and then
shot the beam beyond the boat, to pick
up a red glint on the water. They swept
down to it.

  “As I live and breathe,” said Jones non-
chalantly, “a nice, fat inner tube, with a
towel or something tied to it, and—yes—
a long—thin box.” He leaned out, pro-
duced a knife with the suddenness of a
magician and cut the tube away. With the
box wedged between his knees he spoke
again, coolly.

  “All right, boys. Let’s be getting back.
I thought maybe somebody was over-
board.”

  As they swung there idly for a moment
in the trough of the tremendous swells
David Tench smiled in-
wardly. He had seen
some strange doings in
his first trip to Rum
Row; and this, he
thought, was the weird-
est of all.

  Backing water with
his long oar he called
out. “Right, fellers!
Give way!” and with a
sudden lunge they began
to climb a long slope to-
ward the wheeling stars
and the tossing lanterns
which marked the

Laughing Lady-

  Aboard again, Jones
stumped to the companion head and so
out of sight. With his hand on a backstay
Hogan bellowed orders and they were
soon under weigh, coming about smartly
under a freshening wind that came zoom-
ing over the port quarter.

  Young Tench kept near the captain.
When he thought Hogan was about to go
below he glanced swiftly around the deck
and stepped up to him.

  “Cap’n,” he muttered, “can I have a
word with you quiet-like?”

  Hogan peered at him. “Wisha, me lad,
a dozen of ’em,” he answered, leading the
way aft.

  “What now, Davy, me bould bucko?”

queried Hogan finally, settling against a
hatch coaming.

  “Cap’n, here’s cases: I know this
feller Jones as he calls himself.”

  Hogan started. “Ye do?”

  “No, no, I don’t mean that way. But
I know what he’s up to. He’s one curly
wolf. I’m no saphead. He got a box out
there from the Ionia, a nice size to slide
out of a stateroom porthole. Fastened to
an inner tube, savvy ? You can blow ’em up
after you shove ’em through the port.
Now, Cap’n, what’s in that box?”

  Hogan was rubbing his grizzled chin
and grinning at the darkness.

  “S’posin’ you tell me, Davy,” he sug-
gested softly.

  “Well, now, Cap’n, I don’t need to tell
you. Nobody needs t’ crack you on the
head with a club to make you see a dollar.”
“A bright la-ad like you would be
a-noticin’, Davy, that I never asked the
felly what ’twas all about when y’ came

overside. And-”

  “Then you knew alia time it’s stones
he’s runnin’?”

  "As ye say, bhoy, I need no clip on the
conk to see the hand before me face.”
Tench edged closer to him. “You know
what I’m a thinkin’, Cap’n?”

  “One o’ thim light taps on the head ye
been talkin’ about an’ we’re both rich men ?
Eh, is that it, now?” whispered Hogan
playfully.

  With iron fingers David seized the
other’s arm.

  “Whs-s-s-t, Cap’n. Who said a word
about taps on the head? Where do we
land this fellow, or don’t we?”

  “Without a drop o’ hard liquor bechune
decks the Laughing Lady c’n take chances.
We’re on the first reach fer a lone spot I
savvy alo‘ng Connecticut way, Davy.”
Tench’s clutch loosened. “Me an’ you
might run him ashore, mightn’t we, Cap?
Nice and friendly like, y’know. He’s a
tough egg, mebbe. But the two of us, eh ?”
Hogan chuckled. “Meanin’ a two way
divvy ? The crew not to know, la-ad ? It
that the lay?”

  “You said sweet music, Cap. Wait till
we get this baby ashore.”

  Hogan laughed aloud. “Bhoy, ye got
the makin’s!” He shot a swift glance
around the pitching deck and added lower,
“The makin’s of wan gr-rand young hi-
jacker !”

David released his arm with a hard
smile and walked away to lounge in the
bows till the squat coast line hove in sight.
The pearl of false dawn was paling the

morning star and the crests of the piling
combers were white as curd outside the
wide inlet when they lost steerageway at
last.

  From the cabin where he had sat watch-
fully through the night, Jones came slowly
up the companion ladder; his lean face
pallid in the light of a hurricane lamp
held high by the bag eyed nigger. The
movements of men across the deck made
blobs of deeper darkness here and there.
A small boat rattled in the falls, knocking
gently as an oily swell slipped underneath.
With the thin box tightly grasped, Jones
crossed to the davits, Hogan following.

  “I’ll see ye safe ashore,” volunteered
the captain, settling himself in the boat.
Tench shouldered through the clustered
men as Jones clambered into the stern.

  “I’ll lend a hand, Cap’n, by your leave,”
he offered, scrambling into the bow seat.

 Hogan looked over his shoulder and
grinned. “Always on the job, eh, la-ad?
The quicker we’re in and out the better.
All right, me bould buckos, lower away!”

  As the boat hit a ground swell with a
teeth rattling jolt, the darkness of the
eastern sky split open to reveal a broad
bar of sword gray light. Through the
vastness of the whimpering air they could
hear the far off tolling of a buoy, deep and
mellow.

  Everything was ghost gray. When they
slipped from the side of the Laughing
Lady her spars stood out sharply for an
instant against the growing light in the east
and then seemed to withdraw into a vague
opalescence. It was as though they drifted
over some pale sea of dreams on which
their lifting oars laid a slow row of silver
discs.

 Looking over his shoulder between
strokes, David caught a quick glimpse of
the misty piles and stringers of a leaning
wharf. He could hear the furtive lapping
uf water beneath. A block rattled on the
distant ship; the wind caught at the sound
and plucked it away. Then Jones an-
nounced quietly: “There’s a landing stage
around at the other side. Row there.”

 Hogan grunted. “Expecting anybody
t’ meet ye, Mister Jones ?”

  “I work alone,” said Jones shortly.

  As they rounded the end of the wharf
David thought of the speed with which
their passenger had made the knife ap-
pear when he cut loose the box from the
inner tube back there in the open sea, and
he wondered whether the man carried it
in a forearm sheath. The fellow was one
tough cracker, for a fact. He speculated

on how big a haul he and Hogan would
make. A fortune probably. Jones had
never chartered them for twelve hours for
any piker stake. He smiled and felt of the
hard weight in his side pocket as Hogan
stopped rowing.

  Offshore the Laughing Lady stood out
suddenly in slender silhouette against the
enormous vacancy of sea and sky. far
off the buoy was tolling, dong—ring, rang
—dong!

  David sprang to his feet as they slid up
to the landing stage. Here the wharf
cut them off from a view of the ship. He
stepped out and threw the painter in a
double half hitch around a stub of rotten
post.

  Hogan grunted to his feet and looked
slowly about. They were shadowed by an
old shed at the landward end of the wharf.
From the landing stage a path ran up a
gentle slope. Some distance inshore was
a group of tiny houses, stark in the morn-
ing light. A thin smudge of lilac smoke
bloomed from a chimney and fled away
in the clutch of the wind.

  Hogan leaped lightly onto the stage, ran
with astonishing speed up the path to the
top of the rise and stood there for a mo-
ment gazing around. “All right!” he
called suddenly, beginning to descend once
more.

  In the meantime Jones had crawled
stiffly out, the box, wrapped in black oil-
cloth, projecting from his side pocket. But
he did not turn his back to David; sidling
along instead until he reached the path.
As Hogan approached the man, David
sprang forward, shouted and flung up an
arm. Instinctively Jones dodged and half
turned. In one great leap Hogan was on
him. David stood aside, detached, aloof,
almost as though he had no interest in the
outcome. There was something grotesque
about the struggle, so silent there in the

cool morning
air. They fell,
slipping down
the path al-
most to his
feet. The box
twisted from
Jones’ pocket
and lay apart
in a clump of
weed. Jones, though slighter, proved top
man. David’s hand came slowly from his
reefer gripping a big, blue automatic. For
some obscure reason he was smiling.

  “Soak him!" wheezed Hogan.

  Methodically David leaned down and
130

SHORT STORIES

smote Jones once at the base of his skull,
not very hard. Jones shivered, twitched
once or twice spasmodically, and relaxed
with a sigh.

  “Expert, eh?” grinned Hogan, getting
shakily to his feet. “Wisha, the felly’s
twice me strength; but that rap fixed him.
’Twas a two man job though Davy an’ no
mistake.”

  “Yes, it’s a two man job, all right; but

mebbe not the way-”

  “The box, Davy! In Hiwin’s name,
the— Ah, sure, an’ here we are!” He
made a lunge toward where it lay and be-
gan fumbling with the wrappings.

  “ ’Twill be a couple hunnerd thousand
or there’s snakes in Ireland,” he muttered.
“Whisht, lad! What ye doin’ ? C’mere!”
Working quickly and silently, David had
produced a coil of thin rope and was lash-
ing Jones’ arms behind his back in sailorly
fashion. Next he went rapidly through
the man’s pockets while Hogan tore at
the inner fastenings of the box, and trans-
ferred a considerable armory to his own
jacket. He was tapping Jones’ bulging
money belt when he heard Hogan gasp:
“Wirra, ’tis himself was crazy! There’s
nothin’ in the dom box at all, at all!”
“You’re right, Cap!” said David,
straightening, witb an amused glint in his
black eyes. “You’re probably right. He
was usin’ the box just to fool us.”

  “F-fool us?”

  “Likely. I’ll bet there’s a hundred
grand in stones in his money belt if there’s
a thin dime.”

  Hogan leaped to his feet.

  Jones stirred slightly and David looked
down to see the man’s filmy eyes fixed on
him with a stare of such insane venom that
he almost recoiled.

  “In a belt ye say? On him?” barked
Hogan, and dove for Jones’ prostrate body,
to fumble furiously at his waist.

  As calmly as though he were crushing
some annoying bug, David at once leaned
over and rapped Hogan sharply behind the
ear with his heavy gun butt. The Captain
slipped forward soundlessly across Jones’
chest; but the expresion of the man be-
neath changed not by so much as the twitch
of an eyelid.

  “What?” queried Jones softly while

David explored Hogan’s pockets. “What
is the idea, boy? You must be some op-
posed to splitting with your pals, eh? You
don’t think for a second you’re gonna get
by with this do you?”

  With another length of cord David was
tying the captain’s wrists as tightly as he
could pull. “That’s for a double-crosser,”
he muttered. The pain began to bring
Hogan arounid. “Why, yes, Jones, or
whatever your name is,” he went on, “you
might say I’m expectin’ to get away with
it.” He looked down at them and turning
Hogan over with his toe. “Yes, I guess
I’ll get away with it, O. K.”

  “You don’t know the gang you’re buck-
ing when you begin to mess me up!” Jones
spat out viciously. “I’ll follow you myself.”
Hogan’s eyes opened for a bewildered
moment. Then, through a purpling face,
he began to curse with fluency and vigor.

  “You follow me?” said David amusedly,
disregarding Hogan. “You follow me?
Why man, you’re plain nutty.”

  Hogan stopped swearing suddenly.
“Why, wha’ d’ ya mean, ye dirthy spal-
peen, ye double-crossin’ hijacker!” he
shouted.

  “That’ll be all of that!” snapped David.
“Get up, the both of you, and make it
snappy. C’mon!”

  “What the hell’s the idea?” snarled
Jones.

  David swept off his cap and ran a lean
hand through his black hair. “Why, this,”
he said pleasantly, “just this : you got two
big shipments through, Mister Jones. That
was plenty. So the Customs Service had
the Coast Guard plant a man in every fast
boat on Rum Row to kind of lay for you;
and, as far as the Laughing Lady goes, I’m
him! You sort of hit me as a hard to han-
dle baby, so I thought I’d just get Hogan’s
help on the job and then pinch him too.
The rest of the crew ain’t worth botherin’
with, or I’d wait for some of them to come
after the boat.”

  “Well, I’ll be domned!” gulped Hogan.
David made no answer; but the steady
whisper of the wind, tbe little ripples
around the worn piles of the wharf, and
the distant tonking of the bellbuoy blended
into the sound strangely like sardonic
laughter.

MESA

ALQNE WITH THE KILLER PABLO CLAUG IN THAT DESOLATE STORM BATTERED SHACK
AT PINTO MESA, LITTLE JINGLE THOMPSON FACED DEATH UNAFRAID, WITH A
STRANGE POWER OF HIS OWN GREATER THAN ALL OF PABLO’S BRUTAL STRENGTH

         GIANT mongrel, half Pima
         and half white, rode up to the

  / ^ door of a desert shack. His
/ ^ face, under the broad lop brim
of the sombrero, was a mask
of many emotions, of which, exhaustion,
fear and cunning were uppermost. The
high cheek bones, the slanting eyes of his
Indian breed, the flabby lips, the bristling
and brutal chin, these lineaments were
softened by a thick coating of alkali, mud-
died with his own sweat to a mask.

  He pounded at the door with his gloved
fist.

  A leather faced man with the narrowed
pupils common to the desert mucker,
opened the door, started back, collected his
wits and then grinned obsequiously. His
visitor was a famous man. What he asked
must be granted.

  “Let me. in here—hide me—feed me.
Water my cayuse—and water me. Pron-
to!”

  “You-all seem to be in a hurry, Pablo,”
the old mucker said genially. “Vyho’s
after you?"

  “Two hombres from that Thompson
outfit.”

  “You-all been shootin’ up them poor
Thompson^ agin?”
is

  Pablo lurched in, swigged eagerly from
the flask proffered him, fell into a chair
and began gobbling up the noonday meal
of flapjacks and bacon and coffee at which
his host had just been engaged. Between
mouthfulls he vouchsafed to explain.

  “Went up thar to their outfit to shoot
’em. Old man Thompson and his father
—that’s all that’s left of the outfit exceptin’
some young kid, who don’t count. If I’d
seen my chanct to plug the two men—that
would of finished the outfit.”

  “Didn’t git your chanct, Pablo? Oh,
jvell, wait till next time.”

  Pablo Claug swore fervently through
a mouthful of flapjacks. “I’d have got
’em if it hadn’t been for a Galloway bull
that chased me."

  “Shouldn’t sneak around them cow out-
fits too much on foot,” the old man coun-
selled sorrowfully.

  “I wasn’t on foot! It happened out on
the range. Weren’t nowheres near the
outfit.”

  “You mean a bull chased yer while you
was on hossback ? And you got skeered ?”
“I plugged him. Skeered? No, I
weren’t skeered. Never was skeered in
my life I admit a bull gits on my nerves,
same as a gila monster will on yourn. Was
tossed oncet, when I was a six-year-old.
Who wouldn’t be skeered, rememberin’
132

that? I plugged him. Forgot how these
here cattle will drift home to die, ef you-all
plug ’em in the belly.” He licked his lips.
“That thar’s where I like to plug a Gal-
loway bull.”

  He went on eating loudly, while his host
maintained a respectful silence, as if the
noise of his guest’s eating demanded at-
tention as much as his verbal pronouncia-
mentos.

  “You see the damned Galloway got back
to the ranch afore I got thar,” Pablo fin-
ished, “and word was spread around that
I was back agin. That’s how it happened.
Old Thompson and his father came gun-
nin’ for me. Picked up my trail at a
gamin’ house just this side of Mule Town
and I couldn’t shake ’em off all the way
down into the desert. They’re hot after
me now.” He snapped out the conclusion
to his narrative: “Give me a good shot
of likker.”

  The old mucker gave him a jug and a
tin cup.

  “Don’t see what you need to be afraid
of now, Pablo,” the host said. “That thar
red roan of yourn kin walk away from any
hoss of the Thompson outfit.”

  Pablo Claug drank. Then, smacking
his lips, he let the liquor take its slow burn-
ing course. A light came to his eyes.
They slanted, wrinkling.

  “Walk away?” he repeated. “Walk
away, did you say? How come you alius
want to be givin’ me an insult, you little
ole seedwart. Don’t appear like you know
me. I’m Pablo Claug. Why should I
walk away from Thompson—and his
toothless old father? I ain’t goin’ to walk
away from nobody.”

  The host reflected silently that Pablo
had shown evidence of fear and trembling
before taking that swig. But he held his
peace.

  “Now that Thompson and his father
have took the trouble to come all the way
down here to the desert rim where I want
them, I’ll fight ’em!”

  “Fight two men?” the other exclaimed.
It was hard to believe. For Claug had
never been known to fight two men to-
gether before.

  “Ain’t goin’ to fight ’em. Goin’ to kill
’em. And right here out in front of your
shack. In just about ten minutes.”

  Ten minutes! The old mucker went to
the door of his cabin and looked out toward
the horizon of mesas. On the scarp of the
granite hill nearest to him, he saw the sil-
houettes of two horsemen. A short zig-
zag ride down the face of the mesa, thence

across a boulder wash of the dry river,
and they would soon reach the adobe banks
just above his own diggings.

  Pablo Claug came and looked over his
shoulder.

  “You-all have been thinnin’ but them
Thompson’s cattle for a long time,” the
old mucker said. “Bein’, as you yourself
stipulate, them two is the last grown-up
men of the tribe, they’re goin’ to be power-
ful keerful. How come you’re offerin’ to
fight two desperate hombres of that thar
nature ?”

  Pablo Claug evidently had not listened.
He was staring at the crest of the adobe
banks a few hundred yards beyond the
sand windrows and sage patches outside
the door.

  “And remember this,” the host was
saying. “You cain’t expect a pore old man
like me to help you, much as I’d like to.

I	cain’t draw any too quick these days.
And besides, why should I draw on them
Thompsons anyways, and git plunked.
Me a pore, weak, ole seedwart, as you
yourself likes to call me?”

  “You don’t have to draw on no Thomp-
sons!” Pablo Claug answered. “But you
got to draw on me. And not only that,
you got to throw on me.”

  “Throw on you!” the other gasped. The
heat must have gotten the better of the big
gunman, despite the fact that he was a
breed.

  “I reckon you’re a good enough shot to
throw your gun on me—and miss?”

  “That thar looks easy, Pablo. But how
come you want me to raise my gun agin
you. I ain’t nothin’ gin you. I want to
be counted one of your friends. Wouldn’t
dast raise it agin you. No one in these
parts dast, ’ceptin’ only them Thompsons.”

  The sound of hoofs, as the two Thomp-
son men came galloping down -along the
pebbly trail of the boulder wash, struck in
upon the ears of Pablo and his old friend.

  “Quick now! Here’s my game,” the
breed said. “I’m goin’ to mount. Then

 I’m goin’ to ride around this here shack
 —like I was raidin’ you. When they come
 up to the top of that thar adobe bank and
 are pickin’ their way through the mesquite

                                                       10

for to ride down into the stream bed, then
you begin to pot at me out’n the window.
Be sure and aim good and high. Don’t
want ’em to see yer bullets kickin’ up the
dust. Aim for that greasewood, so’s they
won’t ricochet. Good and high mind you.
It’ll make it all the safer for me. Then,
suddenly, afore they come within range,
I’ll drop, pretendin' to be hit. I’ll fall on
the sand, lyin’ face down’rd. They’ll most
like ride up slow, dismount, and maybe
palaver with you, or maybe not. Won’t
make much difference. If they do, you
tell ’em I was after a bag of pay dirt you
got. Anything to make it look good. Then
when they come up to me to see just how
bad I’m hit, I’ll blaze away at ’em.”

  The old man’s lips trembled to an un-
comfortable smile. “I’ve helped a lot of
men, both reckless and keerful, in my days
out here, in the desert,” he said, “but I
never met up with anyone so all-fired keer-
ful as you! Hate to cold-deck two honest
gents like them Thompsons.”

  “If you don’t like it, mebbe in this here
sham fight of ourn I might do some
honest-to-God sharp shootin' on you, in-
stead of pretendin’!”

  This settled the problem. The old
mucker did not spend another moment in
weighing the moral aspects of the act.
Pablo Claug was the king of the desert.
His word was law, and the old mucker
prided himself on being a "peaceful law-
abiding man.”

  “All right, Pablo. Anything you says
must be right!”

  “And mind, aim good and high? If I
see them shots ricocheting too close to my

roan’s feet-”

  There was an idea! If the old mucker
could only have reacted to that touch of
divine inspiration! Why not actually
shoot Pablo Claug in this sham fight!

  But no! He load nothing against Pablo.
If he raised a hand against him he would
win nothing, and perhaps lose everything.

  There was Pablo Claug, now mounted
and galloping his roan in a wide circle
around the little cabin. It had the same
effect on the old mucker, as they say a cir-
cle drawn in the sand has upon a horned
toad. It hypnotized him.

' He began emptying a volley of fire.
The shots smashed loudly into the thin
quiet air, mingling with the growing clat-
ter of horse’s hoofs. The Thompsons
were already at the crest of the adobe
banks.

  “Good men, them Thompsons,” the old
mucker said. “But they’re reckless. Pablo

ain’t. And I’m with the strongest side.”
His sixth shot rang out. And he had
been very careful to aim all six high in the
air.

II

THE two riderS drew up their mounts
at the edge of the adobe bank and
looked down toward the mucker’s
shack. The dry river bed stretched below
them, a furlong or so across, with the
shack in the middle, an ore-crusher near
by, and a small corral surrounded by giant
boulders and stretches of sand and sage.
Across this little scene went the white
flashes of fire from two six-guns.

“What-all’s happenin’?” the older of the
two men, Blink Thompson, said. “All as

I	kin see is a rider circlin’ that ’air cabin.”
“It’s Pablo Claug himself,” Blink
Thompson’s son replied. “He’s got into
some argument with an hombre inside.”
“Good enough. Now’s the time to pot
him,” old Thompson cried. “Kin you git
that range? Too fur for me. My eye’s
too bleary. You kin do it. Now’s your
chance.”

“Too far for anything sure. We’ll
leave our cayuses here and git down a bit
closer to him behind them there boulders.”
They dismounted, letting their horses
stand with reins dragging.

  “Hulloa there!” the younger Thompson
cried. “He’s hit!”

  “Who’s hit? What’s happened? Pablo
Claug stretched another victim ? The
yellow-livered son of a skunk!”

  “No, it’s Pablo Claug that’s hit!”

  The old man shaded his weak, watery
eyes. “Cain’t see. What’s that roan
trottin’ off for, without its rider? What-
all’s happened!”

  “It’s Pablo Claug been hit! Damme if
he ain’t stretched good and proper. Rolled
to the sand off’n his saddle. Wrigglin’
like a chuckawalla that’s been stepped 011!”
Ned Thompson gave vent to a joyful
shout. “We’re free, b’God! Do you git
that, Dad ? Pablo Claug ain’t goin’ to per-
secute us no more! Free! Come on!”
He leaped down through the mesquite,
unmindful of the tearing thorns, jumping
over the low patches, picking out the short-
est route through the dense brush. His
aged father stumbled slowly along after
him, gun in hand, mumbling as he went.

  “Look out thar, now, son! Don’t be
reckless! I know a thing or two about
gun-fightin’. You’re too all-fired reckless.
Easy now! Don’t try to bust through
mesquite thetaway!”

  The son had come out on the open river
bed, and for a moment having no protec-
tion, he paused. His father’s warnings
came in breathless and excited treble.

  “I tell you, son, watch out! Find out
who lives in that ’air mucker’s cabin first!
Some locoed hermit mebbe. Most like
he’ll take a pot at you!”

  “Whoever he is, he’s a friend of ourn!”
the son cried joyfully. “He’s bumped off
the yellowest coyote ever chawed off a
cow’s nose!”

  The “hermit” had come out to the door
of his shack, now, and standing in full
view of the two newcomers, he waved.

  “It’s all right!” young Thompson said.
He looked over to the form of Pablo Claug
lying in the sand, head toward the shack,
one arm pinned awkwardly under his body,
the other, his right, lying out with palm
upward, in the blazing sand. It looked pre-
cisely as if his six-gun had fallen from his
hand, and he had died in the act of clutch-
ing the empty air.

  “Hulloa thar, pard!” young Thompson
called out. “What-all does this mean!
You sure will be a hero in my eyes, from
this day on!”

  The mucker came down from his shack.

  “Just a disagreement. He come after
me, thinkin’ to stick me up. He seen I
ben doin’ some pannin’ here. It’s Pablo
Claug. You know him, mebbe. Got a
sting in him wors’n a rattler.” He dropped
his voice. “A rattler’ll stay alive till sun-
set, you know that there superstition,
hombre ?”

  But the warning was not loud enough.
The old muckef, loath as he was to see a
man shot down practically in cold blood
before his very eyes, did not dare to op-
pose the great Pablo Claug.

  The tragedy, inevitable as it was hor-
rible, came. The mucker saw it, and if
he hadn’t been used to such sights dur-
ing his fifty years in the desert, he would
have covered his eyes. And the older man
off there in the mesquite brush saw it, even
though his eyes were dim.

  A flash of light, a report. It looked as
if a white tongue of fire had leaped out
from directly underneath the prostrate
Pablo’s chin. The simile of the rattler
was perfect.

  Thompson’s hand went to his chest.
His head went back, as if some invisible
hand had timed an uppercut on his chin.
His knees sagged, his gun flipped from his
hand; he sank forward face downward in
a patch of rattleweed.

  Pablo Claug knew that this was no sim-

ulation of being hit. The man was hit be-
yond any shadow of doubt. Pablo knew
it; the old mucker knew it; the white
haired, bleary-eyed frontiersman who was
the father, knew it.

  The latter ducked into the protection of
two boulders and opened fire. The carcass
of Pablo Claug came to life, arose, ran off
towards his horse. Over his shoulder he
hurled a string of fire towards the boulders
and mesquite brush from which the father
Thompson was firing. A bullet passed the
breed’s head, like the crack of a whip.
Another ripped through his tall peaked
sombrero. A fear gripped the big half-
breed. He realized suddenly that he was
in the open, and his adversary was under
cover. But this was not what routed him:
It was the fear of facing the father of the
man he had shot. He vaulted to the sad-
dle of his horse and hit the trail.

  Old Thompson came out, stricken with
rage and grief. He had given his best in
the fight, but his best no longer counted.
He had a steady hand, an indomitable
strength of wiry body, a heroic spirit. But
his eyes were dimmed by many years of
squinting at desert suns. No use. He
had come to help his son, with his wisdom,
and his courage, but he had failed.

  Both the father and the old mucker ran
toward the fallen man. The former turned
him about carefully. He felt for the
wound, held a flask to the half-opened lips.

  “He ain’t done for yit!” the mucker
said.

  The father turned upon the speaker with
an oath. “He was cold-decked, be God!

And you know it!
You ole, toothless
coyote! My son
was cold-decked.
You wasn’t fight-
in’! You was
stallin’! And ef
m y son dies—
you’re goin’ t o
pay, the same as
Pablo Claug’s go-
in’ to pay!”

  “He ain’t goin’
to die, Mister!”
the mucker whim-
pered.

  The father snatched the flask from him,
and tipped it to the wounded man’s lips.
The eyes flickered.

  “Take me back,” he whispered finally.
“I ain’t through fightin’ by a long shot.
But not now. I want to be back with—
my boy.”

  The aged father thrust his powerful
arm under the man’s head.

  “Only a crease, that’s all, I swear, Dad.
But I want to see my boy, right away.
He’s only a young kid, Dad. Your grand-
son. We got to git to him quick. I want
to warn him what we-all are fightin’
against. Not against a man, but against
a rattler.”

Ill

I

THE third generation of the Thomp-
son outfit was a slender gray eyed
boy of nineteen who seemed as
much out of place in the cow country as
an ocotillo blossom in the desert. He was
a very peculiar character. No one under-
stood him. Some called him a poet. “Jin-
gle” was his nickname. For he had a
habit of writing poems to adorn the walls
of the cantinas. Most of the barkeeps and
gamblers, in fact, were his friends. They
had his sonnets about “Spring in the Can-
yons, the fragrance of sage, the wind in
the mesas,” and the rest of his favorite
topics written upon the mirrors behind the
bar.

  Totally oblivious of the fact that his
father and his aged grandfather had gone
gunning for their enemy, this boy was
singing one of his odes, accompanying
himself on a banjo, while the cantina girls,
miners and stockmen thumped out a Texas
Tommy to his rhythm. Jingle Thompson
was really a very popular citizen of Mule
Town. But he was popular in a disagree-
able way: as Domingo the Humpback was
popular, for instance, among the gamblers.
Domingo brought luck to you at cards, if
you rubbed his back. Jingle was popular
and pitied, and, in a manner of speaking
despised.

  And the reason for Jingle Thompson’s
being despised was this: he had sedulously
refused to learn how to fire a six-gun.
This was supposed to be due to some
promise he had made to his mother, a
promise which his father made him keep.
Nevertheless a man who refuses to touch
a six-gun does not command much respect
in Mule Town and the ranges about Soda
Mesa. A man must not crawl behind a
promise to his mother and thus save his
hide. That was the philosophy of Mule
Town’s stockmen and gamblers. Every
boy promises his mother not to fight. But
does that let him out?

  And now at the climax of his merry-
making at Cal Martin’s Cantina some-
thing happened. When the dance was
over, an old mucker from the desert shuf-

fled across the sawdust covered floor, drew
his gun and aimed it at the floor of the
platform where Jingle Thompson was
seated, playing and singing.

  “Now do that ’air song to the tune of
my gun,” he rasped out shrilly. “Don’t
sing it, nor don’t play it. Just dance it!”
“Why the hell should I dance to your
gun?” Jingle Thompson asked quietly,
focusing his gray eyes upon the grizzled
old man.

  The man seemed to be struck with the
deadly calmness of the boy’s look. He
hesitated just a moment before opening
fire.

  “Don’t touch that boy, you!” the boun-
cer called out. “You cain’t pick a fight
with him. He never fights!”

 “Ah, that’s it!” The old mucker
laughed. “I cain’t touch him because it is
generally known he don’t carry a six-gun.
Cain’t shoot a man who’s known to be
busted. You’re like them weaklings in the
Zuni tribes which calls theirselves Klath-
manas and does the work of women in-
stead of goin’ 011 the warpath. In plainer
terms, kid, you’re yaller!”

  Neither the bouncer, nor the bar keep,
nor the deputy sheriff, nor any acquain-
tance of Jingle Thompson seemed disposed
to contradict the irate old gentleman from
the desert.

  “Play us another tune, Jingle. The old
kook is locoed, or drunk. Forgit him.”
But Jingle did not take his eye from his
accuser. “Am I yeller because I won’t
pull a trigger? It’s the man who goes
around town ready to protect himself by
killing, who’s yeller.”

  This was a particularly unhappy state-
ment as it insulted practically every man
at the gaming tables, as well as at the bar.
There was a grumble of anger throughout
the smoke befogged room.

  “Look here, kid,” the desert mucker
said, “if you don’t shoot your enemies, just
what-all do you do with ’em?”

  “Forgive ’em. Make ’em my pards.
Give ’em my hand! Take a drink with
’em. Forgit the wrong. Go on enjoyin’
life!”

  The grumble of the assembled bar
guests lightened to scoffing. The old
mucker spat. He looked at the gray wide
open eyes with every mark of contempt,
and then snarled out, “You’d give your
hand to a man who’s done you wrong?
You yaller skunk! What ef he wouldn’t
take yer hand? What if he stayed yer
enemy ?”

  “I’d find a way to reach him. ,There’s
136

SHORT STORIES

something good in the worst man.”

  “By good you mean he could under-
stand yer lousy pomes?” the mucker
scoffed. This brought a good laugh from
the bar.

  “Yes, I mean that!” Jingle cried hotly.
“They’s poetry in every man’s carcass.
Don’t care if he’s a greaser or gunman!
They’s pomes inside him somewheres, and
I’d git him thataway!”

  Again the mucker spat. “What if it
was some hombre as plugged your own
father? Would you try pomes with him?”
The question nettled young Jingle. For
a moment the gang of stockmen and min-
ers waited upon his answer. The cantina
girls who were always on his side, for
some peculiar sentimental reasons under-
standable only to womankind, peered
eagerly under the fans of the hanging
lamps, at the boy’s handsome face. That
was a question!

  Jingle frowned. His philosophy had
never embraced the existence of revenge.
It rejected it, as for instance some relig-
ions reject tbe .existence of disease. He
resorted to his bible—that is to say his
pack of fortune teller’s cards.

  Many prophecies in time past had come
from the boy’s pack of cards! Cowmen

had said that
since he was ten
years old he
had prognosti-
cated drought,
storm or rinder-
pest with the
uncanny certainty of the Indian shaman
and medicine men of the county.

  Still they waited for his answer. The
old mucker, breathing sniffling, swayed
belligerently where he stood in tbe middle
of the dance floor. There was the sound
of poker chips, the tinkle of a glass. A
cowboy’s spurs clicked. Then Jingle
Thompson gave his answer. .

  “I turned up a spade here. Which it
says the blood of my kin has been shed.”
“That thar’s a damned good guess,
boy!” the old mucker laughed. “I said if
your father was plugged! Didn’t I ?
Damned good trick of yourn to guess what
I’m drivin’ at! Well and good, young Mr.
Snivelin’ Coyote! Your dad was plugged
down thar!” He pointed toward the des-
ert. “Now kin you-all answer my ques-
tion ?”

  The boy paled, coming irresolutely to
his feet. “My father! You say my

father-”

  “Now do you want this here gun?” the

mucker cried triumphantly. “Now are
you goin’ to give your enemy your hand,
and call him pard!”

  “My father—where- What’s hap-
pened? Plugged you say? In a gun-
fight!” He covered his ashen, horrified
mouth with his hand. “No, no, not that!
Not killed? Tell me—quick—who did it?”
“Pablo Claug!”

  The cantina was in an uproar. The
proprietor, Big Cal Martin, came from a
gaming table, ey e-shade on forehead,
sleeves rolled up. Loo Yung, the cook,
came from his hot dog stand in the corner.
The barkeep leaned across the bar with a
grim interest.

  Another victim for Pablo Claug! Pablo
the cruel and the powerful, the wolf of
the Bad Lands, the bully of all muckers!
Pablo, the pet fear of old Sheriff Bendley!

  Then there rose a champion. Not the
Sheriff—he was too old and too diplo-
matic. Not the sheepmen—Pablo left
them alone. Not the prospectors—Pablo
gave them immunity from his Papago
henchmen. No! The champion who pre-
sented himself was a frail, banjo-playing
youth—a fortune teller and writer of cow-
boy ballads, a poet who did not know how
to load a gun or squeeze a trigger.

  “I’ll git him!” Jingle Thompson said to
the crowd.

  His gesture of revenge was so futile that
a cowpuncher in the background laughed.
It started a snickering that went like a
rustle of leaves over the whole gang.

  “Git him? How?” The old mucker
guffawed. “With yer pomes!”

  The humpback Domingo gave a giggling
rasp. “You think Pablo Claug has po’try
in his carcass?”

  “Every man, so the kid says, has po’try
in him!” laugbed the barkeep.

  “Not Pablo Claug!” cried another.

  “Yes, he has, so help me God!” Jingle
Thompson cried frantically, turning upon
his persecutors. “He’s got it in him, damn
you all! And I’ll git him—thatazvay!”

  In the silence with which Mule Town
accepted this peculiar dictum of their
youthful prophet, Jingle turned to the
desert mucker:

“Tell me, old pard, where is my father?”
“He’s bein’ toted up from Saddle Creek
from my diggin’s. I seen the whole fight.
Your grandfather’s totin’ him home. No,
he ain’t daid yet, son.”

  Jingle pulled his sombrero down over
his eyes, hitched up his trousers, and
walked out to his horse.

  When he was gone, one man turned to

                                                         10

another and said, “What-all did thet kid
mean when he said he’d git Pablo Claug
thataway?”

  “He meant every man’s got po’try and
good in him. And he’ll work on Claug
thataway.”

  “Well the yaller livered son of a jack
rabbit!” the other snorted. “Goin’ to
make friends with the man as plugged his
father!”

  “You cain’t alius tell.”

IV

WHEN Jingle arrived at the little
group of shacks, calf sheds, and
corrals that composed the Thomp-
son cow outfit, he found that old “Blink”
Thompson had already arrived, bringing
with him the wounded man, Jingle’s
father. A Mexican mozo was hobbling
about excitedly attending to the horses;
and his wife, a mountainous half-breed,
weeping and hysterical, was bringing
water from the pump for her master’s
wounds. Both the ranch hands were act-
ing like two chickens after a hawk has
made a raid on the coop.

  The hawk was Pablo Claug. And his
law among all the renegades and breeds
and Mexicans of that range was that if he
declared war on an enemy no man must
come to that enemy’s assistance. Very
shortly after Jingle came home, the two
ranch hands had fled.

  Jingle went into the main ranch house.
And his grandfather, upon seeing him,
looked at him as if he had completely for-
gotten the fact of the boy’s existence.
There had been a gunfight. And when
gunfights were concerned, Jingle Thomp-
son ceased to exist. The gaunt, old fron-
tiersman looked down upon the boy as if
trying to recall who he was. Then it
seemed to come to him. Yes, this was the
little cottontail they called “Jingle.” This
was his son’s son! No, by Heaven! He
would not believe it! He was every inch
of him a replica of Ned Thompson’s wife.
The boy looked like Ned, the grandfather
admitted, but in his nature, he was every
bit a woman! He dismissed him with a
snap.

  “Git in there, you! And take a look at
yer dad!”

  Jingle needed no prodding. He brushed
by the old fierce-looking cowman, hurried
into his father’s bunk-room, and fell down
by his side.

  “It’s all righto, son!” the father said
cheerfully. “Don’t worry. It’ll take some
time, but I’ll be all righto. Just a crease,
it

Cain’t do any more fightin’. You see what
comes of pickin’ a gunfight just because
of a ole Galloway bull as was shot. Re-
member what yer Maw said afore she died.
We ain’t livin’ here to be gunmen. Too
many gunmen as it is. The West’s
changin’, little by little. We’re in a corner
that ain’t changed yit. But you’re the kind
we’re goin’ to have here when the gun-
men’s thinned out.”

  Jingle did not answer. Many thoughts
were whirling through his mind. His
mother must have been right. She had
made him one man in a community who
could live without a trigger-finger always
itching. She must be right. But she had
left out that little point about revenge.
There was no revenge in her heart.

  “I wanted to git back quick, soil, so’s I
could warn you of something,” the father
went on. “Thought mebbe there’d be
ranklin’ inside of you for to go and even
up this here score. Well, you ain’t goin’!
I’m tellin’ you that straight. If you go
after Pablo Claug you’ll git killed. Don’t
reckon I’d git well if I know’d that, son.
What’s more, the fear that you might git
killed by Claug has made me come to a
decision. We-all are goin’ to leave this
ranch. Once Pablo Claug gits it in for

anyone, he
don’t let u p.
Look at the
way he fin-
ished up the
Circle M Out-
fit. Picked ’em
off one by one,
snipe - shootin’
at ’em. Even
the Sheriff
stays out’n his way because he’s got all the
renegades in the desert on his side. Yes,
they’s a reward out for him, but no one
dast go after him. He never shoots you
straight face to face. Alius in the back.
They say he alius finishes up his enemy
because he’s afraid to let ’em live, same
as when you half kill a rattler when yer
campin’ on the range. Yer can’t sleep
at night till yer go out and find what’s
left of him and bury him. That’s Pablo
Claug’s way. And that’s what I’m
avoidin’.”

  “You mean for my sake, Dad, yer givin’
up our ranch?” the boy asked piteously.
“You mean we’ve got to run away.”

  The wounded father winced under this.
He wouldn’t run away, not if twenty Pablo
Claugs were after him. In fact, did he not
go into the desert after Pablo Claug? But
SHORT STORIES

when his son was considered, the son who
was the only living and tangible thing re-
maining of his dead wife, then he looked
at the whole affair in a different light.

  “I’m goin’, son,” he said conclusively,
“because I know damned well, Pablo will
come after you!”

  “But look here, Dad-”

  “No, no more! I’m gittin’ weak. Give
me a swig. There now! Git out.” He
called him back by putting up his shaking
hand: “One thing else, son! You pack
up a grubstake and saddle Black Diablo,
and right now you take the trail up to
Eagle Fan Mesa. Our cousin “Smoo”
Thompson’ll take keer of ye until I come.
Which I promise to come in a day or two.
Now git! Hell!” He groaned with the
pain in his shoulder. “Damn this! If I
only had the strength—God Almighty, I’d
shore git him!” .Another groan, and he
looked up, seeing the boy still kneeling be-
side him. “Git out of here, damn you!
Are you-all goin’ to disobey me at a time
like this! Git. And saddle Black Diablo,
he’s the fastest.” He sank to the pillow.
“You’ll need a fast horse. God! Give
me—give me my strength again—to fight!”

OLD Blink Thompson found his
grandson some few minutes later,
down in the coral, saddling Black
Diablo. Black Diablo, the best little bronc
on the outfit! The fastest on a rough trail,
the longest winded, the surest of foot in
riding down deep arroyos or up the rocky
sides of mesas and lomas.

  Blink Thompson stepped up behind the
boy, grabbed his arm and whirled him
about toward him.

  “So you’re doin’ what yer dad told you
to! Ay!” the gaunt old frontiersman
snorted disgustedly. “Oh. yes, I heard it all.
Was just outside the bunk room. Heard
him tell you to beat it to where Pablo won’t
git you!” He clutched the boy by the
scruff of the neck, fairly lifting him from
his feet and looking into his face. “Look
here, you! Don’t you know your dad’s
out’n his head with that thar crease
bleedin’? Do you think in his right mind
he’d want to give up this here ranch, sell
out, and run away? Hell no! You know
your dad. He’s doin’ it for you. He’s
actin’ like a mother to you, bein’ you ain’t
got one. For the time bein’ he’s weak and
sick and womanish!”

  “I ain’t goin’!” Jingle muttered angrily.
“Ain’t goin’? Oh no, it don’t look like
it, does it now? What-all air you saddlin’
that bronc for then?”

  “Leave me alone. Leave me play my
own game.”

  The grizzled man peered intently into
the boy’s face. For all Blink. Thompson’s
dim sightedness, his bleary eyes had a
peculiar fire in them. From his many
years staring at desert sunsets, it seemed
as if he had developed a new sight, sharper
far than the vision of younger men. For
a moment the grandfather’s and the
youth’s eyes were alike—wells of limitless
passion and wisdom.

  “Look here, boy! Do I see a yaller
coyote before me, or do I see a man with
my own blood coursin’ in his veins. The
West has changed since my time, but here’s
one day taken out’n my own past. If
you’re my grandson, there’s one thing only
for you to do: You got to live this here;
day like it was fifty ytar ago! This here
corner of Arizony is the same like the
frontier was in my day! You’re me, all
over agin! Git that ? And ef you-all
don’t do what I would of done, then from,
now on you ain’t my grandson but only a
yaller coyote!”

  “Leave me alone, I said. I’m playin’
my own hand! You quit ridin’me!”

  The grandfather burst out in a volley
of oaths. He yanked the boy away from
the strap he was cinching and pulled him
out in the open corral. It looked for all
the world as if he were going to give the
boy a flogging. Or perhaps worse, for
the irate old fellow actually drew out his
six-gun.

  “They call you Jingle Thompson, don’t
they, you little calf-eyed wart! Jingle!
■That’s a fine name for a grandson of
mine! They call one of my kin Jingle be-
cause he writes ‘pomes’ about the drifts
of tumbleweed and the palo santo and the
cactus wren! Zowie!”

  “What-all are you goin’ to do, for hell’s
sake? Shoot me?”

  “I ought to! If you was in a gunfight
you’d know what real honest-to-God
pomes there are in real life. Palo santo,
yah!” he spat disgustedly. “Gunshootin’
with a flash of white fire and a man saggin’
to the alkali sand, that’s pomes! That’s
what’d awake somethin’ in your car-
cass !”

  The boy tried to writhe from the vise
grip but he couldn’t. Old Blink still had a
giant’s strength.

  “You never got in a fight, did you? You
never so much as asked me how to fan a
gun, did you? You never so much as
asked me how to clean it, how to throw it

                                                        10

on a Mex. You never knew that when you
aim you get the top of this here front sight
settin’ on a Mex or a stallion and you get
it in the notch of this here sight, with equal
daylight a-showin’ on both sides. You
never knew that you should orter press
on the trigger slowly, not pull it! Press
it back, not sideways. Hell! You’d close
your eyes if the trigger didn’t pull sweet!
You’d flinch if the pull was creepy and
you were waiting too long for this here
deadly weapon to kick! Bah! What do
you care about it, anyway! You care more
about your stars. Haw! Haw! Haw!”
“No,” the boy said sulkily. “You said
if I ever touched it I’d blow out my
brains.”

  “And this holster. I’ll bet if you tried
to put it on you’d get yourself all tangled
up, like the way you harness a mule. Here,

you—let me show you-”

  “What are you puttin’ it on me for?”
“This-away! Fasten it on the belt, and
anchor the belt so’s it’ll always be in the
same place,” the grandfather went on,
“so’s you could yank out the old shootin’
iron and throw it on a man within a
second.”

  Jingle Thompson looked down at the
holster, that- had been buckled on- him. He
fingered it awkwardly, his brow wrinkling,
his gray eyes narrowing. He unbuttoned
the flap, started to pull out.the shooting-
iron. But it stuck. He looked up again
into his grandfather’s face.

  “What and the hell is this here contrap-
tion for! I don’t need it! Don’t want it!
Couldn’t use it, if.I had it!”

  “I told you just now how to use it! If
that ain’t enough then go on and git out!

Vamose! Git off’n
this rancho. You
don’t belong here
with menfolk. G o
up to the Zunis and
make a klathmana
out’n yorself; they
kin use you for
weavin’ blankets and
cookin’ of their meal
cakes!”

  The boy fumbled
nervously, uncer-
tainly, with the buckle of bis holster.
There must have been some trick to it.
Always is a trick to these things! Finally
he gave it up as a bad job. He would wait
until he was free from that burning gaze
of his grandfather. He turned to his
bronc.

  The father watched him cinching the
  10

saddle again, so viciously that the bronc
turned to bite him.

  The youth mounted, swung off, and gal-
loped his horse toward the corral gate.

  “Keep that there deadly weapon with
you, boy!” the grandfather called after
him. “They’s lots of jack rabbits on the
way up to your cousin’s outfit. And jack
rabbits is right dangerous animals! I
mean comparatively speakin’!”

  “I ain’t goin’ up to my cousin’s ranch!”
the boy shouted angrily. “I made up my
mind long afore you started razzin’ me,
where I’m goin’.”

  The old man shaded his eyes as he saw
his grandson heading down for the desert
trail.

  “Consarn my eyesight!” he grumbled.
“Cain’t see that he’s takin’ the trail up
no’th like his father told him!” He
strained his eyes looking down through the
cow-barns, the corrals, the bunkshed to-
wards the sage plain to the south. “What-
all is he ridin’ thet-away for ?”

  Although old Blink Thompson’s eyes
were none too good, his ears were phe-
nomenal. He could hear the hoof beats
of Jingle’s horse striking on the pebbles
of the stream bed. It was from the direc-
tion of the canyon. Now the' sound drifted
away as the horse went clattering down
towards the canyon floor.

  That canyon, old Blink knew, had only
one opening—ten miles further down.
And that was the desert.

  “I heard him say he’d made up his
mind! the grandfather exclaimed with a
sudden burst of exultation. “Make up his
mind to what? I know, by hell! The
young ’un’s goin’ to trail Pablo Claug!”
The aged frontiersman swung his
scrawny burned fist in the air with a
whoop, as if he wanted all the mesas, the
sage plains, the canyons and gulches to
join him in his cheer.

  “I knew, it! I knew it! These here ole
bleary eyes of mine kin see what other men
can’t! I knew he was of my blood. My
son’s son! That’s what he is! He’s goin’
to kill Pablo Claug!”

  He rushed back to the ranch house.
“I’m goin’ to tell his paw! So help me,
it’ll make his paw well!” He paused.
“No, I can’t do that. The boy’s goin’ to
git killed. He can’t fight Pablo Claug. I
mustn’t tell his paw. He’s goin’ to git
killed!”

With a different expression on his wind-
burned, heavily seamed face the old man
gazed again towards the canyon. All he
140

could see was a deep black gash in the
breast of the plain.

  “Goin’ to git killed!” For the first time
in his life, old Blink Thompson knew what
fear was. He had never felt it for him-
self. But now his great courageous heart
began to beat like a frightened bird’s.

  For if the truth must be told, he loved
the boy. No matter how strong, no matter
how despicably weak, the boy was his son’s
son.

V

INGLE THOMPSON trailed all
during the earlier part of the night
while the moon was up. A supper at
a water hole and a few hours sleep, then
a short ride during the cool of the morning
brought him into the lower reaches of the
valley.

  Here the chasms deepened. It was a
region where it seemed the cool night air
of the plains was never admitted. Many
days of blistering heat were imprisoned
there. Finally there appeared at the end
of the valley a narrow vertical slit between
two precipices, beyond which was a red
glare—the desert and the sun. It was like
looking into the mouth of a furnace.

  Here in a remote arroyo an Indian
shaman lived in a shack. In his earlier
boyhood Jingle Thompson had come to this
man somewhat as a disciple going to a
shrine in the wilderness; he had taught
Jingle many things, some of which be-
longed to the trapper’s lore, some of which
belonged to the lore of the Bad Mind and
the Cold Hand; some Jingle accepted,
some he refused. He taught him how to
make milk out of corn, how to paint hides
with the juice of prickly pear, how to stim-
ulate his sight with the peyote plant, how
to make medicine out of the spider bean.
And likewise he taught him to read the
stars, to understand the call of coyote, of
buzzard, of the wind. He taught him
songs to the tune of his jesako drum and
he gave him the sacred turtle bones, which
if swallowed, would give him power to see
into the body of the sick.

  The Indian hermit came down to the
canyon bed through which the trail wound.
He stood there, a giant with the heat
shimmering about him. His mane of white
hair glistening in the sun crowned with
a dazzling sort of glory the ragged and un-
kempt figure. Except for that stature and
that silvery hair, he was an ordinary Pima
renegade, with shirt hanging out, sleeves
tucked up with armbands of fawn skin;

trousers hanging in torn shreds; mummied
feet bare, dried, gnarled.

  Jingle Thompson dismounted and said,
“Jesako, you have told me everything in
the world, everything in the sky above the
world. But now I’ve trailed down this-
away once more to ask you a question.
And you kin answer. No doubt about it.
Beat on your drum! Git your turtle
bones. Swallow ’em! Bring down the ole
stars out’n heaven for to do your biddin’!
And answer me this: Where is Pablo
Claug?”

  “What need of the stars?” the shaman
said. “The halfbreed Claug is hiding be-
low Pinto Mesa. A kinsman of mine
trailing up to Cobb’s Coulee with baskets
to sell told me.”

  “Good, Jesako. You’ve told me what
nobody else in die desert dast tell me.
You’ve told me where Claug is at! And
I’m goin’ to kill him.”

  The old shaman’s eagle eyes looked
piercingly at the boy’s face. Then he
nodded as if to say, “Yes, I see! You
have murder in your heart.” Without
changing the expression of his deeply
wrinkled face, he said aloud, “Any man
dast tell you where Pablo Claug hides.
Because Pablo Claug himself will laugh
when you find him. And after he laughs
he will take your life.”

  “I don’t know about that. My cards
don’t say that. Hunted all through my
pack over and over agin for that statement,
and it ain’t there.”

  “Then the desert will take your life.

I	have seen many signs ever since the Time
of Ripe Acorns, that we are to have a great
storm. And today the signs multiply.”
“Thought I felt that in my bones,” Jin-
gle admitted. “But what of it, Jesako?
I’ve been in a desert storm before. None
of your tribe ever got skeered of a little
wind and a couple clouds of sand. Let her
come! The hell with it!”

  “This kinsman of mine, this basket
weaver who saw Pablo
Claug, tells me that the
heat is very great down
there by the Sierra del
Aja. It is a sign likewise.
Pablo Claug, hiding in his
canyon, does not leave the
shack which is his hiding
place, because of the great heat.”

 “Good enough for me, Jesako! So
much the easier. I’ll go up to his door
and knock, so help me God, and I’ll say,
‘Here’s Jude Thompson son of Ned

Thompson, the man you plugged.’ And
then I’ll-”

  The old Cloud-Swallower watched the
youth, no sign of surprise or incredulity
coming over his face. But Jingle himself
darted back an angry look.

  “You think I won’t kill him, ay?” He
hitched up his trousers in the belligerent
swagger of a boy. And in doing so his
hands touched his holster.

  Yes, he still wore that holster. He had
been many a time down that canyon with-
out a gun, but now for once he clung to it:
it was a half superstitious, half sceptical
feeling he had towards it. Very much for
instance as the feeling a negro sustains to-
wards the rabbit’s foot he carries tucked
away. A foolish little talisman, no possible
good to anyone; but then why go against
the superstitions of many years? Besides,
Jingle’s grandfather had given him that
gun. And his grandfather was always
right.

  “You think I ain’t good enough to kill
him, ay?” he went on threateningly. “Well,
then, why does my card pack tell me I
will ? And why do them stars which you
taught me to read—and which all last
night I was palaverin’ with—why do they
say I’ll kill him?”

  The old shaman nodded. Such things
had happened. This youth had all the
strength of the mesas and the Sierras be-
hind him. They were on his side.

  “Look here, I’ll tell you how I’m goin’
to git him. I’m goin’ to skeer him. They
say he gits skeered easy, don’t they ?
Never kills a man outright. Plugs him in
the back, or else lyin’ down. This time
he lay down pretendin’ he was daid, and
then plugs my father. A lot of imagina-
tion he’s got—that’s what I hear is the
right name for it. Imagination! Same as
I have. Only I write pomes with mine,
and he bumps off his enemies with his’n.
Well, this time, it’s my imagination agin
his’n.”

  “The heat—the storm—” The shaman
was shaking his head with its straight
mane of coarse hair. “Is your mind
greater than the mind of the storm—of
the sierras—of the Hot Hand?”

  “Damn right it is!” Jingle said shaking
his fist, like a boy making a swollen and
futile oath. But the shaman did not smile.
Again the eagle eyes pierced into the
lyouth. And again he nodded his white head.

  “This hombre Pablo Claug, it is true, is
a coward. He fears everything which his
grandmother, a Pima witch, feared. But
he will not fear you.”

     10

  “He won’t, ay?” the boy cried. “Why,
look here, he got so all-fired scairt of a
Galloway bull that he plugged him in the
belly! How’s that for bein’ plain adobe
yaller!”

  The Indian held up his hand, a withered
mummy hand whose gesture no man could
disobey. “Listen to this, white child ! He
is afraid of bulls because when young he
was tossed. But what of that? Can you
take a Galloway into the arroyos? A bull
may fright this man. But a child like
you—” Now the hard deep wrinkles, the
piercing eyes, the hook nose, the adaman-
tine countenance, seemed to soften. Jingle
Thompson was the one white man in the
world who understood this shaman’s re-
ligion. He could not forbear giving him
warning: “You may laugh at Pablo
Claug, even though he has the strength of
seven men. But can you laugh at the
fires of the canyon ? Can you laugh at the
sandstorm and the desert whirlwind?” -
“Good God,” the boy fairly screamed,
“the canyons are on my side! And so’s
the desert, the heat, the sand! Them’s my
weapons! I’ll use ’em! If I cain’t git
Pablo Claug with this here contraption on
my hip, I’ll turn the fire of hell agin him
—which is the desert!”

  The white head nodded slowly. “Yes,
it is true. Ever since you were born the
canyons and the wind—and the mesas—
they have been on your side!”

VI

JINGLE followed the witch doctor into
his shack. Many a time before the
old sage had given the boy refresh-
ment for body and soul.

  “I’m goin’ to wait till the time’s ripe,”
Jingle said. “When the desert’s so hot
you cain’t see and when the vultures begin
to escape to the Sierra, when the mesas
turn upside down in lakes of mirage—then
I’ll trail him!”

  He ate some meal cakes, drank of a
colorless liquid the shaman had distilled
from the agave plant, rolled a cigarette
and then he spread out his pack of cards to
study them.

  The Indian stood at the door watching
the coming of the mirages.

  “The desert is burning,” he said. “Never
was there greater heat. No wind across the
picachos. The country is dead. There is
a buzzard fleeing like a sea-gull before a
storm.”

  “The old bird’s guessed wrong,” Jingle
said, reading his cards. “If he stuck
'.143 v-

SHORT STORIES

around a while longer, he’d git a good
meal!”

  “Never was there such heat—and never
was there so much water. The sierras are
become islands! The Thunder Bird is
come into the desert. The Bad Mind is
casting a spell over it.”

  “Then, b’God, I’m trailin’!” Jingle
said.

  “The time is come,” the aged shaman
admitted to his disciple. The Hot Hand
be with you, my little puma cub! Go
down to your combat. And, when you
fight, wear this braided cord about your
neck, for it means you have dreamed the
Great Dream and are a Jesako!”

JINGLE went down to the river bed
to his horse. He now had two talis-
mans with which to fight: the six-
gun which his frontier ancestor had given
him, and a piece of sacred string—given
to him by his boyhood friend, a half-
crazed Pima!

 He mounted Black Diablo and at a
steady canter plunged into the wilderness
of rabbit brush and mesquite. The first
steps of the Sierra del Aja appeared on
the horizon in squares, in a pattern as reg-
ular as the battlements of a castle. They
changed in color as the rider neared them,
from a light blue to a purple, brightening
to a streaked orange.

  He reached their bases and then started
a slow climb up the facade of rain stained
rock, zigzagging up across strata of cream
yellow and Indian red, shadowless adobe,
glistening quartz.

  Reaching the crest he struck off at a
steady trot across the mesa’s flat top. At
the southern crest, he came precipitously
upon a vast purple bowl, its rim consisting
of crater formations, its center corrugated
with numberless radiating wallows. In the
canyon closest to his feet Jingle could see
a lake tinged a dusky lavender. Although
he knew this was a mirage, it was a veil
hiding something beyond. He strained his
eyes, trying to fathom the depths of that
lake, the heart of the desert.

  Despite the lateness of the day and the
slight elevation, Jingle could feel a terrific
heat gathering about him, until his head
throbbed and he heaved slightly for breath.
His horse, without having loped fast
enough to become lathered, panted heavily.
It was a curious heat, not the kind that
usuaHy comes up like a furnace blast from
south of the Sierra del Aja. There was
no feeling of wind, but there was the
sound of it. And in the floor of the can-

yon whiffs of dust scudded across the

sand. The phan-
tom lake seemed
to be simmering
to a boil. The
crest of the
granite benches
against the low
sun, partially
obscured by a
strata o f heat,
undulated
in scarcely per-

  The tensity of the atmosphere preced-
ing a storm, the semblance of a tornado
on every side without so much as the
touch or sound of wind, all these things
baffled the boy.

  The sun rolled down quickly, snuffed
out in those mirage lakes, like a torch
thrust sputteringly into water. There was
no twilight.

  A line of vivid lightning scratching
across the table mountain transformed the
scene into a wide sweep of sand, faults of
jagged granite, silhouettes of man-high
cactus. A rumble of thunder like the
sound of a Jesako’s tatoo upon a witch
drum sent Black Diablo tearing madly
down into the bowl canyon.

  With his rider dinging to his mane, the
brone plunged through patches of black
sage, sliding down steeper slopes partly
on his haunches in a shower of rocks and
sand, scratching his flanks and tearing the
boy’s khaki in the underbrush of thorn.
In flashes of lightning Jingle saw ahead
of him the dry wash of a river bed, a series
of sharply falling cliffs and draws—and a
desolate nester’s cabin.

  “That’s where he is—damn him to the
bottom of hell!” A useless curse. Pablo
Claug was already in the nethermost
depths of hell. And so, for that matter,
was the boy. Hell was all about, appear-
ing in spasmodic flashes, a stark demesne
of cactus, lava thunder—and that nester’s
cabin.

  “The Bad Mind’s sure a’workin’!” Jin-
gle said. “And the Thunder Bird’s hover-
in’ over us! If it scares me, think how it’s
searin’ him!”

  He laughed, achieving a sudden courage.
“If the Thunder Bird, which I don’t be-
live in, can scare me, it’ll sure make that
half breed crazy; he’s part Indian and be-
lieves!” He pressed his horse up toward
the cabin. The animal was trembling,
hysterical, shying at every cactus. Jingle
looked over his shoulder at the overhang-

                                                     10

ing mesa, down at the gulch. Lightning
was playing across from one granite wall
to the other. There seemed no end to the
echoes of a single thunderclap.

  “If it’s terrifyin’ me,” he said again,
“think what it’s doin’ to him!”

VII

JINGLE THOMPSON had a very
clear conception of what he was talk-
ing about. Claug was afraid. But he
was afraid no longer of posses of men
trailing him. He only wished they were
trailing him! His great horror was the
anticipation of spending a night in that
desert, the only human being within many
miles.

  The first flash of lightning seemed to
electrify all the dormant horrors of his
Pima ancestry. They came to life, clamor-
ing about him, gripping him, riding him!

  No longer able to bear the loneliness of
that little shack, he went out for his horse.
Better to ride pell mell on any trail, to any
destination. There was a chance he might
find some wayfarer—pocket hunter, bandit
or Mexican—if he rode far enough. It
made no difference as long as it was a
human being. Two men can laugh at the
Thunder Bird and all such savage gods
and devils. But one man alone—no!

  He untethered his horse. The dgsert
had darkened rapidly; the stars were
blanketed by what seemed a red curtain
hanging between them and the mesas.
Pablo Claug looked about in the deep
gloom in which the cactus and pronged
saguaro loomed like waiting beings. If
they only were men! He would rush to
them, throw his arms about them, crying
out for joy! He was alone in a bedevilled
creation. He was lost and in a country
even the buzzards abandoned. Why had
he fled from those Thompsons? Or from
civilization? For all he knew Thompson
might not even be dead! And besides it
was a fair fight. He could have escaped
the noose. Many a time before he had
escaped. He cursed himself for his fear
of men, which had sent him fleeing into
a region of demons. No, those saguaro
looming about were not men—they were
demons, biding their time.

  He leaped to his roan. Terrified at the
frantic pulling at its mouth, the horse
reared, standing upright, and falling back
onto the sand. Pablo Claug, practised
horsebreaker, left the seat in time to save
himself. A streak of lightning sent the
roan galloping into a patch of mesquite,
10

leaping over it in bounds into the deeper
tangle of the thorn, and then struggling
like a fly caught in a web.

  Claug knew well enough he could not
go after his mount in that mesquite patch.
He had no desire to be trapped out there
now. Let the horse fight it out, his reins
would keep him from wandering.

  He picked himself up and stared about
dumbly. A flash of light revealed a great
cloud of dust sweeping down through a
break in the Sierra del Aja. Far off, as
if from a region as remote as those crim-
son stars, he heard the howling of a great
wind.

  Another flash. One of those pronged
saguaro down toward the creek bed seemed
to have come to life. It was a big saguaro
—bigger than any he had noticed: more
like a horseman, than a man on foot.

  The wind rose to a deafening roar. It
came rushing down through gulch and
barranca, bringing with it a dense mist of
alkali. It hit the patches of brush so that
the lightning caught a glitter on the under-
sides of the leaves. It came walloping
against the little shack with the force of a
tree trunk hurled against it. It overthrew
one of the cactus-trees. And that big
saguaro was blown bodily along the trail.
For all the world it was a horseman riding
before the wind!

   And then the lightning revealed what at
first looked like a cluster of white blossoms
at the top! Just like a face—as if the
horseman had lost his sombrero in the gale,
so that his face was revealed clearly in the
flashes of light.

   “By God it is a horseman!” Pablo cried.
“No, it ain’t. Yes, it is! Or a devil! No,
it’s buman, that’s what, so help me, blowin’
along the trail afore this wind!” He drew
his gun. “No, ain’t goin’ to kill him. I
want him! I’m goin’ to keep him. He’ll
save me from the Thunder Bird—just
talkin’ to him will save me from goin’
mad.”

  The mere thought of a human being
coming up that bank, buffeted by the wind,
seemed to bring Pablo Claug to himself.
He was no longer alone at the mercy of all
his superstitions, his Indian devil-gods.
The Thunder Bird and the Bad Mind were
again something to be laughed at. “I’ll
shore keep him at my side till the night’s
over!” he said triumphantly.

  But then another much more rational
fear occurred to him. The law was after
him, and perhaps this man was trailing
him. Very likely! Some double-crossing
Indian in the desert had revealed Pablo's
144

SHORT STORIES

whereabouts. Some Indian who wasn’t
afraid. But there was no such Indian.
They were all afraid. Still, you couldn’t
tell. They got drunk sometimes—or else
crazy mad, eating peyote. A sensible In-
dian wouldn’t tell on him, but a locoed

Indian-

  Well, nothing to do but treat the wan-
derer as an enemy, shoot his horse, break
him, take him prisoner. That was an easy
matter—for this man Pablo Claug.

  He turned to the door of his shack, and,
knowing he was still out of range, he stood
there, with back towards the horseman,
and calmly and slowly rolled a cigarette
as if he had not noticed anything coming
up the trail. He did not light his cigarette,
because of the wind. But he stood wait-
ing with a fine calculation of the exact mo-
ment the horseman would come within
range.

  And then he wheeled, drawing on the
instant, firing a shot into the chest of the
man’s mount, a black bronco. The little
cow pony plunged forward, reared and
fell rolling as if to shake off some animal
that had clutched its throat.

  Pablo Claug rushed down the trail, gun
in hand, and stopped within a few feet of
the rider who had been violently thrown.

  “You draw on me, hombre,” Claug
shouted, “and I’ll put the rest of these
here shots in your own carcass.”

  The man on the ground struggled to a
sitting posture and looked up. When
Pablo Claug saw the oval face, the black
wavy hair and big gray eyes of a mere
boy, he burst out into a laugh.

  “So it’s you, Jingle Thompson!” he
roared triumphantly. “You’ve come to
get me, ay ?”

  “Sure it’s Jingle Thompson,” the boy
said, “I’m his son.”

  “I didn’t figure that you’d do anything
about it, little moso. They always said

as how you
was a reader of
the stars, that
there was no
fight in you.”
Jingle sat
there unflinch-
ing. There was
no tremor vis-
ible on his lips. The truth was, and Pablo
knew it, that the boy, even though looking
into the muzzle of a six-gun, was com-
pletely devoid of fear.

  “If you’re a reader of the stars,” Claug
said scoffingly, “I’m right glad you come.

I’m goin’ to keep you a while, afore killin’
you. The stars look funny tonight and
I’m wanting a thing or two explained to
>>

  A terrifice cannonade of thunder broke
off the halfbreed’s speech. His eyes
opened wide again so that young Thomp-
son could see the whites and a peculiar
sheen about them like the phosphorescent
eyes of a coyote.

  “You’ll be company to me tonight,”
Claug said, marching over to the boy and
frisking him of his gun. “You come into
this here shack with me. I’m hankerin’
for company. In the mornin’ I’ll fix you
so’s you won’t be trailin’ me any further
south. Instead the coyotes will be hangin’
around for a chaw at your pinto’s nose—
and yourn.”

  Claug threw the boy into the cabin, and
Jingle found himself in a hot room which
was cluttered with saddle parts, oil cans,
frying pans, a Dutch oven, a jack lantern
on a box table.

  Pablo lit the candle, sticking it in the
cone of dropped wax. He then turned to
the boy, who sat on the floor looking up
with a taunting placidity at his enemy.
How pitiably frail in comparison to the
hulking and powerful brute! And yet in
those large gray eyes, glowing through a
stray black lock, Claug could not detect
the slightest flicker.

  For the first moments Pablo Claug took
little notice of the “companion” he had
captured. The boy was unarmed, Claug
having tucked his six-gun in his hip pocket.
Nothing to fear from this little waif of a
human being. Compared to the thunder
he was pitiable, ridiculous—and also a tre-
mendous comfort!

  Meanwhile the whirlwind raised its
voice, unnaturally close, maddening in its
resemblance to a desolate puma or to the
wail of a woman. The sound swelled with
a burst. The shack rocked almost like a
cabin on a ship’s deck. A furious pelting
of sand, pebbles, mesquite roots deafened
the two inmates. Pablo reinforced his
nerve with a prodigal swig and then looked
almost beseechingly at the boy who was
studying his captor with glowing eyes,
calm set lips.

  “Look here, you damned little skunk!”
Pablo cried. “Aren’t you afraid?”

  He waited, then goaded by the inexor-
able, almost happy smile, he shouted, “Do
you hear me? I’m yellin’ at you. Why
the hell aren’t you tremblin’ at this here
storm 1 Maybe I won’t live to kill you in
the mornin’. You’ll be dead before that

—and me too! Damn you, I’ll make you
afraid, you little grinnin’ rabbit!”

  Pablo Claug swung his great red fist
toward the floor, catching the boy on the
side of the mouth. Young Thompson
hurtled back, his shoulders splintering the
boards of tbe door of the shack’s bunk-
room. The rusty hinges snapped, and the
door warped backward, twisting partially
open.

  “You’ve got power in your giant body,
Pablo Claug!” the boy said, wiping the
blood from his mouth. “But I have a
power you haven’t, a power denied to
other men.”

  Pablo Claug, after the hysterical exer-
tion of his blow, was left sitting, trembling
from head to foot.

  “I’ve got my right mind,” the boy said,
scrambling to his feet, composed for all
his dizziness. “That’s more’n you have,
Pablo Claug. Your mind’s shriveled up
with this here whirlwind. I can see your
forehead, dry as a cow skull bleachin’ in
the rattle weed!”

  Claug frowned. The nerve of the little
rabbit, making fun of him! Then he
smiled and rubbed his huge paw across
his forehead. The smile left him. Yes,
the boy was right. His forehead was dry!
Dry as something bleaching in the wind.

  “I can read the stars—that’s my power!”
the boy cried, his voice ringing piercingly
in a lull of the storm.

   Pablo Claug fingered the flap of his hol-
ster nervously. Across his long face there
flashed indecision, a whimper of pleading,
then, when the thunder clapped, a new ex-
pression of fear. Plis forehead was no
longer dry, for Jingle could see a moist
film of sweat reflecting the candle light.

  He looked to the boy beseechingly and
his eye followed the trickle of blood from
the placid mouth, down the oval chin, to
the sacred cord.

  “Who gave you that there Jesako cord ?”
the breed asked.

  “My own right! I dreamed the Jesako’s
dream. Are you so daft that you’ve for-
gotten the rites your Injun grandma taught
you ?”

  Pablo winced, swore, then stammered
out, “Tell me—tell me this— if you’re a
Jesako—what’s happenin’ up thar—and
what’s happenin’ to me? You tell me
straight! Don’t think you can save your-
self. I’m goin’ to stretch you when I’m
ready. Don’t stall and tell me lies, thinkin’
I’ll let you off!”

   “You’re goin’ crazy, Pablo Claug. I read
   10

that in the low stars. I seen the low red
stars reflected in your eyes!”

  The halfbreed stared quizzically, puzzled
at first, then maddened.

  “You’re a stinkin’ liar!” he cried.

  “Am I ? Then why is it you’re believin’
there’s a storm outside? Why—if you
ain’t locoed? You are savin’ there’s a
storm outside, ain't you now?”

  “Hell no!”

  “But you are! You said so. And there
ain’t a touch of storm out there. No water,

no rain, no hail-”

  “Who said there was hail?” the half-
breed grumbled in bewilderment.

  “You heard stones hittin’ against the
cans overhead.”

  “Sure!” He kneaded his lips, fingers
writhing.

  “And you thought there was a wind—
a whirlwind blowin’ up the under sides of
the sage.” He changed his voice: “Maybe
you think you can smell the sage?”

  There was no doubt about the sage per-
vading every corner of that room. Claug
sniffed. He reminded young Thompson
of a horse snorting in fright.

  “There was thunder,” Claug whimpered

uncertainly. “But maybe I was-”

  “Dreamin’, ay? You’re crazy, that’s
what. Did you ever hear a millin’ herd

growl? Did
you ever think
it was like
thunder ?”

  C 1 a u g ’ s
lower jaw, big
and peppered,
dropped. H e
gasped with a
whistling i n -
take of breath.
Jingle Thomp-
son knew that he had touched a vibrant
chord.

  “Did you ever hear of the man-eatin’
bull?” the boy hastened on, his imagina-
tion soaring. “The bull that gets his vic-
tims and waits till they go crazy with
thirst?” He raised his voice to an intense
cry—a bard evoking epic scenes: “I’ve
seen that bull, Pablo Claug. You took a
shot at it when it came chasin’ you to get
you. They told you it was my father’s
Galloway, but it warn’t. It was the Bad
Mind in the form of a bull! And after
you potted it in the stomach the way you
do any drag that skeers you, that bull came
back wanderin’ through the arroyos until
it come here, right in this canyon knowin’
146

SHORT STORIES

you would come back to it. You have
come back, and it’s goin’ to get you and
gore you, Pablo Claug! That’s what the
stars say—the low red stars I seen out
thar reflected in your eyes!”

  Claug’s face turned color. The soft,
wagging light of the candle threw his
features into a relief—a blue mask with
sharp black lines of madness, desperation.
The big, fear-crazed man, impotent against
the thunder, cornered like a rat, turned on
the only thing upon which he could vent
his rage and fear—the taunting boy.

  Jingle Thompson met the onslaught with
a wide sweep of his slender arm. His fist
did not reach up to the brute’s chin, but in-
stead a fortune teller’s deck struck Claug’s
face, bursting outward into a shower, fill-
ing the dim room for an instant with
downward fluttering cards.

  Claug rubbed his eyes, confused, baffled,
at kings, jacks diamonds, black spades—
symbols of death, of life, of misery and
power.

  Jingle Thompson raked the torn dog-
eared pile together with his tapering fin-
gers.

  “Death is written here, upon this table.”
Above the tumult and whistling in the
flattened tin cans of the shack’s roof the
l>oy raised his voice. His words were
screams following sharply, rapidly upon
the claps of thunder.

  “The cards are leadin’ the life of Pablo
Claug, torturer of cattle, killer of men.
Every card falls tellin’ of death! Pablo
Claug, locoed, dies. And the cause of him
dyin’ is his own cruelty. Taurus comes
down out’n the sky tonight. Claug will
be gored, trampled as the bones of the
Mex matadors are broke’! As the chaff
of the Pima’s corn is driven away!”

  A long roll of crashing clouds drowned
him. Then as they rumbled in diminish-
ing echoes through the mesas, the boy
added, “You can hear it now: the bull of
Pinto Mesa at your very shoulder, behind
you—on the other side of that wall!”

  Yes, there was unmistakably a rattling
of the boards, a rumble of sticks and
stones beyond, and all about them a bellow-
ing of wind.

  Pablo Claug’s jaw dropped, a hoarse
scream came from the stained gaping
mouth. He wheeled, drew and emptied
his revolver into the bare warped boards.
It was the same cowardly impulsive act
by which he had killed Jingle’s pinto; the
same by which he had shot Jingle’s father.
During that moment Jingle circled his ad-
versary and crept up behind him as he was

firing hysterically into that wall. The
boy’s hand, with one convulsive gesture,
reached to Claug’s hip pocket. The fingers
snapped shut upon the gun, his own gun,
which the breed had taken from him.

  But the streaks of white fire and the
loud banging seemed to waken Claug from
his hallucination, as a man’s own voice
calling awakens him from a nightmare.
He turned, his thick lips blue now, not so
much with fear as with a humiliated
rage.

  “You think you can come Injuu on me,
do you? Y'ou white-livered rat! You with
your tricks and your cards! I ain’t wait-
ing till mornin’! I’ll finish you here and
now for your lies!” He pulled the trigger
and. heard it snick on an empty shell.

  Jingle Thompson, clutching franticall}
at his own gun, jumped to his feet and
straightened up. He was no longer a
frail, puny boy waiting smilingly for death.
The smile was wijped away. His lips were
tight. He was immobile, statuesque,
amazed, baffled at the terrible power that
had suddenly come to him.

  “Don’t throw it on me,” Claug gibbered
brokenly. “For God’s sake, kid! I’m only
a poor ole cJioIo—an old cowdog that ain’t
worth killin. I’ll save you from the storm,
kid, from the desert, from the lightning!
I’ll—” He sank to his knees as Jingle
lifted the gun, pulled the trigger.

  A blast of white, a shot ripping a
warped upright. Jingle staggered back,
his wrist sprained by the kick, his ears
deafened, his brain numbed by the terrific
power of the gun in his hand, a heavy iron
thing that had become horribly instinct
with life.

  Pablo Claug roared with triumph. The
muzzle had kicked upward. Claug had
ducked just before the trigger was pulled.

  A stinging pain leaped from JingleV
wrist to his shoulder and across his back.
It felt as if that kick had shattered his
forearm. With both hands he clung to the
piece, fumbled again for the trigger,
backed to the wall. Hurling his whole
weight against him, Claug smashed the
frail figure against the boards.

  Claug’s great fingers dug into the boy's
throat, twisting his neck till a thousand
pains gripped him. A white light, more
brilliant than the lightning, stabbed his
brain. Again he pulled convulsively, in-
numerable times upon that trigger.

  A succession of muffled reports came
from between his body and the stench-
ridden animal that was suffocating him.
There was a hideous smell of powder and

                                                       10

burned clothes, of his own flannel shirt
and the calfskin vest of Pablo Claug—and
of flesh.

  For an eternity of moments those fin-
gers tightened, pressing his jaw backward,
sending pains like deep knives throbbing
down his spine. Two hundred pounds of
sheer weight lay against him. He could
feel the man’s heart pounding, he could
feel a huge pulse in the thumb buried in
his throat. A dense cloud pressed down-
ward upon his lungs; his palms burned
with the hot steel of the gun.

  And then he felt Claug’s pulse flutter,
pause, beat frantically and stop. The
thumb cutting into his neck just below the
jaw was stiff—but without any consciously
directed strength.

  The huge carcass of flesh fell away from
him, sliding to the floor.

  Jingle Thompson stood there, like a
spirit which is freed from its habitation
of putrid flesh, like a delicate winged thing
from which a hideous cocoon has fallen.

VIII

THE afternoon sky above Mule City
was of an intense, a dazzling blue.
The air purified by the storm was so
clear that you could see the pinon trees on
the Sierra, etched like little black lines of
pen-and-ink.

  As if to compensate for this extrava-
gance of light and color, the shacks and
corrals and main street of Mule Town
were clothed in a dull monotone of alkali.
The sand storm sweeping up from the
Pinto Mesa Desert had transformed every-
thing as completely as if with a fall of
snow. Dust was an inch thick on the
warped galleries of Cal Martin’s Cantina,
on the chow wagon of Ping Loo, on the
buckboards, on the snubbing posts, on the
edges of the horse-troughs, on the crooked
stretch of board sidewalk in front of the
Wells Fargo and the sheriff’s office.

  Into this scene rode one who had been in
the vortex of the storm, a flimsy scare-
crow of a youth, riding an exhausted hide-
torn, limping horse.

  “It’s Jingle Thompson, be God!” a
stockman cried, coming out of the swinging
doors of the big Cantina.

  Several men left the bar, several left the
monte tables. The Chink left his hot dog
stand, and his cousin Ping Loo came to
the door of his chow-cart with his cow-
puncher guests. A girl came out on the
gallery above. A deputy came out of the

   10

 sheriff’s office. The cry went down the
 street.

 “Jingle Thompson’s back—and Claug
 didn’t kill him! The halfbreed let him

come back, somehow. Might he didn’t find
Claug at all. Else how come, he’s ridin’
back this-away?”

  But there he was, and the word went
from cantina to hotel to veterinary’s shop,
to the barber’s, to the livery stable, to the
assayer’s office, and from bar to bar.
“Jingle Thompson, he’s back!”

  But someone raised a very plausible ob-
jection as the youth rode down the center
of the main street, his nag shuffling up the
soft dust. It was not a black broncho. It
was a roan whose hide was torn with
thorns, making streaks of blood through
the alkali coat. And the objection was
this: “ ’Tain’t Jingle Thompson at all!
And that thar hoss ain’t from the Thomp-
son Outfit!”

  This seemed a very reasonable doubt:
The boy’s face was disfigured with blue
marks as if a bear had cuffed him. His
back, revealed by the torn shirt, was cross-
hatched with the marks of thorn and rock;
his neck was swollen, clotted with blood.

  Some one else called out, “It is Jingle
Thompson. But it ain’t his hoss. It’s
Pablo Claug’s roan!”

  In the gaping silence that followed this
statement, a gaunt frontiersman stepped
out into the middle of the street, and
walked down towards the rider, shading
his eyes with his scrawny, dried-up hand.
It was Jingle’s grandfather, and the whole
town coming to doors and windows, saw
their meeting, the meeting of the past gen-
eration of lawlessness and gunfighting,
with the new generation represented by
the boy they all scoffingly nick-named Jin-
gle Thompson.

  The grandfather’s eyes squinted, his
mouth at first anxious began to curl into a
grim smile of recognition. Yes, this was
his grandson. No matter what horse he
rode; no matter what tatters he was
clothed in; no matter how thick a mask of
alkali and blood was on his face. The
partly blind, old man knew his kin.
148

SHORT STORIES

  “Did you do it, kid ?” the old man asked
excitedly, so that everyone in the street
could hear him. “Did you do what I ast
you to? I told ’em—the whole town—
you’d gone after him! I told ’em you was
my flesh and blood! Did you bump him
off!”

  The boy was eager to tell. But there
was something else that came first:
“Where’s my Dad?”

  “He’s back thar, kid. I had to tell him.
Damned if it didn’t give him more spirit
to fight for his life. He’s all righto, kid.
Cornin’ around fine, fightin’ like hell!
’Cause he wants to see you!”

  Before the grandfather could resume
his volley of questions, the crowd had come
down from office and bar and gaming
room and chow-cart. The boy was sur-
rounded, and the old grandfather was
shouted down with the clamor of questions.
“Where did you git the ole roan?”
“Who tore up your clothes?”

  “Who tore tip your face?”

  “Been wrasslin' with a puma?”

“And Pablo Claug, where is he now ?”
The grandfather was feeling of the
horse’s hide, his nose, his mouth, aiding
his sight with the sense of touch. “Is this
Pablo Claug’s hoss, shore enough?”

  “It is! And I done it!” Jingle Thomp-
son anounced with a boyish flourish.

 “He’s bumped off! He’s done it,
b’God!”

  “And with his bare hands!” the deputy
sheriff cried.

  “Cain’t shoot a gun. Must have did it
with his hands! They wrastled. The boy

won! But how in hell-”

  The skeptical barkeep of Cal Martin’s
Cantina yelled out above the din, “Did
you-all git him like you said you would—
and tell pomes to him?”

  This did not elicit the laugh it might
have done a few days ago. Instead the
crowd became silent, as if waiting for the
answer.

  “I told him pomes shore enough!” Jingle
said grimly. He alighted from his horse
and took a swig from the flask the first
man held out to him. “Pumped po’try into
him till he was ravin’ mad. He emptied his
gun firin’ into the storm. And then I fin-
ished him, with this here contraption.”

  He patted the six-gun his grandfather
had lent him.

  The deputy sheriff, as well as some of
the more skeptical citizens of Mule Town,

scratched their chins. Finally: “Look
here, Jingle,” said the deputy, “you cut
out this here po’try and tell us the truth.
Did you ackcherly meet up with the hell-
bender ?”

  “Go back there to the dry wash south
of Pinto Mesa,” Jingle rejoined, wiping
his mouth. “There’s a nester’s cabin
there.”

  “What about it?” from the deputy.
  “Pablo Claug’s body's there.”

  “That’s talkin’, Jude,” the grandfather
cried. He turned about to the whole
crowd and anounced proudly: “My grand-
son—Jude—he stretched him!”

  “That’s the ole gunman, Jingle!” cried
a barkeep.

  “I knew he’d do it! I told you-all he’d
do it!” shouted the grandfather. “Jingle,
he rode after Pablo Claug and bumped
him off! Wow!”

  The scarecrow took another swig from
the flask and looked up, as if startled, into
his grandfather’s face. He had never been
called “Jingle” by that man before, except
in the most scathing contempt. Could it
be he deserved that now?

  “What-all are you callin’ me Jingle for,
I’d like to know.”

  “What-all? What-all? ’Tain’t me. It’s
your dad, lie’s the one. He said, ‘you just
wait till my kid comes ridin’ down the
center of town with his rein chain’s ajing-
lin’ and his spurs ajinglin’. They’ll listen
to him then, I’ll tell you!’ Dad burn my
soul, ef he’d only know’d you was cornin’
ridin’ Pablo Claug’s hoss! Wow!”

  The deputy sheriff, the barkeeps and
gamblers, and every miner and stockman
and renegade there broke out into shouts
of laughter and acclamation.

  The excited old frontiersman added at
the top of his lungs, “Didn't you-all hear
the way his rein chains jingled when he
was a-ridin’ home? And his spurs? That’s
why you’ll all call him Jingle Thompson
from this day on! Because it’s music in
everybody’s ears! Be God, I heard that
thar jingle of them rein chains down to
the bottom of my toes, so help me! And
I’ll never forgit the sound of it!”

  But as loud as his cries were, he was
drowned by the renewed acclamations of
Mule Town.

  “Jingle” was the name of the kid whose
tunes they danced to; it was his name be-
fore; it was his name now; and it would
be that forevermore.

TEMPERED WITH MERCY

                By ERIC HOWARD

     LLOYD’S GREED HAD ALWAYS CRUSHED EVERYTHING BEFORE HIM ;
     BUT UP THERE IN THE COLD HEIGHTS OF THE PECOS COUNTRY

     HE WAS FACED WITH SOMETHING STRONGER EVEN THAN GREED-

     THE CALL OF BLOOD THAT MADE JACK HUGHES EXECUTE JUSTICE

TWO men on horseback, follow-
ing three heavily burdened bur-
ros, rode up the dry arroyo. A
light snow fell, obliterating
whatever trail marks there had
been ; a biting wind swept through the gash
of the canyon. The first man, cursing the
blinded burros, accepted the cold as he ac-
cepted most things, without complaint.
The other, of quite a different type, unused
to the saddle, equally unused to the ways
of the trail, beat his hands together, bit his
lips, blinked his smarting eyes, and again
and again sobbed: “God, but it's cold!”
Occasionally the man in the lead would
turn his head and give his companion a
contemptuous glance. Of course it was
cold! What did he expect, in mid-Janu-
ary, at this altitude, with the wind sweep-
ing fulLJorce down the Pecos?

  “When do we reach camp?” demanded
the second man, querulously.

  “Poco ticmpo,” lazily responded his
guide.

  Both men were dressed heavily, in prep-
aration for storms of any kind—the guide
in a double sheepskin coat, a fur cap, long
woolen stockings and high boots. The sec-
ond man wore what the best of Chicago’s
clothing shops had recommended for such
an expedition as he was undertaking—an
expensive fur coat, imported chamois rid-
ing trousers, waterproof boots of soft,
pliable leather. But, warmly as he was
10

dressed, Henry Lloyd was not warm. For
city winters he was prepared; he went
from his steam heated apartment to his
steam heated office in a closed car. His
body was soft and round, but his blood was
thin; rich food had lowered his resistance.

  Why, he asked himself, had he had the
bad luck that made necessary this trip at
this time of year? Luck usually favored
Henry Lloyd; but now it seemed to be dead
against him. And yet the long journey
was necessary, necessary to everything that
made Lloyd’s life what it was. He must
investigate for himself the reports and ru-
mors that had reached him. If they were
true, if the Upper Jemez land was really
valuable, all of his plans would have to be
changed.

  He recalled how he had acquired that
property, for less than the proverbial song.
The pleasure that recollection gave him
caused him to forget for a moment the pain
of the saddle and the trail. He laughed
softly, the chuckle of triumph that those
who entered his Chicago office, furnished
in heavy mahogany, knew so well.

  His chuckle ceased abruptly. He felt
the serious eyes of the guide upon him,
and a shiver not of cold, passed up and
down his spine. Damn the fellow, any-
way! What was wrong with him?

  “He gets my goat,” said Lloyd to him-
self. “I didn’t like his face when I first
saw him. If there’d been any other guide,
SHORT STORIES

I’d never have hired him! And this damn’
country! You might as well be in Mex-
ico, with a swarm of Yaquis in ambush
waiting to attack, as here! The govern-
ment ought to do something—nothing but
Mexicans in all these towns we’ve passed
through! And he savvies their lingo like
one of ’em! Wish I did!”

  It was true that, since leaving San An-
dreas, two days before, they had journeyed
through tiny villages where the majority
of the inhabitants were of Spanish extrac-
tion. Lloyd ignored the historical fact
that these people were the descendants of
the Conquistadores who had come into the
country three hundred years before, that it
was their country. He had heard no Eng-
lish, or next to none, since he had left San
Andreas; yet he was within the United
States. The guide, obviously an Amer-
ican, spoke seldom; he became fluent only
in Spanish. He had nothing in common
with his employer; and to the latter it
seemed that his eyes took on a malevolent
gleam whenever the guide looked at him.

  Lloyd was uneasy. From now on they
would pass no more towns, not even Mex-
ican villages. They would follow the ar-
royo far up into the mountains, ascend the
long trail that led to the mesa, and traverse
that to the section of land that had already
proved profitable to Henry Lloyd. It gave
promise of even greater profit, and Henry
Lloyd lived for profit.

  Swope, his agent in San Andreas, had
recently reported that the land was valua-
ble. Several persons had tried to buy it,
one of them the representative of a large
coal company. There was actually coal on
it, and probably oil. Swope advised Lloyd
to go easy; it might be worth far more
than he had ever thought when he allowed
his imagination free play in writing his
stock prospectus. The Upper Jemez Min-
ing Corporation, which was one of Lloyd’s
pseudonyms, had already sold twenty-five
per cent, of his stock. Its only assets
were the section of land, which Lloyd had
never seen, and Lloyd’s imagination. Gift-
ed as he was, Lloyd had never imagined
that the land was really valuable; he let
his stockholders imagine that.

  But if it was coal, and oil-bearing, then
he’d stop his stock selling campaign, let
it rest for a year, buy back the stock that
had been sold for a tenth of what it had
brought, and negotiate with a lug company
lor the sale of the property. Once before,
Lloyd had iost a hundred thousand by sell-
ing stock in a worthless enterprise, only to
have it prove valuable. He didn’t intend

to make that mistake again. And he was
enough of a geologist to make the examina-
tion for himself.

  Lord, but it was cold! Nothing but
business, crooked business, could have got
Henry Lloyd out of his steam heated apart-
ment and his comfortable office in the mid-
dle of winter. But when he thought of the
financial possibilities, his small eyes glowed
and he forgot, for a moment, the guide
and the cold.

  But not for long. He couldn’t forget
the guide. The man rode before him, tall
and lean and broad of shoulder, somehow
sinister. Henry Lloyd had been afraid be-
fore, but never under
circumstances like
these. There had been
the time when a mad-
dened investor in one
of his enterprises had
leaped to the running-
board of his limou-
sine, in the midst of
the city traffic. Lloyd
had cowered against the soft cushions,
while his strong chauffeur flung the man
off and called a policeman. Later, Lloyd
had read that the fellow had been sent to
the insane asylum.

   In his office and in his apartment, he had
nothing to fear. No one could get to him;
his negro valet had been a pugilist before
he learned to press trousers; and his of-
fice was well guarded.

   But here? He looked at the bleak cliffs,
twisted and distorted by volcanic action.
He was alone, many miles from the pro-
tection of the law, alone with a man who
hated him. He knew the guide hated him,
but did not know why. And he feared
him, as he had never feared anyone before.
Worse than the fear was the terrifying un-
certainty. He was going into the wilder-
ness with this man, and he was helpless.

  He felt, in his hip pocket, the pearl
handled pistol he had brought along. But
he was no shot and his gun was a mere
toy compared with the long barreled re-
volver that was holstered below the guide’s
silver Navajo belt.

  Had it not been for his greed, Lloyd
would have turned back at the end of the
first day. But he must learn for himself
the truth about the Upper Jemez property.
He must go on, in spite of his fear. His
cupidity made him almost brave.

  Besides, he was probably imagining
things, he told himself. The guide was
probably just a dumb, stolid brute like the
burros. Why should he hate Lloyd? He

                                                        10
TEMPERED WITH MERCY

had never seen him before, knew nothing
of him.

  “When do we get to that darn’ camp?”
he demanded again, striving to put a cheer-
ful, comradely note into his tone.

  The guide pointed to a rise far up the
arroyo. There was a small shack barely
visible.

  “We’ll camp there for the night,” he
said. “I’ve been headin’ that way. It’s
Jim Hunter’s old cabin; nobody there now,
since Jim died.”

  Jim Hunter! The name startled Henry
Lloyd, and seemed strangely familiar.
Who the devil was Jim Hunter? Why—
why, he was the chap who had owned the
Upper Jemez section! Lloyd had got the
property from him! Jim Hunter! Of
course.

  So Hunter was dead. Yes, he had
heard that. And tonight he was going to
sleep in Hunter’s old cabin. Ugh! He
didn’t fancy that. He wasn’t superstitious,
but it was sort of ghostly for all that. He
frowned as he remembered his dealings
with Hunter.

  He felt the guide’s eyes upon him, study-
ing him.

  “Well,” he attempted a casual tone, “I
hope it’ll be warm.”

  “It’ll be warm all right,” the other re-
sponded slowly.

  What did he mean by that, Lloyd asked
himself. The words had some other sig-
nificance than they usually had. He’d have
to be on guard, have to watch himself; it
wouldn’t do to let this fellow know that he
was afraid.

  Jim Hunter had come to Chicago, a lean,
gangling youth, in ill health. Lloyd re-
membered his first visit to his office; they
hadn’t admitted him until Hunter had men-
tioned that he owned some coal land in
the Upper Jemez. Then Lloyd had talked
with him, the first of several conferences.
Hunter was Eastern bred, and had taken
a partial course in geology at an Eastern
university. Unable to go on with it on
account of his health, he had left college
and gone to work.

  Later, he had married. Later still, his
health became worse, and, with his wife,
he had gone West. They had lived out of
the world for a long time, Hunter prospect-
ing as much as his health would permit.
He had found the claim on the Upper
Jemez and had acquired the property by
borrowing a little from his family. Then
he had gone East to sell it, or to get capital
with which to promote it.

  “I’m afraid I won’t last long,” Lloyd re-
  10

membered him saying. “I want to leave
things right for Jane, my wife.”

  Lloyd was not the first to whom he had
offered the property, but Lloyd saw possi-
bilities in it that the others had not seen.
It might, or it might not, be valuable; it
didn’t matter much, to Lloyd. He needed
some remote, little known El Dorado as a
bait; if he could get the Jemez land cheap
enough, it would do. Hunter needed mon-
ey, at once; and Floyd needed the land. He
set to work to get it. He offered no ob-
jection to it on the ground that transporta-
tion would present a big problem ; if it was
as rich as Hunter said, they could build
their own narrow gauge down to the main
line.

  Lloyd’s Alaskan Oil Corporation was
almost exhausted. All but a small block
of the stock had been sold, and what re-
mained wasn’t moving. In the end, after
skillful maneuvering, he had exchanged
that worthless block of stock, being ex-
tremely glad to get rid of it, for the Up-
per Jemez property. There had been a
verbal agreement that he would buy it back,
at any time, at its current price—but only a
verbal agreement. Young Hunter, inex-
perienced and very sick, accepted it and
looked for the stock to rise in value. Soon
it slumped; in six months it was worth-
less and Lloyd forgot the verbal agreement.
Hunter, too weak to return to Chicago,
realized on his death bed that he had been
robbed and that Jane would be left penni-
less.

  And Lloyd was to sleep, tonight, in the
cabin in which Hunter had suffered and
died, with the guide as his only companion.
He shuddered.

  Swope at first had reported the land
worthless, after a cursory examination by
a local prospector. Acting on that report,
Lloyd had proceeded to sell stock in it.
But now it seemed that Hunter’s dream
was a reality; he had to see for himself,
had to avoid the mistake of selling stock
in an enterprise that might be wortb keep-
ing. But what a fool he had been to hire
this guide! He might have engaged a
geologist to examine the property. But he
wanted to be sure. And especially he
wanted to keep his knowledge secret.
Secrecy was important in all Lloyd’s deal-
ings.

T WAS an hour later that they reached
the old cabin. It had grown dark.
“Go on in,” said the guide, “and get
a fire started. I’ll look after the animals.”

  He herded the burros into a makeshift
152

SHORT STORIES

barn—four poles supporting a roof—and
proceeded to remove their packs. One of
the burros carried feed for the animals.

  Henry Lloyd stood on the threshold of
Jim Hunter’s cabin, with the door half
open. In the dim light he saw that it was
rudely furnished. It had the look of hav-
ing been suddenly abandoned, like the ghost
houses in deserted mining towns. In one
corner was a drum stove; near it a pile of
dry pinon wood.

  Lloyd forced himself to enter. He felt
that the guide was watching him. Timidly
he walked across the creaking floor to the
stove, and with numb fingers made a fire.

  Jim Hunter’s cabin! He inspected the
shack more carefully. So it was here that
Hunter had lived with his young wife
through the long days of his sickness ; it was
here he had died. Lloyd didn’t know what
had happened to Hunter’s wife; he never
concerned himself with such things. But she
had probably left the cabin just as it was,
after Hunter’s death; had probably fled
from the place of misery and death.

  Before the guide brought the packs into
the cabin, Lloyd had time to recall vividly
the stricken youth he had defrauded. But
there was no regret in his heart, only fear.

  The guide silently set about preparations
for supper, cooking a simple meal over the
heater.

  “Frijoles y pan y cafe. Comida buena!”
he said, and set the pot of beans, greasy
and richly flavored with chilli, on the table.

  “What’s that?” demanded Lloyd, always
suspicious of the guide’s Spanish. “Talk
English, will you?”

  “Sure,” said the other. “But first, let’s
eat.”

  Again Lloyd felt that there was some-
thing ominous in the guide’s simple words.
But he sat down on a rickety chair and lift-
ed a fork of beans to his lips. Ugh! What
food! But he was hungy and, however
they tasted, the frijoles con chile were fill-
ing and warming. He ate heartily, drank
two cups of black coffee, and lighted a ciga-
rette, offering
his case of mo-
n o g r a m -
med cigarettes
to the guide.

  “No, gracias.
I'll roll one.”
The guide
drew out a
book of brown
papers. “Fun-
ny,” he s a i d,
after a moment, “to be stayin’ in a dead

man’s house. Hunter’s been dead a year
or so, now.”

  “Did you know him ?”

  “Sure. I knew him when he first came
out here. Nice young fellow. Too bad
about him. I wasn’t here after he came
back from that fool trip to Chicago or
when he died. He should never have left
here. If he had stayed, he might be livin’
today. Couldn’t stand any other climate.
But the poor kid wanted to fix things for
his wife, and there was no one else he

could send. If I had been here- But

I was down in old Mexico, looking for
gold, that year. The worst of it is he lost
everything, got swindled right out of it,
by some shark. And his wife was left
without a thing.”

  “Where is she ?”

  “Workin’ down in San Andreas. She
hasn’t been well since he died. It wasn’t
the trip that finished him, so they tell me,
half so much as his disappointment when
he found out he had been stung. The
poor kid was lyin’ right there on that bed,
half willin’ to die, thinkin’ he had kind of
repaid his wife for all her loyalty and de-
votion. And then to find out that he had
given his claim away, for nothin’! For
less than nothin’, for a batch of worthless
stock! That’s what killed him. And the
man that did it is his murderer. Jim died
cursin’ him, callin' out his name!”

  The guide’s steely eyes bored into
Lloyd’s. The Easterner recoiled and his
hand moved feebly in the direction of the
pearl-handled pistol in his pocket.

  “What ?” he cried, his voice rising. “It’s
a lie! The whole thing was fair and
square! I can prove it in any court!”

  So that’s why the guide hated him!
That’s why he had feared him. What an
idiot he had been to place himself in this

man’s power! Why, he might be-

  “Who are you ?” he cried.

  The guide had given the name of Jack
Hughes, but that might be an alias.

  “I’m Jim Hunter’s first cousin,” Hughes
replied, “and in our family a kinsman al-
ways fights for a kinsman.”

  Lloyd’s fingers clasped in desperation
about the pearl handle of his pistol. But
before he could remove it from his pocket,
he saw a flash of silver and the blue barrel
of the guide’s revolver was leveled at him
across the table.

  “Put up your toy,” said Hughes, in his
slow, steady voice. “Put it on the table.
That’s right.”

on his white brow. His small eyes darted

desperately around the room, in search of
a means of escape. Seeing none, they
looked again at the guide, a desperate,
pleading look.

  “Don’t kill me! Don’t shoot!” he
begged. “I didn’t know—about Hunter.

I can prove, in any court-”

  Hughes’ mirthless laugh cut him short.
“Maybe you’ll have a chance in a court
where technicalities and such truck don’t
go!” he said, with an upward gesture.
“You better pray.”

  “Don’t—don’t shoot!” wailed Lloyd, and
his voice broke.

  He began to crawl, literally. Hughes
spat in disgust.

  “Stand up!” he commanded. “I ain’t
goin’ to shoot you—yet. That would be
too easy for you. Jim Hunter suffered for
months on account of you. And, besides,
I guess there are other ways of dealin’
with a hombre like you, ways that’ll hurt
you more.

  “Listen! This Jemez property of Jim’s
ain’t worth much—not more’n a hundred
thousand. There’s no oil, and not any too
much coal. It’s more valuable on account
of the water on it, for grazing, than for
anything else. But, with the water and
the coal that’s on it, though it’ll be years
before they can take that out, it’s worth
maybe a hundred thousand.”

  “But the Western Coal people offered
-” began Lloyd, and then checked him-
self.

  “Sure,” grinned Hughes. “And I guess
you heard a lot more about how valuable
it was, eh? Sure! I fixed that. Gregg,
of the Western Coal Company, would do
anything for me; and I started the other
rumors. I wanted to get you out here,
knowin’ I couldn’t get you in Chicago.”

  “You-” began Lloyd.

  “Sure,” said Hughes. “I understand
you’ve sold about a hundred thousand dol-
lars’ worth of stock in this Jemez project.
How many widows and orphans does that
make? Anyway, what you’re goin’ to do,
before you leave here, is to have that
money transferred from your bank in Chi-
cago to Mrs. Jane Hunter in San Andreas.
You might as well write that letter now.”
Lloyd attempted a laugh. He was sure
that Hughes was bluffing. How was he
going to send a letter to Chicago from
here? They were miles from any post
office, farther still from a telegraph station.
Give up a hundred thousand dollars ? Not
much!

  Some of his feeble courage returned.
  “You can’t bluff me with your bad man
  10

stuff,” he said. “I won’t fall for it. I
bought that land from Jim Hunter fair and
square, and that’s the end of it. What
I've made since is mine, and I’ll keep it.
Your bluff about sending a letter don’t go!
How you going to send it? You’ll have to

think quicker than that, if you-”

  Grinning, Jack Hughes exerted his trig-
ger finger. A bullet whizzed past Lloyd’s
head, burying itself in the wall behind him.
Instantly, the man cringed. His face was
white, and his eyes had the look of a cor-
nered rabbit.

  Before the smoke had cleared, the door
of the cabin was kicked open and a blan-
keted Indian entered. He lifted his right
hand in silent salutation.

  “Come in. Sit down and eat!” Hughes
greeted him casually in Spanish.

  The Indian entered, sat down, and be-
gan to eat, letting the colored blanket slip
from his shoulders. He paid no atten-
tion to Lloyd, except to grunt as he passed
him. White man’s business!

  “Here is my messenger,” said Hughes.
“Santiago is the fastest runner in all the
pueblos. He is my friend—eh, Santiago ?’’
“Si. Muy buen amigo!” He turned
casually to Lloyd. “Santiago run like
hell, like the damn’ ol’ wind! Sure!”
“Santiago will bear your letter. It will
go special delivery. Then he will go on to
San Andreas. When the money is deposited
to Jane’s account in the bank there, he will
return and tell us. Then—well, then per-
haps you can go.”

  Lloyd thought quickly. The shot had
unnerved h i m.
The presence of
the stolid Indian
who was the good
friend of Hughes
upset him. A hun-
dred thousand ?
Well, supposing
he lost that; there
was still enough
in the bank. He
would get it back.
“You’re a damned robber!” he protested.
“I’ll write the letter. I have to.”

   “That’s right,” said Hughes, soothingly.
“I’ll dictate it.”

  When it was written, enclosed in an en-
velope and sealed, Hughes handed it to the
Indian.

  “Bueno!” observed Santiago.

“I’ll see you jailed for this!” said Lloyd.
“Well,” considered Hughes, gravely, “I
guess I’ll have to ask you to write a kind
of confession, just to protect myself. Sup-
154

SHORT STORIES

pose you tell the truth about the Upper
Jemez Mining Corporation, the Alaskan
Oil Corporation, and all the other things
you’ve promoted. I know a good deal
about ’em; I sort of looked into ’em after
I learned that you had killed Jim. Come
on, now, write!”

  "You can’t blackmail me any more!”
  “Write!”

  “I won’t!”

  The gun barked again, and Hughes
grinned.

  “I—I’ll write!” promised Lloyd. “But

you’re forcing me-”

  “No, sir,” smiled Hughes. “I’m just
kind of requestin’. Put down, first, that
since you’ve got religion you feel you
ought to tell bow many widows and or-
phans you’ve robbed. And don’t lie. Re-
member, I know a lot more about you than
you think. I want a full and complete
confession.”

  Lloyd wrote, submitting each page, as
soon as he had finished it, for the other’s
approval. Sometimes Hughes returned the
sheet, demanded a clearer statement of
some fine point, and Lloyd laboriously
copied it. Once or twice, during the long
evening, he rebelled, ft required only a
slight gesture, an elevation of Hughes’ re-
volver, to start him writing again.

  At last, Hughes approved the statement.
Santiago witnessed Lloyd’s signature to it.

  “Bueno!” said Hughes, and proceeded to
fold the sheets of paper and to place them
in an envelope. This he addressed to the
district attorney at Chicago.

  “My God! What are you doing ?” cried
Lloyd. Until now he had visioned his re-
turn to his steam heated apartment, to his
luxurious office. True, he had lost a hun-

dred thousand dollars. True also, he had
been forced to write a confession of nu-
merous and sundry fraudulent enterprises
in which he had engaged. But more mon-
ey could be made. Once out of this in-
fernal country, away from this man and his
gun, safe in Chicago, he would quickly re-
gain what he had lost. And never again
would he risk such a chance! But now—
the district attorney! Good Lord ! If that
confession were mailed he would be ruined.
He had been investigated once before.
They hadn’t been able to get anything on
him—he worked within the law, as much as
possible. But, with that confession-

  “You’re not going to mail that?” he
cried. “You said it was to protect your-
self ! I’ve given you a hundred thousand!
I’ll give you more! But don’t send that!
Don’t! I’ll-”

  “Do you think,” asked the guide slowly,
“that I’d be so selfish as to let you go on
robbing people? Do you think I’m only
thinkin’ of Jim and Jane? No. They
come first; they’re my kin. But I’m think-
in’, too, of all the others—of that boy in
the asylum and of the other one in jail for
stealin’ so he could buy your stock. I’m
thinkin’ of them, same as Jim would have
thought of them if he’d lived and got well.
Si, senor, the letter will be mailed—after
Jane’s money is properly put in the bank
for her.”

  There was a grim finality in the tone and
eyes of Jack Hughes. Lloyd, staring at
him, recognized his doom.

  “I’ll give you—I’ll pay you-” he be-
gan.

  “No,” said Hughes. “The letter goes—
with the money and half the outfit. You
stay here or not, as you like.”

     A DEEP BLUE SEA AND A WHITE HOT SUN, AND A BOAT FULL OF GAUNT,
     THIRST-TORTURED MEN; A YANKEE SAILOR AND A HATE-CRAZED PAS-
     SENGER AND, IN BETWEEN, A MAN AND A WOMAN SINGING-HAD

THE Monacy, all squat and ugly
in her war paint, was ly-
ing at anchor off Ninety-
sixth Street. Windows along
the Drive north and south of
Grant’s Tomb were beginning to blink
their early evening messages through the
gathering mists. Aboard the cruiser mess-
gear had sounded and the smoking lamp
was lit.

  Jimmy Legs, his big shoulders in their
tight fitting C. P. O.’s uniform looking big-
ger than ever in the autumnal gloom, sat on
the hatch coaming forward, watching the
gunner’s-mates making secure for the
night. One of them, a tall youngster, an-
gular and slim but with the promise of a
chest that would later rival that of Jimmy
Legs himself, was singing in a clear tenor
voice and bad Italian accent, a Neapolitan
folksong made familiar to American ears
by the phonograph. O’Leary, the red
haired chief-boatswain’s mate, suffering
from his customary indigestion and
grouch, growled a surly protest against
song and singer.

  “Leave him alone,” broke in Jimmy
Legs. “I like to hear him and the song,
too. It reminds me of one time off Hat-
teras—and us in an open boat.”

  The gunner’s-mates, their work com-
plete, joined the gang on the hatchway and
settled themselves comfortably to listen,
to

 Jimmy Legs made them welcome with a
 grin that showed his big white teeth firm-
 ly clenching the stem of his pipe.

    “There ain’t none o’ you youngsters as is
  old enough to remember the old Dirty
  Kate?” he began interrogatively. “No?
  I thought not. She was broken up before
  most o’ you was old enough to be out o’
  kindergarten back in the Middle West
  towns where you was raised. I was on
  her when they commissioned her at the old
  Brooklyn Guardo. She was the meanest
  thing afloat, always up to some sort o’ on-
  suspected trick. Never was there when
  you called her.

    “On this trip I’m tellin’ you about we
  was ordered to the South Atlantic Station,
  as it was called in them days, with old
  Sammy Patchen as commandin’ officer, and
  little Willie Snow as first luff.

   “I remember goin’ down through the
 Narrows, me at the con and old Sammy
 teeterin’ back and forth on heels and toes
 just behind me, watchin’ the Staten Island
 shore slip by and pickin’ up the marks
 ahead. When we got into the lower bay
 we run into a nasty sou’easter. Before
 we’d left the Swash Channel the old ship
 was earnin’ her nickname for fair, with
 spray a-flyin’ over the high fo’c’s’le-head o’
 her, and rattlin’ ag’in’ the canvas wind-
 shields on the bridge like birdshot on a tin
 roof. That weather kept with us south o’
 155
SHORT STORIES

Cape May, us huggin’ the shore.

  “By the time we was off the Virginia
Capes the gale had growed to a hurricane.
I never seen nothin’ worse. The Dirty
Kate was shippin’ it green when she rolled,
makin’ extra work for all hands to keep
the broadside guns from breakin’ adrift
and smashin’ things up in general. You
couldn’t get no sleep on watch nor off, and
we’d had nothin’ hot to speak of, exceptin’
midnight and mornin’ coffee, since leavin’
Scotland lightship behind us.”

  He paused, looked around the circle of
expectant faces now growing dim in the
twilight, rose and rolled to the side, where
he spat into the brown tide of the flowing
Hudson. Back on the hatch once more
he went on.

  “Well, we weathered Hatteras all right,
passin’ close enough to scratch the red
paint off’n the sides o’ the Diamond Shoals
lightship, and changed the course a cou-
ple o’ points to the east’ard. That brought
us headin’ sou-sou’east, or thereabouts, and
right into the gale which, ’stead o’ dyin’
down, was gettin’ stronger as we went
south.

  “I was quartermaster first class then,
and Jimmy Doyle was an apprentice quar-
termaster. It was Jimmy that sings out,
the morning after passin’ Hatteras, that
there’s a ship ahead of us and makin’ heavy
weather of it. I was just bein’ relieved
but I hangs on to see what’s goin’ to hap-
pen.

  “Old Sammy was a real seaman. He
pokes the nose of the Dirty Kate around
and heads for the hulk, for we could see
that was all she was. And the nearer we
got to her the worse she looked.

  “The storm had raised hell-in-general
with her, all right. Her foremast was just
a stump, her single funnel was all twisted
and slued to one side, and her decks seems
to be swept clear o’ boats and deck houses,
except for the solid superstructure amid-
ships. From the top o’ what was left o’
her mizzenmast a Spanish flag is a-flutter-
in’, just a-beggin’ for help. On the wreck-
age of her bridge is a little group o’ peo-
ple a-wavin’ and a-jumpin’ up and down
like they was crazy. It give me a funny
feelin’ in my throat to see ’em there, so
sure we was goin’ to save ’em—and in that
sea.

  “I tell you, fellers, I never see a worse
sea than what that was. She’s all run-
nin’ twistywise, with a nasty under-rollin’
swell that chops the waves about so’s they
come together in spurts o’ white spray that
shoots up like waterspouts.

  “Little Willie Snow come up on the
bridge and was standin’ along side o’ the
Old Man. Both o’ them was a-studyin’
the wreck through their binoculars, with
the wind whippin’ their oilskins about their
legs sort of affectionate and cuddlin’.

  “ ‘She won’t last long in this sea,’ says
Willie, cockin’ one eye at the captain.

  “ ‘No-o-o,’ says Patchen, drawlin’ the
words as though he was considerin’ some-
thin’.

  “I could see the Old Man was a-workin’
over some problem and guessed he was try-
in’ to figger out a way for us to get a boat
to them people on the Spiggotty craft. But
he looks at the seas and sort o’ shakes his
head, like he was sayin’, ‘It can’t be done.’

  “ ‘No use tryin’ to reach ’em with a boat,
sir?’ says the first luff, like he’s makin’ a
statement he wants the captain to contra-
dict.

  “The Old Man just shakes his head
again, and I get a little cavin’-in feelin’
around the pit o’ my stomach. No use
lookin’ any longer at what I can’t help. I’m
just turnin’ my head away so’s I couldn’t
see the founderin’ craft and them on her,
when Little Willie, who had went back to
his starin’ through his glasses, sings out.

  “ ‘There’s a woman on her, sir! She’s
just come up from below!’

  “The Dirty Kate, roundin’to under the
captain’s orders so’s to pass across the
stranger’s bows, had fell off into the
trough o’ the seas and was rollin’ like no
other ship I was ever on before nor since
when Little Willie squawks out about the
woman. The Old Man jerks out a word
he don’t often use, starts to raise his
binoculars when the ship gives a roll, and
over him and I and Little Willie goes. I
feel the bridge rail givin’ under our weight
and let a yell out o’ me as I go overboard.

  “I don’t fall far, seein’s how the Dirty

Kate is heeled
over the way
she was, and
so don’t sink
deep, but when
I come to the
surface there I
am right under
the counter of
the Spaniard.
How I got
there so quick
I’ve never been
able to tell, though I guess we was nearer
to her than we figgered in the mist. Any-
way, I strike out and grab a rope that’s
trailin’ over the side.

  “Next minute I’m a-clawin’ and a-spit-
tin’ up her flanks, and a-climbin’ over her
broke rail to her deck, with nobody offerin’
to give me a hand.

  “Up there the wind seemed to blow
harder than ever, and the ocean was al-
mighty close, too close for comfort. I see
a big boat in chocks just abaft o’ where
her funnel had been and keeps wonderin’
to myself as I go forward to the bridge
where the people’s still a-standin’, not pay-
in’ no ’tention a-tall to me, why they hadn’t
launched and took their chances. I sup-
posed then that they must have some good
reason—no time, or no men, or somethin’.”

  The old fellow paused, drew his pipe
from the pocket into which he had stuffed
it when he began his yarn, carefully filled
it with navy plug, changed his mind and
replaced the pipe in his pocket.

  “I wish I could tell you how that gang
up there on the old broken bridge looked
when I got to ’em,” he said, slowly. “It
took just a glimpse of the captain to show
me that he was skeered silly, and didn’t
know what to do. He was wearin’ a coat
with gold braid on the sleeves and his face
was covered with a week’s growth o’ beard.
He’s sayin’ somethin’ in Spanish, and a-
lookin’ off astern.

  “I turns to look, too, and what I sees
ain’t none too reassurin’.

  “It’s the old Dirty Kate, so far behind
us I can barely see her through the thick
mist. Of course I knowed then she’d
been up to some of her tricks, but couldn’t
lightly figger out just what had happened.
While I was a-lookin’, though, she fires
one o’ her six-pounder bow guns and sends
up a rocket, which I take to mean that she’s
tellin’ us she’s a-standin’ by. Anyhow,
she’s out o’ the reckonin’ for some little
time to come, so I turns back to the Span-
iards.

  “ ‘That was a pretty close shave,’ I says,
just to be polite and open the talk, ‘but I
made it all right. You look in a pretty
bad way.’

  “The Spiggotty skipper says somethin’
back to me in Spanish which, me speakin’
only the cigar box kind, gets clean by me.
I guess I looks as blank as I feel, for I
hear a soft, low voice at my elbow say,
‘The capitan asks will your warship re-
main close by?’

  “ ‘Stand by ?’ I says. ‘Of course she’ll
stand by till hell freezes over. That’s a
way we have in the navy, ma’am.’

  “While I’m speakin’ my little piece I get
a good look at the woman. And say, sbe
was an eye-full. Her clo’es was all wet

        10

and clung 10 her figger, and her face was
white with brine and her eyes was big and
looked bigger, but she was calm and. and
—Oh, I don’t know how to say it. When
she looked at you you just had little crawly
feelin’s racin’ up your spine, and you felt
like you do when there’s general muster
for punishment and the Old Man begins
readin’ out the court martial orders, you
know—all gone inside.

  “When I get the full charge o’ them
eyes 1 stammer out, ‘I beg pardon, ma’am.’

  “I don’t know what I’m beggin’ her par-
don for, but it don’t make no difference for
she ain’t payin’ no attention to me. She
has turned ’round to the captain and is
speakin’ to him in Spanish. And believe
me, if tones is anythin’, I wouldn’t be
spoke to that-a-way if I had to jump over-
board to dodge it.

  “The captain didn’t seem to mind.
Maybe he was so skeered he didn’t care
what anybody thought o’ him. Anyway,
she leaves us, walkin’ stately as Queen
Flavia in the movies, or somethin’ like that,
only there wasn’t many movies in them
days.

  “The Spiggotty mate comes up and tries
to get more out o’ me. His English bein’
rotten, I couldn’t make him out and goes
off to the wing o’ the bridge to clamp my
glims on the misty Dirty Kate. It don’t
take me long, dim as her shape is through
the murk o’ that day, to make out there’s
somethin’ wrong with the old hooker. In-
stead o’ roundin’ to and cornin’ toward us
as she’d ought to be doin’ she’s gettin’ fur-
ther and further away. I stand there,
wishin’ not to b’lieve my eyes, till she’s dis-
appeared altogether.

  “Knowin’ old Sammy Patchen as I do,
as well as what’s expected of us in the
Navy, I know there’s only one party to
blame for the way the Dirty Kate’s behav-
in\ And that’s the ship herself.

  “As soon as I fully take it in that she’s
gone and left us adrift I get sick. Sick’s
no real word for it. I could tell easy
enough by the way the Spiggotty is waller-
in’ that she’s due to go pretty soon. The
seas was washin’ over her as she rolled and
pitched in the trough, and each time I see
one cornin’ at us I say my prayers and get
ready for a long last swim. As for them
things amidships, they don’t do nothin’ but
moan and make funny noises in their
throats when the waves hits us. Finally I
go up to the Spiggotty mate and talks busi-
ness to him.

  “ ‘See here,’ I says, ‘this hooker’s goin
in a couple o’ shakes. Why not make a fight
158	SHORT STORIES

for it and launch that lifeboat back there?
I’ll get her over the side if you’ll gi’ me a
couple o’ men.’

  “He just stared at me with wild eyes,
his lips all slack and trembly and his chin
a-wobblin’.

  “ ‘Well,’ I says, tryin’ to wake him up.
‘What about it? Do we launch that boat
and have a try for our lives, or do we just
stay here and drown like rats? Remem-
ber there’s a lady on board.’

  “He just keeps on starin’ and wobblin’,
so I turns to the captain and tries to get
him to order the boat launched. He un-
derstands me all right, but he just shakes
his head.

  “ ‘No good,’ he says. ‘She zeenk queek,
cowo los otros,’ or somethin’ like that.

  “ ‘So’ll this ship sink quick, you lump,’
I says. ‘Sink quick and us on her.’

  "I turns to the third man.

  “This feller was a-wearin’ a long coat,
almost down to the tops o’ his shoes which
is long and narrow and pointed—you know
the shoes the Spiggoties wears. Around
his throat is wrapped a gray scarf which
he’s pulled up over his head to protect his
ears, for the wind has a nip in it. The
scarf thing makes a sort o’ frame for his
long dark face, which is set off with a lit-
tle spiked chin beard and some mustaches
all waxed and drawed to a fine point. I
didn’t like his looks at all, but I could see
he had his wits still and I thought maybe
he could get the captain to act, bein’ plainly
a passenger, so I grabs him by the arm and
points to the lifeboat astern.

  “ ‘Boat!’ I yells at him. ‘Boat! Launch,
eh?”

  “He shakes off my grip easy, bein’ a
powerful man, and snaps at me in good
English.

  “ ‘Do not touch me, Yankee dog,’ he
says. ‘Your ship has deserted us, leaving
us shipwrecked—as Yankees would do.
You are all cowards, a race of pigs.’

  “Say, if he’d slapped me in the face I
couldn’t ha’ been more took aback. I look
at him a minute, wonderin’ if he’s goin’
dotty or was I. Then I seen he meant it,
and I let a howl out o’ me and went for
him. I just hit him once though, for the
lady, who wasn’t anywhere around as I see
when I pitched into him, steps in between
us. She gives me the once-over with them
eyes o’ hers, and makes me feel cold and
hot in the wrong spots.

  “She speaks, and her voice is cold as
the wind. ‘If you think we should launch
that boat and are willing to try, I shall get
you the men. Only five are left. The

others were drowned trying to launch the
other boats. Come.’

  “Feelin’ anythin’ but proud o’ myself,
but knowin’ that the only chance any of
us stood was in that lifeboat, I follow the
woman down the ladder to the forward
well deck. Remember the bulwarks was
all washed away, and the ship was rollin’

like O'Leary here cornin’ back from a
twelve-hour liberty. And every time she’d
roll she’d ship it green over her sides, the
water rushin’ across the deck in a sluicin’
torrent. It was a sweet job crossin’ that
deck.

   “At the foot o’ the ladder I sort o’ hesi-
tated, watchin’ the sea and kind o’ gropin’
’round for my courage. But did that dame
hesitate? She did not. She just walks
out on that swayin’, slippery death trap of
a deck like she was walkin’ across a ball-
room floor. I foller.

  “At the coamin’ o’ the forehatch, over
goes the ship and a sea leaps aboard like
a dog jumpin’ for his master. I yell, ex-
pectin’ to see the woman washed away to
leeward. Instead, down she drops, clutch-
es a line made fast to the battens o’ the
hatch and lets the wave go right over her.
I never see sech presence o’ mind in man
nor woman. Before I’d got my breath
back, she’s up and a-walkin’ on toward the
fo’c’s’le-head.

   “Down the fo’c’s’le ladder she goes, with
me a-trailin’ her. It was dark down there
and the deck was all awash, the water
swishin’ back and forth with the motion of
the ship.

  “O’ course the place is full of noises,
what with the creakin’ o’ the crazy struc-
ture, and the poundin’ o’ the waves outside.
But in spite o’ the racket I can hear the
woman’s voice, clear and cool, a voice of
authority if ever there was one. Presently
a man comes lumberin’ out o’ the dark to
the little patch o’ light under the hatch, and
then four more.

  “ ‘You tell them what to do, and I’ll
translate,’ she says to me with that air o’
hers, sort o’ high and mighty, as if she was
SONG POWER

talkin’ to a pretty punk kitchen maid. Up-
stage, that’s what I’m tryin’ to say. If it
had been anybody else you’d ha’ wanted
to bash ’em, but you sort o’ expected it
from her.

  “You fellers know what it is, gettin’ a
boat over the side without proper tackle or
hands. Blest if I know yet how we did
it, but somehow we did.

  “Finally we gets her swung outboard
and then, at deck level, and then I get the
dame into the stern sheets, all wrapped up
in coats and things.

  “By this time the skipper and the mate
and the man in the long ulster has come
down off the bridge. The two officers was
tryin’ to help, but fear’s got ’em, and they
get in the way inore’n they do anything
else, so I shoo them into the boat with the
woman. The other man hain’t offered to
do nothin’, but he’s made no protest when
I orders him to load us up with water and
what food he can find, and I go 011 with
my work, thinkin’ he’s obeyed.

  “Before we’re all ready for launchin’
the ship has sunk until her deck’s only a
couple o’ feet above the water line, and
every roll she gives is a peck of trouble
for us at the boat.

  “When all is ready I give the word and
down we lower the boat on the run, me
stayin’ on deck last to see she cleared prop-
erly. I come damn’ near missin’ out,
though, for she sheered away as a big wave
rushed us. I slipped, brought up against
the ragged edge o’ the broken bulwark,
tearin’ my shirt and a rip down my right
arm. There I am on the sinkin’ ship and
there’s the boat ten yards away, and goin’
further every second.

  “Believe me, I done some quick thinkin’
just about then. The woman, though, she
motions the men to back water, and I take
rny chance and jump, and go for them
hand over hand. The captain shows he’s
human, for he reaches down and grabs me
by the hand and helps me into the boat.

  “She was already gettin’ out o’ the lee
o’ the ship and beginnin’ to feel the full
force o’ the wind, so I scramble aft and
pick up the steerin’ oar. With the help o’
the others I manage to get her straight-
ened out, head to the sea.

  “I was so busy doin’ that, I didn’t hear a
shout from the captain, that is, I heard it
without knowin’ I heard it. After we was
ridin’ fairly easy I look around for the ship
we’ve just left.

  “She’s gone. It was just as though she
was human and had waited for us to get
away before sinkin’ for good and all.

      10

  “So there we was, seven men and a
woman in a open boat, with night corn-
in’ on and, as near as I could guess, at
least a couple o’ hundred miles o’ stormy
sea between us and the nearest land. To
make it worse, there’s no water and 110
food in the boat. The man in the long
ulster hadn’t done what I told him to do.
He was too aristocratic for that, I reckon.
Anyhow, he didn’t, and we had no sort o’
provisions o’ any kind.

  “When I find it out I looks at this fel-
low with the waxed mustaches and I says,
‘You called me a dog a while ago back
there on that ship. I slapped your dirty
face for that then. We are quits on that,
but when we gets ashore I’m a-goin’ to
take this out o’ your hide. Understand?’

  “He gives me a scorchin’ look which
don’t scorch me none, for I’m not worryin’
about him no more just then. I’m a won-
derin’ where we’re at, and whether we’d
best try runnin’ before the wind, with the
little rag o’ sail I’d put in the boat, or try
hangin’ around on the chance the Dirty
Kate fixed up whatever had happened to
her and come back to pick us up. At last
I decides on tryin’ for the land, feelin’
very sure that Sammy Patchen would
never have deserted that sinkin’ ship un-
less somethin’ had happened to his own
vessel to make her unmanageable for fair.

  “I ask the Spiggotty captain where he
figgers we’re at, and after a deal o’ talk,
with the lady actin’ as interpreter, I make
out that he reckons we’re about two hun-
dred miles south o’ Diamond Shoals light-
ship.

  “That gives me my line and I get the
boat swung about, though it was some job
with a small boat and the seas that was
runnin’. I do it, though, and away we
goes, with me crouchin’ in the stern sheets
at tbe steerin’ oar, bein’ afraid to let any
o’ those squoogy moogy landsmen with me
take on the job.

  “And I tell you I was skeered. The
waves looked as though they was coinin’
aboard every other minute, curlin' out o’
the dark with their fierce white caps and
just towerin’ over us. Somehow, more by
good luck than anythin’ else, I managed to
keep her free for the most part, though
once or twice we was caught and almost
swamped by one that broke sooner than I
expected.

  “All that night we run for it. Lucky
the boat was a big one, with blunt bows
and good freeboard for her size.

  “With mornin’ the wind dies down to a
gentle breeze, though the seas continues

high for- a long time after the sun comes
up. ’Long about ten o’clock, after I’d
been at the steerin’ oar for close on seven-
teen hours straight, I turns her over to the
mate. He proves to be a pretty good
steersman, now that he ain’t so skeered,
and I go for’ard for a rest under a thwart.
Pretty soon I was poundin’ my ear eight
bells, in spite of an empty stomach which
even then was beginnin’ to hurt.

  “I don’t sleep so long at that, though,
but wake up in about two hours with the
sun straight up over me, and me sweatin’
and stewin’ in the heat for all I’m worth.

  “I sits up and looks at the others. Three
o’ the men is settin’ near me in the thwarts.
Aft in the stern sheets is the others, the
girl sittin’ for’ard o’ the men with her chin
on her hands and her long white fingers
over her eyes, hidin’ them from the glare.

  “From the girl I turn to look at the
weather.

  “The sea has gone down until, except
for a long slow swell and a tiny little rip-
ple where the catspaws stirred the surface,
there’s no movement to speak of. The
horizon is close aboard, though, and there’s
a vague sort o’ shimmery mist over every-
thing. It don’t look so good to me, seein’
as how we was so far from land, and I
look back at the men to see how they seem
to be takin’ it and whether I can count on
much help from them.

  “The mate was still steerin’. The cap-
tain was a-lyin’ back on one of the fore-
and-aft seats, his shirt open at the collar
showin’ his red, turkey gobbler throat all
tufted with beard where he needed a shave.

  “But it was the chap with the spiked
beard and mustache that looked worst off
to me. He'd took off his coat and was in
his shirt sleeves, but still had his head
bound up in that scarf thing.

  “I suppose my gettin’ up had sort o’ at-
tracted his attention to me, there where

we'd nothin’ to
do much but
watch the sea
and each other.
Anyhow, h e’s
studdyin’ m e
through
squinched
up eyes when I
look . at him,
eyes that gives
me a little
shiver they’re so damn’ mean lookin’.
Oncet sence then I saw a fillum called
Fawst. The Mephisto in that movie looks
just like this feller I’m tellin’ you about.

There’s a broodin’ melancholy devil a-lurk-
in’ in his eyes that meant business, it
seemed to me, but I couldn’t for the life
o’ me tell why he had it in for me special,
onless it was because I was an American.
O’ course I’d handed him a wallop back
there on the ship, but he’d brought that on
hisself. Anyhow, I squinches up my own
eyes and stares at him till I beat him at the
game and he turns his back on me.

  “I take a seat on the nearest thwart and
reach for my pipe and tobacco. O’ course
the tobacco’s wet and spoilt. Still I man-
age to get a chew that stopped my stom-
ach gnawin’, but it don’t quench my thirst
none, and believe me by that time I’d ha’
give a month’s pay for one swig from the
old Dirty Kate’s scuttle butt.

  “While I was sittin’ there, chewin’ slow
so as to make it last longer, the woman
takes her fingers off’n her eyes and looks
at me with a slow friendly smile that curls
her lips and lightens her dark face. It’s
the first time she’s looked at me like I was
human, and I smile back in return.

  “ ‘Come and seet where we can talk,’
she says to me. ‘There are many ques-
tions I would ask.’

  “ ‘Ask ’em,’ says I, gettin’ up and crawl-
in’ over the in-between thwarts till I am
sittin’ alongside o’ her. ‘What are they?’

  “ ‘Your sheep,’ she begins. ‘Why did
she not come back to get us?’

  “ ‘Because she is of that pig nation, the
Yankees,’ breaks in the evil lookin’ man
with the beard.

  “ ‘Be silent, Senor Gonsales,’ commands
the woman beside me. ‘I will not have
troubles made here, especially with this
American who reesk his life to come to our
aid.’

  “I feel sort o’ guilty at that, seein’ as
how I'd not had anything much to do with
the cornin’, the credit bein’ due the rollin’
o’ the old Dirty Kate. But I didn’t say
nothin’. If she wanted it that way, why
that way it was a-goin’ to be. Senor Gon-
sales, as she’d called him, growls a little
under his breath and turns bis head away.

  “ ‘And now,’ she goes on, ‘what is your
name, what is your rank, and why did not
your vessel ‘stand by,’ as you thought she
would ?’

  “I tell her my name and the real name o’
the Dirty Kate, and explain that the old
hooker certainly busted somethin’ or she
would have been back for us.

  “ ‘But of course,’ she says. ‘Your sheep
is herself in trouble. I had not thought
of that.’

  “She sits silent for a long time. Finally

I get up the nerve to ask her what her
name is. ‘They call me in France Lc
Rossignol,’ she tells me, ‘which means in
your language, “The Nightingale.” In my
own countree I am called Carlotta and on
the billboards I am called La Seville, which
is the name of the city in which I was
born. Many names, is it not?’

  “ ‘Quite a few,’ says I, respectful. ‘What
am I to call you, miss ?’

  “ ‘Not “miss,” ’ she says, and her face is
like a stone image. ‘You may call me
Madame Gonsales.’

  “After that neither of us says anythin’
more, her forgettin’ whatever other ques-
tions she wanted to ask me, if any. By
and by I go back to my for’ard thwart and
falls to watchin’ the sea.

  “Man and boy, I’ve been follerin' the
sea pretty much all my life and pretty near
all over the world. I’ve seen it in all its
moods and under all sorts and conditions
of weather, but I never hated it, yes and
feared it, like I did that day. It looked so
damn’ sleek and shiny, like a great slip-
pery snake crawlin’ its way to the land.

  “It got hotter and hotter. By and by
one of the three Spanish sailors beside me
slips to the bottom of the boat and lays
there with his mouth open, and moanin’ a
little. He’s just a youngster, I think, as
I look down at him and see his chin cov-
ered with a black down and just a couple
o’ curly hairs stickin’ out—just a youngster
a-growin’ of his first beard. I can’t make
out all he’s savin’ in his mutterin’s, but
every now and then I catch the word
‘agua,’ and know the poor kid is askin’ for
what he can’t get—water.

  “Lord, how the day drags! But at last
the sun goes down behind the sleek swells,
the wind freshens a little, and I feels bet-
ter and goes back to the steerin’ oar to re-
lieve the mate, none o’ the others havin’
offered to take their turn. Pickin’ out the
North Star as my guide, I sets my course
a little to the west o’ that, hauls the sheet a
little flatter, and feels kind o’ cheerful
when the boat begins slappin’ through it.

  “The funny thing about that day, I’m a-
thinkin’ as I steer the boat, is that nobody
talks. We might ha’ been a gang o’ deef
mutes for all the sound we make for hours
on end.

  “Along about nine o'clock the moon
comes up, and we go slappin’ along with
the water purrin’ at our bluff bows like a
brace o’ ship’s cats. I get tired a-figgerin’
©ur chances on bein’ picked up or makin’
land on our own, and takes to observin’ the
people in the boat,

  “Madame Gonsales is settin’ on the bot-
tom o’ the boat between the two after
thwarts, her back to the stern sheets. She
might be a statue o’ one of them Buddhas
for all the motion or sound from her. The
mate has gone forward with the men and
the captain is a-restin', as usual, on one o’
the fore-and-aft seats astern. Gonsales is
on the other. He’s took the scarf thing off
his head, and I notice he parts his hair so it
looks like two little black horns in the moon-
light. He’s a-leanin’ with one arm over
the side, his fingers a-trailin’ in the water.
I see now what I hadn’t noticed before,
that he’s a big man as Spiggotties go, with
narrer hips and broad shoulders. He makes
me think of a bullfighter I seen once in
Barcelona. Evidently, I thinks to myself,
there ain’t no love lost between him and his
missus. They don’t even look at each
other if they can help it, much less talk.
The youngster in the bottom o’ the boat’s
half asleep.

  “It seems to me as I set there, lookin’
’em all over in the slitherin’ moonlight,
that they’re all dotty, and me with ’em.

  “Thinkin’s doin’ no good so I takes my
second chew o’ tobacco, goin’ easy on it,
first because I want it to last and second
because the salt in it makes me thirstier
than hell. The wind keeps a-freshenin’
and haulin’ ’round more and more to the
west, kickin’ up a nice little ruffle o’ sea.
Funny, I’m thinkin’, how different the sea
is. That afternoon I’d fair hated it for
bein’ so sleek and slimy and full o’ treach-
ery. Tonight with the cool air and the
moonlight and all the little wavelets run-
nin’ to white eaps as cheerful as kittens,
the sea’s a friendly companion.

  “At midnight the mate has one o’ the
men relieve me, and I go for’ard again to
try to get some more sleep. Pretty soon,
in spite of hunger and thirst. I doze off,
my last thought bein’ that the wind’s a-get-
tin’ lively, and does the man steerin’ know
his business?

  “He don’t, and I come out of it sharp,
with the sail a-flappin’ all over me and the
mast over the side. I make a grab and try
to salvage it, but the darn fool aft lets the
sheet fly and away goes the stick, draggin’
the sail after it. There we was, adrift on
the high seas, with nothin’ but oars to get
way on her and not a blasted thing in sight
except the white caps, which don’t look so
playful now that the boat’s swung off into
the trough.

  “I grab an oar and bellows to one o’ the
other men to grab another. Pretty soon
we had her headed into the seas, and pull-
l62

in’ just enough to keep from broachin’ to.
Before that she'd been a-wallerin’ like a
pig in a stye.

  “And then them Spiggotties begins to
talk. First the captain starts on the feller
at the steerin’ oar, and I think is he goin’
to beat his brains in. Then the mate takes
his turn with the captain chimin’ in and the
man a-shoutin’ at ’em both, and the kid in
the bottom o’ the boat stops his moanin’
and laughs in a way that sets my teeth on
edge. With that the other two sailors
butts in till it sounded like a whole me-
nagerie’s broke loose on the lower deck of
a freighter. I stand it till I can’t stand it
no longer, and then I declare myself.

  “ ‘Shet up, every damn’ one o’ you,’ I
yells, louder than any of ’em’s shoutin’.
‘The damage’s done, and talkin’ won’t
mend it. It’s up to us to row this boat
ashore. I’m goin’ to head due west. The
mate and me’11 do the steerin’ and the rest
o’ you can row, except, o’ course, Madame
Gonsales.’

  “I don’t think they understand all I’m
sayin’, but I scramble aft and take the
steerin’ oar, and Madame Gonsales sings
out somethin’ in that queer penetratin’
voice o’ hers. Two o’ the men takes oars
while she’s talkin’, and away we go.

  “And then I begin to look back on how
well off we was when we was a-sailin’ easy,
with the wind doin’ the work and us a-liv-

in’ high. Now we’ve got only our arms
and backs for it, and nobody knowin’ how
f;ir we are from land. Grousin’ never
done 110 good, though, so I sticks to the
oar, a-thinkin’ maybe I’m better off now
than I will be in a little while, for I feel
in my bones that more trouble’s on the
way. It’ll be cornin’, some of it, I tells
myself, when I orders that feller Gon-
sales to take his turn at the oars, which
i've made up my mind him and the cap-
tain’s got to do when their time comes.

  “Dodgin’ trouble ain’t losin’ it none,
though, so I sets my jaw and when I figger
the first two men has rowed for a couple o’
hours or more, I sing out, ‘Time to relieve
the wheel! Watch below, turn out. You
I mean, Mr. Gonsales. Take them oars.’

  “He is a-leanin’ back over the side, trail-
in’ his fingers in the water as if he was a
silly woman on a pleasure boat. He didn’t
pay the slightest attention to me when I

spoke, just went on trailin’ his fingers in
the water, one arm over the side, the other
makin’ a rest for his chin on the gunwale.

  “I beckon to the mate, who’s roused at
my call, and tell him to take the steerin’
oar. I guess they think I’m a-goin’ to
take a trick at rowin’, but instead, I reaches
down and grabs Mr. Spaniard by the
waistband o’ his trousers, gives a yank and
pitches him into the bottom o’ the boat at
the feet o’ one o’ them two oarsmen.

  “Next second he’s up and cornin’. I
brace myself and let him have it, a good
solid clip on the jaw.

  “Back he goes under the blow, the gun-
wale takes his knees and he drops over the
side. That’s more than I had planned, and
I reach down and ketch him by the shoul-
der as he slips past, and haul him back into
the boat. He’s a-gaspin’ like a fish, and
full o’ water, and with no fight left in him.

  “ ‘That’s for disobeyin’ orders,’ I tells
him, ‘and has nothin’ to do with the lickin’
I’m a-goin’ to give you when I get you
ashore. Now you take that oar, and row.’

  “He takes the oar without another kick,
but I see in a minute he ain’t never learnt
how to handle one proper. I keep him at
it, though, and calls on the captain, expect-
in’ another fight. But I don’t get it. The
captain’s learnt his lesson by watchin’ what
happened to the senor. He takes holt at
the word from me, and I go back to the
steerin’ oar and send the mate to finish his
watch below.

  “That second day, when it comes, is like
the inside of a tomb. Nobody says nothin’
to nobody. Mine, givin’ orders, is the only
voice I hear, and I get damned tired of it.

  “All that day we pull, the mate and me
takin’ turns at the oars and cuttin’ our
tricks at the steerin’ short to make up for
it. I was gettin’ used to bein’ hungry now,
but the thirst was like a raging fire, gettin’
bigger and hotter every second.

  “After sundown that day the youngster
with the fuzzy chin goes plumb loco. He’s
been drinkin’ sea water for a couple o’
hours, I find out, and his fool mates ain’t
stopped him. No use tryin’ to describe
that part of it. It don’t last long but it’s
hell while it does last, and I’m glad when
it’s all over and there’s only six men and
a woman left in the boat.

  “As for that woman, she’s just the same,
except that her face has browned under the
sun till she looks like a Malay.

  “It’s the momin’ of the third day. The
sun comes up on a bare cruel sea, all
burnished and shinin’ like the bright work
on the pinnace of an English man-o’-war,
SONG POWER

The mate bein’ all in, I’ve been steerin’
since about six bells in the midwatch. My
tongue’s so dry it rattles in my mouth. My
eyes feel hot enough to burn holes through
my eyelids, and there ain’t no little bone
no muscle in me that ain’t achin’ with
weariness. I look around at the steel blue
of the horizon with never a break in it, and
I says to myself, ‘This is the end. Here’s
where they sound taps over you, old boy.’
“I don’t say this with my tongue, for it
seems useless for all practical purposes.
My mouth feels like coals o’ fire. When
I try to stand up, with the help o’ the
steerin’ oar, my head spins around like a
dog vane in a change o’ wind. It’s all I
can do to keep the boat’s nose headed west.

  “All night long the woman has been a-
settin’ on the bottom of the boat. If she’s
moved once, I don’t know when it was, but
now she gets first to her knees and then
verv slow to her feet, and looks around the
horizon. Presently she turns to me and
points dead ahead.

  “And then, just when I’ve give up hope,
I see it.

  “it’s a little black bump on the edge o’
the horizon, just a sort o’ hump on the sea.
It don’t look no bigger’n my fist from
■where we are, but I know it’s a ship o’
some kind. The sight o’ it steadies me.
I gives a gulp, and finds my voice.

  “ ‘Yes, ma’am,’ I says, croakin’ like a
frog. ‘It’s a ship.’

  “And then, just like a black blanket, de-
spair comes down over me again, for I see
the oarsmen lyin’ exhausted on the flat o’
their backs and the mate all in, lyin’ with
his face up to the sun, his cracked lips
pulled back in a inhuman grin from his
teeth. I realize, too, that we’ve dropped
off into the holler of a swell, and that I’ve
been just dabblin’ with the steerin’ oar for
I don’t know how long when I might as
well been savin’ my strength.

  “ ‘We’re done for,’ I fells myself. ‘We’ll
never make that ship see us. Cain’t get
close enough to it.’

  “I guess what I’m thinkin’ must ha’
showed on my face, for the lady says, very
low and kind o’ tender as if she’s lots sor-
rier for me than she is for herself, ‘Are
you near the end of it, big man ?’

  “ ‘Not on yer life, ma’am,’ I says, tryin’
to grin. ‘You can’t keep the workin’ man
down.’

  “That seems to puzzle her a bit, but at
last she smiles.

  “ ‘I know,’ she says. ‘You mean you
will die fighting. Is it not so, yes? And
I, I shall die singing.’

      10

  “She pulls herself up full and tall and
looks at the senor, who’s give up trailin’
his hand in the water since both hands is
all blistered and raw from his rowin’. He’s
lookin’ at her as if his eyes would burn
holes in her face, but she just smiles, gives
him a scornful little bow, and says, ‘Would
you like to hear me sing, senor, once more
before the end?’

  “She don’t wait for him to reply, but
turns to me. ‘And you, big man?’ she
says. ‘You would like it, eh?’

  “She makes a little bow as if she was
standin’ on a stage, throws her head back
and begins.

  “At first it was sort o’ husky, that voice
o’ hers. But soon it begins to fill out and
gets richer and richer and clearer and
clearer, and goes soarin’ out over the water
like the sound o’ eight bells from the flag-
ship of a squadron.

  ‘I feel new life cornin’ into me. I for-
get I’m thirsty, hungry, achin’. burnin’,
and go stumblin’ around, rousin’ the fel-
lers in the bottom o’ the boat, yellin’ at
’em, pullin’ at ’em, kickin’ ’em, I guess, till

I get them to
the oars. Then
I points to the
bump on the
horizon, which
don’t look no
bigger’n it did
before, and
tells ’em it’s a
ship.

  “The singer,
while I’m doin’
all this, is silent, but when I’m back at the
steerin’ sweep again she gives me a long
look, and takes up her singin’. For a time
the men at the oars don’t seem to know
what’ s goin’ on. They just pulls along,
without puttin’ any heart or muscle, which
maybe they ain’t got left, into it. By and
by they seem to hear the senora, and stop
rowin’ to listen.

  “Instantly she stopped singin’.

  “ ‘Row,’ she says in Spanish. ‘Row for
that ship. If you do not row, I shall not
sing.’ And then, to me, ‘Make them row,
big man.’

  “I didn’t have to make ’em. 'They catch
at the next song she starts and begin keep-
in’ time with their oars. This is a sweepy
sort o’ thing that seems to carry us along,
rollin’ and swellin’, dippin’ and swingin’.

  “And there we go scuddin’ across the
seas like a lot o’ crazy people, with nothin’
to make us go but this woman, singin’ like
a mermaid right out o’ the sea.
SHORT STORIES

  “And then her voice goes and cracks on
a high note. She drops onto the thwart,
her face in her hands, and begins to cry.

  “I don’t know what makes me look at
Gonsales. He’s the last one I’d ’a’ thought
of by my own self. But somethin’ pulls
me that way and I look, and catch my
breath.

  “His wicked face is changed. It ain’t
wicked no longer. It’s all lit up from the
inside and washed clean of the nastiness
and meanness of it. Very slow he gets
up and steps over to her, and stands there,
with his hand restin’ on her bowed head.
A moment like this, and he begins to sing
—and it sounded like the ruffle o’ drums
when the admiral comes over the side.

  “Say, I didn’t know whether I was
afloat or ashore. And them fellers at the
oars, they just pulled their bloomin’ guts
out.

  “Me, I gets an idea and yanks off what's

left o’ my shirt, sticks it on the end o’ the^
steerin’ oar, and begins wavin’ at that ship.
Can you beat that? Me, naked to the
waist, them fellers tuggin’ and sweatin'
with the last ounce o’ their dyin’ strength,

  A new sound cut in on the speaker. A
phonograph record had been started just
bafik of him by the young gunner’s-
mate.

  For an instant the weather-beaten face
of the old sailortnan showed disgust and
amazement at the interruption. Then
slowly his features quieted down and a
smile of recognition widened his mouth
and brought a twinkle into the gray blue
eyes beneath the shaggy white brows.

FIRST COVERED WAGON TRAIN

THE first emigrant train to cross the plains to California left Sapling Grove, Kansas in
May, 1841. An old French trapper had spread a story of the wonders of the Pacific coast
and with James Bidwell, later General Bid well of the United States Army, succeeded in per-
suading a number of families to make the journey.

    The Missourians of thaparty were skeptical at first, fearing that fever and ague abounded.
On being questioned as to this, the trapper replied that there was but one man in all California
who had ever had a chill, which was a matter of such wonderment to the people of Monterey
that they went 18 miles into the country to see him shake.

    When all was ready the wagons rendezvoused at Sapling Grove, and although several
families became disheartened at the last moment, sixty-nine persons began the long tedious
journey to the Pacific. The party was led by a man from Jackson County, Missouri, who
although not the best choice for the position would have deserted with his eight men had he
not been put in charge, seriously weakening the defensive force.

    The route lay from near Westport, now Kansas City, northwestward to Salt Lake City,
then southwest across the Nevada deserts. Cyclones, Indian scares, and other troubles
were prominent features of the journey, but the pioneers pushed on, accompanied by a mis-
sionary party which had joined them after leaving Sapling Grove. Half of the families de-
cided that the trackless wilderness was too much for them when they neared Fort Hall on
the Snake River, and they followed the missionary party into Oregon. The remainder,
thrown on their own resources without trail or guide, but none the less undaunted, deter-
mined to reach California or bust.

    They reached Salt Lake City in September, the settlement being known even then by that
name. Here the wagons, furniture, and everything possible was abandoned, and packs
made on the oxen. To add to their misfortunes game became scarce, necessitating the kill-
ing of the oxen.

    Fully incompetent for leadership the Jackson County man, Bartleson, deserted the party
several times with his men, but returned when hungry. Food was so scarce that crows and
even wildcats were shot to keep the people from starving, but when the San Joaquin Valley
was reached they found wild grapes and herds of antelope in abundance. Doctor Marsh’s
ranch was reached on November 4, 1841, where the party'was agreeably surprised to learn
that they were at last in California.—J. R. J.

BLUE OVERALLS—$1.75

            By CLEMENT WOOD

 THAT WAS THE SUM-ONE DOLLAR AND SEVENTY-FIVE CENTS—

 AND IN RAILROAD CIRCLES ALONG THE COLORADO-KANSAS STATE
 LINE THEY STILL TALK OF THE WAY IT WAS COLLECTED

IT DID not begin with the pair of blue
overalls that Nat Beale purchased at
the New Canterbury Emporium, it
did not even begin when old man
Stidham’s piebald calf strayed on the
Central Pacific tracks, just before the
Sunset Flyer was due. The armed dead-
lock between every self-respecting man in
Wallace County, Kansas, and every “thug
and hireling of the railroad”—the pro-
fanity has been edited out—commenced
when the C. P., secured from a spineless
legislature the right of way for a curve a
hundred yards long inside the Kansas
county, over the protest of every decent
citizen. The tension reached breaking-
point when the railroad placed its station
at Sinai, Colorado, a quarter of a mile
across the line, ignoring that pride of Kan-
sas, the thriving village of New Canter-
bury.

  The railroad was welcomed with closed
fists and hair-trigger guns. The cattlemen
saw in the roaring trains a potential mur-
derer of cows, calves, and profits; the
farmers swore that their stock was not
safe, and that the fall of cinders damaged
crops and threatened, during every dry
spell, a general conflagration. The wiliest
jo	.*65

 arguments concerning improved transpor-
 tation met only black disbelief.

   Pat Boggan, gaunt, blue-eyed foreman
 of the great Bar X ranch, phrased the gen-
 eral feeling, from his splint-bottomed
 throne in Lem Hodgkins’ New Canter-
 bury Emporium. “Bad enough to have
 thim murderin’ spalpeens killin’ cattle an’
 settin’ woods an’ cornrows on fire; but—”
 and his blue eyes flashed ominously, “—to
 have thim locate their blankety-blank sta-
 tion at that blankety-blank Sinai, without
 even a store—a cross-fields dump with
 only four run-down shacks, outside of the
 depot an’ that mangy little railroad ware-
 house—in Colorado, too—an’ with New
 Canterbury gleamin’ like another Dublin
 half a mile away—thim railroad folks is
 distracted.”

   “They had to consider the grade, Pat,”
 weakly urged a former hand on the Bar
 X, named Nat Beale.

   “Grade yer grandma! You talkin’ rail-
 road? I bet you gone an’ got a job with
 ’em! Out with it, aincher?” He scowled
 ferociously at the smaller man.

 “I wuz aimin’ to watch at the ware-
 house, if Judge Peck don’t need me.”
 “Andy needs hands, an’ you know it.
 You don’t want to work; never held on to
 a white man’s job yet. Loafin’ like a

greaser on the railroad payroll!”

 “Now, Pat-”

  “Mister Boggan. you pip-eyed loafer!
No railroad man calls me Pat—an’ don’t
fergit it!”

  “Oh, don’t get peeved.” He turned
easily from the scowling foreman to ad-
dress the proprietor, an intent listener to
the argument. “I didn’t come to talk to
no cowman, Lem. I wanted you should
sell me a pair uv blue overalls.”

  “If I had my choose,” said Hodgkins
deliberately, “you’d be the last man I’d
pick to sell anything to. But I ain’t in
business fer brotherly love. There you
are,” slapping down two dark blue gar-
ments, bright with gleaming brass buttons.
“One seventy-five, an’ two an’ a quarter.
Which’ll yer have?”

  Tentatively Beale fingered them.
“What’s the difference between ’em?”
“Fifty cents,” snapped Hodgkins.
“Four bits. Five dimes. Ten nickels.”
“Oh. I’ll take them there,” indicating
the cheaper garment. “Wrap ’em up, won’t
yer ?”

  “Paper an’ string free,” jeered Boggan.
‘You railroaders take everything you can
git, without payin’ fer it, I notice.”

  “No charge fer advice is there, Pat?”
He lingered over the name, and reached
for the package. “Just charge ’em, will
you, Lem?”

  “I will not.” Each word was thrust
out; the storekeeper squared stiff elbows
aggressively on the counter. “Spot cash
f'um railroaders, an’ don’t forgit it.
Gimme them overalls!”

  “Now, Lem, don’t be in such a pea-
green hurry! I’ll pay yer Sat’day night.
Ain’t got a pay-check f’um the railroad
yet. You know I ain’t got a cent. I gotter
have these here overalls to wear, I have.”
“Any mai\ that’s low-down enough to
work for the railroad—” commenced the
foreman suggestively.

  “Don’t mind that old crawfish. Just
till Sat’day night, Lem! I don’t owe you
nothin’, do I ?”

  “Never guv you a chance,” grumbled
the storekeeper.

  “Till Sat’day night-”

  “Oh, take ’em along. But you listen to
me, Nat Beale. If you don’t pay on time,
I'll make you dance in yer socks!”

 “Thanks, Lem. So long, Pat.” He
backed rapidly for the door, clutching the
precious parcel. “I don’t dance by my-
self,” he smirked irritatingly from the
door.

  A sudden motion of the foreman’s to-

wards his hip, and the small man leaped
sideways, rabbit-fashion, almost colliding
with two men who had suddenly turned
the corner. He escaped in the- anidst of a
rabid call-down for bis carelessness. The
two men shouldered into the store without
ceremony.

 Lem rose courteously. “Hello, Mr.
Stidham—hello, Mat. What’s botherin’
you boys?”

  “Bother enough,” growled the tough old
wreck called Stidham. “I just come f’um
Andy Peck’s.”

  Pat helped end. the pause. “That so ?”
“Just tried my case about that calf.”
He bristled again into silence.

  “Which calf was that?” urged the store-
keeper.

  “Piebald, run over by the Sunset Flyer.”
His mouth clamped again.

 “How much damages you git?” There
was real interest in Pat’s query.

  “Yes, ask ’im,” urged the second new-
comer sardonically. “How much damages
did you git, Stidham?”

  Each word came bitten clean. “Not a
danged cent. Danged if that Andy Peck
didn’t throw my case plumb out of court!”

II

OWMAN and storeman stared in

unbelief. “Not a cent-”

  “Gimme a plug.” Stidman settled
himself in a chair, and bit off a masculine
gouge. After a few preliminary chews, he
expanded. “You know, I sued that rail-
road, Lem, fer ninety-nine dollars—that’s
all the joorisdiction Andy’s got.”

  “That little piebald, eh?” Pat figured
professionally.

  “You mout er sold that calico calf fer
four-fifty,” agreed the storekeeper reflec-
tively.

  “Yes, man; but this was the railroad.”
Old Stidham chuckled. “Best way to im-
prove the breed of livestock is to cross ’em
with a C. P. engine, ain’t it? But—he
throwed the whole case out!”

  “Didn’t give you nothin’?”

  “Not a Mexican dime.”

 “No damages?”

  “Consarn his eyes, no! Dick Copeland,
that four-eyed station agent at Sinai, lie
swore he’d give me notice to keep my stock
off’n the tracks. All he did wuz to send
me a letter—how’d he expect me to guess
what wuz inside uv it? I thought it must
be f’um Gover’ment—taxes, or somethin’.
I aimed to bring it over for you to read.
Lem. I told Andy that letter hadn’t got
run over, an’ my po’ little calf had. Ast

him how he’d like to be a motherless calf,
an’ have his hind-quarters bi-sected an’

have to have his brains blowed out. Do
you know, Andy Peck had the gall to listen
to that four-eyed jackrabbit, an’ even made
me pay costs! Not that he’ll ever see ’em.
That man ain’t fitten to be judge uv
nothin’, sidin’ with the railroad.”

  “That’s straight talk.” The cattleman
squirmed in indignation to the front of his
seat. “Can’t you appeal, or nothin’ ?”

  “I could, I s’pose; but the higher up you
git, the bigger the railroad looks to them
judges. I got another idea.” He leaned
confidently closer. “Listen to this, boys.
When’s the next county election?”

  “Nex’ Tuesday, ain’t it?”

  “Well?” Stidham paused.

  Lem Hodgkins thudded a heavy fist
against the pine counter. “By Jasper,
you’ve said something! We’ll put some-
body up, an’ lick the hide off’n Andy Peck!
Sidin* with the railroad! But—ain’t it too
late to nominate?”

  “It’s never too late, when you got to do
something.”

  “Who’ll we put up?” Boggan shared in
the excitement.

  “Well,” the old farmer grew thought-
ful. “We got to have a tough, two-fisted,
two-gun man, who loves the railroad like
a rattler. Somebody we can trust to bust
the lights an’ liver out uv that danged cor-
poration, every chance he gets. Ain’t I
right ?”

  “Mmm—yes.” Boggan’s blue eyes were
thoughtful; he tugged reflectively at his
scrawny moustache. “That’s about it.
Somebody who’ll always give justice
against the railroad.”

  “In other words, hittin’ ’em hard every
chance, eh?”

 “Mmm— Yes.”

  “Well? Who do you think?”

  “Doc’ Landsay?”

  “Too busy.”

  “You?”

  “Too old.” Stidham grined. “An’ too
cussed.”

  “Bill Heidt, fum Flying P?”

  “Too wu’thless. It’s gotter be some-
body we kin trust, Pat.”

  “Out with it. What’s on yer so-called
mind, Stidham ?”

    10

    “Namely, Mr. Patrick Boggan, fore-
man.”

  “Go wan !”

  “I mean it. You gotta be judge. You’ll
back me, Lem?”

  “Sure. I’m chairman of elections, too.”
  “It’s won already! Ye’ll do it, Pat?”

  “I don’t know any law-”

  “Trouble with most judges is, that’s all
they do know. You know the railroad’s

always wrong-”

  “I know that, but then-”

  “Boys, it’s a go! Me ’n’ Mat here will
notify all the boys, an’ Tuesday, Andy gets
a free ride into private life! This is good.
I like things done legal—when they can
be, of course: When a judge sides with
the railroad, in Wallace County, it’s about
time for a new deal!”

  Four brawny right hands clasped on the
matter; four minds had but a single
thought, and four hearts beat as a multi-
plied one.

Ill

FIVE intent faces bent over the Em-
porium’s counter, at eight o’clock
on the evening of the next Tues-
day. All day the nearer farmers and
hands had strolled in, and the further
ranchers and cowmen had loped by; not
a one entered without a whispered word
from Stidham or his helpers. Some had
seen the light, some had not; it was up
to the chairman of elections to do his best.
The acrid smell of kerosene came from
the three glass lamps. Lem Hodgkins wet
his purple pencil on his lips, and added up
the figures for the third time. He beamed
upon the crowd. “Pat Boggan is elected
justice, 49 votes to none!”

  The candidate wore a puzzled look. “No
votes a-tall for Andy ?”

  “I don’t see a one,” Lem shook a de-
cided head.

  Old man Stidham, sitting on the cracker
box where all votes not for Boggan had
been deposited, chuckled slightly. “Not a
vote in sight.”

  “There’s one.” Mat, the helper, pointed
to a slip of paper off by itself.

  “Just hand that here,” ordered Stidham.
“Might as well count it,” grudged
Hodgkins consolingly. “It’ll look like
Andy put in one vote for hisself. Pat,
you’re our lawfully elected judge.” He
marked down another figure carefully.
“49 to 1—a bigger majority than Free
Silver got. Now, gentlemen, a real job:
we’ll just pop over an’ notify Andy Peck.”
‘You’re needin’ us?” urged Stidham.
i68

SHORT STORIES

  “An’ your guns, gentlemen. The law
must be obeyed.”

  The buggy held the stout storekeeper
beside Mr. Stidham; Boggan, his assistant
foreman, and Mat, Stidham's helper,
mounted their horses, and trotted off after
the buggy through the chilly Kansas night.
Down the hill to the curved hundred yards
of railroad track 011 Kansas soil, then
along the road that climbed beside the
state line to the turnpike, and down this
to the second farm on the upland.

  They turned in at the gate; a wild
clamor of dogs suddenly woke.

  A man, lamp in hand, appeared in the
doorway. “Who’s thar?”

  “It’s me, Andy Peck, Lem Hodgkins.
Me an’ a party. Call off them dogs.”
“Come on in. They wouldn’t hurt a
horned toad.” Andy Peck led the way to
the dining-room table, and set down the
lamp on the one spot clear of papers. He
rubbed his judicial hands importantly to-
gether. “I wuz just studyin’ out a case I
got to decide tomorrow,” he explained,
with shy pride.

  “We’ll save you the trouble,” said Hodg-
kins briefly. “At the election today, duly
called an’ held, Mr. Patrick Boggan was
elected Justice of the Peace; 49 votes to
one for you, Andy. You just hand over
them papers peaceable, an’ we won’t say
nothin’ more about it.”

  The room grew suddenly tense. Peck
pushed his chair back from the table with
a harsh grating sound, and half rose. He
could feel the pressure of his pistol against
the back of the chair, and shifted his body
a trifle, to free it. “Don’t talk foolishness,
Lem Hodgkins. That warn’t no election.”
His eyes rolled from one to another of the
group, and sank before the steely deter-
mination there. His brain worked rapidly.
“I’d like to know why not!”

  A laugh that sounded easy. “For about
a hundred reasons. I wuz the only man

nominated-”

  “They wrote in
Pat’s name.”

  “He ain’t been
a legal citizen of
the State long
enough.”

  “He’s to pass
on that; he’s
judge, ain’t he?”
“No, he ain’t.
Anyhow,” Peck rose and assumed a non-
chalant pose beside the door opening into
the darkness of the house. His eye meas-
ured the distance to the lamp; pity it was

on the far side of the table! “Anyhow,
my own term don’t expire for four months
yet. Good night, gentlemen.” Aimlessly
his hand swung against his side.

  “No you don’t!’"barked out from Mat;
he pulled his own gun half out of its hol-
ster. “We’re five to one, Andy. Better
be reasonable.”

  A bitter gleam flashed across the face of

the cornered farmer. “I’ll see you-”

  “Stiddy, stiddy.” Pat Boggan rose
heavily to his feet. His hand roved in a
wide gesture of command. He moistened
his lips slowly, and launched out upon his
first public address. “Andy, when in the
course of human events it becomes neces-
sary fer a man to git, he ought to git with
as little trouble as possible.”

  “Hear! Hear!”

  “It is now time for you to git.” The
tongue did duty again against the dry lips.
“I want to be Justice, an’ almost all of the
qualified voters—all exceptin’ one of the
votes counted—want me to be justice. I
command you, in the name of the Con-
stitootion of the State of Kansas and of
the Newnited States of America, to git!
Otherwise, you will compel me, as Justice,
to hold you for contempt of court, inter-
ferin’ with an officer in the discharge of
his bounden duty, an’ general cussedness.’’

  “You can’t make me-”

  “Stiddy, stiddy!”. The foreman’s pale
blue eyes pierced compellingly out of his
gaunt face. “Furthermore, Andy, please
notice that Lem Hodgkins is on our com-
mittee. I’ve had a little talk with him,
about the mortgage on this farm that he
holds. If you don’t vamoose pronto, it’s
by-by farm. Get it?”

  Peck squared his shoulders against the

door jamb. “You can’t threaten-”

  “I ain’t. We’re peaceable men, Andy;
but there’s five of us, an’ each of us is got
two guns. Do you resign peaceable?”
For a moment the visitors feared re-
gretfully that there would be peace. Then
it happened all at once. Peck had hurled
himself on his knees into the dark hall;
there was the gleam as his gun seemed to
leap from the holster.

  But Mat was quicker. He threw him-
self beside the other man, and clipped
down with all his might against the gun
arm. “No you don’t!” he snarled.

  Shaken and unnerved, Peck was jerked
back to his feet and into the light. The
four men faced him, their hands negli-
gently ready on their hips.

  “Do you resign peaceable?” Pat re-
peated meekly.

                                                  10

  Andy was a reasonable man; he was
persuaded. Relieved of his gun, he bun-
dled up the papers, and delivered them to
the new justice, thereby installing him in
his post.

  “You can get your gun at my place in
the morning,” Hodgkins called back as
they passed out of the gate. “Better be
good, Andy.” Without a chuckle the cav-
alcade commenced its brisk trot back to-
ward the New Canterbury Emporium.

  “Pat,” Lem called the new arm of the
law over to him, “I got the first case for
you already.”

  “Bootleg stuff?” grined Stidham.

  “A real law case. Pat’s witness an’
judge too. You know them blue overalls
Nat Beale bought uv me last week?
Sat’day night I ast him for my money, an’
he just laughed at me. Said he’d see me
somewhere first—an’ it wasn’t Kansas he
mentioned, either. I’m goin’ to sue him,
an’ garnishee the Central Pacific for his
salary.”

  “I don’t know nothin’ about law, Lem

  “That’s all right; I got the garnishee-
ment blank all made out. All you got to
do is come along with me over to Sinai,
an’ serve this paper on Dick Copeland, the
station agent. Then the money’s ours.
Law’s easy as easy, if you’re judge.”
“Good. Tonight?”

  “He closes station at six.”

  “Tomorrer mornin’, then, I’m your man.
We’ll ride over together.”

  “Righto. Railroad better stop, look, an’
listen now, eh. Judge?”

  “We’ll make ’em dance! Just you
watch.”

IV

SHORTLY after sun-up, the new
justice of the peace and his efficient
election chairman set out on the
short jog over to Sinai station. The road
led down to the curve of the railroad
within Walace County, turned, and crossed
the state line. The storekeeper drew rein,
and surveyed the sister commonwealth be-
fore him disgustedly. “Bum lookin’ place,
Colorado, ain’t it, Pat?”

  Boggan inspected the land in front, and
turned back for a view of the landscape,
absolutely similar, that they had just left.
“Reg’lar hole, Colorado is, Lem.”

  “Yeah. Kansas fer mine.”

  They continued a quarter of a mile
along a rocky gulch, at whose level head
the station had been placed.

      10

  “Got your gun?” Hodgkins whispered
to Boggan, as they topped the last rise,
with tbe station just before them.

  “Have I got my face?” asked Pat dis-
gustedly. “But, remember, we won’t need
’em. This is to be peaceable, Lem. I’m
an officer of the law now, an’ I’m goin’ to
preserve law an’ order, come what dares."

  “Yonder’s Copeland now," whispered
the storekeeper excitedly. “Thought we’d
jump him.”

  As they drew up at the platform, the
agent nodded absentniindedly, and hurried

inside. The
two men left
their horses,
and walked
briskly in.

  “Mornin’,”
the railroad of-
ficial looked at
them over his
glasses in some bewilderment. “You want
a ticket to somewheres?”

  “We don’t.” Pat winked at his asso-
ciate significantly.

  The agent .stared at them. “Want any-
thing ?”

  “We do.” The new justice scowled
truculently.

  “Well, spit it out.” Copeland slammed a
drawer open, glanced within, and drove
it shut again. He had found this mysteri-
ously effective. “Why—what’s this?”

  He picked up the paper with a puzzled
stare, as, swelling with importance, Bog-
gan pushed it through the grating to him.

  “It’s a garnisheement,” he explained
proudly. “Can’t you read?”

  Slowly Copeland spelled aloud the awk-
ward lettering. “Lemuel Hodgkins, doing
bussiness as the New Canterbury Em-
porium, Plaintiff v. Nat Beale, Deaf’t.
The Cent. Pac. Railroad, Garnish. $1.75.”
He sniffed contemptuously, and tossed it
back. “Just put it in your pocket, Pat, and
trot along. I’m busy.”

  “This is a-”

  “It’s a joke, I reckon,” Copeland
yawned. “I’m too busy to joke this morn-
ing. I got work to do. Come back some
other time.”

  The veins on the judge’s neck bulged
out; his eyes glittered. “You goin’ to pay
that money?”

  “Soon as somebody leaves me a million.
Trot along, Pat.”

  “Look here. Dick Copeland, you ain’t
talkin’ to me—you’re talkin’ to my joo-
dicial office. You’re talkin' to the judge
170

SHORT STORIES

  “Haven’t got time to talk to nobody.”
Copeland turned his back a moment, to
bring forward a bulky report book.

  Hodgkins gave Boggan a nudge, and
pointed significantly. The agent, warned
by some unnumbered sense, looked up, and
into the chilly end of a big six-shooter.

  “Put that up, you big—” He stam-
mered slightly.

  “Stiddy, stiddy. You’re talkin’ to the
law, you are. Are you goin’ to pay that
dollar sixty-five?”

  “Seventy-five, Pat,” whispered the solic-
itous plaintiff.

  “Seventy-five, I says, an’ costs. Will
you take it out of Nat ceale’s salary?”
Copeland’s mouth became a straight line.
This was not in the contract, but he would
have to see it through. “Don’t be an idiot,
Boggan. Put up that gun. There aren’t
any more bad men in Colorado. Of course
I'm not going to pay it.”

  “Ain’t, hey?”

  “Good lord, no. Beat it—I’ve got to
work.”

  This was a complication. Justice was
plainly being flouted; there seemed no way
to pierce the nonchalance of the station
agent. Boggan kept at him doggedly.
“Why?”

  “Oh, for nine milion reasons. But one’s
enough, you Kansas jack-rabbit.” Cope-
land laughed frankly now; Boggan had
laid his gun aside, and relief spoke in the
agent’s voice. “This is Colorado, you
tanktown constable—and not Kansas. If
you had the brains of a dead nanny-goat,
you’d a known that yourself, and not come
pesterin’ around with your dinky little
writs. Your authority stops with the
State of Kansas. Don’t you know that,
you sawed-off runt.”

  Boggan held in his freshet wrath with
difficulty. Lem, face puzzled, turned to-
ward his friend. “That sounds reason-
able, Pat. Is that the law?”

  Judge Boggan forgot his ignorance, and
replied meditatively, “Well, that depends
011 the construction I put on it.”

  The agent laughed immoderately. “Con-
struction your aunt’s red-nosed grand-
mother! What do you think you are—
the Soopreme Court of the League of Na-
tions? Every bit of law in the world be-
gins with the proposition that a judge has
joorisdiction so far and no further—and
you’re a darned sight further. It’s up to
you to backtrack.” Pat’s blank face in-
spired him to push home the point. “Why,
man, the English Common Law, the Con-
stitootion of the United States and every

State in the Union, and every decision of
every court in the world, has decided that.
You’ll have to reverse all that before your
dinky little writ would amount to anything.
D’you realize that?”

  Boggan’s pale blue eyes looked musingly
at the representative of the railroad. “I
might do just that, Dick.”

  The latter exploded. “You make me
snicker! Do it, please! And listen to me,
you poor little cinder; the Central Pacific
hasn’t time to bother with fly-specks like
you, no matter what the law is. The Cen-
tral Pacific’s big enough law for this place.
Get that?”

  Boggan’s eye fixed him coldly. “So
your policy, Mr, Station Agent, is that the
railroad will let its men live in Kansas, and
trade in Kansas, and run up bills there,
and dodge payment, and the railroad won’t
lift a hand to assist in getting lawful an’
just debts paid an’ settled?”

  “Not a paw,” sneered Copeland. He
was not so much at ease now; his tongue
had carried him a station beyond his in-
tention.

  “And the Central Pacific won’t pay any
attention to me and my writs, no matter
how legal they are?” Boggan’s voice was
as smooth as cornsilk, and as unemotional.

  “Not a bit. Put that in your mouth and
chew it!”

  “This ain’t the finish.” With solemn
dignity the judge turned. “And may God
help you an’ the Central Pacific, when I
get after you!” He walked out; Hodg-
kins, face uncomprehending, close beside
him.

  Without a word Boggan mounted his
horse, and set its head toward the dusty
haze beyond which lay Kansas. Without
a word Hodgkins trotted after him. He
realized now that somehow the leadership
had passed out of his hands. Some mighty
thought was shaping in that furrowed brow
beside and a trifle ahead of him, that was
certain. There was a dangerous hard glint
in the eyes, that spelled trouble, in capitals,
for somebody. Hodgkins thought to him-
self that if a man with those eyes started
after him, it would be an excellent time
to take to his cyclone-cellar.

  “Well, Judge—” he commenced awk-
wardly.

  Boggan for the first time beamed.
“Don’t ask me no questions, Lem; you do
as I say. You be at the railroad, at the
Kansas curve, at seven o’clock tonight.
Have a couple of men along. Lemme see;
the local passes at 7:30, doesn’t she?”
“An’ the Sunset Flyer at eight.”

  “That’s so, too— Mmm— Two men,
a wagon, and a half dozen logs from be-
hind your place, bigger around than rail-
road ties. Regular whoppers. Got that
right? I’ll bring a red lantern, and any-
thing necesary. And before we collect

  “Seventy-five, Pat; don’t forget that

dime-”

  “Don’t worry, Lem; the railroad’ll wish
it had paid us ten times—a hundred times
that much, before it got Judge Patrick
Boggan on the warpath! Two men, a
wagon, the logs—at seven. Without fail!”
“I’m there, Pat, with whistles tootin’!”

V

  AT TEN minutes to seven, Lem Hodg-
kins, with two trusted neighbors,
X jL arrived with the wagon load of logs
at the Kansas curve, the brief railroad
stretch within the county. Judge Boggan
was nowhere in sight.

  “We’re early,” he explained. He climbed
down to stretch his legs.

  The ten minute stretch dragged. Seven
o’clock, and still no Boggan.

  “He’ll be here any minute,” Hodgkins
explained. He felt more reassured, after
he had said it.

  Ten—fifteen—twenty minutes passed,
and still no Pat. Anxiously the store-
keeper’s eye scanned the horizon toward
Colorado, where the train would soon ap-
pear; fretfully he studied the hill road
behind, down which Judge Pat should long
ago have put in his appearance.

  “I don’t know what’s happened to him;
I’m sure he said seven.”

  Five—seven minutes more.

  “Thar’s her smoke,” one of the men
pointed excitedly.

  A despairing survey of the hill road,

hazy in the dusk. Why there-

  “An’—an’ there he comes!”
Lickety-split down the slope Pat gal-
loped. As he came nearer, they saw the un-
lit lantern dangling from his arm. He
flung himself over the saddle, face pant-
ing. “Pile them logs on the track pronto,
Lem; had to look everywhere to get this
red lantern. Hurry!”

  He knelt in the dust of the road, trying
to light it. The others watched him open-
mouthed. “Hurry!” the judge com-
manded.

  The first match went out on him; he
heard the first log fall into place, he heard
the whistle of the approaching train at
the grade crossing a third of a mile away.
The second match sputtered feebly. Des-
10

perately he pushed it down through the
air, the flame leading. It showed brief
blue vitality, then grew golden. A trem-
bling hand slid it along the wick. There!
Lighted at last!

  “Pile that second one on. There!”

  Agilely Pat jumped up. one foot on each
log, and started waving the red signal up
and down.

  The sky to the west was lit in a moment
with a red glare of welcome, the rails
trembled in eagerness to hold the vast
monster, as round the far curve it swung
into sight.

  “Hi, Pat,” screamed Hodgkins. “It’ll
hit you!”

  “I’ll crow-hop,” shouted the judge.
“Stand back.”

  It did not seem humanly possible that the
train could come to a standstill in so short
a distance. Boggan, just as he imagined
he felt the fiery breath of the iron mon-
ster envelop him, flung himself toward the
road, his legs working like agitated pistons.
Every moment he expected to hear the
crash as the train hit the logs, and to feel
them hurtling through the air after him.
A screeching of brakes, a grinding of
wheels, and the train came to a standstill
less than fifteen feet from the obstruction.

  Without delay, fireman, engineer, con-

ductor, several guards, came running up.

  “What in the devil does this mean?”
shouted the engineer.

  Out of his breast pocket Judge Patrick
Boggan drew with great dignity a sheet
of legal-cap, and read in a loud voice:
“This engine, the property of the Central
Pacific Railroad, is hereby and heretofore
attached, to be held on to in satisfaction
of a debt of $1.75 owed by Nat Beale to
Lemuel Hodgkins, doing business as the
New Canterbury Emporium.”

  Engineer, fireman, guards, conductor,
stormed and raged; the air grew dusky
with profanity. Boggan would not be
moved.

  They withdrew for an excited confer-
ence. The conductor swaggered brusquely
over to him. “This is a mail train; you’re
interfering with the United States mail.
172

SHORT STORIES

That’s a penitentiary offense. We’re go-
ing through those logs. I’ll report this to
the government.”

  Pat blanched a trifle; his hand inched
back toward his gun.

  The conductor read the motion. His
face paled and stiffened; abruptly he
turned his back. If it had to come—
“A penitentiary offense,” he grunted. “Go
ahead, Tom. Give her all you've got.”
Pat’s fingers clenched the automatic
impotently. With the whole government
against him— The engine rumbled, quiv-
ered, backed a score of yards. Then,
while the judge, plaintiff, and the two
helpers gazed helplessly at the thing, it
gathered sudden momentum and threw the
two V-placed logs aside as gently as if
they had been wisps of stubble. Two tri-
umphant toots, and it disappeared in the
distance.

  “Can you beat that!” groaned Hodgkins.
“You bet I can,” Boggan muttered
through set teeth. “Tell me, Lem—is the
Sunset Flyer a mail train?”

  “I dont’ think so.”

  “It dont’ make no difference. Pile on
all them logs, men. This time we got ’em!”

VI

THEY did a better job this time, fix-
ing the apex of the V toward the
direction from which the transcon-
tinental express would come. All seven
logs were placed on the pile; an engine
would split itself against such an obstacle.

  The storekeeper made an important find
—an unlocked box of way tools left a few
rods down the track. At Boggan’s direc-
tion, the men brought out crowbars and
sledges. “Maybe we can get the first rail

loose-”

  “There she comes!”

  Again the judge mounted the logs, and
wigwagged the red warning.

  The mighty train, warned by the signals
that the local had just left the block, was
running easily; she stopped two score feet
away. Again the officials came on the run.

  Pat read his notice again; but this time
he included the tracks, the first car, and
the right of way.

  Before he could finish, a fussy person-
age elbowed his way through the uni-
formed officials. “What’s this? What’s
this? What are we stopping here for?”

  In a moment he had half a dozen ex-
planations.

  “Oh, stop, stop! This is outrageous!
I’m Mr. Lessing, Vice-President of the

road. I never heard of such a thing!”

  “If your depot agents are sassy as Dick
Copeland, you’ll hear of it again,” said
Pat grimly.

  “There he comes now!” cried Hodgkins,
excitedly.

  Sure enough, around the bend in the
road, the agent was approaching on horse-
back.

  He flung himself off his saddle, glaring
wildly through his glasses. “That man is
crazy!” he gasped.

  “The law is never crazy,” corrected the
dignified justice.

  The vice-president sized up the situa-
tion. “Said he wouldn't pay any attention
to your writs, did he ? I think you’re
legally within your rights, my man. I’ll

pay the bill out of my own pocket-”

  “Not this day.” Pat Boggan’s jaws
closed like a wolf trap. “The railroad had
its chanct; I wuz informed you’d pay no
attention to the law. I hold this engine,

car, right of way, tracks-”

  The worried general official offered to
give .bond to cover the garnishment, or pay
any amount Boggan would name. His
blue eyes snapping, the homespun judge
remained inflexible. “Sinai Station may
not be within my joorisdiction, but this
curve is. Am 1 right, Mr. Four-eyes?
Here I am, and here I stay.”

  “Take your engine, then,” the conductor

sneered coldly. “This is a mail train-”

  “Your first car isn’t carryin’ mail.”
  “It’s owned by the Pullman Company

  “They don’t own the tracks an’ the
right of way.”

  “Ah, fishhooks! I’ll get a switch engine,
and butt the train into the next station.
You put the engine in your pocket, if you

want to-”

  For one second, the judge was stumped.
He had a mental picture of the poor engine
and its car being butted ignominiously out
of Kansas, into lowly Colorado, carrying
with it his own defeat. Should he submit
to this? His hesitation ended before the
second ticked; his blue eyes were like
levelled guns. “Then I’ll tear up your
tracks, an’ pile ’em in my back yard; I’ll
put an armed posse on this right of way,
that will tie up traffic till my case is fin-
ished, if it takes till—till Colorado freezes
over!”

  Well, what could they do? There was
nothing left but to submit, as gracelessly
as possible, to the law. as embodied in the
gaunt man with the piercing blue eyes and
the scrawny moustache.

    “Have a heart, Judge,” the vice-presi-
 dent pleaded. “We’ll switch this en-
 gine back to the siding a quarter o£ a mile
 away, and let you have it, if you’ll release
 the tradks and the right of way and what-
 ever else you’re after.”

   Boggan’s face beamed; what had been
 hidden in his mind slowly emerged. “You

 give me that
 switch engine
 at Sinai as se-
 curity, and I’ll
 let you go
 right through
 —if you’ll do
 two things.”
 His eyes grew
 bright, at the
 realization o f
 his power to
 • aid the community. “You know we wanted
 a station hers at New Canterbury, instead

 of that dump of a Sinai-”

    “I’m familiar with that,” hurriedly the
 general officer spoke.

    “Give us that station, then; dismguitle
 your place at Sinai—that’s first. Second,
 you’ll agree to pay attention to any an’ all
 court papers from my court.” He drew
 himself up cockily.

    The local men gasped in admiration; the

vice-president studied him shrewdly.

  “Mr. Judge, you’re a reasonable man. I
can’t guarantee the station for you, but
we’ve been discussing the change, and I’ll
pledge you my word that I ’11 do my utmost
to get it for you. And I can assure you
that your writs will receive as much atten-
tion as a mandamus from the United
States Supreme Court, as long as you’re

011	the bench. Will that suit?"

  Judge Boggan drew a long breath. “I'll
take your switch engine and your word,
sir. Go ahead.”

  The switch engine was hurriedly backed
down onto the siding; the Sunset Flyer re-
sumed her journey, two and a half hours
late. At the termination of the suit o£
Hodgkins, etc., vs, Beale, three weeks later,
the railroad paid judgment promptly. The
check was handed to the judge by Dick
Copeland’s successor at Sinai.

  “I’ll be moving over to Kansas next
month,” he said affably, while Pat finished
the crude receipt. “Soon as we get a root'
on the temporary station. You must a had
some pull with general offices, to get the
change.”

  “Not me,” the jurist evaded modestly.
“That Vice-President’s got something over
his shoulders beside a roof. He respects
the law.”

THE FAMOUS SHARPS RIFLE

ONE of the most famous rifles of the Old West was the Sharps. This rifle, invented about
1855, was one of the first successful breech loaders produced; in fact, in 1861 it was the
only reliable-weapon of its kind manufactured in the United States. The Sharps was equipped
with a vertically sliding breech block, and used at first a conical bullet in a paper or linen
cartridge which was fired by a percussion cap or a flat percussion plate held in the priming
lock. Loading was accomplished by dropping down the breech block and inserting the
paper cartridge in the rear of the barrel. When the block was pulled up, by means of a lever
forming the trigger guard, the end of the cartridge was sheared off, exposing the powder to
the flash hole in the block. A percussion cap was then placed in the nipple leading to the
flash hole and the gun was ready to fire. The paper cartridge was quickly replaced by one of
brass, greatly improving the firearm.

    The Sharps was issued to a few British regiments in 1857, and shortly after the start of
the Civil War its issue in carbine form was begun to United States Cavalry.

    When the Henry repeating rifle appeared most of the other rifles were driven off the
market, but the Sharps single-shot retained its popularity for many years. This was due
largely to its powerful cartridge which was splendid for large game and long ranges. It was
the Sharps that killed off the buffalo. So popular was it with hunters of that animal that
a special model was produced known commonly as the “buffalo gun.” This was supplied
with a heavy octagon barrel, usually of .45 or .50 calibre, using the paper cartridge. With
the invention of the brass cartridge the gun was changed to the hammerless type, the shell
containing as much as 120 grains of black powder and a bullet weighing 550 grains. The
popularity of the arm is accounted for in a comparison of its cartridge with that of the best
of other rifles, the Henry, which used a shell containing only 28 grains of powder and 200
grains of lead.—J. R. J.

“WE HAVE WITH US TODAY-”

AFTER reading “The Ghost of the
Golconda,” which begins in this is-
sue, which, by the way, will be published
as a cloth-bound book by Doubleday, Page

&	Company shortly after its completion in
Short Stories, we started wondering just
how much truth there could be in the wide-
spread belief that the Congressional Record
is a dry-as-dust old tome! At least we’re
willing to wager that William N. Vaile’s
contributions to that worthy publication
are pithy, interesting and to the point.
Concerning himself and this, his first nov-
el, Vaile writes:

  “Born in the centennial year at Kokomo,
Indiana. My father«. and grandfather
were lawyers. Grandfather also ran an
abolition newspaper in Indiana before the
war, conducted a station of the “under-
ground railway” and got tarred and feath-
ered once or twice for his (in those days)
exceedingly radical anti-slavery views. As
a child I used to be filled with horrible yet
humorous fascination when I visualized
that stiff and solemnly dignified man en-
during such a cruel but grotesque torture.

  “Your present autobiographer graduated
from Yale University in 1898. I served
as a private in the Spanish War but the
Spaniards have no cause of complaint
against me as I never got out of the U. S.
Afterward studied law at Harvard and at
the University of Colorado and practised
law until my first election to Congress in
1918. I was a candidate two years before
that but was licked. Of course the only
reason for that—aside from the popularity
and ability of my opponent—was that I
was absent from my district during the
campaign, being an officer of the Colorado
National Guard, on duty at the Mexican
border. The duty consisted mainly of
chasing Mexican children away from the

city dump of Douglas, Arizona.

  “Since that time the folks at home have
been very good to me and have just re-
elected me for a fourth term.

  “I have lived since early childhood in
Denver except for several years on a farm
near there. My regular political opponent
used to say that farmers called me a law-
yer, that lawyers called me a farmer and
that I could prove an alibi on either count.
So far, nobody has accused me of being a
writer, but if the editor should make that
allegation I wo.uld plead nolo contendere.

  “I suppose you want to know what I
have been doing in Congress. My con-
stituents often ask me the same thing. My
work has been chiefly on legislation relat-
ing to immigration, naturalization, public
lands and war veterans. I was one of the
draftsmen of the Immigration Restriction
Acts of 1921 and 1924 (the ‘3 per cent.’
and ‘2 per cent.’ laws) being one of the
conferees responsible—for good or ill—for
the final language of those two measures.
I have to my credit a little bill, now enacted
into law, extending the provisions of the
Federal Employes’ Compensation Act. At
present I am serving on a joint committee
to work out an adjustment of the old
Northern Pacific land grants.

  “I have not traveled much except in the
United States, but have made two trips to
Canada (before Prohibition) and three to
the West Indies and Central America.

  “I tried to write a little twenty years ago,
but with no success. Tackled it again
three years ago. (Of course you will un-
derstand that I don’t want all my words
buried forever in the Congressional Rec-
ord). Haven’t had much time to write (of
course I may have more after next elec-
tion) but have accumulated enough rejec-
tion slips to paper the wall of my office
and haven’t wasted much money in return
postage that wasn’t used. Still, I have

managed to get by the guillotine with a few
short stories. ‘The Ghost of the Golcon-
da’ is my first offense as a novel; but I do
not want to commit myself to abstinence in
the future.

   “In it I have tried to take a sympathetic
glance backward at the old feverish mining
camps which were passing away when I
was a youngster and to give also something
of the flavor of those camps as they exist
today. There is 110 didactic purpose but
I have allowed myself to express here and
there the voice of the sound Americanism
which was inherent in the old period but
which speaks just as vigorously in the new.

William N. Vaile.”

THE RED GODS SMILE

HIS name was O’Brien, and he was
about as tattered and unshorn a
tramp as one could find—unlovely to the
extreme until one saw the smile wrinkles
about his blue-green eyes. He had stowed
away upon a nitrate freighter, and had
been kicked ashore, dead broke, at Anto-
fagasta.

  “Where d’you hail from?” queried a
benefactor who had yielded the price of a
meal and lodging.

  “Oh—out there—anywhere,” vaguely
waving an arm over half the swing of the
compass.

  “But I mean, where’s your home? What
country?” persisted the new friend.

  O’Brien chuckled. A look of the far
horizons underlay the laughter, though.
“Home?” he repeated softly. “Well, ye

might say Australia. Yep. Ye see, I
ain’t ever been there yet, but I’m goin’!”
If Eric Howard, who on the occasion of
his first Short Stories offering writes
in a similar vein of himself, runs across
O’Brien in Peru, or Macao, or beyond
Ballarat, may there be a handclasp and an
understanding.

  “I was born with the wanderlust, and it
has been pronounced incurable. During
the last ten or fifteen years I’ve wandered
back and forth, up and down, across the
country, seeing with commendable thor-
oughness America first. Mexico, South
America, Europe, the South Seas and the
Orient are all scheduled. For many
months past I’ve made old Santa Fe my
headquarters, doing by horse and flivver
the country roundabout. I’ve witnessed In-
dian dances more dramatic and colorful
than a Morris Gest production; I’ve
lived in Indian pueblos and have made
friends with these survivors of a great
and noble race; I’ve given them abalone
shells from the Pacific and they’ve given
me turquoise and pottery in return.

  “From here 1 shall go into the Navajo
country, and to Hopiland, reaching Oraibi
in time for the famous snake dance. After
that? I don’t know. Perhaps La Ciudad
de Mejico y America del Sur. It’s a large
world, and one must keep going.

Eric Howard.”

  Walbridge Dudley put the jodey on the
stamped return envelope sent with “Head
Work,” his first Short Stories tale.
Therefore, the envelope went back to him
—empty. He tells how he wove the
spell.

  “Born Chicago, 1887. Armour Scien-
tific Academy, 1904. University of Chi-
cago, ex-1908. Since then the advertis-
ing and news syndicate publicity business
in all branches. Have lived in Chicago,
New York City, Wisconsin, Georgia, Ari-
zona, California, Wyoming—the last three
during a year and a half of ranching and
farming done with the idea of securing fic-
tion material. All my life I have written
as a relaxation, mostly practice in cadence,
integration and so on as occasion offered,
especially during a year in the army. Un-
til lately seldom submitted anything to the
magazines, not thinking it good enough.
During the past year, however, have been
writing more and more, still mostly prac-
tice exercises. I have been so fortunate
as to sell most of my writing in this period
of discipline; of my last six yarns ‘Head
Work’ was the fourth accepted, and I be-
lieve my seventh attempt to storm the well
guarded portals of Short Stories, which

I	hope to enter again from time to time.
It was a delight to write ‘Head Work,’ in
fact writing is a real joy to me; so if your
readers take only half as much pleasure in
the reading as I did in the writing of it, I
shall experience a payment that no check,
no matter how liberal, could possibly equal.

H. W. Dudley.”

NO MAIL BAG THIS TIME

THROUGH reasons having to do
solely with the inclusion of one par-
ticularly good tale in this present issue, we

have been forced to omit from the Circle
the department of letters from our friends
and foes. Since we have a number of
splendid letters on hand, and certainly hope
to read hundreds more during the next
fortnight, we’ll try to give The Mail Bag
extra space in the next issue.

 THE MAKING OF A KILLER

OUT of a fight he would have avoided
if possible, Bob Haskell emerged
with slitted eyes and smoking guns. Two
men lay dead on the floor, men who had
earned bloody names in the range country.
From that moment Haskell was a man
apart, a skilled and merciless slayer—or so
the story grew.

  Hired to terrorize sheep herders, he
comes to the point where his greatest
strength and manhood are required to
combat the ugly thing which has attached
itself to his name. Read “Haskell of the
Dug-Out Hills,” a fascinating complete
novel by the much admired Frank C. Rob-
ertson, which heads the next issue of
Short Stories.

  Do you personally favor the system of
presenting an eighty thousand word serial
in two issues instead of four? Read the
final big installment of William N. Vaile’s
great mine mystery, “The Ghost of the
Golconda,” and then give us your reaction
as a guide to future policy.

   Besides these two features, the next num-
ber will contain one of W. C. Tuttle’s in-
imitable Mexican stories, “The Fate of the
Wolf”; Anthony M. Rud presents a story
of the Nevada diamond fields, “Smoky
Treasure”; and there will be excellent short
stories by Don Cameron Shafer, Frank
Richardson Pierce, Douglas Newton, Rich-
ard Howells Watldns, H. M. Sutherland
and others.

Letters typical of thousands
telling of the amazing power
of one simple fresh food

NOT a “cure-all,” not a medicine in any
sense—Fleischmann’s Yeast is simply
a remarkable fresh food.

   The millions of tiny active yeast plants
in every cake invigorate the whole system.
They aid digestion—clear the skin—banish
the poisons of constipation. Where cathar-
tics give only temporary relief, yeast
strengthens the intestinal muscles and
makes them healthy and active. And day
by day it releases new stores of energy.

   Eat two or three cakes a day before meals:
on crackers—in fruit juices or milk—or just
plain. For constipation especially, dissolve one
cake in hot water (not scalding} night and morning.
15uy several cakes at a time—they will keep
fresh in a cool dry place for two or three days.
All grocers have Fleischmanu’s Yeast. Start eat-
ing it today!

   And let us send you a free copy of our latest
booklet on Yeast for Health. Health Research
Dept. Z-17, The Fleischmann Company, 701
Washington Street, New York.

There are many delicious ways of eating yeast
—dissolved in water, fruit juices or milk, spread
on crackers, or eaten plain.

  “In March, 1923, I had what I supposed was a nervous
  breakdown. I was restless and irritable. I had headaches
  and dizzy spells. I began to use Fleischmann’s Yeast. Grad-
  ually my ills disappeared—I became regular, and discon-
  tinued the use of cathartics. My energy returned—and in
  four or five months I was my former self. Not only have I
  regained rny health, but my color and my general appear-
  ance have been improved.”

            Mrs. Margaret Ade Sweeney, Roxbury, Mass.

  “I am a hostess at a hotel and not a day passes that someone
  doesn’t ask me how I manage to be up late at night and out in
  the sun every day and still keep my skin so clear and fair and
  my eyes so bright. My answer is Fleischmann’s Yeast. Years
  of intestinal indigestion had brought me to the point where I
  determined I’d stick at it until I got relief. Three cakes of yeast
  dissolved in water became a daily rite. In three months I had
  the results I wanted—relief from indigestion, gas and chronic
  constipation.” Mrs. Gertrude W. Hood, Mount Lowe, Calif.

Pyorrhea starts in the
gums—not the teeth

   That’s one outstanding fact
   everybody should know. And
   if everybody did know it, the
   number of Pyorrhea’s victims
   would be greatly reduced.

   Once Pyorrhea secures a firm
   hold, pus pockets form, gums
   become weak and flabby, the
   teeth loosen and fall out no
   matter how white and sound
   they may be.

   Forhan's For the Gums con-
   tains just the right proportion
   of Forhan’s Astringent, as
   used by the dental profession
   in the treatment of Pyorrhea.

   It protects and preserves the
   gums, and keeps them in a firm,
   pink, healthy condition. If you
   don’t care to discontinue the
   tooth paste you are now us-
   ing, at least brush your teeth
   and gums once a day with
   Forhan’s. All druggists; 35c
   and 60c in tubes.

FOR THE GUMS,

More than a tooth paste
—it checks Pyorrhea

4 out of 5

Dental statistics show
that four out of every
five over 40—and thou-
sands younger, too—are
victims of dreaded Pyor-
rhea. Will you escape?

The pick of America’s Wheat—contains 25%
Natural Bran, with essential Vitamines and
Mineral Salts.

3* A new and delicious Flavor brought out by
    pre-cooking.

THE big package of New Petti-
john’s is one of the best out and
out values on your grocer’s shelves.

  But the thoughtful wife and mother
doesn’t buy it just for that reason alone.
She thinks of what is in the package.

  Whole wheat — with 25 per cent
Natural Wheat Bran. So delicious that
the family never seems to tire of it—
and everybody gets the bran that is so
good for them, and likes it.

  Mineral Salts and Vitamines — so
necessary to health and growth.

  Convenience—the New Pettijohn’s

cooks through and through in 3 to 5
minutes.

  The New Pettijohn’s is selected whole
wheat, pre-cooked, processed to develop
the flavor, rolled and delicately toasted.

  A hot, fresh cereal that makes a gen-
erous, grateful breakfast—oftentimes a
welcome change for luncheon — and a
nourishing supper for growing children.

  Eat the New Pettijohn’s with good
top-milk or cream. The flavor is some-
thing to be grateful for.

    WE WANT half a million SHORT STORIES

    readers to become acquainted with The
    FRONTIER, the strikingly original magazine which
    in the space of only 8 months has pushed its way to
    the very forefront. We want you to become ac-
    quainted with The FRONTIER at our own expense,
    too. The FRONTIER blazes a new trail; it’s dif'
    ferent—fascinating in a new way. In addition to
    book length novels, long novelettes, and short stories,
    all complete in every number, it contains story-
    articles, a decidedly original feature. The contrib-
    utors in every case are the foremost fiction writers
    in America. And then there is the “Trading Post”
    where story tellers, adventurers, frontiersmen, and
    readers may meet and swap experiences and answer
    each other’s questions.

What they think of
The Frontier—■

“The Frontier is fine. However,
you made one mistake by making it
monthly instead of twice a month.
Who can wait a whole month for
such a magazine?”—W. E. Stock,
Dayton, Ohio.

“It is a veritable worldVend peri'
odical. Naturally it would be full
of adventure—full of adventure it
is. From cover page to cover page
there are cowboys and gold miners
and sheep herders, history, and what
not, but the theme is the same al-
ways—the frontier!” — Nashville
(Tenn.) Banner.

“I am enclosing check for a year’s
charter subscription to The Frontier,
a single copy of which has convinced
me that the magazine is a gem of the
first water set in 18 karat stuff.”—
Les Merrin, Butler, Ohio.

“I had intended to skim through it
as is my custom with sample copies
of magazines, but no sooner had I
started skimming than 1 laid aside
four novels I was reading and pro-
ceeded to devote myself to a full
hour of genuine entertainment.”—
Colorado Springs Gazette.

When that

Corn is gone

A corn isn’t just a pain—it’s a
drain. A tax on the whole nervous
system. A blight, not alone on the
toe, but on the spirits and the dis-
position. . . . Doctors know that a
com can darken a man’s whole view-
point on life. Headache, fatigue, ir-
ritability, and indigestion are often
reflexes of a throbbing corn . . .
“Pain-messages shoot to every
nerve center, when a com starts

broadcasting ... If you would know
blissful relief, apply Blue-jay to
that burning corn. In ten seconds,
the world will seem a better place to
live in .... A tiny cushion—cool
as velvet—fits over the com and
stops the pain at once. You wear it
two days in solid comfort. When
you take it off, the corn comes with
it—gently removed by the little
brown disc of magic medication.

on the back

The professional photographer makes his negatives under
the softly modulated light in his studio. He requires for his
finished prints a paper of a certain quality to fit his negatives.

  The amateur photographer makes his negatives under ex-
actly opposite conditions—in the contrasty glare of outdoor
sunshine. His negatives require for the best results a paper
of a very different quality.

  Velox is the only paper made for the sole purpose of fit-
ting the requirements of the amateur negative. And it does
fit them more perfectly than any other paper.

  Careful finishers use Velox exclusively because it is exclu-
sively made for careful finishers.

  Look for “Velox” on the back.
