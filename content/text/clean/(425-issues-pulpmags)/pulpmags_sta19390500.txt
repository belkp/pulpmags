TROPIC DOWNPOUR BRINGS ADVENTURE TO ROUTINE Pll©H»

Oien v. Andrew

    "I had flown four friends over
 to Lihue, on the island of Kauai,
 for a weekend of camping on the
 beach,” writes Olen V. Andrew,
 P. O. Box 3295, Honolulu, T. H.

.we ran into a driving
rainstorm. I couldn’t fly over it,

I didn’t have proper instru-
ments for flying through it, so
the only thing to do was to get down
low and keep visual contact with the water. But
it kept getting darker, the rain fell harder and
harder, till we couldn’t see the water below us.

I handed my big 'Eveready* five-cell flashlight to
the fellow in the co-pilot’s seat, told him to hold
it out the window and flash it below...

@ .. and there was the sea, only four feet be*
low us! Those long Pacific rollers were almost lapping at the wheels! My heart
skipped a beat to think how I had brought five people within inches of their
doom! Certainly it was the power of those 'Eveready' fresh dated batteries
th3t saved us all, and that kept us safe above the sea for the next half hour till
the storm lifted. You can take it from me, ^igmS)	/? ”

I don’t fly without ’em.	V	-

THOUSANDS NOW PLAY WHO
NEVER THOUGHT THEY COULD

Read this typical letter
from one of our students

 \/ES. just like thousands of others who thought
 1 music was hard, this man srot the surprise of iis
 life when he tried this easy way to learn music at
 home. And no wonder! Instead of months of tedious
 study and practice, he found himself actually playing
 real tunes in the very first few weeks! He didn't be-
 lieve it was possible—and his friends could hardly
 believe their cars when they heard him.

  But read this unsolicited letter for yourself. He writes:
  "I ordered your piano course junt to have somethin!?
  to do to pass the time evenings when I was home. I
  didn't even dream that I eouid actually learn to
  play without a teacher, because I had always heard
  that it couldn't be done. I couldn’t afford a teacher,
  so I didn't think it would do me any harm to take
  your course.

  "When 1 received the lessons I took the instantaneous

  rote fin*!er and etruck the noto6 right off. I con-
  sidered this just killing time, but you can imagine
  my surprise when after three or four weeks I found
  that I could actually play real tunes, something 1
  would never have believed possible without previous
  knowledge of music.

  "Now, when I play for people they will hardly believe
  that I learned to play so well with just a correspond-
  ence course in so short a time.

  "I am getting now to the point where even the hard-
  est music holds no terrors for me. Any person who
  takes your piano course and studies it cannot help
  but learn to play, because it covers everything they
  could ever want to know on the subject."

of a man
who threw
away an
opportunity by
which his brother
tripled his income

WANT you to know why I am starting to

I study accounting under your training. I
nm a married man, with two children* and
a wife in poor health. For seven years I have
held my job as a shipping clerk for a bakery—
without a raise the past six years.

  "My brother started to work at about the
eame time I did, and took your training in
Higher Accountancy. He has never been out of
work, and has progressed steadily until he is
now Chief Accountant and Office Manager for
an automobile company here, and is making
three times as much as I am.

  “I know I was a sucker for not starting when
he did. But I was skeptical, and the training
cost, even though small, looked like a lot of

This Atom-* Earth

   A Guest Editorial
   By RAY CUMMINGS

                FAMOUS SCIENTIFICTION AUTHOR

HAVE you ever seen a man strutting
with his own importance? One of those
fellows bursting with the consciousness of
his tremendous knowledge? You gaze at
him, perhaps with amusement. He reminds
you of Oliver Goldsmith’s lines:

"And still they gazed; And still Uielr wonder

    grew

That one small head could carry
    all he knew."

  Perhaps, if you come to think
of it, we’re all a little like that.

“To each man’s consciousness,
himself is the center of the
Universe." That’s a natural
human feeling. And this Earth
of ours is quite a big place. It
has lots of acres of land, and
quite a few leagues of ocean.

Justifiably we’re proud of the
wonders we put here on Earth:
we gaze around and we’re mon-
arch of all we survey.

  But it’s nothing to get puffed up about.
Pseudo-scientific fiction demonstrates that
to us very clearly. Now I think that the
last thing in the world that pseudo-scientific
fiction is designed to do is to point a moral.
Yet from it one may glean many great moral
truths. If by any chance, you are a fellow
wondering how one small head can carry
all you know, give a thought to a fish.

  Doubtless, to a fish’s consciousness, "him-
self is the center of the Universe.” There is
a little gray blur of water which he thinks
is about all of everything that exists. Unless
he jumps momentarily out and sees a few
trees on the bank of the stream. Or if he

Ray Cummings

swallows a fish-hook, which hurts and puz-
zles him—until death relieves him of the
puzzlement.

  It seems to me that we’re all very much
like that. Our telescopes show us spiral
nebulae, maybe a trillion light-years away;
and we pat ourselves on the back because
we can see so much. But isn’t that like the
fish who saw the trees? Isn’t
it more probable—as pseudo-
scientific fiction depicts—that
our Earth, the Solar System,
all the stars and remote ne-
bulae—that all of it is just a
group of tiny whirling elec-
trons within the atom of some
gigantic world? A Being on
that other world might be
walking on a beach. That beach
would have a lot of grains of
sand—and just one grain would
have a trillion-trilUqn atoms,
just one atom of which would
hold the £iant distances of all
our celestial Universe!

  That Being, balancing that grain of sand
on the end of his thumb, if you could imag-
ine that he would bother to think of us at
all, certainly would indeed wonder what we
had to be puffed up about!

  That's just one of the things that all we
followers of pseudo-science fiction realize
fully, of course. It’s all very simple, to us.
As a matter of fact, because we read, avidly
and understanding^, this greatest of all
types of fiction, we are in truth just a little
above other mortals in the intelligent under-
standing of many, many things. We all know
that, of course.

  And come to think of it, that’s something
to get puffed up about.

Ancestral Voices

PHILIP CRAIN had no pre-
monition on this October Sun-
day evening of the strange
chance that was about to hurl him into
unparalleled adventure. He had
called at the apartment of Dr. John
Martin, simply because the geologist
and his daughter were the only friends
the lonely young engineer had made
since he had come to New York.

   Crain had been lonely all his life.
 That was partly due to the odd mys-
 tery that had always clung about him,
 the strange something in his brain that
 had set him apart from other men.
 And partly, he knew, it was due to the

Space to Steal the Oceans of Earth!

alien quality of his physical appear-
ance.

  His tall, rangy figure, and his lean,
dark face were not unusual. But his
eyes were of a deep blue-black shade
that most people found disturbingly
strange, and his hair was of that same
queer blue-black.

  As he sat now beside Dr. Martin,
watching Kay Martin and Scott Ful-
ton, red-headed young airplane pilot,
dancing to the radio music, Crain was
wishing wistfully that he could join
in their youthful gayety.

  The music from the radio suddenly
died, and was replaced by an announc-
er’s excited voice. “We interrupt our
program for a special news bulletin,
ladies and gentlemen.”

  “What’s happened now?” wondered
John Martin.

  “Perhaps it’s another European cri-
sis,” Crain suggested.

  “Darn it, we just got that orches-
tra a minute ago,” Kay Martin was
complaining, disappointment on her
vivid, pretty face.

  “But it may be important news,” her
father said. “Listen—”

 The announcer’s voice was now
rushing excitedly from the radio.

  “—and so it appears that the meteor
that fell tonight is not a meteor at
all, but some kind of projectile. A
ship from space? It seems impossi-
ble, but it may be true. We will con-
tinue to bring you news bulletins on
it at frequent intervals.”

  Kay looked startled. “A ship from
space? Do you suppose—”

  “It’s probably some kind of hoax,”
said John Martin, his massive face
thoughtful. “There’s not much like-
lihood of . . . Why, Philip, what’s
the matter?”

  Philip Crain was utterly rigid, his
dark eyes dilated and fixed in a hyp-
notized stare upon the radio. He sud-
denly realized that, and relaxed, with
a shaky sigh. His whole body was
trembling.

  “Philip, what’s wrong?” Kay ex-
claimed.

  “I—I don’t know,” he said, bewil-
dered. “When I heard that announce-
ment, it was as though I started to
remember something—something I’ve
been trying to remember all my life.”

THEY stared at him, puzzled. And
Crain flushed, but every fiber of
his brain was throbbing with queer
excitement. That radio announce-
ment—it had somehow stirred to
quickened life the shadows in his
mind that had haunted him since boy-
hood. As Crain fought to appear calm,
the announcer’s voice came again in
an excited shout.

  “The projectile’s end is opening—
creatures coming out! Creatures from
space! They’re using strange weap-
ons—they’re invading Earth—”

  A wild, ringing shout burst from
Philip Crain’s lips! A bull roar ut-
terly unlike his usual diffident voice.

  His blue-black eyes were blazing,
and his white face was the hard harsh
face of a stranger. His whole body
was quivering, his fists clenched.

  “Philip!” cried Kay, terrified.

  Her scream broke the spell. The
blazing madness fled from his dis-
tended eyes. And he stood, shaking,
his brow damp with sweat, his eyes
wild.

  Frantic anxiety was on Kay’s face,
as she clutched his arm. Scott Ful-
ton was staring at him, startled, and
John Martin was rising. Astonish-
ment was on the geologist’s face.

  The radio announcer’s voice sud-
denly shattered the scene to common-
placeness.

  “You have been listening to our
regular Sunday evening play—”

  “A play! I knew it!” Scott Fulton
exclaimed. “I’ll bet it caused panic
in lots of places.”

  “Philip, what on earth made you
shout like that?” Kay cried. “That
bellowing voice, and the way you
glared and shook your fist! You
looked like a different man.”

  Crain’s eyes stared hauntedly at
them, out of depths of pure misery.

  “I don’t know what made me do it,
Kay,” he whispered. “Unless—” the
dull, aching misery in his white face
was raw, quivering, as he met their
gaze. “I’ve been afraid, all my life,”
he muttered dully, “that there’s some-
thing wrong with me, mentally. Now
this—”

  “Nonsense!” declared John Martin
forcefully. “You just let yourself get
too excited by this fake radio an-
THE PRISONER OF MARS

17

nouncement, Philip, and lost your
head for a moment. That’s all.”

  "It didn’t make you people lose your
heads,” Crain reminded heavily. “But
I—I’ve always feared that I inherited
a queer mental taint.”

  “You mean.” said the geologist, sur-
prised, "that your parents were not
normal ?”

a son—myself. And he never remem-
bered anything about his past. He
died five years ago—without remem-
bering.”

  A sick agony was in Philip Crain’s
voice as he concluded.

  “So many times I’ve seen my father
sitting, staring, trying to remember.
And he couldn’t! It was a shadow

  "My father wasn’t,” Crain answered
dully. “People thought him a little
crazy. You see, he didn’t know who
he was.”

  Crain's haunted eyes looked brood-
ingly into the past. He spoke in a
slow, heavy voice.

HIRTY years ago, some hunt-
ers up in the Canadian wilder-
ness south of Hudson Bay found a
crazed man wandering in the wilds.
A giant of a man, naked, exhausted,
starved, and near death from a bad
wound on his head. He knew noth-
ing, remembered nothing—not even
his own name, not even a word of any
language. His mind was an utter
blank.

  "They took him to the nearest trad-
ing post, and the priest there cared
for him, taught him how to speak Eng-
lish, and give him the name of John
Crain. In time, John Crain came to
the United States, married, and had

on his life. And it’s been a shadow on
my life, too. For I’ve feared that I
have inherited Father’s—queerness.
I've always felt somehow that there
were important things that I ought to
remember, and yet couldn’t. Some-
times when something has excited me,
as this radio hoax did tonight, I’ve
seemed on the very verge of remem-
bering. I can’t get those shadowy
things out of my mind!”

 Crain's deep eyes were almost
pleading as he looked up at them.

  “Do you think it’s because I’m—
queer, mentally?” he whispered. “I’d
rather be dead than that.”

  “Philip, no!” Kay cried. “You’ve
just brooded too long about your fa-
ther!”

  “Kay’s right,” declared John Mar-
tin. “Philip, you should have told us
about this long ago. We’d have made
you see what nonsense it is.”

  “There is not a chance in the world
that your father was mentally defec-
18

STARTLING STORIES

tive, Philip,” John Martin said em-
phatically. “Amnesia, generally a re-
sult of shock, mu9t have been what
happened to your father. But it is
not a form of insanity, and it could
not be passed down from father to
son.”

  “Then why is it,” Crain cried, “that
all my life I, too, have felt as though
there is something I can’t remember?”
“It’s all unconscious imitation on
your part—imitation of your father,”
Martin declared. “You saw him try-
ing to remember his past, and it made
you think you had something you
couldn’t remember.”

  “I wish I could believe you,” Crain
muttered, “but if I were really nor-
mal, why should I have lost my head
when that radio hoax startled me?”
“Philip, this obsession would leave
your mind if you knew who your fa-
ther really was,” John Martin de-
clared earnestly. “It’s just that old
mystery, preying on your mind, that's
unsettled it.”

  “But I don’t know,” Philip Crain
said hopelessly, “and there’s no way
of finding out.”

  “Did you ever go up there to Can-
ada where your father was found
and try to get a clue to his identity?”
the geologist asked.

  “No, but Father went up there,
twice, and he couldn’t find anyone up
there who had ever seen him or heard
of him, before he was found in the
forest.”

  “But you could comb the wilder-
ness country and remote posts better
than your father was able to, by air-
plane travel,” Martin persisted.

FOR the first time there was faint
hope on Crain’s white face.

  “Do you really think there's any
chance of learning something?” he
asked earnestly.

  “Of course I do!” John Martin de-
clared. “And what’s more, Kay and
I will go with you. We’ve been plan-
ning a northern vacation this fall, and
it will fit in fine.”

  “Dad, I was hoping you’d suggest
that J” exclaimed Kay, her brown eyes
shining.

  “Say, count me in on this party,”
put in Scott Fulton. “I’ve got a va-

cation coming, too, and we can all go
up there in my plane.”

   “Scott, that’s fine of you to do this
for us!” declared Kay happily.

  “For you?” repeated the grinning
pilot. “I’m thinking of the swell fish-
ing up there.”

  Black hopelessness swept back on
Philip Crain for a moment. It was all
so futile, to try solving a mystery
thirty years old. Yet if he only could
solve it—

  Those shadowy half-memories in
his brain made him suddenly strangely
eager for this quest to attain some-
thing he dimly felt had lain up in that
far northland for years. Something
mysterious and tremendous that was
waiting up there—waiting for him!

        CHAPTER II
        Mystery Wreck

ffO’ERE’S the place!” Scott Ful-
MM. ton called over the motor
roar. “Down there east of those river
forks.”

  The place where John Crain had
been found! Philip Crain gazed
tensely down.

  The vast forest of northern Que-
bec that lay below in the morning
sunlight stretched limitless as a
shaggy sea, a whispering, dark green
immensity of hemlock and pine. The
nearest trading post was two hours’
flight to the south. How had his fa-
ther come into this remote wilder-
ness, naked and wounded? From
where had he come?

   Crain felt hopelessly that this was
his slim last chance, this visit to the
remote wilderness spot where his fa-
ther had been found.

   “There may be some clue there,” the
geologist had insisted, but in his own
mind, Crain had felt that the mys-
tery would never be solved—the shad-
ow on him would never be lifted.

  His mind took him back to nights
when he had seen his father’s giant
figure standing dark and motionless
outside the house, staring yearningly
up at the glittering sky as though try-
ing to read in the heavens the secret
THE PRISONER OF MARS

19

of his identity. He remembered times
when John Crain, in the midst of work
or play, would suddenly stop and
stare in baffled wistful perplexity as
though he had been reminded of some
other life, some other existence. Re-
minded of—what?

 “Look, there’s something down
there!” Kay suddenly cried excitedly.
“There!”

  Crain saw it. His heart jumped. It
was a dull-gleaming, crumpled metal
bulk, lying at the bottom of a small
wooded ravine.

 “Some sort of crumpled metal
wreck!” Crain cried.

  “We’ll investigate, then,” declared
John Martin. “That ravine’s only a
dozen miles from where they found
your father. This may mean some-
thing.”

  Scott Fulton had already spotted a
tiny lake where he could land the am-
phibian. In ten minutes, they were
backtracking through the forest to-
ward the wreck.

  “Don’t build up too big hopes on
this, Philip,” advised the geologist.
“It may be nothing at all.”

  “I know,” answered Crain, yet his
dark eyes were vibrant with new hope.

  The giant pines and hemlocks had
choked out underbrush, and they
walked in the solemn cathedral shad-
ows of the huge trunks, upon a yield-
ing carpet of dead pine needles. The
air was chill with the nip of fall.

  But the narrow ravine was filled
with saplings and brush. Their
clothes were torn and they were out
of breath by the time they climbed
down into it and started forcing their
way along the bottom of the ravine.

  In five minutes, Scott Fulton yelled.

  “There it is ahead!”

  A dull-gleaming, crumpled silvery
bulk was showing through the dense
brush and saplings.

  Philip Crain crashed forward, his
heart pounding with excitement. The
others were close on his heels. They
all stopped short as they reached the
metal bulk.

 “What a crack-up!” Fulton ex-
claimed.

  “It’s no airplane, as I supposed,”
John Martin said, his brows knitted.
"But what is it?”

CRAIN’S eyes were brilliant as he
stared at the wreck—for now the
shadowy half-memories in his brain
were stirring and seething wildly.
This atrange-looking wreck seemed
somehow familiar to him.

  It had been, he saw, a cylindrical
metal craft, twenty-five feet in diam-
eter, and sixty feet long. But the
whole front half of it had been
smashed by terrific impact. The rear
part of the silvery ship was more in-
tact.

  “This things has been here for
years,” John Martin declared. “See
how the saplings have grown up
through the wreckage in that front
part.”

  “It looks to me like one of the freak
airships they used to build, back in
the early days of flying,” Scott Fulton
affirmed. “Plenty of weird ones were
tried, then.”

  “That would date this at thirty
years or so ago, if you’re right,” Mar-
tin said thoughtfully.

  “And it was thirty years ago that my
father was found wandering near
here!” Philip Crain cried excitedly.

  The geologist nodded. “If your fa-
ther was in this thing when it crashed,
that accounts for the wound on his
head, the shock that snapped his mem-
ory.”

  “Then maybe we can find in this
wreck some clue to who my father
was!” Crain cried eagerly.

  He was already moving excitedly
around the wreck, trying to find en-
trance. In a moment, he found a door
in the undamaged rear of the craft. He
climbed in quickly.

  The others followed. They found
themselves in a corridor leading to-
ward the stern. It was littered with
pineneddles, dry leaves and dust that
the winds had blown in. It ended in
a wide metal door without knob or
key.

  “The whole darned ship is of solid
metal!” Fulton marveled. “No won-
der the blamed thing crashed.”

  “It’s an extremely light and strong
metal,” said John Martin, fingering
a fragment of it he had picked up.
“Whoever designed this ship must
have known a few things.”

  Crain paid no attention. He was
20

STARTLING STORIES

reaching up and pressing a plate
above the closed door. The door slid
open.

  “How did you know that was the
way to open it, Philip?” Kay asked in
astonishment.

  Crain stopped, queerly chilled by
realization. How had he known?

  “I don’t know,” he said bewildered-
ly. “I just seemed to remember—"

  Scott Fulton was staring beyond
the open door. He uttered an excla-
mation.

  “What the devil is this thing?”

  The whole rear of the ship had been
a single metal chamber. It had ap-
parently been designed to hold, in a
shock-absorbing framework of heavy
girders, a large machine.

  It was a mechanism of grotesque un-
familiarity. Its most striking feature
was a disk-shaped platform of thick,
milky crystal, ten feet in diameter,
and standing on foot-high insulators.
Underneath the crystal disk was a web
of wires connected to the apparatus
which was grouped around it.

SIX objects like big beehives,
wound with silvery wires 3nd
each topped by a crystal ball, were set
at equidistant positions around the
crystalline platform. At one point
on the edge of the platform rose a
metal switchboard, bearing a row of

eight turn-switches, a bright red but-
ton, and a cluster of small glass bulbs.

  Directly above this switchboard
hung a large black metal cone, hol-
low, its base pointing downward to-
ward the disk of crystal.

  “What is it?” Kay exclaimed.

  “I’ve no idea.” her father answered,
frowning. “I’ve never seen an appa-
ratus or machine like this.”

  Philip Crain did not hear them. He
was staring at the mechanism with his
blue-black eyes wide, brilliant with
excitement. This machine—he vague-
ly remembered it!

  He had no memory of what its pur-
pose was. But something seemed to
tell him that the mechanism was of
vast importance, something upon
which colossal things depended, and
with which he was connected.

  "Let’s get it out of here into the
open, and try to find out how it’s op-
erated,” he cried. “If we can find out
the nature of this apparatus, that will
inform us as to the purpose of this
old airship expedition. We can then
try to find out where such an expedi-
tion started from, thirty years ago, and
who was in it.”

  John Martin's massive face was
doubtful. “But can we get the thing
out. Philip?” he demurred.

  “Those doors are all wide.” Crain
pointed out. "Obviously they were
made so, to facilitate getting this ma-
chine in and out. With a little effort,
we can get it out.”

  Seeing the eagerness in Crain's face,
John Martin assented.

  “Very well, we’ll do it. Kay, you
might look around for papers or any-
thing like that.”

  There began a period of arduous
toil. They cut saplings, trimmed
them, and used them for skids and
levers with which to force the heavy,
squat mechanism out of the wreck.
By the time they finally had it out,
and resting in a little grassy clear-
ing, it was late afternoon.

  Scott Fulton grunted with relief.
“Glad that’s over. Now I’m going to
give the wreck itself the once-over,
while you fiddle with this do-funny.”
Kay, with a troubled glance at
Philip Crain, accompanied the pilot.
When they returned, an hour later,
THE PRISONER OF MARS

21

Crain was still fascinated with his ex-
amination of every detail of the queer
machine.

  “I can’t understand the design of
that craft,” Fulton told them, puzzled.
“There are big tubes running the
whole length, that might have been ex-
haust tubes or rocket tubes. But who
ever heard of rocket experiments,
thirty years ago?”

  John Martin shook his head, frown-
ing. “Everything about this wreck is
queer. I wish I understood it.”

  “Have you found out what this ma-
chine is for, and how it works?” Ful-
ton asked.

  Philip Crain turned his excited face
up to them. “No, we haven’t yet. The
thing is a complete mystery. But we
did find out something.”

HE rose and stepped upon the
crystal disk, and pointed to the
red button on the switchboard.

  “See? There’s a tiny silver hand on
the board, pointing to that button.
Put there, I believe, as a reminder that
the button was to be pushed first when
the machine was put into operation.
We’re going to try it out.”

  “I don’t like this thing,” Kay said
suddenly, her brown eyes solemn and
distrustful. “It looks so—alien.”

  But Crain had already eagerly
jabbed the red button inward. It
caught, with a click.

  Two little red lights flashed alive
on the switchboard. And a slow
humming came from the beehive ap-
paratus around the desk.

  Martin and Philip Crain stared
amazedly at the humming beehive
things.

  “Where’s it drawing power from?”
the geologist muttered in astonish-
ment. “It must have some self-con-
tained source of power, yet there’s
nothing in it that looks like a bat-
tery.”

  The apparatus hummed on. But
there was no other change. Crain’s
face showed his deep disappointment.

  “There must be some purpose to
the thing!” he exclaimed.

  The shadowy half-memories in his
mind were loud, strong, as he stared
at the machine. They seemed whis-
pering, pleading. Begging him to do

something with this mechanism, some-
thing for which it had been designed,
something vitally important.

  “If the thing is purposeless,” he at
last said slowly, “then we can’t—”

  It happened, at that moment. An
overwhelmingly unexpected thing
that smote his lips to silence.

  A voice shouted from the hollow
cone above the switchboard. A shrill,
emotion-laden voice, choking with ex-
citement, rising to a scream.

  “Tharkol!” called that shrill voice
wildly. “Tharkol ryaa rire!”

  They stared at each other, faces
white in the dusk. From the cone, the
trembling, shrill voice called on.
"Tharkol! Tharkol!’'

  Shrill, quavering voice of an old
man, calling as though from far
away, with wild, superhuman emo-
tion!

CHAPTER III
Voice from the Void

JOHN MARTIN was the first to
speak.

  “This thing embodies a radio of
some sort,” he declared. “But who is
calling us? That wasn’t any language
I ever heard of, and I know many.”
STARTLING STORIES

  “Tharkol is a name!” Crain ex-
claimed. “I seem to have heard it, and
that language, before.”

  Crain’s tall figure was quivering,
his black eyes brilliant. That voice,
that strange language, he had almost
understood them! And the name
Tharkol had for an instant plucked
with strong fingers at a fiber of his
brain.

  Again the excited, emotion-charged
voice shrilled from the cone.

 “Tharkol! Su Dandor! Dandor!"

  “Dandor must be his name!” Philip
Crain cried. “He's expecting an an-
swer.”

  With swift impulse, Crain stepped
forward and shouted loudly up into
the hollow cone.

  “Philip Crain speaking! Who are
you? Where are you calling from?”

  Silence then. There was no an-
swer, as the minutes went by.

  “The thing must not be able to
transmit,” Fulton muttered finally.
“Your call didn't get through.”

  Abruptly contradicting him, *he
aged voice came shrilling from the
cone. It was puzzled now, still quiv-
ering with frantic excitement.

 “Krayn?” it repeated. “FeeJip
Krayn?”

  “He doesn’t understand English!”
exclaimed Crain. “I’ll try other lan-
guages.”

  “Philip Crain speaking!” he called

again. And repeated it in Spanish and
French. John Martin added transla-
tions in five other languages.

  They waited. Again there was a
long silence of minutes before the an-
swer came from the cone.

  "Krayn?” repeated the aged voice,
more puzzled now. “Quir Tharkol?
Su Dandor!”

  “He didn't understand any language
we used!” Crain cried. "That’s unbe-
lievable.”

  “There’s something a lot more un-
believable about this,” John Martin
said, pale and stunned. “Have you no-
ticed how long it has taken each time
for our message to reach this Dandor,
whoever he is, and for his to get back?
More than ten minutes, each way!”

  “So what?” Fulton said, uncompre-
hending.

  But Philip Crain understood. And
he stared frozenly at the geologist.

  “That— It’s impossible!” he ex-
claimed.

  “What’s impossible?” Kay asked
anxiously.

  Her father explained. “Radio sig-
nals travel with the speed of light—a
hundred and eighty thousand miles a
second. Yet they take more than ten
minutes to reach this Dandor, and
more than ten minutes to come back
from him. He must be more than a
hundred million miles from us!”

  “A hundred million miles?” re-
peated Scott Fulton incredulously.
“Why, there’s no place—” He stopped,
his jaw dropping. A look of awe came
into his face. “You mean—another
planet? Another world?”

  “The planet Mars is more than a
hundred million miles from Earth
right now,” John Martin said a little
thickly.

 “Mars?” cried Kay. “Dad, you
can’t mean—”

STRICKEN to silence, their eyes
turned up toward the heavens in
which the glittering hosts of the stars
shone calmly bright. And Philip
Crain felt wild tumult inside his
breast. As though, after all these
years, dim certainty was crystalizing
in him.

  “Yes, Mars,” he whispered. “That
voice is from there. I know it!”
THE PRISONER OF MARS

  “But this machine, this radio or
whatever it is, couldn’t have come
from there!” Scott Fulton objected
incredulously. “How could it come to
Earth?”

  “You said the wrecked airship has
rocket tubes?” muttered John Martin.

  “You mean it’s a rocket ship that
came here thirty years ago, from
Mars?” Fulton exclaimed.

  Kay Martin was gazing at Crain’s
brilliant eyes and transfigured face.

  “Philip,” she whispered, “if your
father was really in that ship, if it was
the wreck of its landing that wounded
him and caused his amnesia, then he
came from—”

 “Good God!” John Martin was
shaken as he stared at Crain. “Your
father couldn’t have come from there,
Philip!”

  “I don’t know,” Crain said in a
heavy whisper. “But that radio hoax
about space ships landing—why did
that excite me so? Why did it al-
most make me remember — some-
thing?”

  “Oh, this is all crazy!” Scott Ful-
ton’s voice was a little raw. “The idea
that your father could have come from
that world out there!”

  “Listen!” Crain said suddenly.

  The voice, the shrill, aged voice of
Dandor, was coming again from the
cone above their heads.

  “Krayn! Feel ip Krayn!”

  Calling to them, across unthinkable
gulfs of space, from far out in the
starry heavens?

  “Su Dandor!” it called. “Quir Thar-
kol?”

  Then began a period unreal as a
dream, a time in which, for hour after
hour, Philip Crain called back and
forth to that aged voice of the entity
that called itself Dandor. Strange,
baffled attempts at understanding each
other. And a strange feeling in
Crain that he could almost understand
Dandor’s speech. He felt nothing but
the feverish urge to understand that
shrill voice with its terrific appeal to
him to understand!

  “Listen!” Crain ordered excitedly.

  Dandor was sending bell notes
through to them now; clear, liquid
tones. One after another until eight
of them had sounded.

  And then Dandor’s voice, calling
loudly: A hi! Nan! Zor! Xel! Kuru!
Wee! Fin! Oro!”

   Again the eight bell notes, and then
the eight strange monsyllables.

  “The numbers, from one to eight, in
his language,” muttered John Martin.
“That’s clear enough—but why?”
“The eight switches on the control-
board of this machine!” cried Crain
suddenly. “That’s what he’s trying to
tell us about!”

  “Zor!” Dandor called urgently from
the cone. “Zor, Feelip Krayn—Zor!”
“Three—the third switch!” Crain
shouted. “He’s telling us in what or-
der to turn on these switches, so as to
put this machine into operation!”

HIS hand flew toward the third
switch. But John Martin
grasped him and dragged him back.

   “We can’t go into this thing blindly,
Philip,” he protested. “We still don’t
know this machine’s purpose.”

  Crain’s eyes were blazing with ex-
citement. “But that old man — he’s
pleading with us—has some great pur-
pose, that we don’t understand!”
“Philip,” Martin declared. “We
mustn’t go ahead with this until we
have learned Dandor’s language, know
where he is, and what he wants.”
Philip Crain hesitated. He recog-
nized the force of the geologist’s argu-
24

STARTLING STORIES

ment. Yet he was torn by that plead-
ing, shrill, old voice, and the urge
from the depths of his mind to obey.

   “We’ll wait, then, a little while,” he
finally said reluctantly. “Until we un-
derstand.”

  “Zor, Krayn — Zor!” called the
shrill, tense voice from the cone.

  Crain’s eyes clung to that third
switch. What would happen if he
closed it?

  “Let’s leave this until tomorrow,"
John Martin was saying earnestly.
“We all need sleep, rest. Tomorrow,
we’ll start trying to fathom this mys-
tery.”

  Crain stepped off the crystal disk
and followed the others to the tents.
But he kept looking back, torn by the
strong impulse to return.

  They talked little before they re-
tired. All were too stunned by the
tremendous possibilities opened up.
And there was constraint in the way
they looked at Crain: as though he had
suddenly become alien. His own
thoughts were whirling. Incredible
vistas had opened before him. And
the shadowy memories in his brain
were clamoring!

  Lying on his cot, a little later,
Philip Crain heard the heavy breath-
ing of Fulton and the geologist as
they slept. But he lay looking up
through the open tent-flap at the
starry heavens, at the red spark of
Mars that now was rising.

  That red speck twinkled like a fiery
eye, hypnotic, luring. Yes, calling to
him!

  He could lie like this no longer, in
his feverish condition of mind. He
rose, silently slipped on his boots, and
moved through the starlight toward
the wreck.

  In the thin starlight, the squat ma-
chine bulked darkly, the crystal disk
platform gleaming vaguely, the red
eyes on the switchboard still glowing.
He stepped up onto the disk, and he
heard Dandor’s voice still coming
from the cone.

  “Krayn! Zor—zor—zor—”

  The voice was exhausted, worn and
laden with deepest emotion; reduced
almost to a husky whisper. Swift sym-
pathy rushed through Crain as he real-
ized that for all this time the aged

Dandor must have been calling, plead-
ing.

  “I can’t do what you want,” Crain
spoke miserably into the cone, know-
ing he could not be understood. “They
won’t let me.”

  In minutes, the voice of Dandor
came back, louder, tremulously beg-
ging.

  "Zor, Krayn! Rop Tharkol — zor
rop Tharkol!"

THARKOL! Why did that name
set every nerve in Crain’s body
quivering? He could not understand,
he only knew that it made something
inside him wildly alive and eager. De-
cision rushed upon him. Whatever
came of it, whatever happened to him,
he must do what Dandor asked.

  “Zor, Dandor!” he cried into the
cone, with 3udden soaring exaltation
of spirit. "Zor!”

  And his hand, with a convulsive ef-
fort, turned the third switch.

  For an instant, nothing changed.
Then as Crain stood tense, he per-
ceived that deep inside the thick crys-
tal disk on which he stood, a pale blue
radiance was gathering. A shimmer-
ing, elfin light, that grew slowly until
he seemed standing on an opalescent
platform of pearly blue fire. And the
beehive transformers were humming
louder.

  Dandor’s voice came, wild with
frantic joy and relief.

  “Ni Xel, Krayn! Xel!”

  Four bell notes, repeated over and
over. And then the command again:

  “Xel!”

  Crain eagerly flung the fourth
switch shut. The beehive apparatus
hummed still louder. The opalescent
light inside the crystal seemed to
seethe and swirl, like coiling snakes
of blue luminescence. And Philip
Crain felt a strange, weird shuddering
through his whole body, as though
superhuman forces were streaming
through him!

  “A hi, Krayn—ahl!” cried Dandor’s
voice, quivering, unutterably tense. A
single bell note sounded. "Ahl!"

  Crain, shaken by that streaming
force that flooded him, reached toward
the first switch.

  “Philip, don’t!”
THE PRISONER OF MARS

  Kay's scream! She was running
toward the crystal disk now ablaze
with light. She leaped up onto it,
clutched his arm wildly. Her face was
frantic with fear, brown eyes dilated
by terror of the supernatural.

  “Kay, get back!” he cried, his face
strange, wild. “I’ve got to do this.
Something out there calling me!”

  “Father! Scott!” she called franti-
cally.

  Crain heard John Martin and Ful-
ton answer in startled voices, come
running. They mustn’t stop him, now!

  "Ahl!” Dandor’s voice was calling
in desperation. “Ahl!”

  Crain thrust Kay roughly off the
disk. Then he leaped to the switch-
board.

  His hand flung the first switch shut.
Even as he closed it, he heard a scream
and whirled to see that Kay had leaped
back up onto the shimmering disk.
And in the next heart-beat, the thing
happened.

  A terrific blaze of blue force ex-
ploded upward. Crain seemed to feel
every atom of his body inconceivably
wrenched and riven by that awful
force.

  He felt himself hurled into dark-
ness. He could not see or hear but
he had the weird sense of flying out
into space at a velocity inconceivable.
Rocketing out into the void as fast as
light itself!

  In that terrific moment, he was
aware of Kay, somewhere near him,
flying out like himself into unimagin-
able abysses. He sensed approach to
some vast body. Then he felt another
terrific wrenching shock. And then
darkness.

CHAPTER IV
Son of Mars

CRAIN opened his eyes. His brain
was so stupefied by unearthly
shock that for a moment he did not
appreciate the full startling nature of
his situation.

  He was lying upon a crystal disk,
and Kay lay unconscious beside him.
This disk was dull, dead, not blazing

with light. Crain thought at first that
he and Kay had only been stunned by
some strange force from the machine.

  “Krayn!” cried a shrill, astounded
voice. And that voice came from be-
side him!

  Crain looked dazedly up. An old
man, with a withered face was bend-
ing over him. His brow was high, his
hair scant and white with years. But
his eyes were wonderful — black,
large, expressive of immense intelli-
gence.

  This oldster wore a short white
silken tunic over which a long gray
silk cloak was flung. And he was
looking down into Philip Crain’s face
with an expression of stupefied amaze-
ment.

  “You—who are you?” Crain mut-
tered hoarsely.

  “Dandor!” cried the oldster eagerly,
touching his breast. “Su Dandor!”

  Dandor! The man who had called
to him across the void? Crain’s heart
jumped wildly. How had he come
to be here at Dandor’s side? Where
was he?

  He scrambled to his feet, momen-
tarily unheeding the unconscious girl.
His tall figure swayed, his dark eyes
dilated as he gazed wildly around
him.

  “This place,” he choked. “Where
am—”

  He was in a big round room whose
walls were of time-worn blocks of pale
red stone. It was lighted by a flaring
section of the ceiling, like an artificial
sun. The mechanism on which Crain
stood and Kay lay was at the center
of the room. Around the walls rose
machines of unfamiliar appearance.
Some seemed telescopic and spectro-
scopic apparatus, another looked much
like a dynamo, and still another was
oddly manlike, with huge silvery
metal body, arms and legs, and a bul-
bous head with two glittering lenses
like eyes.

  Crain’s dazed gaze fixed on an open
window. He stumbled toward it. His
body felt unusually light, weightless.
Cold wind hit his feverish brow as he
looked from the window—cold, pun-
gent dry air laden with fine sand
particles. His mind was reeling at
the strangeness of the scene outside.

1
26

STARTLING STORIES

  He looked out upon an alien world!
A vast, undulating plain of moonlit
sand, stretching to dim horizons.
Strange little flickers of light, like
ghostly will-o’-the-wisps, drifted
above the solemnly silent sands. Low
in the southern sky, in a canopy of
brilliant stars, hung two silvery
moons, one high and small, the other
a brilliant shield moving perceptibly
eastward!

  It was a vista of alien enchantment
and lonely beauty upon which he
looked from the topmost chamber of
an ancient, massive, round stone tow-
er. But most v'onderful of all, this
outlandish vista was vaguely familiar
to Philip Crain. He knew, suddenly,
where he was. Even though the
knowledge was incredible.

  “Mars!” he cried thickly. “My
God! Another world!”

HE swung wildly around. His
burning gaze probed Dandor.

  “How did I get here?” he cried
hoarsely. “You—whoever you are—
speak!”

  He stopped. His eyes had wandered
to the machine of the crystal disk, on
which Kay Martin lay, stirring.

  In an appalling flash of perception,
Philip Crain understood. That ma-
chine and the one like it in the
Canadian forest back on Earth, bridg-
ing the abyss between worlds—

  “Philip!”

  Kay was sitting up, her eyes brown
pools of terror. He stumbled to her
side and took her into his arms.

  “Philip, what’s happened to us?”
she cried.

  He tried to make his voice calm, to
fight down his own rising hysteria.

  “It’s unbelievable, Kay, but that
machine we found and experimented
with back on Earth has somehow pro-
jected us to this world. To Mars!”

  Her face went white. Her cry was
frantic. “Then we’ve got to get back
to Earth!”

  “Yes,” Crain said hoarsely. He
swung toward Dandor, and gripped
the old man’s thin shoulders frenzi-
edly.

  “You’ve got to send us back, under-
stand! Back to Earth—now!"

  There was a swift, ponderous clank

of metal from a corner of the room.
And Kay screamed wildly. The huge,
manlike machine was moving. A liv-
ing machine, a great robot that was
lunging straight toward Philip Crain.

  Crain let go his hold upon Dandor
with a cry of horror. But the robot’s
metal hands were already grasping
Crain, lifting him from his feet, to
dash him down on the floor.

  Raised aloft, Crain fought furi-
ously, but his wild blows only bruised
his fists upon the impervious metal
head and body.

  “Kto—leor!” cried Dandor franti-
cally.

  The robot, Kro, stiffened, holding
Philip Crain in mid-air. Dandor
shouted another sharp command and
Kro, in obedience, put Crain gently
down on the floor. But the robot still
stood watchful, unhuman lens eyes
watching every move Crain made.

  Crain was dizzy, trembling. He
realized that the robot had thought
he was attacking Dandor.

  Dandor spoke swiftly to the robot.
Crain heard the names “Lanu" and
“Ingomar” repeated several times.

  “Ni, rala,” said the robot finally in
a metallic voice that issued from the
orifice under its staring lenses.

  And the monstrous metal creature
stalked past Crain and Kay, opened
a door, and clanked down stone steps.

  Crain heard a humming drone,
somewhere in the base of the old stone
tower. Then, through the open win-
dow, he glimpsed something speeding
away across the moonlit desert. A
thing like a giant, silvery snake, mov-
ing with incredible speed. He real-
ized that it was a vehicle, that Kro, the
robot, had gone in it.

  Dandor, his withered face taut with
excitement, began to speak rapidly to
Crain. He pointed to objects, and per-
formed little actions, each time speak-
ing a word. He was, quite obviously,
endeavoring to teach Crain his own
language.

TO Philip Crain’s amazement, he
learned almost as rapidly as
Dandor taught him. Each word, each
name, that Dandor uttered, Crain felt
engraved at once on his mind. It was
as if he were learning a language he

“Look into my eyes" boomed the massive machine’s heavy voice (Chapter XIV)
28

STARTLING STORIES

once knew, but had forgotten.

  Kay clung to him, eyes in fasci-
nated fright on Dandor's face. Her
slender body was quivering.

  Hours must have passed. One of
the two moons had already swiftly
set. But now Crain was speaking
with Dandor, haltingly, stumblingly,
yet with more and more facility.

  “The matter-caster on Cholu —
there are others there by it, who can
operate it at our instructions?” was
Dandor’s first eager question.

  “You mean the machine back on
Earth?” Crain asked in bewilderment.
“Yes, there are others there.”

  “Good!” exclaimed the old scientist.
Triumph shone in his withered face
and glowing eyes. “Now at last the
gulf between Bara and Cholu, be-
tween this world and that, is
bridged!”

  “Philip, ask him to send us back to
our own world on that thing!” begged
Kay.

  But when Dandor understood, he
shook his head decisively.

  “Your bodies would not stand an-
other shock of transmission so soon,”
he told Crain, who interpreted to her.
“You must wait. But you can speak
to those others on Cholu.”

  The old man touched the red button
on the switchboard of the matter-
caster. A humming arose from it.
Dandor motioned for them to speak
into the cone above the switchboard.

“Father!” cried Kay frantically.
“Father, can you hear me? It’s Kay!”
Minutes of silence. Then, from the
voice-cone, came John Martin's voice,
choked with relief.

  “Kay! My God, where are you?
We thought you and Philip were an-
nihilated by the blazing force of the
machine. Where are you?”

  “On another world!”

  Her voice broke. Philip Crain
shouted explanation into the cone.
Martin’s voice was still more awed
when it came again.

  “This is incredible! Awful!”

  “Tell him,” Dandor said quickly,
“that he must remain at the matter-
caster, ready to turn it on when we
call him, and that he must not tell
others on Cholu of this.”

  Crain hoarsely conveyed the old

scientist’s instructions.

  “It’s our only chance to get back,
Martin,” he added. “For you to be
there, ready to turn the machine on
when we call you.”

  “All right, Philip, we’ll wait here,”
Martin grimly agreed. “But for
God’s sake bring Kay back safely!”

“I will!” Crain promised fervently.
Dandor shut off the voice-cone.
Then he laid a trembling hand on
Philip Crain’s shoulder, his eyes
shining.

  “All is well, and the gulf is
bridged!” he exclaimed. “And you,
Krayn, have finally succeeded in com-
pleting Tharkol’s great mission.”
“Tharkol?” The name rang again
through Philip Crain’s memory.
“Who is Tharkol?”

  “Tharkol was the great hero king
of our race,” Dandor answered fer-
vently. “The king who, thirty of
your years ago, attemped to throw a
bridge across the abyss between
worlds, by taking a matter-caster to
Cholu in a rocket ship. For ages, we
of Bara have dreamed of spanning the
gulf between this world and Cholu.
Finally we devised the matter-casters.
They make use of a secret long known
to us—a process by which living crea-
tures can be translated into clouds of
non-material photons, into electrical
energy, and can later be translated
back into solid matter, unharmed.”

THE old scientist saw the incre-
dulity in Philip Crain’s face, and
stopped to explain. He may have
thought Crain not yet had full com-
mand of this Baran language, but al-
ready memory had opened it up to
Philip Crain as though he had spoken
it all his life.

  “It is simple enough.” Dandor said.
"There are three fundamental kinds
of particles—the electron and the pro-
ton, which are particles oi matter, and
the photon, which is the particle of
radiation. The chief difference be-
tween them is that the electron and
proton possess an electric charge,
while the photon possesses an electric
field. Electrons and protons can be
made into photons, by changing their
electric charges to fields.

  “When that is done, the solid mat-
THE PRISONER OF MARS

29

ter which the electrons and protons
composed becomes a photon cloud, a
thing of pure immaterial energy. A
human being can be changed thus into
a cloud of photons, and the relation
between these photons will be the
same as that between that being’s
electrons formerly, and so that per-
son, even as a photon swarm, will re-
tain a shadowy kind of life and con-
sciousness. And the photon swarm
can easily be changed back into a solid
human being.

  "The matter-casters were designed
to take advantage of this secret. A
human being could step onto one, be
converted by a blast of force into an
immaterial photon cloud, and that
cloud could be projected along a tight
beam with the speed of light to an-
other matter-caster, where it would
again be solidified.

  “We knew if we could get a matter-
caster to Cholu, we would have an
open road from Bara to Cholu. We
would be able to flash from world to
world in moments, through the matter-
casters. But first, we had to get one
of the machines to Cholu, and of
course it would have to be taken there
physically, in some sort of rocket
ship.

  “Finally after many trials, we
scientists devised a ship that would
have a chance to reach Cholu. It
would be a suicidally risky attempt.
And our great King Tharkol chose to
lead that hazardous expedition whose
success would mean so much to Bara.
Tharkol set forth, thirty of your years
ago, with a small crew, on the heroic
attempt. He carried a complete
matter-caster in his ship.

  “All Bara waited tensely for word
that Tharkol had reached Cholu
safely. In this desert laboratory I,
Dandor, waited beside this other
matter-caster for Tharkol to speak to
me through the voice-cones and re-
port success. But no word came from
him. And as the months passed, all
Bara believed he had perished, and
all mourned our great king who had
died in the attempt to achieve this
thing for his race.

  “Only I, Dandor, never quite gave
up hope amid this general despair,
but kept watch here through the years,

hoping that some day Tharkol would
call me. And at last, today, my hope
was rewarded. For you called, Krayn
—and you turned on the matter-
caster on Cholu at my instructions,
and at last our age-old dream of a road
to Cholu is realized!”

DANDOR’S eyes flashed with al-
most superhuman happiness.

  "The road to Cholu, open at last!”
he repeated. “Now comes Bara’s
great hour of destiny! Now shall our
world bloom again and the pitiful
doomed ones be freed!”

  Philip Crain stared with wild sur-
mise in his eyes.

  “Then that wrecked ship we found
on Earth,” he said hoarsely, “is the
ship that Tharkol piloted there thirty
years ago, and wrecked in landing.
And on that ship—” He asked Dan-
dor tautly: “Have you any picture of
Tharkol?"

  Dandor nodded, and took from a
cabinet a small, curiously perfect
statuette.

  “This is a stereophot of Tharkol,”
he said.

  The statuette had obviously been
made by some process of three-dimen-
sional photography. It was the figure
of a giant man, dressed in Baran
costume of tunic and cloak, his great
head bare. And that powerful, leo-
nine face was unmistakable.

  “That,” Philip Crain choked, blood
roaring in his ears, "is John Crain.
My father!”

  “Yes,” Dandor agreed, his eyes
glowing. “I knew it, Krayn, the
moment I saw your face. You are
the son of Tharkol, our great hero
king.”

        CHAPTER V
        The Doubles

PHILIP CRAIN’S mind rocked at
the revelation. John Crain, his
father, a great Martian king!

  No wonder that John Crain had all
his life on E&rth been trying to re-
member a former life! No wonder that
the giant man had stared night after
30.

STARTLING STORIES

 night into the starry skies, dimly try-
 ing to remember that other world
 where he had been a great ruler!

  “Your father Tharkol?” Dandor
was asking tensely. "He is dead? He
must be, since he never called me.”
“He died but a few years ago,” Crain
told the old scientist. “And he never
called you, because he had no memory
of his life on this world.”

  He told Dandor the story of his
father’s amnesia, the mystery that had
clouded his life. And he saw tears
mist the old scientist’s eyes.

  “Tharkol, our great king, my friend,
dying far away on Cholu without
memory of his people and his world,”
whispered Dandor. “Living among
that alien people, while we mourned
him here as dead. And you, his son,
by a woman of Cholu! It is Fate’s
work that you, Tharkol’s son, should
at last have brought success to your
father’s heroic attempt.”

  "You said you knew I was Tharkol’s
son as soon as you saw my face!”
Crain said. “But I don’t look like him,
except for my hair and eyes. How
could you know?”

  “You will understand that when
you meet Lanu, your half-brother,
king of Bara,” Dandor replied.

  “My half-brother?” Philip Crain
cried.

  Dandor nodded. “Yes, when your
great father Tharkol left Bara on his
hazardous attempt, he left here his in-
fant son, Lanu. If Tharkol did not
return, Lanu was to be king, under my
regency, until he attained his ma-
jority. He is now the king of Bara.
I have sent Kro, my robot servant, to
Ingomar to bring Lanu here. I dared
not call by ordinary voice-cone, for
the message might have been heard by
Surp”

  “Surp?” Crain repeated, his bewil-
derment growing. “Who is he?”
Dandor’s face clouded. “Surp is a
powerful noble who has been intrigu-
ing against King Lanu, and has turned
the people against him. If Surp knew
the king was here in this lonely desert
tower, he might seize the chance to put
him out of the way. For Surp aspires
to the throne himself—the traitor!”

  “A Martian king—my half-brother!”
Philip Crain gasped, dazed. “And I—

half Martian! I can’t believe it! Yet
all my life I’ve had vague memories
of some other place, some other life.”

  “Aye, you would have,” Dandor
said. “For we Barans possess a cer-
tain faculty of hereditary memory,
passed down from father to son, the
synaptic pattern of the father’s brain
tending to reproduce itself in the
son’s brain. Had not your father’s
synaptic mental pattern been snapped
by shock, you would have inherited
complete remembrance of this world
from him.”

  “Half-Martian!” Philip Crain
breathed again.

  Kay’s face was white, her brown
eyes appealing as she looked up at
him.

  “Philip, this won't make any dif-
ference to you—this finding out about
your Martian blood?” she asked earn-
estly. “You’ll still want to go back to
Earth, with me?”

  “Yes, of course,” he said slowly.
“I’m still dazed. But I promised to
get you back safely."

DANDOR had gone to the window,

_ was peering worriedly into the
night.

  “Kro should have been back with
Lanu by now,” he muttered. “If Surp
has stopped them—” Then his eyes lit.
“Here they come now! See their
Worm, in the distance?”

  Crain peered across the rolling
ocher desert, dimmer now, for before
long the nearer moon would set. Still
a plain of enchantment, infinitely des-
olate, alive with those strange flicker-
ing will-o’-the-wisps that danced
drifting to and fro.

  Topping a ridge miles away, a great
snakelike metal thing gleamed in the
moonlight. The serpent-shaped ve-
hicle that Dandor called a Worm.
With immense speed it was rocketing
across the sands toward the old stone
tower.

  They heard it stop beneath, then
heard steps coming up the stone stairs.
The heavy, clanking tread of the ro-
bot, and the lighter step of a man.

  Philip Crain’s tall body tautened.
His half-brother, king of this other
world, was approaching!

  Lanu entered the room first. He was
THE PRISONER OF MARS

a tall young man, tall as Philip Crain.
His dress was a brilliant crimson cloak
over a white tunic. High strapped
sandals of soft leather were on his
feet, and his blue-black hair was bare.
At his belt hung a silver tube several
inches long.

  “Dandor!” he cried as he entered.
“Kro told me that the great plan has
finally succeeded!” His voice rang
exultant. “If it has, it means new life
for our dying world! And it means
the end of Surp and his traitorous
schemes!”

  Lanu was suddenly stricken silent
as he saw Philip Crain. His dark eyes
bulged as he looked on the Earthman’s
face. Philip Crain, too, was frozen
with the rigidity of utter stupefaction
as he looked at his royal half-brother.
And from Kay came an incredulous
cry.

  “Philip! It’s—you!"

  The face of Lanu, king of Bara, was
identical with the face of Philip
Crain!

  It was more arrogant and petulant
in expression, a little weaker in out-
line, but otherwise the mirror of
Crain’s face. The two half-brothers
were doubles.

  “What devil’s magic is this?” cried
Lanu, his hand darting to the weapon
at his belt. “This man—he’s me!"

 Dandor’s withered face wore a
smile. The old scientist looked at the
stupefied Crain.

  “Now you understand why I knew
you were Tharkol’s son, as soon as I
saw you,” he said.

 “My father’s son?” Lanu cried
amazedly. “You mean that his fel-
low is my brother?”

  “Your half-brother,” Dandor cor-
rected.

  Rapidly, the old scientist explained.

  And Philip Crain, during that ex-
planation, stood like a man amazed.
This Martian ruler, his half-brother,
and his double! It added the final
touch of incredibility to all that Crain
had experienced.

KAY was staring from one to the
other of the two men, as though
unable to believe her eyes. The one
in stained khaki Earth clothes; the
other in royal Martian garb. But

facially, physically, exact replicas of
each other.

  “A half-breed brother from Cholu,
eh?” Lanu muttered. Then he told
Crain suspiciously, “You understand
that I am the eldest—that I rule Bara
by right?”

  Philip Crain nodded, spoke with
difficulty.

  “I’ve no ambitions to rule Bara.”

  “We shall find some place for you
at the court,” Lanu continued patron-
izingly to Crain, “even though you
are only half of Baran blood. And
you’ll be useful to us in helping oper-
ate the Choluan end of the great
plan.”

  Crain did not understand the refer-
ence. But Lanu was continuing ex-
ultantly, his face lit with vengeful tri-
umph.

  “Now I will crush Surp and all his
schemes! The people will turn from
Surp back to me, when they hear that
I have succeeded in achieving the
great plan at last! That I am going
to bring water to Bara from Cholu!”

  '‘Water from Cholu—from Earth?”
Philip Crain cried incredulously. “Do
you mean that that is your great plan
—to take water from Earth for this
world?”

  “Aye, that is the great plan, Krayn,”
Dandor said. “The plan your father
risked hie life for.” He rushed on in
eager explanation. “This planet Bara
has long been a dying, drying world.
For ages, its hydrosphere has been
steadily deserting it. For it is a law
of Nature that small worlds, with their
lesser gravitation, cannot hold the
dancing molecules of their air and
water envelopes as well as can larger
worlds where the molecular velocity
of escape is higher.

  “Once, long ago, we Barans num-
bered hundreds of millions. We had
built great cities upon the shores of
our seas, had risen to a proud peak of
civilization. But we could not master
Nature. We could not halt the drying
of our world. Slowly, 6teadily, re-
morselessly, the seas shrank as our
water was dissipated into space.

  “The seas shrank to small lakes, and
then those dwindled. Deserts appeared
where had been fertile lands. And al-
ways the deserts spread, the fertile

lands diminished. Bara could not sup-
port all the numbers of our people.
Every year, many thousands of our
race had to be—disposed of, so that
the rest of the race could live.

  “We moved to cities near the
shrinking snows of the north and
south polar caps, our last water sup-
ply. Great underground aqueducts
were built to transmit that precious
water, without loss by evaporation, to
our cities. But the snow-caps have
steadily failed too, and now our pop-
ulation has been reduced to less than
a million people, and our scores of cit-
ies to five cities only.

  “But if water could be brought in
great quantities from another world,
it would revivify our dying planet. It
would make Bara green and fertile,
able once more to support a great race.
It would make possible the release of
the millions on millions of doomed
ones, who pray through the years to
live again.”

  The doomed ones? Philip Crain
could not understand. But before he
could ask, Dandor was speaking on.

       ONG ago, we Barans saw in the
jLA world Cholu a source of the
water we needed. We could perceive
that on Cholu were vast seas. Rutha,
the second planet from the Sun, we
knew to possess much water also, but
it was so admixed with certain chemi-
cal elements that, if brought to our
world, would set up a reaction that
would produce a poison that would
vitiate our whole planet. But Cholu
possessed pure water, and in more
than sufficient quantities to revive our
world.

  “That is the dream that we have
cherished for ages! To hurl trillions
of tons of water from Cholu, across
the void to Bara! It can be done. All
that is needed is to set up a great num-
ber of matter-casters along the oceans
of Cholu, and they will hurl ceaseless
streams of water, in the form of de-
materialized photon swarms, across
the gulf to this world.

  “That is why we have hoped to get
a matter-caster to Cholu. So that men
and materials could pour through—to
that other world, and build many mat-
ter-casters, and start the waters of
THE PRISONER OF MARS

33

that world streaming across space to
Bara. That is why your father Thar-
kol risked his life to take a matter-
caster to Cholu. He knew that it meant
salvation for this world!”

  Philip Crain’s lean face was a stiff
mask of conflicting emotions, as the
old scientist finished.

  “And you expect me to help you in
this plan?” he cried. “Why, it would
shrink Earth’s seas to ponds, would
condemn my own world to water star-
vation, would bring disaster on Earth
and my people!”

  “Your people?” exclaimed Dandor,
amazedly. “Those Choluans are not
your people, Krayn. Your people are
your father’s race, the Baran race,
whose royal blood flows in your
veins.”

  "But I’m still half Earthling!”
Philip Crain exclaimed. "And to cause
such a disaster to Earth—” He stop-
ped, his mind a seething chaos of be-
wilderment.

  This plan that would rob Earth of
water, to revivify dying Mars — he
couldn’t let that be carried out! The
green, smiling Earth made a desert, a
disaster-stricken world—no!

  Yet, even with that resolve firm in
his mind, Crain was strongly con-
scious of the Martian blood in his
veins. And his father had risked
death, for this plan If he, Philip
Crain, was loyal to Earth, as he meant
to be, he would be disloyal to his Mar-
tian blood.

  Lanu was watching him narrowly,
suspicion on his face.

  “I fear this half-brother of mine has
too much alien blood to be a true
Baran,” he said.

  “He will be a loyal son of Mars,”
Dandor assured the young king. “He
is stunned by all he has learned, now,
and no wonder. But be sure that no
son of Tharkol will ever prove enemy
to his father's people."

  He turned to Philip Crain and Kay.
“You need rest, now.” he said solici-
tously. “Later, we will talk of these
things.”

  Crain could see that the old scien-
tist was confident of winning him
over. But Lanu, with the face so
weirdly identical with his own, was
still suspicious.

  Dandor spoke a few brief words to
the robot, Kro. The great automaton
answered, metallically, "Yes, Master.”

  “Kro will take you to a chamber
where you can rest,” Dandor told
Crain.

CRAIN had to support Kay as they
followed the robot. She seemed
unable to walk steadily against this
lesser gravitation, and her eyes
showed her giddiness from its physi-
cal effects. Puzzled, she had not been
able to understand all the astounding
things that had been told to Crain, un-
til now quickly he explained to her, in
answer to her swift, nervous ques-
tions. She took it valiantly, though—
at first—as Crain had known she
would.

  Crain himself found his muscles at-
tuning themselves with amazing
swiftness to the new conditions. And
the cold, pungent air no longer rasped
his lungs.

  The clanking robot led them down
the dark stone stair, through a lighted
hangar or garage in the base of the
tower where two of the great Worms,
or snakelike vehicles, stood. Under
this was a subterranean level of dry,
well lighted living rooms. Kro opened
the door of one, and then clanked
away.

  The room was a square stone cham-
ber lighted by one of the little artifi-
cial suns in the ceiling. The metal
furniture was simple — a couch and
chairs, silk-covered, and a table.

  Kay sank down into a chair, and
covered her face with her hands.

  “Millions of miles from Earth,” she
whispered shakenly. “We’ll never get
back—never!”

  "Buck up, Kay,” begged Philip
Crain. “Dandor will send us back,
when we’ve rested.”

  She shook her head, her brown eyes
strangely bright as she uncovered her
face.

  “No, they won't send us back,” she
whispered. “They want to win you
over to that horrible plan of looting
Earth of its water. They think, be-
cause your father was a Martian,
you’ll join them. You won’t, will you,
Philip?"

  “Of course not,” he answered slow-
34

STARTLING STORIES

ly. “I couldn’t do a thing like that.”
“I’m afraid of your forgetting
Earth, Philip,” she said chokingly.
“You’re so exactly like your half-
brother, so much a Martian in appear-
ance.”

  “You needn’t fear me being disloyal
to Earth,” he told her; then his eyes
narrowed. “If we could get back up to
the matter-caster in the tower room,
and hurl ourselves back to Earth, we
could destroy the matter-caster on
Earth and cut the Martians off from it
forever.”

  “Can we?” Kay asked hopefully.
“Not now,” he answered. “I might
overcome Dandor, but that robot —
he’d be too much for me. Maybe later.”
Crain’s face was pale with emotion.
He must avert disaster to Earth—and
in doing so, he would doom his
father’s world!

  Through the silent chamber drifted
little floating flickers of hazy light,
such as he had seen dancing in
myriads outside.

  “What are they?” Kay asked puz-
zled. “They seem able to pass right
through the stone walls.”

  “They’re probably just some elec-
trical phenomenon peculiar to this
world—” Crain started to say when a
sudden loud burst of shouts from the
tower brought him and Kay both to
their feet.

  Men were pouring up the tower
—fiercely yelling men. There was the
clash of metal against metal from
overhead, then choking death-screams,
echoing hideously.

       CHAPTER VI
       Dandor’s Plan

KAY’S hand flew to her throat.
With those ghastly death-
screams had come a chorus of furious
cries of rage.

  "Fighting up there!” Philip Crain
exclaimed, his tall form stiffening. He
raced to the door of the chamber.
“You wait here, Kay!”

  But she reached his side before he
could open the door.

  "No, Philip, I'm going with you! I
won’t be left alone in this terrible
place.”

  “You can’t go!” he cried. “Please,
Kay—”

  Crain stopped, listening. There had
come a loud shout of triumph from
above, and then the noise of men rac-
ing hastily down from the tower
chamber. Crain flung open the door
and rushed down the little corridor
toward the stair, with Kay close be-
hind him.

  Outside, in the silvery light of the
single moon now setting, a half-dozen
men were climbing hastily into a big,
snakelike Worm that stood waiting.
Even as Crain emerged, the serpent-
shaped vehicle started with loud
drone and sped away across the moon-
lit desert, through the dancing will-o'-
the-wisps.

  “They've gone!” Crain cried.
“Somethin g’s happened those
screams—”

  He raced up the stone stairs toward
the tower. At the entrance to Dan-
dor’s brightly lighted laboratory, he
stopped, appalled.

  Two men lay dead across the door-
way, Baran soldiers dressed in tunics
of woven scales and caplike silver hel-
mets. Their faces had been hideously
battered in.

  Another dead Baran lay inside the
laboratory. And beside that corpse
sprawled the enormous metal form of
Kro. A section of the robot’s torso
had been eaten away in some manner,
exposing the intricate bulbs, wires and
transformers of his vitals.

  Old Dandor was just staggering to
his feet. The scientist’s forehead
streamed blood from a bad wound, and
his wrinkled face was ghastly. He
gripped a long silver tube in his shak-
ing hand.

  “What happened?” cried Philip
Crain, while Kay stared over his
shoulder in horror.

  “Lanu!” croaked the swaying old
man. “They’ve taken him! They dis-
abled Kro with a gas-gun, after he’d
killed three of them, and they struck
me down and left me for dead.”

  “The king — kidnaped?” Philip
Crain exclaimed. “Who did it?”
THE PRISONER OF MARS

'35

  “Surp’s men,” choked the old scien-
tist. “They were masked, but I recog-
nized the voice of Ligor, that hell-
spawned son of Surp. It was he who
struck me down.”

  “Surp?” repeated Crain. “The noble
you told me about, who wants to sup-
plant Lanu on the throne?”

  “Yes,” answered Dandor. He was
tottering, a terrible fear in his eyes.
“Surp’s spies must have seen Lanu
come here with Kro and reported to
their master. He sent Ligor and the
others to kidnap the king. And now
Surp will strike to seize the throne!”
Utter agony of spirit was in Dan-
dor’s face. Crain sprang toward him
with quick sympathy.

  “Get me the vial of orange liquid in
that cabinet,” said Dandor thickly,
motioning with his weapon.

CRAIN hurriedly obeyed. He saw
Dandor wince with pain as he
poured the orange fluid into the gash
on his temple. But with incredible
speed, the wound dried and closed. In
a few minutes, it was a brown scar.

  “Our most powerful therapeutic,”
muttered the scientist. “It has the
power to clot blood and dehydrate
surface tissue almost immediately.
Now stand aside, while I rid ourselves
of these dead with the gas-gun.”
Crain drew Kay back, as the old
man pointed the silver tube in his
hand. Three tiny clouds of green va-

por puffed from the tube, striking the
three bodies. They instantly disinte-
grated, crumbled, vanished—and part
of the floor with them.

 “Good Lord!” Crain exclaimed,
astounded by the deadly power of the
weapon. “What kind of gas is that?"

  “It is a secret synthetic gas t*hat acts
as an instant solvent of almost all sub-
stances,” Dandor said. ‘‘Only the
specially synthesized metal of these
tubes can resist its dissolving action.
We store it in the tube under tremen-
dous pressure, and it forms our most
powerful weapon.”

  Dandor’s strength seemed to be re-
turning now. He bent over the mo-
tionless metal body of the faithful
robot.

 “Only a few of Kro’s electrical
nerve-fibers are damaged,” he mut-
tered. “Their gas-guns did not hit
him squarely.”

  Swiftly he began working with deft
fingers on the complexities of the ro-
bot’s Interior mechanism. Then with
£ tiny flame-jet from a small machine,
he welded a new plate over it.

  Kro stirred his huge metal limbs,
and rose to his feet with a ponderous
clanking. The robot seemed un-
harmed by his experience.

 “Are you hurt, Master?” he asked
metallically, his expressionless lens-
eyes fixed on the old man.

 “Not now, Kro,” Dandor answered,

but agony was in his voice as he
turned to Crain and Kay. “I wish that
Ligor had killed me! Better far to
be dead than live to see that upstart
Surp ascend the throne of Bara!”
“What will Surp do with Lanu?”
Crain asked tensely. “Kill him?”

  He was feeling a surge of strange
emotion. Lanu, arrogant and spoiled
as he had seemed was, after all, his
half-brother.

  “No, Surp is too crafty to kill Lanu
at once,” Dandor answered miserably.
“Tomorrow morning in Ingomar,
capital of Bara, is a great annual cere-
mony—the Drawing of the Lots. The
king must preside at that ceremony.
When Lanu does not appear, Surp will
undoubtedly declare the king missing
and proclaim himself regent.

  "Once regent, he will quickly con-
solidate his power. When he feels he
has the reins safely in his hands, then
he will have Lanu killed. Until then,
he will keep Lanu a prisoner in some
secret place, so that should anything
go wrong with his plans, he can use
Lanu as a hostage to save his skin.”

  He paused a moment, with drooped
head, then added achingly: “And the
danger of Surp succeeding is greater,
because Lanu knows that the gulf be-
tween Bara and Cholu is now bridged.
If Surp learns that, he will tell the
people that he has succeeded in bring-
ing the great plan to fruition. He
will lead the Baran forces to Cholu,
and then he will be firm on the throne,
for the people will worship anyone
who finally brings new water to
Bara.”

PHILIP CRAIN was appalled.
This ruthless noble Surp, carry-
ing out that ominous plan, speeding
across the void with Martian forces,
to loot Earth of water! Using all the
weapons of Martian science, the
Worms and gas-guns and probably
many more, against Earth when it
resisted the thievery of its water!

  For a wild moment, Crain thought
of forcing Dandor to send him and
Kay back to Earth, so that they could
destroy the matter-caster there. But
he realized that was impossible. Dan-
dor still had the deadly gas-gun in

his hand, and the robot Kro was stand-
ing ready to act. Force could achieve
nothing.

  "Can’t you go to Ingomar and ex-
pose Surp as the kidnaper of the
king?” he demanded of Dandor.

  The old scientist shook his white
head. “It would be useless. Surp
would simply deny it, and what proof
would I have? The men in the raid-
ing party were all masked.” His voice
quivered. “No, it means the end of
Lanu’s rule, if he does not appear to-
morrow at the Drawing of Lots. The
end of the long line of the rightful
rulers of Bara.”

  Dandor's voice trailed off as his
great black eyes widened. He stared
at Philip Crain as though he saw him
for the first time.

  "Krayn!” he shouted exultantly.
“Why did I not think of it before! A
way to save the throne for Lanu! He
cannot appear for the Drawing of the
Lots tomorrow—but the king can—
you can! You can impersonate him!
You are almost an exact double of
your half-brother. You can hold the
throne for him until we are able to
find and rescue him!”

CHAPTER VII

Under Martian Moons

PHILIP CRAIN reeled from the
staggering shock of the incred-
ibly audacious thing Dandor was sug-
gesting.

  "To double for Lanu—for the king
of this world?” he cried, aghast. “No,
I couldn't do it!”

  "You can!” Dandor insisted fiercely.
“And no one on Bara, except us,
knows that Lanu has such an identical
halT-brother. No one will dream of
questioning your identity.”

  “But I, a man from another world,
to dare such an impersonation!”
Crain cried. “Speaking in a language
which I have only just learned! It’s
impossible!”

  “You speak the Aran language now
as well as Lanu!” Dandor declared.
“For you did not learn our tongue to-
THE PRISONER OF MARS

night, you remembered it. Complete
knowledge of it was in the hereditary
synaptic pattern of your brain, and I
recalled that.”

  "Still, I’m utterly ignorant of your
world and customs,” Crain declared.
“I’d betray myself in a moment.”
“I’ll be at your side to coach you,”
Dandor assured him eagerly.

  “Yet Surp and his son Ligor—they
hold the real Lanu prisoner some-
where,” Crain reminded. “They
would know that I was an impostor.”
"They’ll know, yes—but they won’t
dare tell,” Dandor retorted. “They
would not admit they had kidnaped
the king.”

  “Don’t do what he asks, Philip!”
pleaded Kay, clinging to his arm.
“Whatever it is! Don’t let them
make a Martian of you!”

  Philip Crain’s brain was spinning as
he considered a new idea that had
rushed into his mind. This great
imposture that Dandor proposed—it
might give him a chance to avert the
thing the Martians planned to do to
Earth.

  Crain knew that as a lone stranger,
with a whole world pitted against
him, he could not hope to thwart the
great Martian plan. But posing as
the Martian king, holding the reins of
power, he might be able to thwart the
Martian dream. And he must do that.
For, strong as was the pull of his
Martian blood, he could no-t let disas-
ter come to Earth.

  Swiftly, he decided to take this one
chance open to him.

  “I’ll do it!” he exclaimed.

  “I knew Tharkol’s son would not
fail me!” Dandor cried joyfully.

  Kay’s eyes were wide with stunned
disbelief as Crain hastily explained to
her, translating what Dandor had said.

  “You’re becoming one of them—be-
coming a traitor to Earth!” she angrily
accused Crain.

  “It’s for Earth’s sake I’m doing it,
Kay!” he told her swiftly in English.
“It’s the only way open to me to de-
fend our world.”

  “Will it help Earth for you to join
her attackers?” she flamed. “You’re
betraying your world, for a throne!
You’re not the Philip Crain I knew!

You're one of these Martians—”

  She swayed, almost fell, her face
colorless. Crain sprang anxiously to
support her.

  “She is feeling the effect of the
lesser gravitation and thinner air of
Bara,” Dandor said quickly. “You,
who are half of Baran blood, have not
been affected so much.”

  He made Kay swallow a few drops
of milky fluid, and led her to a chair.
She sat, her face in her hands.

  “Now we must start for Ingomar!”
Dandor exclaimed. “The night is
wearing away and the Drawing of
the Lots takes place soon after sun-
rise. But first your garments must be
changed.”

HE took from a cabinet a suit of
the silken Martian garments. In
a small closet Philip Crain divested
himself of his khaki clothes and boots
and put on the strange dress. There
were white silk sleeveless shirt and
shorts, a short white tunic belted over
them, high, soft leather sandals, and
Lanu’s brilliant crimson cloak.

  “Lucky that the kidnapers left
Lanu’s cloak here,” Dandor muttered.
“The king must wear the royal crim-
son.”

  The old man gasped when Crain
finally straightened for inspection.

  “You’re the image of Lanu!”

  Crain glimpsed himself in a wall
mirror. He stiffened. Was this be—
this tall, resplendent figure, crimson
cloak flaring behind him, dark, lean
face proudly lifted?

  “Tharkol’s blood!” Dandor was say-
ing, his eyes glistening. “It shows in
you, Krayan. You look every inch a
king.”

  Sudden excitement throbbed like
strong wine through Philip Crain’s
blood. He, the lonely young engineer
—a king on Mars! And suddenly he
felt a heady tide of confidence and
authority. After all, he was Tharkol’s
son.

  His vaulting emotions chilled. He
was letting his Martian blood get the
upper hand. And that must not hap-
pen. He must keep remembering
Earth, and what threatened Earth.
That was his one reason for playing
STARTLING STORIES

this dangerous game of impersona-
tion. “Start the Worm, Kro,” Dandor
ordered. “We must hasten.”

  The great robot clanked down the
stairs. Crain put a Martian cloak
around Kay's shivering shoulders, and
pulled the girl gently to her feet.

  Kay made no resistance, but her
brown eyes were bitter as they met
his. He knew she was hating him for
his apparent desertion to the Mar-
tains.

  The three emerged from the stone
tower into the sharp chill of the open
air. Both moons, which Dandor had
called Kabu and Noru, were now set-
ting, one westward, the other east-
ward.

  The waiting Worm was a flexible,
annulated cylinder of silver metal,
eight feet in diameter, twenty feet
long. Its ring-shaped sections were
fastened by sliding joints so that they
could contract or expand longitudi-
nally.

  “It advances over the ground just as
a real worm crawls,” Dandor ex-
plained, “by expanding the fore part
of its body straight ahead, then con-
tracting it, pulling the rest of the
body after it. This motion, repeated
with great swiftness, gives the Worm
great speed. Only such a vehicle as
this is practical on Bara, where the
deep desert sands would choke wheels
and where the atmosphere is too thin
for practical flying.”

  “Where does its power come from?”
Crain asked, staring at the thing.

  “From the sun,” Dandor answered
surprisingly. “We Barans have for
sole source of power the photo-electric
effect of the sun’s rays. Our mechan-
isms are all so constructed that when
the sunlight strikes them it builds up
photo-electric energy in them which
is automatically stored as a potential
in the machine itself. The matter-
casters operate from the same power.”

  They entered by a small door in the
side of the Worm. Metal chairs
swung in gimbals, inside. Kro al-
ready sat in the control-chair by the
window in the nose of the vehicle. A
hidden motor in the rear was droning.

  “To Ingomar!” the scientist ordered
Kro.

  “Yes, Master,” answered the robot
flatly.

KRO jerked back a lever and the
strange vehicle began to slide
smoothly over the desert. There was
no bumping, for the flexible body
adapted itself to the ground. Soon
the worm was gliding at high speed
across the moonlit plain of sand.

  Over this vast plain, dancing, drift-
ing, floating like little ghosts of light,
hung the numberless will-o'-the-wisps
that Crain had noticed before. Like
a scattered host of glowing fire-flies,
they wandered.

  “What are those shining things?”
he asked Dandor. "Some kind of elec-
trical phenomenon?”

  At the question, there came into
Dandor’s face a dim horror.

  “They are—the Electrae,” he an-
swered, an overwhelming sadness and
dread in his haunted eyes, as he gazed
at the drifting things of light.

  “The Electrae?” repeated Crain, un-
able to comprehend the dark horror
he saw in Dandor’s face.

  Before Dandor could answer, the
robot Kro turned and addressed him.

  “The sun is about to rise, Master,
and we will reach Ingomar soon.
Where in the city do we go?”
“Straight to the royal palace, Kro,”
ordered the old man. “To the rear
court.”

  Philip Crain stared at the huge
metal figure that sat so stiffly, driving
the speeding Worm and peering with
glassy, emotionless lens-eyes out
through the window.

  "Is Kro really only a machine?” he
asked Dandor incredulously. “He
seems so intelligent, so human—”

  “He is but a robot, whom I myself
constructed years ago,” Dandor as-
sured him. “He has been the most
faithful of servants to me. Because
of my great services to the royal
family, Kro was permitted to exist
when all the other robots on Bara were
destroyed some years ago.”

  “Why were they all destroyed?”
Crain asked wonderingly.

  Dandor explained. “The people had
a bad experience that caused them to
be apprehensive of robots. A com-

mittee of scientists, of which I was
chief, had constructed a special
thinking-robot, a great metal brain
with more than human aptitude in
mechanical matters. We hoped that
this Brain would be able to help us
design a rocket ship that would reach
Cholu safely. Because, for vital rea-
sons, we had specialized in atomic
physics for so many generations that
we had neglected mechanical science.

  “The Brain did, in fact, help us
greatly in the design of the rocket
ship in which your father Tharkol
flew to Cholu. But shortly after this,
the Brain showed signs of feeling that
it was superior to men, and its cunning
and its aptitude in invention were so
great that we decided that it and all

other robots should be destroyed.
They were all taken into a remote part
of the desert, and destroyed with gas-
guns.”

  Philip Crain glanced at the white-
faced girl in the chair behind him.

WIT AY, you feel better now?” he
  JKm asked anxiously.

  “What difference does it make to
you?” she retorted bitterly. “You
and I—we’re not of the same races
any more, since you chose to become
a Martian.”

  “Kay, please—” Crain began, but
seeing that he could not now convince
her, he gave up and stared moodily
ahead.

  The sun was rising. It seemed
STARTLING STORIES

small and shrunken to Crain’s eyes,
yet blazed brightly in the cloudless
sky. Under its flaring light, the sandy
wastes Btretched in brooding, somber
crimson, marching to the horizon in
great ridges and dimes. It was an
arid, deathly landscape.

  Upon this limitless red desert, the
hosts of drifting will-o’-tfie-wisps
that Dandor had called the Electrae,
and that he had regarded with such
mysterious dread, were visible only
as vague flickers in the sunlight.

  Crain glimpsed green lands ahead—
a narrow fertile region that he knew
must overlay one <f[ the hidden aque-
ducts that brought water from the
polar snow-cap. When they reached
the fertile land, Kro drove the Worm
onto a smooth road of pale red stone
that led through the cultivated strip.

  On either side of them were inten-
sively cultivated fields of waving
green grain, and low bushes of pale
yellow fruits. No workers were visi-
ble. Nor was any animal life, except
such few insects as would be needed
for pollenizing. Long ago, Crain
guessed, the struggle for existence on
dying Mars must have forced the
elimination of such comparatively
wasteful food-raising devices as do-
mestic animals.

  “This is the fertile strip in which
lies the capital Ingomar," Dandor was
saying. “Pitifully small, it is. No
wonder that each year we must have
the Drawing of the Lots.”

  Kro pointed his great metal arm
ahead.

  “Ingomar,” rasped the robot.

  Ingomar! Philip Crairt’s heart beat
faster as he peered ahead. The city
where he must carry out his great im-
posture, for Earth’s sake. The city
where his father had reigned as king,
and where today he must impersonate
a king.

  “Aye, Ingomar, our capital and one
of our five last cities,” Dandor was
saying somberly. “All the others are
now but ruins in the desert, tenanted
only by the Electrae.”

  Dim and rosy upon the horizon
reared a duster of incredibly slender
and lofty towers. It looked like an
elfin city out of legend, to the Earthly

eyes of Philip Crain and Kay. And
as they drew closer, the splendor of
Ingomar seemed to grow greater.
Built all of pale red stones, it was a
rosy city of the dawn.

INGOMAR covered several dozens
of square miles. Many buildings
were no more than three or four stor-
ies high. But everywhere from these
lower buildings aspired the slender
towers, some of them two or three
hundred feet high. And the towers
were ringed with giddy spiral stair-
ways and wide, unsupported balcon-
ies that gave the whole rose-colored
metropolis its elfin, fairy appearance.

  Crain realized that this fairylike
architecture was possible on Mars be-
cause of the planet’s lesser gravita-
tion. Yet it still seemed to him that
those high balconies and unsupported
spiral stairs must crash at any mo-
ment, that the whole city must fall of
its own weight.

  Far within the forest of fairy towers
rose two huge spires, topping all
others, pale red columns tipped with
flashing silver. Kro was driving the
Worm straight through the wide,
smooth-paved streets toward them.
And they saw no human being in all
the streets and shops and stalls.

  “The place looks utterly deserted,”
said Crain in astonishment.

  “The people are already gathered
outside the palace for the Drawing of
the Lots!” Dandor cried. “Hurry, Kro
—hurry!”

CHAPTER Vin
The Droning of I he Lets

HILE the Worm shot with ac-
celerated speed through the
deserted streets, Philip Crain’s heart
pounded. Each moment, this imper-
sonation that he had undertaken
seemed more fantastic and impossible
of success. And Dandor, too, seemed
wrought to a high pitch of tenseness.

  Many of the stone buildings of this
city of elfin, rosy towers had an un-
occupied, abandoned look. Whole sec-
THE PRISONER OF MARS

 41

tions of the city were apparently un-
inhabited, beginning to crumble; mute
evidence of the dwindling of the Mar-
tian race and their dying world.

  “What is this Drawing of the Lots
at which I must preside?” Crain
asked Dandor, suddenly remembering
that in all the other excitement he had
not thought to ask,

  “No time to explain it now — we
near the palace!” the old scientist an-
swered tautly. “Now comes the test
of our scheme.” He added urgently,
“I will be at your side, telling you
what to say and do, every moment.
But be sure that your mien is proud
and haughty.”

  The twin lofty towers of the palace
lay now to their right as they circled
to approach it from the rear. The
palace itself was an enormous oblong
structure of rosy stone, a half-dozen
stories high, the two soaring towers
rising from its east and west wings.
Flanking these wing lay green gar-
dens, with small trees and shrubs of
blooming flowers.

  The broad facade of the palace faced
upon an immense oval plaza in which
milled a vast throng of people. At the
south end of this oval plaza, facing
the great palace, rose another massive
structure; a domed round building
with walls of immense thickness.

 The Worm, with Kro expertly
handling its controls, approached the
rear of the palace and passed through
opened gates of silver metal into a
paved court. Baran soldiers stood on
guard here, dressed in tunics of silver
scales and gleaming helmets, and
wearing gas-guns. They sprang to at-
tention as Crain emerged from the
Worm.

  Dandor and Kay followed Crain.
In the white silk cloak that Dandor
had put on her shoulders the girl
looked as much Baran as her compan-
ions. The great robot clanked after
them.

  “Through the left door, and down
the corridor inside,” muttered Dan-
dor to Crain. “Disregard the sen-
tries.

  Philip Crain strode forward, scarlet
cloak swirling brilliantly behind his
tall figure, his lean, dark face gazing

impatiently ahead as though not see-
ing the sentries.

  The guards saluted with their gas-
guns. And an officer, bowing to Crain,
spoke respectfully.

  “The ceremony is ready to begin,
Highness.”

  Philip Crain nodded and strode on
through the door Dandor had in-
dicated. He found himself in a wide,
rosy corridor aglow with the light of
tiny artificial suns in its ceiling. Down
this he went, Dandor hurrying Kay
after him, the huge, clanking robot
following imperturbably.

  “The next door to the right—the
lift-cage of the west tower,” Dandor
said in a low voice.

   The lift-cage was a small cylindrical
metal chamber. Inside it, Dandor
touched a stud. The cage shot up-
ward, with a swift, smooth and sound-
less rush. It came to rest, locking
automatically, at a level high in the
tower. This whole floor of the tower
was a single ring-shaped apartment.

OU have passed muster so
far!” declared Dandor ex-
ultantly. “Now if you can deceive the
nobles and the people, all will be well
for the time being.”

  Philip Crain wiped damp perspira-
tion from his brow. “I thought they’d
challenge me any moment!” he ex-
claimed.

   “This is my private suite in the pal-
ace,” Dandor explained. “We will
leave the girl here, under Kro’s
watch.”

  “So I am your prisoner now,
Philip?” the white-faced Kay said
bitterly.

  “Please, Kay, try to reserve judg-
ment on what I’m doing,” he pleaded.
“I tell you, I’m only thinking of Earth
in all this—working for our world.”

  Kay turned away, unbelieving.
Though Crain had spoken to her in
English, he saw that Dandor was
watching him, so he desisted.

  The rooms of the scientist’s ring-
shaped apartment were large, lighted
by tall windows with silver gratings.
The rooms were obviously the old
man’s laboratory here. The others
were hung in bright silks, and the
42

STARTLING STORIES

metal furniture was gracefully beauti-
ful.

  The windows on one side looked
down upon the great plaza. Looking
down at the crowd that packed it^
Crain felt himself shrinking from this
adventure. All those tens of thou-
sands, waiting for their king ! And he
was to deceive them!

  “Now for the ceremony!” Dandor
cried. “I crave to see Surp’s face,
when you make your appearance."

  “We can’t fool them all,” Crain
muttered, his face tense.

  “You cannot back out now,” Dandor
told him strongly. “Come—we must
not delay longer.”

  They stepped back into the lift-
cage, and shot downward. As they
emerged into the corridor upon the
ground level, silken-clad chamberlains
hurried forward. Dandor waved them
aside, and, without seeming to do so,
led Crain forward through the palace.

  Crain got but glimpses of great, ma-
jestic halls hung with the royal crim-
son, antechambers and broad corridors
leading in all directions, balconies
opening upon the green gardens. And
even here there floated the firefly, im-
material things that Dandor had called
the Electrae, drifting and dancing
through passages and rooms.

  Then Crain found himself with
Dandor in a small antechamber. A
door in front of them was pierced with
a tiny window through which came a
shaft of bright sunlight.

  “Wait,” Dandor commanded. “It is
not yet the moment for the king to ap-
pear. The nobles are still gathering.”

  Philip Crain peered through the
tiny aperture. Just outside the door
lay a broad stone terrace, flanked by
solid ranks of soldiery, their helmets
gleaming. On the terrace were gath-
ering the nobles of Bara—brilliantly
cloaked men and women in silks of
every color except crimson, the
women wearing long gowns instead
of tunics under their cloaks.

  One great object on the terrace
challenged Philip Crain’s attention. It
was a metal pedestal upon which
rested two huge, transparent spheres,
whose curving edges touched. One
sphere was a quarter filled with a mass

of tiny black balls, and the other
sphere was empty.

BEYOND the terrace stood the
great throng of people. Men,
women and children—mostly dressed
in cloaks and tunics and gowns of
plain white or gray. Each man wore s
small black badge upon his breast. And
this great mass of humanity, unlike
the nobles, stood in an utter dead si-
lence. The two transparent spheres
on the terrace were holding their at-
tention.

  “See—Surp and Ligor come!” whis-
pered Dandor, indicating two green-
cloaked nobles who were coming up
onto the terrace with a numerous
retinue.

  Surp, the ambitious, intriguing
noble who aspired to the throne!

  Surp was a massive figure, with a
face that combined brutality and the
shrewdness of experience, a hard, griz-
zled mask stamped with relentless
force. Ligor, his slender, indolent-
looking son, was a handsome, droop-
ing-eyed and foppish-looking young
man.

  “That devil’s cub Ligor will be sur-
prised too to see me, whom he thinks
he slew,” Dandor exulted. “Be not de-
ceived by his foppish appearance,
Krayn—he is a deadly antagonist.”

  “They look damned confident,”
Crain muttered. “And listen to the
people!”

  As Surp appeared on the terrace, a
low chorus of voices hailed him from
the plaza. It was unmistakably a
chorus of approval.

  Surp’s massive, brutal face and
shrewd eyes glistened with satisfac-
tion. And Ligor’s insolent eyes were
complacent.

  “I cannot guess by what means Surp
has won the people over so far,” Dan-
dor muttered. “Every year, it seems,
the supporters of Surp grow more nu-
merous and the supporters of Lanu
fewer.”

  A chamberlain out on the terrace
raised his voice.

  “The Princess Mara!”

  The girl who was coming out of the
palace, followed by two women, wore
the crimson of the royal house — a
THE PRISONER OF MARS

43

flaming scarlet cloak over a silken
white gown that reached to her ankles.
She wore white leather sandals, and
her dark head was bare.

  Crain thought he had never seen so
proud, so vital a figure. Her beautiful,
clear olive face was composed, but he
detected shadows in her blue-black
eyes. She took her position, and faced
the crowd in silence. The dandified
Ligor leaned and spoke to her eagerly.

  "Princess Mara is Lanu’s financee—
your fiancee, for the time being,” Dan-
dor was saying tensely. “You are sup-
posed to be madly in love with her.
Remember that.”

  "Good Lord!” exclaimed Crain,
aghast. "You didn’t tell me that—”

  Blast of silver trumpets shattered
his words. And after them the loud
voice of a chamberlain.

  "The King!”

  The eyes of all the vast crowd, and
of all the brilliant nobles on the ter-
race, turned toward the door behind
which Philip Crain and Dandor stood.

  "Remember, speak as I whisper to
you,” Dandor said.

  Crain caught the old scientist’s arm,
kept him from opening the door. His
courage was suddenly gone.

  “I can’t do it!” he said hoarsely.
“Not before that whole crowd and
court! They’ll know I’m not Lanu!”

  "You must do it!” exclaimed Dan-
dor frantically. “Think of what de-
pends on it—your brother’s throne.
See, even now, Surp advances to de-
clare himself regent!”

THERE had been a low whisper
among the nobles and the crowd as
the king failed to appear. The mas-
sive figure of Surp was advancing to
the center of the terrace, a triumphant
gleam in the noble's eyes.

  That triumph in Surp's hard face
fired Philip Crain's blood, and
steadied his quivering nerves. He
couldn’t tamely allow the upstart
noble to seize the throne of his father!
And Crain was suddenly remember-
ing, too, all that depended on him—
the Martian threat to Earth that he
must thwart.

  “Since King Lanu does not ap-
pear—” Surp started to announce

loudly to the puzzled crowd, and
Philip Crain flung open the door. He
strode out onto the terrace in the sun-
light, his dark head haughtily high.

  "The King!” came a shout of greet-
ing from the crowd, though it sounded
forced and hollow. The nobles bowed.

  All except Surp and Ligor. They
stared as though they could not be-
lieve their eyes. Ligor’s jaw was drop-
ping ludicrously, and Surp’s massive
face was white.

  “Lanu! And Dandor!” ejaculated
Surp. “But you can’t—”

  Philip Crain felt a sudden rush of
confidence, of hard authority, as he
faced the conspiring noble. In that
moment he was Tharkol’s son.

  "You were about to speak to the
crowd, Surp,” he said ironically.
“What do you wish to say?”

  “Nothing, Highness,” stammered
Surp, his face grey with shock. “I
thought—”

  “Then why not go back to your
place with the other?” said Crain.

  The hard, sharp tone of his voice,
the flash of his eyes, seemed to amaze
Surp even further. The thunder-
struck noble moved dazedly back to
the side of his son.

  Philip Crain glimpsed the Princess
Mara gazing at him with dark eyes
wide with astonishment, her red lips
parted. Amazement at seeing Lanu
take that tone with Surp, he knew.

  But now Crain stood, gazing into
the great sea of white faces that filled
the plaza. Faces that were blurred
with strange dread.

  Dandor was whispering, and Crain
spoke forth loudly, repeating the old
scientist's words.

  “People of Bara, another year has
passed. And in it, as in all the years
of the past, our world has become still
more arid, its water and fertile land
scantier. So we must do what we have
had to do every year for ages—we
must decrease our population, this
time by four thousand families. That
many must pass that the rest may be
able to live.

  “Four thousand men shall be chosen
in this Drawing of the Lots today
And those chosen shall, with th«ir
wives and families, depart tomorrow,
STARTLING STORIES

the Day of Passing. And now I, the
king, in all justice and impartiality,
draw the lots.”

  Crain, loudly repeating Dandor’s
whispered words, felt an inward
amazement. These words that he was
saying—did they mean that four thou-
sand families were going to be killed?
That was impossible, surely. Yet—
“The button on the pedestal of the
spheres,” Dandor was whispering
tensely. “Press it!”

CRAIN pressed the black button.
Inside the sphere of the tiny
black balls, air hissed. The ebony balls
suddenly whirled with mad speed.

  The packed populace on the plaza
were watching the whirling balls with
faces in which life and death seemed
to struggle for supremacy.

  Then Crain noticed that there was
a small aperture between the two
touching spheres. Through this aper-
ture, some of the swirling little balls
were constantly being thrown by ran-
dom chance into the empty sphere. As
they entered the empty sphere, the
tiny balls glowed with sudden light.

  And Crain perceived that almost
every time this happened to a ball, the
black badge of one of the men in the
throng before him glowed also with
light. He began to understand at least
the method of this great lottery.

  Those tiny black balls—there was
one of them for each man on Mars—
and each ball were somehow in elec-
tro-magnetic rapport with the badge
word by that man. When a ball was
thrown at random into the empty left-
hand sphere, forces there caused it to
glow with light and the corresponding
badge of some man immediately
glowed also, showing that the man and
his family had been chosen in the
Drawing of the Lots.

  Chosen—for what?

       CHAPTER IX
       Palace of Peril

AN utter and awful silence held the
vast throng as this weird lottery
proceeded. The tiny black balls in the

righthand sphere continued to swirl
and seethe, but Philip Crain, bewil-
deredly watching this strange lottery
over which he was presiding, noticed
that some of the balls thrown into the
sphere of the chosen caused no badge
in the crowd to glow. Crain guessed
that those chosen in such cases must
not be in this crowd but were citizens
of the other four cities.

  Crain heard a man in the crowd ut-
ter a hoarse, raw cry of despair as his
badge glowed. A woman sank into a
dead faint as the man beside her was
chosen, and another screamed chok-
ingly as her husband’s badge broke
into fateful light. But except for these
few, the chosen ones in the throng ac-
cepted their fate in deathly, hopeless
silence.

  The machinery in the pedestal of
the spheres ceased to hum. Four
thousand balls had been thrown into
the lefthand sphere. The Drawing of
the Lots was over.

  Dandor was whispering again be-
hind Crain. And Philip Crain, speak-
ing slowly to that deathly-faced
throng, repeated the words.

  “Tomorrow is the Day of Passing,
as you know. Tomorrow at noon, the
chosen among you will gather with
your families in the temple, where
they will pass that the rest of our race
may live.”

  Slowly, in deathly silence, the great
crowd began to stream away. And it
seemed to Crain that as the throng
dispersed, their horror-laden eyes
were fixed on the drifting, firefly
things that flickered in the air—the
Electrae.

  As the crowd dispersed, the nobles
left their positions and began to chat
and laugh together.

  “Will all those chosen be at the
temple?” Crain asked Dandor incred-
ulously. “Won’t they try to es-
cape?”

  “They cannot escape,” Dandor an-
swered. “No man can live in the
desert, and in the cities, their glowing
badges would betray them.”

 “They could throw away the
badges,” Crain objected, but the old
scientist shook his head.

  “No, every man on Bara must wear
THE PRISONER OF MARS

his badge always. The nobility and
the scientist class wear no badges be-
cause they are exempt from the Draw-
ing of the Lots.”

  “But what will happen to those
chosen ones tomorrow?” Crain asked.
"They surely won’t be killed?”

  “No,” said Dandor sadly. “It is a
fate far worse than death that—” He
broke off. “The princess approaches!”
he muttered. “Be careful now,
Krayn!”

  The eyes of the Princess Mara as
she came toward Crain were fixed on
his face inquiringly.

  “Where did you go in such haste
last night, Lanu?” she asked. “You
promised to tell me today.”

  So Lanu had been with the princess
when Dandor had summoned him to
the desert tower. Crain realized with
a chill that he might easily betray
himself to this girl.

  “I can’t tell you yet, Mara,” he said,
trying to smile. “Later on, you’ll
learn.”

  Mara’s beautiful face showed aston-
ishment. “It is the first time you ever
refused me anything, Lapu!”

  Crain abruptly remembered what
Dandor had said—that Lanu was
deeply in love with his fiancee. He
was racking his mind for a reply,
when there came an interruption.

Inside the sphere of the tiny black balls, air hissed (Chapter Vlll)
46

STARTLING STORIES

SURP and Ligor were approaching
him. And all the nobles on the
terrace became silent, intently watch-
ing as the powerful noble and his son
crossed the stone platform.

  Surp’s grizzled face still wore an
expression of dazed surprise, and his
shrewd, small eyes were calculating
as he bowed to Philip Crain. Ligor,
his handsome countenance warped
with hatred, was glaring at Crain as
he also bowed.

  “I beg leave to depart, Highness,”
Surp said, his voice unsteady. “I
have urgent business.”

  A cold flame of wrath rose inside
Crain. He spoke without considering
his words.

  “Urgent plotting against my throne,
you mean,” he told Surp harshly.

  A gasp of surprise went up from the
nobles. And Mara, who had stepped
a little back, looked on with unbe-
lieving eyes.

  Surp seemed doubly stunned by the
sudden savage indictment. His mouth
opened, he tried to speak.

  “If you doubt my loyalty, High-
ness,” he choked, “I—”

  “I know what your loyalty is
worth, Crain cut him off contemptu-
ously. “Go, if you wish. Your plots
do not worry us.”

  Surp’s face had gone dull red at the
cutting rebuke. But when Ligor, hate
twisting his handsome features,
stepped forward as though to speak,
his father held him back. The older
man muttered in Ligor’s ear. Then
they bowed, and moved brusquely
away.

  “What possessed you to talk to Surp
like that?” Dandor whispered to
Crain. “Lanu would never have done
that. He was too afraid of Surp.”

  “I couldn't help it,” muttered Crain.
“Now Surp and Ligor will speed at
once to wherever their men are hold-
ing Lanu prisoner,” Dandor said, his
eyes narrowing. “They will want to
know how Lanu escaped. And they
will discover you are an impostor.”
The old scientist’s eyes flashed. “Wait
—I will be back quickly!”

  And before Crain could protest,
Dandor was gone, pushing excitedly
through the throng of nobles.

  Philip Crain felt a tremor of appre-
hension as he was left to himself, sur-
rounded by the nobles who were all
gazing at him in puzzled surprise.
Without Dandor at his side, could he
hold up this impersonation?

  The Princess Mara’s beautiful face
wore an incredulous expression as she
came closer to him.

  “I never thought that you had the
courage to beard Surp to his face,
Lanu!” she exclaimed.

  “Are you sorry that I did?” Crain
asked.

  “Sorry?” There was a flash like
lightning in her deep-blue eyes. “You
know how many times I’ve tried to
make you stiffen your attitude to
Surp, how often I’ve pointed out to
you the conspiracies against you
which he has fostered.”

  Crain laughed with sudden reckless-
ness. “Yes, I know you have,” he said.
“But Surp and his plots are the least
of my worries.”

  “Yet Surp has the support of a
great part of the people,” R^ara re-
minded him. “They grow tired of
this yearly Drawing of the Lots—
tired of the shadow of horrible doom
under which they live. And Surp
makes them smooth promises that if
he is king, he will abolish all that.”

  “I can turn the people to my side,
all of them, whenever I wish,” Crain
told her, proudly and confidently.

HE was suddenly amazed to real-
ize how much, unconsciously,
he was stepping into the part of the
Martian king. He almost felt as if he
were king of Bara, by right.

  Crain knew whence that feeling
came—from his father. That heredi-
tary memory-pattern that he had in-
herited from Tharkol, or John Crain
—though once it had been broken, it
was now waking further to life under
the stimulus of his present position.
He mustn’t let it wake too much! He
must remain Philip Crain, working
secretly for the cause of Earth.

  Mara seemed puzzled at the power
and authority in Crain’s confident
words.

  “You are different today, Lanu,”
she said thoughtfully.
THE PRISONER OF MARS

47

   A tiny chill ran down Crain’s back.
Had he overdone his part? Then he
saw, in Mara’s deep eyes, the slow
kindling of something that stirred his
blood, left him breathless.

   “I think,” she said, “that I shall not
 regret next week’s ritual so much,
 after all.”

  “What ritual takes place next
week?” Crain asked, before he
thought. The next moment he could
have bitten out his tongue. For
amazement showed in Mara’s face.

   “Our marriage, of course,” she said,
 in astonishment. “You cannot have
 become so absent-minded, Lanu.”
 Crain floundered for an answer. “I
 was only jesting, Mara,” he said, try-
 ing to laugh. “How could I be absent-
 minded about that when I have been
 urging it so long?”

   The princess said nothing. But she
seemed intensely perplexed, doubt-
ful. Crain realized that he had come
very close to complete betrayal of
himself.

  He thanked his stars when he saw
Dandor returning. The old scien-
tist’s face showed suppressed excite-
ment, as he asked Mara:

  “You’ll pardon me, Princess, if I
take the king from your side? We
have an important matter to discuss.”
Mara inclined her dark head word-
lessly, her puzzled eyes still on Crain’s
face. Awkwardly Philip Crain re-
turned the bow and let Dandor lead
him toward one of the palace doors.

   The old scientist was quivering with
 emotion. Something important must
 have happened. But Crain could not
 forget that dawning doubt in Mara’s
 eyes. Even now she was looking after
 him with a little frown of perplexity.

   Crain felt a sudden stab of appre-
hension. Did Mara suspect his im-
posture? Did she?

CHAPTER X

The Electrae

DANDOR’S voice was vibrant as
the old man led Philip Crain
hurriedly along one of the rose-walled

corridors of the palace.

  “We shall soon know where Surp is
holding Lanu prisoner!” he declared.
“I knew .that Surp and Ligor would
hurry straight from here to the place
where they are keeping the king!”
“And you’ve arranged for a spy to
follow them?” Crain said quickly.

  “No,” Dandor replied. “Surp and
his men will be on the lookout for
spies. I did better than that. I put
a tracer into Surp’s Worm.”

  “A tracer?” Crain repeated uncom-
prehendingly.

  Dandor’s white head bobbed. “Yes,
a tracer is a tiny ball like those used
in the Drawing of the Lots, contain-
ing a miniature transmitter of electro-
magnetic vibrations. By means of its
constantly emitted signals, we can
learn the tracer’s exact whereabouts
from an apparatus in my apartment
here.”

  They had reached the lift-cage and
in a moment were shooting upward.

  When they entered Dandor’s sun-
lit apartment, Kay was standing at a
window, looking down upon the crowd
still dispersing in the plaza. The
robot Kro stood in watchful silence
exactly where they had left him.

  Dandor hurried into his laboratory.
But Crain paused anxiously at the
girl’s side.

   “I didn’t like to leave you, Kay,” he
said. “But I had to.”

  Her face was set and composed, but
her eyes were full of scorn. •

  “Yes, I saw you down there, among
your nobles, speaking to your people,”
she said bitterly. “You looked a true
Martian. I congratulate you on the
speed with which you’ve adapted
yourself.”

  “Kay, please try to understand,” he
groaned. “It’s as I told you—the
only chance I have of working for
Earth against this Martian scheme is
to play this part. I don’t like to do it,
but I’ve got to.”

  “I don’t believe you,” she said
slowly, “You like being a Martian,
Philip. You’ve forgotten your Earth
blood. You forget it more every hour
we’re on this world.”

  Crain could not deny the partial
truth of that indictment. He had
48

STARTLING STORIES

been forced to fight every moment
against the strong pull of his Martian
inheritance.

  “You’re a king on Mars now,” Kay
was adding scornfully. “The Philip
Crain who would have died rather
than join the enemies of his own
Earth people, is dead.”

  “Krayn—come here!” Dandor called
from his laboratory.

  With a hopeless glance at Kay’s set,
embittered face, Philip Crain turned
and entered the room where Dandor
was hanging over a big globe that
represented the planet. Most of it
was blank red desert, but at the poles
were the little white snow-caps, and
branching from them the canals that
carried water to the scant fertile lands
around the few Martian cities.

 Not far from Ingomar upon the
globe-map shone a tiny spark of white
light. It was moving slowly south-
eastward, crawling into the blank red
desert.

HE signal light from the trac-
er,” Dandor explained. “The
tracer’s emitted electromagnetic vi-
brations are received by the apparatus
inside this globe, and automatically
plotted by direction and intensity, so
that that little spark shows the trac-
er’s exact position at any time.”
“Then Surp and his men are holding
Lanu somewhere in the deserts south-
east of here,” muttered Philip Crain.

 Dandor nodded. “We shall soon
know exactly where. And then we
can make an attempt to rescue Lanu.”
Rescue Lanu? Crain wondered, as
he stared at the crawling little light,
what he was to do then? It might be,
that if he saved Lanu’s life and throne,
Lanu would be grateful enough to
abondon the plan of looting Earth
of water. But Crain doubted it. From
what he had seen of Lanu, he doubted
that he could count much on his
spoiled and arrogant half-brother’s
gratitude. And even if Lanu were
willing to abandon the great plan, no
one else on Bara would be willing to
do so, once Dandor made the fateful
announcement that the way to Earth
was open.

  “I thought,” he said to Dandor,

“that you were going to announce at
the Drawing of the Lots that the way
to Chola is open.”

  “No, Krayn,” said the old man earn-
estly, “I plan for you to make that an-
nouncement tomorrow, in the temple.
Coming from you, the supposed Lanu,
just before the chosen ones pass to
their fate it will set the people wild
with joy and will make them all firm
supporters of Lanu.”

  Crain was dismayed. He didn’t want
to make that announcement that em-
bodied such a dire threat to Earth!

  “Why not wait until after we have
rescued Lanu?” he suggested.

  “We cannot afford to wait,” Dan-
dor said. “For should Surp learn from
Lanu that the great plan nears success,
Surp might announce it, to swing sup-
port to himself.”

  Crain dared not oppose the scien-
tist further, without the risk of arous-
ing Dandor’s suspicions. He must
keep Dandor convinced that he was
loyal to Bara.

  He would make the announcement,
Crain decided swiftly. But every mo-
ment he would be scheming and work-
ing to thwart the great plan.

  “But, Dandor,” he asked, this time
determined to get an answer, “what’s
going to happen to those chosen four
thousand families in the temple to-
morrow? You said they wouldn’t be
killed.”

  Into Dandor’s face came that quail-
ing horror, that shadow of icy dread,
that had been there before at that
question.

  “No, Krayn, they will not be killed,”
he said heavily. “But a dreadful fate
hangs like a sword over every person
on Bara, with the exception as I told
you, of the nobles and scientists.”

  “What fate?” Crain insisted tightly.

  Dandor’s black eyes were somber as
he looked at the younger man. “Krayn,
do you remember asking me about the
little things of floating light that are
everywhere on Bara—the Electrae?”

CRAIN nodded. They had puzzled
him ever since his coming to
Mars, those weird little firefly enti-
ties.

  “What about the Electrae?”
THE PRISONER OF MARS

49

  “The four thousand chosen ones and
their families,” Dandor answered
solemnly, “will tomorrow become
Electrae.”

  “What?” Crain exclaimed, shocked
to the depths of his soul. “You mean
that all those human beings will be
changed into those things of elec-
tricity or light?”

  “Only too terribly true, Krayn,”
Dandor admitted, sadly. “It has been
going on upon Bara for long years.
Everyone of the countless Electrae
you have seen, everyone of those drift-
ing and immaterial electric things,
was once a human being!”

  Philip Crain was appalled; unable
to credit the vista of horror that Dan-
dor’s words opened up.

  “It began,” Dandor was saying
somberly, “when we realized that our
drying, dying world could not support
all our numbers. Yet we could not put
some of our people to death to solve
the problem. That would be murder,
would plunge our world into riot and
war.

  "Then one of our scientists ad-
vanced a solution. They had concen-
trated upon atomic physics, the inner
structure of matter, hoping to find a
method of transmutation of elements
which would permit the synthesizing
of artificial food and water. Their
hope was shattered, for they learned
that transmutation on a large scale
would release uncontrollable atomic
energy which would destroy our
world. They had to give up that hope,
but they had learned much about
atomic structure.

  “They had learned that the elec-
trons and protons of which matter is
composed can be transformed into
non-material photons, or corpuscles of
radiation, by converting the electric
charge of the electron or proton into
an electric field. Even a living crea-
ture could be transformed thus into
photons.

  “A living creature so changed into
a photon cloud retained a certain life,
a certain consciousness, since the pat-
tern of his photons remained relative-
ly the same as his former electronic
pattern. Though now a mere cloud of
photons, those immaterial particles

retained the vital patterns of life and
mind. As immaterial electric clouds,
such changed beings could live eter-
nally, needing no food or air or any-
thing else. And could be translated
back into solid human beings at any
future time.

  “The scientists proposed that our
surplus population be changed into
such immortal and immaterial crea-
tures of electricity—the Electrae. As
Electrae, they would not be living as
we know life, yet neither would they
be dead, for they could always be
changed back into real people. They
would merely drift about our planet
eternally, and some day, when the
great plan to revivify Bara with new
water succeeded, the Electrae could
all be transformed back into human
beings.

  “Since then, thousands on tens of
thousands of Barans have become
Electrae. There are now millions of
the blind, dumb, shadow things float-
ing aimlessly about our world, living
out their deathless existence, waiting
for the hoped-for day when they may
again become human beings.

HE existence of the Electrae is
a hollow mockery. Their dim
consciousness is unable to see or hear
or feel anything, since as photon
clouds they have no sense organs.
They are sensitive to electrical ema-
nations of certain kinds, and can com-
municate dimly with each other by
means of impinging waves from their
own photon beings, but they can hold
no communication with any living be-
ing on Bara. They are mere ghosts,
floating, dancing, drifting in a blind
darkness in which they can feel noth-
ing, hear nothing, see nothing.

  “And that, Krayn, is why we people
of Bara have for so long hoped and
dreamed of getting water from Cholu.
That is why your father Tharkol
dared everything in the heroic at-
tempt to reach Cholu. Those millions
of lonely, bodiless Electrae who drift
forever around our world—we all have
friends, loved ones, among them,
whom we pray may some day be re-
leased from their horrible state.”

  “Good God!” Crain whispered. “All
50

STARTLING STORIES

those flickering things—once men and
women—”

  “Aye, the Electrae are the tragedy
of this world,” Dandor said solemnly,
searing pity and sadness in his eyes.
“Every Baran dreads each year that
he may be chosen in the Drawing of
the Lots, that he and his family may
be called upon to enter that dim state
of bodiless immortality.”

  Crain shuddered deeply as he
looked out of the window and saw,
even now, amid the sunlit towers of
the rosy city, vague flickers of light
drifting aimlessly to and fro.

  Immaterial electric things that had
been men! Cut off from all life, all
reality, floating through dim eons.

  “It was the process used in chang-
ing people into Electrae,” Dandor was
saying, “that we adapted to use in the
matter-casters. The matter-casters
make use of a differently tunsd force
but they, too, translate matter into a
photon cloud that is projected to an-
other matter-caster which re-trans-
forms it into solid state. Just as,
some day, all the Electrae may be re-
transformed.

  “And now,” he added, his tragic
eyes lighting with new hope, “the day
of the release of the Electrae cannot
be far off—now that you have helped
us open the way to Cholu and its
wateT. When Bara is revived and the
Electrae become men and women
again, they will bless your name,
Krayn!”

  Philip Crain shrank from the old
man’s fervent praise. He didn’t de-
serve it—he, who was working se-
cretly, not to achieve the great plan,
but tp thwart it.

  Crain felt himself caught in a tragic
and terrible dilemma. He must be
loyal to Earth, the world of his birth
and breeding! He couldn’t let the
Martians loot Earth of its water, and
make of Earth a devastated planet.

  Yet if loyal to Earth, if he succeed-
ed in thwarting the Martians, then he
was dooming the Electrae to remain
forever in their unthinkably horrible
state. Was sentencing men and wo-
men, whose blood flowed in his own
veins, to remain in that terrible im-
mortality forever I

       CHAPTER XI
       Princess of Bara

BEWILDERLY Crain psced to
and fro, distraught, his mind in
turmoil. He told himself fiercely that
he must not let sympathy for the
tragic Electrae distract him from his
purpose. He must fight for Earth!

  “See, the tracer has stopped!” Dan-
dor exclaimed, bending more closely
over the globe.

  Crain hurried back to his side.
Upon the glqbe, the tiny spark of the
tracer was stationary in the blank red
desert, far southeast of Ingomar.

  “I know that place!” Dandor said.
“There lies the ruined city L’Lon,
one of the many great cities when the
seas shrank, ages ago.”

  “Then Surp and his men are hold-
ing Lanu prisoner in the ruined city?”
“They must be,” Dandor affirmed.
“No one ever goes there, and Surp
must have some secret place there.”
The old scientist’s eyes narrowed in
thought. “We shali have to go alone
to rescue Lanu,” he said. “We dare
not take soldiers with us, for no one
must know of this impersonation of
yours. Somehow we must get Lanu
away, replace him on his throne with-
out anyone knowing what has taken
place. And it will be hazardous!”
Philip Crain said nothing. He was
trying to decide his own course of
action in the face of this situation.

  Lanu was his half-brother—yet if
he, himself, was killed trying to rescue
Lanu, it meant all chance of averting
the Martian onslaught on Earth would
be gone!

  Still, if he refused outright to at-
tempt a rescue of Lanu, Dandor would
at once begin to suspect him.

  Dandor postponed Cram’s decision.
“We must wait until after tomorrow
to attempt our rescue of Lanu,” he
declared. “For tomorrow is the Day
of Passing, when you must be in the
temple for the dreadful ceremony.
Only those of royal blood are allowed
to approach the altar which trans-
forms the chosen ones into Electrae.
THE PRISONER OF MARS

The scalpel stabbed

flesh of Crain’t body (Chapter XV)

. . . Tomorrow night we shall go to
ruined L’Lon.”

  Crain nodded, hoping that before
the next night he would have found
some way to strike for the cause of
Earth. He had formed a vague plan
that he hoped he might be able to put
into effect. If he could slip out of
this city with Kay, speed to Dandor’s
desert tower where the matter-caster
was, and flash back from it to Earth,
then they could destroy the matter-
caster on Earth, and end the threat.

  He felt a pang at the thought that
he would be cutting himself off for-
ever from this world that he was com-
ing somehow to love; this world of his
father’s kingship. And that he would
be sealing the doom of the tragic

hordes of Electrae, for all time.

 “You must go now to the king’s
apartments, Krayn,” Dandor was say-
ing. “It might cause wonder if you
remained in my rooms. I’ll go with
you, to be at your side should you
need my coaching.”

  “But Kay?" Crain asked anxiously.

DANDOR looked thoughtful. “The
girl is still loyal to Cholu, is she
not? I have guessed that from her
talk with you, though I cannot under-
stand that Choluan language.”

  “Yes, she is loyal to Cholu,” Crain
said slowly. “She thinks that I too
should remain loyal to that world."

 “As though the son of Tharkol
could own loyalty to any world but
STARTLING STORIES

Bara!” Dandor exclaimed unsuspi-
ciously. “The girl must be kept under
watch, Krayn. She might do or say
something that would betray you. We
shall take her with us to your royal
apartments, and Kro can guard her.”
And he added, “She must wear the
Baran cloak. We want no suspicion
of her identity.”

  But Kay refused to wear the cloak.
"I have not turned Martian, Philip,"
she said, her eyes hard and hostile.
“I won’t wear their clothes.”

  “Tell the girl that I can have Kro
wrap her in the cloak and carry her,”
Dandor said emphatically.

  The threat had its effect. Angrily
Kay wrapped the silken cloak around
her.

  The lift-cage took them down to the
ground floor of the palace. Chamber-
lains ushered Philip Crain toward the
apartment of the king. Guards out-
side its door raised their silver gas-
guns in salute to him as he entered.
Dandor, Kay and the clanking robot
followed him.

  The royal apartment was a series of
magnificent rooms. High-ceiled cham-
bers with walls of rosy stone, hung
with brilliant crimson silks upon
which were worked golden portraits.
All the furniture was of metal, for in
this world wood was a rarity. Upon
the floor were thick, soft, dark green
rugs.

  Tall windows admitted the sunlight.
It was sinking toward the horizon, for
hours had passed while they watched
the tracer. As shadows gathered lit-
tle flaring artificial suns automatically
glowed in the ceilings, waxing in
brightness as the daylight waned.

  "They are simply areas of the stone
ceilings,” Dandor answered Crain’s
question about the lights, “in which
an electric excitation of the atoms of
the stone itself is induced, causing
them to emanate light-waves.”

  He pointed to the golden portraits
that were worked into the crimson
hangings.

“Those are portraits of all the long-
dead kings of Bara,” he told Crain.
“All of them your ancestors, Krayn.”
Philip Crain could not restrain his
eager interest as he moved along the

walls, staring at those golden faces.
His ancestors! Kings of Bara whose
blood throbbed in his own veins!

  He uttered an exclamation when he
came to the last portrait. That great,
leonine head, that powerful face—
how well he knew them!

  “My father!” he exclaimed.

  Dandor nodded. “Yes, the great
king Tharkol, father of Lanu and
yourself. His portrait was added
when he was believed to have per-
ished. The old scientist stared sad-
ly into memory. “How many times
have I sat in this very room with
Tharkol, working for the furtherance
of the great plan! How I waited and
hoped for the word to come from him,
that never came!” His eyes bright-
ened. “But you finally called, and
came, Krayn—you, Tharkol’s son. It
is almost like having Tharkol himself
beside me again, for you have your
father’s strength and purpose as Lanu
has not. I wish that you were really
the king, Krayn."

THE simple, wistful words touched
Philip Crain, brought a lump to
his throat. Impulsively, he grasped
the old man’s hand.

  “No matter what comes,” he said,
“I’m glad that I’ve known you, Dan-
dor. My father’s friend—and mine.”
His conscience hurt him, for it was
his duty to thwart Dandor’s dearest
purpose, to wreck the old scientist’s
lifelong work and hope.

  A servant obsequiously entered the
softly-lit apartment, and bowed low
to Crain.

  “A message from the Princess
Mara, Highness,” he said. “She asks
you to dine with her tonight.”

  Philip Crain glanced inquiringly at
Dandor, who nodded imperceptibly.

  “Tell the Princess Mara that I’ll
come,” Crain said.

  When the servant had gone, Crain
turned to the old man, his lean face
worried and anxious.

  “I don’t like to meet that girl
again!” he exclaimed. “Dandor, I'm
afraid that she half suspects me.”
“She would suspect you even more,
if you did not come,” Dandor de-
clared. “Lanu was madly in love with
THE PRISONER OF MARS

53

her and spent most of his time with
her. More time than Mara cared for,
since she has never loved Lanu.”

  “Then why is she marrying him?”
Crain bluntly demanded.

  Dandor shrugged. “The king must
marry only the highest blood. And it
was felt that this marriage would
strengthen Lanu with the people,
against the plots of Surp.”

  “You’ll go with me?” Crain asked
anxiously.

  The old man shook his head em-
phatically. “I dare not, Krayn! It
would infallibly make Mara suspect
something, for Lanu would never
have me accompany him. You must
rely on your own wit to keep from be-
traying yourself. Keep to generali-
ties, and get away as soon as you can.”

  Kay watched Philip Crain with a
shadow of heartbreak in her bitter
eyes as he prepared to go though she
had understood nothing of the con-
versation that told where he was go-
ing. Yet when he spoke to her anx-
iously, she stared stonily past him.

   He felt oppressed by the girl’s atti-
tude as he started through the palace
behind two obsequious chamberlains.
Kay thought him a traitor to Earth—
and Dandor would think him a traitor
to Bara when the old man learned his
real purpose. And he would in some
sense be a traitor to Bara, to the Elec-
trae, if he succeed in doing what he
must do.

  The rose-walled corridors of the
great palace beamed with light. Serv-
ants and guards sprang to stiff atten-
tion, as Philip Crain's tall, crimson-
cloaked figure strode through the
halls.

  Men and women of the nobles
stepped to one side and bowed as he
passed. He inclined his head toward
them, without speaking.

  His chamberlains flung open two
wide silver doors and made loud an-
nouncement into the rooms beyond.

  “The King!”

  Crain stepped uncertainly forward.
This was an apartment in the east
wing of the palace, much like his own
except that the chambers were small-
er, the hangings daintier, the whole
place breathing a feminine atmosphere.

MARA was coming to meet him.
The Baran princess had dis-
carded the royal crimson and wore
both cloak and gown of white, a sin-
gle brilliant green jewel blazing in
her tightly-coiled blue-black hair.

  Her deep eyes clung steadily to his,
and there was an expression of queer
interest on her beautiful face as she
bowed slightly to him.

  “I am surprised that you came,
Lanu,” she said, a little mockingly. “I
have heard that there is a strangely
lovely girl in your apartments to-
night.”

  “How did you learn that?” Philip
Crain asked, startled.

  “Can anything remain secret long
in this gossip-ridden palace?” she
countered. “Who is she?”

  “A niece of Dandor’s,” Crain an-
swered with assumed indifference.
Then a devil in him made him ask;
“You’re not jealous, darling?”

  “Of course not,” Mara answered
with cool detachment. She nodded
toward a small metal table set beneath
soft lights. “Shall we dine now?”

  Crain was suddenly conscious of an
amazing hunger. He realized that he
had eaten but little for many hours.
And the Martian food was good.
There was no meat, but a half dozen
different vegetables had been blended
by skilful cookery into delicious fla-
vors.

  There were queer-tasting yellow
fruits, also, and a flagon of thick black
wine. The wine warmed him, and he
filled his glass again. He felt the
superhuman strain under which he
was laboring drop a little from his
shoulders.

  “You seem more interested in the
food than in me,” Mara said, studying
him. “You’ve changed, Lanu.”

  A warning note rang in Philip
Crain’s brain. But he looked at her
calmly over his wine-glass.

  “In what way?” he asked as they
rose.

  “In—many ways,” Mara’s black
brows knitted in puzzlement.

  Crain sensed that this girl’s half-
formed suspicions Were dangerous!

  “I haven’t changed in one way,
Mara,” he said, and deliberately took
54

STARTLING STORIES

her into his arms. Before she could
speak or move, Crain bent to her lips.
Hell, he’d prove to her that he was
Lanu!

   The lips of the Baran princess were
soft and sweet, her midnight hair
breathing fragrance into his nostrils,
her willowy body suddenly yielding.
A dizzying shock rocked Crain, and
he was trembling a little as he drew
his head back. And Mara was breath-
less.

  “Lanu, you never kissed me like
that before!” she exclaimed.

  He’d overdone it, then, Crain
thought dizzily. But he hadn’t been
able to help himself. Mara was still
inside the circle of his arm, her blue-
black eyes glowing with new light.

  Crain fought down the strong im-
pulse to repeat that kiss. Mara was
his half-brother’s fiancee! He must
play a part, but he mustn’t let himself
play it too well!

  They moved out of the room onto a
broad balcony. Standing there in the
darkness, his arm around Mara’s slim,
silken figure, Crain stared fascinat-
edly into the night-shrouded gardens
below.

BOTH of the two silver moons
were in the heavens, the farther
one shining high and remote in the
east, the nearer one visibly creeping
across the star-shot sky above the
southeastern horizon. Twin moons
whose shifting silver rays fell in un-
real beauty upon the soaring towers
of Ingomar, and upon the low, shrub-
like trees and massed flowers of the
gardens.

  The air, thin and cold but laden
with pungent scents, further waked in
Crain the haunting hereditary memo-
ries in his mind. For the moment, he
felt himself wholly of this world and
people, standing here with Mara close
beside him, looking out upon his
world, his city.

  Mara shivered slightly. And her
voice held brooding sadness.

  “Always, when we are most happy,
we must remember the doomed ones,
the Electrae,” she whispered.

   Sadly she gazed at the flitting hosts
 of beautiful, glowing things like fire-

flies, drifting through the gardens
and through the elfin towers of the
city around them. Drifting, dancing,
floating on in their eternity of dim
and unhuman consciousness. Men
and women once, and now those beau-
tiful, terrible things of drifting light.

  “They poison our happiness, al-
ways,” Mara was saying somberly.
She pressed closer against him, with
a shudder. “I cannot keep from
thinking of those thousands of the
chosen, who tonight know with sad
hearts that tomorrow in the temple
they must become Electrae.”

  “I know,” Philip Crain said heav-
ily. “I can’t forget them, either.”

  No, he could not forget them. For
he knew that on the morrow it would
be his own hand that would hurl those
chosen victims out of life into that
terrible immortality.

       CHAPTER XII
       The Day of Passing

THROUGH the brilliant noonday
sunshine of Ingomar, echoing in-
to every nook and cranny of the city’s
rosy towers, throbbed the slow and
heavy tolling of a great bell. Deep,
low notes, speaking out of a hoarse
iron throat to a city that dreaded its
summons.

  From every quarter of Ingomar,
people were streaming toward the
low, domed temple at the south end
of the great plaza. Philip Crain,
watching from the window of his
royal apartment could see the slow-
moving, silent throngs converging up-
on the temple. And they moved in a
dread and deathly silence.

   “It is time to go, Krayn,” said Dan-
 dor’s low voice. "The passing of the
 chosen must begin.”

   “Do I have to do this thing?” Philip
 Crain asked distractedly. "Change
 those people into the horrible Elec-
 trae?”

  “You must, yes,” Dandor said sadly.
“There is lack of food, even now. Un-
less those chosen go into the Electrae
today, many will starve tomorrow.”
THE PRISONER OF MARS

55

The old man’s eyes lighted a little
as he added, “Yet they will not be
Electrae for long! You shall tell
them today of the imminent success
of the great plaiv And once we have
rescued Lanu, it will not be long be-
fore our expedition goes to Cholu to
bring to us the water that will make
possible the release of all the pitiful
doomed.”

Crain’s wide shoulders sagged.
“All right—I’m ready,” he said heav-

ily- . ,

Kay stood at the window, gazing at

the crowds entering the temple. Crain

went to her side.

“You’ll be safe here with Kro,” he

said earnestly in English. “And Kay,

soon you and I may be able to get

back to Earth, and cut the connection

between worlds.”

She looked at him with no belief

in her white, set face. “You tell me

that, tell me you’re working for Earth,

while you sit on the very throne of

this world,” she said.

“Kay, you must believe me,” Crain

urged.

Her brown eyes flashed. “Why do
you stay here with me, when your
Martian princess is waiting?”

Crain had already told her who
Mara was, and that the princess was
affanced to the Baran king.

“Come, Krayn!” Dandor called im-
patiently.

Hopelessly, Philip Crain turned
and followed the old scientist. The
robot Kro, a motionless statue of
metal, still stood where he had
stopped the night before, his lens-
eyes fixedly watching the girl by the
window.

Crain and Dandor passed through
the rosy corridors of the palace to-
ward the south facade. And Dandor
was talking earnestly, lowering his
voice so that they could not be heard
by the half-dozen servants respect-
fully following them.

“Remember my instructions on
what you are to say and how you are
to operate the altar, Krayn,” the old
man said. “I cannot be beside you
when you do that, for only those of
royal blood may stand upon that spot.
If you forget, you are lost.”

  “I won’t forget,” Crain promised,
remembering the minute instructions
Dandor had given him that morning.

  “If you can continue your imper-
sonation unsuspected today,” Dandor
added eagerly, “we will have a chance
to rescue Lanu tonight, and end this
perilous situation.”

THEY emerged onto the stone ter-
race that fronted the palace.
Princess Mara and her ladies were
coming out of another entrance. Mara
again wore the royal crimson cloak.
Her face was pale with tragic antici-
pation, and her eyes were shadowed
as she greeted Philip Crain.

  Trumpets of guards upon the ter-
race blared as Crain and the princess
started with their small retinue to-
ward the temple. The shrinking hor-
ror that all day had possessed Crain
increased as they approached the mas-
sive arched entrance of the great
domed building.

  “Courage, Lanu,” whispered Mara,
clasping his hand. “This is the hard
duty of the kings of Bara.”

  The warm clasp of her fingers
strengthened him. “I’ll try to do—my
duty,” he muttered.

  A heavy company of guards was
posted outside the temple entrance.
They passed between the saluting sol-
diers. Then Crain halted, shaken,
staring into the place.

  The interior of the temple was a
single vast, shadowy hall. It was a
huge circular amphitheater, with
many tiers of stone seats rising steep-
ly from a large, round, black-paved
stage.

  At the center of this stage was the
altar. It was simply a disk of white
crystal set in the black stone floor.
Near it rose a standard of red metal
that bore six little wheels which were
the controls of the altar.

  Grouped around the outer part of
the great stage stood some thousands
of men, women and childen. All were
dressed in white, and the badge of
each man among them was glowing.
They were deathly silent.

  The chosen!

  In the rising tiers, the first rows
of seats were occupied by the bril-
56

STARTLING STORIES

liant nobles. The other tiers, far up
into the lofty shadows, were filled
with the people of Ingomar, leaning,
tense and spellbound, watching.

  And most horrible of all to Philip
Crain, through the shadowy interior
of the vast and silent temple, scores
of firefly things of light drifted aim-
lessly. Scores of Electrae, floating
here as everywhere, before the eyes of
the thousands who were soon to enter
that living death themselves.

  Crain felt his courage crumbling
like sand. He felt a wild desire to
flee from the coming horror.

  “Steady, Krayn!” whispered Dan-
dor tautly.

  “I can’t do this thing—I can’t!”
Crain muttered thickly, his lean face
pale as death.

  “You must!” the old scientist whis-
pered frantically. “Remember, these
victims will not be Electrae long—
soon the great plan will make possible
their release.”

  His words were no comfort to
Crain, for he knew that if he were
successful in his own intentions, that
plan would never be achieved, the
Electrae never released.

  “See—Surp and Ligor approach!”
Dandor whispered. “You must not
show weakness now!”

  The massive Surp and his handsome
son were coming along the aisle to-
ward the royal party. Crain stiffened.
Surp must know, now, that he was an
impostor, that the real Lanu was still
their captive. What would the no-
ble do?

  Secret satisfaction was written
plain on Surp’s hard, brutal face. His
shrewd eyes had a glint of ironical
mirth in them as he bowed with exag-
erated respect to Crain.

 GREETINGS, Highness!” he
said loudly. “You tarry long
here. It is almost as though you had
never seen the temple before.”

  “Yes,” drawled Ligor insolently,
amusement in his drooping eyes as he
watched Crain, “a man from another
world could not be more amazed than
you seem—Highness.”

  They knewl They had learned
from Lanu that he was from Earth,

and were taunting him with their
knowledge. Mara and the others
stared, astounded by their effrontery.

  Crain’s lean face hardened, as his
anger rose white-hot. For a moment,
he felt all Martian, all king. These
two upstarts, daring such words to
him!

  “You forget yourself, Surp,” he
said stingingly. “You and this inso-
lent cub of yours should be in your
seats, like my other nobles. Must I
have guards escort you there?”

  Surp went purple with rage. “You
dare talk so to me?” he cried. “You,
a mere—”

  He checked the raging words on his
lips. Checked them, Crain knew, be-
cause accusation of Crain as an im-
postor would be accusation of himself
as kidnaper of the king.

  Bursting with baffled rage, Surp
glared. And Ligor, all his drawling
insolence dissolved in fury, was show-
ing his teeth like a maddened panther.

  “To your se3ts!” Crain commanded
roughly. “You are delaying the cere-
mony.”

  Surp controlled himself with a
great effort.

  “Very well, Highness,” he grated,
making the title of respect sound like
a curse.

  There was deadly menace and mal-
ice in the noble’s hard face, and in the
raging eyes of Ligor, as the two went
down to take their places with the
other nobles.

  “Lanu, it seemed to me that Surp
and Ligor were threatening you
openly!” exclaimed Mara anxiously.

  “They are too insolent, that is all,”
Crain answered, though he was still
tense from that deadly clash.

  “Be careful, Lanu,” pleaded the
princess, her dark eyes deeply wor-
ried. “You know how much Surp
wants your throne, and how much Li-
gor wants—me.”

  Crain started. So Ligor was in love
with Mara? He might have guessed
it, from the eager way in which Ligor
had hung about her before the Draw-
ing of the Lots.

  “I wish I knew what devil’s web
Surp is weaving,” Dandor was whis-
pering forebodingly. “He’s got some-
THE PRISONER OF MARS

57

thing planned, now that he knows the
truth about you.”

  Crain moved down the steps toward
the great central stage. As he reached
its edge, the nobles behind him
stopped, forbidden to go further.
Only royalty could stand on that
stage, Dandor had said—only royalty,
and the chosen victims. Crain and
Mara, their royal crimson cloaks
gleaming brilliantly under the hood-
ed lights, walked slowly across the
stage toward the altar.

  Crain took his place by the red
metal standard that rose near the crys-
tal disk of the altar. Mara stood near
him, her dark head erect and her beau-
tiful face white.

AND the whole great temple was
silent. Silent! The stillness of
death had invaded the vast, shadowy
fane. No one spoke, no one moved.
Only the drifting, glowing Electrae
wandered aimlessly through the semi-
dusk.

  Philip Crain felt a slow, cold chill
of deeper horror invade him as he
looked at the great crowd of victims
that stood near him on the stage. If
they had been weeping, protesting,
raging, it wOuld not have been so bad,
he felt.

  But they were utterly still and si-
lent. Men, women and children, their
faces a white blur in the shadows,
watching him with dull, apathetic
hopelessness. A little child among
the doomed ones whispered, and its
mother soothed it. And the tide of
awful silence rushed back over every-

thing.

  Philip Crain started to speak the
words that Dandor had taught him.
They came, thick and hoarse.

  “You who must now pass into the
Electrae,” he said to the white-faced
band, “must not feel that you are
doomed to stay everlastingly in that
state. No, when our world is revived
by new water, then will you and all
the rest of the Electrae be trans-
formed, by this very altar, back into
living men and women. Let that
thought comfort you now as you pass
out of life. And be comforted also by
the knowledge that you are saving the
rest of our race, by leaving us. And
in a day to come, when our world is
again green and fertile, when you
Electrae are made living men once
more, all our world will be grateful
to you for this that you now do.”

  Crain ended the speech. The ritual
speech that the kings of Bara had
spoken for many years to the doomed.

  The doomed ones were still silent.
Still watching him with that dull,
apathetic stare that made Philip Crain
shiver to the soul, by its icy, utter
hopelessness.

  And then, breaking the accustomed
ritual, Crain made the announcement
that Dandor had said he must make.

  “And the time when all the Electrae
will be released comes soon!” he de-
clared. “Yes, my people, the great
plan that has been the dream of all
Bara for ages shall soon be achieved.
The road to Cholu is now open, at
last! At this very moment, a matter-

[Turn Page]
58

STARTLING STORIES

caster is ready upon Cholu for us to
use. Soon our expedition will flash
across the void, to set up on Cholu the
matter-casters that will hurl water
from that world to Bara. Soon Bara
will once more be a world of great
seas and fertile lands, and then at last
all the millions of the Electrae shall
pass through this altar, and become
once more living men and women!”

 For a long moment, there was a
dead frozen silence in the great tem-
ple, a silence of stupefaction. And
then, from every throat in the vast
fane, there ripped a colossal, deafen-
ing shout of frantic joy, a mighty cry
that beat upon Philip Crain with stun-
ning force.

  “King Lanu!” yelled those thou-
sands of frenzied voices. “King Lanu,
our liberator!”

 Mara was clutching wildly at
Crain’s arm.

  “Is it true, Lanu?” she cried over
that deafening, joy-mad uproar. “Is
it true?”

  “It’s true, Mara,” he said. “Dandor
and I have opened the road to Cholu.”

TEARS shone in her dark eyes,
bright tears of gladness.

  “Our people—the Electrae—saved!”
she choked.

  Still the joy-mad, frantic uproar of
shouts beat wildly down upon Crain.

 “Lanu! Lanu!” the people were
crying hoarsely. And the doomed
ones, who a moment before had been
apathetic with dead hopelessness,
were shouting loudest in their fren-
zied joy.

  And Philip Crain felt—increased
horror. For he knew that if he suc-
ceeded in what he meant to do, all
these wildly rejoicing people were
doomed to agonizing disappointment.

 He must himself destroy their
dream, whose promised fulfillment had
sei them mad with gladness! He,
whom they were wildly hailing now as
their savior, must be the one to shatter
their frenzied hope!

  Tortured by that knowledge, unable
to bear more of their frantic acclaim,
he raised his hand for silence.

  “Soon,” he repeated, “the great plan
will be achieved, and then all the Elec-

trae will be released. But now these
of the chosen must pass into the Elec-
trae, since we will need all the re-
sources of our dying world for the
expedition to Cholu.”

  A big man among the chosen, his
face flaming with joy, shouted in an-
swer: “We go gladly now into the
Electrae, Highness! Yes, now that
we know we are soon to be released,
we do not flinch from the altar!”

 “Aye, King Lanu!” chorused the
doomed men and women around him,
faces shining. “We know that soon
you will release us all.”

  Philip Crain shuddered. This glad
trust in him was almost unbearable.

  “Your trust in me will be fulfilled,"
he said hoarsely, hating himself for
the lie. “Now let the ceremony
begin.”

  He reached to the little wheels
mounted on the red metal standard be-
fore him. He turned them, setting
each at a certain position, as Dandor
had carefully instructed.

  As he set the last wheel, the crystal
disk of the altar blazed suddenly with
violent purple light. An upward-
shooting shaft of deep violet bril-
liance that cast a quivering glow over
the faces of all in the temple.

  “The altar is ready,” said Crain, his
voice thick and unsteady. “Pass into
it in the order established among
you.”

  The doomed ones began to move in
a single file toward the blazing purple
shaft. Men, and women with babies
in arms, toddling children, advancing
to the altar.

  As the first man reached it, he
paused and looked toward Crain, his
quivering face shining with gladness.

  “Bless you, King Lanu, for giving
us promise of early release before we
enter the altar!” he cried.

  And then he stepped into the blaz-
ing shaft of purple force. Instantly
his body’s outlines wavered, were
misty, were gone from sight. He
vanished—and out of the blazing
shaft drifted a thing of glowing light.

  An Electrae—that had been that liv-
ing man! Drifting aimlessly away
now with the other Electrae in the
shadowy temple.
THE PRISONER OF MARS

59

CRAIN found himself shaking with
horror as he witnessed that in-
credible and awful transformation.
And his horror increased, as one by
one, in single file, the rest of the
doomed marched into the purple shaft
of the altar.

  For as they entered the deadly
force, the faces of them all were
turned toward him with beaming trust
and joy, and they were crying out
their blessing on him. Blessing him,
who meant to shatter their joyful
hopes! Blessing him, with their last
words, as they entered the living
death!

  Dozens, scores, hundreds of them
were passing thus into the altar. Each
of them, as they entered the brilliant
purple shaft, disappeared almost in-
stantly—changing into one of the fire-

men once more.”

  Again the terrific clamor of acclaim
crashed down upon him. To Crain’s
self-tormented soul, it was like the
howling of mocking demons.

  All the way back across the plaza to
the palace, the throng that had poured
out of the temple were shouting in
hoarse acclaim, hailing Crain. Guards
struggled to hold them back.

  When Crain and Dandor and Mara
entered the palace, the princess looked
up at Crain, her dark eyes tear-misted.

 “Lanu, you and Dandor will be
blessed by every soul that is ever
born on Bara!” she said, a throb in
her voice. “For opening the road to
Cholu’s water, for renewing our
world and freeing the Electras.”

  Her warm arms went impulsively
around his neck, her eyes were

fly things that floated off into the
shadows.

  Electrae were thick now in the great
temple, horde? of them drifting about.
Electrae that moments before had
been men! With wild eyes, Philip
Crain watched the last of the trustful,
joyful victims pass into the altar, saw
those last ones float off as immaterial
electric things.

  Then, his hand shaking, he reached
and turned the little wheels. The
blaze of the altar died.

 “The ceremony is ended,” he said
hoarsely, and continued as Dandor
had instructed him. “And it will be
the last ceremony of its kind ever to
take place here. No more of Bara’s
children shall pass into the Electrae.
And soon all the Electrae shall pass
back through this altar, to be living

shining as she raised her face to his.

  “I did not think that I could ever
love you, Lanu,” she whispered. “But
last night—I learned differently. And
now I know that you are worthy of
my new-found love.”

  Even in his torment of soul, a thrill
shot through Crain. It was he who
had won her love, not Lanu! He
kissed her hungrily. She clung to
him, till Dandor began to cough warn-
ingly.

  She stepped back, then, her face
glowing. “Tonight,” she whispered,
and was gone. Crain stared shakenly
after her until Dandor’s voice broke
the spell.

ctlz RAYN, you are not falling in
mm love with Mara?” the old man
asked, worry in his tones. “She is
60

STARTLING STORIES

your brother's fiancee, remember.”

  "I know,” Crain said hoarsely, then
suddenly cried: "I wish to God I'd
never entered this crazy imposture!”
“You were magnificnt in the tem-
ple," Dandor approved. “The people
worship you as their savior. Now if we
can rescue Lanu and get him back onto
the throne, no plot of Surp’s will ever
be able to shake his popularity.” The
old scientist’s face clouded as he
added, “Surp and Ligor left the tem-
ple before the ceremony ended. I
wonder why?”

 “To hell with Surp!” Crain ex-
claimed in abandon, startling Dandor.

  When they entered the royal apart-
ments, the old scientist uttered a sharp
cry.

  “Something has happened to Kro!”
The huge robot lay unmoving on
the floor. Nearby, a small, unfamiliar
triangular mechanism was buzzing.

 “Someone’s been here!” Dandor
cried in alarm. “That little mechan-
ism—they overpowered Kro with it
somehow!”

  “Where’s Kay?” cried Crain.

  He dashed through the rooms. He
came back, his face dead white.

  “She’s gone, Dandor! She’s been
kidnaped, like the king!”

       CHAPTER XIII
       In Ruined L’Lon

STUNNED by this new blow,
Philip Crain’s lean, dark face
was suddenly haggard with anxiety.
Kay gone, kidnaped!

  “Surp is behind this!” Dandor was
shouting. The old scientist’s black
eyes were flaming.

  “But why in God’s name would Surp
want to kidnap Kay?” Crain cried.

  Dandor did not answer at once. He
was bending over the small triangular
mechanism that buzzed steadily on
the floor. With deft, skilled hands, he
began dissembling the buzzing little
machine.

 “As I thought!” he exclaimed.
“This mechanism emits a field of force
which dampens and neutralizes the

electric nerve-currents of Kro’s body.
Kro’s brain and nervous system are
electrical, you see, Krayn. His artifi-
cial brain is a complex of metal neu-
rones which controls the photo-elec-
tric power that animates his body.
And the field of this little mechanism
effectively dampens his electric men-
tal currents.”

  Dandor paused suddenly in his dis-
sembling of the little machine, and
looked up, his wrinkled face startled.

  “But who upon Bara could have de-
vised a super-cunning mechanism like
this?” he muttered in perplexity.
“There is no Baran scientist except
myself, in these decadent days, who
could have done it. Is it possible that
there is some great Baran scientist of
whom I do not know, who is working
for Surp?”

  As Dandor completed dissembling
the little mechanism, its buzzing
stopped. Instantly, Kro rose to his
feet.

  “Ligor and some of Surp’s men did
this,” the robot declared. “I saw them
enter—then I knew nothing.”

 “Why would Surp kidnap Kay?”
Crain cried again. “How did he even
know of her existence?”

  “He must have learned from Lanu
that a girl came with you from Cholu,”
Dandor muttered thoughtfully. His
eyes flashed. “I begin to see now!
Surp holds Lanu, but while you fill
Lanu’s place, Surp cannot seize
power. So, guessing that this Choluan
girl is dear to you, Surp has seized
her so as to have a hold on you. He
will doubtless threaten to kill the girl
unless you do as he wishes.”

  Crain was appalled, haggard and
pale with anxiety. Kay, little Kay, in
black danger—and it was he who had
unwittingly brought her into this
peril.

  “I’m going to L’Lon,” he said, his
face set. “Surp will have Kay there,
with Lanu.”

  “She will be there with Lanu, yes,”
Dandor agreed. “And we will have
the advantage of surprise, for Surp
cannot guess that we know where his
secret stronghold is.”

  “I will go there alone, Dandor,”
Crain declared. “One man can do as
THE PRISONER OF MARS

61

much as two. And you must stay
here, so that if Surp tries to seize the
throne, there’ll be someone to prevent
it.”

  Crain was thinking desperately that
if he could get Kay out of that hell-
nest in L’Lon, he would speed with
her to Dandor’s desert tower and use
the matter-caster to flash back to
Earth. Once there he could see to it
that Earth and its coveted water was
safe forever.

  He forced from his mind remem-
brance of the pitiful Electrae, those
tragic hordes of drifting electric
ghosts who had been men. He must
think of Earth, he told himself
fiercely. That was why he did not
want Dandor with him, for the old
scientist would oppose his plan with
all his might.

OU are right, Krayn,” Dandor
said worriedly. “I must remain
here to ward off any coup that Surp
might attempt in your absence. But
Kro shall go with you.”

  Crain made no objection to that. He
felt that he could get rid of the robot
without difficulty, when necessary.

  The sun was setting. The old man
sent Kro out to make ready a Worm,
while Crain hastily changed into a
metal tunic and helmet like those of
the Baran soldiery, flinging the crim-
son cloak over them.

  Dandor gave him a gas-gun, and a
tiny watchlike mechanism whose use
the old scientist explained.

  “You must go secretly, by the win-
dow,” Dandor said. “Surp’s spies
must be watching your movements.”
His voice broke a little. “And my
hopes go with you, Krayn. If you
and Kro save Lanu tonight, you save
the throne of your fathers, the new
Bara that is to be, from Surp.”
“Goodby, Dandor,” Crain said
hoarsely. “If we don’t meet again,
try to remember me as a friend.”

  He dropped from the window into
the darkness. Silently he moved along
the shadow of the vast palace wall to
the rear courts.

  The chill of the Martian night was
nipping. To his left, the west gardens
lay dark and silent, drifting Electrae

moving through trees and flowers like
wandering stars. Kabu, the nearer
moon, was hurtling up into the south-
western heavens.

  Crain glanced back at the vast pile
of the palace, its twin spires looming
against the fretted stars. Palace of
his fathers, that he was looking on for
the last time! He saw the glowing
windows of the east wing, and felt
sick heartache at the thought of Mara
waiting there for him. Never to see
her again, never again to hold her in
his arm—

  He forced that thought from his
mind. Kay’s safety, and the safety of
Earth, depended on him.

  In an outer court a great Worm
glistened in the moonlight. He
climbed in and found Kro already at
the controls.

  “Start at once,” Crain ordered. “For
L’Lon.”

  The streets of Ingomar were flaring
with light, crowded with rejoicing
people tonight, as the Worm glided
rapidly through the city.

  “Hail King Lanu, savior of Bara!”
hundreds of voices were shouting in
jubilant excitement. “Lanu!”

  Crain felt his heartsickness deepen.
These people, little dreaming at this
moment that he was leaving Ingomar
with the ultimate objective of shatter-
ing their age-old dream, by cutting
them off from Earth and its water for-
ever—

  The dim expanse of the desert
stretched before them as they passed
out of the city. It was a dreamlike
vista under the nearer moon, with
scattered Electrae wandering above it.
Kro opened up the power, and the
Worm shot like a great rushing snake
over the vague sands.

  Crain leaned toward his unhuman
metal companion.

  “Teach me how the Worm is driven,
Kro,” he commanded. He had sud-
denly remembered that he would need
to know that if he and Kay were to get
to Dandor’s tower later.

  Kro instructed him. Crain found
the controls of the Worm simplicity
itself—one lever that controlled the
direction of its movement, another
that controlled its speed through the
' — ~ ,r	T

STARTLING STORIES

power-plant, and a third lever that
could cause the Worm to rear its front
half erect into the air like a cobra, for
purposes of observation or to pass
over obstacles.

TWO hours passed, as man and
robot sped southeastward in the
machine. Kabu, changing phase with
bewildering rapidity as it hurtled
across the sky, was already sinking
eastward. And Noru, the farther,
smaller moon, was rising slowly to re-
place it.

  Far ahead, against the bright silver
shield of setting Kabu, stood out a
cluster of tiny black towers.

  “L’Lon!” breathed Crain, his body
tensing. “Go slowly now, Kro, and
try to keep out of sight.”

  Like a hunting serpent, the Worm
crept toward the distant towers. The
robot kept it as much as possible
under the shadow of sandy ridges and
dunes, out of the moonlight.

  “Stop here,” Crain ordered finally.
“We’ll go ahead on foot.”

  Leaving the Worm in the shadow of
a tall ridge, he and Kro emerged.
They moved cautiously up to the ridge
and crouched there a moment, survey-
ing the ruined city.

  L’Lon lay black and lonely beneath
the silver moons. Far to east and west
stretched the unlighted mass of its
crumbling towers and streets, perched
upon the edge of a great depression
in the desert that had once been a deep
sea. Time had shattered its proud
towers, choked its streets with fallen
masonry, made dust of those who once
had walked its busy ways.

  The spell of the solemn, ruined city
clutched at Philip Crain’s heart. For
through the shattered towers and
black streets moved the drifting stars
of many Electrae, floating aimlessly.
It was like an epitome of the tragedy
of Mars, this dead metropolis of long
ago that now was peopled only by the
electric phantoms.

  He drew from his pocket the little
watchlike instrument Dandor had
given him. It was a tiny direction-
finder, super-sensitive to electro-
magnetic emanations. If the tracer
that Dandor had put in Surp’s worm

were still there, this finder would lead
him straight to Surp’s hidden strong-
hold.

  A tiny arrow of light glowed on the
transparent face of the finder as he
touched its stem. A little shining ar-
row that pointed into the left section
of the abandoned city.

  “This way, Kro,” whispered Crain,
rising.

  Kro’s metal body gleamed like silver
underneath the moons as he moved
with Crain through the ruined city.

  “Keep in the shadows,” Crain
whispered.

  They clambered over piles of fallen
stone, broken pillars and columns,
corroded metal wrecks, following the
finder’s shining arrow. Then a square,
black castlelike structure that still
seemed in fair preservation bulked
darkly ahead. And the shining arrow
of the finder pointed straight toward
it.

  “Surp’s stronghold!” Crain whis-
pered excitedly. “And it’ll be
guarded.”

  He drew his gas-gun, clutching the
silvery tube by its trigger end. Then
he and Kro moved on toward the
brooding, lightless castle.

  Studying it from behind a nearby
ruin, Crain could see no guards at its
entrances. He decided that Surp was
so sure of the secrecy of his strong-
hold that he had been negligent. That
made things easier.

  More boldly, Philip Crain moved
toward the building. Gas-gun ready
to fire, he approached its open, dark
arched entrance. He and Kro entered
a dust-covered, broad stone corridor,
dark except for the floating glow of a
few Electrae.

KRO stopped suddenly. “I sense
someone here,” the robot said in
metallic whisper.

  “Men?” asked Crain anxiously.

  “No, not men,” answered the robot.
“I cannot sense men. This is someone
electrical, like myself. I cannot under-
stand it.”

  “We mustn’t dally here,” Crain said
tautly. “Come on.”

  Something big and vaguely gleam-
ing showed in the darkness ahead. It
THE PRISONER OF MARS

63

proved to be three Worms, parked in
a court. In one of them, Crain knew,
must be the tracer that had guided
him hither.

  “See—tracks in the dust!” Kro was
whispering. “They lead down those
stairs.”

  The stairs descended into an utter
darkness. But Kro’s lens-eyes were
capable of seeing by infra-red light.
He led the way, his metal feet sound-
less now. In the maze of dark corri-
dors they groped forward.

  “Here are tracks of the girl’s feet,”
Kro murmured. “This way.”

  His left hand touching the robot’s
cold metal side, Crain went forward.
He could see and hear nothing. His
heart was beginning to pound.

  Kro stopped. Crain felt a closed
door.

  “She is in here,” the robot whis-
pered. “I hear her breathing.”

  Crain could not hear. But he had
faith in the robot’s super-sensitive
senses.

  “Kay!” he whispered frantically.

  A sudden stir beyond the door came
to his ears. Then a choking voice.

  “Philip J”

  He tried the door. It was locked.

  “Kro, try to open it," he said tautly,
then whispered again to the girl: “Be
quiet, Kay. We’ll have you out in a
moment.”

  “Philip, to think I doubted you!” he
heard her sobbing. “I thought you
had turned Martian, had forgotten
Earth and me!”

  “Listen!” Kro whispered suddenly.

  Crain heard a dim rustling sound in
the darkness, strangely blood-chilling.
Something cold touched his leg.

  He reached down in the darkness.
His fingers felt the thing as a long,
thick rope of flexible metal. It was
moving of its own accord, was wrap-
ping itself swiftly around his legs.
And others were gliding up like metal
pythons to encircle his arms.

  Uttering a choking cry of horror
Crain sought to free himself from
those weirdly living, tightening metal
ropes. He heard Kro struggling furi-
ously against similar things. And
more and more of them were coiling
around the two.

  Crushed by those tightening
strands, Crain could not move a
muscle. The gas-gun had been
squeezed out of his hand. He fell
helplessly, and heard Kro's great
metal body crash to the floor beside
him.

  Lights blazed suddenly around
them. And Crain, lying hopelessly
bound by those metal ropes that still
sought to tighten on him, glimpsed
Kro lying near him, similarly bound,
making herculean efforts to break his
bonds.

  “Caught!” cried Crain. “It was a
trap!”

  A mocking laugh fell upon his ears.
Ligor and a half-dozen armed men
were approaching along the corridor.
The handsome young noble stood,
hands on hips, looking down at Crain
with triumph * in his heavy-lidded
eyes.

^^LTES, it was a trap, Sir Impos-
JL tor.” Ligor laughed taunt-
ingly. “And you walked right into it.
The Brain said that you would, and it
was right, as always.”

  The Brain? Where, Crain swiftly
wondered, had he heard that strange
name before?

  He was feeling the bitterness of
death. Not for himself, for death
might almost be welcome, since it
would solve for him the problem of
loyalty to two conflicting worlds that
had tormented him. But Kay—Kay
helpless here—

  “Pick him up and bring him along
to my father,” Ligor ordered his men.
“Put the robot in one of the cells. The
Tighteners will hold him.”

  Crain felt himself lifted roughly
and carried along the lighted corridor.
He heard Kay cry frantically.

  He was taken through several dusty
corridors and chambers, Ligor strid-
ing ahead. They emerged into a large
octagonal stone hall, blazing with
lights.

  There were more men here—Surp’s
guards at the door, and a dozen other
pale men dressed in cowled gray robes,
busy at unfamiliar mechanisms and
apparatus that crowded the hall. On a
platform at one end of the hall, stood
64

STARTLING STORIES

what Crain at first glance took to be a
huge, complex machine. In front of it,
Surp’s green-cloaked, massive figure
waited.

  “So the Tighteners snared our man,
Ligor?” Surp said, his hard face light-
ing with grim pleasure.

  “Easily.” Ligor laughed carelessly.
“The people of Cholu can't be very
clever, if this half-breed is an example.
He walked right into the castle.”

  A deep, hollow and booming voice
spoke from behind Surp.

  “Bring the Choluan closer,” it com-
manded flatly.

  Crain felt a chill of amazement.
That boomng voice had come from the
huge machine behind Surp!

 Now he saw, in the front of
that machine, five glowing disks,
mounted on flexible stalks. They had
turned toward Crain, like watching
eyes. And from a large diaphragm
beneath those quintuple glowing eyes
had come the booming voice.

 “Do as the Brain commands!”
snapped Surp.

 The Brain? Hearing that name
again, Crain suddenly remembered
what Dandor had told him of a super-
robot, a tremendous thinking-machine
that had been constructed long ago
and then destroyed because it had
grown too crafty.

  Was this it—this vast and complex
mechanism that loomed behind Surp?
This mighty machine that seemed liv-
ing, thinking, watching him?

      CHAPTER XIV
      Cunning of the Brain

RIGID, his bound form held help-
lessly erect by the guards,
Philip Crain stared at that vast, enig-
matic thing.

  “The Brain?” he whispered. “The
thinking^machine Dandor told me of?
But that was destroyed, he said.”
Surp laughed with hard complacent
satisfaction.

  “No, not destroyed,” the nolle said.
“The Brain was too valuable to be
destroyed. When the destruction of

the robots was carried out, I substitut-
ed a lifeless dummy mechanism for
the Brain, and brought the real Brain
here. It has lived here, my ally, ever
since.”

  “Yes,” spoke the booming, unhuman
voice from the diaphragm. “I have
helped you much, Surp. Never would
you have climbed within reach of the
throne, but for my craft to aid you.”

 “I have kept my part of the bar-
gain.” Surp shrugged, facing the five
glowing eyes of the machine. “I have
given you the leisure and facilities for
experiment you desired, have given
you these servitors. You agreed that
facilities for experiment were all you
wanted.”

 “That is all that is desirable,”
boomed the Brain. “Only stupid hu-
mans plot and sweat for silly power
over each other. A pure, immortal
intellect like myself has no desire for
power, but only for truth.”

  Sweat stood out on Crain’s brow as
he stared at the colossal, incredible
entity that was speaking. Dazed, his
eyes were taking in its details.

  The core of the Brain appeared to
be a great ovoid mass shielded by a
strong metal cover. Crain guessed
that it consisted of a complex of
metal-neurones like Kro’s brain, but
one infinitely more complicated, pos-
sessed of potential intellectual capa-
city and memory beyond those attri-
butes in any human.

  Upon this ovoid core played strong
white light or force from four tilted
projectors, a soothing spray of vibra-
tions. Heavy cables led upward
through the ceiling to some hidden re-
ceiver of photo-electric power. And
around this central scheme of ovoid
and projectors and cables rose the in-
t r i c a t e metal body of the Brain
—a network of girders and joints
from which projected a full dozen
powerful, jointed arms, some ending
in claws, others in fingers, still others
in various tools and scientific instru-
ments.

  All of these arms were now working
skillfully upon the assembling of a
large hemispherical machine. The
enormous mental capacity of the
Brain was evidenced by the fact that
THE PRISONER OF MARS

65

even while it was talking, its many
arms were busy upon this task.

  It could do several things at one
time, as easily as a human genius
could play a number of chess-games
at once. And Crain now perceived
that of its quintuple glowing eyes, one
appeared to be telescopic, another
spectroscopic, still another a micro-
scope, and the remaining two de-
signed for ordinary stereoscopic
vision.

  “It was the Brain. Choluan,” Surp
was saying mockingly, “that devised
the little trap you have been caught
in. The Brain, when it heard our
problem, advised that we steal the
Choluan girl Lanu had told us of, and
that you would come here to save her.
We knew you would know where to
come, for the Brain had detected the
presence of that tracer Dandor put in
my Worm.”

CRAIN was stunned, overwhelmed.
Was any human ingenuity of
avail against that monstrous metal
mind?

 “And now we have you!” Surp’s
voice flared triumphant. “Now the
way is clear for me to return to Ingo-
mar and seize the throne. It is I, not
Tharkol's spawn, who will lead the
forces of Bara to Cholu by the road
that is now open. It is I who will
procure from Cholu the water that
will make Bara green and great
again!”

 “You’re not on the throne yet,
Surp,” he spat hotly. “The people are
still to be heard from.”

  “The people?” Surp repeated, smil-
ing confidently. “Why, Choluan, the
people will flock to my standard when
I tell them that Lanu has been acci-
dentally killed. The dear people will
follow anyone who would bring new
water to Bara, so that the Electrae
can be released.”

 He laughed uproariously. “As
though I would ever release the Elec-
trae! But they'll think that I will.”

  Crain stared at the massive noble’s
brutally triumphant face, in new
horror.

  “You mean,” Crain cried unbeliev-
ingly, “that even if Bara is revived,

you wouldn’t release the Electrae?”
“Of course I wouldn’t," Surp de-
clared. “Why, man, the Electrae are
full of my enemies! For years and
years, I’ve seen to it that the people
who supported Tharkol's house, the
people who hated me, were chosen to
be Electrae, and that none of my sup-
porters were chosen. That’s why my
popularity has increased. I let it be
whispered that Surp’s supporters
were never chosen.”

  “I don’t believe you!” Crain ex-
claimed. “You could never devise any
way to tamper with the Drawing of
the Lots, to achieve such a fraud.”
Surp grinned. “I couldn’t devise a
way. no,” he admitted. “But the Brain
could, and did. A cunning apparatus
that interferes with the secret wave-
lengths of the little balls used in the
Drawing, so that no matter what balls
are cast into the sphere of the chosen,
it is the badges of my enemies that
glow forth. That’s how, for years,
I’ve filled the Electrae with my
enemies, and that’s why the Electrae
will never be released if I have any-
thing to do with it.”

  Crain felt a sick horror worse than
any he had yet experienced. This
disclosure by Surp of the monstrous
fraud in the Drawing of the Lots, the
open avowal of the noble that he
meant to betray the Electrae, chilled
Crain’s blood.

  He saw now the dreadful future in
store for both Earth and Mars. For
Earth, the looting of its water, the
making of it into a desert world. And
for Mars, the revival of the planet but
with the rule of Surp fastened in iron
tyranny upon it, and the Electrae
doomed to remain forever unfreed.

  Crain shook to a rage that was like
a white flame inside. He tried madly
to break his bonds.

  “Work away, Sir Impostor,” drawl-
ed Ligor with indolent amusement.
"You'll never break the Tighteners.”
“Ligor, we go now to Ingomar,”
Surp said, his shrewd eyes flashing.
“Neither Lanu nor this impostor half-
brother of his now sits on the throne
of Bara. Now we strike!" He
turned to the guards. “You will do
with this Choluan impostor as the
66

STARTLING STORIES

Brain directs. Our metal friend is
anxious to learn more about Choluan
physiology.”

PHILIP CRAIN understood. He
was to be given to that merciless
metal intellect as a subject for experi-
ment. But in his rage, he could not
now feel concern over his own fate.

  “Wait, Surp!” boomed the hollow
voice of the Brain. ‘‘You have for-
gotten Dandor.”

  “Dandor?” Surp exclaimed, turned
to his son. “Was Dandor not with
this Choluan and the robot?”

  Ligor shook his head. “No, Father.”
Surp cursed. “That old fox of a
scientist—too wary to come into our
trap!”

 “Dandor knows you hold Lanu
here,” the Brain reminded him. “If
you try to take the throne now, Dan-
dor will rouse the people with the
story of your kidnaping of Lanu, and
in spite of your many supporters, the
issue may go against you.”

  Surp glared in baffled anger. “It is
true!” he said tightly. “If Dandor
cries to the people that I abducted
Lanu, the populace will turn against
us.”

  “Let us take the chance anyway,”
Ligor exclaimed. He was unafraid.

  But his father turned back toward
the watching, glowing eyes of the
massive machine.

  “What do you advise?” Surp asked
the Brain.

  “This is my advice,” boomed the
Brain. “When you go to Ingomar,
take the real Lanu with you. Put him
on his throne again. Let him lead the
expedition to Cholu. Once on Cholu,
you can kill him, and return to Bara
with the story that he was killed in
fighting. You will then be acclaimed
king without opposition.”

  Crain saw Surp’s eyes narrow. “It
would be a good plan,” Surp said, “but
we dare not take Lanu back to his
throne now, after kidnaping him. His
first act would be to order us arrested,
for having abducted him.”

  “Not if you do as I say,” the Brain
boomed. “Tell Lanu that you abduc-
ted him only to save him from a plot
made by Dandor and this Choluan to

put the Choluan on the throne. As
loyal subjects, you kidnaped Lanu to
save him from the plotters. Lanu will
believe that, and you will also turn
him against whatever Dandor may
say.”

  “As always, you clear my path!”
Surp cried to the monstrous machine.
Then he shouted to the guards.
“Bring King Lanu here—with re-
spect.”

 Philip Crain stood helpless,
astounded by the diabolical ingenuity
of the scheme the Brain had proposed.

  The guards reentered. And with
them walked Lanu. His white tunic
was soiled and torn, and fear was in
his weak, irresolute face as he faced
Surp. Then surprise flashed over
Lanu’s features as he saw Crain stand-
ing bound and helpless.

  ‘My half-brother from Cholu!" he
exclaimed. “Has Surp caught you,
too?”

  Before Crain could reply, Surp
stepped quickly forward and bowed
respectfully to Lanu.

  “Your pardon, Highness, for the
roughness we’ve had to use with you,”
he asked. “We could not be too con-
siderate, for there was little time in
which to save your life.”

LANU laughed bitterly. “You
abducted me, then, and have kept
me prisoned in that dusty cell for two
days, to save my life? A likely story.”

  “It is the truth, Highness,” Surp
swore. “Had we not brought you here
forcibly, without taking time to ex-
plain to you, you would have been a
dead man now.”

  “They’re lying to you, Lanu!” Crain
shouted furiously. “They plan to get
you to Earth and then—”

  “Silence that half-breed i” snapped
Surp. A guard swiftly clapped a big
hand over Philip Crain’s mouth.

 “That mongrel half-brother of
yours and the old scientist Dandor,
Highness,” Surp said, “were in a plot
to kill you, and put the half-breed on
the throne.”

  “I don’t believe it!” Lanu declared.
“Dandor has been the most loyal sup-
porter of our house, since long be-
fore I was born.”
THE PRISONER OF MARS

67

  “Yet it’s the truth, Highness," Surp
insisted. “Dandor has long been pre-
paring it, communicating secretly
with your Choluan half-brother, and
finally bringing him to Bara. Then
Dandor summoned you in secret to his
desert tower. He meant to murder
you there and put your half-brother
on the throne, as you! But I had
heard rumors of the plot. I sent my
men and they snatched you out of
Dandor’s tower, in the nick of time.
As it is, Dandor’s plot almost suc-
ceeded anyway. For Dandor went
boldly ahead and put this Krayn, this
mongrel Choluan, on your throne.
Yes, for two days your half-brother
has been taking your place in Ingo-
mar, impersonating you. See, he still
wears your royal cloak!"

  Lanu stiffened as he saw the crim-
son cloak that hung from the shoul-
ders of the helpless Crain.

  “By the gods, if this is true!” Lanu
swore, anger creeping into his eyes.
“If this by-blow of my father’s has
dared trade on his resemblance to me
to sneak onto my throne—”

  “You will learn its truth when you
reach Ingomar!” Surp declared.
“You'll learn that while we kept you
locked up here for safety, this Krayn
has strutted in your place.”

  “Aye,” drawled Ligor, “he has even
dared take your place with Princess
Mara. Our spies saw them upon her
balcony last night, in each other’s
arms.”

  Lanu's anger exploded into blind-
ing rage when he heard that.

  “You dared do that?" he snarled at
Crain. “You, a creature from Cholu,
unfit to touch Mara’s sandal!”

  “He would still be sitting on your
throne," Surp declared, “if we had not
struck for your cause tonight. We
kidnaped him secretly from the palace
and brought him here. And now you
can go back. Highness—the true king
returning."

  Crain heard the diabolically in-
genious lies that the Brain had de-
vised, without ability to contradict.
As he struggled vainly to free himself,
he saw that Lanu was accepting the
whole fabric of deception. For Lanu
turned to Surp, gratitude in his eyes.

  “You have saved my throne from a
hellish plot, Surp!” he declared.
“You, whom I always deemed an
enemy to my house. Well, I know
now who my real friends and enemies
are. Dandor shall die for his part in
this.”

 “And your half-brother?” Surp
asked quickly. As Lanu hesitated;
"Remember, Highness, his resem-
blance makes him a danger to you as
long as he lives.”

 “Keep him captive here,” Lanu
ordered, “until I decide his fate. I
cannot order his death too hastily,
for after all, he is my father’s son.”

SURP nodded. “He shall be kept
safely prisoned here, then,” Surp
agreed smoothly. “Now we go to
Ingomar, Highness, for we must begin
preparations for the expedition to
Cholu.”

  Lanu’s eyes lit. “Yes, now that the
road to Cholu is open through the
matter-casters, we must not delay!”
Philip Crain saw the hidden smiles
on the faces of Surp and Ligor, and he
groaned. If he could only tell Lanu
that they meant to kill him on Earth,
that they meant never to release the
Electrae—

  Suddenly the hollow voice of the
Brain boomed out through the octa-
gonal hall.

  “One thing more,” said the great
mechanical intellect. “You know,
Surp, that I probed the mind of the
Choluan girl today, so that I might
learn from it the nature of Choluan
weapons and devise a mechanism that
would render them useless.”

  “I know,” Surp said impatiently,
glancing at the great hemispherical
thing on which the Brain's arms were
working. “You will have the anti-
catalyzer ready before we leave for
Cholu, will you not?”

  “It will be ready, yes,” the Brain
promised. “But what I wish to tell
you is that when I probed the girl’s
mind I learned that those who stand
by the matter-caster on Cholu will
only turn it on upon hearing her voice
or this man’s. You must take the girl
with you, therefore, so that she can
speak to those on Cholu and have them
68

STARTLING STORIES

turn their matter-caster on when you
are ready.’'

  “Bring the girl, then,” Surp
ordered.

  Two of the gray-cowled servitors
of the Brain hastened out. When they
returned with Kay, her face blanched
as she saw Crain, bound and gagged.
But when Surp told her what they
expected of her, she flamed defiance.

  “I won’t do it!” she cried. “I’ll die
before I’ll call to Father to turn on
that machine, so that you Martians
can go through to Earth with me.”

  “A little torture will soon bring her
around,” Ligor drawled.

  Crain writhed in fury, but the
Brain’s hollow, booming voice broke
in:

  “No torture will break this girl’s
spirit. But I can make her do the
thing willingly. Bring her before
me.

  Horror was in Kay’s white face as
the cowled servitors thrust her in
front of the five glowing eyes of the
monstrous mechanism.

  “Look into my eyes,” boomed the
Brain’s heavy voice. “Look—” Flecks
of red swirled and seethed in the
glowing eyes of the Brain.

  The cowled servitors released her
but she remained standing, staring
fixedly into the quintuple shining
eyes of the mechanical mind.

  “You will obey my commands,”
boomed the Brain.

  “I will obey,” repeated Kay, her
face mask-like, her eyes blank.

  “When these men order you. you
will call those on Cholu to open their
matter-caster,” the Brain said.

  “I will call them,” Kay repeated
stonily.

  “Now go with your masters,” the
machine told her. She turned obedi-
ently, empty eyes staring unseeingly.

  Lanu was gazing in horror at the
massive machine that had just hypno-
tized the girl.

HAT thing,” he muttered, “is
it not the thinking robot, the
Brain, that was supposed to have been
destroyed years ago?”

  “It is, Highness," Surp said quickly.
“And well for you that it was not

destroyed, since the Brain’s help en-
abled me to foil Dandor’s plot. That
was why Dandor ordered the Brain
destroyed. He feared it might be able
to thwart his plots against your
house."

  “If the thing has aided me, very
well,” Lanu said, yet he shuddered. “I
do not like such monsters!” Then his
eyes were alight again. “We go now
to Ingomar—and soon to Cholu!
Come!”

  Helpless, unable to voice a word,
Philip Crain watched his duped half-
brother stride out, followed by Surp
and the stiffly-moving, hypnotized
Kay and the guards.

  He had lost everything! Both the
worlds to which he owed loyalty were
destined to disaster—Earth to become
a looted desert, Mars to become sub-
ject to the tyranny of Surp.

  Ligor had remained behind, and
there was a taunting smile in his
heavy-lidded eyes as he said:
“Farewell, Sir Impostor. I leave you
to the mercies of the Brain. And I
tell you one thing—when Lanu is dead
and my Father rules Bara, I am to
have the Princess Mara. Whether
she wills it or not, she is to be mine.
Let that thought comfort you as you
die.”

CHAPTER XV
Creature and Creator

FEELING hands lifting him, Crain
came slowly out of restless, tor-
mented sleep. He was still in the
dusty cell in which he had been pris-
oned for the last four days. And the
gray-cowled servitors of the Brain
were now lifting him upon a wheeled
table.

  He struggled, but without avail.
His arms and legs were still tightly
bound with the self-contracting metal
ropes called the Tighteners. Crain
had learned that the Tighteners were
really nothing but ingenious magnetic
mechanisms controlled by the Brain
itself.

  “The Brain is ready to examine you
THE PRISONER OF MARS

69

now, Choluan,” one of the gray-
cowled servitors told him.

 “Damn you!” muttered Crain
thickly. “If my hands were loose—”

  He knew that it must be night again,
for he had kept track of hours and
days during his captivity. And as
they wheeled him along dusty, lighted
stone corridors, he could hear a wail-
ing and groaning coming, muffled
from overhead, speaking of a great
wind-storm that was buffeting ruined
L’Lon.

  Crain had known a torturing agony
of spirit in his cell, thinking of what
must be going on in Ingomar. The
great expedition would be preparing
to flash across the gulf to Earth, Lanu
going blindly to his doom and Surp
ready to grasp the power.

  Crain’s eyes were blinded by the
blaze of light as he was wheeled into
the great octagonal hall. The gray-
clad servitors wheeled him to the
stone dais on which the Brain rested.
The hemispherical mechanism on
which the Brain had been working
was gone now. Its five glowing eyes
stared at Crain, and its booming voice
reverberated above the muffled roar of
the storm.

  “I am now able to examine you,
Choluan,” it boomed to the helpless
Earthman, “since I have now finished
the anti-catalyzer that Surp will take
with him to Cholu. I expect to learn
much about that world’s creatures
from you.”

  “Damn you, why don’t you kill me
and get it over with!” raged Crain,
glaring up into the quintuple shining
eyes.

  “Because,” the Brain explained
coolly, “your dead body, interesting as
it will be to dissect, will tell me much
less about Choluan life and its differ-
ences from Baran life, than your liv-
ing body can tell me. A man in my
position might possibly feel the emo-
tion called pity, and grant your desire
for a quick death. Men are ruled by
their turbid emotions, and that is why
they learn so little in their short lives.
But to me, an immortal intellect un-
encumbered with distracting emo-
tions, nothing is of importance but the
search for truth, which will occupy

me long ages after all your ephemeral
race has vanished.”

  Four of the intricately-jointed arms
of the Brain were reaching toward
Crain’s helpless form. One arm ended
in a glittering scalpel, another in a
fine, crescent - shaped saw, and the
other two held swabs.

  “I want samples of tissue and bone
from you first,” the Brain’s metallic
voice said. “They may help substan-
tiate an interesting theory which I
have formed since I learned that
Cholu is inhabited by a race of men
essentially similar to the Baran race.”

CRAIN closed his eyes, to stand the
agony as the scalpel stabbed the
flesh of his upper arm. And the Brain’s
hollow voice boomed on as the thing
worked.

  “It is coming to be my theory,” the
Brain was saying, “that the men of
Cholu and the men of Bara are
branches of the same parent human
stock. The resemblances between the
two species are so great as to tolerate
no other solution. But where did that
parent human stock originate?

  “I believe it originated upon a
planet which once existed between
Bara, the fourth world from the sun,
and Orkol, the giant fifth world. The
great numbers of asteroids in that belt
of space are clearly the fragments of
a planet that was shattered by internal
cataclysm. Upon that planet, long
ago, must have originated the ances-
tors of both Choluans and Barans.

  “My telescopic investigation of the
fragments of that shattered world have
convinced me that that planet met its
end from a cataclysmic release of un-
controllable atomic energy. This ar-
gues a high state of scientific powers
for its inhabitants, and such a race
would have had no difficulty in col-
onizing both Bara and Cholu. When
the parent world was destroyed, the
colonists upon these two worlds
doubtless sank into such savagery that
the memory of their racial past disap-
peared, and thus—”

  The fine saw was rasping at Crain’s
bone, scraping away a small sample.
The nauseating agony of that made
Crain’s consciousness whirl and fade.
70

STARTLING STORIES

  Through dimming ears, he heard the
Brain boom an order to the cowled
servitors.

  “Revive the subject, before I take
the next samples of tissue. He must
not sink into coma.”

  Crain dimly realized that he was be-
ing wheeled to a far corner of the
great hall, then a sensation of cold in-
vaded his pain-racked brain as a cool-
ing chemical spray was played upon
his face. And that sensation suddenly
detonated a terrific idea in his dizzy
brain. A tremendous inspiration that
burst like a starshell in his mind as he
felt that snowlike cooling spray.

 He opened his eyes. The Brain
was already making microscopic anal-
ysis of the samples of bone tissue,
while it awaited Crain’s revival.

  The two cowled men had left Crain
for a moment. His mind whirled with
crazy, soaring excitement.

  “My God, I’ve found it!" he whis-
pered hoarsely. “And it means life to
both worlds!”

  Yes, it had crashed into his dimmed
brain as he revived from the torture
—that tremendous inspiration. A way
that would give water in plenty to
Mars, without harming Earth in the
slightest!

  Crain’s mind rocked with the joy of
his discovery. The conflict of loyal-
ties in his mind, the conflict between
his terrestrial and Martian blood, was
over. Mars could be revived, the Elec-
trae could be freed, without harming
Earth. He could be loyal now to both
his worlds.

  And then black reaction crushed
down on him. The inspiration had
come too late! He was doomed to a
torturing death in this ghastly cham-
ber, and his plan would never have a
chance.

HE closed his eyes to keep back
the bitter tears. He felt one of
the cowled servitors bending over him
again, but in his crushing despair, he
paid no heed.

  “Krayn, open your eyes! It is I!"

  That stealthy whisper galvanized
Crain like an electric shock. He knew
that voice!

  He opened his eyes. The cowled

 man bending over him—the face hid-
 den by the cowl’s shadow was wrin-
 kled, old, with burning black eyes.

    “Dandor!” he choked.

    “Quiet!” Dandor whispered, glanc-
  ing toward the end of the hall where
  the Brain was busy with its absorbing
  analysis.

    Dandor’s hands were tugging at the
  metal Tighteners around Crain, striv-
  ing to unloosen them.

   “I came for you, Krayn,” Dandor
 murmured hoarsely. “I had to flee for
 my life four days ago, when Lanu re-
 turned with Surp.” There was agony
 in the old man’s whisper. “Surp had
 turned Lanu against me, made him
 think I had plotted with you against
 him. He would not listen to me, but
 sentenced me to death. I escaped be-
 fore the guards could seize me, and
 hid for these four days in a secret
 place in Ingomar. A great sand-storm
 is blowing over Bara tonight. I
 escaped the city under cover of the
 storm, and came here to free you and
 Kro, so that you could help me foil
 Surp’s plot before the expedition goes
 to Cholu.”

    As Dandor frantically sought to un-
  loosen the Tighteners, Crain anxious-
  ly whispered: “When does the expedi-
  tion leave?”

   “Tomorrow morning!” Dandor an-
 swered. “An advance guard of Baran
 soldiers has already gone through to
 Cholu, and holds the matter-caster
 there. They used the hypnotized Cho-
 luan girl to call those on Cholu to turn
 on their matter-caster. Then the ad-
 vance guard went through with the
 girl. They took with them parts with
 which to build a far bigger matter-
 caster on Cholu. A similar huge mat-
 ter-caster has been set up in the plaza
 of Ingomar. The equipment has all
 been ready for years—matter-casters,
 Worms mounted with great gas-guns,
 everything. Lanu and Surp will lead
 the expedition to Cholu in the morn-
 ing.”

    Crain blanched at that information.

- Barans already holding the Earth end
  of the space-bridge! Lanu and Surp
  and the main Martian forces ready in
  a few hours to flash to Earth!

   “The expedition must not start,
THE PRISONER OF MARS

71

Dandor!” Crain whispered frantically.
“I have thought of a way by which
Bara can be revived without robbing
Cholu of water!”

  Dandor froze, staring down at him.
“You have such a plan?” he whis-
pered. His eyes lit. “Then we must
put it into effect. We must not dev-
astate Cholu, if we can get water with-
out doing that.”

  He was hoarse with emotion. “If I
can get you out of here, and we can
convince Lanu—”

  “Don’t wait to free me! You can’t
loosen these Tighteners, for they’re
controlled by the Brain itself. Go
back to Ingomar and beg Lanu . . .
Look out, Dandor!”

  Three cowled servitors had softly
approached behind Dandor, were fling-
ing Tighteners around him. The
metal strands instantly contracted
around the old scientist, pinioning his
arms and legs.

  “Caught!” groaned Dandor.

  The voice of the Brain boomed from
the end of the hall.

  “Bring them here,” it ordered.

THE cowled men, wheeling Crain’s
table and carrying the helpless
Dandor, obeyed. In a moment, Dandor
and Crain were helpless in front of the
Brain.

  The mechanism’s quintuple glowing
eyes contemplated them. Crain felt
black despair. This, the chance that
for a moment he had hoped would suc-
ceed, gone!

  “You are Dandor, the scientist,”
boomed the Brain. “You were chief
of that committee of scientists who
created me, long ago.”

  “Yes,” Dandor said thickly, his
wrinkled face deathly as he stared in-
to the glowing eyes.

 “You underestimate my powers,
Dandor, when you seek to employ such
a crude stratagem as that,” the Brain
declared. “If you had known that I
have so improved my senses that I can
hear every word spoken in this whole
ruined city, you would not have been
so foolish as to whisper to your
friend.”

  Dandor made no answer, his burn-
ing eyes held by the five glowing orbs

of the metal monster. In the taut si-
lence the shrieking clamor of the sand-
storm could be clearly heard, raging
across the ruined metropolis above.

  “You understand, of course,” said
the Brain, “that your life is forfeit
for this intrusion.”

  “I understand,” Dandor said quiet-
ly. “Yet I want to remind you of one
thing—it was I who directed your
creation. More than any other man, I
am responsible for your existence.”

  “I am aware of that,” the Brain re-
plied coldly. “But I trust that you
are not going to beg me for your life,
on that ground? You, best of all men,
should know that such emotions as
gratitude are wholly alien to my men-
tality.”

  “I know that you have no emotions,”
Dandor said coolly. “But I know
also that you have a super-logical
mind, Brain. It is logic that will make
you spare the lives of myself and my
friend.”

  “What logical reason can you ad-
vance to make me do such a thing?”
the Brain inquired.

  “I am going to bargain with you,”
Dandor answered tautly. “My life and
the lives of Krayn and Kro, for some-
thing which I alone can tell you, some-
thing that is of utter importance to
you.”

  The booming voice from the dia-
phragm came hollow and toneless as
ever, but the words were derisive.

  “You bargain with me? You, an ag-
ing, feeble creature of flesh and blood,
bargain with me, the immortal and age-
less intellect whose powers are beyond
even your comprehension!”

       CHAPTER XVI
       Chamber of Death

LYING helpless upon his table,
Crain felt the derision of the Brain
echo through his own mind. What
could Dandor say or do to change the
monstrous mechanism’s will?

  Dandor, as he stood swaying with
arms and legs bound, his thin form un-
steady, his white hair disordered where
72

STARTLING STORIES

the gray cowl had been pulled off,
looked pitifully tiny and feeble beside
the huge, complex metal mechanism
whose glowing eyes stared at him. Yet
in the old scientist’s face was calm
confidence.

 “You wish to bargain,” the Brain
was booming. “Then what can you
offer me, for your lives?”

  “I can offer you life, Brain,” was
Dandor's answer. “Mental life, the
only kind you care about.”

  "You talk foolishly, man,” said the
cold metallic voice. “How can you offer
me life when I am already immortal?
My metal body, watched over and re-
newed by myself at necessary intervals,
cannot rot or die like a human body.
And my mind, embodied in the com-
plex metal neurones which you your-
self devised, cannot die any more than
my body.”

 “Your mind cannot die, I agree,”
Dandor said calmly. His eyes nar-
rowed. “But, Brain, your mind can
cease to grow.”

  Crain saw the flexible eye-stalks of
the Brain twitch slightly. As though
that suggestion had astonished even
the cold intellect of the machine.

 “What do you mean?” the Brain
quickly demanded. “The cortex of
metal neurones that holds my mind is
of vast size and complexity. There is
room in it for billions more synaptic
patterns, vastly more knowledge. How
can my mind cease to grow when there
is so much room in my brain for it to
grow in?”

  “There is room, yes,” Dandor again
agreed. “But suppose the neurone
structure of your brain slowly crystal-
lized? Became rigid, fixed, unable to
record any more synaptic patterns, any
more knowledge?”

  “That cannot happen!” exclaimed the
Brain.

  “It can happen and it will happen—
soon!” Dandor affirmed with positive-
ness. “For you were so designed when
we created you, Brain. That provision
was incorporated into you, just as in
every other robot's brain we ever made.

  "It was a provision inspired by cau-
tion,” the old scientist continued rap-
idly. “We wanted our robots to be able
to learn, but not to learn too much. So

we constructed the neurone structures
of their brains of a metal subtly al-
loyed so that after a certain period of
years it would crystallize and be un-
able to record further impressions. In
that way, we were sure that our robots,
while they might be immortal physi-
cally, would not go on learning and
acquiring power indefinitely.

 “Your own brain,” Dandor con-
cluded, “is so large and complex that
you have been able to acquire, in these
years, far more knowledge than any
robot we ever built. You acquired so
much, indeed, in those first years that
we deemed it advisable not to wait for
the inevitable crystallization of your
brain, but to destroy you and all the
other robots at once. You have been
learning, growing more powerful and
wise, ever since you escaped that de-
struction. But the time is almost at
hand when the metal neurones of your
brain will inevitably crystallize, and
then you will be able to learn nothing
more.”

THE quintuple eye-stalks of the
Brain blinked in an almost human
horror.

  “To learn nothing more?” rasped
the great voice. “But that must not
be! My life is of the intellect, my
only motives for existence the endless
unfolding of new truths. My immor-
tality would be a mockery if I ceased
to learn, if what you say is true. But
I do not believe you speak truth! You
seek by a lie to persuade me to spare
you and your friend.”

  “If you prove to your satisfaction
that I am speaking the truth,” Dandor
asked calmly, “will you spare me and
my friend if I advise you how to avoid
this crystallization of your neur-
ones?”

  “Yes!” agreed the Brain. “If you
are telling the truth about this, I shall
let you and your companion and the
robot go free in return for your advice
as to how I am to avoid this fate.”
“You have only to examine the cor-
tex of your brain,” Dandor said, “and
you will find that the crystallization
has already begun.”

  “I shall do that,” said the Brain.
“We shall if you speak truly.”
THE PRISONER OF MARS

  The Brain’s jointed metal arms
moved swiftly. The sprays of vibra-
tion playing upon the huge ovoid mass
at its core were suddenly turned off.
The jointed arms reached into the
complex metal body and began to re-
move the front plates of the ovoid
brain case. Crain felt a weird repul-
sion when the cortex, the inmost mind
stuff of the Brain, lay naked and re-
vealed. A huge, spongy metal mass it
seemed, wrinkled with numberless
folds and corrugations.

  The Brain turned the stalk of its
miscroscopic eye inward, that glow-
ing magnifying eye scanning the
spongy metal mass of its own cortex
from a distance of a few inches. Dan-
dor was standing rigid.

  “I think you lie,” the Brain’s deep
voice rumbled. “I can find no evi-
dence of—”

  Dandor acted! The moment for
which the old scientist had waited had
come. He threw his bound body for-
ward with frenzied effort.

  His shoulder hit the curved metal
stalk of the microscopic eye with
which the Brain was examining its
cortex. And the impact drove that
eye and stalk deep into the spongy
metal mass of the great cortex.

  “Ah-h-h-h!” screamed a horrible,
booming uluation from the diaphragm.

  Death scream of the Brain, as its
cortex was riven by its own eye-stalk!
The creature’s myriad jointed arms
threshed furiously in crazy death
throes.

  Those metal arms flung Dandor
across the hall as if he were a puppet.
He struck the stone wall with a thud.
And then the arms ceased their thresh-
ing, the other glowing eyes of the
Brain went black, the unhuman death
scream ended.

  And as the metal monster died,
Crain felt the metal bonds of the
Tighteners relax, no longer controlled
by their unhuman inventor.

  “They have killed the Brain!”
screamed one of the gray-cowled
servitors.

  “Slay them—the Brain is dead!”
the others cried hoarsely, as they
charged upon Crain and the aged Dan-
dor.

 THOUGH his body was so stiff
 from long days in bondage that
 he could hardly stand, Crain hit out
 wildly and knocked down the first two
 of the onrushing, maddened servitors.

' He saw one of the others raising a
 gas-gun, pointing it toward him.

   Then the door of the great hall
 crashed open, and a terrible metallic
 cry rang through it. The huge silver
 figure of Kro the robot was bursting
 in. Kro who also had been freed of
 the Tighteners when the Brain died,
 and who had smashed through doors
 like a battering-ram.

   Kro’s metal fist crashed down like
 trip-hammers, pulping the skulls of
 the gray-clad servitors. The robot
 had seemingly gone mad with rage,
 was whirling his arms like giant metal
 maces, killing, killing, killing . . .

   Screaming, the remaining servitors
 fled. But with greater swiftness, Kro
 leaped after them and smote them
 down. The last scream died. And the
 robot came stalking back, his metal
 arms red with blood.

   Crain had stumbled to where Dan-
 dor lay against the stone wall. The
 old man’s body was broken and limp,
 but his eyes were open. Black, large,
 strange, they looked up at Crain from
 his deathly face.

   “The Brain?” he whispered, from
 lips that hardly moved.

   “Dead!” Crain cried. Tears were
 running down his face.

   A ghostly smile came into Dandor's
 pallid face. “I thought that I could
 trick it,” the dying scientist mur-
 mured, “with that lie about crystalli-
 zation of its cortex. He might read
 the minds of others to know it was a
 lie, but I, who helped make his me-
 chanism, knew how to close my mind
 to his probing.”

   “Dandor,” Crain said hoarsely, “I
 must get you to help!”

   “Krayn, listen,” whispered the old
 man, trying to raise himself. "This
 plan of yours to renew Bara without
 harming Cholu—you must put that
 into effect. My conscience has hurt
 me these last days at the thought that
 we must bring destruction to the
 people of Cholu for the sake of our
 own world. I can die easily now if I
<4

STARTLING STORIES

know that you will not allow that to
happen, and that you will save Bara
from Surp’s tyranny. You must go
quickly to Ingomar, before the
expedition leaves.”

  “I will!” Crain cried. “But you—”

  Dandor’s dimming eyes shifted to
the great robot.

  “Kro!” he whispered.

  “Yes, Master,” answered the metal-
lic voice. Was there something ach-
ing, something almost human in it?

  “Kro, my most faithful friend and
servant, you must take Krayn as your
master now,” Dandor whispered. “You
must obey him as you have obeyed
me.”

  “Yes, Master,” came the robot’s
reply.

  Dandor’s thin, cold fingers touched
Crain’s hand.

  “Kfayn, you are a worthy son of
Tharkol. “I wish that you, instead of
Lanu—”

  His voice trailed away in a sigh.
His half-closed eyes stared emptily,
his body suddenly still.

  “He is dead,” said Crain, fighting
back the blinding tears.

  “Yes, Master,” said Kro, standing
motionless.

  Crain staggered to his feet. “We
shall give him burial later, Kro,” he
choked. “Now we must hasten to
Ingomar.”

THE robot’s metal arm supported
Crain as he stumbled out of that
chamber of appalling death. As they
climbed the stairs toward the surface-
level the howling of the storm came
louder to their ears. A shrieking and
wailing of winds almost deafened
Crain as he and Kro emerged into the
dark stone court where two Worms
were parked.

  Kro helped him into one of the
vehicles, and then the robot drove it
out into the night. The full fury of
the storm bellowed down on them,
drowning every other sound in its in-
sensate roar, scourging the gliding
Worm with blasts of wind-driven sand
that almost overturned it.

  Ruined L’Lon towered ghostly
about them. The two moons and the
stars were obscured by the screaming

sand that filled the air. Yet as the
Worm groped blindly through the
tempest, Crain glimpsed scattered
hosts of the drifting firefly Electrae
about them, unaffected by the wind
and raging sand.

  “Everything depends on my getting
to Ingomar before the expedition goes
to Earth, Kro!” Crain cried hoarsely.

  Kro opened the power to the limit.
Like a shooting serpent of metal, the
Worm rushed forward through the
black, blind fury of the tempest that
howled across the dying world.

  As they raced through darkness
across the storm-swept desert, Crain
felt the agony of complete circulation
returning to his stiffened body. He
fumbled to bind up the wound in his
arm.

  His whole life seemed focused now
upon one possibility. If the expedi-
tion had not gone yet—if Lanu could
be made to listen—

  The minutes seemed like hours, the
hours like eternities, as the Worm
fought on through the raging storm.
Anxiously Crain peered ahead.
Would the lights of Ingomar never
appear?

      CHAPTER XVII
      Into the Phantoms

VAGUELY Crain’s haggard eyes
finally discerned lights shining
through the storm-driven sand and
night.

  “Ingomar!” he cried. “Faster,
Kro!”

  But the Worm could go no faster.
Soon they were entering the city. Its
streets were deserted, its looming
towers scourged by blasts of sand and
shrieking wind.

  Crain had told the robot to drive
toward the palace. Presently they
were circling around the great plaza.
Lights were flaring there, and Crain
saw the huge matter-caster that had
been set up on the plaza. A colossal
crystal disk, ringed with enormous
transformers, it gleamed brightly
through the obscurity.
THE PRISONER OF MARS

75

  Around the matter-caster, waiting
to be flashed from it in detachments
to the identical mechanism on Earth,
stood thousands upon thousands of
Baran soldiers, their helmets and
metal tunics gleaming under th®-
lights; many hundreds of the great
Worms, the ugly snouts of big gas-
guns protruding from their heads and
sides; great piles of matter-caster
parts, which had been ready for years
and which would form the machines
to hurl Earth's water to Mars; and a
big, hemispherical machine which
Crain recognized as the device the
Brain had constructed to nullify
Earth weapons. The thing called an
anti-catalyzer.

  “Thank God, we’re here before the
expedition starts,” Crain said hoarse-
ly. “There’s still time to stop it.”

  “To the palace door, Master?” Kro
asked.

  “No, drive to the gardens on the
east side of the palace,” Crain ordered.

  Presently the robot stopped the
Worm at the edge of the dark, storm-
whipped gardens. Philip Crain
hastily climbed out.

  “Wait here in the gardens, Kro,” he
swiftly commanded, “and keep hidden.
Since the death sentence was passed
on Dandor you, his robot, would be
destroyed if you were seen.”

  “I will wait, Master,” answered the
robot imperturbably.

  Wind-whipped branches lashed his
face, sand struck him in stinging,
blinding blasts as Crain plunged
toward the palace. The gale tearing
through Ingomar was a steady roar.
Around him, as he staggered on,
floated the wandering stars of the
drifting, unaffected Electrae.

  At the rear entrance of the palace,
guards flashed up their gas-guns as
Crain approached.

  “Halt there!”

  Crain only came on, so that the
light from within the entrance fell
upon his face.

  “The King!” cried an officer. “But
I thought you were inside with the
others, Highness.”

  “Stand aside!” Crain ordered.

  Staring in amazement at his bloody
face and torn tunic, the officer obeyed.

  Crain pitched through the entrance,
down rosy, soft-lit corridors toward
the royal apartment. He heard a hum
of excited voices from within it as he
reached its door.

  He flung the door open, stood stag-
gering on its threshold. Every head
in the apartment turned toward him.
There was a moment of frozen silence.

  Lanu stiffened with amazement.
And Surp and Ligor, who had been
talking earnestly to the king, glared
at Crain as though they could not be-
lieve their eyes. A half dozen guards
nearby seemed even more struck with
consternation.

BUT it was the Princess Mara,
standing near Lanu, who seemed
most staggered by the shock of Crain’s
appearance. Her hand went to her
throat, her dark eyes dilated as she
saw the disordered, bloody Crain
standing there, identical in face and
figure with the king.

  Crain pitched forward, toward
Lanu.

  "Lanu, wait!” he cried hoarsely.
“Hear me, before you lead that expedi-
tion to Earth!”

  “My half-brother!” Lanu exclaimed.
“He has escaped from the Brain,
Surp!”

  Mara’s face paled as she heard the
king’s words. She looked distractedly
at Lanu.

  “Your half-brother?” she whispered.

  Crain saw now that she had known
nothing of the imposture. Lanu had
kept that secret, even from her. And
now, seeing Crain with Lanu for the
first time, understanding leaped into
her dark eyes.

  “Your half-brother?” she repeated.
“Then it was he who was king for
those two days when I—”

  “Yes, he dared impersonate me for
two days," Lanu exclaimed, his amaze-
ment changing to rage at the remem-
brance. “He, a half-breed from Cholu,
dared sit on my throne and even dared
make love to you, Mara.”

  “He’ll not escape again!” declared
Surp, raging as he drew out his gas-
gun.

  “Wait, Surp!” Lanu exclaimed. “I
told you that he was not to be killed
STARTLING STORIES

yet. After all, he is my father’s son.”

 Crain disregarded the menacing
weapon in the hand of the raging no-
ble.

  “Lanu, listen to me!” he pleaded
hoarsely. “You must not take that ex-
pedition to Earth! It means your
death, and it means devastation for
Earth and slavery for Bara. I have a
plan—”

  “Seize him!” Surp cried to the star-
ing guards, and men hastily gripped
Philip Crain’s staggering figure.

  Mara was still staring from Crain to
Lanu as though she could not credit
what she saw.

  “I will not listen to any more of
your lies!” Lanu shouted at Crain.
“You, who dared usurp my throne,
you expect me to believe your false-
hoods?”

 He nodded to Surp. “Send him
back to L’Lon, to the custody of the
Brain.”

  Crain laughed savagely. “Too late
for that! The Brain is dead—slain
by Dandor.”

 From Surp came an unhuman bel-
low of rage.

 “The Brain dead? My great ally
slain?” Diabolical fury was in his face
as he whirled toward Lanu. “Let me
kill this mongrel for that, Highness!”
he cried. “Gods, to think that he and
that old fox Dandor should have slain
the mightiest intellect on this world!”

  “Yes, Highness,” Ligor urged tense-
ly. “While this Choluan half-breed
lives, there is no safety for you, since
he may again escape and impersonate
you.”

  “I can’t have my own half-brother
killed like that,” Lanu said with deep
reluctance, “no matter what his crimes
have been. He must be kept in some
safe prison.”

  “What prison will hold him, when
the mighty Brain could not?” Ligor
pointed out.

INTO Surp’s hard face suddenly
came an expression of ferocious

j°y>

  “I know where we can put him so
that he will be safe,” Surp declared.
“Among the Electrae!”

  “Make him one of the Electrae?”

the king cried. “That would be more
horrible than killing him!”

  “It is the only place where we can
keep him safe, Highness!” Surp urged.
“We can take him secretly to the tem-
ple and do it, and no one will know of
his existence but ourselves and these
guards of mine, whose silence I’ll
vouch for. He cannot escape from the
Electrae, and when Bara is revived
and the Electrae all made real again,
then you can decide his fate.”

  Horror invaded Philip Crain’s mind
as he perceived Surp’s diabolical in-
tention. The noble well knew that
Lanu would never return from Earth,
that the Electrae would never be
freed. He would leave Crain with the
other Electrae, a drifting electric
ghost until the end of time.

  “No, Lanu!” Mara cried, terrified.
“You can’t do such a thing.”

  Lanu had seemed to be on the verge
of denying Surp’s wish. But the pro-
test of the princess stung the king.

   "You plead for him, Mara?” he cried
angrily. “Then perhaps it is the pre-
tended Lanu, and not the real Lanu,
whom you love?”

  A flash of defiance lit up Mara’s
blue-black eyes.

  “Yes, it is,” she declared unhesi-
tatingly.

  The joy that rocked Philip Crain’s
mind at that passionate avowal was
crushed in the next moment by Lanu’s
raging cry.

  “Then your lover goes into the
Electrae, as Surp wishes!” the king
exclaimed. “I'll not leave him here
to sneak again upon my throne and
take my place with you!”

“Lanu, hear me!” Crain cried des-
perately. “If you go to Earth, you’ll
never come back! Surp plans—”
“Silence him!” shouted Lanu, his
face flaming with jealousy and rage.

  The words were stifled in Crain’s
throat by the brawny hand of one of
the guards who gripped him.

  "We'll take him to the temple at
once, in secret,” Lanu declared, his
.-black eyes still flaming anger. “Once
he is safely in the Electrae, we can
start to Cholu, leaving Ligor here as
regent of Bara, as you suggested.”
"Good!” Surp was exultant. “Wrap
THE PRISONER OF MARS

77

him in a cloak, men. No one must see
his face.”

  A smothering cloak was wrapped
around Crain and he was picked up
bodily. He struggled, but futilely, to
break free. He could hear Mara still
pleading frantically with Lanu, as he
was carried from the room.

  In a few moments Crain felt the
chill of cold air, heard the roar of the
storm, and knew they were in the open
air. From far to the left came the thin
voices of the soldiers in the plaza. He
knew then that he was being taken by
a secret, circuitous route to the tem-
ple.

  Crain’s mind had. room now for
nothing but horror as he thought of
the ghastly state into which he was
to be hurled. To become an Electrae,
a drifting electric phantom, doomed
to haunt this world forever—it could-
n’t happen to him, surely! Not when
he had just found the one way out for
both his worlds!

HE heard a challenge of peremp-
tory voices, as his bearers
stopped.

  “Who comes? No man can enter
the temple at night.” Then the voice
exclaimed in altered tones, “The
King!”

  “Stand aside,” Crain heard Lanu tell
the guards, raising his voice over the
howling winds. “We take to the altar
one of the chosen who escaped the last
day of passing.”

  Crain felt himself carried forward,
and the storm roar became muffled as
they entered the temple. He felt him-
self taken down many steps. Then,
his arms still held by guards, the cloak
was whipped off him.

  He stood upon the sunken stage of
the great temple, and through the
dusky darkness he could see figures
standing nearby. Then, from the
crystal disk of the altar, sprang the
shaft of blinding purple force. It cast
a quivering glow outward. The light
fell on Lanu, standing by the red
metal standard, where he had just
turned on the dematerializing purple
force.

  Surp's eyes were gleaming in tri-
umph. And Ligor was regarding

Crain’s desperate face with a smile.

  “Lanu, don’t do this!” Crain cried
hoarsely. “You’re being duped, de-
ceived!”

  Again Lanu’s face showed irresolu-
tion, and a shudder shook the crim-
son-cloaked king.

  “If my father were alive, to see me
cast his other son into the Electrae—”
he muttered shakenly.

  Surp saw his wavering, and pressed
him. “Your throne will not be safe
if you don't do it, Highness! Remem-
ber how easily he took your place be-
fore.”

  “Aye,” drawled Ligor, “he played
your part so well that Mara now pre-
fers him, an exposed impostor, to
you.”

  That reminder did its work. Lanu’s
face flushed and he gestured roughly
to the guards who held Crain.

  “Cast him into the altar!”

   “Wait!” Crain cried, and at that mo-
ment felt himself hurled by brawny
arms straight toward the purple shaft
of light. "Wait—”

  The words were stricken from his
lips as he hurtled into the purple
force.

  Crain felt a terrific, wrenching
shock in every atom of his body, an
awful roaring in his ears, a blinding
blaze in his eyes. Then everything
went dark and silent. Out of that mo-
ment of mad turmoil, he seemed
hurled into the stillness and black-
ness of death.

  His consciousness seemed strangely
dimmed. He was aware of his own
thoughts, but all bodily sensation was
gone from him.

  Gone, as his body was gone! He
knew with dim certainty that he was
now an immaterial thing of photons.
That he was one of the Electrae!

CHAPTER XVIII
Living Death

QUEERLY Philip Crain—the im-
material electric thing that had
once been the man Crain—floated in
a dim semi-consciousness that was
78

STARTLING STORIES

without sight, without sound, without
even time. He knew nothing; nothing
but his own thoughts. He was alone
with his thoughts for all eternity.

  Horror, horror, horror! It was the
only thought his bodiless mind could
contain, the only sensation of which
he was now capable. Horror at the
ghastly fate into which he had been
thrust,the awful doom that was to be
his for all time to come.

  How long had he been in this bodi-
less, immaterial state? How long had
he been an Electrae? He could not
guess. It might have been hours, or
it might have been days or weeks.
Time had ceased to have meaning,
when there were no events to mark its
passage. Nothing changed, in the
dark eternity that encompassed him
—nothing except his racing, ghastly
thoughts.

  He still had memory. He could still
remember that awful moment of shock
when he had been cast into the altar
shaft at Lanu’s order. He could still
reember the sight of Lanu’s weak face,
horror-stricken by his own deed, and
the triumphant face of Surp, the
taunting eyes of Ligor.

  Rage succeeded the horror Crain felt
—blind rage he could not express.
Rage against Surp and Ligor for their
diabolical plan, against Lanu for lis-
tening to them. And then the horror
came back upon him in great waves,
as he realized that he could never now
take revenge upon them, that he, a
bodiless mind lost in lonely eternities,
was cut off forever from everything
real.

 He would never again see Mara,
standing with dark eyes bright and
brave as she had stood when she had
proudly declared her love for him. He
would never again watch the hurtling
moons rise over Bara, never again look
upon the rosy, dawn-flushed towers of
Ingomar. He was near all these things,
yet he was now but one of the blind,
drifting firefly things that he had once
looked upon with such pity.

 Darkness and darkness — and he
floated on through its infinities, alone
with his torturing thoughts. That
sensation of floating was the only sen-
sation of which his new photon body

was capable. He knew that he was
drifting at random, borne upon elec-
tric and magnetic currents, like a rud-
derless ship.

  What could he do? Without a body,
without ability to see or hear or feel?
He was no more than a ghost haunting
the real world, a pitiful ghost who
could not even look upon the living.
A drifting firefly thing, a wandering
glow to be looked on and forgotten.

  Into Crain’s mind, at some time in
this dark timelessness of his new ex-
istence, had come thought that he
might be flung to Earth and remate-
rialized, if he happened to drift into
the great matter-caster when it was
turned on. But even that faint possi-
bility died when he remembered what
Dandor had said that the de-material-
izing and re-materializing forces of
the altar were of a secret, different na-
ture than those of the matter-casters,
though working on the same principle.
Only the altar could make a man into
an Electrae, and only the altar could
ever reverse the ghastly process.

  Crain did not know how much time
had passed in his new existence before
there subtly impinged upon his mind
a foreign thought.

 "Who are you? Are you new?”

HENCE did it come out of the
all-enveloping darkness, that
questioning thought that his mind was
receiving.

  “Are you new?"

  Crain tried to reply. But how could
he, without body or voice? He essayed
to think an answer.

  “Yes, I am new. Who are you?”

 And the impinging answer came
more strongly.

  “I am an Electrae, like yourself.
Come closer, newcomer.”

  “I cannot come closer—I don't know
where you are—I don’t know how to
move!” Crain thought frantically.

  Silence. Had he lost contact with
the other Electrae? The thought of
being left again without even that
ghostly thought-voice was terrible.

  “I am beside you, now,” clearly
came the thought of the other Elec-
trae. “What is your name, newcomer?
I was Skuro, a soldier, when I lived.”
THE PRISONER OF MARS

79

 “My name was Krayn, when I
lived,” Crain thought stumblingly.
“Tell me, how is it that we can com-
municate, when we have no voices?”
Skuro answered. “It is because our
photon bodies are able to project tiny
electrical vibrations, that impinge
upon each other’s photons.”

  “You can move at will?” Crain
asked.

  “Not at will,” the other Electrae
thought back. “Our photon bodies
drift on magnetic currents, and yet
by thought emanations, our one power,
we can breast the currents a little.”
“How long have you been an Elec-
trae?” Crain asked.

  “What was the date when you were
cast out of life?” Skuro asked in turn.

  Crain told him. And the thought-
voice of Skuro answered sadly, “Then
I have been among the Electrae for
nearly thirty years.”

  “Thirty years?” Crain’s bodiless
mind rocked with horror.

  “There is no difference between
thirty years and thirty centuries, to an
Electrae,” Skuro told him. The Elec-
trae’s thought was tinged with wist-
fulness when he continued: “I had a
wife and children who entered the
Electrae with me when I was chosen
in the Drawing. Long since, I became
separated from them, though some-
times I drift into them and exchange
thoughts with them for a little while.”
Crain tried to imagine what thirty
years of existence as an Electrae
would be like, or a thousand years, or
an eternity. He could not vision it.
His mind could not compass such a
dreadful vista, drifting through dark-
ness and silence, wrapped around with
the stillness and emptiness of the in-
finite.

  “Is there no way in which an Elec-
trae can die?” he thought agonizedly
to Skuro.

  It was not Skuro’s thought, but that
of another nearby Electrae, that
answered.

  “No, newcomer, we cannot die. We
cannot even go mad.”

  And the thought of still another
floating near Crain came to him, ques-
tioningly. “Newcomer, tell us, is there
any hope on Bara now for the success

of the great plan?”

  It seemed to Crain that a number of
the Electrae must have gathered
around him, for he received other ea-
gerly inquiring thoughts.

* “Even now," Crain’s thought an-
swered, “Baran forces must be upon
Cholu, ready to hurl the water of that
world to Bara.”

INCREDULOUS, joyful emana-
tions reached him from all sides,
a tumult of rejoicing thoughts.

  “Then it will not be long before we
Electrae are released! We shall be
men again!”

  “No!” Crain told them bitterly.
“Bara may be revived, but we of the
Electrae shall never be released.”

  And he told them through thought
waves, of Surp’s plans to seize royal
power, and let the Electrae remain
forever in their present state.

  Rage, awful and burning, beat upon
Crain’s bodiless mind in every
thought that came to him from the
darkness. The fury of the Electrae.
was terrible, as they learned that their
one hope was snatched from them.

  And higher mounted their rage, as
they learned that Surp had been tam-
pering with the Drawing of the Lots
so that only those he hated, only those
who refused to support his ambitions,
had been chosen to become Electrae.

 “Gods!” came Skuro’s raging
thought. “If I had known that, I’d
have slain Surp before ever I allowed
myself to be cast into this awful im-
mortality.”

  “If I could be a man for but one
hour again,” came the furious thought
of another, “I would use that hour to
kill Surp, slowly. To betray the hopes
of us who have waited such eternities
for release!”

  Crain felt the same wild, surging
desire to get his hands on Surp’s
throat. A desire that drove him to cry
out a desperate mental question.

  “Is there no way in which we can
become real again?”

  “No way, newcomer,” somberly
thought a nearby Electrae. “Only the
forces of the altar in the temple can
make us men again.”

  A faint shadow of hope entered
80	STARTLING STORIES

Crain’s mind. If it were possible to
communicate with Mara—

  His idea was perceived and under-
stood by the Electrae in the nothing-
ness about him. And Skuro answered
him.

  “No, Krayn, we Electrae cannot
communicate with men or women. For
the thought-messages we project are
electrical and the neuro-chemical
brains of human beings cannot receive
them.”

  Crain’s dim hope faded. And the
black tide of horror rolled back across
his soul.

  He fought against it. He, Philip
Crain, must not remain an immaterial,
blind, dumb thing of photons. The
future of both Earth and Mars de-
pended on him. He must win back to
life somehow! He would win back!

  And in the wake of that wildly des-
perate resolve came rising inspiration.

  “Tell me, Skuro,” he thought ex-
citedly, “could a being whose brain
and nervous system and life are elec-
trical in nature, receive our thought-
messages?”

  Skuro’s answering thought was
doubtful. “I think so, if our thought
was strong enough. But where is
there any such being as that?”

  Hope had flamed up anew in Crain’s
unbodied mind. Hope that even the
awful infinity of dark silence about
him could not extinguish.

  “Listen to me, Electrae!” he cast his
thought excitedly outward. “Gather
near me, and listen. Would you like
to become real, living men again—
now?"

THE answer came back, from far
and near, from scores of Electrae.
“Yes. But what can we do. who are
but phantoms blown upon winds of
darkness?”

  “If I am able to make you men
again, and keep you men,” Crain’s
thought beat forth, “will you promise
to obey me in all things, to follow
wherever I lead?”

  “What mean these questions?” came"
a somberly hopeless thought. “You
can do nothing, newcomer.”

  “I say that I can make you men
again now and keep you men, if my

plan succeeds!” Crain cried mentally.
“Will you agree to follow me, if I

do?”

  “I agree,” answer Skuro promptly.
“I do not believe you can do anything,
but the chance is worth trying.”

  “And I agree to follow you too . . .
And T!” came a chorus of scores of
eager but doubtful thoughts.

  “Then gather close, all of you,”
Crain told them, “and think as I think
—project the message which I pro-
ject, with all your mental force.”
Crain concentrated his mind upon
one thought, one being, one message
that must get through.

  “Kro!” he sent his mental call out
into the darkness. “Kro, can you hear
me? It is your master!”

  And, in unison with him, the hun-
dreds of the Electrae whom he could
sense around him sent that same
excited message streaming forth.
“Kro, your master is calling you!”
Silence then. Silence of thought,
as well as the unbroken silence of
sound. Stillness, and darkness, in
which Crain’s photon body floated.

  He waited, his mind unutterably
tense. Would Kro hear? Kro’s brain
and life were electrical in nature—he
knew that from what Dandor had said.
Could the robot receive the electrical
vibration of thought from the
gathered Electrae?

  “Again!” Crain throbbed fiercely.
“Call again, with all your force!”
Once more, the thought-cry of the
gathered Electrae pulsed into the
darkness.

  “Kro! Your master calls!"

  And then out of the darkness there
came to Crain’s bodiless mind a thin,
far-off thought, the vibration of an
electrical mind, remote and dim as
from another star.

  “Master, I hear you in my mind!”
came that far-off mental cry. “Master,
where are you?”

CHAPTER XIX
The Fight in the Temple

Excitement and a joyous thriii
shot through Philip Crain’s elec-
trical being as the robot's answer
THE PRISONER OF MARS

83

came. His desperate hope had been
justified. Kro’s electrical brain and
being were able to receive the elec-
trical thought-waves of the Electrae.

  Crain called back mentally to the
robot, and all the hundreds of Elec-
trae gathered around him helped pro-
ject that thought in unison.

  “Kro, where are you?” he called.
“In the gardens, Master, where you
left me,” came the robot’s answer. “I
have been waiting here four days.”
“Four days!” Crain felt a shock of
surprise, at learning that so much
time had passed since he had been
cast among the Electrae.

  “Yes, Master,” Kro was replying.
“I have waited here, just as you last
ordered me. No one has seen me, but
I saw many thousands of men and
Worms, with other equipment, being
shot from the great matter-caster in
the plaza. Surp and Lanu and their
followers went first, and thousands of
others after them."

  Crain felt an agony of apprehen-
sion. He was too late, then, to stop
the attack upon Earth. By now, Surp
and Lanu with their forces were prob-
ably already driving across Earth to-
ward the sea, to set up their myriad
matter-casters. That invasion must
be taking place even now, while he
floated as a phantom thing of light.

  Desperate determination replaced
Crain’s despair. It might not be too
late for him to act. That plan of his
that would mean life for both Earth
and Mars—he still might be able to
put it into effect, if he could win back
from his present immaterial state.

  “It is night now, Master,” Kro was
calling. “What shall I do?"

  “Stay there, Kro,” Crain projected.
“Keep your mind calling, and I shall
try to come to you.”

  And Crain cried mentally to the
Electrae: “We must go to the robot,
comrades. You said it was possible
to move a little at will, Skuro?”

  “Yes, Krayn,” came Skuro’s excited
thought. “By projecting electrical
mental emanations, and using their
slight reaction to propel our photon
bodies, we can move slowly in any di-
rection if the magnetic currents are
not too strong.”

  “All together, then—toward the
robot!” Crain told them.

  He felt the darkness around him
alive with faint waves of electrical
force as the Electrae sought to drive
^hemselves toward the robot whose
mental call came steadily through the
darkness.

  Crain felt himself floating slowly
in that black lightlessness and silence.
He had no idea of directions, but after
a time the robot’s mental call came
much stronger and clearer.

  “You are beside me now, Master!”
Kro reported mentally. “Hundreds of
Electrae, swarming all around me in
the gardens.”

  “Good!” Crain's thought beat forth.
“Now you must go to the window of
the Princess Mara’s apartment in the
east wing of the palace, Kro. Be care-
ful that none sees you.”

THEN came Skuro’s puzzled men-
tal question.

  “What are you planning, Krayn?”
“Only the altar’s rematerializing
force can make us men again,” Crain’s
thought answered swiftly. “Mara can
turn that force on—if she will.”
“Why not have the robot himself
turn on the force?” another of the
Electrae asked excitedly.

  “He could not enter the temple. The
guards would destroy him on sight.
But Mara, who is of the royal blood,
can enter.”

  Sharply clear came Kro’s mental
voice.

  “I am at the window of the princess'
apartment. Master! Ligor is with her."

  “Ligor!” Crain thought, the bitter
hate he felt for Surp’s son flaming up
in his disembodied mind.

  “Yes, Master,” Kro told him. “Ligor
is telling the princess that since he is
now regent of Bara, she had better
surrender to his love. Mara answers
angrily that he presumes upon his po-
sition, and that when Lanu returns,
she will have him punished.

  “Ligor laughs at this, Master. He
says that Lanu will never return, but
will die on Cholu, and that Surp will
return as king. He says also that if
she is still thinking of the impostor
Krayn who is now among the Electrae,
82

STARTLING STORIES

she might as well forget him, since
Surp does not mean ever to release the
Electrae. Mara orders Ligor out of her
apartment and he goes, laughing. Left
alone, Mara sinks into a chair and
weeps.”

  At this relation of Kro’s, deep emo-
tion shook Crain’s mind. Mara weep-
ing—for him?

  "Enter the apartment now, Kro,”
Crain ordered tensely. “Tell the
princess that you bring a message
from me.”

  Interminable waiting, then again
Kro’s mental call came loud.

  “I am in the apartment, Master.
The princess was frightened of me at
first, but she knows now that you are
speaking to her through me. She is
looking out at the hovering swarm of
Electrae outside her window.”

  Crain could almost see that scene—
Mara leaning forth, gazing at the fire-
fly swarm, one of whose shining phan-
toms was Crain himself.

  “Tell her,” he called tensely, “that
she must go to the temple and turn on
the rematerializing force in the altar
—that that is the only way I can re-
turn to life.”

  Kro’s answer came soon. “I have
told her, Master. And she is troubled.
She says, ‘Krayn, I love you, and
would give my life to bring you into
life again, but I fear that you mean
to wreck the great plan that will re-
vive Bara, that you mean to work
against my world.’ ”

  “Tell her that Bara, as much as
Cholu, is my world!” Crain exclaimed
mentally. “That I have a plan that
will benefit both worlds, instead of
devastating one to save the other.”
Again, Kro’s answer came quickly.
“She says, ‘I will do what you ask,
Krayn. I go now to the temple to turn
on the altar.’”

  Emanations of tense excitement
throbbed from the Electrae around
Crain. Desperate eagerness of sha-
dowy phantoms who sensed a chance
to live again.

  “The princess and I are hurrying'
around the dark plaza, Master,” Kro
reported. “No one has seen us yet.”
“We must follow!” Crain cried
mentally to the hordes of Electrae.

AND desperately he projected his
electrical mental waves to propel
him after the robot and Mara. The
emanations of the Electrae told him
that they, too, were moving with him.
And the thoughts of Kro came louder
again, proving that they were follow-
ing the princess and the robot closely.

  “We are at the entrance of the tem-
ple, Master,” came the robot’s thought.
“The guards have halted us. Mara
orders them to stand aside, but their
officer has seen the swarms of Elec-
trae who follow us, and he hesitates.
He says it is unprecedented for any-
one to enter the temple at this hour
of night, and that he should consult
the regent Ligor.

  “Mara threatens the officer,” Kro
continued swiftly. “She reminds him
she is of the blood royal, and haugh-
tily she dismisses him and his guards.
The officer gives way to her com-
mands, and marches away with his
men.

  “Now we enter the temple, Master.
There are countless hundreds of
Electrae swarming around us. The
princess has gone to the metal stand-
ard beside the altar. She quickly sets
the little wheels that control it. Sud-
denly, a great shaft of bright red force
shoots up from the altar—”

  And Crain’s bodiless mind, at that
moment, felt that sudden rush of force
from the altar, the rematerializing
vibrations. He felt them drawing him
toward them, like a powerful magnet.

  He sensed himself floating toward
the source of that surging force, like
a chip drawn into a whirlpool. Then
came a terrific, clashing shock of force
through the photons of his electric
being. He felt wrenching, rasping
agony—and could have cried aloud
with joy that he could feel that pain.
A tremendous force seemed to strain
his being. Then there was a bumping
fall upon a hard surface, a roaring in
his ears, a blaze of bright red light in
his eyes—

  He was real again! Crain was stand-
ing, solid and material, beside the
blazing shaft of red force that sprang
from the altar in the vast, dark temple.

  “A man again!” he choked. “Thank
God, I’m out of the Electrae!”
THE PRISONER OF MARS

83

  Mara came running toward him, her
face deathly white, tears in her dark
eyes.

  “Krayn!” she cried, then she was
sobbing in his arms.

  He held her close for a moment, still
shaken by the shock of rematerializa-
tion.

  Around the blazing red shaft, count-
less hundreds of glowing Electrae
were swirling wildly. One by one,
they were floating into the red force.

  And out of the red force, appearing
first as misty phantoms and then as
real, solid people, came men. First to
appear after Crain was a huge, brawny
soldier in helmet and metal tunic, his
battered face transfigured with joy.

  “Real again!” he cried jubilantly.
“I, Skuro, a living man once more
after thirty years in that hell!”

  “Skuro, remember the promise you
all made!” Crain cried. “That you
would follow me, and obey my orders,
after you were rematerialized.”

  Skuro wrenched loose a metal post
from a nearby railing, and swung it
like a great mace, his eyes flaring.

  “Lead me anywhere!” he roared.
“I’ll follow to hell itself!”

OTHER men, by dozens, by scores,
were appearing in the crimson
shaft of force, staggering out of it,
gazing wildly around. There were
women, too, from the Electrae. All
took up Skuro’s cry.

  Kro had come clanking forward,
and the robot stood silent with lens-
eyes calmly fixed upon Crain.

  “Kro, without you we’d never have
won free!” Crain exclaimed, with
heartfelt gratitude.

  “What now, Krayn?” Mara was ask-
ing tensely. “Ligor still rules Bara,
as regent."

  “We’ll rematerialize enough of the
Electrae to overcome him,” Crain ex-
claimed, his dark, lean face eager.
“Then we’ll flash to Earth—”

  “Master, I hear men coming!” Kro
rasped suddenly.

  The doors of the shadowy temple
burst open. Armed guards burst in,
with Ligor at their head. His hand-
some face went white with rage as he
saw Crain with Mara.

   “See, it is as I feared!” the officer
beside him cried. “The princess is
releasing some of the Electrae!”

  Raging, Ligor drew the gas-gun at
his belt. But before he could level it,
the giant Skuro flung the metal mace
in his hand. It struck Ligor’s temple
and the young regent went down
stunned.

   “Forward, men!” Crain yelled to the
Electrae-men who had already rema-
terialized from the brilliant shaft of
force.

  With a hoarse, crazed shout, the
Electrae-men leaped forward upon
the astounded guards.

   Gas-guns flashed out in the guards’
hands, and chuffed with deadly quick-
ness. Little clouds of green vapor
flicked through Crain’s charging men,
burning through them as though they
were men of paper.

  But unstopped by that, Crain’s un-
leashed, unarmed force charged on.
They reached the guards before a sec-
ond volley could be fired. And then it
was hand-to-hand, with no room to use
the gas-guns, a staggering conflict of
guards and Electrae-men, by the door
of the dusky temple.

  Crain struck like a madman, con-
scious that he was fighting for both
Bara and Earth. The sheer physical
joy of being real again, after that hor-
rible interval as an electric phantom,
made him laugh fiercely as his fists
smashed home on terrified, Martian
faces.

   Beside Crain, towered the great ro-
bot, and Kro’s metal fists were dealing
death. And the Electrae-men, released
from years of shadowy nothingness,
were insane in the fury of their attack.

  The guards could not stand against
that terrific assault. The remainder
of them turned and fled from the
temple.

  Crain turned, panting. More and
more of the Electrae-men had
emerged from the rematerializing
force during the fight. Hundreds of
them were now in the temple, beside
the frantically rejoicing women who
had come through with them.

  “We have enough men now to hold
the city!” Crain exclaimed. “Turn
off the altar force, Mara.”
84

STARTLING STORIES

AS THE princess obeyed, as the
crimson shaft died, Skuro cried
to Crain, “But what of our friends,
our families, still in the Electrae?
Are they not to be released, too?”
“They shall all be released, every
one, when my plans for Bara are
achieved,” Crain grimly assured.
“There would not be enough food for
them all on Bara now. But if you
follow me and help me win my goal,
Bara will be able to support them all,
and all will be freed.”

  “You hear, comrades?” roared
Skuro’s bull voice. “We fight now for
the release of the other Electrae!”

  A tremendous shout went up from
the hundreds of Electrae-men.

  “We follow wherever you lead,
Krayn!”

  Kro had grasped Ligor, who was
rising dazedly from the floor.

  “Shall I kill him, Master?” the robot
asked.

  "Yes, death for Surp’s son!” fiercely
shouted the Electrae-men.

  “No, do not kill him,” Crain or-
dered. “But see that he does not es-
cape."

  Mara’s slender figure came flying
through the milling throug to Crain’s
side.

  “Krayn, what do you plan?” she
asked eagerly.

  “We must go to Earth—to Cholu,”
Crain said, swiftly. “We must save
Lanu from being killed by Surp, if it
is not too late. And we must over-
throw Surp, once and for all.”

  “And then?” Mara asked anxiously.
“You will hurl the water of Cholu to
Bara, then?”

  Crain shook his head firmly. “No,
Mara. I will not take one drop of
Earth's seas for this world. But I
will make Bara green and fertile
again, by other means. Will you
trust my promise to do that?”

  Mara’s dark eyes were filmed with
doubt.

  “I do not see how you can revive
Bara without taking Cholu’s water,”
she said. “But I trust you. Krayn.”
“Now to the matter-caster in the
plaza!” Crain called to his eager
Electrae-men.

  They emerged with a shout from

the temple. Dawn was breaking over
Ingomar, the sky paling and flushing
pink, washing the rosy towers with
deepened color.

  The guards who had been posted
around the colossal matter-caster in
the plaza, had fled. Tempestuous
excitement was stirring through the
city, but Crain paid it no heed.

CHAPTER XX
Two Brothers

GRIMLY Crain ordered some
hundreds of his men, partly
armed now with gas-guns of the fallen
guards, onto the matter-caster’s tre-
mendous crystal disk. Then with the
remaining Electrae-men, Mara ac-
companying him and Kro following
with the captured Ligor, Crain led the
way toward the massive switch-board
aid voice-cone that towered in the
plaza near the disk.

  “You are to remain on guard at this
switchboard,” Crain told his detach-
ment of Electrae-men. Swiftly he ex-
plained to them its operation. “We
others go now to Earth.”

  “You have forgotten one thing,
Choluan,” Ligor sneered. “My
father’s men will be in charge of the
matter-caster on Cholu. Do you think
they will turn it on at your request?”
“That’s why you are with us, Ligor,”
Crain said tightly. “You are going to
call the Baran base on Earth, and ask
that the matter-caster be turned on to
receive us.”

  Ligor laughed scornfully. “I sup-
pose that you mean to kill me if I re-
fuse? Then kill me, half-breed, for

I	will never do it.”

  “No, we won’t kill you,” Crain said,
and his voice and eyes were deadly.
“We’ll just turn you into an Electra,
if you refuse.”

  “Aye!” fiercely shouted the Elec-
trae-men. “Make of Surp’s son what
his father’s trickery made of us!”
Ligor was not a coward. But he
blanched at the threat of that doom
that a Baran feared above all else. He
had a trapped look.
THE PRISONER OF MARS

  “Well?” snapped Crain.

   “I’ll—do it,” Surp’s son said thickly.
“Turn on the voice-cone.”

  The great transformers hummed
with power, and Ligor called up into
the cone.

  “Ligor calling! I am coming
through to Cholu. Have your ma-
chine ready to receive me.”

  Minutes later, the astonished an-
swer came back. “But you were to
stay on Bara as regent, sir—”

  “I’m coming through!” Ligor hec-
tored. “Do as I order!”

  When the reply finally came, it was
obsequious. “Matter-caster now on to
receive, sir.”

  Crain jumped back up onto the huge
crystal disk, where Skuro and his host
of impatient Electrae-men waited. At
Crain’s command, Kro followed, grip-
ping Ligor’s arm.

  “I’m going with you!” Mara de-
clared.

  “You mustn’t, Mara!” Crain ex-
claimed. “There’ll be fighting on
Earth—you won’t be safe!”

  “Does a princess of Bara think only
of safety?” she demanded, dark eyes
flashing. “I go!”

  Crain raised his hand in signal to
the Electrae-men stationed at the
switchboard. He saw them fling the
switches over as he had instructed
them.

  The transformers droned deafen-
ingly, the great disk under them
shimmered with glowing blue light,
as the first switches were thrown.
Mara pressed close to Crain, trembling
a little, but her dark head was held
steadily erect.

  The last switch clashed shut— and
a terrific upburst of force hurled Crain
and his companions on the disk into
nothingness. He experienced, as be-
fore, only the sensation of racing,
rocketing, speeding, back through the
black gulf of space toward Earth . . .

THE crashing shock of conscious-
ness smote Philip Crain. He
opened his eyes to a blaze of hot after-
noon sunlight. The sunlight of
Earth!

  He and his companions, his host of
Electrae-men, stood upon the vast

crystal disk of a matter-caster identi-
cal with that which had hurled them
across the void. Nearby, at the switch-
board of the great machine, a company
of Baran soldiers gaped at this angry-
eyed throng that had suddenly ap-
peared where they had expected only
Ligor.

  In that first moment of stricken
silence, Crain’s swift glance showed
him that the Canadian forests had
been destroyed for an area of a mile
around. Upon this raw new plain
rose great piles of Martian equipment,
and newly-erected metal huts and
barracks.

  “Gods of Bara, who are these?” the
officer at the switchboard was shout-
ing.

  “They’re enemies of Surp!” Ligor
yelled frenziedly, squirming from
Kro’s grip. “They made me call you!
Attack them!”

  The officer uttered a loud cry.

  “Guards!” he called toward the bar-
racks.

  But already Philip Crain was shout-
ing orders to his own men. The Elec-
trae-men had sprung off the disk, and
were rushing to meet the Baran
soldiers running from the barracks.

  A crazy battle spread like flame
around the huge matter-caster. Gas-
guns chuffed, deadly vapor clouds
swirled through the melee, hoarse
voices shouted.

  Crain had used his gas-gun to blow
deadly clouds through the oncoming
soldiers from the barracks, until the
weapon was exhausted. He sprang
into the fight, using the silvery tube
as a bar, striking right and left.
Enemy could hardly be told from
friend in that mad conflict.

  Martians, at death-grips here in the
sunlight of Earth! And all of them,
Crain noticed even in the wild whirl
of the fight, moved heavily, with
difficulty, weighed down by the
greater gravitation of the larger
planet and breathing noisily in its
thicker atmosphere.

  “Fight!” the giant Skuro was shout-
ing in a bull roar to his companions.
“Remember, we fight for the freedom
of the Electrae!”

  “For the Electrae!” went up the
8G

STARTLING STORIES

fierce battle-cry of the men who them-
selves had been electric phantoms
only a few hours before.

  The Martian base had been guarded
by only a thousand men. And though
this was a greater number than Crain’s
force, what the Electrae-men lacked
in numbers they made up in sheer
ferocity.

  The soldiers crumpled under the
tigerish attack of the Electrae-men.
And in the forefront of the attack,
striding like a metal colossus, smash-
ing right and left, Kro the robot was
killing.

  The soldiers began to throw up their
hands in surrender. A few surviving
officers had already fled to a half-
dozen Worms parked nearby, and
were racing away southward. Except
for a few scattered combats, the fight
was over.

  Anxiously Crain ran back to where
Mara stood near the matter-caster.

OU’RE all right?” he asked
anxiously.

  Her face was pale and drawn. “Yes
—but I feel heavy, hardly able to
stand,” she gasped.

  “It’s the greater gravitation—you’ll
soon become used to it,” he assured
her.

  Crain whirled around as from near-
by came a sharp, excited cry.

  “Philip! Philip Crain!”

  From one of the metal huts, several
men were running. He recognized
John Martin’s massive face, and the
red head of Scott Fulton. Then he
saw Kay.

  And behind them stumbled another
man, in soldier’s metal under a crim-
son cloak. Lanu! Crain felt a strange
throb of gladness that he had been in
time to save his half-brother.

  John Martin’s face was ghastly as
he reached Crain, his eyes feverish as
be poured out information.

  “There’s a terrible invasion of
Earth going on, Philip! The main
Martian forces, under that noble
Surp, are driving headlong toward the
sea. Thousands of them, hundreds of
those Worms, are pushing down
through New York State now! We’ve
got the radio reports—”

  Kay was crying. Her face was no
longer the stiff, hypnotized mask it
had been when Crain last saw it.

  “And I did it, Philip!” she sobbed.
“I called Father to open the matter-
caster here, and the advance guard of
the Martians came through with me.
But I didn’t know what I was doing!”
“Of course she didn't!” exclaimed
Scott Fulton, his arm around the sob-
bing girl. “Her mind was a blank,
when she came through with those
Martians. But a few days ago, she be-
came normal.”

  Crain suddenly understood. When
the Brain had been killed, far out
there on Mars, its remorseless hypno-
tic grip upon Kay had been abruptly
relaxed.

  Lanu came stumbling up, moving
heavily, his face white as death.

  “Krayn! My brother!” he cried.
“You were right about Surp. He is a
traitor! Once our expedition reached
this world, Surp had his men secretly
seize me and prison me in that hut
with these Choluans. One of your
men just released us. Surp gave out
that I was ill, that I had deputed com-
mand of the host to him. But he left
orders that I was to be killed when
the main Baran host was far enough
away that it would not hear about it.”
“What are you going to do, Philip?”
John Martin demanded. “That Mar-
tian drive toward the sea must be
stopped, and all Earth’s forces can’t
stop it. The weapons of Earth’s de-
fenders are useless, the radio said.”
“I’ve got a plan,” Crain told them
swiftly. “I’ve got to get to the main
Baran army, confront Surp and—”
“Krayn, look out!" Mara screamed.
Crain whirled. Ligor, forgotten
during the wild conflict, stood not ten
yards away. He held a gas-gun in his
hand, levelled at Crain. Kro was rac-
ing toward Ligor, but was still yards
from him.

  “At least I’ll send you out of life,
impostor!” Ligor snarled, and pulled
the trigger.

  The little cloud of deadly vapor
shot toward Crain. But Lanu was
plunging headlong, thrusting Crain
out of the path of the deadly disinte-
grating gas.
THE PRISONER OF MARS

87

THE cloud touched Lanu’s side.
The Baran king fell heavily.
Crain heard Mara scream, as he re-
gained his balance. He saw Kro
reach Ligor at that same moment, saw
the robot’s metal fist crash down upon'
Ligor’s skull—and shatter it.

  Crain sprang to Lanu. There was
a great, gaping opening in the king’s
side. His crimson cloak and metal
tunic and the tissues of his body were
eaten away there where the deadly
vapor had touched him.

  “Lanu!” Crain cried hoarsely.

  Lanu’s face—that face so weirdly
identical with Crain’s own—was
waxy, but his large, dark eyes stared
up into his half-brother’s face.

  ‘‘I could not let that upstart kill
you, brother,” Lanu whispered. “I
owed you that, for having disbelieved
you and sent you into the Electrae.”
Crain’s voice was choking. “Lanu,
you mustn’t die! We’re going to
overthrow Surp, and I have a plan
that will revive Bara without harm-
ing Cholu. You’ll sit upon the throne
of a new, green, populous Bara.”

  “No,” Lanu whispered weakly. “I
feel the life running out of me.” His
fingers fumbled feebly at the collar of
his cloak. “You must wear the royal
crimson now, Krayn. For I bequeath
the kingship to you. And I bequeath
to you my vengeance on Surp.”

  The dying man's eyes seemed to
stare around in an effort to discover
another face.

  “Mara,” he murmured.

  The princess knelt beside him, her
eyes tear-bright.

  “Yes, Lanu. Yes?”

  His eyes clung to her face, strangely
wistful. “Mara — ” he murmured
again. Then his body twitched, his
face froze.

  “Dead!” said John Martin.

  Mara was weeping. Crain rose to
his feet, his mind a whirl of emotions.
He helped the others pick up Lanu’s
limp body and carry it toward the
metal hut that had been their prison.

  As they laid Lanu’s body down, a
little radio set in the hut—one that
Cram recognized as part of their ori-
ginal camping equipment—was vibrat-
ing to an announcer’s hoarse voice.

  “Newark giving further bulletins
on the invasion. The main force of the
mysterious invaders is now heading
south. They have just left Albany,
and are heading down the Hudson
River valley toward New York. All
resistance to them has proved futile,
for within a hundred mile radius of
them, no powder will explode, no
gasoline motor will operate, no air-
plane or tank or automobile or firearm
can be used.

  “There has been no great loss of life
so far, since at Albany, as at Kingston
and Syracuse and Utica, the popula-
tion has fled out of the path of the in-
vader’s advance. But we beg all in
the country to believe us when we
say that this invasion is real! It is
not another hoax, as most of the
country seems to believe! We im-
plore the population of the Hudson
River valley and of New York to be-
lieve, and to flee at once!”

  “You hear?” John Martin cried.
“Most of the country still doesn’t
believe in the invasion, thinks it an-
other radio hoax. And when that at-
tack reaches New York city—all those
millions—”

  “Surp and his host must not reach
New York!” Crain exclaimed.
“They’re driving for the sea. to set up
the matter-casters that will hurl water
to Bara. But I can stop them, if I can
reach them in time.”

HE stooped, took the royal crim-
son cloak from Lanu’s dead
form and flung it around his own
shoulders. Then he leaped toward
the door of the metal hut.

  “I’m going after them, in a Worm.
There’s no time to lose. Come on,
Kro."

  The great robot sprang to obey.
But Mara stumbled out into the sun-
light after them.

  “I go too, Krayn!” she cried.

  He started to deny her, then saw by
her set white face and flashing eyes
that it would be useless.

  “Come on, then, Mara,” he said.
“You will be of help when I face
Surp’s army!”

  The robot clanked rapidly toward
one of the remaining Worms. There
88

STARTLING STORIES

 were only two—the others had been
 used by the escaping officers of Surp
 for flight.

    “Skuro,” Crain called to the giant
  Electrae-man, “you and ten of your
  men go with me in the Worm. The
  rest of you remain here and guard the
  matter-casters and these Choluans.”

   Mara climbed into the Worm with
 Crain. Skuro and ten of his Electrae-
 men followed. They hastily took
 their places at the breeches of the big
 gas-guns with which their war-vehicle
 was equipped.

    “Start, Kro!” Philip Crain ordered
  the robot. “Follow the trail of Surp’s
  army.’'

   The Worm shot forward. It slid
 like a racing metal snake across the
 raw plain that had been gouged from
 the forest.

    From this devastated area, a broad
  swathe led southeastward through the
  towering Quebec forest, a highway
  hundreds of feet wide that had been
  slashed from the woods by the passing
  of Surp’s host. Trees and brush had
  been cleared by gas-guns, and the
  earth had been tramped down by hun-
  dreds of passing Worms—a trail that
  no one could miss.

   Upon this wide, raw highway the
 single Worm rushed through the
 ' warm late afternoon sunlight. Racing
 at full speed to overtake Surp and his
 host, hundreds of miles ahead. Speed-
 ing on through the sunset and the
 dusk, with a great robot at its con-
 trols and a half score of newly-
 materialized Electrae for crew, bear-
 ing Philip Crain and the Baran prin-
 cess on.

   ■ ■

CHAPTER XXI

The Ambush

 UNLIGHTED structures stood out
 in the brilliant midnight moon-
 light, a mass of black.

   “That’s Utica,” Philip Crain de-
 clared tautly, peering through the
 window in the nose of the Worm.
 “Surp’s army is still far ahead of us.
 We must go faster, Kro!”

  “We can go no faster. Master,” re-
plied the robot in his imperturbable
metallic voice.

  Mara’s hand closed on Crain’s taut
fingers. “We shall overtake them by
morning, Krayn, surely.”

  “By morning Surp’s army will be
crashing into New York,” he said raw-
ly. “That mustn’t happen!"

  Crain’s mind was feverish with min-
gled apprehension and hope. All dur-
ing the night, as the Worm had raced
at top speed down through the Can-
adian countryside and into New York
state, his fears had tormented him.

  For, they had had evidence of how
the Martian drive was crashing
through all resistance. Every city and
village they had passed through had
been dark and deserted. From the
Canadian hills, from Kingston, where
they had crossed the St. Lawrence,
from all the small cities and country-
side of upper New York, the popula-
tion had fled east and west from the
Martians.

  Crain had learned, from a radio
loudspeaker still shouting in deserted
Kingston, that Surp's army was driv-
ing straight down the Hudson River
valley from Albany. The newspapers
and radio stations were still trying to
convince the country that this incred-
ible invasion was real, and not another
radio scare. And the War Depart-
ment was still frantically trying to
find a way to overcome the mysterious
influence that made all Earthly weap-
ons useless within a hundred miles of
the invaders’ army.

  “It’s the weapon that the Brain de-
vised for Surp, the thing called an
anti-catalyzer, that’s causing that!”
Crain had exclaimed. “I understand,
now. The thing emits a field of force
that inhibits and slows down all chem-
ical activity within a hundred miles.
That’s why explosives in its field only
burn slowly instead of exploding, and
it’s why gasoline motors won’t work.”
“But why doesn’t the inhibiting
field prevent the gas-guns of the
Barans from working?” Mara had
wondered.

  “The gas-guns utilize a physical,
not a chemical principle,” Crain had
reminded her. “The vapor from them
THE PRISONER OF MARS

89

doesn’t combine chemically with sub-
stances, but simply dissolves them.”

  Now, as the lightless structures of
Utica loomed ahead, Crain was feeling
a rising hopelessness.

  “If they get to New York City,” he-'
muttered, “all the millions there, still
believing the invasion a hoax—”

  Kro was driving the Worm through
the outskirts of darkened Utica, into
the business section. Weirdly dark
and deserted in the moonlight lay the
once bustling city. A few sections of
it had been destroyed by the gas-guns
of Surp’s host.

  “Kro, look out!” Crain yelled sud-
denly.

  Two Worms had darted suddenly
from a dark side street, their gas-guns
jetting vapor at Crain’s vehicle.

  The robot’s super-sensitive mind
had perceived the peril before Crain
had. Kro whirled their Worm aside
like lightning, in time to avoid the
deadly little clouds of vapor.

  “It’s an ambush!” Crain cried. “Surp
set this trap for us! He must know
we’re trying to overtake him!”

ITH yells Skuro and the other
Electrae-men reached for the
breeches of their big gas-guns.

  “We must fight it out!” Crain
shouted. "They’ll destroy us easily if
we try to get away.”

  Then began a weird, unearthly bat-
tle in that moonlit, deserted Utica
street. Battle of one Martian machine
against the two others that sought to
destroy it.

 Again the attacking Worms
launched gas charges at Crain’s ma-
chine. Again, it leaped clear of them
by grace of Kro’s speed at the con-
trols. The robot, with his super-swift
sensory reactions, was fighting a bat-
tle no man could have fought.

  Skuro and his men launched deadly
green clouds at their antagonists, and
missed. The vapors struck a nearby
office building, whiffed away its first
floor. Upper floors crashed down with
a roar of falling masonry.

Like battling serpents the three
Worms poised, the one facing the two.

In the moonlight, the machines looked
like great struggling snakes.

  “They separate, Krayn!” Mara cried
as the two enemy machines began to
glide apart.

  “They mean to catch us from both
sides,” Crain said tautly.

   “Be ready,” rasped the robot’s metal
voice. “Aim your guns at the right-
hand Worm.”

  And Kro suddenly darted their ma-
chine at the left-hand enemy. Gas-
clouds puffed from it. But Kro’s strike
had only been a feint. With incred-
ible swiftness, the robot whirled the
Worm around toward the other
enemy. Skuro’s men fired their guns.

  The clouds of green vapor flew
through the moonlight and hit the
right-hand enemy squarely. The
whole middle of that machine was in-
stantly gone, whiffed away by the
gas.

  “That’s one of them gone!” Crain
cried.

   “Krayn, we’re hit!” Mara screamed.

  The remaining enemy, as Kro fin-
ished the unexpected maneuver, had
fired again. The whole tail of Crain’s
Worm was suddenly gone. The drone
of its power plant began to die, as vital
connections were severed.

  “Got us!” Crain cried hoarsely.
“Kro—”

  But the robot, understanding the
situation, was already acting. Before
their power had died completely, be-
fore the remaining enemy could get in
another volley, Kro shot their crip-
pled Worm toward the enemy ma-
chine.

  They struck the enemy Worm with
a crash of metal, pinned it against a
building. It struggled vainly to free
itself, unable to use the big gas-guns
at these close quarters.

   “Out, and take them!” Crain shouted.

   Drawing his belt gas-gun, he leaped
out of their crippled machine, fol-
lowed by Kro and the yelling Elec-
trae-men.

  Kro’s great metal hands tore open
the door of the pinned enemy Worm,
with a scream of rending hinges. And
then they were pouring into the
enemy machine.

   That wild hand-to-hand fight inside
the enemy Worm was over in mo-
ments. The Barans were no match for
90

STARTLING STORIES

Crain and his blood-mad Electrae-
men, supported by the robot.

  Crain stood gasping, wiping his
brow, as the last enemy fell beneath
Kro’s smashing metal fists.

  ‘‘We’ll go on in this Worm,” he
panted. "Kro, throw out those dead.”

MARA came flying in, to Crain’s
side.

  “Surp must have learned that we
follow him!” she cried. “How could
he learn?”

  “The officers who escaped the fight
in the base camp, Master,” rasped Kro.
“They fled southward after Surp, and
could have notified him that we are
now on Cholu."

  “That’s it,” Crain exclaimed. “And
Surp will have other ambushes wait-
ing to stop us. And we’ll hardly be
lucky enough to escape another such
trap.”

  Black despair almost claimed Crain.
Near exhaustion, both physical and
nervous, crushed beneath superhuman
responsibility, he was almost ready
to admit defeat. He forced himself
to fight down that feeling.

  “We dare not follow Surp's trail di-
rectly, now, or we’ll be destroyed by
another ambush,” he declared. “We
must leave the path of his army, swing
southward and then eastward, and
approach the Baran army from ahead.
Surp won’t be expecting that.”

  "But that means that we will be
passing through enemy country —
through these Choluan people who
will believe us part of the invaders!”
Mara objected. “They’ll attack us!”

  “We’ll have to chance that,” Crain
said. “It’s a better chance than run-
ning into another ambush. Come on !”

  In a few moments their newly cap-
tured Worm, with Kro at its controls,
was racing through the deserted
streets of Utica. But now instead of
following the trail of the Baran host
eastward toward Albany, they headed
south.

  In the moonlight, they rushed now
through an untouched countryside. It
was as deserted as the area from which
they had come. Not until they were
east of Binghamton, a few hours be-
fore dawn, did they come on people.

In a small village, excited crowds
were listening in the streets to the
radios' announcements.

  With shrieks of terror, the villagers
fled as the great Martian Worm bore
down on them. Shots rattled off the
Worm as it sped on through the ham-
let. Skuro and his men leaped to the
gas-guns to fire back, but Crain’s com-
mand halted them.

  “No, we do not fire at Earthmen!
They are only defending themselves.
They cannot know our mission, and
they think us enemies.”

  “But they may destroy us!” Skuro
cried.

  “Nevertheless, we don’t fire at
them,” Crain ordered. “In an emer-
gency, fire—but use the purple paraly-
sis beam!” Doubtfully, his followers
acceded to the order.

  Crain knew that from the village
word would be flashing ahead of a
Martian Worm raiding southward.
He had Kro keep their machine off
main roads, circling around villages.

  Dawn was paling the eastern sky
as they swung down through the hills
toward Scranton. The city's streets
were deserted, and a mob of cars and
people was fleeing southward.

  “They’ve been warned of our com-
ing,” Crain muttered. “To the left,
Kro. We must swing eastward across
the river here, toward New York.”

 The Worm rushed through empty
streets toward a bridge across the
Lackawanna River. Crain’s heart sank
suddenly. For across the head of that
bridge steel girders had been piled in
a high, heavy barricade that even the
Worm could not crash through or
climb over. Behind it were khaki-clad
soldiers with mounted machine-guns.
They were already spraying the
Worm with bullets.

  From an airplane, above, a shell
buret near them.

  “Can we try another bridge?” Mara
cried.

  "They’ll all be barricaded,” Crain
said hoarsely. “And we’ve got to get
across the river, quickly.”

  “There is but one thing to do, then,”
Skuro declared. “Blast away the bar-
ricade and the men, with our gas-
guns!”
THE PRISONER OF MARS

91

       CHAPTER XXII
       The Passing of Kro

ONCE more Crain faced a fearful
dilemma. He couldn't order
those soldiers, men of Earth who were
only doing their duty, to be blasted
with their barricade out of the way.
Yet if he didn’t, the Worm would
soon be destroyed by the field-gun
that was now getting the range. Its
shells were falling closer each mo-
ment.

  As he stood irresolute in that mo-
ment of dire decision, Kro acted. The
huge robot tore open the door of the
Worm and plunged outside, a sleep-
gas bomb in one hand.

  “I can clear that barricade, Master!”
the robot’s metallic voice cried.

  “Kro, wait!” Crain cried, but the
robot was already running toward the
bridge. The paralysis ray shot out.

  Kro’s mighty metal body gleamed
bright in the sunrise as he headed for
the high barricade. For a moment,
the soldiers behind the pile of girders
stopped firing, petrified at sight of the
metal monster charging toward them.

  Then they turned their rifles and
machine-guns on the robot. Bullets
rattled off Kro’s massive metal torso
like hail. Shrapnel from bursting
shells showered him. The bomb was
shot out of his hand.

  And Kro kept on going! Kept on,
until he was at the pile of girders.
The metal giant, with his incredible
strength, lifted a great girder from
the pile and threw it aside. He threw
another aside—rapidly clearing away
the tangle of steel.

  Bullets from the soldiers behind the
barrier and the now falling planes
spanged off every part of his metal
body. But working with mad strength,
Kro had already cleared away a part
of the barricade. Crain saw the robot
was staggering now, seemingly badly
hit.

  “Kro, come back!” Crain yelled.
“We can get through now!”

  Guided by Crain's voice, Kro turned
and staggered back to the door of the

Worm. He pitched inside it, fell to
the floor of the vehicle with a clank-
ing crash of metal.

  The door was slammed shut. Crain
had already leaped to the controls,
and he flung on the power. The Worm
shot toward the barricade. Bullets and
shrapnel hailed down on it. Crain
lifted the Worm’s head in cobra fash-
ion, and the vehicle slid like a snake
over the part of the barrier that Kro
had partly cleared, brushing past the
firing soldiers, speeding on across the
bridge.

  Once the bridge was well behind
them, Crain sent the Worm flying at
top speed down the road.

  “Krayn. Kro is hurt!” Mara cried.

  Crain abruptly stopped the Worm
on the empty road and sprang back to
the robot’s side. Kro still lay upon
the floor, with Mara bending over him.

  The robot was horribly mutilated.
Both its lens eyes had been smashed
out by bullets. Fragments of shrap-
nel had torn between the joints of its
metal body.

  Crain knew that the robot’s elec-
trical life was passing. The complex
inner mechanism of Kro’s brain and
nervous system had been damaged be-
yond repair.

  “Kro!” he cried hoarsely. He saw
the robot’s huge metal limbs stir
weakly, heard a fading whisper.

  “Yes—Master—”

  And with that dying whisper, Kro’s
strange life was gone. He lay, an inert
mass of metal.

  “He’s dead,” Mara said, crying. “No
one but Dandor could ever have re-
paired his mechanism.”

CRAIN felt something hot and
stinging in his own eyes. The
faithful metal servant, trying to
answer him with his last dying
strength—

  “I never thought,” Crain said chok-
edly, “that anyone could shed tears
for a robot.”

  He stumbled back to the controls
and sent the Worm flying forward
again, over the open fields now.

  “Look — above us!" cried Skuro,
pointing back and upward through
one of the little windows.
92

STARTLING STORIES

  Crain glanced back and saw four
more airplanes, overtaking them and
dipping toward them with a crescendo
roar.

  “Bombers!” he cried.

  But as he shouted, the roar of the
airplane motors suddenly died. Yet
even with motors dead, the army
bombers dipped desperately toward
them to loose their bombs.

  Huge missiles crashed down all
around the fleeing Worm — great
bombs laden with the most deadly ex-
plosives known to Earthly science.
And the bombs did not explode.
They simply burst open, and the ex-
plosives inside them slowly burned.

  “We’re inside the radius of Surp’s
anti-catalytic field now,” Crain ex-
claimed. “Thank God!”

  With motors dead, the bombers
were drifting toward a landing. Crain
drove desperately on across the flat-
tening New Jersey countryside.

  As they entered the close-clustered
New Jersey suburban cities, they en-
countered roads and streets along
which streamed crowds of terror-
stricken refugees, on foot, on bicycles
or horses, but not in automobiles. Cars
would not operate inside the field of
Surp’s anti-catalyzer.

  The refugee throngs scrambled
aside in wild panic as the Worm
rushed through them. Rifles of march-
ing troops were aimed at them, but
would not fire.

  Crain finally swung the Worm up a
ramp onto the Pulaski Skyway. It,
too, was jammed with outward-fleeing
refugees who shrank back terrifiedly
as the Martian machine came on.

  “See, Krayn—Surp’s armies come!”
Mara cried, pointing through a win-
dow.

  Far northward, a little to the east,
huge plumes of smoke and dust were
rising into the morning sunlight.
Plumes of destruction, marking the
march of the Baran armies southward
onto Manhattan.

  “They’ll be in New York in an
hour!” Crain exclaimed.

  The Worm flew along the Skyway
like a shooting python, through
crowds of screaming refugees, crash-
ing past stalled automobiles. It

seemed an eternity before Crain saw
the entrance of the Holland Tunnel
ahead.

  The tunnel was disgorging a con-
stant stream of refugees on foot. But
no,, cars were emerging, and hardly
any were in the tube, since the anti-
catalytic field has stalled all cars in
the metropolis before the populace
had finally credited the reality of the
incredible invasion, and had started
to flee.

  Crain drove their Worm straight
through the white-tiled tube. Scream-
ing men and women who expected to
be annihilated as the Worm rushed
upon them, flattened themselves on
either side.

  Crain’s eyes were flaming when fin-
ally he drove the Worm out onto
Eighth Avenue.

EW YORK was a maelstrom of
insane panic. Men and women
and children were fleeing toward the
bridges and the tubes. Radios were
bellowing warning like the trumpets
of doom.

  “Leave the city! Leave the city!
The invaders are here!”

  Staring in wonder at the great me-
tropolis and its panic-mad throngs,
Mara pointed northward.

  “Surp’s armies come!”

  Crain saw clouds of green vapor
flashing in the north, and smoke and
dust rising ominously.

  He drove the Worm recklessly
toward that pall of smoke and destruc-
tion that hung north of Manhattan.
By the time they reached Morning-
side Heights, they met no more refu-
gees. But now they met troops —
thousands of khaki-clad regulars and
militia, retreating in disorder, club-
bing their useless rifles.

  Earth’s defenders, retreating before
this oncoming enemy against whom
their weapons were futile! The Worm
brushed through the troops, north-
ward along upper Broadway, toward
the broad expanse of Van Cortlandt
Park.

  “The hosts of Bara!” cried the
Princess Mara.

  In a great line across the city, the
Martian forces were advancing. Hun-

dreds of huge Worms, gliding stead-
ily forward, using their gas-guns to
blow away all the barricades and at-
tempted resistances. And among them
moved two Worms that had slung be-
tween them the huge hemispherical^
anticatalyzer.

  Philip Crain drove the Worm right
into the park, into the front of the
Martian advance. And as he stopped,
the hundreds of Worms all across the
line of battle stopped also, as though
amazed at sight of a comrade coming
from ahead.

  They converged upon Crain’s mo-
tionless machine. Their gas-guns
turned ominously toward it—

  “Surp has ordered them to destroy
us!” Mara cried. “He knows it is
you, Krayn.”

  But Crain had already torn open
the door of the Worm. He was leap-
ing out onto the grass, Mara followed
him.

  As Crain ran toward the Martian
Worms, his royal crimson cloak
flashed brilliantly in the sun. And out
from the halted Worms poured ex-
cited Barans.

  “King Lanu!” they cried amazedly.

CHAPTER XXIII
Crain’s Plan

JUST as if sudden orders had been
given them, the advance of the
Martian host had stopped completely.
Baran officers and men were pouring
forth from the Worms, gazing
amazedly at Crain and Mara.

 And among them was Surp. The
massive noble’s hard face went livid
with rage as he saw Crain. Hate and
fear flared in Surp’s eyes.

  “This is not King Lanu!” he cried
to the astonished Barans. “This is
only a half-breed brother of the king.”

  Philip Crain raised his voice.

“It is true, Barans, that I am not
Lanu, but his brother. Lanu himself
is dead.”

  “Dead?” shouted hundreds of Bar-
ans.

 “Yes, dead!” Crain exclaimed.

“Surp left Lanu in the base camp in
the north, not ill as you supposed, but
a prisoner. And Surp left orders for
Lanu to be killed—for Surp himself
aspires to the throne. His own son,
Ligor, killed the king.”

  Cries of fury went up at Crain’s
charge. Quickly, Surp raised his
voice in a harsh shout of denial.

  “It is not true!” the noble bellowed.
“If the king is dead, this mongrel
brother of his killed him. This half-
breed, half Choluan and half Baran, is
the one who has sought to take Lanu’s
throne, not I.”

“It is true!” cried Princess Mara’s
silver voice. “I saw Ligor kill Lanu
—before Ligor himself was killed.”
“My son dead?” cried Surp. For a
moment, his face was ghastly.

  “Lanu bequeathed the kingship to
his brother Krayn, who stands beside
me," Mara was crying to the Baran
host. “Nobles and soldiers of Bara,
he is your rightful king.”

  Surp stiffened, and he swung to
shout to the bewildered army.

  “Will you believe the princess’
lie?” he roared. “She is in love with
this mongrel, and she probably helped
him kill Lanu so that he could take
the throne. Men of Bara, will you
take this lying half-breed for your
king? Or will you have me for king
—I, who am all Baran, who owe no
loyalty to Cholu but think only of
reviving Bara and freeing the Elec-
trae.”

  The Barans seemed bewildered by
the choice forced upon them. They
stared silently at Surp and at Crain.

  Philip Crain, stung by Surp’s lie,
cried to them with all his strength.

  “Barans, do not believe Surp! He
means never to release the Electrae!
For among the Electrae are hosts of
Surp’s enemies, whom he thrust
among the phantoms by using trick-
ery in the Drawing of the Lots.”

  A roar of inarticulate rage flamed
instantly from the whole Baran host.
Every man among them had for his
dream the freeing of the Electrae. It
was for that they had come upon this
expedition, for that that they had
driven toward Earth’s seas.

  “Is this true, Surp?” cried hundreds
STARTLING STORIES

of infuriated voices.

  “It is true!” Mara declared. “Ligor
himself boasted to me how his father
had for years manipulated the Draw-
ing of the Lots, and bragged that
when Surp was on the throne and
Bara revived, the Electrae would
never be freed.”

SURP tried to deny the deadly
charge, and could not. His face
was terrible, as he saw the structure
of crime and ambition which he had
built for so long tumbling about his
ears. His tortured eyes, swinging al-
most dazedly, rested on Philip Crain.
Hideous hatred blazed in them.

  “At least, mongrel—” he repeated
his son’s words in a choking voice, “I
will take you with me!”

  He was drawing the gas-gun at his
belt. But Crain sprang before the
noble could raise the weapon. That
desperate leap knocked the gas-gun
from Surp’s hand. And then he and
the noble were locked in a death
struggle.

  Crain’s anger-filmed eyes glimpsed
Mara and Skuro staring stonily, and
dimly he heard the cry of the Baran
soldiers. All seemed frozen motion-
less by the spectacle of this swift,
deadly combat.

  Exhausted as he was, Crain felt a
compelling surge of strength. It was
as though memory of Surp’s victims—
of Dandor, and Lanu, and Kro, and
all the others—nerved him. He had
his hands around Surp’s throat and
tightened them. He seemed not to
feel the smashing blows of the massive
Surp. He felt nothing, knew nothing,
but the red flare of rage and hate that
called for satisfaction.

  Then Crain dimly realized that he
was being pulled to his feet, by Skuro
and Mara.

  “Surp!” he croaked.

  “He is dead,” the princess whis-
pered, and shuddered.

  And Crain saw now that Surp lay
motionless, his eyes protruding, his
face purple in death.

  Mara sobbed against Philip Crain
as he stood there, gasping and stag-
gering.

  There was a long, dead silence as

the Baran army stared. Then an offi-
cer spoke to Crain.

  “You, who were Lanu’s brother, are
our rightful king, even though you
are only half of Baran blood,” the
officer declared. “We shall hail you
king, if you will promise not to let
your Choluan blood affect you—if you
will promise to lead on toward the
sea to get the water that Bara needs.”
“No,” declared Crain pantingly, but
squarely meeting the questioning eyes
of the Baran soldiery. “I will not lead
you further. This invasion of Cholu
must cease! We shall not strip away
Cholu’s seas and make it a desert
world so that Bara may live.”

  The faces of the Baran officers and
soldiers before him became hard and
hostile when they heard.

  “We cannot stop now!” exclaimed
the officer who was their spokesman.
“We hate this invasion, this destruc-
tion, as much as you do. We hate, as
you do, to make Cholu a desert. But
Bara comes first! We must get water
for Bara.”

  “But we can get water for Bara
here,” Philip Crain cried earnestly,
“without taking one drop of Cholu’s
water!”

  “How?” asked a hundred skeptical,
incredulous voices.

  “We can take the ice of Cholu for
Bara!” cried Crain.

  His voice throbbed with desperate
eagerness, the eagerness that had filled
him ever since his great inspiration
had come to him. He explained his
plan to the Barans.

PON the polar regions of
Cholu lie trillions of tons of
frozen water. It covers the great Ant-
arctic Continent thousands of feet
thick. It lies as thick upon the vast
island of Greenland, and all the north
polar regions.

  “This ice is harmful to Cholu. It
keeps almost a third of this world
permanently refrigerated, too cold for
human habitation. And it breeds
great, cold storms that scourge this
world, makes the winters bitter, ham-
pers the lives of everyone on Cholu.

  “And this colossal mass of ice,
which Cholu would be far better

without, embodies enough water to
fill the long-dead seas of Bara! Bara
is a much smaller world than this one,
and its seas are not large. The ice of
Cholu, hurled across space by matter-
casters to Bara, will melt into seas'
that will make Bara a green, fertile,
happy world again.

  “Thus both worlds will benefit
equally. Bara, by receiving the water
that will revivify it and make it pos-
sible to release the tragic hordes of
the Electrae. And Cholu, this Earth,
will benefit as much by removal of

“We never wanted to harm this world
We were only striving desperately to
save our own.”

  And a shout of joyful approval went
up from all the Baran host.

  Mara raised a tear-wet, beaming
face to Philip Crain.

  “You have succeeded!” she cried.
“You have done what I deemed impos-
sible—have avoided harming either of
the two worlds, and found a way to
benefit both.”

  Crain felt an enormous reaction
that left him weak and trembling. He

the huge ice-caps which will make

and south polar regions.”

  Philip Crain’s eyes encompassed the
whole silent throng before him.

  “Is such a plan not better, men of
Bara,” he cried, “than to loot the water
of Cholu and leave it a desert, an em-
bittered world?"

  The faces of the Barans flamed with
eagerness.

  “Yes, your plan is far better!” cried
the officer facing him, eyes flashing.

held the Baran princess close.

  “I had to find such a way, Mara,” he
said unsteadily. “Blood of both
worlds is in my veins. I couldn’t be
disloyal to either of them.”

  A tremendous, jubilant shout from
the Baran soldiers beat upon his ears.

  “Hail Krayn, King of Bara!” they
were shouting wildly.

  Crain’s eyes misted. And strangely,
in that moment, his thoughts flashed
far across the years, to a giant man
long dead, who had once stared blindly
and in bafflement at the stars.

CHAPTER XXIV
Epilogue

NIGHT lay over the raw clearing
that had been blasted out of the
Canadian forest. A thousand twin-
kling stars looked down upon the
strange scene that was taking place
there.

  The great matter-caster clisk was
shimmering with blue radiance. Dur-
ing the last days, it had been hurling
the Baran forces, in detachments, back
to their own world, back to the red
spark that glistened brightly in the
star-flecked eastern sky.

  Philip Crain, tall and alien-looking
in his royal Baran costume of crimson
silk and metal, stood near the blazing
disk. Upon the shimmering disk
waited Skuro and a hundred Baran
soldiers. All around the disk, watch-
ing with fascinated eyes were Ameri-
can and Canadian soldiers and offi-
cials.

  Crain was speaking to one of those
officials, the President of the United
States. Close beside Crain was the
Princess Mara; and John Martin, Kay
and Scott Fulton were near.

  “This is the last Baran detach-
ment,” Philip Crain was saying.

  The President nodded earnestly.
“It all seems like a dream, what has
happened,” he said. “First that ter-
rific invasion—then the sudden armis-
tice, the great plan you advanced. No
wonder the world couldn’t believe it,
at first.”

  Crain nodded. It had been an excit-
ing period, these weeks since he had
halted the Martian armies at the very
edge of New York.

  Earth’s officials had at first been in-
credulous, when Crain had informed
them that the invasion had stopped
and that the Martian forces desired an
armistice. The incredulity of Earth’s
governments had been even greater,
when Crain had proposed his great
idea of transferring the vast ice-packs

of earth as water to Mars.

  There had been hasty, excited con-
ferences between Crain and represen-
tatives of all Earth governments. And
when they had found that Crain really
could do the thing he proposed, all
Earth had agreed to the proposals
with unbounded joy and relief.

  The matter-casters which the Mar-
tians had brought to Earth were to be
left here. Earthmen had been trained
in their use, and already the machines
had been set up on the huge ice-caps
of Greenland and the north polar
lands, and upon Antarctica. Upon the
morrow, they would start hurling the
ice to Mars, there to be melted by the
clear sun of Bara into new seas for
that world.

  The damage which the Martians had
done in their drive toward the sea
would be more than compensated by
the removal of the ice from Earth,
the warming of its climate and free-
ing of its ice-locked polar lands, and
by the new scientific devices which
were now opened to Earth’s use. The
fortunate fact that few lives had been
taken by the Martian drive made the
negotiations easier.

  “Earth looks forward to a future of
friendship with Mars,” the President
was telling Philip Crain. “These mat-
ter-casters will make trade and travel
between the two worlds easy. A great
widening of human horizons!”

  John Martin, his face struck with
strange wonder, spoke now to Crain.

  “To think, Philip, that all this came
about from that fake radio broadcast
that you heard with us that night!”

  Kay had not spoken, steadfastly
watching Crain. Now she broke her
silence.

  “And you’re going back to Mars,
Philip?”

CRAIN nodded, his eyes steady on
hers.

  “I must, Kay. I am king of Bara
now—and there is much to do. The
water that will come streaming from
Earth’s ice must be directed into the
proper sea bottoms. The ruined cities
must be rebuilt, and the Electrae re-
leased as soon as possible.” He smiled
down at her. "But I’ll not forget
THE PRISONER OF MARS

97

Earth! My duty calls me to my fa-
ther’s world, but I’ll be coming back
for visits whenever I can.”

  “We will be coming back, Krayn,"
whispered Mara.

  The Baran princess’ dark eyes were
shining, her slim white hand clinging
to Crain’s arm.

  Kay smiled, though there was a
wistful shadow in her eyes.

  “I knew, back there on Bara, that
you loved her, Philip,” said the Earth
girl.

  “Knew it from your face, that night
in the palace when you came back
from her. And I’m glad it turned out
that way.”

  “And so am I glad, Crain!” Scott
Fulton grinned, tucking Kay’s arm in-
side his own. “With you a hundred
or so million miles away, maybe I can
make Kay listen to reason.”

  There was a call from the men at the
switchboard of the great matter-caster
—Earthmen, who from now on would
operate the big machine.

  “All ready to go!”

  “Good-by, all of you!” Crain choked.
  He turned from them unsteadily.

And then tall and commanding in his
brilliant royal cloak, he was moving
with Mara toward the shimmering
disk.

  Skuro and the other Barans waiting
on the disk shouted welcome. And
the fascinated Earth people watch-
ing, saw Crain standing among them,
Mara’s proud, slim figure by his side,
as he waved farewell.

 The switches were flung. The
watchers saw a dazzling blast of force
burst upward from the disk transform-
ing those upon it into shining clouds
that hurtled up and outward at veloc-
ity inconceivable. Outward toward
the starry sky, toward the red spark
eastward, the matter-caster awaiting
them on Bara.

  “He’s gone,” Kay whispered, and
suddenly she was weeping.

  Scott Fulton pulled her closer, com-
fortingly. And John Martin, looking
up at the glittering stars, the stars
from which long years ago the father
of Philip Crain had come, nodded his
great head slowly.

  “Yes, he’s gone,” said Martin slow-
ly. “He’s gone home.”

buildings that loomed around Central

glowing like the cave fires of a city of
Cro-Magnon people. “All is dream,
all is illusion; I am your vision as you

thought through the fumes of liquQr,

tiny figure of his companion. He be-

driven him to leave the party to seek

many.

that wall of masonry; you perceive
only a sensation, a feeling of sight.
The rest you interpret.”

  “You see the same thing,” retorted
Dan.

  “How do you know I do? Even if
you knew that what I call red would
not be green if you could see through
my eyes—even if you knew that, how
do you know that I too am not a dream
of yours?”

  Dan laughed. “Of course nobody
knows anything. You just get what
information you can through the win-
dows of your five senses, and then
make your guesses. When you’re
wrong, you pay the penalty.” His
mind was clear now save for a mild
headache. “Listen,” he said sud-
denly. “You can argue a real thing
away to an illusion; that’s easy. But
if your friend Berkeley is right, why
can’t you take a dream and make it
real? If it works one way, it must
work the other.”

  The beard waggled; elf-bright eyes
glittered queerly at him. “All artists
do that,” said the old man softly. Dan

felt that something more quivered on
the verge of utterance.

  "That’s an evasion,” he grunted.
“Anybody can tell the difference be-
tween a picture and the real thing, or
between a movie and life.”

  “But,” whispered the other, “the
realer the better, no? And if one
could make a—a movie—very real in-
deed, what would you say then?”
“Nobody can, though.”

  The eyes glittered strangely again.
“I can!” he whispered. “I did!”
“Did what?”

  “Made real a dream.” The voice
turned angry. “Fools! I bring it here
to sell to Westman, the camera people,
and what do they say? ‘It isn’t clear.
Only one person can use it at a time.
It’s too expensive.’ Fools! Fools!”
“Huh?”

“W ISTEN! I’m Albert Ludwig—
MA Professor Ludwig.” As Dan was
silent, he continued, “It means noth-
ing to you, eh? But listen—a movie
that gives one sight and sound. Sup-
pose now I add taste, smell, even
touch, if your interest is taken by the
story. Suppose I make it so that you
are in the story, you speak to the sha-
dows, and the shadows reply, and in-
stead of being on a screen, the story
is all about you, and you are in it.
Would that be to make real a dream?”
“How the devil could you do that?”
“How? How? But simply! First
my liquid positive, then my magic
spectacles. I photograph the story in
a liquid with light-sensitive chro-
mates. I build up a complex solution
—do you see? I add taste chemically
and sound electrically. And when the
story is recorded, then I put the solu-
tion in my spectacles—my movie pro-
jector. I electrolyze the solution,
break it down; the older chromates go
first, and out comes the story, sight,
sound, smell, taste—all!”

  “Touch?”

  “If your interest is taken, your mind
supplies that.” Eagerness crept into
his voice. “You will look at it, Mr.

_?” *

  “Burke,” said Dan. “A swindle!”
he thought. Then a spark of reckless-
ness glowed out of the vanishing

fumes of alcohol. “Why not?” he
grunted.

  He rose. Ludwig, standing, came
scarcely to his shoulder. A queer,
gnomelike old man, Dan thought, as
he followed him across the park and
into one of the scores of apartment ho-
tels in the vicinity.

  In his room Ludwig fumbled in a
bag, producing a device vaguely rem-
iniscent of a gas mask, with goggles
and a rubber mouthpiece. Dan exam-
ined it curiously, while the little
bearded professor brandished a bottle
of water liquid.

  “Here it is!” he gloated. “My liquid
positive, the story. Hard photogra-
phy, infernally hard, therefore the
simplest possible story. A Utopia—
just two characters and you, the audi-
ence. Now, put the spectacles on. Put
them on and tell me what fools the
Westman people are!”

  He decanted some of the liquid into
the mask, and trailed a twisted wire
to a device on the table, “A rectifier,”
he explained. “For the electrolysis.”
“Must you use all the liquid?” asked
Dan. “If you use part, do you see on-
ly part of the story? And which
part?”

  “Every drop has all of it, but you
must fill the eye-pieces.” Then as
Dan slipped the device gingerly on,
“So! Now what do you see?”

  “Not a damn’ thing, just the window
and the lights across the street.”

  “Of course. But now I start the
electrolysis. Now!”

  There was a moment of chaos. The
liquid before Dan’s eyes clouded sud-
denly white, and formless sounds
buzzed. He moved to tear the device
from his head, but emerging forms in
the mistiness caught his interest.
Giant things were writhing.

  The scene steadied; the whiteness
was dissipating like mist in summer.
Unbelieving, still gripping the arms
of that unseen chair, he was staring
at a forest. Incredible, unearthly,
beautiful! Smooth boles ascended in-
conceivably toward a brightening sky,
trees bizarre as the forests of the Car-
boniferous age. Infinitely overhead
swayed misty fronds, and the verdure
showed brown and green in the
PYGMALION’S SPECTACLES

103

heights. And there were birds — at
least curiously lovely pipings and
twitterings were all about him, though
he saw no creatures—thin elfin whis-
tlings like fairy bugles sounded soft-
ly-

  He sat frozen, entranced. A louder
fragment of melody drifted down to
him, mounting in exquisite, ecstatic
bursts, now clear as sounding metal,
now soft as remembered music. For
a moment he forgot the chair whose
arms he gripped, the miserable hotel
room. He imagined himself solitary
in the midst of that lovely glade.
“Eden!” he muttered, and the swell-
ing music of unseen voices answered.

SOME measure of reason returned.
“Illusion!” he told himself. Clev-
er optical devices, not reality. He
groped for the chair’s arm, found it,
and clung to it; he scraped his feet
and found again an inconsistency. To
his eyes the ground was mossy ver-
dure ; to his touch it was merely a thin
hotel carpet.

  The elfin buglings sounded gently.
A faint, deliciously sweet perfume
breathed against him. He began to
want to believe that all this was no il-
lusion, that it was true.

  And then, far through the softening
mists, he caught a movement that was
not the swaying of verdure, a shim-
mer of silver more solid than mist.
Something approached. He watched
the figure as it moved, now visible, now
hidden by trees. Very soon he per-
ceived that it was human, but it was
almost upon him before he realized
that it was a girl.

  She wore a robe of silvery, half-
translucent stuff, luminous as star-
beams. Her tiny white feet were bare
to the mossy forest floor as she stood
at no more than a pace from him star-
ing dark-eyed. The thin music sound-
ed again; she smiled.

  Dan summoned stumbling thoughts.
Was this being also—illusion? Had
she no more reality than the loveliness
of the forest? He opened his lips to
speak, but a strained excited voice
sounded in his ears. “Who are you?”

 Had he spoken? The voice had
come as if from another, like the

sound of one’s words in fever.

  The girl smiled again. “English!”
she said in queer, soft tones. “I can
speak a little English.” She spoke
slowly, carefully. “I learned it from”
c-she hesitated—“my mother’s fath-
er, whom they call the Gray Weav-
er.”

  Again came the voicc in Dan’s ears.
“Who are you?”

  “I am called Galatea,” she said. “I
came to find you.”

  “To find me?” echoed the voice that
was Dan’s.

  “Lexicon, who is called the Gray
Weaver, told me,” she explained smil-
ing. “He said you will stay with us
until the second moon from this.
What are you called?”

  “Dan,” he muttered. His voice
sounded oddly different.

  “What a strange name!” said the
girl. She stretched out her bare arm.
“Come,” she smiled.

  Dan touched her extended hand,
feeling without any surprise the liv-
ing warmth of her rosy fingers. He
had forgotten the paradoxes of illu-
sion; this was no longer illusion to
him, but reality, itself. It seemed to
him that he followed her, walking
over the shadowed turf that gave with
springy crunch beneath his tread
though Galatea left hardly an imprint.
He glanced down, noting that he him-
self wore a silver garment, and that
his feet were bare; with the glance he
felt a feathery breeze on his body and
a sense of mossy earth on his feet.

  “Galatea,” said his voice, “Galatea,
what place is this? What language
do you speak?”

  She glanced back laughing. “Why,
this is Paracosma, of course, and that
is our language.”

  “Paracosma,” muttered Dan, “Para-
—cosma!” A fragment of Greek that
had survived somehow from a Sopho-
more course a decade in the past came
strangely back to him. Paracosma!
Land beyond-the-world!

  Galatea cast a smiling glance at
him. “Does the real world seem
strange,” she queried, “after that sha-
dow world of yours?”

  “Shadow land?” echoed Dan, bewil-
104

STARTLING STORIES

dered. “This is shadow, not my
world.”

  The girl's smile turned quizzical.
“Poof!” she retorted with an impu-
dently lovely pout. “And I suppose,
then, that I am the phantom instead of
you!” She laughed. “Do I seem
ghost-like?”

DAN made no reply; he was puzzl-
ing over unanswerable questions
as he trod behind the lithe figure of
his guide. It seemed a mile, perhaps,
before a sound of tinkling water ob-
scured that other strange music. They
emerged on the bank of a little river,
swift and crystalline, that rippled and
gurgled. Galatea bent over the brink
and cupped her hands, raising a few
mouthsful of water to her lips. Dan
followed her example, finding the
liquid stinging cold.

  “How do we cross?” he asked.

  “You can wade up there, but I al-
ways cross here.” She poised herself
for a moment on the green bank, then
dove like a silver arrow into the pool.
Dan followed. The water stung his
body like champagne, but a stroke or
two carried him across to where Gal-
atea had already emerged with a glis-
tening of creamy bare limbs. Her gar-
ment clung tight as a metal sheath to
her wet body; he felt a breath-tak-
ing thrill at the sight of her. And then,
miraculously, the silver cloth was dry,
the droplets rolled off as if from oiled
silk, and they moved briskly on. The
sweet pipings followed them, now
loud, now whisper-soft, in a tenuous
web of melody.

  “Galatea!” said Dan suddenly.
“Where is the music coming from?”

  She looked back amazed. “You silly
one!” she laughed. “From the flow-
ers, of course. See!” She plucked a
purple star and held it to his ear. True
enough, a faint and plaintive melody
hummed out of the blossom. She
tossed it in his startled face and
skipped on.

  Soon they beheld the objective of
their journey—a building of white,
marble-like stone, single-storied and
vine covered, with broad glassless
windows. They trod upon a path of
bright pebbles to the arched entrance

and here, on an intricate stone bench,
sat a gray-bearded patriarchal individ-
ual. Galatea addressed him in a liquid
language that reminded Dan of the
flower-pipings; then she turned. “This
is Leucon,” she said, as the ancient
rose from his seat and spoke in
English.

  “We are happy, Galatea and I, to
welcome you, since visitors are a rare
pleasure here, and those from your
shadowy country most rare.”

 Dan uttered puzzled words of
thanks, and the old man nodded, re-
seating himself on the carven bench;
Galatea skipped through the arched
entrance, and Dan, after an irresolute
moment, dropped to the remaining
bench. Once more his thoughts were
whirling in perplexed turbulence.
Was all this indeed but illusion? Was
he sitting, in actuality, in a prosaic
hotel room, peering through magic
spectacles that pictured this world
about him, or was he, transported by
some miracle, really sitting here in
this land of loveliness?

  “Leucon,” said his voice, “how did
you know I was coming?”

  “I was told,” said the other.

 “By whom?”

  “By no one.”

 "Why—someone must have told
you!”

  The Gray Weaver shook his solemn
head. “I was just told.”

  Dan ceased his questioning, con-
tent for the moment to drink in the
beauty about him, and then Galatea
returned bearing a crystal bowl of the
strange fruits. They were piled in
colorful disorder, red, purple, orange
and yellow, pear-shaped, egg-shaped,
and clustered spheroids — fantastic,
unearthly. He selected a pale, trans-
parent ovoid, bit into it, and was del-
uged by a flood of sweet liquid, to
the amusement of the girl.

ALATEA,” he said, “do you
ever go to a city? What cities
are in Paracosma?”

- “Cities? What are cities?”

  “Places where many people live
close together.”

  “Oh,” said the girl, frowning. “No.
There are no cities here.”
PYGMALION'S SPECTACLES

105

  “Then where are the people of Para-
cosma? You must have neighbors.”
The girl looked puzzled. “A man
and a woman live off there,” she said,
gesturing toward a distant blue range
of hills dim on the horizon. “Far
away over there. I went there once,
but Leucon and I prefer the valley.”
“But Galatea!” protested Dan. “Are
you and Leucon alone in this valley?
Where—what happened to your par-
ents—your father and mother?"

  “They went away. That way—to-
ward the sunrise. They’ll return
some day.”

  “And if they don’t?”

  “Why, foolish one! What could
hinder them?”

  “Wild beasts,” said Dan. “Poison-
ous insects, disease, flood, storm, law-
less people, death!”

  “I never heard those words,” said
Galatea. “There are no such things
here.” She sniffed contemptuously.
“Lawless people!”

  “Not—death?”

  “What is death?”

  “It’s—” Dan paused helplessly. “It’s
like falling asleep and never waking.
It’s what happens to everyone at the
end of life.”

  “I never heard of such a thing as the
end of life!” said the girl decidedly.
“There isn’t such a thing.”

  “What happens, then,” queried Dan
desperately, “when one grows old?”
“Nothing, silly! No one grows old
unless he wants to, like Leucon. A
person grows to the age he likes best
and then stops. It's a law!”

  Dan gathered his chaotic thoughts.
He stared into Galatea’s dark, lovely
eyes. “Have you stopped yet?”

  The dark eyes dropped; he was
amazed to see a deep, embarrassed
flush spread over her cheeks. She
looked at Leucon nodding reflectively
on his bench, then back to Dan, meet-
ing his gaze.

  “Not yet,” she said.

“And when will you, Galatea?”
“When I have had the one child per-
mitted me. You see” — she stared
down at her dainty toes—“one cannot
—have children—afterwards.”

  “Permitted? Permitted by whom?”
  “By a law.”

  “Laws! Is everything here gov-
erned by laws? What of chance and
accidents?”

  “What are those—chance and acci-
dents?”

' “Things unexpected—things un-
foreseen.”

  “Nothing is unforeseen,” said Gala-
tea, still soberly. She repeated slowly,
“Nothing is unforeseen.” He fancied
her voice was wistful.

  Leucon looked up. “Enough of this,”
he said abruptly. He turned to Dan.
“I know these words of yours—
chance, disease, death. They are not
for Paracosma. Keep them in your
unreal country.”

  “Where did you hear them, then?”
“From Galatea's mother,” said the
Gray Weaver, “who had them from
your predecessor—a phantom who vis-
ited here before Galatea was born.”
Dan had a vision of Ludwig’s face.
“What was he like?”

  “Much like you.”

  "But his name?”

THE old man’s mouth was sudden-
ly grim. “We do not speak of
him,” he said, and rose, entering the
dwelling in cold silence.

  “He goes to weave,” said Galatea af-
ter a moment. Her lovely, piquant
face was still troubled.

  “What does he weave?”

  “This.” She fingered the silver
cloth of her gown. “He weaves it out
of metal bars on a very clever machine.
I do not know the method.”

  “Who made the machine?”

  “It was here.”

  “But Galatea! Who built the
house? Who planted these fruit
trees?”

  “They were here. The house and
trees were always here.”

  Dan thought a moment. “Were you
born here?”

  “I don’t know.” He noted in sud-
den concern that her eyes were glis-
tening with tears.

  “Galatea dear! Why are you un-
happy? What’s wrong?”

  “Why, nothing!” She shook her
black curls, smiled suddenly at him.
“What could be wrong? How can
one be unhappy in Paracosma?” She
STARTLING STORIES

sprang erect and seized his hand.
“Come! Let’s gather fruit for to-
morrow.”

  She darted off in a whirl of flashing
silver, and Dan followed her around
the wing of the edifice. Graceful as
a dancer, she leaped for a branch
above her head, caught it laughingly,
and tossed a great golden globe to
him. She loaded his arms with the
bright prizes and sent him back for
the crystal bowl that reposed empty
on the bench, and when he returned,
she piled it so full of fruit that a del-
uge of colorful spheres dropped
around him.

  The little sun was losing itself be-
hind the trees of that colossal forest
to the west, and a coolness stirred
among long shadows. Of a sudden,
the flowers were still, and the brook
gurgled alone in a world of silence.
In silence too, Dan followed Galatea
through a doorway.

  The chamber within was a spacious
one, floored with large black and
white squares; exquisite benches of
carved marble were here and there.
Old Leucon, in a far corner, bent over
an intricate, glistening mechanism,
and as Dan entered he drew a shining
length of silver cloth from it, folded
it, and placed it carefully aside.

  Galatea stood in a doorway to his
left, leaning half-wearily against the
frame; he placed the bowl of fruits
on a bench at the entrance and moved
to her side.

  “This is yours," she said, indicating
the room beyond. He looked in upon
a pleasant, smaller chamber. A single
glowing sphere, pendant by a chain
from the ceiling, illuminated the
room. Dan turned to the girl, whose
eyes were still unwontedly serious.

  “This is ideal," he said, “but, Gala-
tea, how am I to turn out the light?”

  “Turn it out?” she said. “You must
cap it—so!” A faint smile showed
again on her lips as she dropped a
metal covering over the shining
sphere. They stood tense in the dark-
ness; Dan sensed her nearness aching-
ly, and then the light was on once
more. She moved toward the door,
and there paused, taking his hand.

  “Dear shadow,” she said softly, “I

hope your dreams are music.” She
was gone.

  Dan stood irresolute in his cham-
ber; he glanced into the large room
where Leucon still bent over his work,
and the Gray Weaver raised a hand
in solemn salutation, but said nothing.
He felt no urge for the old man’s si-
lent company and turned back into
his room to prepare for slumber.

HE slept. Almost instantly, it
seemed, the dawn was upon him
and bright elfin pipings were all
about him, while the odd ruddy sun
sent a broad slanting plane of light
across the room. He rose as fully
aware of his surroundings as if he had
not slept at all. He emerged into the
central chamber, noting curiously
that the globes still glowed in dim ri-
valry to the daylight. He touched
one casually; it was cool as metal to
his fingers, and lifted freely from its
standard. For a moment he held the
cold flaming thing in his hands, then
replaced it and wandered into the
dawn.

  Galatea was dancing up the path,
eating a strange fruit as rosy as her
lips. She was merry again, once more
the happy nymph who had greeted
him, and she gave him a bright smile
as he chose a sweet green ovoid for his
breakfast.

  “Come on!” she called. “To the
river!”

  She skipped away toward the un-
believable forest. Dan followed.
Then they were laughing in the pool,
splashing about until Galatea drew
herself to the bank, glowing and pant-
ing. Strangely, he was neither tired
nor breathless, with no sense of exer-
tion. A question recurred to him, as
yet unasked.

  “Galatea,” said his voice, “whom
will you take as mate?”

  Her eyes went serious. “I don’t
know,” she said. “At the proper time
he will come. That is a law.”

  “And will you be happy?”

  “Of course.” She seemed troubled.
-“Isn’t everyone happy?”

  “Not where I live, Galatea."

  “Then that must be a strange place
—that ghostly world of yours. A
PYGMALION’S SPECTACLES

107

 rather terrible place.”

   “It is, often enough,” Dan agreed.
 “I wish—” He paused. What did he
 wish? Was he not talking to an illu-
 sion, a dream, an apparition? He
 looked at the girl, at her glistening
 black hair, her eyes, her soft white
 skin, and then, for a tragic moment,
 he tried to feel the arms of that drab
 hotel chair beneath his hands—and
 failed! He smiled; he reached out
 his fingers to touch her bare arm, and
 for an instant she looked back at him
 with startled, sober eyes, and sprang
 to her feet.

   “Come on! I want to show you my
 country.” She set off down the
 stream, and Dan rose reluctantly to
 follow.

   What a day that was! They traced
 the little river from still pool to sing-
 ing rapids, and ever about them were
 the strange twitterings and pipings
 that were the voices of the flowers.
 They talked or were silent. Galatea
 twisted him a bright-blossomed gar-
 land for his head, and thereafter he
 moved always with a sweet singing
 about him. But little by little the red
 sun slanted toward the forest, and the
 hours dripped away. It was Dan who
 pointed it out, and reluctantly they
 turned homewards.

   Galatea sang a strange song, plain-
 tive and sweet, and again her eyes
 were sad.

   “What song is that?” he asked.

   “It is a song sung by another Gala-
 tea,” she answered, “who is my moth-
 er.” She laid her hand on his arm.
 “I will make it into English for you.”
 She sang:

 “The River lies in flower and fern.

    In flower and fern it breathes a song,

 It breathes a song of your return,

    Of your return in years too long.

 In years too long its murmurs bring—

    Its murmurs bring their vain replies.
 Their vain replies the flowers sing,

    The flowers sing, ‘The River Lies!”'

HER voice quavered on the final
notes; there was silence save for
the tinkle of water and the flower bu-
gles. Dan said, “Galatea—” and
paused. The girl was again somber-
eyed, tearful. He said, huskily, “That’s

 a sad song, Galatea. Why was your
 mother sad? You said everyone was
 happy in Paracosma.”

  “She broke the law,” replied the
 girl tonelessly. “It is the inevitable
 'way to sorrow.” She faced him. “She
 fell in love with a phantom!” Galatea
 said. “One of your shadowy race,
 who came and stayed and then had to
 go back. So when her appointed lover
 came, it was too late. Do you under-
 stand ? But she yielded finally to the
 law, and is forever unhappy, and goes
 wandering from place to place about
 the world." She paused. “I shall never
 break a law,” she said defiantly.

  Dan took her hand. “I would not
 have you unhappy, Galatea. I want
 you always happy.”

  She shook her head. “I am happy,”
 she said, and smiled a tender, wistful
 smile.

   They were silent a long time as they
 trudged the way homeward. Leucon
 sat on his bench by the portal.

   “I am very tired,” Galatea said, and
 slipped within.

  Dan moved to follow, but the old
 man raised a staying hand.

   “Friend from the shadows,” he said,
 “will you hear me a moment?”

  Dan paused, acquiesced, and
dropped to the opposite bench. He
felt a sense of foreboding; nothing
pleasant awaited him.

  “There is something to be said,”
 Leucon continued, “and I say it with-
 out desire to pain you, if phantoms
 feel pain. It is this: Galatea loves you,
 though I think she has not yet realized
 it.”

   “I love her too,” said Dan.

  “Then woe to both of you! For this
 is impossible in Paracosma; it is a
 confiiction with the laws. Galatea's
 mate is appointed, perhaps even now
 approaching.”

  "Laws! Laws!” muttered Dan.
“Whose laws are they? Not Galatea's
nor mine!”

  “But they exist,” said the Gray
 Weaver. “It is not for you nor for
 me to criticize them—though I yet
 wonder what power could annul them
 to permit your presence here!”

 “I had no voice in your laws.”

 The old man peered at him in the
108

STARTLING STORIES

 dusk. “Has anyone, anywhere, a voice
 in the laws?” he queried.

  “In my country we have,” retorted
Dan.

  “Madness!” growled Leucon. “Man-
made laws! Of what use are man-
made laws with only man-made pen-
alties, or none at all? If you shadows
make a law that the wind shall blow
only from the east, does the west wind
obey it?”

  “Some of our laws may be stupid,
but they’re no more unjust than
yours.”

  “Ours,” said the Gray Weaver, “are
the unalterable laws of the world, the
laws of nature. Violation is always
unhappiness. I have seen it, I have
known it in another, in Galatea’s
mother, though Galatea is stronger
than she.” He paused. “Now,” he
continued. “I ask only for mercy;
your stay is short, and I ask that you
do no more harm than is already done.
Be merciful; give her no more to re-
gret.”

  Dan turned silent and unhappy to
his own chamber.

  Again he rose at the glow of dawn,
and again Galatea was before him,
meeting him at the door with her bowl
of fruit. She deposited her burden,
giving him a wan little smile of greet-
ing, and stood facing him as if wait-
ing.

  “Come with me, Galatea,” he said.

  “Where?”

  “To the river bank. To talk.”

THEY trudged in silence to the
brink of Galatea’s pool. Dan noted
a subtle difference in the world about
him. Outlines were vague, the thin
flower pipings less audible, and the
very landscape was queerly unstable,
shifting like smoke when he wasn’t
looking at it directly. And strangely,
though he had brought the girl here
to talk to her, he had now nothing to
say, but sat in aching silence with his
eyes on the loveliness of her face.

  Galatea pointed at the red ascending
sun. “So short a time,” she said, “be-
fore you go back to your phantom
world. I shall be sorry, very sorry.”
She touched his cheek with her fin-
gers. “Dear shadow!”

  “Suppose,” said Dan huskily, “that
I won’t go. What if I won’t leave
here?” His voice grew fiercer. “I’ll
not go! I’m going to stay!”

  The calm mournfulness of the girl’s
face checked him; he felt the irony of
struggling against the inevitable pro-
gress of a dream. She spoke. “Had
I the making of the laws, you should
stay. But you can’t, dear one. You
can’t!”

  Forgotten now were the words of
the Gray Weaver. “I love you, Gal-
atea,” he said.

  “And I you,” she whispered. “See,
dearest shadow, how I break the same
law my mother broke, and am glad to
face the sorrow it will bring.” She
placed her hand tenderly over his.
“Leucon is very wise and I am bound
to obey him, but this is beyond his
wisdom because he let himself grow
old.” She paused. “He let himself
grow old,” she repeated slowly. A
strange light gleamed in her dark eyes
as she turned suddenly to Dan.

“Dear one!” she said tensely. “That
thing that happens to the old—that
death of yours! What follows it?”
“What follows death?” he echoed.
“Who knows?”

  “But—” her voice was quivering.
“But one can’t simply—vanish! There
must be an awakening.”

  “Who knows?” said Dan again.
“There are those who believe we wake
to a happier world, but—” He shook
his head hopelessly.

  “It must be true! Oh, it must be!”
Galatea cried. “There must be more
for you than the mad world you speak
of!" She leaned very close. “Suppose,
dear,” she said, “that when my ap-
pointed lover arrives, I send him away.
Suppose I have no child, but let my-
self grow old. older than Leucon, old
until death. Would I join you in your
happier world?”

  “Galatea!” he cried distractedly.
“Oh, my dearest—what a terrible
thought!”

  “More terrible than you know,”
she whispered, still very close to him.
“It is more than violation of the law,
it is rebellion! Everything is planned,
everything was foreseen, except this;
and if I have no child, her place will

be left unfilled, and the places of her
children, and of their children, and so
on until some day the whole great plan
of Paracosma fails of whatever its
destiny was to be.” Her whisper grew
very faint and fearful. “It is destruc-
tion, but I love you more than I fear
—death!1’

  Dan’s arms were about her. “No,
Galatea! No! Promise me!”

  She murmured, “I can promise and
then break my promise.” She drew his
head down; their lips touched, and he
felt a fragrance and a taste like honey
in her kiss. “At least,” she breathed,
“I can give you a name by which to
love you. Philometros! Measure of
my love!”

  “A name?” muttered Dan. A fan-
tastic idea shot through his mind—a
way of proving to himself that all this
was reality, and not just a page that
any one could read who wore old Lud-
wig’s magic spectacles. If Galatea
would speak his name! Perhaps, he
thought daringly, perhaps then he
could stay! He thrust her away.

  “Galatea!” he cried. “Do you re-
member my name?”

SHE nodded silently, her unhappy
eyes on his.

  “Then say it! Say it, dear!”

  She stared at him dumbly, misera-
bly, but made no sound.

  “Say it, Galatea!” he pleaded des-
perately. “My name, dear—just my
name!” Her mouth moved, she grew
pale with effort, and Dan could have
sworn that his name trembled on her
quivering lips, though no sound came.

  At last she spoke. “I can’t, dearest
one! Oh, I can’t! A law forbids it!”
She stood suddenly erect, pallid as
ivory carving. “Leucon calls!” she
said, and darted away. Dan followed
along the pebbled path, but her speed
was beyond his powers; at the portal
he found only the Gray Weaver stand-
ing cold and stern. He raised his hand
as Dan appeared.

“Your time is short,” he said. “Go,
thinking of the havoc you have done.”
‘‘Where’s Galatea?” gasped Dan.

  “I have sent her away.” The old
man blocked the entrance; for a mo-
ment Dan would have struck him

aside, but something withheld him. He
stared wildly about the meadow—
there! A flash of silver beyond the
river, at the edge of the forest. He
turned and raced toward it, while mo-
tionless and cold the Gray Weaver
watched him go.

 “Galatea!" he called. “Galatea!"

  But the world was growing cloudy;
Paracosma was dissolving around him.
Hopelessly he cried out her name—
“Galatea!’?

  After an endless time, he paused;
something familiar about the spot
struck him, and just as the red sun
edged above him, he recognized the
place—the very point at which he had
entered Paracosma! A sense of futil-
ity overwhelmed him as for a moment
he gazed on an unbelievable apparition
—a dark window hung in mid-air be-
fore him, through which glowed rows
of electric lights. Ludwig’s window!

  It vanished. But the trees writhed
and the sky darkened, and he swayed
dizzily in turmoil. He realized sud-
denly that he was no longer standing,
but sitting in the midst of the crazy
glade, and his hands clutched some-
thing smooth and hard—the arms of
the miserable hotel chair. Then at
last he saw her, close before him—
Galatea, with sorrow-stricken fea-
tures, her fear-filled eyes on his. He
made a terrific effort to rise, stood
erect, and fell sprawling in a blaze of
corruscating lights.

  He struggled to his knees. Walls—
Ludwig’s room—encompassed him; he
must have slipped from the chair.
The magic spectacles lay before him,
one lens splintered and spilling a
fluid no longer water-clear, but white
as milk.

  “God!” he muttered.

HE felt shaken, sick, exhausted,
with a bitter sense of bereave-
ment, and his head ached fiercely. The
room was drab, disgusting; he wanted
to get out of it. He glanced automat-
ically at his watch; four o’clock—he
must have sat here nearly five hours.
For the first time, he noticed Ludwig’s
absence; he was glad of it and walked
dully out of the door to an automatic
elevator. There was no response to
110

STARTLING STORIES

his ring; someone was using the thing.
He walked three flights to the street
and back to his own room.

  In love with a vision! Worse—in
love with a girl who had never lived,
in a fantastic Utopia that was literally
nowhere. He threw himself on his
bed with a groan that was half a sob.

  He saw finally the implication of the
same Galatea. Galatea—Pygmalion’s
statue, given life by Venus in the an-
cient Grecian myth. But his Galatea,
warm and lovely and vital, must re-
main forever without the gift of life,
since he was neither Pygmalion nor
God.

  He woke late in the morning, star-
ing uncomprehendingly about for the
fountain and pool of Paracosma. Slow
comprehension dawned. How much—
how much—of last night's experience
had been real? How much was the
product of alcohol? Or had old Lud-
wig been right, and was there no dif-
ference between reality and dream?

  He changed his rumpled attire and
wandered despondently to the street.
He found Ludwig’s hotel at last. In-
quiry revealed that the diminutive
professor had checked out, leaving no
forwarding address.

  What of it? Even Ludwig couldn’t
give what he sought, a living Galatea.
Dan was glad that he had disappeared;
he hated the little professor. Profes-
sor? Hypnotists called themselves
“professors”. He dragged through
a weary day and then a sleepless night
on the train to Chicago where his
home was.

*****

IT was mid-winter when he saw a
suggestively tiny figure ahead of
him in the Loop. Ludwig! His cry
was automatic, “Professor Ludwig!”

  The elfin figure turned, recognized
him, smiled. They stepped into the
shelter of a building.

  “I’m sorry about your machine, Pro-
fessor. I'd be glad to pay for the dam-
age."

  “Oh, that was nothing—a cracked
lens. But you—have you been ill?
You look much the worse.”

  “It’s nothing,” said Dan. “Your
show was marvelous. Professor—
marvelous! I’d have told you so, but
you were gone when it ended.”

  Ludwig shrugged. “I went to the
lobby for a cigar.”

  “It was marvelous!" repeated Dan.
“So real?” smiled the other. “Only
because you co-operated, then. It
takes self-hypnosis.”

  “It was real, all right,” agreed Dan
glumly. “I don’t understand it—that
strange beautiful country.”

  “The trees were club-mosses en-
larged by a lens,” said Ludwig. “All
was trick photography, but stereo-
scopic, as I told you—three dimen-
sional. The fruits were rubber; the
house is a summer building on our
campus—Northern University. And
the voice was mine; you didn’t speak
at all, except your name at the first,
and I left a blank for that. I played
your part, you see; I went around with
the photographic apparatus strapped
on my head, to keep the viewpoint
always that of the observer. See?”
He grinned wryly. “Luckily I’m
rather short, or you’d have seemed a
giant.”

  “Wait a minute!” said Dan, his
mind whirling. “You say you played
my part. Then Galatea—is she real
too?”

  “Tea's real enough,” said the Pro-
fessor. “My niece, a senior at North-
ern, and likes dramatics. She helped
me out with the thing. Why? Want
to meet her?”

  Dan answered eagerly, happily. An
ache had vanished, a pain was erased.
Paracosma was attained at last!

By MORT WIISISGER

THE TWIST OF A DIAL

THE electric motor hummed plaintively as it drove the gears connected
to three whirling, perforated plates that composed the first crude tele-
vision receiver. The hand of John Logie Baird trembled as he carefully
tuned the condensers that were picking up radio impulses emanated by the
transmitter in the next room.

   His hand trembled partly because he had been working slavishly for long
hours, barely taking time to sleep. N or had his meals been regular. Conse-
quently, he was thin and undernourish ed, as he had been for two years. Also,
his attic workroom was poorly heated, and outside howled a cold autumn
wind. It was October, 1925, in London.

   But the tall Scot’s hand trembled mostly because its manipulation would
soon tell him whether he had succeeded—or failed again. Friends, business
acquaintances, learned engineers had all told - ----------■ -

him he was a fool to hope to achieve his aim.

To broadcast images over radio waves was
fantastic, impossible. They had advised him

John Logie Baird

to go back into the business world, where he
belonged, selling soap and food products.

Perhaps this very twist of the dial, this
instant, would decide his future for him. If

he failed now, he might have to give up
utterly, since both his health and credit were
near exhaustion.

If he succeeded, on the other hand—if the

face of the boy in the next room appeared
on his flickering screen—then money and
backing would be forthcoming and he would
be able to go on and perfect the machine.

  There—the condensers were tuned. Little
Willy Taynton’s face should appear. Baird
looked eagerly at the ground-glass screen,
which glowed faintly.

  But no face was there. Nothing. Not even
an outline, or the faintest interplay of light
and shadow. Failure!

  Baird slumped back. His thin shoulders
drooped as though his whole spirit had been
drained from him. Failure! The thought
was bitter after all he had sacrificed.

  He tried to think of something that might
have gone wrong. But the apparatus was
working smoothly. The fluctuating bulb was
releasing its light signals from the trans-
mitter in the next room.

  The three perforated discs were perfectly
synchronized, splitting the light beam into a
tiny pencil that moved dozens of times a
second across the screen, forming a square
of light. But the square of light showed no
image. The boy's face was not being trans-
mitted, as he had hoped.

  So the machine was a failure—junkl All
its mechanical ingenuity was a delusion, as
the outlines of the dummy’s head he had
thought he’d seen an hour ago was an illu-
sion. Junk—failure—back to selling soap—
fool—debts—John Logie Baird's mind was
agonized in that moment of defeat.

  He stepped wearily into the next room, to

 111
tell the boy he could leave. Suddenly his
head jerked up; his eyes widened. The boy,
instead of sitting in front of the scanning
lens, where Baird had placed him, was back
from it. out of range.

  “I—I can’t stand it—the lights are too
hot!” stammered the boy. "That's why I left
my seat!”

 “Nonsense!” snapped Baird. He drew a
half-crown coin from his pocket, his last, and
offered it. The boy snatched it and bravely
sat in the proper position, squinting against

the bright scanning light.

  The inventor, his heart singing with re-
newed hope, ran back to the receiving room.
Suddenly he let out a wild, exultant whoop.
The half-frightened face of Willy Taynton
stared out at him from the glass screen.
It was a dim image, a little distorted, and at
times it flickered and danced—but it was
unmistakably a face that could be recog-
nized!

  Another milestone in the development of
television had been reached.

THE INVENTOR NOBODY KNEW

GLISTENING beads of sweat trickled from young Thomas Davenport’s
furrowed brows as he pounded his anvil, the angry roar of the furnace swirl-
ing in his ears. The mighty blows sent ripples along the muscles of his corded
arms as he battered the shapeless metal into useful form.

Occasionally the youth paused a moment from his labors. He would gaze
wistfully to his right. There stood his employer, the best blacksmith in Wil-
liamston, Vermont. It was fun to see him work. His boss was a skinny man,
about as strong as a scarecrow. Yet he did his work skillfully.

The reason was a strange one. Tom Davenport’s employer did not use the

heavy hammer and anvil to mould his horse-
shoes, his chains. No, he used a wondrous
mechanical device ... a trip-hammer ... a
mechanical hammer deriving its energy from
water power.

  This mechanical device fascinated young
Davenport. He realized fully the superiority

Thomas Davenport

of the machine as compared to bare hands.
He thought of his own little workshop at
home. Wheels, cogs, wires—some day he
would invent something from all these dona-
tions given him by the junkman.

  The years rolled by. Davenport moved to
Brandon. Vermont. There he married. But
he still kept dreaming. Some day he would
invent something that would bring him fame
and fortune. All he wanted was one idea.

  Then one summer day in 1833 his brother,
Oliver, brought him interesting news.

  "Tom," his brother told him. “they’ve got
something new in Crown Point, New York.

 Professor Joseph Henry, of Albany, has in-
 vented a great magnetic battery. Why, they
 say it’s so powerful it can suspend a black-
 smith’s anvil in mid-air!"

  Right then and there Tom Davenport
 made up his mind.

   ‘‘I’ve got to see that magnet, Oliver!” he
 said determinedly. “And you’ve got to help
 me!”

   So the two brothers left their home in
 Vermont. For weeks they traveled with
 their horse and cart until they arrived in
 Crown Point. There they found the fabled
 magnet. Tom studied it carefully. Why, it
 looked like an ordinary horseshoe, like the
 ones he had made as a youth. There were
 few differences. The arms were about ten
 inches long, and were wound with wire back
 and forth.

   Breathlessly, the Davenports watched a
 demonstration of the magnet's powers that
 very day. By the wizardry of the invisible
 electrical energy, the magnet was able to
 suspend heavy metal objects many feet
 from the ground.

   “There’s a future in that,” Tom told his
 brother. “A new power for the human race
 . . . something to take the place of steam
 and save the lives lost by the explosions of
 engines of today. Oliver, we've got to buy
 that magnet!”

   Professor Henry wanted seventy-five dol-
 lars for his magic magnet. He might just as
 well have asked for seventy-five thousand
 dollars. For both brothers were penniless.
 Finally, the two brothers sold their horse
 and cart, exchanged the money for the mag-
 net, and began their weary trail home. But
 their steps were light. The treasure was
 _ theirs.

   Home, Oliver Davenport thought of an
 idea.

  “Look. Tom,” he said. “We can make
 money exhibiting this magnet. There are
 many people who would pay a small price to
sep it work!”

  But Tom Davenport wasn’t listening. He
was dreaming again.

  "If this magnet, weighing three pounds,”
he said aloud to himself, “can lift one hun-
dred and fifty pounds, I wonder how much
a magnet weighing one hundred pounds
could lift. But first I’ve got to understand
how this one works!”

  Suddenly, amid startled protests from his
brother, Tom Davenport began taking apart
the valuable magnet. He pried away every
inch of wire, uncoiled the entire works.
Hours later he finished. At last he under-
stood the mechanical principles behind the
operation of the magnet. Now he was go-
ing to build a bigger and better one.

  The original magnet was wound with silk
for insulation. Where was he going to get
the expensive fabric for his experiments?
He thought for a moment, then consulted
his wife, Emilie. Yes, she would get him
the silk he needed. She had but one beauti-
ful dress, the dress she had worn at her
wedding when, as a bride, she had promised
to be Tom Davenport’s wife . . . for better
or worse.

  Tom Davenport took that dress, ripped it
into multiple strands, and eventually suc-
ceeded in manufacturing his giant magnet.
In July, 1834, he was able to move a wheel
about seven inches in diameter at the rate
of about thirty revolutions a minute with a
variation of his device. It was the greatest
thrill of his life.

 Like Pitch and Runmey, Davenport was
ahead of his time. The steam engine and
tne locomotive were just coming into their
own in public regard, and conditions had not
yet arisen demanding other forms of power.
As a matter of fact, more than thirty years
passed after Davenport’s death before cither
the elcctric motor or the electric railway be-
came actualities.

  When they did, they incorporated Daven-
port's ideas with incidental improvements.
Although he died a poor man, Davenport
had actually produced the electric motor
which had been the pioneer of millions of
motors now running all over the world, and
should be listed with the immortal bene-
factors of mankind.

  Thomas Davenport had waited years for
his idea—and the world will be using it for
many years to come!

THE GREAT PREDICTION

THE famous Edmund Hailey stared into the shining, eager eyes of the
youth seated beside him and scrubbed his snowy white beard. The boy,
Alexis Claude Clairaut, was not yet out of his teens, yet Hailey, a man of
seventy-five, felt like a child in his presence.

   The boy’s voice was level, mature; though he was young in years, there
was much about his bearing that stamped him as a man. Hailey had mar-
veled at many wonders in his more than seven decades of life, but never had
he seen so much wisdom stored in one curly-locked head.

   “Then. Professor Hailey,” the boy said respectfully, “if your calculations
are correct, the great comet of 1682—the comet they have named ‘Hailey’s
comet' in your honor—should return in our _____

skies fifteen years from now, in the year
1757! We will be able to see your comet

then?”

  Professor Edmund Hailey smiled wanly.
“No, Alexis,” he said falteringly. “We won’t
be able to see the return of this comet. I
am an old man. To see this great comet
but once in a lifetime is fortunate, indeed.
But you are young, and you will live to see
it blaze in the heavens.”

  The boy remained quiet for a moment, re-
gretful for the thoughdess way he had
worded his question.

  “Tell me, please, Professor Hailey,” he
said at last, “why are you so certain the
comet will appear at the time you predict?”
The aged astronomer extended his arm
and tapped the sheaf of papers on his desk
with his index finger.

  "Proof, my boy!” he declared huskily.
“And I've got it! The chronicles of scien-
tists before us . . . the records of civiliza-
tion. They all point to one unimpeachable
fact . . . that this great comet has a closed
orbit and returns to our skies every seventy-
six years! By determining the parabolic ele-
ments of a number of comets from recorded
observations, I have identified the comet of

1682 with one which had previously appeared
in 1607 and with one which was observed by
Apian at Ingolstadt in 1531. Thus, I am ex-
tremely confident in my prediction that this
comet will return at the end of the year
1757!”

  The boy rose. “I can’t tell you how grate-
ful I am for this meeting with you, Professor
Hailey,” he said earnestly. “I shall never
forget it. Your calculations are truly mirac-
ulous. But I must go now, sir. It is getting
late.”

  “Stay, my son,” Hailey urged. "You make
an old man happy. I would like to tell you
how the perihelion distance of this comet
was discovered.”

  Young Alexis Clairaut shifted his weight
from his right foot to his left. He fumbled
with his hat uneasily.

  “I am sorry. Professor Hailey.” the nine-
teen-year-old lad said nervously. “But I
really must leave. You see, I am scheduled
to give a lecture tonight at the Academy of
Science. Won’t you come along?"

  Professor Hailey's eyes archcd upward.
He had almost forgotten! Alexis Clairaut
was a genius. At the age of 10 he had studied

113
abstruse works on infinitesimal analysis and
conical sections; before he was 13 he had
presented a memoir on curves to the French
Academy of Sciences; at 16 he had published
his first work, on curves of double curvature.
And at 18 he had been elected a member of
the Academy!

  The old scientist shook his head. “Run
along, Alexis,” he said softly. “But visit me
again—soon!”

  Alexis Claude Clairaut never saw the dis-
tinguished astronomer again, for Hailey died
a few months later, in 1742. All England
rr.oumed his passing, then stood by breath-
lessly for a fifteen-year vigil, wondering
whether Hailey’s comet would make its pre-
dicted return.

  The years went by swiftly. At last—1757.
Alexis Clairaut, now world-famous for his
mathematical researches, threw aside his
telescope, rubbed his burning eyes.

  “Well, Monsieur Clairaut, where is your
Professor Hailey’s comet?” came the mock-
ing exclamation of a rival scientist, D’Alem-
bert. “You have searched the skies for two
weeks now, yet there is no sign of this
comet. But do not worry, mon ami. Per-
haps, if we will wait another seventy-six
years, Monsieur Hailey’s comet will come
again!” He laughed sarcastically. “Maybe!”

  Clairaut was quick to defend Hailey’s
prophecy. “Monsieur D’Alembert,” he
snapped irritably, “Professor Hailey’s cal-
culations are correct. I have studied his
papers, gone over them a thousand times.
Why, the comet of 1682 even appeared in
1066, in William the Conqueror’s time. It is
pictured in the Bayeux Tapestry. The comet
will appear—just as Professor Hailey pre-
dicted!”

  “Bah! You are stupid, to follow the teach-
ings of Hailey. This fool—he could not
even predict the weather!”

 And so it went. The astronomers of
Clairaut’s day scoffed at Hailey’s prediction,
ridiculed Clairaut for his faith in the proph-
ecy. But Clairaut was adamant. The mem-
ory of his meeting with the aged Hailey was
something time would never erase. He could
never forget how intensely sincere the old
man had been, how penetrating his logic.

But there was something wrong somewhere.
What was it, in the name of the gods?

  Clairaut buried himself in mathematical
research. Finally, he had it. Certain dis-
turbances of the planets in the path of the
comet had delayed its course. Clairaut's fig-
ures showed that the comet wouBd return
. . . but two years later. Hailey could hardly
be blamed for not anticipating these delicate
factors.

  In March, 1759, Alexis Clairaut stood on
his rooftop, staring triumphantly at the

celestial phenomenon that hung eerily over
the land. It was a phenomenon unmatched
for grandeur except perhaps by an eclipse of
the sun. The long, shimmering tail which
streamed from an incandescent head many
times brighter than the most scintillant star
in the heavens seemed to be unwinding from
some cosmic spool below the Earth.

  Here was Hailey’s comet. A little late,
yes. But the important thing was that its
return to Earth had been predicted. Clairaut
was happy. He stayed up all night watching
the flight of the comet. But he didn’t see it
so well. It’s hard to see well—through tears.

  Nobody can count the stars In the galaxy,
because it is impossible, even with our great-
est telescopes, to see or photograph all of
them. The problem must be attacked by in-
direct methods. One of these is based on the
discovery that the sun. one of the stars of
the system, revolves around the galactic cen-
ter in an orbit of such gigantic size—65,180
light-years in diameter—that 200.000.000 or

 With these data at hand it Is possible, by
 applying the law of universal gravitation, to
 compute the total mass (weight) of the stars
 within the solar orbit. Astronomers have a
 pretty good idea of the average mass of the
 stars in the Immediate neighborhood of the

 throughout the galaxy, it is then possible to
 arrive at a rough estimate of the total number

Earth's Speed Changes, and the Result Is-

THE LOST HOUR

By ALEXANDER SAMALMAN

Author of "The Changer of i

ONE day in March, 1980, Earth’s
scientists discovered that the
world had lost one hour o£

time.

  Beneath the globe’s surface, a mol-
ten mass of matter, which for a cen-
tury had bubbled and boiled as if
stirred by the fires of hell, subsided
in its mad upward surge.

  Concurrently, fissures on the crust
of the Earth closed; there was a
change in the eternal rhythm of
Earth’s contraction and expansion,
and a consequent lowering of its sur-
face.

  Local disturbances were reported;
however, as the severest shocks were
felt at the North and South Poles,
and under the Atlantic and Pacific
Oceans, no general cataclysm took
place.

  The occurrence was the subject of
a lengthy statement by Professor Al-
dous Grant, world-renowned physi-
cist. Professor Grant was quoted as
follows in the Daily Record for
March 10, 1980:

  “The phenomena which we are wit-
nessing are not unfamiliar to scien-
tists, although they have never been
as marked as at present. Because of

     " "The Last Straw,” etc.

internal disturbances, our sphere’s
rate of rotation, or the length of the
terrestrial day, is undergoing a
change.

  “As early as 1880, astronomers no-
ticed certain irregularities in the mo-
tion of the moon. These were inex-
plicable, and in a strict sense are in-
explicable to the present day.

  “Irregularities in the motion of the
sun were also observed. Checking
these against the irregularities of the
moon, it was discovered that they co-
incided. This left no alternative
other than the assumption that the
true change is in the speed of the
Earth, and not in the speed of either
sun or moon. At various times in the
past, notably in 1790, in 1897, in 1917,
and in 1950, the Earth’s speed was
subjected to sudden changes.

  “These changes have been attrib-
uted to contraction and expansion of
the Earth’s crust due to altered tem-
peratures within the molten layers.
In the nineteenth century the effect
of these erratic pulsations was the
lengthening of the year by one second.
In 1950, it was observed that an oppo-
site effect was obtained, the apparent
length of the year becoming shorter
by almost a full minute.

  “The present disturbances, how-
ever, bid fair to break all records. We
have been losing time at an unbeliev-
ably swift rate. Nothing has as yet
been done to adjust ourselves to
this acceleration. Nevertheless, it is
doubtful whether—”

IN a dark prison cell, a man was pre-
paring to die. Praying fervently,
he sought to make peace with his God.

  Ralph Frazier knew he was inno-
cent but the circumstantial evidence
of the case was all against him. And
so he had to die.

The sentence was definite, left no

room for doubt. He was in a strange
land and thus far nobody had come
to his defense.

  The words echoed in his tortured
mind:	'

  “To be hung by the neck until dead,
on the morning of March 11, 1980, at
or before five o’clock—”

  It was shortly before the fatal hour
when they called for Ralph Frazier,
and marched him into the prison
yard. He looked up at the sky for
what he thought would be the last
time—and suddenly he gasped. The
sun was high in the heavens.

  “Look, padre,” he said to the dig-
nified figure at his side. “It is past
dawn.”

  The guards gaped their astonish-
ment. In the prison yard stood an an-
cient sundial. Ralph Frazier pointed
to it. “It is six o’clock according to
that sundial over there,” he declared.

  It was true. Although every clock
in the vicinity proclaimed the hour
of five, the evidence of the sundial
could not be denied.

  “Our clocks must be out of gear,”
said the warden. “But it makes no
difference. Let’s go ahead.”

  “Ah, no,” spoke the padre. “The
young man must not be executed for
God has wrought a miracle on his be-
half. You must grant him the privilege
of a re-trial, according to the laws of
this community.”

  Benevolently, the padre patted
Ralph Frazier’s head.

  “My son,” he said, “thank the Lord
for this precious chance that has come
to you, to prove your innocence.”
Ralph Frazier was conducted back
to his cell, where he flung himself
upon the stone floor and wept in
prayer and gratitude. . . .

DR. JAMES HOSKINS was
_ roused from his sleep by the in-
sistent ringing of the telephone. He
looked out of the window and saw
that it was dawn.

  The voice over the wire was anxious
and grief-stricken.

  “We waited until day came,” the
mother spoke nervously, “but the
baby's condition hasn’t improved. He

suffered all night and is very feverish
now. Oh, Doctor, we don’t know what
to do and i'f you can hurry—”

  It meant a long trip across ex-
tremely bad roads in the heart of the
woods. Dr. Hoskins sighed as he
dressed. Life wasn’t easy.

  When he arrived at the baby’s bed-
side he took one look at the flushed
face of the tossing infant and rolled
up his sleeves and set to work.

  “He’ll pull through, all right,” he
said comfortingly. “But if you’d
waited another ten minutes before
calling me it would have been too
late.”

*****

THE dictator of a large empire was
giving his final instructions to his
espionage chief.

  “You hold the fate of Esthinia in
your hands,” he said gravely. “My
people there are ready to overthrow
the government—but they need your
guidance. Your presence would elec-
trify them, spur them into action.”
“But I can’t reach Esthinia,” said
the spy. “Not if, as you say, the mis-
sion is so secret that I can’t use a
plane. The route is heavily guarded
and there’s a price on my head in the
intervening territory.”

  “Under cover of night, you can
work your way through,” the dictator
advised. “I order you to go now—
and you will be there in time. . . . You
must not use a conveyance of any kind,
for your preparations would be ob-
served and there’s no one I can trust.
This is of the utmost importance.”
As he made his way through forest
and field in the darkness, the spy re-
alized the vast significance of his mis-
sion. Once he presented himself in
Esthinia, the spark would be put to
the powder keg. Revolution would
flame! There would be war and con-
quest, glory and widespread disaster!
But—the Esthinians would not act
without him.

  The dictator wanted revolt—it
would establish him as the ruler, the
man of destiny over a much larger em-
pire than he now controlled.

  If, however, the spy were stopped
before reaching his destination, the
threatened uprising would peter out.
118

STARTLING STORIES

  Nearer and nearer he came to the
border.

  The darkness and his own clever-
ness in avoiding detection were serv-
ing him well.

 Suddenly he looked up and was
startled out of his wits. Had the night
passed so quickly? The fingers of
dawn Were beginning to paint the
sky----

 Now the spy became frantic,
hastened toward his goal. It was a
mad fight against time. Scratched and
bruised, he tried to run through
bramble and bush, futilely pounded
against obstructing trees.

  It was no use. Lighter and lighter
it grew, and he could no longer hide
himself while traveling. If only he
had another hour’s time! He crouched
under the outspread branches of a pro-
tective tree, and it was then a sentry
saw and recognized him.

  As he was led away to a place of
detention, the spy trembled at the
thought of the dictator’s mighty
wrath.

  Today was the day to strike—and
he had failed, and another dream of
world domination was shattered.
*****

  “—doubtful whether,” the report of

the learned Professor Grant went on,
“the current acceleration of the
Earth will have any noticeable influ-
ence on the Earth’s population. Per-
haps the majority of individuals will
be 'completely unaware of what has
happened. Only the most astute will
understand the cosmic occurrence—
—and even they will be at a loss to
explain the amazingly swift, terrific
contraction and consequent accelera-
tion of the Earth.

  “I predict that though we shall have
lost an entire hour by tomorrow,
March eleventh, life will go on in
much the same way, and people will
devote their energies to quite the
usual pursuits. Granted, of course,
that present calculations are not upset
by unforeseen eruptions.

 “Though of immense significance
from a scientific viewpoint, this
phenomenon will pass almost utterly
unmarked by, and of no importance
whatever to, the hurrying and scurry-
ing beings who make up the major
population of this globe. They will
soon become accustomed to the
changed time cycle, and after official
action is taken will accept it with the
same nonchalance with which they ac-
cept Daylight Saving schedules.”

AND MANY OTHER
STORIES AND FEATURES
BINDER'S BEST
By THOMAS S. GARDNER

  The second issue of STARTLING STORIES
fully bears out the policy of good stories laid
down by.the memorable first.

  "The Impossible World” is the best story
Binder ever wrote. It is well planned and
written. Please pass on to him my congratu-
lations. His characterization Is swell and I
have few objections. I cannot agree with his
science in regard to planetary conditions on
Jupiter, nor for the possibility of one sub-
stance acting as a universal hormone—al-
though the idea is unique, and I believe, orig-
inal and an excellent story point. His chief

scientist acted like a spoiled child—and by
gosh, many scientists I know do too. It is
about time the scientist is taken down from
his pedestal of either a crank or austere
super-being. Go to it.

  Hamilton’s "Fear Neutralizer” was o.lt.
Hamilton always writes well. "Turnabout”
was very, very good for a short short The
departments wero very good, especially
THRILLS IN SCIENCE. I had never heard
the story concerning Copernicus. The human
interest in this department will do more to
develop a genuine interest in science and sci-
entists as human beings than many books
would. I hope the succeeding Issues are as
well written and edited as this one.—903 John
Jay Hall, Columbia University. New York,
N. T.

FINLAY MAGNIFICENT
By HARRY WARNER, JR.

  We could hardly expect the standard of the
second Issue of STARTLING STORIES to come
up to that of the first. But. nevertheless. It
came close to it! "The Impossible World”
was about the finest thing that Binder has
ever written, in my opinion. The idea, on
the whole, was good, though not completely
original, and the narrative style was superb.

  It only goes to bring out my old theory that
any author can do better on long novels than
with shorts and novelets. Whatever you do,
don’t stop printing the full-length novel each
time—and keep it long, at least eighty pages.

  The reprint was again well chosen. I
haven't any nominations to make for THE
HALL OF FAME, but I would like to second
several nominations in the second Issue, par-
ticularly Weinbaum’s "Martian Odyssey;”
Manning’s "Seeds from Space;” and "The Sub-
lime Vigil,” by Cuthbert. I've read all three,
but I would like to see them again. And.
by all means, put Weinbaum's bust in the cut

for THE HALL OF FAME. He certainly be-
longs in the class with the masters.

  All of your features are good, though you
can do away with SCIENTIFIC CROSSWORD
PUZZLE and SCIENCE QUESTION BOX and
enlarge THRILLS IN SCIENCE without doing
the mag any harm, in my opinion. Keep up
the fan mag reviews.

  Saving the best for the last—use Finlay
hereafter as much as possible! His drawings
for "The Impossible World" were about as
good a set as any s-f artist has ever done.
The one on Page 37 is truly magnificent, and
the small portraits of the characters can’t be
beat.

  And I'm still waiting for you to print
“Dawn of Flame!"—311 Bryan Place, Hagers-
town, Maryland.

  (In answer to Mr. Warner, and to the hun-
dreds of readers that have written in request-
ing publication of Stanley G. Weinbaum's
great novel, "Dawn of Flame,” we are pleased
to announce that the story will appear in the
Tenth Anniversary Issue of THRILLING
WONDER STORIES. The novel will be pub-
lished complete, in special supplement form.
It has never before been published In any
magazine.—Ed.).

FUTURE VS. PRESENT
By GEORGE V. CALVERT

  "The Black Flame” and "The Impossible
World” were hoth fine Rtorien of the future.
Stories of the future are interesting, but I
think too many are now being written. There-
fore, I would like to see a few novels of the
present.

  Weinbaum's "The New Adam" and any of
Taine's unpublished novels would make good
material for future issues. Your policy of
reprinting the classics is fine, and I would like
to see some of the stories that were very
popular In the past once more.

 THE SCIENTIFIC CROSSWORD PUZZLE
Is entertaining, and I would like to see that
feature continued.

  In conclusion, STARTLING STORIES Is the
best of the new science fiction magazines, and
I hope that it will continue to appear. Al-
though it is of little importance. I would like
to see S. S. come out in large format.—335 V&
Woodland Avenue. Williamsport, Pa.

FAVORS FINLAY
By RALPH C. HAMILTON

  Your March issue was excellent, although
the feature story was not. of course, and could
not have been expected to be, equal to Wein-
baum's yarn. But what really made this
issue good was Finlay. I could rave for some
time about his illustrations for "The Impos-
sible World;’’ in my opinion they're the best
that have ever ornamented science fiction.

  You are to be congratulated on securing
him to illustrate for you; you couldn’t have
obtained anyone better.—Wooster, Ohio.

WEINBAUM BRILLIANT
By CHARLES B. HIDLEY

  •The Black Flame.” by Stanley G. Weln-
baum, was one of the most beautiful char-
acter studies I have ever read In Action or
non-flrtlnn. It was truly wonderful, and you
are to be congratulated for publishing it In
such an artistic manner with the interesting
illustrations by Wesso. What could possibly
be more perfect? Action, science, beauty,
love, hate, and endless other human emotions,
combined with that Inimitable Weinbaum
style that was so great. Justly title it as the
best scientifictlon novel ever written. By all
means let us see "Dawn of name.”

  THE HALL OF FAME Is a clever ar.d long
sought-after idea. "Science Island" was well
written and exciting. Mr. Binder Is Indeed
fortunate to he able to stand next to Wein-
baum and still be recognized through the
aura of brilliance. Bravo. Mr. Binder.

  The profuse features Join to make the whole
Issue a stupendous success—and for a flrst
issue, too. T have only one adjective left—
it really is amazing. I only hope you con-
tinue the good work.

PERFECT LINE-UP
By HENRY BOERNSTEIN

  Of course it's too soon to tell, but T believe
that with your flrst issue you have surpassed
every other scientlfiction mag on the mar-
ket! And this in spite of the fact that the
January issue didn't contain my favorite type
of story—the Interplanetary novel. However,
I see you are going to make up for that in the
next issue.

  Weinbaum was always my favorite author,
and he certainly didn't disappoint me with
“The Black Flame." Here, for the flrst time,
he had a chance to expand and encompass
many little twists in the plot. Never have 1
read a story with that Interesting variation
to it—the fact that the hero does make mis-
takes, doesn't marry the flrst girl that enters
the story—and best of all. Is no superman,
It is hard to criticize this story, there being
nothing to criticize. AH 1 could have sug-

Jested was a sequel, a pleasure which is. un-
ortunately, impossible.

  Stick to your policy of one long novel and
two or three short stories. It not only lends
Itself to originality, but It enables you to pub-
lish really worthwhile classics. Brevity may
be the soul of wit, but certainly not of scl-
entifictlon

  I onjoy stories that transport the reader to
a distant planet, among steamy vegetation and
weird forms of life, into an environment to-

Inevitably come when humans conquer the
uncharted vastness of space. And Editor. If
it is at all possible, obtain and reprint that
story which so many of us have missed—
“The Moon Pool.”

  Now, as to the features of the new maga-
zine: 1 gaze bewildered at the almost perfect
line-up; all the features I ever hoped to see
Hie here, particularly THE HALL OF FAME,
the Tribute to Weinbaum, the Guest Editor-
ial, and the Science Fiction Fan Publications'
Review. There Is an inexpressible pleasure In
communicating with such organizations and
exchanging views.

  Here are some suggested—nay, demanded,
authors you should have in the future—R. Z.

SIX-GUN SALUTE
By DEWEY V. HALE

  Seventeen years a science Action reader, yet
this is my first compliment to a story. "The
Black Flame” is, in my opinion the best story
ever published. Don’t worry about readers if
you can publish complete stories like that
one.

  I bought six copies of the first Issue and

fassed them around to my friends because 1
elt they were missing a great treat if they
failed to read "The Black Flame."

THE WEINBAUM SPELL
By LANGLEY SEARLES

  STARTLING STORIES enters the sclentiflc-
tion field in great fashion. It was even a bet-
ter issue than I had hoped for. The cover
wasn't bad looking, and the lettering of the
title was pleasingly modernistic. Ditto for
the lettering on the back binding—a year's
row of them should present a good appear-
ance on any bookshelf.

  The cuts used for the various department
headings have a neat, up-to-the-minute look
which I like. A praiseworthy Idea, reviewing
fan publications; keep this up. Jack Binder's
feature Is, as always, good. The crossword
puzzle brought back memories of several
years ago. when as a high school geometry
student I completed a 12x12 one, using geo-
metrical terms exclusively; It was some Job!

  Now to the stories. "Science Island" was a
typical pot-boller. "The Black Flame"—first,
last, and foremost was excellent. Same for
the Illustrations. Someone back in 1835 said
(in effect) that Welnbatlm's stories make you
"sorry as hell to wake up;" never, Mr. Editor,
have truer words been penned.

  I've read the novel twice already, and I'll
read It many times again, as I.have all his
works. It was superbly written. Not u sin
gle paragraph or sentence was boresome or
dull; as Otto Binder said, its very simplicity
is misleading. No one but Weinbaum could
turn mere words Into such a atory with such
artistic deftness.

  “The Black Flame" was successful for the
same reason that all his others were: Wein-
baum remained within the circle that he drew,
with the result that the circle becomes as
wide as the universe, and as limitless as the
horizon. And its spell lingers on after you've
laid It down, just as its author's name lingers
In the mind of every scientiflction reader to-
day.—19 East 235th St., New York City.

WILLIAMSON WANTED
By J. HARVEY HAGGARD

  I certainly enjoyed "The Black Flame.”

  Please get a new novel-length by Jack Wil-
liamson. As a consistent entertainer, he's
tops. Something similar to "The Legion of
Space." I can still remember that outstand-
ing character. Giles Habibula.

  Second in order of preference would be a
tale by Nat Scliachner. similar to his refresh-
ing story. “He From Procyon." These, of
course, are merely the preferences of one
reader.—San Bernadino, Calif.

 atorles I hated to see end. I was Just con-
 tent to read on and on. The end had to come,
 though, and I am thankful that It was a
 happy one. An immortal story.

    The book-length novel is the main event in
 STARTLING STORIES. It should havo been
 given the cover. There are any number of
 scenes from '“The Black Flame that would
 have made good cover scenes. The one tn
 which a "messenger" catches up with Tom
 Connor Is one—given a half page drawing by
 Wesso. with the city of Urbs as a background.

   The various departments are interesting.
 THRILLS IN SCIENCE is very entertainingly
 written. There are 13 pages of non-flction in
 the Jan. issue. Why not eliminate SCIENCE
 QUESTION BOX. retaining all the other fea-
 tures. and use the space instead for fiction.

 novel, perhaps. I’m looking forward expect-
 antly to the March issue. Best wishes for

 —the one and only Virgil Finlay. I started

 appeared in A. Merritt's American Weekly I
 started copping that: now that Virgil has

 of sclentiflction within the last five years. I
 have seen Its uprlsss and downfalls, and
 now, it Is Anally trying to reach Its peak,
 the ultimate that it was in 1933-34. START-
 LING STORIES fills the need for a long novel
 that Is not in serial form, and that is what a
 large majority of sclentiflction readers have
 been wanting ever since the days of the quar-
 terlies. Tour first Issue was excellent.—703
 Brown Street. Rochester. New York.

FLAME LITERATURE
By JOHN A. BRISTOL

   I think STARTLING STORIES is a grand
 Idea, and you certainly have had an auspicious
 send-off. "The Black Flame” was as great
 a novel as I havo ever read. The Intricate
 interweaving of the plot, the various conflicts
 and cross-pulls throughout, make it first-
 grade literature in nny man’s language.

   While HALL OF FAME is a good Idea, I
 hope you don't publish something I've already
 read. I am not a fair judge, though, so you
 go ahead and do as you like.

 The fan mag department has brought me
 Into contact with something that I didn't
 know could exist—the Loa Angeles magazine.
 •‘Imagination.’’—5134 Conduit Road, Washing-
 ton, D. C.

LONGS FOR THE LONG NOVELS
By S. S. SOWERS

 It just seems too good to be true. Over 80
ages devoted to one story. After the steady
let of shorts you don’t know what n relief
it was to indulge In a story that didn’t end
Just about the time It got going good. All I
STARTLING STORIES

can say is that they don't come too long for
me. If each Issue contained Just one long
story of about 150 pages, I'd be lost to the
world for quite a while. I'm afraid.

  Remind your authors that a good sclentlflc-
tion story does not need the addition of sen-
timental love Interest or strange and Improb-
able menaces that are casting hungry glances'
at the Earth, humanity, and everything else
in sight. Witness your reprint of "The Eter-
nal Man" and especially Welnbaum's "Martian
Odyssey." "The Black Flame" Is a good ex-
ample of a well-balanced story.—<118 E. Slau-
son. Maywood. California.

EVERYTHING’S TOPS
By PAUL L. M'CLEAVE

  Just obtained a copy of STARTLING STOR-
IES. and have finished everything but the
long novel, "The Black Flame." <1 even did
the crossword.) Am saving Welnbaum's great
story until last because I want to digest It at
one meal. Sad that a man of his genius
should pass on Into the "dark universe. Scl-
entifictlon has lost a master. THE ETHER
VIBRATES Is tops. But then, so's everything.
"The Eternal Man" nearly brought tears to
my eyes. Luck to you.—11 Prospect Street,
Nantucket. Mass.

BINDERS OKAY
By G. W. FENSLER

  I have Just finished the flrst Issue of
STARTLING STORIES, and for me It satisfies
a long-felt want—that of enjoying long stor-
ies or novels of science Action.

  I note that the next issue has a long novel
by Eando Binder, which should make It an-
other top-notch Issue. While I have never
road any long novel by the Binders, I have
been reading their short stories for several
years, and It seems to me that they are Im-
proving all the time.

  I am not a scientist, but an accountant and
auditor. I do not care whether a story has
all the very latest scientific ideas or theories,
but I like It to be interesting In the human
reactions, and true to life. Also to the prob-
able, under the circumstances and conditions
laid down by the author, or at the very least
possible, and the human reaction, with which
we are all more or less familiar, natural.—
Dupont. Ohio.

QUADE & CARLYLE-R
By SAM SIMPSON

  Orchids to you for STARTLING STORIES!
"The Black Flame" was Just the type of story
I like. But. hereafter. I suggest that your
cover Illustration should illustrate the feature
and not one of the short stories.

  Binder's "Science Island" was just fair, and
"The Eternal Man" failed to click with me.
However. THE HALL OF FAME lias great
possibilities.

  Mark me down for a vote for a book-length
novel of Anthony Quade and Gerry Carlyle.
It should be the berries! If possible, I wish
that you could get Burroughs to contribute
a manuscript to your magazine. Otis Adel-
bert Kline should produce a swell novel for
you, too. Don't pass him up. You could pass
up Penton and Blake and never get a single
howl from yours truly. I’ve seen too much
of those birds In T.W.S.

  I have yet to read Welnbaum's "A Martian
Odyssey," and so of course I would like to
see It in the HALL OF FAME. I am only fif-
teen years old, so you can see that I didn't
get a chance to read the story when It was
originally published, several years ago. In
closing, I would like to wish your magatine
much popularity and a long life.—Front
Royal, Virginia.

MEET THE AUTHOR

              yes,” said Hamilton, stroking
J his pet tiger-cub, “I’ve had quite a
thrilling life. I believe ray most
exciting experience was when I climbed
Mount Everest, just after my deep-sea div-
ing expedition, and before I became a gen-
eral in the Chinese Army.”

  Well, that’s the kind of autobiography I’d
like to write! But honesty compels me to
admit sadly that I am just an average sort
of person.

  Bom 34 years ago, and lived ever since in
a small Pennsylvania city. High school and
then college, where I majored in physics and
drove my instructors crazy by continually
propounding original scientific “theories” of
my own.

  Took a job in a railroad office, and then
my passion for science fiction drove me to
try writing a story. It sold, and that started
me on my career of crime.

  I’m unmarried, and like to gad about the
country. Get out to New Mexico to visit
Jack Williamson nearly every year, and he

returns the visit
every two or three.
My other favorite
spots are New Or-
leans, San Fran-
cisco, Quebec and
Fort Madison,
Iowa. One place I
don’t like much is
Mexico, but for
some queer reason
I’ve been down
there three times in
the last four years.

  Never had but
two adventures of
the hair-breadth
type, and they
both fizzled. Once
in a rowboat on the lower Mississippi I was
nearly pulled under a barge—but a swearing
barge-hand slung a rope and hauled me ig-
nominiously to safety. Other time was
when I upset myself and companions in a
sailboat off the Florida shore—and then dis-
covered the water was so shallow we could
almost walk home.

   I've done close to two hundred stories, in-
cluding a good many detective and mystery
tales. A book of my fantastic stories was
published in England a year or so ago. Two
or three stories have been reprinted in an-
thologies.

  Because I’ve been a science fiction fan
ever since I was twelve, writing such stories
seems to me the most fascinating occupation
in the world. I get a big thrill out of evepr
story I do. I only hope a little of that thrill
gets across to the reader.

FORECAST FOR
THE NEXT ISSUE

SUPPOSE you had the power to bring
back to life the greatest scientists that
ever lived. Suppose, moreover, that your
choice were limited, and that you could only
revive five scientific giants from all history.

  Which five geniuses would you select?

  That’s the problem confronting young Dr.
Norfleet, discoverer of the secret of life, in
Manly Wade Wellman’s book-length novel
for the next issue, GIANTS FROM
ETERNITY!

  The world is imperiled by an unknown
blight from the outer realms of space.
Young Dr. Norfleet has a plan to overcome
the grim menace. But he needs assistants.
Great assistants. He requires the help of a
brilliant mathematician; a super biologist; a
wizard inventor; a master physicist; and a
visionary anthropologist.

  With the annals of history to consider,
which five geniuses from the past does Dr.
Norfleet endow with life? How do these
five master recruits, equipped with twentieth
century knowledge, combine their natural
resources to help combat the strangest
doom that has ever gripped the Earth?

  Manly Wade Wellman gives you the thrill-
ing answer in GIANTS FROM ETER-
NITY, a big novel published complete in
the next issue of STARTLING STORIES.

  Study Dr. Norfleet’s requirements and let
us know the five scientists you would choose.
You have all of history to pick from—from
Aristotle to Burbank!

  In addition to this novel, all our regular
features are in the next issue of STAR-
TLING STORIES, together with short
stories by popular writers. Streamlined
scientifiction treats from cover to cover!

you never
had a chance”

Five years ago, you and I worked at the jame
bench. We were both discontented. Remem-
ber the noon-hour we read that International
Correspondence Schools advertisement?

  "I said, 'Brother, that’s what we need —
training! Let’s mail this coupon and get the
full story!’ And you said, ’Training my
eye! What we need is drag!’

  "Well, I got the training — through the
I. C. S. And I got ahead. You had the same
chance, and laughed at it. Okay—but until
you've trained yourself to handle a bigger

job, you can’t expect to make bigger money.
Why not mail a coupon to the I.C.S. today?”
• • •

Right now, men you are going to compete
with for advancement are training themselves
the I. C. S. way. They arc following in the
footsteps of thousands of successful men who
give credit for their advancement to I. C. S.
training. Where will you be one year —five
years — from today? Start planning your
path to personal prosperity! Send tbe coupon
