FOR 250 MEN OF GOOD STANDING

IN TERRITORY NOW BEING DEVELOPED

A nationally known Ohio Corporation with an annual busi-
ness of several million dollars announces an expansion
program that will create exceptional openings for 250 reli-
able men. A new addition to our line will open up a field
of several million prospects. The openings are such that
the men appointed will be assigned productive territories
which will not necessitate a change of address.

For the past five years our firm has been recognized as
having one of the best paid selling organizations in the
country. The records of incomes of our men bear out this
reputation—(book sent on request). Our sales policies
and our extensive national advertising, coupled with an
epoch making new addition to our line, assures the right
type of man an income of from $4500 to $6000 the first
year. Earnings will increase each year as the local busi-
ness expands. Earnings from $8,000 to $12,000 a year
are possible for those who are willing to put their best
effort in the business.

No investment in stock will be required. The firm puts
its large factory stock at the disposal of representatives
and makes deliveries and collections. The men are given
authority to do open credit and “ trade-out ” business and
are protected by the firm against credit losses.

This opportunity is only for men seeking a permanent con-
nection with an assured future. While we prefer men who
can devote full time to our business, we can arrange to
appoint a few men of serious intent who can spend only
spare time at the start.

      How America Gets Its Rum—The Inside Story of the
      Croo^edest Racket in the World, by a Millionaire Bootlegger

 As Told to Don H. Thompson

CHAPTER I

The Bootleg Chief

THERE we sat, the two of us,
empty of stomach and pocket,
with nothing to do but wonder
if we would ever get another square
meal.

    A fat negro, played a monotonous,
  jangling tune on an ancient piano;
  waiters hurried to and fro; glasses rat-
  tled on the bar; there was much loud
  talking and laughter, but we paid no
  attention to the merriment. We sipped
  our beers as slowly as possible for we
  had but a dime between us. Inside the
  C81
582

DETECTIVE FICTION WEEKLY

Piccadilly Cafe it was light and warm
and outside it was a wet, chilly New
Orleans night.

  “If we can get a flop some place,”
said Graves, as calmly as though he
had a hundred-dollar bill tucked in ev-
ery pocket, “ we might be able to snare
a berth on a rum runner to-morrow.”

  I did not even answer. I was im-
mersed in gloom. Being broke was no
new experience to me, but our luck had
been consistently bad for more than
two weeks and I could not make myself
believe that it was about to change for
the better.

  “ Would you ship on a whisky
boat?” persisted Graves.

  “ I’d do anything,” I growled.
“ Anything to get the black cat off my
back.”

  We returned to gazing with medi-
tative dejection at the damp table top.
From the corner of my eyfe I saw a
waiter hovering expectantly behind us.
After a few minutes of watching he
approached.

  “ Another beer?”

  “ No,” said Graves.

  “ Anything else?”

  “ No.” •

  The waiter dropped his servile pose.
He was a burly fellow and he spread
his big hands upon the table and said:
“ You bums can’t sit here without
buying. Buy or get out.and make room
for somebody that ’11 spend some
dough.”

  “ Who said so ?”

  Graves was on his feet. He was big
and tough and wicked. His temper,
strained by hunger, was as mean as
that of a wild cat. The waiter, undis-
mayed, took a step toward him, one
hamlike hand doubled into a hard fist.
Then Graves’s punch caught him be-

hind the ear and he went down like a
log without even the subconscious re-
flex of arms thrown out to break his
fall.

  In an instant the place was in an up-
roar. A bartender and a half a dozen
plug-uglies started toward us, armed
with bottles. They were the riffraff
of the New Orleans water front and
their ragged clothes probably concealed
more than one sharp knife.

  “We’re in for it,” said I.

  “ W'e’ll clean ’em up,” snarled
Graves. He peeled off his coat swift-
ly. “ Come on, you dirty bums!”

  A shadow fell across the table. A
well-built, well-dressed man of medi-
um size stood between us and the
crowd.

  “ What's the matter, boys ?” he in-
quired pleasantly. “ Havin’ a little
trouble?”

  “ Yeah,” said Graves, “ and it looks
like we’re due for worse.”

  The newcomer turned to the men.

  “ Have a drink on the house,” he
said. “ I’ll handle this thing to suit
myself.” The crowd surged back to
the bar. Our rescuer touched a match
to a fat cigar before he spoke again.
“Broke?”

  “ Flat,” said I.

  “ Want a job?”

  “Yes.” retorted Graves. “We’ll
take any kind of a job.”

  The fellow grinned at my compan-
ion.

  “ A man with a right hand punch
like yours hadn’t ought to be beggin’
for work,” he said. “ Come on, fol-
low me/’

  And without even a backward glance
at the fallen waiter who was now be-
ginning to stir and gasp for air like a
fish out of water, we walked away to

    Editor’s Note.—Don H. Thompson, the man who wrote the history of
the Mafia in America, in “ Black Hand ” an article which appeared in Detec-

inside story of the working of the liquor traffic. His informant is a wealthy
and powerful bootlegger.
THE ROARING ROAD

583

a narrow little room under the back
stairs where we sat around a table and
talked.

  “ My name’s Hurd,” said our host
removing his derby. “ I own this bar
and I do a pretty good business with
some big guys over in Cuba. They run
the stuff in. but I have to go out after
it in small boats and get it into town.
Some of it I use here and the rest goes
north over the highway to Kansas City
and St. Louis.

  “ It's a risky business, but a good one.
1 can always use good, strong, depend-
able men. You birds looked like pret-
ty good prospects and that’s why I
stepped into your fight. What do you
say ? Interested ?”

  “ Absolutely,” said Graves. I said
nothing at all.

  “ Who are you ?”

  “ Sailors.”

  “ Show me something to prove it. I
can’t take any chances on getting the
wrong guys to guard my liquor.”
Graves had several letters addressed
to him aboard our last ship and I had
my mate’s papers. Hurd spread them
all upon the table and read them care-
fully.

  “ Looks all right.” he said at last.
“ You see, I prefer to pick my own
men as 1 go along. I never hire a guy
who asks me for a job. Figure that if
I used that system I’d be payin’ wages
to some prohi and my next stopping
place would be Leavenworth.

  “ Now listen, bovs. This job takes
cool, steady heads and plenty of insides,
but you'll find it’s easy work and good
money. You guard the stuff and your
pay goes on as long as you bring home
the bacon. If you lose a load, that’s
your tough luck and you’re fired.
Agreed?”

  “ Right,” said Graves.

  “ Here's a ten-spot.” went on Hurd.
“ Get yourselves a good square meal
and come back about eleven o’clock.
We’ll start out to do some business.”
“ Say,” said Graves, “ are we guard-
ing this stuff against dry agents?”

  Hurd laughed, exposing solid gold
teeth.

  “Dry agents, hell!” he snorted.
“ We don’t worry about those birds.
It’s hi-jackers that get our trucks. I
lost two last month and, by God, I don’t
propose to get stuck for a third one.
There’s going to be a lot of plain and
fancy shooting on some of these roads
to-night if Bascom’s bunch tries to lift
any of my stuff.”

  YVe took his tenner and headed for
the nearest restaurant.

  And that, my friend, is how I became
a rum runner. That is how I quit be-
ing an honest ship’s mate and tossed
my lot with the ex-convicts, ex-prize
fighters, bouncers, gamblers and gun-
men who combine to make a mockery
of the law which says that strong drink
shall not be consumed in these United
Stales. Once in with them, I never
had a moment of hesitation. All about
me I saw ignorant men, many of them
criminals, growing rich. I determined
to make a fortune.

  I began at the very bottom, toting a
shotgun to keep hi-jackers from steal-
ing the cargo, and worked my way up
until I owned distilleries, ships, trucks
and warehouses and commanded the
services of several hundred sea cap-
tains, shore men, drivers, bottlers and
label counterfeiters.

  During the year just past, the syndi-
cate of which I am the head, shipped
more than five million dollars’ worth
of alcohol, rum, whisky and champagne
north from New Orleans. The tre-
mendous percentage of profit on this
amount of liquor will be readilv re-
alized when I tell you how the stuff was
manufactured and run into the coun-
try. The losses to government dry
agents have been practically none, but
the ruthless hi-jackers are, and always
will be, the fly in the otherwise smooth
ointment of the bootleggers. For them
we wear bullet-proof vests and carry
sub-machine guns and many a battle is
fought on a lonely road at night, the
584

DETECTIVE FICTION WEEKLY

prize being a five-ton truck filled to the
top with Cuban whisky.

  When I retire from this business
with more than a million dollars I will
go to my country estate and live the
quiet life of a rural gentleman, but
there will be others behind me. The
unslaked thirst of the big cities will
continue to roll fortunes in gold into
the laps of those who are strong enough
to take and hold control of the liquor
supply. The prohibition law will never
be enforced. Until people get tired of
the rotten stuff we give them, there will
always be rum runners and bootleggers.

  It would take the whole army and
navy to prevent the whisky pirates from
landing their cargoes at New Orleans
alone. There is a town that is the rum
runners’ dream of a perfect city. It is
so situated that all of the natural ad-
vantages are with the smuggler and
it has become the home of the syndicate
men, the ship owners, ship captains,
truck owners, salesmen and thugs who
form the motley bootleg army. The
pirates who infested New Orleans in
olden times never mustered a more
hardboiled, murderous bunch of men.
They make a handsome living bringing
in the liquor and since there are more
than eighty ways of getting a boat into
the Mississippi from deep water, hun-
dreds of islands where a schooner may
anchor, thousand of places where small
boats can unload and many routes into
the city, it will be seen th^t the risk is
really very small.

  To combat this vast army of men
who quench the nation’s thirst, the gov-
ernment had two cutters and between
thirty and fifty men on the job in New
Orleans. They might as well try to
drink all the water in the ocean. Now
and then they capture a fellow with a
small load, but I have never known
them to get their hands on one of the
big operators. If they catch a loaded
boat, the men who are sent to jail are
just hirelings.

  I believe that I know this game as
well as any man in the United States.

Certainly I have been a success at it.
I’ve gone all through the mill.

  To give you a clear, comprehensive
picture of the inside operations of the
liquor rings I am going to tell you my
own story. I am going to tell you
where the whisky is made, how it is
made, what it costs to manufacture,
how it is smuggled into the United
States, how it is sent to your home
town, how it is distributed and who
gets the huge profits that you pay every
time you buy a drop of illicit liquor.

  I am going to take the cover off the
underworld of booze and let you see
the distillers, label counterfeiters, sea
captains, gunmen, hi-jackers and boot-
leg kings in action. I am going to tell
you of the murder, blackmail, bribery,
graft and corruption of every kind
which is closely interwoven with the
activities of these men. The whole ma-
chinery of the enormous industry
which has resulted from the Eighteenth
Amendment will be revealed. None of
it will be opinion. It will be the facts,
the true story of a desperate young
man who saw an opportunity to win a
life of ease and luxury and took it.

CHAPTER II
The First Skirmish

FOR the proper beginning of my
narrative I must again go back to
that rainy night in New Orleans
when my friend Graves and I started
out to guard a cargo of liquor being
hauled in from a bootleggers' hangout
on Shell Beach.

  It was a night as dark as the inside
of a wolf’s stomach, with a fine rain
being driven in from the sea. I sat
in the rear of a lurching truck, a shot-
gun across my knees. Beside me was
“ Shady ’’ Smith, a noted and talented
administrator of lead poisoning. He
was a wicked little morsel of a man
with a bent beak of a nose and the
cauliflowered ears of a former ringster.

  “ New, ain't you?” asked Smith, tak-
ing a generous chew of cut-plug.
THE ROARING ROAD

  “ New on this job,” I replied, for
I had no intention of letting him know
that I was a green hand.

  “ Well, you picked a hot spot.
There's always hell to pay when the
booze hustlers fight among themselves.
And Bascom’s gang has been gettin’
away with so much murder that he
thinks he owns all the hooch that’s
shipped into New Orleans. Baby,
won’t he get fooled if he monkeys with
this layout.”

   “ I’ll tell the world,’’ said T.

  Smith leaned out of the jolting vehi-
cle and peered into the darkness ahead.

  “ Guess we’re all here. Got three
big trucks and four hearses to-night.”

  “ Hearses?”

  “ Sure. Didn’t you ever hear of
that racket before. One of Kid Hurd’s
brightest ideas. The booze that goes
to his joint, goes in trucks: the stuff
that goes through the town and north
travels in undertakers’ dead wagons.
They split up. Each travels a different
route and who the hell would ever
think of looking for tiger-juice in a
nice, pretty gray hearse? Neat, eh?”

  I laughed to myself. Truly, there
was more to this bootlegging game
than I had suspected. A resourceful
fellow with a little ingenuity and a
small organization could make a for-
tune. Right then I began to lay plans
for the future.

  The truck came to a shuddering halt.

  “ Here we are,” said Shady Smith,
and tumbled out of the truck, lugging
his sub-machine gun. I followed suit
and saw that we were at the water's
edge on a narrow, sandy beach. The
trucks and hearses were turned around
and the work of loading them with
the cases of whisky and tins of alcohol
began. The stuff had been piled upon
the beach and was being watched by
a picked crew of Hurd’s gunmen.

  As I came up to my truck with a
tin of alcohol, I passed Graves.

   “ Great stuff isn’t it?” he asked.

   “ It is,” said I. “ It looks like we’re
in a big game, all right.”

  As each vehicle was filled it started
back toward the city, a guard on the
front seat beside the driver and an-
other sitting in the body with the
liquor. The men worked like machines.
Each fellow knew his job and did it
with precision.

  When our truck was ready, Smith
found me and restored my wreapon.

   “ I’ll ride with the driver,” he said.
“ You get in the back and stay there.
If anybody starts anything with us,
you stick in the back. Don’t hop out
into the road. If you do, they'll get
you. The edge will be yours if you’re
shooting at ’em from the inside. This
canvas top won't protect you from bul-
lets, but it ’11 hide you. Get me?’’

  I got him. The ride back to the
city began. I could see nothing. There
was nothing to do but wait develop-
ments. Once or twice the truck came
to a halt and I sat up, tense and alert,
with my shotgun ready. But we moved
on again and I relaxed, leaning against
a case of liquor and wondering how
much I would be paid for the trip.

  We had gone about halfway to our
destination when I was jolted out of
my reverie by Smith's hoarse, excited
voice.

  “ There’s something doing down the
line!” he bawled. “ Heads up now!”
The truck stopped, then crawled for-
ward slowly, growling along in low
gear. There came a brief rattle of
rifle and pistol fire. The truck swayed
into a ditch.

  Chak, chak, chak, chak! Smith’s ma-
chine gun ate into a belt of clips and
spat death into the night.

  “ Take that, you thieving dogs!" he
howled. The gun chattered again. I
crouched on my knees, with my shot-
gun ready for action, but there was no
need. It was all over in an instant.,
A gang of hi-jackers” had tried to cut
off the truck just ahead of us, had
shot and seriously wounded one of the
guards, but had fled into the surround-
ing woods when Mr. Smith arrived
with his stuttering weapon.
586

DETECTIVE FICTION WEEKLY

  “ I told you we’d get ’em!” exulted
that worthy. His white teeth gleamed
in the darkness. “ Wait until I tell
Hurd. We’ll get a bonus for this
-night’s work.”

  The trucks climbed back to the road-
way and proceeded cautiously into the
city without further difficulty. We
drove to a dry goods store in a middle-
class neighborhood, unloaded our
liquor and stowed it in the cement-
lined basement under the place. Then
the six of us, including the driver and
two guards from the other truck, got
into a small touring car and hurried to
Hurd’s saloon where Smith recited the
details of the encounter.

  “ Good work,” said Hurd. He
scratched a few words on a piece of
paper and handed it to the gunman.
“Here, give this to Limpy. See you
to-morrow night. May have some stuff
cached down on that bayou by then.”

  We reentered our machine and drove
to a water front warehouse which we
entered by a secret door. Up two
flights of stairs and we came out into
a large room where a man sat behind
a kitchen table. He was Hanked by
four heavily armed ruffians. This man
at the table was unlike an ordinary
human being. He was stoop-shoul-
dered with a mean, narrow face and
ratlike, anxious eyes. Before him was
a dirty ledger and a pile of currency.

  “ Hello, Limpy!” said Smith with
easy familiarity. “ We come for our
dough.”

  The man l)ehind the table snickered.

  “Always first, aren't you?” he
asked.

  “ I like to get paid,” admitted Smith.
“ You act as though you were giving
away a quart of your blood every time
you fork over. I earned my money
to-night. Look at this.” He tossed
the paper which Hurd had given him
upon the table.

  Limpy looked at it carefully. Then
he dipped into the currency and
counted out fifty dollars.

  “ Twenty-five for the trip and twen-

ty-five for saving the truck,” he said
grudgingly.

  “ This guy gets the same,” said
Smith pointing to me. Limpy paid me
off and then began counting out money
for the others.

  “ Well, kid,” laughed Smith. “ I
guess that’s all for to-night. See you
to-morrow. Maybe we'll ride together
again.”

  We left Limpy writing in his dirty
ledger and I set out to find Graves to
see howr he had fared on our first night
of adventure as the paid hirelings of
the rum ring. I had made fifty dollars
and was content. The fact that I might
just as easily have been lying at the side
of a lonely road with my hide full of
bullet holes, did not enter into my cal-
culations. This was the game for me
and all manner of wild schemes raced
through my head as I strode through
the darkened streets.

CHAPTER III

A Dead Man’s Cargo

ONCE more we sat in the Piccadily
Cafe, Graves and I, and this time
we looked upon our world and
found it good. We had been working
for Hurd for two months. We had
made a stake and were restless with
the plans which wre had been discussing
while we watched over our employer’s
whisky. We had agreed to seize the
first opportunity to get into the rum
game for ourselves.

  And nowr Graves, smoking a cigar
and looking quite prosperous in a new
suit of clothes, was outlining a propo-*
sition.

  “ There’s an old guy over near Point
a la Hache who has about fifty cases
of Scotch that he wants to let go of.
He’s broke. Brought the stuff in and
landed it on the beach, then got in 3
row with his pals and drove them off
with a gun. He hasn’t been able to
get a truck and even if he had one,
lie's afraid to try to make it into town.
Figures his former friends tipped off
THE ROARING ROAD

587

Bascom and fears that the hi-jackers
are laying for him.

  “ We could buy the stuff cheap, prob-
ably as low as twenty dollars a case.
We could sell it right here for thirty-
five and if we wanted to run it north
we could get a lot more. Of course,
if we get stuck up our investment is
sunk. Want to take a chance?”

  “ Sure,” I said, without hesitation.
“ This whole game is based on chance.
I can get Smith to help us.”

  “ And I could get the truck,” said
Graves. “ We'll drag the hooch in and
peddle it to Burney. He's got a flock
of phony milk trucks going to St. Louis
next week.”

  We were mulling the scheme over
in our minds when a girl in a short
red dress and a ro\V of spangles around
her neck came up to our table. She
was one of Hurd’s entertainers.

  “ You gave me a five-dollar bill last
night,” she said to Graves.

  “Yeah.” he agreed. “I gave it to
you to get rid of you. Think you can
tap me every night?”

  The girl smiled at him.

  “ No, I just want to tell you some-
thing. Bascotn’s on your trail and you
better look out. I was told all about
it by a red-hot who hangs out in. his
gambling hall. Bascom says you two
birds kept him from copping one of
Hurd's trucks and pumped one of his
best men full of lead. He’s looking to
get even.”

“ Thanks,” said Graves dryly.
“We’ll take care of brother Bascom.”
When the girl left he turned to me.
“ Looks like we’ve made an enemy.”
“ It’s a bluff,” said I. “If we can
get a start on this first job, we’ll hire
Smith and a few of his hardboiled
friends away from Hurd, and they can
all go to hell. Let’s have a drink.”

  “ Not me,” objected Graves. “ The
more I see of this bootleg stuff the
more I like orange juice. We better
go see Hurd and arrange to get off to-
morrow.”

  So it was that we journeyed toward

Point a la Hache the next night in a
rattling truck, outward bound on the
first of our many bootlegging adven-
tures. In the rear, with his legs hang-
ing over the side, was Mr. Shady
Smith, a machine gun in the crook of
his arm.

  Thirty miles from town we parked
the truck at the side of the road, left
Smith with it, and struck off through
the brush and scrub trees. Presently
we came to a trail which we followed
with the aid of a flash light and soon
we emerged into a little clearing. I
saw a sort of a shack, an open affair,
with a canvas roof supported by four
posts. Under the canvas was a table
and at one end of the table was a man.

  “ Asleep,” said Graves. “ Come on,
make some noise. He’s liable to get
excited and drill us.”

  We walked noisily forward. The
man, suddenly awakened, jumped to
his feet, a gun in his hand.

  “ Steady,” called Graves. “ We’ve
come to take the white elephant off
your hands.”

  The fellow grinned sheepishly and
lowered his weapon.

  “ I remember you,” he said. “ You
were over here last week. Well, I’ll
be glad to get out. I’m about dead for
sleep and I figured some of these high-
binders would have my stuff before I
could sell it.”

  “ We’ve got nine hundred dollars,”
said Graves. “ It’s yours for the
liquor, providing you help us load it.
That’s a good price, since we are tak-
ing all the chances.”

  “ It isn’t as much as I expected,”
replied the runner, “ but I guess it will
do. I’m in no spot to bargain. Come
on, let’s get busy.”

  'I passed over the money and the
work of loading the liquor began. The
cases were hidden in the brush back
of the camp and we were hours getting
them out and down to the truck. When
the cargo was stowed and we were
ready to leave, Graves invited the run-
ner to ride into town with- us.
588

DETECTIVE FICTION WEEKLY,

  “Not a chance!” was his reply.
“ Why? Because I’m afraid you boys
will never get there. No, sir, I’ll walk.’’
And with that cheering pronounce-
ment he ducked off into the weeds and
was gone.

  “ Look sharp, now,” commanded
Graves who was driving. “ Shoot first
and talk to the corpse afterward. If
these buzzards get the jump on us,
we're done.”

  We moved forward slowly and with-
out lights.

  It had been a dark night when we
started out, with a sultry premise of
rain in 'the air, but now the moon was
climbing the sky. a dim silver bubble,
striving against the heavy clouds. We
could see the road as it stretched out
ahead of us.

  “ A little light won't hurt,” said
Graves. “ We can get a look at any-
body that comes along, anyway.”

  As he spoke he jammed on the
brakes, threw out the clutch and we
rolled to a silent stop.

  “ Something around that next curve.
Looks like a truck. You and Smith
scout ahead. I’ll stay here.”

  Smith came from the rear with his
machine gun and together we hurried
along the road, turning the corner cau-
tiously.

  “Truck,” whispered the gunman in
my ear. There it stood, a heavy, well-
made machine with a brown canvas
cover. There' was not a soul in sight.
We hurried forward.

  “ Holy Smoke!” cried Smith who
was in the lead. “ There's a dead guy
on the runnin' board. Plunked right
through the head!”

  The man was sprawled out in awk-
ward fashion, his head and shoulders
jammed under the wheel, his legs dan-
gling on the running-board. Smith, ig-
noring the body, trotted to the rear of
the truck and lifted the canvas.

  “Loaded! Boy, this is just like
finding money! Come on, let’s try to
start her up.”

  We worked for ten minutes and gave

up in disgust. The battery was evi-
dently dead.

  “ That's why them hi-jackers didn't
move her,” explained Smith. “ They
bumped this guy off, then they went
away and left the whole works when
the rig wouldn’t start. Say. I’ll bet a
bullet musta hit the battery, eh?” He
lifted the floor-boards of the car quick-
ly. “ Sure enough! Knocked it all to
hell. Well, we ain’t beat yet. We can
shove her. Hurry, the boys will be
back here pretty quick.”

  We jogged back to the waiting
Graves and explained the situation. He
agreed readily with Smith’s suggestion
and a few minutes later we were again
on our way to town. This time we
had two trucks loaded with liquor in-
stead of one!

  Urged on by Smith, Graves made
good time, although it was awkward
work shoving the seized truck and we
had nothing to use for a towline. It
was almost dawn when we pulled up
to the garage owned by a gentleman
named Burney. The garage was just a
blind. Mr. Burney was one of the
most extensive liquor wholesalers in
New Orleans. We drove into the place
and Graves and Burney talked in low
tones in one corner.

  When Graves returned to us, he
said:

  “ All fixed. Burney takes the whole
works and he’ll get rid of the truck so
nobody’ll know who grabbed off their
hooch. We’ll come back for our wagon
to-morrow. All right ?”

  “ Fine,” said I, “ if the price is
right.”

  “ It’s one hundred per cent profit on
the stuff we bought and two thousand
for the other.”

  “ Okay,” approved Smith, and the
bargain was struck. We gave Smith
a third on the truck we bad found and
went home and to bed, very well satis-
fied with the result of our initial ven-
ture as big-league bootleggers. It had
been an interesting night, we had made
more than two thousand dollars, and
TIIE ROARING ROAD

580

our belief that we were in the right
business had been confirmed.

  We realized, of course, that we
could have made more with the proper
kind of backing and organization.
Graves mentioned it the next day when
we were talking over our plans.

  “ Burney will truck that stuff to
Kansas City and almost double his
money,” said Graves. “He is in touch
with a mob and he gets the best prices
possible. That’s what we should be
doing, buying this stuff at the beach
and selling it to saloon keepers up
north where liquor is worth big jack.
I know where I can get enough for two
trucks. Suppose we make a stab at
peddling it in St. Louis?”

  “ It sounds good to me,” said I.
“How do we go about it?”

  “ Here's the dope. I’ve been keep-
ing my ears to the ground ever since
we worked for Hurd, and there’s two
things I know we need. One is a place
to store the stuff and the other is a
stand-in with a certain gangster in St.
Louis. This fellow controls the whis-
ky business there and he is lined up
with politicians who carry the keys to
the jail.

  “ If we get in right with them, there
is no limit to our market. We can run
all the booze we want to and clean up.
Suppose you hop a rattler north, buy
some kind of a business joint as a blind
and put the fix on the gang leader and
his friends?”

  “ A good idea,” I replied. “ In the
meantime you can snoop around and
get another bunch of liquor lined up.”

CHAPTER IV

Graves Gets Vengeance

A FEW" days later I was in St.
Louis, registered at a good hotel
and spending most of my time
reading newspaper advertisements of
various business concerns which were
for sale. One by one I looked the
prospects over and finally I found a
place that appealed to me as being al-

most perfect for our purposes. It was .
a feed store 011 the South Side, ap-
parently on its last legs, for the Ger-
man proprietor was glad to sell out,
lock, stock and barrel for a thousand
dollars down and my note for a like
amount. He was voluble in his de-
scription of his wonderful establish-
ment. He did not know that I had no
interest in anything save the fine, dry,
strong basement underneath.

  Now for the gangster. I had learned
by now that one of the most important
things in my new profession was to
know the right people. It is seldom
that the rum runner approaches the
representatives of the law themselves.
He usually works through other per-
sons. In this case I was depending 011
the gangster to pull the correct political
strings and see that our trucks were
not molested either by the authorities
or by the thugs who made a business
of robbing honest hooch carriers.

  I met my man in his St. Louis
County resort. It did not take me
long to outline my proposition, and I
tossed in the name of Hurd to help
things along.

  When I had finished, he looked at
me from brooding eyes and said:

   “ It’ll cost you five bucks a case.”

  “ That’s fair enough.”

  “ You won’t be bothered by the red-
hots,” went on the gangster. “ and the
law will lay off as long as you work on
the quiet. Phone me from down the
line each time you come in. One of
my boys will meet you, count the cases
and take the dough. Then he’ll ride in
with you. There’ll be no trouble.”
We shook hands 011 the bargain and
I left to return to New Orleans, where
I found Graves fuming and fretting at
the delay. He had two good cargoes
spotted and he craved action. He got
it.

  We rented three trucks, hired
Shady Smith and several of his rough-
neck pals, and headed north. The
trip was completed without trouble,
the whisky was stored in the base-
590

DETECTIVE FICTION WEEKLY

ment of the feed store, and in a
week it was all sold to St. Louis bar
owners and we were back Ifome with
more money than either or both of us
had ever seen in all our lives.

  “ We need a bigger layout,’’ de-
clared Graves. “ We’re working on
too small a scale. Just think how much
dough we could make if we pulled off
one of these trips every week.”

   Acting on his suggestion, I hired an
office in a down town building where I
set myself up as the representative of
a New York leather company, and
from this place we transacted all our
business. Graves became the buying
agent and I handled the arrangements
for the transportation and sale of the
stuff at the other end, with the mur-
.derous Mr. Smith as my first assistant.

  It was a busy life. We worked
night and day, sleeping and eating
when and where we could. We bought
cargo after cargo from the independent
shippers running out of Cuba and
various South American ports and sold
the liquor—S c o t c h and Canadian
whisky and raw alcohol—in St. Louis,
Louisville and Kansas City. Our con-
nections in all three of those towns
were excellent and grew better as our
importance in the underworld in-
creased in proportion to the size of our
bank roll.

   Despite our success, I found myself,
at times, in the depths of despair. For
a fellow who would have peace and
quiet and the caresses of a wife and
children it was a hopeless outlook. For
a man who would sleep in a bed and
smoke his pipe in security it was a bad
business. We lived violently and gave
promise of dying the same way. We
wore bullet-proof vests, never went out
minus our pistols, spent our nights on
the front seat of a lurching truck and
our days in plotting our schemes of
bribery and corruption.

  Graves usually jollied me out of
these fits of depression.

   “You’re in the greatest game in the
world,” he would say. “ In a few

years you can quit and do just as you
damned please for the rest of your life.
Snap out of it.”

  His words were unnecessary. I knew
I was sitting pretty, and I had no in-
tention of quitting, but I could not help
but wonder, now and then, if the effort
was worth the result.

  It was at this stage in our careers
that we were dealt a blow that almost
ruined us.

  We had invested a large part of our
capital in four truck loads of whisky
and had delegated Smith and his bullies
to bring it into New Orleans. Bascom
and his gang, after lying low for
several months, came out of hiding
suddenly, surrounded our vehicles on
the road, killed one of our men,
wounded Smith and drove away with
their loot.

  Graves swore dire vengeance when
he heard the news, but I reminded him
that vengeance would not restore our
stolen whisky or revive our waning
bank accounts.

  “ Then,” said he, “ I’ll figure out
some way to get our money back, if we
have to hold Bascom up and rob him.”

  It was days before he perfected his
plan, but I found him in our little
apartment one night, bubbling .over
with enthusiasm.

  “I’ve got it!” he cried. “Here’s
where we stick Bascom. We’ll get our
cash and have a good laugh at his
expense. Remember Jacobs, the loan
shark?”

  I said that I recalled the gentleman
as an extremely unsavory individual
who frequented The Tavern, a gam-
bling house in which Bascom was re-
ported to have a financial interest.

  “ He’s more than that,” said Graves.
“ He’s Bascom’s agent, sort of a society
bootlegger. He was well acquainted
among the wealthy people of the town,
and he keeps them supplied with liquor
at fancy prices. All of Bascom’s best
stuff goes to Jacobs and they split the
profit.

  “ A shrewd fellow from all that I
THE ROARING ROAD

591

can hear. The story of how he got his
start is a good example of the man’s
ability. He ferreted out a society
dame who was rather hard up for cash.
This lady was famous for her parties.
Jacobs made a deal with her. Every
time a guest asked where she got her
fine liquor she replied: 'From a very
high-class gentleman, Mr. Jacobs. He
handles only the best.’ Then she would
slip the guest Mr. Jacobs’s telephone
number. He would cut her in on the
profit, and they both did very well. A
clever bird, indeed, but I believe we
can put a fast one over on him. We
are going to sell him some liquor.”

  “ How will that get our money
back?” I demanded.

  “ Leave that to your uncle,” replied
Graves. “ Come on, we're going to
see him now. Bring your gat—you
may need it.”

  We walked to Mr. Jacobs’s establish-
ment, which was only three blocks
away, and came upon that oily gentle-
man in his tiny office, where he was,
ostensibly, a loan agent. He was ex-
pecting-its, for Graves had telephoned,
and after grunting an acknowledgment
of introductions he waved us to chairs.

“ What iss it you want?’’ he asked.
There was just the trace of an accent
in his soft voice. “ A loan, perhaps?”
“ No, Mr. Jacobs.” said Graves.
“ We’ve got some very fine whisky,
and we w^ere told that you handle the
best stuff in New Orleans. It’s all in
barrels, you can let it age as long as
you want to. It’s a bargain. Twelve
barrels for twenty-five hundred bucks.”
“So?” Mr. Jacobs pursed his fat
lips and raised his thick, black eye-
brows. “You will deliver it, yess?”
“Nope, we can’t do that. You'll
have to come after it. Somebody
might relieve us of it on the way. They
will know better than to touch you.”
Jacobs laughed.

  “Quite right,” he said. “Well, if
jour stuff iss good I can use it. I will
bring a truck and take a look to-
morrow night. Give me the address.”

  Graves wrote the street number on a
piece of paper and we departed. When
we were outside, Graves snorted and
said:

  “ Can you imagine that old buzzard1
Wanted us to deliver it so he could
stick us up. He won’t dare to try to
storm our own joint, though.”

  Apparently, if he had any thought of
robbing us, Mr. Jacobs had forgotten
it by the following evening, for he ap-
peared at our storage place with one
man and a small truck. Graves
took him down to the basement and
they went from barrel to barrel while
the wily bootlegger tasted the contents
of each.

  “ Very good!” he cried when he had
finished. “ I can use them. Remem-
ber, if you get any more like this,
Jacobs is the man. I will always give
you a fair price, and I know enough to
keep my tongue between my teeth.”
We helped roll out the barrels and
place them in the truck. Jacobs passed
over the money, held out his hand.
Graves shook it and they rattled away.

  “ Did it!” breathed Graves when the
machine turned the corner. “ Trimmed
him and trimmed him good! Lord,
what a yarn this will be for rum
row. Jacobs, the smartest guy in
town, buys one barrel of good whisky
for twenty-five hundred plasters. Oh.
boy, it’ll be good for a laugh ten years
from now.”

  “ One barrel,” I objected. “ It
looked like twelve to me.”

  “ Twelve barrels,” corrected Graves.
“ but only one barrel of whisky. I was
a week getting those things made. Each
one had a false bottom, was just the
right amount of wood for weight. The
whisky is 011 top, there is nothing but
wood below. It took exactly one bar-
rel of the best stuff money could buy to
fill those barrels. Do you see the
light?”

  I	did, and I enjoyed the joke nearly
as much as Graves did. It was a real
accomplishment. ' We had most of
our money back, plus the very real
592

DETECTIVE FICTION WEEKLY

satisfaction of having put one over on
our ancient enemy. By the next day
the story was all over the city, and ail
the rum kings, hi-jackers and sea cap-
tains were talking about it. The
righteous Mr. Jacobs was said to be
three times as angry as a rattlesnake in
August. Bascom's reaction to our little
joke was not made public.

CHAPTER V

Hooch War

WE soon forgot the incident under
the stress of protecting and ex-
panding our own interests.
From this point on wre grew rapidly.
We acquired additional capital from
an attorney, who was a pillar of his
church, but who was not above invest-
ing five thousand dollars in what looked
like a sure thing.

  Our syndicate continued to buy from
the independent skippers, and in a few
months we were taking nearly every-
thing they could bring in. If our mar-
ket got much larger we might be hard
put to till the demand. I mentioned
this to Graves and he countered by
buying a small power boat which he
put under the command of Shady
Smith.

  There are two kinds of ocean-going
rum runners, you know. The ships
which are owned by syndicates and
which run in close to shore are under
one classification, while the boats
which lay outside the twelve mile limit
and wait for customers come under the
other. These latter ships are usually
owned by their skippers, who do not
care to take chances of losing their
craft by running the blockade. They
prefer to loaf along, out of the reach of
the coast guard cutters, until somebody
comes along to buy and unload their
cargoes. It was to meet these latter
boats that Graves made his purchase.

   It was at this stage of things that we
began to meet the grafters. Wre were
just getting big enough to merit their
attention. Naturally there were some

spots where we were more than will-
ing to make an investment in protec-
tion, but for the most part we turned
down the proposals of the petty of-
ficials and peanut politicians. Graves
was hardboiled about it, too.

  “ You can’t do us any good,” he told
them, “ and we won't pay you a dime.
If you think you can make it tough for
us, step right out and try it. Two
can play at that game.”

  We had one or two influential gentle-
men on our pay roll in New Orleans.
We also kicked in to three or four con-
stables on the road north and we con-
tinued to pay the St. Louis gangster
who delivered the goods for us in his
territory until the government sent him
to Leavenworth for being so indiscreet
as to rob the United States mails.

  However, while we did not pay out
a great deal as we went along, we al-
ways knew where money would square
almost anything except murder.

  Graves and I made it a rule to play
ball with our friends. If they helped
us, we helped them. There was not
anything, within reason, that we would
not do to assist the boys who were in-
strumental in making our game a suc-
cess. There was no sentiment at-
tached to it. We knew that it was
good business, that it would pay real
dividends in the future—and we in-
tended to be rum runners for some
time to come.

  An example of the way we worked:
There was a prosecuting attorney in
Missouri who had made it very easy
for our trucks to run through his
count}r. Despite all kinds of opposi-
tion, he had used political pressure to
force the sheriff and his deputies to let
us alone. Election time was drawing
near. The prosecutor was under fire
from his opponent and in several of
the newspapers. It looked as though
he was certain to be defeated for re-
election. He came to New Orleans
and appealed to Graves for assistance.

  “ Go back home,” said Graves, “ and
defend your record in a few speeches.

i D
THE ROARING ROAD

593

Bring the bootlegging issue up. Get
them to talking about it. As soon as
some politician or newspaper demands
to know why you haven't made war on
the rum runners, send me a wire. I’ll
do the rest.”

  The wire came a week later. Graves
loaded up an old truck with some odds
and ends of whisky and alcohol which
we had in one of our warehouses. He
started it north in charge of two of
our men.

  Then he called the prosecutor on
the telephone and, in a guarded con-
versation, gave him his instructions.

  The next night the prosecuting at-
torney, single-handed, seized a whiskv-
laden truck as it passed through his
town. In a battle with the desperadoes
—according to the local newspapers—
more than twenty shots were fired.
Both men escaped, but the whisky was
the prosecutor’s prize. It was poured
into the sewer with appropriate cer-
emonies and plenty of photographers.
When the ballots were cast and counted
our friend had been returned to office
with a record-breaking majority and
our rum trucks continued to roll
past the courthouse every night.

  “ That’s the way to do it,” said
Graves. “ Now, if nothing happens in
St. Louis, New Orleans, Louisville or
Kansas City we are all set to make
that million dollars in mighty short
order.”

  It developed that Graves was a bit
optimistic. We had a long way to go
and the road was to be rather rocky.

  I was sitting in the leather company
office discussing ways and means with
Shady Smith when the door was
thrown open and in walked Hurd, the
man who gave us our first job in the
whisky game. We had always been
friendly with him; in fact, we had
effected a sort of a combine to present
a more united front against the raids
of Bascom and his hi-jackers.

  “ Howdy, gents,” said Hurd. “ I
come as the bearer of sad tidings.
Brother Bascom has figured out a new

2	D

one, and if it works we're out of
business.”

  “ Aw, sit down,” retorted Smith.
“You musta been drinking your own
stuff. How can Bascom put us on the
bum?”

  “ Just like this,” said Hurd, sitting
down and lighting a cigar. “ He has
served notice on all the independent
skippers that they will not be allowed
to sell to you fellows or to me. If
they do, he threatens to put his men in
boats and start raiding them. Most of
these lousy sea captains are scared to
death of Bascom. I’m afraid lie’s
going to make it tough. He orders
them to sell to Charley Crouse. They
get the same price, why not? Save
themselves trouble, see?”

  “ A sort of an embargo,” said I.
“We’re out. Crouse gets all the
business.”

  “ Exactly.”

  “ Say,” snarled Smith. “ You
birds aren’t going to let him get away
with this, are you ?”

  Hurd shrugged.

  “How are you going to stop him?
If he can bluff the skippers, he’s got
us on the pun.”

   “ I’ll bet Graves won’t stand for it,”
growled Smith. “ We’ll see what he
has to say.”

  Graves had plenty to say. But he
ref-used to fall in with Smith's proposal
for a war to the finish with Bascom’s
crowd.

  “ A waste of time and money,” he
declared. “ Wre don’t want a long
drawn-out fight if we can avoid it.
This thing simply means that we will
have to do what we should have done
a long time ago. We will go- into the
shipping end of this game, too. We’ll
form a syndicate, the three of us, with
shares to a few outsiders. Then we’ll
buy a boat or two, hire our own, cap-
tains and bring over our own booze. In
the long run we will make twice as
much money as we make now.”

  “ But we take twice as many risks,”
objected Hurd.
594

DETECTIVE FICTION WEEKLY

  “Risks!” shouted Graves. “Of
course there’ll be risksV This whole
game is made up of risks. The fellow
that takes ’em is the fellow who col-
lects. You’ve got to come in with us
in self-defense. If you don’t Bascom
will break you.”

  Hurd smiled.

  “ I guess you’re right,” he admitted
“ I’ll get busy in the morning and
see if this is as bad as it’s supposed to
be,” went on Graves. “ If it is, I’ll
take steps to buy a ship and get a cap-
tain. We’ll meet here to-morrow at
noon and clean up the whole affair.
I’ll show this bozo Bascom a thing or
two about his own specialty.”

  “What do you mean?”

  “ 1 mean that I am going to organize
a crew of hi-jackers and rob Bascom of
his stolen goods as fast as he gets ’em.
Watch me.”

  “Attaboy!” yelled Smith. “I ap-
point myself chief hi-jacker.”

  “ Shut up!” barked Hurd. “ You
crazy guys will have us all in the gov-
ernment’s boarding house. If you are
going to start a free-for-all battle you
can count me out. I’m not afraid of
Bascom, but I’m not going to get
mixed up in a hooch war that won't
get us any.place.”

  “ This won’t be a hooch war,” said
Graves. “ The first thing to do is to
get ourselves fixed up, then we can take
care of Bascom nice and quiet like.
Wre'll just hoist his stuff and what the
hell will he do about it?”

  “ Nothing,” answered Smith.

  “ And you better come in with us,
Hurd,” went on Graves, “ or you’ll be
busted flatter than a pancake. How
about it?”

  “ Oh, well, declare me in. But keep
your heads. Don’t let that blood-
thirsty Smith start a lot of shooting.”

  “ I'll keep my head,” growled
Graves. “ I’m in this business to make
the dough. Getting even with Bascom
is incidental. Now you boys amuse
yourselves for the afternoon and I'll go
out and talk turkey with the agents of

some of these yellow-livered skippers.
If things are as bad as they’re cracked
up to be I’ll be back here this evening
with some real news. See you then.”

  Graves stalked out. The three of us
went to Limpy’s pay-off room in the
warehouse and played pitch for two or
three hours, ate in an Italian restaurant
and returned to the office to find
Graves, grinning like a donkey, wait-
ing for us.

  “ Brother Bascom has certainly put
the fix on the boys,” said he. “ All of
’em a#e scared pink. Wouldn’t talk to
me. Said it wasn’t even healthy to be
in the same neighborhood. We can’t
buy one dime’s worth of liquor from
the boats. But we should worry. I
bought a boat. Remember, the old
Romolda? Well, she’s ours and—”

  “ That old tub!” yelled Hurd. “ Why
the lousy scow won’t hold together for
one trip.”

  “Yes, she will, and one trip’s all we
need. If we lose her we won’t be in so
deep. Anyway, I’ve bought her and
I’ve got Cagle for a skipper. Guess
that isn’t good, eh?”

  Captain Cagle was the toughest sea-
going man on the New Orleans water
front. A man-breaker and a man-
driver who was feared and hated
wherever he was known, he had a rep-
utation for square dealing that was
something unusual among the motley
army of double crossing cheaters who
made up the rum rings. Queer tales
were whispered about the wharves
about Cagle. It was said that he was
a madman. Bloody yarns were told
of how he had beat off and sunk a boat
manned by hi-jackers, how he had sub-
dued a mutinous crew and, had thrown
-some of the members to the sharks.

  “ Cagle is a good man,” said Hurd.
“ He’s tough as leather, but he is 011
the level. If anybody can bring that
old mudboat of yours into port, it’s
Cagle. Where are you going to get a
crew?”

  “ The captain is picking them,” re-
torted Graves. “ He’s making the
THE ROARING ROAD

rounds of the joints now. Expects to
have all hands ready by to-morrow
noon.

  “ Now here’s the lay of the land.
One of us birds will have to go to Cuba
and buy the cargo. The other two can
stay here, make plans for landing the
stuff and take care of Bascom. Who’ll
make the trip?”

  “ I’d like to go,” said I. “ I’m a
sailor. I could probably help out if
anything happens.”

  “ Wouldn’t mind going mvself,” said
Hurd.

  Graves laughed, then said:

  “ We’ll draw. The fellow that gets
the short piece of paper takes the ride.”
He tore up three strips of paper,
turned his back and arranged them in
his hand. Hurd drew first. I fol-
lowed. Graves took the one that was
left. We held them up. I had won.
1 was going to Cuba to buy a cargo of
liquor for the Romolda.

CHAPTER VI

Where Bootleg Liquor Grows

1WENT to a party the other night.
The host, one of those amiable busi-
ness men—fat, florid and forty—
was very proud of his private stock.
.For my benefit, he went down into his
basement and brought up an assort-
ment of bottles covered with fancy
labels. He exhibited them proudly,
extolling the virtues of each.

  “ The best stuff money can buy,”
said he. “No bootleg liquor for mine.
I get this direct from the fellow who
runs it in. He charges me plenty, but
it’s worth it. Here, taste this.”

  He uncorked a bottle of Scotch and
poured out two generous drinks. We
downed it. The stuff was passable,
but that was all. I recognized it im-
mediately. It had never seen Scot-
land. It was from Cuba. Perhaps
my own syndicate had brought it in!

  My host, hypnotized by the beautiful
labels, actually believed that he was
drinking first-class liquor.

  There are thousands of persons like
him in this country to-day. They suf-
fer, in more ways than one, from the
belief that any kind of liquor brought
in on a boat is, naturally, good liquor.
Nothing could be further from the
truth. A fine label which sets forth
that a bottle contains Scotch, rye, bour-
bon or Gordon gin means no more
than a fine dress upon a handsome
woman. The drinkers let their eyes
deceive their stomachs.

  Let me make this point here and
now:

     There is very little real liquor in the
   United States. The Warehouse whisky
   is diluted, the moonshine is poison and
   the stuff which is run in from South
   America and Cuba is of "un inferior
   grade. The man who tells you he is
   selling you real whisky, gin or cham-
   pagne is a liar. Practically speaking,
   there is no such animal.

  When prohibition came along and
created another giant industry, those
bent on violating the law went to Eng-
land, France and Scotland for their
goods. But it was a long and expensive
trip. The profits did not compensate
the runners for the risk. And then,
as the available liquor supply in the
United States was consumed, the
drinkers became less particular. Some
of them took to hair tonic. Others
drank one-day old moonshine. Any-
thing that had a kick in it was market-
able. So, said the bootleggers to them-
selves, why should we give these peo-
ple real whisky when they will drink
something half as good? And where,
they asked themselves, can we manu-
facture the stuff without interference
from the law?

  Cuba provided the answer and Cuba
took this new industry to her heart.
Now, nearly all of the booze consumed
in the United States is made there.
Hundreds of distilleries have sprung
up. The stuff is turned out over night.
It is about half as good as the cheap
whisky of other days. Bottles are
decorated with counterfeit labels and
596

DETECTIVE FICTION WEEKLY

liquor supposedly from all points of
the compass is made to order for the
rum rings. And the American public,
which has lost its sense and itsHaste,
drinks the stuff and likes it.

  The base for most all the varied
liquors manufactured in Cuba is the
same—alcohol made from sugar cane.
It is easily and quickly produced and
sells for from twenty-five to thirty-five
cents a gallon. The same gallon of
alcohol in Chicago, St. Louis or Kansas
City costs from twelve to fourteen
dollars.

   I had no idea of the immensity of the
trade when I arrived in Havana with
Captain Cagle. We docked at a wharf
which had been constructed for rum
ships and which we had reserved by
cable. Then we left the boat, took a
taxicab, and went to the office of one
of the hundreds of brokers who made
a business of supplying the wants of
American skippers.

   “ I think I’ll take you to Jensen,”
said Cagle. “ He's honest and will give
you a good price.”

  “ Okay with me,” said I. Cagle had
won my confidence on the trip across.
He was a peculiar man, tall, lean, sun-
burned, with thick black hair and shin-
ing dark eyes. His high cheek bones
bespoke the Indian blood which un-
doubtedly coursed in his veins.

  We went to Jensen. He was a huge,
square-faced, tow-headed Swede who
greeted me with a grin and a bone-
crushing handshake.

  “ We want a load,” said Cagle. “ I
think about forty-five hundred cases
will do the trick. What have you got ?"

  “ Everything. I can give you what-
ever you want. Look over the price list
while I transact a little business in the
inside office.” He handed me a printed
sheet and left hurriedly.

  Together we examined the list.

  Jensen, like most of the Cuban
brokers, featured Scotch whisky and
he had a large assortment of the stuff
in his warehouses. The price list on
Scotch was as follows: “ Peter Daw-

son, -case—fifteen dollars; Haig and
Haig, case—twelve dollars; Lawson,
case—twelve dollars and fifty cents;
House of Lords, case—six dollars and
fifty cents; Old Smuggler, case—six
dollars and fifty cents.”

  For American and Canadian whisky
he had Hill and Hill at five dollars and
fifty cents a case; Green River at five
dollars and fifty cents a case and Wil-
liam Penn at fifteen dollars a case. He
also listed apricot, cherry and peach
brandies at ten dollars a case; cognac
at seventeen dollars and fifty cents a
case: benedictine at twenty-two dollars
a case, and all kinds of wine.

  When Jensen returned I told him
that we would take two thousand cases
of Scotch, a thousand "cases of Ca-
nadian, a thousand five-gallon tins of
alcohol and five hundred cases of
mixed brandies.

   “ Righto!” he cried.

  The order was made out and handed
to one of his assistants who hurried
away with it.

  “When can we get loaded?” asked
Cagle.

   “ We'll start right away,” said Jen-
sen. “ It’ll all be in your hold by late
to-morrow afternoon. You can bring
the money here to-morrow. Now that
we have business off our minds, let’s
go into my office and take a shot.”

   In the private office Jensen unlocked
a desk and produced a bottle and three
glasses.

  “ This actually came from Scot-
land,” he said. “ When I first got into
this game I ran a boat load of Scotch
in here to be used as flavoring for some
of this synthetic stuff. I’ve still got
enough of it left for my own needs.
Well, here’s how!”

  We sat and talked and drank'
through the warm, lazy afternoon.
Across from Jensen’s office were two
of the largest liquor wharves in Cuba
and from the window I could see the
thousands of cases of liquor piled up
and awaiting ships to take them to the?
United States. Trucks were arriving
THE ROARING ROAD

597

constantly from the warehouses, dis-
gorging more booze for thirsty Amer-
icans. Beyond ■ the wharves were
dozens of ships lying in to get their
cargo, fishing smacks, schooners with
auxiliary engines, several small steam-
ers and a beautiful high-powered
yachtlike affair with guns fore and aft.

  Prohibition! What a joke it was.
What a comedy! Hundreds of men
fighting, scheming, killing to get liquor
to thousands of other men and women
who had passed a law declaring it a
crime to sell or drink it. Six dollars
a case! In St. Louis six dollars
wouldn’t buy 'one bottle.

  Jensen was talking, telling of his ex-
periences.

  “ Four years ago you couldn’t sell
this synthetic booze for love or
money,” he was saying. “ Now you
can sell every bottle you can lay your
hands on and the distilleries are going
full blast. That’s because the supply
in the States has fallen away off.
There isn't any more good stuff and
the drinkers will stand for this phony
Scotch made out of sugar cane alcohol,
so why not give it to ’em?

  “ All you have to do is to preserve
the illusion. Ifvyou labeled your bot-
tles, ‘ Cuban whisky, made from sugar
cane,’ there isn’t a rum runner in New
Orleans or Miami that would look at
you. But if you put on a phony Scotch
or Canadian label, it’s fine. That’s
why Havana has one of the biggest
printing plants you ever saw, devoted
to printing bum labels for our booze.
The engravings are made by workmen
employed by the distillery owners.

  “ It reminds me of tbe time the boot-
leggers complained that we were mak-
ing our whisky cases out of Cuban
wood. They kicked like mules. Said
the customers were getting hep to the
fact that the hooch was synthetic. We
had to give in. Now all the whisky
cases made in Cuba are made out of
wood which is sent over here on a
schooner. There’s a big load of it out
there, right now. Can you beat that?”

  “ WThat about the bottles?” I asked.
“ Oh, they’re imported, too. No
facilities here for making them and
they wouldn’t measure up. The old
customer who drinks this stuff insists
on being fooled. He knows he's a
sucker, but he won’t admit it.

  “ Say, if a fellow could get control
of one of these distilleries along with
a distribution organization in the
States he could make a fortune so fast
he’d be dizzy. He could make this
stuff for a few cents a bottle and the
net profit would be something tre-
mendous. Too many people handle
this stuff now. Each one gets a cut
out of it.”

  “ You may hear from me on that,”
said I. “ My partner’s got big ambi-
tions in that direction. If we can get
the capital we may do something soon.”
“ I could swing a fourth interest in
a plant,” said Jensen. “How about
you, Cagle, want in ? You could be the
commodore of our fleet.”

  Cagle shook his head.

  “ No, the sea is all I know. I’m
afraid I’m too old a dog to get mixed
up in anything new. Sometimes I wish
I had the nerve and the ambition to
step out and make a lot of money, but
I haven’t.”

  Jensen laughed.

  “ Sounds funny,”- he commented,
“when a guy like you talks about
.nerve. You’re supposed to have plenty
of it.”

  “ Only in one way,” replied Cagle.
“ I’ve got the nerve to fight a gang of
drunken sailors, but I can’t burn all
my bridges behind me and become a
rum runner. I can command a ship
that carries booze, but I hang onto a
shred of respectability by pretending
that I am just the messenger. Queer,
perhaps, but that’s the way I feel
about it.”

  The conversation languished. Pres-
ently, Cagle and I departed, promising
to return to-morrow for another chat
before we sailed for home. We strolled
down the dock and watched the yawn-
598

DETECTIVE FICTION WEEKLY

ing holds being fdled with Cuban
liquor. At the Romolda an escalator
rattled and banged as the tins of alco-
hol were shot into the ship. One of
Jensen’s checkers stood near by, keep-
ing tab on the cargo as it was loaded.

   “ It '11 all be in by to-morrow noon,”
he said. “ We were short on Scotch
and had to have some made up before
we could fill the order.”

  “ Then we can leave by two o’clock,”
said Cagle. “ To-night we’ll go see
the Scratcher.”

  “The Scratcher? Who’s he?”

  “ You’ll see when we get there.”

  We dined at a hotel and returned to
the water front after dark. Cagle led
the way down a narrow, evil-smelling
street. He stopped in front of a house
and pushed the bell-button which was
set in the wall. A panel in the door
was opened cautiously and a pair of
eyes gleamed in the gloom.

  “ Ah, captain!” exclaimed a voice.
“ Come in. It has been some time
since we have seen you.”

  “ It has, that,” said Cagle. “Is the
boss in, Henry?”

  “ He is. He’ll see you in a minute.
Will you sit down here and have a
drink?”

  Henry brought the drinks and van-
ished. When he returned he announced
that his employer was ready for us
and we stepped into the next room.
A man, tall, lean, with narrow, droop-
ing shoulders, sat behind a mahogany
desk which was littered with papers.
Before him was a row of pens; at his
elbow were dozens of ink bottles; be-
hind him stood a drawing board on an
easel.

  He looked up as we entered and I
was struck immediately by his face,
which was deadly pale, and the burning
darkness of his eyes.

  “ Hello, captain!"

  When introductions had been accom-
plished, Cagle plunged into the object
of our visit.	/	. •

  “ Want some papers, Scratcher,” he
began. “ Need them by to-morrow. I

have to get out of here in a hurry and
I knew you wouldn’t turn me down.
You can get them out by morning for
me, can’t you?”

  “ I’ve got a lot ahead of me,” re-
plied the Scratcher, “ and my hand isn’t
as steady as it used to be. My eyes
are bothering me, cap. I’m afraid I’m
going to have some trouble.”

  “ Rubbish!” snorted Cagle. “ You’re
looking better than ever. How about
it? Can I drop around again in the
morning?”

  The Scratcher smiled wearily.

  “ I’ll start in right now. What do
you want, the usual stuff? Honduras
and New Orleans?”

  “Yes. The price will be the same
I suppose?”

  “ The same old three hundred.”

  We took our leave and as wre walked
back toward the hotel the captain told
me what it was all about. Every ship
engaged in international trade must ob-
tain clearance papers before leaving a
port. The papers set forth the name
of the ship’s owners, home port, the
cargo and the destination. Captain
Cagle had arranged to buy two sets of
forged papers, one showing our desti-
nation to be Honduras and our cargo
to be liquor, the second showing that
we were running into New Orleans
without cargo.

  “ Then if wre are boarded at sea by
a revenue cutter, I show ’em the Hon-
duras papers,” he explained. “ There’s
nothing they can do but let me alone,
and after we unload our stuff, I toss
the Honduras manifest overboard and
use the others to get into New Orleans
with. It’s the best scheme yet devised
for protection from the prohis.

  “ That’s one bill that I always ‘pay
myself, that three hundred for the
phony papers and I figure that it is well
worth the money. May keep me out
of the pen some day.”

  “ This Scratcher is an expert ?”

  “ The best in the business.”

  “ Oueer-looking fellow. Queer com-
plexion and funny-looking eyes.”
THE ROARING ROAD

  Cagle laughed grimly.

  “ He’s a sleigh rider. You know,
sniffs coke. Made a fortune writing
papers for booze hustlers and has spent
every dime of it on snow.”

CHAPTER VII
The Hi-jackers Attack

THE old Romolda, her insides
bulging with liquor, rolled like a
drunken man as she fought her
way toward the States through great
green seas. The sky was dark with
gray storm clouds and the howling
wind tore masses of foam from the
tops of the waves and hurled them at
the ship.

  No need to ask whether the glass
rose or fell with such a wind shrieking
about us. We were in for a hard light
and the success or failure of our ven-
ture depended upon the ability of this
old hooker to pound her way through
the vast stretch of tumbled waters,
tossed and tormented by the gale, boil-
ing and swirling as it smashed and
swayed to and fro.

  I stood on the bridge with Stilson,
the first officer.

  “ Looks bad,” said I.

  “ Rotten," he retorted bitterly.
“ This dirty old tub will be mighty
lucky if she gets through a sea like
this.”

  The day wore on. The Romolda
struggled and fought. A huge mass of
water swept over her forecastle head
and crashed against the upper bridge,
wrenching the lifeboats from their
davits.

  From aft there came a hoarse
shout—

  “ Engine room skylights carried
adrift!”

  The Romolda, moaning and groan-
ing in every rivet, rose slowly on the
crest of a great wave and slid down
into the trough.

  On the after well-deck members of
the crew struggled with the ship’s can-
vas. Others, not needed for the work,

had taken refuge against the sea in
the wheelhouse.

  As the Romolda rolled on her side
a man broke from the crowd around
the sails, shouting:

  “We’ll sink. We’re done. We’ll
never get ’ome, we won’t!”

  Instantly the members of the crew
dropped their work and gathered in
knots, muttering to themselves.

  “ We ought to take to the boats!”

  “ There’s a steamer on this lane.
Make Cagle send an SOS.”

  Stilson was bawling orders, cursing
and yelling for the men to get back on
the job.

  Suddenly Cagle appeared, dressed in
black oilskins. One hand clung to the
shattered bridge rail. The other
gripped a wicked-looking revolver.

  “ Back to work!” he roared, menac-
ing them with the weapon. “ You,
Givens, you dirty little cockney! I
heard you squawking about not getting
home. One more word out of you and
your home will be some shark’s belly.
Step lively!”

  Sullenly the men -returned to their
duties.

  “ A rotten gang,” said Cagle to me.
“ They'd scuttle the ship and take to
the boats in a minute.”

  All night long the booming gale held
us in its grip. We rolle'd and pitched
through the savage darkness, now in
the depths of despair and certain that
the next minute was our last and again
riding high and hoping for the best.
The wheelhouse was smashed. The
boats, ventilators and davits were so
much wreckage and still the Romolda
hammered ahead, her broken nose
pointed toward New Orleans. Cagle
never left his post. By the binnacle
light his face showed up, thin and
cruel; but his eyes were the eyes of a
man who would never surrender.

  “ Get us through and I’ll see that
you’re taken care of,” I told him.

  The captain smiled grimly.

  “ I never lost a ship to a storm,” he
said, “ and I never lost a cargo to a
600

DETECTIVE FICTION WEEKLY

hi-jacker. That's about all I’ve got to
be proud of.”

  By morning'the gloom had lifted.
The wind veered off. The glass began
to rise. We knew that the worst of
the gale was over. We were safe with
our precious load of liquor.

  All the next day we made good prog-
ress. The wreckage was cleared away.
The upper structure was patched.

  “ The old scow stood up pretty well,”
said Cagle. “ She's good for another
trip or so if she doesn’t run into more
bad weather."

  Sunset found us skirting the coast.
The watch was doubled to keep an eye
out for coast guard cutters and whisky
pirates. Cagle and his officers wore
automatics and sawed-off shotguns
were placed in handy places where fhey
could be reached by the crew in case
we were boarded.

  “ We'll run for it if we can,” ex-
plained Cagle, “but if they corner us,
they’ll get a hot reception.”

  When darkness came we nosed in-
shore without a light burning. From
time to time the engines were shut
down while the captain listened intently
for the throbbing engines of a pursuer.
Hearing none, we proceeded. Cagle
knew every foot of the way and lie
steered the craft without difficulty. The
channel was wider now, almost the size
of a small lake.

  “ Must be about here,” muttered
Cagle to himself. With a flash light he
consulted the written instructions
which Graves had given him before we
sailed. Then he ordered the motors
shut down. Holding the flash light be-
fore him he turned it off and on four
times.

  “ Watch,” he said.

  We strained our eyes peering into
the darkness. From far away toward
the shore came the answering winks
of light—four times.

“ Okay,” said Stilson. “ They’ve
spotted us and the coast is all clear.”
Twenty minutes later a small power
boat came alongside and Shady Smith

sang out his greeting from the dark-
ness.

  “All ready!” he cried. “Let’s get
going!”

  Another boat was in his wake and
presently three others appeared., The
work of unloading the ship began,
all hands, including the negro cook,
turned to. Cagle and I got into Smith’s
boat which, was the first to make the
run for shore. We wanted to see
Graves. I was hungry for news of
New Orleans and the rum kings.

  “ Looks like we’ve made it,” I said
to Cagle.

   “ Looks like it, but don’t be too sure.
You've got a long way to go yet.”

  “ Right,” said I.

  As we neared the sandy beach I
could make out a knot of men gathered
there. They came toward the water to
meet us. Graves’s bulky figure loomed
above his companions.

   As the boat ran its nose into the sand
our shouted greetings were stilled by a
shriek of terror from behind the dense
undergrowth which lined the shore.
Then a crowd of milling, fighting men
crashed through the brush and came
toward us.

  Graves’s face was a white mask of
fury.

  “ Bascom!” he bellowed. “ Bascom’s
gang has jumped our truck drivers!
Come on!”

  We leaped from the boat and joined
in the fray. It was too dark and the
quarters were too close for the use of
firearms. Knives, clubs and fists were
the only effective weapons. There was
scant time before the whole mad mob
was upon us and we were at handgrips
with the professional bullies hired by
Bascom.

  There was the scuff of sand, the
gasps and howls of men, the thud of
terrific blows. Now the melee sloshed
calf deep into the sea, now they were
on the sand swinging, kicking, biting
in primitive combat.

  Graves fought with the end of a
smashed whisky case, knocking his as-
THE ROARING ROAD

sailants right and left, blood stream-
ing from a great gash in his forehead.
Cagle, dour and silent, used his fists
and struck like a sharpshooter, making
every blow count. Every time he
lashed out with those terrible hands
a man went down.

    My side was numb from a blow that
  I did not remember. My nose bled
  freely. Using both hands on a rifle
  which I had picked out of the boat
  I cleared a space around me, then
  picked out a big, hulking ruffian and
  cracked his skull. As I did so another
  man dived for my legs and brought me
  down in the shallow water. Rolling
  - over to extricate myself from his
  grasp, I almost drowned before I got
  to my feet again. A blow with the
  barrel of the rifle ended the fellow who
  had tackled me and I returned to the
  fight.

    In the meantime the second boat
  came ashore and we were strengthened
  by ten men, enough reenforcement to
  make the contest more equal. Slowly
  we drove the attacking force back to-
  ward -the underbrush and then, as sud-
  denly as they had appeared, they broke
  and ran for cover.

    “Now!” bawled Graves. “Give it
  to ’em!”

    Shady Smith was ready. His auto-
  matic rifle chattered its song of death
  and bullets sang about the heads of the
  fleeing hi-jackers as they fled into the
  darkness.

    “ That’s enough,” said Graves. “ Let
  ’em go. Let’s make speed with the
  loading.”

    The fight was over. Not a man en-
  gaged in it had gone unscathed. Graves
  had suffered a scalp wound. Cagle’s
  face was a mass of beaten and bruised
  flesh. Smith was covered with blood.
  Several of the truck drivers were un-
  conscious, but none of them was seri-
  ously hurt. A broken arm seemed to
  be the worst of it.

    My side pained fearfully. One of
  my eyes was closed. My jaw ached.
  The whole world seemed to be sliding

about me crazily as I walked toward
the line'of trucks.

  “ You’re about all in,” said Graves.
“ You’re white as a sheet. Better go
in on the first truck. Come 011, I'll fix
it with the driver.”

  He conducted me to a machine, an
oil truck with a false end which could
be taken out to make rodm for liquor,
and said to the driver:

  “Take this fellow in to the station.
He’s all right.”

  A few minutes later we were rolling
down the dark road ‘toward New Or-
leans.

  I had a sawed-off shotgun across
my knees. I was earning my ride by
acting as guard.

  “ Wonder how they got wise to us ?”
I asked.

  “ Dunno,” said the young driver.
“ Bascom paid somebody for the tip, I
guess. They tried to stick us up, then
they were going down to the beach,
grab you fellows and take what hooch
they could get. But we wouldn’t be
stuck up. There was about a dozen of
us and we just jumped right out in
the middle of ’em and the whole gang
of us rolls down to the beach fighting
like mad.” He laughed at the memory
of the battle.

   “ Boy, this is a fighting business. If
you don't fight, you don’t last. Won-
der if Smith clipped any of those boys
when they beat it for the brush? He
was layin’ down on ’em pretty heavy.”

  We passed through several dark and
silent villages and headed toward St.
Bernard. The young truckman .was
peering anxiously into the gloom.

  “ Things look right to-night,” he
said. “ No signs of hi-jackers or dry
agents.”

  We rattled through St. Bernard and
turned north to Poydras. As we did
so a speeding sedan came from behind,
tore past us and came to a halt about
fifty yards down the road. Two men
leaped out and hurried toward us. I
raised my weapon.

  “ Keep your shirt on,” said the
602

DETECTIVE FICTION WEEKLY

driver. “ They may be a couple of the

boys.”

  Both men were heavily armed, but
they made no motion to draw the pis-
tols which were strapped on the outside
of their garments.

  “ What’s your number?” called one,
after they stopped at a discreet dis-
tance.

  “ Sixty-nine,” said the driver.

  “ What’s the word?”

  “ Red roses.”

  “ Get rollin' to town.”

  The men stood aside and we pro-
ceeded on our way.

  “ What was all that ?” I demanded.

  “ Dunno myself. Guess this mob
I’m workin’ for has got the business
on this road sewed up. They put out
numbers and passwords and if you
ain’t got ’em it’s just too bad for you.
If we hadn’t been right Chose two birds
would have started shootin’.

  “ You see, the guy that runs this out-
fit is no sucker. He ain't going to buy
protection for a lot of stiffs to muscle
in on his game. Sec?”

  I saw and marveled at what Graves
had accomplished in the short time that
I had been in Cuba. With the help of
Ilurd, no doubt, he had provided for
the safe landing and transportation of
our goods into the city.

  But there were other surprises in
store for me. When we arrived in
town we drove to a long, low building
which looked like a factory or a garage.
As we approached two wide doors
swung open and we drove into the place
which was lined with trucks of every
description. In one end of the room
cases of liquor were piled high and
there was a complete bottling, capping
and labeling outfit.

  When Graves arrived an hour later
he took great delight in showing me
around the new establishment.

  “ Safe as a church.” he explained.
“ I’ve got it all fixed. We can haul our
stuff here, and start it north. I’ve fig-
ured out that we can make about twen-

TO BE C

ty per cent more profit by buying alco-
hol in Cuba, shipping it here and mak-
ing it into synthetic whisky.

   “ That’s why I bought all the equip-
ment. And look at this—” He pointed
to a big tank with a huge faucet at
the bottom.

   “ This is the best rig yet. When you
get the stuff in the case, you tuck in
a lot of straw, then you shoot the whole
works under the faucet and give it a
dose of salt water. When the old cus-
tomer opens his case he gets a whiff
of that salt water and he says, ‘ The
real stuff right off the ocean,’ and
you’ve made a customer for life.”

  We sat for an hour making high
plans for the future. 1 told Graves
about Jensen and his scheme for buy-
ing an alcohol plant.

  “ Great idea,” he said. “ It would
give us a complete production and dis-
tributing outfit. But the first thing we
want to do is to buy a couple of real
ships. We’ll sell the Romolda and get
a line on something worth while. Then
we'll put Cagle in charge of the fleet
and we'll run the stuff and count the
money.

  “ Now there’s one thing that’s got
to be done right away. The business
is so big in Kansas City and St. Louis
that we’ve got to have more storage
room and more men on the job up
there. Suppose you look after it. All
right ?”

   “ I’m ready to go.”

  “ Want to go now ?”

   “ Sure.”

  “ Fine,” said Graves. “ You can
ride up with the boys when they take
the first of this stuff up. They’ll be
ready to start in an hour. Come on
over, I’ll introduce you to Henry, the
bos? driver.”

   Just as the first gray tinge of dawn
was touching the sky, the booze trucks
rolled out of the plant and headed
north. I sat' on the front seat beside
the square-jawed Henry, a repeating
shotgun across my knees.

          oner Who Wouldn’t Talk—Even to Her Lawyer

CHAPTER I
Murder at the Locust

ON the night of the murder the
night clerk at the Locust Apart-
ments saw the side door open
and three men come in. They were
supporting Mr. Skeets Brady. The
clerk said afterward, when Common-
wealth versus Jordan came up for
trial, that Brady appeared to be drunk.
No, he was not close enough to smell
liquor, but he knew a drunk when he
saw one. And Brady had spoken of
attending A1 Dooner’s birthday party,
which, from what the clerk had heard,
meant a party wringing wet.

  Yes, Brady had been a permanent
guest. He lived on the same floor as
Whitey Higgins. The men had taken
Brady upstairs, accompanied by a bell-
boy who had a pass key.

    Then the three went to Higgins's
  room; the bellboy had told him so, and
  he knew them as his friends. Higgins
  had arrived and gone up to his apart-
  ment about fifteen minutes earlier. In
  a minute or so he phoned down and
  asked for ginger ale. The same bell-
  boy took it up.

    Then, went on the night clerk, Floss
  Jordan rushed in and demanded ex-
  citedly: “Is Mr. Brady in?” The
  clerk stalled for time, but she de-
  manded the key. Her breath was
  heavy with the sweet redolence of
  flavored alcohol. Could he smell it?
  He eould! But he had not thought it
  unusual. Miss Jordan was Brady’s
  girl, she had also been at the party, and
  he gave her the key she was yelling for.
  Brady had said she could have it in his
  absence; why not, therefore, when he
  was at home?

  Two minutes later—the clerk said it
was exactly twenty minutes after two
—she came flying down the stairs and
through the lobby. He noticed that
her hat was askew and that she was
very pale. She went out, and he
thought he saw her getting into a cab.

  Was he sure about the cab? Not
exactly. Because at that moment the
poker game was telephoning for more
ginger ale. And at the same moment
some one else came flying up to him.
But this time it was the bellboy, whis-
pering wildly: “ Say, listen, Brady’s
shot an’ bleedin’ like a pig! An’ a gat
onna floor by the couch! I’m turnin’
the corner in the corridor toward his.
room an’ I hear shootin’. Brady’s
door’s open an’ 1 get that funny burned
smell. So I dash in an’ there he is
where we put him on the couch. Mouth
open. Shirt all red. Dead or I'm a
liar!” The clerk called the police.

  Captain Ryan and his assistant,
WTood, answered in person, because
this looked like the latest of a series of
gangster killings that had aroused the
newspapers almost to frenzy. All pre-
vious arrests had achieved only new
editorials. Wounded gangsters had
died with buttoned lips, and suspects
had managed to squirm out. But Ryan
arrested Floss within an hour, lodged
her in a citv hall detention cell, and
iiad her finger-printed the first thing in
the morning.

  The finger-prints were identical with
those on the revolver found by Brady’s
body. But she refused to say a word.
At Ryan, Wood, or Brown, the as-
sistant district attorney whose spe-
cialty was murder, she only shrugged.

  “ You know what’ll happen to you
if you don’t talk,” they said.

  “ I won’t talk,” she answered.

  “ Well,” said Rvan, “ how about
those waiters at A1 Dooner’s party that
heard you scrappin’ with the boy
friend ? How about them hearing you
say you were gonna kill him? How
about that, huh?”

  “ Well, what about it?” she retorted.

  “Why did you say it?”

  “ I was sore at him, that’s all.”

  “ Why did you follow him home
when you knew he was drunk?”

  “ Say, listen,” she said, putting her
knuckles on her hips. “ who had a
better right to follow him home?”

  “ Have you talked to Higgins
lately ?”

  “ I wouldn’t spit -on Higgins,” she
said sweetly.

  “ You used to be Higgins’s girl be-
fore you were Brady’s, weren't you?”
put in Brown.

  “ Well, can’t a girl make a mistake ?”
  “Didn’t Higgins give you the air?”
  “ I just took it.”

  “ So you took up with Brady?”

  “ Well—yes.”

  “ Higgins didn't mind, did he?”

  “ Nobody cared if he did.”

  “ Higgins ever try to get you back ?”
  She was silent, shrugging.

  After they left her Brown said to
Ryan: “There's a story around that she
and Higgins made it up and laid for
Brady. You’d better check up on
where Higgins was last night.”

  “ I did,” said Ryan, “ and it's all
O. K. That’s what makes me sure she
did it. Brady didn’t cheat himself on
dames no matter how he cheated on,
them. An’ that Jordan baby’s no lamb-
stevv and lilies. I’m givin' it out to the
papers she’s gonna get the works. I’m
goin’ back to Brady’s.”

  As he entered the- Locust’s lobby a
tall, gaunt, unshaved individual, whose
battered Stetson hung like a cloud over
his hawk’s beak, laid a hand on his
shoulder. It was Arthur Beele, crime
reporter for the Telegraph. That hat
and that beak had followed every mur-
der of consequence since the day that
Gyp the Blood. Dago Frank and Lefty
Louie had made themselves a part of
the history of crime.

  “ So you’ve made a pinch, eh,
Ryan?”

  There was that in Beele’s nasal
greeting which always made Ryan ap-
prehensive. He looked up at him.
THE SILENT WITNESS

605

“ Oh—hello, Arty. That's right. Got
the goods on her too.”

  “ Nice work,” said Beele. “ You're
getting better all the time, Ryan.”
Ryan did not answer. They walked
up the stairs to Brady’s aparament on
the second floor. The door was locked,
but one of Ryan’s men opened it. The
body lay on the couch awaiting removal
to the morgue. Everything else had
been left as it was the night before.

  “ When is Doc Smythe going to
make his autopsy?” asked Beele.

  “ Say, Arty, why are you always
tryin' for individual information?”
Ryan demanded. “ Can’t you wait
until the other boys get here from their
papers an’ then take it with them ? You
always act like—”

  “ Hell, Ryan,” said Beele sharply,
“ what’s individual about that ?”

  “ Oh, I don’t mind telling you it's
some time this afternoon. But don’t
ask so many questions.”

  But Beele was bending over the
body. Two bullet holes, close to-
gether, from which the blood had
bubbled slowly, marked the white sheen
of the stiff shirt. The eyes were open.
Beele examined the couch and the floor
around it.

  “You said last night there were three
bullets out of his rod, Ryan.”

  “ Say, how many times do you have
to be told?” demanded Ryan truc-
ulently.

  “ I was wrondering where the third
bullet hit him.” Beele examined the
body more closely. “ Here,” he said.
“ Look, Ryan. It grazed his shoulder
and buried itself in the frame of the
couch. How many shots did the bell-
boy hear?”

  “ For the love of Mike, Beele,
what’s eatin’ you? Can’t you wait for
the other guys to get here to find out
the kid heard three shots? What’s all
this monkey business anyway? You
always think you know it all. Three
bullets.

  “ Three shots. She killed him. An’
there you are. Put that in the paper

and cut out this Sherlock Holmes
stuff.”

  Beele shrugged. “ I like to get the
facts,” he said, and began to wander
about the room. Ryan scowled at him.

  There was a knock at the door.
Ryan’s man opened it to admit the
other reporters. Beele nodded to them
and continued his explorations. Yes,
Ryan began, it looked very much as if
the girl had done it. Her threats.
Brady’s other women. The waiteYs,
the night clerk, the bell hop. Three
shots; three bullets. Her finger-prints
011 the revolver. He preened himself
as he talked, and Beele’s long nose
drew down to sour mockery. Softly
he slid open the bureau drawer which
he had been fingering, fumbled about
inside, and took out something which
he slipped quickly into a handkerchief
in his pocket.

  “ See you later, Ryan,” he said.
“ There’s something I want to show
you.”

  Ryan ignored him. Beele pulled his
hat down hard and went out. With the
greatest possible haste he sought his
city editor.

        CHAPTER II
        Higgins's Alibi ' \

“T TARRINGTON.” he said, as
JHj. they retreated into a corner of
the local room, “ I think I’ve
got something.”

  Harrington looked at him, quizzi-
cally, wearily. A city editor’s life is a
dog’s life, a hound dog’s life. And he
and Beele had worked together, from
the beginning, for a long, long time.

  “ What do you think about the case,
Artv ?”

    j

  “Do you want a hunch?”

  “We can’t print hunches.”

  Beele fished a cigarette out of his
side pocket. “ I’ve never steered a
paper wrong yet, and you know that,
Harry. But you’re right just the
same. We can’t print hunches.” He
expelled a cloud of smoke through one
606

DETECTIVE FICTION WEEKLY

nostril. “ And yet I think she’s in-
nocent. And I think I’ll prove it.
I’ve never let you down, Harry. And
we haven’t scored a beat together since
-—since when?”

  Harrington sighed. “ There aren’t
any beats any more, Arty.”

  “ If we said the girl is innocent that
would be a beat, wouldn’t it? If we
turned out to be right we’d be sitting
on the world, wouldn’t we?”

  “ If,’’ said Harrington.

  “ Let’s do it,” Beele said.

  “ What’s up your sleeve ?”

  “ It’s in my pocket.”

  For a moment Harrington looked
at him. Then he said: “ We’ve been
out of jobs before. And I guess we
will again. But there’s a typewriter,
and the office is lousy with copy paper.
Write that story. Go ahead! Don’t
stare at me like a damn fool!”

  An hour later the first night extra
hit the street. The Telegraph de-
clared that Floss Jordan was a victim
of circumstances. But who had made
those circumstances—and why? Did
the police think they could wipe clean
a record of past futilities by the arrest
of an innocent girl when there were
others with definitely established
motives for wanting the dead man out
of the way? Floss Jordan was in-
nocent of Brady's murder. The police
being willing, the Telegraph would co-
ope'rate with them in an effort to fix
the blame where it belonged.

  There wras a picture of Floss, a pic-
ture which showed her a slip of a girl
with an uptilted chin and a big picnic
hat. It was the kind of picture that
editors love, readers adore, and district
attorneys fear. No newspaper reader,
seeing that picture, would ever believe
that a girl who looked like that could
ever kill a mouse, much less a man. It
looked exactly the picture of the poor
innocent young thing sacrificed for
somebody’s honor or pocketbook. And
Arty Beele, with diabolical circumlo-
cution, hinted so in eleven paragraphs.
After all, gangsters are no angels. And

she was a gangster’s girl. Two gang-
sters’ girl, in fact. And the make-up
man wrote under the picture: “ A Face
a Man Could Die For.” And the cir-
culation of the Telegraph multiplied
like mayflies in May.

  That night a slim young man whose
blond good looks would have distin-
guished him anywhere strolled into the
Detective Bureau and smiled genially
at the detectives in the outer room. He
knew them all. And he greeted them
like hail fellows. In his way Whitey
Higgins was an ingratiating person.

  “ The captain around. Woody ?”

  “ He want to see yon?”

   “ That’s what I want to find out.”
Wood shrugged. “ He’s in there,” in-
dicating Ryan’s private office. “ He’s
talkin’ to Arty Beele.”

  “Yeh?” Higgins too read the
Telegraph. He knocked at Ryan’s
door and walked in.

   “ Want to see me, captain ?”

  “ What about. Whitey?”

  Higgins smiled slyly and gave Beele
a look. " Why, Brady.”

  “Did you knock him off?”

   “ Hell,'no.”

  “Know who did?”

  Higgins shook his head. “ I just
came up here because the boys out-
side ”—he jerked his thumb toward
the outer room—“ they all know I was
after Brady. If somebody else hadn’t
’a’ done it I would’ve. But I didn’t.
See what I mean?”

   “ Just called to be sociable, is that it,
Higgins?” said Beele. “ Just come in
to put your alibi on file, eh ?” He gave
a tug at the battered Stetson. “ Where
were you a little after two last night,
Higgins?”

   “ Plavin’ poker.”

  “ Where?”

   “ In the apartment.”

  “Can you prove it?”

   Higgins again smiled slyly. “ I guess
the captain’s done that already.”

  “ Did you hear the shots, Whitey?”
“ How could I help it ? I’m on the
same floor, ain’t I?”
THE SILENT WITNESS

607

  “ Willing to testify to that?”

  “ Sure. Any time.”

  “Why were you after Brady?”

  “ You ought to know that without
askin’. He wras poachin’ in my terri-
tory. We , had an agreement, Brady
and I did. He was to keep out of
South Philly. I meet him in front of
the Sylvania last week. And I tell him,
‘ Brady, you’re workin’ the wrong side
of the street. Cut it out.’ He said sure
he’d cut it out. And the same night
one of his trucks delivers a load of
beer on Snyder Avenue. So that’s
why I’d ’a’ got him if somebodv else
hadn’t.”

  “ And if somebody else should hap-
pen to be the girl Brady took awav
from you that wouldn’t make any
difference either, would it?”

  Higgins lit a cigarette. “ I’m sorry
about the kid,” he said. “ It’s just
tough she had to get mixed tip with a
guy like Brady. But don’t get it
wrong. Brady never took her away
from me. You know how a guy gets
with a dame. Soon as she started
tryin’ to run me I smacked ’er down.
Told her I liked her, all right, but she’d
better hit the breeze and try a change
of scenery. So Brady took her over.
And if she killed him it serves him
right for trying to take over my ter-
ritory, too.”

  “You were at A1 Dooner’s party
last night, weren’t you?” said Beele.

  “ Sure. So were you, Arty. A lot of
the newspaper crowd was there. I
understand the captain here got an in-
vite too.”

  Ryan scowled. A1 Dooner was a ris-
ing racketeer. Beele went on : “ And
Brady was there and so was Floss.
Listen, Higgins. I saw how you kept
your eye on Floss. What did she and
Brady fight about?”

  “ He was neckin’ with some other
dame—that’s all I could see. So she
got sore. But that’s the kind of rat
Brady was. Never had enough—
money, liquor, women—”	,

  “ Brady got drunk, didn’t he ?”

  “ And howr!”

  “ Did he start home alone ?”

  “ I wasn’t that interested, Arty.
Somebody did say he started to go
home with that dame he’s been warmin’
up. But I couldn’t say. I was too
anxious to get back to the apartment
and play poker myself to worry about
that punk.”

  Beele regarded him closely. Then he
said: “ What are you going to do for
Floss?”

  “ What do vou mean—what can I
do?”

  “ Take care of her. See that she has
a lawyer. Don’t you know that she’s
held on suspicion of murder? Don’t
you know that yet, Higgins ?”

  Higgins looked undecided. Then he
took a sheaf of bills out of his pocket.
“ If a couple of grand’ll help, I’ll come
through.” He handed Beele two one-
thousand dollar notes. “ Here’s two
grand, Arty. Hell—here’s another five
hundred. Get the kid a mouthpiece.
Anything else?”

  Beele pocketed the money and shook
his head. Ryan said: “ Hit the breeze,
Higgins. ’F I want you I’ll send for
you.”r <	\

  “ K. O. with me,” Higgins replied,
and turned to go.

  “Just a minute,” said Beele. “ When
did you get .that apartment on the same
floor as Brady?”

  “ A month ago. Any more of my
business you’d like to know?”

  Beele considered. “ Yes, while I’m
at it and if you don’t mind, Whitey.
Let me see your rod.”

  “ Sure, anything to oblige.” Hig-
gins slipped a Colt automatic out of his
hip pocket and handed it to Beele. “ It's
a .32, if that’s what you’re after.”
Beele examined the gun, removed
the clip, then snapped it back and re-
turned it to Higgins. “ That’s what
I’m after all right. Brady’s was a .38
Smith & Wesson. Thanks, Whitey.”
“ And while yQu’re at it, Higgins,”
Ryan cut in, “ leave that gat here!
What t’hell you mean coming into niv
608

office with it? You certainly got your
nerve. An’ I got a mind to pinch
you for carrying concealed and deadly
weapons.”

  “ Really want it, cap ? You can have
it because I’m packing a .38 after this.”
“ Leave it an’ get out,” Ryan
growled.

  Higgins left. When the door had
closed behind him Beele said: “ I’d
keep my eye on that guy if I were you,
Ryan.”

  Ryan bridled. “ Never mind tellin’
me what to do. And never mind ask-
ing me about it, either. Cornin’ around
here suckin’ up information an’ goin’
back an’ puttin’ me on the pan!-” He
picked up a copy of the Telegraph.
“ Where the hell do you get this stuff,
anyway? I’ve checked up on Higgins,
and he’s not mixed up in it. He an’
Floss had a fight, and I know damned
well she’s off him for life!”

  “ There’s a mixture some place,”
Beele replied calmly. “ I don’t like its
smell. And the better that blond
beauty frames his alibi the less I like
it. Now I'm asking you, Ryan. Do
you want me to work with you, or
around you?”

  “ I want you to get out of here and
stay out.”

  “ All right, if you feel that way
about it. How about talking to Floss?”
“ Nothin’ doin’. Nobody ’11 talk to
her for that matter.”

 “No? Why not?”

  “ Because I say so.”

  Beele pulled down his hat. “ I’ll talk
to her, all right, and no thanks to you.
When will you learn, Ryan, that it
takes more than a flat foot like you to
keep me from a story? Never,” said
Beele, answering his own question, “ cr
you wouldn’t be the kind of flatty you
are.”

  Ryan felt a familiar twinge of ap-
prehension. He knew Beele of old, as
did the local rooms of a dozen cities
from New York to Chicago. “ Listen,
Arty,” he began in a conciliatory tone.
But Beele had opened the door and

Ryan turned in time to meet it closing
quietly in his face.,

CHAPTER III
Pop Dinsmore’s Case

ON Arch Street, facing the north-
ern wing of City Hall, stands a
row of once sturdy but now de-
crepit five-story buildings, whose ten-
ants, in view of many postponements
view with equanimity its perenially an-
nounced destruction. Henry Kendall
Dinsmore, Esq., attorney and counsel-
lor-at-law, whose offices occupied the
second floor front of 1415, intended to
retire when the building was razed., and
he said so as Beele dropped his gaunt
frame into Dinsmore’s favorite arm-
chair.

  “ Arty, I know a place in Maine
where—”

  “ You’re too rheumatic to fish any
more, pop, and you’re too old to retire.
Come across with a drink and I’ll give
you a retainer.” He displayed one of
the thousand-dollar bills he had got
from Higgins. “ Like the looks of it?
I know where there’s another just like
it.”

  The old lawyer, his little blue eyes
popping, his tongue incapable of
speech, slid open a desk drawer and
produced a bottle and glasses.

  “ Rye?” said Beele.

  Dinsmore, Esq., nodded. Then the
drink made him articulate.

  “ It’s from Judge Gray’s stock. How
d’you get a thousand, Arty? Hon-
estly?”

  Beele threw the bill across the desk.
“ It’s good rye, counsellor. Tell the
judge I said so. Yeah, I got it hon-
estly. What made you ask me? Do
I look like a lawyer ?”

  Dinsmore stuffed the retainer into
his vest pocket, and adjusted the wing
collar which encircled his heavily
fleshed neck. Dinsmore’s corpulence,
his little marblelike blue eyes, belied
him. More than one jury had discov-
ered to their surprise, and several of

2 D
THE SILENT WITNESS	609

the younger prosecuting attorneys to
their sorrow, his rapacious brilliance.
Since Beele’s visits more often con-
cerned negotiations for a five-dollar
loan than the casual tossing over the
desk of thousand-dollar fees, those eyes
now glittered zestfully.

  “ What’s the trouble, Arty?”

  “No trouble, pop. Just murder.”

  “ Perpetrated or merely intended?”
  “ Maybe both. 1 don't know yet.”

  “ By whom?”

  “ The police say Floss Jordan. Know
who she is? It doesn’t matter. But
the bad smell that assails my beezer
comes from a long-lashed blond boy
not unknown to the police. His name
is Higgins. And the dead man is—”
“ Brady, of course. I'm part of your
public, Arty.”

  “ Anyway, your client is dark and
petite and she’s got eyes that can swim
in tears better than any you’ve ever
seen. You won’t have to tell her how
to act in court. And she’s even bet-
ter looking than her picture. And with
all that, pop, she’s a good kid—and
too damned good for the guys that
have had her. You’ll enjoy defending
her.”

  “ Why are you interested?”

  “ It doesn’t matter much, does it?”
said Beele, shrugging. “ But I’ve got a
luinch there’s a story in it for me.”
Dinsmore reached for his pipe.
“ How good’s her case?”

  “ You’ll have to decide that yourself
after I’ve told you about it. That’s
why I’m paying you.”

   Beele related the details of the previ-
ous night. Then Dinsmore said: “ Who
did you say is paying me?”

  “ Higgins,” said Beele quietly.
“ Let’s go over and talk to Floss.”

  She wras sitting in her cell, giving
herself a careless manicure when Ryan
took them up.

  “ Hello, Mr. Beele. Come to bail
me out?”

   “ Just to introduce you to your attor-
ney, kid. The jam you’re in isn't bail-
able. Is it, Rvan?”

   D

   “ I’ll say it isn’t. Come along, Arty,
if Mr. Dinsmore wants to talk to her."

  Dinsmore, rising from his bow over
Floss’s hand, said: “ Mr. Beele is as-
sisting me in this case, Captain Ryan.
If you don't mind—he will continue to
do so. Thank you, captain.”

  Ryan turned, grumbling, to go.

  “ Thank you, captain,” said Beele.
“ 1 won’t eat your prisoner, charming
as she is.” He waved Ryan to the
door. “ Read all about it in the paper,
Ryan.” Then he turned back to Floss
and Dinsmore. She was busy with
her orange stick.

  “ Floss,” said Beele, “ if anybody at
all can get you out of this, Pop Dins-
more’s the one. Tell us just what hap-
pened. Did you plug him, kid ?”

  “ I don’t want to talk about it, Mr.
Beele. I’m telling you now, I don’t
care what happens to me, so don’t pull
any soft stuff. He was just like the
rest of them, once they get a girl where
they want her. The devil with the
whole works. If they want to burn
me, let ’em. I’m ready.”

  “ But, my dear girl—” Dinsmore
started to say.

  “ You heard me,” Floss interrupted.
“ I mean it.” She flung down the
orange stick. “ It’s swell of you and
all that, Mr. Beele, getting Mr. Dins-
more for me. I appreciate it all right.
Don’t think I don’t. But—”

  “ Don’t thank me, kid,” Beele said.
“ Thank Higgins. He’s paying for it!”
Dinsmore noted approvingly how the
tears rushed to her eyes. But Beele
was pleased to see that they were tears
ofTage. She half rose. “ I don’t want
him to pay for—for anything—for
me.” She was trembling. “Now or
any other time. After what he did to
me. Why—”

  “ In that case,” said Dinsmore
suavely, “ it would please me to repre-
sent you without fee, Miss Jordan—if
you \irill do me the honor.”

  She choked back a sob and did not
answer. Beele gave her a cigarette and
lit it for her.
610

DETECTIVE FICTION WEEKLY

  “ You’ve known me for some time,
haven't you, Floss? Since you came
to town and got a job as coat-room
girl at the old Cyrano. That’s two
years now. And you know that a lot
of people think I’m a pretty square
guy. Can you believe I’m playing
square with you when I ask you if you
weren’t pretty sweet on Higgins once ?”
“ Everybody knows that,” she re-
plied. “ But I wised up.”

  “ And Brady? You sort of liked
him, too, didn’t you?”

  She exhaled a ring of smoke. It
floated slowly upward, dissolving into
nothing.

  “ I liked Brady—at first. I wouldn’t
have gone to him if I hadn’t. But
these racket guys are all the same. Just
because they can flash a roll they think
they can have any girl or as many of
them as they want. But that stuff
doesn’t go with me.”

  “ Like last night at the party?”

  “ Sure,” she said.

  “ Floss, haven’t you ever thought of
laying off these racket guys and tying
up with some regular fellow that could
give you a home and a radio and a pay
envelope on Saturday night? You
know what I mean—be regular your-
self and have a couple of kids—”

   She flicked the ash off her cigarette.
“ Forget it,” she said. “ I had my
chance and I muffed it. It was just be-
fore I busted up with Higgins. The
kid was crazy about me, and I’d known
him back home—before I came to
Philly. Kid stuff, you know. We used
to go out in his brother’s flivver and
neck in the moonlight. Then I run
smack into him on Chestnut Street and
he buys me a soda and wants to marry
me. Got a good job and the rest of it.
But would he handle me now? Not
for a dime a dozen!” Her tears, this
time, were not of anger.

  “ What’s his name ?” asked Dins-
more.	%

  “Who cares?” And she was silent
again.

  “ How the hell, Arty, am I going to

defend her,” Dinsmore said as they left
City Hall, “ when she won’t even talk 1
to me ? How are you going to help her
when she won’t even talk to you ? And
her finger-prints on the gat that killed
Brady as plain as an engraving!”

  “ She’ll talk,” said Beele. “ After
she’s been in jail for a week and when
I’ve produced the kid sweetheart. She
comes from Phoenixville, and that’s
where I’ll find him. But tell me, pop,
how does it look to you ?”

  “ It looks to me,” replied Dinsmore,

“ that as long as she won’t talk, we
won’t talk. Maybe it’s the best thing
after all. We’ll make ’em believe she
came in, grabbed the gun, got scared,
and ran out. We won’t offer an}- de-
fense. Let ’em prove she did it. No-
body saw her shoot him. Just as you
say, others—Higgins, for instance, or
one of the lads that was with him,
might have done it. We’ll make the
jury believe that—if we can. If we
can, Arty. We’ll offer no defense at
all and let them get a good long look
at her good looks.”

  “ Ilm-m!” They walked on toward
Dinsmore’s office. Beele whistled a
lugubrious melody which, if it sounded
like anything at all, was reminiscent of
Chopin’s “ Funeral March.” Then, as
they paused before 1415, he said:

“ Pop, you think she did it, don’t you?”

  “ Don’t you?” Dinsmore was mildly
surprised. “ Admitting that Higgins’s
mixed up in it somewhere, do you real-
ly think she’s innocent?”

  “I do,” said Beele. “Let’s get
straight in this. If I—we—get her off
I’m entitled to all the story there is,
all the story possible. I’m a reporter,
and I don’t rescue maidens in distress
unless there’s something in it for me—
and that means my paper. I’ll let you
in on all I know already. I’ll tell you
everything else as I find it out. But
when she goes to trial—well, it’s my
party and short of getting her con-
victed you’ll do as I say and get the
glory. O.K.?”

  “ Certainly. Arty. I’ll get the glory

and go fishing. Come on up and spill
it, and we’ll try some Chartreuse 1 got
from Judge Lacey.'’

CHAPTER IV

Witnesses for the Defense

‘AND so, ladies and gentlemen of
\ the jury,” said Brown when
Commonwealth versus Jordan
came up a month later, “ the State will
show that the defendant had a motive
for killing Brady and that she did, in
fact, kill him.” He lowered his voice
to conversational tones, a favorite de-
vice. “ The Commonwealth of Penn-
sylvania is not vindictive, it does not
seek vengeance. As its instrument I
am not vindictive nor vengeful. And,
ladies and gentlemen of the jury,
neither, I know, are you. But the laws
by which you and I and the defendant
are governed say that Floss Jordan
cannot, on the peril of her own life,
take the life of another. If she had a
grievance^against the deceased, real or
fancied, these very laws, this very
court, would have provided a remedy.
But, as I shall show, she disregarded
these laws: she killed. I want yoit to
give the defendant, when the time
comes for you to decide her guilt or
innocence, the benefit of every doubt.
But I ask you now if the evidence you
shall hear points unequivocally and un-
deniably to her guilt, to act as men
and women who wish to see the law
upheld. I shall ask you, ladies and
gentlemen of the jury, when the time
comes for me to do so, for a verdict
of murder in the first degree.”

  Brown bowed, sat down, and called
his first witness. It was Dr. Smythe,
the coroner’s physician, who took the
oath like a temperature.

  “ Dr. Smythe, you are the coroner’s
physician, are you not?”

  “ I am.”

  “ Did you examine the body of the
deceased?”

  “ I did, sir. The deceased died of
two bullet wounds through the heart.”

 “ Did vou extract the bullets?”

 “ I did.”

 Brown held up three leaden pellets.
 “ Do these look like the bullets you
 extracted ?”

 Smythe examined them. “ They look
 like thirty-eight caliber bullets. I ex-
 tracted two of them. There was a
 third wound, a surface wound over the
 shoulder. I did not find the bullet
 which caused it.”

 “ Thank you, doctor,” said Brown,
 resuming his seat and indicating by a
 wave of his arm that Dinsmore could
 cross-examine.

 “ No questions,” said Dinsmore.

 The Commonwealth's next witness
 was the head waiter at the Club Cy-
 rano, where A1 Dooner had given his
 party.

 “ Do you know the defendant ?”
 Brown asked.

 “ Fairly well.”

 “ Did you hear what she said to
 Mr. Brady on the night of the 23rd of
 September?”

 “ I did.”

 “ What did she say ?”

 The head waiter paused for a second.
 “She said: ‘Listen, you two-timing
 skunk, I don’t give a damn if you take
 on every tramp in town when I’m not
 around, but I won’t go for it here. Get
 me?’ ”

 “ Were those her exact words ?”

 “ Pretty nearly.”

 “ And what did Brady say?”

 “ He didn’t say anything at first.
 Then Floss—I. mean the defendant-
 said something I couldn't hear, she said
 it so low. And Brady turned around—•
 not all around, because some one was
 sitting in his lap—and told her to go
 back to Higgins.”

 “ Do you recall his exact words ?”

 “ As closely as I remember he said:
 * Go peddle yourself to Whitey, deary.
 You’re no bargain.’ ”

 “ Then what happened?”

 “ She started to cry. I don’t remem-
 ber just what she said. But she did
 say she wouldn't take that from any-
612

DETECTIVE FICTION WEEKLY

 body. She said Whitey was a wet
 smack, but if he were half the man
 Whitey was he'd still be a louse. And
 then she cried again. And she said
 again she couldn't go for that stuff.”

  “ What did Brady say then?”

   “ He said: ‘ Go to hell, deary.’ ”

  “ Do you remember what happened
next?”

  “ I interfered. I asked her to sit
down somewhere.”

  “ Did she do so?”

  “ No.”

  “ What did she do?”

  “She said: ‘You. may think I’m
drunk, Charley. But I know what I’m
saying, and I’ll do it, too. I’m going
to kill that skunk if it’s the last thing
I ever do.’ And she snatched up a bot-
tle of ginger-ale and started to bring
it down on Brady’s head. I took it
away from her and then A1 Dooner
came up and made her dance with
him.”

  “ Were there any of the other wait-
ers near you when she threatened to
kill Brady?”

  “ There were Frank Tetti and Oscar
Gantz.”

  “Your witness,” said Brown, turn>
ing to Dinsmore.

  Dinsmore pushed down his collar.
“Do you mind if I call you Char-
ley?”

  The witness smiled. “ You’ve al-
ways called me that, Mr. Dinsmore.”
“ Well, Charley, how long have you
been a waiter?”

  “ Seventeen years.”

  “ And a head waiter?”

  “ The last six years—ever since I
left the Bellevue.”

  “ Now% Charley, in your business,
you have found it necessary, from time
to time, to deal with people under the
influence of liquor, have you not?”

  “ Many times, Mr. Dinsmore.”

  “ I thought so. So that in plain par-
lance, you know a drunk when you see
one.”

  Brown interposed an objection. “ I
fail to see, your honor, how Mr. Dins-

more's attempt to qualify the witness as
an expert on alcoholization is within
the scope of my original examination.”
“ The witness,” said Dinsmore,
“ has testified that the defendant inti-
mated that he thought her drunk. I
am about to ask him if she appeared to
be.”

  “ Objection over-ruled,” said the
court.

  Dinsmore continued: “ Charley, was
Brady drunk ?”

  “ Oh, yes.”

  “ Was the defendant drunk?"

  “ Verv drunk.”

   “ That’s all, Charley.”

  Brown then called Tetti. one of the
other waiters. But before he could be
sworn Dinsmore was on his feet.
“ Your honor, if it is the purpose of the
district attorney to prove by the next
witness and other witnesses that the de-
fendant threatened Brady’s life. I sug-
gest, in order to spare the patience of
the Court and jury, that the defense ad-
mit that the defendant threatened
Brady. If.it please the Court, the de-
fense admits that Floss Jordan threat-
ened to kill Brady, and more than that,
had an actual jealous motive for kill-
ing him.”

  “ I’m satisfied,” said Brown, and
called the hotel clerk.

  The clerk’s testimony passed un-
challenged. More than that. Dinsmore
nodded approvingly and said to the re-
porters’ table: “ Good witness. Has
anybody seen Arty to-day?”

  Nobody had. Nor had he been in
court. They were curious, but they
had more immediate concerns.

  Brown was putting the bellboy 011
the stand. He said his name was Henry
Collins, that he had worked at the
Locust for seven months and had been
on duty on the night of the twenty-
third of September.

  Brown asked him: “ Did you have
occasion to enter Mr. Brady’s room
about twenty minutes after 2 a. m. ?”

   “ Yessir.”

  “ Tell the court and jury in your
THE SILENT WITNESS

618

own way the circumstances which led
you to enter his room and what you
discovered when you entered it.”

  It was evident, with his first words,
that Collins had rehearsed his nar-
rative. He told it tersely.

  “ I took some ginger ale up to Mr.
Higgins’s room. Then I’m coming
back and turning the corridor corner
when I heard three shots. I noticed
that the door to Brady’s room was
open, and when I went in there he was
on the couch with blood all over him.”
“ Dead?” prompted Brown.

  “ He looked dead to me.”

  “ Collins,” said Brown, “ was there
a revolver on the floor by the couch?”
“ Yessir.”

  Brown held up a .38 caliber Smith
and Wesson revolver.

  “ Is this the one?”

   “ It looks like it.”

  “ That’s all,” said Brown, turning
to Dinsmore.

  “ Collins,” said Dinsmore, “ when
you took the ginger ale up to Higgins’s
room what was Higgins doing?”

  “ Objected to as irrelevant,” snapped
Brown.

  Dinsmore looked grieved. “ I do
not wish to question the credibility of
this witness. I pay him no compliment
when I say that his honest face im-
presses me. However, the district at-
torney’s objection compels me to ques-
tion it. If he can tell me what Mr.
Higgins was doing when he entered his
room, he can convince me that he really
entered it. Or may I ask the district
attorney whether he intends to call Mr.
Higgins to corroborate the witness?”
Brown growled inaudibly and the
court said: “ I think the witness may
answer the question.”

  “Well, Collins?” said Dinsmore,
“ what was Higgins doing?” Dinsmore
held up one finger like a rotund school-
master.

  “ He was playing cards,” Collins re-
plied.

  Dinsmore’s finger dropped. He
smiled approvingly, his blue eyes very

bright, and turned to the bench. “ I
110 longer question the credibility of
this witness. 1 make this remark, your
honor, for the record, and for his ben-
efit : Collins, you delivered the ginger
ale to the poker game. You took your
tip and departed. And then, you say,
three shots ran out upon the still night
air. Is that right?”

  “ Yessir.”

  “Now tell us, Collins, did the shots
follow each other quickly? Like this?”
He gave three staccato raps with his
pencil.

  “ No, sir. There was one shot. I
stopped when I heard that, and then,
right before I turned the corner of the
corridor that Brady’s room was on,
there were two more shots. That’s
when 1 smelled the powder. I thought
at the first shot that it was the backfire
of some engine.”

  “ You’re pretty sure about the shots,
are you?”

  “ I’m pretty sure.”

  “ And was a revolver like the one
Mr. Brown showed you on the floor?”
“Yessir.”

  “ And Mr. Brady looked rather
dead, eh?”

  “ He certainly did.”

  “ That’s all, Collins. Thank you.”
Dinsmore looked pleased.

  “ Captain John Ryan,” Brown called
out.

  Ryan walked to the stand with a dig-
nified tread, took the oath and hung •
his cap on his knee as he prepared to
testify.

  “ Captain Ryan—” Brown began,
but stopped as Beele walked down the
center aisle, pausing for two seconds to
whisper to Dinsmore, and then sat
down beside Floss Jordan. There was
a murmur at the press table, and Judge
Brazleton looked inquiringly at Dins-
more. Dinsmore rose. “If the court
please, Mr. Beele is assisting me in this
case,” and sat down. Judge Brazleton
nodded. Beele, with his elbows on the
table, looked at Ryan steadily, without
a smile.
614

DETECTIVE FICTION WEEKLY

   “ Captain Ryan, give us the circum-
stances which led you to arrest the de-
fendant,” said Brown.

  Ryan related how the clerk had
called headquarters, and how he and
Wood had hurried to the Locust and
made their first investigation. “ Then
I went to the defendant’s apartment
and arrested her.”

   “ Did she protest her innocence?"

   “ She didn't say much.”

   “ Didn’t she say anything at all?”
“Nothing important. Just cracked
wise at first and then got sullen and
shut up.”

  “You say she ‘cracked wise.’ What
do you mean by that?”

  “ Why, she said she wasn’t sore at
me,” Ryan attempted a lighter pose.
“ She said I was all right even if—I—
did look dumb. Ryan felt impelled to
chuckle.

  “ You say,” Brown continued,
“ that you arrested her. Did you have
prints made of her fingers and the re-
volver you found in Brady’s room?"

   “ Certainly.”

 “ That’s all.”	/ _ .

  Beele moved closer to Dinsmore.
Dinsmore took a handkerchief out of
his inner pocket and fluffed himself
with it. But he kept his seat as he pro-
ceeded to question Ryan.

  “ Captain Ryan, how long have you
been in the police department?”

   “ Twenty-seven years this January,”
‘said Ryan.

   “That’s a long time, isn’t it?”

   “ I guess it is.”

  “ Now then, captain. You say that
my client jocosely declared that you
looked dumb. You are not so, in fact,
are you, or you would not hold the
office you now occupy. Isn’t that
true?”

   “ I know my business,” he said.
“Then why,” asked Dinsmore in a
puzzled voice, “did you arrest the
defendant?”

   “ Because I figured she did it.”

  “ Of course, captain, you thought
she did it.”

  Ryan nodded.

  “Were you so thoroughly con-
vinced, captain, that this girl had com-
mitted murder that you questioned no
other occupants of the hotel and made
no inquiries as to their possible con-
nection with this crime?”

  “ I did check up on various people.”
  “ Miss Shaw, for instance?”

  “ 1 don’t know Miss Shaw.”

  “Then I’ll inform you. Miss Shaw
is an elderly lady who lived on the floor
above Brady’s apartment—directly
across the court and opposite to Mr.
Higgins’s apartment. Hadn’t you
thought it possible that she was the
murderer?”

  “ I didn’t figure elderly ladies for
shootin’ racket guys,” said Ryan.

  “ And yet,” said Dinsmore piously,
“ there are more things in heaven and
earth than are mentioned in the police
regulations. Did you question Mr.
Higgins?”

  “ [ had his movements checked up.”

  “ Did he account for his movements
at the time that Brady met his death?”
“ He was playing poker,” said Ryan.
“ Now then, you arrested the de-
fendant. Ymi had her finger-prints
compared with those on Brady’s gun.
And as a result of that comparison you
were convinced that she was the kifler.
Is that right?”

  “Yes, that’s right.”

  “ You were so certain, in fact, that
you refused the cooperation of some
one not connected with your depart-
ment, some one who in the past had
been of assistance to you?”

  “ The Detective Bureau,” said Ryan,
“can take care of its own business.”

  “ Of colirse," agreed Dinsmore.
“ And you are still convinced that no
more searching investigation was nec-
essary, that no possible ally, no possible
detail, was overlooked. Am I right?”
“You are,” said Ryan.

  “ And I thank you,” said Dinsmore.
“ That’s all, captain.”

  Brown, frowning, called Major Duf-
field, the finger-print expert. He ques-
THE SILENT WITNESS

G15

tioned him as briefly as was possible to
establish the fact that the finger-prints
on Brady's revolver were Floss Jor-
dan’s. Dinsmore’s cross-examination
was equally brief.

  “You have written a book on your
subject, haven’t you, major?”

  “ I have,” replied Duffield. “ I col-
laborated with Mr. Bovd Fredericks.”

  “ And is Mr. Fredericks a recognized
authority ?”

  “ He is not only a recognized au-
thority,” answered Duffield. “ He is
the authority.”

  Dinsmore thanked him and sat down.
Brown got up, bowed to the court, in-
clined his head to the jury and said:
“ The Commonwealth rests.” Then
Beele patted Floss on the shoulder,
winked at Dinsmore, and went out.

  There was a moment of silence.
Dinsmore adjusted his collar and
walked slowly to the rail of the jury
box.

  “ Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,
on the basis of the testimony you have
heard to-day, given by impartial, un-
biased witnesses, Floss Jordan is
guilty of murder. It is evidence
which calls upon Floss Jordan to stand
before you and tell you under oath
what she did in Brady’s room and why
the wreapon which killed Brady bears
the marks of her hand. My friends,
1 can put her on the witness stand. I
would do so—if I were sure she would
talk. If I were sure that she would
tell us just what happened during
those minutes which elapsed between
the minute when she hurried into the
lobby of the Locust, and the minute
when she raced out of it again, we
would have a basis to work on. We
would have the facts that would vin-
dicate my own belief in her innocence.
I regret that my able opponent, the dis-
trict attorney, does not have even a
stronger case against my client, strong
as it is. But if it were so convincing
that, instead of the pity I see in your
eyes as they rest upon this little girl,
your gaze was such as would make her

shrink in terror, then, perhaps aban-
doning hope, she would tell her story,
and we would have the real truth.

  ‘‘ Ladies and gentlemen, I repeat—
and 1 have practiced in these courts for
more years than I care to remember—
I know no more of Floss Jordan's ac-
tions in the room where Brady was so
foully slain than you do. But why
doesn't she speak ? There are theories,
my friends. Floss was a gangster’s
girl. Perhaps, in keeping with gang-
ster code, her mouth is sealed even with
her life to pay for silence. Perhaps
there is some one she wishes to pro-
tect. Perhaps, afraid of the ordeal of
cross-examination, she relies blindly on
the mightiness of truth which must
prevail. But I can only surmise.

  “ But this I know, because I have
not lived so many of my years in these
courts without learning a little about
my fellow, man : I know that Floss Jor-
dan is innocent of this crime. Mr. Beele
of the Telegraph knows, from that
fountain of instinct with which God
sometimes blesses newspapermen, that
Floss Jordan is innocent. Hence he is
assisting this defense. Fortified with
faith in that innocence we shall fight
the good fight in her behalf. I ask
you, ladies and gentlemen of the jury,
when her fate is put into your hands,
to consider everything brought out by
our evidence which may be in her
favor. I shall ask her once more to
speak. If she still refuses, remember
there are some things which, to all of
us, are better, more sacred, than life
itself.”

  Dinsmore sat down, looked at a
memorandum, and called his first wit-
ness : “ Ralph Higgins.”

CHAPTER V

‘‘I Shot Him”

THE reporters’ table in front, and
the gangsters at the back, sat up,
pop-eyed. This was better than
they had feared. The whisper flew
about the room: “ Floss’s first sugar.”

DETECTIVE FICTION WEEKLY

 Higgins, very debonair in English
 homespun and a rosebud in his coat,
 took the stand.

 “You live at the Locust Apartments,
 don't you, Mr. Higgins?”

  n v* „ *y

     \ es.

 “ On the same floor as the apart-
 ment occupied by the deceased?”

 “ Right.”

 “ Isn't your room just on the other
 side of the corridor from Brady’s?”

 “ Yes.”

 “Were you home about 2.15 a. m.
 on the twenty-fourth of September?"

 “ I was.”

 “ And did you hear any shots about
 that time?”

 “Three.”

 “Do you recall how they were
 spaced? Were they fired in rapid suc-
 cession. or like this?” Dinsmore tapped
 once with his pencil, paused, and tapped
 twice in succession.

 “ I don’t recall,” Higgins answered.
 “ Do you know the defendant, Miss
 Jordan?”

 “ About three years.”

 “ Do you know about her association
 with Brady?”

 “ Well—yes.”

 “ Were their relationships pleasant,
 so far as you know?”

 “ So far as I know.”

 “ And you knew her rather well at
 one time, didn’t you?”

 “ Pretty well.”

 “Was she familiar with the use of
 firearms ?”

 “ Not that I know of.”

 “ Did you ever see her handle a
 gun?"

 “Not that I remember; I didn’t,”
 answered Higgins.

 “Were you friendly with Brady?”

 “ Not very.”

 “ Would you mind telling me why?”
 “ Oh, he just didn’t click with me,
 that’s all!” Higgins relaxed a little
 from his elegance.

 Dinsmore said slowly: “ But in spite
 of your unfriendliness with Brady, in
 spite of his—association with the de-

 fendant, nevertheless you were willing
 to assist in her defense. Isn’t that so?”
 “ Yes.”

 “ In fact, you were willing to
 finance it. You are financing it. Isn’t
 that so?”

  Higgins looked embarrassed. “ Well

 —yes-”

  “Why?” said Dinsmore gently.
  Higgins fingered his hat. “ Well,
  she’s not a bad kid. I think she rates
  a break.”

  “ I see. You. think she's innocent?”
  “ Do you think I’d pay out that
  good money any other way?” Higgins
  demanded irritably.

  “ Did the police question you in con-
  nection with this case?”

  “They certainly did!”

  “ That's all. Cross-examine.”

 Brown began: “ Higgins, you say
 you’ve been a friend of the defendant
 for three years. Tell me, did you ever
 live with her?”

  “ I don’t see what that’s got to do
  with it,” Higgins protested.

  “ Answer yes or no,” put in Judge
  Brazleton.

  Higgins shrugged. “ No.” he said.
  “ But wasn’t she your woman?”
  Again Higgins shrugged. “ We ran
  around together.”

 Brown grinned significantly and
 nodded. “ Was she Brady’s—girl,
 too?”

  “ I don’t know.”

  “You don’t, eh?”

  “ No, I don’t.”

  “ All right, then. That’s all,” said
  Brown, and again nodded significantly.

  The reporters nodded significantly to
  each other also. One remarked,
  “ Pretty punk for her. And four
  women on the jury.” But Dinsmore.
  quite unperturbed, motioned to a
  middle-aged man who had entered the
  court room while Higgins was testify-
  ing, and signaled him to the stand.
  “What is your name, sir?"

  “ Boyd Fredericks,” said the witness.
  “ Are you the same Boyd Fredericks
  who is the co-author, with Major Duf-
THE SILENT WITNESS

617

  field, of a treatise on identification by
  means of finger-prints?”

   “ I am.’.1

  “ How many years have you devoted
to your subject?”

  “ Twenty or more.”

  “Now then, Mr. Fredericks,” said
Dinsmore, taking two pieces of card-
board from his briefcase, “ I show you
two photographs of certain finger-
prints. Have you compared one with
the other?”

   “ T have, sir.”

   “ Are thev or are they not identical?”
   “ They are.”

  Dinsmore handed him the pho-
tographs.

  “ Will you tell me where you saw
these before, and how you came to ex-
amine them?”

   Fredericks held up the prints. “ This
one I secured from the Bureau of
Identification or ‘ Rogues’ Gallery ’ of
the Police Department. The other I
made myself from prints on a Maxim
silencer given me by Mr. Beele.”
Dinsmore held up a metal object. “Is
this the silencer?”

  Fredericks looked at it. “ It has
’my mark of identification on it. It is.”
There was a scramble in the court
room. Dinsmore wheeled and yelled,
“ Stop that man! Stop him!” Higgins
had darted down the center aisle,
bowling over the rheumatic tipstaff
who tried to block him. But as he
reached the swinging doors one of
them hit him full in the face, and
Beele, coming in through the other,
bent his arm back in a hammer-lock,
pinned him face against the wall, and,
reaching over Higgins’s shoulder,
pulled a revolver out of his arm-
holster. Ryan elbowed his way down
the crowded aisle, and Beele. smiling
sardonically, said: “ Ryan, he’s got a
.38 this time! As an officer of the law
you’ve got to arrest him for carrying
concealed and deadly weapons.”

  Uniformed officers and plainclothes
men, together with the tipstaves,, were
quieting the court room. Ryan took

Higgins away. Dinsmore fluffed him-
self with his handkerchief, while the
court pounded for silence, which was
immediately broken by another stir at
the door. The court frowned judi-
cially up the aisle. Dinsmore turned his
head expectantly. Then he grinned, and
the reporters’ stable stood up as a body.

  It was Arty Beele again. Sauntering
down the aisle, baggy-legged, rough-
jowled, weary-eyed, yet smiling faintly,
he came, his hands in his pockets, his
hat crushed under his arm. And be-
hind him stumbled a nice, straight-
nosed, brown-eyed young man, the
kind that every girl hopes to be able to
invite to Sunday dinner.

  “Well,” Beele was beginning half-
audibly, “ here we are. See me nab
that Higgins baby, Dinsmore?”

  But Floss was on her feet, crying out
brokenly: “ Don! Oh, Don!”

  “I'm here. Floss!” The young man
shouldered Arty aside. “ It’ll be all
right now!”

  “ Oh, Don—0I1—” She choked, and
then he was clinging to her hands, and
they were sobbing and laughing to-
gether. The women in the front rows
whispered to each other and smothered
applause sounded-at the back. The re-
porters’ table sat down and scribbled
madly.

  “ For the last time there will be
order in the court!” thundered Judge
Brazleton.

  “Your honor,” interposed Dins-
more suavely, “ may I ask for a recess
of five minutes?”

  “ Is this young man also assisting
you in this case?” rasped the court.
“ Your assistants seem to partake of
the quality of a circus.”

  “ Not precisely. But he is assisting
the defendant.”

  “ No recess,” declared the court.
Arty Beele sat down in the chair
which somehow had remained invio-
late to him, took out a cigarette, put it
away, and leaned back to take in the
proceedings. Dinsmore removed the
young man’s arm from Floss’s shoul-
618

DETECTIVE FICTION WEEKLY

der and replaced it with his own. He
whispered to her. She nodded her
head. The reporters’ table heard him
say, “ Everything, Floss?” And they
heard her answer, “ Everything, Air.
Dinsmore — so help me.” Dinsmore
led her to the witness chair.

  She was nervous, but it seemed the
nervousness of courage. She seemed
supported by the fact that not ten feet
away was the young man that adored
her, and by the knowledge that she
looked as well as it was possible for
her to look. The effect produced by
her smartly plain hat, her suit of vel-
vet-soft tweed, her scarf of pointed
fox, held every eye. Her hands, in
gloves of immaculate doeskin, rested
on the rail before her. She did not
look like a gangster’s girl—like two
gangsters’ girl.

  Dinsmore waited a moment for the
picture to register, then stepped before
the witness stand.

  “What is your name?”

  “ Florence Jordan.” Her voice wras
low.

  “ Speak a little louder, Floss,” said
Dinsmore.

  “ Florence Jordan.” she repeated in
a louder voice.

  “ That’s better.” Dinsmore smiled
at her. “ Thank you, Floss.

  “ Now tell us, please, what happened
on the night of September 23 and in
the early morning after.”

  Nervously at iirst, and then with
more control, she told of what had hap-
pened at A1 Dooner’s party. Dinsmore
interrupted her once to say: “Were
you jealous of this woman Brady was
making love to. Floss?”

  She answered: “ I wasn’t jealous. I
just didn't want to be insulted that
way. And the way he spoke to me
drove me crazy.”

  “ What did you do after Brady left
the party?”

  “ I went home.”

  “ Where do you live?”

  “ Around the corner from the Lo-
cust.”

  “ And then what happened ?”

  “ Somebody called me on the phone.
Somebody called me on the phone and
said that Brady—that he had taken this
woman to his apartment.”

  “You had been drinking, hadn't
you ?”

  “ Well, it was quite a party.”

  “ And who was it that called you?”
She hesitated. “ Does it make any
difference?”

  “ The truth’s important now, Floss,”
Dinsmore told her.

 “Well—it—it was Whitey Hig-
gins.”

  “ Your friend Higgins who testified
here awhile ago ?”

  “ Not my friend!”

  “ And you wrere still under the in-
fluence of liquor?”

  “ I bet I drank a month's rent.”

  “ Then what happened?”

  “ I ran around to the Locust. I went
up to Brady’s room. I saw his gun
on the dresser. He was lying on the
couch.” She stopped. Her breath was
coming hard.

  Dinsmore said: “Now take your
time, Floss. Just take your time. We’ve
got all the time there is. Want some
water ?”

  Floss shook her head. The words
came slowly, but terribly clear. “ You
understand, I was cock-eyed drunk. I
grabbed the gun—I closed my eyes—
And I—I shot him.” Her hands, in
their new gloves, gripped the rail.

  The court room was so silent that
the creak of Brown's chair sounded like
a whip-crack. Dinsmore shoved one
hand into his pocket, took it out, and
said: “ So that’s wdiat you wouldn’t
tell us, is it. Floss?”

  She nodded and closed her eyes. An
attendant gave her a glass of water.
Dinsmore went on : “ How many times
did you fire?”

  Her whisper was clear at the very
door. “ Once. Once—and then I ran.”
“ Cross-examine,” said Dinsmore,
and sat down.

  Brown walked up close to her. “ You
THE SILENT WITNESS

619

say you shot Brady as he lay there on
the couch?”

  “ Yes. I said it. God help me—
I did!”

CHAPTER VI
The Lady in Black

“AND you say you only shot him
    once!”

        “ Once.”

  “ Well, if, as you say, you were—
er—cock-eyed drunk, how can you be
sure you only fired once?”

  “ I am sure. There are some things
you're sure of.’’

  “ Why did you run away?”

  “ Say,” she demanded, “ do you
think I was waiting for the tabloids?”
Brown looked annoyed. “ You say
you only shot him once. All the other
witnesses, of proved credibility, have
testified to hearing three shots.”

  She nodded. “ I heard the other two
shots myself. I heard them just as I
was running out of the room.”

  Brown permitted himself to smile.
“ So you account for three bullets in
Brady’s body by two of them being
fired after you threw the gun on the
floor.”

  “ I am not accounting. I’m telling
you what happened. I heard them. I
don’t know where they came from.”

  “ Do you expect me to believe that ?’’
Brown cried savagely.

  “Well,” she snapped, “if you’re
really interested to know, I didn’t ex-
pect you to.”

  Brown waved her angrily away. She
smoothed the doeskin gloves with
trembling fingers and sought the chair
beside Don.

  “ Now,” said Dinsmore grimly, “ I
will call Mr. Arthur Welliver Beele.”
Beele took the stand without a
change of face.

  “ What is your occupation, Mr.
Beele?”

  “ I’m a reporter for the Telegraph.”
“Were you in the course of your
duties assigned to this case?”

 “ It looked to me more like an act
 of God.”

 “ Did you inspect the room where
 the crime was committed?”

 “ Oh, yes,” said Beele.“ ves, indeed.”
 “Alone?”

 “ If you mean 1 had company, yes;
 if you mean I had help, no.”

 “ Who was there?”

 “ Among others, Captain Ryan.”

 “ During your inspection, did you
 find anything which you considered
 evidential with respect to this case?”
 “ Oh, yes,” said Beele calmly.

 “ What was it?”

 “ A Maxim silencer designed to fit
 the barrel of a thirty-eight Smith and
 Wesson revolver.”

 “ Did you know that when you
 found it?"

 Beele shook his head. “ I’m only a
 reporter, so J took it to an ordnance
 expert that I know.”

 “ Wrho is that ?”

 “ Frank Johns. That fat man over
 there with the fuzzy overcoat.”

 “ You took the silencer away with
 you ?”

 “ I did.”

 “ Why?”

 “ It would have been a shame to
 waste it.”

 “ Didn’t you endeavor to cooperate
 with the proper police authorities when
 you were in possession—wholly inad-
 vertent possession—of what might
 prove valuable evidence?”

 “ I always try to.”

 “ Did you,” snapped the court, “ or
 did you not?”

 “ Your honor," returned Beele, “ the
 answer is yes.”

 “ And what about the police depart-
 ment?” said Dinsmore.

 “ The police department," Beele de-
 clared sadly, “ gave me the cold shoul-
 der.”

 “ So thereafter,” Dinsmore went on,
 “ you worked by yourself.”>

 “ You might as well call it that.”

 “ What did you do with the
 silencer?”
620

DETECTIVE FICTION WEEKLY

  “ I turned it over to Mr. Boyd Fred-
ericks for finger-print comparison with
some prints in the Rogues Gallery.”

  “ Whose prints ?”

  “ Ralph Higgins. Arrested for high-
way robbery with intent to kill in 1926,
but never brcnght to trial.”

  “Object!” shouted Brown.
“Objection overruled,” snapped the
court. “ The witness may continue.”

  “ Then I made the rounds of the
residents of the hotel. The one I
wanted had become an ex-resident.”

  “ Who is that?”

  “ Miss Euphemia Shaw—that nice
little lady there in black. She’d lived
011 the iloor above Higgins and Brady
right across the court from Higgins.
She told me she ate lobster on the night
of the murder. She remembered being
awake at two fifteen, because she was
trying to read a magazine story in less
time than the minutes allotted at the
beginning of the story. She'd heard
the shots and she thought lobster was
a better way to die.” Beele paused.
“Why?" said Dinsmore.

  “ Because it sounded to her as if
somebody was trying to kill her. Two
of the bullets landed in the woodwork
over her window.”

  “Are these the bullets?” Dinsmore
handed them over.

  “ They are.”

  “ Did you ascertain their caliber?”

  “ They’re thirty-twos.”

  “ And Brady was shot with thirty-
eights.”

  “ Exactly.”

  “ Go on.”

  “ Well, 1 just had a hunch that they
might have been shot from an auto-
matic. An automatic ejects the cylin-
ders. So I climbed down the fire es-
cape from Miss Shaw’s room—there’s
a glass roof that covers the court. And
there they were. Two nice little
cylinders.”

  “These?” said Dinsmore, handing
them over.

  “ These.”

  “ Go on.”

  “ Then I went to visit Captain Ryan.
He took away a thirty-two automatic
from Higgins one day when I wjas
there. I went to see it again.”

  “ Did you get to see it?”

  “ See it? Why, he even told me to
go and shoot myself with it! So I took
it and gave it and the cylinders and
the bullets to Mr. Johns^who is, as I
said, the fat man in the fuzzy overcoat
who knows all about ordnance.”

  Mr. Johns, who was indeed fat and
fuzzily overcoated, corroborated what
Mr. Beele had said about the silencer,
the automatic, the cylinders and the
bullets.

  Miss Shaw declared that Mr. Beele
had broken both blades of her sewing-
scissors in digging the bullets from her
window-frame, and had forgotten to
get her a new pair. Also that hence-
forth she simply couldn’t bear lobster.

  Dinsmore shoved together the ex-
hibits. His little eyes glittered above
his flushed cheeks.

  “ Your honor,” he began, “ the de-
fendant has admitted firing a shot at
Brady. But it is my purpose to give
emphasis to the proof, by reestablish-
ing the time of the murder and calling
back Mr. Higgins and Collins, the bell-
boy, that Higgins was in his room at
the time when Floss Jordan ran out,
I shall prove that there were not three
shots fired, but five shots. Of these
five, only one, as I shall prove, could
have been fired by Floss Jordan. I in-
tend to prove that the other four were
fired by Higgins. I—”

  Brown was on his feet, interrupting.
“ Your honor, it seems to me—”

  " Mr. Dinsmore may continue,”
ruled the court.

  “ 1 shall show,” Dinsmore went on,
a little faster, “ that Higgins fired two
shots, the shots that killed Brady. He
fired those in Brady’s room, from
Brady's gun, the gun with the silencer.
They were not heard. The dead man
lay on the couch. I will show that he
took off the silencer and placed it in
the drawer. He wiped off the gun and
THE SILENT WITNESS

621

put it on the dresser. But he forgot
to wipe off the silencer. They always
forget something. Then—”

  “ Your honor,” said Brown, “ I—”
“ Go on,” snapped the court, “ go
on, Mr. Dinsmore.”

  “ Then,” Dinsmore coninued quick-
ly, “ he telephoned to Floss Jordan his
lying story of Brady and the other
woman. He knew Floss well—well
enough to know she wouldn’t let it go
by. And when he knew she was in
Brady’s room, he heard the shot she
fired. Immediately he went to his win-
dow and fired twice from his own gun,
and—”

  “ If the court please!” Brown was
shouting wildly. Then some one shook
him by the elbow'. It was Ryan, his
face red.

  Dinsmore raised his voice. “ The
number of shots heard correspond to
the number of thirty-eight caliber bul-
lets fired from Brady’s gun. I will
show that Floss Jordan fired her shot
at a dead man. And so—’’

  “If it please the court!” Brown
shouted still more loudly. *

  Judge Brazleton exclaimed wrath-

fully: “ Mr. Brown, you are decidedly
out of order.”

  “ I beg to differ,” Brown retorted.
“ Captain Ryan informs me that he has
just elicited a confession from Higgins,
claiming self-defense!”

  “ Well,” said Beele an hour later in
Dinsmore’s office, “ now let’s see: five
hundred for experts, five hundred for
expenses. That leaves five hundred I
have and a thousand you have. Write
a check for that, pop, before you go
fishing.”

  “ Check ?” Dinsmore demanded. “ I
don’t have to make checks out to my-
self.”

  “ Don't you ever think of anybody
but yourself ? It’s not nice to give wed-
ding presents in cash. Checks are a
lot more refined. And you can give
me a drink because I'm going to brace
old Harrington for a five-buck raise.”

  Dinsmore made out the check and
filled the glasses. “ This is nice Bene-
dictine, Arty. Real extra-legal stuff.

I	got it from Judge Brazleton."

  “ Well,” said Beele. holding up his
glass, “ save a shot for Ryan.”

Concealed Weapons

OUT in Kansas City, Joseph Desmond, night attendant at the Monarch
Garage, was going about his work shortly after midnight, when he felt
a nudge in his side. Turning, he sa%v standing beside him a masked
negro. The negro had one hand hidden in his coat pocket. The pocket bulged
in a highly suggestive manner. The object that caused the bulge seemed to
be pointing at Desmond.

    Desmond paused not to argue. Without a word he went to the cash
register and surrendered the sixteen dollars and some odd cents it contained.
The bandit pocketed the money and started out of the garage.

     Alas for the.bandit's plans! Fate stepped into the ring in the person of
W. J. Brown, a street car dispatcher who had seen the whole performance.
Brown had a revolver. He displayed it to the negro, who, curiously enough,
showed no fight, made no attempt to draw his own weapon, and hastened to
admit that Brown was the boss.

    At police headquarters the bandit’s curious lack of belligerence was
explained. A search of his bulging side pocket brought to light, not a snub-
nosed automatic, but—an empty soda bottle.

    The negro explained that he needed the money, but didn't want to kill
anybody to get it.

Murphy Kills Two Birds

                The Slayer of Duke Puccelli Tangled
                His Trail Almost Beyond Unraveling

                    By Leslie MacFarlane

DUKE PUCCELLI was shot in
the back early Saturday after-
noon as he sat at a table in
Moran’s speakeasy, and within an hour
gangland was in an uproar.

  Duke’s slayer made a quick get-
away. Moran was out in the back open-
ing a case of beer at the time, and he
didn’t see the shooting. There was
only one other customer in the place
then, an inoffensive citizen from up-
town, and he cleared out in a hurry.
So, in a manner of speaking, the iden-
tity of the killer wras unknown.

  In a manner of speaking.

  Every one knew that the man who
had finished Duke was either Butch
Sikorski or one of his henchmen.

  Butch was a beer baron; Duke was
another. And Duke had crossed the
Sikorski deadline once too often. It
was common knowledge that one or
the other was ripe for the hurdles.

  At any rate, reprisals followed
swiftly.

  Somebody heaved a pineapple onto
the veranda of Sikorski’s home and
blew a hole in the house that you could
have driven a truck through. Some-
body else took a pot shot at a Sikorski
torpedo as he was coming out of a river
front poolroom and put a hole through
his hat brim. It was that close.

  The war was on.

  It had been brewing for months.
Down in gangland, men kept their rods

622
MURPHY KILLS TWO BIRDS

623

loaded, their eyes and ears open and
their mouths shut. The Homicide
Squad turned out, almost to a man,
ready for action. There was a dirty
night ahead.

  All of which is by way of leading
up to the announcement that Detectivc
Murphy didn’t get the job.

  Like any normal man, he had no
particular relish for a bullet in the back,
but, like any normal Irishman, he did
have relish for excitement and the
prospect of a battle. So when the in-
spector detailed most of the Homicide
Squad for the Puccelli case and the
resulting uproar, Detective Murphy
was disappointed because he was kept
in the office. Detective Levinsky, whom
Murphy didn’t like, was also retained.

  “ Gorry, and it’s no place for a man.
warmin’ a chair when there’s all sorts
of murderin’ cutthroats out lookin’ fer
trouble,” groaned Murphy.

  “ You should worry,” chirped Levin-
sky. “ It's better than spendin' a
couple of weeks in hospital, ain’t it, or
havin’ the rest of us cough up to buy
you a wreaf ?”

  “Ye would say that,” grunted
Murphy. “ Sittin’ down is no job fer
an Irishman, when there’s fightin’ in
the air.”

  “ Somebody’s gotta stick around,”
said Levinsky. “Never know when
something else might break.”

  “ There’ll be nothin’ else break this
day—excepting down by the river,
where we won’t be sent.”

  But Detective Murphy was wrong.
Something did break. The inspector
called him in.

  “ Beat it out to 87 Manley Street,”
he ordered crisply. “ Chap named
Fenwick killed. House belongs to a
man named White.”

  “Ah!” beamed Detective Murphy.
“ Thank ye, inspector. It's more than

I	hoped fer.”

  “You'll have to handle it alone. I
can’t spare Levinsky just now.”

  “ And it’s not me that’ll kick about
that, either.”

  Murphy departed, happily. At any
rate, a death in the suburbs was better
than nothing, although deaths did not
always mean murder. Levinsky mut-
tered: “You love work, don’t you?”
and lit another cigarette.

  Murphy clambered into a depart-
ment car and drove out to Manley
Street, where he found that No. 87
was a neat little brick house exactly
similar to a score of other neat little
brick houses on either side and across
the road, A patrolman was at the
door, while a little group of bystanders
stood at a respectful distance and
stared.

  “What’s it all about, Dan?” asked
Murphy.

  “Guy named Fenwick got bumped
off,” said Dan, opening the door.
“ Shot through the head. He roomed
here.”

  “ Anybody else in the house?”

  “ White and the wife. They’re up-
stairs havin’ hysterics together.”

  Dan led the way toward a kitchen
at the back of the house, and there
Murphy saw the body of the man, lying
on the floor. It could be seen at a
glance that he was dead and that his
death had been caused by a bullet that
had struck him in the forehead.

  The victim was in his early thirties,
a square-faced, solid-looking fellow, al-
most six feet in height and heavy in
proportion. Beside his body lay frag-
ments of a bottle that had smashed on
the floor, and the neck of this bottle
was still grasped in his right hand. On
the table, just beneath the window,
were two glasses, one of which con-
tained a small quantity of colorless
fluid.

  Murphy inspected the room. The
patrolman, spying half a dozen young-
sters who had clambered to the roof of
the garage in the back yard for a better
view of proceedings, brandished his
baton through the open window and
ordered them to clear out.

  “You’d think it was a ball game,”
grumbled Dan.
C24

DETECTIVE FICTION WEEKLY

  On the floor, near the body, was a
sheet of crumpled newspaper. Murphy
picked it up carefully. It was page
fifteen of an evening paper published
in the city, of a date about two weeks
previous.

  The detective examined it, thought-
fully. To the patrolman, he gave the
sheet considerably more attention than
its importance warranted. Murphy
finally put the paper on the table, with-
out folding it, looked around the room
again and asked where he could find
Mr. and Mrs. White.

  “ They’re . upstairs,” said Dan.
“ She went sorta cuckoo and lie's been
tryin’ to quiet her. Although he’s al-
most as bad himself.”

  “ Who told you about this busi-
ness?”

  “ The woman. She came gallopin’
out of the house, yellin' murder. Kept
sayin’: ‘Oh, Tom killed him! Tom
killed him!’ I come in and White -was
sittin’ in the front room, talkin’ to him-
self. Scared green. I got a whiff of his
breath and I think he’s kinda stewed.”
“‘Tom killed him!’ eh? What’s
White’s first name, do ve know?”
“Toni;”

  Detective Murphy went upstairs. In
a bedroom at the top of the landing
he found Mrs. White, a fragile, pretty
little blonde, lying 011 the bed, sobbing
and moaning convulsively. Sitting be-
side her was her husband.

  Murphy had seen frightened men
before, but he had never seen a man
quite so frightened as Mr. White. His
face was gray, beads of perspiration
stood out on his forehead, his lips were
blue, his eyes stared vacantly. He was
a big man, and for one of such bulk
such abject fright was somehow incon-
gruous. Murphy’s practiced eye saw
that while the fellow was not drunk he
was under the influence of liquor to
some extent.

  “Well,” said Murphy. “This is a
bad business. What happened?”

  White gulped, then said thickly:
“ He—he was shot.’’

  “ That’s easily seen. Who shot
him?” —

  “ I—I’m not saying anything,” mut-
tered White. “ There’s 110 use asking
me. I’ll have to see my lawyer.”
Murphy rubbed his chin reflectively.
“ Ye don’t have to- talk unless ye
have a mind to,” he admitted. “ Did
ye shoot him yourself?”

  White shook his head.

  “No, 1 didn’t kill him. I’m not
going to say anything. I’ll have to see
my lawyer—”

  Mrs. White sat up suddenly.

  “You killed him!” she screamed.
“ You said you would! I’ve seen it
coming. Your suspicions—all those
things you’ve said about Jim and me—
why couldn’t you let him go? He was
leaving anyway.”

  Overcome, she fell to sobbing hyster-
ically again.

  “ There w-as some trouble between
ye and the man who was killed ?” asked
Murphy.

  White, his hands twitching, stood
up. “No! There wasn’t any trouble—”
“ There was!” clamored the woman,
fiercely. “ There’s been trouble all
along. Ever since Jim came here to
live with us. You’ve been silly and
jealous.”

  “ Let’s get this straight,” said
Murphy patiently. “ Who are ye
talkin’ about, ma’am? Who was he
jealous about?”

  “Jim. Tim Fenwick. And now he’s
dead. Murdered.”

  “ I wasn’t jealous,” said White sul-
lenly. “Jim was a friend of mine. I
wouldn’t have asked him to come and
room here if he wrasn’t.”

  “Yes,” snapped the woman. “You
were the one who asked him. And from
the day he came into the house you
were suspicious of me. You accused
him of all sorts of things. There’s been
nothing but trouble.”

  “ Thought he was tryin’ to break up
your home, eh?” said Murphy to the
man.

  “ I did raise a row," White admitted.

“ He wasn’t to blame, though. He
convinced me that there was nothing
wrong. Why, we just made up the
quarrel this afternoon. We shook
hands on it and we were having a few
drinks, just to show there was no hard,
feelings.”

  “Yes?” encouraged Murphy.

 “ Well—we were having a few
drinks. He got killed.”

 “How?”

  “ That’s all I’m going to say,” mut-
tered White doggedly. “ I’ll have to
see my lawyer.”

  “You killed him!” screamed the
woman. “ I heard the shot. I came
downstairs and he was lying, dead in
the kitchen.”

II

 WHEN ye came downstairs,
 ma’am,” said Murphy, “ where
 was your husband?”

  “ In the dining room. Sitting by the
table, mopping his face with a hand-
kerchief.”

  “ Did ye see the revolver ?”

  “ No. I didn’t see it. I guess he threw’
it away. Out the window, probably.
But he has a revolver—a great big
one!”

  “ You heard the shot, ma’am?”
“Yes..Then I heard somebody fall
on the floor, and a bottle smashed. I
ran downstairs right away.”

  “And your husband was sitting in
the dining room?”

      i	es.

  “ How long did it take ye to get
downstairs?”

  “ Only a few seconds. I ran.”

  “ Did they have a row this after-
noon ?”

  “ They had one this morning. Tom
had been throwing slurs at Jim all week
—about me. This morning, Jim took
him up and told him what a fool he
was and that there was no reason for
being so jealous and suspicious. Jim
said be was sick and tired of it, and
he was going to room somewhere else.
Tom went out after lunch and came

 4 D

  back about the middle of the after-
noon. J im .was upstairs packing. Tom
went up and they talked for awhile.
They came downstairs and went out
into the kitchen. I went up to my room.

I	could hear them talking and drink-
ing!”

  “ How long were ye up here before
ye heard the shot?”

  “ More than an hour, I guess.”

  “ Hmm!” Murphy turned to White.
"Now have ye anything to say?”

  “ She’s right, as far as it goes. I’m
not talking. I’ll wait until I see my
lawyer.”

  “ Mebbe ye'll need him,” Murphy
said politely. Nevertheless, as he went
downstairs again he was aware of a
certain professional admiration for the
suspect. “ The lad knows his potaties.
The less he talks, the better chance his
lawyer will have to get him off.”
There was no doubt in his mind that
White had killed Fenwick. That seemed
clear enough. Just the same, there
were a few points that puzzled him. He
went out into the kitchen and found
that the doctor had arrived and was
now examining the body.

  “If ye can dig that bullet out, doc,
I’d like to have a look at it,” suggested
Murphy.

  “ I guess I can get it for you. It isn’t
in very deep, and I have my instru-
ments here.”

  “ He went out quick, eh ?”

  “ Like that!” said the doctor, snap-
ping his fingers. “ Never knew what
hit him.”

  “ Didn’t even have time to let go the
bottle,” said Murphy, shaking his head
sadly. “ We never know, do we?
One minute we’re here and the next
minute we ain't. It’s a caution, to be
sure.”

  He went over to the table and looked
long and earnestly at the two glasses;
then he gathered up the fragments of
the broken bottle from the floor and
subjected them to scrutiny, even mak-
ing an attempt to fit some of the pieces
together. After that he made various
628

DETECTIVE FICTION WEEKLY

measurements, in relation to the posi-
tion of the body. He went outside and
prowled around the garage for awhile,
looked at the newly planted garden,
finally returned to the house.

  The doctor had extracted the bullet.

  “ There you are/’ he said, handing it
to Murphy. “ What kind of a cannon
fired that?"

  Murphy turned the slug of lead over
in his hand.

  “ A big one, eh ?" he grunted.
“ Forty-five caliber, by the looks of it.”
He looked at the body on the floor.
“ Ye didn’t have much of a chance,
me lad."

  He put the bullet in his pocket, then
went over to the table and picked up
the sheet of newspaper again. It in-
terested him. The page had been torn
from a two-page sheet, and it was
crumpled at the top and bottom.
Murphy made various experiments, re-
storing the paper to its original folds
and at last nodded sagelyT

  “ Of course,” he said. “ I should
have seen that in the first place.”

  He telephoned to headquarters and
reported to the inspector, then went up-
stairs again. The man and the woman,
silent and fearful, were still in the bed-
room.

  “Ye’ll have to come with me,” he
said to them.

  White stood up readily.

  “ Are you arresting me ?”

  “Yes — and no!’’ said Murphy.
“ The lady will have to come, too.”

  Mrs. White was astonished.

 “Me!”

  “ I’m sorry, ma’am, but the inspec-
tor will have some questions to ask ye
both.”

  “ There’s no need of that!" declared
White brusquely. “ My wife was up-
stairs when this happened. She doesn’t
know any more about it than she has
told you already.”

  “ Mebbe,” said Murphy, enigmati-
cal!}'. “ She’ll have to come along just
the same.”

  “ But why ? She doesn’t know any-

thing, I tell you. She didn’t see the
shooting.”

  “ Listen!” roared Murphy suddenly.
“ Listen, me man! Are ye trvin’ to
shield somebody?”

  The question caught White off his
guard. He made a nervous, fright-
ened gesture, then licked his dry lips.

  “ No, of course, not. But—”

  “ Then why don’t ye talk ? Why
won’t ye tell what ye_know ?”

  “ I don’t have to talk. I know things
look bad for me. That’s why I want
to see my lawyer first.”

  “ Sure,” growled Murphy. He
swung suddenly about to face the
woman. “ Why was Fenwick leavin’
this house?”

For a moment she coidd not answer.
Then she said, in a high, tense voice:
“ I’ve told you. He was tired of
Tom’s attitude. He didn’t want to
cause trouble—”

  “Arc ye sure?" bellowed Murphy.
“ Are ye sure it wasn’t because he had
a quarrel wid him? Were ye sore at
him because he was leavin’?”

  “Listen here!” exclaimed White
angrily.

  “ Shut up! Hurry up, ma’am. An-
swer me. Was that the reason?"

  She began to sob hysterically.

  “ No. It wasn’t. I’ve told you the
truth!”

  Murphy turned to the man.

  “ Where’s that revolver?”

  “ Downstairs.”

  “ Where?”

  “ In a cupboard in the kitchen.”

  “ I want to see it. Both of ye can
get ready to come with me to head-
quarters.”

  White accompanied the detective
downstairs and led him to the kitchen
cupboard, where he took a heavy re-
volver from an upper shelf. It was
a forty-five caliber weapon. Murphy
held it by the barrel, then wrapped a
towel about the revolver in order that
possible finger-prints would not be
eradicated.

  “ We’ll take a look at this later on,”
MURPHY KILLS TWO BIRDS

627

he promised. “ Better get your hat
and coat.”

  White hesitated.

  “ I won't walk to headquarters,” he
said. “ Will you let me call a taxi?"

  “ No need of that,” Murphy assured
him. “ I've got a car outside. We
never let our customers walk—at least
not until we’re finished wid ’em.”
Murphy left the house under police
guard and drove down to headquarters
with Mr. and Mrs. White. He sat in
the front seat with the chauffeur, but
he noticed something that made him
think. White turned up his coat collar
and pulled his hat down over his eyes,
even in the shelter of the car. It was
natural enough, perhaps, that the man
would want to hide himself from the
eyes of curious neighbors, but it struck
Murphy that the suspect carried his
caution to an extreme. <

  Suddenly he slapped his thigh.

  “ A hunch!” he exclaimed. “ I’ve got
a hunch!”

  “What's that you say?” asked the
chauffeur.

  “ Nothin’.”

  At headquarters he reported to the
inspector, and the Whites were brought
in for questioning.

  The inspector, who could bluster and
bellow with the best of them when it
came to cowing some tough victim,
adopted a more subtle technique in this
case. He made his inquiries suavely,
even sympathetically, treated the pair
with quiet courtesy, tried to lull them
into a sense of security. But he learned
no more than Murphy had gathered.
The woman asserted that her husband
had slain Fenwick in a jealous quarrel;
the man doggedly clung to his determi-
nation to say nothing until he had con-
ferred with his lawyer.

  They wrere detained, pending arrival
of the district attorney. Murphy was
left with the inspector, who turned to
him and said:

  “ It’s the woman, of course.”

  “ I had that idea meself,” observed
Murphy.

  “ She killed Fenwick, and now her
husband is trying to protect her. I
guess he figures that if he keeps his
mouth shut we’ll charge him with the
murder instead of her, and when it
comes to trial we won't be able to get
enough on him to convict, so they’ll
both go free.”

  “ It’s a smart scheme, so it is, sir.”

  “ We’ll give her a grilling later on.
She’ll come through.”

  “ If she did it,” said Murphy, “ she
will.” •

  “ Well, stay on the case. You may
be able to pick up something new. Talk
to the neighbors. Nose around.”

   “ I’ll do that, sir.”

  Murphy withdrew. But instead of ..
returning to the White home he made
his way directly to Moran’s speakeasy,
where Duke Puccelli had met his death
earlier in the afternoon. Had any of
his superior officers encountered him
and inquired the reason for his pres-
ence in a locality to which he had not
been assigned, Murphy wOuld have ex-
plained, with perfect truth, that he was
still working on the Fenwick murder.
As a matter of fact, he was following
the “ hunch ” that had occurred to him
while' he was bringing Mr. and Mrs.
White to headquarters.

  The speakeasy was located above a
pool room, and consisted of two
sparsely furnished rooms, with a busi-
nesslike bar at the rear,'and a little al-
cove back of that. One of the precinct
men, Hansen bv name, was still on .
the ground. Puccelli’s corpse had long
since been taken away.

  “Who sent you here?” growled
Hansen. “ I don’t need no help.”
Murphy grinned as he eyed the neck
of a bottle protruding from Hansen’s
pocket. “ No," he said, “ I don’t be-
lieve ye do.”

  “ Have one, then,” growled Han-
sen reluctantlv. “ They missed it in

   *	J

the clean-up.”

  Murphy was prowling around back
of the bar. “ None fer me, thanks.
Not when I’m on duty.”
628

DETECTIVE FICTION WEEKLY

  “ What are you lookin’ for?” asked
Hansen suspiciously.

  “ Evidence.”

  “ Everything’s gone. There was a
squad here from uptown. They took
away everythin’ they’d need."

  “ Sure, but I’m thinkin’ they might
have left somethin’ / might need,’’
grunted Murphy. He was hidden be-
hind the bar. Then he straightened
up. thrusting something into his pocket.
“ And they did.”

  “ I don’t get this at all. What’s the
big idea?”

  Murphy whistled amiably.

  “ Have they found who killed Puc-
celli yet?” he asked.

  “ No. And they won’t. Nobody'll
talk. You know how it is. These
mobs settle things themselves.”

  “ I guess the Sikorski mob could
tell, eh?”

  Hansen became confidential.

  “ That’s just it,” he said. “ I’ve got
more than a pretty good idea that they
don’t know either. One of them birds
is a guy I can talk to, see, and if he
knew anythin’ he’d tell it to me. And
lie says that it wasn't a Sikorski man.
Butch himself said so. They figger it
was some outsider that had a grudge
against Duke and bumped him off,
knowing Sikorski’s mob would get
blamed for it.”

  “ Boloney!”

  “ You don’t have to eat it. I’m only
tellin’ you what 1 know. If it was an
outsider did the job he’s probably sit-
tin’ back all safe and sound and laugh-
in’ to beat hell because he's stirred the
gangs up to battle. They’ve been look-
in’ for an excuse long enough.”

  “ I don’t like to brag,” said Murphy,
expansively, “ but I’m willin’ to bet ye
a cigar—a ten-center—that inside an
hour I’ll know who shot Puccelli.”

  “ I thought you said you weren’t on
this case.”

  “ I’m not,” returned Murphy. “ I’m
just performin’ a delicate little trick
known as killin’ two birds wid one
stone. It’s an old Irish custom.”

  Whereat he strode out, jauntily, and
hastened back to headquarters.

Ill

IN a private room, he faced White.

“ Have ye seen your lawyer yet ?”
     White shook his head.

  “ He’s on his way down.”

   “ And ye still insist ye won’t talk ?”
   “ No.”

  Slowly, Murphy took a sheet of
newspaper from his pocket, unfolded
'it and put it on the table.

  “ See that?”

  “ What about it ? A sheet of paper,
that’s all.”

  “Know where I found it?”

  White hesitated. His eyes shifted.
He was pale. “ Why—no,” he stam-
mered.

  “ Back of the bar in Moran’s speak-
easy.”

  White tried to remain calm, but the
effort was a failure.

  “ Ye’ll notice,” said Murphy, “ that
it’s half of a full sheet of newspaper
that was torn in two. And here,” he
continued, taking another sheet from
his pocket, unfolding it and piecing
the two together, “ is the other half.
Ye can see how it matches. I found
it in the kitchen at your house. It was
used for wrappin’ up a bottle of gin.
So by puttin’ two and two together, in
a manner of speakin’, I guess you were
at Moran’s place this afternoon. That’s
where you got the gin that Fenwick
was pourin’ out when he was shot.”
White was silent. He rubbed the
back of his hand across his perspiring
brow. At last he said:

  “ Yes—I got the gin there this morn-
ing.”

  Murphy shook his head.

  “Ye got it this afternoon. Ye were
workin’ this morning, and ye left the
house early this afternoon, went to
Moran’s, got the gin and then came
home.” Murphy leaned across the
table. “ Who shot Duke Puccelli ?”
White leaped up.

“ I don’t know! I wasn’t there—”
MURPIIY KILLS TWO BIRDS

629

  “Ye were! Tell me! Who shot
him?”

  “ I don’t know, I tell you. I don’t
know his name. I only saw him for
a few seconds. I don’t want to say
anything about it,” White clamored.
“ You know what it means if I get in
wrong with any of these gangs. If
you use me as a witness, I’ll be mur-
dered. They’ll get me. Moran said so.
He told me to keep my mouth shut.”
White sat down weakly. He was
trembling, frightened.

  Murphy studied the man for a few
moments. Then he remembered what
Hansen had told him.

  “ Is that what ye’re worryin’ about?”
he laughed. “• Well, just listen to me.
The man who shot Puccelli ain’t in
any of the gangs. He’s playin’ a lone
hand. He don’t belong, see. If he
wants to shut you up he’ll have to do
it himself. And as long as he’s run-
nin’ around loose, the more danger>for
you. Once we get him locked up, ye’ve
got nothin’ to be scared of, for he
won’t have any friends on the outside
gunnin’ for ye. Figure that out.”
White figured it out.

  “ Is that straight goods?” he asked,
finally. “ I won’t have the whole Si-
korski gang on my neck if I tell what
1 know?”

  “ The Sikorski gang won’t give a
good-sized hoot what happens to the
man who killed Puccelli. He ain’t in
their crowd. If it’s playin’ safe ye
want to be, tell what ye know and have
him locked up.”

  White nodded his head thoughtfully.
“ If he’s an outsider, that makes a
difference,” he said.

  “ I was tipped off to it not less than
twenty minutes ago.”

  White drummed on the table with
his finger tips.

  “ I was in Moran’s place, all right,”
he said. “ I went down there to get
a bottle of gin. I sat down and had
a drink. Puccelli was sitting at a table
near the door. He was pretty drunk.
The door opened. I guess the fellow

must have had a duplicate key, for
Moran keeps it locked and only opens
if you give the right knock. This man
stepped into the room, looked over at
Puccelli, hauled out a revolver and let
fly. He drilled one at me, too, but I
was under the table by then. Moran
gave a shout, from the back, and was
just coming in when this fellow beat
it. Moran didn’t get a look at him.”
“ Do ye know his name ?”

  “ Never saw him before. He was
short and slim, dressed in a gray suit.
A neat little chap, but tough. Thin
face. His nose looked sort of funny.
I think it must have been broken at
one time.”

  Murphy’s big fist thudded on the
table.

  “ Ye've as good as told me his
name!” he declared. “ Wait a minute
and I’ll show ye his picture.”

  He hastened out of the room and re-
turned in a few minutes with two
rogues gallery photographs, profile and
full-face, of a young man officially
listed as Hymie Kranz, alias Grant,
alias Robinson, former pugilist, confi-
dence man and convict, in the order
named. When White looked at the
pictures he nodded.

  .“ That’s the man.”

  “ Ah!” said Murphy.

IV

ACCORDING to all the rules and
L regulations, Murphy should have
reported to the inspector, but he
didn’t. He had handled the case alone
so far and he had no mind to let some
one else — Levinsky, for instance —
share the glory of the climax. So he
hastened out to locate Hymie Kranz
without assistance.

  There are ways and means. The un-
derworld has many eyes. So has the
police department. In twenty minutes
Detective Murphy was ascending a
flight of stairs in a cheap apartment
house uptown.

  He halted before a door and rapped.
  Footsteps. Some one called out:
630

DETECTIVE FICTION WEEKLY

  “ Who's there?”

  “ Headquarters," growled Murphy.
“ Open up!”

  “ Just a minute.”

  “ Come on. Come on. Open up!”

  There were vague sounds in the
apartment, and then a sudden and sus-
picious silence. Murphy tried the door,
it was locked.

  No time to lose. He whisked out a
bunch of keys designed for just such
delicate emergencies. He tried one,
and then another. He lost valuable
moments before he found one that
fitted the lock. He thrust open the
door, rushed into the apartment. It
was deserted. He ran into the kitchen-
ette at the back. The window was
open. He looked out. A steel fire
escape dangled against the brick wall.
It swayed slightly, and the window just
below was open. At the same time,
Murphy heard the scream of a woman
and a confused uproar in the apartment
beneath.

  He wheeled about and ran back
through the apartment into the hall,
and peered over the stair railing just
in time to see a man plunge through
a doorway just below.

  “ Stop!” roared Murphy, tugging at
his revolver.

  The man looked up. Something
flashed. Twro shots roared out, and a
bullet chipped a splinter off the railing.

  Murphy returned the compliment,
but the man was already racing toward
the street door. He fired again. Glass
crashed. Hymie had reached the door.
The apartment house was aroused. A
woman was screeching. People were
running out into the hallways.

  Detective Murphy plunged down the
stairs. Hymie was out in the street
now. Murphy gained the pavement
just in time to see his quarry leap to
the running board of a taxi parked by
the curb and thrust his revolver into
the face of the astonished driver.

  The taxi man was taking no chances.
The car began to move away from the
curb.

  Murphy crossed the pavement in two
bounds and leaped toward the car just
as Hymie swung around, revolver up-
raised. More by good luck than good
judgment, Murphy struck Hymie’s
wrist and the revolver went off harm-
lessly. They grappled together, tum-
bled off the running board and crashed
to the paving. There, even Hymie’s
pugilistic skill was of no avail because
Detective Murphy, weighing close on
two hundred pounds, was uppermost.

  Hymie did make an effort to get rid
of the gun. He managed to free his
arm for a moment while Murphy wTas
reaching for the handcuffs, and hurled
the weapon far out into the road, into
the traffic. The taxi driver, however,
retrieved it. This was fortunate, be-
cause the revolver was important.

  A certain laboratory device at head-
quarters revealed the cold fact that the
bullet extracted from the body of Duke
Puccelli had been fired by the revolver
of Hymie Kranz, and could have been
fired by no other weapon. It was a
big revolver, and the markings on the
bullet were distinctive.

  The laboratory device revealed a
further astonishing fact. At least, it
was astonishing to every one save De-
tective Murphy. The bullet that took
the life of Duke Puccelli was identical
in markings with the bullet that killed
Jim Fenwick.

  Later on, Hymie Kranz admitted
what science had already proved. He
had murdered both men.

  “ I bumped off the Duke, all right,”
he confessed sullenly. “ He stole my
sweetie while I was in stir so I come
back to get him. There was another
guy in the speakeasy when it happened,
and he got a good look at me. This
beak of mine gives me away every time,
so I got scared he’d tell. I figured I’d
better get him out of the way, too.
I made Moran tell me his name and
where he lived, so I went up to the place
and hung around the garage until I
saw him standin’ in the kitchen, pour-
in’ a drink. Then I plugged him.”
MURPHY KILLS TWO BIRDS

631

  “ The mistake he made,” said Mur-
phy, discussing matters with the inspec-
tor, “ was in pluggin’ the wrong man.
Poor Fenwick was just about the same
size and build as White was. He was
the goat.”

  “ You certainly killed two birds with
one stone,” said the inspector approv-
ingly. “ But howr did you dope it out?
What made you figure that neither
White nor the wife killed Fenwick?”
Murphy shrugged.

  “ Anybody could see it,” he observed
modestly. “ Fenwick had the bottle in
his hand when he was shot. And there
was only a bit of gin in one glass and
none at all in the other. The glasses
were on the table. So Fenwick must
have been standin’ at the table, facin’
the window, w'hen he got shot. The
bullet was right in the middle of his
forehead. That showed two things—•
that whoever did it wras a fine shot and
that he was standin’ outside the house.
More than that, the bullet hadn’t gone
in very deep, and it was fired by a big
revolver. If it had been fired close to
him it would have gone clean through
his head. Puttin’ two and two to-
gether, I figured that the lad who shot
him must have been standin’ out by
the garage. So that got me to thinkin’
that it wasn’t White nor his wife. If
they was doin’ any murderin’ they’d
stay in the house to do it.”

  “ But how did you hook that up with
the Puccelli affair?”

  “ That was where me hunch came
in. I was wonderin’ why White
wouldn’t talk, when things looked so
bad ag’in’ him. At first I got to think-
in’ as ye did—that his wife did the
killin’ and he was just tryin’ to protect

her. Then I noticed how he kept him-
self hid when he was in the car on the
way to headquarters. 1 had seen the
smashed gin bottle in the kitchen, and
the newspaper it had been wrapped up
in. The paper bein’ on the floor showed
me he must have got the gin just that
day and when Mrs. White said he had
gone out for awhile in the afternoon
and started drinkin’ wid Fenwick when
he come back, it showed me he got the
gin early in the afternoon. He must
have been in a speakeasy. And then
it all popped into me head at once, sir.
He was scared and he w:as keepin’ his
mouth shut because if he told us that
Fenwick was killed by mistake, he’d
have to tell its about the affair at Mo-
ran's. He was afraid if he give evi-
dence ag’in’ the lad that shot Puccelli,
the whole Sikorski mob would lay for
him.”

  “ Can’t blame him.”

  “ 1 just sorta guessed that he must
have been the customer in Moran’s
place when Duke got bumped off. After
that, it was simple enough. I went
down to Moran’s to make sure, and I
found the rest of the sheet of news-
paper Moran had used to wrap up the
bottle of gin. That proved it. Then
I talked to White, quietlike, and he had
to admit he saw the killin’. I per-
suaded him he’d be a lot better off if
he told me who did it, so he described
the lad and I knew it must be Hymie
Kranz. The broken nose pinned it on
Hymie. So then I went out and got
him.”

  “ It sounds simple when you say it
quick,” remarked the inspector. Ayd
he grinned approvingly at Detective
Aloysius Murphy.
The Clew of the Clot

Chief Inspector Gilmartin Tak.es
a Hand in the Riddle That
Baffles Scotland Yard • Who
Murdered Sarkisian?

By Charles Barry

“ I’m Millie Buchan,
the girl cried hyster-
ically. “ Let my
father go!"

WHAT HAS GONE BEFORE

Leonidas sarkisian, an un-
scrupulous money lender, was
^ found murdered in his office in
the Brandt Building. His secretary,
Miss Ransome, summoned Buchan, the
elevator starter, who called the police.

  Miss Ransome could shed little light
on the circumstances of the murder.
She did relate to the police that
Buchan, bending over Sarkisian, mut-
tered : “ You deserved it, you dirty
swine.” Buchan confessed to Barber
of Scotland Yard that he had said such
a thing because he knew Sarkisian was
the man responsible for sending his
daughter, Millie, “ on the road to hell.”
Suspicion was also directed against
Bertram W. Buckeridge, but he
proved an alibi. Buckeridge was a
debtor of Sarkisian. A sudden develop-
ment of the case sent Barber on an-

other angle. Sarkisian, he learned, was
one of the conspirators in a huge white
slave traffic plot. Barber’s informant
was Rose Bamberger who, with Millie
Buchan, had narrowly escaped being-
shanghaied.

  While Barber was tracing down the
white slave angle, two men called at
Sarkisian’s office, where Sergeant Wil-
kins was in charge. One was Kypri-
anos, Sarkisian’s partner. The other
was a young man named Barraclough.

silent, and her handsome eyes were
now and then on the point of shedding
the tears which she would fain have
kept back.

  Barber was thoughtful also. lie
found himself wondering what his next
.step should be, and he was less con-
fident than he had been that morning
of solving the mystery of the murder

of Leonidas Sarkisian. Already within
a few hours he had run up against
several developments which might or
might not provide clews to the identity
of the killer but practically every one of
them pointed in a different direction
from the others. To follow one track
might mean the cooling of the scent
upon another.

  Remembering his promise to look in
on Sergeant Wilkins he decided to
visit the Brandt Building first, and so,
having deposited the grateful Rose at a
spot not far from her lodging, he ar-
rived there to find that his subordinate
had been nothing if not thorough. Not
only had Kyprianos been detained
against his will, but his visitor as well.
Having received Barber’s instructions,
the sergeant had promptly gone to the
outer office and, without a word of ex-
planation, had asked that young gentle-

man to give his name and address, a
request which met with the indignant
refusal which its heavy-handedness un-
doubtedly deserved.

   “ All right!” the bluff detective said
calmly, “ you’ll stay here till my in-
spector comes along.”

  Kyprianos advised his friend to
comply with the sergeant’s demand, but
Wilkins had already retired to the
inner office with a wink to the con-
stable, whose back was now made to
lean against the outer door. It was the.
resistance of that back which met In-
spector Barber's effort to push the
door in from the landing.

“ Hello!” he said when the
door opened. “ What’s the
^ trouble ?”

  Without waiting for an
  answer he asked:

  “ Which of you is Mr. Ky-
prianos?”

Sarkisian’s partner rose from
the easy chair in which he was
sitting tranquilly smoking.

“ I am,” he said politely. “ To
whom have I the honor of—”

“ Ah! There you are!” the ser-
geant’s voice interrupted from the
door. “Just a word, sir!”

  Barber went into Sarkisian’s office.
“ The other young chap,” the ser-
geant told him hurriedly, “ is the one
I told you about over the phone. He
saw Kyprianos in town last evening,
but Kyprianos says he came up from
Folkestone this morning. Says he can
prove it. The young ’un wouldn’t
give me his name and address when I
asked for them, so I thought I’d let
him cool his heels out there till you
came. His first name is Reggie, that’s
all I know.”

  Barber smiled, then nodded and went
back to the outer office.

  “ So you are Mr. Kyprianos!” he
said, as if he had not been interrupted.
“I should like a word with you in a
minute or two. In the meantime I
wish to see your friend, Mr. Reginald
—er—”
634	DETECTIVE FICTION WEEKLY

  “ Barraclough, the young man in
question supplied at once in an ag-
grieved tone. “ I don't see why I
should be kept here like this. 1 have
nothing to do with this bally murder,
and—”

  He stopped, probably because he had
not expected to be allowed to get so
far, and stood gaping open-mouthed at
Barber, who was quietly listening, with
a slight femile on his lips.

  “ Yes?” the inspector said, “ and?”
  Barraclough was silent.

  “ Now,” Barber resumed in a cheer-
ful tone, “ will you kindly give me your
address, Mr. Barraclough?”

  The young man, after a short hesita-
tion, handed over a card which Bar-
ber immediately passed to Wilkins.

  “ Verify this,” he ordered.

  He turned again to Barraclough.

  “ While the sergeant is going
through that little formality,” he said,
“it would save your time and mine if
you would just tell me in what circum-
stances you saw Mr. Kyprianos last
night.”

  “ I was probably mistaken,” Barra-
clough answered readily enough now,
“ but I must say—sorry, Kip, if it puts
you in a hole—I must say I thought I
saw him getting out of a taxi in the
Strand—corner of Craven Street—
about nine o’clock last night, but if
Kip says I was mistaken, then 1 was
mistaken, that’s all about it.”

   “ I see.”

  Barber turned to Kyprianos, but the
latter said nothing. He was standing,
with a smile on his handsome face,
looking at the smoke curling up from
the cigarette he held in his hand.

  “ Excuse me, sir,” the constable ad-
dressed Barber, “but this gentleman
hasn't said that he wasn't in the Strand
last night. I heard every word they’ve
said about it.”

  “ The constable is quite right,” Ky-
prianos said then. “ I have neither de-
nied nor asserted the fact.”

  “ Will you do one or the other now,
please?” Barber requested.

  “ Well, no, I don’t think I will,” the
Roumanian replied.

  “ Why not?”

  “ Because, frankly speaking,” the
other said, “ I don't see the relevancy
of my presence or otherwise in the
Strand yesterday to my partner’s death
in the Brandt Building this morning.”

  Barber was spared a remark on this
by the return to the room of Sergeant
Wilkins. The latter nodded to his
superior.

 “ You m&y go now, Mr. Bar-
raclough,” Barber told that young man.

  If I want you I know where to find

you.”

  The tone in which this was said
made it equivalent to an order, and
Barraclough went, though now he
would have been quite* willing to stay.
Barber returned to Kyprianos.

  “ I am quite aware, Mr. Kyprianos/’
he said, “ that the matter may not ap-
pear relevant at first sight, but there is
this to be considered: if I find that you
have been in London during the past
few days when you have told Sergeant
Wilkins that you were in Folkestone,
I may feel inclined to doubt the state-
ment that you arrived in London this
morning, and act accordingly.”

  “ Quite so,” Kyprianos answered
coolly. “ But before you go any fur-
ther may 1 correct you in one par-
ticular? I have never told Sergeant
Wilkins that I spent two days in Folke-
stone.”

  Barber turned to the sergeant, who
was now glaring at the Roumanian.

  “ Well — I’ll — be — d — sorry—
blowed!” Wilkins exclaimed, almost
apoplectic with anger. “ He told me
just that, didn’t he, Crocker?”

  “ I believe so, sar’nt,” the constable
to whom he had appealed answered.

  “ I distinctly remember,” Kyprianos
told Barber, “ telling the sergeant that
I came over from France on Saturday
and that I stayed two nights at the
Queen’s Hotel in Folkestone.”

  “By George! Yes, that’s right,”
Wilkins conceded handsomely after a
THE CLEW OF THE CLOT

635

pause. “ So you did. It’s a mistake I
shouldn’t ’a’ made.”

  “ H’m!” Barber commented. “ So
you ivere in London last evening.-’

  “ I have not said so.”

   “ H’m !”the inspector reflected aloud.
“ Sunday! Now if I remember aright,
the last train to Folkestone on Sunday
is somewhere round about half past
nine. That would get you into Folke-
stone about midnight, eh?”

  “ That is so, I believe,” Kyprianos
agreed with a smile. “There is a
train which arrives at Folkestone Junc-
tion a few minutes after midnight.”

  “ Wilkins,” Barber said to the ser-
geant after a pause, “get on to the
Queen’s Hotel, Folkestone, and find
out, firstly, if Mr. Kyprianos has been
staying there; second, if he had his
meals there, in other words, how much
they saw of him, when he went out and
when he came in and all that sort of
thing. Third, when he left definitely,
and, lastly, above all, get a description
of the Mr. Kyprianos who stayed
there.”

  Wilkins disappeared into the other
room.

  “ That last point was a clever idea,”
Kyprianos commented with a smile.

  “ Now, look here, Mr. Kyprianos,”
the detective inspector said. “ It is
quite clear to me that you are trifling
with me, I don’t know why, but let me
tell you that it’s not a profitable
pastime. However, while the sergeant
is in there we will talk of other
matters. Just tell me how you found
out that Sarkisian was engaged in the
white slave traffic.”

  “ Ah! You know that ?”

  Barber nodded.

  “ In that,” Kyprianos declared, “ I
am out to help you all the way, but I
tell you honestly, inspector, that I will
not give you the slightest help in the
matter of finding out who killed my
late partner.”

 “Oh? Why?”

  “ Because the man deserved to be
killed. I have no strong feelings at all

about the murder as murder—crime
against society and all that sort of stuff.
A greater crime against society is the
one he was engaged in. That is my
opinion at any rate, and I will tell you
all I know. As you probably have
been told, I went to the continent on
a business tour. In a Paris hotel I
came into contact with a man—a
Greek, who discovered in the course of
conversation that I was Sarkisian’s
partner, and took it for granted that
I was in with him in all his affairs.
In fact, I believe that Sarkisian gave
him so to understand. This man is
doing on the continent what Sarkisian
was doing in England, and is the in-
dividual who practically controls the
whole business in France.

  “ At first when he spo^e to me about
it I was somewhat bewildered and
probably showed it, for the man
thought that I was merely—how do
you say?—playing safe, and began to
chaff me. I am not very slow, inspector,
and it occurred to me to humor him.
I asked him how was I to know that
he was who he said he was and that he
wasn’t trying to pump me? In other
words, I played the man who was
afraid of a police trap. He immediately
produced a little brass token which
looked Indian in type.”

  Barber nodded.

  “Ah? You see the significance? At
any rate, I pretended to be satisfied
when I saw it, and he began to talk of
certain details of the organization.
Believe me, inspector, it will need all
the efforts of the police of a dozen
countries to smash that organization.
Why, there are even police officials
mixed up in it—not in England, but
elsewhere—so you see the difficulties.
I let this fellow think that I had been
away from business for some weeks
and that I was rather ‘ out of it ’ for
the moment, and that gave me an ex-
cuse to take notes quite openly of what
he said. So I have a lot of data which
I can let you have—-addresses, changes
of address, and all that sort of thing.

  “ I was lucky, though, in one matter.
This creature complained that Sar-
kisian had not answered his last com-
munication, and I happened to ask
how the fellow had addressed it—to
the office or to Sarkisian’s house. He
told me that he didn't know what the
address was, except that it was a place
in Greenwich. I wrote that down too,
and told the man that that address
had been abandoned. I gave him the
Crouch End address in order to keep
my end up, atid made that an excuse to
get his list of English addresses to see
if it needed revision. I may say that
I'm afraid I rather messed up his list,
so that the police will probably be
getting curious communications from
the dead letter office soon.”

  “ You will let me have all that in-
formation as soon as possible, I hope,”
Barber said.

  “ Yes, as soon as you like after I get
to my rooms.”

  Barber could not help congratulating
himself on the “ leg-up ” that these dis-
coveries would give him with his
superiors, even if he did not succeed
in elucidating the murder case.

  “ That will be very useful,” he said
aloud, “ but I must say that I am not
quite satisfied about you, Mr. Ky-
prianos. I can quite well imagine you
killing Mr. Sarkisian, especially after
getting possession of the knowledge
that you were being associated with his
dirty traffic.”

  “ I can quite well imagine it also,”
Kyprianos replied. “ In fact, I think
1 had almost intended to do it up to
Saturday evening, and—er—ah!—”

  “ Oh ? Why up to Saturday eve-
ning?” Barber asked quickly.

  “ That is my affair, inspector,” was
the suave reply as Kyprianos seemed to
recover from a momentary confusion.
“ Let us put it that I thought that he
would meet with his deserts other-
wise.”

  “ You're a bit of a mystery to me,”
the detective said bluntly. “ In fact,
I’m rather astonished even at your at-

titude with regard to the white slave
traffic. In the part of the world you
come from they aren’t easily moved to
indignation about it, 1 believe.”

  The Greco-Roumanian’s face dark-
ened.

  “ I was mostly brought up in Eng-
land, inspector,” he said curtly. “ Be-
sides, I have special reasons for my at-
titude in the matter.”

   Wilkins came in, and Barber did not
hear what the special reasons were.

   “ What's the report?” he asked.

   The sergeant’s notebook was in his
. hands.

   “ I spoke to the porter on duty at
the Queen's Hotel, Folkestone,” he re-
ported, “also to the receptionist at the
same hotel. Both state that a Mr.
Kyprianos arrived at the hotel in a taxi
which came from the harbor at half
past one on Saturday afternoon, as if
he had come from the one o’clock
Boulogne boat. After engaging his
room he washed, asked for that day’s
London papers, looked through them
quickly, and went out immediately. Did
not come back till dinner. Dined in the
hotel restaurant and went to bed early.
Yesterday, Mr. K. breakfasted in his
room. A Fiat car from a local garage
came for him. Mr. K. drove off in it
and was absent all day until about half
past eleven. Both porter and recep-
tionist are certain to within five min-
utes of the hour, as they happened to
have conic into the hotel a few minutes
before. This morning Mr. K. break-
fasted at the hotel and left at seven-
thirty. Was heard to direct taximan
to Central Station.”

  “And the description?” Barber
asked.

  “It's Mr. K. all right!” Wilkins
declared. “ Tall, handsome, dark,
small black mustache, heavy eyebrows
almost touching over bridge of nose,
scar on back of index finger of right
hand—receptionist noticed that when
he signed the register.”

   Kyprianos held out his right hand in
silence. The scar was there.
THE CLEW OF THE CLOT	837

    /

  Wilkins continued, reading from his
notebook:

  “ Dressed in a brown double-
breasted suit, turned down collar with
pointed ends, dark and light brown
check tie fastened at the ‘ V ’ of the
waistcoat by a plain gold bar safety
brooch.”

  The description was an accurate one
of the man standing before them.

  “ M’m !” the inspector murmured.
“That seems all right.”

  “ It is all right,” Kyprianos averred.
“May be,” Barber replied, “but I
wish you were more frank about your
movements.”

  “ Sorry not to be able to please you,
inspector,” the other said, “ but I can-
not. All that matters, I presume, is
that it is clearly demonstrated that it
was physically impossible for me to
have been here this morning to kill my
partner.”

  “ M—yes,” the detective agreed, “ t
suppose that is all that matters, but I
don’t consider that it has been clearly
demonstrated.”

 “Oh? Why?”

  “If you were able to get to Folke-
stone from London in less time than it
takes a train to do it on one occasion,
what is to prevent you getting from
Folkestone to London in a similar
manner.”

  “ True,” Kyprianos admitted, “ but
that is an ‘if.’”

  “Well, we won't discuss it now,”
Barber told him, “ and if you wish to
leave you may do so, provided you
leave me the keys of any safes there
are.

  “ I have only a sort of tin cash box
thing,” Kyprianos said. “ Sarkisian
has a safe, but it is open. I believe.
However, here is my key ring.”

  “ The premises will be at your dis-
posal some time later in the evening,”
the inspector informed him, “ but I
hope to see you at the Yard before that
with that information you promised
me.”

  After the Roumanian had left Bar-

ber stood looking at the floor for some
minutes.

  “ I say, Wilkins,” he said suddenly,
“ did you let Kyprianos into Sar-
kisian’s room?”

  “ No. Took him into his own office.”

  Barber unfolded the evening paper
lie had bought on his way and skimmed
the meager account of the Brandt
Building murder, which nevertheless
filled several columns of print.

  “ Humph!” he muttered. “ They’ve
even got my name, but not a word
about that! How the dickens did he
know that Sarkisian’s safe was open?”

  Wilkins turned to the open-mouthed
constable.

  “ Did you tell him?” he asked.

  “Never spoke to him,” the man
replied.

  The two detectives looked at each
other

  “Unless,” Barber reflected, “he
met that Ransome girl and she told
him, but—yes—why did he never
mention her—not once?”

CHAPTER XI
Father and Daughter

“T’M off to the Yard,” Barber said
J[ then. “ Here! Take these keys. Go
through all the papers you can
find. You, constable—you look an
intelligent fellow—you give the ser-
geant a hand. All papers that you
don’t understand or that refer to any-
thing outside the business of the firm,
put aside and take to the Yard. And
Wilkins, it’s a case of white slave
traffic, so hurry!”

  “You don’t say!” the sergeant
gasped, and would have asked more,
but his superior was already halfway
down the stairs.

  Barber found his way out through
the front door blocked by the broad
back of the commissionaire who was
deputizing for Buchan. He pushed the
man unceremoniously aside and came
face to face with Rose Bamberger—
an angry and perturbed Rose.
G38

DETECTIVE FICTION WEEKLY

  “Oh! Here he is!” she exclaimed.
“ D’jew know! This guy with the
uniform like a general in the navy is all
bone from the neck up. He wouldn't
lemme go up to see you!”

  “ Indeed!” Barber asked in amuse-
ment, “ and why the desire for a sight
of me? Come! Walk along with
me.”

  They left the commissionaire staring
after them.

  The girl was out of breath from ex-
citement and from running.

  “Gosh! I've had a knock!” she
panted. “ 1 went back to the roomin’
house an’—an’—oh! Millie’s gone!”
Barber stopped on the bottom step.
“Gone? Where?”	^

  “ Wisht I knew! Look at this!’
She handed the detective a piece of
paper.

  “ It was pinned 011 the pillow,” she
told him.

  Barber read:

  Dkar Rose:

  Many, many thanks for all you have
  done for me. You can have all my
  things and the money in the top drawer.
  Good-by.	Mii.uk.

  “Can you beat it?” Rose declared,
almost in tears, “and gee! I’m fond o’
that kid! She’s gone an' killed herself
as sure as shootin’!”

  “ Shootin’ isn’t always dead sure,”
Barber consoled her.

  “ Taxi'!” he called out to the rank
opposite, and, when the taxi came,
bundled the girl into it and ordered:
“ Scotland Yard!”

  He pulled out his notebook as they
drove along.

  “ Now,” he said, “ give me as good
a description of your friend as you-
can.”

  The little New Yorker proved her-
self an observant friend, for when
Barber entered the narrow door under
the archway of Scotland Yard ahead
of her he found no difficulty in recog-
nizing the girl who stood beside the
doorkeeper’s office as Millie Buchan.

  “ Lady to see you, sir,” the door-

keeper announced. “ Been waiting
here for nearly an hour.”

  ‘‘Oh! You’re Inspector Barber!”
the girl exclaimed almost hysterically.
“I’m Millie Buchan! I killed Sarkisian!
Let my father go!”

  “ Millie!” Rose exclaimed as she
saw her friend and heard the state-
ment. “ You didn’t! That’s a darn—”
“Yes, Rose, I did!” Millie Buchan
interrupted. “ That’s why I went out
early this morning.”

  “ Come upstairs, both of you!” Bar-
ber ordered. “ There’s no need to let
all Whitehall and the Embankment
know it!”

  “ Well, for the love o’ Mike!” Rose
half sobbed as she went up the stairs
in the wake of the other two. “ Can
yah beat it? Can yah beat it?”

  Millie Buchan was a tall, not un-
handsome girl whose features bore a
striking resemblance to those of her
handsome father, but her otherwise
pleasing appearance was marred by the
discontented pout of a rather foolish
girl to whom life has not yet given all
that she wants of it.

  Barber, in a room temporaily placed
at his disposal by a Yard man whose
duties for the time being were out of
doors, took down her statement with-
out other comment than a question here
and there whose object was merely to
clear up a detail left obscure. He had
given her the stereotyped warning
beforehand, and when she had placed
her signature at the foot of the fools-
cap page he had filled he said as he
blotted it:

  “ Now, Miss Buchan, I have only a
word to say. If this confession of
yours has been made for the purpose
of obstructing the work of justice
your position is a serious one. There is
still time to tear it up.”

  “ I don't want to tear it up,” the girl
answered stubbornly.

  “Aw! G’wan! Millie! Many’s the
one wouldn’t give yah the chance!”
Rose, sitting forlornly in a corner of
THE CLEW OF THE CLOT

G39

the room, pleaded earnestly. “ Take it
all back! Don’t be a darn fool. Yah
know there ain't a word of truth in it!”
“You won’t?” the inspector asked,
and, receiving no reply, stood up.

“ Very well, Miss Buchan,” he said,

“ I will keep it. In the meantime, you
may go back to your rooms with. Miss
Bamberger. And you, Miss Bamber-
ger, will please keep your eye on this
young lady and see that she gets into
no more mischief.”

  Rose’s stare of amazement was
transformed into a broad grin as she
noted the meaning look in the detec-
tive’s eye.

  “ I getcha!” she answered, nodding
vigorously. “ I getcha! C’mon, Millie.
I’m swore in as deppity sheriff, but
gee! I’m just dyin’ for a feed.”

  “But—but—” the other girl pro-
tested. “Why don’t you arrest me?
I—I—and won’t you let dad go?”

   “ Oh! We don’t do things like that,”
Barber told her quite seriously. “ I
suppose I should really put you in the
cells, but I can’t just let your father
walk out like that, because you signed
this thing. Oh, no! There’s a lot
more to be done before that.”

  “Aw! C’mon, Millie!” Rose cried
with a wink in Barber’s direction.
“ He’ll pull yah in when he’s good an’
ready. Yah must wait till he gets yer
sheets aired for yah. Gosh, goil, yah
don’t want to catch cold ’fore you go
to the chair!”

   Barber could not help smiling at this
curious method of consolation.

   “ I don’t wish to be rude, ladies,” he
said, “ but I’m a busy man these days,
so if Miss Buchan will be good enough
to write down for me the address of
that house in Greenwich I could bear to
see you go.”

  “ I getcha!” was Rose's answer.
“Millie! Write quick.”

   Millie wrote the required address on
the paper Barber placed in front of
her, and they went to the door, Rose
holding the other firmly by the arm.

“ I’ll look after her all right,” Rose

called out. “ Don’t you worry none
whatever, an' say, don’t b’lieve her
neither.”

  When they left, Barber smiled, not
altogether in amusement at the thought
of the relative positions of the two girls
—the one, a stranger to the country
whose life, by her own admission, had
been none too regular and who had
only that day tried to kill another per-
son as well as herself, now mothering
the other, older by a year or two than
herself, a native or at least a denizen
of London, and hitherto supremely
confident of her own ability to steer a
way through the pitfalls of a great city.

  As soon as he judged that they had
left the building the inspector took up
the paper just signed and, holding it in
one hand, went down to Cannon Row
police station and requested that Ser-
geant-major Buchan be brought to him
from the cells. When the commis-
sionaire, looking 110 less spruce than
when at the main entrance to the
Brandt Building, appeared before him.
Barber spoke at once with well-
assumed heartiness.

  “ Well, sergeant-major,” he said,
“ so we’ve got to admit a mistake. You
didn’t kill Sarkisian after all.”

  “ A see!” Buchan replied somewhat
dourly. “A suppose ye got the one
that did it that ye’re talkin’ like that.”

   “Yes, I’ve got a written confession
here,” Barber told him and offered the
paper. “ Would you like to read it ?
It will interest you. I’m sure.”

  “ Onybody A know ?” Buchan asked,
taking the paper hesitatinglv.

   “ Read it.”

  The commissionaire read the first
few lines of the confession and stopped.
The paper fell to the floor while his
hands remained stretched out before
him in the same position as when he
had held it. He stared aghast at the
inspector.

  “ Millie!” he whispered hoarsely.
“ Man, it canna be! She’s gone aw—
d’ye mean ta say she didn’ go away
after all?” he finished lamely.

  “ She signed that paper ten minutes
ago,” Barber assured him.

  “ An’ she says that she killed that
da—that swine?” the other questioned
incredulously.

  “ So she says—as you can see if you
read to the end.”

  The sergeant-major was silent for
some seconds. Then he stooped and
picked up the paper from the floor. He
read it through from beginning and
then began again. Barber turned as if
to look at something on the desk be-
hind him. A ripping, tearing sound
did not make him turn back again.

  “ It’s a damn lie!” the commis-
sionaire cried. “ There’s her confes-
sion for you!"

  Barber turned then.

  “M-m!" he said calmly. “I see!
You’ve torn it up! Why?”

  The sergeant-major looked at him
pityinglv.

  “ Why?" he growled.' “Why? Be-
cause she on’y made\it up to save me!
She’s fond o’ her father still, the bairn;
but it won’t save me. A killed him—
d’ye hear ? A killed him masel’.”

  “ I wish you’d settle it between you,”
Barber told him in the weary tone of
one who was rather uninterested.

  “ What d’ye mean ?”

  “ Oh! Nothing at all!” the detective
said sarcastically. “ I’m just talking
for the sake of talking. As a matter
of fact, Buchan, I’m fed up with all
you would-be murderers. However, if
you want to make a confession to take
the place of this one, I’ll hear it, but
mind you, make it a confession that I
can’t pick any holes in or you’ll be the
victim of the next murder and I’ll be
the candidate for the rope.”

  “ A’ve already made a confession,”
Buchan mumbled.

  “ I heard you,” the inspector said
dryly, “ but I’d like details—whens and
hows and things like that—and also
I’d like to see the revolver.”

  Buchan was silent.

  *‘H-m?" the other went on. “You
can’t make any of that up on the spur

of the moment! Isn’t that it? Suppose
I told you that T don’t believe a word
of your daughter’s confession would
you stick to yours then?” .

  “Is she all right?" the sergeant-
major asked anxiously. “ No harm has
come ta her?”

  “ What has that got to do with it?”
Barber asked. “ You can’t make a
conditional confession, you know,”
“If any harm has come ta her A
don’t care if A do swing for killin’
that dog,” was the commissionaire’s
only reply to this.

  “ I see,” Barber said. “ Now listen
to me—a man who has never married
and knows nothing about it. Your
daughter, I’m practically certain, has
come to no real harm. And, Sergeant-
Major Buchan, if any harm had come
to her, you would be in great part to
blame. You have been too hard on
her. Don’t forget that young people
nowadays can’t be treated as we were
in our young days.”

  “ A know it! A know it now!’’

  “It was only the other day that an
old clergyman—^ man who had never
married,” Barber went on, “ said to
me: the young girls nowadays are like
the young fillies that have been brought
in from the hills for the first time.
You must ride them gently. Their
mouths are soft and their backs are
ticklish. Do you get me?”

  “ Aye!”

  “ I’m telling you all this,” the in-
spector went on, “ because it is only a
matter of minutes before you are re-
leased. Go and see your daughter. Her
address is on that paper you have tom
up. Go and see her, and for Heaven’s
sake, don’t preach at her.”

  “Ma God, man!”-the sergeant-ma-
jor exclaimed. “ D’ye think A need
you ta tell me that? A know it! A
know it all!”

  “ All right! And by the way, there’s
a girl living with your daughter who
pulled her out of a very bad hole. You
may have seen her before, and you
may not approve of her, but she is—”

  “ If she saved ma bairn from—well,
ye understan’—I’ll look after her,
dinna worry.”

  The sergeant-major in his emotion
was dropping deeper and deeper into
his native Doric.

  “ Right! I’ll go and arrange mat-
ters here for your release.”

  “ Then ye don’t believe,” the com-
missionaire asked, “ that either of us
killed Sarkisian? Is that it?”

  “ Oh! Lord! Don’t ask me what I
believe!” Barber snapped, and left the
room.

  On his way to his bachelor rooms
the inspector that evening laughed at
himself crookedly.

  “By Jove!” he said to himself.
“ You’re taking on a lot, son—advising
foolish girls and intolerant fathers and
what not! H’mph! Ought to have been
a bloomin’ parson!”

CHAPTER XII

Three Statements

BEFORE leaving for his home Bar-
ber had arranged that the house
at Greenwich should be watched
and that anybody coming away from
it should be detained for inquiries. The
next morning’s experiences, however,
drove out of his head all thought of
asking what had resulted from these
measures.

  When he arrived at Scotland Yard
well ahead of his usual time for begin-
ning work he found that no fewer
than three visitors already awaited his
coming. He gave orders that they were
to be admitted in the order of their
arrival. The first was a lady of ma-
ture years dressed in a fashion which
identified her calling at once.

  “ Your name, please?” Barber inter-
rogated when she was shown into his
temporary office.

  “ Sarah Tckson,” she replied.

  “ I believe you have some informa-
tion for me.”

  “ That’s as may be, sir,” Mrs. Hick-
son said, still standing,

  5 D

   “ Won’t you sit down ?” the inspec-
tor invited.

   “ Thank you, sir,” the lady replied,
obeying. “ Yes, sir. I’m Sarah 'Ick-
son, an’ I’m a cleaner—a office cleaner.
I cleans out seven offices at that there
Brandt Building.”

  “Yes?”

  “ Well, sir, Monday mornin’ I come
to the Brandt Building for me money
from some o' them offices—I should
get it Sat'days, but there’s some o’
them gawf players as doesn’t come to
their offices o’ Saturdays an’ makes me
lose my time Monday mornin’s cornin’
for it.”

  “Yes? And you came yesterday
morning?”

  “Yes, sir, as ever was! I was on
the fourth floor—w’ich I may say is
reely the fifth, seein’ as they call one
o’ them a mezzareen floor—yes, sir, I
was on the fourth floor an’ all of a
sudden I ’ears that young lady, Miss
Ransome, screamin’ fit to wake the
dead. Next thing I ’ears is that that
there Mr. Sark-issy-ann is murdered.”
She paused to let this sink in.

   “ Yes,” Barber asked, “ and perhaps
you had seen somebody going into his
office before that? No?”

   “ No, sir, ’twasn’t that. It’s about
Sat’day I was wantin’ to see you
about.”

  “Well? What about Saturday?”

  “ Sat'day I comes for my money,
too,” Mrs. Hickson explained, “ an’
’fore I goes into Mr. Sark-issy-ann’s
office I could 'ear ’im an’ the young
lady ’avin’ a set-to.”

  “ What young lady ?” Barber asked.
“ The young lady as types for him
—'er name’s Ransome—Miss Ran-
some.”

  “ What were they quarrelling
about ?”

   “ Not knowin’, sir, I couldn’t say,”
Mrs. Hickson replied. “ She’s a good
girl that, as treats a lady as a lady
should, not like some, an’ I wouldn’t
like anythink I say to do ’er any ’arm,
but I 'ad to come, seein' as the papers
642

DETECTIVE FICTION WEEKLY

says this mornin’ as that head sergeant-
major 'as been let off an’—”

  “ Yes, yes, Mrs. Hickson,” the in-
spector interrupted, “ but didn’t you
hear anything of this quarrel?”

  “ Well, sir,” the charlady said, “ I
did ’ear some of it. The young lady
was sorter ’alf cryin’ like, an’ she said
as clear as she would kill ’im for
somethink ’e done. Then I knocked at
the door an’ went in. That there
Sark-issy-ann made off inter ’is own
office an’ the young lady sorter pur-
tended she was blowin’ ’er nose. She
was red in the face an’ short-like with
me as alwis ’as a pleasant word for
all of ’em. She just gives me my
money an’ says ‘ good mornin’ ’ an’
begins ’ammerin’ that typewritin’ ma-
chine thing that loud so’s you couldn’t
’ear yourself speak. So I come out.”
“ And you know no more about it ?”
Barber asked.

  “Not if you was to torcher me!”
was the lady’s earnest reply.

  “ At what time did this quarrel take
place?”

  “ Time ? It must ’a’ bin a couple o’
minnits to one ’cause when I was corn-
in’ down the buildin’ steps I met Anne
Skinner as lives in our street an’ she’s
like a clock herself, she is, an’ alwis
comes outer ’er business place next
door on the tick o’ one an’ on the tick
o’ six. I says to ’er, Anne, I says,
you’re just the—”

  “ I see, I see,” the detective inter-
rupted hurriedly, “so if I want you I
suppose I can always find you through
the Brandt Building people.”

  “ Yes, sir, an’ every p’liceman from
Covent Garding to Aldgate Pump—
what was knocked down the other day
—knows Sarah ’Ickson.”

  “ Favorably, I hope,” Barber smiled.
“ Oh, me an’ them boys alwis passes
the time o' day, jokin’like,” Sarah
laughed. “ They’re good lads. Times
is, p’raps, when I do forget me sorrers
a bit, but the police never worrits me
knowin’ as I’ve "ad troubles—more’n
me fair share—”

  Barber had no inclination to listen
to a catalogue of the charwoman’s
troubles. His experience as a police-
man had taught him that the list was
likely to be prolonged, so he interrupted
with a question:

  “ When you were at the Brandt
Building on Monday morning did you
hear anything like a shot before the
girl screamed?”

  “ Now, I might ’ave, sir, an’ I might
not,” Mrs. Hickson replied, “ an’ if I
did as like as not I’d never ’a’ noticed
it with the busses an’ things goin’ past
an’ the lifts goin’ up an’ down an’ their
gates openin’ an’ shuttin’. It’s a very
noisy time o’ the day in them big office
buildin’s, sir. I was just thinkin’ me-
self, sir, as—”

  But the detective had no time for
the lady’s theories.

  “ Have you ever heard any rumors
about Sarkisian himself?” he asked
nevertheless.

  Mrs. Hickson sniffed.

  “ Rumors!” she repeated. “ There’s
them as’ll tell you he was the worst as
ever was. Me an’ Anne Skinner—’er
as I was tellin’ yer about—was talkin’
about ’im the other day. She says
’e’s a dopeseller an’ ’Eaven knows
what.”

  “ What exactly do you mean by that,
Mrs. Hickson?”

  “ Oh! Things a respectable woman
can’t talk about to a man,” Airs. Hick-
son replied virtuously, “ it’s that ’or-
rible, but it’s the talk of our street.”
“ How is that ? Surely your street
is a long way from the Brandt Build-
ing?”

  “ Yes, indeed, but there’s Emily ’Aw-
kins, an’ Liza Mullins, an’ Jane ’Ogg
an’ me as is cleaners at the Brandt, an’
we talk things over like.”

  “ I seve, and what has started this
talk, do you know?”

  “ Mpf! Ain’t we got eyes an’ ears?
It was ’im as led that pore head ser-
geant-major's daughter into bad ways,
an’ everybody knows as she wasn’t the
only one.”
TIIE CLEW OF THE CLOT

643

  Finding that there was nothing more
to be extracted from the charwoman
except the gossip of her street he es-
corted her courteously to the door—
an honor which her contented expres-
sion showed she appreciated.

  On her departure there entered a
pasty, pimply youth with an affected
voice and laudably careful enunciation
who gave his name as Albert Sweeter.
He stood for a moment in front of
Barber twirling his bowler hat round
and round in front of him.

  “ Well, Mr. Sweeter?” the inspector
invited.

  “ I came to say,” Sweeter began
after a polite cough, “ that 1 believe I
—that this ’ere—er—this Mr. Sarki-
sian was killed by Mr. Erskine of
the Anglo-Uruguayan Trading Com-
pany.”

  “Indeed?” the inspector exclaimed,
and then thought. “ By Jove, I heard
that name somewhere yesterday.”

  “ Yes.”

  “ What are your grounds for that
belief ?”

  “ I ’eard—er—’eard Mr. Erskine
threatening to blow the ’ead off Sar-
kisian.”

  “ When was that?”

  “ Saturday morning, ten o’clock, on
the landing above Sarkisian’s floor.”
“Yes?”

  “ Yes.”

  “ Oh, for Heaven’s sake, spit it out,”
Barber exclaimed irritably, “ I can’t
waste time squeezing it out. If you
have a statement to make, make it.
What cxactly did you hear? How did
you come to hear it? Go on!”

  “ I—I—” the other went on, with less
assurance, “ I am an invoice clerk at
Osborne & Clark’s, an’—and on Sat’-
day morning I ’appened to be passing
along the corridor from my room to
the manager’s office and Mr. Erskine
and Sarkisian was—were standing on
the landing outside Mr. Erskine's
door, and Mr. Erskine was very angry,
and I heard him say to Sarkisian that
if he found him interfering with any

of his young people any more he would
blow the top of ’is ’ead off o’—off
him!”

  “ I see! Can vou swear that ?”

  “ Yes.”

  “ Good! Write your name and ad-
dress on that pad, and if I need you
I will send for you.”

  Sweeter wrote as directed, and hes-
itated before going to the door.

  “ Well ?” Barber asked, “ got some-
thing else to say?”

  “ Will there be a reward,” the other
asked, “ if Erskine did do it?”

  “ I don’t know whether there will or
not,” Barber snapped. “ Good morn-
ing!”

  He rang a bell and the third visitor
was shown in. This was a little spick
and span elderly man with gray hair
and gray toothbrush mustache, and the
detective was not surprised when he
announced himself, in staccato tones, to
be Major Heald-Hawkins, late of the
Rutland Light Infantry.

  “Yes, major?” Barber asked after
waving him to the easy chair. “ What
can I do for you?”

  “ Nothing, sir, nothing,” the major
barked, “ but perhaps I can do some-
thing for you, help you to discover the
murderer of that scamp Sarkisian.”

  “ You didn’t hear anybody threaten
him on Saturday, I hope?” Barber
asked involuntarily.

  “Eh ? What ? Gad, no, sir, but I’ve
threatened to horsewhip him myself,
sir.”

 “Oh? When?”

  “What does it matter?” Major
Heald-Hawkins asked brusquely.
“ Never had a chance to do it, sorry to
say! But we can’t have murder, we
can’t have murder. Here! What do
you think of this?”

  Wrhile he was speaking the major
had a hand in his breast pocket, and he
now jerked it forward toward Barber
so suddenly that the latter almost ex-
pected to see it grip a pistol. It held,
however, nothing more dangerous than
a foolscap envelope. The detective took
644

DETECTIVE FICTION WEEKLY

it and drew from it its inclosure. Half
a dozen pieces of torn paper fell onto
the desk. Accompanying these was a
typed slip whose characters showed it
to be a carbon copy.

  “ By Jove!” Barber exclaimed when
he had read this, “ this is interest-
ing. I am very glad you brought this
along.”

  “Thought so! Thought so!” the
major jerked out. “ Didn’t want to
bring it, but—hum!—we can’t have
murder, sir, we can’t have m—”

  “ We’ve had it!” the detective could
not help interrupting.

  “Yes, by gad, we've had it!” the
other agreed.

  “ How did you get this?” Barber
asked.

  “ Came by post last night—ten
o’clock delivery!”

  “ Hum!” Barber murmured as he
examined the envelope. “ Typewritten
address. A poor hand at using a type-
writer. Misspell one word. I happen to
know that that particular Montagu
Crescent of yours, major, hasn’t an
* e ' at the end.”

  “ Ouite right, sir, quite right! It
hasn’t.”

  “ Half a minute, major!” Barber ex-
claimed suddenly and darted from the
room. “ I’ll be back in a—”

  When he came back he held in his
hand the private ledger found in Sar-
kisian’s safe.

  “ By gad, sir, I know that book!”
the major coughed and flushed to the
roots of his hair.

  Barber was paying no attention to
him, but was rapidly turning over the
pages.

  “Here it is!” said he. “Major
O. L. Heald-Hawkins, iC Montague
Crescent, with an ‘ e.’ This is where
he got it all right!”

  “ I never thought anything else,” the
major commented in his curious bark-
ing voice. “ But who’s he?”

  “ That’s the question!” Barber
nodded. “First thing I am going to
do is try to find the typewriter.”

  “ That’s your lookout! Now, do you
want me to leave that with you?”

  “ If you don’t mind, major,” the de-
tective said. “ It will be show’n to no-
body outside one or two people in this
building.”

  “ Very good. Don’t want half the
world to know I was a damn fool!”

  “ So you were one of Sarkisian’s vic-
tims? How did you get to know he
lent money? He wasn’t a registered
money lender.”

  “ I know that, sir, I know that!” the
major barked. “ That's what took
me in. Johnny Corseliis introduced
me—know Corseliis? Shot himself
two months ago. That rogue’s fault!
I took a loan from the scoundrel—
paid it back three times over—still
owing all of it! I was a damn fool,
sir, a damn fool!”

  “Well, major,” Barber said rising
from his seat, “ I can imagine worse
things in your bedtime mail than your
own promissory note torn up and a
note informing you that you’re free.”

CHAPTER XIII
Another Would-be Murderer

INSPECTOR BARBER had just got
rid of his third visitor and was try-
ing to concentrate on the new
aspects of the case presented to him by
the three statements he had received
when a telephone message from his
own division caused him to give a new
direction to his thoughts. He had in-
tended to devote the rest of the morn-
ing to the examination of the papers
found in Sarkisian’s office and house,
with the special object of comparing
the information he might derive from
them with some of the material fur-
nished by Kyprianos in a typed state-
ment handed in to Scotland Yard on
the preceding evening after his own de-
parture for his home. He anticipated,
from a casual look at this statement,
that its value was great—if not for the
purpose of discovering the murderer of
the Armenian, then undoubtedly as a
THE CLEW OF THE CLOT

645

pointer in the direction to be taken by
the police in their attempt to unearth
the secrets of the unholy traffic of
which the murdered man seemed to
have been one of the principals.

  The inspector was, however, not to
be allowed to examine the papers just
yet;.

  “ We’ve got a young fellow here,”
was the report from the “ E ” Division,
“ who was snooping around on Sar-
kisian’s floor in suspicious circum-
stances. Perhaps you’d better see him.
Shall we send him along, or will you
come here?”

  “I’ll go there,” Barber replied and
reached for his hat.

  At the police station he found the
prisoner to be a young fellow of about
twenty-five, with nothing particularly
striking about him to distinguish him
from scores of others of his class in
London. The detective sergeant who,
during Barber’s absence, was taking
charge of criminal investigation usually
conducted by his superior, gave the in-
spector a short summary of what he
knew. Now that Sarkisian’s papers
had been removed a policeman was no
longer in possession of the office, but a
plainclothes man had been instructed
to keep an unobtrusive eye on all com-
ings and goings. Nobody of interest
had visited the office on the previous
evening after Sergeant Wilkins’s de-
parture. Two employees of the firm
of Auguste Cherre, the chemical
cleaners, acting, it appeared, on the in-
structions of Kyprianos, had removed
the carpet from Sarkisian’s room to be
cleaned.

  While they were so engaged the
young man now detained had been
observed peering into the office, but no
attention had been paid to him, as it
was thought that he was employed by
one of the firms in the building and
had acted from a natural curiosity to
see what was happening on the scene
of so recent a murder. This impres-
sion had been strengthened by the fact
that he had gone out of the building,

not by the main entrance, but by one of
the side doors, as if very familiar with
the premises. This morning, however,
he had reappeared and was hanging
about the landing on which the offices
of Sarkisian & Company were situated.
The plainclothes constable—the same
who had been on duty the previous eve-
ning—had therefore asked him to ex-
plain his presence, and on his refusal
had invited him to accompany him to
the police station. The young man
had made no protest, but now refused
to say anything. He had been searched,
and, besides a small sum of money and
a letter signed “ Millie,” was found to
be in possession of a cheap Belgian re-
volver of .32 caliber, fully loaded, for
which no permit had been issued.

   “ Let’s see that letter!” Barber in-
terrupted the recital.

  The detective sergeant handed over
a rather dog-eared envelope addressed
to “ Mr. Charles Molesby ” at an ad-
dress in Streatham. The inspector
read the letter.

  “ Humph!” he said. “ She got this
out of a penny novelette.”

   “ Just what I thought.” the sergeant
laughed. “ especially that bit about not
being ‘ fitted for a humdrum and
prosaic suburban existence.’ Who is
she, I wonder.”

  “ Oh! I think I know who she is,”
Barber told him. “ In fact I’m sure
she’s Millie Buchan, that sergeant-
major’s daughter.”

  “ Ah! That explains it!” the other
exclaimed. “By gum! I wonder—”
“Explains what?” the inspector in-
terrupted.

  “Oh! Yes! I didn’t tell you,” the
sergeant replied. “When the con-
stable was conducting this young
what’s-his-name—Molesby—out of the
building one of the commissionaires,
who is assistant porter, told him that
he had seen him in and out of the build-
ing quite a lot lately. He used to talk
with Buchan at first, but recently he
used to come in by a side door as if he
wanted to avoid him. He was there
646

DETECTIVE FICTION WEEKLY

on Friday evening, Saturday morning
and—the commissionaire thinks, but is
not absolutely certain—on Monday
morning, but not till after Sarkisian
had been found.”

  “ I think I’d better see him,” Barber
decided.

  When Molesby was brought in the
inspector noted in him an entire ab-
sence of curiosity—a total indifference
to all that went on around him; he
slouched into the room as if it were too
much trouble to straighten up.

  “Your name is Charles Molesby?”
the inspector asked.

  “ M’m! Charles Molesby.” The tone
was neither listless nor dull, just that
of a normal statement of a fact which
had no great personal interest for the
speaker. Barber decided to make an
effort to change that. In the man’s
present frame of mind there was no
hope of getting any information from
him.

  “ Curious that I should come across
you,” the inspector said casually, “ so
soon after seeing Millie Buchan.”
Barber thought for a moment that
his ruse had failed, but it was fully
successful.

  “Millie Buchan?” Molesby echoed.
“Millie Buchan?”

  Then he faced the inspector with
bared teeth.

  “Where is she?” he ground out.
“ Tell me or I'll put a bullet through
you.”

  He fumbled at his side pocket and
then grinned with a more natural ex-
pression.

  “They’ve taken.it away. I forgot,”
he said, and then, after a pause, “ I’m
a bit mad, I think.”

  He shook himself and straightened
his shoulders.

  Barber said nothing.

  “ Sorry,” the young man went on,
quite normally. “I forgot where I
was. Who are you?”

  “ I am Detective Inspector Barber.”
“ Was I dreaming, or did you say
something about Millie Buchan?”

  “You were not dreaming,” Barber
replied. “ I said that I had just been
talking to her.”

  “No!” All indifference was gone
now. Excitement had taken its place.
“Where? Then she didn’t go away.
Then, that swine—”

  “ There seems to be something
monotonous about that expression as
applied to a certain dead Armenian,”
Barber interrupted, and went on sharp-
ly: “ Now, young man, that you have
come more or less to your senses, per-
haps you would explain why you have
been hanging round the Brandt Build-
ing recently.”

  “ If you really want to know,” the
other said calmly, “ I wanted at first to
kill Sarkisian, because I believe he was
responsible for turning Mill—Miss
Buchan’s head—taking her out to
dances and all that sort of thing, and
introducing her to a lot of flashy devils
that live on their wits in the West End.
If he hadn’t given her a taste of that
life she’d never have thought of going
away to America with—but you say
she didn’t go?”

  “ No, she didn't go,” the inspector
said, and held up his hand as Molesby
was about to resume, “ but I’m afraid
your explanation is incomplete. It is
all right as far as Friday, Saturday
and Monday are concerned, but to-day,
at any rate,if not sooner,you must have
known that Sarkisian was dead. Why
were you there to-day ?”

  “ I wanted to find that typist girl,”
was the reply. “ I thought she might
know exactly where Millie had gone.”
“ I see. Now tell me what you were
doing yesterday morning—say—from
eight till nine-thirty?”

  “Yesterday?” Molesby answered
vaguely. “ I think I left my digs in
Streatham at eight, or perhaps a few
minutes later, and came straight up to
the Brandt Building. I suppose it
took me over an hour. I came by bus.
I wanted to catch that—well, that Sar-
kisian coming in, and if he didn’t tell
me where Millie was, to shoot him
THE CLEW OF THE CLOT

647

there on the steps and then give myself
up to the police.”

  “You knew Sarkisian, then?”

  “ I had seen him. Millie’s father
pointed him out. If I’d been able to
get a revolver in time I’d have killed
him weeks ago, I think.”

  “ Indeed ? And what about yester-
day? What happened?”

  “ I hung about, but I didn’t see him.
Then I saw the typist calling a police-
man and the policeman went in. A few
minutes later a commissionaire told me
that Sarkisian had already been shot.”
“ You’re sure you didn’t shoot him
yourself?” Barber asked dryly, “in a
dream or something like that ?”

  “ I’m sure enough of that. I didn’t
dream much when I was in that
quarter, I can tell you.”

  “ How is it that you didn’t get a
chance of shooting him—say—on
Saturday? You would have had more
time then in the afternoon when your
own work was finished, but perhaps
you hadn’t the revolver then ?”

  “ Oh! Yes!” Molesby answered in a
matter-of-fact tone, “ I got the re-
volver on Thursday. I waited for the
blighter nearly all day on Saturday,
but it was no good. I thought I had
got him once, but just as I was going
to go up t ohim a young chap who
was waiting in a car got there before
me and shook his fist in his face
and then went back with him into the
building.

  “ Sarkisian didn’t come out again
with the young fellow, and I waited on.
The main entrance was closed about
two, I suppose, and I was hungry by
then, so I went away for a bit to eat.
He must have gone out by one of the
side doors when I was there, or else he
left while I was away, because though
I waited a long time after I had
eaten I didn’t see him. The only one
I saw was that young partner of his
ringing at the main entrance to get in.”
“ What ?” Barber exclaimed.
“ You’re sure of that? What time was
it then?”

  “ About five, I should say,” was the
reply, “ and I’m sure it was Sarkisian's
partner.”

  “Hum!” the inspector reflected in
silence. “ He must have spent the
week-end in a car, that lad! I wonder
what he was doing?”

  Barber walked over to the window
and looked out.

  “ I wish I knew if that early train
business is faked somehow,” he said to
himself, and then turned round sud-
denly.

  “ There is absolutely no doubt in
your mind,” he said to Molesby, “ that
the man you saw was Kyprianos—not
another foreigner very like him? They
are often alike to us, you know, these
southerners.”

  “ I don’t know his name,” Molesby
replied, “ but I'm sure it was the part-
ner chap. If it wasn’t, it was his twin
brother. I’ve seen him several times.”
“ It wouldn’t be a bad idea,” Barber
told himself, “ to inquire into his fami-
ly history. Seems far-fetched, but by
Jove it’s not impossible! Twin leaves
Folkestone. Man himself in London
all the time. Makes an appointment to
meet his partner early. Kills him after
a quarrel about that business. Arrives
later as the man who had traveled up
to London from Folkestone. Oh!
Hang! Theories!”

  He turned to the detective sergeant.
“ We must hold our friend here till
all the necessary inquiries have been
made,” he directed, “you can charge
him for the present with carrying fire-
arms. Then make the routine inquiries.
By the way, Molesby, how do you come
to have so much leisure?”

  “ I took my holiday,” the young fel-
low replied glumly, “ but, I say, why
are you keeping me ? I want to see—”
“ I don’t care a hang who or what
you want to see,” Barber snapped.
“ You don’t seem to realize that you
are liable to twenty years’ penal servi-
tude for being in possession of firearms
with intent to endanger life. Think
that over!”

   With which he left the police station
with a rush.

CHAPTER XIV
Gilmartin Takes a Hand

BACK in the little room in Scot-
land Yard Barber found Sergeant
Wilkins awaiting him with a pile
of papers on the desk topped by a
tear-off calendar about eight inches
square. The sergeant was replacing
the telephone receiver on its hook when
his superior entered.

   “ I was just making a little inquiry
on my own,” Wilkins explained.

   “ What about ?”

  “Oh! Nothing much,” Wilkins re-
plied. “ You see that calendar? Notice
that Saturday’s and Sunday’s leaves
are not torn off?”

  “Yes! Well? What about it? I
should think that the secretary-typist
had something else to think of yester-
day morning beside tearing off calen-
dar leaves. Those funny hieroglyphics
on the top page seem more interesting
to me. I wonder what language they're
in.”

  “ They’re notes in Armenian, the
typist says,” Wilkins replied. “ But
the point is this, the girl never does
tear off the leaves. I phoned her up
to ask. She’s working there as usual
to-day.”

   “ P'or Heaven’s sake, Wilkins,” Bar-
ber exclaimed impatiently, “ what does
it matter who tore them off?”

   “ I dunno, sir,” Wilkins said hum-
bly, “ but you always say details is im-
portant. I took the calendar along be-
cause of the notes on it and then I
noticed the date. It seems Sarkisian
had the habit of tearing off the leaf in
the mornings almost as soon as he ar-
rived. In fact, he gave strict orders
to the Ransome girl not to touch that
calendar because the notes on it were
reminders. It just shows that he didn’t
have time to tear it off yesterday.”

   “ Well?”

  “ Then whoever killed him either

came in with him or was waiting for
him,” Wilkins finished.

  “ M-m! That’s so,” Barber ad-
mitted, “ but it doesn’t tell us anything
we didn’t know. There was no evi-
dence of a struggle in that room any-
way. Come on! Let’s see what’s in
this heap!”

   Wilkins drew his chair up, but he
shook his head and looked disap-
pointed.

   While the two detectives were busily
engaged on the papers inquiries were
still being made by a small army of
plainclothes men into the movements
of all the potential suspects on the pre-
ceding morning and reports were com-
ing in by telephone every few minutes.
One man to whom Barber had given
the task of tracing those persons whose
names figured in Sarkisian’s ledger re-
ported at intervals his success in several
cases and added that each person traced
had, when questioned diplomatically,
admitted the fact that he had received
his promissory note by post on the pre-
vious evening. In each case the note
was torn in four or eight pieces and
accompanied by a note worded exactly
as had been that of Major Heald-
Hawkins; some were carbon copies and
one or two were top copies identical
with the carbons.

   The papers, Barber thought as he
examined them, seemed to give no clew
to a possible murderer, what ever might
be their value in other respects. They
revealed details of an organization
which horrified even the hardened
policemen. Accounts there wrere which
told a tale needing no explanation, and
the strict conscience of the sergeant
was stirred to its depths as he saw the
sums under the headings of “ Enter-
tainment,” “ Fares ” and such like. He
swore aloud when he read minute de-
scriptions of the physical and moral
characteristics of what was euphemis-
tically termed “ Stock.”

   “ God! Inspector!” he exclaimed at
one point, “ I haven’t been a ‘ busy ’
all these years without knowing that
THE CLEW OF THE CLOT

649

there was this damned traffic, but I
never thought it was as bad as this.”
“ Neither did I,” Barber replied,
“ and I’m all the more worried. An
organization like that is bound to have
got the wind up, especially as that old
Schaffer -woman has got awray—and
dammit, 'we've been slow. The trans-
lation of some of these foreign papers
will also take time.”

  “ Oh! I dunno,” the shrewd Wilkins
said to this, “ that needn't hold us up.
Besides, a big thing like this is easier
to get at than a small gang that can
scatter in a brace of shakes.”

  “ I hope so,” Barber murmured
gloomily, busy underlining extracts for
copying.

  They were still thus engaged half
an hour later when the door opened
without warning to admit a tall figure
dressed in the cutaway coat and striped
trousers of morning wear now so
rarely seen save on occasions of great
ceremony. He held in his hand a fop
hat which reflected the light from the
window' thus revealing a curly black
head of hair in which a few streaks of
gray appeared. The mustache was of
the same color as the hair and had the
curling ends more popular in a former
day.

  “ Hello, Barber,” he greeted the in-
spector, “ you’re looking worried.”

  “ I’m more than that, chief.” was the
reply as Barber rose to his feet, “ I’m
rattled.”

  “That’s bad,” Chief Inspector Lau-
rence Gilmartin—for it was he—com-
mented, “ and I thought you were such
an unrattleable beggar!”

  He turned round toward Wilkins
w7ho was standing rigidly erect.

  “ You’re Sergeant Wrilkins, I sup-
pose,” he said, “ I think we’ve met be-
fore somewhere, haven’t we?”

  “ You an’ me was at Peel House to-
gether, sir,” the sergeant answered.

  “ By Jove, so we w-ere!” the big man
agreed. “ Then you’re the Wilkins
that helped Peters to get Pete the
Slinger in your first year on a beat.”

   “ Yes, sir,” Wilkins replied, his face
showing all the pleasure he felt at this
example of the memory of his one
great feat on the part of one of the
w'ell-known men at the “ Yard ”—a
man who, moreover, had outdistanced
all his contemporaries in the race for
promotion while exciting no jealousy
anywhere.

  “I’ve just been seeing off the Emir
of Daghestan,” the chief inspector now
told his juniors, “ hence the festive at-
tire. I thought, however, I’d look you
up, Barber, before going home. The
assistant commissioner tells me that
your case is more complicated than it
looked at first.”

  “ It’s even more complicated than
that,” Barber told him. “ Since I re-
ported to him there's been quite a lot
of new happenings. I’m not comfort-
able about it, chief, I don’t mind telling
you.”

  “ Oh!” Gilmartin sat down on the
edge of the desk. “ Give me an out-
line of things.”

  The big Irishman listened attentive-
ly to the account which Barber made
as concise as possible, while sacrificing
nothing to clarity. He nodded approv-
ingly when the inspector somewhat dif-
fidently told him of his action with re-
gard to Rose, Bamberger.

  “Quite right!” he murmured.
“Quite right!”

  “ We-e-ell!” he said when the inspec-
tor had finished. “ It certainly does
seem involved, all that, but it may be
simpler than you think. Personally, I
don’t see how you could have done
any more with the means at your dis-
posal. We’ll have to get more people
on to this. It’s a Number One case,
and smaller things can wait if neces-
sary.”

  He got down from the desk and took
the chair which Wilkins had vacated.
He pulled toward him a double sheet of
foolscap.

  “ Nowr, let’s see!” he went on. “ The
first thing to do is to get everything
clear and tidy in our minds. I’m afraid
650

DETECTIVE FICTION WEEKLY

 I have a simple mind and I have to
 put everything down on paper. It
 looks like a waste of time, but it isn’t
 —in my case. This is how I do it
 when I have a lot of suspects!”

 As he spoke he divided the foolscap
 into four columns.

 “ I make a thing like this,” he con-
 tinued, “ the first column being for the
 name of the suspect, the second for
 the points against him, the third for
 the things favorable to him, and the
 fourth for any odd remarks that may
 occur to me. Who’s the first? Ser-
 geant-Major Buchan? Down he goes.”

(i)	BUCHAN—

Against

 (a)	Sufficient motive.

 (b)	Admits planning to kill S.

 (c)	Had opportunity if S. arrived
 office before 8.40 a.m.

 (d)	Words to dying man overheard
 by girl.

 (e)	Removal of ledger page, and
 measures to insure being alone in office.

For

 (a)	Previous good character.

 (b)	Motive would imply quarrel;
 not shot from behind.

 (c)	No firearm found.

 (d)	Animosity sufficient explana-
 tion of words. Not natural, would say
 them if had already had it out with S.

 (e)	If killed S. why wait to get
 page then?

Remarks

 (a)	Question Erskine closely about
 time.

 (b)	Find exact hour of S.’s arrival
 at office.

 Query: Did Buchan send out prom,
 notes ?

 “ That’s the sort of thing,” Gilmar-
 tin remarked, “ that you’ll always run
 up against: a lot of presumptive evi-
 dence, enough, perhaps, to make a
 prima facie case, but not enough to
 convince a common jury. On the other
 hand no really positive evidence in the
 man’s favor.”

 “ Unfortunately,” Barber replied,
 “ it’s not up to the accused to prove
 innocence; it’s our business to prove
 him guilty.”

 “ Fortunately!” the chief inspector
 corrected. “ Fortunately English law
 is like that.”

 “ Why do you put that bit about the
 promissory notes, chief?” his junior
 asked.

 “ Just as a reminder that specimens
 of the work of all the typewriters in
 the Brandt Building must be taken.”

 “ I hadn’t thought of that,” Barber
 admitted.

 “ Make a note of it then,” Gilmartin
 directed. “ Who’s next on the list of
 suspects ?”

 “ The list is a long one,” the inspec-
 tor said. “ I suppose we can take
 Kyprianos next?”

 “ All right! We’ll take Kyprianos.”

(2)	KYPRIANOS-

A gainst

 (a)	See (a) Buchan.

 (b)	Movements suspicious during
 entire week-end.

 (c)	Knew safe was open without
 entering the room.

For

 (a)	See (b) Buchan.

 (b)	Alibi.

Remarks

 (a)	Visit Queen’s Hotel, verify
 alibi.

 ( b ) Find car used by K.—probably
 hired. If possible find mileage covered.

 Ouerv: Did K. send promissory
 notes ?

 “ Yes,” Barber commented on this.
 “ Kyprianos strikes me as being a more
 likely person to have sent those prom-
 issory notes.”

 “ Perhaps,” Gilmartin admitted,
 “ that’s why I queried. Let’s see the
 wording of the typed message that was
 sent with them.” -

 The sergeant turned up the note in
 a file and placed it before the chief
 inspector.
THE CLEW OF THE CLOT

651

 “ M-m! Yes,” the latter said. “ It’s
 more like the phraseology of an edu-
 cated man, though you never know
 with these Scotsmen. The most un-
 couth of them have a knack of turning
 a neat phrase on paper.”

 “ There’s a typed thing here from
 Kyprianos, chief,” Barber suggested.
 “You know, the list of addresses and
 things he found out in Paris.”

 “ I know,” Gilmartin said, “ but
 we’ll leave that to the specialist con-
 cerned. Besides, if it turns out to be
 the office typewriter, it doesn’t help us
 much, as anybody who had access to
 it could have typed the note. I can
 think of several who might have done
 it. No, let’s get on with this tabular
 thing.”

 In silence Gilmartin wrote on from
 his memory of Barber's account. When
 he had finished it was evident that he
 had missed no important point of the
 narrative. The sheet of paper which
 he handed over to Barber, including the
 “ Buchan ” and “ Kyprianos ” tabula-
 tions, followed:

(3)	ERSKINE—

Against

 threat.

  “ A most unsatisfactory document in
some ways,” Gilmartin said, handing
over the foolscap sheet to Barber.

  Barber read it through.

“ Very,” he answered ruefully.

  “ Still,” the chief inspector went on
with a smile, “ it keeps one’s mind from
wandering.”

  “ Why,” Barber asked, “ do you
want to know the height of the
women ?”

  “ That is to be taken in conjunction
with the direction of the wound,” Gil-
martin explained, “ because if Sarki-
sian was killed—as you say he prob-
ably was—when standing, the height
of the various suspects as compared
with his height might possibly be im-
portant.

  “If a smaller person did it, the bul-
let would travel upward, if a taller
person or one the same height, it
would go straight across, and if very
much taller possibly downward, though
that is not likely. The query applies,
of course, to the men as well. By the
way, what was the direction of the
bullet?”

  “ We don’t know yet,” Barber re-
plied, “ the post-mortem will take place
to-day if Sir Wilfrid Sherburv gets
back to London. He is away giving
evidence in that Cardiff case.”

  “ I see. Well, pay particular atten-
tion to that point.”

  “ Is there anything you could advise,
chief,” the inspector asked diffidently,
“ besides what you have written here ?”
“ Personally,” Gilmartin replied, “ I
think the case is one for a special con-
ference with the assistant commis-
sioner and the superintendents of the
department. I shall ask that men be
put on to these points I have men-
tioned here and that they report to
you and me, and that we two concen-
trate with as many men as possible on
finding that old woman and rounding
up this white slave gang. I have an
idea that we might find our murderer
there, and even if we don’t it’s a lot
more important that we scotch the
gang than that we bring in the killer
of a dog like that. By the way, is
that stuff that Kyprianos sent in any
good ?”

  “ I haven’t had time to test it.”
“Hum! Then look here! We must
phone the stations concerned to watch
the addresses he gives and I’ll get them
to put a couple of intelligent youngsters
to sift this stuff of Sarkisian’s. Then
we’d better collect the superintendents
and you can tell your little tale. So,
let’s look up these addresses.”

  In a few minutes the addresses had
been sorted out according to their po-
lice divisions and it was Chief Inspec-
tor Gilmartin himself who gave the
necessary instructions to have the
houses watched. In each case he laid
particular stress on the possibility that
Rivka Schaffer, who already figured in
the list of “ wanted ” persons, might
be connected with one or all of them,
and he found in almost every instance
the divisional inspector concerned to be
astonished at the information, for the
houses, with one exception, were in
quiet residential streets. The excep-
tion was a servants’ registry office
which—the inspector who answered
Gilmartin said—catered mainly to girls
from the country and from small pro-
vincial towns. On hearing the address
THE CLEW OF THE CLOT

653

the inspector in question exclaimed in
astonishment.

  “Now that’s a coincidence, chief!”
he said. “ There has just been a re-
port from the constable on the beat
about that place. He says that there’s
a line of girls obstructing the pave-
ment in front of it. It didn’t open
to-day.”

  “ Then,” Gilmartin ordered, “ get a
warrant and search it. Get every scrap
of paper you can find on the premises
and send them along here.

  “ They’ve probably removed their
books,” he went on, speaking to Barber,
“ but if not, we might at least be able
to trace some of the country girls who
have been reported to us as missing
during the past months.”

  They were on their way along the
corridor to the assistant commissioner’s
room when they met one of the de-
partmental superintendents on his way
out. Gilmartin stopped him and ex-
plained why he wanted him.

  “ Funny you should mention that
case,” the superintendent said, “ be-
cause Sir Wilfrid Sherbury. on his way

to the mortuary to conduct the post-
mortem 011 your friend, has just got
mixed up in a motor accident. I’ve
just been to see the scene of the col-
lision.”

  “ Is he hurt?”

  “ He’s hurt, but not very seriously,
I think, but the lad who seems to have
been responsible for the thing—a
young sport in a lavender-colored car
he calls Jane—has had his leg broken.
Eh? What’s that?”

  The question was directed at Wil-
kins, standing behind the others, who
had uttered an involuntary exclama-
tion.

  “ Sorry, sir,” the sergeant apolo-
gized, “ but would the young fellow’s
name be Buckeridge?”

  “ It would, and it is. Why ?”

  The three detectives engaged on the
Sarkisian case looked at each other.

  “ Talk about coincidences!” Barber
exclaimed. “ There’s one for you, all
right!”

  “Is it, sir?” Wilkins asked signifi-
cantly.

  Gilmartin said nothing.

TO BE CONTINUED

“Get Your Man”

THE Royal Canadian Mounted Police always gets its man! That motto
which has made famous one of the world’s finest police forces, was
recently vindicated again when the Mounties arrested a man for a mur-
der seven years ago. Joseph Germaine and Samuel Pat lived together on a
small farm in the Squaw Valley in Saskatchewan. Pat worked for Germaine.
The farm was not much of a success, Germaine ran into debt, and Pat entered
into an agreement to buy the place. Pat had paid an installment when Ger-
maine suddenly disappeared. No one knew what had become of him. Pat,
with a bill of sale, took possession of the farm.

     Murder was suspected, but there was no proof. Interest in the neighbor-
hood finally languished; Pat prospered and married. But the Mounties had
not forgotten. Constables on patrol in the district made it a habit to drop in
on Pat—just friendly calls which he never suspected. But slowly the Royal
Mounted was gathering the proof, and one day a constable visited Pat. not
to pay a friendly visit, but to arrest him for the murder of Joseph Germaine.

When Professor Nearow Found a Revcdver
Shell Still Hot, He Picked Up the Firtt
Clew to the Solution of a Weird Crime

The Murder at City Hall

                    By Claybourne Dabney

THASSOWAY NEAROW, top
hat, tail coat, spats, stick, spec-
tacles, side whiskers and all,
scrambled over low railings that
divided the patches of lawn about the
statue of the city’s founder.

  He stepped gingerly over the last
fence behind a row of automobiles,
parked on the Mall facing City Hall,
just as the blaring, thumping Street
Cleaning Department band drew up at
the head of a small procession of cars
bearing Count Adelphi, unofficial rep-
resentative of Mussolini.

  Through the space between two of
the parked cars Nearow darted, but
was brought up abruptly by a man 'who
blocked his way, standing in the open
door of a car, talking to another man
seated behind the wheel.

  Professor Nearow was on the point

  of turning back, when the standing
  man wheeled suddenly, gave Nearow a
  sharp glance, called good-by to the
  man at the wheel, and walked briskly
  toward the crowd packed behind a line
  of police along the front of the row
  of cars.

   Nearow followed him toward the
 crowd, noticing out of the corner of his
 eye—a fact which was to prove later of
 the greatest significance—that the man
 at the wheel waved and then leaned
 down as though to shut off his motor.

    The man whom Nearow was follow-
 ing shouldered his way roughly
 through the crowd, with his brief case
 tucked firmly under his arm, thrust a
 policeman to one side, and walked im-
 portantly through the noisy band
 toward the mayor and the official party
 on the steps of City Hall, who were

654
" Here he is, sergeant! ” Nearow wheeled about

posing with the distinguished guest for
the cameramen.

  Nearow, impressed because the
policeman, instead of shouting at the
man, saluted, tried the same tactics, but
a heavy hand swung him about, and he
found himself facing an irate patrol-
man.

  “ Who do you think you are, Pres-
ident Hoover?” asked the policeman.

  “ No,” replied Nearow, abashed and
annoyed. “ I saw that man do it, so
I thought I would try it too.”

  “ Oh, you did, hey? Well, you’re a
pretty smart boy, ain’t you? That’s
Alderman Craigwillie. Who are you?”
“ Pm Tljassoway Nearow, professor
emeritus of psychology at the univer-
sity, and its official representative at
the reception here. The police wouldn't
let me through over at Broadway, so I
climbed over the fences to get in here.”
“ Oh, you did, hey ? Well, I sup-
pose you got your invite with you,
doc?” asked the somewhat mollified
officer.

  “No, I haven’t. You see, the profes-

sor of romance languages was invited,
but he was taken ill, and as I am
familiar with the Italian tongue and
have few duties, I was pressed into
service.”

  “ Well, it’s too bad, doc, but I simply
can’t take a chance. Too many gate
crashers at these receptions to dis-
tinguished foreigners, and we all get
hell about it. I tell you; come on back
behind the crowd and I’ll get the
sergeant.”

 The policeman pushed his way
through to the back of the crowd, and
Nearow followed, much put out.

  Those nearest them eyed Nearow
curiously for a moment, but the magic
of martial music, and the thrill of see-
ing prominent men on the steps of
City Hall drew their eyes away again,
prompting in Nearow the sudden, in-
congruous thought that although ten
thousand persons were standing within
a stone's throw, he might beat the
policeman unconscious with his heavy
palmetto cane, and no one would notice
them.

655

  “Now spill it, brother, while I look
around for the sergeant. What’s the
song and dance again?”

  “ Well, you see, the professor of
romance languages was ill,” began
Nearow, “ and—”

  “ Hey! Hey! Look out! Let me by!”
shouted a shrill voice as its owner, an
excited, hatless little man with long
black hair, dived between Nearow and
the policeman, forcing each of them to
step back to regain his balance.

  The excited man plunged into the
crowd, and tugged and clutched at
those nearest him, trying to make a
way through.

  The policeman, bellowing like an in-
dignant rhinoceros, leaped after him.

  Nearow saw the man’s hat lying on
the ground in the space between two
cars from which he had so suddenly
appeared.

  The professor, his seamed face
wrinkled in a wry smile, stepped over
and stooped to pick it up. As his hand
was closing on it, he noticed a shiny
brass object just under the running
board, stooped further, and seized it,
holding it in the palm of his hand to
examine it.

  It was a revolver shell, and it was
still hot.

  He stared at it in his hand, and
wondered who would fire a revolver in
the midst of a crowd like that. Per-
haps, before the parade, a policeman
had tested his revolver, but it seemed
improbable.

  The patrolman and the excited man,
on the skirts of the crowd, were in the
midst of an argument.

  “ Calm down now, Mr. Stani,” the
policeman said. “ You’ve got to show
me your invitation, or you don’t get in.
Them’s my orders and I stick to it.”

  “ It’s an outrage. It’s a Fascisti
frameup,” screamed the man addressed
at Stani, reaching frantically in an in-
ner pocket, and extricating a handful
of papers.

  Professor Nearow placed the hat
upon the man’s disordered head and

was rewarded by a quick look of
alarm.

  Stani immediately turned his atten-
tion back to his papers, however, and
triumphantly produced a large en-
velope which he waved in the police-
rnnn’s t'if'p

 “Ha! Aha! Hey! You see? The
Fascist plots fail again. I, Stani, al-
ways outwit the Fascisti! Bah!”

  “ It’s O. K. Avith me, brother,” re-
plied the officer. “If you’re through
with your speech now, suppose you
come along and I’ll get you in.”

  The policeman led the way, and
Stani, still chattering and waving the
letter, followed him through the
crowd, and through the band toward
the steps of City Hall.

  “ Don’t forget me, please,” Nearow
called after the officer, and then, in
chagrin, so far forgot his dignity and
composure as to say, with a vast
amount of feeling, “ Damn!”

  “ What’s trouble?” asked a voice at
his feet, and he looked down to see a
cameraman changing a magazine.

  “ I can’t understand it,” Nearow ex-
plained, with a wry expression, tugging
at his side whiskers. “ I am treated
practically like a common criminal, and
there’s no telling what complaints the
university people are likely to receive
about it, but the same police that hold
me back let by some alderman—Craig-
willie, wasn’t it ?—and a lunatic named
Stani.”

  “No mystery about that, deacon,”
said the photographer with a grin.
“ Craigwillie’s head of the bootleg
ring. Any cop that got him sore
would be lost in the marshes out in
Little Neck the next day. As for that
little dago, he don’t look like much, but
he’s editor of an Italian daily and head
of the anti-Fascist outfit here.”

  “Well,” sighed Nearow, his crinkled
face twisted in a smile, “ being neither
a bootlegger nor a political wrangler,
but only a retired professor, I suppose
I can do nothing but wait.”

  “ Wait until I get a shot from here,”

said the photographer, scrambling up
on the hood and silver radiator top of
an Isotta to focus his camera over the
head of the crowd and band, “ and I’ll
fetch the sergeant and fix vou
up O. K.”

  “ I’m much obliged to you,” said
Nearow graciously, “and may I warn
you, since you seem to be scratching up
that nickeled surface rather generously,
that there seems to be some one in the
car you’re standing on?”

  “ Oh, him. He’s dead, sound asleep.

I	already shot a picture from here
while you were talking to the cop.”

  “ Judging from the motor car
owners I’ve known, who approach hy-
sterics if any one so much as grazes a
fender, I should say that he must be
dead,” Nearow said.

  The photographer laughed and
jumped down, his picture taken.

  “ You stay right here, and I’ll get
the sergeant,” he said, running off.

  Professor NearOw was staring at
the man in the car, sprawled over the
wheel. It was a funny place for a man
to take a nap, and a funny moment,
too, for one. Of course, if he were a
chauffeur—but he obviously was not.

  Nearow found his curiosity had in
it a trace of nervous excitement, and
suddenly remembered the revolver
shell which he was clutching still in his
left hand.

  He stared at it.

  “ Tickle my sideburns,” he said
aloud and solemnly.

  He took a step toward the car door.
Of course, the man was probably
asleep, and doubtless would be indig-
nant at being awakened, possibly might
even accuse him—Nearow had had
some unpleasant experiences because of
his curiosity—of being a pickpocket.
It might be embarrassing—

  Still—there was a bare chance—
  He took another step.

  “ Here he is, sergeant,” called the
photographer’s voice immediately be-
hind him. Nearow wheeled about.

  “ Please excuse us for causing you
  6 D

any trouble, professor,” said the boom-
ing voice of the gray-haired sergeant.
“ The men got their orders, so you
can’t blame them. I’ll take you right in
now, sir. They're just going in, and
all you’ve missed is the bother of hav-
ing your picture took.”

  Nearow smiled affably and bowed
acquiescence, but immediately half
turned and nodded toward the car.

   “ Odd place to choose for a nap, isn't
it?” he asked the sergeant.

  “Yes,” agreed the officer, glancing
first at the occupant of the car, still
sprawled over the wheel, and then at
the license plate, which displayed a
very low number—a single digit and
a single letter.

  “You don’t think anything’s
wrong?” suggested Nearow.

  “ Oh, no, probably just got a hang-
over, I guess. He must be some big
politician, judging from the license.
I’ll probably know him if I could see his
face.”

  “ Easy enough to find out,” said the
cameraman breezily. “ I’ll open the
door and yell at him.”

  “No, you don’t. Not while I’m
around,” replied the sergeant, catching
the photographer by the arm. “ He’s
probably soused, and I’d never hear
the end of it if we caused any sort of a
scene here. His friends will probably
get him away when the crowd’s gone.”
Nearow hesitated. His faint suspi-
cion was rapidly becoming a conviction.
Yet if he opened the door to find out,
the man might prove to be merely
drunk, there might be a scene, and he
had no wish to bring any unpleasant
notoriety to the university upon such
an occasion.

  Ought he tell the sergeant about the
shell he had picked up. Was there a
connection? He thought there was.

  “ Would you mind coming right
along now, sir?” asked the sergeant.
“ They’re going in, and I’ve got to
change the positions of my men to get
the crowd moving along.”

  “ I’ll tell one of the officials,”
658

Nearow said to himself, and followed
the sergeant up the steps of City Hall.
The photographer joined a group of
his fellows on the steps.

II

IN the small reception room off the
crowded aldermanic chamber,
Nearow was effusively greeted by
the aldermanic president.

  “ Professor Carimo was taken ill
suddenly and I am taking his place. By
the way, I have a possibly ridiculous
suspicion that a man outside has been
shot.”

  “ Shot, eh? Ha, ha. Been that
way myself many a time,” the genial
politician laughed, nudging Nearow'
roguishly. “That's a good one, eh?
Shot. Ha, ha!”

  “ No, I mean murder,” said Nearow,
flushing and feeling he was making
somewhat of an ass of himself.

  “Murder, eh!” said the politician,
who wasn’t going to let any one think
he was lacking a sense of humor.
“ You’re a sly one all right. Let me tell
the commissioner.”

  He beckoned to a man in a police
uniform adorned with a great deal of
gold braid.

  “ Hi, Commissioner Ahearn. Meet
Professor Naggle—”

  “ Nearow,” interrupted the profes-
sor. reddening again.

  “ Nero, my little dog, has fleas,”
said the aldermanic president with
another nudge. Nearow decided to
say nothing more of his suspicions.

  “ Glad to meet you, professor,” ex-
claimed the police commissioner with
a hearty handclasp. “ It’s a great
honor.”

  “ Where’d you get the pretty suit, in
Macv’s toy department?” asked the
president.

  “ How do you like it? First time
I’ve worn a uniform. Got it made
especial because the mayor said this
Count Adelphi was going to pin a
couple o’ medals on. Say, who is he,
anyway?”

  “I’ll be darned if I know. Somebody
told me, but I forgot. I know half the
Italian vote’s packed into the alder-
manic chamber, and Congressman
Pagano said we had to look out or the
anti-Fascisti might start a riot.”

  “ Nonsense. We got two hundred
police reserves hid right next door in
City Court, but there ain’t going to be
any trouble. Not while I’m around.
Do you know who he is, professor?”

  “ I don't know very much about
him, except that I was given to under-
stand that he had been sent over by
Mussolini to reward the leaders of the
pro-Mussolini faction.”

  “Yeah, that’s it,” agreed the alder-
manic president, and then, growing
suddenly serious, said to a swarthy,
stocky man with grizzled hair, who had
just stepped worriedly from a tel-
ephone booth, “ Have you located
Congressman Pagano yet?”

  “No. I can’t understand it. He
drove away from his home nearly an
hour ago they say.”

  “ You’ve tried the speakeasy on the
other side of the Hall of Records? He
stops in there a great deal.”

  “ He wouldn’t take a chance drink-
ing before a thing like this. Why he’s
been planning this for months.”

  Nearow, embarrassed by overhear-
ing what seemed to be a somewhat
delicate conversation, turned to the
commissioner, who laughed, noting his
confusion, and explained in an under-
tone :

  “ The Congressman does like his
little nip, and he gets plenty, seeing as
how he’s the one, so they say. that col-
lects for the prohibition permits. Wor-
ries his friends a great deal.”

 “ You amaze me.” exclaimed
Nearow.

  “ He's no friend of mine,” said the
commissioner, with a touch of sarcastic
bitterness, Nearow thought. “We’ve
been trying to close up most of the
speakeasies, but it’s pretty tough when
a Congressman is in on it."

  “Why, this is shocking,” Nearow
THE MURDER AT CITY HALL

659

said, genuinely amazed. “ Can’t you
do anything about it?”

  “ What can you do ?” shrugged the
police chief. “ Everybody holds every-
body else's hand, and you never know
whose toes you’re stepping on. Why,”
he went on, waxing confidential to an
interested, unbiased, innocent listener,
“ I came in on a reform ticket, but I’ll
be darned if I can make any headway.”
The stocky man was going back to
the telephone booth.

  “ You try those places, and, mean-
while, we’ll have to start things going,”
the aldermanic president called after
him, and turned to Nearow :

  “ Come, professor, I want you to
meet the mayor.”

  Nearow, feeling that the commis-
sioner would treat his suspicions
seriously, was thus prevented from im-
mediately disclosing them. In turn,
he met the mayor, Count Adelphi, the
Italian vice consul, and several mem-
bers of the mayor’s cabinet, including
Alderman Craigwillie.

  The man Stani, still as excited as
ever, was dashing in and out among
the group, all of whom were nervous
about the delay.

  “ I can’t understand it,” Craigwillie
told the mayor. “ He must have
stopped in at one of the places around
here. He drove up at the same time
I did, and we parked our cars together.
I hurried on in because I wanted to see
my constituents in the chamber, there,
before he started things off, but he said
he was coming right up, and the parade
was already here.”

  “ Listen to them,” the mayor said,
nodding to the double doors leading to
the platform of the great chamber.
The excited chattering was plainly
audible. “No telling what they’ll do
if we keep ’em waiting any longer.
We’ll have to start off.”

  “ Better let me do the speech-
making,” said Stani shrilly. “We’ll
get off the little ceremony here, and
then I’ll introduce him to the crowd
out there.”

  “ Much obliged, Stani,” said the
mayor, plainly relieved.

  The Italian vice consul looked
quickly about in anxious amazement.
The stocky man was still in the phone
booth. The vice consul seemed on the
point of objecting to Stani as toast-
master, but thought better of it, and
held his peace.

  Nearow, was growing more and
more curious. He edged over toward
the window.

  Below him, he could see that the man
sprawled over the steering wheel of
the car had not changed his position.

  He edged over to the commissioner,
who was listening intently to Stani’s
torrent of Italian delivered to Count
Adelphi.

  “ Hell, I don't get a word of that
lingo,” whispered the commissioner.
The mayor, equally uncomprehending,
was idly biting his nails. The other
city officials fidgeted.

  The guest of honor was staring at
Stani with an expression of surprise.

  Nearow’s mind, although it was
fretting about the man in the car,
caught and automatically translated
fragments of Stani’s speech.

  “ We appreciate the great honor
extended by his excellency, but we feel,
owing to unfortunate differences now
existing between pro-Fascist and anti-
Pascist groups of our Italian-born
American citizens, that it might be very
much more discreet if the highly prized
decorations be not awarded—”

  Nearow looked at Stani in sudden
interest.

  The vice consul was black with sup-
pressed rage. The stocky man was still
telephoning. Count Adelphi still wore
his look of pained surprise. The others,
not understanding the language, looked
bored.

  “ If he is dead,” Nearow said to him-
self, “ I was standing only a step or
two away when he was killed, for I saw
him wave good-by to Craigwillie. Of
course, the band was making an up-
roar, but even the booming of the bass
660

DETECTIVE FICTION WEEKLY

drum would not have covered the sound
of a revolver shot.

  “ It must have heen done with a
silencer. When 1 picked up Stani's hat
there was the warm shell. If I am not
mistaken, silencers are quite long and
bulky. A man could not very well
conceal it under his coat without it
showing somewhat. There is a bulge
under Stani’s coat where a shoulder
holster might be.

  “ Certainly, he would have the gun
on his person. A man couldn’t walk
into City Hall after committing a mur-
der and lay the weapon down in a cor-
ner somewhere. It would eventually
be found and traced. Still, he might
have had an accomplice.”

  Nearow decided he had dallied long
enough. He must at once confide his
suspicions to the police chief.

  Count Adelphi was replying to
Stani’s speech, also in Italian. Nearow
caught phrases:

  “ And so, as you so gracefully sug-
gest, we will not bestow the decora-
tions upon his honor, the mayor, and
the honorable commissioner of police,
but will merely convey to them his ex-
cellency’s cordial felicitations and deep
appreciation for the flattering recep-
tion—”

  The stocky man came out of the
phone booth, and his jaw dropped in
amazement. The vice consul whis-
pered to him. and both glared furiously
at Stani, who seemed on the point of
bursting with excitement.

  The mayor delivered a pat little
speech of welcome, and then the party
started to file in through the double
doors into the packed chamber, as a
roar went up from the excited crowd,
and the band, ensconced in the bal-
cony, struck up the Italian national
anthem.

  Nearow caught the commissioner by
the sleeve, and held him back.

  “ Just a moment, please, Mr. Com*
missioner. Something of great im-
portance,” he said.

  The commissioner was impatient.

  “ Say, I got to get my medal,” he
said.

  “ Count Adelphi just said he wasn’t
going to present the medals,” said
Nearow quickly, “ but—”

  “ Well, wouldn’t that burn you up ?”
exclaimed the astonished police chief.
“ Here, after I got a uniform and all,
and stood all that guying, why, the
nerve of—”

  “ It was Stani's doing. I'll explain in
a minute. But first. Look down
there. See that man in the car, over
there? The Isotta.”

  “Asleep, hey? Yeah. What about
him?”

  “ I’m afraid he’s dead,” said
Nearow solemnly.

  The commissioner searched his face
in sudden alarm, and laughed nerv-
ously.

  “Dead? You’re joking, aren’t you?”
Commissioner Ahearn’s face plainly
showed his growing fright.

  “ No, I’m not joking. Look at this,”
went on Nearow, handing the shell to
the police chief.

  “ A thirty-eight caliber revolver
shell,” the chief pronounced. “ Where
did you get this?”

  “ Beside the car—”

  “ Why didn’t you tell me, man ?
Why—”

  “ Well, it seemed so impossible—”
  “ It is impossible. It can’t be.”

  He was gripping Nearow’s arm and
the pair were walking fast, almost in a
trot, down the hall, down the circular
stairs, down the front steps, and across
the Mall. Most of the crowd had dis-
persed, but the police were still out in
force.

  The grizzled sergeant saluted, as he
ran up.

  “ What’s the matter with that man,
Mac Murrachu?” the chief asked in a
low tone.

  “ Why. commissioner,” explained
the sergeant in embarrassment, “this
gentleman called my attention to him
before, but I thought he was taking a
little nap like, and I didn’t want to take
THE MURDER AT CITY HALL

661

any liberties with some one who might
be somebody of importance like, so—”
“ Tell your men to keep people mov-
ing along here,” ordered the chief,
shutting him off, “ and then come
over.”

  To Nearow, he added:

  “ Did you tell him about the shell?”
“ No, you see, I didn’t want to make
the university ridiculous, and it seemed
so impossible.”

  “ It is impossible. It must be.”

  “ Even though the shell was still
warm,” concluded Nearow.

  “ Oh, my God, man,” moaned the
chief, carefully opening the door.

  It was with a slightly sickening sen-
sation, but nevertheless with a thrill of
excitement that his suspicions were
well founded, that Nearow saw the
form of the man lurch slightly toward
the commissioner as he opened the
door.

  The commissioner put his hand
against the inert man’s chest to stop the
movement, and when he drew it hasti-
ly away it was stained with red.

  The chief gently turned the face
toward me.

  “ Oh, my God,” he exclaimed again.
“ It’s Congressman Pagano.”

Ill

SERGEANT Mac MURRACHU,
white and anxious, had run up.

“ Quick, Mac Murrachu. Get an
ambulance. Throw a line about the car.
Keep everybody moving. Don’t let
any one stop to see what’s going on
here.”

  Mac Murrachu hurried off again to
give instructions to his men.

  The commissioner gently closed the
door, and sank weakly down on the
running board, placing his head in his
hands in a momentary gesture of
despair.

  Quickly, however, he got down on
his knees and searched the ground
around the car, without finding any-
thing.

He next examined the running

board, and then, again carefully open-
ing the door, looked about 011 the seat
and floor of, first, the front and then
the rear compartment.

  “ Get the Homicide Squad, quick.
Tell them to keep it under cover and
not, under any circumstances, to let the
papers know. Don’t let anybody touch
the car until the finger-print men have
taken their impressions. Tell the in-
spector to report to me at once in the
mayor's office when he comes.”

  Mac Murrachu saluted.

  “ Come 011, professor,” said the
commissioner, and led the way back
into City Hall and up to the mayor’s
extensive office.

  “ Wait till I get this note off to the
mayor, telling him to keep that meet-
ing going for awhile,” he said, scrib-
bling, and then sent it out with the
mayor’s secretary.

  “ Now tell me everything you know
about it,” he said.

  While N earow recounted chronologi-
cally what he had seen, without, how-
ever, going into what he thought, the
chief stood at the window, hands
twisting behind his back, staring down
at the detectives, buzzing like ants
around the car.

  “ If you’re so positive that you saw
him wave good-by to Alderman Craig-
willie, that means he was killed right
there in the next few minutes. I was
hoping maybe he was already dead,
and had been brought here and
propped up while nobody was looking.

  “But—oh, hell! It’s too— Why,
man, it’s simply impossible. Ten
thousand people looking on, and police
so thick you fall over them—

  “Why even I was standing there,
next the mayor, posing for the pic-
tures, and looking pretty right over in
that direction—”

  The door flew open, and the mayor,
pale and excited, rushed in.

  “ They'll keep ’em there,” he said.
“ Stani’s going to make a long speech.
What’s the matter? What’s hap-
pened ?”
662

DETECTIVE FICTION AVEEKLY

  “ Oh, not a thing in the world."
moaned the commissioner. “Not a
single little thing, except that while we
were standing there getting our pic-
tures took, why somebody strolled up,
with half the police in town twiddling
their fingers, and took a pot shot at
Congressman Pagano, right here in
front of City Hall—”

  “ You don't mean it—”

  Ahearn indicated the window. The
mayor looked out.

  The ambulance was moving slowly
away, and policemen were carrying the
body to a patrol wagon.

  “ Dead!” exclaimed the mayor. “Joe,
I’m afraid this is your finish, old man.
After your speakeasy campaign was
such a flop. Any chance of catching
him?”

  “ Can you beat it ?” exclaimed
Ahearn, after a burst of profanity.
“ Pagano nearly ruins me by selling
permits while he’s alive, spoiling my
speakeasy campaign, and then finishes
the job by getting himself bumped off
tinder my nose.”

  “ But how did it happen?"

  “ Oh, sure. How did it happen ? I
did it. Sure.”

  “Well,” said the mayor slowly, “I
suppose you would if you got the
chance, but you happened to be right
with me.”

  “ I ask you how it happened,” the
chief said, with sudden intensity.
“ With ten thousand people looking
on, hundreds of them looking down
from the windows of the Woolworth
Building and a dozen other buildings,
how is it that not one single one of
them—not one, mind you—notices a
man walk up to another man in a car,
draw a revolver, shoot him dead, and
walk away? I ask you.”

  “ It’s impossible. Joe. That’s all.”

  “ Sure it’s impossible, but it hap-
pened."

  “ Could it have been done with a
silencer?” asked Nearow.

  “ I guess so. Probably was. With
the band and all. Of course, even if

a man yelled, nobody’d hear him out
there right behind the band.’1

  “ Well, that may be true, but that
still doesn’t explain how a man could
stand there and draw a gun, and aim it,
and fire it, without one single soul
noticing him,” objected the mayor.

  “ Could a man carry a revolver with
a silencer in a shoulder holster ?’’ asked
Nearow meekly.

  “ I guess so,” replied the chief, “ but
it would be as bulky and about as
awkward as a sawed-off shotgun.”

  “ Stani’s coat bulged on the left
side,” said Nearow quietly.

  The chief half rose, gripping the
arms of his chair, and -staring at
Nearow. The mayor, pale again, stared
at Ahearn.

  “ My God,” whispered Ahearn.

  “ He was jabbering something to
me,” said the mayor, taking a folded
newspaper from his pocket, “and gave
me this, but I couldn’t make it out.”

  “ Perhaps I can,” suggested Nearow
and took the paper, which proved to be
the first page of that day’s issue of the
Italian daily, of which Stani was
editor.

  Nearow adjusted his spectacles and
scanned it.

  “ Ah,” he murmured, pointing out
to them a three-column, boxed editorial
in large type on the front page, over
Stani’s signature.

  “ I can’t read dago,” protested the
chief.

  “ I’ll give you a free translation. Or,
better, I’ll summarize it. Stani says
that for the last time—it’s headed * A
Last Warning ’—that he is warning
signors the mayor and commissioner
of police that they must not accept
medals from the present ruling faction
in Italy, that feeling runs high locally
between Fascist and anti-Fascist sym-
pathizers, and that if the officials ac-
cept medals the police in any future
demonstrations will side against the
anti-Fascists, and riots and bloodshed
may follow. ‘At any cost,’ he concludes,
‘ signors the mayor and police commis-
THE MURDER AT CITY HALL

663

sioner should be prevented from ac-
cepting these decorations, thus aligning
themselves on the side of one faction in
a dispute in which no American officials
should participate. This is our last
warning.’ ”

  “A fanatic!” whispered the mayor.

  “He figured if he could keep Pagano
away and do the speech making him-
self, he could prevent it. Sure,” added
the chief, greatly excited, pounding his
fist on the mayor’s desk.

  “ He’s apt to bump off Count
Adelphi,” added the mayor.

  “ Come on,” shouted the chief,
reaching back to his hip pocket as he
ran out the door.

  In the hall, they found pandemo-
nium.

  It was packed with uniformed men,
struggling to get into the double doors
of the assembly room, from which a
roar of voices, with an obbligato of
screams, was issuing.

  Over the heads of the officers,
Nearow, who is unusually tall, could
see into the room, with a milling crowd
sweeping back and forth on the
platform.

  “ Come on,” shouted Ahearn to
Nearow and the mayor, and led the
way through a side door, through an
office, and into the little reception
room.

  Just as they arrived, the doors lead-
ing to the assembly room platform
burst open, and in came Count Adelphi,
and the official party, safe in the center
of a flying wedge of patrolmen.

  Behind them came another group of
policemen, clinging to Stani, who was
screaming imprecations and putting up
an amazing fight for his small size.

  The doors were quickly closed, and
guarded, shutting out the sound of the
bedlam.

  Ahearn ran over to Stani, and
calmed his men.

  “ Maybe I'll be a martyr, but I saved
my city from disgrace. Sic semper
tyrannus! Down with all Fascisti,”
Stani screamed.

  “ Did you search him ?” Ahearn
asked.

  One of the policemen handed him a
revolver, Nearow and the mayor ex-
amined it with interest.

  “ Perhaps he threw the silencer
away,” suggested Nearow.

  Ahearn flung open Stani’s coat, and
examined the holster.

  “ Couldn’t have carried one in this
holster,” he said. “ No mark of it on
the revolver. I don't think this gun’s
ever been fired. It's a thirty-two, any-
how.’’

  Ahearn looked suddenly at Professor
Nearow.

  'Phe mayor had hurried to reassure
Count Adelphi, who, though his clothes
were awry, readjusted his monocle, and
stood as cool as though he were at-
tending a lawn party.

  Nearow was thinking last, trying to
reconstruct, without bias from his
previous conclusions, everything that
he had seen in its proper relationship.

  “ Why did you kill him?” Ahearn
demanded of Stani.

  “ Kill him?” asked Stani in surprise.
“ Kill who?”

  “ You know well enough, who,” re-
torted the chief, “ unless you killed so
many that you’ve lost track—1 mean
Congressman Pagano.”

  “ Is he dead?” Stani cried, clasping
his hands in happiness. “ Glorious.
Thank the good God.”

  “ Well, you won’t be so thankful
when you go to the chair,” retorted
Ahearn.

  “ Me? Ah, no. It is another damn-
able Fascist plot, perhaps, but I will
outwit them as I always outwit them.
I do not fear them.”

  “Take him up to headquarters and
I’ll question him later,” the commis-
sioner ordered. “ Hold him incom-
nnicada.”

  He flung open the double doors and
gazed into the empty assembly room,
with its wreckage of broken chairs.
The last of the crowd was going peace-
ably down the emergency stairway,
664

DETECTIVE FICTION WEEKLY,

herded between two lines of police,
holding drawn clubs.

“ TUTHAT the hell happened, any-
how?” Ahearn asked Craig-
willie, who was standing near
by, mopping his head, and breathing
hard.

  “ Haven’t any idea.” muttered the
alderman. “ This fellow Stani started
talking to ’em, all excited as usual.
First there was a cheer, and then some
hissing, and then somebody else ap-
plauded loudly and shouted, and some
others started booing and waving
clenched fists, and then suddenly a fist
fight started down among the audience,
and first thing you know the whole
mob was fighting, and some of them
rushed up on the platform after Stani,
and others rushed up to do battle to
save him, and—

  “ Believe me, brother, I never been
so scared in my life. I’m usually
pretty cool.”

  “ It’s a marvel, a miracle nobody got
stabbed,” the commissioner declared.
“ Well, T guess this is hearts and
flowers for me. The last straw. Wait
till the papers get this.”

  “ Say. I just heard that poor Pagano
got bumped off. Too bad.”

  “ I guess you ain’t any sorrier than
I am, from all 1 hear about his holding
your syndicate up for protection
money.”

  “ Nonsense,” retorted Craigwillie,
writh a show of indignation. “ We
were great friends, and I was the last
one to see him alive. Don't you think
that means nothing?”

  “ I know you were, Professor Nea-
row, here, saw you.”

  Craigwillie looked quickly at Nea-
row, and then a slow smile wreathed
his heavy face.

“ Say. Maybe I ain’t lucky to have
an alibi witness—and a college per-
fesser, too. Can you beat that, hey?”
“ Well, you won’t need him. I’m
thinking we’ll have a confession out of

Stani pretty quick. That kind of a
nut always wants to boast to the world
about what he’s done.”

  “ You know, commissioner, burning
in the chair’s too good for a guy like
that.”

  He walked away, shaking his head.

  “ Mr. Commissioner, do you think
you could discreetly have every man
present here searched?”

  “ I get you, professor; you think
one of them might be a confederate
and have taken the gun. Sure, you're
right. We got to search every one if
we search any.”

  The commissioner, with great tact,
explained what he proposed to do, and
even Count Adelphi and the mayor
consented to be searched by the de-
tectives.

  Several of the men carried revolvers.
Each of them had a permit.

  An examination of the barrels of the
weapons showed that not a one had
been fired since last being cleaned.

  Nearow was as chagrined as the
chief, and took his leave, after promis-
ing to testify or appear whenever
wanted.

  It was while he was claiming his top
hat from the old policeman in the little
check room off the reception room that
he suddenly remembered what he had
forgotten, and leaned over and whis-
pered a word or two.

  “ He wants me to take it down to
the car with me,” he added, aloud.

  “ Look out now, sir. It’s real heavy,
and he warned me it’s right off the
boat and of the best,” said the old
check room keeper as he handed Nea-
row a slightly bulging brief case.
“ Sure, and I wish I could open it with
you.”

  “ Indeed, I do, too,” smiled Nearow,
and went down and out of City Hall.

  He stood for a moment in perplex-
ity, and then spied Sergeant Mac Mur-
rachu.

  “ Sergeant, will you kindly go up
to the reception room and ask the com-
missioner to come down at once, as I
THE MURDER AT CITY IIAU

have something of the greatest impor-
tance to show him.”

  The sergeant dubiously entered City
Hall, and Nearow walked toward Pa-
gano’s car, which stood just as it had
been when he had first seen it.

  The police, however, not only re-
fused to let him see it, but ordered him
to move along, desisting when he ex-
plained he was waiting for the com-
missioner.

  Ahearn appeared on the steps, and
was immediately besieged by a horde
of young men who had been kept from
entering City Hall by the line of police.

  He pleaded with them for a moment,
then argued, then beckoned to his men,
who surrounded the group and kept
them on the steps while Ahearn walked
over to Nearow.

  “ The newspaper men," he explained.
“ I've got to give them a statement in
five minutes, but I don't know what I
can say that won't ruin me.”

  Nearow looked back. The young
men were looking sullenly at the com-
missioner.

  “ Would you mind sitting in the
car?” Nearow asked the commissioner.
“ I’ve suddenly had a great light.”

  “ You're very mysterious,” grum-
bled the chief good-naturedly as he sat
behind the wheel where Pagano had
been slain, “ but if you think there’s a
secret gun in the car, or anything like
that, I’m afraid my men would have
discovered it long ago.”

  Ahearn had both hands on the wheel,
and was sitting back, looking pleasant-
ly and tolerantly down upon the pro-
fessor, who was standing close in the
open door of the car, fumbling with
the flap of the brief case.

  “ Suppose,” said Nearow, tugging at
the lock, “ that I said this minute that
I was about to take ten thousand dol-
lars in cash out of this brief case and
hand it to you, to keep. What would
you do?”

  “ Take another drink of the same
hop,” replied Ahearn, with a laugh.

  “ Seriously, now. Suppose you had

asked, or, perhaps, demanded the ten
thousand dollars, and I walked up to
you and said, here it is. Take it—”

  “ Why,” replied Ahearn, half seri-
ous and all curious, “ I’d take it, of
course. Can 1 help you get that open ?
It’s locked, isn't it?”

  “ I’ll get it,” replied Nearow. and
taking a firm hold, he suddenly ripped
open the flap.

  He reached carefully down into the
brief case, as Ahearn watched with in-
terest.

  On the steps the newspaper men, and
nearer Sergeant Mac Murrachu and his
men, were all watching with uncon-
cealed curiosity.

  Nearow suddenly whipped his hand
out, and fired a shot from the pistol it
held.

  The bullet passed bare inches from
Ahearn’s arm, and buried itself in the
upholstery.

  The silencer on the weapon had muf-
fled the sound, so that, in the open air,
the police standing a few feet away
had not heard it above the city noises.

  Nearow was leaning in the open
door, which hid the weapon from the
onlookers.

  Ahearn’s face was gray.

  Nearow was grinning triumphantly.

  “ My God, man.” whispered Ahearn
hoarsely, “ are you mad ? Give me that
gun.”

  “ I will be, if you don’t see instantly
what I’m getting at,” said Nearow
brightly, handing it over.

  “ It’s slowly dawning,” sighed
Ahearn, resting his clammy forehead
in his hand for a moment. He looked
faint, but his color soon returned.

  “ You know,” he went on, “ for a
moment I thought you were the killer
—absolutely cuckoo. But if you’ve
any heart at all don't ever give me any
more practical demonstrations. I’ll
take your word from now on.”

  “ It’s not Stani’s weapon," said
Nearow slowly.

  “ It’s not? Then who’s is it?”

  “ Who had Pagano been asking for
666

DETECTIVE FICTION WEEKLY

protection money for his illicit liquor
business?”

  “ You don’t mean Craigwillie ?”
  Nearow nodded.

  “ Great guns, man, how did you
know about the protection and liquor
and all?”

  “ You told me yourself.”

  “Did I, really? I must guard my
tongue. But how can we prove it's
his weapon?”

  “ Possibly by his finger-prints, pos-
sibly by finding upon him the key that
fits this brief case. Certainly by the
testimony of one of your own police-
men, with whom Craigwillie checked
the brief case in the check room up
there.”

  “What? The nerve of that guy.
First he bumps off his enemy under
my nose, with half the policemen in
town standing around, and then he
checks the gun with a copper. Can
you beat that?”

  “What else could he do? I don’t
think he planned it. Probably realized
all of a sudden what a golden oppor-
tunity he had there, and took advantage
of it, and decided if he told the check-
room man it was extra special liquor,
it would be safer than if he carried it
around himself.”

  “But what made you think of it?”
“ When I got my own hat, I was
thinking back, trying to remember if
there was anything I’d forgotten, and
then, suddenly, I remembered Craig-
willie had held tight to a brief case as
he pushed through the crowd.

  “ Somewhere I’d read that revolvers
with silencers are more often carried
in bags or packages than on the per-
son. I thought it was a wild chance,
and asked if Mr. Craigwillie had left
a brief case, and when he said yes,
and I felt its shape and weight, I was
pretty sure. The officer thought it was
liquor.”

  “But I thought you said Pagano
was alive and waved to Craigwillie,
after Craigwillie started off.”

  “ I did and he was and did,” Nearow
replied. “ As soon as I was sure Craig-
willie had done it, and set out to recon-
cile the apparent contradiction of my
own eyes, I realized the true signifi-
cance of what I saw.

  “ Craigwillie stood in the open door,
whipped out the gun — which was
hidden from everybody, even myself,
and I was just coming up—fired a
bullet right into Pagano’s heart, saw
me, coolly called good-by, slammed the
door, and hurried away.

  “ What I saw, instead of being Pa-
gano’s good-by to Craigwillie, was his
farewell to life—he cried out, raised
his arm spasmodically, and slumped
forward over the wheel. At the mo-
ment I thought he was leaning over
to shut off or to start his motor. The
band was thumping right there, and if
he had screamed his loudest not a soul
would have heard him through the
closed doors of his car.”

  “ Amazing. Will you accept an ap-
pointment as honorary deputy commis-
sioner?”

  “ But I thought you were sure you
would lose your office.”

  “ Oh, I’ll pull through, all right, but
—ho, hell!”

  “ What’s the matter?” asked Profes-
sor Nearow.

  “ I wish it had been Stani. Open
and shut. Craigwillie has all the pull
in the world, and the best criminal law-
yers in New York.

  “ I’ll make the pinch right now, and
I’ll get him indicted and tried, and
convicted, but he’ll appeal, and get a
new trial, and finally lie’ll get off with
about ten years. Say, the chair’s too
good for a fellow like that.”

  “ Exactly what he said himself, re-
member?” asked Nearow chuckling.

      A Tale of a Terrible Vengeance—the Actual Facts That
      Inspired the Great Novel, “ The Count of Monte Cristo ”

                  By Robert W. Sneddon

 AMONG Napoleon’s subjects in
Paris was a young man from the
^ “ provinces who was making a
good living as a shoemaker.

  Francois Picaud, good-looking, was
somewhat of a dandy for all his trade,
and had managed to win the love of
an attractive and pretty girl with some
money of her own. He was crazy
about the girl, and proud of his con-

quest. As the original says: “Among
this class of people there is only one
way to have a woman, to marry her.”
One Sunday the prospective bride-
groom, dressed up in his best clothes,
went to have a glass of wine in a cafe
kept by a friend, about his own age.
He was richer, which did not prevent
him having an overwhelming envy of
his prosperous neighbors.
668

DETECTIVE FICTION WEEKLY

  Loupian, who came from the south-
ern city of Nimes, as did Picaud,
had his cafe and wineshop in a good
location near Saint Opportune Place.
He was a widower with two children.

  When Picaud came in, there were
three other southerners in the cafe,
men whom he knew quite well.

  “Well, here's friend Picaud, dressed
up fit to kill!” said Loupian. “ There
must be something in the wind.” He
winked at the others.

  “ There is,” said Picaud simply, as
he sat down. “ I’m going to get
married.”

  “ And who have you picked out to be
unfaithful to you?” asked one of the
company named Allut.

The Lucky Lover

  As the others enlarged on the sub-
ject so dear to the writers of French
farce, Picaud grew angry and had to
be pacified.

  “ All joking aside,” said Loupian at
last, “ whom are you marrying, friend
Picaud?”

  “You may not believe it,” said
Picaud, “but the girl is the heiress,
Therese Vigouroux.”

  “ Why, she has a hundred thousand
francs in her own name,” cried the
astounded proprietor of the cafe.

  “Well, I can give her that amount
in love and happiness,” said Picaud
stoutly. “ Meanwhile, gentlemen, I
want you all to come to the mass, which
will be said in Saint Leu’s and to the
dance after the wedding feast—we’re
having it at Latignac’s in Bear Street.”
The four men could hardly believe
the evidence of their ears. Picaud cer-
tainly was a lucky man if the news was
true.

  “ When is the wedding to come off?”
Loupian asked.

  “ Tuesday.”

  “ This Tuesday?”

  “Yes. Don’t forget. I’ll expect you
all there. I’m going over to the
mayor’s office now to make the final ar-
rangements.”

Picaud hurried off briskly.

  “ Well, what do you make of that?”
  “ He’s a wizard.”

  “ Getting such a beautiful girl, and
money to burn.”

  Loupian sat scowling as the others
talked. Suddenly he looked up.

  “ Getting married on Tuesday, is
he? I bet you he doesn’t.”

“ What do you mean?” asked Allut.
“ I bet you I’ll put off the wedding.
I'll play a trick on Picaud. He’s too
cocky about himself. He needs to be
taken down a peg.”

  “What’s the idea, Loupian?”

  “Well, suppose I tell the police
Picaud is acting as a spy for the Eng-
lish. See. They’ll take him to the station
and keep him there while they in-
vestigate. That will keep the bride
waiting a Aveek at least. It will be a
good joke.”

  “ It’s a joke Picaud won’t appre-
ciate,” said Allut warningly. “If he
finds out you did it, he’ll be revenged
on you. I know Picaud. Don’t do it.”

A Practical Joke

  “ Oh, shut up, don’t be a spoil sport.
This is carnival time. Let us have our
fun.”

  “ Leave me out of it then,” said
Allut. “ I warn you you are laying up
trouble for yourselves.”

  “ Bah,” said Loupian, “ you haven’t
the courage of a chicken.”

  “ I have some sense of decency,”
shouted Allut. “ Good night, and
don’t say I didn’t w?arn you to keep
off Picaud.”

  The others burst into jeering laugh-
ter as the door shut, and Loupian, being
generous w'ith his wine, they approved
of his plan. He promised them he
would give them something to laugh
over.

  About two hours later he went to a
police station and told his story. The
officer wrote a report and sent it at
once to the head of the secret police.
It came in at a bad time, when the
authorities were bothered with rebel-
THE KILLER WHO COULDN'T FORGET

669

lions of the royalists in the province of
La Vendee. They jumped at the con-
clusion that Picaud was acting as an
agent between royalists in the west and
south, and was carrying on the trade of
shoemaking as a blind for his real
business.

  In those days conspirators were
dealt with at once, so that night, or,
rather, in the early morning, police
descended on Picaud’s residence and
removed him so secretly that his ab-
sence was not known until the morn-
ing of the wedding. No trace of him
could be found, and finally his
friends gave up all hope of seeing him
again.

Prisoners Released

  The years rolled on. In 1814 the
imperial government crashed to the
ground, and on April 15 the doors of
the fortress of Fenestrelle opened to
let out a prisoner. He was a man bent
with suffering, aged by despair rather
than the passage of years. In seven
years he had lived half a century.
Nobody who had once known him
could have recognized him. He stared
at a stranger’s face when he saw his
own in the first mirror he had gazed
into for seven years, in the miserable
inn at Fenestrelle.

  This man, who had been known in
prison as Joseph Lucher, had there
formed the acquaintance of an enor-
mously wealthy ecclesiastic of Milan,
whose relatives had contrived to have
him imprisoned in order to enjoy his
vast revenues. The ecclesiastic had
disappointed them and kept to himself
the knowledge that he had huge sums
of money in the Banks of Hamburg
and England. Furthermore, he had
sold the greater part of his estates to an
Italian prince and lodged the proceeds
with an Amsterdam banker.

  This noble Italian, dying on Janu-
ary 4, 1814. had constituted Joseph
Lucher sole heir to seven million
francs, and disclosed to him the secret
hiding place of over a million francs’

worth of diamonds and three million
francs in coin, Milanese ducats, Vene-
tian florins, Spanish crowns, French
louis, English guineas, ct cctera.

  Joseph Lucher, when he had re-
covered his strength and resumed the
habits of a living man, went to Turin
and from there to Milan. He acted
with the utmost caution, and at the end
of several days was in possession of the
treasure he had come to seek, with, in
addition, a quantity of antique jewels
and beautiful cameos.

  From Milan the millionaire went by
successive stages to Amsterdam, Ham-
burg and London, and having the
necessary papers to prove his heirship,
collected wealth enough to have filled a
royal coffer several times over. He
kept a million in cash and the di-
amonds. The rest he placed in invest-
ments. bringing him an income of six
hundred thousand francs, payable by
the Banks of England, Germany,
France and Italy.

Lucher Learns

  This business concluded, Joseph
Lucher set out to Paris, where he ar-
rived on February 15, 1815, eight
years to a day since the unfortunate
Francois Picaud had disappeared so
mysteriously. Picaud would have been
thirty-four years old.

  Lucher fell sick the day after he had
arrived in Paris, and as he had no
house or servants, had himself taken to
a hospital. He was still there when
Napoleon returned from exile to Paris,
and did not come out of hospital until
the emperor had been defeated and
Louis Eighteenth came back to the
throne for the second time. He then
left the hospital and established him-
self in humble lodgings in the Saint
Opportune district, where he learned
several happenings.

  One of them was that in February
of 1807 the good people of the district
had been puzzled by the disappearance
of a young shoemaker on the eve of his
wedding. Three friends had played
C70

DETECTIVE FICTION WEEKLY

some sort of a joke on him, and the
poor devil had run away or been kid-
naped. No one knew what had been
his fate.

  The bride-to-be had wept and
mourned him for two years, and then,
giving up all hope of ever seeing her
lover again, had married Loupian, a
cafe proprietor, who, through his
wealthy marriage, had prospered so
well that he now had one of the most
magnificent and popular cafes on the
boulevards.

Trails Beginning

  Joseph Lucher listened to this story
without showing any apparent interest
or making any comment. He made fur-
ther inquiries in a quiet way, but found
no one who could tell him the authors
of the great joke which had sent an
innocent man to exile or death.

  At last he did find one man who told
him:

  “ I once heard a certain Antoine
Allut say in front of me that he knew
the men who did it.’'

  “ I once knew an Allut in Italy. He
came from Nimes.”

  “ So did this one I speak of.”

  “ The Allut I knew,” said Lucher.
“ lent me a hundred crowns and told
me to pay them to his cousin Antoine.”
“ Why don’t you send the money to
Nimes. I believe he went there to
live,” said Lucher's informant.

  The next day a post chaise, preceded
bv a courier who paid thrice the usual
hiring charges, flew rather than
whirled on the highway to Lyons.
From there the conveyance followed
the Rhone by the Marseilles road,
which it left at Saint Esprit bridge.

  At this point a man dressed as an
Italian abbe got out of the chaise. He
engaged another conveyance and drove
to Nimes, where he put up at the well-
known Luxembourg Hotel. He quietly
questioned the people in the hotel
whether they knew an Antoine Allut,
and found out there were many of this
name in all stations of life.

  Some time passed before the Abbe
Baldini, as he said his name was, was
able to trace the object of his quest,
and several days before he came into
relations with him.

  He told Allut, after several meet-
ings, that lie had been a political pris-^
oner in the Chateau de l’Oeuf of
Naples, which stands on an island in
the port of this city, and that he had
there met a good fellow who, much to
his regret, had died in 1811.

  “ At this time,” continued the abbe,
“ lie was about thirty. He died mourn-
ing his lost country, but he pardoned
those responsible for his imprisonment.
He was a man from Nimes. His name
was Francois Picaud.”

  Allut uttered a smothered exclama-
tion. The abbe looked at him with an
amazed expression.

  “ Did you happen to know this
Picaud?” he asked.

  “ He was one of my best friends,
and to think of him dying so far from
home,” said Allut with emotion. “ Did
you ever learn the reason for his ar-
rest?”

A Diamond Legacy

  “ He did not know it himself. I am
sure of that, for he swore to me by
everything sacred that he was ig-
norant.”

  Allut sighed. It might have been a
sigh of relief.

  The abbe continued:

  “ While Picaud was alive, he had
but one thought. He was ready to
give his share of heaven to the person
who would tell him the names of the
author or the authors of his arrest.
And this obsession inspired him to make
a peculiar will. But first I should tell
you that Picaud in prison was able to
be of great service to an English man,
a prisoner like himself, and when this
man died he left Picaud a diamond
worth, at lowest valuation, fifty thou-
sand francs.”

  “ Lucky fellow to get a legacy like
that,” said Allut sighing. “A man
TIIE KILLER WHO COULDN'T FORGET

671

can do a lot with fifty thousand francs.
It’s a fortune.”

  “ When Picaud was on his death-
bed,” the abbe resumed, “ he sent for
me and said: ‘ I can die happy if you
give me your word to do as I ask. Will
you promise me?’ I gave him my
word, knowing he would not ask me to
do anything contrary to honor or reli-
gion. I asked him what it was. He
said: ‘ I have never been able to learn
the names of those who cast me into
this hell, but I have had a revelation.
The voice of God has told me one of
my friends, a native of Nimes, by the
name of Antoine Allut, knows those
who betrayed me. When you receive
your freedom, go and find him, and,
for my sake, give him the diamond I
got from Sir Herbert Newton, but
only on this condition, that he gives
you the names of those whom I regard
as my murderers. When he tells you
the names, you will return to Naples
and have them engraved on a metal
plate over my grave.’ ”

Three Names

  Antoine Allut, after consideration,
said he was willing to meet the terms
of the bequest, only he was afraid and
must consult his wife. He returned
next day and gave the abbe the names
of Gervais Chaubard, Guilhem Solari,
and finally that of Gilles Loupian.

  The ring was handed over to Allut,
who negotiated its sale to a dealer in
precious stones for the sum of sixty-
three thousand, seven hundred and
forty-nine francs in cash. Four months
later, to the fury and chagrin of the
Alluts, the stone was sold to a Turkish
merchant for three times the amount.
This led to a dispute, and the dispute
led to a murder, that of the dealer.
Facing prison, death and total ruin, the
Alluts had to flee and took refuge in
Greece.

  One day a splendidly dressed lady
entered the cafe kept by Loupian and
asked to see the proprietor. She told
Loupian that her family was under

great obligations to a poor fellow
ruined by the events of 1814, but that
he refused to accept anything but her
recommendation for a position. All he
wanted was to get a place as waiter in
some establishment where he would be
treated kindly. He was no longer
young and looked to be about fifty. To
persuade Loupian to take him, the lady
would pay a hundred francs a month,
which payment the wraiter was not to
know of.

  Loupian agreed. A man presented
himself as the waiter, badly clothed
and ugly looking. He saw both Loupian
and his wife and was set to waiting on
the tables.

The Missing Groom

  Among the regular customers of the
cafe were the two Nimes men, Chau-
bard and Solari. They dropped in
every day at the same time, had a
drink, read the papers, played cards or
dominoes.

  One night Chaubard did not appear.
The usual joking remarks about having
met some lady were passed, and Solari
had to find another partner.

  Next night he arrived breathless. He
had just been called to the morgue to
look at the body of Chaubard, Tound
lying in a nook near the Pont des Arts
bridge with a dagger through the heart.

  The police were powerless to dis-
cover the murderer, who seemed to
have left no trace behind him.

  Two weeks later a handsome hunt-
ing dog belonging to Loupian died of
poison. A boy said he had seen a cus-
tomer feeding biscuits to the dog, and
described him. This was a young man
who drove the mail cart and liked to
poke fun at Loupian. He was able to
prove an alibi—luckily for him. Seven
days went by and madame’s favorite
parrot also was poisoned.

  Loupian, by his first marriage, had
a daughter, now aged sixteen. She
was ravishingly beautiful. A dandy
who said he was a marquis and a mil-
lionaire saw her one day in the cafe.
672

DETECTIVE FICTION WEEKLY

He spent money like water to have
meetings with the girl, bribing the
waiters and the maidservants. The
inevitable happened when the girl was
betrayed. The Loupians insisted that
the marquis must marry the girl and
he consented, and, as evidence of good
faith, showed his documents of iden-
tification and the titles of his estates.
The Loupian family was overjoyed.

  The marriage ceremony was carried
through, and a splendid wedding feast
was ordered in a fashionable restaur-
ant. Covers were laid for one hundred
and fifty guests.

  At the appointed hour the guests
were all present. The marquis alone
was missing. He had excused himself
on the pretext that he had been sum-
moned to the king’s presence. As the
guests waited a letter arrived from the
missing groom, begging that the dinner
be gone on with and that he would join
them later.

“ One! ”

  As the evening went on a great un-
easiness pervaded the company and the
laughter died away. The bride sat with
her eyes upon the door, expecting the
coming of the handsome groom every
instant.

  When the dessert was served one of
the waiters laid a letter beside the plate
of each guest. In curt and brutal
terms it stated that the so-called mar-
quis was an ex-convict and was now in
flighle These letters had been left by
a stranger, who had hurried away.

  The consternation of the Loupian
family may be imagined. They could
not imagine why they should be the
target for such a misfortune.

  But worse was to follow. Four
days later, on a Sunday, while all the
family was in the country, in search of
distraction for their worries, the apart-
ment over the cafe went on fire in
several places.

  A rabble of people came running
and, under the pretense of helping to
extinguish the flames and carry out the

furniture, pillaged, damaged and
destroyed everything. The flames could
not be put out, and the whole building
was ruined. What property had been
removed had been carried off.

  Loupian was a ruined man. All that
was left to him.was a little of his wife’s
property. His friends left him alone.
The only person who stuck to him was
the waiter Prosper, whom he had en-
gaged on the recommendation of the
lady. Prosper said he would follow
him and serve him for his board. So
Loupian opened a tiny cafe in St. An-
toine Street, and gradually old cus-
tomers began to come again.

  Among them was Solari, who, after
a visit to the cafe, was one night
seized with atrocious pains, and, in
spite of the efforts of a doctor, died in
agony a few hours later.

“Two! ”

  Twelve hours later, wdien his bier
was exposed, as was the custom then,
in front of the house where he lodged,
a paper was found pinned to the cover-
ing of the coffin. On it wras printed
the single word—“ Two.”

  Loupian’s other child was a son, who
allowred himself to be drawn into evil
ways. He was running around with a
gang of others of his own age who
seemed to have lured him into their
society. One night it was proposed that
tlie gang should rob a wine shop, carry
off twelve bottles, drink them and pay
for them next day—all as a great
prank. Eugene Loupian thought this
was great sport and accompanied the
gang.

  Everything went off nicely. The
gang was just ready to steal out
with a couple of bottles apiece, when
the police surrounded the juvenile
criminals. Some one had squealed.
Only the royal clemency saved the
boy from death. As it was he was
given twenty years in prison.

  This catastrophe completed the ruin
of Loupian. Mme. Loupian died of
shame and worry, and as she left no

6 D
THE KILLER WHO COULDN’T FORGET	673

children, the remains of her dowry
went back to her family. Loupian and
his daughter were penniless.

  At this point the faithful Prosper
said he had managed to lay by quite
a sum of savings and that mademoiselle
might have them—at a price. The dis-
appointed bride to save her father and
lift them out of ruin threatening them
yielded finally and sold herself.

  Loupian existed. He no longer
lived. His misfortunes had reduced
him to a state where his brain no longer
would work. One night as he was
walking in an unfrequented path in the
Tuileries Gardens, a man wearing a
mask stepped from behind a tree.

“Three!”

  “ Loupian!” said this man harshly.
“Do you recall the year 1807?”
Loupian stared blankly.

  “ W’hy ?” he said dully.

  “ Remember the crime you com-
mitted at that period.”

  “ Crime—crime?”

  “Yes, an infamous crime, when
jealousy led you to plunge your friend
Picaud into the depths of a dungeon.
Now, do you remember?”

  “ Ah,” sighed Loupian. “ I remem-
ber. God has punished me severely.”
The masked man drew nearer. The
wretched man could feel the intensity
of the burning gaze which was cast
upon him through the eyeholes of the
mask.

  “ Not God has punished you, Lou-
pian, but Picaud. Picaud himself who
to satisfy his revenge stabbed Chau-
bard on Pont des Arts bridge, who
poisoned Solari, gave you a criminal
as son-in-law, and devised the trap into
which your son fell. It was Picaud
who killed your dog and your wife’s
parrot, who set fire to your house and
hired the robbers who ruined you. It
is Picaud who caused your wife to die
of grief and made your daughter his
mistress.”

  The speaker snatched off his mask,
and as Loupian recoiled cried:

  7 D

  “ Yes, I am Prosper—and I was
Picaud, and your knowledge dies with
you.”

  As the dagger in his hand buried
itself deep in the heart of Loupian who
sank to his knees without a cry, the
avenger uttered a strange sound, then
turned to go.

  But at that moment a grip of steel
seized him by the throat. Picaud
attacked from behind by a man who
had followed him was soon overcome,
gagged and bound. His assailant
wrapped his cloak about him and pick-
ing him up in strong arms carried him
swiftly away.

  Nothing could exceed the fury and
astonishment of Picaud as bound hand
and foot he was carried away. Surely
he had not fallen into the hands of the
police. A single gendarme would have
summoned others before attempting an
arrest of this kind. His attacker was
a footpad, then. But why should he
be carrying him away, this person who
had been the sole spectator of the mur-
der just committed?

Picaud’s Accomplice

  His head enveloped in his cloak,
Picaud had no idea where he was being
taken. After a time he was flung upon
a cot of some kind. The air of the
place was heavy, and sound was
muffled. The cloak was snatched from
the prisoner’s eyes.

  Overhead was an arch of stone. He
fancied he must be in an abandoned
quarry. He peered at his captor who
sitting on a stone watched him without
saying a word.

   At last his jailer spoke.

  “ Well, Picaud, what name will you
use in future? The one your father
gave you, or the one you assumed when
you came out of prison. Will you call
yourself Abbe Baldini or Prosper the
waiter? I wonder if you’ll be clever
enough to invent a fifth name for your-
self. I hope you’re satisfied with your
revenge now. You must have sold
your soul to a demon or you’d be filled
674

  with horror of what you have done.
You have spent ten years of your life
persecuting three wretched creatures
you might have spared. You have com-
mitted horrible crimes, and now you
are lost forever, since you drew me into
1 •»

the abyss.’’

  “Who are you?’’ asked Picaud.

  “ I am your accomplice, a wretch
who sold you the lives of his friends
for gold. Your gold was my ruin. You
kindled a flame of greed in my soul
which has never gone out. I killed the
jeweler who had cheated me, and I had
to flee with my wife. She died in exile.
I was captured, sentenced, sent to the
galleys. I have endured every misery
and dragged the hateful ball and chain.

Dupe's Vengeance

  “ When I managed to escape I had
but one desire, to find and punish this
Abbe Baldini who had made such an
art of punishment. I hastened to
Naples. No one had heard of him
there. I looked for the grave of Picaud
and learned that Picaud still lived.
How did I learn this, neither you nor
the Pope will ever extort the secret.

  “ Henceforth I devoted myself to
the pursuit of this man who pretended
to be dead, but when I had found him,
already two murders showed his re-
venging hand. Loupian had lost his
home, his children, his wife, his for-
tune. To-night I followed him, I was
going to tell him the whole story, to
warn him, but again you got ahead of
me—some devil must have given you
warning—and I was too late to save
him from you. But I have you—so
we are quits. I am going to pay you
back the evil you have done. I am
going to prove that where we come
from we have arms as well as
memories, Picaud. Now you know
me. I am Antoine Allut.”

  Picaud said nothing. Strange fan-
cies were passing through his mind.

  Carried away by the passion of re-
venge, he had almost forgotten the
vastness of his wealth and the pleasures

  it could give to him. But now his ven-
geance was accomplished, and he might
think of the richness of life before him,
he had fallen into the hands of a man
as lacking in the quality of mercy as
he himself had been.

  As these reflections sped rapidly
through his brain, he bit on his gag
with impotent fury, but gradually he
gathered his wits together. He had
been able to buy this man before, surely
he could buy him again. He could
spare him a hundred thousand francs
out of his sixteen millions.

  And then the state of poverty in
which he had lived to accomplish his
revenge began to pervade his reasoning
powers. Why should he give away
any of his money? He would pretend
he was no better than a beggar and buy
his freedom for a small sum. Once
free he would see that Allut would
disgorge this amount.

  Meanwhile Allut removed the gag.
  “ Where am I ?” asked Picaud/

  “ You are in a place where you need
expect no help nor pity. You are mine,
and mine only to do with as I please.”
Picaud smiled disdainfully. His
former friend said nothing more, but
left him lying on the cot.

Money for Bread

   In a little while he returned and fixed
a wide heavy band of iron about the
prisoner’s waist, secured by a chain to
three large rings embedded in the wall.
That done he set out some food on
a cask on end and began to eat.
Picaud watched him for some time.
“ I am hungry.”

  “ What will you pay for some bread
and water?”

  “ I have no money.”

  “ You have sixteen millions and
more,” said Allut quietly. “ And I
know exactly where they are.”

  With the utmost precision he de-
tailed the various sums invested in
several countries of Europe.

  “You are dreaming,” faltered Pi-
caud aghast.
THE KILLER WHO COULDN'T FORGET

675

  “ Well, dream that you are eating,”
Allut retorted.

  He left the prisoner alone all night,
but returned to eat his breakfast be-
fore him.

  “ Give me something to eat,” asked
Picaud.

  “What will you pay?”

  “ Nothing.”

  “ Have your own way. Wre’ll see
who gives in first.”

  When he returned again with food
Picaud said he would pay a few coppers
for a loaf of bread.

  “ Listen to me,” said Allut after a
time. “ Here are my conditions. I'll
give you a meal twice a day, and you’ll
pay me twenty-five thousand francs for
each meal.”

  Picaud uttered a flood of protests.

  “ That is my last offer,” said Allut
unemotionally. “ Think it over. You
had no mercy for your friends. Why
should I have any?”

  The wretched prisoner passed the
rest of the day and the following night,
torn with hunger and despair, burning
in a hell of his own contriving. His
sufferings were such that he was on
the borderland between life and death
when the merciless Allut saw that he
had pushed his revenge too far. Picaud
was nothing but flesh still sensitive to
physical pain, but incapable of doing
anything to combat it. There was no
use trying to make him speak.

  For a time Allut stood looking down
at the prisoner thinking that if he died,
all hope of appropriating any part of
his immense fortune would be lost to
him.

  Suddenly he bent down and struck
the face of the prisoner. A mocking
expression passed across it. And sud-
denly Allut lost control of himself and
threw himself on the prostrate man,
and only when he was dead did he
come to his senses. Then with a shud-
der of disgust he fled leaving the body
behind him.

  He made for England where he
lived until 1828. In that year, know-

ing his end was within a few hours, he
sent for a French Catholic priest and
made him take down his story and that
of the other unhappy men, to be sent
to the prefect of police of Paris. This
the priest did and the unhappy Allut
signed the document on each page.

  This document was conveyed to the
prefect and placed in the archives or
files, together with a plan showing
where the bones of Picaud would be
found, and the addresses at which Pi-
caud had stayed under his two names.

  Allut said that he had searched, but
had not found any documents or money
of the dead man, but had knowledge
of his enormous fortune.

  “ Even on his deathbed,” said the
priest in his signed letter, “ Antoine
Allut refused to tell me by what means
he had learned the facts set down in
his memoir, or who had informed him
of the doings, crimes and fortune of
Picaud. Only an hour before he died,
and in full possession of his faculties
he said to me: ‘ Father, no man’s belief
can be more alive than mine. I swear
as I am about to face my Maker that

I	both heard and saw a spirit separated
from its body.’ ”

  Picaud’s history has been made im-
mortal in literature. In 1842 the
famous author, Dumas, was looking
round for a skeleton plot to fit the title
Monte Cristo, the name of a rock near
Elba, and he undoubtedly found it in
the archives of this unusual case of
Picaud, though his genius has turned
a crude story into »superb masterpiece.

  Picaud became Dantes, Therese
Mercedes. Loupian turned into Fer-
nand, and Allut to Caderonsse. The
Abbe Baldini was transformed into
Abbe Busoni, and as for the prison, it
is easy to recognize the Chateau d’lf
in the Chateau de l’Oeuf.

  The novel and its original begin al-
most in the same way—the hero’s ap-
proaching marriage, and his betrayal
by a jealous rival, and those who know
“ Monte Cristo ” must have discovered
other close similarities in the two plots.

  “ I don’t suppose he will be,” agreed
Chief Inspector Dransfield placidly.
“ But we can’t afford to take any risks.
That’s where you unofficial folks score.
You needn’t act on everything you
hear. But if we at the Yard neglect
the slightest clew, however unpromis-
ing, we never hear the end of it.”

  Paul grinned. “ You’re an extreme-
ly ill-used body of men,” he scoffed,
regarding the broad, sturdy figure of
his friend with appreciation. “ I can
see you positively fading away under
the strain. Have we time for a drink ?”
Chief Inspector Dransfield glanced at
the illuminated clock overhead.

  “Just time, I tkink,” he decided
promptly.

  It was a slack period at the big Lon-
don railway terminus. The theater
rush was over, and comparative calm
would reign until the cinemas and other
places of amusement disgorged their
hurrying crowds all intent on reaching
their homes with the least possible de-
lay. Nevertheless, there was still
plenty of bustle and confusion on the

WfP'

“ I wonder
if this is Mr.
Baxter," he said

   The two men walked across to a re-
freshment room and ordered drinks.
Despite the fact that Dransfield held a
high official position at Scotland Yard
while Paul Grendon was a private in-
vestigator, they were great friends.
Very frequently they would work to-
gether, each in his own way, on a case;
and such a case had brought them to
the railway station to-night.

  They were hoping without much
conviction that the arrival of the eight
forty-five would bring to a satisfac-
tory conclusion a very involved forgery
investigation in which they were both
interested. Word had come to Drans-
field by an underground route that the
man they wanted would return to Lon-

  Having emptied their glasses, they
strolled back into the station. The
train they were expecting—a boat ex-
press—was due, and a few moments
later it rolled in with a noisy grinding
of brakes.

  From the position they had taken up
they could scrutinize the alighting pas-
sengers as they hurried along the plat-
form. It very quickly became apparent
that the man they sought had not trav-
eled by this train.

  “ Well, we'll have to try again,”
sighed Dransfield philosophically.
“ Let's have another drink.”

  He was turning away when Paul
caught his arm.

  “ Look at the postman, old chappie.
Under that third light. What do you
think’s bitten him?”

  At the front of the train, next to the
engine, was a mail van. At the door
of this which he had just unlocked,
stood a uniformed man, gazing into the
van with startled surprise evident in
his attitude. As the two friends
watched, he banged the door to, and
ran past them down the platform to-
ward the station master’s office.

  “ Something queer in that van,” mur-
mured Paul. “ Any business of ours,
do you think?”

  “ Better wait and see what happens,”
advised Dransfield, lingering his heavy
mustache.

  Very soon the postman came run-
ning back, accompanied by the station
master and a railway policeman. As
they passed, the station master caught
sight of Dransfield and recognized him.

  “ Come along, inspector,” he panted.
“ Just the man we want. The mail
van’s been robbed, and a sorter killed.”
Paul and Dransfield hurried after
the others. The postman unlocked the
door of the mail van again, and stood
aside to allow them all to enter. Then
he climbed in, and pulled the door to
after him, shutting out the crowd that
had already begun to collect.

  There was little sign of any disturb-
ance in the van. The labeled mail bags

were stacked in a row, and hundreds of
letters were neatly arranged in the sort-
ing stand. On a cleared space on the
counter stood a lighted primus stove,
with teapot and cups beside it. The
only indication that anything was
wrong was the body that lay sprawled
in one corner, and the pungent odor of
chloroform that tilled the van with its
sickly sweetness.

  Dransfield bent down to examine the
man, and removed the thick wad of
cotton wool that was tied over his
month and nose with a handkerchief.

  “ He’s not dead,” he said, slipping a
hand inside the man’s waistcoat. “ He’s
only chloroformed. But he looks pret-
ty bad to me. We can't do anything
for him. Better get a doctor, I think.”
The railway policeman departed to
telephone for the doctor. Drans.field
turned to the postman.

  “ Do you know this man ?” he asked,
pointing to the unconscious figure.
“ He’s a sorter?”

  “ Yes, sir. I know him well. Wal-
ter Selwyn’s his name. He’s worked
on this train for years, and I meet it
more often than not.”

  “ But surely he doesn’t travel alone ?”
‘'Oh, no. Ronald Baxter always
works with him.”

  “ And where’s Mr. Baxter now, old
chappie?” drawled Paul, fingering the
handkerchief which had been tied over
Selwyn’s face.

  The postman looked helplessly
round the van. It was clear that he
had been so upset by his discovery of
the one sorter apparently dead that he
had temporarily forgotten the ex-
istence of the other.

  “ He—he ought to be here, sir,” he
stammered. “ Or some one in his place.
Selwyn would not be allowed to come
up alone.”

  “ Perhaps he slipped out of the van
before you arrived?”

  “ He couldn't do that. I was wait-
ing on the platform when the train
came in. I was surprised that no one
opened the door of the mail van. Usu-
678

ally either Selwyn or Baxter jumps out
as soon as the train stops. I couldn’t
see into the van because the windows
are frosted. After knocking and get-
ting no reply, I unlocked the door my-
self.”

  “ You said there had been a rob-
bery?” queried Dransfield. “I don’t
see any signs of it. What makes you
think so?”

  “ This, sir.” The postman laid a
hand on one of the mail bags which lay
open. “ Registered letters and parcels,
sir. It ought to be closed and sealed.
Neither Selwyn nor Baxter had any
authority to touch it.”

  “ But you’re not sure whether any-
thing has gone from it?”

  “ Not without checking the sheets,
sir.”

  “ That can wait. If the bag ought
to be sealed, it’s pretty evident some
one’s been tampering with it.”

  Dransfield’s thoughtful gaze re-
turned to the unconscious man on the
floor and noted something on his wrist.

  “ Hello!” he said. “ His wrist watch
is broken. If it has stopped, it will
give us the time when he was attacked.”
The front of the watch was cracked
and portions of the glass had fallen
away. The hands had stopped at eight
twenty.

  “ Twenty minutes past eight,” said
the inspector unfastening the watch.
“ WThere would the train be at that
time, Mr. Rees?”

  The station master made a rapid cal-
culation.

  “If it was running to schedule,” he
replied, “ it would be about Seven
Beeches, thirty miles this side of Wye-
chester.”

  “ Well, that’s something.” Drans-
field put the watch in his pocket and
rose to his feet again. “ We have evi-
dence that Selwyn was attacked some-
where in the neighborhood of Seven
Beeches. Now what’s happened to
Baxter? There’s no place here where
he could be hidden.”

  “ He may have been thrown out of

the van,” suggested the station master.
“ In any case, I’d better telephone down
the line to have a thorough search
made.”

  “ 1 wish you would, please,” agreed
Dransfield; and the station master hur-
ried off.

  Looking about for any further in-
formation, Dransfield discovered an
empty bottle which had rolled behind a
mail bag. He picked it up gingerly,
avoiding finger-marking the glass, and
sniffed at it.

  “ Wre may learn something from
this,” he said, wrapping the bottle in a
handkerchief. “ It’s had chloroform
in it.”

  Paul Grendon was wandering around
the van, keen eyes searching in every
corner. He tried the door at the rear
end of the van, which was intended to
link it up with the next carriage if de-
sired, and found that it was unfastened.

  “ Perhaps Mr. Baxter went out this
way,” he suggested. “ I suppose this
door ought to be locked.”

  “ Yes, sir. Regulations are strict
about that.”

  “ Would either of the sorters have a
key?”

  “ There’s one kept in the van, I think.
For use in any emergency.”

  “ That’s not very hopeful,” mur-
mured Paul.

  He opened the door and looked out.
The van was not connected by the usu-
al collapsible passage to the next car-
riage. In fact, this was of an old type,
containing no corridor. It had no door
corresponding with that of the mail
van. There was no means by which any
one could pass from one carriage to the
other.

  “ Must have been difficult either to
enter or leave this van while the train
was on the move,” he said thoughtfully.

  “ Some one might have swung along
the footboards,” suggested Inspector
Dransfield.

  “ Possibly. But the postman says the
door at the side was locked. There’s
the top of the train, of course.” Paul
DEATH ON THE 8:45

679

looked up. “ Hello! Hello! What’s
this?”

   Projecting' from the top of the next
carriage was a leg, with its foot caught
in one of the climbing rungs.

  “ I wonder if this is Mr. Baxter?”
he said.

  He climbed up between the two car-
riages. On the top of the one behind
the mail van, the body of a man lay
sprawled on his face.

   Paul flashed his electric torch. The
man was dead; and the back of his
head, battered to a pulp, was sufficient
evidence of the cause.

  Something lodged among the accu-
multed dust in the angle between a bat-
ten and the ventilator glinted as the
light caught it. Paul picked up one or
two small pieces of thin glass. Whis-
tling tunelessly between his teeth, he
stowed them carefully away in his
pocket. Then, aided by the other two,
he lowered the limp figure down.

  As soon as the body was laid on the
floor of the van, the postman recog-
nized it.

   “ It’s Baxter!” he cried. “ It’s poor
old Baxter.”

  “ Looks as though he was after the
thieves,” said Dransfield. “ But poor
devil! That head! Whatever could—”
“ A bridge,” replied Paul briefly.
“ He was caught as the train went un-
der a bridge. It would have swept him
clear away if his foot hadn’t become
entangled in the rung.”

   “ I expect you’re right.”

   “ There’s no doubt about it. Strange
that he was so careless, isn’t it? Of
course he was facing the wrong way.
But he must have known every inch of
the line.”

   “ Well, if he was all flurried and ex-
cited, chasing after the thieves—”

  “ I’m not sure that he was chasing
after the thieves.” Paul picked up the
handkerchief which had held the chlo-
roformed pad over Selwyn’s face, and
pointed to one corner of it. “ There’s
something to think about here. Look
at it!”

  Plainly written in indelible ink on
the handkerchief was the name “ R.
Baxter.”

  “By crimes!” exclaimed Dransfield.
“ That alters the whole thing, doesn’t
it?”

  “ I believe it does, old chappie.”

  “ It means that Baxter himself was
the thief. He chloroformed Selwyn,
took what he wanted and—”

II

THE inspector’s exposition of his
theory was cut short by the re-
turn of the station master, ac-
companied by a dapper, emotionless po-
lice surgeon. The situation was briefly
explained to them. After examining
Baxter, the surgeon definitely agreed
with Paul about the bridge.

  “ I’m sure nothing else could have
caused such injuries,” he said emphat-
ically. “ The back of his skull is
smashed in like an empty egg shell.
And his leg’s broken by the force with
which he was thrown back on the car-
riage behind. Poor devil! Anyhow,
he’d never know that anything had hit
him.”

  He turned his attention to Selwyn
who lay breathing heavily, just begin-
ning to recover from the effects of the
anaesthetic.

  “ This fellow’s lucky to be alive,” he
muttered, examining the man’s pupils.
“ He’s had a pretty hefty dose. How-
ever, you got to him just in time. We’ll
soon have him round; and he’ll be no
worse for his little trip into dream-
land.”

  Paul watched with interest while the
surgeon prepared a hypodermic injec-
tion and deftly inserted it into Sel-
wyn’s arm. Soon the man’s pale, studi-
ous face began to twitch, his thin lips
to writhe and twist convulsively.

  Inspector Dransfield, after searching
Baxter’s pockets without result, was
giving instructions to the station mas-
ter and the postman. Paul squatted on
the floor and helped' the surgeon in his
efforts to rouse Selwyn.
680

DETECTIVE FICTION WEEKLY

  The man was now near to conscious-
ness. He was babbling the usual inco-
herent phrases which escape any one re-
covering from an anaesthetic. As soon
as his eyes opened, Paul propped him in
a sitting position against a mail bag.

  “ He’s all right now,” said the sur-
geon, after awhile. “ He’ll be able to
answer any questions you care to put
to him.”

  Dransfield stepped forward and knelt
down beside the sorter, gazing pity-
ingly at the pale face and trembling
lips.

  “ You’ve had a rough time, Selwyn,”
he said kindly. “ The doctor says
you're lucky to be alive. We want to
catch whoever was responsible for
doping you, or we wouldn’t bother you
just now. Can you tell us anything
about it ?”

  Walter Selwyn gazed at him stupid-
ly. Then his blinking eyes cleared as
recollection came back to him.

  “ I don’t know anything,” he said
feebly. “ I don’t know anvthing at
all.”

  From the position he had taken up
outside the man’s circle of vision, Paul
watched him intently.

  “ We don’t expect you to know
much,” Dransfield went 011. “ But
surely you can tell us who chlo-
roformed you?”

  “ I wish I could,” replied Selwyn,
fingering his pale face, which was
burned and blistered by the contact of
the chloroform. “ I’d like to see some
one suffer for this outrage. But who-
ever it was caught me from behind.”

  His wandering gaze fell 011 the body
of Baxter, and his weak eyes opened
wide in horror.

   “ That’s Baxter, isn’t it?” he gasped.
“ Is he—is he—”

  “Yes, lie’s dead,” answered Drans-
field. “ But don’t worry yourself
about that now. Just tell us what you
can.”

  Selwyn withdrew his frightened
gaze from his fellow sorter with an
effort.

  “ The devils!” he muttered. “ I
only wish I could set you on the track
of whoever’s done that. But 1 never
saw anybody. It was done too quick-
ly and silently. All I know about it is
this:

  “ I noticed nothing unusual until
after we had passed through Wye-
chester. We usually have a cup of tea
about that time, and I broke off work
to make it.”

  “ You didn’t hear any one come into
the van?”

  “ No. Of course the train makes
plenty of noise, especially when it is
passing through the deep cuttings this
side of Wyechester. But one gets used
to it, you know; and if there had been
any sound out of the ordinary, I think
I should have heard it.

  “ I got out the teapot and stove. I
had just lighted the stove when some
one seized me from behind and pressed
a stinking cloth on my face. I couldn’t
see and I couldn’t breathe. I struggled
as hard as I could, but the beastly
chloroform choked me. The train
seemed to be going at a hundred miles
an hour, and I felt my senses leaving
me. And then I knew nothing more
until I wakened up just now.”

  “ And lucky you were to waken up!”
exclaimed the police surgeon. “ An-
other few minutes with that pad on
your face would have done you in for
good.”

  “ Was Baxter chloroformed, too?”
asked Selwyn, his water}’- gaze return-
ing to the figure on the floor. “ Poor
old Baxter! We’ve worked together
on this train for—”

  “ You needn’t waste too much sym-
pathy on Baxter,” interrupted Drans-
field. “ When we came in we found
his handkerchief tied round your face.”
“Baxter’s handkerchief?” Selwvn’s
eyes opened wide again. “ Oh, surely
you don’t mean that lie—”

  “ We don’t know yet. But it looks
most likely that it was Baxter who
chloroformed you, afterward robbing
the mail, and being accidentally killed
DEATH ON THE 8:45

himself as he was making his get-
away.”

  “ Oh, I’ll never believe that! Baxter
was a good sort—a pal. He’d never
do a thing like that. Don’t believe it.”
“Well, well! Don’t distress your-
self about it at present. We shall know
all that happened in due course. He'd
no stolen packages on him, so perhaps
he didn’t do it.” Dransfield rose to
his feet. “ I say, Paul, would you—”
He stopped short, looking round the
van ip surprise. For Paul Grendon
had disappeared.

Ill

IT was close on midnight when the
missing detective strolled into Chief
Inspector Dransfield’s private office
at Scotland Yard.

  “ Hello!” he said cheerfully.
“ Thought I’d find you here. I’ve just
called to collect those two cigars.” He
helped himself from the box on the
desk. “ Thinking of going home yet?”
“ Yes, I’ve just finished,” replied
Dransfield. “Take a pocketful while
you’re at it, you robber. What the
deuce did you do that vanishing trick
for?”

  “ I wanted to get acquainted,”
grinned Paul.

“ Acquainted ? With whom ?”

  “ The gentleman who so cleverly
robbed the mail van on the eight forty-
five, old chappie.”

  Dransfield stared. “ What the devil
do you mean, Paul? Are you pulling
my leg?”

  “Not at all. I hope to introduce
you to him in a few days. But don’t
ask me any more questions now if you
love me. I want to know how things
stand.”

  Knowing his friend as he did, the
inspector sighed and stifled his curios-
ity. Experience had taught him that
Paul Grendon would not divulge any-
thing about his progress in a case until
he could deliver the goods neatly par-
celed and sealed.

  “ There are no new developments,”

he said. “ The chloroform bottle
wasn't anj' help. There were no finger-
prints 011 it; the thief had been too
careful for that.”

  “Hard luck,” murmured Paul.

  “ I put Rodgers onto the case as soon
as possible,” Dransfield went on.

“ Though, of course, the post office
have their own men for this kind of
thing. We discovered that several
packages are missing from the regis-
tered mail bag. The thief knew what
he was doing. We can’t ascertain their *
value for certain yet, of course. But
letters to the Bank of England often
contain bank notes; while those sent to
addresses in Hatton Garden are fre-
quently carrying diamonds.”

  “ Quite so. And the fact that the
thief knew what to take seems to in-
dicate that he had inside knowledge of
the contents of the registered mail
bag.”^

  “Yes, that’s a strong point. So far
as I can see, the whole business is
pretty well cut and dried, and I can’t
imagine what sort of a track you’re
following. It looks pretty clear to
me that Baxter was the thief. Other-
wise, what was he doing while his pal
was being chloroformed? I’m sure
no stranger could have entered the van
and caught Selwyn unawares, while
Baxter had every opportunity. He
knew what was in the mail bag, and
helped himself to what he wanted.
Then he climbed on the top of the
train— By the by, they’ve found the
bridge that killed him.”

  “You asked them to search for
that ?”

  “ Yes. I thought we’d better verify
our conclusions. The bridge is at Seven
Beeches, about thirty miles this side of
Wyechester. Part of the stonework im-
mediately above the line shows fresh
bloodstains and a few hairs.”

“ Pretty quick wrork, Dransfield.”
“Well, there aren’t many bridges
over that part of the line. And the
station master wakened up every one
down to Wyechester, so there have
682

DETECTIVE FICTION WEEKLY

been plenty of searchers. It fits in with
Sehvyn’s story and the evidence of the
broken watch, doesn’t it ? Baxter was
killed as he was escaping. He met his
punishment very soon after his crime.”
“ What about his loot—the packages
he stole?”

  “ That’s where I’m all at sea.” The
inspector tugged thoughtfully at his
heavy mustache. “ I suppose there
are two alternatives. Either he had a
confederate somewhere on the line to
whom he threw the spoil, or he threw
it from the train at some particular
point where he could find it later. In
the first case, we may never see it
again; in the second—well, a thorough
search ought to bring it to light.”
“Good luck in the search!” Paul
Grendon rose and reached for his hat.
There was a gleam of amusement in
his gray eyes. “I’ll be off now.”

  “ I’m going your way, Paul.”

  “ But I’m not going my way. I’ve
a taxi outside to take me in the op-
posite direction.”

  “ What the deuce is your game
now ?” queried Dransfield. “ Why
aren’t you going home?”

  “ I want another interview with
him,” replied Paul.

  “Another interview with whom?
Dammit, man, don’t talk in riddles.”

  “ The riddle is solved, old chappie.
I’m going for a talk with the clever
criminal who robbed the mail van—
and murdered Ronald Baxter.”

IV

TWO days went by, during which
Chief Inspector Dransfield saw
no more of his friend. And in
those two days, the “ Mystery of the
8.45,” as the papers called it, grew to
worrying proportions.

  It was generally accepted that
Ronald Baxter was the thief. Every-
thing seemed to point that way, and
no other theory had been put forward.
The mystery was—what had he done
with the stolen mail, no trace of which
had been discovered?

  The value of the missing packages
was too great for the matter to be
hushed up. It transpired that bank
notes, easily negotiable securities, and
diamonds to the value of thousands of
pounds had been stolen. And the press,
delighting in the mystery, made things
very uncomfortable for every one con-
cerned in the case.

  If a man was killed two or three
minutes after committing a robbery, it
should not be a very difficult matter to
recover what he had stolen. In the
opinion of the press, the case was an
excellent example of the well known
ineptitude of the police. Public in-
terest was aroused and kept at fever
heat. Each paper had a “ Special
Commissioner” who aired his own
views and theories. Unofficial treasure
hunts were organized. Reporters made
desperate attempts to interview poor
Selwyn, who was under medical care,
and were only kept at bay by the ener-
getic, incorruptible friend who nursed
him.

  The case was not in Inspector Drans-
field’s department, which was chiefly
concerned with organization, so that
the press criticisms did not affect him
personally. Yet he grew very un-
easy about it. He had an uncomfort-
able idea, due to what Paul Grendon
had said, that perhaps his colleagues
were working on the wrong lines.

  He was anxious to see Paul again,
and drag some sort of explanation out
of him. But he could not get in touch
with his friend. When he telephoned,
Mrs. Grendon informed him that her
husband was out of town, and that was
all she knew about it.

  He was relieved, therefore, on the
third day to hear Paul’s voice at the
other end of the wire on a trunk call.

  “ I’ve been trying to get hold of you,
Paul,” he complained. “Where the
deuce have you been?”

  “ I’m speaking from Wyechester. A
most interesting little town, with many
evidences of early Roman occupation.
I want you to join me down here.”
DEATH ON THE 8:45

683

  “ I’m very busy. What do you want
me for?”

  “Just a little fishing, old chappie.”

  “ Fishing! Look here, Paul—”

  “ Haven’t time to argue. These trunk
calls cost money, you know. I’ll be
waiting for you at the White Swan,
Wyechester. Incidentally, there’ll be a
drink, waiting, too, if you’re here be-
fore seven. By, by, old chappie. Don’t
fail me.”

  The receiver slammed, and there was
silence on the wire.

  Inspector Dransfield swore vigor-
ously. Nevertheless, he caught the first
train down to Wyechester, and found
his friend waiting for him in the
lounge at the White Swan.

  “ What the dickens is all this about,
Paul?” he asked irritably, dropping
into a chair.

  “ I’m not quite sure, yet,” replied
Paul Grendon imperturbably. “But I
believe we’re going to have some fun.”
He beckoned to a waiter. “ Tust time
for a drink before we go, I think.”

  “Go where?” queried Dransfield.

  “ Fishing, old chappie. Two Mar-
tinis, waiter.”

  It was evident that he did not intend
explaining the situation, and the in-
spector shrugged his shoulders in resig-
nation. But he did not regret that he
had come. He> knew his friend well
enough to realize that there was some-
thing important in the wind.

  Their drinks finished, they left the
hotel and strolled along the main thor-
oughfare of the quiet country town. It
was now quite dark, and when they
had left the shopping area behind, they
found the dimly lit streets almost de-
serted.

  Walking more quickly now, they
soon found themselves in a muddy, ill
paved lane.

  It was not long before they reached
a narrow river, flowing silent and
mysterious under the stars, where the
lane ended in a footbridge. Paul
turned aside and led the way through
some cultivated fields which fringed

the water until he reached a single span
bridge which carried the railway line
over the stream.

  “ We’ll wait here,” he said, drawing
his bewildered companion into a black
corner under the bridge. “ This is not
much of a river, but I believe there’s
some curious fish in it. Don’t make any
noise, please. I hope we shall do our
fishing by proxy.”

  A faint inkling of what was happen-
ing came at last to the inspector.

  “The stolen postal packets?” he
gasped. “They’re in the water?”

  “If I’m not mistaken,” agreed Paul.
“ Shut up now. I don’t suppose our
fisherman will be long.”

  It was very quiet under the bridge.
The two friends waited in silence,
squatting on their heels against the
wall. Occasionally a train roared over
their heads, momentarily lighting up
the deserted banks of the river.

  Long minutes dragged slowly past.
From time to time Paul glanced at the
illuminated dial of his watch. They
dare not smoke, lest the glow or the
smell should betray their presence.
They grew stiff and cramped through
keeping their limbs in the same
position.

  “ I’m sorry,” breathed Paul, when
an hour had passed. “ I expected him
here before this.”

  The vigil continued. Dransfield’s ex-
citement began to fade. As time passed
without anything happening, he came
to the conclusion that Paul Grendon
had made a mistake.

  Then, suddenly, his body tensed.
He had caught sight of a figure ap-
proaching over the nearest field. A
nudge from his companion warned him
that Paul had seen the man too. They
sat motionless, watching him approach,
scarcelv daring to breathe.

  Their eyes had grown accustomed
to the darkness., and by the faint light
of the stars, they could follow his
progress quite easily. He advanced cau-
tiously, continually glancing about him,
until he reached a point on the bank
684

DETECTIVE FICTION WEEKLY

only a few yards away from where
they sat. There he stopped, and
quickly undressed.

  His nude body gleamed pale against
the darker background. After stoop-
ing, apparently to hide his clothes
under a bush, he slipped soundlessly
into the river.

  His movements here were not so
visible, but the watchers could still
catch occasional glimpses of his head,
a dark smudge on the water, as he
swam about. His movements seemed
to be quite aimless. He swam here
and there, without any obvious pur-
pose, to all appearances merely enjoy-
ing the exercise.

  Soon, however, he disappeared be-
neath the surface. Almost a minute
passed before the watchers saw his
head again, only to lose sight of it once
more.

  “ He’s caught his fish,” Paul mur-
mured in his companion’s ear. “ He's
diving for it.’’

  Almost immediately the swimmer
appeared again, making for the bank.
When he climbed out they could see
that he carried a bulky parcel under
one arm.

  Paul nudged Dransfield and sprang
to his feet.

  “ Good evening, old chappie,” he
said, stepping quickly forward. “Queer
uniform for a postal official you’re
wearing.”

  The swimmer stared at the two
figures that had suddenly appeared
from nowhere.

  “ Wh-who are you?” he stammered.

  “ I’m nobody,” replied Paul cheer-
fully. “ My friend here is Chief In-
spector Dransfield from Scotland
Yard.”

  The other man shivered. There was
nothing else he could do. He was
naked and defenseless. He could not
even run away.

  “ I was frightened something like
this would happen, gentlemen,” he said
quietly. “ But I had to take the risk.
It’s no use trying to bluff you. I’m

done, and I rather think I'm glad.
You’ll find all the stolen mail in that
parcel. May I put my clothes on?”

    I seem to know your voice,” mut-
tered Dransfield. “ Who the deuce
are you?”

  He flashed an electric torch; and
almost cried out in surprise as the light
fell on the pale face and weak, blink-
ing eyes of Walter Selwyn.

V

  YOU see,” said Paul, settling him-
self in the corner of a reserved
compartment in the London ex-
press, “ I didn’t wrant Selwyn to see me
in the mail van, so I stood behind him
while he told his tale, and slipped out
as soon as he had finished. I had got
his address from the postman, and I
wanted to arrive there before him.”
Walter Selwyn sat in the opposite
corner, gazing out into the night. In-
spector Dransfield looked at his friend
in surprise.

  “You suspected him so soon?” be
asked.

  “ I didn’t suspect—I knewr,” replied
Paul. “ There was no doubt in my
mind that he was the culprit. What I
didn’t know was how he had disposed
of his loot.

  “ That was why I wanted to get to
his lodgings before him, and take
rooms there myself. Finding me there
when he arrived, even though I had
only just come, he was not likely to
think that I had any connection with
what had happened. You never
guessed, did you, Selwyn?”

  Selwyn glanced round. Then, with-
out speaking, turned back to his win-
dow again.

  “But what was the idea, Paul?”
queried Dransfield, after awhile.
“ What line were you working on?”

  “ Well, I had evidence that Selwyn
was lying. It was obvious that the
whole business had been very carefully
planned. He had planted his loot in
some safe hiding place, and probably
intended to let it remain there until
DEATH ON THE 8:45

685

things had quietened down, then quick-
ly unearth it and disappear. My idea
was to bluff him into betraying his
hiding place. Then there would be
enough evidence to hang him.

  “ I made friends with him by inter-
fering when the reporters came, and
keeping them away from him. He was
glad enough to have me sit with him,
and warn them off. So there I was,
nursing my criminal, trying to think of
some way to bluff him.

  “ He’s not the type of man who
would take any one into his confidence,
so I didn’t believe that he had a con-
federate. Wondering what I myself
should do if I had to throw a parcel
from a moving train into a place where
it would be safely hidden, I could think
of nothing that would suit my purpose
so well as a river.

  “As I sat discussing the mystery
with him the next day, I put forward
this theory as a possible way in which
Baxter might have acted. I could see
anxiety spring into his eyes, and knew
I was on the right track. So I carried
matters a stage further. I told him
that, according to the reporters who
were continually calling, the police had
come to the same conclusion as my-
self, and had commenced dragging all
canals and rivers over which the rail-
way passed after leaving Wyechester.

  “ This put the wind up him thor-
oughly—didn’t it, Selwyn? If the
police carried their activities a little
further afield they would find the loot,
and all his trouble would be wasted.
He decided to recover the stolen
packages at the first opportunity and
hide them somewhere else.

  “ To-day the doctor took the band-
ages from his face and he was allowed
to go out. He told me he was going
to visit a friend. I shadowed him to
the station and heard him take a ticket
for Wyechester. I came down by car,
and beat him by half an hour. T noticed
that the railway crossed the river just
outside the town, and felt that my job
was nearly finished.

  “ I knew he wouldn’t attempt any-
thing until after dark, so there was
plenty of time to send word to you,
Dransfield. I had an idea you’d like
to be in at the death.”

  “ It was jolly decent of you, Paul,”
said the inspector. “You seem to
have caught us all napping. But I
must confess that I don’t see it yet.
What about Baxter?” He pointed
toward the silent prisoner. “ Did he—”
“ Yes, Selwyn killed him.”

  ‘‘ I didn’t!” snapped Selwyn, sud-
denly turning. “ You caught me red-
handed with the mail, and I can’t deny
that. But I won’t have murder hung
onto me. I didn’t kill Baxter.”

  “ Selwyn killed him.” repeated Paul,
ignoring the outburst. “ It was part
of an exceedingly well thought out
scheme, which had been brewing in his
mind for months. And the essence of
this scheme was that no suspicion
should be allowed to fall on himself.

  “ The best way of insuring this was
to throw it on some one else. That’s
why poor Baxter had to go. He was
knocked out some time before the
train passed through Wyechester by
that piece of iron piping we found in
the waterproof bag. Correct me if I
go wrong, won’t you, Selwyn ?”

  “ It’s all wrong,” muttered the pris-
oner sullenly. “ I didn’t kill Baxter.”
“Well, you can tell another story to
the jury if you like. I prefer to be-
lieve this. After Baxter was knocked
out. the packages from the registered
mail bag were placed in a waterproof
bag along with the bloodstained piping.
You’ve seen the bag. The numerous
little floats attached to it were cal-
culated to come nearly to the surface
of the water and make it easy for a
swimmer to find it without searching
all over the river bed.

  “ The bag was dropped into the
river as the train crossed the bridge.
Then Selwyn turned his attention to
Baxter.

  “ He laid aside the unconscious
man’s handkerchief, dragged him to
686

DETECTIVE FICTION WEEKLY

the end of the car and unlocked the
door. If he had simply thrown the
body onto the line, suspicion - might
still rest on himself. He wanted it to
appear certain that Baxter had been
accidentally killed after robbing the
mail. Also to hide the wound made
by the iron piping.

  “ He got the limp body onto his
shoulders and, with the greatest dif-
ficulty, managed to climb the rungs of
the next car. Took some courage to
do that, Dransfield, when a slip meant
certain death. However, he got up in
time. He knew the train was nearing
a bridge. Holding the unconscious
man under the arms, he hoisted him
up with a great effort so that the stone-
work of the bridge crushcd his skull
and threw him forward onto the top
of the carriage behind.”

  “ I didn’t do any such thing,” cried
Selwyn. “ I’m not a murderer. I
wouldn’t have the nerve.’’

  “ Y'ou’ve plenty of nerve, Selwyn.
More than is good for you. It took
courage to climb up that carriage. It
took courage to fasten that chloro-
formed pad over your face, carefully
avoiding making any finger-prints on
the bottle. You must have known you
were risking death there.”

  “A likely story, isn’t it?” sneered
Selwyn. “ I don’t know who you ex-
pect to believe it.”

  There was a long silence. Walter
Selwyn sat staring out of the window
again. Inspector Dransfield smoked
thoughtfully, watching his friend.

  “You’re sure about all this, Paul, I
suppose?” he said at last.

  “It follows, doesn’t it? If Selwyn
robbed the mail he must have killed
Baxter. And that iron piping tells a
pretty definite story.”

  “ But you didn’t know about that.
Why did you suspect him in fhe first
place ?”

  “ That handkerchief with the name
on it. The only reason it was used
was to throw suspicion on Baxter.
Baxter himself would never have been
so foolish as to use his own. Baxter,
knowing the line as he did, would never
have been careless enough to be caught
by that bridge. These two points
made me suspect Selwyn from the
beginning. And, in addition, I found
definite proof that he had killed
Baxter.”

  “ You’re lying!” cried Selwyn.
“ You’re trying to bluff me again!”
Paul drew a little paper packet from
his pocket and handed it to Dransfield.

   “ Bits of his broken watch glass,” he
said. “ I think you’ll find they’ll fit to-
gether with the pieces you have.” He
turned suddenly on Selwyn: “ Perhaps
you’ll explain how these came to be
lying on the carriage top with Baxter?”
Selwyn stared at the incriminating
fragments. His face blanched and he
shivered.

  “ I—I don’t know,” he stammered.
“ I can’t think—”

  “Well, I’ll tell you! Your wrist
watch was broken up there. When
the impact of the bridge snatched
Baxter from your grasp. At eight
twenty precisely. The official time for
the train to pass Seven Beeches. The
time at which your watch stopped.”

  “ Damn you!” snarled Selwyn,
jumping to his feet. “ You’ve got me!
I thought every detail was perfectly
planned. And you’ve got me! But I
won’t live to—”

  He made a sudden dash for the
carriage door. But Paul Grendon was
there before him.

   “ Not that way, old chappie,” he said
quietly, helping Dransfield to handcuff
the struggling prisoner. “ What was
good enough for Baxter is too good for
you. You’ve had your fun. You
mustn’t try to avoid paying the price.”

 The Body of Sir Henry

              When All His Suspicions Have Been Ex-
              plained Away, Maclver Arrests a Murderer

By Augustus Muir

I HAD been so engrossed in Mac-
Iver’s talk that my cigarette had
burned right down to my fingers
and, cursing it heartily, I hurled the
wretched thing into the fire.

  Maclver laughed.

  “ That reminds me of a queer thing
that happened to me once,” he said, ly-
ing back in his chair and smiling at me
out of his keen gray eyes—the shrewd-
est eyes I think I have ever looked into.
On Mactver’s face are clearly writ-
ten the qualities that have helped him
to rise from the ranks of the police
force to be one of the really big swells

at Scotland Yard. I count it worth
losing five hours’ sleep any night to
hfear the man tell of some of the strange
people he has run r p against.

  “ That reminds me,” he repeated,
“ of a mighty queer thing that hap-
pened to me in the Border country soon
after I joined the force.” Maclver
pronounces the word “ force ” as
though he were speaking of the most
marvelous affair in all Christendom; it
is his only vanity.

  “ The case,” he continued, “ has to
do with the most beautiful woman I’ve
ever seen. I’m mebbe no great judge.

DETECTIVE FICTION WEEKLY

I certainly never saw the woman yet
that made me feel like—like, well,
what’s called falling in love. But if
ever a woman made me melt with the
sheer witchery of her, it was Lucille
Vallandri. Aye, and she was a devil,
yon young woman. A beautiful devil.
She should have hung; I’m not joking.
She missed it by the skin of her teeth.
I’ll tell you all about her—and the burn-
ing cigarette that cost the life of the
man whose mistress she was at the
time—no; the facts never came out. He
cheated the gallows before they even
got him the length of trial; he kept
poisQ^ ready in his wrist-watch.”

  As far as I was concerned (went on
Maclver) it began one night when I
was on duty at Battlekirk. I had only
been in the district about a couple of
months, ancl I used to wonder how
many years it would be before any-
thing happened to break the awful mo-
notony in yon out-of-the-way corner of
the Borders. I can mind how the rain
was pelting down that night, and the
wind from the Cheviots lashed round
you like a whip. It seemed that every-
body else in Teviotdale was in bed ex-
cept myself, and just because I had
been fool enough, as I thought, to join
the force, in preference to trudging be-
hind a plow on my father’s small hold-
ing in the Merse, I had to be out there
on duty—aye, and shivering under a
doorway with the rain trickling down
my neck, and wishing to God somebody
would break into the Clydesdale Bank
or commit a murder, just to stir things
up a bit.

  I nearly gave three cheers when I
saw a white smudge of light show up in
the distance. It was a motor car coming
down from the North. So I wasn’t
the only body in Scotland out in the
storm that night! It cheered me up to
watch the light getting nearer, and soon
a big car went rushing past the cross-
roads. Then I heard the brakes go on
and the tires grinding and grinding on
the rough surface till the car stopped.

  It started to reverse. It was a big
yellow limousine, I could see from the
shelter of my doorway, and a man was
leaning out of the driving seat. He
turned the car in to the side, so that
his headlights shone on the signpost.
At this, I stepped out of the doorway
and hurried over to hiror

  “ Can I help you?” I asked. I no-
ticed that he wasn’t dressed like a
chauffeur, but had a cloth cap pulled
down over his face.

  “Are we near Battlekirk?” he in-
quired, and I told him he was already in
Battlekirk.

  “ Is it far to Milne Easter?” he said.
“ Three miles, sir,” I replied. “ And
Milne Wester is five miles down this
other road,” I added, for it struck me
that Milne Wester, a decent-sized vil-
lage with a lot of gentlefolk living in
it, was the place he really wanted to get
to, Milne Easter being only a few poor
cottages with no houses of any size near
it at all.

  But it seemed to be Milne Easter he
wanted right enough. He thanked me,
and began to turn back to the south
road again. As if he’d had an after-
thought, he leaned out and said:
“How many miles is Newcastle?”

  I	told him, but I had a queer feeling,
by the way he spoke, that he didn’t care
a rap how far Newcastle was. And
then I saw something that took my
breath away, and left me standing on
that road as stiff as the white signpost
beside me.

  In turning the nose of the car, the
headlamps had blazed into the shop
window five or six yards away. The
light was reflected back, just as if it
had shone against a mirror. The driver
was half-blinded. He swore good-na-
turedly, and swung the wheel quickly
round. But not before I had seen into
the back of the car.

  A woman sat there, with dark furs
round her face, and I’ll never forget
her expression. It was one of un-
speakable horror. Beside her, a man
lay huddled stiffly back on the cushions.

THE BODY OF SIR HENRY

689

Right up to his chin he was covered
with a traveling rug. He was elderly
and had thick gray hair. His skin was
chalk white, and his eyes were wide
open and staring straight upward. The
light didn’t seem to dazzle them. It
would have dazzled mine if I hadn’t
had my back to it. But one quick
glimpse at him was enough to tell me
the important thing. The man was
dead.

  In a flash the woman’s hand came
out from her furs and pulled the trav-
eling rug up over his face, from which
it had apparently slipped down. The
car swerved away from the shop win-
dow, and the reflected light snapped
out.

  The limousine gathered speed and
was gone. I stood there with my head
buzzing round as I watched its shape
getting less and less against the glow
of its lights ahead of it. And then the
little red tail-light moved around the
bend and disappeared.

II

I TELL you I could have kicked my-
self right over the crossroads and

  back again. I hadn’t even had the
gumption to cast an eye on its number-
plate. A fine fool I’d look when I re-
ported this to the sergeant, as I’d have
to do—and I was to meet him in a little'
less than half an hour’s time.

  But Sergeant Gailes just laughed at
me.

 “A dead man?” he said. “You
young fellows read ower much o’ that
sensational trash nowadays. Drunk
mebbe, but not dead. Na, na, Maclver.
I’m thinking ye were ower dazzled by
the lights yoursel’ to see very clear.
Na.”

  “ I’m sure the man’s mention of
Newcastle was just a pure blind,” I de-
clared.

  Sergeant Gailes grunted, and shook
some of the rain from the top of his
flat-peaked cap. “ Ye’d better keep
your tongue between your teeth about
it,” he advised. “ That kind o’ thing
8 D

is no’ likely to do ye any good wi’ the
inspector at Teviothead. Ye’ll be re-
porting that ye’ve seen a ghost next,
laddie. Na, na.”

  But I wasn’t satisfied. As I cycled
back toward Battlekirk, I kept chewing
the matter over. It was just before I
got to the main road that an idea struck
me, and instead of going home to bed
I turned south toward Milne Easter.
I had suddenly remembered that about
a mile from the village was a big house
called Black Weir—in fact, the only
house of any size round about. If that
car was really making for Milne East-
er, Black Weir was probably the actual
destination. Then I remembered some-
thing else. The house wras shut up. It
belonged to an old bachelor, Sir Henry
Elliston-Stewart. I didn’t know him
by sight, but in the couple of months
I’d been stationed at Battlekirk I had
heard plenty about him. He lectured
to antiquarian societies, and was sup-
posed to have a wonderful collection of
antique Scottish and French jewels. He
was wealthy, of course, and they called
him half-daft—seemingly he thought
nothing of sending all his servants
home on holiday for three months, and
going away on his travels, with Black
Weir House shut up. Aye, and it was
shut now. When I remembered this,
the only thing that kept me going on
was sheer dourness. The chances were
that I was on a wild-goose chase.

  I got off my cycle, and went for-
ward to the big iron gates. They were
padlocked. So that finished it.

  My spirits were away down in my
boots—along with a lot of rain-water
—and, turning back, I started to
mount. But I nearly sprawled across
my machine in surprise. Curving in
from the main road to the avenue were
the fresh marks of motor car tires.

  It took me about two minutes to
wheel my cycle along the road, hide it
in a ditch, and climb over the high
stone dyke beyond the lodge. The
lodge, I knew, was unoccupied—and
had been since the head gardener left
690

DETECTIVE FICTION WEEKLY

—so there was no good trying to seek
information there.

  The night was desperately black.
Rather than risk losing my way by tak-
ing the short cut through the woods, I
preferred to trudge the quarter of a
mile of twisting avenue. And a long
quarter of a mile it was.

  Black Weir House, when I got to
it, was the most dismal-looking thing
you ever saw—a great rambling place
with turrets and crow-step gables, and
not a chink of light showing anywhere.
And then, beside the doorway, I made
out the shape of a motor car. I had
been right about the ti re-marks, but it
remained to be seen whether I had been
right in jumping to the conclusion that
I was on the track of trouble—trouble,
I mean, for other folk.

   I walked round the car, and went up
the steps to the front door. I was
about to switch on my lantern when
my eye caught a slit of light in a win-
dow on my left. The curtains had been
pulled close, but not close enough. By
craning out over the stone balustrade,
I was able to see into the room.

   A lamp stood on a table, and beside
it was a leather suitcase with the lid ly-
ing back. There were also two bunches
of keys, one of them on a long chain.

   And then I saw' a detail that gave me
a jar.

   I had run into the real thing at last!
I had been wishing that something
would happen to break the monotony
of life. Well, it looked like being
broken into half a hundred bits now!
For a door stood open in the opposite
wall of the room with another small
but very thick door of steel behind it.
I could see enough to tell me that I
was looking into an open safe.

  I thought of Sergeant Gailes, and
howr long I would take to get hold of
him. Hours, probably. That was no
good. If I was going to do anything.
I had to do it myself—and at once. I
wasn’t afraid of rough work—I w'as
a match for most of the brawny lads
of the Borders—but I was helpless

against firearms. However, I’d have
to risk that.

  Then I got a brain-wave. Whatever
action I took, they would try to get
away in the motor car—it wras their
quickest means of escape. I went back
down the steps and opened up the bon-
net. I knew a little about motor cars,
and I shone my lantern in till I got the
top off the float-chamber, and saw the
petrol running out. I watched it till
the last drop had gone; then I closed
the bonnet, satisfied that I had scored
the first point.

  As I straightened up, I thought I
heard a low thudding noise. It wasn’t
the bough of a tree in the wind; it was
too near at hand for that. Then I
noticed another sparkle of light. This
time it was in a grating in the wall,
close down to the ground. Somebody,
I knew, must be busy in the cellar. A
queer occupation for anybody after
midnight. Flashing my lantern up, I
clanged the bell.

  The thudding stopped. I looked over
the balustrade. The light down at the
grating moved, and went out. Then
silence. I could still see the light at
the window of the room on my left, but
only a glimmer, for the narrow slit in
the curtain had been closed.

  I waited for a matter of three or
four minutes, then rang the bell again.

  The front door was at once thrown
open, as if somebody had been waiting
behind it in case I rang again. Half a
dozen candles had been lit in the big
hall, and standing in the doorway was
the man who had been driving the
motor car.

   “ Good Lord,” he said, “ I wondered
who the deuce it could be at this time
of night. Come in, constable. It’s too
damned stormy to be out of doors.”

Ill

I WAS glad he had spoken first, for
I wras a bit flustered, and not very
sure of what line to take. I decided
to go very cautiously, and bide my
time.
THE BODY OF SIR HENRY

691

  “And what can I do for you, con-
stable?” he said, lighting a brier pipe.
I could see he was a man of about
fifty-five. He was dark, and thin, but
he looked wiry, and he had a frank and
extremely pleasant smile. “ Nothing
wrong, eh?”

  “ Nothing, 1 hope sir,” I said. “ I’m
doing what I thought was my duty.
I knew Sir Henry had been away for
about a month, and hadn’t come back,
so, seeing the marks of a car at the
gates, I thought I’d have a look
around.”

  “Quite right,” said the man at once.
“ Glad the police arc so wide awake.
Didn’t we pass you at the crossroads,
eh?” '

  “ That’s correct, sir.”

  “ Thought so.” He nodded. “ Hadn’t
you better have a drink? It’s a foul
night, and I’ve just been down in the
cellar opening a case of Sir Henry’s
brandy.”

  Which explained the thudding I had
heard, but I couldn’t think why his
hands looked as if they had been scrap-
ing among brown earth.

  “ My name’s Norgate,” he went on.
“ Colonel Norgate. We’re on our way
to Newcastle. We should have been
here quite early in the evening, but Sir
Henry wanted to collect some goods
and chattels—and some odd things
from his safe. I told him he shouldn’t
leave valuables here, with the house
empty. It’s asking for trouble—don’t
you think so? He hadn’t even warned
the police to keep an eye— Hullo!”
He broke off and stared at me in
amazement. He must have read some
of my suspicions in my face, for he
burst into loud laughter. “ You don’t
mean to say you’ve been thinking
that— Come in and have a drink,
constable—that’s worth a drink any
day!”

  He led me into a large room on the
left—the one I had seen through the
chink in the curtains. It was lined
with books, and had some big carved
furniture. The safe was closed, I

noticed, and the door in the wall
looked like any ordinary door. The
suitcase still lay on the table near the
lamp, but it was shut. The bunches of
keys had gone. Away at the other end
of the room a fire was crackling and
spluttering in a gratf as if it had only
recently had a match put to it.

  On the hearthrug, with her back to
the fire, was the woman I bad seen in
the car. Her fur coat was open, her
hat was off, and in the lamplight she
looked wonderful. She was laughing
and chatting with a man who sat in an
armchair.

  And then I saw that Providence had
prevented me from making a grand
fool of myself. I couldn’t see the
man’s face, for his back was to me,
but I recognized his thick gray hair at
a glance. He was the man I had
spotted beside her in the motor car. A
half finished tumbler of spirits was on
a little table at his elbow, and a long
spiral of smoke curled up from the
cigarette in his fingers.

  “ My wife and Sir Henry Ellison-
Stewart,” said Colonel Norgate, nod-
ding in their direction. “ It was only
the local police constable,” he called
out to them. “ I’ve brought him in for
a drink.”

  The woman looked up, gave me a
smile that set my raw young heart
astir, wished me good evening, and
went on chatting.

  Colonel Norgate had stepped to the
sideboard near the door and was pour-
ing me out a drink.

  “ Sir Henry turned very groggy on
the way here,” he said in a lowered
voice. “ I thought we’d have to stop
the night at some wayside pub and call
in a doctor. However, a good stiff
dose of brandy has pulled him to-
gether. I don’t think it’s anything very
serious— Yes, my dear?”

  The woman crossed the library
with an empty glass. “ Another drink
for Sir Henry, Jim—he says he’s feel-
ing all right again.” She turned to
me. “ Oh, constable, by the wav,
692

DETECTIVE FICTION WEEKLY

would you do Sir Henry a favor ? It'll
save him writing.”

  “ Certainly, ma’am,” I said readily.

  “ You see, Sir Henry is coming
abroad with us,” she explained. “ We’ll
be yachting, and he won’t be back for
three months, ancPperhaps longer. He
wonders if you’d mind telling this to
the police sergeant, or to whoever
should be told, so that the house will be
looked after. Will that be all right?
Thanks most awfully for all your
trouble.”

  Charm is a queer thing. That young
woman stood talking to me by the side-
board for less than five minutes, but
by the time she had finished I think I
would have done anything in the world
for her. Because she had merely taken
notice of me I felt a good two inches
taller. And then I remembered what
I had done to their motor car, and I
wondered how in heaven’s name I was
going to blurt out what a fool I had
been! I wondered if I should clear
out and say nothing, hoping that they’d
have some spare petrol on the car. It
was a devilish awkward situation, I
can tell you. I was on the point of
broaching the subject when she turned
away with a bright laugh and a friendly
nod.

  “Give the constable another drink,
Jim,” she said. “ It’ll keep out the
cold and wet.”

  While the colonel was refilling my
glass, I followed her in admiration with
my eyes. She sauntered back to the
hearth, carrying herself superbly with
that easy swing of hers. And then my
eyes fastened on one detail, and for a
long second I felt as though I’d had a
sudden icy douche. Everything became
plain to me—everything. The colonel
handed me my glass.

   “ I wjonder, sir.” I said, in a steady
voice, “ if you’d mind signing my

THE

book? It’ll keep me right with the
sergeant to-morrow.”

  “ Certainly,” he declared, taking the
pencil and notebook I held out to him.
And when his hands were together, I
clicked the handcuffs on his wrists.

  With one leap I was at the door and
had locked it, and slipped the key in
my pocket.

  “ W'hat the hell are you getting at?”
The man’s face was twisted and white
as I pulled a little automatic pistol from
his hip pocket.

  “ The murder of Sir Henry Ellison-
Stewart,” I said, “ and the attempted
robbery of his safe—with the keys you
took from his body. It was a good
idea to bury him in the last place they’d
look for him—his own cellar.”

  The man was crouching like an
animal, but he knew I had him beat.
Everything I said was going home on
him like successive blows.

  “You had to pull the wool over me
somehow,” I said, watching him close-
ly. “ You had to convince me he was
still alive. When you saw me there
at the front door just now, you knew
I’d seen too much back at these cross-
roads. I’ve no doubt you stopped the
car on that lonely bit of road on Soutra
and killed him in cold blood. Aye.
Well, I compliment ye both, and espe-
cially the lady. You’re clever devils,
the two of you. But for one thing,
aye, one thing only, I’d have left this
house without a single suspicion in my
mind—which is what ye’ve been play-
ing for!”

  I pointed toward the hearth.

  With a cry, the woman had run for-
ward. But the gray-haired man, who
sat with his back to us, had not stirred.
His white hand rested on the arm of
his chair. The lighted cigarette burned
right down until it had charred the
flesh of the dead fingers.

  That sentence contains an abrupt
transition from the ordinary to the ex-
traordinary, from comedy to tragedy,
but it does not exaggerate, as there
would have been no murder had not
our hotel been included in the series
which I have named. And now I will
link up both by relating in sequence
the events which culminated in a ghast-
ly crime.

  The movie operator had first urged
that Sunday afternoon should be the
chosen time for making the film, but at
the request of the manager he agreed
to Monday night, usually our worst
from the point of view of patronage,
but on this occasion rendered important
by a dinner concert by artists of re-
nown who were certain to attract a
large and fashionable crowd. It was
arranged that three episodes in the
story of the hotel should be told—
lunch time, afternoon tea time, and din-
ner time; there were to be films made
of the exterior, depicting our patrons
arriving, and a few interior scenes
which would have to be touched up at
the studio because the management
could permit nothing likely to interfere
with the comfort of our guests.

An Odd Defect

  That was the simple arrangement,
and when I returned to the hotel on
Monday morning to resume my duties
I heard all about it from the manager,
who was feeling nervous less such a
method of publicity damage our pres-
tige by making us seem cheap. I did
not quite agree with him, reminding
him that if all the other leading hotels
were in the scheme we could not afford
to be left out. That cheered him up,
and he was quite keen on it when at
half past twelve the operator and his
assistant arrived. They were both
youngish men of unimportant appear-
ance and void of personality, but they
evidently knew their work, and I con-
gratulated them sincerely on their
smoothness and efficiency.

  When the third episode was “ shot,”

they prepared for departure. It shows
how little they interested me when I
say that I never troubled to inquire
their names, and I should have forgot-
ten them completely had I not been
keen to see the copy of the film which
they had promised to send the manager.

  It duly came to hand in less than a
week and at first sight I thought it ex-
cellent, but a closer scrutiny enabled
me to spot at least one defect—in al-
most every scene the same man and
woman appeared. They were a strik-
ing couple and could not be mistaken,
the tall, clean-shaved man with the
large, dark eyes and rather prominent
lips standing or sitting beside the petite
little lady with the wonderful teeth re-
vealed by an even more wonderful
smile.

Under False Names

  “ They might be actors posing pro-
fessionally and they make it look un-
real,” said the manager, with a growl.
“ The funny thing is I can’t recall see-
ing either of them in the hotel. Can
you ?”

  I could not, but then there was noth-
ing surprising about that. I never pro-
fess to keep a mental register of our
patrons—it was as much as I could do
to keep an eye on those who interest
me professionally—but at the same
time I was surprised at the manager’s
failure to recall the most prominent per-
sons in the film, for I am certain that
once seen they could not have been for-
gotten easily. However, there was
nothing more to be said on the subject;
the film was apparently complete, and
in a short time our hotel would be
shown on the screen in some hundreds
of theaters.

  A month or so later the whole affair
had degenerated into the commonplace,
one of those exciting events which
grow stale before they are a day old
and we had far more important things
to think about long before a headquar-
ters detective brought to the manager a
letter from the chief of police at Nice,
ADVENTURES OF A HOUSE DETECTIVE

695

France, inquiring if a Frenchman of
the name of Decalon and a fime. Yi-
bert had stayed at our hotel on Mon-
day, June 26.

  It was the work of a few minutes to
run through our books and ascertain
that no one bearing either name had
been among our guests on the night in
question, and the manager was telling
the detective so when the latter drew
from his pocket a couple of photo-
graphs.

  “ They may have used false names,”
he said. “ The probability is that they
did, but you may be able to recall their
appearance. Look at these photo-
graphs.”

A Murder in France

  I uttered an exclamation of surprise
the instant I saw them.

  “ Why, they’re the couple who fig-
ured so prominently in the film that
was taken of the hotel that very day!”
I cried, and all three of us stared hard
at the photographs for quite a minute.

  The detective was the first to break
the silence.

  “ I’d like to hear about that film,” he
said, settling himself in the armchair
facing the manager, “ but before you
start I'd better tell you that the French
police are interested because the day
before yesterday Decalon, the original
of that photograph, was shot dead at
Nice by the husband of the original of
the other photograph.”

  It did not take me long to satisfy his
curiosity concerning the film, but when
1 had finished he had to confess that he
knew little more than he had already
related about the tragedy at Nice. It
was apparently another instance of the
eternal triangle, in this case the actors
being a young married couple in poor
circumstances and a middle-aged bach-
elor of considerable wealth. Apparent-
ly, the latter had been the tempter, and
the jealous husband, unable to convince
his wife that all that glitters is not
gold, had followed his treacherous rival
to Nice and had shot him dead in a

corridor of one of the principal hotels
there.

  “ It is the sort of thing that's always
happening in Europe,” said the detec-
tive, preparing to leave us.

  “ Except in one particular,” I re-
marked, picking up the photographs
from the table and gazing at them.
“ According to your story Decalon and
the lady eloped to New York and
stayed at this hotel under assumed
names, but if they were so desirous of
secrecy why did they make themselves
so conspicuous during the taking of the
film? I don’t refer to the exterior
scenes in which they appear, for then
they might have been filmed without
knowing it, but that scene where they
are almost sitting in the §ame chair in
the lounge could not have been photo-
graphed without their being fully
aware of the fact.”

  “ By Jove, you’re right, it does seem
odd,” said the headquarters man. He
rose and stretched himself. “ It’s no
business of mine anyhow. The man’s
dead and it’s the job of the Nice police
to deal with his murderer, who’s in
jail. But I’ll mention what you say to
the chief in the event of further inqui-
ries being considered desirable.”

A Vain Couple

  The little problem I had propounded
kept my interest alive, and the next
time I was down town I looked in at
headquarters and found the detective
who had brought us the photograph.
He had half a dozen French papers in
his desk and in each one of them the
photographs of Decalon and Mme. Yi-
bert were reproduced, and once again
I scrutinized faces which were by now
almost as familiar to me as my own.

  There was no doubt that they had
been at our hotel on June 26, whatever
the manager or the reception clerk
might say to the contrary. But how
could they have been there and yet pass
unobserved in spite of the man’s re-
markable appearance and the woman’s
amazing beauty? T marveled at the
696

DETECTIVE FICTION WEEKLY

vanity of the couple in boldly posing
for the movie operator when they both
must have known that there was a
wronged husband capable of avenging
himself by committing murder.

  “ The husband is in prison now
awaiting trial,” said the detective, as I
handed the papers back to him; “ he’ll
be acquitted, of course, for they never
convict in crimes of passion in France.”

  He yawned, lit a cigarette, and hav-
ing chatted on general topics for a few
minutes we parted.

An Amazing Meeting

  It was a lovely afternoon and I made
for City Hall Park where there was
quite a crowd enjoying weather perfect
for New York. I was strolling along
Broadway when I was startled by see-
ing in front of me the originals of the
two persons in the film of the hotel. I
had less than ten seconds in which to
identify them as they passed me, but in
that brief time I discovered all the
proof I needed, including a tiny scar
to the extreme left of the upper lip of
the man, and although they as sudden-
ly disappeared I felt as though I had
suddenly discovered that the age of
miracles had not yet passed.

  It was clearly a case for action,
however, and I acted promptly. A taxi
was at hand and I was soon at the ad-
dress in Forty-Second Street from
which the copy of the film sent to the
manager had been addressed. But all
that rewarded me was the information,
given grudgingly by a surly housekeep-
er, that the film company I was inqui-
ring about had rented the single room
office for only a month, and then had
merely used it as an accommodation ad-
dress.

  By now I had come to the conclusion
that the affair was beginning to look
serious if not sinister, and I drove back
to headquarters, but I was not prepared
for the good humored chaff of the de-
tective when I related what I had seen.

  “ No,” he said, in laughing protest,
“ you must be mistaken. Why, Decalon

is dead and Mme. Yibert is at Nice
under the supervision of the police who
are determined that she shan’t avoid
giving evidence at the trial. You can’t
expect me, therefore, to believe that
not only is Mme. Yibert in New York,
but that Decalon, the murdered man, is
actually alive and walking about New
York.”

  “ I don’t care what you say,” I re-
torted. “ I saw the originals of these
two photographs little more than half
an hour ago, and it's my opinion that
if you’ll find the man who took the
film of the hotel you'll also find the
real story behind the murder at Nice.
Isn’t it odd that the so-called film com-
pany should have had what amounts
to a fake office in Forty-Second Street ?
Isn’t it odder still that what I may
call the principal and most prominent
actors in the film of the hotel should
be a man and a woman who to all in-
tents and purposes had the very best of
reasons for avoiding the very promi-
nence the film gives them?”

Inside the Plot

  He played nervously with the pens
on his desk and was silent.

  “ I’ll have inquiries made about the
film company,” he said at last. “ Per-
haps, you’ll send along the copy of the
film and any communications you have
had from the company?”

  “ They’ll be in your possession to-
night,” I said, and I was as good as
my word, for a special messenger de-
livered them at headquarters within an
hour, and then the manager, in whom
I had confided, and I waited for the
developments which we both knew
would be sensational.

  But we had to wait some weeks, and
the reason was that the man and the
woman I had seen in Broadway had
recognized me and had promptly sailed
for Europe. They were actually ar-
rested in Pontorsin, a village in Brit-
tany, a month after my visit to head-
quarters and the charge against them
was blackmail and conspiracy.
ADVENTURES OF A HOUSE DETECTIVE

697

  For the film of the hotel had been
part of a blackmail plot by a gang of
four, including one woman. They had
rented the room in Forty-Second
Street, given themselves a high-sound-
ing name, and had selected our hotel
as the scene of the film which was to be
used to extort money.

  The real Decalon, the man who was
murdered at Nice, was a friend of the
Yiberts, who were, as I have said, poor
in comparison with the wealthy manu-
facturer. Decalon entertained them
frequently and on occasions was seen
alone in Mme. Yibert’s society, but
there never was any question of in-
trigue until a mutual acquaintance by
the name of Lendra concocted the
scheme which he intended should com-
pel Decalon to pay hush money.

  Owing to his intimacy with both
parties Lendra heard regularly of their
few engagements, and when one eve-
ning Decalon casually mentioned that
he was going to New York on business
on a certain date and the next morning
Lendra ran into Mme. Yibert, who in-
formed him that she was going to
spend three weeks with an aunt at Mar-
seilles, he began to make his plans there
and then.	,

  He assembled a little company, in-
cluding an out-of-work actress who in
figure and face resembled Mme. Yibert
and who could “ make up ” to look like
madame to the life. There was also a
big, burly ruffian to impersonate De-
calon, and the fourth member was an
expert movie operator who may be
described as unemployable because of
his record and character.

  I need not describe in full how the
film was taken which apparently de-
picted Mme. Yibert and M. Decalon
entering our hotel and chatting in-
timately in the lounge and later dining
together. It was very well done and
when the picture was complete, Lendra
called on Decalon to inform him that
he had been asked by a certain person
to offer him for sale all the rights in
a film which Decalon would find it to

his advantage to suppress. The wealthy
manufacturer, who had returned to
France and was on eve of leaving for
a holiday at Nice, had first thought
that Lendra was attempting a silly and
meaningless -joke, and when at last it
dawned on him that the blackguard
was serious he threw him out of the
room and kicked him out of the front
door. Had the Yiberts been at home
he would have telephoned to tell them
of the attempt to blackmail him, for
he and Mme. Yibert had nothing what-
ever to hide, but the latter was still
with her aunt and Yibert himself was
staying with a bachelor friend in the
country. And it was to this unfor-
tunate absence from home of the
Yiberts that the tragedy was due en-
tirely, for if Decalon could have had
a few minutes on the phone with either
of them he would have saved his life.

  As it was he went off to Nice, and
Lendra, crazy for revenge, sent the
copy of the film in his possession to
Yibert, accompanying it with specially
enlarged photographs of the scenes in
which the bogus Decalon and the bogus
Mme. Yibert figured prominently.

  To Yibert the evidence must have
appeared decisive—he believed that
whereas the camera cannot lie an aunt
can and will to help a niece engaged
in an intrigue—and being naturally of
a very jealous disposition he had
thought of nothing else but revenge.
How he took it has been told, and all
that remains of the story can soon be
related. Lendra was arrested shortly
after the impersonators of Decalon and
Mme. Yibert were under lock and key,
but the fourth member of the gang es-
caped to South America. The trio were
put on trial a week after Yibert had
been acquitted as the result of an emo-
tional appeal by one of the most cele-
brated French lawyers. But there was
no emotion when the three blackmail-
ers stood in the dock and in contrast to
the acquitted murderer got ten years’
imprisonment each. It is a way they
have in France!

  The Maid Heard an Angry Cry: “ Go Away / ” The Library Door
  Clicked Shut—and Three Minutes Later Harry Tenby Lay Dead

By J. Jefferson Farjeon

away! D’you hear? Go

 I	y away!” shouted Harry Tenby.
The library door closed with
a little click. Three minutes later he
lay dead on the carpet.

 There was no sign of struggle. The
furniture was not disarranged, the
standard lamplight still glowed with
amber mellowness; but a little cool
breeze flowed in through the open
French window, and some four feet
from the dead man’s head lay a blood-
stained handkerchief.

  In the distance, across a night-black
fringe of foliage, a church clock
chimed eleven. Two minutes ahead of
the church, a little brass clock on the
mantelpiece ticked restlessly. Ticked
away the hours of twelve, and one, and

two, informed of its impatience each
hour by the leisurely, distant chimes.

  Three. Four. Five. The night-
black fringe of foliage took on a gray
hue. Six. Birds stirred, waking the
eaves, and a hoarse cock announced the
day. Seven. The library door opened,
again with a little click. Some one
gasped.

  The silent room, with its grim in-
mate, and its incongruous amber glow
from the standard lamp, became sud-
denly alive. Forms flitted about. Voices
whispered above the dead man’s form.

  Eight. The voices grew louder;
they whispered less.

  Nine. The room lost all its privacy.
It became the center of buzzing official-
dom ; was pervaded with heavy signifi-

cance. A picture of the Battle of
Waterloo, slightly aslant on the wall,
was stared at with rude suspicion, and
a volume of poems by Humbert Wolfe,
innocently leaning against Wells’s
“ History of the World ” in a book-
case, became ridiculously significant.

  Ten. Eleven. A dozen hours ago
the form on the ground had been alive.
An inspector stared at it meditatively,
then suddenly turned. A newcomer
had entered the room.

  “ Ah, Crook!” the inspector ex-
claimed. “Glad to see you! We’ve
got a ticklish job on here.”

  “ So I gather,” answered Crook, his
eyes on the silent figure. “ What’s
known so far ? Leave out theories for
the moment.”

  The inspector nodded.

  “ All that’s known so far,” he re-
plied, “ is—that!” He pointed down-
ward. “ The parlor maid found him
this morning at seven o’clock. He was
lying just as he is now. Lamp up—as
you see. Nothing’s been altered.”
Crook’s eyes swept the room.

  “ No sign of a struggle,” he com-
mented.

  “ No,” replied the inspector. “ It
must have been done—quick.”

  “ That handkerchief?”

  “ It was lying just there. I did look
at that, but it’s replaced.”

  “ Finger-prints?”

  “ Nothing to report in that line yet.”
  “ Who saw him last ?”

  A slight frown came into the inspec-
tor’s eyes.

  “ Ah—I was wrong when I said
nothing else was known at the moment.
It seems that Mr. Tenby’s butler saw
him last. And Mr. Tenby’s butler has
disappeared.”

  “ That’s interesting. And when was
the butler seen last?”

  “ Shortly before eleven. A maid,
passing on her way to bed, saw him go
into, the library—this room we’re now'
in—and a few minutes later, when she
was passing again—”

  “ Why did she pass a second time

if the first time she was on her way to
bed?” interposed Crook.

  “ She says she forgot something. A
book. She reads before going to sleep.
I’ve checked that.”

 “Well? Goon.”

  “ The second time she heard voices
raised. Mr. Tenby seemed angry. She
heard him shouting: ‘ Go away, do you
hear? Go away!’”

  Crook considered the words.

  “ Is that all she heard ?” he asked.

  “ All I can get out of her,” answered
the inspector. “ She’s a bit hysterical.”
“ So—coming now to theories—the
superficial, schoolboy theory wrould be:
Tenby quarrels with his butler over
some matter unknown; the butler kills
him and runs away. By the way, has
the butler’s bed been slept in?”

  The inspector shook his head.
  “You’re searching for him?”

  “ Obviously.”

  “ What’s the doctor’s report ? How
long has Mr. Tenby been dead?”

  “ He was alive at eleven o’clock last
night—that we know. The medical
evidence suggests that life was extinct
before twelve. Wound inflicted by
some sharp instrument. And no sign
of the sharp instrument.”

  “ Anything stolen — as far as you
know ?”

  “ Nothing.”

  “ Papers reveal anything? Letters?”
  “ Not so far.”

  “ Heard anything that might ac-
count for the tragedy—apart from the
assumed quarrel with the butler?”

  “ Blank again. Nothing.”

  “ Then why do you call this case a
ticklish one?” inquired the detective.
“ You’ve got some nice superficial evi-
dence on which to search for a butler,
haven’t you?”

  “ Well, of course, we’re searching
for that butler,” retorted the inspector.
“What do yon think? But—come
here—to the window.”

  They walked to the window, and the
inspector pointed to some impressions
in the earth outside.
700

DETECTIVE FICTION WEEKLY

  “ Big foot, that,” he said. “ The
butler takes size seven. There’s not a
boot in the establishment that will fill
those impressions. And they’re newly
made, too.”

  “ Good,” grunted Crook, his eyes
lighting. “ That’s important. I rather
thought you had something up your
sleeve, inspector.”

  “ I wish I had the boot that fits those
impressions up my sleeve,” returned
the inspector, smiling sourly. “ We’ve
got a double trail here, and I’m blessed
if I know what to make of ’em.”

II

CROOK bent down and examined
the footprints carefully. Then he
searched the adjacent grass, while
the inspector stood by watching.

  “ / can’t find any more,” said the in-
spector. “ The ground’s pretty hard,
and we’ve only got these because some
of Mr. Tenby’s special flowers happen
to be growing there. The servants
had orders to water these every eve-
ning, and that’s what made the earth
soft.”

  “ I suppose,” observed Crook, as he
straightened himself, “ you don’t hap-
pen to have that boot that isn’t up your
sleeve on your foot ?”

  The inspector grinned.

  “ Oh, my boots fit there, right
enough,” he confessed. “ I’ve a useful
toe, as you see.” He advanced his big
boot, unashamedly. “ Only, if you
want to pursue that line, sir, I’ll have no
difficulty in producing my alibi.”

  “ Well—just for the sake of 'argu-
ment—let’s have it!”

  “ Right. Between ten and one o’clock
last night, I was trying—unsuccessful-
ly—to trace one Jim Smith who’s been
terrorizing Downthorpe, three miles
from here.”

  “ Burglar ?”

  “ That’s right. We’ll get him pres-
ently.”

  “ But you didn’t get him last night—
ui Downthorpe.”

  “ Didn’t see his shadow.”

 “ Do you think you might have
found him if you’d searched—here?”
The inspector whistled. He stared at
Crook, then at the earth.

  “By Jove, that’s an idea!” he ex-
claimed.

  “ But does it account for the van-
ished butler?”

“It might! Let’s see if we can fit
the pieces. Smith comes here, and—”
He paused abruptly. A constable
was approaching, rather breathlessly,
across the lawn.

  “ We've found Davis, sir,” he re-
ported, with big eyes.

  “ No, have you?” cried the inspector,
and turned quickly to Crook. “ That’s
the butler—Davis.” He swung back
to the constable. ' “ Well, get 011 with
it. Where is he?”

  “ In the pond,” answered the con-
stable.

  The inspector gave an exclamation,
and looked at his companion.

  “Pond, eh?” he muttered. “That
makes another piece to fit in, eh? Well
—come along!”

  “ How far is the pond from here?”
asked Crook.

  “ Don't know. There’s more than
one. Which pond is it?” he inquired of
the constable.

  “ ’Arf a mile off,” replied the police-
man. “ Through them woods. They’re
bringin’ ’im out now.”

  The inspector made a movement, but
Crook interposed.

  “ Better leave some one to watch the
library,” he suggested.

  The constable heard the remark, and
inwardly groaned. He wasn’t too keen
on the library. He’d really rather have
been a cinema actor than a constable.
It was much more interesting watching
a corpse fished out of a pond. Still,
duty was duty, and for half an hour he
waited in the library while his superiors
enjoyed better sport.

  Davis, the butler, was as dead as his
master. The doctor, who declared sub-
sequently that lie, had never had such a
busy morning, pronounced the opinion
THE GOLDEN IDOL

701

that the butler had been dead almost
as long as Mr. Tenby.

  “ Drowned, obviously/’ he said.
“ but whether by his own hand or an-
other’s—well, I leave that for you to
determine, gentlemen.”

  “ Looks to me like suicide.” confided
the inspector, to Crook. “ Kills his
master, and then saves the hangman a
job.”

  “Why should he kill his master?”
asked Crook, as they walked back to
the house. “ We want a motive.”

  “ We know' they quarreled.”

  “ Do we ? I don’t think so. A sharp
order isn’t necessarily a quarrel. Sup-
pose—” He paused, and revolved an
idea that had come into his mind.
“What?” queried the inspector.

  “ I must interview that housemaid—
that’s w'hat,” responded Crook. “ Send
for her, wrill you?”

  They reached the house, and while
waiting for the maid Crook made a
further examination of the library. The
constable watched him, and suddenly
jumped.

  “ What have you moved the hand-
kerchief for?” demanded Crook, and
his voice sounded like a pistol shot.

  “ I just took it up, sir—” began the
constable.

  “ Then just put it down again,”
snapped Crook. “ Surely you know' bet-
ter than to move things before you’re
given permission?”

  The constable colored, grew more
convinced than ever that he ought to
have taken up film acting, lifted the
gruesome handkerchief from the table
on which he had placed it, and dropped
it on the floor.

  “ Was it as near the body as that ?’’
inquired Crook, frowning.

  “ A bit farther off, sir, I think,” said
the constable. “ More there, like.”
“Yes—that’s better. I remember
it was there, by the pattern on the car-
pet.” Crook’s voice had lost its anger.
You cannot concentrate while you are
indignant, and Crook was c&ncentrat-
ing now on the handkerchief. “ Now,

how did it get in that exact position?”
he murmured. “ It’s beyond the dead
man’s reach. Though—of course—he
may have dropped it.”

  “ Floated down, like,” suggested the
constable poetically, trying to reinstate
himself.

  “ Perhaps. And yet, do you notice,
constable, that if the handkerchief had
floated down, like—from the position
of the body, it would probably have
floated down on the other side*. The
attack assumedly came from the
window. Everything points to that.
The handkerchief is one of Mr.
Tenby’s. You cannot fight with a
handkerchief. It either lay by his
side when the attack came—but, then,
why should he take it up?—or was in
his hand at the moment, and so became
involved? Perhaps he was about to
blow his nose. Then—a few seconds
later—it was used to try and stanch a
wound. Y es—but Mr. Tenby’s wound
much have been beyond stanching.”

  He paused, then turned sharpiy.
The housemaid was standing before
him.

Ill

HE scrutinized her keenly for a
second or two, placed her in a
category, then asked:

  “ You are the maid who heard
Davis’s voice in this room last night?”
“ No, I didn’t hear Davis’s voice,
sir,” answered the maid tremulously.
“ I never said I heard his voice.”
Crook nodded approvingly. The
maid wras calm now, despite her
nervousness, and the fact that he had
not tripped her up in this little detail
impressed him with her usefulness as a
witness.

  “ How are you sure, then, that Davis
wras in this room?”

  “ I’d seen him go in.”

  “ He might have come out again,
without you knowing it?”

  “ Yes, sir. He might. But I wasn’t
gone long before I came by again my-
self. I think he was still there.”
702

DETECTIVE FICTION WEEKLY

  “ Please repeat what you heard.”

  “ It was Mr. Tenby’s voice. ‘ Go
away,’ he said. ‘ Do you hear ? Go
away!’ ” She paused. “ He spoke
sharp—that’s why I heard.”

  “ Did he seem in a rage?”

  “ No. I wouldn’t say that.”

  “Very angry, then?”

  “ A bit angry, yes, sir. Irritated, as
you might say.”

  “ They weren’t actually quarreling,
then?”

  “ No, sir.”

  “Now, listen. This is important.
Is there no other word—even one
single word—that you can remember
having heard?”

  The maid flushed a little.

  “ Yes, sir,” she said. “ I was that
upset that I couldn’t think of it when
the inspector asked me. But I’ve been
thinking it all over, and I do remem-
ber the words, ‘ look after myself.’ He
said them just before the others. ‘ Look
after myself.’ ”

  Crook’s eyes brightened. He leaned
forward, and exclaimed, “ This is im-
portant! Were the words in the form
of a statement or a question?”

  The maid did not seem to under-
stand. “ Listen,” he said, and repeated
the three words, “ 1 Look after myself.’
That’s a statement. ‘ Look after my-
self ?’ That’s a question. Which was
it more like?”

  “ It was a question,” answered the
maid.

  “ Thank you,” replied Crook.
“ That’s all, for the moment. You can

g°-

  He also dismissed the constable, and
ten minutes later the inspector came
upon him in a brown study.

  “Getting anywhere?” asked the in-
spector. “If you’re not—I am!”

  “ Where are you getting?” inquired
Crook.

  “ I’ve got Jim Smith,” said the in-
spector. “ Just been on the phone.
They took him half an ho.ir ago. and
it's pretty clear you were right, and
he was around here last night. They’ve

looked at his boots. Size eleven. Same
as those prints outside the French win-
dow—and same as mine.”

  “ Then Davis may have been warn-
ing his master,” mused Crook, and the
inspector looked at him sharply.
“What’s that?” he exclaimed.

  “ I've just got a little more out of
that housemaid than you did,” the de-
tective explained. “ She heard three
more words than she told you. Mr.
Tenby said—assumedlv to Davis, be-
fore dismissing him, ‘ Look after my-
self?’ Was he a headstrong man, do
you know? Plenty of pride?”

  “That's it! You’re right!” cried
the inspector. “ Davis heard noises,
or rumors, and interviews Mr. Ten-
by before going to bed. ‘ Jim Smith’s
about.’ he says to Mr. Tenby.
‘Thought I'd better tell you, sir.’
Tenby is busy. A bit nervy. We all
are, at times. ‘ Think I don’t know
how to look after myself?’ he cries.
Davis is about to press his point, when
Tenby rounds on him, ‘Go away!
D’you hear? Go away!’” The in-
spector chuckled delightedly. “ How's
that, for our lost pieces, eh?”

  “ There’s a bit more of the picture
to fill in,” replied Crook. “ What
happened then? Davis, not satisfied,
went into the grounds. Smith creeps
up to the window. Enters. Kills Mr.
Tenby. Davis comes upon him
There’s a chase—and Davis ends his
life in the pond. Pushed in by Smith,
eh?”

  “ That would be about it,” nodded
the inspector.

  “ Well, if that’s it,” said Crook,
“ you'll have to find bloodstains on
Smith somewhere or other, I should
imagine, and you'll have to prove him
the sort of man who would commit two
murders in a single night. And you’ll
have to search for the doctor’s ‘sharp
instrument.’ A sandbag seems to me
more in Smith’s line.”

  “Yes, but—confound it—” began
the inspector. “ Well, then, what do
you think?”.
THE GOLDEN IDOL

703

   “ I think you’ve nearly got the
 story, but not quite,” replied Crook.

   “ What is the story?” demanded the
 inspector.

   “ I don't know yet,” admitted
 Crook, “ but I've a notion that hand-
 kerchief on the ground there may tell
 - me. Do you mind if I take it away?”

   “Not at all. But what are you
 going to do with it ?”

   Crook smiled.

IV

 DETECTIVE CROOK had been
 summoned from Hampstead that
 morning. Now he returned, with
 the bloodstained handkerchief care-
 fully preserved in his pocket, and
 locked himself in a large and not too
 appetizing room.

    The room bristled with bottles, con-
 taining queer fluids; with microscopes
 and magnifying glasses; with instru-
 ments, reflectors, tubes, and powders.

   The handkerchief was brought out.
 The instruments, the magnifying
 glasses, and the fluids got to work.
 When, in due course, it had told all it
 could tell to the ruthlessly inquiring
 mind that ransacked its secrets, Crook
 traveled back to its former home.

    He went straight to the library, and
 found the inspector there.

   “ You haven’t hanged Jim Smith
 yet, have you?” he asked, almost
 facetiously.

   “ No, not yet,” responded the in-
 spector. “ Who shall I hang in his
 place?”

   “ Some one with a darker skin, for
 choice,” suggested Crook.

   “ That’d be hard,” answered the in-
 spector. “ Smith used to be a miner,
 and the coal’s still in him.” But,
 though he spoke lightly, he was look-
 ing at Crook rather hard.

   “ Coal washes off,” said Crook.
 “ Try some one whose dark skin won't
 wash off. Say—an Indian.”

   “ Look here! What are you driv-
 ing at?” demanded the inspector.

    “ I’m driving at an Indian. Some of

his blood was on that handkerchief.
We’ve got to fit that into our picture,
haven’t wre?”

  “ How do you know it’s an Indian’s
blood ?”

  “ I know because I’ve tested it, and
analyzed it. Did you think all blood
was the same, inspector? It differs in
every country. Yours and mine might
be hard to tell apart, but if yours or
mine were on one end of a handker-
chief and the Spanish ambassador’s on
the other end, it would be easy to say
which belonged to which.”

  “ How’d you do that?”

  “ By examining its composition.
There are two qualities in blood that
vary in proportion according to
nationality, or locality. Call one A,
and the other B. Mr. Tenby’s blood
contained forty-three per cent of A and
seven of B. I found some of his blood
on the handkerchief. But somebody
else’s blood was also on the handker-
chief, with only eighteen per cent of A,
and as much as forty-one per cent of
B. That points to India—indisput-
ably.”

  “ Does anything else point to India,
though?” demanded the inspector.

  “ We’ll have to put that question, I
think, to Jim Smith,” answered the de-
tective. “ But, first—can’t you help
me at all?”

  Almost as the question was asked,
the inspector gave an exclamation.

  “ Wait a bit—I’ve thought of some-
thing !” he cried. “ An Indian Why
-—it was from an Indian’s house that
Smith made his last haul in Down-
thorpe! Does that fit into it any-
where?”

  “ It will be an amazing coincidence
if it doesn’t fit into it somewhere,”
responded Crook; and there was si-
lence for a few moments. Then he
asked: “What did Smith take from the
Indian’s house? Did you get any defi-
nite report about that?”

  “ Oh, yes. We’ve got a list. Money,
trinkets, odds and ends, ornaments, a
little gold idol—”
704

DETECTIVE FICTION WEEKLY

  “ You needn’t travel beyond the
idol,” interrupted Crook, his eyes nar-
rowing. “We’ve got to it, now—or
to the general idea of it. It’s just a
question of fitting in small details. Sup-
pose Smith stole, unwittingly, an idol
that was particularly valued by this In-
dian? Suppose the Indian, burning
with a hatred that only an Oriental
mind could understand, tracked Smith,
and followed him, and effected a meet-
ing at last—in this very room? Sup-
pose—”

  “ Wait a minute,” interposed the in-
spector. “ It's Tenby’s been murdered,
not Smith!-’

  “ I know that. The best-laid schemes
of mice and Indians go astray! Listen!
The butler warns Tenby about Smith.
He’s got hold of some rumor. When
Tenby hears Smith outside, he slips
into some dark corner for a moment.
In comes Smith. Almost before he
knows it, in slips our Indian after him,
knife raised. Seeing this, Tenby
rushes out. In the scramble, Smith
escapes, and Tenby gets the knife—but
not before he has managed to do some
damage to the Indian, too. There was
the Indian’s blood on the handkerchief,
you remember.”

  “ What about the butler ?” asked the
inspector.

  “ I’m coming to him. Smith gets
away. He may not even have seen the
Indian—it’s conceivable. As soon as
he saw Tenby he turned and fled. The
butler, going into the grounds to
satisfy himself, gets there too late to
see Smith, but he sees the Indian flying
out. There’s a chase. It ends at the
pond. And the poor butler gets the
wrorst of it.”

  “ By God!” muttered the inspector.
“If that’s so—Mr. Hoodi Singh will
have something to answer for!”

  “ Let’s go to Downthorpe, and hear
his answer,” suggested Crook.

  They wTent to Downthorpe. Mr.
Singh received them courteously. With
Oriental caution, he listened to their
story, gravely, inscrutably, his eyes ap-

pearing unnaturally bright in their en-
vironment of dark skin. He
volunteered nothing until every detail
had been given to him. Then he smiled.

  “ And so 1 have killed Mr. Tenbv
and his butler?” he observed.

  “We have made no accusation,” said
Crook.

  “ Oh, no. And you will not, I
think. If my blood was on the hand-
kerchief there will be some w'ound
from which the blood has flowed.” He
held up his hands calmly. “ Examine
me. My skin is whole. There is no
mark upon it.” He smiled again.
“ And last night, as three very dull
people will testify, I tried to learn youf
English game of bridge. While Mr.
Tenby was dying—I was not much
happier.”

  “ The coincidence is odd, you will
admit?” suggested Crook.

  “ Who speaks of a coincidence?” re-
plied Mr. Singh. “ There is no such
thing. Fate decides. If that gold
idol had belonged to me, the man who
had taken it might have died at my
hands. Yes, him,” he added contem-
platively, “ and not another, through
foolish blundering.”

  “ Do you know whom the idol did
belong to ?” inquired Crook suddenly.

  “ Oh, yes,” returned Mr. Singh. “ It
belonged to my servant. The man who
let you in. Did you not notice his
bound wrist?”

  “ Oh—so that’s it, is it?” cried the
inspector, jumping up. “ Then we’ll
have to see your servant!”

  “ I will ring for him,” answered Mr.
Hoodi Singh. He pressed a bell.
“ But I fear he may not come. You
will not blame me, I hope, if he has had
some start ?”

  Hoodi Singh’s servant did not conic.
Science had throwrn its searchlight upon
him for an instant, but it could not
catch him. He disappeared into the
void. And so, when Jim Smith’s haul
was eventually unearthed, did a little
gold idol.

A Murder Classic

                 A True Story

By Louise Rice

WHEREVER
spec ialists in
crime discuss
murders they are sure
to mention the Rup-
recht case. This was
one of the first un-
solved murder mys-
teries to become cel-
ebrated, and the reason
was that it was one of
the first to be carefully
investigated at the time of the occur-
rence.

  The victim of the crime was Chris-
topher Ruprecht. His trade was that
of a goldsmith, but his real business
was lending money at usurious rates,
not illegal at the time, but none the less
iniquitous.

  His death came at the end of a sin-
gularly harsh life, and caused few
tears, yet he lingers on, a tantalizing
figure, in the annals of crime.

  Ruprecht was an uneducated man.
In 1817 that was more of a rarity than
it had been for many hundreds of
years. Education was seeping down
and up, catching the lower and the
higher levels of society. It was re-
marked that Ruprecht kept all his nu-
merous accounts “ in his head,” being
unable to read or write a word and
quite unable to figure.

The assassin waited with the
weapon poised

    When he had any paper connected
  with his business affairs, he called in
  some one who could be trusted, and
  had it read to him.

     Notwithstanding, he was a man who
   held quite a place in the small town in
   Germany where he had lived all of
   his life. Wrhile he kept a slovenly
   house, with only one manservant to
   attend it and him, his daughter was
   married to quite a fine gentleman, who
   had carriages, servants, and a preten-
   tious house; one, in fact, which was
   maintained in a style somewhat be-
   yond his means. He was something of
   a fop, was Beiringer, very much the
   gentleman. And inclined to shift the
   blame of his extravagance on his wife
   —at least, when he was talking to his
   father-in-law, from whom he was al-
   ways seeking some pecuniary assist-
   ance, which he seldom got.

Ruprecht the Usurer
Meets His Last Debtor
When a Mysterious
Visitor Calls for Him
at “Hell” '
706

DETECTIVE FICTION WEEKLY

  Ruprecht was really not meanly
born, but as a boy he had repeatedly
run away from school, and had early
in life shown such a shrewd ability to
add thaler to thaler that his family had
soon abandoned the effort to force him
through school.

   He had learned his trade as a gold-
smith easily enough, after a short ap-
prenticeship, and, as soon as he had
begun to make money, had started out
to be a loan broker. The woman whom
he married brought him a house, and
soon died. People said that her hus-
band had starved her to death.

An Evil Placc

  His daughter, however, grew up
more or less attached to him, and this
attachment became greater as she grew
older. She married against the advice
of her father, but this did not break
the tie between them. At any moment
when something worried or fretted
him he was apt to send his servant
posthaste for his daughter. This was
a fact which was to bear weight later.

  She was a woman with something
of her father’s harshness in her and
with a tongue of her own, as is shown
by the fact that she once passed forty-
eight hours in the town lockup, put
there by the complaints of neighbors
who insisted that she managed her
household and her husband in such a
loud voice she disturbed their peace.

   It is worth noting that her husband
allowed her to stay “ in durance vile ”
until her father went and took her
out, which does not argue much of
husbandly love; and it is worth noting,
too, that she was, like her "father, a
shrewd one in business, and that
Beiringer was a poor one. She had
more money from her investments of
money given her by her father than
her husband had through his business.

  In modern times men have become
used to women being financially inde-
pendent, but in Germany at that time
Beiringer often showed tliat he
thought it a disgrace that he did not

have all of his wife’s money to handle
for himself. Her father, in making her
marriage contract, had seen to that.

  Ruprecht, for all that he had his
own house, and for all that he was a
man of substance, chose very ordinary
society. He frequented alehouses of
the lowest sort, instead of the com-
fortable and cleanly places where the
better classes went, and was well
known for his rages at “ the gentry.”
His son-in-law was one of the gentry,
and ever since his acquisition of that
relation by marriage Ruprecht had
flouted his association with the com-
monest of the town.

  On February 7, 1817, Ruprecht, af-
ter a day spent in conducting business
at his house, which was also his place
of business, and after the tneager meal
which his servant gave him, wrent to
an alehouse where he was very well
known.

   It was up a dark, narrow lane, bor-
dered by mean houses and bits of a
very thick hedge, and was at the very
end, where it blocked the lane. Either
because of its gloomy situation or be-
cause of the reputation which it bore,
the place was known as “ Hell.”

The Last Round

  About eight o’clock Ruprecht was
in the upstairs lounging room of this
alehouse, and a number of men, who
knew him very well, made room for
him before the fire. His grumbling,
peevish and irritated talking was well
understood there, and the man was
liked.

  He had been going to that place for
several years, but it was not the only
place which he ever visited, and no one
knew that he was going to Hell that
night.

  Time passed, and more beer had
been taken upstairs by one of the
maids. At a quarter past ten the land-
lord came into the room, as was his
custom. At eleven the place would
close, and it was to be sure that beer
and other refreshments were at hand
A MURDER CLASSIC

707

for the last three-quarters of an hour
that he always visited the lounging
room at exactly that time. The maids
had gone to bed.

  There can be no question of the time.
The landlord had been doing that very
thing for years.

  The men in the room gave him or-
ders, and he went downstairs with a
large pitcher in his hand. It took him
only §ve minutes, at the most, to fill
the pitcher and to take some cheese
from the pantry. He was going right
up the stairs again, and had put his
foot on the first step, when a man’s
voice came from the front door, which
was partially opened:

The Ax Man

  “ Is Ruprecht upstairs?”

  The landlord had a dim light in the
hall, and the man stood in the shadow
of the door. However, he did not try
to see who it was. He was used, as
every alehouse owner was, to having
all sorts of people dog the footsteps of
Ruprecht, trying to get loans of money
from him. So he said yes, Ruprecht
was upstairs; and the caller said
quietly:

  “ Ask him to step downstairs a min-
ute, will you?”

  The landlord said he would.

  Ruprecht took the message without
surprise. People were always hanging
about places where he was to be found.
He set down his mug and went out.
The landlord had filled only a couple
of mugs, when there was a sound be-
low stai^ which made that stolid man
stop pouring and stare.

  “ In God’s name,” he exclaimed,
“ what was that?”

  As he spoke there was the sound of
a heavy fall, and all who were in the
room ran out.

  It was only a second that it took the
foremost to reach the front door,
where a figure lay, partly in and partly
out of it.

  It was Ruprecht, bleeding profusely
from a cut in his head, still breathing.

  The leather cap which he had been
wearing lay inside the doorway—prov-
ing that he had fallen inward—and it
was cut almost in two.

  They lifted him up and tried to get
the blood out of his eyes, while they
asked him who had dealt him such a
blow; but he could only moan. Sev-
eral ran out, rushed up and down the
lane, but saw “ no living creature.”

  After a moment Ruprecht spoke:

  “ The villain—the villain with the
ax.”

  They told this to the men who had
searched the lane, and those men at
once went out to search the houses,
where people were now hanging out of
the windows asking what had hap-
pened.

  The landlord’s wife had hastily
warmed a bed, and, half carrying and
half dragging, they got the old man
up the stairs.

  On the way up he said only one co-
herent thing:

  “ My daughter—my daughter—”

  Every one knew his custom of call-
ing for his daughter whenever any-
thing happened to ruffle the old man,
and so they thought this quite natural,
and at once sent a runner to the other
part of town to tell her. They also sent
for a physician.

The Doctors Disagree

  The wound on Ruprecht’s head was
four inches long and was a clean, sharp
cut along the whole length of the skull,
seeming to be deeper at the back than
at the front.

  The physicians gave it as their opin-
ions that the blow had been struck
from behind and above. This was like-
ly in that there was a stone seat against
the house, and beside the front door,
where a person might stand in the
shadow and not be noticed by a per-
son who looked out unsuspecting.

  That, it was surmised, was exactly
what Ruprecht had done. The assas-
sin, standing pressed against the house,
with the weapon poised, could at once
708

DETECTIVE FICTION WEEKLY

strike down with terrific force that
would fairly split the head in two. The
reason that it had not split Ruprecht’s
was that the tough leather' cap had
taken a little of the force. Otherwise,
the man must have dropped dead.

  The medical men were most posi-
tively of the opinion that the weapon
used was not an ax, despite the words
of the wounded man. They pointed
out that no ax would give a wound of
a little over four inches like the one
that the man had received, and that
the ax, always curving slightly upward
at both ends, would give a wound
which would be deeper in the middle
than at the ends, and that only a
weapon with a long blade could have
cut as that one had. It was a sword,
they thought, and that in the hands of
an experienced person.

All for Business

  The most diligent search by the town
authorities, made within half an hour
of the tiifie of the crime, brought for-
ward no record of a man having been
seen wearing or carrying a sword—
and it must be remembered that this is
a weapon hard to conceal, even under a
cloak. And no man wearing a cloak
had been observed, nor any stranger.
In small German towns, at that period,
it would have been almost impossible
for a stranger to escape observation.

  The daughter came hastily, but her
father did not know her. She was
evidently in a stew over his keys and
hunted through his clothes until she
found them. Ruprecht’s lawyer and
man of business had arrived at about
the same time and the two of them put
their heads together, making arrange-
ments for the carrying on of many bits
of business which they knew to be in
hand.

  The servant was then sent for, in
order to give them such details as he
knew, and, after assuring the doctors
that the injured man must be removed
to his own house as soon as possible
and that they would have it in readi-

ness for him, the daughter and the law-
yer departed. The alehouse com-
panions of Ruprecht, who had, with
him, sneered at “ gentry,” had a good
deal to say about this, stating that it
was a most unloving action on the part
of the daughter—this interest in keep-
ing up the business of her father, in-
stead of grieving more over his hurt.

  It was not to be denied that the
 daughter had a good deal of her father
 in her, and that she saw to it that a
 command of his business was at once
 placed in the hands of the lawyer, so
 no whit of interest should be lost or
 financial engagements voided. On the
 other hand, it was not to be denied,
 either, that she did exactly what would
 have pleased her father.

  The early hours of the morning saw
 the wounded man partially conscious
 and, with the physicians standing by,
 three members of the town constabu-
 lary were admitted to him. The fol-
 lowing dialogue took place, Ruprecht
 being able to answer only in monosyl-
 lables and with the greatest difficulty:

A Common Name

  “ Who struck you ?”

  “ Schmidt.”

  “ What is this Schmidt? Where does
 he reside?”

  “ In the Most"

“ With what did he strike you ?”

   “ Hatchet.”

  “ How did you know him ?”

  “His voice.”

   “ Wras he indebted to you ?”

 <( \T >1	J

        o.

  “ What was his motive?”

   “ Quarrel.”

   Ruprecht, at that point, gasped and
 turned a peculiar color and the phy-
 sicians permitted only one more ques-
 tion.

  “ What is this Schmidt?”

  “ Woodcutter.”

   The interrogation stopped there, but
 was renewed at noon, when practically
 the same replies were received, save
 that they were more vague and that
A MURDER CLASSIC

709

Ruprecht remained silent when, “ What
was the motive?” was put to him.

  The question was, what Schmidt was
it that Ruprecht had thus identified?

  The name of Schmidt is as common
in Germany as its English version of
Smith is among us. The police con-
sidered carefully. There were three
men by the name in the town.

  Two of them, who were brothers,
lived in the street called the “ Most ”
and also called the Walsh. It was
ascertained that one of these brothers
had been in prison in his youth, charged
with being a member of a gang of
thieves. The other brother, who went
by the name of Big Schmidt, was an
old acquaintance of Ruprecht’s, but had
had a quarrel with him over some
damages which he claimed, which had
occasioned a suit at law. The other
Schmidt, who was called Little
Schmidt, knew Ruprecht, but although
he had had no' quarrel with him, was
not very friendly to him, either.

Suspicion's Finger

  Ruprecht, in a lucid moment, was
asked which one of these men he meant
to accuse, but although he tried to
speak, he could not do so. So all three
were brought into the room where the
now dying man lay, in the hope that
he might make it clear which one of
them had killed him, but he was so far
gone that when he tried to lift his eyes
he lost consciousness. That test failed.

  The two brothers spoke to the
wounded man by name and said that
they wrere sorry to see him so ill. The
other Schmidt seemed restless and ill
at ease. First he said that he knew
the man in the bed and then he said
that he did not and then he said
that he thought it was “ the man Ru-
precht.”

  His manner was so peculiar that the
authorities, who were trying to use
psychology, although they did not
know it, decided to interrogate him
carefully and in such a way as to ease
his apprehensions.

  His replies confounded them.

  First, he said that on the night of
the attack he remained with his mother-
in-law at her house until eleven, and
then he said that he went home and
went to bed at nine. He protested his
entire innocence of the whole matter.
But he was so agitated that the ex-
amining judge decided to hold him for
further interrogation.

  The following day, Ruprecht died,
without regaining consciousness.

  The man, Christopher Schmidt, was
more and more under suspicion. There
were spots on the handle of his ax.
And, on interrogation, he produced a
mass of inconsistent and contradictory
statements which made the examining
judge hold his head and ask the pris-
oner to try, please, to make them a little
more comprehensible. But this did lit-
tle good. Schmidt stated that he had
gone home at eleven, at nine, at ten;
that his wife had gone home with him;
that she had stayed with the mother-
in-law, that she had gone home before
him. Every time that he made a state-
ment about the night of the murder he
told a totally different story.

  However, his friends and neighbors
insisted that this was the way he al-
ways talked and that it was never pos-
sible to believe a single word he said;
not because he intended to tell lies, but
because it was never possible for him
to remember the events of one hour
from another.

A Time Limit

  His mother-in-law stated that the
couple were accustomed to pass their
evenings with her, so as to save light
and fuel and that on the night in ques-
tion, Schmidt and his wife and his
child had all gone home together, but
that the wife, after putting the two to
bed, had returned to her mother’s house
for an hour. This was confirmed by
the landlady of the house where
Schmidt had his poor lodgings.

  The blow had been given between
twenty minutes after ten and half past
710

DETECTIVE FICTION WEEKLY

past ten. There was not the least doubt
about this narrow limit of time.

   It was finally established by the peo-
ple in Schmidt’s house and by neigh-
bors who saw him, his wife and his
child going home together, that
Schmidt entered his house with them
at half past nine. The landlady heard
him get into bed, and heard his wife
leave the house; heard his wife return
shortly before eleven, for the town
clock struck just afterward.

New Evidence

  The “ Hell ’’ alehouse was at the
other end of town, say, about a dozen
modern city blocks away. When
Schmidt really understood that he was
suspected of having killed Ruprecht,
he got his wits together and earnestly
represented to the examining magis-
trate that it would have been impos-
sible for him to rise, dress again, go
to the other end of town, get back, un-
dress and get into bed by the time that
his wife returned. That he really was
in bed when she returned was estab-
lished by the fact that his landlady
passed through the hall as the door was
open into the Schmidt rooms and saw
him there.

  The hatchet with which Schmidt did
his daily labor in the back yards of the
town was examined. There were some
odd stains on it which Schmidt said
■were caused by his having had an in-
fected thumb, which he had not tied
up, and which had been oozing pus for
several days. There were no chemists
at that time who could establish
whether this were the truth or not, but
the physicians tried very hard to settle
the question and came to the conclusion
that Schmidt was telling the truth. As
for his thumb being infected, there was
no doubt of that.

  The two other Schmidts had a couple
of the unbreakable alibis that the in-
vestigators were to encounter all along
the line. They had had a disagreement
with Ruprecht, or, rather, they had
been witnesses in a suit which had been

brought against him, but they had
helped rather than harmed his cause.
Another Schmidt was found, on the
outskirts of the town, and here w'e
meet writh the shadow of a clew. This
man had done woodcutting for Beirin-
ger, and he had been seen at the Beirin-
ger house several days before. He
stated that it was for the purpose of
asking for work, and Beiringer, al-
though he did not know that the man
had been interrogated, confirmed this.
This Schmidt also had an alibi, given
by a number of people.

  The authorities now turned their at-
tention to Beiringer and his wife. And
through the statements of Ruprecht’s
manservant and the statements of the
landlord of the alehouse, they found
something which looked very peculiar
indeed; something which the dead
man’s lawyer was obliged to confirm.
This was that Ruprecht had set the fol-
lowing day for the making of a new
will in which, while he left his entire
fortune to his daughter, he tied it up
so that her husband could never get
control of one thaler.

The Authorities Wonder

  Unless this will were made, the
daughter w'ould lose control of all that
her father w'ould leave her, it passing,
according to the marriage laws of that
time, into the exclusive possession of
her husband. There wTas an agreeable
delusion those days that no gentleman
would use such money save for the
comfort and happiness of his wrife!

  With the new will made, in which
the daughter would be secure in her
individual rights to the quite consider-
able fortune of her father, Beiringer
would be left entirely out in the cold.

  The daughter declared that she had
not told her husband of her father’s
intention, although he had talked the
matter over with her. Beiringer, in-
formed of the suspicions, showed
astonishment and indignation. The
servant stated that he had told no one
of what he knew. The lawyer, a close,
A MURDER CLASSIC

711

careful and cautious man, just the sort
that Ruprecht would have chosen to be
his man of business, indignantly de-
nied that he had ever said a word of
any affair which concerned a client of
his.

  The authorities thought that the
daughter had shown a lack of affection
in 'taking her father's keys, and that
she had been somewhat cold in looking
after his comfort after he was removed
to his own house. They thought that
she and her husband seemed to have
been very much reconciled from their
slightly aloof attitude of a few months
before, and they thought that Beiringer
seemed rather defiant.

A Sound Alibi

  It looked like a good case—until the
man sent running from the alehouse to
the Beiringer home reported Beiringer
as having just come in from a neigh-
boring alehouse at that time, which was
about eleven. Investigations proved
that Beiringer had been in the parlor
of such a place, a most respectable
house of entertainment called “ The
Golden Fish,” from half past nine to
within a few minutes of eleven, when
he had started out for his near-by
home. So there was another unbreak-
able alibi.

  The servant of Ruprecht was im-
plored to think: had anybody called,
during the day preceding his master’s
death, with whom there had been an
argument? The servant did as re-
quested and came up from the depths
of his mind with the statement that
three men, whom he knew to be oboe
players in the military band of the
town, had had some kind of an argu-
ment with his master.

  It was easy to verify this, and the
three men were taken in for question-
ing.

  Their story was that Proschl, with
two friends, Muhl and Spitzbart, had
called on Ruprecht, asking for an ex-
tension of the loan of twenty-two
florins, which was due that day. There

had been a good deal of talk, after
which Ruprecht had promised to wait
another day. Again the authorities
concluded that they had a good clew.
Again they were doomed to disapoint-
ment. All three of the men, during
the entire evening and until after
eleven, were among crowds of people,
playing for a dance!

  A fantastic theory, which was enter-
tained by a few people at the time, and
at which the modern investigator can-
not but look with interest, is that
Ruprecht was killed by his daughter,
and that, in the shock of seeing a
weapon descending, his first impression
was that a man with an ax was upon
him, but that, as he was dragged up
the stairs, he really remembered the
glimpse he had caught of the figure and
that it was a groan of horror which
escaped him.

The One Suspect

“ My daughter! My daughter!”

  His accusation of “ Schmidt ” might
have been the effort of the poor, be-
numbed brain, with its last conscious
thought, to protect the very hand which
had struck him down, the one hand
beloved in all the world. This would
explain the choice of the name, as hard
to fix on an individual as Smith. The
identification as “ woodcutter ” would
also fit several of them and increase
the general doubt. In this light, the
inability of the dying man to look up
when accused men were brought before
him, becomes the last exertion of an
iron will to protect a brutal and im-
pious child.

  Ruprecht’s daughter was the one
person whose time could not be entirely
accounted for during the time that the
crime might have been committed. To
be sure, she was at home when the man
brought the information to her that
her father had been attacked, but she
was notoriously a hardy woman, swift
of action. If she had struck at twenty-
two minutes after ten and instantly
had fled, she might well have reached
712

DETECTIVE FICTION WEEKLY

her home before either her husband or
the announcer of the disaster reached
there.

  It is in the imputation of the motive
that this theory is weak. It does not
seem that a woman, even granted that
she is far more hardened than she ap-
pears, would try such a brutal attack
on her own father, when what he pro-
posed to do the following day was
really for her benefit and would have
left her in an exceedingly independent
position.

  There was a sword in the home of
the Beiringers. Too late, it was ex-
amined. It was clean, of course,
either because it had not been used for
many years or because it had been
carefully wiped. There was no way,
then, of telling which that might be.

  There is one other possibility, of
course, and that is that Beiringer hired
some one from a distance to slip into
the town at twilight, to follow Rup-

recht from his home to whatever place
he might enter, and to do the deed—•
some one with an experienced sword
arm. The difficulty in the face of this
is that the town was reached by a stage
coach, and that every one arriving that
day and for days before was accounted
for—known to the drivers of the
coaches.

  The Ruprecht crime was committed
more than one hundred and ten years
ago, but it is still counted as one of the
high lights of murder history, and there
is hardly a writer on murder, hardly a
student of criminology, who has not
studied it. It was one of the first mys-
terious murders to be really carefully
studied on the spot with as much of
scientific thoroughness as could be used
at the time and with the knowledge of
the time.

  The Beiringers, or, rather, Herr
Beiringer, succeeded to the old man’s
money.

Solution of “Poison Gas”

    Here is the solution of the problem
  presented to Captain Curdy last week.
  Compare it with your own written solu-
  tion.

WEEMS could hardly collect him-
self on his next visit. He kept
staring in admiration at Cap-
tain Curdy.

  “ Our chemists have the evidence
you said would be necessary, but how
did you ever guess?”

  “ You might have, too,” smiled the
captain, “ except that it was so simple.
When you were outlining your theories
you recognized that closed windows
would have caused the death, but ap-
parently overlooked the simple explan-
ation that the windows might easily
have been covered over on the outside.

  “ Mentioning the empty adhesive
spindles and the large drawing paper
that littered Gordon’s room supplied
the rest. While Gordon was sketching
on the roof, he was considering in what
manner he could do away with
Schwartz, so that he could continue to
live upon Mrs. Schwartz’s bounty. He
measured the window’s width with the
paper, and then had his idea.

  “ That carbon monoxide, of fatal
quantity, is formed by large gas burn-
ers in a closed, small room, is frequent-
ly attested by newspaper stories, atid
is commonly known. He saw he could
shut off the air by covering the win-
dows with his drawing paper, and then
wondered how to fasten it on. Obvi-
ously, no sort of thumbtacks, as the
window frames were steel. He then,
perhaps, thought of passepartout
which artists sometimes use, and from
that, naturally passed to adhesive tape.

  “ He purchased the two rolls of ad-
hesive, placed them in his pockets—•
Jergen noticed how they bulged—and
went to the roof and hermetically
sealed the windows with his heavy, soft

paper by placing the edge of the tape
on the side of the protruding window
frames. He had purposely left his
paper on the roof, and went up after
allowing Schwartz time to fall asleep.

  “ He borrowed the clock, rose at five
when it went off. Went to the roof,
removed the paper and tape, put the
material in a portfolio, and started off
with it, as he had planned, after al-
lowing Jergen to establish that he was
in bed. He probably dropped the paper
in the river as he crossed on a ferry to
Jersey.”

  “ Marvelous!” said Weems. “ That’s
just what he said in his confession this
afternoon.”

  “ The adhesive would not leave a
mark visible to the eye on the side of
the steel frames, but, as your men
found when they carried out mv
orders, the microscopic camera showed
the marks, and enough of the sticky
matter could be scraped off to be ana-
lyzed. You also found his finger-prints
on the spindles.

  “ I eliminated Wrangel as too im-
petuous, and Cholmondeley as too
stupid for that clever crime. Emily
might have done it, but I think you will
find she and Cholmondeley were mar-
ried during the night at Connecticut.”
“ Amazing!” said Weems. “ I was
over there just now, and Mrs.
Schwartz told me.”

  “ I think any of them might have
killed the poor old fellow, if they had
been clever enough.”

  “ Mrs. Schwartz was in high enough
spirits to-day,” Weems said. “ Here is
a check for five thousand as a small
token of the company’s gratitude.”

  “ I wish you'd have a repair man
fix our little burner in the closet,” Cap-
tain Curdy said whimsically. “ I don’t
want to be found dead and have Victor
here suspected.”

  K. A. MeP., Yonkers, N. Y.—You
have lots of temperament, and allow
it to rule your life. A person who has
the faculty to think ahead and foresee
the ramifications of a problem even De-
fore it has been presented to you for
solution. You are clear-minded and
discriminating, and appear to have a
keen sense of the difference between
what is wise and unwise.	v

  Another thing I notice is that you
possess considerable business and tech-
nical ability, and ought to be very suc-
cessful in everything you undertake in
the industrial world.

  To come to your negative traits, or
what I would call your “ near vir-
tues.” You find it hard to make up
your mind, especially about trivial
matters, which, however, are of more
importance to us than the bigger
things of life. You are rather unob-
servant, and this leads you to overlook

factors which are essential in your siz-
ing up of a situation. In other words,
you look, but you don’t see.

  You are the kind of fellow who
doesn’t believe in telling all he knows.
You like to keep a little reservoir of
facts for your own personal consump-
tion, and not for the benefit of the rest
of society. Through this trait you are
apt to be called “ dumb ” by your fel-
lows, while all the time you are usually
two jumps ahead of them.

  You seem to be a “ good sport,” and
enjoy going to places and doing things.
The baseball and football campus
would have a great attraction for you,
and anything pertaining to sport would
get your attention.

  Altogether, you are a healthv-mind-
ed fellow who has a good head on his
shoulders, and one who is capable of
making lots of money as well as lots of
friends.

  K. P., Richmond, Va.—You appear
to be extremely logical in all your men-
tal processes, and can reason things out
carefully and accurately. You Avould
be prudent in everything you under-
took, and would never be guilty of
making rash decisions. Another thing
about you is you must know the why
and the wherefore of every problem.
You are a typical Missourian.

  I see also that you are clever, and
that you possess great nimbleness of
mind. Any one with as alert a brain
as you should be entertaining company,
for you will never allow your conversa-
tion to become trite and boring. In
addition to this you have quick and
vivid fancy, which you employ to en-
rich and enliven your ideas. You are
one of those interestingly candid
people who do so much to leaven
the dull lump of society. Your
frankness, however, may get you
into trouble at times, but after all,
the real stimulators of public opin-
ion have been men like yourself who
were not afraid to speak their minds.
You are, at the same time, good na-
tured and gracious so that there is little
danger of your ever causing offense by
your frankness.

  To come to your negative qualities,
I notice that patience is one trait which
is conspicuous by its absence from your
personality. You cannot refrain from
outbursts against those who bore you,
or who you think are inferior. You
love to get into an argument, and this
scrappy nature of yours is expressed in
a quarrelsomeness which is hardly
commendable. You are inclined to pick
fights when they are not necessary.
You have other besetting weaknesses in

your make-up, but space forbids dis-
cussion.

Li-l	CrC(

  W. F., Seattle, Wash.—One of your
strongest traits is mental alertness and
keenness of vision. Your mind is never
dormant and, as a rule, would be two
jumps ahead of the other fellow. Fore-
thought is also an evident characteris-
tic in you. You are essentially pru-
dent, and think twice, albeit quickly,
before taking any step. Your concen-
trative faculties are not wanting bv any
means. You have the habit of sticking
to whatever plans or routes you have
mapped out, no matter what dissuading
influences come along.

   I would call you a fighter, in the best
sense of the word. Your mentality is
always master of the situation, and no
“ bogy ” of self-pity gets much of a
chance with you. I would call you a
business man to the finger tips. You
are never happier than when you are
wrestling with a business problem. You
have rare executive ability and are full
of enterprise and energy.

   To come to your negative qualities,
I see right away that you are very
bigoted in your ideas of men and
things. Your opinion is the only thing
in the world worth listening to, ac-
cording to you. I would imagine you
to be very autocratic at the breakfast
table. You love to lord it over those
at home, to the point of meanness at
times. Egotism also peeps out here
and there in your nature. Discourage
this tendency at once otherwise it may
neutralize your other commendable
characteristics. As far as the spending
of money is concerned with you, you
might be taken for a Scotchman any
day. I believe you would walk a mile
to save a nickel carfare. Frugality is

all right, but we must never forget sive is a great detriment to your ulti-
that there are no pockets in a coffin., mate success in life. A nature like
Think that over.

  A. E., Pasadena, Calif.—By your
handwriting I see that you are a man
who lives much more for the physical
side of life than for the mental. In
other words, you exercise your body
more than you do your mind. Your
disposition is essentially simple, and
you don’t believe in artificiality, either
in your own personal life, or in your
relations with others. I like your re-
serve of patience and self-control. You
are not easily riled over the hard
knocks that confront you from day to
day. To you the latter are like water
on a duck’s back.

  For a man I think you are far too
reserved. Your desire to be unobtru-

yours lets people walk all over it. You
like to be seen, and not heard. Tha.t
may be all right for children, but no
fully grown man has any business to
act in that manner. What you need
more than anything else is self-asser-
tion.

  I notice you have an essentially prac-
tical mind. You go in for moderation
in all things. You love order and dis-
like anything savoring of untidiness,
I also see an affectionate strain in you.
You are-not, however, very effusive in
your love-making. You pour no per-
fume over your language when you ad-
dress your loved one. You will never
turn any woman’s head with your elo-
quence, nor your flattery. And most
women like both. Altogether, you are
an individual who has as much a place
in the world as the prize fight promoter
or the politician. Your work is done
quietly and conscientiously and is
oftentimes of more value to humanity
than the activities of the band-wag-
oners.

  FLASHES FROM READERS

             Where Readers and Editor Get Together to Gossip
             and Argue, and Everyone Speaks Up His Mind

ONE of the best known writers of
fact stories for Detective Fic-
tion Weekly is Robert W.
Sneddon, author of “ The Killer Who
Couldn’t Forget ” in this issue. We
asked Mr. Sneddon to give you an ac-
count of himself. Here it is:

  Though I have been an American for a
number of years, my native heath is Scotland.
They used to say I looked and wrote like
Stevenson, but other critics have said 1 wrote
like Merrick* Maupassant, Merimee, Barrie,
and Bierce, and I defy any one to say I look
like them all. I look like myself and write
like Sneddon.

  Destined for the law, I studied arts and
law at Glasgow University. I am both artful
and lawful, but no lawyer. While I was en-
grossing deeds in an Edinburgh law office I
was attempting to write vaudeville sketches
and getting a knowledge of stage life. Then
1 went to London and learned how easy it
was to lose money overnight In the theater.
Paris next saw me and gave me a liberal edu-
cation of sorts, and then I sailed for New
York in quest of fame and fortune. Page
both for me, boy. I’ve been waiting for them
a long time in the drafty lobby.

  I discovered that I could not get a living
honestly, so I became a writer and satisfied
my ambitions. Within a month of landing
I was contributing to Judge and Puck. 1
tried fiction. The Forum took my first story—
of Russian East Side New York; the Swart
Set, a story laid in Normandy; and Snappy
Stories, just born, a Parisian story. And so
it runs. I’ve written and sold hundreds, dra-
matic, whimsical, highbrow, lowbrow, mostly
with European settings. Pictorial Review
readers like my fantasy, and probably would
not connect me with the gentleman who likes

717

to write about circus clowns, side show folk,
waiters, old wrecks o£ humanity, Menjou
types, mysterious evildoers, gay young ladies,
Scottish clergymen and lawyers, orphans, Ger-
man musicians and ghost hunters. My “ Mark
Shadow” stories are guaranteed to outchill
any Frigidaire.

  For a time I figured in hundreds of columns
of newspaper reviews as the American Barrie.
This was w'hile my play, “ The Might-Have-
Beens,” was in vaudeville for two seasons.
“ Camouflage ” also played two seasons and
was turned into a sensational show at Luna
Park. And little theaters have played others.
Little theaters, write in, please.

  Lots of people in England and the colonies
bought my novel, “Galleon’s Gold,” and then
“ Monsieur _X,” a detective story with thrills,
which has just been published in this country.

  How did I come to be a crime expert, you
ask. Because it was easier to write a crime
than to commit one. I am a canny Scot at
heart. But I can honestly say that second to
the thrill I got when I heard a crowded theater
laugh and sob over my play, comes the real
feeling of pleasure when some one writes in
and tells me, or you, friend editor, that they
like my true stories of crime. 1 try to make
them human as well as strictly accurate.

 THE WESTMINSTER BANK ROBBERY

  Here is a correction to “ The Rov-
ing ‘ Camera-Eye,’ ” one of Charles
Somerville’s stories, and some addi-
tional light on the daring robbery men-
tioned in it:

Dear Sir:

  In your issue of January 26, Mr. Somerville,
in his entertaining sketches of “ Camera-Eye,"
is somewhat inaccurate in his relation of the
Westminster Bank robbery.
718

DETECTIVE FICTION WEEKLY

  I can speak advisedly, having been employed
in a logging camp near the vicinity at the
time.

  The locale was the New Westminster, Brit-
ish Columbia, branch of the Bank of Montreal.
New Westminster at that time was a city of
about twenty thousand people and is on the
Frazer Rivi'r, about seventeen miles distant
from Vancouver.

  The Canadian banking system is consider-
ably different from any United States system.
It is, in fact, a chain banking system. The
various banks are not independent and in-
dividual banks, as in the United States, but
are dependent banks, subject to the head office
of the parent corporation. Consequently the
notes stolen from the bank did not bear on
them the name of Westminster, or any other
reference to New Westminster. The notes,
however, were numbered and bore the name
of the Bank of Montreal. The amount stolen
was approximately three hundred thousand
dollars.

  The date of the robbery was September,
tqii, and not some time prior to December,
1909, as Mr. Somerville has it.

  It was a very smooth job, as the bank was
next door to the police station, and the police
didn't know anything about the matter until
the bank officials reported the robbery to them
the next morning.

  Prior to the war, Canada issued no metallic
money of greater value than the fifty-cent
piece. Dollar issues, and greater were either
Dominion treasury notes, or bank notes. The
treasury also issued a note of twenty-five
cents, but this, I understand, has been discon-
tinued and outstanding notes called in.

Yours truly,

                          J. M. Bedford,

                         Hot Springs, Ark.

HOSPITAL CHEER

 From Canada comes word that
Detective Fiction Weekly is cheer-
ing up the boys in the Central Alberta
Sanatorium.

Dear Sir:

  Just a few words in praise of your maga-
zine. 1 think it is the best magazine of its
kind on the market. The quality and variety
of its stories can't be beat. All the fellows
in the ward read it and they sure like it. It
is more popular than free drinks in Scotland.

   1 read all the stories, and I think the variety
is just right. The true stories are very inter-
esting and many of them prove the old adage
that " The truth is stranger than fiction.” The
short stories are my dish and the more excit-
ing the better. 1 also like a good serial
such as “ The Mystery Maker ” or “ The Three
Crows.” Those two were sure great.

   I like the following characters particularly:
Riordan and Brady, Calhoun, Tug Norton,
and Craig Kennedy. “ The Riddle of the Tor-
tillon ” was certainly a thriller. It was a pleas-
ant change from the ordinary run of serials.
I would like to see more of its type in the
future.

In closing I wish your magazine every suc-
cess and when better stories are written De-
tective Fiction Weekly will publish them.
Yours sincerely,

                            Alfred Ibbotson.
      Central Alberta Sanatorium, Calgary,
      Alta., Canada.

HE LIKES RIORDAN

 The gentleman from Denver likes
 the Riordan stories. If the voice of
 the people is a final proof, he shows
 great judgment. You and many thou-
 sands of others, Mr. Birch!

 Gentlemen :

 Allow one more reader to put in a few
 words in regard to your magazine. It’s great!
 The best detective and mystery stories one
 can get anywhere for a thin dime. My favor-
 ite character is Riordan, the hard-boiled but
 human police detective. The other stories are
 good, except the Whitcher Bemis, which 1
 cannot enjoy reading.

 Another thing I enjoy is the cipher codes
 running in the present series. In fact, we all
 have gone bughouse over them, and there is
 almost a family row every Wednesday eve-
 ning when I come home with a copy of
 Flynn’s in my pocket.

                             C. R. Birch,
                             Denver, Colo.

1AST week’s crypt, “ Poise,” by G.

Fulton, reprinted herewith, pro-
^ vides a neat problem in vowel de-
termination. Ordinarily one seizes im-
mediately upon a predominating sym-
bol as a possible substitute for e, the
most used letter. But here the symbol

O	is somewhat baffling for the very
fact that it occurs no less than thirty-
two times.

  In the average message the vowels
will total about forty per cent of the
whole number of letters. On this basis
there should be about thirty-eight
vowels in the present example. And
taking O as one vowel, the other
vowels, if any, would probably have
to be represented by low frequency
symbols, a rather unusual occurrence.

  That O is a vowel, however, seems
clearly indicated by its use before and
after the doubled low frequency G in
the last group, and by its conjunction
with the low frequency pairs WY and
HL in groups five and nine. And that
this vowel is probably e is suggested by
the OO in group one and the penulti-
mate O occurring seven times in the
terminals -OT, -OP, -OR, and -ON.

  The commonest two-letter endings
with e in this position are -cd, -er, -es,
and -cn.

  Frequencies suggest P as s, and
T as d. With these values the first

speediest. And substituting through-
out, as shown, deterrent and represent,
both with the same letters missing, are
next to fall. The whole translation,
as given herewith, soon follows.

  This week’s crypts promise a lot of
fun. No. i has plenty of clews. BY

easily guess, the commonest two-word
sequence in the language. No. 2 is a
first attempt, and is rather difficult. But

IT was in a Japanese auction room that Pat Mur gey ran across the crazy
kimona—that cheap, shoddy little garment with its amazingly riotous
design in crimson, yellow and blue—which was destined to lead him into
one of the most puzzling situations of his eventful career.

     At ten dollars and fifty cents, Pat Murgey had apparently been swindled
on that kimona, for all its hectic color and crazy design. Yet here was a suave
Oriental offering him twenty—fifty—a hundred dollars for that same
kimona—and what puzzled Pat was the fact that the Japanese had stood idly
by and watched him while he bid the garment in!

     Pat Murgey had bought that kimona for a girl. He didn’t want to sell it.
Besides, there was something queer about a man who would let another bid in
an article and then offer him ten times what he paid for it.

    Pat kept the kimona.

     Then, suddenly, the very ground seemed to sprout menacing little yellow-
skinned figures rushing toward him from all directions.

     And thus starts the intriguing series of adventures you will read about
