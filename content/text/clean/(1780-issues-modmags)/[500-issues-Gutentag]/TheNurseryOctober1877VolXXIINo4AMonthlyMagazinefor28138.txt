THE PARROT THAT PLAYED TRUANT . O ] LD Miss Dorothy Draper had a parrot . It was one of the few things she loved . And the parrot seemed to love her in return . Miss Dorothy would hang the cage outside of her window every sunny day . Sometimes an idle boy would come along , and poke a stick between the wires ; and then the old lady would say , “ Boy , go away ! ” But one day , when the window was open , and the door of the cage was open also , Polly thought it was a good time to play truant . So she hopped out , rested on the sill a moment , and then flew into the street , from tree to tree , and from lamp-post to lamp-post . Poor Miss Dorothy was in despair . How should she get back her lost pet ? She called in a policeman , and he advised her to get out a handbill , offering a reward . So in an hour this notice was pasted on the walls near by :— LOST !— A green-and-white parrot . It answers to the name of Polly , and can talk quite plainly . It says , “ Boy , go away ! ” also , “ Polly wants a cracker , ” and “ No , you do n't ! ” Any one finding this bird shall , on returning it to its afflicted owner , Miss D. Draper , No . 10 , Maiden Place , receive a reward of two dollars . Little Tony Peterkin was walking home from school , and wishing he had money enough to buy a copy of Virgil without going to his mother for it ,— for she was a widow , and poor ,— when he saw a man pasting this handbill on a wall . Tony read it , and said aloud , “ Oh , I wish I could find that parrot ! ” A girl who heard him said , “ I saw a parrot just now on one of the trees in Lake Street . ” — “ Did you ? ” said Tony ; and off he ran . The parrot had flown from the tree to the top of the lamp-post ; and when Tony got there , two women , a newsboy , and a policeman were looking up at the strange fowl . It was the work of a second for Tony to spring at the iron post , and begin climbing up . “ No , you do n't ! ” cried the parrot . That frightened Tony , so that he almost dropped ; but he took heart when he thought of the two dollars and a new fresh copy of Virgil . Up he climbed ; but just as he was going to put his hand on the little cross-bar under the lamp , “ Boy , go away ! ” cried Poll . Tony 's heart beat at these words ; but he held on . “ Poll , Poll , pretty Poll ! ” cried he : “ come and get a cracker ! ” — “ Polly wants a cracker , ” replied the bird . The truth was , Polly was tired of the street , and wanted to get back to Miss Dorothy . So , when Polly heard Tony 's kind words , she flew down to the cross-bar , and , when he held out his hand , she lighted on it , and Tony slid with her down the post to the ground . “ Well done , my lad , ” said the policeman . He went with Tony , carrying the bird , to No . 10 , Maiden Place ; and Miss Dorothy was so much pleased that she gave Tony three dollars instead of two . On his way home he bought that copy Of Virgil . DORA BURNSIDE . Illustration Illustration FEEDING THE DUCKS . A MILD summer day , and one , two , three , four children sitting on the ground by the pond , and feeding the ducks ! But I think I hear the larger girl , who is standing up , say to the sitters , “ Children , do n't you know better than to sit there on the damp earth ? You will every one of you catch a cold . Get up this instant . ” That is what the larger girl ought to say ; for many children take bad colds by sitting on the grass . The other day , as I went through the Central Park in New York , I saw a maid in charge of three children , one of them an infant , and she was letting them lie at full-length on the grass . I told her she must not do so ; but she said the weather was warm , and there was no danger . As I knew the parents of the children , I told her she must take the children up at once , and let them sit on the seats near by . At length she obeyed me . Two days afterwards I called on the parents of the children , and then learned that every one of the little ones was ill with a cold . I told the mother what I had seen at the Central Park and she told the maid that never again must she let the children sit on the bare grass . The maid promised she would not do so again . AUNT MATILDA . A BABY LAY . Illustration WHAT does the kitten say ? “ Mew , mew , mew ! ” She shall have some nice milk , warm and new . Illustration Up jumps the dog , and says , “ Bow , wow , wow ! I 'm as good as kitty , and I 'm hungry now . ” Illustration What does the cow say ? “ Moo , moo , moo ! ” And the pretty little calf tries to say so too . Illustration “ Ba-a ! ” says the little lamb ,— “ baa , baa , baa ! ” What does she mean ? Is she calling her mamma ? Illustration The rooster struts around , and cries , “ Cock-a-doodle-doo ! ” As if that were just about the only thing he knew ! Illustration On the roof the gentle dove says , “ Coo , coo , coo ! Love me , little girls and boys , for I love you . ” Illustration What does the hen say ? “ Cluck , cluck , cluck ! ” As she scratches for her chickens , and has good luck . Illustration What does the bird say ? “ Peep , peep , peep ! ” As , early in the morning , she rouses us from sleep . What does our baby say ? “ Goo , goo , goo ! ” See the loving glances in her eyes so blue ; How we rush to take her , at the slightest call ! Oh ! the darling baby is the sweetest pet of all . ELLA . Illustration CHESTNUT-GATHERING . DID you ever go chestnut-gathering ? Such fun as it is ! especially when a lot of girls and boys go together . On one of my father 's farms there were many chestnut-trees ; and every autumn , after the first frost , when the leaves were all turning , and beginning to fall , we used to have chestnut-gatherings . The boys used to get long poles , with which they would beat off the nuts . Sometimes they would climb the trees , and shake or beat off such nuts as they could not reach from below . And we girls used to help pick them up , and put them into baskets . Some years chestnuts are very scarce . I remember one year there was only one tree that had any nuts on ; and we could not reach them : not even a man could climb it . One day , Henry , who was a very kind man , said , “ Perhaps we will cut that tree down : it will make good rails , and then you children can get all the nuts . ” We no sooner heard this than we gave him no peace till it was done . And such an event ! For we were to see the tree cut down . We children were stationed far away from danger ; and another man and Henry chopped and chopped , till it was almost ready to fall , when they stepped back , and , in less than a minute , there was such a whistling through the air , such a crashing , and breaking of branches , and then a loud thud ! The tree was down . I felt quite breathless with excitement ; and so did the others ; for it was some minutes before we ran up to see how many nuts there were . Oh , such lots ! all spread around , and beaten out of the prickly burrs , all ready for us . I cannot remember how many we gathered , but it was some bushels ; and we could not take all that day : so we concluded to return the next afternoon after school . Illustration And what do you think ? When we got there , not a nut was to be found ! The little squirrels had been busy in our absence , and had taken away every one of them . Saucy squirrels ! But we did not grudge them the nuts ; for we had plenty . AUNT JENNY . THE PIGS . THEY really are a pretty sight , My little pigs , so small and white ! Their tails have such a curious kink ; Their ears are lined with palest pink : They frisk about as brisk and gay As school-boys on a holiday . I watch them scamper to and fro : How clean they look ! how fast they grow ! But they are only pigs , dear me ! And that is all they 'll ever be . Beside their pen , above its wall , A garden-rose grows fresh and tall , Its blossoms , wet with morning dew , The sweetest flowers that ever grew . With every passing wind that blows Comes scattered down a milk-white rose , In leaves like scented flakes of snow , Upon the little pigs below . They only grunt , “ Ur , Ur , ” and say , “ We want more milk and meal to-day . The flowers may bloom , the flowers may fall , ‘ Tis no concern of ours at all . ” For they are only pigs , dear me ! And that is all they 'll ever be . Upon the rose 's highest bough There often comes a robin now , And sings a song so sweet and clear , It makes one happy just to hear ; For never yet , on summer day , Was sung a more delightful lay . What care the little pigs below ? The bird may come , the bird may go ; For while he sings , “ Quee , quee ! ” they squeal , “ We want some milk , we want some meal ! ” For they are only pigs , dear me ! And that is all they 'll ever be . MARIAN DOUGLAS . A DAY WITH THE ALLIGATORS . I WANT to tell the young folks who read “ The Nursery ” something of my visit to Florida last winter . We first went to Jacksonville , which lies on the St. John 's River , and is a very pleasant city . I wish you would find it on the map . One day , as I sat in the reading-room of the hotel , I heard shouts of laughter , followed by the clapping of hands . “ What can it be ? ” thought I , throwing down the newspaper I was reading , and running into the corridor . There I saw five or six little reptiles , about half the length of my arm , that seemed to be running a race over the canvas carpet with which the floor was covered . A number of people were looking on . They appeared to be highly amused by the queer movements of the creatures . “ What are they ? Lizards ? ” cried I . “ Lizards ! No : they are young alligators , ” said a little girl , in a tone that implied pity for my ignorance . “ Alligators ! ” said I , retreating in alarm , as one of them came towards me . “ Oh , you coward ! ” cried the little girl , laughing . “ They are too small to hurt you . See me . ” And , saying this , she took one of them up in her apron , and brought it towards me . I ran into the reading-room , and she ran after me ; but when she saw that I was really afraid of the reptile , she took it back to the corridor , and placed it on the floor . These little alligators grow to be huge creatures , sometimes more than twenty feet long . They live in the creeks and little rivers that run into the St. John 's . They rarely go very far from the shore . They live partly on land and partly in the water . In Florida the weather in January is often quite as warm as it is in the Northern States in June . So on a fine winter day , my father took my sister and me on board the steamer “ Mayflower ” for a trip upon the St. John 's River , and up some of the small streams , where alligators may be found . We went some thirty miles towards the south , and then turned into a small river , where the scenery on both sides resembled that given in the picture . Cypress-swamps and high trees overgrown with moss everywhere met our view . On the banks , and generally on fallen logs , might be seen alligators basking in the sun . Many of the passengers in the steamboat had brought pistols and guns , with which to fire at the poor alligators . This is a very cruel and useless sport , for the alligators do no harm to anybody . I saw ladies and young girls firing at them . We passed some fifty alligators on our way . Father and another gentleman took a boat , and rowed some distance up a creek . There we saw an alligator with a young one by its side . The young are very small , compared with the full-grown reptile . You can see from the picture , that the alligator is not handsome ; but that is no reason why bullets should be lodged in its hide . I came to the conclusion that firing pistols at these animals was poor and mean sport . What a lovely day it was ! and how we enjoyed the excursion ! Just think of sitting in your summer clothing on a day in January , and passing through scenery where the trees and shrubs are all green . We returned to Jacksonville just in time to see the sun set , and we shall not soon forget our visit among the alligators . UNCLE CHARLES 'S NEPHEW . Illustration THE SPIDER AND HER FAMILY . EVERY child has seen spiders in plenty , spinning their webs in some corner ; or , after the web or tent is securely fastened and finished , lying in wait for some unfortunate fly or mosquito . Illustration Oftentimes in these webs small brown bags are to be seen , and these , if opened , will be found to contain a great many little eggs which the spider has laid ; or , sometimes when you open them , you will find that the eggs have just hatched , and that there is a bag full of tiny spiders that have not yet seen the light . Spiders indeed have as many children sometimes as the “ Old woman who lived in a shoe ; ” but , unlike that famed personage , they seem to know just what to do . It is very interesting to watch them , and see how they manage their little ones . One day as I was walking on a country road , where there was not much travel , my attention was caught by a large spider in the dust at my feet , so large that I stopped to look at it . Its body seemed rough and thick , while its legs were short . I took a stick , and poked it , when , presto change ! my spider had a small , round , smooth body , and long legs . Truly this was more strange than any sleight-of-hand trick I had ever seen . I had heard of snakes and frogs shedding their skins , and many other queer stories of animals and insects , but of nothing at all like this . I stooped closer to the ground to see if I could get a clew to the mystery , and found that the dust all about the large spider was alive with little ones that she had just shaken off . What a load ! And how did they ever get up on her back ? Did they run up her slender legs , and crowd and cling on ? How I wished I knew the spider language , that I might find out why this mother weighed herself down with such a burden of little ones as she walked the street ! Was she giving them an airing , and showing them the world ? or had the broom of some housemaid swept away her web , and forced her thus to take flight to save her family from destruction ? Perhaps she had been burned out . Or was it the first day of May to her ? and had her landlord forced her out of her house because she could not pay the rent ? Alas ! she could not tell me ; and I left her there in the road with all her little ones about her . E. M. DAVIS . Illustration HOW TO DRAW A GOOSE . Illustration The Goose has a body the shape of an egg . With a round head a long neck and bill . When the weather is cold she can stand on one leg With some wings she can fly if she will . Now we give her a tail more for beauty than use And out of our egg comes a very nice goose . WHY UNCLE RALPH DID NOT HIT THE DEER . MANY years ago , when I was a little fellow , I went on a sail with my Uncle Ralph on one of the prettiest of our northern lakes . The day was fine , the air was mild but fresh , and the hills and banks around us were clothed in green . Besides Uncle Ralph , in the boat were my Aunt Mary , and cousins Walter and Susan Brent . Uncle Ralph was a sportsman , and he had a gun , with which he hoped to bring down a deer , in case he should see one . Illustration I did not at all like this part of his plan . I knew it would mar my own and my aunt 's pleasure , if we were made to see the death of a noble stag or a gentle fawn . But I was too fond of a sail to express my dislike of Uncle Ralph 's plan . At the foot of a hill we stopped in our little boat to pick berries . Aunt Mary said she would stay and read . The rest of us went with Uncle Ralph to a clearing near by , to pick raspberries . We had not been gone long , when Uncle Ralph sent me back for a mug with which to get water from a cool spring . As I came within sight of the boat , I saw Aunt Mary take the ramrod of the gun , extract the bullet , and then put in fresh wadding , and ram it down . I understood it all , but said nothing . After we had got berries and water enough , we set sail again , and this time for the opposite shore , where Uncle Ralph 's keen eyes had detected a stag and two fawns . We landed in a little cove out of sight of the deer . Uncle Ralph took his gun , and crept through the woods . In about fifteen minutes we heard him fire . Aunt Mary smiled , and took up her book . Soon Uncle Ralph came back . “ Where 's your game , Ralph ? ” asked Aunt Mary . “ Will you believe it , ” said he : “ I got within thirty feet of them ; had the fairest shot that a fellow could possibly have , but somehow I missed my aim — did n't so much as graze one of them . ” “ Well , I 'm not sorry for it , ” said Aunt Mary . “ We shall enjoy our luncheon under the trees all the better . ” I looked at her , and laughed , but she checked me with a “ Hush ! ” ALBERT MASON . FAITHFUL DANDY . MR. BAXTER , a poor laboring-man , was the owner of a fine dog , whose name was Dandy . Having to remove from one village to another in the State of Maine , Mr. Baxter hired a small wagon on which his furniture was packed . Then he led the horse , while Dandy followed behind . When he came to the place where he was to stop , Mr. Baxter unloaded his wagon , but was sorry to find that a chair and a basket were missing from the back-part of the wagon , and that Dandy , also , could not be found . The day passed ; and , as the dog did not appear , the poor man feared that something must have happened to him . Illustration The next day , as Mr. Baxter was on his way back to the old cottage to take away another load , he heard the bark of a dog , which sounded very much like Dandy 's . Judge how glad he was when he saw by the roadside , not only his lost property , but his faithful Dandy , seated erect by the chair and basket , keeping strict guard over them . They had fallen from the wagon when Mr. Baxter was not looking ; but Dandy had seen them , and , like a good dog , felt it his duty to stay behind and guard what belonged to his master . Although left for so long a time without food , the faithful creature had never quitted the spot where the chair and basket had fallen . But , when he saw his master , how glad was poor Dandy ! He leaped up , put his paws on the man 's shoulders , and barked with joy . “ Good Dandy ! good Dandy ! ” said Mr. Baxter : “ you must be hungry , old fellow ! Come along : you shall have a good dinner for this . While I have a crust of bread , I 'll share it with you , you noble old dog . ” UNCLE CHARLES . LEARN YOUR LESSON . YOU 'LL not learn your lesson by crying , my man , You 'll never come at it by crying , my man ; Not a word can you spy , for the tear in your eye , Then put your mind on it , for surely you can . Only smile on your lesson , ‘ twill smile upon you ; How glibly the words will then jump into view ! Each word to its place all the others will chase , Till you 'll wonder to find how well you can do . If you cry , you will make yourself stupid or blind , And then not an answer will come to your mind ; But cheer up your heart , and you 'll soon have your part , For all things grow easy when hearts are inclined . C . EMMA AND HER DOLL . Illustration EMMA has placed her doll Flora against the pillow . She says , “ Now , dear Flora , I want you to be very good to-morrow , for I am to have company . It is my birthday . ” Illustration Then Emma sat down in a chair , and said to herself , “ Why , what an old person I shall be ! I shall be four years old ; and I shall have to go to school soon , and read in my books . I love to look at the pictures now . ” Illustration Emma got down from the chair , and placed Flora in it , and said : “ I want you to be very still now , my child , for I am going to say my evening prayers . You must not cry ; you must not stir ; for I shall not like it at all if you make the least noise . ” Illustration Then Emma said her prayers , and Flora kept quite still all the while . “ Now I shall take off my shoes , and get into bed , ” said Emma ; and then she thanked Flora for behaving so well . A . B. C . Illustration OUR OLD BILLY . WE call him old Billy ; but he is not really old : he is a young horse , and as full of capers as any puppy . After he has been standing in the barn for two or three days , he acts like a wild creature when he is taken out , and will whisk round corners , and scamper up and down the hill , as if he really meant to tear every thing to pieces . But just fill the carriage up with ladies or babies , and he will step along as carefully as if he thought an extra joggle would break some of them . He is very fond of my aunt , who usually drives him ; and , when she goes to ride , he always expects her to give him something good ,— an apple , or a crust , or a lump of sugar . If she has nothing for him , he will grab the corner of her veil , or the ribbons on her hat , and chew them , to teach her not to forget him next time ; and he will lap her face and hands , like a dog . If she goes into a store , and stays longer than he thinks necessary , he will step across the sidewalk , carriage and all , and try to get his head in at the door to look for her . There is another horse in the barn where he is kept ,— a very quiet , well-behaved nag , named Tom ; and sometimes , when Billy feels naughty , he will put his head over the side of the stall and nip Tom , not enough to hurt much , but just enough to tease him , and make him squeal . One day auntie heard a great clattering in the barn , and went out to see what was the matter . When she opened the door , both horses were in their stalls , and all was quiet . She noticed that the meal-chest was open : so she closed it , and went out . Before she reached the house , the noise began again , and she went quietly back , and peeped in at the window . There was Billy , dipping his nose into the meal-chest , which he had opened . “ Billy , what are you doing ? ” said auntie ; and it was fun enough to see him whisk into his stall , and stand there as quiet and demure as a cat that had just been caught eating up the cream . Billy had slipped the halter , and so set himself free . Since then he has been fastened more securely ; yet he still succeeds in freeing himself once in a while . IDA T. THURSTON . THE THRUSH FEEDING THE CUCKOO . THE cuckoo is a queer bird . It arrives in England about the middle of April , and departs in the autumn for the woods of Northern Africa . In every language the well-known notes of the male bird have suggested its name . Illustration In its habits it is shy ; and its voice may be often heard whilst the eye seeks in vain to find the bird itself . Its food consists of caterpillars and various insects . The female cuckoo makes no nest , and takes no care of her young . How do you suppose she does ? Having a wide bill , she takes up in it one of her eggs , which she puts in the nest of some other bird that feeds on insects . The strange nurses to whom the cuckoo confides her young become not only good mothers to them , but neglect their own children to take care of the young cuckoos . As the young cuckoo thrives and grows strong , he thrusts the other birds out of the nest , so that he may have all the room to himself . For five weeks or more his adopted mother supplies him with food . In the picture a thrush is represented as feeding a young cuckoo , that has probably driven off all the thrush 's own children . DORA BURNSIDE . JIPPY AND JIMMY . JIPPY and Jimmy were two little dogs : They went to sail on some floating logs . The logs rolled over , the dogs rolled in ; And they got very wet , for their clothes were thin . Jippy and Jimmy crept out again : They said , “ The river is full of rain ! ” They said , “ The water is far from dry ! Ky-hi ! ky-hi ! ky-hi ! ky-hi ! ” Jippy and Jimmy went shivering home : They said , “ On the river no more we 'll roam ; And we wo n't go to sail until we learn how ,— Bow-wow , bow-wow , bow-wow , bow-wow ! ” LAURA E. RICHARDS . Illustration THE JOLLY OLD COOPER . A JOLLY old cooper am I , And I 'm mending this tub , do you see ? The workmen are gone , and I am alone , And their tools are quite handy for me . Now hammer and hammer away ! This hoop I must fit to the tub : One , two — but I wish it would stay — The workmen have gone to their grub . How pleased they will be when they find That I can do work to their mind ! Yes , a jolly old cooper — But stop ! What 's this ? Where 's the tub ? Oh , despair ! Knocked into a heap there it lies . To face them now , how shall I dare ? The knocks I have given the tub Will be echoed , I fear , on my head . They are coming ! Oh , yes ! I can hear ,— I can hear on the sidewalk a tread . Shall I stay , and confess it was I ? Yes , that 's better than telling a lie ! ALFRED SELWYN . Illustration Illustration THE CAT AND THE STARLING . THE European starling is a sprightly and handsome bird , about eight inches long , of a black color with purple and greenish reflections , and spotted with buff . It may be taught to repeat a few words , and to whistle short tunes . A little boy in England , who had one as a pet , which he named Dicky , tells the following story about it :— “ I took it home with me , and got a cage for it . But Master Dicky was not satisfied with so little room , and got out , and took possession of the whole house . One morning I was awakened by his chirping , and , on looking around , I saw him on my pillow , to which he used to come every morning . “ We had at the same time a cat , with whom he soon became very good friends . They always drank milk out of the same saucer . One afternoon , a basin of milk being on the table , Master Dicky thought he would take a bath : so in he went , splashing the milk all over the table . “ Sometimes he would take it into his head to have a ride on the cat 's back , to which she had no objection . At night he would sleep with the cat and kitten ; and once when the servant came down in the morning , she said that she saw the cat with her paw around the bird , keeping him warm , though that seems almost too much to believe . ” R. B . Illustration THE EXPRESS PACKAGE . A PACKAGE came , With Gold-Locks ’ name Written in letters bold and free Upon the cover : She turned it over , And cried , “ Is it for me , for me ? ” ‘ Twas scarce a minute Before within it Her eyes had peeped with curious awe : There , sweet as a rose , And folded close In tissue , what do you think she saw ? Illustration A doll ? Ah , yes ! You would never guess A dolly could be so very sweet , Or have such grace , From the blooming face Down to the tips of her slippered feet . She smiled , and smiled , Like a real live child , And opened her eyes of bluest blue , As little Gold-Locks From out the box Lifted , and held her up to view . In ruffles and puffs Of gauzy stuffs , She looked like a fresh white flower , full-blown , And Gold-Locks ’ heart Gave a happy start , As she thought , “ She is all my own , my own ! ” MRS.

When cats run home and light is come , And dew is cold upon the ground , And the far-off stream is dumb , And the whirring sail goes round , And the whirring sail goes round . Alone and warming his fine wits , The white owl in the belfry sits . 2 .
