A TRAVESTY . BY MOSE SKINNER . CHAPTER FIRST . CROQUET . A croquet party has assembled in Mrs. TIMOTHY LADLE 'S front yard , located in one of the most romantic spots in that sylvan retreat , the State of Indiana . “ Who 's going to play , ” did you say ? Come with me , and I 'll introduce you . This austere female , with such inflexible rigidity of form , such harrowing cork-screw curls , and chronic expression as of smelling something disagreeable , is Mrs. LADLE , the hostess . A widow . Her husband , the late TIMOTHY , was a New York detective . Amassing a competency , he emigrated to Indiana , became a Bank Director and Sunday-School Superintendent , and died beloved by all . Produce your very best bow for Mrs. LADLE , and trot out your company talk , for she 's in the mother-in-law business , and thoroughly up to snuff . This old male party , with the remains of a luxuriant growth of very red hair , clinging fondly , like underbrush round a rock , to the sides of his head , with a seedy-looking patch far under the chin to match , whose limp dickey droops pensively as if seeking to crawl bodily into the embrace of the plaid gingham which encircles his neck , and in whose nose is embodied that rare vermilion tint which artists so love to dwell upon ;— this is the Hon . MICHAEL LADLE , brother of the late TIMOTHY , a Western Member of Congress , and a grass widower . This girl of the period , whose saucy black eyes bear down on you like a twenty-four gun frigate ; looking as it were through you , and counting the hairs on the back of your neck , is Miss BELINDA LADLE , daughter of the deceased TIMOTHY , and step-daughter to the hostess who was TIM 'S second matrimonial venture , you understand . This young woman mounts a lager-beer cask , and stops the buzz of conversation by bringing her mallet down with a smart rap upon the head of the nearest bald-headed gentleman . “ Attention , company , ” said she — “ Stand up straight , and look as well as you can .— Take — mallets . ” While the guests are boisterously laughing , with that rare appreciation of refined humor peculiar to the West , Mrs. LADLE , the proper , attempts an indignant remonstrance , but is interrupted by the Hon . MICHAEL . “ Oh , let the little gal have her tantrums , sister-in-law , ” said he . “ Mebbe you was young once , though nobody now living could swear to it . ” “ Come , ” interrupted BELINDA , “ we 've had gassin ’ enough . Choose your partners . Mildewed age , before infantile beauty . Mother-in-law , go in . ” The extremely respectable and highly dignified female last alluded to shook her fist at BELINDA on the sly , and said : “ I 'll take ANN BRUMMET . ” The lady who stepped forward at this summons was greeted with a wide stare , and every eye-glass was focussed . She was a remarkable-looking female . She was n't exactly handsome , but there was a sort of a something about her , you understand , that — ah — riveted the gaze of folks generally , you see , and a fellow — ah — caught himself looking the second time , as you may say — and ah — it was n't style either , for one shoulder was higher than the other , and her hair was done up in a bob , and she took awful long steps , and swung her arms as far as they would go each way ; and her collar looked as though she 'd slept in it , and she wore rubbers like a school-ma'am . And you could n't say ‘ twas regularity of features exactly , either , for her eyes were too limited in circumference , and her nose too numerous in diameter ; and her mouth monopolized too much latitude , and she had a hair-mole on one cheek , and faint dawnings of a moustache on her upper lip . But in spite of these trivial eccentricities , you felt when you looked at her , as I said before — ah — a sort of — as it were — a — By Jove , I can n't describe it . The general impression was that she was an heiress , and the comments were numerous . “ How graceful ! ” “ Look at that swan-like neck ! ” “ What a perfect form ! ” “ What a dove-like expression ! ” “ Do introduce me ! ” “ Who is she ? ” “ She 's a poor relation of Mrs. LADLE 'S . ” “ There , I thought so ! ” “ What an object ! ” “ Forcing herself into genteel society , too ! ” “ The audacity of these creatures is perfectly horrid . ” It was BELINDA 'S turn to choose next , and she pointed straight at the man she wanted , and said : “ JEFFRY MAULBOY . ” It was natural she should choose him , for he was greatly respected by all present , and the ladies especially regarded him as simply a hero ; for he was one of the Great Masters in the noble Art of Muscle . Let me explain . At the time of which I write , there had been a contest in the Universities of America between Brains and Muscle , and the latter had conquered . Brains were accounted a very good thing in their way , but what we want , sir , is Muscle . If a man can master his Greek , and his Latin , and his Theology , and his Law , and such frothy trifles between times , well and good , but he mus n't neglect his Muscle . And so base-ball clubs were organized , and the Long Heels challenged the Short Heels , and the leading journals published cards of defiance from the Knockers to the Hitters , together with labored editorials on the same . And boat-races and sculling matches were set on foot , and once a year the students repaired with their friends to a city afflicted with a lake , where , pending the contest , they organized a Reign of Terror , during which the harmless inhabitants locked themselves in their houses and clasped their offspring to their bosoms , or gazed terror-stricken from an attic-window upon the classical marauders below , as they indulged in a post-mortem examination of a private dwelling , or the rare pleasantry of roasting a policeman . But dared complain , for public excitement waxed high on the subject of Muscle . And when the day arrived which was to decide the momentous question , the banks of the lake were decked with the beauty and culture of the land , and fair hands “ staked their odds , ” and fair lips became familiar with “ home-stretches , ” “ spurts , ” and “ fouls . ” A body of students crossed the ocean to win a boat-race , and the public Press told us in very large capitals what they ate and drank , and the exact condition of a boil belonging to one of the party . But the heart of the nation beat high with hope , until the appalling intelligence was flashed across the wires that they were defeated . It was a cruel blow . Strong men looked at one another in mute agony , or spoke as if there was a corpse in the next room . The Press sent up a wail that resounded through the land . An eminent divine pronounced it a “ National misfortune , ” and the pictorials containing wood-cuts of the lamented heroes were put away , as we put away the playthings of a child that has died . No wonder that Mr. JEFFRY MAULBOY was looked up to and courted , for he had a medal bestowed upon him as a Champion Paddler , and had lost a bet of fifty dollars on the “ Great International Contest . ” But his towering ambition remained unsated . He realized that he lived in a progressive age , and his superior talents enabled him to take a stand far ahead of his fellows . By diligent application to his noble profession , he was now a member of that exalted Institution , “ The Prize Ring of America , ” and the letters P. R. U. S. A . were elegantly imprinted with blue ink upon his right arm . There were two persons present , however , who did n't regard JEFFRY MAULBOY as a little god . One was the Hon . MICHAEL LADLE ; the other was ANN BRUMMET . She was putting her tongue out , and making faces at him from behind an apple-tree . A lady who saw her said it improved her appearance . When BELINDA chose JEFFRY , he very deliberately took a chew of tobacco , and said he would n't play . “ This is the sickest croquet party I ever saw , ” said BELINDA . “ All backing out . Spos'en I take you then , you dear old buffer , ” she added , addressing the Hon . MICHAEL . “ I may be an old buffer , ” said the Hon . Member from the West , but I am young enough for anything here . As STOWE BYRON says : “ Oh , days of my childhood 's hours , I 'm a gazin ’ on ye yit . ” He was interrupted by JEFFRY MAULBOY . “ You say you are young enough for anything here , ” said he ; “ suppose you and I try a little mill out back of the house . ” “ Young man , ” replied the Hon . MICHAEL , “ if there 's one mistake in life that your parents grieve over , it is probably the mistake of your birth . If you do n't have any serious drawbacks , and are careful of your health , you will make a first-class DEAD BEAT . When a man insults me , sir , I lay him out , without depending in the smallest degree upon an undertaker , but as for standing up in front of a man who mashes noses by contract , and chaws off ears as a matter of genteel business , why it ai n't my cut . ” JEFFRY MAULBOY took another chew of tobacco . “ You can go on , ” he said . “ I wo n't hurt you . You 're too small potatoes for me . ” While this gentle raillery was in progress , BELINDA felt somebody tugging at her dress . She looked down , and saw Mr. ARCHIBALD BLINKSOP , a sailor-looking chap who smelt of tar , and well he might , for he had ploughed the tempestuous deep for upwards of six months , as a common sailor on the Erie Canal . “ Shiver my starboard binnacle amidships , ” said he , “ why do n't you choose me ? ” She squeezed his hand and winked at him . “ I will choose you , dear , ” said she . “ Do n't blush so . ” The game has commenced . JEFFRY MAULBOY , standing aloof , is just taking a fresh chew , when a hand is laid on his shoulder . The hand is that of ANN BRUMMET , the poor relation , and the voice that breaks on his ear is also the property of that extraordinary woman . “ JEFF , ” said she cautiously , “ meet me in just half an hour , out back of the house . You know the place . Where the woodbine has twined so much . I 've got something very particular to tell you . ” And she pinched his arm slyly . The game progresses . The Hon . MICHAEL LADLE and ARCHIBALD BLINKSOP are conversing together . “ That MAULBOY is a jackass , ” said the former . “ Is he a friend of your'n ? ” “ Well , not exactly , ” returned ARCHIBALD . “ You see , it 's just like this , ” he continued , hitching up his pants behind , and rolling , the same as sailors do on the stage . “ About two months ago JEFF made a voyage with me . One night we were bowling along the canal under a very stiff breeze . The compass stood north-east and a half , the thermometer was chafing fearfully , and the jib-boom , only two-thirds reefed was lashing furiously against the poop-deck . Suddenly , that terrible cry , ‘ A man overboard ! ’ I lost no time . I bore down on the taffrail threw the cook overboard , and soon had the satisfaction of seeing our noble craft lay over abaft the wind . Then , quick as thought , I belayed the windlass and lowered a gaff . It struck something soft . I heard JEFF cry : ‘ Do n't hit my head again . ’ I was careful . The gaff slid along his back , and finally settled firmly into the seat of his trousers . He was hoisted aboard . The first thing he did was to see if his tobacco was safe . Then he offered me a chew and said : ‘ Bless you , bless you ; you have saved my life , and owe me a debt of gratitude forever . ’ And I ‘ spose I do , ” added ARCHIBALD . “ It 's the way of the world . ” “ Well , ” said the Hon . MICHAEL , “ I do n't envy you . I should n't want to owe him a debt of any kind . ” “ Why ? ” queried BLINKSOP . “ Because , sooner or later , you 'll have to pay it , double over , ” was the reply .

Then JUPITER caught him in his umbrella as he was falling , and transformed him to the bird known as the “ Wax wing . ” G. F . TRAIN . Down with the Uhlans ! Up with the black flag !

PUNCHINELLO TO “ THE SUN . ” DEAR SUNNY :— In our issue dated November 19th , we took occasion to congratulate you upon the sparkle added to your “ Sunbeams ” by the judicious reproduction of our crisp and crystalline little poem “ SALLY SALTER . ” We have no doubt that your languid circulation was partly restored by the timely aid thus unconsciously afforded you by PUNCHINELLO . If any SALTER could save your bacon for you , surely “ SALLY ” was the one to do it ; only you should n't have tried to pass her off as one of your own SALLIES . The jackdaw decked out in peacock 's feathers was a bird truly absurd , though not a whit more so than a Solar Dodo like yourself with a PUNCHINELLO plume for a tail . Now , in your number for November 9th , we find a remarkably pretty “ Autumn Song . ” It was pointed out to us , triumphantly , by a man who carries The Sun in his pocket , and who wanted to know why PUNCHINELLO never gave his readers anything like that ? In reply , we courteously referred him to PUNCHINELLO of October 22d , in which that identical “ Autumn Song ” made its “ first appearance upon any stage . ” And so there you go , dear DODO SUNNY , with another PUNCHINELLO feather in your pensive tail . Keep decking yourself with the feathers , dear SUNNY . They become you well ; and when you 've got a bushel or so of ‘ em , we 'll dispose of you to BARNUM as the original Anti-Promethean Dodo that stole fire from PUNCHINELLO to light up The Sun . PUNCHINELLO . THAT BLONDE BUSINESS . Little Nell . “ O MA , WHAT PRETTY BOOTS THOSE LADIES HAVE ! ” Mamma . “ AND SUCH NICE DRESSES , TOO . ” Little Nell . “ DRESSES , MA ? I DON'T SEE ANY DRESSES — I ONLY SEE THEIR BOOTS ! ” ] OUR PORTFOLIO . A Bilious Review of the French Situation .— Hot Fat for Idiots .— Trochu Encounters a Conundrum . PARIS , SEVENTH WEEK OF THE REPUBLIC , 1870 . DEAR PUNCHINELLO :— If America has any “ bowels of compassion ” it is fit that they should yearn now . This frothy and frenzied Republic is at that ebb where national “ extreme unction ” must be administered speedily , else the sufferer will pass away from the theatre of sublunary things without the benefit of clergy . I feel as if I would like to get the whole nation on a toasting-fork before a slow fire , and roast it into a realizing sense of what the devil is doing for it . To see BISMARCK feeding on shrimps with anchovy sauce , and drinking champagne , while TROCHU and JULES FAVRE fight domestic treason within the walls , and the Prussians without , upon stomachs that feebly digest Parisian “ hard tack ” and gritty vin ordinaire , is enough to make the spirit of liberty lay over the mourner 's bench and perpetrate a perfect Niagara of tears . When FLOURENS bagged the whole government at the Hotel de Ville the other day , my feelings got the better of me , and I went for him . “ Idiotic Frenchmen ! ” I exclaimed , in a voice that must have sounded like an echo working its way through a thick upper crust of doughy apple-dumplings ; “ Idiotic Frenchmen , do you know what you are doing ? Have you the feelings of a man , or of a mad dog ? Which is it that it is , that you should be worrying the life out of this croupy infant of liberty , as is hardly able to waggle its head , barring all hope that it will ever get upon its pins and take its ‘ constitutional ’ like other mortals in distress ? Where is the ghost of MIRABEAU , that it does not come upon you all of a sudden , to confiscate the very marrow in your bones and set up a candle factory in spite of the tax on tallow ? Where is LAFAYETTE ? Where is REGINALD DE LYLE ? Where is ROBESPIERRE and GEORGE FRANCIS TRAIN ? Where is the DUKE DE MONTEBELLO , or the Count of MONTE CHRISTO , that they do n't hang round you like aggravated wasps , and sting you into that appreciation of the fitness of things whereby some razor may be slipped across your wizzen , and Paris follow your corse to the P é re la Chaise with joy and gladness ? Why , in the name of all the torments — ” I stopped for want of breath , in time to see that the crowd paid no attention , and that , to say the least of it , I had been making an ass of myself . Not that there was no wisdom in my words , but these Frenchmen are the most “ dog gorned ” insensible people to right up and down , plain , everyday gospel truth that Providence ever permitted to play checkers with Destiny . I had no hankering for a closer interview with FLOURENS . He and I could never had got at a basis peace . There is no harmony in the method of our mental “ jointings . ” I would have given “ stamps ” to have got his head under a quiet village pump , but I would n't have undertaken to reason with him for all the gold of the Credit Mobilier . There is another creamy idiot , trying his “ level best ” to smash things here . Look at him ! JULES VALLES ! a patriot by name and a Pat-rioter by nature , with enough hair on his head to stuff a gabion , and not sense enough beneath it to accommodate a well-informed parrot . These fellows call FAVRE a “ milk-sop , ” and the trouble of it is that FAYRE occasionally gives them reason for doing so . Strolling through the Passage des Princes this morning , I saw TROCHU and accosted him . “ General , ” I said , probably with some trifling vindictiveness in my heart , “ is n't there a grease vat in Paris sufficiently large to boil down Monsieur FLOURENS and his friends ? ” He might have thought that I was a little overheated , or that some of the Grand Cafe “ tangle-foot ” had got into my head ; but his looks undeniably indicated that he did not regard this as an unusually cool proposal . He simply said , “ Oh my ! ” in tolerably good English , and then I continued : “ You mistake me , General . I was not born in New Zealand . There is nothing of the cannibal about me , and I trust the supply of provisions in Paris wo n't compel us to eat each other just yet ; but if there is no satisfaction for the stomach in putting a tun or two of boiling fat around GUSTAVE FLOURENS , can you think of anything better calculated to produce serenity in the public mind ? ” He did n't answer me then . It could n't be expected , perhaps ; but I am still of the impression that this conundrum is gradually working towards a solution in the brain of the Commander-in-Chief . I hope it do n't lay heavily there ; I would n't do anything to distress him . If GOLDWIN SMITH were expounding political economy to him in one ear , and HORACE GREELEY talking agriculture in the other , the poor man could n't be more bothered than he is . No , no ; far be it from me to add one harrowing burden to his already heavy load ; but when a man sees the porter-house steak of Liberty a burning up on the grid-iron of war , why should n't he put forth his “ flipper ” and save it if he can ? And there 's another conundrum : but it 's for PUNCHINELLO and his hemisphere of adorers . DICK TINTO . A GOOD BAR-GAIN SUGGESTED . The suggestion for purifying the New York Bar by classifying its tenders is a good one and should be acted upon . As it is now , the justice there dispensed is so mixed and doctored that it satisfies only the vitiated taste of the roughs . The proceedings in the McFARLAND and JACKSON case show that swagger , not study — bullying , not brains , are in a fair way to become the important qualifications of a counsel . The lawyers should organize in their own defence and classify themselves . Mr. PUNCHINELLO suggests the following method as the simplest and probably the most effective in its application to matters of legal digestion . Let there be two classes made , the one to embrace the well-bred , and the other the GRAHAM bred practitioners . THE SPORT AT WASHINGTON .— Fighting COX . THE PLAYS AND SHOWS “ O What a wretched smell of orange-peel and sawdust ! ” says MARGARET to me , as we enter the gateway of the CIRCUS . Wretched ! Why of all perfumes , next to that of the clover and the new-mown hay , it is the most delicious . For it brings back to us the days of our innocent childhood , when we stole unlawful pennies to pay for admission to the charmed circle of equestrian delights , and in youthful purity of soul , and general dirtiness of face and hands , listened to the ingenious witticisms of the clown , while we cracked the peaceful peanut , and shared the social gingerbread . Childlike innocence is a phrase that must originally have been applied exclusively to girls . Obviously it is sheer nonsense as applied to boys . Who ever saw an innocent boy , especially in a place of amusement ? Are they not , one and all , given to untimely hunger , and addicted to undesirable methods of assuaging its pangs ? Are they not prone to perpetual colds in the head , accompanied by loud and labored breathing , and rarely mitigated by the judicious use of pocket-handkerchiefs ? Do they not indulge in a vicious and wholly unpardonable wealth of muddy boots , wherewith to trample upon their unoffending neighbors ? Are they not as prone to bad language as the Tribune , and as noisy and noisome as the Sun itself ? In short , are they not always and altogether the most oppressive nuisance that can annoy the peaceful pleasure-seeker ? Echo answers that there is n't the smallest possible doubt of it . Why , then , do we foolishly speak of innocent boyhood ? Girls , on the other hand , may be innocent ,— that is to say , when they are extremely young . Of course they outgrow it when they arrive at years of flirtation ; but up to — say — their tenth or eleventh year , they rarely go in for muddy boots and inappropriate peanuts ,— at least not to the same extent as boys . The average little girl is , moreover , seldom found at the CIRCUS . She prefers WALLACK 'S , or BOOTH 'S theatre ,— whereas your usual boy despises the legitimate drama , and prefers to have his dissipations served up with a great deal of horse and plentifully spiced with the presence of the cheerful clown . For my part , I frankly confess that I do not like boys , and heartily approve of the noble sentiment expressed the other day by my landlady , who , on reading that the Parisians had destroyed the Bois de Boulogne , remarked that , “ Even if the French could n't spell ‘ boys ’ properly , she was glad to see that they knew how to treat them . ” Pardon the errors of her pronunciation . She learned French at a young ladies ’ seminary . But I digress . It is a reprehensible habit . It is much better , as a rule , to die game than it is to digress , though on the present occasion there is no reason why I should do either . By the way , if a man has to choose between having either his leg or his arm amputated , which ought he to choose ? Obviously he should choose ether ,— that being much safer than chloroform . As I was saying , the CIRCUS always has a strong flavor of orange peel . Will some one explain why orange-peel has such a close affinity for horses and sawdust ? I have attempted to account for it by an elaborate stretching of the theory of chemical affinities . People crack peanuts at the CIRCUS , because the cracking of peanuts in its prosaic dreariness is in harmony with the cracking of jokes by the dreary clown . The clown himself is always hoarse , obviously because of his intimate association with the feats of horsemanship . Here are two cases in which the theory of affinities clearly applies . Now , can we not go further , and find some connection between the ring of the Circus and the peel of the orange ? Or again , may not the presence of unwholesome animals in the arena have something to do with the presence of orange-rind in the seats ? The latter is clearly a rind-pest of the very worst variety . At this rate we shall never get inside the Circus building . So say MARGARET ; and I therefore cease my philosophical remarks , which have so strongly impressed the doorkeeper that he has finally beckoned to a policeman to come and listen to them . Up the steep stairs we hasten , and are put into a reserved pen , where we watch the glory of motley and the glitter of spangles in the ring below . A terrific feat of horsemanship is in progress . A daring rider , mounted on a broad platform , which is borne on the back of a placid horse , is carried on a slow canter around the ring . He evidently impersonates a member of the horse marines , for he executes elaborate imitations of pulling ropes , reefing and furling sails . Probably the horse marines reef topsails on horseback . In the absence of opposing testimony we accept his theory , and are greatly pleased to find that the equestrian sailor finally escapes being wrecked on the lower row of benches , and so meeting a watery grave among the sawdust , while his horse slowly founders beneath him . I remark to MARGARET , while this daring act of marine horsemanship in progress , that “ I hope the horse wo n't founder ” — meaning to pun on the latter word . But I am overheard by a horsey person in the neighborhood , who replies , “ That horse hai n't got a symptom of foundering . LENT keeps his horses in too good condition for that . ” And I to him , in a light and jocose manner — “ LENT keeps them so well fed that they never keep Lent themselves , I suppose . ” But the horsey person does not see my joke ,— thus proving that he shares a dulness of perception that I have too often noticed , even among my friends . So I mercifully give him one more chance and say : “ I suppose Mr . LENT keeps all the fast horses , so that they never have to keep fast themselves . ” But he gruffly answers , “ You think yourself smart , do n't you ? You ai n't , though , and you 'd better keep yourself mighty quiet . ” I agree with him in the latter opinion , and relapse into a dignified silence . Presently the “ Antipodal Brothers ” begin their fraternal gymnastics . I again feel the spirit of speculation strong within me , and say to MARGARET , “ Why are gymnasts always born in couples ? Why could n't the Antipodal Cousins , or the Antipodal Relations by Marriage , break their necks together with as much effect as though they were brothers ? Does the fraternal supply of brotherly gymnastics exist in consequence of a presumed demand for the article by the public ? If so , why does the public make such demand ? ” And she answers , “ It is a mystery . Seek not to penetrate it . That way madness lies . ” Here a conundrum obtrudes itself upon me , and I ask , “ Suppose Gen. TERRY had a daughter , why would she necessarily be a delightful puzzle ? Obviously because she would be a Miss TERRY . ” But the horsey person turns round and says , “ If you want a head put on you , just keep on talking ; so that folks can n't hear the brothers turn a somersault . You 'll be accommodated ; do you understand ? ” I accept his general hint , and watch the somersaulting pair . What an editor the elder brother would make ! He could turn as sudden and perfect a somersault as did Mr. DANA , when he transformed the Sun in a single night from a decent daily to what it now is . Or what a politician the younger brother might become , were he to exhibit in the arena of public life the agility in turning flip-flaps , and reversing himself by unexpectedly standing on his head , which he displays in the CIRCUS ring . Then the famous equestrienne — or rideress , as WEBSTER would probably call her — careers around the circle on her thoroughbred Alaskian steed : she is evidently a great favorite , and the small boy behind me exclaims , with an ecstatic kick at the back of my neck : “ Is n't this bully ? ” I venture to correct him by remarking : “ My son , you should say ‘ horsey . ’ You would thereby avoid confounding the noble animals before you with the no less useful , but undeniably less attractive — in an aesthetic point of view — animals which belong to the bovine race . ” He is evidently overcome by my flow of language , and he asks , with a feeble show of independence : “ You ai n't hungry , are you ? ” I say to myself : “ Kind-hearted little fellow . He is grateful for my reproof , and proposes to reward me with peanuts . ” So I kindly reply : “ No , my child , I am not hungry ; why do you ask ? ” “ Because , ” answers the young villain , “ I thought you could n't be , after having histed in a whole big dictionary . ” I turn abruptly to MARGARET and say : “ Come , my dear ” — ( she is my maiden aunt , and I use the language of affection and respect to her ) — “ let us go . This thing is only fit for children . We 'll go over to WALLACK 'S and see an old comedy . ” She rises reluctantly ; but as we emerge into Fourteenth street , she says : “ The CIRCUS is one of the nicest places in town , and I like it a million times better than I do your stupid old comedies . ” The curious circumstance in connection with this remark is , that MARGARET is nearly always right . MATADOR . SARSFIELD YOUNG 'S PANORAMA . DEAR PUNCHINELLO :— Some months ago , a friend of mine requested me to write him up descriptions for a set of panoramic views , which he had purchased at a low figure at auction , and which he proposed to exhibit through the country . The “ Professor ” who was engaged to travel with him , it seems , was highly gifted so far as good clothes , a fine head of hair , and a sweet expression , were concerned . He could also play rudimentary music upon the flute . But he could n't handle his mother tongue glibly enough to accompany the scenes in first class showman style . Having the subjects given me , but without seeing a foot of the canvas , I knocked off a few remarks , which I aimed to render as appropriate as circumstances , and no regard whatever for the truth , would permit . The “ Professor ” was to commit them to memory , with the usual gestures , as he flourished his pointing-stick ; he was to twirl his moustache , manoeuvre his pocket handkerchief , and occasionally resort to a glass of water ,— and I am told he recites with great abandon . Some of PUNCHINELLO 'S readers may not enjoy the privilege of seeing the “ Panoramic Cosmos . ” For their special benefit I am allowed to append a portion of the narration . They will observe that the back towns are indeed fortunate to obtain at a moderate price so rare an intellectual treat . Yours , SARSFIELD YOUNG . PART I . LADIES AND GENTLEMEN :— We are proud to have the honor of appearing before you with our series of unrivalled paintings . Inferior exhibitions boast of the extent of their canvas : ours is literally endless . Like Mr. BROOKS ’ TENNYSON ( I beg pardon ,— Mr. TENNYSON 'S BROOK ) , it “ runs on forever . ” It embraces every variety of landscape , waterscape , and , in the crowded halls of our large cities , a new patent fire-escape . Everywhere we have met with unparalleled success . We have appeared before the crowned heads of Europe , and the woolly heads of Charleston and Savannah ,— the verdict of praise is unanimous . Purchasing our oil and varnish at wholesale prices , we defy competition . While we have given orders to our artists to furnish the most brilliant colors and gorgeous imagination that the market affords , there is nothing here ( except , perhaps , myself ) to offend the most fastidious . Our aim is high , but combined with a price that is unquestionably low ; we strive to elevate and instruct the people , at twenty-five cents a head ( or packages of five tickets for one dollar ) , and inspire a love for the pure and beautiful in art , with a liberal discount to Sunday and day schools . As the audience sit spell-bound ( no extra charge for reserved seats ) before one grand conception of the artist 's pencil ,— lost in admiration — another glides noiselessly into view ; the eye is gratified , the brain is refreshed , the digestion stimulated , and we all breathe easier . This alone is worth double the price of admission . But not to detain you longer on the threshold , I will ring up the curtain , and travel with you in this varied journey . THE GIANTS ’ CAUSEWAY . This stupendous structure is agreeably located on the coast of Ireland , where the waves are ever beating , and the stormy winds do blow . These pillars , grottoes , and colonnades strike the beholder with awe . They have resulted from some grand convulsion of Nature ; rocked in the cradle of the deep , as things seem to be here . It is not yet decided whether they belong to the pre-Raphaelite or the pre-Adamite period . As the spectator gazes spell-bound on this scene of grandeur , he almost fancies that he hears the surges beating heavily at the base of these grim rocks . ( This is effected by costly machinery , concealed behind the canvas .) These columns have probably been standing here for centuries . At least that is my opinion . I propose it to this scientific audience with great humility . By this I mean that the great HUGH MILLER thinks as I do . He must be a bold man to contradict such authority . This , however , is a boulder ! JUAN FERNANDEZ , An island in the Pacific . It is called an island , as it is entirely surrounded by water . It is famous as the residence of ROBINSON CRUSOE , who , to avoid taxation in his native land , lived here in great retirement . He had a faithful servant , FRIDAY , whom he enjoyed as much as one of these boys here does Saturday afternoon . There is quite a local look to this view , which renders it valuable to the enthusiastic student of geography . Ships sometimes stop here . Our artist 's ship stopped fifteen minutes , thus giving him ample time for this spirited and life-like representation . “ DE TEA FABULA NARRATUR . ” The women have embarked in the tea business . Tea at net prices is to be one of the chief tenets of the woman 's rights party . The middle men now engaged in the business are all to be abolished . All the women lecturers are to become tea-totallers , and go before their audiences laden with packages for sale , in lots to suit , for cash . Intimations of all this we gather from the recent news from Japan , where the agent of the Woman 's Tea Company , who has undertaken this reformation , has arrived , and been interviewed , on her way to secure the stock . But really , if the women do manage to give us our tea at a reasonable rate , we will buy it gladly , even though , perhaps , we should be forced to attend the lectures in order to obtain it . It is an ill wind which blows nobody good , even though the tempest originates in a tea-pot . The Spanish Question Settled . AUNT BATHSHEBA 'S mind is very chaotic as regards the throne of Spain . She heard them talking about D'AOSTA for the situation , and says :— “ A Oyster sit upon the Spanish throne , my dear !— ay , ay — it just serves the Spanish right . They was always in a Stew , and is the most Shellfishest of people as crawls the earth ! ” Anomalous . A despatch announces that the Pope is about leaving Rome . As nothing is said with regard to his Holiness 's particular destination , however , it seems as though he were about going to Roam . From Our Special Cockney . If , as the Tribune says , this is an “ off year ” with the Republicans , should n't they be satisfied with an ‘ OFFMAN for Governor ? Interesting to the Public .

The reader is particularly requested to bear in mind that SPIFFKINS 'S paper was a daily , not a nightly one . MR. SPIFFKINS had never written a line which , dying , he would wish to blot . In fact his “ copy ” was always clean , and he used to say , since it was so easy to write a line over again , where was the use in blotting it ! The specific department that Mr. SPIFFKINS attended to was “ interviewing . ” Mr. SPIFFKINS chose this department on account of having been born a gentleman , and of having always moved in the very best society . Interviewing brought him into contact with all sorts of distinguished people , with whom he immediately made himself at home . On one occasion he made himself so completely at home that the gentleman whom he was visiting considerately pointed out the mistake , and then SPIFFKINS suddenly remembered the distinction . Mr. SPIFFKINS was a man of great delicacy of feeling and keen sense of honor . One day a man cut his throat from ear to ear because his boarding-house-keeper would put ham into the hash . The brother of the man called upon SPIFFKINS and requested him as a favor to keep the thing out of his newspaper , as all the other journals had promised to do so . SPIFFKINS gave the required promise , and the next day SPIFFKINS 'S paper was the only one that had mention of the suicide . But then SPIFFKINS had no intention of hurting the suicide 's family 's feelings . Not by any means . His only aim was to beat the other newspapers and to serve his employers . SPIFFKINS wrote pure English , his style — like that of other reporters — being noticeable for its elegance and perspicuity . Thus , whenever SPIFFKINS had occasion to use the word “ memories , ” he invariably said “ memories of the past , ” and by this means made it plain that he meant no reference whatever to the memories of the future . The force , originality , and beauty of his epithets were remarkable . In his local reports suicides were always “ determined ” suicides , and their acts were always “ rash ” acts . Among purists in the use of words the employment of these adjectives has always been considered a delightful and legitimate mode of discriminating between people who kill themselves precipitately and those who use a considerable amount of caution , and ( so to speak ) apply strychnine with one hand and the stomach-pump with the other . SPIFFKINS used to report fires , murders , and police doings generally in a quiet and genteel manner , and by the Superintendent of Police he was as much beloved for the goodness of his heart as he was by the city editor for the goodness of his grammar . Once upon a time SPIFFKINS had the opportunity of trying his hand at dramatic criticism , and adopted a startlingly new system , which consisted simply in telling the truth . The consequence was that his newspaper obtained a great reputation for high moral tone , and lost all its theatrical advertisements . Even when SPIFFKINS wrote an original American comedy of “ contemporaneous human interest ” ( and which had had a previous run in Paris of five thousand nights ) , and that comedy was brilliantly rejected by a manager , SPIFFKINS never went back on his system of telling the truth . Weaker critics would have let up on that manager lest it should be thought that they abused him because he refused their plays . But not so with SPIFFKINS . His moral courage was too heroic to resort to so mean a subterfuge as that , and to this day that manager believes that the reason SPIFFKINS abused him is because he refused his play ! Sometimes SPIFFKINS threw a little light on subjects that were generally misunderstood . For instance , he said that NILSSON was a “ charming mezzo-soprano , ” and declared that “ RIP VAN WINKLE ” was a more delightful translation from the French than had been seen for many a day . Occasionally SPIFFKINS eked out his salary by writing letters to the provincial press . In this respect he was invaluable , because his letters contained , about things in New York , information which never appeared in the New York papers ; so that when a Philadelphia family takes the newspaper which SPIFFKINS corresponds with , that family is fully posted upon everything which might just as well have happened here as not . SPIFFKINS is too real a gentleman at heart to be much of one in appearance . If his boots and manners are equally unpolished , I know that his heart is in the right place — just where his pocket-book is ; and if his linen is dirty and his face unshorn , I feel certain that his soul is clad in immaculate spiritual lawn , and that his better nature is shaved close .

WARD BEECHER . The “ Lait Gustice 's ” Advice to the Brooklyn Divine . SKEENSBORO , Nye onto Varmont . MY KLERGICAL FRIEND — Feelin it my duty to encourage a man when he strikes the rite gait , I seize the goose-quil to set down and scratch off a letter to you . I 've heard you preach , and , to do the square thing , I am constrained to say you 've got talents into you , on which to bild a first-class Dominy . My advice is , to let your talents sintilate ; do n't undertake to hide ‘ em under a bushel of peanuts . Let ‘ em blaze , friend B .— let ‘ em blaze . I dident notiss any bill-boards hangin about your mouth , savin as how “ Rooms was to let in your sky-lofts ; ” but contrary wise , it 's my opinion there haint a tenement house in New York which is packed fuller of people than your figger-head is of slap-up idees . You haint afeard to stand out baldly and face the sea of upturned red maskaline noses , or hily-frizzled , gorgeously-got-up femilines , and skatter Fiseology rite and left , not carin a pickaune who 's hit or who haint . A man who scores up as you do , is bound to win in the long run , if he only keeps his eyes about him , and do n't undertake to go it blind . Yoove got a futer ahead of you bigger'n a meetin-house . Keep ploddin along in the evening tender of your way , and I predict you'l ocupy a front rank among the clergy . I , the lait Gustise , which has served his country for 4 yeer as Gustise of the Peece , tells you so ; and havin asshiated with a good many big guns in my day , my profetic vision is as clear as Rine wine . You haint much like a preacher I once useter sleep under . We called him OLD CLOROFORM . His sermons were dredful soothin to take . Old Mother WINSLOW couldent play 2nd fiddle to his preachin , and her sirop is better'n a club to put children to sleep . Why , friend BEECHER , that ere minnister was warranted to talk a squallin young one to sleep in 30 seconds . When our Doctors had a leg to saw off , they always sent for Dominy CLOROFORM to put the patient to sleep . He dident preach “ Rest for the weary ” without practisin what he preached , by makin his weary congregation rest like kittens . But the old man has been scooped in , and our drug store has gone up on cloroform . His last words were :— “ Sweet sleepers , I go . I'le drug no more . ” And beneath the mirtle , the Canada thistle , and the gooseberry-bush he rests , with the follerin epitaff on his tombstun :— Hee 's gone to rest , do n't wake him up , His labors heer are ore ; He useter preach fokes fast to sleep , Who entered his church-door . Minnisters , in gettin hold of the public heart , resort to different ways . Some of ‘ em make love to the pretty little lambs of their flox of the femail persuasion . Others indulge freely in gin and milk , and get boozy , while agin some others histe in mug after mug of lager beer , and then lay in with some Bohemian to rite ‘ em up . This gives ‘ em a popularity which $ 500 worth of paid-for advertisements wouldent bring ‘ em . And their church stock goes up to 200 per cent . above par . Big crowds rush to hear the guzzlin divine extort . And , sir ! before you know it , that preacher is richer'n mud , and just as likely as not , owns stock in a race-course or a lager-bier brewery . Thus , as SHAKSPEER says :— “ Their is a course somewhere which shapes Our latter ends , ruff hue ‘ em As we will . The only truble is to Find that course — and freeze to it . ” But , Master B ., do n't imitate any of them ere stiles . You soot me as you are . You hai n't one of them chaps , who believes that if a man wants to be good , he must draw down his face , and look as if he had been fetched up on chow-chow and cider vinegar . Long faces do n't make good fokes , which reminds me that fine feathers do n't allers make fine birds , especcially if it 's a broiled chicken full of fine pin feathers . I notiss that in your sermons you handle polerticians and bizziness men without gloves . Between you and I , some of them store keepers and eatin house chaps on Broadway , N. Y ., go on the principle — give as little as they can , for as much as they can squeeze out of their customers . Up to DELMONICO 'S you can buy an apple dumplin for $ 3. 00 , and 25 cents extra for a tooth-pick , while at some other places it costs a man 1 / 2 a dollar to poke his head into a store door . I went into an ice cream saloon on B'way last time I was in N. Y . They asked me 50 cents for a plate of ice cream . When I was leavin , the proprieter accused me of stealin his dish . I indignantly scorned his vile insineration . Next mornin , I was pickin out a holler tooth , when sumthing hard struck my tooth-pick . I pulled out my jack-nife , and dug it out . To my cerprise , the missin dish came forth , which had been wedged into the cavity beneath a 75 cent piece of pie . I notiss you draw big houses . Outsiders grumble some , because they can n't go into your church and take the best seats , and crowd out regular pew-holders . Let em grumble . I allers found out that when a man is gettin up in the world , that , like carrion crows hoverin over a sick animal , grumblers fly about him , lickin their chops and watchin a good opportunity to scratch him ragged . When you git off joaks and set your congregation to laffin , do n't it make you feel scrumpshus ? As a Klergical humorist , there is stamps in you . But Ive writ more'n I expected when I sot down . It would delite me and Mrs. GREEN to have you and your good woman pay us a visit . If you'l come , drop us a line , and we'l open the front parler and invite in a few first families to give you a lively time . I'l have a coat of white-wash put onto the bed-room walls . White-wash makes a sleepin-room smell sweet . Besides it makes bugs dust in a hurry . My old woman is a sweet white-washer . I'de bet odds , that MARIAR can get over more territory , with a white-wash brush , than the smartest committee of congresses ever appinted to cover up some dark transaction .

The Extreme or Fashion . It is announced by journals devoted to fashion , that trains are to be worn even longer during the coming winter than they have yet been .

FASHIONABLE INTELLIGENCE . “ AT THE LAST Bal Masqu é ON THE AVENUE . A DISTINGUISHED SOUTHERN GENTLEMAN CREATED MUCH AMUSEMENT COSTUMED AS ‘ RECONSTRUCTION . ’ ” ] MR. BROWN HAS BEEN RECOMMENDED BY A FRIEND TO HAVE A LITTLE GLYCERINE DROPPED INTO HIS EAR FOR DEAFNESS . BY MISTAKE HE PURCHASES NITRO-GLYCERINE . RESULT . POEMS OF THE CRADLE . CANTO XII . Ride a cock horse to Banbury Cross , To see an old woman ride on a white horse . Rings on her fingers and bells on her toes , She shall have music wherever she goes . The above verse commemorates an epoch in the Poet 's lifetime . He went to the Circus . A noteworthy event , when it is considered how few Circuses there were in those days , and how seldom those few came near enough to disturb the calm of an out-of-the-way country village . Such a thing had never occurred before in his lifetime , nor within the memory of the oldest inhabitant . All were therefore properly impressed with the importance of the occurrence , and none more so than the excitable , impressible , enthusiastic Poet . For days before the one appointed to make the journey to the Market Town , he was in a great state of excitement and hilarious pleasure , and with difficulty controlled his inclinations to laugh , dance , and sing , and otherwise gayly disport himself . The exuberance of his spirits caused no little alarm to his family , who feared he was going mad with delight , and endeavored in every possible way to quiet down the dangerous symptoms . “ In vain did his mother command him to stop : He only laughed louder and higher did hop ; ” till at last , fearing the torrent could never be stemmed , she thought to direct it in a less dangerous channel . So , putting on her most insinuating expression she asked , “ Why do n't you write a piece about the Circus ? It might be real nice . Tell all about the beautiful young lady on horseback , and the music , and the ride over to Banbury , and everything you can think about . Come now , that 's a good boy ; go and do that for your mother . ” The deceived youth stared in amazement at the request . Such a thing had never been heard before under that humble roof-tree . His own mother actually telling him to write some poetry . Incredible ! Instead of laughing , and snubbing him as she usually did , positively telling him to do the very thing she had so often forbidden ,— the very thing he had always been obliged to do under so many discouragements . The thought took away his breath . That his talent was at length recognized by his family was a matter of rejoicing , and springing up with a cheerful cry , “ I 'll do it , ” he bounded up the back-kitchen stairs , and was soon lost to sight amid the cobwebs of time . The provident old lady , with a knowing look and sagacious shake of the head , said , “ He 's safe for awhile , thank Heaven ; now let us have peace . ” Let us follow the poet up-stairs and peep into that attic chamber . The sanctum sanctorum of the writer . The visiting-place of the Muses . The stable of Pegasus . There , in one corner , is a little cot bed , with a single pillow , showing at once a privileged member of the family ; near its head an ancient wash-stand and a tin wash-basin , and by its side a pail of water , with a tin dipper reposing quietly on its surface . Nothing unnecessary , everything useful . By the window stands a square pine table , spotted and streaked with ink , to match the floor , which resembles in a homely way MARK TWAIN 'S map of Paris on an enlarged scale . Before that table , his head resting on his hands , his eyes glaring on the paper , sits the immortal Bard whose lightest words were to be remembered long after his name was forgotten . The first in order of events in the journey to the Market Town . The arrangements have all been made . He and TOM are to ride the horse , while his mother and DICK ride the mare . There is no use telling the world all the particulars , so he simply writes :— “ Ride a cock horse to Banbury Cross . ” He does n't care to mention that two intend to ride the cock horse . If the world chooses to think only one rides him , let them think so . He will write ambiguously if he wants to ; there is no law to prevent him from doing so . “ Now what is to be seen after getting there ? His mother said a beautiful lady on horseback , and splendid music . But that cannot be . What ! a beautiful young lady ride in public on horseback ? She would n't do such a thing . He knows too much for that . It must be some old woman ; and he writes accordingly :— “ To see an old woman ride on a white horse . ” She is to be gayly dressed , he has heard , and loaded with diamond rings ; but how about the music ? Probably she has bells on her toes ; at least he will put it so , and then adds ;— “ Rings on her fingers and bells on her toes . ” He thinks awhile longer . He sees in imagination the venerable old dame riding around on the white horse , gayly dressed and bespangled , the rings glistening , the bells ringing , and his sensitive soul fancies it hears the wonderful music , and he knows that ever and ever , so long as she rides , “ She will have music wherever she goes . ” He has become enraptured with the glowing vision , and now , as he lays down his pen his eyes flash and his cheeks burn with poetic fire . How happy his mother will be to hear the result of his afternoon 's labor ! Rejoicing he descends , taking with him the precious verse , and proudly begins to read it to his appreciative audience . Falteringly he commences , but , warming with the subject , his spirits rise , till at the last line he triumphantly waves the paper over his head , looks around for applause , and sees —— his mother lying on the floor in a dead faint . Pen and Sword . “ War to the knife ! ” is the cry of the Paris Si è cle . This is merely a cry from a Pen-knife , of course ; but then it is sure to be heard by the Butcher-knife . Nurse Wanted .

A THRILLING TALE . WITH EXPLANATORY NOTES . CHAPTER I . Once .— In serious literature you cannot be too exact . You will notice that I say once , not twice or thrice , and you will find that that is a very important point at once . Thus , you might put your hand under a trip-hammer once , but not twice . You might take a trip on a Mississippi steamer , or an Erie train , once . You might go to the Legislature or Congress and be honest once . You might get a seat in a horse-car once . You might be civilly treated by a public official once . You might lend an umbrella , or indulge in the luxury of a lawsuit , or persuade your better half that you are only tired when you are really beery , once ; but , I assure you , that your chance of doing any of those things twice is decidedly slim . If you do any of them once and do n't find yourself in Greenwood , the alms-house , or matrimonial hot water , retire on your laurels and let out the job . CHAPTER II . Upon a time .— This is not a fairy tale , though it opens in a very suspicious manner . It is a sad recital of facts . Upon a time does not mean that any one sat down on a watch , or made himself familiar with the town clock . It is not very specific , I admit . It may refer to any time , but , I think , the design was to call attention to Benedict 's time . You know how it is yourself . You remember how often you have stood on a dock , and seen the steamboat ten feet out in the stream , or have struck a depot just as the train was rolling around a curve in the distance , simply because you were not upon a time . Then , as you walked on the dock or platform , you would strew your pathway with — curses . But I do not mean anything of that sort . No , I refer to something grander , nobler , more magnificent . CHAPTER III . There was .— Here 's explicitness ! Here 's directness ! Here 's explanatoryness ! In my pap days I learned that without a verb there could not be a sentence , not even a judge 's sentence . I know “ was ” ai n't much of a word all alone by itself , but then chuck it in among a lot of other fellows , and how it does make them stand around . And then it 's so deliciously incomprehensible — there was . Mind you , it do n't say that the same thing is n't now . And , mind you , it do n't say whether it refers to the day before yesterday , or the commencement of the Franco-Prussian opera bouffe , or our late unpleasantness , or the beginning of the world , or before that . No , it can n't go back of the beginning , for before that there was n't . Anyhow , it leaves you in such a pleasant state of uncertainty that you very willingly pass on to . CHAPTER IV . A man .— Here we arrive at something specific . “ A two-legged animal , who laughs . ” That definition excludes women , because they giggle , or chuckle , or cachinnate . This expression is a very general one ; it includes a vast number of individuals . It even takes in tailors , for , by a wise provision of Providence , the number of tailors in this world at any one time is always a multiple of nine ; so that you can point to any nine of them and boldly say , a man . I am not sure that this term does not include gorillas , for , by a wise provision of Congress , they can at any time be made men and brethren . One advantage about the subject of this chapter is this : it is never necessary to put a head on it , as it is generally furnished with that appendage by nature . So endeth this thrilling tale . A sequel to it will be published in the early part of the next century , entitled , “ THERE WAS ONCE A TIME UPON A MAN . ” HORSE-CAR HUMBUGS . The Horse-Car is an omnivorous animal , though its chief diet is garbage , as our sense of smell has often proved to us . The “ people 's coach ” it has been called , but in misery 's name , I ask , must the whole public crowd into one coach ? Yesterday , after I had waited for a car the best part of the forenoon , it came crawling along at snail-like pace , the horses fast asleep , and the driver gazing vacantly into space , thoroughly exhausted in endeavors to wake them up . I entered , and was thrust into one of two congealed rows of mortality , which faced each other from opposite benches . Then the people filled the passage ; they crowded it to suffocation ; they piled on to the platforms in battalions ; six wretches depended from the hind brake ; others were suspended from the top of the car , with hands and feet thrust through the leathers , and two actually balanced themselves around the driver 's neck . Fearful moans arose from the enormous mass of condensed humanity ; people panted for breath ; they gasped , and rolled their eyes in horrible frenzy , and still the conductor yelled fiercely , and with demoniac leer :— And thus his Voice rang through the stifling air , “ Plenty of room in front , move forward , there ! ” It was raining ; parasols leaked into my shoes , soaking water-proofs embraced me , and monstrous brogans crushed my feet to chaos ; then , umbrellas punched my eyes , out , jabbed holes in my hat , and wrote hieroglyphics all over my shirt bosom , while baskets of meat were deposited in my lap , and the intruding tail of a codfish roughly slapped my face a dozen times . In short , I emerged from that car ruined , wilted , and utterly demoralized . When I got home my wife did n't know me , and I could only prove my identity by carefully scraping my feet , hanging up my hat , and otherwise exhibiting the results of her superior disciplinary powers . My hardest work , however , was to establish the fact that I had n't been rolled in the gutter , my rheumatic hobble , dilapidated aspect , and blood-shot eyes telling fearfully against me . The next time I ride in a horse-car , I shall take a private hack . S. R . DEEN . A Con of the Period . When this cruel war is over , and crowds of tourists rush to see the place where LOUIS NAPOLEON surrendered , why will that place be like BRYANT 'S Minstrels ? Because such a lot of people will go to See DAN . Con from Our Correspondent in benighted Africa . Why would C Æ SAR have made a fine novelist ? Because he was a great Roman — Sir . HAD HIM THERE .

HA ! HA ! ” ] LETTER FROM A SCHOOLMASTER . MR. PUNCHINELLO : Respected Sir :— I am a schoolmaster , and in investigating , for the benefit of my pupils ( number limited ; English and classical courses ; French and guitar extra ; scholars bring their own slippers and tooth-brushes ; privileges of a home , etc ., etc .) , the vast arena of Science , applied and unapplied , I have found that there are many things that the world does not yet know . This may surprise you , but it is nevertheless true . Through the medium of your valuable journal I propose to give to the world , to which we all owe so much , a few hints in regard to the deficiencies of Science , and thus place these , my carefully nurtured ideas , at the service of my race . It is to be presumed that there are but few persons who have not observed the great benefits of pruning in the vegetable kingdom . He who sits under the shade of his own vine and fig-tree ( or even those which are leased or rented ) will find the shade and the fruit of his vine and his tree greatly increased by judicious and seasonable pruning . The theories of Science and the practice of horticulturists have made this fact so potent that it is needless to enlarge upon it now . But Science stops here . What she has given the world , in respect to this important subject , is of far less value than that of which she has deprived it , by her failure to carry her investigations into the animal kingdom . With the exception of the docking of horses ’ tails and the clipping of the ears of dogs , she has done little or nothing in this respect , and it is much to be feared that the great benefits of pruning , as applied to the human race , are denied to the present generation ; for we all know how difficult it is , in the face of the dogged opposition of the masses , to inaugurate a truly valuable reform . But it is my belief , and I have carefully studied the subject in all its bearings , that the crowning gift of Science to Man will be the system of PRUNING FOR CONSUMPTION . When we consider how the strength of a weak and spindling tree is augmented by the excision of some of its useless branches , we can well understand that weak and spindling man may be strengthened and invigorated by the amputation of one or more of his limbs . The sap , or blood , which was before applied to the support and nourishment of this excised limb , will now assist in the nourishment of the whole body , and the man , like the tree , will become vigorous , stout , and healthy . In proof of this , it is only necessary to consider the condition of those soldiers , sailors , or civilians who have suffered the amputation of a leg or arm . How plump and rosy they all appear ! Is it not certain , then , that instead of wasting their time and substance in Cod-liver oil and trips to Minnesota and Florida , it would be far better for those persons who may fancy themselves consumptive to repair to their physician 's abode , and request him to trim off an arm , a foot , or a leg , according to the urgency of their symptoms ? And if this first pruning were found to be insufficient , the individual might be further trimmed until his form was of a size and extent no greater than his natural forces were capable of nourishing . When this result was attained , the patient might expect to grow as vigorous and wholesome as a properly pruned grape-vine or a dwarf pear-tree . Hoping , respected Sir , that I have made myself intelligible to yourself and readers , and that Science may take the valuable hints I have given her , I am Yours truly , ANDREW SCOGGIN . INCREDIBLE CREDULITY . A CABLE despatch from Paris to PUNCHINELLO ( cost $ 8. 62 ) announces that the editor of La Verit é has been sent to a cold and gloomy dungeon for publishing false news ,— a warning to the Sunny CHARLES , our well-beloved neighbor ! But the most mysterious part of the matter is , that this editorial Frenchman actually published this false news upon the doubly dubious authority of the Chevalier WICKOFF ! Why , this gallant adventurer is so well known in New York that if he should come into our sanctum and tell us that we had fallen heirs to a neat fortune of $ 500 , 000 , we should n't believe him for a moment . A POSITIVE ANALOGY . The Positivists of New York , at a recent meeting , passed unanimously a set of resolutions , in one of which they spoke of King WILLIAM of Prussia as the modern ATTILA . As an admirer of that fine old barbarian , Mr. PUNCHINELLO protests against such a slanderous attack upon his historic reputation . ATTILA and the hordes he led were honest thieves , who made no hypocritical pretences to virtue in order to hide their real motives . They were plunderers by profession , and were not ashamed to openly proclaim it . ATTILA himself , like any high-minded savage of his crew , would have quickly avenged , as an insult , any attempt to ascribe to him another motive for his action than the pure and simple desire for plunder : nor did he and his men pretend to lead the Europe of their day in any of the branches of thought which go towards making the culture of any country . The Positivists have great faith in the historic method of analogy , and they are right in so doing . But in using analogies it is just as well , if not better , to have them analogies . The Peace In Preparation . The new piece which , for the last few weeks , has been announced as in preparation and shortly to appear in the Puppet Show of the European Political Theatre has not yet been produced , and the expecting spectators are asking why ! The reason , however , is plain . The wire pullers have been hard at work , but have been constantly thwarted by finding that the wires which were effective with the imperial dolls will have no effect upon the republican figures . +———————————————————————————————+ | | | A.
