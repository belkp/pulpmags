VOL . XX . LONDON : 1832 PREFACE . The completion of the Twentieth Volume of this Miscellany presents us with another cause for self-gratulation , and thankful acknowledgement to the reading public . This continued and unimpaired success amidst a myriad of new-born aspirants , is the best proof of our maintenance of public esteem ; and so long as our efforts are guided by the same singleness of purpose that first directed them we shall hope for a continuance of such favour . A multitude of contemporaries “ whet each other ; ” “ thinking nurseth thinking ; ” and , in like manner , reading nurseth reading , and awakens a spirit of inquiry , untiring and exhaustless , among all concerned in pursuit and wholesome gratification . In a retrospect of the hundreds of competitors who have started for the prize of public patronage since our outset , we shall not , perhaps , be accused of vanity in placing to our own account the first appropriation of such means as may have contributed to the partial success of our contemporaries . We owe them nothing but good will ; for we rather regard things poetically than politically , and we are anxious to inform and amuse the reader — not to perplex , by constantly reminding him of his uncheery lot in life . Ten years ’ establishment in periodical literature may give us a sort of patriarchal feeling towards others ; for , with one exception THE MIRROR is the oldest weekly journal of the metropolis . In this comparatively long career , our best energies have been directed to the progressive improvement of each department of the work . The plan of embellishment , which may be said to have originated with THE MIRROR , has been extended and improved , until few subjects are incapable of successful illustration in its pages ; due regard being paid to nicety of execution , as well as attractive design . So much for the present , state of our “ representative system . ” The selection of materials for each sheet of THE MIRROR has been regulated by a desire to extend useful information , and to cultivate healthful indications of public taste . In a journal , like the present , mainly devoted to the accumulation of facts , errors and misstatements are inevitable ; but , our own diligence , aided by sharp-sighted Correspondents , has , from time to time , guided us to accuracy in most cases , and directed fruitful inquiry upon matters of no ordinary interest or character . Scientific information , really made popular , and of ready , practical utility , has uniformly found admission in our pages ; and , above all , subjects of natural history have received especial attention , in graphic illustrations — which part of our plan has been adopted by every cheap journal of the last four years ; or , from the first pictorial description of the Zoological Gardens , before the publication of the catalogue by the Society ; while it is a source of gratification to know that within the above period , natural history , from being almost confined to public museums and private cabinets , has become the most popular study and amusement of the present day . Upon the continued cheapness of our little work , we do not intend to touch , more than by reference to the enlargement of the letter-press as commenced with the present volume . The alteration has , we believe , received general approbation ; and , either with regard to the extent of the letter-press , or the condensed character of its subject-matter , we have still the satisfaction of knowing THE MIRROR to continue , as it has often been characterized by contemporaries , “ the cheapest publication of the day . ” Its other merits we are content to leave to the discernment of each reader . Our future volume will be conducted upon the plan of its predecessors , with such improvements as time and occasion may suggest . To one point , economy of space , we promise our best consideration ; though we may not succeed in rivalling Mr. Newberry , who , the good humoured Geoffrey Crayon tells us , was the first that ever filled his mind with the idea of a good and great man . He published all the picture books of his day ; and , out of his abundant love for children , he charged “ nothing for either paper or print , and only a half-penny for the binding . "[ 1 ] Rest unto his soul , say we . This lengthened , but we hope not ill-timed reference to our whole course of Twenty Volumes has left us but little occasion to speak of the present portion , individually ; although we trust this reference would be somewhat supererogatory , from the unusual number of Illustrations , and a copious Index to the main subjects , of the volume . To conclude . We thank all Correspondents for their contributions , and invite their cordial co-operation with our ensuing efforts . So now “ plaudite ! valete ! ” December 26 , 1832 . Bracebridge Hall , vol . i . Illustration ] NOTICES OF WASHINGTON IRVING , ESQ . AND HIS WORKS . Washington Irving was born , in the State of New York , in the year 1782 , and is , consequently , in his fifty-first year . His early life cannot better be told than in his own graceful language , prefixed to the most celebrated of his writings as “ the author 's account of himself . ” “ I was always fond of visiting new scenes , and observing strange characters and manners . Even when a mere child I began my travels , and made many tours of discovery into foreign parts and unknown regions of my native city , to the frequent alarm of my parents , and the emolument of the town-crier . As I grew into boyhood I extended the range of my observations . My holiday afternoons were spent in rambles about the surrounding country . I made myself familiar with all its places famous in history or fable . I knew every spot where a murder or robbery had been committed , or a ghost seen . I visited the neighbouring villages , and added greatly to my stock of knowledge , by noting their habits and customs , and conversing with their sages and great men . I even journeyed one long summer 's day to the summit of the most distant hill , from whence I stretched my eye over many a mile of terra incognita , and was astonished to find how vast a globe I inhabited . “ This rambling propensity strengthened with my years . Books of voyages and travels became my passion , and in devouring their contents , I neglected the regular exercises of the school . How wistfully would I wander about the pier heads in fine weather , and watch the parting ships bound to distant climes ; with what longing eyes would I gaze after their lessening sails ; and waft myself in imagination to the ends of the earth . “ Farther reading and thinking , though they brought this vague inclination into more reasonable bounds , only served to make it more decided . I visited various parts of my own country ; and had I been merely influenced by a love of fine scenery , I should have felt little desire to seek elsewhere its gratification ; for on no country have the charms of nature been more prodigally lavished . Her mighty lakes , like oceans of liquid silver ; her mountains , with their bright a ë rial tints ; her valleys , teeming with wild fertility ; her tremendous cataracts , thundering in their solitudes ; her boundless plains , waving with spontaneous verdure ; her broad , deep rivers , rolling in solemn silence to the ocean ; her trackless forests , where vegetation puts forth all its magnificence ; her skies , kindling with the magic of summer clouds and glorious sunshine :— no , never need an American look beyond his own country for the sublime and beautiful of natural scenery . "[ 2 ] [ Footnote 2 : Sketch Book , vol . i .] Mr. Irving began his career , as an author , in periodical literature . His first work was a humorous journal , entitled “ Salmagundi , or the Whim-Whams and Opinions of Launcelot Langstaff , Esq . and Others , ” originally published in numbers in New York , where it met with a very flattering reception . The date of the first paper is Saturday , January 24 , 1827 . Salmagundi has been several times reprinted in this country ; and it may be acceptable to know , that the cheapest , if not the most elegant , edition may be purchased for twenty-pence . It would be difficult to explain the merits of Salmagundi to the reader , as they are of the most varied character ; but , it may be remarked generally , that a vein of quaint humour and human kindness pervades these early papers , which will bring the reader and writer to the best possible terms . This lively miscellany was followed by a humorous History of New York , with the somewhat droll nom of Dedrick Knickerbocker as its author . It possesses considerable merit , with a nice perception of the ludicrous ; but , on its first appearance , this recommendation was generally overlooked , whether from the local interest of the subject , or the want of due judgment in its readers , it is difficult to determine . About this period Mr. Irvine 's name was heard in England , almost for the first time ; his only claims to public notice resting entirely on Salmagundi , and the History of New York . He was indebted for his introduction to the acquaintance of European readers , to a young fellow-countryman of high attainments , who alludes to the above works and their author in the following terms :— “ Mr. Irving has shown much talent and great humour in his Salmagundi and Knickerbocker , and they are exceedingly pleasant books , especially to one who understands the local allusions . ” A few years subsequent to the publication of Knickerbocker , Mr. Irving visited England , or the “ land of wonders , ” as he facetely terms our favoured isle . During his stay , he wrote a series of papers , illustrative of English manners , which were chiefly printed in America . These papers were afterwards published in a collected form , in England , under the title of “ The Sketch-Book of Geoffrey Crayon , Gent . ” and dedicated to Sir Walter Scott , “ in testimony of the admiration and affection of the author . ” In the advertisement to the Sketch-Book , Mr. Irving thus modestly refers to its origin : “ The author is aware of the austerity with which the writings of his countrymen have hitherto been treated by British critics : he is conscious too , that much of the contents of his papers can be interesting only in the eyes of American readers . It was not his intention , therefore , to have them reprinted in this country . He has , however , observed several of them from time to time inserted in periodical works of merit , and has understood that it was probable they would be republished in a collective form . He has been induced , therefore , to revise and bring them forward himself , that they may at least come correctly before the public . Should they be deemed of sufficient importance to attract the attention of critics , he solicits for them that courtesy and candour which a stranger has some right to claim , who presents himself at the threshold of a hospitable nation . ” Mr. Irving 's solicitations were not made in vain , as the rapid sale of several editions must have convinced him ; while every journalist in the empire hailed the work as the most beautiful specimen of Transatlantic talent which had been recognised in this country . The two volumes of the Sketch-Book appeared at different periods ; and , at the conclusion of the second , we find the following apologetic postscript : “ The author is conscious of the numerous faults and imperfections of his work ; and , well aware how little he is disciplined and accomplished in the arts of authorship . His deficiencies are also increased by a diffidence arising from his peculiar situation . He finds himself writing in a strange land , and appearing before a public , which he has been accustomed , from childhood , to regard with the highest feelings of awe and reverence . He is full of solicitude to secure their approbation , yet finds that very solicitude continually embarrassing his powers , and depriving him of that ease and confidence which are necessary to successful exertion . Still the kindness with which he is treated encourages him to go on , hoping that , in time , he may acquire a steadier footing ; and thus he proceeds , half venturing , half shrinking , surprised at his own good fortune , and wondering at his own temerity . ” The success of the Sketch-Book was followed by the almost equal fortune of “ Bracebridge Hall , or the Humorists ; ” a series of scenes of Old English life , as displayed in one of those venerable halls , that rise , here and there , in a British landscape , as monuments of the hospitality of our ancestors , and better times . In the autobiographical chapter of this work , the writer thus pleasantly refers to his previous success , as “ a matter of marvel , that a man , from the wilds of America , should express himself in tolerable English . I was looked upon as something new and strange in literature ,— a kind of demi-savage , with a leather in his hand , instead of his head ; and there was a curiosity to hear what such a being had to say about civilized society . ” In referring the circumstances under which he writes his second work on English manners , he says : “ Having been born and brought up in a new country , yet educated from infancy in the literature of an old one , my mind was filled with historical and poetical associations , connected with places , and manners , and customs of Europe ; but which could rarely be applied to those of my own country . To a mind thus peculiarly prepared , the most ordinary objects and scenes , on arriving in Europe , are full of strange matter , and interesting novelty . England is as classic ground to an American , as Italy is to an Englishman ; and Old London teems with as much historical association as mighty Rome . ” There is , also , great amiability in the concluding paragraph :— “ I have always had an opinion , that much good might be done by keeping mankind in good humour with one another . I may be wrong in my philosophy ; but I shall continue to practise it until convinced of its fallacy . When I discover the world to be all that it has been represented by sneering cynics and whining poets , I will turn to and abuse it also ; in the meanwhile , worthy reader , I hope you will not think lightly of me , because I cannot believe this to be so very bad a world as it is represented . ” Soon after the publication of Bracebridge Hall , Mr. Irving left this country , where he had passed two years with literary and pecuniary advantage . He quitted England with a pathetic farewell ; declaring that if , as he is accused , he views it with a partial eye , he shall never forget that it is his “ fatherland . ” On the consanguinity of England and America too , and the cultivation of good feeling between them , he thus touchingly expresses himself in Bracebridge Hall : “ We ask nothing from abroad that we cannot reciprocate . But with respect to England , we have a warm feeling of the heart , the glow of consanguinity that still lingers in our blood . Interest apart , past differences forgotten , we extend the hand of old relationship . We merely ask , do not estrange us from you , do not destroy the ancient tie of blood , do not let scoffers and slanderers drive a kindred nation from your side . We would fain be friends , do not compel us to be enemies . ” There is a manly affection in these sentiments which is truly admirable . Mr. Irving 's works , with the exception of his early efforts , [ 3 ] had been the result of his love of travel : indeed , he describes himself as a traveller who has “ surveyed most of the terrestrial angles of the globe . ” In similar vein , he next produced two volumes of “ Tales of a Traveller , ” narrating legends of the continent , with masterly sketches of the scenery of the respective countries ; the incidents of the Tales being fraught with points of grotesque humour , and abounding with pathos and poetic feeling . [ Footnote 3 : Among Mr. Irving 's early effusions are Lines written on the Falls of the River Pasaic which are not printed in the author 's works , but will be found in The Mirror , vol . ii . p . 452 .] To these Tales succeeded a work of greater importance in literature than either of Mr. Irving 's previous undertakings . We allude to a History of the Life and Voyages of Columbus , in four vols . 8vo ., which appeared in the year 1828 . Mr. Irving , at the time this work was first suggested to him , in the winter of 1825-6 , was at Bordeaux ; and , being informed that a biography was about to appear at Madrid , containing many important and some new documents relative to Columbus , he set off for the Spanish capital , to undertake the translation of the work . Mr. Irving , however , meeting with numerous aids at Madrid , resolved on producing an original history , which he has presented to the public with extreme diffidence : “ all that I can safely claim , ” he observes , “ is , an earnest desire to state the truth , an absence from prejudices respecting the nations mentioned in my history , a strong interest in my subject , and a zeal to make up by assiduity for many deficiencies of which I am conscious . ” This work has been abridged by Mr. Irving to one of the volumes of the Family Library . As we have intimated to the reader , it is of higher pretensions than either of the author 's previous writings : a clever critic refers to it as “ a spirited and interesting work , in which every thing is as judiciously reasoned as it is beautifully and forcibly expressed , ” and as “ much more grave in its character and laborious in its execution than any of his preceding ones . "[ 4 ] [ Footnote 4 : New Monthly Magazine .] Mr. Irving 's next production was “ A Chronicle of the Conquest of Granada , ” in which the author 's knowledge of Spanish history is made to shine in detailing the chivalrous glories of the New World . In the spring of the present year it appears that Mr. Irving touched “ the golden shores of old romance , ” and published Tales of the Alhambra ; the origin of which work is thus told by the author . A few years since , Mr. Wilkie , the distinguished R. A. and Mr. Irving were fellow travellers on the continent . In their rambles about some of the old cities of Spain , they were struck with scenes and incidents which reminded them of passages in the Arabian Nights . Mr. Wilkie urged his companion to write something that should illustrate those peculiarities , “ something in the Haroun Alraschid style ” that should have a dash of that Arabian spice which pervades everything in Spain . Mr. Irving set about his task with enthusiasm : his study was the spacious Alhambra itself , and the governor gave the author and his companion , permission to occupy his vacant apartments in the Moorish palace : Mr. Wilkie soon returned to England , leaving Mr. Irving at the Alhambra , where he remained “ for several months , spell-bound in the old enchanted pile . ” The result was two volumes of legends and traditions , which for interesting incident , and gracefulness of narrative , have few parallels in our romance-writing . [ 5 ] They are dedicated , in good taste , to the ingenious originator , Mr. Wilkie . For Two Illustrations and Notice of this interesting work , See Mirror , vol . xix . p. 337 to 342 ; whence the above origin of the work has been quoted .] In person , Mr. Irving is of middle height ; and , according to a contemporary , of “ modest deportment and easy attitude , with all the grace and dignity of an English gentleman . "[ 6 ] Another describes him as “ a most amiable man , and great genius , but not lively in conversation . ” His features have a pleasing regularity , and are lit up , at every corner , with that delightful humour which flows in a rich vein throughout his writings , and forms their most attractive charm . [ Footnote 6 : Fraser 's Magazine .] Having noticed Mr. Irving 's principal works , we have left but little occasion to speak of his general style . A contemporary has denominated him the “ Goldsmith of the age ; ” and of Goldsmith we must remember that , in his epitaph , Dr. Johnson observes : “ he left no species of writing untouched , and adorned all to which he applied himself ” — a tribute which can scarcely be appropriately paid to any writer of our time . However , we know not any author that Mr. Irving so much resembles as Goldsmith : although no imitator , his style and language forcibly remind us of that easy flow so peculiar to the Citizen of the World . But , we have higher warrant for this parallel . “ It seems probable , ” observes a critical writer of considerable acumen , “ that Mr. Irving might prove no contemptible rival to Goldsmith , whose turn of mind he very much inherits , and of whose style he particularly reminds us . Like him , too , Mr. Irving possesses the art of setting ludicrous perplexities in the most irresistible point of view , and we think equals him in the variety of humour . "[ 7 ] [ Footnote 7 : Quarterly Review .— Such is the variety displayed in the Salmagundi ; the papers were supposed to be the joint efforts of several literati .] To conclude , we find the literary character of Mr. Irving illustrated in a contemporary journal , with unusual spirit . “ There never was a writer , ” observes the editor , “ whose popularity was more matter of feeling , or more intimate than Washington Irving , perhaps , because he appeared at once to our simplest and kindliest emotions . His affections were those of ‘ hearth and home ; ’ the pictures he delighted to draw were those of natural loveliness , linked with human sympathies ; and a too unusual thing with the writers of our time — he looked upon God 's works , and ‘ saw that they were good . ’ * * * With him the wine of life is not always on the lees . An exquisite vein of poetry runs through every page ,— and of poetry , his epithets who does not remember — ‘ the shark , glancing like a spectre through the blue seas .
