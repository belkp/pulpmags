Each volume of a successful periodical miscellany resembles Seneca 's “ one good turn — a shoeing-horn to another ; ” and the Editor of THE MIRROR , in prefacing his tenth volume with this comparison , hopes that he does not over-rate what the present patronage of the public encourages him to expect . Indeed , he would fear the suspicion of ingratitude on his part , were he not thus to acknowledge the long-extended success which has attended his labours , from their commencement to the present moment . At the same time , lest vanity should be thought to have mastered his better judgment , he assures his patrons that he does not claim the undivided merit of his good fortune ; since , beyond his own taste of adaptation and selection , he “ misses nothing he can fairly lay his hands on ; ” so that , the multiplicity of his resources being considered , his success is , perhaps , more complimentary to the discernment of the public , than it is laudatory of his individual exertions . As many readers would yawn over a long preface like so much Latin , the Editor will not , in the present instance , subject them to so extraordinary a stretch of ennui , by any lengthy comment on the character of his last volume . He hopes that its contents will be found equal to either of its predecessors ; and , if any superiority be observed , he begs that it may be attributed to the “ march of mind , ” in whose rank and file he may be allowed his proper order . Like the well-graced actor , who , at the conclusion of a play , bows to the performers before he addresses the audience , the Editor first returns his acknowledgments to his several Correspondents , who have contributed to the public entertainment in his last volume : perhaps this class may be very small , although in the usual proportion of good and evil which is scattered up and down all paths of life . To the other and more numerous class , viz . those whose Communications ( from various motives , generally explained ) have not been inserted , the Editor is equally indebted ,— for intention , if not accomplishment ; and he hopes that the performance of his critical duty has been such as to conciliate their respect and good-will . As a pleasantry , he would remind a fair proportion of his readers , that , As the young and forward bud Is eaten by the canker ere it blow , Even so by love the young and tender wit Is turned to folly ; blasting in the bud , Losing his verdure even in the prime , And all the fair effects of future hopes — for he would not affect the fickle guide on so extended a scale . For graver matters , or such as are beyond the surface of the heart , the Editor thanks his Correspondents on subjects of Art , in its antiquarian and modern departments , of whose researches he has frequently availed himself . With a view to keep pace with the Spirit of Philosophical Discovery which characterizes the present day , the Editor has been his own Prometheus in introducing his readers to the “ Arcana of Science , ” the object of which has already been fully explained , and he hopes , to a certain extent , realized . The Editor is not disposed to indulge too freely in anticipation , lest he should lose sight of his object : accordingly , he must be brief in his professions for the future . Improvement is contemplated in the general execution of the Embellishments , as far as the Proprietor and Editor have control ; but , anon , they will be at the bar of public taste . To use a parliamentary phrase , other new “ features ” will be introduced from time to time , so as to continue to reflect in THE MIRROR the characteristics and curiosity of the present day , aided by some of the bright lights of past ages .

MEMOIR OF HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS THE DUKE OF CLARENCE , LORD HIGH ADMIRAL OF ENGLAND . Ye sacred arks of Liberty ! that float Where Tamar 's waters spread their bosom wide , That seem , with towering stern and rampart stride , Like antique castles girt with shining moat : Should War the signal give with brazen throat , No more recumbent here in idle pride , Your rapid prows would cleave the foaming tide , And to the nations speak in thundering note . Thus in the firmament serene and deep , When summer clouds the earth are hanging o'er , And all their mighty masses seem asleep , To execute Heaven 's wrath , and judgment sore , From their dark wombs the sudden lightnings leap , And vengeful thunders peal along the shore . Forget Me Not — for 1828 . The recent appointment of the above illustrious individual to the head of our naval administration is a gratulatory topic for every Englishman ; and we doubt not the measure will contribute as largely to individual honour , as it will to the national welfare . In the abstract , nations resemble large families , of which kings are fathers or guardians ; and the subdivision of this guardianship or paternal government , among the sons or younger brothers of the sovereign is calculated to promote unanimity among the governors , and to engraft with affectionate loyalty the hearts of the governed . Indeed , the tutelar presence of princes seldom fails to inspire courage , and to support the patriotic sons of arms even in the extremes of danger ; and , although the princes of our times have seldom been distinguished in the camp of war ,— we should recollect that Nihil sunt foris arma nisi est consilium domi . The DUKE of CLARENCE , who is next brother to his present Majesty , was born at St. James 's Palace , August 21 , 1765 , at a quarter before four in the morning , and in the following month was baptized by the name of WILLIAM HENRY . It is said that in his childhood and youth , it was the frankness of his countenance and behaviour induced the king to devote him to the naval service : added to this , he surpassed his brothers in corporeal strength and constitutional hardihood ; although he was exceeded by them in the more refined acquirements of study , to which he manifested comparative indifference . With a mind naturally framed for peril and enterprise , and aware of the subordinate rank and laborious stations through which he must pass to distinction , he appears to have been enthusiastic and impatient for the service long before he entered the lists , notwithstanding he commenced his career at the age of fourteen , by joining the Prince George , a ninety-eight-gun ship , recently built , and named after his present majesty . In this ship , under the command of Admiral Digby , his royal highness bore a part in the great naval engagement between the English and Spanish fleets , commanded by Admiral Rodney and Don Juan de Langara . Previous to his leaving the Prince George , he was also present at the capture of a French man-of-war and three smaller vessels , forming part of a considerable convoy ; but in neither of these instances was an opportunity offered for any distinguishing effort of bravery . On this occasion , the Spanish admiral , Don Juan de Langara , on visiting Admiral Digby , was introduced to his royal highness . During the conference between the two admirals the prince retired , and when it was intimated that Don Juan wished to return , his royal highness appeared in the uniform of a midshipman , and respectfully informed the admiral that the boat was ready . The Spaniard was surprised to see the son of his Britannic majesty acting in the capacity of an inferior officer , and emphatically observed to Admiral Digby , “ Well does Great Britain merit the empire of the seas , when humble stations in her navy are filled by princes of the blood . ” We have next the pleasing duty of adverting to two signal exertions of his royal highness in the cause of humanity — conduct which is twice bless 'd : It blesseth him that gives , and him that takes : ‘ Tis mightiest in the mightiest : it becomes The throned monarch better than his crown . The first is thus narrated by a midshipman of the Torbay , in a letter to his friends :— “ Port Royal Harbour , April , 1783 . “ The last time Lord Hood 's fleet was here , a court-martial was held on Mr. Benjamin Lee , midshipman , for disrespect to a superior officer , at which Lord Hood sat as president . The determination of the court was fatal to the prisoner , and he was condemned to death . Deeply affected as the whole body of the midshipmen were at the dreadful sentence , they knew not how to obtain a mitigation of it , since Mr. Lee was ordered for execution ; while they had not time to make their appeal to the Admiralty , and despaired of success in a petition to Admiral Rowley . However , His Royal Highness generously stepped forth , drew up a petition , to which he was the first to set his name , and solicited the rest of the midshipmen in port to follow his example . He then himself carried the petition to Admiral Rowley , and in the most pressing and urgent manner , begged the life of our unhappy brother ; in which he succeeded , and Mr. Lee is reprieved . We all acknowledge our warmest and grateful thanks to our humane , our brave , and worthy prince , who has so nobly exerted himself in preserving the life of his brother sailor . ” In the same year , 1783 , the prince , then a fine midshipman , visited Cape Francois , and the Havannah , where the second instance of his generous humanity occurred . It should be premised , that some of his countrymen having broken their oath of fidelity to the Spanish government , were in danger of suffering under sentence of death . The governor of Louisiana , Don Galvez , offered , at the intercession of the prince , to pardon them ; and the enthusiasm which he manifested in this “ labour of love ” cannot be better illustrated than by the following letter addressed by his royal highness to the governor :— “ Sir ,— I want words to express to your Excellency my just sense of your polite letter , of the delicate manner in which you caused it to be delivered , and your generous conduct towards the unfortunate in your power . Their pardon , which you have been pleased to grant on my account , is the most agreeable present you could have offered me , and is strongly characteristic of the bravery and gallantry of the Spanish nation . This instance increases , if possible , my opinion of your Excellency 's humanity , which has appeared on so many occasions , in the course of the late war . “ Admiral Rowley is to dispatch a vessel to Louisiana for the prisoners . I am convinced they will ever think of your Excellency 's clemency with gratitude ; and I have sent a copy of your letter to the king my father , who will be fully sensible of your Excellency 's attention to me . “ I request my compliments to Madame Galvez , and that you will be assured that actions so noble as those of your Excellency will ever be remembered by “ Yours , sincerely , WILLIAM P . ” On June 17 , 1785 , after a service afloat of six years and three months , his royal highness was promoted lieutenant of the Hebe . In ten months after this we find him serving as captain of the Pegasus ; next in the Andromeda and the Valiant ; and on December 3 , 1790 , his royal highness received a commission as rear-admiral of the blue , having then been about eighteen months a peer of England , Scotland , and Ireland , by the titles of duke of Clarence and St. Andrews , and earl of Munster . From this period till the year 1814 his royal highness remained on shore . On April 19 , in that year , he hoisted his flag on board the Jason , as admiral of the fleet ; and on the 23rd of the same month he sailed from Dover , with several other ships , to escort Louis XVIII . to the coast of France ; and having seen him to Calais , returned to the Downs on the night of the 24th , and struck his flag a few days after . [ 1 ] During the period between the 25th of May and June 28th , 1814 , ( when his royal highness finally took leave of the sea ,) his flag was hoisted , successively , in the Impregnable and Jason , and again in the Impregnable , and from her transferred to the Magicienne ; in which last ship he sailed on the 26th of June , and having escorted the allied sovereigns to the continent , struck his flag , and came on shore . [ 2 ] His royal highness ’ service at sea may , therefore , be stated as follows :— 6 years as midshipman ; 11 months as lieutenant ; 3 years and 10 months as post captain ; and 7 weeks as admiral of the fleet : making a total service at sea of about 10 years and 9 months . [ 3 ] The intimacy of the prince with the gallant Nelson is well known as one of the most interesting incidents of the duke 's life . They first met at Quebec in 1782 , when Nelson was in the Albemarle off that station , and whence he was ordered to convoy a fleet of transports to New York . From this time they became much attached , and their separation was the cause of mutual regret . At the close of the war they met again , both being appointed to the Leeward island station . Nelson soon had an opportunity of witnessing the prince 's resolute obedience to orders , amidst great personal danger , and strong temptations to avarice , the circumstances of which are briefly as follow :— The law excluded all foreign vessels from trade and intercourse with our West India islands ; and America , being now independent , and as much a foreign nation as any other , Nelson , the senior captain on the station , ordered all American vessels to quit the islands within forty-eight hours , on pain of seizure , and prosecution of their owners . Four vessels at Nevis remained , which he ordered to be searched , and on being found American , they were adjudged legal prizes . This proceeding placed Nelson in considerable difficulty , but he ultimately triumphed ; and though the thanks of government for protecting its commerce were given to the admiral of the station , who had in fact opposed the measure , Nelson was conscious of having done his duty , and enjoyed the approbation of such as were disinterested witnesses of it . Among these was Prince William , who thus notices Nelson 's conduct on this occasion in a letter to a friend : “ It was at this era , ” says the prince , “ that I particularly observed the greatness of Nelson 's superior mind . The manner in which he enforced the spirit of the Navigation Act first drew my attention to the commercial interests of my country . We visited different islands together ; and as much as the manoeuvres of fleets can be described off the headlands of islands , we fought over again the principal naval actions in the American war . Excepting the naval tuition which I had received on board the Prince George , when the present Rear Admiral Keats was lieutenant of her , and for whom we both entertained a sincere regard , my mind took its first decided naval turn from this familiar intercourse with Nelson . ” It is also worthy of remark , that while the prince spoke thus highly of Nelson , the latter estimated his royal highness in correspondent terms . In a letter to Captain Locker , about the same period , Nelson says , “ You must have heard , long before this reaches you , that Prince William is under my command . I shall endeavour to take care that he is not a loser by that circumstance . He has his foibles as well as private men , but they are far overbalanced by his virtues . In his professional line he is superior to near two-thirds I am sure of the list ; and in attention to orders , and respect to his superior officers , I hardly know his equal . His royal highness keeps up strict discipline in his ship , and without paying him any compliment , she is one of the finest ordered vessels I have seen . ” These opinions , it should be recollected , are quoted from private correspondence — a circumstance which adds materially to their value . On July 11 , 1818 , his royal highness was married at Kew to her serene highness Adelaide Amelia Louisa Theresa Caroline , princess of Saxe Meinengen , eldest daughter of his serene highness the late reigning duke of Saxe Meinengen . The ceremony , as is usual on these occasions , was performed by the Archbishop of Canterbury , in the presence of all the royal family . By this marriage his royal highness had one daughter , who was born March 27 , 1819 , and died after a few hours . In 1823 , his royal highness was made a general of marines ; and within the past year the duke has been appointed lord high admiral of England . It is not our intention here to enter into the supposed causes of the duke 's long seclusion from public service , viz . from 1790 to the present time , except a short interval in 1814 . At the commencement of the war with France , the late Duke of York took an early and active part by land ; hence the question arises as to the non-appointment of the Duke of Clarence to a similar position by sea . The consequence has been , that the most vigorous portion of the duke 's life has been lost to his country , whilst his royal highness has remained in comparative obscurity , amidst one of the most brilliant periods of our naval history . It is , however , gratifying to know that the duke 's inactivity cannot be attributed to apathy on his part . On the contrary , he was anxious to be employed , and even sought appointment , as appears by the following letter , written by his royal highness to Commodore Owen in 1812 :— “ Bath House , Saturday night . “ DEAR SIR — This evening I received your letter from Deal , and in answer to it , I beg to observe , that I have made both a public and private application to the king , that I may be permitted to hoist my flag , and relieve Lord Collingwood in the command of his majesty 's fleet in the Mediterranean . There cannot be any secrecy in this thing ; because , before more than fifty brother officers , I declared my resolution at Portsmouth . Until I have the order to hoist my flag , I cannot be certain ; but I am very much inclined to think eventually that I shall have the honour and the happiness of commanding those fine fellows whom I saw in the spring in the Downs , and lately at Portsmouth . My short stay at Admiral Campbell 's had impressed me with very favourable ideas of the improved state of the navy ; but my residence at Portsmouth has afforded me ample opportunity of examining , and consequently of having a perfect judgment of the high and correct discipline now established in the king 's service . * * * I could not resist what I felt ; and reasons , both public and private , urged me to make the offer I have already mentioned , and I hope I shall be gratified .— I remain , dear sir , yours , & c . “ WILLIAM . ” These zealous sentiments are , however , further corroborated by a recent declaration of the duke to the Goldsmiths ’ Company , on their presenting him with the freedom of their society . Having sketched the principal circumstances which appertain to what may be termed the public career of his royal highness , it is our less pleasant , though equally important , duty , to notice his domestic life ; for obvious reasons our details will be less perfect . It is a portion of the duke 's life which cannot be entirely passed over in silence , since it must be conceded , that much of his unpopularity may be traced to this source . Neither the court nor the people of England are so ascetic as not to extenuate the indiscretions of royalty ; but this charitable estimate of misgivings does not extend to approbation of any culpable dereliction of social and moral duties . The fact of his royal highness having a large family , by a lady now no more , is too well known to be concealed ; but the odium attached to his royal highness for his participation in a certain scene of license and poverty , has doubtless been over-rated ; but his proportion must be left for the biographer of a future age to settle ; and we sincerely hope that , to quote a contemporary , “ when the time arrives that the historian shall feel himself at liberty to enter into details , and sift matters to the bottom , his royal highness will come out of the investigation , ( not without some blame , for which of us is faultless , but ) with a character unsullied even in this respect , and in all other respects irreproachable . ” Mankind are , more or less , the children of error ; but their propensity to exaggerate human frailty deserves to be reprobated for its cruelty and wickedness . The happy marriage of his royal highness , to which event we have already alluded , has , we trust , been the means of clearing away the prejudices which the duke 's former conduct may have engendered . There is a tide in the affairs of man , Which taken at the flood leads on to fortune . This period of his royal highness ’ life has probably arrived , and his appointment to the important office of Lord High Admiral will doubtless accelerate the beneficial effect . The public are perhaps sanguine in their expectations ; but from early and subsequent proofs of the duke 's devotion and attachment to the service over which he now presides , we have reason to think they will not be disappointed . It has been shown that his royal highness neither wanted zeal nor ability at any stage of his life , and the ardent assurances which have been quoted from one of his most recent declarations , bespeak that he still possesses the vigour of manhood , tempered with experience ; and it must be truly gratifying to his royal highness to know that the honour and authority of the office of Lord High Admiral , have been revived , after the sleep of a century , as if to compensate him for past neglect , with their investiture . [ 4 ] In truth , the alacrity with which the duke has already entered into the duties of his office , and the lively sense of justice he has manifested in dispensing its honorary rewards , must be gladly hailed by the service , and the country at large . His royal highness 's present emoluments may be stated as follow :— Income on the Consolidated Fund , previous £. s. d. to the death of the Duke of York : 26 , 500 0 0 By the death of the Duke of York 3 , 000 0 0 Additional grant , February , 1827 3 , 000 0 0 And to the Duchess 6 , 000 0 0 As Ranger of Bushy Park 187 9 8 Halfpay as Admiral of the Fleet 1 , 095 0 0 Pay as General of the Marines 1 , 728 15 0 Salary as Lord High Admiral 5 , 000 0 0 [ 5 ] Total Annual Income 46 , 511 4 8 The Duke of York is acknowledged by Mr. Peel , in his speech , Feb. 17 , 1827 , to have had £ 50 , 000 . a-year . We subjoin the following characteristic anecdote from the New Sailor 's Magazine for December , 1827 , sketched with fidelity and in that rich vein of humour by which stories of the service are usually distinguished . It exhibits the character of his royal highness in all the glowing generosity of buoyant youth , and proves him to possess a warm-hearted sympathy for the sufferings of his fellow-creatures — THE ROYAL REEFER AND BOB CLEWLINES . It was on one of those December days , when the wind , blowing from the northward , acts almost like a razor on the surface of the skin , and when , accompanied by small sharp rain , a mixture of damp and cold produce a chilling effect upon the frame and spirits , that a ci-devant midshipman , his hands in his pockets , and “ Whistling as he went for want of thought , ” crossed London-bridge , which at that time was an asylum to the footsore , the pauper , and the weary of heart . The day had fallen , and every thing looked dull and dreary ; the foot-path was encumbered by mud , and porters carrying weights , as well as other busy passengers , were jostling each other to obtain a footing on the dirty pavement : a fellow heavy laden came in contact with the royal reefer [ 6 ] so powerfully , that he took a lee-lurch , and got foul of one of the seats in the arches . “ Avast there ; luff up , you lubberly rigged son of a gun , ” cried middy ; “ could n't you hail ship before you were aboard of us ? ” The fellow , however , waddled on ; but the middy had to turn about in order to regain his course , when suddenly he beheld a middle-aged figure , perishing with cold , a red night-cap on , an old jacket and trousers , a pair of shoes in rags attached to his legs with a rope 's end , no shirt , no stockings , nor any other attire ; the face was climate-struck , it had braved the equator and the pole , the battle and the breeze , the scorching heat and the petrifying cold ,— it was , as might be expected , thin , and moreover almost lost in a profusion of hair on each cheek , so that it would be difficult for the oldest acquaintance to recognise the features after long absence ; nature had made the lips to smile , the eyes to beam in kindness , the fine high forehead to command respect ; but time and hardships , disease and disappointment , had quenched the fire of the organ of sight and intelligence , the mirror of the soul ,— had prematurely furrowed that front of honest English high spirit and candour , and had taught the lips to fall in dejection and the treasured silence of woe : upon the whole , the figure had something fierce in it , but it was truly manly ; the warrior 's arms were folded together , and his face , bent towards the ground , was still half up-turned , and seemed to say to rich merchants and venders passing by on foot and in carriages , “ There ye are , ye liers upon beds of down , ye feeders upon the poor man 's toil ; often have you slept secure , and safely enjoyed your wealth , whilst poor Jack rode out the gale , hung on the rigging betwixt life and death , and endured the storm which held him every moment betwixt the chance of clinging to a fragment of the wreck and sinking into eternity : but , now the war is over , smart-money paid for a sharp wound , and neglect and oblivion , are the seaman 's portion . ” The expression of his face and eyes seemed to speak thus ; indeed , it spoke volumes ; but its mute appeal was lost on the worldlings , who brushed by him , and who , bent on love of gain , scarcely were aware that their fellow-man was starving by their side , too feeble and too much an outcast to work , yet too proud to beg ; the middy 's heart , however , was of that texture that it leant towards a brother-sailor , meet him where it might , and he naturally looked round at poor Jack on his beam-ends : he had but one penny in his pocket , and that the plaintive voice of a blind woman had drawn , as if by magic , from its deep recess . What was to be done ?— for he should have liked to have taken this wreck of a man of war into tow . The reflection caused him to examine more closely the shivering seaman , when a small scar , occasioned by a splinter , on the bridge of the nose , brought to his remembrance Bob Clewlines , who had served in the same ship : the tar recognised him also ; but , so far from making himself known to him , he hid his face in his hand : the reefer , however , was resolved to bring him to . “ What , Bob Clewlines ! ” cried he , “ do I not hail an old shipmate in you , a quarter-master on board the ——, the bravest heart of oak , the best reefer , and the merriest steersman of the whole ship 's crew ; and , ” said he audibly , that every one passing might hear and value fallen courage and fidelity , “ and as prime a seaman as ever trimmed a sail , or served a gun ; why , what has broke up your old hulk this way ? ” The man could not find utterance ; remembrance of unrequited services and other associations checked him . The middy stretched out his hand , which the broken-hearted sailor ventured not to take . “ Come , Bob , ” cried the other , “ no subordination now : we are all equals on life 's quarter-deck , and when my fellow-man suffers , he rises a peg in my estimation . Why ?— because unfeeling lubbers slight him . Come tip us your fin . Your hand may be dirty , but your soul is as kind as a new sail in a sunny day . I 'll show it against any lord 's in the land . Come , heave a head ; follow me , old tarry breeches ; I 'll soon set your timbers and rigging to rights ; you shall have an entire refit . Come , bear a hand ; set all your canvass ; it 's all in ribbons , I see , and shivers in the wind ; but I 'll keep out wind and weather for you . ” Thus saying , he walked proudly with the poor tar , astern of him , until he came to a slop-shop , near Wellclose square : it was a Jew 's . “ Here , Moses , ” quoth the middy , who detected the Israelite bending looks of disdain and mistrust on the poor man , as if he considered the contents of his shop in danger : “ come , Moses , a regular built outrig for this gentleman , ” laying great stress on the word gentleman . This was pitching it strong , but his heart was carrying royals , sky-scrapers , moon-rakers , and his pulse was sailing at the rate of ten knots an hour at least ; so elate was he to serve a brave man in distress , and above all , a son of the ocean : “ come , let us have every thing good , and spic and span new . ” — “ Pray , Shair , who 's to pay ? ” — “ Myshelf . ” — “ O , your honour , that 's right . ” The poor man retired to a back-room , and stepped forward clad from head to foot , and with two changes of linen and a pair of shoes ( by the midshipman 's order ) tied up in a pocket-handkerchief under his arm . BOB CLEWLINES looked with a blush on his old clothes , and at this moment an almost naked boy passed by : the midshipman duly appreciated and truly interpreted one look of the tar . “ Bob , I say , heave that overboard , and let the poor boy pick it up : one good turn deserves another . ” The payment was the next . “ Three pounds fifteen .— Is that the lowest ? ” — “ O , yesh : I do n't gain five shillings by the whole deal . ” — “ Well , then , do you take the case of my gold watch , and weigh it , and give me the produce of it . ” — “ Let ush see : it 's vary pretty , but not vary heavy ; it 's all fashion you see : indeed , it 's a great pity to part , the vatch and the caish ; watches are a drug now , or else I 'd buy it ; but just to oblige you , I 'll see what I can give . ” — “ Do n't trouble yourself , Mosey ; just do as you are bid : you take the outside case , and I 'll keep the watch . ” — “ I shall lend you four pounds upon it , ” resumed the Israelite ; “ and you may depend upon my honour to return it to you , when you bringsh me de monish . ” — “ No , you wo n't , Mosey ; you 'll do just what I bid you . ” — “ It will spoil the watch ” — “ Not a bit ; she must work without her jacket , as my friend has often done in all weathers . I shall sell the outside case to serve a shipmate in distress ; but the watch was left me by a dear friend , so I shall keep her : a metal case will do as well for a little time , and when fortune 's breeze springs up again , the case will be altered . ” — “ Vel , shair , you shall be obeyed : five pounds , five shillings is just the price of the weight ; there 's the money . ” — “ Good morning , Master Moses ; but do you , Clewlines , set sail again ; I want to get you into port : it is only what I owe you . Were you not the kindest creature to me in the world when I was confined to my berth with the yellow fever , and not expected to live a day ? Come , come , you must take your cargo in ; you must be victualled as well as refitted . I have got a chalk at a house near this ,— another shipmate who is set up in business in a public line : call for what you want , and here 's the loose change to keep your pocket until something turns up . ” Poor Bob got a good dinner , a good bed , and a snug hammock , that night ; and shortly afterwards he obtained a birth in an Indiaman , and is now doing well . The royal reefer 's heart bounded with joy at performing this noble action to recover which he put himself for a month on short allowance . But this is only one of many such traits in the character of this heart of oak whose name the writer could scarcely venture to state , but who will here remember this scene . HARRY HATCHWAY . H. M.

By way of a tail-piece to this already extended memoir , we present our readers with an accurate engraving of THE ROYAL CLARENCE CUP , Illustration given by the gentlemen of the Thames Yacht Club , in honour of his royal highness the Lord High Admiral having condescended to become the patron of the club , on Thursday September 27 , 1827 . A steam packet was engaged , to accompany the match , by the Club for the accommodation of their friends , among whom we had the good fortune to be numbered . It was altogether a most grateful relaxation from our land labours . The distance sailed was from off Blackwall to Gravesend and back , and the muster of the fleet almost unprecedentedly fine . The whole of the vessels were admirably managed throughout , the match , which towards the close , became intensely interesting . At length it was decided by the Lady Louisa , ( Mr. Thomas Smith , owner ) arriving first at Blackwall , distancing eight others , but gaining the victory with only a few minutes to spare . If we recollect “ right well , ” the day was fine for the advanced period of the season , and on board the several vessels packets , and on the banks of the river , there were the usual humours of an aquatic spectacle without any of its vulgarisms . The cup , weighing 85 oz . and standing nearly two feet high , is of silver , elegantly chased , and as our engraving imports , of classical design ; and its exhibition , with the customary ceremony of presentation , toasting , & c. appeared to afford much satisfaction to the assembled company , and the victorious claimant of the prize , and equal credit to the taste of the artist , Mr. Hyams .
