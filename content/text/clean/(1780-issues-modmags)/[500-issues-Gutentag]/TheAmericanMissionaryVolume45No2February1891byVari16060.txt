THE AMERICAN MISSIONARY . VOL . XLV . FEBRUARY , 1891 . No . 2 . American Missionary Association . OUR LIST OF FIELD WORKERS . We present herewith our usual February list of missionaries , in church and school , through the field of the Association . In this list many thousands of our readers will recognize familiar names , some through personal associations and others through their long-time acquaintance with the work of the Association . It is no unimportant feature of the great principle of co-operation on which our work is founded that we can reckon upon a large force of long-tried and experienced workers in the field . The Association has a wealth of wisdom in planning and carrying on its work , by its ability to call into requisition the knowledge and efforts of those who have spent many years in the South , and are intimately acquainted with the needs , difficulties and advantages of the work . Many individualistic schemes have failed at this point ; but the Association has developed a force that can be relied upon for the intelligent investigation of new openings , the prudent planning of work and its wise and steady support and development . At the same time , associated with our older workers , we have the younger missionaries and teachers with their fresh enthusiasm and fervent zeal , giving new impulse of activity all along the line . This long list of names represents years of self-denying attention and steady effort ; it speaks of large progress in the past and is the presage of still greater progress in the future , for the list grows year by year . Our resources and forces were never before so large as during the past year , and we are encouraged to hope that they will be increased during the year to come . FINANCIAL . Our current receipts for December were nearly $ 52 , 000 , an increase of $ 11 , 000 over those of December , 1889 . For the first quarter of our present fiscal year the current receipts amount to $ 106 , 000 , as against $ 100 , 000 for the corresponding period of last year . We thankfully appreciate every enlargement of our resources , and shall continue to use our best endeavors to keep the work within the means provided for it . How difficult this is can be understood only by those who are in constant receipt of numerous exigent calls for work in the great populations among which our service lies . As a matter of record , notwithstanding the utmost care on our part , while our receipts for this quarter have gained $ 6 , 000 over those of last year , our expenses have increased $ 12 , 000 . We are profoundly grateful for the increasing public interest and Christian co-operation in the work of the American Missionary Association , and hope that the gifts of the churches will continue to be accompanied by their counsels and their prayers . THEOLOGICAL INSTRUCTION . The association is undertaking to supply the serious need , met all along its lines of missionary service , of a more intelligent and consecrated ministry . For the use of our Biblical Training School for the ministry , at Fisk University , we are engaged in the erection of the building ; and the work has been taken hold of by the Fisk University Singers , who are meeting with cheering encouragement in the churches . It is our hope that , within the coming year , an adequate structure may be provided for this important work . The theological department at Howard University has received a valuable accession to its faculty in the person of Prof. Ewell . This work will now be re-classified and developed , and will offer unexcelled advantages for practical training in preparation for the gospel ministry . CONFERENCE WITH INDIAN COMMISSIONERS . The Annual Conference of the Board of Indian Commissioners with the representatives of the various religious bodies having charge of Indian Missions was held in the parlors of the Riggs House , January 8th . The presence of Senator Dawes , Representative Cutcheon , and other distinguished persons , gave weight to the deliberations , and special interest was added to the meeting by the troubles now prevailing in the Dakotas among the Sioux Indians . Commissioner Morgan , Captain Pratt of the Carlisle School , General Armstrong of Hampton , and the Secretaries of the Missionary Societies presented an array of facts and of recent information that gave a more favorable aspect to the situation than is generally entertained . The disturbance among the Indians is confined to at most 5 , 000 among the 250 , 000 , and strong hopes are entertained that serious bloodshed may be avoided . And yet , so great is the uncertainty hanging over this matter , that before these lines reach our readers , the daily press may give sad news of battle and disaster . The discussions of the Conference were ended with a series of resolutions , the purport of which may thus be summed up : The Dakota trouble is confined to a small number of Indians , and is due to the inevitable opposition of the chiefs and anti-progressive elements among the masses of the Indians . The removal of experienced Indian Agents for political reasons was deprecated , and the importance of permanence in the lines of policy pursued in the educational and Christianizing influences was emphasized . Larger appropriations by the Government to establish an adequate system of common-school education , until every Indian child is enabled to attend school , compulsory education and the continued support to contract schools , and additional facilities for securing lands in severalty to the Indians , were endorsed . The decision which it was understood the Government had made , not to transfer the care of the Indians to the War Department , was warmly approbated . THE INDIAN PROBLEM . The present difficulties among the Indians in the Dakotas will probably lead to a re-consideration of the whole system by which the Government and the nation deals with these people . As a contribution to that discussion , we present in condensed form some suggestions recently published in a Boston paper , from our esteemed friend , S. B . Capen , Esq ., whose intelligent interest in the Indian entitles his opinion to thoughtful consideration : While public attention is everywhere called to this matter , it is time to agitate for a radical change in the whole administration of the Indian service . We believe that this should be disconnected entirely from the Department of the Interior , and be made a separate department . This whole Indian question is so important and so complex that it ought not to be simply an annex to a department which has under its control land , patents , etc . It should stand by itself ; there should no longer be a divided responsibility , which is always productive of evil . We are finding the necessity in our cities of making responsibility more direct and personal . The time , we believe , has fully come to reorganize the Indian service on this basis . Our criticism is not against any individual , but against a system which is the growth of many years . We would suggest the following ; 1 . Have the Commissioner of Indian Affairs responsible only to the President and to the public . What he does , or may do , shall not be controlled by the Department of the Interior . 2 . Ask Congress to provide such legislation that no agents or teachers shall ever be removed without proper cause . 3 . All inspectors and special agents shall be under the absolute control of the Commissioner . 4 . There shall be a division of the Indian reservation into school districts , with an assistant superintendent for each . It shall be their duty to visit the schools constantly , and keep themselves in full sympathy and touch with the work . This is the method in the States — an official responsible for a field which he can properly cover . EDUCATORS ’ CONVENTION . The recent Educators ’ Convention of Atlanta was a large and significant gathering . Such consultations of teachers carry a wide and beneficial influence . We learn that the papers and addresses were of a high character , and that the discussions were carried on with great interest , and we have no doubt that the educational work throughout the South will feel the upward impulse of this Convention . We quote the following paragraph from the excellent report in the Congregationalist : The importance of the work of the Convention may be indicated by the topics discussed : Education in Rural Districts , Relative Mortality of the Colored Race , Hygiene , Industrial Training , Better Teaching in the Elementary Grades , A Scientific Course in the College Curriculum , Compulsory Education , What Can the Negro Do ? What the Ministry is Doing to Elevate the Freedmen . A r é sum é was given of the educational work of the different denominations , mainly by the secretaries of their educational societies . The reports of the colored Methodist churches were especially interesting , as indicating the gratifying extent to which the colored people are taking hold of the work of their own education . No paper of the Convention , however , was received with such spontaneous enthusiasm and applause as the report of Dr . Beard of the work of the American Missionary Association . It was the eloquence of facts . The proceedings of the Association will constitute a large volume , which will soon be published and widely circulated . “ AN OPEN PATH FOR TALENT . ” Napoleon said this was the meaning of the French Revolution . He gave promotion in the army not for what a man 's ancestry had been , but for what the man himself could do . Who else ever had such efficient subordinates ? Opportunities became open generally in France , according to each one 's personal ability . The excesses of the revolutionary period were transitory . The enlargement of the nation 's power , by removing the fetters of prescription , has been permanent . The recuperative energy displayed by France in the last twenty years is a marvelous example of the strength imparted by liberty . The educational work of the American Missionary Association in the South makes no revolutionary disturbance . It quietly opens a path for talent whose existence had been before unnoticed or denied . It has been already instrumental in bringing forward many men and women to positions of influence . Beginning with the lowest branches of education , it trained the first colored teachers for the State school systems . Its schools for higher education have as yet come far short of supplying the demand for advanced teachers and for educated ministers and other educated professional and business men . We cannot make talent , but opening the door for talent to find development and activity adds rich gifts to the Nation 's life . IRRESPONSIBLE INSTITUTIONS . The Independent , in its Symposium of December 11th upon Gen. Booth 's Plan , has an article from Charles D. Kellogg , Superintendent of the Charity Organization Society , in which , referring to a certain irresponsible piece of charity , he says : We do not believe that it is right for any one to ask for the support of such an individual enterprise , except from those who give it because of personal knowledge and confidence in the manager . When the public is appealed to , such contributions take on the nature of trust funds , the receipts and disbursements of which should be audited and accounted for in the fullest and frankest manner . To encourage such private , uncontrolled and unaccounted for undertakings , is simply to open the door for any number of conscienceless schemers who are quick to impose upon the benevolent public . The same is true of irresponsible educational institutions . All who receive funds for such charitable purposes , are virtually stewards of trust money and ought to give an account of the same . All properties thus developed ought to be put into a shape to be held securely and perpetuated , and not left to become the personal possession of the solicitors . Pious zeal and “ faith ” do not prevent the waste in such a case . “ Wisdom would not put cut and hammer-faced stone for the foundation of a mountain school house , and costly glass in the windows , ” but “ faith ” has done this , and keeps on doing similar things . NOTES FROM NEW ENGLAND . By District Secretary C. J . Ryder , Boston , Mass . TWO WAYS OF DOING IT . “ So you have come ! Well ! I do n't know but it is just as favorable a time as any . Still , we are in a very pinched condition . We have a debt that we have carried for ten years and have scarcely been able to pay the interest . The parsonage is in a desperate condition , and we are very far from comfortable in it . Secretary Hood was here two months ago , and he stirred the people up and took all that ought to be given to any of our Benevolent Societies . Then , a month ago , Puddefoot was here , and you know he sweeps in everything that can possibly be reached . I sometimes think that he awakens too much interest , and that the churches give too large collections . Our women are all interested in the American Board , and will not feel like doing much for the American Missionary Association Still , it is the time for our annual collection , and I think no harm can come from an address on the A. M. A . work to-morrow . We are very glad to see you . ” This is one way . “ How do you do , dear old friend ? I declare , it seems as if I had known you a life-time . I am ever so glad you could come and speak to my church to-morrow . We need stirring up tremendously . Although my people are a large-hearted , generous people , they are so much absorbed with our own interests here , that I fear sometimes they do not appreciate the larger work done through the Benevolent Societies . Secretary Creegan was here a little while ago and took away a splendid collection , but he left a lot of ripe grain to be gathered in the harvest of some other society . Then , dear old Puddefoot came here and rattled the dry bones till he made living men and women out of some of the skeletons . He took away one of the largest checks that ever went from our congregation to any benevolent cause . Secretary Maile presented the work of the College and Education Society in such a way as to rouse the people to a sense of its great importance . We are wonderfully glad to see you and you see are all ready for another ingathering to-morrow . These brethren have left more than they took away in money , and have enlarged the scope of vision of a good many people . They see the importance and the growing needs of these Mission fields , as never before . Put in your best blows to-morrow . Do n't be afraid that you will take anything away that ought to remain in the community ; that is n't possible . God bless you in the splendid work the A. M. A . is doing ! ” Now , brethren , these are two typical ways of meeting the collecting Secretary when he calls . Which is the better way ? WHAT THE YOUNG PEOPLE AND CHILDREN ARE DOING THROUGH THE AMERICAN MISSIONARY ASSOCIATION . The readers of this department of the AMERICAN MISSIONARY magazine will remember that some time ago the Busy Bees in the First Church in Dover , N. H ., contributed money enough to furnish the nucleus of a greatly needed Reference Library at Gregory Institute , Wilmington , N. C . This was the beginning of several such movements on the part of the young people and children . The Y. P. S. C. E . of Dorchester contributed a goodly sum for the establishment of such a library at Grand View , Tenn. A gift toward the work in Alaska comes from the Y. P. S. C. E . at Dedham . A good many Sunday-schools have also contributed both to the general fund and to special objects . In Gorham , Maine , the children were greatly interested in the Stereopticon Exhibition , which was conducted by our faithful missionary , Rev . S. E . Lathrop . Three of them determined to give something substantial to this work . In order to raise money , they held a Fair , making with their own hands many of the articles that were for sale . This resulted in a considerable amount , which was supplemented by a gift from the Sunday-school to constitute one of these children , Robert Hinkley , a boy eight years of age , a Life Member of the American Missionary Association . Is he not the youngest Life Member of our Association ? Cannot we have some letters from our friends giving the ages of children who are Life Members ? If any feel disposed to “ beat the record ” by the payment of thirty dollars , they can confer this honor upon their baby boy or girl . One baby in New England , at least , has contributed to the work among the millions of neglected children , just by being born . The father , a pastor of one of our churches , hands into the treasury each year one dollar for each pound the baby weighs . When this is known , there will be many of our missionaries who will be praying for the health and rapid growth of that baby ! In Melrose , also , the “ Golden Rule Mission Band ” are helping our great work , and at the same time gaining an intelligent knowledge of this field . At the beginning of the summer one dollar and twenty-five cents was distributed among them , each one taking five cents . This was the seed from which they reaped a harvest of twenty-six dollars . The following are some of the methods by which they secured this remarkable result . One little girl bought flower-seeds and raised flowers which she sold , and made five dollars from her five cents . Another made candy and sold it . A little boy had a peanut stand , and one little fellow earned his money by “ going without things . ” Could not older people follow his example ? It suggests Thoreau 's epigram , “ Your wealth is measured by the number of things you can go without ; ” or , better yet , Paul 's magnificent words , “ poor , yet making many rich . ” This little fellow has hit upon the real principle of success , whether the life is spent in a field of active missionary work , or in “ doing without things ” for Christ 's sake , that His name may be proclaimed , and that His kingdom may come . CALLS FOR BOOKS . Calls often come to us from the field for hymn books . Churches or individuals having unused books , enough of the same kind to supply a small congregation , can get them put where they will do the most good by sending them to our rooms prepaid . If any of our pastors have BARNES ’ NOTES in complete or incomplete sets , which they may now no longer need , the American Missionary Association can use them most profitably in supplying their young missionaries . Send them to us at the Bible House . THE FIELD . 1890-1891 .

The Ballard School at Macon , Ga , is in high prosperity . Straight University under its new President , Oscar Atwood , is moving forward most hopefully . A council of five neighboring churches at McLeansville , N. C ., Dec ., 31 , 1890 , ordained Brother C. C . Collins to the gospel ministry . Rev . A. W . Curtis of Raleigh was Moderator , and Rev . A. Connet of McLeansville , Scribe . A gracious religious interest is reported from Fisk University , Nashville , Tenn ., and many hopeful conversions have gladdened the hearts of our teachers there . The pastor of the Howard Church at Nashville , Tenn ., writes us of twenty-one conversions during Mr. Wharton 's stay with him . Six conversions are also reported at Thomasville , Ga . From Knoxville , Tenn ., comes this word : The labors of Mr. and Mrs. Wharton were greatly blessed of the Lord , the hearts of Christians were revived and twenty-six souls were brought to the knowledge of Christ . We are very hopeful of many of the most promising and influential young people . Our Sabbath-school has just been reorganized and a number of the converts have been put into active service . We expect good results to follow the work of the evangelists for a long time to come . From Memphis , Tenn : Our attendance for last November ran up to the goodly number 508 . The present month will show an advance on this number , and for January we expect to reach the 550 stage . The increase must be confined chiefly to the night school , which is flourishing . At the recent Tenth Anniversary of the Lincoln Memorial Church in Washington , the following facts were stated : The church was organized January 10 , 1881 , with eleven members , and its present enrollment is 235 . It has sustained a sewing-school , in which over 400 girls have been taught . It held night schools until night schools were opened in the public schools , and it now sustains a kindergarten . It has sustained various branches of missionary , temperance and charitable work . It has a flourishing Sunday-school and senior and junior Societies of Christian Endeavor . A Sunday-school superintendent in the South needs a Bible Dictionary for the use of himself and his school . Who will send a good second-hand one for him ? We will forward it . TOUGALOO UNIVERSITY , MISS . The University of Tougaloo is most beautifully located on a plantation of five hundred acres among great oak trees festooned with Spanish moss . We have been having delightful weather for the past month , corresponding somewhat to our Northern October weather . It is truly pitiful to think how most of our pupils have lived before coming here . One girl had never seen a flight of stairs before and stood helplessly at the bottom , not knowing how to climb them : and finally attempted to go up on her hands and knees as she had climbed a ladder . But whatever they have been accustomed to before , they can never live the same again after having been here . The one-roomed cabin is said to be the curse of the Negro , but the white man built it for him and it remains for him to give him a desire for something better . The Negro is essentially religious but he fails to connect religion and morals . When you call upon one of the old aunties , she talks about getting religion and what a glorious thing it is , and describes visions of heaven and hell to you in the most vivid language : but that does n't prevent her drinking whiskey or telling lies . I have no doubt , however , that some of the most egregious sins of these old slaves are less in the eyes of God than many of our smaller ones . The students here carry on two literary societies and four religious organizations , besides several little missionary societies ; the King 's Daughters , the King 's Sons , Young Men 's Christian Association , and a society called the Covenanters . The latter , however , have no meeting outside of the regular Wednesday evening prayer-meeting , to which they come prepared to take a part . This makes our Wednesday evening meetings very interesting . It might not be a bad plan to have a body of Covenanters in some of our Northern churches . The students work hard here . There are only a very few who have money enough to pay their expenses . They begin school at seven in the morning and finish at half past three . They work from that time until supper and have study hours in the evening in the school-room , so that they have absolutely no time for recreation , and Saturdays they work all day . Many of them teach all summer after having been in school all the year . It is really wonderful the way many of them do and it is a great pleasure to teach them . Within the last two months we have commenced work among the churches within four or five miles of here . Many of our older students make excellent helpers and are so glad to go and teach in the Sunday-schools and help their ignorant brethren in any way they can . I have never heard one of our students express a desire to leave the South for anything more than to complete his education . The most of them are planning to work among their own people , teaching and carrying on trades in a way that will be an example to the rest . Pres . Woodworth has a class composed of the pastors of the neighboring churches , who meet him twice a week . Most of them can scarcely read a chapter intelligently . Pres . Woodworth has taken up the Gospel of Mark with them and is explaining it to them and showing them how to preach from it , and they seem very appreciative , and say it is strange how long they have misunderstood things . Considering the various opportunities for work in the school and surrounding country , one could not ask for a more satisfactory field than Tougaloo . CONGREGATIONAL CHURCHES IN CHARLESTON , S. C . By Superintendent R. C . Hitchcock Of much interest to me is the “ Circular Church ” in Charleston . As early as 1690 a wooden building was erected on the site now occupied by the Circular church , the street being named “ Meeting Street ” and the building known as the “ White Meeting . ” Its members were Scotch Independents and Presbyterians , with a considerable element of Huguenots from France . For one hundred fourteen years this house was used as a place of worship , for the first forty of which the two bodies maintained a union , after that two churches were formed , the Independents or Congregationalists retaining the house . In 1731 the Presbyterians erected a wooden building on the east side of the same street , many of the Scotch going with this body . During the Revolutionary war , while the city was held by the British , the church was used as a storehouse and its interior shared the fate of the Boston “ Old South . ” Its congregation was composed of both white and colored members , but only “ freemen ” could vote in meeting . The Civil War with its results , effected a separation of the white and colored members , the white people rebuilding their lecture-room , the colored worshiping in various places until 1867 , when a letter was sent the old church by a number of the former members , requesting an honorable dismissal . This was granted and one hundred eight colored people presented themselves for membership in a church contemplating organization , as a Congregational church , to be called PLYMOUTH CHURCH . This organization was consummated April 14 , 1867 , under the auspices of the American Missionary Association . And in 1872 a suitable edifice was erected on Pitt Street at a cost of $ 5 , 000 . The present pastor , Rev . Geo . C. Rowe , is much beloved by his people . A tasteful parsonage is being erected on the church lot . It was greatly needed . Plymouth Church is reaching out in schools and missions among the colored people with earnest efficiency . BUREAU OF WOMAN 'S WORK . Miss D. E . Emerson , Secretary OUR HOSPITAL AT FORT YATES , N. D . By The Physician in Charge , Cynthia E. Pingree , M. D . I am sure that all will be glad to hear a word about the hospital for Indians , especially as there is nothing but good news to tell . This hospital has now been built about two years . It will seem very small when I tell you that it has but two wards , containing three cots each , a bath-room , dispensary , reception room , doctor 's and nurse 's room and dining room ; and yet when the patient comes to us , he feels that we have not only every convenience , but a great many luxuries , and from this little Woasui Tipi or House of Healing , goes out many a ray to gladden the hearts of those whom we to-day are trying to bring from darkness into light . But little has been done for these people when ill , except conjuring , which is synonymous with torturing , but these “ medicine men ” are losing their hold upon the faith of those who at one time , and that not long past , trusted them fully , and the more intelligent ones gladly avail themselves of treatment . And no class of people needs it more , the filthy manner in which they live causing much sickness . It has been a great surprise to me as well as to them , to see how much simple cleanliness will do in very many of these cases . The old rule , “ remove the cause , the disease is removed , ” holds true in these cases . It is encouraging to see how soon some of these come to see the great importance of this . I have in mind now a bright little boy nine years old , who was brought to me wrapped in filthy old rags , unable to take one step on account of terrible sores , which had received no attention whatever . The mother 's heart was very sad as she told me this was the only boy she had , five having died . All the while I was attending to the little fellow the mother carefully watched . She was given all that was necessary to use for two weeks and when they returned , at the end of that time , it was very evident that the boy had received good care . The mother cared for him almost entirely after this , and in two months he came running across the prairie , his braided hair just flying , asking for a piece of bread . While the child was not cured , he had been made comfortable , the parents ’ hearts had been lightened of a great sorrow , and they had learned more than one lesson in thus caring for their child . This is only one of many cases . Until they feel their illness is well-nigh fatal they prefer the tent to the hospital , and even then a great many wish to die out of doors . So that often the family come with the ill one and camp just outside the yard . The hospital wards bring comfort to two classes principally ; the more civilized Indian , who realizes the great benefit derived from good nursing , and those friendless ones who are brought because they are too much trouble elsewhere . Both of these classes are very grateful for all they receive . The dispensary is open all the time and a great many are provided with medicine .

We would suggest to all ladies connected with the auxiliaries of State Missionary Unions , that funds for the American Missionary Association be sent to us through the treasurers of the Union . Care , however , should be taken to designate the money as for the American Missionary Association , since undesignated funds will not reach us . LETTERS TO THE TREASURER . “ In sending my last subscription to the American Missionary Association I supposed it to be my last . But the dear Master has not only spared me hitherto , but he has given me the privilege of sending to the Society another token of my continued love . You will find draft for $ 1 , 000 enclosed . I am unable to write more . The Lord abundantly bless and prosper this beloved Society in its noble work . ” A friend in Vermont sends $ 2 and would gladly give more but has invested about $ 1 , 000 in Iowa lots and stock “ from which I hoped to get some profitable honest gain . It has only yielded disappointment . I still pray the Lord to bless your work — a sure investment — and to help me to become a better helper in the good work . ” A friend in Ohio , with $ 20 , says : “ I have read the minutes , papers and addresses of your last meeting with thrilling interest . I hope they may be widely circulated and thoughtfully and generally read . Our Annual Report is now ready for distribution . Those who wish it will please send us a postal card requesting it .
