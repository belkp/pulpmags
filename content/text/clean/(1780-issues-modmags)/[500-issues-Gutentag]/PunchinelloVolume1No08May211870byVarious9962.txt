Teacher . “ BY THE BY , DEAR , CAN YOU LEND ME A COUPLE OF SMALL PUPILS FOR ANNIVERSARY , MY CLASS IS SO LITTLE ? YOU SHALL HAVE THEM BACK AGAIN NEXT SUNDAY . ” THE GREAT CANAL ENTERPRISE . [ FROM OUR SPECIAL BOSTON CORRESPONDENT .] BOSTON , May 8th , 1870 . We Bostonians are greatly surprised that your valuable journal has as yet taken no notice of the great undertaking of the century — the Cape Cod Canal . However , you New-Yorkers are quite out of the world , and unless you read the Boston Transcript regularly , can not be expected to know much about the enterprises with which the earnest men of the nation are occupied . The great Cape Cod Canal is , however , not meant simply for the benefit of the Bostonian nation , but for the commerce of the civilized world . It is destined to work a more important revolution in the trade of Plymouth , Barnstable , and Nantucket , than the Suez or Darien Canals . Of course you are familiar with the peculiar conformation of Cape Cod . It juts out into the Atlantic like an immense elbow , and , indeed , is understood to be modelled after the brawny arm of the gallant CHARLES SUMNER . Vessels passing between ports on the western and those on the southern coast of Massachusetts , are now obliged to make a wide detour in order to circumnavigate the Cape . It is now proposed to cut a canal across the Cape just where it juts out from the mainland , and thus avoid the tedious circumnavigation . The enormous importance of this work will be at once perceived . The Canal will be nearly four miles in length , and will be made of a uniform width of four feet , with a depth of two . This gigantic undertaking will of course cost an immense amount of time and money , but under the able supervision of ELKANAH HOPKINS , the gifted engineer who constructed the board-walk in front of Deacon BREWSTER 'S house , at Standish Four Corners , there can be no doubt of its success . Advantage will be taken of the duck-pond of Captain JEHOIAKIM BROWN , which is situated in the course of the proposed canal . By leading the Canal directly through this pond , at least a quarter of a mile of excavation will be avoided . M. DE LESSEPS is known to have decided upon making a similar use of the Bitter Lakes in the construction of his Suez ditch , after having seen ELKANAH HOPKINS ’ plans for our great Cape Cod Canal . Vessels will hereafter pass through this Canal instead of taking the long voyage around the Cape ; and it is believed that the saving which will be effected in the transportation of cod-fish and garden-sass by the consequent shortening of the voyage , will be something enormous . There are those who believe that the Canal will yield a yearly revenue of from eighty to ninety dollars in tolls alone . It is understood that the European Governments have already proposed to the Mayors of Boston and Barnstable to guarantee the neutrality of the Canal in case of war ; but it is not possible that the proposition will be acceded to . Bostonians should have the exclusive control of this magnificent work , and the Selectmen of several of our prominent towns have drawn up petitions against the proposition of neutrality . The opening of the Canal will be the most splendid pageant of modern times . Mrs. JULIA WARD HOWE will recite an original poem on the occasion ; Mr W. H. MURRAY will preach a sermon ; Mrs. STOWE will read a new paper on BYRON , and the State authorities will proclaim a solemn day of fasting and festivity . A procession of ten fishing-schooners , headed by a flat-boat , containing the Mayors and Selectmen of all the Massachusetts towns , will pass through the Canal . After this , literary exercises are ended ; and the following month will be devoted to the delivery of an oration by Hon . CHARLES SUMNER , on “ The Classical Ditches of Ancient Times , and their Influence on the Cause of Truth and Freedom . ” You , and the minor New-York papers , expect to devote most of your space to this wonderful undertaking . It is more important than any event which has taken place since the election of Mr. SUMNER to the Senate . It is a subject which will interest all your earnest readers , who will be greatly obliged to me for calling your attention to it . A FRIEND OF FREEDOM . OLD SAWS RE-SET . That must be a pernicious agitation of the circumambient atmosphere , which conduces not to the benefit of any individual . The common table utensil which is too frequently conveyed to the fountain , to obtain the thirst-slaking beverage , will ultimately become fractured . By devoting our attention chiefly to the smaller copper coin , the larger denominations represented by paper currency will require no surveillance . Persons who inhabit residences composed of a brittle , transparent , silicious material , should refrain from forcibly casting fragments of granite , etc . When the optic image of a given object is not projected upon the retina of the visual medium , that object fails to be desired by the chief vital organ of the human anatomy . When the vigilant feline quadruped , frequently observed in the abodes of man , is absent , the common domestic animal of the genus mus may indulge in various relaxations of an entertaining nature . Common Pleas . Pleas of Temporary Insanity . A Standard Work . J. RUSSEL YOUNG 'S new paper . Drugs in the Market . An English chemist has discovered a process by which wood of any kind can be dyed a beautiful and permanent violet hue . Should that chemist fail to succeed in his profession , he might profitably turn his attention to writing for the stage , seeing that he has a decided turn for Dye-a-Log . THE PLAYS AND SHOWS . Legs have heretofore been inseparable in the public mind from LYDIA THOMPSON . Her successes have varied inversely as the length of her trunk-hose . She has built up her reputation by “ break-downs , ” and has clutched the burlesque diadem with , innumerable bounds of her elastic legs . Now , however , she has grown weary of offering up her fatted calves at the shrine of a prodigal New-York audience , and desires to hide the lightness of her legs under a bustle and crinoline . Wherefore she exchanges her PIPPIN for a MOSQUITO , and appears in serious instead of comic burlesque . Mosquito is a play written expressly for Miss THOMPSON , by DUMAS pere . There is the more reason to believe this assertion , inasmuch as DUMAS , or somebody else , has already written it expressly for a variety of other people . It was written for MENKEN , under the title of “ The Pirates of the Savannah , ” some six years since , and was written for somebody else and played at the Porte St. Martin about seventeen years ago . We should not be surprised if the “ Veteran Observer ” of the Times were prepared to prove that it was written expressly for him about the year 1775 . In view of these facts , no one will regard it as improbable that it was also written for Miss THOMPSON . Be that as it may , however , there is no doubt that Miss THOMPSON appeared in it on Monday evening last , and that the following synopsis is much more accurate than even the play itself . After an overture , performed principally on an exasperating drum , the curtain rises on a scene in a seaport town in South America , or , to be exact , in Bolivia . Various disreputable pirates , whose appearance is a libel on a profession adorned by such men as Captain EYRE and the managers of cheap American republishing houses , conspire together in such mysterious words as these : Valderrama ( a pirate chief .) “ To-night we must — ” Pierre ( a comic pirate .) “ We will , or — ” Val ., etc . “ You have your —? ” Pierre . “ I have ; and — ” Both Together . “ S-s-s-s-h . Some one comes . Swear to — ” Enter LYDIA THOMPSON , clothed on with crinoline . ( To various pirates .) “ Well ! How 's things ? Are you still the —? ” Various Pirates . “ We are ; and if — ” Enter BRENTANO , the father of LYDIA . He addresses her in tender accents . “ Me cheyild , the hour is come . I must away . ( To Valderrama .) Shall we —? ” Val ., etc . “ We shall . Come , my friend , and — ” They come . Scene changes to a lonely glen . Comic Pirate explains to LYDIA the secret of her birth in terms which leave it more unintelligible than ever . Various pirates conspire to murder BRENTANO . Scene again changes to BRENTANO 'S garden . Various pirates enter and shoot the old man . Applause . Somebody sets the house on fire . Enter LYDIA disguised in boy 's clothes . She vows eternal fidelity to VALDERRAMA The audience wildly welcome her familiar legs , and the curtain falls amid tempestuous applause and the frantic beating of the fiendish drum . Rather Dull Old Gentleman . “ I can n't make out what it 's all about . Why does she want to follow VALDERRAMA when she knows he has killed her father ? ” Theatrical Person , who has seen the manuscript play . “ Do n't you see ? She means to avenge herself by reading the Nation to him , or by singing Shoo-fly . She 'll make his life a burden . ” Dull Old Gentleman . “ Oh ! I see . But will she turn pirate , too ? ” Theatrical Person . “ By no means . There were no strong-minded women on the Spanish main . The pirates were bad enough , but they did n't have all the vices of the present day . She 'll go to Paris with VALDERRAMA , and he will take the title of MARQUIS of FONSECA , and live sumptuously on old BRENTANO 'S money . Just you wait and see . ” Curtain rises on second act , showing the Hotel Fonseca , at Paris . Several French noblemen repeat ponderous witticisms to one another . Enter Miss MARKHAM with clothes on . She represents the icy DIANA DE MAULEON . Diana . “ Mon Doo ! there is my lover LEON DE BEAULIEU . I wo n't have him , for he ai n't rich enough . ” Leon . “ Mademosel ! I love you . ” Diana . “ Mosshure , what 's your name ? who are your parents ? and what 's your income ? ” Leon . “ Alas ! I have none . ” Diana . “ Then leave . Ah ! Good evening , Mosshure , the MARQUIS DE FONSECA . ” Fonseca ( aside .) “ LEON is the son of somebody , I forget who . Never mind , I 'll murder him and marry DIANA . ” Mosquito ( in other words , Lydia Thompson in a dress that shows her legs .) “ I love LEON . I must save him . I will save him . ” Scene changes to an inn on the coast within a few yards of Paris . Enter PIERRE and other pirates . They conspire to murder LEON and the French language . Enter MOSQUITO disguised as a serving maid . She dances , sings , and overhears the plot . Enter LEON in order to be murdered . By a neat little stratagem MOSQUITO contrives to have the pirates shoot each other , and saves LEON . Curtain falls , followed by more maddening performances on the drum . Dull Old Gentleman . “ I begin to see into it a little ; but who is LEON , and why does FONSECA want to murder him ? ” Theatrical Person . “ Well , I can n't just now remember . It is all cleared up in the last scene , though . You see , MOSQUITO is the daughter of BRENTANO , who was killed . She has another father who comes on later . Somebody else is LEON 'S father , and you see FONSECA is the brother — no , the aunt of PIERRE — no , that 's not it precisely — but you 'll see . ” Dull Old Gentleman ( doubtfully .) “ I hope so ; but that infernal drum makes such a noise that I can hardly think . Who is that tall , awkward woman with the turned-up nose , who plays ‘ DIANA ? ’ ” Theatrical Person . “ Hush , GRANT WHITE is sitting right behind you . That is Miss MARKHAM , and she is considered to be very handsome . She is a little awkward in clothes , but she 'll get used to them in time . ” The third act begins . Every body , from the Comic Pirate down to a Dramatic Writer who is in the play , go to a ball at the Palace Gardens . MOSQUITO , disguised as a Gipsy , dances and tells cheerful fortunes . Fonseca proposes for DIANA 'S hand and roars the subject over in a private conversation with her father , while he and the old gentleman stand on opposite sides of the garden . Every body quarrels with every body else . The Comic Pirate challenges LEON to fight a duel , intending to murder him . MOSQUITO , backed by the REGENT of ORLEANS and the entire court , stops the duel and denounces FONSECA . The latter tries to murder her and is shot by the Comic Pirate . Then explanations take place , by which every body is proved to be the father or daughter of every body else , and the play is ended by an appropriate suggestion from the REGENT , that the entire party should engage in a congratulatory dance . Dull Old Gentleman . “ Well , I must say I do n't understand any thing about it . I can n't even make out the different actors . Who is the rather pretty , fat woman , dressed like a boy . She do n't act a bit , but she dances nicely . ” Theatrical Person . “ Why , that is LYDIA THOMPSON . The play was written for her , you know . ” Dull Old Gentleman ( evidently getting irritable .) “ All I 've got to say is this , that I do n't know which is the worse , she or the play . What is the stage coming to ? In my day we used to have something like acting at the old Park . Ah , there was PLACIDE , and ELLEN TREE , and — ” The old gentleman goes slowly out , muttering reminiscences from ancient history . A tall , intellectual-looking man is seen to withdraw into the grass-plat in the court-yard , and is there heard to appeal to the chimney-pots and stars to note the surpassing beauty of the vocal velvet of the fair MARKHAM . And the undersigned wends his way homeward with the conviction that Hamlet , with the part of HAMLET omitted , would be intelligible and attractive in comparison with LYDIA THOMPSON and PAULINE MARKHAM with their legs banished from public view . MATADOR . PUNCHINELLO IN WALL STREET . The great art of Doing others as they would like to Do you has always commended itself to PUNCHINELLO as a very happy rendering of a certain fusty old rule which , in its original shape , did very well some nineteen hundred years ago , but is altogether out of date in these brisk times . Hence the gambols of the merry bulls in that Broad Street which leadeth to DIVES palace are just now highly entertaining . In that illustrious quarter of this amazing metropolis there is a beautiful game going on which is vastly more interesting to watch than to join in , and this little game is much as follows : A number of the members of that worthy family of undoubted ancestry and opulence , and known the world over as the “ Cliques , ” have gone into the dairy business . The cheese-presses are kept and the churning is done in the big offices by the wayside ; but the milking is carried on in a very Long Room , found , from considerable experience , to be peculiarly adapted to this profitable line of trade . Now in the pastoral realms of Finance , it is an odd fact that not only is the milk all cream , and golden cream into the bargain , but it is sometimes hard to tell which are the dairy-maids and which are the kindly animals with the crumpled horns which furnish the lacteal supply which is so particularly sought after . Of course every body wants as much cream as possible , and all have faith that , at the nick of time , it will be given to them to milk instead of the other thing . There is a pleasant amusement known among juveniles as “ SIMON says up , ” etc . This is the very milk in the stock-market cocoanut . When some great member of the big Clique family cries “ DANIEL says up , ” and every body shouts by mistake “ DANIEL says down , ” then the Long Room does a very huge business indeed , and the number of cheeses made is marvellous to relate . When , on the contrary , Clique says “ down , ” and the crowd cries “ up , ” and it really should be up , then the great Clique discover that their dairy-maids have become the other thing , and that all the cheese is going the other side of the way . This is exceedingly damaging to the Clique firm ; and as it is very painful indeed to be the other thing , since it makes sore heads and brings on a tendency to “ bust , ” requiring much careful nursing to recover from the effect , the Clique family is always careful to arrange every thing in a manner that shall best insure the monopoly of the lacteal element to itself . At present the Cliques have made , most excellent provisions . It is a rule that nothing so stimulates the production of cream in the financial pastures as that curious esculent the greenback . Oddly enough , also , although this esculent la greatly sought after by the other useful animals in Uncle SAM 'S plantation , yet , from one and another cause , vast quantities of this exhilarating food have been amassed in and around the banks of Wall street — those banks where the woodbine vainly twineth , and by whoso side our allegory unhappily lies . With plenty of greenbacks , therefore , to make every one gay and festive , with the pumps hard at work to keep the stocks well watered , and with all sorts of devices to lead the Street family ( and a very low but ambitious and prolific family it is ) to cry “ up ” when DANIEL says “ down , ” the jubilant Cliques have set their mind upon a thriving Spring business . PUNCHINELLO gazes down upon the game with equal and serene mind . Since all wish to milk and not to be the other thing , and as it is not clear which is going to be which , he is content to watch the cheeses as they come from the press , and to declare that they at least are seemly and good to behold . If PUNCHINELLO could only believe that the Street family was likely to succeed , he would certainly doff his cap to them . Success is beautiful . It is to Do others as they would Do you . That is the Nineteenth Century . It is , therefore , sublime . One gets exhausted in hurrahing for the Cliques . They are always getting the best of it . But the Street people need encouragement . It is not pleasant to be the other thing . And if the bloated Clique party are not some time brought to a turn , the day will come when we shall find all Clique and no cheese — a consummation devoutly not to be wished for ! “ Too Much for Good Nature , ” The acting at Wood 's Museum .

[ BY ATLANTIC CABLE .] GREAT BRITAIN . Having a peculiar privilege as the correspondent of PUNCHINELLO , I was on the floor of the House of Commons when Mr. GLADSTONE made his short speech , on the 25th , about England and possessions . I was standing by the O'DONOHUE when the Minister said , “ A free and voluntary contract is the only basis for continued union . ” I whispered to O'DONOHUE — Good for Ireland ! He did me the honor to repeat it aloud ; but the Minister 's answer was not heard . Mr. EASTWICK had just been making a speech about “ tightening colonial relations . ” The Press Ass made this charge somebody or other with “ making tight the Colonel 's relations . ” It was just like that fellow . I only succeeded by chance in saving him from sending across some stuff about the Cardinal Archbishop of CRANBERRY , instead of CHAMBERY . I got a dispatch from , him quoting the Virago of Paris — meaning the Figaro , of course . And then that Schema ; a Sphinx could not have made it more of a puzzle , whether he meant that the bishops voted that the Pope should be deified , or defied , or that the de fide should pass by their vote . CYRUS W. FIELD has been here , in communication with AIRY , the astronomer Royal , about a telegraph to the moon . A lunatic observation makes it wax plain that it will not be in wane to attempt it . STOKES and HUGGINS , moreover , have been taking views of people through the spectroscope . Absorption bands are very striking in the spectra of the ROTHSCHILDS and other bankers . Bright lines are seen in TENNYSON and WILLIAM MORRIS ; dark lines in SWINBURNE . Gaseous substances are shown to exist in certain bodies and people ; a great deal of gas was discovered in VICTOR HUGO . Traces of iron are visible in NAPOLEON III ; and still more , at the last observations , n BISMARCK . VICTOR EMMANUEL had more of the phosphorus ; the Pope , of sulphur ; the PRINCE of WALES , of mercury ; the editor of the Times , of lead . GARIBALDI and MAZZINI have a carbon-ari appearance through the instrument ; with some look of nitrous incandescence , also . Laughing-gas is evidently abundant in PUNCH . The Lords of the Admiralty have observed that Mr. HALE has proposed in Congress a 16 million bill for a new American navy . It will be at once proposed to the House of Commons that 32 millions be spent in iron-clads here . And the Cabinet of the French Emperor have already prepared their little bill , demanding of the Corps Legislatif a sum of sixty-four millions for monster ships . All this is , of course , encouraging . Mr. HALE had better try again , Of course you have heard of the great Fenian raid , which really is to come off . You know there are immense amounts of vegetables and other provender brought to London from the Continent every day . Now a large number of sworn Fenians are to go to Holland and learn Dutch , so that they can go over disguised as petty dealers in food , get to London armed with revolvers , and carry off the Queen ! As the Fenians always do exactly what they promise to do , this may be relied upon as certain to happen . It is said that the Queen is studying Dutch as an amusement ; which may be very convenient on the way ; she can expostulate with them better in Dutch than in Irish . From GERMANY , we learn that JANAUSCHEK is coming to London to play in English . Also that a ballet corps is coming over to dance in Spanish , and an opera troupe , to sing phonographically , in Hindoostanee . A new opera , by BALFE , is spoken of ; subject , the Tower of Babel . This was suggested by the Ecumenical Council ; where some body must have been LISET-ening . A World 's Congress of Croquet Players will be held next month at Baden . They will not hold their debates in Latin . Among the points discussed will be , whether it is allowable to pop the question on the croquet ground . Old maids are quoted as thinking that it distracts the game . Younger ones would consider it allowable in certain cases . What people some travelling Americans are ! There is one nouveau riche from New-York , who has been going about all over Germany , asking every body for the sculptor — he thinks his name was METTERNICH — whose most famous work was the Status quo ! He wants one of these , he says , for his jardin des plantes ; which is going to be as big as the one near Paris . He has also heard of the Marquis of BUTE ; and wants to buy one or two of his things ; because somebody once read to him , out of a copy-book , that “ a thing of Bute is a joy forever . ” I have not time to tell you , today , about my late interview with the Pope . — PRIME EVERY MAN HIS OWN POLICEMAN .

Upon opening our mail , the other morning , a communication signed “ Tragedian , ” purporting to come from the father of three boys , ( each remarkable in his way ,) particularly attracted our attention . He stated with peculiar succinctness some singular developments of genius in the second of these prodigies , which do not always accompany such tender adolescence . “ But twelve years old ! ” exclaims the enraptured parent , “ and yet my FRITZ has produced a tragedy in three acts , entitled ‘ The Drewid 's Curse . ’ No less a judge than our leading town lawyer , squire MANGLES , was so kind as to say that such an instance of the histrionic flux in a child of FRITZ 'S years , was utterly unparalleled . If PUNCHINELLO could find space for a few specimens of the ‘ Curse , ’ they shall be cheerfully furnished . ” ( It might as well be stated here that curses of this character are already quite abundant , and that PUNCHINELLO can not find space for any of them . Still a kind word may not be misunderstood .) To the son of a man who spells “ Druid ” with a “ w , ” all things must be possible , from a hangman 's noose to a Presidential nomination , and the danger to be apprehended in this case is , that some of “ Tragedian 's ” posterity may slip into one or the other of them . A parental raid upon all the pens , ink and paper that could possibly come within the reach of a youth whose soul revels in Druidical reminiscences , is the only effective remedy which at present occurs to us . The “ histrionic flux ” is a kindred disease , and would , of course , be susceptible of the same treatment . DEAR PUNCHINELLO : I am not mad , but to you , alone , I confide the secret of my sanity . Nevertheless I thirst for blood . Feelings over which I have no control , render it imperative that I should shoot somebody . Precisely who may be the victim of this insatiable desire , fate alone can decide . I propose some day next week to commence a general fusilade from the windows of my office upon the passers-by . My sole security in this affair , is a maiden aunt now in the Lunatic Asylum . I look with confidence to her malady as my triumphant vindication . My object in writing to you is to ask whether , in your opinion , the fact is sufficient to guarantee a verdict of “ Not Guilty , ” in case I am prosecuted for murder , or whether an unscrupulous jury could sacrifice me to the unsettled condition of the popular mind on the subject of justifiable insanity . Yours sanguinarily , — RABIES . PUNCHINELLO expresses his opinion in reference to the above letter with great reluctance . He fears that if he gives his advice according to his real convictions , he may be overrun with similar applications , and if he gives advice that he does n't feel , he will condemn “ RABIES ” to the mortification of the gallows . He therefore takes a middle course , and observes that the possession of an aunt in the Lunatic Asylum is certainly strong presumptive evidence that her nephew is no better than she is . Here in New-York , it would be difficult to upset such evidence , but elsewhere the result might be different . “ RABIES ” gives no clue to his whereabouts . PUNCHINELLO , therefore , presumes that he does not contemplate murder here . Very well , then , it would be unadvisable to kill any one , until at least two respectable physicians could testify that either before or after the act they had called upon “ RABIES , ” fully interviewed him on the subject of the maiden aunt , and found that the slightest allusion to her was productive of any of the following phenomena : 1st . Sudden and violent twitching of the eyes . 2d . Discoloration of the veins of the nose , resulting in an appearance abnormally rubicund . 3d . Manifestations of extravagant thirst , which water could not satisfy . 4th . Tendency to reach for his boot-straps , as if with the view of lifting himself by the same . 5th . Rapid rise of the pulse from 50 to 500 — say within the space of ten seconds . 6th . Shoo-fly ! movement of the hand toward the cheek as if some thing had alighted there , and patient were trying to rub it off . 7th . The presence of a cicatrix on the left temple ( This is a most irrefutable proof of insanity ) . 8th . Psychological developments indicative of “ moral alienation . ” 9th . Gangrenous condition of the tongue , proceeding from a disordered liver , and mysteriously communicated to the brain . 10th . Any symptoms going to show that patient might mistake another man 's wife for his own . 11th . Discovery at the last moment that patient 's father suffered himself to be hung for murder . PUNCHINELLO offers these as the accepted data by which RABIES may measure his chances for life in case he executes his avowed purpose , but I would impress upon him the fact that these are necessary outside of New-York only . Here proof of the lunacy of the maiden aunt would be sufficient . UNCLE SAMUEL To His Lit-tle Lads in Con-gress . [ A LESSON IN EASY WORDS OF ONE SYLLABLE .] My lads ! I will be plain with , you : I am not pleased with all you do . I hate to scold , and yet I must ; And you will take it well , I trust . When first I saw you , nice and clean , It was a sight to show the Queen ! I was an ass to like you so ; But where we wish to like , we do . I should have known it could not be ; For luck , of late , is gone from me . No more I see the good old times When fools were fools , and crimes were crimes , And boys and men had work to do , And did not play till work was through . The times have changed ; so have the boys ! I know this , when I hear your noise , And note your slack work , day by day ; Each lad must have his own small way , If it is but to loaf and loll , Or else , not to come in at all , Or not to care for what is done If so be it can yield no fun , Or else , to be as coarse and rough , As rash and rude , and grum and gruff , As though it were some bear that spoke , Whom all the world must long to choke . For shame , my lads ! I let you draw All I can spare to you by law ; Each lad of you takes all he can , But not a soul acts like a man ! What do you do , for such fine pay ? What have you done these five months ? Say ! You know you ought to do some good ; The friends that sent you , think you should . Have you no pride , no sense ! In fine , Why do you waste their time and mine ? If it could move you , I 'd tell how The boys that sat where you sit now Once earned their pay , and got the name Of fine , brave lads ! But you !— for shame ! Boys , I could thrash you all , I fear ! It may be , times will change , this year — Your friends all tire of you , I know , And what , if they should let you go ! The school , through you , has such a name All good men feel a kind of shame ; They feel the world must laugh , at last — The world that could not scorn the past ! Oh , think of that , my lads ! I see You do not mean to turn from me . From me , your best of friends ? Oh , no ! I may seem grave , and dull , and slow . But you and I , my lads , are one ! Your fame , your blame , I can not shun . Much have I borne for you , of late ; But you are small , and I am great ! A Reflection for Recorder Hackett . The GRAHAM bread bakers are useful members of the community , but the same can not be said of GRAHAM bred lawyers . CRITICAL INTELLIGENCE .

Dedicated with sentiments of the most inexpressible respect to the Members of the Forty-First Congress . I . Oh ! who , for any payment auriferous or argent , Would undertake to do the work that Mr. Speaker does — With nobody to help him except the trembling Sergeant , While still begin and never end the shout and scream and buzz ? Oh , never any where , save in desert groves Brazilian , Was ever heard such endless and aimless gabble yet . For there the tribes of monkeys to the number of a million , Screech and chatter without ceasing , from the sunrise to the set . Rap ! rap ! rap ! To quell the rising clamor ; Order ! order ! order ! Hammer ! hammer ! hammer ! II . O strength of tongue how awful ! O power of lungs how mighty ! Whence draw ye , honest gentlemen , your constant wind supply ? Whence comes your inspiration , belligerent or flighty ? Your common-place that grovels and your metaphors so high ? Pray , why not try , for novelty , a kind of solo speaking ? One man upon his legs — only one upon the floor ? For eloquence ,' tis possible , does not consist in shrieking , And really where 's the argument in all this thundering roar ? Rap ! rap ! rap ! To quell the rising clamor ; Order ! order ! order ! Hammer ! hammer ! hammer ! III . The country listens sadly to the racket most distressing , And wonders , in its bother , if e'er the time will come When the Fates and Constitution will vouchsafe to us the blessing Of a House of Representatives completely deaf and dumb ; Or if , perhaps , in exile these noisy mischief-makers , The stream of elocution run most fortunately dry , In seats of legislation , rows of ruminating Quakers May shake their heads for “ Nay ” and may nod their heads for “ Aye . ” Rap ! rap ! rap ! To quell the rising clamor ; Order ! order ! order ! Hammer ! hammer ! hammer ! IV . But if these mighty nuisances we cannot stop or flee ‘ em , If past all other remedy the sounding evil reaches , Oh , why not send for GILMORE of the Boston Coliseum , That he may drill the Members in a chorus to make speeches ? Then shall stop the fierce rencontre — shall cease the idle rating ; Then debates shall he no longer without a head or tail ; And while the power of song every soul is demonstrating , Each member cherubimical will scorn to rant or rail . Rap ! rap ! rap ! To quell the rising clamor ; Order ! order ! order ! Hammer ! hammer ! hammer ! V . But if for solo speaking Members still feel an avidity ; If they burn to make orations of most uncommon zest , Let them just take our precaution against intense stupidity ! Let them study PUNCHINELLO and learn how to make a jest ; But away with dreams chimerical and projects vain , though clever ! The power of tongue 's proportionate to wondrous length of ear ; The beast that carried BALAAM is as garrulous as ever , And still the lobby listener must be content to hear Rap ! rap ! rap ! To quell the rising clamor ; Order ! order ! order ! Hammer ! hammer ! hammer ! BARNACLES ON OUR COMMERCE . Intelligent Foreigner . “ WHY ARE ALL THESES AMERICAN SHIPS LYING IDLE IN THEIR DOCKS , SIR , INSTEAD OF EARNING MONEY AT SEA ? ” Despondent Ship-owner . “ IT 'S ALL THE BARNACLES , SIR . NO SHIP CAN SAIL WITH THEM ON , AND WE DON'T KNOW HOW WE 'RE GOING TO GET THEM OFF . ” ] CONDENSED CONGRESS . SENATE . Just as usual , WILSON had another little scheme on hand . There was no money in it — nothing but a little Massachusetts glory . It was to set apart a day to decorate the graves of the Union dead . Mr. WILSON remembered that it would have been more consonant to his own feelings to confine the ornamentations to the graves of colored men and the men of Massachusetts . But for the sake of peace and harmony he was willing to decorate all round . Mr. GARRETT DAVIS suggested that it did n't make any difference whether they set apart a day or not . If people wished to decorate , they would decorate , and if they did n't , they would n't . Mr. DRAKE said Mr. DAVIS 'S hands were dripping with loyal gore . Mr. DAVIS said he would reply to that insinuation the first leisure week he had . In the meantime he contented himself with hurling the foul slander back into Mr. DRAKE 'S teeth , if Mr. DRAKE had any . Lest Mr. DAVIS should execute his threat of making a speech , the Senate referred the subject . Then there was a first-class wrangle about giving pensions to Mrs. LINCOLN and Mrs. RAWLINGS . It was represented that Mrs. LINCOLN was given up to riotous living upon pumpernickel and ganzebroost , at a German watering-place , and that there was a rumor afloat that unless Congress pensioned her at once , she might marry a German prince . Mr. SHERMAN , on behalf of the Finance Committee , represented that German princes were notoriously expensive and impecunious , and that it would be much cheaper to pension Mrs. LINCOLN alone than to pension her and a German prince together . He submitted some statements , showing what it had cost Great Britain to have German princes marrying into the Royal family . The Senate , therefore , incontinently passed the bill . Mr. Morrill introduced a neat little swindle , which does equal credit to his hand and heart , providing that the United States should have the free use of all patents granted under it . He said this was to discourage that pernicious class of men , the inventors . In many branches of industry , such as arms , the Government was the only customer of the inventor . In those cases , the inventor 's gray hairs would be brought immediately to the grave . And inasmuch as the Government had a finger in almost every body 's pie , the future FULTONS and GOODYEARS would starve to death before the completion of their diabolical devices . Some land-grabs were rushed through , when Mr. SAULSBURY objected . He said nobody made any thing out of this except the Western Senators . He called upon the men of the Eastern States to stand up for their share . He had a little game in the interest of his own constituents . It was no chimerical railway . It was a good , substantial , practical concern . He demanded six million acres in behalf of the Delaware Balloon Navigation Company . If this demand were not complied with , it would show that the Senate were actuated by the basest personal motives . HOUSE . The gentle JULIAN insisted upon proposing his sixteenth or seventeenth amendment . He said that he understood several women intended to vote , and he introduced this to preserve his domestic peace . Mr. JENCKES , for the forty-fifth time , called up his Civil Service bill . Mr. BUTLER , for the thirty-seventh time , introduced a bill to annex San Domingo . Mr. KELLEY and Mr. SCHENCK raved a neat but not new duett , “ Give us Tariff or give us Death . ” Mr. LOGAN gave a fine rendering of his famous bass solo , “ The Tariff be Hanged . ” Mr. SCHENCK intimated that Mr. LOGAN was an insect . At first he said he was a pismire , but the Speaker said pismire was not parliamentary , and he modified it to grasshopper . Mr. KELLEY said that he took his stand upon American pig-iron , for which our fathers fought and bled . Did they never hear of Valley Forge ? Our fathers suffered in that forge for the sake of protecting their children in the right to smelt in other forges . He said that the man who could smelt two pigs of iron where only one was smelted before , was a public benefactor . Mr. COX said he could not smelt a pig , but he thought he smelt a rat . Mr. JENCKES said he thought his Civil Service bill would tend to diminish stealing . Mr. PETERS said he would oppose it for that very reason . He wished to reward his friends . It was no reward for a man who stood by his country in her hour of peril , to be given an office in which he had to work for a living . What patriot would not be disgusted by the ingratitude of a country which dared to insult him like that ? There was nothing in this bill to prevent a man dripping with loyal gore from holding office , if he was honest and intelligent ; whereas , one of his , Mr. PETERS 'S staunchest supporters might be refused an office , if he had the misfortune to be dishonest and dull . The notion of making “ capacity and integrity ” a qualification for office-holding was unprecedented , and was preposterous . If things went on in this way , even members of Congress would be compelled to do something for their pay . Now he preferred to administer the public service on the good old principle they all had practised , of “ You tickle me and I 'll tickle you . ” NOTES FROM CHICAGO . The Garden City seems to be in a quiescent state at present . There is no startling divorce case on the topis , and the main portion of the Court House has not yet fallen in , and Mr. H .' s wife has not recently surprised him in any well-matured plan for putting a quietus upon her existence . Domestic felicity is unusually prevalent . The scarlet-fever and measles have prevailed to a somewhat alarming extent ; but the most contagious of all has been the French fever . This malady seems to have spread amongst all classes ; the fashionable and the unfashionable , the strong-minded and the frivolous . French teachers swarm like bees , here , there , and every where , and all speaking the purest Parisian French ; even Mons . L'HARMONIQUE , who comes from that wee little town in Canada , where the Canucks “ most do congregate . ” But he says “ the Americans do love so much humbug , ” that he gives them their fill of that article . We have had French parties , French plays , French lectures . We read French , speak French , sing French , and look French ; and , if you are so barbarously ignorant as not to understand that language , why , you might just as well retire for an old fossil or petrifaction . You 're obsolete , that 's all ; as much behind the times as RIP VAN WINKLE himself , after his memorable sleep . English is out of date here — a relic of the Dark Ages . Fashionable ladies return from Paris , bringing with them accomplished bonnes , and every one is prohibited from speaking a word of English to the children ; but , in spite of every precaution , the vulgar little creatures will drop the musical foreign tongue , and speak their own native language . They are christened ADELE , MARIE , or CLAIRE ; the SUSANS , MARYS , and ELLENS having ceased to exist . Parisian fashions , of course , reign triumphant , and the pretty young girls in French frizzes and furbelows , shrug their fair white shoulders exactly as they see “ that elegant Madame DE —— ” do , and gesticulate with what they imagine to be the true French grace and vivacity . They all have a charming young teacher , with whom they carry on a most romantic flirtation , that of course means nothing ; and each one of these fair students , ( who conscientiously puts a “ g ” to every termination possible , and who says monseer ,) will tell you , with a complacent smile , that Professor —— considers her pronunciation unusually excellent . They are all studying in the blissful anticipation of a trip to Paris , where they will be presented to the Empress in yellow satin gowns , and then , when they return , how eagerly will they be sought by the fashionable young snobs , who long will see upon their fair brows the reflection of imperial glory . That is , if the dark-eyed ROMEOS abroad allow them ever to return to their native country . MR. GLAUBER , DRUGGIST , WHO HAS HAD A DISPUTE WITH HIS SIGN-PAINTER , IS NOT AWARE THAT THE LATTER HAD COME IN THE NIGHT , AND TRANSPOSED THE LETTERING OF HIS NEW SIGN-BOARD . THIS ACCOUNTS FOR THE COMPLACENCY OF MR. G ., AS HE VIEWS THE CROWDS OF PEOPLE OVER THE WAY WHO STOP TO GAZE AT IT . COMIC ZOOLOGY , Order-Reptilia . SPECIES-BULLFROG . Although the batrachian is of the genus bufo , he is by no means a buffo genius . He may be styled the solemn organist of the swamp ; slough music being his specialty . Like other out-door performers on wind instruments , he is chiefly heard in pleasant weather , and during the summer his organ is without stops . Being a Democrat , he appreciates the dignity of labor , and consequently is not ashamed to blow his own bellows . Winter shuts the bull-frog up like a four-bladed jack-knife , and he does not open until the blades are started by the Spring . He seldom leaves his mud bivouac for active service before April , but a Forward March sometimes induces him to move earlier . As a rule , however , the smaller varieties of the species begin to ply their bog-pipes some weeks before he volunteers a voluntary . Originally , this member of the Frog family had no surname , but about two thousand years ago , in consequence of his disastrous failure in an attempt to rival a male animal of the bovine species , the prefix “ bull ” was incorporated with his patronymic by a crooked little Greek . The name , however , more appropriately belongs to the Horned Frog of Sumatra . The habits of the Bull-Frog are believed by observant naturalists to be strictly temperate , although there is a rumor afloat that he has been seen Over the Bay in New-Jersey . It is suspected , however , that the originators of the story were persons who visited that State to avoid the restrictions of the Sunday liquor-law , and consequently saw as through a glass darkly . Be that as it may , it is certain that this species of reptiles ( unlike the “ paragon of animals , ” ) is never too drunk to navigate . Mankind is deeply indebted to the Bull-Frog . We should never have known how to keep our heads above water but for their example , and , though Mr. CHASE may not be aware of the fact , their greenbacks were the first that ever issued from the Banks of America . Naturally , therefore , they are in advance of SALMON , and , long before he put our currency on its present footing , the hinder limb of a bull-frog was a legal tender . The frog exists in most parts of the world , and at one time all the varieties of the species were Plaguily abundant in Egypt . They were introduced there to punish the people for their rascality , and appeared in such numbers among the Egyptian blacklegs that they stopped the game of PHARAOH . There is nothing poetic in the aspect of the frog . It is simply a tenaqueous bag of wind , yet it has occasionally given an impulse to the divine afflatus . We have it on the authority of the celebrated traveller Count SMORLTORK that the distinguished Mrs. LEO HUNTER , once wrote an “ Ode to a Perspiring Frog . ” The costume of a Bull-Frog consists of a green coat with yellow vest and brownish breeches , and when he requires a change of uniform , he pulls off the old one and swallows it . This fact has been doubted ; but why should It be deemed incredible ? Are there not parallel cases in the human family ? GOLDSMITH tells us that he once lived for a fortnight on his coat and waistcoat ; and every pawnbroker knows that a cast-off suit often furnishes the material for a family dinner . Why should not a frog sustain life with his Pants as well as a Christian ? Common brown frogs are good baits for FISH in most of the counties in this State ; but when you go to HAMILTON try the greenbacks . The unlicked cubs of the batrachian family are known ( irrespective of sex ) as Pollywogs , and are the meanest of all the reptile race except the radical Scaliwags . They are all heads and tails , and then , not the toss of a copper to choose between the two ends , as regards hideousness . The manner in which the tails are gradually developed into legs is very curious , but , as this is not a Caudal lecture , it is unnecessary to describe the process . It has been metrically stated that the fast young batrachian goes a wooing in an Opera hat , irrespective of his mother 's consent , but this assertion is not borne out by BUFFON or CUVIER , and maybe set down as a lapsus lyrea . Upon the whole the Bull-Frog , though harmless as a lamb , is nearly as stupid as a donkey , which accounts for his taking up his abode among Morasses , when he might dwell in the woods with the turtle and “ feel like a bird . ” Furthermore , and finally , the subject is a slippery one and difficult to handle , and , therefore , with this remark we drop it . A Clerical Error . A PRESBYTERIAN clergyman , the Rev . CHARLES B. SMYTHE , has been scandalizing a community in New-Jersey by putting gin in his milk , and that on a Sunday afternoon . From the rebuke administered to Rev . SMYTHE by the authorities of his church , it appears that his case must have been a very aggravated one . They admonished him to “ walk more correctly in future ; ” the inference to be drawn from which is that the amount of milk-punch , outside of which Rev . SMYTHE had placed himself , was sufficient to impart a stagger to his gait . Right to a T . The employment of Chinese laborers to build railroads is very suggestive of a well-known product of the Celestial Empire , since railroad tracks are usually laid with T rails . “ What 's in a Name ? ” Letters of the Alphabet .

From our special correspondent if Washington we have received the following Special Order of the Navy Department , directing United States men-of-war how to approach and leave Yokohama : SPECIAL ORDER NO . 999 . In consequence of the late disaster to the U. S. sloop Oneida , the following rules are hereby published for the guidance of vessels of war approaching the Bay of Yokohama : I . On making the land , or if at night , on striking the soundings , all hands will be called to prayers . II . After prayers all boats will be lowered and towed astern , to be out of the way of damage . III . The gunner , under direction of the executive officer , will dismount all guns , and strike them into the hold . The reasons for this action will be at once apparent to commanders of vessels , when they reflect that , in case of collision , the guns would be useless as signals , owing to the extraordinary deafness of the officers belonging to the Peninsular and Oriental Mail Steamship Company ; and a reference to the details of the Oneida 's disaster will show the danger of the guns breaking loose and destroying human life . They will , therefore , be at once stowed in the hold . IV . On entering the bay , the helm must be kept amidships . The rule of the road , according to English interpretation , is so difficult of comprehension that the above is by far the safest plan . V. Each officer and man will be directed to secure upon his person such valuables belonging to him as he can conveniently carry . VI . Finally , it shall be the duty of the commander to see that all hands are provided with life-preservers . VII . The same rules will apply to vessels leaving Yokohama and proceeding to sea . VIII . Having taken the above precautions , vessels may stand boldly into the bay , and in case they are run into and sunk by any other vessel ( say for example one of the Peninsular and Oriental Company 's ships ) their officers and men will stand some little chance of saving their lives . But should all precautions fail , the gallant crew will be no doubt greatly consoled , as they sink to their graves , by the reflection that a pious Congress will pass resolutions of sympathy for their widows and orphans . A PLEA FOR PROTECTION . MR. PUNCHINELLO : I like your paper , though it is altogether too light and trifling in its treatment of serious subjects . Besides , it never treats of any thing serious . This wo n't do . The earnest men and women of the nation require something better at your hands . I have an essay on the “ Origin of Evil , ” which I forward to you by this mail , and which , when published , will give an entirely different character to your journal . I want you , moreover , to advocate our American doctrine of Protection . Even our ablest statesmen , KELLEY , GREELEY , and DANIEL PRATT , have never carried this doctrine far enough . They are willing to protect American iron-masters by prohibiting the introduction of foreign iron , but why do n't they protect American laborers by forbidding foreign workmen to land on our shores ? I demand protection for the native ditcher . Forbid the Irishmen to land here and to lower the price of labor by competing with our own ditch-diggers . Put a stop to the influx of German tailors and bootmakers , who prevent native artists from earning the wages that would otherwise be theirs . Protect our authors by prohibiting the sale of works written by foreigners . Keep all foreign pictures out of the country , and give our own POWELLS and ROSSITERS a chance . And , above all , protect our American girls by preventing any pretty English , French , or German girls from coming in competition with them . These foreign girls bring their pretty faces here and glut the matrimonial market . The fewer the marriageable girls , the higher their market value . We protect iron-workers , and decline to protect our own daughters . This is an outrage . Shall we prevent the railroad companies from laying rails made of foreign iron , and permit husbands to marry foreign wives ? Every patriotic and protectionist instinct revolts against it . I want you to take this matter up . Let us have no more foreign manufactures , foreign iron , foreign books , foreign laborers , or foreign girls . This is the true American system , and I look to you to aid in carrying it out . MOTHER CAREY . PUNCHINELLO IS SORRY . Alas ! it is with tears in his eyes , albeit unaccustomed to such humor , that PUNCHINELLO condoles with the ladies of Massachusetts on the defeat of the proposition to endow them with the right of suffrage . The Puritan Patriots in the State Legislature , who unanimously recognize the “ inborn right ” of the black field-hands of South Carolina and Georgia to make laws for the white women of the Republic , have scornfully denied , by a vote of 133 to 68 , that the white women aforesaid have any political rights at all ; thus officially proclaiming to the world that they consider their wives , their daughters , and the mothers that bore them , inferior to the ignorant male African ; unworthy to vote with him at the polls or to sit with him in council . PUNCHINELLO is aware that the ladies of Massachusetts had set their hearts upon rising to the negro level “ before the law , ” and can therefore appreciate their disappointment ; but they ought to have known that neither the ties of nature , the bonds of wedlock , nor the claims of intelligence , are of any force in the Home of the Pilgrims , as compared with the influence of the Ebony Lords of Creation , whoso reign as sovereigns commenced with the ratification of the Fifteenth Amendment . The STANTONS , the BLACKWELLS , and the ANTHONYS , the Members of the Women 's Parliament and the Sisters of Sorosis , advocated negro suffrage with the full expectation of sharing the franchise with PETE and CUFF ; but alas ! while these wool-dyed Africans are conducted in triumph to the ballot-box , they are ignominiously thrust back from it . For this black wrong there is no colorable pretext . There is not a shade of excuse for it , and PUNCHINELLO hopes that it will open the eyes of the ladies of the land , and prevent them henceforth and for ever from placing the slightest confidence in the gallantry or impartiality of the Puritanic prigs of New-England .

Father , do n't you mean the Great Object they expected to have in view , when they got it made ; a Distant World , for instance ? F. Pshaw , child ! be serious . Do n't spoil a good thing by untimely interjections . They are as mal a propos as a mosquito coming across the Field of View . D. I 'd rather he 'd do that than come across me ! F. Well , HELENE , you are positively exasperating ! D. Not more so than your mosquito . F. Well , I declare — this is too bad ! D. So is his bite ! F. Well , well ; I must walk out and take the air . [ Going ] D. Yes , pa , ( and see that you do n't take anything else !) Now , then ! for a grand look for my Charmer ! Really , I am getting quite Earthly ! [ Looks through the instrument a few moments ] Why , what is this ? Oh , pshaw ! I see ! I 've got JUPITER by mistake ! I mistook one of his Belts for a new Belt Railroad . It would have been a Big Thing , that railroad ; not less than 75 , 000 miles long , as I figure it . Perhaps those Belts are Railroads ! Perhaps they have Rings there , as they have at Saturn , only less conspicuous . JUPITER is rather a Slushy planet , if I am correct in regard to its Specific Gravity ; of about the consistency , perhaps , of the New-York Poultice Pavement I 've been reading about . I should think that JUPITER 'S lack of gravity and consistency would make him a favorite with Aldermen — not the less for having so many Satellites . I wonder if the New Charter is the celebrated Magna Charter under a new name ? Probably it is no better . Oh , dear ! the annoyance of living so far away ! Nothing here attracts me . The distant , the unattainable , is all I think or care about ! F. [ Coming in quietly .] What 's that , HELENE , about the charms of the Unattainable ? You do n't seem to see any thing very attractive in MERCURY or MARS ! D. Well , some things may be both unattainable and undesirable . That 's the case with the little thieving god MERCURY , and that big red-skinned Prize-Fighter , MARS . I can n't understand , however , why these disreputable deities should he worshipped in your favorite New-York . F. Well , as near as I can see , ( a matter of a few million miles , more or less ,) when you speak of Worship , they have more regard there for Millinery than any thing else . The Christian Religion is based on Humility , which has Purity and Simplicity for her Handmaids . Look into some of these New-York churches ! see how the jewels glisten , the rich stuffs fall gracefully in massive folds . Observe the sumptuousness , the elaborate display ! A fine Humility this ! Then look at the ceremonial . Here is a church edifice , belonging to a denomination that assumes to be Decent and Orderly in ceremony . Is it so in this church ? What means all this tawdriness of color , the crimson , the blue , the gold ; what signify these fantastic designs and figures , these monkey-like genuflexions ; this wilderness of sign and symbol , this elaborate abasement , this theatrical show of exaltation ? This an improvement on the old dignified simplicity ? Do you tell me that childishness , and prettiness , and pettiness , are valid substitutes for a genuine , manly modesty and simplicity ? D. ( Oh , dear ! he 's been drinking again ! How bitter the Bitters do make him !) Look ! Father , come , quick ! Here is a Railroad Accident , such as you have often wished to see . Two trains have collided , and both have rolled down an embankment at least seventy feet high ! into a river , I do declare ! They are all lost ! F. Do let me see at once , HELENE I [ Looks eagerly .] Ah , yes ; all gone ; nothing visible but one smoke-pipe , three stove-pipe hats , four bits of orange-peel , some pea-nut shells , and thirteen copies of the New-York Ledger . Sad fate ! But see ! Some dry-goods-no , a young lady flounders along toward the shore ! The bystanders rush up ; she is nearly exhausted ; pants rapidly ; they congratulate her . A well-dressed young man approaches . She instantly begins to think of her looks ; her hand flies to her back hair . Heavens ! there is so much gone there that she shrieks in alarm ! Her fall in the water has detached her Waterfall ! That gone , every thing is gone ! She springs to her feet ! Glancing hurriedly over the watery waste , now plentifully strewn with fans , little canes , and certain objects which are either mail-bags or chignons , she descries her better part , and with a wild cry , ( as when a mother rescues her babe from tigers ,) dashes in and seizes the darling object ! She presses it to her lips , and impetuously breaks for the shore ! Alas ! too late , by about ten and a half seconds ! “ Save it ! ” she seems to cry ; tosses the wad ashore , and down she goes , with her hand on the back of her head , her last thoughts , evidently , more or less , connected with that sympathizing young man on the bank above . D. Father , you talk like a brute ! Have you no feeling ? Boo-hoo hoo-hoo ! F. Child , I am all feeling . Boo-hoo-hoo-too ! HORTICULTURAL HINTS . KITCHEN GARDEN .— Plant pickles early , if you are up in time ; if not , later . But do n't eat them late , unless you are equally fond of dyspepsia . In planting peas , select that kind that does not grow hard and yellow ; that is , unless you supply boarding-houses , or have a government contract for the supply of shot . Grated turnips , mixed with horse-radish , for the table , will assuage one 's grief for one 's grandmother . Rice-puddings can be grown , ready-made , by sowing rice with cowcumbers . Try it . NURSERY .— Transplant from hot-beds to bath-tub as soon as possible , using sponge with palm-soap and cold water . Top-dress with comb and brush . Trim limbs according to age . Train with rods . Much depends on starting right , so start to school right after breakfast . +———————————————————————————————+ | | | A , T.
