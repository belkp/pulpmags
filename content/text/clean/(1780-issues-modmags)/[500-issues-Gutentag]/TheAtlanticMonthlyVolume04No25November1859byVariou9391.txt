THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY . A MAGAZINE OF LITERATURE , ART , AND POLITICS . VOL . IV .— NOVEMBER , 1859 .— NO . XXV . E. FELICE FORESTI . Late in the autumn of 1836 , an Austrian brig-of-war cast anchor in the harbor of New York ; and seldom have voyagers disembarked with such exhilarating emotions as thrilled the hearts of some of the passengers who then and there exchanged ship for shore . Yet their delight was not the joy of reunion with home and friends , nor the cheerful expectancy of the adventurous upon reaching a long-sought land of promise , nor the fresh sensation of the inexperienced when first beholding a new country ; it was the relief of enfranchised men , the rapture of devotees of freedom , loosened from a thrall , escaped from surveillance , and breathing , after years of captivity , the air where liberty is law , and self-government the basis of civic life . These were exiles ; but the bitterness of that lot was forgotten , at the moment , in the proud consciousness of having incurred it through allegiance to freedom , and being destined to endure it in a consecrated asylum . In that air , when first respired , on that soil , when first trod , they were unconscious of the lot of strangers : for there the vigilant eye of despotism ceased to watch their steps ; prudence checked no more the expression of honest thought or high aspiration ; manhood resumed its erect port , mind its spontaneous vigor ; nor did many moments pass ere friendly hands were extended , and kindly voices heard , and domestic retreats thrown open . Their welfare had been commended to generous hearts ; and the simple facts of their previous history won them respectful sympathy and cordial greeting . Prominent amid the excited group was a tall , well-knit figure , whose high , square brow , benign smile , and frank earnestness bespoke a man of moral energy , vigorous intellect , and warm , candid , tender soul . Traces of suffering , of thought , of stern purpose were , indeed , apparent ; but with and above them , the ingenuousness and the glow of a brave and ardent man . This was ELEUTARIO FELICE FORESTI ,— subsequently , and for years , the favorite professor of his beautiful native language and literature in New York ,— the favorite guest and the cherished friend in her most cultivated homes and among her best citizens ,— the Italian patriot , which title he vindicated by consistency , self-respect , and the most genial qualities . The vocation he adopted , because of its availability , only served to make apparent comprehensive endowments and an independent spirit ; the lady with whom he read Tasso , beside the chivalrous music of the “ Jerusalem Delivered , ” learned to appreciate modern knighthood ; and the scholar to whom he expounded Dante , from the political chart of the Middle Ages , turned to an incarnation of existent patriotism . Not only by the arguments of Gioberti , the graphic pictures of Manzoni , and the terse pathos of Leopardi , did he illustrate what Italy boasts of later genius ; but through his own eloquent integrity and magnetic love of her achievements and faith in her destiny . The savings of years of patient toil were sacrificed to the subsistence of his poor countrymen who came hither after bravely fighting at Rome , Venice , Milan , and Novara , to have their fruits of victory treacherously gathered by aliens . Infirmity , consequent upon early privation and the unhealed wounds of long-worn chains , laid the stalwart frame of the brave and generous exile on a bed of pain . He uttered no complaint , and whispered not of the fear which no courage can quell in high natures , that of losing “ the glorious privilege of being independent ": yet his American friends must have surmised the truth ; for , one day , he received a letter stating that a sum , fully adequate for two years ’ support , remained to his credit on the books of a merchant ,— one of those mysterious provisions , such as once redeemed a note of Henry Clay 's , and of which no explanation can be given , except that “ it is a way they have ” among the merchant princes of New York . By a providential coincidence , surgical skill , at this juncture , essentially improved his physical condition ; but it became indispensable , at the same time , that he should exchange our rigorous clime for one more congenial ; and he sailed five years ago for Italy , taking up his residence in Piedmont , where dwell so many of the eminent adherents of the cause he loved , and where the institutions , polity , and social life include so many elements of progress and of faith . It was now that those who knew him best , including some of the leading citizens of his adopted city , applied to the Executive for his appointment as United States Consul at Genoa . There was a singular propriety in the request . Having passed and honored the ordeal of American citizenship , and being then a popular resident of the city which gave birth to the discoverer of this continent ,— familiar with our institutions , and endeared to so many of the wise and brave in America and Italy ,— illustrious through suffering , a veteran disciple and martyr of freedom ,— he was eminently a representative man , whom freemen should delight to honor ; and while it then gratified our sense of the appropriate that this distinction and resource should cheer his declining years , we are impelled , now that death has canonized misfortune and integrity , to avail ourselves of the occasion to rehearse the incidents and revive the lessons of his life . [ 1 ] It is to be lamented that Foresti had not anticipated our purpose with that consecutive detail possible only in an autobiography . “ Le Scene del Carcere Duro in Austria , ” writes the Marquis Pallavicino , “ non sono ancora la storia del Ventuno . Un uomo potrebbe scriverla e svelare molte infamie tuttavia occulte del governo Austriaco . Quest ’ uomo è Felice Foresti . Il quale abbandon ò gli agi Americani per combattere un ’ altra volta , guerriero canuto , le gloriose battaglie dell ’ Italico risorgimento . Il martire scriva : e la sua penna , come quella d ’ un altro martire ,— Silvio Pellico ,— sar à una spada nel cuoro dell ’ Austria . ” — Notes to Spielbergo e Gradisca . Underlying the external apathy and apparently frivolous life of the Italian peninsula , there has ever been a resolute , clear , earnest patriotism , fed in the scholar by memories of past glory , in the peasant by intense local attachment , and kindled from time to time in all by the reaction of gross wrongs and moral privations . Sometimes in conversation , oftener in secret musing , now in the eloquent outburst of the composer , and now in the adjuration of the poet or the vow of the revolutionist , this latent spirit has found expression . Again and again , spasmodic and abortive é meutes , the calm protest of a D'Azeglio and the fanaticism of an Orsini , sacrifices of property , freedom , and life ,— all the more pathetic , because to human vision useless ,— have made known to the oppressor the writhings of the oppressed , and to the world the arbitrary rule which conceals injustice by imposing silence . The indirect , but most emphatic utterance of this deep , latent self-respect of the nation we find in Alfieri , whose stern muse revived the terse energy of Dante ; and in our own day , this identical inspiration fired the melancholy verse of Leopardi , the letters of Foscolo , the novels of Guerrazzi , and the tender melody of Bellini . Recent literature has exhibited the conditions under which Italian Liberals strive , and the method of expiating their self-devotion . The novels of Ruffini , the letters of the Countess d'Ossoli , the rhetoric of Gavazzi , and the parliamentary reports of Gladstone , the leading reviews , the daily journals , intercourse with political refugees , and the personal observations of travel , have , more or less definitely , caused the problem called the “ Italian Question ” to come nearer to our sympathies than any other European exigency apart from practical interests . Moreover , the complicated and dubious aspect of the subject , viewed by transatlantic eyes , has , within the last ten years , been in a great measure dispelled by experimental facts . That Italy needs chiefly to be let alone , to achieve independence and realize a noble development , civic , economical , and social , every intelligent traveller who crosses the Austrian frontier and enters the Sardinian state , knows . A greater contrast , as regards productive industry , intellectual enterprise , religious progress , comfort , and happiness , no adjacent countries ever exhibited ; constitutional freedom , an unrestricted press , toleration , and public education on the one hand , and foreign bayonets , espionage , and priestcraft on the other , explain the anomaly . In Venice the very trophies of national life are labelled in a foreign tongue , the caff è s of Milan resound with Teutonic gutturals , and under the arcades of Bologna every other face wears the yellow beard of the North ; yet the family portraits in the vast palace-chambers , the eyes and dialect of the people , the monumental inscriptions , announce an indigenous and superseded race ; their industry , civil rights , property , and free expression in art , literature , and even speech , being forcibly and systematically repressed : while in the mountains of Savoy , the streets of Turin , and the harbor of Genoa , the stir and zest , the productiveness , and the felicity of national life greet the senses and gladden the soul . Statistics evidence what observation hints ; Cavour wins the respect of Europe ; D'Azeglio illustrates the inspiration which liberty yields to genius ; journalism ventilates political rancor ; debate neutralizes aggressive prejudice ; physical resources become available ; talent finds scope , character self-assertion ; Protestantism builds altars , patriotism shrines ; and genuine Italian nationality has a vital existence so palpably reproachful of circumjacent stagnation , ruin , and wrong , that no laws or material force can interpose a permanent obstacle to its indefinite extension and salutary reign . In his first youth , Foresti imbibed the creative spirit breathed into the social and civic life of Italy by Napoleon 's victories and administration ; it was at that vivid epoch when the military , political , artistic , and literary talent of the land , so long repressed and thwarted by superstition and despotism , broke forth , that his studies were achieved . We have only to compare what was done , thought , and felt in the Peninsula , during the ten years between the coronation of Bonaparte at Milan and his overthrow at Waterloo , with the subsequent dearth of national triumphs in every sphere , and with the inert , apprehensive , baffled existence of the Italians in the grasp of reinstated and reinforced imbecile , yet tyrannic governments , to appreciate the feelings of a young , well-born , gifted citizen , when suddenly checked in a liberal and progressive career , and remanded , as it were , from the bracing atmosphere of modern civilization and enlightened activity , to the passive , silent endurance of obsolete feudalism . It was the inevitable and deliberate protest against this wicked and absurd reaction which gave birth to the political organization of the Carbonari ; wherein the noblest men and the wisest princes of that day enrolled themselves ; and the inefficiency of whose far-reaching , secret , and solemn aims can be accounted for only by the fatal error of trusting in the magnanimity of an order born to hereditary power , and overlooking , in their municipal fraternities , the vast importance of the more scattered , but not less capable and patriotic agricultural class . Foresti was born at Conselice in the Ferrarese . Few American travellers linger in Ferrara . Fresh from the more imposing attractions of Florence or Venice , this ancient Italian city offers little in comparison to detain the eager pilgrim ; and yet to one cognizant of its history and alive to imaginative associations , this neglect might increase the charm of a brief sojourn . It is pleasant to explore the less hackneyed stories of history and tradition , to enjoy an isolated scene fraught with grand or tender sentiment , to turn aside from the trampled highway and the crowded resort , to listen to some plaintive whisper from the Past amid the deserted memorials of its glory and grief . Such a place is Ferrara . The broad and regular streets and the massive palaces emphatically declare its former splendor ; and its actual decadence is no less manifest in the grass-grown pavement of the one and the crumbling and dreary aspect of the other . It requires no small effort of fancy , as we walk through some deserted by-way , wherein our footsteps echo audibly at noonday , to realize that this was the splendid arena where the House of Este so long held sway , limited in extent , but in its palmy days the centre of a brilliant court , a famous school of pictorial art , the seat of a university whose fame drew scholars from distant Britain , and whose ducal family gave birth to the Brunswick dynasty , whence descended the royalty of England . The city dates its origin from the fifth century , when its marshy site gave refuge from the pursuing Huns , and the ambition of its rulers gradually concentrated around the unpromising domain those elements of ecclesiastical prestige , knightly valor , artistic and literary resources which enriched and signalized the Italian cities of the Middle Ages . Enlightened , though capricious patronage made this halting-place between Bologna and Venice , Padua and Rome , the nucleus of talent , enterprise , and diplomacy , the fruits whereof are permanent . But there are two hallowed associations which in a remarkable degree consecrated Ferrara and endeared her to the memory of later generations : she gave an asylum to the persecuted Christian Reformers , and was the home and haunt of poets . It is this recollection which stays the feet and warms the heart of the transatlantic visitor , as he roams at twilight around the venerable castle “ flanked with towers , ” traces the dim fresco in a church Giotto decorated , reads “ Parisina ” in Byron 's paraphrase near the dungeons where she and her lover were slain , or gazes with mingled curiosity and love on the chirography of St. Chrysostom , the original manuscripts of Tasso , Ariosto , and Guarini , or the inscription of Victor Alfieri in the Studio Publico . It is because Calvin was here sheltered , and Olympia Morata found sympathy and respect ,— because the author of “ Jerusalem Delivered ” here loved , triumphed , and despaired , and the author of the “ Orlando Furioso ” so assiduously labored for his orphaned family , the exacting Cardinal Ippolito , and the cause of learning , and strung a lyre which has for centuries vibrated in the popular heart and fancy ,— because , in a word , Ferrara contains the prison of Tasso , and the home of Ariosto , who called her “ citt à bene avventurosa , ” as did Tassoni the “ gran donna del Po , ” — that the desolate old city is revived to the imagination , with its hundred thousand people , its gay courtiers and brave knights , the romance of its feats of minstrelsy and arms whereat noble beauties and immortal bards assisted , and Art , Chivalry , Learning , Church , and State held festival with the Muses to adorn and perpetuate the transient pageant , the loveliness , and the rule ,— otherwise since consigned to the monotonous record of vanished pomp and arbitrary sway . When Napoleon fell , Foresti was a student at the University of Bologna , whence he returned to his native capital , after obtaining the degree of Doctor of Laws . His earliest forensic labors , like those of our young advocates , were in the defence of accused criminals ; and , limited as is this sphere , he must have displayed unusual maturity of judgment and natural eloquence , to have received successively the eminent appointments of Provisory Assistant Judge in the Court of Justice of Ferrara , Supplementary Professor of Eloquence and Belles Lettres in the Lyceum , and Judge of the Peace , by virtue of which latter office he crossed the Po to practise at Polesino ,— wisely preferring the Austrian to the Papal jurisdiction . In Crespino , in the province of Rovigo , in the Lombardo-Venetian Kingdom , Foresti was made Praetor under the Emperor 's warrant . Coincident with this recognition of his judicial knowledge and skill , was a kindred appreciation on the part of his liberal and patriotic countrymen ; they beheld in the vigorous and disciplined mind and generous heart of Foresti , in his civic wisdom and courage , the representative and ally they sought in this portion of their beautiful and unhappy land . To disseminate the principles and secure the cooperation of Venice became the special office of the Carbonari leaders of Ferrara , and they had only to reveal the high and holy object they cherished , to one who so well knew the wants and woes of his country as Foresti , to enlist his adventurous sympathy . The delicate and difficult mission , fraught with the dearest prospects of Italy , was nearly consummated , when a treacherous colleague revealed to the accredited agents both of Austria and the Pope the system of this mysterious revolutionary combination in and around Ferrara . The latter shrank from extreme measures , and was content with an oath of retraction ; but the Austrian government gave instant orders to the chiefs of police , both there and at Venice , to arrest those whom the perjured Count Villa named as adherents of Carbonarism . The decree was executed with military force ; and , without warning , preparation , or even a parting interview with their families and friends , the suspected were hurried off to the Piombi , that Venetian prison so graphically described by Pellico . All correspondence and personal intercourse was denied . Meantime , an ingenious and persevering investigation went on , to ascertain the scope of the enterprise thus summarily baffled , the means proposed , and the individuals implicated . To complicate still further the situation of the victims , in other quarters the flame they had secretly fed burst forth conspicuously ; Naples and Piedmont were in arms ; and Austria conceived an alarming idea of the national spirit she had partially contravened . The rigor of espionage towards the imprisoned and their friends increased ; the prosecution was insidiously prolonged ; privation and solitude , vigilance and suspense were made instruments for subduing the resolution and invading the confidence of the captives ; they pined in desolation , ignorant of their fate , uninformed of the welfare of those most dear to them , without resources of defence or consolation , except what the strength of individual character yields ; physically weakened , morally isolated ; sometimes roused from sleep and bewildered with questions ; at other times told they were to die , that some companion had confessed , or that some loved one had ceased to exist ;— and all these crises of feeling and anxiety , of surprise and despair , induced with a fiendish deliberation , to startle honor into self-betrayal , wring from exhausted Nature what conscious rectitude would not divulge , or agonize human love into inadvertent disloyalty . At length their fate was decided . Foresti 's companion in prison was the son of a judge of Ferrara ; and , one November midnight , their conversation was interrupted by the unexpected entrance of the jailer , who bade Foresti follow him . The hour and the manner of the official convinced both him and his comrade that his sacrifice was resolved upon ; they embraced , and he left the cell to find himself strictly guarded by six soldiers . This nocturnal procession marched silently through the vast , lonely , and magnificent rooms of the Ducal Palace to the door which leads to the Bridge of Sighs : it was the old road to destruction ,— the mysterious process , made familiar by novelists and poets , by which the ancient and sinister republic made more fearful the vengeance of government . As the unfortunate youth passed through a labyrinth of gloomy corridors , he recognized the haunts of the ancient Inquisition ; the atmosphere was clogged with damp ; moisture dripped from the stones . A dungeon , lighted only by a lamp suspended from the vault , and narrow , humid , and unfurnished , except with a pile of straw and a rude table , proved the dreary goal of their heavy steps . Left to his own reflections , Foresti contemplated his prospects with deliberate anguish ; that he had been found guilty was apparent ; if the fact of his direct agency in initiating the oath of self-emancipation , the sacred compact of national self-assertion in the Austrian dominions , had transpired , he felt that his prominence as a judicial officer , and the firmness with which he had refused to explain the purposes or betray the associates of this memorable league , made him the most probable victim of extreme measures , should one be chosen from the Carbonari of Ferrara . At that period of his life he entertained the opinion that suicide was justifiable to avoid an ignominious death at the hands of arbitrary power . Believing his fate sealed , he gave a few moments of tender reminiscence to his dead mother and his living father and sisters , to the dreams of his youth , and the patriotic aspirations to which he was about to fall a sacrifice . The jailer returned , bringing a book and a bottle of wine , for which he had asked ; a few tears were shed , a prayer for forgiveness breathed , and then he plunged a knife into his breast ; the blade broke ; he shattered the bottle at his side and swallowed the fragments , and then fell bleeding and exhausted on the straw . If left long alone , life would have ebbed away ; but , probably in anticipation of such a catastrophe , the officer ere many hours revisited the cell to put chains upon the prisoner . Discovering his condition , a surgeon was called , remedies were applied , and two Austrian sentinels carried Foresti into the presence of the judge . It was scarcely dawn ; the venerable and courteous , but inflexible representative of the Emperor expressed solicitude and sympathy ; a secretary and physician , with the guard and their prisoner , confronted each other by the dim light of two candles . Irritated by the conventional politeness of this arbiter of his destiny at such a crisis , having vainly sought death , and bitterly conscious of the long outrages perpetrated under the name of justice , Foresti burst forth into stern invectives , and boldly declared his liberal sentiments , his allegiance to the principles for the sake of which he thus suffered , and his absolute enmity to the usurpers of his country 's freedom . The Cavalier Mazzetti treated this overflow of emotion as the ebullition of a youthful mind , romantic and intrepid , but unreasonable ; he professed the sincerest pity for so gifted and brave a youth , lamented his delusion , painted in emphatic words his want of gratitude and allegiance , treated his political creed and organization as chimerical , and wound up by informing Foresti that he was condemned to die on the public square of Venice , and that nothing would save him but a complete revelation of the true plan , arrangements , and members of the secret conclave to which he belonged . Threats and blandishments failed to move the prisoner ; he was silent , accepted his doom , and was remanded with two allies ,— one of whom purchased a remission by treason to his vows . Such was the climax of two dreary years of imprisonment , aggravated by ingenious moral torture . If the modern history of liberty is written by a comprehensive humanitarian , he will not look exclusively to the battle-field for picturesque and impressive tableaux ; in that record most signally will it appear that “ the angel of martyrdom is brother to the angel of victory ” ; and among the memorable scenes which an earnest chronicler will delineate with noble pathos , few can exceed in moral interest that which the Piazza of San Marco , at Venice , presented on Christmas Eve , 1821 . There is not a spot in Europe , within the limits of a city , more distinctly remembered by the transatlantic traveller ,— the only spacious area of solid ground under the open sky , in that marvellous old city of the sea ,— the gay centre of a recreative population , where the costumes and physiognomies of the Orient and the West mingle in dramatic contrast ,— the nucleus of historical and romantic associations , singularly domesticated in two hemispheres by the household lore of Shakspeare and Otway , Byron and Rogers , Cooper and Ruskin . The ancient temple of St. Mark , the bronze horses of Lysippus , the arched galleries of the Palace , the waters of the Adriatic , the firmament above , and the stones beneath seem instinct with the fame of commercial grandeur , maritime triumphs , and diplomatic prowess ; the cheerful arcades that shade the caff è s remind us of the “ harmless comedy of life ” which Goldoni recorded ; the flush of sunset on dome , balcony , and canal seems warm with the peerless tints which Titian here caught and transmitted ; the crowd of pleasure-seekers recall the music , love , and chivalry , of which this was once the splendid centre ; while the shadow of a dark fa ç ade whispers of the mysterious oligarchy , the anonymous accusers , the secret council , and the venerable Doge ;— a more remarkable union of gloom and gayety , of romance and reality , of the beautiful and the tragic , directly suggested by inevitable local associations , cannot be found in the whole range of European travel . Imagine this memorable square , on the afternoon of a great Christmas festival ;— fair faces at every window ,— the adjacent roofs crowded with spectators ,— an Austrian regiment drawn up around a scaffold ,— the Viceroy , brother of the Emperor , standing in the large balcony of the Palace ,— two cannon placed between the columns of San Marco and San Teodoro ,— every inch of the vast Piazza , without the circle of soldiery , occupied by eager spectators . Over this vast assemblage , amid the impending thoughts which the incidents of the hour and the memory of the Past inspired , reigned a profound silence ; no laugh or jest , such as bespeaks a holiday , no heartless curiosity , such as accompanies a mere public show , no vulgar excitement was evident ; on many faces dwelt an expression of awe and pity ,— on others an indignant frown ,— on all painful and sympathetic expectancy . Every class was represented , from the swarthy fishermen of the lagoons to the dark-eyed countess of the Palazzo ,— pale students , venerable citizens , the shopkeeper and the marquis , the priest and the advocate . It was not merely the fate of the few prisoners on the scaffold , deep as was the public sympathy , which occasioned this profound suspense ; they represented the national cause , and in every city of the land there were scores of the bravest and the best equally involved in the patriotic sacrifice , and whose destiny had , for long and weary months , agonized their relations , friends , and countrymen . The anomalous tyranny under which the nation had collapsed was demonstrated not so much by the outward aspect as by the moral facts of that fatal day in the Piazza of San Marco . On the scaffold were a group of educated , courageous , honest Italians , guarded by Austrian soldiers and overlooked by the official representative of imperial despotism ; their attitude was criminal , their acts sublime ; ostensibly condemned , they were in reality glorified . Not a being in that vast multitude , except the official creatures of Austria , but gazed with respect , love , sorrow , pride , tenderness , and admiration upon her noble victims ; it was the apparent triumph of physical force , and the actual realization of moral superiority : the silence of that multitude was the eloquent protest of humanity . And this ominous silence was all at once broken by the clear , well-emphasized voice of a judicial officer , reading the sentence ; it was listened to with such breathless attention , that , when the phrase , condemned to death , was uttered , a visible shudder vibrated , like an electric shock , through the dense mass of human beings , and upturned faces flushed or grew pallid in an instant ; but scarcely were these simultaneous emotions recognized , when another phrase , life granted , called forth a cry as of one mighty voice . All were spared : but a sentence , to such as understood its meaning , of living death ,— carcere duro in Spielberg and the Castle of Lubiano ,— some for ten , others for fifteen , and the remainder for twenty years ,— was substituted . This entire ceremony was characteristic of Austrian despotism , aware of the profound sympathy among the Italians for their patriot martyrs , of the widespread disaffection , of the necessity of exciting vague and terrible apprehension ,— and at the same time conscious that policy forbade arousing the fury of despair . The accused were thus kept more than two years alternating from hope to desperation , the people in ignorance of the issue , and then , when led out , as they supposed , to die , they served as a warning to those who dared imperial vengeance , while , by a sudden act of apparent clemency , the government at once rid itself of formidable opponents and assumed the character of merciful executors of law ! It was rumored that the consideration of his youth saved the life of Foresti ;— he was sentenced to twenty years ’ imprisonment . From , the scaffold the prisoners were transferred to the Island of St. Michael . Their transit was more like an ovation than a disgrace . The better class of spectators embarked in gondolas and followed the cort é ge with shouts of encouragement and waving of handkerchiefs ; “ Courage , courage , brave patriots ! ” was their salutation ; and when night fell upon the scene , there rose from the lagoons strains of instrumental and vocal melody , and improvised recitations breathing honor , compassion , and hope ; so that in spite of bayonets and police , terrorism and espionage , the voice of their fettered country wafted to every captive the assurance that he had not striven and been faithful unto death in vain . These scenes in Venice were reenacted , with unimportant modifications , within a few months , at Rome and Turin , at Modena , Parma , and Naples . The rolls of victims embraced the most highly endowed and heroic men of the day . Many of them , after years of incarceration , distinguished themselves in civil and literary life ; some perished miserably in durance ; and a few yet survive and enjoy social consideration or European fame . Among them were representatives of every rank , vocation , and section of the land ,— noblemen , professors , military officers , advocates , physicians , priests , men of wealth , of genius , and of character . Those known in America , either personally or by their writings , are Count Gonfalonieri of Milan , Silvio Pellico , Castilla , Borsieri , Maroncelli , and Foresti . The abortive revolutions of 1831 and 1848 sent other refugees to our shores , and canonized other saintly heroes in the Calendar of Freedom ; but these were the original , and , as a body , the remarkable men , who , imbued with the intelligent and progressive Liberalism of the nineteenth century , practically established in Italy by Napoleon , bravely initiated the vital reaction invoked by humanity as well as patriotism , before which European despotism has never ceased to tremble , and which , however baffled , postponed , and misunderstood , by the law of God as well as the development of man , is absolutely destined to an ultimate triumph . The show of justice and clemency was made at noonday with every circumstance of pomp and authority to give it popular effect ; the trial and punishment were enacted in darkness and isolation . On a cold , still night of January came police commissioners to the island , whither the condemned patriots had been conveyed amid tears and benedictions , and chained them in couples like galley-slaves . By the light of torches they were placed in boats which glided noiselessly by sleeping Venice to Mestre , and there they were transferred to carriages , two prisoners and four guards to each vehicle , and in this manner , for four dreary weeks , borne through the winter days farther and farther from country and home ,— sleeping at night in town-jails , by-way fortresses , or , when neither were available , in the worst apartments of lonely inns . Who can adequately describe the wretchedness of that journey , the bitterness of soul , the prospective desolation , the tender regrets of those unhappy prisoners ,— torn from the embrace of kindred , the dignity and motive of a high career , the most beautiful of countries , and the most sacred of ties and duties , to bury their youth , with all its high dreams and noble fervor and consecrated gifts , in a distant dungeon ? Even the strangers through whose domain they passed testified by looks , signs , respectful greetings , and , when possible , kind attentions , their sympathy and esteem ; people of rank continued to approach them in disguise merely to indicate their humane recognition ; the very commissioners sent to attest the execution of the sentence parted from their charge with tearful respect . Grief , privation , and fatigue , greatly aggravated by the shackles which bound them in pairs , had exhausted body and mind at the end of the journey . From the city of Brunn , the capital of Moravia , their wan looks sought the mountain prison above , where frowned the bastions of Spielberg , once a mediaeval castle , then a fortress , built by the Emperor Charles , and , just before the battle of Austerlitz , dismantled by Napoleon , and now the place of confinement for the most degraded criminals of Austria , nearly a thousand of whom there expiate their offences . Into this herd of malefactors were thrust gentlemen , scholars , citizens , for the crime of patriotism . To each was assigned a cell , twelve feet in length and eight in breadth , with a small iron-barred window , a plank with , a mattress and blanket , an iron chair secured to the wall , and an earthen jug for water . Arrayed in convict uniform , here the brave youths were immured . Sentinels were continually on guard in the corridors and court and around the bastions ; the food was inadequate and often loathsome ; an hour 's walk in the yard daily , between two soldiers with loaded muskets , was the only respite from solitude and inaction ; “ Lives of the Saints ” were the only books allowed ; intercourse with the outward world was entirely cut off ; surveillance was incessant ; on Sunday they were guarded to the chapel , but kept apart ; every quarter appeared a priest , who strove , by rigid examination , to elicit political secrets ; the agents and officials maintained an unmitigated reserve ; what transpired in the world , how it fared with their country and their loved ones , was unknown ; existence so near to death itself , in passivity , “ cold obstruction , ” alienation from all the interests , the hopes , and the very impressions of human life , it is impossible to imagine . Subsequently reforms were introduced , and the rigors of this system somewhat modified ; but the era of Foresti 's confinement at Spielberg was that which has become accursed in political history as the reign of Francesco Primo . He insisted to the last on chains , the badge of crime , and the severest r é gime possible to life . He had even visited Brunn , and been within hearing of his victims , and sent his physician to ascertain their condition ; but refused any mitigation of sufferings , moral and physical , which involved sanity , health , and almost vitality . The details of this experience are familiar through current European memoirs . Silvio Pellico has made the life of an Austrian prisoner-of-state , in its outward environment and inward struggles , as well known as that of the Arctic explorer or the English factory-operative . A confirmatory supplement to this dark chapter in the history of modern civilization has recently appeared from the pen of another of Foresti 's fellow-martyrs , Pallavicino . [ Footnote : Spielbergo e Gradisca : Scene del Carcere Duro di GIORGIO PALLAVICINO . Torino . 1856 .] But while they were undergoing the bitter ordeal , it was all but unknown in Europe and undreamed of in America ; literature , that noble vantage-ground for oppressed humanity , has now broken the silence and proclaimed the truth . There was one solace ingeniously obtained by these buried members of the living human family ,— occasional indirect intercourse with each other : the telegraphs of eye and ear conveyed their mutual feelings . One after another succumbed , from the vital injuries of the r é gime ; in one case the brain grew weak , in another the blood was impoverished or fevered ; this one was prostrated by gangrene in wounds caused by chafing fetters , and that attenuated by insufficient nourishment : yet they contrived to make known to each other how it fared with them respectively . Pellico , through an indulgent guard , sent Foresti verses on his birthday ; Maronchelli sounded on the wall the intimation of his continued existence after his leg was amputated ; and when marshalled for a walk or convened on Sunday in the chapel , the devoted band had the melancholy satisfaction of beholding each other , though the different groups were not permitted to communicate . Andryane , a French officer , included in the original edict , though upon most inadequate evidence , describes , with keen interest , his first impressions when permitted to go to mass at Spielberg . His companion speculated on the identity of each of the captives . “ That one , with dejected looks and hollow eyes , who seems so exhausted , and , though a tall man , is bent down into a dwarf , is Villa . Poor fellow ! he has but a few months to live . As for the last one , with the stern looks and bushy black hair , he appears to bear his fate in such a manner as ought to make us resigned to our own . ” “ That , ” whispered a fellow-prisoner , “ is Foresti , who , like Ajax , doubtless mutters between his teeth , ‘ I will foil them yet , though even the gods oppose me ! ’ ” [ Footnote : “ M é moires d'un Prisonnier d'Etat . ” Par ALEXANDRE ANDRYANE . Paris .] This observation was sagacious . It was by calm resolution and philosophic self-possession , through faith in the ultimate triumph of justice and freedom , that Foresti kept at bay the corrosive despair which irritated less noble characters into melancholy or wasted spirits of gentler mould to insanity . Yet his physical torture was extreme . Of robust frame and in the plenitude of youthful vigor when arrested , the want of food during the earlier years of his captivity made serious and permanent inroads upon a naturally powerful constitution . We have heard him relate , with a humorous emphasis indicative of brave endurance , yet suggestive of the keenest pangs , how eagerly he one day seized a pudding , thrust under his dress , as he passed the lodge of an official in the court , by a compassionate woman ,— how ingeniously he concealed it from the sentinels , at the risk of burning his hands ,— with what triumph he unfolded and with what voracity he devoured it in the solitude of his cell . Sometimes an indignity overcame his self-possession , as , on one occasion , when the jailer 's attendant rudely awoke him with a kick , as he deposited a basin of hot broth , which Foresti indignantly seized and dashed its scalding contents into the face of the brutal menial , who thenceforward was more respectful in his salutations . But it was the moral suffering against which all his wisdom and courage were invoked to struggle ,— the resolute maintenance of healthful mental activity , without an object or motive underived from will ,— the repression of hopeless , vague , self-tormenting reverie , which perverts intellect and drains moral energy ,— the habitual exercise of memory , reflection , and fancy , to preserve their functions unimpaired . Such expedients were of special necessity at Spielberg ; for never were educated men so barbarously deprived of the legitimate resources of mind and heart ; thought and love were left uninvited , unappeased . Sir Walter Raleigh had the materials , at the Tower , to write a history ; Lafayette , at Olmutz , lived in perpetual expectancy of release ; Moore and Byron , children , flowers , birds , and the Muses cheered Leigh Hunt 's year of durance : but in this bleak fortress , innocent and magnanimous men beheld the seasons come and go , night succeed day , and year follow year , with no cognizance of kindred or the world 's doings ,— no works of bard or sage ,— no element of life ,— but a grim , cold , deadly routine within stone walls ,— all tender sympathies , the very breath of the soul , denied ,— all influx of knowledge , the food of the mind , prohibited , experience a blank , existence a void ! Had we need of evidence that conscience is a normal attribute of humanity , that the soul is endowed with relations to the Infinite , we should find it in the self-preservation realized under such circumstances as these . Only conscious rectitude could arm humanity against the sense of degradation and deprivation thus surrounding and pressing upon it for years ,— only the belief in a Power above and beyond human will and perversity ,— only , in a word , the recuperative force of moral individuality and aspiration , could keep intact and uninvaded the integrity of conscious being . Of course , the method thereof depends on character ; a cheerful heart In one , a buoyant imagination in another , and the sweet self-oblivion which Faith imparts in a third , sentiment here and will there , work the same miracle . Foresti belonged to that class of Italians who combine perspicacity and force of reasoning with a frank , affectionate , and trustful disposition ,— types of the manly intellect , the childlike heart ; incarceration , while it failed to enfeeble the former , by seclusion from life 's game and the world 's encroachments from early youth to middle age , perhaps confirmed the latter into the candid and loving nature which endeared him to so many friends in Europe and America . Sterne says , that , if he were in a desert , he would love some cypress ; and Isaac Taylor has observed , that the devout heart can find in a single blade of grass the evidence of a Divine Creator . We have all read of Bruce testing his fate , when a captive , by the gyrations of a spider , of Baron Trenck finding solace in a dungeon in the companionship of a mouse , and the imaginative prisoner of Fenestrelle absorbed in vigilant and even affectionate observation of a little plant ,— its germination , slow approach to maturity , and consummate flowering . But there were alleviating circumstances in the situation of these captives ,— a definite hope of release or a certainty of life-bondage , either of which alternatives is more favorable to tranquillity of soul than absolute suspense ; they enjoyed tidings from without or indulgences within . At Spielberg , the sistema diabolico , as it has been justly called , especially at the epoch of Foresti 's incarceration , retained the galling chain on the limbs , cut off the supply of moral and intellectual vitality , refused appropriate occupation , baffled hope , eclipsed knowledge , and kept up a vile inquisitorial process to goad the crushed heart , sap the heroic will , and stupefy or alienate the mental faculties ; dawn ushered in the twilight of a mausoleum , noon fell dimly on paralyzed manhood , night canopied aggravating dreams . “ To such sad pitch their gathering griefs were wrought , Life seemed not life , save when convulsed by thought . ” Casual evasions of this fiendish torture , through ingenuity or the compassion of officials , are among the few animated episodes of their dreary experiences recorded by the victims . At length the Emperor died ( an event they had surmised from a change in the form of the public prayer ) ; his son Ferdinand succeeded to the throne , and signalized his accession by a decree liberating the Italian patriots , but condemning them to perpetual exile in America . Those long years of such captivity did not even gain them the privilege of again enjoying civil rights , their country , and kindred ! Protests were vain , appeals disregarded . In November , 1835 , their chains were removed ; the same blacksmith who had welded Foresti 's shackles fourteen years before , now severed them , and wept with joy as they fell ! One night they were all summoned to the director 's room , and he , too , announced their enfranchisement with congratulations ; the prison garb was exchanged for citizen 's dress , and they were taken in carriages to the police prison of Brunn , where comfortable apartments , good food , free intercourse , books , and newspapers awaited them . Imagine the vividness of their sensations , the hilarity of feeling inspired by the first sight of scenes and objects associated with their youth ! It was like a new birth . To grasp the hands and hear the voices of their fellow-creatures ,— to behold streets , caff è s , and shops , the tokens of industry , the insignia of life ,— to taste viands unknown for years ,— to see the horizon ,— to feel the breath of heaven ,— to trace once more those charts of living history , the journals , resume acquaintance with favorite authors , converse together , move unchained , think aloud ,— this sudden and entire transition awakened a sensation of almost infantile joy . But privation had too long been their lot to be instantly ignored with impunity ; a reaction followed ; the weakness incident to long confinement , prostrated faculties , and inadequate nourishment brought on illness ; they could not , at once , bear the excitement , digest the food , or sustain the keen pleasure ; and a rigorous climate quelled their sensitive vitality . But universal sympathy now environed them ; their very custodian ministered to their wants ; and the Emperor ordered them to be removed to the Castle of Gradisca , on the confines of Italy , where a milder atmosphere prevailed . How much had occurred while these years of arbitrarily imposed monasticism crept heavily by , to excite the speculative thought and kindle the sympathies of educated men ! To what new aspects of civilization and fresh phases of contemporaneous history their liberation suddenly introduced them ! Their journey from Brunn to Gradisca was a perfect contrast to that melancholy transit , so many years before , from Venice to Spielberg . It was near the beginning of April , 1836 , when they started in carriages with a commissary and a few guards ; in every town and village through which they passed , crowds surrounded them with gratulations ; the inns where they stopped were besieged with well-wishers ; Nature , too , seemed to hail their release with vernal beauty ; and so they journeyed on , to be received as honored guests rather than prisoners-of-state at the Castle of Gradisca . Their sojourn here was as recreative as was consistent with that degree of supervision necessary to prevent escape ; they were at liberty to walk about , to make and receive visits , to bathe in the sea , to attend the fairs , and examine the local celebrities of Friuli ; a single commissary often accompanied their excursions , and personally the most delicate consideration was paid them . Here , too , the most affecting reunions of long-severed kindred and friends took place ; their relatives hastened hither to embrace them . Foresti used to relate many anecdotes illustrative of the sympathy and respect felt and manifested by strangers during this interlude between prison and exile . One deserves record here . Two travelling-carriages arrived at a village-inn , one evening , where they were resting . While the gentlemen were inspecting the apartments , a lady of distinguished appearance inquired of a bystander , who the strangers were towards whom so many friendly glances were directed ; soon after , the landlord bore to them her request for an interview ; they rose at her entrance ; she attempted to speak , but her voice faltered , and , with tears , she turned to her little boys and said , “ Kneel , my darlings , to these brave Italian patriots ; they are illustrious victims in the great cause of Liberty ; and you , gentlemen , bless my sons ; your blessing will be fruitful to them of good ; it will make them love their country and die for it , if need be . I am a Pole . My country is oppressed like yours . I have two brothers compromised in the last insurrection in Cracow . May God preserve them ! ” — and weeping bitterly , she retired . They afterwards learned that her husband was Counsellor of State to the King of Prussia . On the 1st of August , 1836 , they were transported by night to Trieste , and , by a singular coincidence , placed on board the same brig-of-war whence Kozsta was subsequently taken at Smyrna ,— an incident memorable in our subsequent diplomacy , as having occasioned the celebrated letter of Webster to the Austrian envoy . Provided by that government with warm clothing , the money they had taken to Spielberg was restored to them , not , however , in the original gold coin , but in the Vienna bills for which it had been then exchanged by the police , diminished nearly two-thirds in value during the interval of fourteen years . The vessel was uncomfortably crowded ; the voyage occupied three months ; but they fared alike with the officers . Towards the close of October , they beheld the noble bay of New York ; and so intense was the satisfaction with which they first trod American soil , the goal and terminus of such protracted suffering , that , ever after , the Battery , where they landed , was hallowed to their memories as consecrated ground . Within a few days of their arrival , a banquet was given them by their compatriots ; and from that hour , Foresti became the oracle and the consoler , the teacher , almoner , and chief of his fellow-exiles . Subsequent events drove many other Italian patriots to our shores ; his purse and his counsel were ever ready for the impoverished and inexperienced , who regarded him with filial admiration ; while to the more educated he was the intimate companion or sympathetic friend . Through his personal influence , employment was constantly obtained and kindness enlisted for his countrymen . When the great political crisis of 1848 occurred , Foresti hastened to Europe ; Pius IX ., at the urgent prayer of his sisters and cousins , offered him free entrance to his dominions , a favor his predecessor might have granted but for the strong opposition of Cardinal Lambruschini . He took counsel with the revolutionary leaders at Paris , and passed through Italy to the frontiers of the Papal States , whence the fatal reaction , supported by French bayonets , at Rome , sent him back once more to the land of his adoption , whither he was soon followed by many of the heroic and unfortunate men who redeemed the martial fame , without being able to retrieve the fate of Italy . Of the many Italian exiles who have found an asylum in the United States , Foresti was preeminently the representative man . The period of his arrival , the circumstances of his life , and the traits of his character united thus to distinguish him even among the best educated and most unfortunate of the political refugees from Southern Europe . At the time of his arrest , the vilest modern despotism of the Continent had reached its acme ; and the patriotic movements it then sought to annihilate by a cruelty unparalleled since the Middle Ages were justified even by conservative reformers , on account of their stringent moral necessity , the intelligent scope of their advocates , and the high and cultivated spirit of their illustrious martyrs . As scholars , citizens , gentlemen , and , in more than one instance , authors of real genius , these Liberals stand alone , and are not to be confounded with the perverse Radicals of a subsequent epoch . Moreover , their aspirations were , as we have seen , more reactionary than experimental ; for the rights for which they conspired had been in a great measure enjoyed under Europe 's modern conqueror , then impotent in action , but most efficient in remembrance , although isolated on his prison-rock . Foresti 's companion in misfortune has made their mutual wrongs “ familiar as household words ” ; and to be associated in captivity with the author of “ Le Mie Prigioni ” was of itself a passport to the sympathy of the civilized world . The interest his previous history inspired was deepened and confirmed by intimate acquaintance with Foresti . He lived for many years domesticated in the family of a fellow-countryman ; and an habitu é of his apartments was transported in a moment from bustling , prosperous , and republican New York , to the land of song , of martyrdom , and of antiquity . The soulful ardor and childlike ingenuousness , the keen perceptions and earnest will of Foresti suggested an obsolete , or at least rare type of character ; he belonged essentially to the olden days of loyalty and lore which gave birth to self-reliance on the one hand , and disinterested feeling on the other . His manner and conversation had , as it were , an historical as well as national flavor , by virtue whereof we were borne away from the prosaic and practical spirit of the age , to the days of chivalry , feudal zeal , and genuine humanity ,— when faith was an inspiration , friendship a moral fact , and manhood , in its virile simplicity , greater than wealth . Nor were the generous exile 's humble surroundings alien to these impressions : the effigies of his country 's poets were the favorite ornaments of his sitting-room ; a volume of Foscolo on the table , or a fresh letter from Silvio Pellico under his snuffbox ,— the grim , old-fashioned type of his Sentenza , as it was originally distributed through Austrian Italy , and hanging in its black frame , a memorial of startling import to a freeman 's eyes ,— a landscape representing the Castle of Ferrara , the far-away scene of his youthful life ,— and a primitive engraving from one of the old masters of that city , dedicated to him in one of those euphonious inscriptions peculiar to Italian artists ,— these and such as these tokens of his experience and tastes gave interesting significance to his companionship . Nor were indications of present consideration and usefulness wanting : flowers or dainty needle-work , the offerings of his fair pupils , applications to him , as President of the Italian Benevolent Society , diplomas from American colleges , and invitations to the country , to dinner , and to domestic f ê tes , from the numerous friends he had won in the free land of his adoption , gave evidence of social enjoyment and genial activity . Whoever enjoyed Foresti 's hospitality , in the conversations as well as the viands has found an epitome and reflex of his most genial hours in Italy : brave soldiers , like Avezzana and Garibaldi , scholars , artists , every form of the national character , were gratefully exhibited in reunions , of which he was the presiding genius , and to which his American friends were admitted with fraternal cordiality . It was then that his clear and strong mind often displayed itself with the spontaneity of his race . Chastened , though unsubdued by misfortune , Foresti cherished a truly Christian spirit of forgiveness , and the liberality which large experience invariably fosters in enlightened minds : it was the system , rather than its agents , which he ever held up to condemnation in discussing the Austrian policy . Familiarity with American and English politics and the modern history of Europe induced a wise modification of his opinions on government ; a fervent republican in sentiment , he yet recognized the radical benefits of a constitutional monarchy , like those of England and Sardinia . He was a natural orator , and , on several occasions , memorably addressed the public with rare eloquence and power on subjects of national or beneficent interest . During his long sojourn in New York , he was not merely the acknowledged representative of Italy , but her eloquent advocate , her wise expositor , her illustrious son , whose literature he memorably unfolded , whose history he sagaciously analyzed , whose misfortunes he tenderly portrayed , whose glory he proudly vindicated , and whose nationality he incessantly affirmed . Well did one of the leading Turin journals indicate the prevalent graces of his character :— “ A pure and just man , he knew always how to appreciate those who dissented from him about forms of government , because he could discover in them the true love of nationality , to which Italy aspires . Wise without pretension , beneficent without ostentation , chaste in deed and word , exquisitely tender-hearted , he tempered the harsh lessons of experience by the unchanged serenity of his bearing . ” Foresti was the most charming of correspondents ; in a chirography almost feminine , he wrote , in the old cavalier style , such quaintly pleasant epistles , with graceful turns of expression , beautiful epithets , and appropriate adjectives , that , to one fond of the writer and cognizant of his native tongue , the most casual note was a prize to be treasured . “ Truly , ” remarks one of his friends , “ he was squisitamente affetuoso di cuore , ” and now the sweetest proof thereof is to be found in his correspondence . In his two visits to Italy , he used to walk daily to the shores , when within reach of the Mediterranean , and salute , with tears , the bandiera stellata ,— as he called our national banner , under which his exile had been protected and honored . The pleasure expressed at Foresti 's consular appointment , as well as the high order of applicants in his behalf , afforded the best evidence of the friendship and interest he had awakened and maintained in a foreign land . On the shores of the Hudson , by the cliffs of Newport , under the elms of New Haven , as well as in the metropolis where he had so long dwelt , faithful hearts rejoiced at the announcement . “ Few are aware , ” said Hillhouse , in his Eulogy on Lafayette , “ how hallowed and how deep are their feelings who worship Liberty as a mistress they may never possess . ” And it was the constancy and intelligence of his devotion to her which won for him such peculiar regard ; for he did not belong to the sentimental and spasmodic , but to the resolute and philosophic devotees at her shrine ; his native taste was more wedded to the wise satire of Casti and the acute generalities of Vico than satisfied with the soft beauties of Petrarch or the luxurious graces of Boccaccio ; the stoical Alfieri , more than the epicurean Metastasio , breathed music to his soul . “ You belong , ” wrote Pellico to him , “ you belong to those who to a generous disposition unite an intellect to see things wisely ; never can I forget the gifts of genius and of courage developed in you in the days of misfortune . ” It was an auspicious sign of the times when the land which protected such an exile was represented by him in that of his nativity . Brief , however , was Foresti 's enjoyment of the distinction and resource thus secured for him through the considerate efforts of his American friends . “ I write to you , ” says his last letter to one of them , dated immediately after the reception of his commission , “ with my left hand pressed on a heart overflowing with gratitude for the means thus honorably afforded to solace the last years of the old prisoner of Spielberg . ” Three months after , that noble heart ceased to beat ; an effusion on the chest , which ultimately defied the best medical skill and the most assiduous friendly devotion , ended fatally on the morning of the 14th of September , 1858 , “ By his death , ” said one of his eulogists , “ is broken one of the links that bind the New World to the Old ” ; and as if to evidence the sympathy of mourners in two hemispheres and attest the varied associations which embalm the example and memory of Foresti , his funeral was typical of his life , and so illustrative of his character , that we can imagine no peculiar honor wanting , grateful to the patriot , the liberal , the martyr , or the man . In that ancient city of Genoa , of old renowned for commercial glory and maritime valor , the birthplace of the discoverer of the land of his adoption , now the refuge of more who had sacrificed all for their country , and the state where that country 's best prospects are centred and her highest aspirations cherished , in the home of the moral , civic , and social vanguard of modern Italy , he found a grave . The American flag was his pall ; American mariners carried his bier ; before it was borne the Cross . His remains were followed from the Piazza della Maddelena , through the principal streets and the Porta Romana to the Campo Santo , by the officers and crew of the United States frigate “ Wabash , ” the captains of the American merchantmen in port , the Society of Operatives , the industrial representative of a progressive state , of which he was an honorary member , a vast multitude of emigrants from the less favored Italian provinces , and a numerous body of literary , official , and private gentlemen who enjoyed his personal friendship . LARVAE . My little maiden of four years old ( No myth , but a genuine child is she , With her bronze-brown eyes , and her curls of gold ) Came , quite in disgust , one day , to me . Rubbing her shoulder with rosy palm ,— As the loathsome touch seemed yet to thrill her , She cried ,— “ Oh , mother , I found on my arm A horrible , crawling caterpillar ! ” And with mischievous smile she could scarcely smother , Yet a glance , in its daring , half-awed and shy , She added ,— “ While they were about it , mother , I wish they 'd just finished the butterfly ! ” They were words to the thought of the soul that turns From the coarser form of a partial growth , Reproaching the Infinite Patience that yearns With an unknown glory to crown them both . Ah , look thou largely , with lenient eyes , On whatso beside thee may creep and cling , For the possible beauty that underlies The passing phase of the meanest thing ! What if God 's great angels , whose waiting love Beholdeth our pitiful life below , From the holy height of their heaven above , Could n't bear with the worm till the wings should grow ? THE MINISTER 'S WOOING . [*] Footnote *: Copyright secured by the Author in Great Britain and France . Copyright secured by the Author in Great Britain and France . Continued . CHAPTER XXX . THE QUILTING . By six o'clock in the morning , Miss Prissy came out of the best room to the breakfast-table , with the air of a general who has arranged a campaign ,— her face glowing with satisfaction . All sat down together to their morning meal . The outside door was open into the green , turfy yard , and the apple-tree , now nursing stores of fine yellow jeannetons , looked in at the window . Every once in a while , as a breeze shook the leaves , a fully ripe apple might be heard falling to the ground , at which Miss Prissy would bustle up from the table and rush to secure the treasure . As the meal waned to its close , the rattling of wheels was heard at the gate , and Candace was discerned , seated aloft in the one-horse wagon , with her usual complement of baskets and bags . “ Well , now , dear me ! if there is n't Candace ! ” said Miss Prissy ; “ I do believe Miss Marvyn has sent her with something for the quilting ! ” and out she flew as nimble as a humming-bird , while those in the house heard various exclamations of admiration , as Candace , with stately dignity , disinterred from the wagon one basket after another , and exhibited to Miss Prissy 's enraptured eyes sly peeps under the white napkins with which they were covered . And then , hanging a large basket on either arm , she rolled majestically towards the house , like a heavy-laden Indiaman , coming in after a fast voyage . “ Good-mornin ’ , Miss Scudder ! good-mornin ’ , Doctor ! ” she said , dropping her curtsy on the door-step ; “ good-mornin ’ , Miss Mary ! Ye see our folks was stirrin ’ pootty ‘ arly dis mornin ’ , an ’ Miss Marvyn sent me down wid two or tree little tings . ” Setting down her baskets on the floor , and seating herself between them , she proceeded to develop their contents with ill-concealed triumph . One basket was devoted to cakes of every species , from the great Mont-Blanc loaf-cake , with its snowy glaciers of frosting , to the twisted cruller and puffy doughnut . In the other basket lay pots of golden butter curiously stamped , reposing on a bed of fresh , green leaves ,— while currants , red and white , and delicious cherries and raspberries , gave a final finish to the picture . From a basket which Miss Prissy brought in from the rear appeared cold fowl and tongue delicately prepared , and shaded with feathers of parsley . Candace , whose rollicking delight in the good things of this life was conspicuous in every emotion , might have furnished to a painter , as she sat in her brilliant turban , an idea for an African Genius of Plenty . “ Why , really , Candace , ” said Mrs. Scudder , “ you are overwhelming us ! ” “ Ho ! ho ! ho ! ” said Candace , “ I 's tellin ’ Miss Marvyn folks do n't git married but once in der lives , ( gin'ally speakin ’ , dat is ,) an ’ den dey oughter hab plenty to do it wid . ” “ Well , I must say , ” said Miss Prissy , taking out the loaf-cake with busy assiduity ,— “ I must say , Candace , this does beat all ! ” “ I should rader tink it oughter , ” said Candace , bridling herself with proud consciousness ; “ ef it do n't , ‘ ta'n ' t ‘ cause ole Candace ha'n ' t put enough into it . I tell ye , I did n't do nothin ’ all day yisterday but jes ’ make dat ar cake . Cato , when he got up , he begun to talk someh'n ’ ‘ bout his shirt-buttons , an ’ I jes ’ shet him right up . Says I , ‘ Cato , when I 's r'ally got cake to make for a great ‘ casion , I wants my mind jest as quiet an ’ jest as serene as ef I was a-goin ’ to de sacrament . I do n't want no ‘ arthly cares o n't . Now , ’ says I , ‘ Cato , de ole Doctor 's gwine to be married , an ’ dis yer 's his quiltin ’ - cake ,— an ’ Miss Mary , she 's gwine to be married , an ’ dis yer 's her quiltin ’ - cake . An ’ dar 'll be eberybody to dat ar quiltin ’ ; an ’ ef de cake a'n ' t right , why , ‘ twould be puttin ’ a candle under a bushel . An ’ so , ’ says I , ‘ Cato , your buttons mus ’ wait ’ An ’ Cato , he sees de ‘ priety ob it , ‘ cause , dough he can n't make cake like me , he 's a ‘ mazin ’ good judge o n't , an ’ is dre'ful tickled when I slips out a little loaf for his supper . ” “ How is Mrs. Marvyn ? ” said Mrs. Scudder . “ Kinder thin and shimmery ; but she 's about ,— habin ’ her eyes eberywar , ‘ n ’ lookin ’ into eberyting . She jes ’ touches tings wid de tips ob her fingers an ’ dey seem to go like . She 'll be down to de quiltin ’ dis arternoon . But she tole me to take de tings an ’ come down an ’ spen ’ de day here ; for Miss Marvyn an ’ I both knows how many steps mus ’ be taken sech times , an ’ we agreed you oughter favor yourselves all you could . ” “ Well , now , ” said Miss Prissy , lifting up her hands , “ if that a'n ' t what ‘ tis to have friends ! Why , that was one of the things I was thinking of , as I lay awake last night ; because , you know , at times like these , people run their feet off before the time begins , and then they are all limpsey and lop-sided when the time comes . Now , I say , Candace , all Miss Scudder and Mary have to do is to give everything up to us , and we 'll put it through straight . ” “ Dat 's what we will ! ” said Candace . “ Jes ’ show me what 's to be done , an ’ I 'll do it . ” Candace and Miss Prissy soon disappeared together into the pantry with the baskets , whose contents they began busily to arrange . Candace shut the door , that no sound might escape , and began a confidential outpouring to Miss Prissy . “ Ye see , ” she said , “ I 's feelin 's all de while for Miss Marvyn ; ‘ cause , ye see , she was expectin ’ , ef eber Mary was married ,— well — dat ‘ twould be to somebody else , ye know . ” Miss Prissy responded with a sympathetic groan . “ Well , ” said Candace , “ ef't had been anybody but de Doctor , I would n't ‘ a ’ been resigned . But arter all he 's done for my color , dar a'n ' t nothin ’ I could find it in my heart to grudge him . But den I was tellin ’ Cato t'oder day , says I , ‘ Cato , I dunno ‘ bout de rest o ’ de world , but I ha'n ' t neber felt it in my bones dat Mass'r James is r'ally dead , for sartin . ’ Now I feels tings gin'ally , but some tings I feels in my bones , an ’ dem allers comes true . An ’ dat ar 's a feelin ’ I ha'n ' t had ‘ bout Mass'r Jim yit , an ’ dat ar 's what I 'm waitin ’ for ‘ fore I clar make up my mind . Though I know , ‘ cordin ’ to all white folks ’ way o ’ tinkin ’ , dar a'n ' t no hope , ‘ cause Squire Marvyn he had dat ar Jeduth Pettibone up to his house , a-questionin ’ on him , off an ’ on , nigh about tree hours . An ’ r'ally I did n't see no hope no way , ‘ xcept jes ’ dis yer , as I was tellin ’ Cato ,— I can n't feel it in my bones . ” Candace was not versed enough in the wisdom of the world to know that she belonged to a large and respectable school of philosophers in this particular mode of testing evidence , which , after all , the reader will perceive has its conveniences . “ Anoder ting , ” said Candace ; “ as much as a dozen times , dis yer last year , when I 's been a-scourin ’ knives , a fork has fell an ’ stuck straight up in de floor ; an ’ de las ’ time I pinted it out to Miss Marvyn , an ’ she on'y jes ’ said , ‘ Why , what o ’ dat , Candace ? ’ ” “ Well , ” said Miss Prissy , “ I do n't believe in signs , but then strange things do happen . Now about dogs howling under windows ,— why , I do n't believe in it a bit , but I never knew it fail that there was a death in the house after . ” “ Ah , I tell ye what , ” said Candace , looking mysterious , “ dogs knows a heap more'n dey likes to tell ! ” “ Jes ’ so , ” said Miss Prissy . “ Now I remember , one night , when . I was watching with Miss Colonel Andrews , after Marthy Ann was born , that we heard the mournfulest howling that ever you did hear . It seemed to come from right under the front stoop ; and Miss Andrews she just dropped the spoon in her gruel , and says she , ‘ Miss Prissy , do , for pity 's sake , just go down and see what that noise is . ’ And I went down and lifted up one of the loose boards of the stoop , and what should I see there but their Newfoundland pup ?— there that creature had dug a grave , and was a-sitting by it , crying ! ” Candace drew near to Miss Prissy , dark with expressive interest , as her voice , in this awful narration , sank to a whisper . “ Well , ” said Candace , after Miss Prissy had made something of a pause . “ Well , I told Miss Andrews I did n't think there was anything in it , ” said Miss Prissy ; “ but , ” she added , impressively , “ she lost a very dear brother , six months after , and I laid him out with my own hands ,— yes , laid him out in white flannel . ” “ Some folks say , ” said Candace , “ dat dreamin ’ ‘ bout white horses is a sartin sign . Jinny Styles is bery strong ‘ bout dat . Now she come down one mornin ’ cryin ’ , ‘ cause she 'd been dreamin ’ ‘ bout white horses , an ’ she was sure she should hear some friend was dead . An ’ sure enough , a man come in dat bery day an ’ tole her her son was drownded out in de harbor . An ’ Jinny said , ‘ Dar ! she was sure dat sign neber would fail . ’ But den , ye see , dat night he come home . Jinny wa'n ' t r'ally disappinted , but she allers insisted he was as good as drownded , any way , ‘ cause he sunk tree times . ” “ Well , I tell you , ” said Miss Prissy , “ there are a great many more things in this world than folks know about . ” “ So dey are , ” said Candace . “ Now , I ha'n ' t neber opened my mind to nobody ; but dar 's a dream I 's had , tree mornin 's runnin ’ , lately . I dreamed I see Jim Marvyn a-sinkin ’ in de water , an ’ stretchin ’ up his hands . An ’ den I dreamed I see de Lord Jesus come a-walkin ’ on de water , an ’ take hold ob his hand , an ’ says he , ‘ O thou of little faith , wherefore didst thou doubt ? ’ An ’ den he lifted him right out . An ’ I ha'n ' t said nothin ’ to nobody , ‘ cause , you know , de Doctor , he says people mus'n ' t mind nothin ’ ‘ bout der dreams , ‘ cause dreams belongs to de ole ‘ spensation . ” “ Well , well , well ! ” said Miss Prissy , “ I am sure I do n't know what to think . What time in the morning was it that you dreamed it ? ” “ Why , ” said Candace , “ it was jest arter bird-peep . I kinder allers wakes myself den , an ’ turns ober , an ’ what comes arter dat is apt to run clar . ” “ Well , well , well ! ” said Miss Prissy , “ I do n't know what to think . You see , it may have reference to the state of his soul . ” “ I know dat , ” said Candace ; “ but as nigh as I could judge in my dream , ” she added , sinking her voice and looking mysterious , “ as nigh as I can judge , dat boy 's soul was in his body ! ” “ Why , how do you know ? ” said Miss Prissy , looking astonished at the confidence with which Candace expressed her opinion . “ Well , ye see , ” said Candace , rather mysteriously , “ de Doctor , he do n't like to hab us talk much ‘ bout dese yer tings , ‘ cause he tinks it 's kind o ’ heathenish . But den , folks as is used to seein ’ sech tings knows de look ob a sperit out o ’ de body from de look ob a sperit in de body , jest as easy as you can tell Mary from de Doctor . ” At this moment Mrs. Scudder opened the pantry-door and put an end to this mysterious conversation , which had already so affected Miss Prissy , that , in the eagerness of her interest , she had rubbed up her cap border and ribbon into rather an elfin and goblin style , as if they had been ruffled up by a breeze from the land of spirits ; and she flew around for a few moments in a state of great nervous agitation , upsetting dishes , knocking down plates , and huddling up contrary suggestions as to what ought to be done first , in such impossible relations that Mrs. Katy Scudder stood in dignified surprise at this strange freak of conduct in the wise woman of the parish . A dim consciousness of something not quite canny in herself seemed to strike her , for she made a vigorous effort to appear composed ; and facing Mrs. Scudder , with an air of dignified suavity , inquired if it would not be best to put Jim Marvyn in the oven now , while Candace was getting the pies ready ,— meaning , of course , a large turkey , which was to be the first in an indefinite series to be baked that morning ; and discovering , by Mrs. Scudder 's dazed expression and a vigorous pinch from Candace , that somehow she had not improved matters , she rubbed her spectacles into a diagonal position across her eyes , and stood glaring , half through , half over them , with a helpless expression , which in a less judicious person might have suggested the idea of a state of slight intoxication . But the exigencies of an immediate temporal dispensation put an end to Miss Prissy 's unwonted vagaries , and she was soon to be seen flying round like a meteor , dusting , shaking curtains , counting napkins , wiping and sorting china , all with such rapidity as to give rise to the notion that she actually existed in forty places at once . Candace , whom the limits of her corporeal frame restricted to an altogether different style of locomotion , often rolled the whites of her eyes after her and gave vent to her views of her proceedings in sententious expressions . “ Do you know why dat ar neber was married ? ” she said to Mary , as she stood looking after her . Miss Prissy had made one of those rapid transits through the apartment . “ No , ” answered Mary , innocently . “ Why was n't she ? ” “ ‘ Cause neber was a man could run fast enough to cotch her , ” said Candace ; and then her portly person shook with the impulse of her own wit . By two o'clock a goodly company began to assemble . Mrs. Deacon Twitchel arrived , soft , pillowy , and plaintive as ever , accompanied by Cerinthy Ann , a comely damsel , tall and trim , with a bright black eye , and a most vigorous and determined style of movement . Good Mrs. Jones , broad , expansive , and solid , having vegetated tranquilly on in the cabbage-garden of the virtues since three years ago , when she graced our tea-party , was now as well preserved as ever , and brought some fresh butter , a tin pail of cream , and a loaf of cake made after a new Philadelphia receipt . The tall , spare , angular figure of Mrs. Simeon Brown alone was wanting ; but she patronized Mrs. Scudder no more , and tossed her head with a becoming pride when her name was mentioned . The quilt-pattern was gloriously drawn in oak-leaves , done in indigo ; and soon all the company , young and old , were passing busy fingers over it ; and conversation went on briskly . Madame de Frontignac , we must not forget to say , had entered with hearty abandon into the spirit of the day . She had dressed the tall china vases on the mantel-pieces , and , departing from the usual rule of an equal mixture of roses and asparagus-bushes , had constructed two quaint and graceful bouquets , where garden-flowers were mingled with drooping grasses and trailing wild vines , forming a graceful combination which excited the surprise of all who saw it . “ It 's the very first time in my life that I ever saw grass put into a flower-pot , ” said Miss Prissy ; “ but I must say it looks as handsome as a picture . Mary , I must say , ” she added , in an aside , “ I think that Madame de Frongenac is the sweetest dressing and appearing creature I ever saw ; she do n't dress up nor put on airs , but she seems to see in a minute how things ought to go ; and if it 's only a bit of grass , or leaf , or wild vine , that she puts in her hair , why , it seems to come just right . I should like to make her a dress , for I know she would understand my fit ; do speak to her , Mary , in case she should want a dress fitted here , to let me try it . ” At the quilting , Madame de Frontignac would have her seat , and soon won the respect of the party by the dexterity with which she used her needle ; though , when it was whispered that she learned to quilt among the nuns , some of the elderly ladies exhibited a slight uneasiness , as being rather doubtful whether they might not be encouraging Papistical opinions by allowing her an equal share in the work of getting up their minister 's bed-quilt ; but the younger part of the company were quite captivated by her foreign air , and the pretty manner in which she lisped her English ; and Cerinthy Ann even went so far as to horrify her mother by saying that she wished she 'd been educated in a convent herself ,— a declaration which arose less from native depravity than from a certain vigorous disposition , which often shows itself in young people , to shock the current opinions of their elders and betters . Of course , the conversation took a general turn , somewhat in unison with the spirit of the occasion ; and whenever it flagged , some allusion to a forthcoming wedding , or some sly hint at the future young Madame of the parish , was sufficient to awaken the dormant animation of the company . Cerinthy Ann contrived to produce an agreeable electric shock by declaring , that , for her part , she never could see into it , how any girl could marry a minister ,— that she should as soon think of setting up housekeeping in a meeting-house . “ Oh , Cerinthy Ann ! ” exclaimed her mother , “ how can you go on so ? ” “ It 's a fact , ” said the adventurous damsel ; “ now other men let you have some peace ,— but a minister 's always round under your feet . ” “ So you think , the less you see of a husband , the better ? ” said one of the ladies . “ Just my views , ” said Cerinthy , giving a decided snip to her thread with her scissors ; “ I like the Nantucketers , that go off on four-years ’ voyages , and leave their wives a clear field . If ever I get married , I 'm going up to have one of those fellows . ” It is to be remarked , in passing , that Miss Cerinthy Ann was at this very time receiving surreptitious visits from a consumptive-looking , conscientious , young theological candidate , who came occasionally to preach in the vicinity , and put up at the house of the Deacon , her father . This good young man , being violently attacked on the doctrine of Election by Miss Cerinthy , had been drawn on to illustrate it in a most practical manner , to her comprehension ; and it was the consciousness of the weak and tottering state of the internal garrison that added vigor to the young lady 's tones . As Mary had been the chosen confidante of the progress of this affair , she was quietly amused at the demonstration . “ You 'd better take care , Cerinthy Ann , ” said her mother ; “ they say that ‘ those who sing before breakfast will cry before supper . ’ Girls talk about getting married , ” she said , relapsing into a gentle didactic melancholy , “ without realizing its awful responsibilities . ” “ Oh , as to that , ” said Cerinthy , “ I 've been practising on my pudding now these six years , and I should n't be afraid to throw one up chimney with any girl . ” This speech was founded on a tradition , current in those times , that no young lady was fit to be married till she could construct a boiled Indian-pudding of such consistency that it could be thrown up chimney and come down on the ground , outside , without breaking ; and the consequence of Cerinthy Ann 's sally was a general laugh . “ Girls a'n ' t what they used to be in my day , ” sententiously remarked an elderly lady . “ I remember my mother told me when she was thirteen she could knit a long cotton stocking in a day . ” “ I have n't much faith in these stories of old times ,— have you , girls ? ” said Cerinthy , appealing to the younger members at the frame . “ At any rate , ” said Mrs. Twitchel , “ our minister 's wife will be a pattern ; I do n't know anybody that goes beyond her either in spinning or fine stitching . ” Mary sat as placid and disengaged as the new moon , and listened to the chatter of old and young with the easy quietness of a young heart that has early outlived life , and looks on everything in the world from some gentle , restful eminence far on towards a better home . She smiled at everybody 's word , had a quick eye for everybody 's wants , and was ready with thimble , scissors , or thread , whenever any one needed them ; but once , when there was a pause in the conversation , she and Mrs. Marvyn were both discovered to have stolen away . They were seated on the bed in Mary 's little room , with their arms around each other , communing in low and gentle tones . “ Mary , my dear child , ” said her friend , “ this event is very pleasant to me , because it places you permanently near me . I did not know but eventually this sweet face might lead to my losing you , who are in some respects the dearest friend I have . ” “ You might be sure , ” said Mary , “ I never would have married , except that my mother 's happiness and the happiness of so good a friend seemed to depend on it . When we renounce self in anything , we have reason to hope for God 's blessing ; and so I feel assured of a peaceful life in the course I have taken . You will always be as a mother to me , ” she added , laying her head on her friend 's shoulder . “ Yes , ” said Mrs. Marvyn ; “ and I must not let myself think a moment how dear it might have been to have you more my own . If you feel really , truly happy ,— if you can enter on this life without any misgivings ” — “ I can , ” said Mary , firmly . At this instant , very strangely , the string which confined a wreath of sea-shells around her glass , having been long undermined by moths , suddenly broke and fell down , scattering the shells upon the floor . Both women started , for the string of shells had been placed there by James : and though neither was superstitious , this was one of those odd coincidences that make hearts throb . “ Dear boy ! ” said Mary , gathering the shells up tenderly ; “ wherever he is , I shall never cease to love him . It makes me feel sad to see this come down ; but it is only an accident ; nothing of him will ever fail out of my heart . ” Mrs. Marvyn clasped Mary closer to her , with tears in her eyes . “ I 'll tell you what , Mary ; it must have been the moths did that , ” said Miss Prissy , who had been standing , unobserved , at the door for a moment back ; “ moths will eat away strings just so . Last week Miss Vernon 's great family-picture fell down because the moths eat through the cord ; people ought to use twine or cotton string always . But I came to tell you that the supper is all set , and the Doctor out of his study , and all the people are wondering where you are . ” Mary and Mrs. Marvyn gave a hasty glance at themselves in the glass , to be assured of their good keeping , and went into the great kitchen , where a long table stood exhibiting all that plenitude of provision which the immortal description of Washington Irving has saved us the trouble of recapitulating in detail . The husbands , brothers , and lovers had come in , and the scene was redolent of gayety . When Mary made her appearance , there was a moment 's pause , till she was conducted to the side of the Doctor ; when , raising his hand , he invoked a grace upon the loaded board . Unrestrained gayeties followed . Groups of young men and maidens chatted together , and all the gallantries of the times were enacted . Serious matrons commented on the cake , and told each other high and particular secrets in the culinary art , which they drew from remote family-archives . One might have learned in that instructive assembly how best to keep moths out of blankets ,— how to make fritters of Indian corn undistinguishable from oysters ,— how to bring up babies by hand ,— how to mend a cracked teapot ,— how to take out grease from a brocade ,— how to reconcile absolute decrees with free will ,— how to make five yards of cloth answer the purpose of six ,— and how to put down the Democratic party . All were busy , earnest , and certain ,— just as a swarm of men and women , old and young , are in 1859 . Miss Prissy was in her glory ; every bow of her best cap was alive with excitement , and she presented to the eyes of the astonished Newport gentry an animated receipt-book . Some of the information she communicated , indeed , was so valuable and important that she could not trust the air with it , but whispered the most important portions in a confidential tone . Among the crowd , Cerinthy Ann 's theological admirer was observed in deeply reflective attitude ; and that high-spirited young lady added further to his convictions of the total depravity of the species by vexing and discomposing him in those thousand ways in which a lively , ill-conditioned young woman will put to rout a serious , well-disposed young man ,— comforting herself with the reflection , that by-and-by she would repent of all her sins in a lump together . Vain , transitory splendors ! Even this evening , so glorious , so heart-cheering , so fruitful in instruction and amusement , could not last forever . Gradually the company broke up ; the matrons mounted soberly on horseback behind their spouses ; and Cerinthy consoled her clerical friend by giving him an opportunity to read her a lecture on the way home , if he found the courage to do so . Mr. and Mrs. Marvyn and Candace wound their way soberly homeward ; the Doctor returned to his study for nightly devotions ; and before long , sleep settled down on the brown cottage . “ I 'll tell you what , Cato , ” said Candace , before composing herself to sleep , “ I can n't feel it in my bones dat dis yer weddin 's gwine to come off yit . ” CHAPTER XXXI . AN ADVENTURE . A day or two after , Madame de Frontignac and Mary went out to gather shells and seaweed on the beach . It was four o'clock ; and the afternoon sun was hanging in the sultry sky of July with a hot and vaporous stillness . The whole air was full of blue haze , that softened the outlines of objects without hiding them . The sea lay like so much glass ; every ship and boat was double ; every line and rope and spar had its counterpart ; and it seemed hard to say which was the more real , the under or the upper world . Madame de Frontignac and Mary had brought a little basket with them , which they were filling with shells and sea-mosses . The former was in high spirits . She ran , and shouted , and exclaimed , and wondered at each new marvel thrown out upon the shore , with the abandon of a little child . Mary could not but wonder whether this indeed were she whose strong words had pierced and wrung her sympathies the other night , and whether a deep life-wound could lie bleeding under those brilliant eyes and that infantine exuberance of gayety ; yet , surely , all that which seemed so strong , so true , so real could not be gone so soon ,— and it could not be so soon consoled . Mary wondered at her , as the Anglo-Saxon constitution , with its strong , firm intensity , its singleness of nature , wonders at the mobile , many-sided existence of warmer races , whose versatility of emotion on the surface is not incompatible with the most intense persistency lower down . Mary 's was one of those indulgent and tolerant natures which seem to form the most favorable base for the play of other minds , rather than to be itself salient ,— and something about her tender calmness always seemed to provoke the spirit of frolic in her friend . She would laugh at her , kiss her , gambol round her , dress her hair with fantastic coiffures , and call her all sorts of fanciful and poetic names in French or English ,— while Mary surveyed her with a pleased and innocent surprise , as a revelation of character altogether new and different from anything to which she had been hitherto accustomed . She was to her a living pantomime , and brought into her unembellished life the charms of opera and theatre and romance . After wearying themselves with their researches , they climbed round a point of rock that stretched some way out into the sea , and attained to a little kind of grotto , where the high cliffs shut out the rays of the sun . They sat down to rest upon the rocks . A fresh breeze of declining day was springing up , and bringing the rising tide landward ,— each several line of waves with its white crests coming up and breaking gracefully on the hard , sparkling sand-beach at their feet . Mary 's eyes fixed themselves , as they were apt to do , in a mournful reverie , on the infinite expanse of waters , which was now broken and chopped into a thousand incoming waves by the fresh afternoon breeze . Madame de Frontignac noticed the expression , and began to play with her as if she had been a child . She pulled the comb from her hair , and let down its long silky waves upon her shoulders . “ Now , ” said she , “ let us make a Miranda of thee . This is our cave . I will be Prince Ferdinand . Burr told me all about that ,— he reads beautifully , and explained it all to me . What a lovely story that is !— you must be so happy , who know how to read Shakspeare without learning ! Tenez ! I will put this shell on your forehead ,— it has a hole here , and I will pass this gold chain through ,— now ! What a pity this seaweed will not be pretty out of water ! it has no effect ; but there is some green that will do ;— let me fasten it so . Now , fair Miranda , look at thyself ! ” Where is the girl so angelic as not to feel a slight curiosity to know how she shall look in a new and strange costume ? Mary bent over the rock , where a little pool of water lay in a brown hollow above the fluctuations of the tide , dark and still , like a mirror ,— and saw a fair face , with a white shell above the forehead and drooping wreaths of green seaweed in the silken hair ; and a faint blush and smile rose on the cheek , giving the last finish to the picture . “ How do you find yourself ? ” said Madame . “ Confess now that I have a true talent in coiffure . Now I will be Ferdinand . ” She turned quickly , and her eye was caught by something that Mary did not see ; she only saw the smile fade suddenly from Madame de Frontignac 's cheek , and her lips grow deadly white , while her heart beat so that Mary could discern its flutterings under her black silk bodice . “ Will the sea-nymphs punish the rash presumption of a mortal who intrudes ? ” said Colonel Burr , stepping before them with a grace as invincible and assured as if he had never had any past history with either . Mary started with a guilty blush , like a child detected in an unseemly frolic , and put her hand to her head to take off the unwonted adornments . “ Let me protest , in the name of the Graces , ” said Burr , who by that time stood with easy calmness at her side ; and as he spoke , he stayed her hand with that gentle air of authority which made it the natural impulse of most people to obey him . “ It would be treason against the picturesque , ” he added , “ to spoil that toilette , so charmingly uniting the wearer to the scene . ” Mary was taken by surprise , and discomposed as every one is who finds himself masquerading in attire foreign to his usual habits and character ; and therefore , when she would persist in taking it to pieces , Burr found sufficient to alleviate the embarrassment of Madame de Frontignac 's utter silence in a playful run of protestations and compliments . “ I think , Mary , ” said Madame de Frontignac , “ that we had better be returning to the house . ” This was said in the haughtiest and coolest tone imaginable , looking at the place where Burr stood , as if there were nothing there but empty air . Mary rose to go ; Madame de Frontignac offered her arm . “ Permit me to remark , ladies , ” said Burr , with the quiet suavity which never forsook him , “ that your very agreeable occupations have caused time to pass more rapidly than you are aware . I think you will find that the tide has risen so as to intercept the path by which you came here . You will hardly be able to get around the point of rocks without some assistance . ” Mary looked a few paces ahead , and saw , a little before them , a fresh afternoon breeze driving the rising tide high on to the side of the rocks , at whose foot their course had lain . The nook in which they had been sporting formed part of a shelving ledge which inclined over their heads , and which it was just barely possible could be climbed by a strong and agile person , but which would be wholly impracticable to a frail , unaided woman . “ There is no time to be lost , ” said Burr , coolly , measuring the possibilities with that keen eye that was never discomposed by any exigency . “ I am at your service , ladies ; I can either carry you in my arms around this point , or assist you up these rocks . ” He paused and waited for their answer . Madame de Frontignac stood pale , cold , and silent , hearing only the wild beating of her heart . “ I think , ” said Mary , “ that we should try the rocks . ” “ Very well , ” said Burr ; and placing his gloved hand on a fragment of rock somewhat above their heads , he swung himself up to it with an easy agility ; from this he stretched himself down as far as possible towards them , and , extending his hand , directed Mary , who stood foremost , to set her foot on a slight projection , and give him both her hands ; she did so , and he seemed to draw her up as easily as if she had been a feather . He placed her by him on a shelf of rock , and turned again to Madame de Frontignac ; she folded her arms and turned resolutely away towards the sea . Just at that moment a coming wave broke at her feet . “ There is no time to be lost , ” said Burr ; “ there 's a tremendous surf coming in , and the next wave may carry you out . ” “ Tant mieux ! ” she responded , without turning her head . “ Oh , Virginie ! Virginie ! ” exclaimed Mary , kneeling and stretching her arms over the rock ; but another voice called Virginie , in a tone which went to her heart . She turned and saw those dark eyes full of tears . “ Oh , come ! ” he said , with that voice which she never could resist . She put her cold , trembling hands into his , and he drew her up and placed her safely beside Mary . A few moments of difficult climbing followed , in which his arm was thrown now around one and then around the other , and they felt themselves carried with a force as if the slight and graceful form were strung with steel . Placed in safety on the top of the bank , there was a natural gush of grateful feeling towards their deliverer . The severest resentment , the coolest moral disapprobation , are necessarily somewhat softened , when the object of them has just laid one under a personal obligation . Burr did not seem disposed to press his advantage , and treated the incident as the most matter-of-course affair in the world . He offered an arm to each lady , with the air of a well-bred gentleman who offers a necessary support ; and each took it , because neither wished , under the circumstances , to refuse . He walked along leisurely homeward , talking in that easy , quiet , natural way in which he excelled , addressing no very particular remark to either one , and at the door of the cottage took his leave , saying , as he bowed , that he hoped neither of them would feel any inconvenience from their exertions , and that he should do himself the pleasure to call soon and inquire after their health . Madame de Frontignac made no reply ; but curtsied with a stately grace , turned and went into her little , room , whither Mary , after a few minutes , followed her . She found her thrown upon the bed , her face buried in the pillow , her breast heaving as if she were sobbing ; but when , at Mary 's entrance , she raised her head , her eyes were bright and dry . “ It is just as I told you , Mary ,— that man holds me . I love him yet , in spite of myself . It is in vain to be angry . What is the use of striking your right hand with your left ? When we love one more than ourselves , we only hurt ourselves with our anger . ” “ But , ” said Mary , “ love is founded on respect and esteem ; and when that is gone ” —— “ Why , then , ” said Madame , “ we are very sorry ,— but we love yet . Do we stop loving ourselves when we have lost our own self-respect ? No ! it is so disagreeable to see , we shut our eyes and ask to have the bandage put on ,— you know that , poor little heart ! You can think how it would have been with you , if you had found that he was not what you thought . ” The word struck home to Mary 's consciousness ,— but she sat down and took her friend in her arms with an air self-controlled , serious , rational . “ I see and feel it all , dear Virginie , but I must stand firm for you . You are in the waves , and I on the shore . If you are so weak at heart , you must not see this man any more . ” “ But he will call . ” “ I will see him for you . ” “ What will you tell him , my heart ?— tell him that I am ill , perhaps ? ” “ No ; I will tell him the truth ,— that you do not wish to see him . ” “ That is hard ;— he will wonder . ” “ I think not , ” said Mary , resolutely ; “ and furthermore , I shall say to him , that , while Madame de Frontignac is at the cottage , it will not be agreeable for us to receive calls from him . ” “ Mary , ma ch è re , you astonish me ! ” “ My dear friend , ” said Mary , “ it is the only way . This man — this cruel , wicked , deceitful man — must not be allowed to trifle with you in this way . I will protect you . ” And she rose up with flashing eye and glowing cheek , looking as her father looked when he protested against the slave-trade . “ Thou art my Saint Catharine , ” said Virginie , rising up , excited by Mary 's enthusiasm , “ and hast the sword as well as the palm ; but , dear saint , do n't think so very , very badly of him ;— he has a noble nature ; he has the angel in him . ” “ The greater his sin , ” said Mary ; “ he sins against light and love . ” “ But I think his heart is touched ,— I think he is sorry . Oh , Mary , if you had only seen how he looked at me when he put out his hands on the rocks !— there were tears in his eyes ” “ Well there might be ! ” said Mary ; “ I do not think he is quite a fiend ; no one could look at those cheeks , dear Virginie , and not feel sad , that saw you a few months ago . ” “ Am I so changed ? ” she said , rising and looking at herself in the mirror . “ Sure enough ,— my neck used to be quite round ;— now you can see those two little bones , like rocks at low tide . Poor Virginie ! her summer is gone , and the leaves are falling ; poor little cat ! ” — and Virginie stroked her own chestnut head , as if she had been pitying another , and began humming a little Norman air , with a refrain that sounded like the murmur of a brook over the stones . The more Mary was touched by these little poetic ways , which ran just on an even line between the gay and the pathetic , the more indignant she grew with the man that had brought all this sorrow . She felt a saintly vindictiveness , and a determination to place herself as an adamantine shield between him and her friend . There is no courage and no anger like that of a gentle woman , when once fully roused ; if ever you have occasion to meet it , you will certainly remember the hour . CHAPTER XXXII . PLAIN TALK . Mary revolved the affairs of her friend in her mind , during the night . The intensity of the mental crisis through which she had herself just passed had developed her in many inward respects , so that she looked upon life no longer as a timid girl , but as a strong , experienced woman . She had thought , and suffered , and held converse with eternal realities , until thousands of mere earthly hesitations and timidities , that often restrain a young and untried nature , had entirely lost their hold upon her . Besides , Mary had at heart the true Puritan seed of heroism ,— never absent from the souls of true New England women . Her essentially Hebrew education , trained in daily converse with the words of prophets and seers , and with the modes of thought of a people essentially grave and heroic , predisposed her to a kind of exaltation , which , in times of great trial , might rise to the heights of the religious — sublime , in which the impulse of self-devotion took a form essentially commanding . The very intensity of the repression under which her faculties had developed seemed , as it were , to produce a surplus of hidden strength , which came out in exigencies . Her reading , though restricted to a few volumes , had been of the kind that vitalized and stimulated a poetic nature , and laid up in its chambers vigorous words and trenchant phrases , for the use of an excited feeling ,— so that eloquence came to her as a native gift . She realized , in short , in her higher hours , the last touch with which Milton finishes his portrait of an ideal woman :— “ Greatness of mind and nobleness their seat Build in her loftiest , and create an awe About her as a guard angelic placed . ” The next , morning , Colonel Burr called at the cottage . Mary was spinning in the garret , and Madame de Frontignac was reeling yarn , when Mrs. Scudder brought this announcement . “ Mother , ” said Mary , “ I wish to see Mr. Burr alone . Madame de Frontignac will not go down . ” Mrs. Scudder looked surprised , but asked no questions . When she was gone down , Mary stood a moment reflecting ; Madame de Frontignac looked eager and agitated . “ Remember and notice all he says , and just how he looks , Mary , so as to tell me ; and be sure and say that I thank him for his kindness yesterday . We must own he appeared very well there ; did he not ? ” “ Certainly , ” said Mary ; “ but no man could have done less . ” “ Ah ! but , Mary , not every man could have done it as he did . Now do n't be too hard on him , Mary ;— I have said dreadful things to him ; I am afraid I have been too severe . After all , these distinguished men are so tempted ! we do n't know how much they are tempted ; and who can wonder that they are a little spoiled ? So , my angel , you must be merciful . ” “ Merciful ! ” said Mary , kissing the pale cheek , and feeling the cold little hands that trembled in hers . “ So you will go down in your little spinning-toilette , mimi ? I fancy you look as Joan of Arc did , when she was keeping her sheep at Domremy . Go , and God bless thee ! ” and Madame de Frontignac pushed her playfully forward . Mary entered the room where Burr was seated , and wished him good-morning , in a serious and placid manner , in which there was not the slightest trace of embarrassment or discomposure . “ Shall I have the pleasure of seeing your fair companion this morning ? ” said Burr , after some moments of indifferent conversation . “ No , Sir ; Madame de Frontignac desires me to excuse her to you . ” “ Is she ill ? ” said Burr , with a look of concern . “ No , Mr. Burr , she prefers not to see you . ” Burr gave a start of well-bred surprise , and Mary added , “ Madame de Frontignac has made me familiar with the history of your acquaintance with her ; and you will therefore understand what I mean , Mr. Burr , when I say , that , during the time of her stay with us , we should prefer not to receive calls from you . ” “ Your language , Miss Scudder , has certainly the merit of explicitness . ” “ I intend it shall have , Sir , ” said Mary , tranquilly ; “ half the misery in the world comes of want of courage to speak and to hear the truth plainly and in a spirit of love . ” “ I am gratified that you add the last clause , Miss Scudder ; I might not otherwise recognize the gentle being whom I have always regarded as the impersonation of all that is softest in woman . I have not the honor of understanding in the least the reason of this apparently capricious sentence , but I bow to it in submission . ” “ Mr. Burr , ” said Mary , walking up to him , and looking him full in the eyes , with an energy that for the moment bore down his practised air of easy superiority , “ I wish to speak to you for a moment , as one immortal soul should to another , without any of those false glosses and deceits which men call ceremony and good manners . You have done a very great injury to a lovely lady , whose weakness ought to have been sacred in your eyes . Precisely because you are what you are ,— strong , keen , penetrating , and able to control and govern all who come near you ,— because you have the power to make yourself agreeable , interesting , fascinating , and to win esteem and love ,— just for that reason you ought to hold yourself the guardian of every woman , and treat her as you would wish any man to treat your own daughter . I leave it to your conscience , whether this is the manner in which you have treated Madame de Frontignac . ” “ Upon my word , Miss Scudder , ” began Burr , “ I cannot imagine what representations our mutual friend may have been making . I assure you , our intercourse has been as irreproachable as the most scrupulous could desire . ” “ Irreproachable !— scrupulous !— Mr . Burr , you know that you have taken the very life out of her . You men can have everything ,— ambition , wealth , power ; a thousand ways are open to you : women have nothing but their heart ; and when that is gone , all is gone . Mr. Burr , you remember the rich man who had flocks and herds , but nothing would do for him but he must have the one little ewe-lamb which was all his poor neighbor had . Thou art the man ! You have stolen all the love she had to give ,— all that she had to make a happy home ; and you can never give her anything in return , without endangering her purity and her soul ,— and you knew you could not . I know you men think this is a light matter ; but it is death to us . What will this woman 's life be ? one long struggle to forget ; and when you have forgotten her , and are going on gay and happy ,— when you have thrown her very name away as a faded flower , she will be praying , hoping , fearing for you ; though all men deny you , yet will not she . Yes , Mr. Burr , if ever your popularity and prosperity should leave you and those who now flatter should despise and curse you , she will always be interceding with her own heart and with God for you , and making a thousand excuses where she cannot deny ; and if you die , as I fear you have lived , unreconciled to the God of your fathers , it will be in her heart to offer up her very soul for you , and to pray that God will impute all your sins to her , and give you heaven . Oh , I know this , because I have felt it in my own heart ! ” and Mary threw herself passionately down into a chair , and broke into an agony of uncontrolled sobbing . Burr turned away , and stood looking through the window ; tears were dropping silently , unchecked by the cold , hard pride which was the evil demon of his life . It is due to our human nature to believe that no man could ever have been so passionately and enduringly loved and revered by both men and women as he was , without a beautiful and lovable nature ;— no man ever demonstrated more forcibly the truth , that it is not a man 's natural constitution , but the use he makes of it , which stamps him as good or vile . The diviner part of him was weeping , and the cold , proud demon was struggling to regain his lost ascendency . Every sob of the fair , inspired child who had been speaking to him seemed to shake his heart ,— he felt as if he could have fallen on his knees to her ; and yet that stoical habit which was the boast of his life , which was the sole wisdom he taught to his only and beautiful daughter , was slowly stealing back round his heart ,— and he pressed his lips together , resolved that no word should escape till he had fully mastered himself . In a few moments Mary rose with renewed calmness and dignity , and , approaching him , said ,— “ Before I wish you good-morning , Mr. Burr , I must ask pardon for the liberty I have taken in speaking so very plainly . ” “ There is no pardon needed , my dear child , ” said Burr , turning and speaking very gently , and with a face expressive of a softened concern ; “ if you have told me harsh truths , it was with gentle intentions ;— I only hope that I may prove , at least by the future , that I am not altogether so bad as you imagine . As to the friend whose name has been passed between us , no man can go beyond me in a sense of her real nobleness ; I am sensible how little I can ever deserve the sentiment with which she honors me . I am ready , in my future course , to obey any commands that you and she may think proper to lay upon me . ” “ The only kindness you can now do her , ” said Mary , “ is to leave her . It is impossible that you should be merely friends ;— it is impossible , without violating the holiest bonds , that you should be more . The injury done is irreparable ; but you can avoid adding another and greater one to it . ” Burr looked thoughtful . “ May I say one thing more ? ” said Mary , the color rising in her cheeks . Burr looked at her with that smile that always drew out the confidence of every heart . “ Mr. Burr , ” she said , “ you will pardon me , but I cannot help saying this : You have , I am told , wholly renounced the Christian faith of your fathers , and build your whole life on quite another foundation . I cannot help feeling that this is a great and terrible mistake . I cannot help wishing that you would examine and reconsider . ” “ My dear child , I am extremely grateful to you for your remark , and appreciate fully the purity of the source from which it springs . Unfortunately , our intellectual beliefs are not subject to the control of our will . I have examined , and the examination has , I regret to say , not had the effect you would desire . ” Mary looked at him wistfully ; he smiled and bowed ,— all himself again ; and stopping at the door , he said , with a proud humility ,— “ Do me the favor to present my devoted regard to your friend ; believe me , that hereafter you shall have less reason to complain of me . ” He bowed , and was gone . An eye-witness of the scene has related , that , when Burr resigned his seat as President of his country 's Senate , an object of peculiar political bitterness and obloquy , almost all who listened to him had made up their minds that he was an utterly faithless , unprincipled man ; and yet , such was his singular and peculiar personal power , that his short farewell-address melted the whole assembly into tears , and his most embittered adversaries were charmed into a momentary enthusiasm of admiration . It must not be wondered at , therefore , if our simple-hearted , loving Mary strangely found all her indignation against him gone , and herself little disposed to criticize the impassioned tenderness with which Madame de Frontignac still regarded him . We have one thing more that we cannot avoid saying , of two men so singularly in juxtaposition as Aaron Burr and Dr. Hopkins . Both had a perfect logic of life , and guided themselves with an inflexible rigidity by it . Burr assumed individual pleasure to be the great object of human existence ; Dr. Hopkins placed it in a life altogether beyond self . Burr rejected all sacrifice ; Hopkins considered sacrifice as the foundation of all existence . To live as far as possible without a disagreeable sensation was an object which Burr proposed to himself as the summum bonum , for which he drilled down and subjugated a nature of singular richness . Hopkins , on the other hand , smoothed the asperities of a temperament naturally violent and fiery by a rigid discipline which guided it entirely above the plane of self-indulgence ; and , in the pursuance of their great end , the one watched against his better nature as the other did against his worse . It is but fair , then , to take their lives as the practical workings of their respective ethical creeds . CHAPTER XXXIII . NEW ENGLAND IN FRENCH EYES . We owe our readers a digression at this point , while we return for a few moments to say a little more of the fortunes of Madame de Frontignac , whom we left waiting with impatience for the termination of the conversation between Mary and Burr . “ Enfin , ch è re Sybille , ” said Madame de Frontignac , when Mary came out of the room , with her cheeks glowing and her eye flashing with a still unsubdued light , “ te voil à encore ! What did he say , mimi ?— did he ask for me ? ” “ Yes , ” said Mary , “ he asked for you . ” “ What did you tell him ? ” “ I told him that you wished me to excuse you . ” “ How did he look then ?— did he look surprised ? ” “ A good deal so , I thought , ” said Mary . “ Allons , mimi ,— tell me all you said , and all he said . ” “ Oh , ” said Mary , “ I am the worst person in the world ; in fact , I cannot remember anything that I have said ; but I told him that he must leave you , and never see you any more . ” “ Oh , mimi , never ! ” Madame de Frontignac sat down on the side of the bed with such a look of utter despair as went to Mary 's heart . “ You know that it is best , Virginie ; do you not ? ” “ Oh , yes , I know it ; mais pourtant , c'est dur comme la mort . Ah , well , what shall Virginie do now ? ” “ You have your husband , ” said Mary . “ Je ne l'aime point , ” said Madame de Frontignac . “ Yes , but he is a good and honorable man , and you should love him . ” “ Love is not in our power , ” said Madame de Frontignac . “ Not every kind of love , ” said Mary , “ but some kinds . If you have a kind , indulgent friend who protects you and cares for you , you can be grateful to him , you can try to make him happy , and in time you may come to love him very much . He is a thousand times nobler man , if what you say is true , than the one who has injured you so . ” “ Oh , Mary ! ” said Madame de Frontignac , “ there are some cases where we find it too easy to love our enemies . ” “ More than that , ” said Mary ; “ I believe , that , if you go on patiently in the way of duty , and pray daily to God , He will at last take out of your heart this painful love , and give you a true and healthy one . As you say , such feelings are very sweet and noble ; but they are not the only ones we have to live by ;— we can find happiness in duty , in self-sacrifice , in calm , sincere , honest friendship . That is what you can feel for your husband . ” “ Your words cool me , ” said Madame de Frontignac ; “ thou art a sweet snow-maiden , and my heart is hot and tired . I like to feel thee in my arms , ” she said , putting her arms around Mary , and resting her head upon her shoulder . “ Talk to me so every day , and read me good cool verses out of that beautiful Book , and perhaps by-and-by I shall grow still and quiet like you . ” Thus Mary soothed her friend ; but every few days this soothing had to be done over , as long as Burr remained in Newport . When he was finally gone , she grew more calm . The simple , homely ways of the cottage , the healthful routine of daily domestic toils , into which she delighted to enter , brought refreshment to her spirit . That fine tact and exquisite social sympathy , which distinguish the French above other nations , caused her at once to enter into the spirit of the life in which she moved ; so that she no longer shocked any one 's religious feelings by acts forbidden by the Puritan idea of Sunday , or failed in any of the exterior proprieties of religious life . She also read and studied with avidity the English Bible , which came to her with the novelty of a wholly new book in a new language ; nor was she without a certain artistic appreciation of the austere precision and gravity of the religious life by which she was surrounded . “ It is sublime , but a little glaciale , like the Alps , ” she sometimes said to Mary and Mrs. Marvyn , when speaking of it ; “ but then , ” she added , playfully , “ there are the flowers ,— les roses des Alpes ,— and the air is very strengthening , and it is near to heaven ,— faut avouer . ” We have shown how she appeared to the eye of New England life ; it may not be uninteresting to give a letter to one of her friends , which showed how the same appeared to her . It was not a friend with whom she felt on such terms , that her intimacy with Burr would appear at all in the correspondence . “ You behold me , my charming Gabrielle , quite pastoral , recruiting from the dissipations of my Philadelphia life in a quiet cottage , with most worthy , excellent people , whom I have learned to love very much . They are good and true , as pious as the saints themselves , although they do not belong to the Church ,— a thing which I am sorry for ; but then let us hope , that , if the world is wide , heaven is wider , and that all worthy people will find room at last . This is Virginie 's own little , pet , private heresy ; and when I tell it to the Abb é, he only smiles ; and so I think , somehow , that it is not so very bad as it might be . “ We have had a very gay life in Philadelphia , and now I am growing tired of the world , and think I shall retire to my cheese , like Lafontaine 's rat . “ These people in the country here in America have a character quite their own , very different from the life of cities , where one sees , for the most part , only a continuation of the forms of good society which exist in the Old World . “ In the country , these people seem simple , grave , severe , always industrious , and , at first , cold and reserved in their manners towards each other , but with great warmth of heart . They are all obedient to the word of their minister , who lives among them just like any other man , and marries and has children . “ Everything in their worship is plain and austere ; their churches are perfectly desolate ; they have no chants , no pictures , no carvings ,— only a most disconsolate , bare-looking building , where they meet together , and sing one or two hymns , and the minister makes one or two prayers , all out of his own thoughts , and then gives them a long , long discourse about things which I cannot understand enough English to comprehend . “ There is a very beautiful , charming young girl here , the daughter of my hostess , who is as lovely and as saintly as St. Catharine , and has such a genius for religion , that , if she had been in our Church , she would certainly have been made a saint . “ Her mother is a good , worthy matron ; and the good priest lives in the family . I think he is a man of very sublime religion , as much above this world as a great mountain ; but he has the true sense of liberty and fraternity ; for he has dared to oppose with all his might this detestable and cruel trade in poor negroes , which makes us , who are so proud of the example of America in asserting the rights of men , so ashamed for her inconsistencies . “ Well , now , there is a little romance getting up in the cottage ; for the good priest has fixed his eyes on the pretty saint , and discovered , what he must be blind not to see , that she is very lovely ,— and so , as he can marry , he wants to make her his wife ; and her mamma , who adores him as if he were God , is quite set upon it . The sweet Marie , however , has had a lover of her own in her little heart , a beautiful young man , who went to sea , as heroes always do , to seek his fortune . And the cruel sea has drowned him ; and the poor little saint has wept and prayed , till she is so thin and sweet and mournful that it makes one 's heart ache to see her smile . In our Church , Gabrielle , she would have gone into a convent ; but she makes a vocation of her daily life , and goes round the house so sweetly , doing all the little work that is to be done , as sacredly as the nuns pray at the altar . For you must know , here in New England , the people , for the most part , keep no servants , but perform all the household work themselves , with no end of spinning and sewing besides . It is the true Arcadia , where you find cultivated and refined people busying themselves with the simplest toils . For these people are well-read and well-bred , and truly ladies in all things . And so my little Marie and I , we feed the hens and chickens together , and we search for eggs in the hay in the barn . And they have taught me to spin at their great wheel , and at a little one too , which makes a noise like the humming of a bee . “ But where am I ? Oh , I was telling about the romance . Well , so the good priest has proposed for my Marie , and the dear little soul has accepted him as the nun accepts the veil ; for she only loves him filially and religiously . And now they are going on , in their way , with preparations for the wedding . They had what they call ‘ a quilting ’ here the other night , to prepare the bride 's quilt ,— and all the friends in the neighborhood came ;— it was very amusing to see . “ The morals of this people are so austere , that young men and girls are allowed the greatest freedom . They associate and talk freely together , and the young men walk home alone with the girls after evening parties . And most generally , the young people , I am told , arrange their marriages among themselves before the consent of the parents is asked . This is very strange to us . I must not weary you , however , with the details . I watch my little romance daily , and will let you hear further as it progresses . “ With a thousand kisses , I am , ever , your loving “ Virginie . ” CHAPTER XXXIV . CONSULTATIONS AND CONFIDENCES . Meanwhile , the wedding-preparations were going on at the cottage with that consistent vigor with which Yankee people always drive matters when they know precisely what they are about . The wedding-day was definitely fixed for the first of August ; and each of the two weeks between had its particular significance and value precisely marked out and arranged in Mrs. Katy Scudder 's comprehensive and systematic schemes . It was settled that the newly wedded pair were , for a while at least , to reside at the cottage . It might have been imagined , therefore , that no great external changes were in contemplation ; but it is astonishing , the amount of discussion , the amount of advising , consulting , and running to and fro , which can be made to result out of an apparently slight change in the relative position of two people in the same house . Dr. H. really opened his eyes with calm amazement . Good , modest soul ! he had never imagined himself the hero of so much preparation . From morning to night , he heard his name constantly occurring in busy consultations that seemed to be going on between Miss Prissy and Mrs. Deacon Twitchel and Mrs. Scudder and Mrs. Jones , and quietly wondered what they could have so much more than usual to say about him . For a while it seemed to him that the whole house was about to be torn to pieces . He was even requested to step out of his study , one day , into which immediately entered , in his absence , two of the most vigorous women of the parish , who proceeded to uttermost measures ,— first pitching everything into pie , so that the Doctor , who returned disconsolately to look for a book , at once gave up himself and his system of divinity as entirely lost , until assured by one of the ladies , in a condescending manner , that he knew nothing about the matter , and that , if he would return after half a day , he would find everything right again ,— a declaration in which he tried to have unlimited faith , and which made him feel the advantage of a mind accustomed to believing in mysteries . And it is to be remarked , that on his return he actually found his table in most perfect order , with not a single one of his papers missing ; in fact , to his ignorant eye the room looked exactly as it did before ; and when Miss Prissy eloquently demonstrated to him , that every inch of that paint had been scrubbed , and the windows taken out , and washed inside and out , and rinsed through three waters , and that the curtains had been taken down , and washed , and put through a blue water , and starched , and ironed , and put up again ,— he only innocently wondered , in his ignorance , what there was in a man 's being married that made all these ceremonies necessary . But the Doctor was a wise man , and in cases of difficulty kept his mind to himself ; and therefore he only informed these energetic practitioners that he was extremely obliged to them , accepting it by simple faith ,— an example which , we recommend to all good men in similar circumstances . The house throughout was subjected to similar renovation . Everything in every chest or box was vigorously pulled out and hung out on lines in the clothes-yard to air ; for when once the spirit of enterprise has fairly possessed a group of women , it assumes the form of a “ prophetic fury , ” and carries them beyond themselves . Let not any ignorant mortal of the masculine gender , at such hours , rashly dare to question the promptings of the genius that inspires them . Spite of all the treatises that have lately appeared , to demonstrate that there are no particular inherent diversities between men and women , we hold to the opinion that one thorough season of house-cleaning is sufficient to prove the existence of awful and mysterious difference between the sexes , and of subtile and reserved forces in the female line , before which the lords of creation can only veil their faces with a discreet reverence , as our Doctor has done . In fact , his whole deportment on the occasion was characterized by humility so edifying as really to touch the hearts of the whole synod of matrons ; and Miss Prissy rewarded him by declaring impressively her opinion , that he was worthy to have a voice in the choosing of the wedding-dress ; and she actually swooped him up , just in a very critical part of a distinction between natural and moral ability , and conveyed him bodily , as fairy sprites knew how to convey the most ponderous of mortals , into the best room , where three specimens of brocade lay spread out upon a table for inspection . Mary stood by the side of the table , her pretty head bent reflectively downward , her cheek just resting upon the tip of one of her fingers , as she stood looking thoughtfully through the brocades at something deeper that seemed to lie under them ; and when the Doctor was required to give judgment on the articles , it was observed by the matrons that his large blue eyes were resting upon Mary , with an expression that almost glorified his face ; and it was not until his elbow was repeatedly shaken by Miss Prissy , that he gave a sudden start , and fixed his attention , as was requested , upon the silks . It had been one of Miss Prissy 's favorite theories , that “ that dear blessed man had taste enough , if he would only give his mind to things ” ; and , in fact , the Doctor rather verified the remark on the present occasion , for he looked very conscientiously and soberly at the silks , and even handled them cautiously and respectfully with his fingers , and listened with grave attention to all that Miss Prissy told him of their price and properties , and then laid his finger down on one whose snow-white ground was embellished with a pattern representing lilies of the valley on a background of green leaves . “ This is the one , ” he said , with an air of decision ; and then be looked at Mary , and smiled , and a murmur of universal approbation broke out . “ Il a de la d é licatesse , ” said Madame de Frontignac , who had been watching this scene with bright , amused eyes ,— while a chorus of loud acclamations , in which Miss Prissy 's voice took the lead , conveyed to the innocent-minded Doctor the idea , that in some mysterious way he had distinguished himself in the eyes of his feminine friends ; whereat he retired to his study slightly marvelling , but on the whole well pleased , as men generally are when they do better than they expect ; and Miss Prissy , turning out all profaner persons from the apartment , held a solemn consultation , to which only Mary , Mrs. Scudder , and Madame de Frontignac were admitted . For it is to be observed that the latter had risen daily and hourly in Miss Prissy 's esteem , since her entrance into the cottage ; and she declared , that , if she only would give her a few hints , she did n't believe but that she could make that dress look just like a Paris one ; and rather intimated that in such a case she might almost be ready to resign all mortal ambitions . The afternoon of this day , just at that cool hour when the clock ticks so quietly in a New England kitchen , and everything is so clean and put away that there seems to be nothing to do in the house , Mary sat quietly down in her room to hem a ruffle . Everybody had gone out of the house on various errands . The Doctor , with implicit faith , had surrendered himself to Mrs. Scudder and Miss Prissy , to be conveyed up to Newport , and attend to various appointments in relation to his outer man , which he was informed would be indispensable in the forthcoming solemnities . Madame de Frontignac had also gone to spend the day with some of her Newport friends . And Mary , quite well pleased with the placid and orderly stillness which reigned through the house , sat pleasantly murmuring a little tune to her sewing , when suddenly the trip of a very brisk foot was heard in the kitchen , and Miss Cerinthy Ann Twitchel made her appearance at the door , her healthy glowing cheek wearing a still brighter color from the exercise of a three-mile walk in a July day . “ Why , Cerinthy , ” said Mary , “ how glad I am to see you ! ” “ Well , ” said Cerinthy , “ I have been meaning to come down all this week , but there 's so much to do in haying-time ,— but to-day I told mother I must come . I brought these down , ” she said , unfolding a dozen snowy damask napkins , “ that I spun myself , and was thinking of you almost all the while I spun them , so I suppose they are n't quite so wicked as they might be . ” We will observe here , that Cerinthy Ann , in virtue of having a high stock of animal spirits and great fulness of physical vigor , had very small proclivities towards the unseen and spiritual , but still always indulged a secret resentment at being classed as a sinner above many others , who , as church-members , made such professions , and were , as she remarked , “ not a bit better than she was . ” She had always , however , cherished an unbounded veneration for Mary , and had made her the confidante of most of her important secrets . It soon became very evident that she had come with one on her mind now . “ Do n't you want to come and sit out in the lot ? ” she said , after sitting awhile , twirling her bonnet-strings with the air of one who has something to say and does n't know exactly how to begin upon it . Mary cheerfully gathered up her thread , scissors , and ruffling , and the two stepped over the window-sill , and soon found themselves seated cozily under the boughs of a large apple-tree , whose descending branches , meeting the tops of the high grass all around , formed a seclusion as perfect as heart could desire . They sat down , pushing away a place in the grass ; and Cerinthy Ann took off her bonnet , and threw it among the clover , exhibiting to view her black hair , always trimly arranged in shining braids , except where some glossy curls fell over the rich high , color of her cheeks . Something appeared to discompose her this afternoon . There were those evident signs of a consultation impending , which , to an experienced eye , are as unmistakable as the coming up of a shower in summer . Cerinthy began by passionately demolishing several heads of clover , remarking , as she did so , that she “ did n't see , for her part , how Mary could keep so calm when things were coming so near . ” And as Mary answered to this only with a quiet smile , she broke out again :— “ I do n't see , for my part , how a young girl could marry a minister , anyhow ; but then I think you are just cut out for it . But what would anybody say , if I should do such a thing ? ” “ I do n't know , ” said Mary , innocently . “ Well , I suppose everybody would hold up their hands ; and yet , if I do say it myself , ” — she added , coloring ,— “ there are not many girls who could make a better minister 's wife than I could , if I had a mind to try . ” “ That I am sure of , ” said Mary , warmly . “ I guess you are the only one that ever thought so , ” said Cerinthy , giving an impatient toss . “ There 's father and mother all the while mourning over me ; and yet I do n't see but what I do pretty much all that is done in the house , and they say I am a great comfort in a temporal point of view . But , oh , the groanings and the sighings that there are over me ! I do n't think it is pleasant to know that your best friends are thinking such awful things about you , when you are working your fingers off to help them . It is kind o ’ discouraging , but I do n't know what to do about it ” ;— and for a few moments Cerinthy sat demolishing buttercups , and throwing them up in the air till her shiny black head was covered with golden flakes , while her cheeks grew redder with something that she was going to say next . “ Now , Mary , there is that creature . Well , you know , he wo n't take ‘ No ’ for an answer . What shall I do ? ” “ Suppose , then , you try ‘ Yes , ’ ” said Mary , rather archly . “ Oh , pshaw ! Mary Scudder , you know better than that , now . I look like it , do n't I ? ” “ Why , yes , ” said Mary , looking at Cerinthy , deliberately ; “ on the whole , I think you do . ” “ Well ! one thing I must say , ” said Cerinthy ,— “ I can n't see what he finds in me . I think he is a thousand times too good for me . Why , you have no idea , Mary , how I have plagued him . I believe that man really is a Christian , ” she added , while something like a penitent tear actually glistened in those sharp , saucy , black eyes . “ Besides , ” she added , “ I have told him everything I could think of to discourage him . I told him that I had a bad temper , and did n't believe the doctrines , and could n't promise that I ever should ; and after all , that creature keeps right on , and I do n't know what to tell him . ” “ Well , ” said Mary , mildly , “ do you think you really love him ? ” “ Love him ? ” said Cerinthy , giving a great flounce , “ to be sure I do n't ! Catch me loving any man ! I told him last night I did n't ; but it did n't do a bit of good . I used to think that man was bashful , but I declare I have altered my mind ; he will talk and talk till I do n't know what to do . I tell you , Mary , he talks beautifully , too , sometimes . ” Here Cerinthy turned quickly away , and began reaching passionately after clover-heads . After a few moments , she resumed :— “ The fact is , Mary , that man needs somebody to take care of him ; for he never thinks of himself . They say he has got the consumption ; but he has n't , any more than I have . It is just the way he neglects himself ,— preaching , talking , and visiting ; nobody to take care of him , and see to his clothes , and nurse him up when he gets a little hoarse and run down . Well , I suppose if I am unregenerate , I do know how to keep things in order ; and if I should keep such a man 's soul in his body , I should be doing some good in the world ; because , if ministers do n't live , of course they can n't convert anybody . Just think of his saying that I could be a comfort to him ! I told him that it was perfectly ridiculous . ‘ And besides , ’ says I , ‘ what will everybody think ? ’ I thought that I had really talked him out of the notion of it last night ; but there he was in again this morning , and told me he had derived great encouragement from what I had said . Well , the poor man really is lonesome ,— his mother 's dead , and he has n't any sisters . I asked him why he did n't go and take Miss Olladine Slocum : everybody says she would make a first-rate minister 's wife . ” “ Well , and what did he say to that ? ” said Mary . “ Well , something really silly ,— about my looks , ” said Cerinthy , looking down . Mary looked up , and remarked the shining black hair , the long dark lashes lying down over the glowing cheek , where two arch dimples were nestling , and said , quietly ,— “ Probably he is a man of taste , Cerinthy ; I advise you to leave the matter entirely to his judgment . ” “ You do n't , really , Mary ! ” said the damsel , looking up . “ Do n't you think it would injure him , if I should ? ” “ I think not , materially , ” said Mary . “ Well , ” said Cerinthy , rising , “ the men will be coming home from the mowing , before I get home , and want their supper . Mother has got one of her headaches on this afternoon , so I can n't stop any longer . There is n't a soul in the house knows where anything is , when I am gone . If I should ever take it into my head to go off , I do n't know what would become of father and mother , I was telling mother , the other day , that I thought unregenerate folks were of some use in this world , any way . ” “ Does your mother know anything about it ? ” said Mary . “ Oh , as to mother , I believe she has been hoping and praying about it these three months . She thinks that I am such a desperate case , it is the only way I am to be brought in , as she calls it . That 's what set me against him at first ; but the fact is , if girls will let a man argue with them , he always contrives to get the best of it . I am kind of provoked about it , too . But , mercy on us ! he is so meek , there is no use of getting provoked at him . Well , I guess I will go home and think about it . ” As she turned to go , she looked really pretty . Her long lashes were wet with a twinkling moisture , like meadow-grass after a shower ; and there was a softened , childlike expression stealing over the careless gayety of her face . Mary put her arms round her with a gentle caressing movement , which the other returned with a hearty embrace . They stood locked in each other 's arms ,— the glowing , vigorous , strong-hearted girl , with that pale , spiritual face resting on her breast , as when the morning , songful and radiant , clasps the pale silver moon to her glowing bosom . “ Look here now , Mary , ” said Cerinthy ; “ your folks are all gone . You may as well walk with me . It 's pleasant now . ” “ Yes , I will , ” said Mary ; “ wait a minute , till I get my bonnet . ” In a few moments the two girls were walking together in one of those little pasture foot-tracks which run so cozily among huckleberry and juniper bushes , while Cerinthy eagerly pursued the subject she could not leave thinking of . Their path now wound over high ground that overlooked the distant sea , now lost itself in little copses of cedar and pitch-pine , and now there came on the air the pleasant breath of new hay , which mowers were harvesting in adjoining meadows . They walked on and on , as girls will ; because , when a young lady has once fairly launched into the enterprise of telling another all that he said , and just how he looked , for the last three months , walks are apt to be indefinitely extended . Mary was , besides , one of the most seductive little confidantes in the world . She was so pure from selfishness , so heartily and innocently interested in what another was telling her , that people in talking with her found the subject constantly increasing in interest ,— although , if they really had been called upon afterwards to state the exact portion in words which she added to the conversation , they would have been surprised to find it so small . In fact , before Cerinthy Ann had quite finished her confessions , they were more than a mile from the cottage , and Mary began to think of returning , saying that her mother would wonder where she was , when she came home . To be continued . LION LLEWELLYN . Singing , shining , beautiful May Lureth me , draweth me , all the day . Once , when the season wooed me so , Lion Llewellyn , thou lovedst to go , Pacing before or close beside , Reticent , quaint , and dignified , Roaming with me , wandering wide ; And if ever thy feet inclined , Weary with roving , to lag behind , When were my arms to aid thee slow ? “ Muver will cahwy her darlin ’ ! So ! ” Not to the pines , my warrior gray , Gray and stately and scarred as they ,— Not to the hill , or the valley glen , Shall we wander together again . Nevermore , in the dead of night , Shall I waken in cold affright ,— Waken at sounds I know too well , Growl defiant , and horrid yell , Sounds that bristle the hair , and tell Strife is raging , and blood is shed , Blood and — fur , in the conflict dread . Nevermore , from my bed , shall I Unto the chamber-window fly , There , by the wintry moon , to spy Thee on the well-sweep mounted high ,— Mounting still , from the crafty foe Creeping and crawling up below ; And , when thou canst no farther go , See thee crouch for the fearful leap Off the top of the old well-sweep , Then , with a swift and dizzy sweep , Plunge in the crusty snow knee-deep . Nor , for a lameness gotten so , Shall I nurse thee again ,— all , no ! Nevermore , from my willing hand Winning the all I can command , Shall be heard the pathetic tone , ( Solvent sufficient for heart of stone ,) Making thy simple wishes known ; Nor shall the vibrating long-drawn “ Mr — r ” Of thy tranquil thunderous purr Breathe again , to my ear attent , Bliss o'erflowing and deep content . As I fondly muse on thee , I recall the spreading tree Of thy goodly pedigree , Which , of shapely branch or bough , Hath no fairer growth than thou ; And my glance caressing now Sweeps Alas , and Och Oh-Ow , Chryssa , Christopher , What-Not , Zabdas , Bunch , Longinus , Dot , Tom , Zenobia , Nonesuch , Turvy , Topsy , Inasmuch , Zillah , Zillah Number Two , Fremont , Dayton , Tittattoo , Hiawatha , And , and If , Minnehaha , But , and Tiff , Kitty Clover , Kitty Gray , Flossy , Frolic , Fayaway , Quip , and Quirk , and Dearest Mae , Nippenicket , Dido , Puck , Minnesinger , Friar Tuck , Periwinkle , Winkle Less , Quiz , Albeit , Bonnie , Bess , Midget , Budget , Mayaret , Jocko , Sancho , Hans , Coquette , Daisy Du Da , Ditto , Pet , Pancks , and Peepy , Tilly , Tarn , Tattycoram , Zoe , Clam , Little Dorrit , Uncle Sam , Tomtit , Pug , Penelope , Ike , Ulysses , Rosalie , Punch , and Judy , Ferny Fan , Cowslip , Hecate , Caliban , Filibuster , Jonathan ,— Name them all who may , who can ; For the half has not been told Of the branches I behold On the honored parent-stem , And the later growth from them . Lion Llewellyn , faithful friend , Brave and gentle to the end , Would that I once more might hail , Like a banner on the gale , Waving slow , thy jet-ringed tail ! And thy furry coat of mail , Like the striped and spotted skin Of thy savage leopard kin , Would I might again caress With the old-time tenderness ! Why do I talk of what may not be ? For the pillow of him I fain would see Was changed long since from my motherly knee To the garden , under the willow-tree ,— Weeping-willow and flowering moss . Over it riseth nor pile nor cross ; We , who only have felt his loss , Needing no sculptured stone to tell How he battled , and how he fell , Or where sleepeth who sleeps so well . What is the destiny of his race ? Is there , I wonder , no other place Whence they come or whither they go ? Earth-existence the all they know ? Does the living intelligence Die in them with the dying sense ? Or , from the body passing hence , Does it find in another sphere Being in higher form than here ? For summers twain , the willow kept Its watch where low the warrior slept , But , on the third , a blight had crept Upon the vigor of its frame ; Nor knew we how or whence it came . Whisper it low and fearfully , The tale of ghostly mystery ; For toothless crones and graybeards said That from the presence of the dead An influence around was shed , Like warlock 's foul , unholy spell , Of malisons and curses fell , Which steeped that soil with venom dank , Of which the fated willow drank . Whether it were or were not so , At least so much as this we know , That on the willow fell decay ; And though , when all things else grew gay , It feebly strove to look as they , Yet was its summer crown of pride Worn lightly , and soon cast aside , And when Spring found it , it had died . A mound , and a stump with moss o'ergrown , Now mark the place of his rest alone . I see that the soft west-wind to-day From the cherry-trees beareth their blooms away , And wherever its fitful currents flow , Rising or falling , swift or slow , The tender petals like white wings go , Floating , eddying , wavering low , Wheeling and sinking in showers of snow ; And under their light and flickering fall , The mound , and the flowering moss , and all , Grow blanched and white as a billow 's crest . Thou that often these arms have pressed , Nestled warm to thy mistress 's breast ,— Thou that takest thy colder rest , Now , in the breathless and pulseless ground , Close , but untenderly , folded round ,— Ever , by thy drifted mound , Sleep , the Mystery , be found Most mysterious , most profound ! And through her enchanted air , Lighter than petals fair , Brooding Peace sink downward there ; And the blasted willow make Haunt perpetual , for thy sake ! TOM PAINE 'S FIRST APPEARANCE IN AMERICA . “ It were wise , nay , just , To strike with men a balance : to forgive , If not forget , their evil for their good 's sake . ” — Saul , A Drama . In the year 1774 , David Williams , a gentleman with deistical theories and scientific tastes , lived at Chelsea , near London . It was the same Williams whose tract on Political Liberty , published eight years afterward , and translated by Brissot , earned for him the dignity of citoyen Fran ç ais , when that new order was created by the Revolution . At the time we speak of , Mr. Williams kept a school for boys . Dr. Franklin , who knew him well , often visited him . On one of these occasions , it is said that Williams introduced to the American agent a bright-eyed man approaching to middle age , named Thomas Paine , who had been usher in a school and was desirous of trying his fortune in the New World . After a short conversation , Franklin was so much pleased with the intelligence of this man , that he gave him full advice with regard to his voyage and to his movements after reaching his destination , and wrote in his behalf a letter to his son-in-law , Bache , introducing him as an “ ingenious , worthy young man , ” very capable of filling the post of “ clerk , or assistant tutor in a school , or assistant surveyor . ” The “ young man ” was thirty-seven years of age when he landed in Philadelphia in the autumn of 1774 , to begin the real business of his life . He had been a staymaker , a sailor , an exciseman , a teacher , a shopkeeper , and an author , to say nothing of his twofold matrimonial experience . Such a long and various course of schooling had fitted him to become an American citizen . His father was a staymaker , a Quaker , and poor . The son was sent to a free school , where he was taught reading , writing , and arithmetic , — enough learning to be given to any man at the public expense . With these three keys , if he is made of the right material , he can open the world . At thirteen , he worked at his father 's trade ; at sixteen , he ran away and shipped on board the privateer “ Terrible , ” Captain Death : the names of both craft and captain suggest the black flag and cross-bones . Before the vessel sailed , his father interfered and brought him ashore . Luckily for him ; for , on her next cruise , the “ Terrible ” was taken into St. Malo , a prize to the “ Vengeance , ” after one of the most desperate sea-fights on record . Her captain was killed ; out of a crew of two hundred men , only twenty-six were found alive , most of them badly wounded . Visions of sea-life again lured Paine away from the shop-board . He shipped in another privateer , and this time actually served out the cruise . In 1759 , we find him living at Sandwich , a staymaker and a married man . In 1761 , he was a widower and an officer of the excise . From this position he was dismissed , for some reason which escaped both Cobbett and Cheetham , and eleven months afterward was reinstated on his own petition . In the interval , he found employment in London as usher in a school , at twenty-five pounds a year . His leisure moments he devoted to lectures on Natural Science . In 1768 , he took a second wife at Lewes , the daughter of a tobacconist ; and the father dying soon after , Paine kept the shop . Here he wrote for his brother-excisemen a petition to government for an increase of salary . Four thousand copies were published by subscription . This piece introduced him to Goldsmith , and a letter from the author to the famous Doctor still exists , requesting “ the honor of his company at the tavern for an hour or two , to partake of a bottle of wine . ” The year 1774 was an eventful one for Paine . He failed in the shop , was separated from his wife , and dismissed from his office as exciseman . After petitioning in vain to be reinstated , he determined to emigrate . His first scheme was , to establish a school for girls in Philadelphia ; but Bache procured him an engagement as assistant editor of the “ Pennsylvania Magazine , ” at fifty pounds a year . Paine 's contributions were much applauded , and soon attracted subscribers . His “ Reflections on the Life and Death of Lord Clive ” were considered admirable , but do not suit our present taste . A song on the Death of General Wolfe , still occasionally reprinted , does not rise above a low level of mediocrity . But here is a paragraph on the Mineral Riches of the Earth , which , many years later , found favor in the eyes of the surly Cheetham , and may still be read with some interest :— “ Though Nature is gay , polite , and generous abroad , she is sullen , rude , and niggardly at home ; return the visit , and she admits you with all the suspicion of a miser , and all the reluctance of an antiquated beauty retired to replenish her charms . Bred up in antediluvian notions , she has not yet acquired the European taste of receiving visitants in her dressing-room : she locks and bolts up her private recesses with extraordinary care , as if not only resolved to preserve her hoards , but to conceal her age , and hide the remains of a face that was young and lovely in the days of Adam . He that would view Nature in her undress , and partake of her internal treasures , must proceed with the resolution of a robber , if not a ravisher . She gives no invitation to follow her to the cavern ,— the external earth makes no proclamation of the interior stores , but leaves to chance and industry the discovery of the whole . In such gifts as Nature can annually recreate , she is noble and profuse , and entertains the whole world with the interest of her fortune , but watches over the capital with the care of a miser . Her gold and jewels lie concealed in the earth , in caves of utter darkness ; and hoards of wealth , heaps upon heaps , mould in the chests , like the riches of a necromancer 's cell . ” An essay against African Slavery , written for Bradford 's paper , introduced Paine to the notice of several distinguished men ,— among others , to that of Dr . Rush . Many years afterward , in a letter to Cheetham , the Doctor described his first interview with Paine . In this communication , he insinuates that he suggested the famous pamphlet and the no less famous signature , “ Common Sense . ” But in 1809 , the venerable Doctor was an old man ; and even in earlier days , his keen appreciation of “ Ille ego qui quondam ” and “ Quorum pars magna fui , ” as the choicest passages in Virgil , was good-naturedly noticed by his contemporaries . [ 1 ] See “ Climenole ” in The Portfolio , 1803 . Paine 's own account of the work is probably the true one :— “ In October , 1775 , Dr. Franklin proposed giving me such materials as were in his hands towards completing a history of the present transactions , and seemed desirous to have the first volume out the next spring . I had then formed the outlines of “ Common Sense , ” and finished nearly the first part ; and as I supposed the Doctor 's design in getting out a history was to open the new year with a new system , I expected to surprise him with a production on that subject much earlier than he thought of . ” The times were more suggestive than doctors , even when Franklin was one of them . When Paine came to America , he found the dispute with England the all-absorbing topic . The atmosphere was heavy with the approaching storm . The First Congress was in session in the autumn of that year . On the 17th of September , John Adams felt certain that the other Colonies would support Massachusetts . The Second Congress met in May , 1775 . During the winter and spring the quarrel had grown rapidly . Lexington and Concord had become national watchwords ; the army was assembled about Boston ; Washington was chosen commander-in-chief . Then came Bunker 's Hill , the siege of Boston , the attack upon Quebec . There was open war between Great Britain and her Colonies . The Americans had drawn the sword , but were unwilling to raise the flag . From the beginning of the troubles the Colonists had been consistent in their acts . Public meetings , protests , burnings in effigy , tea-riots , militia levies , congresses , skirmishes , war , followed each other in regular and logical succession ;— but theoretically they did not make out so clear a case . They had fine-drawn distinctions , not easy to appreciate at this day , between taxes levied for the purpose of raising revenue and duties imposed for the regulation of trade . Parliament could lay a duty on tobacco in a seaport , but might not make the weed excisable on a plantation ,— could break down a loom in any part of British America , could shut out all intercourse with foreign nations by the Navigation Act , but had not the legal right to make the Colonial merchant write his contracts or draw his bills on stamped paper . As to independence , very few desired it . “ Independence , ” it was the fashion to say , “ would be ruin and loss of liberty forever . ” The Colonists insisted that they were the most loyal of subjects ; but they had men and muskets ready , and were determined to resist the obnoxious acts of Parliament with both , if necessary . These arguments of our ancestors led them to an excellent conclusion , and so far are entitled to our respect ; but logically we are afraid that King George had the best of it . Before many months had passed , lagging theory was left so far in the rear by the rapid course of events , that the Colonists felt it necessary to move up a new set of principles to the van , if they wished to present a fair front to the enemy . They had raised an army , and taken the field . Unless they declared themselves a nation , they were confessedly rebels . And yet almost all hesitated . There was a deep-seated prejudice in favor of the English government , and a strong personal liking for the people . Even when it was known that the second petition to the King — Dickinson 's “ measure of imbecility ” — was disregarded , as it deserved to be , and that the Hessians were coming , and all reasonable men admitted that there was no hope for reconciliation , they still refused to abandon the pleasing delusion , and talked over the old plans for redress of grievances , and a constitutional union with the mother country . With little or no belief in the possibility of either , they stood shivering on the banks of the Rubicon , that mythical river of irretrievable self-committal , hesitating to enter its turbid waters . A few of the bolder “ shepherds of the people ” tried to urge them onward ; but no one was bold enough to dash in first and lead them through . Paine seized the opportunity . He had a mind whose eye always saw a subject , when it could perceive it at all , in its naked truth , stripped of the non-material accessories which disturb the vision of common men . He saw that reconciliation was impossible , mere rebellion folly ; and that , to succeed in the struggle , it was necessary to fight Great Britain as an equal ,— nation against nation . This course he recommended in “ Common Sense , ” published in January , 1776 . Paine told the Colonists in this pamphlet that the connection with the mother country was of no use to them , and was rapidly becoming an impossibility . “ It is not in the power of England to do this continent justice . The business of it is too weighty and too intricate to be managed with any tolerable degree of convenience by a power so distant . To be always running three or four thousand miles with a tale or a petition , waiting four or five months for an answer , which , when obtained , requires five or six more to explain it in , will in a few years be looked upon as folly and childishness . ” As to the protection of England , what is that but the privilege of contributing to her wars ? “ Our trade will always be a protection . ” “ Neutrality is a safer convoy than a man-of-war . ” “ It is the true interest of America to steer clear of European contentions , which she can never do while by her dependence on Britain she is made the make-weight in the scale of European politics . ” According to “ Common Sense , ” not only was a separation necessary and unavoidable , but the present moment was the right time to establish it . “ The time hath found us . ” The materials of war were abundant ; the union of the Colonies complete . It might be difficult , if not impossible , to form the continent into a government half a century hence . Now the task is easy . The interest of all is the same . “ There is no religious difficulty in the way . ” “ I fully believe that it is the will of the Almighty that there should be a diversity of religious opinions among us . I look upon the various denominations among us as children of the same family , differing only in what is called their Christian names . ” All things considered , “ nothing can settle our affairs so expeditiously as an open and determined declaration of independence . ” “ This proceeding may at first appear strange and difficult . A long habit of not thinking a thing wrong gives it a superficial appearance of being right ” ; but in a little time it will become familiar . “ And until independence is declared , the continent will feel itself like a man who continues putting off some unpleasant business from day to day , yet knows it must be done ; hates to set about it , wishes it over , and is continually haunted with the thoughts of its necessity . ” To this he thought it necessary to add a labored argument against kings from the Old Testament , which may possibly have had much weight with a people some of whose descendants still triumphantly quote the same holy book in favour of slavery . The King 's speech , “ a piece of finished villany ” in the eyes of true patriots , appeared in Philadelphia on the same day as “ Common Sense ” . Thus Paine was as lucky in his time of publication as in his choice of a subject . All contemporaries admit that the pamphlet produced a prodigious effect . Paine himself says ,— “ The success it met with was beyond anything since the invention of printing . I gave the copyright up to every State in the Union , and the demand ran to not less than one hundred thousand copies . ” The authorship was attributed to Dr. Franklin , to Samuel Adams , and to John Adams . It is hardly necessary to mention that the movement party , with General Washington at its head , considered Paine 's “ doctrines sound , and his reasoning unanswerable . ” Even in England , Liberals read and applauded . The pamphlet was translated into French . When John Adams went to France , he heard himself called le fameux Adams , author of “ Common Sense . ” It soon became apparent that the people were charged with Independence doctrines , and , like an electrified Leyden jar , only waited for the touch of a skilful hand to produce the explosion . “ Common Sense ” drew the spark . The winged words flew over the country and produced so rapid a change of opinion , that , in most cases , conservatives judged it useless to publish the answers they had prepared . One or two appeared . None attracted attention . About five months later , Congress declared independence ; “ as soon , ” Paine wrote , “ as ‘ Common Sense ’ could spread through such an extensive country . ” In a few years Paine asserted and believed , that , had it not been for him , the Colonial government would have continued , and the United States would never have become a nation . If we countermarch and get into the rear of Time , to borrow an expression from “ The Crisis , ” and , placing ourselves in January , 1776 , look at “ Common Sense ” from that date , we may understand without much difficulty why it produced so great an impression . Paine , as later , when he brought out the “ Rights of Man , ” caused a chord to vibrate in the popular mind which was already strung to the exact point of tension . The publication was not only timely ,— it was novel . Paine founded a new school of pamphleteering . He was the first who wrote politics for the million . The learned political dissertations of Junius Brutus , Publius , or Philanglus were guarded in expression , semi-metaphysical in theory , and Johnsonian in style . They were relished by comparatively few readers ; [ 1 ] but the shrewd illustrations of “ Common Sense , ” the homely force of its statements , and its concise and muscular English stirred the mind of every class . Even Paine 's coarse epithets , “ Common Ruffian , ” “ Royal Brute of Britain , ” and the like , which offended the taste of the leaders of the American party ,— for party-leaders were gentlemen in 1776 ,— had as much weight with the rank-and-file as his arguments . Compare , for instance , Judge Drayton 's Independence Charge to the Grand Jury of Charleston , delivered April 23 , 1776 , with “ Common Sense . ” Paine became suddenly famous . General Charles Lee said “ that he burst upon the world like Jove , in thunder . ” His acquaintance was sought by all who were of the true faith in Independence ; and when , soon afterward , he visited New York , he carried with him letters from Dr. Franklin and John Adams , introducing him to the principal residents “ as a citizen of the world , the celebrated author of ‘ Common Sense . ’ ” Had he been a man of fortune or American-born , he might have reached a place in the foremost rank of the Fathers of the Country . But nativism was powerful , and position important at that time , as Lee and Gates and even Hamilton himself experienced . The signature , “ Common Sense , ” Paine preserved through life . It became what our authorlings , who ought to know better , will persist in calling a nom [ 1 ] de plume — a Yankee affectation , unknown to French idioms . They generally spell it “ nomme . ” In the autumn of 1776 , Paine joined the army as volunteer aide-de-camp to General Greene , and served through the gloomy campaign which opened with the loss of New York in September . He remained in the field until the army went into winter-quarters after the battles of Trenton and Princeton . It was not as a combatant that Paine did the States good service . He played the part of Tyraetus in prose ,— an adaptation of the old Greek lyrist to the eighteenth century and to British America ,— and cheered the soldiers , not with songs , but with essays , continuations of “ Common Sense . ” The first one was written on the retreat from Fort Lee , and published under the name of “ The Crisis , ” on the 23d of December , when misfortune and severe weather had cast down the stoutest hearts . It began with the well-known phrase , “ ‘ These are the times that try men 's souls . ’ The summer soldier and the sunshine patriot will in this crisis shrink from the service of his country ; but he that stands it now deserves the love and thanks of man and woman . ” — “ But after all , ” he continues , “ matters might be worse . Howe has done very little . Fort Washington and Fort Lee were no loss to us . The retreat was admirably planned and conducted . General Washington is the right man for the place , ‘ with a mind that can even nourish upon care . ’ ” He closes with a cheerful sketch of the spirit and condition of the army , attacks the Tories , and appeals to the Colonies for union and contributions . This “ Crisis ” produced the best effect at home ; in England it had the honor of being burned by the hangman . The succeeding “ Crisises ” were brought out at irregular intervals , whenever the occasion seemed to demand Paine 's attention ; some of them not longer than a leader in a daily paper ; others swollen to pamphlet dimensions . They were read by every corporal 's guard in the army , and printed in every town of every State on brown or yellow paper ; for white was rarely to be obtained . In their hours of despondency , the Colonists took consolation and courage from the “ Crisis . ” “ Never , ” says a contemporary , “ was a writer better calculated for the meridian under which he wrote , or who knew how to adapt himself more happily to every circumstance ... Even Cheetham admits , that to the army Paine 's pen was an appendage almost as necessary and as formidable as its cannon . ” The next campaign opened gloomily for the Colonies . The Tories felt certain of victory . In the political almanac of that party , 1777 was “ the year with three gallows in it . ” The English held New York and ravaged the Jerseys on their way to Philadelphia . Howe issued a proclamation “ commanding all congresses and committees to desist and cease from their treasonable doings , ” promising pardon to all who should come in and take the oath of allegiance . Paine met him with a “ Crisis . ” “ By what means , ” he asked , “ do you expect to conquer America ? If you could not effect it in the summer , when our army was less than yours , nor in the winter , when we had none , how are you to do it ? If you obtain possession of this city , [ Philadelphia ,] you could do nothing with it but plunder it ; it would be only an additional dead-weight on your hands . You have both an army and a country to contend with . You may march over the country , but you cannot hold it ; if you attempt to garrison it , your army would be like a stream of water running to nothing . Even were our men to disperse , every man to his home , engaging to reassemble at some future day , you would be as much at a loss in that case as now . You would be afraid to send out your troops in detachments ; when we returned , the work would be all to do . ” Paine then turns to those who , frightened by the proclamation , betrayed their country , and paints their folly and its punishment . In speaking of them , he calls upon the Pennsylvania Council of Safety to take into serious consideration the case of the Quakers , whose published protest against breaking off the “ happy connection ” seemed to Paine of a treasonable nature . “ They have voluntarily read themselves out of the Continental meeting , ” he adds , with a humor , doubtless , little relished by the Friends , “ and cannot hope to be restored to it again , but by payment and penitence . ” In April , Paine was elected , on motion of John Adams , Secretary to the Congressional Committee on Foreign Affairs , with a salary of seventy dollars a month . When Philadelphia surrendered , he accompanied Congress in the flight to Lancaster . The day after the affair at Brandywine , a short “ Crisis ” appeared , explaining the accidents which had caused the defeat of the Continentals , and insisting that the good cause was safe , and that Howe 's victories were no better than defeats . Paine was right . The Americans were gaining more ground in Northern New York than they had lost in Pennsylvania . Burgoyne , who , “ Unconscious of impending fates , Could push through woods , but not through Gates , ” had capitulated . The news reached Philadelphia on the 18th of October . This winter ought to have closed the war . The alliance with France , Burgoyne 's capture , two campaigns without useful results , Washington 's admirable patience and management at Valley Forge , with starvation and mutiny in the ranks and disaffection to his person in the officers of the Gates faction , ought to have convinced every Englishman in America that the attempt to reduce the Colonies was now hopeless . Paine was so indignant with the reckless obstinacy of the British government , that he conceived the idea of carrying the war into England with pen and paper ,— weapons he began to think invincible in his hands . “ If I could get over to England , ” he wrote to his old chief , General Greene , “ without being known , and only remain in safety until I could get out a proclamation , I could open the eyes of the country with respect to the madness and stupidity of its government . ” Greene had no confidence in the success of this appeal to the English people , and advised Paine not to attempt it . In the mean time the French fleet had arrived , bringing M. G é rard , the first foreign minister to the United States , and with him trouble to Thomas Paine . It is well known that the French government employed Beaumarchais , the author of the “ Barber of Seville , ” as their agent to furnish secret supplies to the American insurgents , and that Beaumarchais imagined a firm , Rodrigue Hortalez & Co ., who shipped to the United Colonies munitions of war furnished by the King , and were to receive return cargoes of tobacco , to keep up mercantile appearances . Silas Deane , a member of Congress from Connecticut , represented the Americans in the business . In 1777 , Congress , out of patience with Deane for his foolish contracts with foreign officers , recalled him . He returned , bringing with him a claim of Beaumarchais for the cargoes already shipped to the United States . As Deane could produce no vouchers , and Arthur Lee had cautioned Congress against his demands , the claim was laid on the table until the vouchers should be presented . Deane , confiding in the support of his numerous friends , appealed to the public in a newspaper . Congress bore this indignity so amiably ,— refusing , indeed , by a small majority to take notice of it ,— that Henry Laurens , the president , who had laid Deane 's appeal before them for their action , resigned in disgust , and was succeeded by John Jay . But Paine , whose position as Foreign Secretary enabled him to know that the supplies had come from the French government , and not from Beaumarchais , answered Deane in several newspaper articles , entitled , “ Common Sense to the Public on Mr. Deane 's Affairs . ” In these he exposed the whole claim with his usual unmitigated directness . M. G é rard immediately announced officially that Paine 's papers were false , and called upon Congress to declare them so and to pay the claim . Party feeling ran high on this question ,— a foreshadowing of the French and English factions fifteen years later . Congress passed a resolution in censure of Paine . Mr. Laurens moved that he be heard in his defence ; the motion was lost , and Paine resigned his office . A motion from the Deane party to refuse his resignation and to discharge him was also lost ,— the Northern States voting generally in Paine 's favor . His resignation was then accepted . As the French government persisted in denying that the King had furnished any supplies , Congress admitted the debt , and in October , 1779 , drew bills on Dr. Franklin in favor of Beaumarchais , for two millions and a half of francs , at three years ’ sight . Beaumarchais negotiated the bills , built a fine hotel , and lived en prince . But neither he nor Deane was satisfied . They still demanded another million . We have no doubt that Paine was correct in his facts , however injudicious it may have been to use them in his position . Deane 's best friends gave him up , before many years had passed . M. de Lom é nie , in his interesting sketch of Beaumarchais , has tried hard to show the justice of his demands on the United States , but without much success . He does not attempt to explain how Beaumarchais , notoriously penniless in 1775 , should have had in 1777 a good claim for three millions ’ worth of goods furnished . The American public looked upon Paine as a victim to state policy , and his position with his friends did not suffer at all in consequence of his disclosures . Personally , he exulted in his conduct to the end of his life , and took pleasure in watching and recording Deane 's disreputable career and miserable end . “ As he rose like a rocket , so he fell like the stick , ” a metaphor which has passed into a proverb , was imagined by Paine to meet Deane 's case . [ 1 ] The immediate consequence of Paine 's resignation was to oblige him to hire himself out as clerk to an attorney in Philadelphia . In his office , Paine earned his daily bread by copying law-papers until he was appointed clerk to the Assembly of Pennsylvania . This Beaumarchais claim was kept alive until the beginning of the present generation . In 1794 , Gouverneur Morris , Minister to the French Republic , obtained from the Minister of Finance a receipt to the Crown for a million of francs , signed by Beaumarchais , and sent it home to meet the claim which had again been presented . In 1806 it reappeared , urged by the Imperial Ambassador . In 1816 , the Duc de Richelieu , minister of Louis XVIII ., sustained it , and declared , on the strength of Gerard 's assertions , that the million receipt did not in any way concern the United States . In 1824 , the daughter of Beaumarchais came to this country to solicit Congress in person , with no better success . But at last , in 1835 , when our claim of twenty-five millions on France was settled , eight hundred thousand francs were allowed to the heirs of Beaumarchais , and the business closed forever ,— not creditably to us . The claim was probably unfounded ; but our government admitted its validity by the fact of payment ; and the money , if due , ought to have been paid forty years before , or a suitable compensation made for the long delay . To be Liberals in borrowing and Conservatives in repayment is not a desirable financial character for a nation to obtain . Early in May , 1780 , while the Assembly of Pennsylvania was receiving petitions from all parts of the State , praying for exemption from taxes , a letter was brought to the speaker from General Washington , and read to the House by Paine as clerk . It stated simply that the army was in the utmost distress from the want of every necessary which men could need and yet retain life ; and that the symptoms of discontent and mutiny were so marked that the General dreaded the event of every hour . “ When the letter was read , ” says Paine , “ I observed a despairing silence in the House . Nobody spoke for a considerable time . At length a member , of whose fortitude I had a high opinion , rose . ‘ If , ’ said he , ‘ the account in that letter is true , and we are in the situation there represented , it appears to me in vain to contend the matter any longer . We may as well give up first as last . ’ A more cheerful member endeavored to dissipate the gloom of the House , and moved an adjournment , which was carried , ” Paine , who knew that the Assembly had neither money nor credit , felt that the voluntary aid of individuals could alone be relied upon in this conjuncture . He accordingly wrote a letter to a friend in Philadelphia , a man of influence , explaining the urgency of affairs , and inclosed five hundred dollars , the amount of the salary due him as clerk , as his contribution towards a relief fund . The Philadelphian called a meeting at the coffee-house , read Paine 's communication , and proposed a subscription , heading the list with two hundred pounds in good money . Mr. Robert Morris put his name down for the same sum . Three hundred thousand pounds , Pennsylvania currency , were raised ; and it was resolved to establish a bank with the fund for the relief of the army . This plan was carried out with the best results . After Morris was appointed Superintendent of Finances , he developed it into the Bank of North America , which was incorporated both by act of Congress and by the State of Pennsylvania . Paine followed up his letter by a “ Crisis Extraordinary . ” Admitting that the war costs the Colonists a very large sum , he shows that it is trifling , compared with the burdens the English have to bear . For this reason it would be less expensive for the Americans to raise almost any amount to drive the English out than to submit to them and come under their system of taxation . Our ancestors read the “ Crisis Extraordinary , ” and understood every word of it , we may be sure . Paine 's lucidity of statement is never more remarkable than when he handles financial questions . But conviction did not work its way down to the pocket . Few men gave who could avoid it , and each State appeared more fearful of paying , by accident , a larger sum than its neighbor , than of the success of the British arms . Congress , finding it at last almost impossible to get money or even provisions at home , resolved to resort again to the financial expedient which has proved so often profitable to this country , namely , to borrow in Europe . Colonel Laurens , son of the late President of Congress , was appointed commissioner to negotiate an annual loan from France of a million sterling during the continuation of the war . Paine accompanied him at his request . They sailed in February , 1781 , and were graciously received by King Louis , who promised them six millions of livres as a present and ten millions as a loan . In little more than ten years , the American secretary , who stands respectfully and unnoticed in the presence of his Majesty of France , will sit as one of his judges in a trial for life ! Is there anything more wonderful in the transmutations of fiction than this ? Meanwhile , the future member of the Convention , as little dreaming of what was in store for him as the King , sailed for Boston with his principal . They carried with them two millions and a half in silver ,— a great help to Washington in the movement southward , which ended with the capitulation of Yorktown . While in Paris , Paine was again seized with the desire of invading England , incognito , with a pamphlet in his pocket , to open the eyes of the people . But Colonel Laurens thought no better of this scheme than General Greene , and brought his secretary safely home again . Cornwallis had surrendered , and it was evident that the war could not last much longer . The danger past , the Colonial aversion to pay Union expenses and to obey the orders of Congress became daily stronger . The want of a “ Crisis , ” as a corrective medicine for the body politic , was so much felt , that Robert Morris , with the knowledge and approbation of Washington , requested Paine to take pen in hand again , offering him , if his private affairs made it necessary , a salary for his services . Paine consented . A “ Crisis ” appeared which produced a most salutary effect . This was followed a few days later by another , in which a passage occurs which may be quoted as a specimen of Paine 's rhetorical powers . A rumor was abroad that England was treating with France for a separate peace . Paine finds it impossible to express his contempt for the baseness of the ministry who could attempt to sow dissension between such faithful allies . “ We sometimes experience sensations to which language is not equal . The conception is too bulky to be born alive , and in the torture of thinking we stand dumb . Our feelings , imprisoned by their magnitude , find no way out ; and in the struggle of expression every finger tries to be a tongue . ” It will be difficult to describe better the struggle of an indignant soul with an insufficient vocabulary . When peace was proclaimed , Paine , the untiring advocate of independence , had a right to print his “ Io Paean . ” The last “ Crisis ” announces , “ that the times that tried men 's souls were over , and the greatest and completest revolution the world ever knew gloriously and happily accomplished . ” “ America need never be ashamed to tell her birth , nor relate the stages by which she rose to empire . ” But it is to the future he bids her look , rather than to the past . “ The remembrance of what is past , if it operates rightly , must inspire her with the most laudable of all ambition , that of adding to the fair fame she began with . ” “ She is now descending to the scenes of quiet and domestic life ,— not beneath the cypress shade of disappointment , but to enjoy in her own land and under her own vine the sweet of her labors and the reward of her toil . In this situation may she never forget that a fair national reputation is of as much importance as independence ,— that it possesses a charm that wins upon the world , and makes even enemies civil ,— that it gives a dignity which is often superior to power , and commands reverence where pomp and splendor fail . ” As indispensable to a future of prosperity and dignity , he warmly recommends the Union . “ I ever feel myself hurt , ” he says , “ when I hear the Union , that great Palladium of our liberty and safety , the least irreverently spoken of . It is the most sacred thing in the Constitution of America , and that which every man should be most proud and tender of . ” Thus he anticipated by seventy-five years our “ Union-savers ” of 1856 , few of whom dreamed that their pet phrases , or something very like them , originated with Thomas Paine . The war left Paine no richer than it found him . He had made fame , but no money , by his writings . None of the proceeds of large editions had enriched his purse . He had an exalted ideal of an author 's duty when his work is on political subjects . Louis Blanc has written somewhere , “ Le journalisme est un sacerdoce . ” This seems to have been Paine 's thought , although he may not have expressed it so sonorously ,— for there are no phrase-makers like the French . But Paine went , we suspect , much farther than Louis Blanc ; for he held that the priest ought to take no pay for his ministrations . And he acted up to this unusual theory in literary ethics . If he took out a copyright , he gave it away to some public use . As he himself said , late in life ,— “ I could never reconcile it to my principles to make money by my polities or my religion . ” “ In a great affair , where the happiness of man is at stake , I love to work for nothing ; and so fully am I under the influence of this principle , that I should lose the spirit , the pleasure , and the pride of it , were I conscious that I looked for reward . ” His friends and admirers did not permit him to have the honor of giving not only his services , but his actual expenses , to the Republic . The State of New York presented him with a confiscated Royalist estate , near New Rochelle , three hundred acres of good land , with the necessary fences and buildings upon it . Pennsylvania voted him five hundred pounds , currency . And the Virginians were talking about making a similar donation , when an unlucky pamphlet from Paine appeared , demolishing the claim of Virginia to the Western country . This publication changed the views of the chivalry , and Paine lost his grant . He owned , besides , a small place in Bordentown ,— a gift , we believe , of the State of New Jersey . The other nine States passed him over . New England had expended enough , both of men and means , for the cause ,— and the South had fine feelings , but no money . In the autumn of 1783 , when Paine was residing at Bordentown , he received a letter from Washington , who had fixed his quarters at Rocky Hill , near Princeton , until he could resign his command to Congress . It ran thus :— “ I have learned , since I have been at this place , that you are at Bordentown ,— whether for the sake of retirement or economy ; be it for either or both , or whatever it may , I shall be exceedingly happy to see you here . “ Your presence may remind Congress of your past services to this country ; and if it is in my power to impress them , command my best exertions with freedom , as they will be rendered cheerfully by one who entertains a lively sense of the importance of your works , and who , with much pleasure , subscribes himself “ G. WASHINGTON . ” Such a letter of hearty approval and respect , from the greatest man of the country , perhaps of the age , ( we Americans , at least , all think so ,) rich , powerful , honored , is certainly a “ handsome testimonial , ” worth writing or fighting for . It was not an empty offer of service . Washington spoke to several members of Congress in Paine 's behalf , and told them that it would be pleasing to himself , as well as right and proper , to make a suitable provision for Paine . In 1785 , Congress at last granted him three thousand dollars , much of which they fairly owed him for his loss on the depreciated currency in which his salary as Secretary had been paid . Paine accepted the General 's invitation , and spent some time in his family , at Mrs. Berrian 's , Rocky Hill . One evening of his visit was devoted to setting a neighboring creek on fire . This successful experiment , as performed by the Father of his Country , assisted by Thomas Paine , General Lincoln , and Colonel Cobb , is described in a tract on the Yellow Fever , written by Paine a few years before his death , at the request of Thomas Jefferson . Until the spring of 1787 , Paine spent his time in Philadelphia or in Bordentown , writing occasionally on subjects which interested him , and indulging his taste for scientific speculations in the company of Franklin and Rittenhouse . He was a member of the American Philosophical Society , as well as an A. M. of the University of Philadelphia . His reputation , his wonderful memory , the shrewd originality of his remarks , made him a welcome guest in the best society . He was no talker or conversationist , ( an excellent word we should like to see legitimated ,) but a quiet , observing man , who spoke to the point , inoffensive in manner , and not unprepossessing in appearance . As one of the lions of the country , he was much looked at , especially by foreigners . We find a sketch of an interview with him in the Travels of the Chevalier de Chastellux . De Lafayette and himself requested permission to call “ on that author so celebrated in America and in Europe by his excellent work entitled ‘ Common Sense . ’ ” Colonel Laurens introduced them . “ His physiognomy , ” the Chevalier thinks , “ did not belie the spirit that reigns throughout his works . Our conversation was agreeable and animated , and such as to form a connection between us ; for he has written to me since my departure , and seems desirous of maintaining a constant correspondence . ” In common with most of the clever men of his day , Paine , as we have said , cultivated a taste for mechanics and natural science . There was an awakening of the mind , in physics as well as in politics , at that period ; and it must be confessed that the natural philosophers have succeeded better than the constitution-makers . Paine 's mechanical hobby was an iron bridge . A single arch , of four hundred feet span , and twenty feet in height from the chord-line , was to be thrown over the Schuylkill , near Philadelphia . The idea was suggested to him by a spider 's web , a section of which the bridge resembled ; and the principle he worked upon was , that the small segment of a large circle was preferable to the great segment of a small circle . Paine made a complete model of his bridge , in wrought iron and wood , at Bordentown ; but , finding that the insufficiency of capital and of skill in the working of iron in America would prevent him from carrying out his plan , he sailed for France to lay his model before the Acad é mie des Sciences . Franklin , who always liked him , gave him letters to the celebrated Malesherbes , Le Roy , the Abb é Morellet , the Duke de la Rochefoucauld , introducing him “ as an ingenious , honest man , author of ‘ Common Sense , ’ a famous piece , published here with great effect on the minds of people at the beginning of the Revolution . ” He had also a satisfactory credential from Congress , in the shape of the following resolution , adopted by that body in August , 1785 :— “ Resolved , That the early , unsolicited , and continued labours of Mr. Thomas Paine , in explaining and enforcing the principles of the late Revolution , by ingenious and timely publications upon the nature of Liberty and Civil Government , have been well received by the citizens of these States , and merit the approbation of Congress . ” TRIAL TRIP OF THE “ FLYING CLOUD . ” “ Through in four days to San Francisco , ” repeated I . “ Marvellous age ! ” I hastily computed the distance by an air-line , and placed the speed of the craft at some thirty miles an hour . That seemed reasonable enough . Indeed , the whole statement cohered marvellously well ; all the parts harmonized with each other and looked plausible , even reasonable , as I have said , except the grand fact itself , which was too momentous for belief . But why should it not be true ? What new achievement of the human mind ought to startle one in this nineteenth century , after having witnessed the wonders of steam and electro-magnetism ? I determined to sift the matter , but immediately remembered that all the knowledge I had of it had been imparted to me in the strictest confidence . The ingenious inventors , as was clearly their right , had reserved it to themselves to choose the time and way of making their invention public , when it was to break on the world , some fine morning , like the discovery of a second moon performing its orbit round the earth . I sunk into a brown study . In the evening , Mr. Bonflon called again , as he had promised . He brought with him a large roll of plans and drawings , for the purpose of illustrating more clearly the principles and method of construction and operation of his a ë rial ship . They were projected on a large scale , and the workmanship was superb . Months of hard labor by a finished draughtsman must have been devoted to their execution . “ And what an additional outlay of time and brains , ” thought I , “ must have been required , to devise the scheme and construct the machine itself , so as to elevate the ingenious ideal into an absolute working reality ! ” These drawings , Mr. Bonflon informed me , were duplicates of others which had been privately deposited in the Patent-Office at Washington . The one which chiefly attracted my attention was that which represented the monster steamer complete , with all its appendages and complement of passengers , in its majestic flight through the air . Below it were the drifting clouds . Its course lay quite above the storms and hurricanes and conflicting wind-currents which vex the lower strata of the atmosphere , where it comes in contact with the earth 's uneven surface , and is kept in motion by the contractions and expansions of alternate cold and heat , and is broken and set whirling by the forests and gorges and mountain-tops among which it is compelled to force its way . Above all this , Mr. Bonflon assured me , as a ë ronauts report , there is ever a smooth , quiet atmospheric sea . “ But how is life to be sustained for any considerable time in that rarefied medium ? ” inquired I , “ when it is asserted that even in ascending high mountains , the texture of the soft parts of the human body becomes so loose and flabby from diminished atmospheric pressure as to cause one , so to speak , to sweat blood ,— which oozes perceptibly from the mouth and nose and eyes , and even from under the finger-nails ? ” Mr. Bonflon pointed to a long , narrow line which floated rearward at an angle of about forty-five degrees from the point of its attachment to his ship . “ That , ” said he , “ is an India-rubber tube several thousand feet long , extending down into the respirable atmosphere , and keeping the cabins always supplied with fresh and wholesome air . ” “ But would the heavier nether air flow in that direction ? ” I asked . “ With a little help from the engine , ” he replied , “ a constant current , whenever needed , is kept up ; and the process of breathing is rendered as easy and agreeable in the cabins of the ‘ Flying Cloud ’ as in one 's own parlors at home . On the upper deck , which is not inclosed , you see , it is different . In the first trial-trip to California , Mr. M —— insisted on remaining above on this deck for six consecutive hours , and the result was an attack of hemorrhage from the lungs . On his going below , however , it almost instantly ceased . ” I must now endeavor to give the reader some definite idea of this extraordinary machine , as exhibited in the drawings . Its buoyant power was , of course , on the principle of the balloon . But the gas-chamber , or part to be inflated , instead of being globular in form , consisted of two horizontal cones joined at the base ; or more accurately still , it resembled an immense barrel extended at both ends to a point , and resting on its side . This shape was given it , according to Mr. Bonflon , that it might offer the least possible resistance to the element in which it was intended to move . In structure it was composed of a strong flexible frame of whalebone and steel , covered with silk , strengthened and rendered air-tight and water-proof by a coating of India-rubber . Its size , of course , would depend on the proposed tonnage of a particular ship . That of the working-model , as nearly as I remember , was about six hundred feet long , by some seventy or eighty in breadth in the middle , which was calculated to be amply sufficient to sustain the immense car beneath , with its engine , and fuel for a week , and three hundred passengers with their baggage ; leaving still a considerable margin for freight . Mr. Bonflon here pointed out , with great minuteness , the simple , but ingenious method devised for the inflation of this enormous machine , and the regulation of the gas ; which I pass over , from an inability to render it intelligible by mere description . The car or vessel suspended below , and to which the balloon part bore the relation of masts and sails , was fashioned after the best model of a clipper ship , but still farther elongated . Below deck , it was divided into sitting and dining cabins , state-rooms , kitchen , engine-room , and so forth ; and above was a long , railed , promenade deck . The attachment between the two parts was by means of a network of ropes , extending from every quarter , and from the whole circumference of the ship , connecting with staples in the framework of the balloon , and finally embracing its entire body in its folds . Two enormous paddle-wheels , made of oiled silk stretched on delicate frames , and driven by a steam-engine of the lightest structure possible , furnished the propelling power ; while at the stern , like a vast fin , played the helm , of a similar material and construction to the paddle-wheels . All this was explained to me in much fuller detail than I can here repeat , by Mr. Bonflon , who added , that the materials employed combined lightness with strength to a much greater degree than had ever before been achieved ,— that the fuel used was of the fluid kind , a new combination of concentrated combustibles invented by himself ,— and that the weight of the entire machine had been carefully calculated beforehand , together with its buoyant power , and the results had demonstrated the accuracy of the mathematics . I turned on Mr. Bonflon and looked him squarely in the face . He was a modest man and blushed slightly , but did not shrink . There could be no dishonesty there . His countenance bore the unmistakable stamp of integrity , as well as intelligence ; and his whole appearance and bearing were those of a true man . Had he brought me the newspaper he promised , not yet eight days old , from San Francisco ? No . He had been detained down-town all day in the whirl of our New York Babel , and had not yet been home . He would hand it in to-morrow . Mr. Bonflon had been introduced to me that morning by a friend on whose acuteness and judgment I felt I had many good reasons to rely . Without pretending any precise knowledge of the man , or , indeed , any knowledge at all , beyond what had been gathered from the individual himself in a very brief acquaintance of Mr. Bonflon 's own seeking , he expressed a warm interest in him personally , as also in the startling discovery he professed to have made . In that interview , Mr. Bonflon had informed us in brief , that , after ten years of patient and toilsome experiment , of disappointment , of perishing and reviving hope , he had at length achieved the grand object of his life . He had solved the problem of the navigation of the air . He had proved by actual results , that the great ocean of atmosphere above us could be ploughed as successfully and safely as the waters beneath , and with much greater facility and pleasure . He stated that the first trial-trip , after the completion of the ship , had been made in the night from an obscure point in the State of Maryland , and extended north and northeast , along the Atlantic coast , to New York ,— whose glow of light from a great height , like a phosphorescent mist , was plainly distinguishable ,— and thence to the neighborhood of Boston , and back to the place of starting ; and that a second , with equally favorable results , had been made from the same point by a more inland route , northwest to Buffalo and the Canada line ; and he named several well-known persons who were on board at one or the other of these times , and related some little anecdotes illustrative of their states of mind and apprehensions while drifting above the earth on the occasion of these novel voyages . He said , further , that the President and heads of departments at Washington were fully cognizant of the matter ; and that a third grand trial-trip , in the interest of government , had been secretly made , with important dispatches to California , relating to the security of our rights in the Pacific . Four days had been consumed in the passage out , including a stoppage of a couple of hours on a fine plateau , near the head waters of the Missouri , at the foot of the Rocky Mountains ; and the same in the return . They had landed in the night in a deep valley a few miles out of San Francisco , and remained two days in that city ; which gave a period of ten days to the entire voyage , out and back . Forty selected individuals , all bound to secresy , had participated in the risks and excitements of the extraordinary occasion . Mr. Bonflon was not of the number . An heroic daughter of his was . His partner , Mons . De A ë ry , a French gentleman of great mechanical skill , had managed the affair ; and the craft , in the same hands , was now absent on her second expedition across the American continent . Such was the sum of Mr. Bonflon 's revelations of the morning . What a discovery ! How the announcement would astonish the world ! How the practical fact would overturn the world , upset commerce , and transform the habits and relations of mankind ! America , the pioneer in many valuable discoveries and reforms , was still ahead ,— still destined to lead the van in the development of the powers and resources of Nature , and the onward march of nations . Hurriedly recalling all these points to mind , I requested to know of Mr. Bonflon how it had been possible , with so many confidants and the prying propensities of the press , whose agents , like an invisible police , are everywhere , to keep the matter from becoming public ,— at least , to cover the affair so completely that no hint of the existence of his machine should have been given in any quarter , or of the vast changes which its introduction as a power in the world could not fail to effect . To this he replied , that the press had behaved very handsomely ; that the principal papers of the country had attach é s aboard on the first trip to the Pacific ; but that all parties — the government , the editors , together with De A ë ry and himself — were agreed that the matter should be kept strictly private , until its practicality and value should be established beyond the possibility of question . I now remembered , that , several years ago , a good deal of noise had been made about a flying-machine which had been constructed in some of the suburbs of the city ,— and that a day had been advertised when it was to make an ascent , but , it failed . I mentioned the circumstance to Mr. Bonflon . “ Yes , ” he replied . “ It was at Hoboken . De A ë ry and myself spent years in the construction of that machine , and a large amount of money . On the day when the trial of its powers was to have taken place , the weather proved unfavorable , and we met with unexpected delays . The spectators , who had congregated by thousands , became impatient ; and the mob , breaking in upon us , destroyed in an hour property which had cost us five thousand dollars and the labor of years . ” I felt obliged to sympathize with Mr. Bonflon . He had met with the usual fortune of public benefactors , and particularly of inventors . His success , however , should it prove real , in the unexampled brilliancy of its results , would more than compensate him for all his disappointments and losses . He would rank as the greatest of discoverers ,— as the master mind of this master century . Leading him off from this one topic into general conversation , I held him thus engaged for an hour . I was charmed with his comprehensive intelligence , and with the scope and liberality of his views . In everything relating to mechanics , his opinions were marked with originality . This had evidently been his favorite field , where his quick perceptions and powers of concentration and analysis had elevated him to an eminence where he stood almost alone . I had never met his equal . In plausible suggestions relative to the possibilities of the future , he took me quite above my level , and left me floating in a maze of glittering bewilderment . But I could discover no breaks , no confusion in his mind , on the themes he presented . His premises were apparently well considered , and his conclusions the fair and natural sequences flowing from them . On the following day , Mr. Bonflon called on me again . In the interval , my friend and myself had held extended consultations . My friend , while externally calm as the surface of a summer sea , as was his wont , it was plain for me to see , was internally deeply stirred and excited by the extraordinary nature of Mr. Bonflon 's revelations . Acknowledging a mutual and increasing interest in the intelligent inventor , we nevertheless parted in a wilderness of doubt . There was a mystery in the matter ,— a surprise for the world or a surprise for ourselves ,— which time , it would seem , with its busy thumb and finger , must be left to unravel at its leisure . Mr. Bonflon had not brought the California paper with him . The two or three copies only which had come into his possession had been handed around among his confidential friends , and he had not been able to lay his hand on one . He informed me that the “ Flying Cloud ” was expected to return in three days , and , after remaining two days on the Atlantic side of the continent , would then start on her third experimental trip to the Pacific . At that time he expected to make one of the party himself , and he invited me to accompany him . I accepted the invitation , and received from him particular instructions as to the nature of my outfit . It was in the midst of the heats of summer . He advised , however , a full supply of thick clothing , on account of the increased chill and coldness of the atmosphere at high altitudes ; and , indeed , recommended a mail of flannel next the skin . Everything else — the supply of the larder , with an excellent cook , beds , and so forth — would be found amply provided by De A ë ry and himself for the comfort and accommodation of their guests . The station , or point of departure , Mr. Bonflon informed me , was a retired spot but a few miles out of the city of Baltimore ; and he promised to be at hand at the proper time to accompany me in person , and see me safely on board the “ Flying Cloud . ” I saw nothing more of Mr. Bonflon for several days . Meanwhile I arranged my affairs for a brief absence , and , as my family were all off in the country , prepared a special letter for use , if needed , to be dated and mailed at the last moment , notifying them of a probable gap in my correspondence , on account of some pressing business which would take me out of the city for a few days and keep me constantly employed . In three or four days I received a note from Mr. Bonflon , advising me to hold myself in readiness ; and at the proper time , he presented himself before me . But he came to apologize . The “ Flying Cloud ” had returned . The second trip had been as successfully and safely performed as the first . Nothing had occurred to mar the pleasure of the voyage ; but , unfortunately , before coming on to New York , De A ë ry had filled out the complement of guests for the third grand expedition . Even he ( Mr. Bonflon ) should remain behind ; but he should see that seats were reserved for us both , without fail , for the next succeeding trip . Mr. Bonflon took his leave ; and I found myself more deeply involved in doubt and perplexity than ever . I could hardly say that I was disappointed , or that I was not . I had thrown myself on a wave , with no look-out or means of judging where I was to be cast , and had formed no opinions . As yet , everything looked fair with Mr. Bonflon . His face was as honest as the morning sun , and it was next to impossible to doubt him . He might be the prey of some strange phantasm , some monomania ; but the evidences did not show it . The account he had given of himself was manly and coherent ; his claims as a discoverer had been modestly presented , and were not wholly unsupported by circumstances , or unreasonable in themselves . Indeed , they must be regarded as coming within the range of probabilities fully as much as , to human seeming , had once the established , but ceaseless , wonders of steam locomotion and electric telegraphing . Singularly enough ,— and it illustrates the constantly shifting scenes in the kaleidoscope of life ,— within an hour , Mr. Bonflon returned with a new message , and with the programme of the “ Flying Cloud ” changed , if not reversed . He had seen De A ë ry again . One or two of the expected passengers had telegraphed that untoward circumstances would compel them to remain behind , and there would be room for us . But no time was to be lost ; the air-steamer would weigh anchor before daylight of the following morning , and we must start for Baltimore by the next train . De A ë ry and several others were already flying over the rail on their way to Philadelphia . I did not allow myself to hesitate . With an unusual degree of excitement , made up of the mingled emotions of wonder , doubt , and , I frankly confess , apprehension , I dated and superscribed the letter to my absent family ; and , taking my carpet-bag in my hand , packed to plethora several days before in readiness for the occasion , set out on the strange and questionable adventure . The run to Baltimore was made without accident or delay . Mr. Bonflon and myself conversed a good deal , and I found additional cause to admire the discriminating character of his mind and the curious and wonderful stores it contained . Some of the time we dozed , or sunk into a mental confusion like that to which the body was subjected by the motion of the cars , and called it sleep . My own most impressive visions , however , were those of silent wakefulness , and were connected with the morrow and the “ Flying Cloud . ” We stopped in the chief city of Maryland only long enough to obtain some slight refreshments , such as could be furnished readily in the middle of the night , and proceeded at once to the wharf or station of our sky-sailer . Ah , how shall I describe my sensations on first beholding this most wonderful achievement of the age , and thus satisfying myself that it was an actual existence , and not the mere chimera of a diseased brain ? There she sat like a majestic swan , floating , as it were , in the pure empyrean , and crowned with a diadem of stars . The Moon , Arcturus , and the Pleiades might well all make obeisance to her , and the Milky Way invite her to extend her flight and plough its snowy fields . I was astonished at her size , the symmetry of her parts , and the harmony of her proportions , as she lay there at a great height , which I was quite unable to estimate , in bold relief against the sky . But Mr. Bonflon could afford me but a brief time for observation and the indulgence of my wonder . The stores and most of the passengers were already on board ; and taking me by the arm , he hurried me forward , and seated me in the small car or tender , by means of which , and the agency of ropes and pulleys , we were to reach her decks . Our upward movement immediately commenced . It was steady and gentle , not calculated to create alarm ; and still the notion of quitting Mother Earth for an indefinite number of days , to rove in the blue unknown of space , was attended with some apprehensions and regrets . I gazed anxiously at the receding objects below ; but my feelings underwent a change as we approached the “ Flying Cloud ” herself , were pulled into her gangway , and I found myself standing on her solid decks . A brief further period intervened , and our anchor was loosed ; the tremendous machine became instinct with life ; she began to move ; and , hurrah ! we were under way . The thoughts and emotions of this bewildering moment it is impossible to describe . Our craft moved off majestically , like some huge water-fowl rising from the sea . Her course was westward and upward , like the eagle with his face turned toward the palace of the sun . At first the lights in the city of Baltimore became more numerous and distinct , as intervening objects were surmounted and overlooked . Next they began to fade , shrinking down into twinkling points like fireflies , until they disappeared . Forests , hills , and mountains followed after , as our altitude was increased , blending together like a hazy landscape , until , on passing above the cloud region , and finding the level of our track , the earth was wholly lost to our view , and our course lay through the blue serene of space , without a lighthouse or a landmark , and nothing but the constant lamps of heaven to guide us in our passage . What a sea ! The ocean has its visible surface on which move the ships ; but we had none . The heavens were beneath us as well as above . We were floating in the great circle of the systems and the suns . We were of the universe ; but were to be numbered with the constellations and the stars . We could compare ourselves to a company of immortals quitting the earth and traversing the electric seas which lead to brighter homes . Or we were voyagers to the sun , or to the nearer Venus , or to the far distant Centaurus . What a world of new thought was forced upon us by the fancies and realities and charm and awe of our extraordinary condition , combined with the profound consciousness we could not fail to entertain of the effects which this crowning discovery of Messrs. Bonflon and De A ë ry must produce on travel , on commerce , on art , and the common destiny of mankind ! I found the atmosphere of the cabins , as my friend Bonflon had asserted , agreeable and healthful . I could also occupy the promenade deck for half an hour with little inconvenience , so far as the levity of the air was concerned ; but the cold was severe ; while the system , in consequence of an undue expansion of its particles , solid and fluid , from the diminished pressure of the atmosphere , was rendered doubly susceptible to its influence . The advice given by Mr. Bonflon to case myself in flannels , with an armament at hand of outer winter clothing , proved well-timed ; and yet a period of lassitude , verging on faintness , invariably followed every considerable exposure to the open air . But the pleasure of gazing on those fields of space without obstruction , without the intervention of so much as a plate of crystal glass , repaid me for every risk and every ill . Though it might be said there was no scenery there , where nothing was visible but the stars , yet far beyond the power of mountain and valley , forest and lake , waterfall and ocean , did that scene , which was no scene , or next to none , bind me in the spell of its fascination . The motion of our craft , as we careered noiselessly through the shoreless and objectless void , without sense of effort or friction , was a charm of itself ,— bringing to a flower , crystallizing into refulgent stars , the dim , obscure , however glorious , poetry of life . Here were the wildest imaginations of the dreamer melted in a crucible , and reproduced in living forms of usefulness and beauty . In my own years of widely diversified experience , what had I met with to compare with this ? Nothing . The force of steam was marvellous ,— talking over a wire mysterious ; but here I was in a great ship riding among the planets and the stars . I had likened Niagara to a vast mill-dam , because I could find no peer to set beside it ; so now , in my weakness , the sublime pageant of the “ Flying Cloud ” could search out nothing higher in my recollection with which to compare it than a wild , ride of my youth in a canoe , for a half mile or so , down the rapids of a river . But morning was at hand . The rich golden glow of night , to which the dwellers on the earth 's surface are accustomed , as we passed to higher altitudes , had given place to a thin inky blue . This was obscured by no fleck or mist , and yet the stars shone through it faint and dim , despoiling the firmament of its glory . The same loss of power was manifest on the ushering in of day . The auroral flame , which ordinarily greets us in the east with such a ruddy laugh , was now nothing better than a wan and dismal smile ; and even the sun , as he struggled up from what seemed a bed of leaden mist , brought with him only a pallid , lifeless twilight . It was not that his rays were impeded by cloud or haze ; he had lost his power to shine . He hung there in the heavens like a great white shield , and looked down on us as rayless and powerless and devoid of life as a dead man 's eye . Having at length wearied myself with gazing , and feeling chill and weak from the coldness and tenuity of the atmosphere , I subsided into the comfort and companionship of the cabins below . Among the passengers I recognized attach é s of the press , besides several gentlemen of Philadelphia , Baltimore , and Washington , with whom I was somewhat acquainted . More circumspect , or less slaves to the imagination than myself , they had contented themselves with in-door observations . But their enthusiasm was none the less inflamed . In astonishment they looked at each other ; in restless bewilderment they glanced out of the windows on the desert , trackless plane traversed by the “ Flying Cloud , ” and spoke with a species of awe of the shock which the announcement of what they were then witnessing would give to sober men 's minds ; and suggested , in broken sentences , some of the consequences which would be likely to flow from the grand invention . What with excitement and lack of sleep , we all found ourselves a little nervous . Coffee and Havanas failed to allay the feeling ; and , in the absence of the morning papers , we resorted to whist , chess , and our pocket supplies of the “ Atlantic Monthly , ” “ Harper , ” and so forth , and to the very select library provided by Messrs. Bonflon and De A ë ry , the proprietors , for the use of the passengers ,— and at last to our beds . It could not be denied that we were nervous . With all the smoothness and beauty of our running , there was a sensation , an uncertain quivering motion , not at first noticed and not at all definable , about our craft , that constantly , suggested the idea that we were standing on nothing , or , at best , nothing better than dissolving quicksands , which were liable at any moment wholly to slide away and leave us ; and it required some strength of mind to resist the vagary , and prevent it from effecting a troublesome lodgment in the imagination . Thus passed the day , which fortunately , in my case , was succeeded by a night of repose . The restlessness of mind and body once subdued , Nature asserted her empire , and I slept profoundly until morning . Another day and night followed , with little variation from the first ; and by this time , the strangeness and mystery of my situation had quite worn away , and the feeling of security was established . I trod the upper deck with all the pride , and more than the composure , of a modern monarch on his throne . But the sameness of the scenery of the vast a ë rial ocean , in which we were sailing alone , without consort , without ever descrying a sail , or even keeping a lookout , without so much as ever discovering a floating plank to remind us of a wreck , or a seaweed to tell us of the land , was already beginning to pall on the senses , when there appeared in the distance before us , and multiplying to the right and the left , a succession of white , sparkling pyramids and cones , resting on the clouds and flashing in the nether light , like crystal monuments set to mark the boundaries of space . These were crests of the Rocky Mountains , covered with perpetual snow . I gazed on them with rapture . Right in our eye , nearly due west , stood out Long 's Peak , James 's Peak , and the Spanish Peaks , at first small in size , but momently swelling in dimensions ; while , far to the north , were just discernible the more lofty summits of Mount Hooker and Mount Brown . Lying between Mount James and the Spanish Peaks , inclining to their eastern slope , lay the green plateau , not yet visible , where we were to land . Its position was carefully pointed out to Mr. Bonflon and myself by Mr. De A ë ry , but we strained our eyes and used our glasses in vain . No strength of sight could penetrate the clouds and haze which covered the body of the mountains , and hid the earth , with the exception of those lofty silver pinnacles , from our view . Though these high peaks , like distant masts at sea , were first seen early in the day , the meridian of noon overtook us before we came up with them . At length , in increasing numbers and a thousand diversified shapes , they lay spread out before us , and soon thereafter were directly under our feet . Our magical machine , coming to a halt , fluttered like a great bird above them , and gave us an opportunity , such as probably had never been enjoyed by voyagers before , to spy out their beauty , their mystery , and their strength . On nearing the mountains , we had left behind us the twilight of the void , and come again into the full flood of day . This enabled the sight to rest upon the scene with pleasure , to examine its diversified splendors , and penetrate its chasms and gorges , otherwise inaccessible to man . But to describe them is impossible . Broad fields of sparkling snow , pyramids of ice , wide fissures shining like steel mirrors ,— produced by some unimaginable convulsion , possibly a thousand or ten thousand years ago , and large enough to ingulf a city ,— with black humps or spires of granite here and there projecting through the white ; while afar down the rocky sides of interminable swells and precipices came up a sound of water and a blush of green , betokening the direction in which we were to look for the generative body of Mother Earth ; all these , and much more which I cannot stop to name , were grouped in the rough , but magnificent landscape before us . No cabin could confine me at such a time as this . I stood out on the upper deck in the extreme bow of the boat ; and from an unobstructed point of view , nearly over the figure-head , in the very abandonment of daring , feasted my senses on the wondrous glories of this mountain-scene of enchantment . De A ë ry was at the helm . But I have scarcely introduced this extraordinary gentleman to the reader . He was a tall , black-haired , mercurial Frenchman , with an eye like a falcon , who , with only an occasional Gallicism purposely indulged in , spoke American like a native . I had every confidence in his prudence and skill in the management of his craft ; and still , as I perceived that we were gradually settling down in the direction of the loftiest of those snow-peaks , until scarcely fifty feet intervened between us and its round , polished brow , to all appearance as solid as feldspar , I raised my voice and accosted him . “ Halloo ! Captain ! ” said I , “ are you intending to land us on this Atlas-top ? ” “ Effectivement , ” replied he . “ Mon Dieu ! B ——, come here . ” I went to him . “ This , ” said he , “ is the very Old Man of the Mountain . I intend to plant the stars and stripes in the centre of his bald head . ” “ Capital ! ” replied I . “ But can you achieve it safely ? ” “ Yes . I can manage my bird with as much ease as a pigeon poises himself on his wings , or an Indian steers his canoe . See ! we are approaching the crown of the pinnacle . ” I watched the experiment with an interest not unmingled with fear . He held in one hand a handsome American flag , of moderate size , and occasionally , with a slight motion of his arm , and a glance of pride , spread out its silken folds on the motionless air . Gradually the “ Flying Cloud , ” under his skilful hands , closed upon the bleak , glittering summit , which , rounding off like the bald head of some venerable giant , was , at its apex , scarcely ten feet in diameter . “ No eagle , even , has ever set his foot here , ” said De A ë ry . “ There is not a track , or feather , or mark of any living thing to be seen . The ‘ Flying Cloud ’ will be the first to explore many mysteries and to explode others . Not even do the winds reach this height . Boreas and the bird of Jove ,— I will vanquish them both . I will step out upon that icy peak . ” “ No , no , Captain , ” I expostulated . “ You might lose your foothold and perish . ” “ Not at all , ” rejoined he , with a laugh . “ I am as sure-footed as a goat . But if you think it risky , Monsieur , I forbear . But the snow looks solid as adamant . I fear I shall not be able to erect this flag , unless I have a firm spot for my feet . ” By this time our craft had reached a proper position ,— her stern alongside and almost in contact with the jutting peak ,— to answer the ambitious purpose of the Frenchman . Raising the flag of the Republic in his hand , he requested us all to do it proper honor ,— to salute it with a “ three times three , ” — as he should succeed in securing it in its place . Cautiously extending the staff , he brought it in contact with the snow , and gave it several light blows , for the purpose of ascertaining its solidity . It seemed of almost icy texture , and emitted a half-sharp and half-muffled sound in reply . Then , elevating the standard aloft in both hands , he brought it down with force , as the farmer urges a stake into the ground ; not doubting , as would seem , that a succession of such blows would be needed in order to achieve his purpose . A single stroke of the shaft , however , proved more than enough . To the surprise and dismay of us all , the firm ringing surface turned out but a shell , and all beneath , a loose bed of sparkling snow-crystals , like white sand . The flag sunk down and disappeared , and De A ë ry , losing his balance , plunged over and went with it . We gazed after him in speechless horror . Before any one of us had sufficiently recovered himself to speak , we were startled by a dull sound , like a rushing wind , or distant , rumbling thunder ; and an immense mass of snow , many hundred feet in depth , and covering a third of the cone , parted from its place , and , like a great , foaming wave , broken and shapeless , rushed down the mountain 's side . For the moment , all eyes were fixed upon it . At first , it swept on without cohering , like a cataract of sand ; but , on coming in contact with the moister snow below , it formed into a thousand balls and masses , some rolling and some sliding , but each gathering bulk and velocity as it went . By the aid of our glasses we were able to sweep the rough slopes and precipitous descents below , to the distance of many miles ; and , forgetting De A ë ry , we watched the development of the phenomenon with terror . The larger slides gradually absorbed the smaller ones , as common fish are swallowed by sharks ; but those which remained , fattened and expanded by what they fed on , assumed enormous dimensions . Choosing different paths , they pursued their course in smoking tracks of devastation . Rocks , precipices , forests , furnished no obstruction . Roaring , crashing onward , as though Mars or the Sun had opened its batteries upon us , those sliding , whirling worlds of snow swept through valleys large enough to have furnished sites for cities , without a check , and bore down or over-leaped all obstacles , as easily as a man would walk over an ant-hill , or some hollow where a toad had burrowed . Finally they were lost to sight , passing behind intervening spurs or ridges of the mountain , or becoming hidden in the cloud-mists which lay heavily about its base ; but the sound continued to roll back upon us for some time , like the roar of distant artillery . I could no longer wonder at the terror with which the cry of an avalanche is said to fill the dwellers among the Alps . As this absorbing pageant of the mountains disappeared , our thoughts reverted to De A ë ry . Had he been carried away by the snow-slip ? or was his mangled corse below us among the black crags laid bare by that catastrophe ? Turning my gaze beneath , I discovered , far down , many hundred feet , a moving object , scarcely bigger than a fly , and , on bringing my glass to bear upon it , perceived that it was the Frenchman . He was standing on a bare rib of rock , with his flag still in his hand , and apparently unharmed . Waving the ensign to attract our attention , at the same time he shouted with the whole strength of his lungs . But his voice scarcely reached us , and probably would not alone have attracted our notice . We replied with encouraging cheers ; and the “ three times three , ” which we had intended for the American eagle , was given on the spot to De A ë ry . But how to rescue him from his perilous condition was indeed a serious question . The “ Flying Cloud , ” it was obvious , with her great size and spreading pinions , could not venture among those ticklish quicksands , whose insecure foundations had just been so strikingly illustrated before us . Indeed , the slightest jar might precipitate another fall of snow , and bury the object of our solicitude five hundred feet deep in its bosom . The sagacity of Mr. Bonflon relieved us from our dilemma . He hoisted out the small car or tender , and , letting it down with great care and precision , safely accomplished the object . In the space of half an hour , De A ë ry , without a scratch , and , like a gallant Gaul , rather proud of his adventure than frightened at it , was again restored to our arms . Drawing off from our dangerous proximity to the “ Old Man of the Mountain , ” which had so nearly proved fatal to at least one of our number , but astonished beyond measure at the novelty of our experiences and the grandeur of the scenes we had witnessed , we retraced our course for a short distance , and , gradually lessening the interval between us and the earth , soon had the satisfaction of hearing the cry of “ Land , ho ! ” from the look-out man . The valley was in sight where we were to take in water and enjoy a little picnic on the green grass , ere the form and smell of Mother Earth , with her homely but blessed realities , should be quite forgotten . We effected our landing in complete safety . The spot was a little , luxurious nook among the lesser hills , with few trees , but full of wild flowers , wild fruits , and wild grasses . Everything about it was wild , but cheering and charming , especially to air-wanderers like us . The foot of the white hunter , or even of the roving Indian , had perhaps never visited it , nor foraging-parties of the buffalo or deer , for we saw no signs of them ; but birds of varied plumage and song , and troops of squirrels , with footprints here and there of the grizzly bear , and a drove of wild turkeys , with red heads aloft , rushing over an eminence at our left as we approached , and an occasional whir of a rattlesnake at our feet , sufficiently indicated the kind of denizens by which the plateau was inhabited . Here , on the rich sward and delicate mosses , under the shadow of some willows , we spread out our repast by the side of a clear mountain-spring ; and , to say nothing of old Otard and Schiedam Schnapps , opened some bottles of Sparkling Catawba , and old Jersey Champagne , of a remote vintage , which I have now quite forgotten . With the flow of these beverages flowed our speech , in jovial words and songs and raillery enough , if not in wit . De A ë ry , as having by a hair 's breadth just escaped with his life , and in virtue of his extraordinary feat in leaping five hundred feet or more through a bank of snow , now that the danger was over , was made the butt of much pleasantry , which he bore with his usual equanimity and grace . When these arrowy flights at the expense of the light-hearted Frenchman had exhausted themselves , I took occasion to inquire of him what his sensations were during his brief burial . He replied as follows :— “ I thought nothing at all about it . I remember feeling chagrined because I was making a failure , and clung tight to my flag , fearing to lose that too . Mon Dieu ! It might be expected that one would feel cold , buried up in ice ; but such was not the case . I was hot . The snow burned my face , as it came in contact with it . As to the ride , it was pleasant enough , but rather rapid and perplexing to the breath . It was like sinking into a pit of quicksand , where everything gives way below one , as though the bottom of the world had fallen out . There was the struggle of a moment to keep the fine snow out of my mouth and nostrils , as I drew in my breath , and the next instant my feet came in contact with the solid rock , where you discovered me . The magnificent avalanche you describe I know nothing about . I neither heard nor saw anything of it , only as I afterward examined the marks it had left behind it . This leads me to suppose that I was a good deal confused at the time , though I was not aware of it . Indeed , I have an impression of seeming to turn somersets in my descent , and this may account for it . But , for the honor of France , I saved my adopted country 's flag . ” High-minded Gaul ! We all praised and honored him , and comforted him for his disappointment . It was a noble attempt he had made , to nail the American banner to the head of Mount James , impelled by the loftiest of motives ,— and , like many others of its kind , had for the present failed . At some other time he might prove more successful ; or some other might achieve the object in his place , and so appropriate his laurels ; but no one would be likely to excel him in his flying leap . In this he had distanced even the famous traveller at Rhodes . Having given a couple of hours to this species of recreation , we weighed anchor , and again got under way . Slowly and smoothly , without a ripple or a jar , we ascended through the blue ether to our former altitude , and floated off over those majestic mountain-tops , toward the west . Loath to part from scenes of such impressive beauty ,— scenes , alone paralleled in our recollection by fabulous tales of Oriental enchantment ,— we gazed behind us at those flashing crests of alabaster , until they grew small in the distance , and finally were wholly lost to our sight . With them disappeared the last vestige of the solid earth , and we were again afloat in space . The following night and day were passed like their predecessors . Another night came , and we were over the eastern bound of the State of California . A few hours more , without accident , would terminate our remarkable voyage , and set us down in the city of San Francisco . All of us were brimming high with hope . Though we did not anticipate reaching the station before one or two o'clock in the morning , and probably should not disembark before dawn , we were loath to retire to rest . It was near midnight before all of us were in our berths . But when at length there , I found it impossible to sleep . The excitement attendant on the beginning of the trip seemed to have returned on me with a double force . I listened for some sound to relieve the awful stillness which , like the wing of Death , seemed to have settled over the “ Flying Cloud ” ; but there was no soughing of the wind , as at sea , and no noise to be heard , save the monotonous movement of the engine and the paddle-wheels ; and this , so evenly did they play , was rather a motion than a sound . This period of restlessness was succeeded by one of strange bewilderment , which might have been sleep , or might not Rapidly changing scenes and fantastic figures , some of them beautiful and some horrible , flitted before me like a dissolving panorama . A band , as though of steel wire , seemed to encircle my brain , and to compress it closer and closer ; and the spine , for its whole length , felt as though subjected to a like crushing pressure . How long this state of hallucination continued I have no means of knowing . From it , by a great effort , I suddenly aroused myself , and returned to my proper senses . Where I was , and all the extraordinary events of the last few days , were clear in my recollection . But I was weighed down with weakness , and found , on attempting to speak , that I had no voice . Suspecting that I had been stricken by some terrible disease , I attempted to rise ; and , loath to disturb any of my fellow-travellers , undertook to crawl out upon the upper deck . This , after a good deal of effort , I accomplished . Lying , therefore ,— I could not stand ,— I prayed for a breath of air to relieve my hot and oppressed brow ; but in vain . The atmosphere seemed gone . Chill and dark , the heavens spread out above me without a twinkle or a smile . The full-moon was there , and there was no cloud or haze to obscure her light ; but she did not shine . Her white , rayless face was a mockery to the night . The same was true of the stars . The dazzling canopy was faded out , and Cygnus and the Great Bear were subdued to pallid points , like patches of white-gray paper stuck upon a wall . Floating by the side of the “ Flying Cloud , ” and nearly of her size , I discovered a dark , irregular object , and dragged myself to the edge of the deck to investigate it more closely . The two came together , but without damage or friction . They touched and parted , like substances nearly at rest in still water . I put out my hand on the strange visitor , and received a pretty severe shock , as though I had been subjected to the action of an electric battery . At the same time , a light , bluish flame ran over its surface , showing me more accurately its form and dimensions . To the touch , it was solid and cold , like iron or granite . I pressed upon it , and it yielded like a floating dish . I tried to break off a fragment , but was unable to separate so much as a scale . A moment 's reflection convinced me of the nature of this apparent island in the air . It was an immense a ë rolite ; and with this conviction came the solution of my own painful state . We had unconsciously passed beyond the controlling power of the earth 's gravitation , into that region of the upper atmosphere , where , science informs us , these meteoric stones float in equilibrium , until some accidental impulse throws them from their balance , when they are precipitated to the surface of the earth . I must be dying for lack of air . And the man at the helm , where was he ? He must have fallen asleep , and left our vessel to her own buoyant fancies . And my companions ! Bonflon ! De A ë ry ! All ere this might have perished , and the “ Flying Cloud , ” aside from myself , be bearing into these upper altitudes nothing but a load of death . Terror-struck , I dragged myself , with all the speed I could accomplish , to the stern . There sat the helmsman at his post , but asleep or insensible . I shook him , but he gave no signs of life . I shouted with what little strength I had , but in vain . “ Wake up ! wake up ! ” I cried , “ or we are lost ! ” At length he opened his eyes , but did not move . “ Wake up ! ” I screamed again . “ Breakers ahead , and worse . You have let the craft run wild . We are above our level . We are all dying for lack of air . ” “ Oh , let me sleep ! ” he murmured . “ I must sleep a little while longer . It can n't — can n't be morning yet . ” By this time , fright , or the necessity of the occasion , was renewing my strength . “ Dick ! ” I shouted in his ear , “ Dick , you scoundrel ! you will murder us all . Do your duty , or I will shoot you ! ” With this I discharged a barrel of my revolver above his head , which , like my voice in my efforts at hallooing , sounded only as a faint echo of itself , but , nevertheless , proved sufficient to give his dormant faculties a shock . He started up , and , though still but half-conscious , took the helm and gave it the direction I bade him . From him I hastened to the engineer , whom I found in a like state of insensibility . I succeeded in arousing him ; but it was necessary that he should be made to comprehend the difficulties of our situation ,— that our craft , water-logged as it were , would float forever where she was , for all anybody could say to the contrary , until forced down by the power of the engine alone to lower and life-giving atmospheric planes . To get him to understand this was not so easy . But I succeeded in part , and , in my anxiety for my friends , rushed below to look after their condition . As I anticipated , I found every one of them in a state of incipient asphyxia . But the “ Flying Cloud ” was already descending into denser air . Oxygen and pressure were performing their mystic work ; and within half an hour I had the pleasure of seeing them all restored to consciousness and rapidly returning strength . But the renewed lights exposed a sight almost too frightful to mention . Every man of us was crimson from escaped blood , which seemed to have oozed forth , like a pale-red dew , from every pore of our bodies . Messrs. Bonflon and De A ë ry , when they came to realize the danger from which we had so narrowly escaped , were nearly dumb with horror . The lively Frenchman exhibited a sensibility which the extremity of his single peril , a day or two before , had failed to call up . He wept aloud . Mr. Bonflon was circumspect and thoughtful . He did not lose his Yankee balance ; but both of them , each in his own way , overwhelmed me with expressions of obligation . But the dangers of this dreadful night — a night which can never pass from my recollection — were not yet over . We were all gathered in the main cabin , congratulating each other , next after our escape , on our rapidly returning strength ,— happy in the thought that our trip out , though sprinkled with danger , was so near a prosperous completion , and almost momently expecting to hear the stroke of the bell which should announce to us that the red light to designate our place of landing was in sight , when , instead of the silver ring of this messenger of peace , we were startled and horrified by an alarm of fire . Bonflon and De A ë ry rushed to the engine-room . A cloud of smoke poured out from the door by which they disappeared . They were gone only for a moment ; for no man could remain in the hell of flames and vapors into which they ventured and live . They came out dragging with them the half-suffocated , scorched , and blazing engineer . How the accident occurred , it was impossible to divine and useless to inquire . Closing the door tightly after them to confine the flames , where confinement , except for the briefest period , among matter so combustible , and partitions scarcely more formidable than those of a paper bandbox , was clearly impossible , they threw the burning engineer into our arms , and themselves took the management of the craft . De A ë ry , in this crisis , rose from the man to the hero , almost to a demigod . His orders rung through the startled air clear and round like the voice of a golden bell . Bonflon seconded him with coolness and decision . With us a moment sufficed to extinguish the burning garments of the engineer ; but by that time the flames had burst from the engine-room , and that part of the beautiful boat was a ragged , crackling ruin . Fleeing to the upper deck , and taking refuge in the bow , we became sensible that we were descending through the air with frightful rapidity . When the accident occurred , we were already at a low level , on the look-out for the signal at our station . This circumstance was in our favor , if anything could be , when a danger so imminent and dreadful was pressing . Land , like a hazy shadow , was just discoverable in the dim distance below us ; and oh for one foot of it as a place of rest ! But if it were possible to escape the flames , it was clear enough that we must be dashed in pieces against the solid earth . De A ë ry was now the only one remaining in the stern . He was exposed to great peril , but refused to quit his post while it remained possible to control in any degree the motions of the vessel . The flames played about him without shaking his courage or his coolness , and broke through upon the upper deck and separated him from us with a seething hedge and whirlpool of fire . We lost sight of him , and supposed he had perished , when suddenly his voice , issuing from the midst of the furnace , rung on our ears like a trumpet . “ Up the ropes ! quit the ship , or you die , every man of you ! ” he shouted ; and at the same time we discovered him emerging from the flames and smoke , and ascending the network which enveloped the balloon and connected it with the ship . We followed his example ; some of our number — the more timid or the more daring , it would be difficult to say which — continuing the ascent until they had reached the upper surface of the gas-chamber , and placed its entire fragile bulk between them and the hazard they most dreaded . The momentary refuge afforded by these upper works was scarcely attained , when the bow , where we had stood but a minute before , and the whole hull of the “ Flying Cloud ” with it , blended together in one mass of surging fire . The appearance in the heavens of this strange sight , to a watcher at some rancho , or in the not distant city of San Francisco , if such there were , must have afforded a more vivid illustration of the fall of a blazing star or meteoric wonder than astronomer has ever put on record . But I delay the catastrophe . Land and water soon became distinguishable from each other beneath us , and hills from valleys , and forests from bare plains . There was little wind , except the fierce currents rushing upward , produced by the heat of our own conflagration . This , for the time , subdued everything to itself , and , as we approached the ground , served by its direction to modify the fury of our descent . The denser lower atmosphere also contributed to the same end ; and , most fortunately , when we reached the earth , and the collision came , we struck in water instead of on the land . Still , the collision was a fierce one . With the mass of fire between us and the ground directly below , blinded by the smoke and half suffocated by the heat , we were not conscious of the good fortune that awaited us , until , with a swoop and a plunge , we found ourselves submerged , and , with an equal velocity , immediately thrown back again by the buoyant force of the balloon into the open air . The flood of fire in which we had descended was instantly extinguished ; and we awoke to a sense of our possible safety in darkness rendered doubly profound by the contrast . Daylight was near at hand . By a careful adjustment of our weights we kept the balloon from rolling , and sustained ourselves above the water among the netting . As morning came , we discovered we had landed in a small lake , hardly large enough to be dignified with the name , but obviously of considerable depth . The shore was not distant : and as the day was sultry , with a little grateful labor at swimming and towing , on the part of a few of us , we soon reached it . There we examined into each other 's condition . Scarce one of us but was able to show damage by fire , or from too rough contact with the fragments of the “ Flying Cloud , ” which preceded us in our plunge into the lake . But no bones were broken , and no one badly flayed . The case of the engineer was the worst ; but even he was able to keep upon his feet , and pronounced in no danger . No hut or field or sign of inhabitants was to be seen . With mixed feelings , in which , for the present at least , the sense of personal safety triumphed over all regrets , even with Messrs. Bonflon and De A ë ry , at the shipwreck of so many brilliant hopes , we scuttled that part of our craft still afloat , and sunk it in the lake ; and with weary footsteps , but unobstructed with baggage , as near as we could determine by the aid of a compass , took the direction toward San Francisco . A couple of hours brought us to the rancho of Se ñ or Jos é Dianza , who received us as a band of pilgrims over the Plains , who , at the hands of robbers and the elements , had lost everything but life , and helped us on to the city of the land of gold . It is needless to detain the reader with the particulars of our return . They were such only as occur to thousands in the rough and circuitous transit between San Francisco and New York . We came home by the Isthmus route , and in ships that ploughed the honest waves . We explained our absence to our disturbed families and friends as best we might ; and some will remember — and if they do not , they can refresh their recollection by a reference to the public prints — that several missing gentlemen of some importance in the world , about that time , suddenly reappeared upon the stage of action . We resolved that the whole affair in which we had been engaged should remain forever buried in oblivion . But time and reflection have wrought a change with me , though I shall not presume to disturb the veil which covers my associates . I have come to consider the adventure quite too good to be lost , and the experiment in aerial navigation , which came so near proving successful , of too much importance to science to be suppressed . Hence , conquering my repugnance , I have decided , on my own responsibility , to give these interesting and valuable particulars to the world . DOG-TALK . Exactly ,— Dog-Talk . And I sit down to write some of it out , in the middle of this pleasant month of May , lest , peradventure , if I postpone my task for a few weeks longer , I may fall in with my memories some time in the raging days of the dog-star , when the overwhelming sense of dog , in which , for the true working out of these memories , I must first dip my mind , may debar me from enjoying to the fullest extent the bounteous tap of Croton water which tinkles with such rivulet chiming from the silver ( German ) faucet into the marble ( wash-hand ) basin with which one side of my apartment is adorned . Hydrophobia is one thing , and hydrophobiaephobia is another . Although but the mid-time of May , as I have said , the thermometer is reported at something not far short of eighty degrees , and that in as much shade as can possibly be had in the street in which I write , which is a brick street of New York , with one catalpa-tree in it ,— a poor , vegetable fakir , standing on his one leg at a distance of about three blocks from “ our corner , ” and sprawling out all round with his shrivelled hands , as if to catch the passing robe of some rambling breath of fresh air . With a trustful hope that this statement may be accepted in extenuation of the inevitable platitudinism down the gently inclined plane of which I feel myself impelled to slide into my memories , I will endeavor to bring some of the latter to the surface . I fancy it has been already remarked by writers ,— though that will not prevent me from repeating it ,— that , of all the four-footed friends of man , none , not even that corpulent chap , Elephant , has contributed more voluminously to the literature of anecdote than that first-rate fellow , Dog . Let me also take the liberty of recalling , in corroboration of others who have previously drawn attention to the same fact , that from the earliest ages we trace Dog as the companion , friend , and ally of him whom alone he condescends to acknowledge as master , to accept as tutor , and to sympathize with in the spirit of hostility to obnoxious things , and in attachment to the sports of the field . It can hardly be necessary for me to explain that I allude to Man . Above all other created things , Man is the one that laughs ,— a remark , so far the present writer is aware , entirely original , and vastly more indicative of genius than the best of the platitudes incidentally referred to above . Some of the lower animals weep . The deer , for instance , has been observed to shed tears in the extremity of terror , and the hard-pressed hare cries like an ill-regulated child ; but not one of them indicates any emotion analogous to the laughter of Man , excepting Dog . True it is , that we hear of a “ horse-laugh . ” There is a beast , too , called the “ laughing hyena , ” and a dismal beast he is . Among the feathered tribes there flourishes an individual named the “ laughing falcon . ” From inanimate creation the poet has evoked for us “ Minni Haha , ” or the “ laughing water ” ; and the expression , “ it would make a cat laugh , ” is frequently made use of in reference to anything very ridiculous . But in every one of these cases of so-called laughing things , the sound only of the laughter is there ,— the sentiment is wanting . Not so with Dog , who , when the spirit of fun moves him , smiles beamingly with his eyes , giggles manifestly with his chops , or laughs uproariously with his tail , according as the occasion demands . Yet , with all his wonderful gifts of intellectual ability , we cannot concede to Dog the possession of the supereminent faculty called reason ,— the faculty which , as an eminent writer — Tupper , I think — remarks , places Man immeasurably above all the other animals stationed so much lower down , and by virtue of which he is lord and master of them all , leading Behemoth over the land with a ring in his nose , and towing Leviathan across the waters with a harpoon in his ribs . Fine as the line may appear which separates instinct from the divine gift of reason , we must see that progress , an essential consequence of the latter , is denied to the former . It is quite possible that the dogs which accompanied the first mariner in the first argosy were educated to fetch and carry , or were even so far accomplished as to sit up and beg ; and it is but little more their descendants can do at the present day . But what of Man , who weathered safely the storm of storms in that same Ark ? Compare that venerated bark , as imagined by us from traditionary description , with the least eligible of the ferry-boats which scud across our crowded rivers , and we have answer enough for the present , so far as progress is concerned . Well , if Dog has never invented so much even as a patent rat-trap ,— a thing , you see , that might have saved him some labor ,— if he persists in disregarding the majesty of Fashion , and continues to move about in society with the same kind of coat on his back as that worn by his first ancestor , hatless , disaffected of shoes , and totally obtuse to the amenity of an umbrella ,— if , in fact , his only approach to humanity , as distinguished by apparel , is his occasional adoption of a collar precisely similar in general effect to those in which Fashion , empress of Broadway and of a great many other ways , condemns her wretched votaries to partial strangulation ,— well , say I again , in spite of all this , Dog is prime company . Intimately associated as I have been from earliest boyhood with many excellent fellows of the family , from social communion with which I am at present debarred only by the direful necessity of dwelling in lodgings ,— a necessity which , if distasteful to Man , to Dog , oh , how fatal !— bound , I may say , as I was for years , not by straps and chains only , but by ties of confident friendship also , to canine comrades possessing the purest elements of worth and humor , it is to me a task not altogether devoid of interest to fall back on such memories as may enable me to chronicle a few reminiscences of the nobilities and eccentricities of the race . Before I discourse of individual dogs of the present century , however , with whom I have had the pleasure of being personally acquainted , let me reproduce the following short tale of a dog from an old French volume ,— a tome fittingly adorned with ears of that noble animal innumerable . Persimel St. Remi was a gentleman of fortune , whose income was derived principally from large rented farms , the dues arising from which he sometimes collected himself , in preference to intrusting that important duty to a steward or agent . On his excursions for that purpose , he was generally accompanied by a favorite little spaniel , of a kind too small to be of any service to him as an escort , but inestimable for his qualities as a companion . One day M. St. Remi had ridden a long way to collect certain sums of money due him in arrears of rent , but which he had little expectation of being able to obtain without further trouble . To his agreeable surprise , however , his tenants paid him the whole arrears ,— an event so unexpected that he could not conceal his exultation as he clinked the heavy bag of money on the pommel of his saddle , when cordially taking leave of his farmers . Merle — that was the little dog 's name — was equally delighted ; for his moods were always regulated by those of his master ,— such is the mysterious sympathy between Dog and us ; and ever as his master laughed cheerily to the chink of the gold , on his homeward ride , Merle barked and bounded alongside of him , clearly understanding that gold is a thing to be laughed with and not at , and that it is no laughing matter to be without it . This is what the old French writer asserts respecting the inward sentiments of that small dog . How he arrived at a knowledge of them , I know not , nor is it any business of mine . Well , Persimel St. Remi galloped on and on , until they reached the way-side well about halfway home ,— the old stone trough , with the water sparkling into it from the grotesque spout carved out of the rock . Here he pulled bridle to water his horse , refreshed him further by slackening the girths of the saddle , and , unstrapping the bag of gold which was attached to the holsters , he placed it by his side on the rock , while he splashed his hands and face in the cool water . By-and-by he drew up the girths , mounted his horse dreamily , for he was a man of contemplative moods , and rode away from the way-side well , forgetful of his treasure , which lay temptingly on the flat rock , ready to the hand of the first comer . Not so his faithful dog , who , having in vain tried to lift the bag , which was too heavy for him , ran swiftly after the rider , whose attention he strove to arouse by barking violently , and careering round and round the horse when he slackened his pace . Failing thus to attract notice , he went so far in his zeal as to bite the horse pretty severely in the fetlock , which caused him to swerve on one side , and wake up his master to a vague sense of something wrong , the first idea that occurred to him being that his dog had gone mad . Cases of hydrophobia had lately occurred in the neighborhood , and St. Remi was convinced of the seizure by it of his poor dog when they reached the brook which flowed across the road . Instead of luxuriating and drinking in this , as he usually did , the spaniel circled away to where it narrowed , and leaped across it in his run . Then St. Remi , drawing a pistol from his holsters , fired at and shot his faithful companion , averting his eyes as he touched the fatal trigger , and galloping rapidly away from the death-cry that smote upon his ear ; and , as he dashed the spurs into his reeking horse , he invoked maledictions on the money which was the cause of this unfortunate journey . The money ! but where was it ? Suddenly he pulled up his harassed steed , and the unhappy truth flashed upon him : he had left his treasure by the way-side well , and had shot his faithful dog for trying to remind him of it . Riding back to the well with mad speed , he found by traces of blood upon the path that the poor spaniel had dragged himself thither again to guard his master 's gold to the last . There he found him , stretched out beside the bag of money , with just strength enough left to raise his head towards his master , with a look of forgiveness , ere he died . The chronicler does not state what M. St. Remi did with all that money ,— though we may be safe in supposing that he very exactly knew ; but we would fain hope that he expended a moiety of it in founding a retreat for decayed dogs , as a monument to the poor little spaniel so faithful to him in life and in death . Sporting dogs ,— the setter , the pointer , the fox-hound , and all the several varieties of hound , have had their historians , from Dame Juliana Berners to Peter Beckford , and that more recent Peter whose patronymic was Hawker ; while , on our side of the Atlantic , the late “ Frank Forester ” has reduced kennel-practice to a system from which the Nimrod of the ramrod may not profitably depart . Apart from history , however , and from didactic argument , the individual trails of dogs remarkable in their day have but too rarely been recorded . Certainly the shepherd 's colley has been admirably individualized by the Ettrick Shepherd ; but many a terrier — “ a fellow of infinite fancy ” — has passed through the world 's worry without ever seeing his name in print ,— unless , indeed , he happened to have fallen among thieves , and found himself lamp-posted accordingly ,— has passed the grizzle-muzzle period of doghood unbiographied , and gone down to his last burrow unsung . Among the regrets with which we are saddled for our omissions , not the least of mine is now galling me for having neglected to reduce to writing , on the spot , curious facts which fell under my immediate notice in the course of many years ’ companionship with a somewhat miscellaneous assortment of canine friends ,— “ The little dogs and all , Tray , Blanche , and Sweetheart . ” Nevertheless , I will endeavor to bring together in this paper such stray reminiscences of doggery in general as may occur to me while I write , illustrating the subject , as I proceed , with occasional passages from the careers , of humble , but eccentric individuals of the race . Extinction has been the fate of some varieties of the dog , which have been either superseded by the progress of machinery , or have gone to decay in consequence of the annihilation of the animals for the chase of which they were maintained . When there were wolves in the mosses and caverns of Ireland , for example , there were wolf-dogs to hunt them . The last wolf of that country — and he was a wonder , from the then rarity of the animal — was killed about one hundred and fifty years ago ; and although the breed of hound then known as the Irish wolf-dog — one of the largest , noblest , and most courageous of the canine race — was kept up to some extent for nearly a century later , we doubt much whether a single pure specimen of the variety is now in existence ; unless , indeed , it may so happen that some ultimus Romanorum of the tribe still licks his patrician chops in the kennels of the Marquis of Sligo , in the possession of which family the last litter was many years ago supposed to be . Reverting to times when I was a boy , I remember me of a generation of bandy-legged , foxy little curs , long of body , short of limb , tight of skin , and “ scant of breath , ” which were regarded as the legitimate descendants of a superseded class ,— the Turnspit of good old times . The daily round of duty of that useful aide-de-cuisine transpired in the revolution of a wheel , along the monotonous journey of which he cantered , as a squirrel does in his rolling cage , keeping in motion , by his professional exertions , the wheels and spinners of the spit upon which the joint was kept turning before the fire . The tight skin of this ugly dog was evidently a provision of Nature to secure him from entanglement with the machinery amid which his business was conducted . Had a Scotch terrier , for instance , whiskered and plumed , descended from his own more aristocratic circle to disport himself in that where turnspit was the principal mover ,— the kitchen-wheel ,— he might have found himself cogged , and caught up , and spitted , and associated promiscuously with leg of mutton as roasted hare ; in which capacity he might eventually have been eaten with currant-jelly and considerable relish , receiving more honor , perhaps , “ in that connection , ” than had ever in his lifetime been lavished on him as a member of society . But Turnspit 's profession is a thing of the past , his very existence a myth . The roasting-jack , with a wind-up weight by which the spit was turned , cut him out first of all ; other inventions further diminished his importance . But the tea-kettle — which he somewhat resembled in figure , by-the-by — scalded him clean off the face of creation ; for the bright steam-engine , attached nowadays to the kitchens of our principal hotels , has given a new turn to affairs , ruling the roast after a fashion that sets back old Turnspit into the remotest corner under the backstairs of the Dark Ages . I have alluded to his alleged descendants , as pointed out to my observation in boyhood ; but they were an effete and degenerate race , purposeless , and wallowing much with the pigs , whom their grandsires would have recognized only to roast . In one instance only , and that on this side of the Atlantic , do I remember having been introduced to any dog whose profession was at all analogous to that of the turnspit of other days . Falling into conversation with an old Dutch-Yankee farmer , in a remote and very rural district , I made some remarks about his dog , which was a very large , heavy one , of that no-particular-kind happily classified by the comprehensive natural philosophers of the barn-floor as “ yellow dog . ” Farmer assured me that this fine fellow — whose name I am ashamed to say I have forgotten — did all the churning of the farm-dairy by imparting his motive power to a wheel . This piece of ingenuity , Farmer informed me , was originally and exclusively an inspiration from the intellect which animated his , Farmer 's , proper clod ; nor was he greatly exhilarated when I narrated to him the tradition of the turnspit , whose memory , I regret to record , he spurned as that of a “ mean cuss , ” destitute of that poetry which dwelleth in the pastoral associations of the dairy . Although not strictly in connection with the subject of this article , I will here relate a story told to me , on the same occasion , by that old farmer , because it struck me as being rather a good one , and is not particularly long . Seeing that I took notice of a smock-frocked rustic employed in foddering the cattle ,— a rustic whose legs and accent were to me exclusively reminiscent of the pleasant roads and lanes of cheery Somersetshire ,— Farmer informed me that he was a newish importation , having made his appearance about there early in the previous winter . While snow , of such quality and in such quantity as they have it in that region , was yet a novelty to the bumpkin , he was dispatched on horseback , one day , to the neighboring village , strict instructions being given him to ride carefully in the middle of the track , as , treading in the deep snow , the horse might “ ball , ” — an expression applied to taking up snow in the hollow of the hoof , which causes the animal to stumble . An unusually long time elapsed before the messenger made his appearance from his mission , and then he was seen making his way painfully through the snow , leading the horse after him by the bridle . “ What 's wrong now ? ” inquired Farmer , as he glanced at the animal 's knees ; “ been down , I guess ; did Old Horse ball ? ” “ Noa , ” replied Bumpkin , “ a did n't joost bawl , but a groonted consoomedly every toime a coom down . Oi thowt a wur a-gwoan to bawl the last toime we coom down together , and zo oi joost stayed down and walked ‘ im whoam . ” When doggy men beyond ocean talk about a terrier , they usually pronounce it tarrier , and not terrier , as we mostly call him on this bank of the Atlantic . There is no authority for the former pronunciation , that I know of , beyond usage , which , however , is much taken as a standard in England . Thus , an English merchant will talk to you about his clarks , an American about his clurks . The French word terrier — derived , of course , from terre — signifies not only the dog , but a burrow in the earth ; a kind of retreat in which such dogs are supposed to pass a portion of their existence , occupied in the subterrene branches of the chase . It means , also , a land-roll or register . In Lower Canada , which is essentially France , I recollect the label , “ Papier Terrier , ” upon the door of a public-land-office . A friend of mine , clandestinely and under cover of darkness , removed the label , substituting for it a scurrilous one setting forth “ Pasteboard Poodle , ” an announcement which did not appear to convey any particular idea whatever to the unsettled mind of the haggard provincial chef du bureau , as it flashed upon him next morning in the light of the glad young autumn day . But , reverting to pronunciation , tare-ier would , of course , more correctly reverberate the sound of the French original than either of the other usages , while it would possess the advantage of conveying a suggestion of that proclivity for tearing , so characteristic of the animal designated by the term . On this important question the learned philologists wrangle . For my part , I stick to tarrier , which comes “ oncommon handy , ” as the horse-dealer hinted , when reproved by the Cambridge student for reducing a noble animal nearly to the level of a donkey by calling him “ an ‘ oss . ” And of all the terrier tribe , there is no quainter little fellow than he of the Island of Skye ,— known to his friends and admirers as the “ Skye dog . ” This little animal , which , in length of spine , shortness of legs , wildness of hair , and litheness of movement , resembles one of those long , hirsute caterpillars oft-times to be observed by the happy rambler in the country , as it promenades across his path , possesses many distinctive traits , which separate him , in a manner , from Dog in general , assimilating him somewhat , indeed , to the ferce , which find in rapine and carnage the subsistence which Nature evidently has not intended that they should realize in communion with man . The peculiar odor of the fox is his , though in a mitigated degree . He loves to make a lair under the bushes by tearing up the turf with his teeth and paws , and to lie in it . He is of a shy and reserved disposition , and usually more lively at night than by day . These are attributes of beasts of prey . Unlike all other members of the terrier family , he cares nothing about rats . He will sit down and bark in a tone of contempt at one turned out before him in a close passage or room , declining , in fact , to recognize rats as game , unless entered at them while very young . I speak only of the pure , unmixed Isle-of-Skye dog , or “ tassel terrier , ” as he is sometimes called by rabbit-hunters ,— a breed difficult to obtain in perfection , and one which is particularly scarce in this country . The proper game or quarry of this animal is the otter , which he does not hesitate to follow into his very burrow in the river-banks ; nor is he afraid to attack one nearly double his size . Having , time after time , possessed several of these dogs , verified as being derived from the best stock on the island , from which their parents — who understood no language but Gaelic — were brought direct , I have noted some of their odd , whimsical ways , a few of which I will illustrate , taking for my exponent one very remarkable little fellow who was a genuine type of his kind . This animal was one of the smallest of his family , and of a color uncommon among them ; for they are mostly either of a yellowish dun , or of that slaty mouse-color known among dog-fanciers as “ blue , ” — a tint , by the way , particularly appropriate for a dog of Skye . Sometimes they are black ; but Sambo , better known to his familiars as Sam , was of a sooty brindle , with a very dark muzzle , and eyes burning out like black stars from the cloud of shaggy hair that mantled upon his brow . Next to the shortness of his legs , the length of his body was one of the most remarkable physical freaks I remember to have observed ; neither of these attributes , however , having a chance of notice in comparison with the quantity and denseness of his long , soft hair ,— for the coat of a true Skye dog is fleecy , rather than wiry . It was the joint result of the shortness of his legs and the length of his beard that the fatter appendage continually swept the ground ,— an inconvenience which I once undertook to remedy by trimming it off short with scissors . No Turk could have more indignantly resented the process than did that small quadruped ,— his Celtic feelings being so severely wounded by it , in fact , that he abstained from sustenance for three days , putting himself into moral sackcloth and ashes for that period by retiring into his penitential cell under a chest of drawers . When quite a pup , hardly half-grown , he played a trick unaccountable to me at this day as it was then . Sam had the run of the house , and he availed himself of it . On going into the breakfast-room , one morning early , I observed a singular phenomenon in connection with a large , cold round of beef , which was the pi è ce de r é sistance on the table . It was curious to behold a round of cold beef with a tail , which it wagged , and feathered , and beckoned with , as if to say , “ Come , eat me . ” The tail was the tail of Sam , whose body was concealed far down in the interior of the tower of beef , into which he had cut his way with great perseverance and success . But the puzzle was , how he got there ; for there was no chair within reach of the table , and he was much too small to have jumped up on it ; while the theory of the servant , who propounded that he must have climbed up by the table-cloth , tooth over claw , was wild , and simply entitled to the contempt of any person aware of the difference between dog and cat . There is but one acceptable theory on the subject ,— that he was down in the caverns of the beef , tail and all , before it was brought up-stairs , and so escaped notice . Early in life , he contracted — from evil association , perhaps — a vulgar trick of running after carriages and barking at the horses ’ heels , a trick of which I in vain tried to break him . Once , when he was about a year old , I took him up beside me into a high cal è che , in which we were going some distance . The moment the horse started , Sam jumped out to have a bark at his heels , when , to my horror , the wheel of the vehicle , in which there were three of us , went right over the middle of his body , cutting him , apparently , in two ; but he was up in a second , and barking at heels and wheels for half a mile before we could pull up and get him in again . This accident appeared to decide him in the choice of a profession , for he devoted himself energetically , from that hour , to the pursuit and baying-at of all manner of wheeled things propelled by horse-power . A rat he would never touch , although I introduced him to one before he was a year old ; he manifested neither fear of the vermin , nor surprise at it , but simply took no interest in it . He had much pleasure in worrying cats ; but that was owing , I fancy , to a sad discomfiture he once met with from one . Walking through a suburb one day , with Sammy trotting before me in dreamy mood , to which he was much given , a small , but remarkably severe cat made a sudden and very fierce dash at him from a cottage-door , taking him so completely aback , that he tumbled , head over tail , into a deep , dirty pool of green , stagnant water , such as is usually to be seen in the pleasure-grounds environing a suburbo-Hibernian shanty . His appearance , on emerging from that cesspool , was the reverse of majestic ; but the incident gave him such an idea on the subject of cats , that he always persecuted them remorselessly from that day ; nor did he ever again walk through a suburb in any other frame of mind than a particularly wide-awake one , and with his tail up . These dogs are curiously sensitive about their dignity , and sometimes do not recover their elasticity of spirits for several days after having undergone a process of correction . I recollect a singular instance of this sensitiveness displayed by Sambo , in which he also manifested a kind of inferential power wonderfully akin to reason . One morning , a tumult of dogs in the street drew him to the window , out of which he looked by jumping on a chair , just as a troop of “ curs of low degree ” tore past after a rather genteel-looking dog with a kettle tied to his tail . They whirled rapidly by in a turmoil of dust , and clink , and cur-dog yelp , but not so rapidly as to prevent Sam from perceiving the terrible degradation to which a gentleman-dog had been subjected . The sight had a visible effect on his spirits , for he immediately became quite depressed as to tail and mind , a condition which influenced him for a day or two , after which he again appeared comparatively cheerful , and took his place in society with his accustomed cautious conviviality . About a month after this , he was seen coming very slowly along a lane which led up to the back of the house ,— a course hardly ever taken by him , as he was a parlor-dog , and considered himself entitled to the freedom of the hall-door . Creeping on in the shadow of the wall , he arrived with a very crest-fallen aspect at the kitchen-door , where the cause of his ignominious approach was made manifest to those who were watching him . He had a kettle tied to his tail . Now this animal must surely have argued in his own mind , that running away with a tin kettle is a sure way of attracting undesirable notice ; also , that proceeding through a public thoroughfare with such an appendage is injudicious , and likely to result in trouble . The circumstance of the runaway dog and the tumult after him had left its impression upon him ; and , travelling on his experience , he rightly judged that an unpleasant affair of the kind might best be hushed up by quietly making one 's way home through back-lanes and the kitchen-door . Skye terriers , when young , are apt to have a bad trick of gnawing and tearing up articles of wearing apparel , particularly slippers , gaiters , and such other things as are handy to toss up and catch . The fellow I am writing about , when very young , destroyed sundry items of my property in that way . He occupied a buffalo-robe in my room , and I heard him very busy one night about something , but did not pay much attention to it , as he was often lively at night . In the morning , however , on looking for a pair of leather gaiters , I recognized the remains of them , after much investigation , in a mass of pulp , to which they had been reduced by the little beast as completely as they could have been by the most experienced boa-constrictor . This habit I soon broke him of , by chastising him with the remnants of the worried article , when there were any left of substance sufficient to weave into a scourge ; nor did he ever recur to it when grown up , except once , evidencing upon that occasion a remarkable instance of hereditary instinct . Some fur caps , and other articles of winter wear , had been shaken out of their summer quarters for the purpose of beating the moths out of them and ventilating them generally , with a view to which they were placed upon the sill of an open window . By some means Sam obtained access to the room , where he was discovered in the act of mauling a valuable otter-skin cap , which he had selected out of the whole collection for his particular amusement . This dog had never seen an otter ; but his ancestors were noted for their game qualities in the pursuit of that animal , and their speciality must have descended to him . Eventually Sambo lost all his self-respect . He became discontented and addicted to low company , dissipating with vile curs whose owners enjoyed anything but unblemished reputations ,— a fact first notified to me by a clergyman of my acquaintance who knew him well . The worst of this was , that he wore a collar with my name engraved on it in full ; and it was a long time before I had an opportunity of redeeming that misused badge . About the very last time I ever saw him , I think , he came home with one of his eyes gouged out , a split ear , and other marks but too suggestive of the tavern brawl . I then deprived him of his collar ; soon after which he returned to his unsettled course of life , and I never saw him again . The peculiar , otter-like form of these animals , and the buoyancy given to them by their long , floating hair , endow them with great facility for swimming ; while the small compass into which they will pack in a canoe or skiff makes them very useful companions to the sportsman whose propensities are for paddling about “ in the melancholy marshes . ” I made an excellent retriever of one of mine by carrying in my pocket a stuffed snipe , which I would make her hunt up and fetch out of the weeds into which I had thrown it . She would go back half a mile and fetch this , when I had hidden it ever so cunningly in a thicket by the way-side . I also taught her to dive , by making her , while young , fetch up a little bag of shot from the bottom of a bathtub in my room . By throwing this into deeper water , gradually , she would soon go down to a great depth for it . A charge of shot , tied up in a piece of white kid-glove , with a “ neck ” left to hold on by , is a good object for the purpose , as it is readily seen in deep water , and teaches the animal , besides , to nip gingerly ,— a valuable qualification in a retriever . I remember one of these dogs fetching up from a considerable depth the watch of a friend of mine , which had slipped out of his pocket into a clear , still bay , over which he was loitering in his canoe . From times unrecorded until about twenty years ago , the Skye terrier awaited confidently his summons to the sphere of rank and fashion . About that time , the day , which , as the proverb figuratively informs us , it falls to the lot of each individual of the canine race to enjoy , began to shine out brightly for the dog of Skye , the first rays of it that reached him being reflected from no less a luminary than the Crown of Great Britain ; for it was among the Scottish fancies of England 's Queen to adopt as a prime favorite this hitherto obscure quadruped . Reckoned until that time — if anybody took the trouble of computing him at all — as one of the ugliest of his race , he at once found himself invested with all the attributes of a canine Adonis ,— a very Admirable Crichton of dogs ,— perfect in intellect , face , figure , and the Hyperion luxuriance of his copious mane and tail . In our youth , we knew — and hated — a small , unmitigated snob of a dog called the Pug , a kind of work-basket bull-dog , diminutive in size , dyspeptic in temper , disagreeable to contemplate , and distressing to be obliged to admire . One of the missions in society of Skye Terrier — who , when going before a high wind , bears no unapt resemblance to a mop or a wisp of tow — was to mop up Pug , and polish him off the hearth-rug of Fashion ; a mission which he appears to have at least partially accomplished . For now the black muzzle of Pug is but seldom to be seen protruded from carriage-window , biding his time for a snap at the first kid-gloved finger that wags within range of his overlapping tusks in waving salutation to his dowager mistress ,— for , of the dowagers , above all , he was one of the chronic calamities . Oftener , now , are the well-combed whiskers and moustaches of Skye Dog to be recognized , dropping over the drawing-room window-sill , or framed , like a portrait by Landseer , in the panelled sash of the barouche , out of which he gazes pensively with the impressive speculation of the true fl â neur ;— yea , for as men of fashion are , so are their dogs ; and so also of the fighting butcher , who ever has his counterpart in the fighting bull-dog that glowers from his gory stall . This exalted value of Skye Dog , in a commercial point of view , has , of course , given rise to the manufacture of a spurious article ; whence it comes , that , in ninety-nine cases out of a hundred , the animal palmed off on the unsophisticated as genuine has nothing of the real stuff in his constitution , but is simply a shallow imitation , compounded according to prescription ,— one part common cur-terrier to two parts insignificant French poodle . And so I take leave of the Skye terrier with a caveat emptor to the purchaser who does not want to be sold while he buys . The sense of humor must surely exist in individual dogs ; otherwise it would puzzle me to account for the singular practical jokes played off by a water-spaniel once possessed by me . This individual , whose name was Muff , was a rather small-sized one , of the pure Kentish blood ; liver-colored , with a white ring on his neck , and white paws ; close-curled , wicked-eyed , deep-chested , and remarkably powerful for his size . Professionally a retriever ,— and one of great promise , although never fully tested with the gun ,— his leisure hours , which included every one in the twenty-four , were passed in the invention and perpetration of curiously regulated mischiefs , with all of which he took pains to combine an element of the ludicrous . His great spree was to run amuck into a flock of small children coming out of school . If there was a dirty crossing hard by , over which they had to pass , he would wait until they had got half-way , and then , going through them like a rocket , would chuck them down into the mud , right and left , as he sped , keeping straight on in his career until far beyond range of pedagogue 's rod . His trick of making a sudden rush at the heels of unsuspecting persons — and he invariably selected the right sort for his purpose — might often have got me into ugly scrapes , but for the tact with which he invariably ignored his master on such occasions . If pursued , he never came near me for protection , but fled wildly on , assuming the character of a dog “ on the loose , ” belonging to nobody in particular , and quite able to take care of himself . He had a decided objection to street industrials in general , including Italian organ-grinders and image-sellers . Once I saw him crouching stealthily after one of the latter , who was passing through an open square with a tray of casts upon his head ; and before I could get up a whistle or call him off by name , he had darted like a javelin at the legs of the refugee , startling him so much out of the perpendicular that the superstructure of plastic art came to the ground with a crash , top-dressing the sterile soil of the Campus Martius with a coat of manufactured plaster of Paris . Marius , blubbering over the shattered chimney-stacks of Carthage , could not have displayed a more touching classical spectacle than did that modern Roman lamenting to and fro among the fragments of his collapsed martyrs and ruined saints ; nor were his pangs fully assuaged even by the application of the universal panacea to an amount more than double the value of his lost wares . A great difficulty in training this dog was to bring him “ to heel , ” — a still greater one to keep him there when he came . If thrashed into his proper place in his master 's wake , he always resented the indignity by biting him pretty severely in the legs with a savage whimper . This he invariably did on first leaving the house with me , sometimes nipping me so severely , after we had gone a short distance , that I have hesitated whether to go back for a pistol to shoot him , or forward for a pennyworth of biscuit to buy him off . When told to “ hie away , ” the extravagance of his joy knew no bounds . He would have been as invaluable to a tailor as was to the Parisian d é crotteur the poodle instructed by him to sully with his paws the shoes of the passengers ; for , in the exuberance of his gladness , he but too often rent insufferably the vestments of the hapless pedestrians in his line of fire . Sometimes he would turn his assaults upon me , and , springing suddenly at my “ wide-awake , ” take it from my head , trailing it wildly away through the mud , and dropping it in some place where it would be difficult to get at it without wading . Then I would have to conciliate him to fetch it ,— a favor not to be obtained without much stratagem and diplomacy . One of this dog 's abnormal qualities was the bull-dog one of holding on to his antagonist in a fight . But few dogs of his size were able to cope with him ; and I once saw him , when in grips with a fierce bull-terrier by a riverside , precipitate the result by dragging his adversary into the water , and dipping his head under . He would jump off the highest bridge to fetch out of the water anything thrown in for him , never failing to bring it to his master 's feet ,— except once , when he steadily declined to recover from the raging element a cane with which I had , some time previously , administered to him a sound thrashing for some delinquency . On the first occasion of his being accidentally left behind at a ferry across a very wide and rapid river , he swam out some distance after the boat ; but , finding the enterprise a rather hopeless one , soon put back again and waited for the next boat , on board of which he took his place with a tranquil and business-like air . This he regularly did on subsequent occasions , without risking the swim ; and when on board , he always seated himself on the upper deck and as far forward as possible , so as to catch early glimpses of his friends in waiting . Among the gifts of this clever animal , I must not forget to reckon a perception of the truthful in Art . I had a walking-stick , upon the crooked handle of which was carved , with tolerable skill , a pointer 's head . This piece of sculpture was a source of frequent anxiety to Muff ,— his embarrassment apparently arising from the circumstance of his not having the gift of speech wherewith to deliver himself of an opinion on the subject . He would sometimes get up from the sunny spot on the carpet where he lay , walk over to the corner in which the stick was deposited , contemplate the handle attentively , with his head on one side , for several minutes , and then , shaking his head doubtfully , return to his lair with a sigh . Philanthropist as well as critic , he once saved the life of a dissipated old sergeant of dragoons , to whom he had taken a fancy , by rushing into a house which the man had just quitted in a state of intoxication , and so rousing the inmates by his gestures , that they at once followed him into the road , alongside of which the beery old sabreur was found prostrate in a pool of water , setting his face pertinaciously against that hostile element , even to what was very near being his last gasp . Large dogs often appear to take a humorous view of the futile attempts of small ones to accomplish some feat beyond their strength or stature . A friend of mine once possessed a very large animal of a cross between the Mount St. Bernard dog and the English mastiff , and as remarkable for his good-nature as for his great strength and courage . Rambling out one day , accompanied by this trusty friend , they came upon a group of rustics engaged in the ignoble diversion of baiting a badger , an animal much in request among English dog-fanciers as a test for the pluck of their terriers . “ Drawing a badger ” is the proper sporting-phrase ,— the animal being chained to a barrel , from the recesses of which he contends savagely with the fierce little dogs pitted against each other to drag him out within a given time . Nero looked on at the sport with a majestic air of contempt , as dog after dog was withdrawn from the conflict . At length , disgusted with the failures , he watched his opportunity until the badger made a dive from his den at a retreating foe , when , snapping him up by the collar , he thundered away down the road with the barrel flying after , nor ever stopped until he reached home , nearly a mile away , where he safely deposited badger and barrel in the immediate vicinity of his private residence in the stable-yard . One of the worst vices by which a dog can be beset is a propensity for killing sheep . It is not a common vice , but , where it exists , it appears to be inveterate and beyond all hope of reform . Shutting up the delinquent with a dangerous ram has often been recommended as a certain mode of disgusting him with mutton , should he survive the discipline inflicted on him by the avenger of the blood of his race . I can recall but one instance within my experience in which this corrective was tested . It was in the case of a sulky dog of a breed between the red Irish setter and something larger , but less patrician , upon whom the thirst for blood fell at uncertain intervals , impelling him then to devastate the very sheepfolds of which in his capacity as watch-dog he might have been considered as ex officio the guardian . This vile malefactor had been ordered for execution , and the noose was already coiled for his caitiff neck , when a neighbor of his master 's — a great raiser of sheep — begged for him a reprieve , kindly volunteering the use of a truculent , but valuable ram belonging to him , for the purpose of illustrating the homaeopathic theory above alluded to . At nightfall the ram was brought and turned into a paddock , where he was left fettered to the dog with a couple of yards of chain . At the dawn of morning the ram 's master approached confidently the arena of discipline , secure of a result triumphant for his theory . But theory was a delusion in this instance ; for the red dog Tanner sat there alone and surfeited with mutton ,— though there was a good deal of the ram still left . It is wonderful what an amount of crime can be committed , even by a small dog , when , like the Chourineur of Eugene Sue , he is under the glamour of blood . Of this there came to my knowledge a well-authenticated instance , one for the truth of which I can vouch . A settler in a remote bush-district had been to the nearest village , which was many miles from his clearing . It was in March , and the surface of the snow — which was quite two feet deep — was frozen to a hard crust , as he travelled homewards in his cutter , accompanied by a currish dog , not nearly so large as an average pointer . About nightfall , and when some two miles from home , a herd of nine deer crossed his track , struggling away into the woods with uncertain plunges , as the treacherous crust gave way beneath them at every bound . While they were yet in sight , the dog gave chase , and they all disappeared into the dark forest together ; nor did the dog return to the call of his master , who , after whistling to him for a short time , proceeded on his way and drove home without him . Early next morning the cur made his appearance , glutted and gory , and looking the very picture of dissipation . Struck by his appearance , they took the back track on his trail , which led them to a hollow in the bush , where the snow was much trampled and draggled with blood , and in and around which every one of the nine deer lay dead , pulled down and throttled by one miserable cur , who had the mastery over them , because he could run on the surface of the snow , through which they sunk . The dog 's master — at whose shanty I once stayed when on a fishing-excursion — was much mortified at the occurrence , as the deer-hunting season was past , and he was one of Nature 's sportsmen , a game-keeper by instinct . I have but one more anecdote of a dog , for the present ; and that is one for the truth of which I distinctly decline to vouch . It was imparted to me by a calker , who owned a woolly French poodle , which remarkable animal , he informed me , used to swim out regularly once a week ,— on Saturday evenings , I think he said ,— with a large wisp of tow in his mouth , upon the ascension of his fleas into which place of refuge , he would “ let it slide ” down the current and swim back tranquilly to the shore , there to slumber away another week in comparative comfort . [ 1 ] The calker 's dog had probably never read Olaus Magnus , though that worthy Archbishop wrote something very like dog-Latin ; but , as dwellers on the margin of the “ Atlantic , ” we have too great a respect for a prelate who believed in the kraaken and the sea-serpent , not to refer our valued Cynophilist to the Thirty-Ninth Chapter of the Eighteenth Book De Gentibus Septentrionalibus , where he will find the same story told of the fox .— Eds . Atlantic . Having thus calked my Dog-Talk — bark , in fact — with this very tough bit of yarn , I now trustfully commit it to the mercies of the “ Atlantic . ” THE RECKONING . Your thought may recur with mine To a certain place in the city , Where you sometimes have chanced to dine ; If not , why , the more 's the pity ! Did you notice the delicate way Whereby , with the trencher and cup , Comes a hint of the matter of pay , In a counter laid blank side up ? Now ,— not to pervert the intent Of a courtesy gentle and rare , Or observance so civilly meant With disparaging things to compare ,— By the token your messenger brings , Did such services never suggest A likeness to manifold things Of the world , and the flesh , and — the rest ? Command whatsoever you will , To pamper your folly or pride ; You shall find , that unfailingly , still , The counter is laid beside , Silently ,— seemingly fair ,— Till an angel the disk shall turn , And the soul 's great debt , the inscription there , On her vision shall burst and burn ! A TRIP TO CUBA . MATANZAS . A hot and dusty journey of some six hours brought us to Matanzas at high noon . Our companions were Cubans , Spaniards , Americans , and game-chickens , that travel extensively in these parts , sometimes in little baskets , with openings for the head and tail , sometimes in the hands of their owners , secured only by a string fastened to one foot and passed over the body . They seem to be objects of tender solicitude to those who carry them ; they are nursed and fondled like children , and at intervals are visited all round by a negro , who fills his mouth with water , and squirts it into their eyes and under their feathers . They are curiously plucked on the back and about the tail , where only the long tail-feathers are allowed to grow . Their tameness in the hands of their masters is quite remarkable ; they suffer themselves to be turned and held in any direction . But when set down , at any stage of the journey , they stamp their little feet , stretch their necks , crow , and look about them for the other cock with most belligerent eyes . As we have said that the negro of the North is an ideal negro , so we must say that the game-cock of Cuba is an ideal chicken , a fowl that is too good to be killed ,— clever enough to fight for people who are too indolent and perhaps too cowardly to fight for themselves ,— in short , the gladiator of the tropics . Well , as we have said , we and they arrived at our journey 's end in the extreme heat of the day ; and having shown our paper and demanded our trunks , we beat an instantaneous retreat before the victorious monarch of the skies , and lo ! the Ensor House , dirty , bare , and comfortless , was to us as a fortress and a rock of defence . Here I would gladly pause , and , giving vent to my feelings , say how lovely I found Matanzas . But ever since Byron 's time , the author is always hearing the public say , “ Do n't be poetical , ” etc ., etc . ; and in these days both writer and reader seem to have discovered that life is too short for long descriptions ,— so that , when the pen of a G. P. R. James , waiting for the inspirations of its master , has amused itself with sketching a greater or less extent of natural scenery , the rule of the novel-reader is invariably , “ Skip landscape , etc ., to event on thirty-second page . ” Nevertheless , I will say that Matanzas is lovely ,— with the fair harbor on one hand and the fair hills on the other , sitting like a mother between two beautiful daughters , who looks from one to the other and wonders which she loves best . The air from the water is cool and refreshing , the sky is clear and open , and the country around seems to beckon one to the green bosom of its shades . “ Ob , what a relief after Havana ! ” one says , drawing a full breath , and remembering with a shudder the sickening puffs from its stirring streets , which make you think that Polonius lies unburied in every house , and that you nose him as you pass the door and window-gratings . With this exclamation and remembrance , you lower yourself into one of Mr. Ensor 's rocking-chairs ,— twelve of which , with a rickety table and a piano , four crimson tidies and six white ones , form the furniture of the Ensor drawing-room ,— you lean your head on your hand , close your eyes , and wish for a comfortable room , with a bed in it . A tolerable room you shall have ; but for a bed , only a cot-bedstead with a sacking bottom ,— further , nothing . Now , if you are some folks that I know , you will be able to establish very comfortable repose on this slender foundation , Nature having so amply furnished you that you are your own feather-bed , bolster , sofa-cushion , and easy-chair , a moving mass of upholstery , wanting only a frame to be set down in and supported . But if you should be one of Boston 's normal skeletons , pinched in every member with dyspepsia , and with the mark of the beast neuralgia on your forehead , then your skin will have a weary time of it , holding your bones , and you will be fain to entreat with tears the merciful mediation of a mattress . Now I know very well that those of my readers who intend visiting Cuba will be much more interested in statistics of hotels than in any speculations , poetical or philosophical , with which I might be glad to recompense their patience . Let me tell them , therefore , that the Ensor House is neither better nor worse than other American hotels in Cuba . The rooms are not very bad , the attendance not intolerable , the table almost commendable . The tripe , salt-fish , and plantains were , methought , much as at other places . There were stews of meat , onions , sweet pippins , and ochra , which deserve notice . The early coffee was punctual ; the tea , for a wonder , black and hot . True , it was served on a bare pine table , with the accompaniment only of a bit of dry bread ,— no butter , cake , nor dulces . But Mr. Ensor has heard , no doubt , that sweet things are unwholesome , and is determined , at whatever cost to his own feelings , to keep them out of the way of his guests , who are , for the time , his children . Then there is an excellent English servant called John , whom , though the fair Ensor did berate him , we must enumerate among the comforts of the establishment . There is a dark corner about volantes , which they are disposed to order for you at a very unreasonable profit ; but as there are plenty of livery stables at hand , and street volantes passing all the time , it will be your own fault , if you pay six dollars where you ought to pay three . The first thing to be done at Matanzas is to drive out and see the Cumbre , a hill in the neighborhood , and from it the valley of the Yumori . The road is an improvement on those already described ,— the ruts being much deeper and the rocks much larger ; the jolting is altogether more complete and effective . Still , you remember the doctrine that the volante cannot upset , and this blind faith to which you cling carries you through triumphantly . The Cumbre is lofty , the view extensive , and the valley lovely , of a soft , light green , like the early leaves and grass of spring , dotted everywhere with the palms and their dark clusters . It opens far , far down at your feet , and on your left you see the harbor quiet and bright in the afternoon sun , with a cheering display of masts and pennons . You would look and linger long , but that the light will wane , and you are on your way to Jenks his sugar-plantation , the only one within convenient distance of the town . Here the people are obviously accustomed to receive visitors , and are decently , not superfluously , civil . The major-domo hands you over to a negro who speaks English , and who salutes you at once with , “ Good-bye , Sir ! ” The boiling here is conducted in one huge , open vat . A cup and saucer are brought for you to taste the juice , which is dipped out of the boiling vat for your service . It is very like balm-tea , unduly sweetened ; and after a hot sip or so you return the cup with thanks . A loud noise , as of cracking of whips and of hurrahs , guides you to the sugar-mill , where the crushing of the cane goes on in the jolliest fashion . The building is octagonal and open . Its chief feature is a very large horizontal wheel , which turns the smaller ones that grind the cane . Upon this are mounted six horses , driven by as many slaves , male and female , whose exertions send the wheel round with sufficient rapidity . This is really a novel and picturesque sight . Each negro is armed with a short whip , and their attitudes , as they stand , well-balanced on the revolving wheel , are rather striking . They were liberal of blows and of objurgations to the horses ; but all their cries and whipping produced scarcely a tenth of the labor so silently performed by the invisible , noiseless slave that works the steam-engine . From this we wandered about the avenues , planted with palms , cocoas , and manifold fruit-trees ,— visited the sugar-fields , where many slaves were cutting the canes and piling them on enormous ox-carts , and came at last to a great , open field , where many head of cattle were quietly standing . Our negro guide had not been very lavish or intelligible in his answers to our numerous questions . We asked him about these cattle . “ Dey cows , ” he replied . We asked if they gave milk , and if butter was made on the plantation . He seemed quite puzzled and confused , and finally exclaimed ,— “ Dat cows no got none wife . ” Coming nearer , we found that the cows were draught oxen , employed in dragging the canes and other produce of the plantation . Jenks his garden we found in good order , and beautiful with many plants in full blossom ; but Jenks his house seemed dreary and desolate , with no books , a wretched print or so , dilapidated furniture , and beds that looked like the very essence of nightmare . Nothing suggested domestic life or social enjoyment , or anything —; but as Jenks is perfectly unknown to us , either by appearance or reputation , we give only a guess in the dark , and would suggest , in case it may displease him , that he should refurnish and repaint a little , and diffuse an air of cheerfulness over his solitary villa , remembering that Americans have imaginations , and that visitors will be very apt to construct an unknown host from his surroundings . The second thing to be done in Matanzas , if you arrive on Saturday , is to attend military mass at the Cathedral on Sunday morning . This commences at eight o'clock ; but the hour previous may be advantageously employed in watching the arrival and arrangement of the female aristocracy of Matanzas . These enter in groups of twos and threes , carrying their prayer-books , and followed by slaves of either sex , who bear the prayer-carpet of their mistresses . The ladies are wonderfully got up , considering the early hour ; and their toilettes suggest that they may not have undressed since the ball of the night before . All that hoops , powder , and puffery can do for them has been done ; they walk in silk attire , and their hair is what is technically termed dressed . Some of them bring their children , bedizened like dolls , and mimicking mamma 's gestures and genuflexion in a manner more provoking to sadness than to satire . If the dressing is elaborate , the crossing is also . It does not consist of one simple cross , “ in nomine Patris , ” etc . ; they seem to make three or four crosses from forehead to chin , and conclude by kissing the thumb-nail , in honor of what we could not imagine . Entering the middle aisle , which is divided from the rest by a row of seats on either side , they choose their position , and motion to the dark attendant to spread the carpet . Some of them evince considerable strategic skill in the selection of their ground . All being now in readiness , they drop on their knees , spread their flounces , cross themselves , open their books , and look about them . Their attendants retire a little , spread a handkerchief on the ground , and modestly kneel behind them , obviously expecting to be saved with the family . These are neatly , sometimes handsomely dressed . In this status things remain until the music of the regiment is heard . With a martial sound of trumpets it enters the church , and fills the aisles , the officers taking place within the chancel , and a guard-of-honor of eight soldiers ranging on either side of the officiating priest . And now our devotions begin in good earnest ; for , simultaneously with the regiment , the jeunesse dor é e of Matanzas has made its appearance , and has spread itself along the two long lines of demarcation which separate the fair penitents from the rest of the congregation . The ladies now spread their flounces again , and their eyes find other occupation than the dreary Latin of their missals . There is , so to speak , a lively and refreshing time between the youths of both sexes , while the band plays its utmost , and Evangel , Kyrie , and Credo are recited to the music of Trovatore and Traviata . That child of four years old , dressed in white and gold flounces , and white satin boots with heels , handles her veil and uses her eyes like mamma , eager for notice , and delighted with the gay music and uniforms . The moment comes to elevate the Host , thump goes the drum , the guard presents arms , and the soldiers , instead of kneeling , bend forward , in a most uncomfortable manner . Another thump , and all that is over ; the swords are returned to their sheaths , and soon , the loud music coming to an end , the regiment marches out of church , very much as it marched in , its devotional experiences being known to Heaven alone . Ladies and lovers look their last , the flounces rise in pyramids , the prayer-carpets are rolled up , and , with a silken sweep and rush , Youth , Beauty , and Fashion forsake the church , where Piety has hardly been , and go home to breakfast . To that comfortable meal you also betake yourself , musing on the small heads and villanous low foreheads of the Spanish soldiery , and wondering how long it would take a handful of resolute Yankees to knock them all into — But you are not a filibuster , you know . THE PASEO — THE PLAZA — DINING OUT . “ As this Sunday is Carnival , you cannot do better than drive about the city , and then go to the Plaza to see the masks . My partner 's wife , with whom you have now so comfortably breakfasted , will call for you in her volante , between five and six o'clock . She will show you the Paseo , and we will go and see the masks afterwards . ” So spoke a banker , who , though not our banker , is our friend , and whose kind attentions we shall ever recall , when we remember Cuba . So he spoke , and so it befell . The pretty American lady , Cubanized into paleness , but not into sallowness , called at the appointed hour , and , in her company , we visited the principal streets , and the favorite drive of the Matanzasts . The Paseo is shorter than that of Havana , but much prettier . We found it gay with volantes , whose fair occupants kept up an incessant bowing and smiling to their friends in carriages and on horseback . The Cubans are generally good riders , and their saddle-horses have the easiest and pleasantest gait imaginable . The heat of the climate does not allow the severe exercise of trot and gallop , and so these creatures go along as smoothly and easily as the waves of the sea , and are much better broken to obedience . The ladies of Matanzas seem to possess a great deal of beauty , but they abuse the privilege of powder , and whiten themselves with cascarilla to a degree that is positively ghastly . This cascarilla is formed by the trituration of eggshells ; and the oval faces whitened with it resemble a larger egg , with features drawn on it in black and red . In spite of this , they are handsome ; but one feels a natural desire to rush in amongst them with a feather duster , and lay about one a little , before giving an available opinion of their good looks . If the Paseo was gay , the streets of the city were gay also ; the windows filled with faces and figures in full dress , with little groups of children at the feet of the grown people , like the two world-famous cherubs at the feet of the Madonna di San Sisto . There were crowds of promenaders too , everywhere , interspersed with parties of maskers , who went about screaming at the public with high , shrill voices . Leaving the volante , we descend to the Plaza , where is now the height and centre of movement . We find it flanked on all sides with little movable kitchens , where good things are cooked , and with tables , where they are sold and eaten . Fried cakes , fish , and meats seem the predominant bill of fare , with wine , coffee , and fruits . The masks are circulating with great animation ; men in women 's clothes , white people disguised as negroes , and negroes disguised as whites , prodigious noses , impossible chins and foreheads ; the stream of popular fancy ran chiefly in these channels . We met processions consisting of a man carrying a rat in a cage , and shouting out , “ Catch this rat ! ” followed by a perfect stampede of wild creatures , all yelling , “ Catch that rat ! ” at the top of their voices . The twanging of the guitar is heard everywhere , accompanied by the high nasal voices of the natives , in various strains of monotony . In some spots the music is more lively , accompanied by the shaking of a gourd filled with dry seeds , which is called ghiera , and whose “ chick-a-chick , chick-chick ” takes the place of the more poetical castanets ;— here you find one or more couples exhibiting their skill in Cuban dances , with a great deal of applause and chattering from the crowd around . Beside those of the populace , many aristocratic groups parade the Plaza , in full dress , crowned with flowers and jewels ;— a more motley scene can hardly be imagined . Looking up , one sees in curious contrast the tall palms with which the Plaza is planted , and the quiet , wondering stars set in the deep tropical heavens . But in our evening 's programme , tea has been omitted ; now , what availeth a Bostonian without his tea ? By eight o'clock , we are pensive , “ most like a tired child at a show , ” — by half-past eight , stupid ,— by nine , furious . Two hours of folly , taken on an empty stomach , alarm us for our constitution . A visit to the caf é is suggested and adopted . It proves to be crowded with people in fancy attire , who have laid aside their masks to indulge in beer , orgeat , and sherbet . While our Cuban friends regale themselves with soursop and zapote ice sweetened with brown sugar , we call for a cup of delicious Spanish chocolate , which is served with a buttered toasted roll , worthy of all imitation . Oh , how much comfort is in a little cup of chocolate ! what an underpinning does it afford our spiritual house , a material basis for our mental operations ! In its support , we go it a little longer on the Plaza , see more masks , hear more guitars and “ catch-this-rat ! ” and finally return , in a hired volante , to the Ensor House , where rest and the bedless cots await us . But we have friends in Matanzas , real born Cubans , who will not suffer us to remain forever in the Ensor House . They send their volante for us , one day , and we visit them . Their house , of the inevitable Cuban pattern , is richly furnished ; the marbles of the floor are pure and smooth , the rug ample and velvety ; the wainscoting of the walls , so to speak , is in handsome tiling ,— not in mean , washy painting ; the cane chairs and sofas are fresh and elegant , and there is a fine Erard piano . The master of the house is confined to his room by illness , but will be happy to see us . His son and daughters speak English with fluency . They inform us , that the epidemic colds which prevail in Cuban winters are always called by the name of some recent untoward occurrence , and that their father , who suffers from severe influenza , has got the President 's Message . We find Don Jos é in a bedroom darkened by the necessary closing of the shutters , there being no other way of excluding the air . The bedsteads are of gilded iron , with luxurious bedding and spotless mosquito-nettings . His head is tied up with a silk handkerchief . He rises from his rocking-chair , receives us with great urbanity , and expresses his appreciation of the American nation and their country , which he himself has visited . After a short interview we leave him , but not until he has placed his house and all it contains “ á la disposicion de Usted . ” We are then shown the pretty bedroom of the young ladies , whose toilettes are furnished in silver , the bath lined with tiling , the study , and the dining-room , where luncheon awaits us . We take leave , with a kind invitation to return and dine the next day , which , upon mature deliberation , we accept . The volante comes for us next day , with Roque , brightest of all living caleseros , fixed in his boots and saddle . After a pleasant drive we attain the house , and are received by its hospitable inmates as before . The interval before dinner , a tolerably long one , is filled up by pleasant chitchat , chiefly in English . The lady of the house does not , however , profess our vernacular , and to her understanding we lay siege in French , Italian , and laughter-provoking Spanish . Before dining we pay a second visit to the host , who is still busy digesting the President 's Message . Obviously , the longer he has it under consideration , the worse he finds it . He has nausea from its bragging , his head aches with its loudness , and its emptiness fills him with wind . We are at our wits ’ end to prescribe for him , and take our leave with grave commiseration , telling him that we , too , have had it , but that the symptoms it produces in the North are a reddening in the cheek and a spasmodic contraction of the right arm . Now comes great dinner on . A slave announces it , and with as little ceremony as may be we take our places . And here we must confess that our friend the banker had rendered us an important service . For he had said ,— “ Look not upon the soup when it is hot , neither let any victuals entice thee to more than a slight and temporary participation ; for the dishes at a Cuban dinner be many , and the guest must taste of all that is presented ; wherefore , if he indulge in one dish to his special delectation , he shall surely die before the end . ” And it came to pass that we remembered this , and walked through the dinner as on egg-shells , gratifying curiosity , on the one hand , and avoiding satiety , on the other , with the fear of fulness , as it were , before our eyes . For , oh , my friends ! what pang is comparable to too much dinner , save the distress of being refused by a young woman , or the comfortless sensation , in times of economy , of having paid away a five-dollar gold piece in place of a silver quarter of a dollar ? But you , Reader , would like more circumstantiality in the account of this dinner , which united many perfections . It was handsome , but not splendid ,— orderly , but , not stately ,— succulent , but not unctuous . It kept the word of promise to the smell and did not break it to the taste . It was a dinner such as we shall wish only to our best friends , not to those acquaintances who ask how we do when they meet us , and wish we were dead before we part . As for particulars , we should be glad to impart much useful information and many choice receipts ; but the transitory nature of such an entertainment does not allow one to improve it as one could wish . One feature we remember , which is that the whole dinner was placed on the table at once , and so you had the advantage of seeing your work cut out before you . None of that hope deferred , when , after being worried through a dozen stews and entr é es , you are rewarded at last with an infinitesimal fragment of the r ô ti . Nor , on the other hand , the unwelcome surprise of three supplementary courses and a dessert , when you have already dined to repletion , and feel yourself at peace with all the world . Here , all was fair play ; you knew what to expect and what was expected of you . Soup , of course , came first ,— then fish ,— then meat stewed with potatoes and onions ,— then other meat with ochra and tomatoes ,— then boiled chicken , which is eaten with a pilaff of rice colored with saffron ,— then delicious sweet potatoes , yams , plantains , and vegetables of every sort ,— then a kind of pepper , brought , we think , from the East Indies , and intensely tropical in its taste ,— then a splendid roast turkey , and ham strewed with small colored sugar-plums ,— then — well , is not that enough for one person to have eaten at a stretch , and that person accustomed to a Boston diet ? Then came such a display of sweetmeats as would exercise the mind of a New England housekeeper beyond all power of repose ,— a pudding ,— a huge tart with very thick crust ,— cakes of yuca ,— a dish of cocoanut , made into a sort of impalpable preserve , with eggs and sugar ,— then a course of fruits ,— then coffee , of the finest quality , from the host 's own plantation ,— and then we arose and went into the drawing-room , with a thankful recollection of what we had had , and also a thankful assurance that we should have no more . A drive by moonlight was now proposed , to see the streets and the masks , it being still Carnival . So the volante was summoned , with its smiling , silent Roque , and the pretty daughter of the house took seat beside us . The streets around the Plaza proved quite impassable from the crowd , whose wild movements and wilder voices went nigh to scaring the well-trained horses . The little lady was accustomed , apparently , to direct every movement of her charioteer , and her orders were uttered in a voice high and sweet as a bird-call . “ Dobla al derecho , Roque ! Roque , dobla al derecho ! ” Why did not Roque go mad , and exclaim ,— “ Yes , Se ñ orita , and to heaven itself , if you bid me so prettily ! ” But Roque only doubled as he was bid , and took us hither and thither , and back to the nest of his lady-bird , where we left her and the others with grateful regrets , and finally back to the Ensor House , which on this occasion seemed to us the end of all things . GAME-CHICKENS — DON RODRIGUEZ — DAY ON THE PLANTATION — DE-PARTURE . As there are prejudices in Cuba , and elsewhere , touching the appropriate sphere of woman , Halia was not taken to the cockpit , as she had demanded and expected ,— not to see the chickens fight , but to see the Spaniards see it . Forgive her , ye Woman'shYpppHeNRighters , if on this occasion she was weak and obedient ! You would have gone , no doubt ,— those of you who have not husbands ; but such as have must know how much easier it is to deal with the article man in his theoretical than in his real presence . You may succeed in showing by every convincement , that you are his natural master and superior , and that there is every reason on earth why you should command and direct him . “ No ! —— , ” says the wretch , shaking his fist , or shrugging his shoulders ; and whatever your intimate convictions may be , the end is , that you do not . Propitiated by that ready obedience which is safest , dear sisters , in these contingencies , the proprietor of Halia takes her , one morning , to see the establishment of a man of fortune in the neighborhood , where one hundred and forty game-chickens are kept for training and fighting . These chickens occupy two good-sized rooms , whose walls are entirely covered with compartments , some two feet square , in each of which resides a cock , with his little perch and drinking-vessel . They are kept on allowance of water and of food , lest they should get beyond fighting-weight . Their voices are uplifted all day long , and on all moonlight nights . An old woman receives us , and conducts us to the training-pit , pointing out on the way the heroes of various battles , and telling us that this cock and the other have won mucho dinero , “ much money . ” Each has also its appointed value ;— this cock is worth forty dollars , this four ounces , this one six ounces ,— oh , he is a splendid fellow ! No periodal and sporadic hen-fever prevails here , but the gallo-mania is the chronic madness of the tropics . The training-pit is a circular space inclosed with boards , perhaps some twelve feet in diameter . Here we find the proprietor , Don Manuel Rodriguez , with a negro assistant , up to the ears in business . Don Manuel is young , handsome , and vivacious , and with an air of good family that astonishes us . He receives us with courtesy , finds nothing unusual in the visit of a lady , but is too much engrossed with his occupation to accord us more than a passing notice . This is exactly as we could wish ,— it allows us to study the Don , so to speak , au naturel . He is engaged at first in weighing two cocks , with a view to their subsequent fighting . Having ascertained their precise weight , which he registers in his pocket-memorandum , he proceeds to bind strips of linen around their formidable spurs , that in their training they may not injure each other with them . This being accomplished ,— he all the while delivering himself with great volubility to his black second ,— the two cocks are taken into the arena ; one is let loose there ; the negro holds the other , and knocks the free fowl about the head with it . Sufficient provocation having been given , they are allowed to go at each other in their own fashion , and their attacks and breathing-spells are not very unlike a bout of fencing . They flap , fly at each other , fly over , peck , seize by the neck , let go , rest a moment , and begin again , getting more and more excited with each round . The negro separates them , when about to draw blood . And as for Don Manuel , he goes mad over them , like an Italian maestro over his favorite pupil . “ Hombre , hombre ! ” he cries to the negro , “ what a cock ! By Heaven , what a couple ! Ave Mar í a sant í sima ! did one ever see such spirit ? Sant í sima Trinidad ! is there such fighting in all Matanzas ? ” Having got pretty well through with the calendar of the saints , he takes out his watch ;— the fight has lasted long enough . One of the champions retires to take a little repose ; another is brought in his place ; the negro takes him , and boxes him about the ears of the remaining fowl ,— brushing him above his head , and underneath , and on his back , to accustom him to every method of attack . Don Manuel informs us that the cock made use of in this way is the father of the other , and exclaims , with an air of mock compassion , Pobre padre ! “ Poor father ! ” The exercise being concluded , he takes a small feather , and cleans out therewith the throat of either chicken , which proves to be full of the sand of the arena , and which he calls porquer í a , “ dirt . ” We leave Don Manuel about to employ himself with other cocks , and , as before , too much absorbed to give our departure much notice . Strange to say , Hulia is so well satisfied with this rehearsal , that she expresses no further desire to witness the performance itself . We learn subsequently that Don Manuel is a man of excellent family and great wealth , who has lavished several fortunes on his favorite pursuit , and is hurrying along on the road to ruin as fast as chickens ’ wings can carry him . We were very sorry , but could n't possibly interfere . Meantime , he appeared excessively jolly . Our kind friends of the dinner were determined to pay us , in their persons , all the debts of hospitality the island might be supposed to contract towards strangers and Americans . Arrangements were accordingly made for us to pass our last day in Matanzas at a coffee-plantation of theirs , some four miles distant from town . They would send their travelling volante for us , they said , which was not so handsome as the city volante , but stronger , as it had need to be , for the roads . At eleven o'clock , on a very warm morning , this vehicle made its appearance at the door of the Ensor House , with Roque in the saddle ,— Roque with that mysterious calesero face of his , knowing everything , but volunteering nothing until the word of command . Don Anto ñ ito , he tells us , has gone before us on horseback ;— we mount the volante , and follow . Roque drives briskly at first , a slight breeze refreshes us , and we think the road better than is usual . But wait a bit , and we come to what seems an unworked quarry of coral rock , with no perceptible way over it , and Roque still goes on , slowly indeed , but without stop or remark . The strong horses climb the rough and slippery rocks , dragging the strong volante after them . The calesero picks his way carefully ; the carriage tips , jolts , and tumbles ; the centre of gravity appears to be nowhere . The breeze dies away ; the vertical sun seems to pin us through the head ; we get drowsy , and dream of an uneasy sea of stones , whose harsh waves induce headache , if not seasickness . We wish for a photograph of the road ;— first , to illustrate the inclusive meaning of the word ; second , to serve as a remembrance , to reconcile us to all future highways . Why these people are content to work out their road-tax by such sore travail of mind and body appeareth to us mysterious . The breaking of stone in state-prison is not harder work than riding over a Cuban road ; yet this extreme of industry is endured by the Cubans from year to year , and from one human life to another , without complaint or effort . An hour or more of these and similar reflections brings us to a bit of smooth road , and then to the gate of the plantation , where a fine avenue of palms conducts us to the house . Here resides the relative and partner of our Matanzas friends , a man of intelligent and humane aspect , who comes to greet us , with his pleasant wife , and a pretty niece , their constant guest . This lady has made use of her retirement for the accomplishment of her mind . She has some knowledge of French and Italian , and , though unwilling to speak English , is able to translate from that language with entire fluency . The plantation-house is very pretty , situated just at the end of the palm-avenue , with all the flowers in sight ,— for these are planted between the palms ;— it has a deep piazza in front , and the first door opens into one large room , with sleeping-apartments on either side . Opposite this door is another , opening upon the court behind the house , and between the two our chairs are placed , courting the draught .— N. B . In Cuba , no one shuns a draught ; you ride , drive , sit , and sleep in one , and , unless you are a Cuban , never take cold . The floor of this principal room is merely of clay , rubbed with a red powder , which , mixed with water , hardens into a firm , polished surface . The house has but one story ; the timbers of the roof , unwhitened , forming the only ceiling . The furniture consists of cane easy-chairs , a dining-table , and a pretty hammock , swung across one end of the room . Here we sit and talk long . Our host has many good books in French and Spanish ,— and in English , Walter Scott 's Novels , which his wife fully appreciates . A walk is proposed , and we go first to visit los negros chiquitos ,— Anglic è, “ the small niggers , ” in their nursery . We find their cage airy enough ; it is a house with a large piazza completely inclosed in coarse lattice-work , so that the peque ñ uelos cannot tumble out , nor the nurses desert their charge . Our lady friend produces a key , unlocking a small gate which admits us . We found , as usual , the girls of eight and upwards tending the babies , and one elderly woman superintending them . On our arrival , African drums , formed of logs hollowed out , and covered with skin at the end , were produced . Two little girls proceeded to belabor these primitive instruments , and made a sort of rhythmic strumming , which kept time to a monotonous chant . Two other girls executed a dance to this , which , for its slowness , might be considered an African minuet . The dancing children were bright-looking , and not ungraceful . Work stops at noon for a recess ; and the mothers run from the field to visit the imprisoned babies , whom they carry to their own homes and keep till the afternoon-hour for work comes round , which it does at two P. M. We went next to the negro-houses , which are built , as we have described others , contiguous , in one hollow square . On this plantation the food of the negroes is cooked for them , and in the middle of the inclosed square stood the cooking-apparatus , with several large caldrons . Still , we found little fires in most of the houses , and the inmates employed in concocting some tidbit or other . A hole in the roof serves for a chimney , where there is one , but they as often have the fire just before their door . The slaves on this plantation looked in excellent condition , and had , on the whole , cheerful countenances . The good proportion of their increase showed that they were well treated , as on estates where they are overworked they increase scarcely or not at all . We found some of the men enjoying a nap between a board and a blanket . Most of the women seemed busy about their household operations . The time from twelve to two is given to the negroes , besides an hour or two after work in the evening , before they are locked up for the night . This time they improve mostly in planting and watering their little gardens , which are their only source of revenue . The negroes on this estate had formed a society amongst themselves for the accumulation of money ; and our friend , the manager of the plantation , told us that they had on his books two thousand dollars to their credit . One man alone had amassed six hundred dollars , a very considerable sum , under the circumstances . We visited also the house of the mayoral , or overseer , whose good face seemed in keeping with the general humane arrangements of the place ,— as humane , at least , as the system permits . The negroes all over the island have Sunday for themselves ; and on Sunday afternoons they hold their famous balls , which sometimes last until four o'clock on Monday morning . Much of the illness among the negroes is owing to their imprudence on these and like occasions . Pneumonia is the prevalent disease with them , as with the slaves in our own South ; it is often acute and fatal . Everything in Cuba has such a tendency to go on horseback , that we could not forbear asking if dead men did , and were told that it was so ,— the dead negroes being temporarily inclosed in a box , and conveyed to the cemetery on the back of a horse . Our friend , seeing our astonishment , laughed , and told us that the poor whites were very glad to borrow the burial-horse and box , to furnish their own funerals . Dinner was served at four o'clock , quite informally , in the one sitting-room of the house . A black girl brushed off the flies with a paper fly-brush , and another waited on table . The dinner was excellent ; but I have already given so many bills of fare in these letters , that I will content myself with mentioning the novelty of a Cuban country-dish , a sort of stew , composed of ham , beef , mutton , potatoes , sweet potatoes , yuca , and yams . This is called Ayacco , and is a characteristic dish , like eel-soup in Hamburg , or salt codfish in Boston ;— as is usual in such cases , it is more relished by the inhabitants than by their visitors . On the present occasion , however , it was only one among many good things , which were made better by pleasant talk , and were succeeded by delicious fruits and coffee . After dinner we visited the vegetable garden , and the well , where we found Candido , the rich negro who had saved six hundred dollars , drawing water with the help of a blind mule . Now the philanthrope of our party was also a phrenologist , and had conceived a curiosity to inspect the head of the very superior negro who had made all this money ; so , at his request , Candido was summoned from the well , and ordered to take off his hat . This being removed disclosed the covering of a cotton handkerchief , of which he was also obliged to divest himself . Candido was much too well bred to show any signs of contumacy ; but the expression of his countenance varied , under the observation of the phrenologist , from wonder to annoyance , and from that to the extreme of sullen , silent wrath . The reason was obvious ,— he supposed himself brought up with a view to bargain and sale ; and when informed that he had a good head , he looked much inclined to give somebody else a bad one . He was presently allowed to go back to his work ; and our sympathies went with him , as it would probably take some days to efface from his mind the painful impression that he was to be sold , the last calamity that can happen to a negro who is in kind hands . We now wandered through the long avenues of palm and fruit trees with which the estate was planted , and saw the stout black wenches at their out-door occupations , which at this time consisted chiefly in raking and cleansing the ground about the roots of the trees and flowers . Their faces brightened as their employers passed , and the smaller children kissed hands . Returned to the house , we paused awhile to enjoy the evening red , for the sun was already below the horizon . Then came the volante , and with heartfelt thanks and regrets we suffered it to take us away . And who had been the real hero of this day ? Who but Roque , fresh from town , with his experience of Carnival , and his own accounts of the masked ball , the Paseo , and the Se ñ orita 's beaux ? All that durst followed him to the gate , and kissed hands after him . “ Adios , Roque ! Roque , adios ! ” resounded on all sides ; and Roque , the mysterious one , actually smiled in conscious superiority , as he nodded farewell , and galloped off , dragging us after him . As we drove back to Matanzas in the moonlight , a sound of horses ’ feet made us aware that Don Anto ñ ito , the young friend who had planned and accompanied our day 's excursion , was to be our guard of honor on the lonely road . A body-servant accompanied him , likewise mounted . Don Anto ñ ito rode a milk-white Cuban pony , whose gait was soft , swift , and stealthy as that of a phantom horse . His master might have carried a brimming glass in either hand , without spilling a drop , or might have played chess , or written love-letters on his back , so smoothly did he tread the rough , stony road . All its pits and crags and jags , the pony made them all a straight line for his rider , whose unstirred figure and even speech made this quite discernible . For when a friend talks to you on the trot , much gulping doth impede his conversation ,— and there is even a good deal of wallop in a young lady 's gallop . But our friend 's musical Spanish ran on like a brook with no stones in it , that merely talks to the moonlight for company . And such moonlight as it was that rained down upon us , except where the palm-trees spread their inverted parasols , and would n't let it ! And such a glorification of all trees and shrubs , including the palm , which we are almost afraid to call again by name , lest it should grow “ stuck up , ” and imagine there were no other trees but itself ! And such a combination of tropical silence , warmth , and odor ! Even in the night , we did not forget that the aloe-hedges had red in them , which made all the ways beautiful by day . Oh ! it was what good Bostonians call “ a lovely time ” ; and it was with a sigh of fulness that we set down the goblet of enjoyment , drained to the last drop , and getting , somehow , always sweeter towards the bottom . For it was set down at the Ensor House , which we are to leave to-night , half-regretful at not having seen the scorpion by which we always expected to be bitten ; for we had heard such accounts of it , patrolling the galleries with its venomous tail above its head , that we had thought a sight might be worth a bite . It was not to be , however . The luggage is brought ; John is gratified with a peso ; and we take leave with entire goodwill . I mention our departure , only because it was Cuban and characteristic . Returning by boat to Havana , we were obliged to be on board by ten o'clock that evening , the boat starting at eleven . Of course , the steamer was nowhere but a mile out in the stream ; and a little cockle-shell of a row-boat was our only means of attaining her . How different , ye good New Yorkers and Bostonians , from your afternoon walk on board the “ Bay State , ” with valise and umbrella in hand , and all the flesh-pots of Egypt in — well , in remembrance ! After that degree of squabbling among the boatmen which serves to relieve the feelings of that habitually disappointed class of men , we chose our craft , and were rowed to the steamer , whose sides were steep and high out of water . The arrangements on board were peculiar . The body of the main deck was occupied by the gentlemen 's cabin , which was large and luxurious . A tiny after-cabin was fitted up for the ladies . In the region of the machinery were six horrible staterooms , bare and dirty , the berths being furnished simply with cane-bottoms , a pillow , and one unclean sheet . Those who were decoyed into these staterooms endured them with disgust while the boat was at anchor ; but when the paddle-wheels began to revolve , and dismal din of clang and bang and whirr came down about their ears , and threatened to unroof the fortress of the brain , why , then they fled madly , precipitately , leaving their clothes mostly behind them . But I am anticipating . The passengers arrived and kept arriving ; and we watched , leaning over the side , for Don Anto ñ ito , who was to accompany our voyage . Each boat had its little light ; and to see them dancing and toppling on the water was like a fairy scene . At last came our friend ; and after a little talk and watching of the stars , we betook ourselves to rest . Many of the Dons were by this time undressed , and smoking in their berths . As there was no access to the ladies ’ cabin , save through the larger one , she who went thither awaited a favorable moment and ran , looking neither to the right hand nor the left . The small space was tolerably filled by Cuban ladies in full dress .— Mem . They always travel in their best clothes .— The first navigation among them was a real balloon-voyage , with collisions ; but they soon collapsed and went to bed . All is quiet now ; and she of whom we write has thrown herself upon the first vacant bed , spreading first a clean napkin on the extremely serviceable pillow . Sleep comes ; but what is this that murders sleep ? A diminutive male official going to each berth , and arousing its fair occupant with “ Do ñ a Teresita , ” or whatever the name may be , “ favor me with the amount of your passage-money . ” No comment is necessary ; here , no tickets ,— here , no stewardess to mediate between the unseen captain and the unprotected female ! The sanctuary of the sex invaded at midnight , without apology and without rebuke ! Think of that , those passengers who have not paid their fare , and , when invited to call at the captain 's office and settle , do so , and be thankful ! The male passengers underwent a similar visitation . It is the Cuban idea of a compendious and economic arrangement . And here ends our account of Matanzas , our journey thither , stay , and return . Peace rest upon the fair city ! May the earthquake and hurricane spare it ! May the hateful Spanish government sit lightly on its strong shoulders ! May the filibusters attack it with kisses , and conquer it with loving-kindness ! So might it be with the whole island-vale ! THE FIRST AND THE LAST . It was the last December of the eighteenth century . All night a fierce northeast snow-storm had been hissing and drifting through the frozen air , pelting angrily at the shuttered and curtained windows of the rich , and shrieking with scornful laughter as it forced its way through the ill-fitting casements and loose doors of the poor , clutching at them with icy fingers as they cowered over their poor fires , and spreading over the garret-beds in which they sought to hide from him a premature shroud of cold white snow . But with morning the storm ceased , and a little before noon the sun , peering from behind his clouds , seemed to wink with astonishment at seeing how much had been done in his absence . Not only the sun , but Mr. Phineas Coffin , guardian of the “ town 's poor , ” in the town of Newport , was astir , and , standing at the door of the “ poor - ‘ us , ” bent a contemplative eye upon the progress made by two stout youths who were clearing the snow from the sidewalks and paths upon his premises . Mr. Coffin perceived that a trial of skill and speed was going on between one of his own pioneers and a lad similarly engaged on behalf of the next estate . About half-way between the rapidly approaching competitors stood a rough-hewn block of stone , marking the boundaries of the two estates . To first reach this , the winning-post , was evidently the emulous desire of each . As they approached near and nearer , the snow flew from their shovels with a force and velocity which would certainly have reminded Mr. Coffin of a steam snow-plough , had he ever seen or heard , of such a thing , which he most assuredly never had . Each boy performed prodigies of skill and valor . The “ poor - ‘ us ” lad evidently gained , and his patron did not conceal a wide smile of satisfaction ; the rival looked up , saw it , was stung with generous rage , threw himself with fury upon his shovel , and in three enormous plunges laid bare his own side of the post , before “ poor - ‘ us ” had come within a foot of it . Then , clapping his numb fingers upon his thighs , the successful champion uttered a melodious crow , which so disgusted the spectator that he was about to retire within doors , when his eyes fell upon a thinly clad , timid-looking woman who was advancing along the newly opened path , casting deprecating glances at the two boys , who from peaceful rivalry were now proceeding to open warfare , carried on with the ammunition so plentifully spread before them . Nor was the alarm of the poor woman groundless ; for , as she advanced into the battle-field , she found herself saluted upon the breast with an immense snow-ball , which , being of loose construction , adhered to the red broadcloth cloak of the pedestrian , forming a conspicuous and remarkable ornament to that garment . “ Come , stop that , you young limbs , or I 'll ——, ” shouted the chivalric Phineas , hastily gathering , as he spoke , material for a formidable missile , which , being completed before the sentence , was used by him as a ready means of rounding his period , being at once more forcible and easier to come at than the words which most men would have used . Besides , Nathaniel , the poorhouse lad , turning round at sound of his master 's voice , presented so fair a mark , with his gaping mouth , that , half involuntarily , the snow-ball left Mr. Coffin 's hand , and the next instant formed the contents of Nathaniel 's open mouth , leaving , however , a liberal surplusage to ornament his cheeks , chin , and nose . The recipient of this bulletin choked , spluttered , and pawed at his face after the manner of a cat who has tried to eat a wasp . His rival did not seek to conceal the expression of his triumph and derision , the consequence of which was , that , as soon as “ poor - ‘ us ” could see , he fell upon his antagonist , and both immediately disappeared from view in the bosom of an enormous drift . “ Come right along , Mum , ” called Mr. Coffin to the horror-stricken woman , who stood contemplating the spot where a convulsive floundering and heaving beneath the snow showed that the frozen element had not yet extinguished the fire of passion in the breasts of the buried heroes ,— “ come right along , and do n't be scaart of them young uns . They 're dreffal rude , I know ; but then boys will be boys . ” The woman returned no answer to this time-honored defence of youthful enormities , but , hurrying on , reached the door , saying ,— “ How 's your health this morning , Mr. Coffin ? ” “ Waal , Ma'am , I 'm pooty middlln ’ well , thank ye , ” replied Phineas , slowly , and with an evident effort at recollection ; then suddenly added , with more vivacity ,— “ Why , it 's Widder Janes ,— a'n ' t it ? Declare to goodness I did n't know ye , with yer hood over yer face . Walk in , Miss Janes , and see my woman ,— wo n't ye ? ” “ Waal , I dunno as I can stop , ” replied the widow , beginning , nevertheless , to shake the snow from her scanty skirts , and to stamp her numb feet , which were protected from the biting cold by a pair of old yarn socks , drawn over the shoes . “ I was wantin ’ to see ye , a minit , ” continued she ; “ but Miss Coffin allers keeps cleaned up so slick , I do n't hardly darst to come in . ” “ Oh , waal , ” replied Phineas , with a chuckle of satisfaction at the compliment to his wife . “ Ye look nice enough for anybody 's folks . Come right in , this way . ” “ I dunno how ‘ tis , ” continued the visitor , as she followed her host through the long entry , “ that Miss Coffin can allers be so forehanded with her work , an ’ do sich a master sight o n't , too . She do n't never seem to be in the suds , Monday nor no time . ” Mr. Coffin had reached the door of the “ keeping-room ” as the widow concluded her last remark ; but pausing , with his thumb upon the latch , he turned , and , looking over his shoulder , whispered , with an emphatic nod ,— “ Fact is , Miss Janes , there a'n ' t sich a great many women jest like Miss Coffin . ” “ There a'n ' t no two ways about that , ” murmured Miss Janes , assentingly , as the door was thrown open . “ Walk right in . Here , Marthy , the widder Janes has called to see you this morning . ” A quiet , middle-aged woman turned round from the table , where she was fitting patches to a pair of pauper trousers . Her face was sweet , her voice low , and , though she was of middle age , every one agreed that “ Miss Coffin was a real pooty woman , an ’ a harnsome woman too . ” “ How does thee do , Keziah Janes ? I am glad to see thee . Take a seat by the fire , and warm thee after thy cold walk . ” “ I can n't stop a minit ; but it 's as cheap settin ’ as stannin ’ , I do suppose , ” replied the widow , with a nervous little laugh , as she seated herself in the proffered chair upon the clean red hearth , and commenced her business by saying ,— “ I was wantin ’ to speak with you , Mr. Coffin , about poor Mr. Widdrinton . ” “ Widdrinton ,— who 's he ? ” inquired Phineas . “ Waal , ” commenced the widow , settling herself in her chair , and assuming the air of one who has a story to narrate . “ You know I have my thirds in the house my poor husband left . It wa'n ' t sold , as it had ought to ben ,— for Samooel ( that 's his brother ) never 's ben easy that I should have the rooms I have ; but they 're what was set off for me , an ’ so he can n't help himself ; on'y he 's allers a-thornin . ’ when he gits a chance . “ But that a'n ' t nyther here nor there . What I was a-comin ’ to was this . Ruther better ‘ n a year ago , a man come to me and wanted to know ef I used all my rooms . I told him I had n't no use for the garrit , ‘ cept to dry my yarbs in ( for I think yarbs are drefful good in case o ’ sickness , Miss Coffin ,— do n't you ?) An ’ then he said he wanted a place to sleep in , an ’ his breakfast an ’ supper , an ’ wanted to know if I would take him so . “ Waal , I thought about it a spell , an ’ I concluded I was too old to mind the speech o ’ people , and I had n't no other objection , so I said he might come ,— an ’ he did , that very day . “ Waal , at fust he had some kind o ’ work to do writin ’ , an ’ he seemed to git along very comf'table ,— at least , fur 's I know ,— for I was out tailorin ’ all day mostly , same as I be now ; but last fall the writin ’ seemed to gin out all to oncet , an ’ he begun to kerry off his furnitoor an ’ books to sell , an ’ finally he paid up all he was owin ’ of me , an ’ told me he did n't want no more meals , but would find himself . “ Waal , I told him , that , seein ’ things wuz as they wuz with him , I should n't take no rent for the garrit , an ’ I could dry my yarbs there jest as well as ef he war n't there ; an ’ he looked kind o ’ red , and held his head up a minit , an ’ then he thanked me , an ’ said , ‘ God bless you ! ’ an ’ said he 'd pay me , ef he got any more work . “ Waal , he did n't git no more ; an ’ after the furnitoor an ’ the books , his cloze begun to go . “ Then I begun to be afeard he did n't have nothin ’ to eat , an ’ oncet in a while I 'd kerry him up a mess o ’ vittles ; but it allers seemed drefful hard for him to take ‘ em , an ’ fin'ly he told me not to do so no more , an ’ said suthin ’ to himself about devourin ’ widders . So I did n't darst to go up agin , he looked so kind o ’ furce an ’ sharp , till , last night , I reck'n ' d the snow would sift in through the old ruff , an ’ I went up to offer him a comf'table for his bed . I knocked ; but he did n't make no answer , so I pushed the door open an ’ went in . It was a good while sence I 'd seen the inside o ’ the room ,— for when he heerd me comin ’ up , he 'd open the door a crack an ’ peek out while he spoke to me ; so when I got inside the room and looked about , I was all took aback an ’ gawped round like a fool , an ’ no wunder nyther ; for of all the good furnitoor and things he 'd brought , there wa'n ' t the fust thing to be seen , save and ‘ xcept a kind o ’ frame covered with cloth stannin ’ ag'inst the wall , an ’ an old straw-bed on the floor , with him on it , an ’ a mis'able old comf'table kivered over him . ” “ And this bitter weather , too ! Oh , Keziah , what did thee do ? ” asked Mrs. Coffin , in a tearful voice . “ Why , I went up to the bedside , ( ef you may call it so ,) an ’ said , sez I , ‘ Why , Lor ’ sakes , Mr. Widdrinton , ’ —— an ’ then I hild up , for I ketchcd a sight of his face , an ’ I thought he wuz gone for sartin . He wuz as cold an ’ as white as that ‘ ere snow , an ’ it war n't till I 'd felt of his heart an ’ foun ’ that it beat a little that I thought of sich a thing as his comin ’ to . But as soon as I found he 'd got a breath o ’ life in him , I did n't waste much time till I 'd got him wropped up in a hot blanket with a jug o ’ water to his feet , an ’ some hot tea inside on him . Then he come to a little , an ’ said he had n't eat nor drank for two days an ’ nights . ” “ Oh , Keziah ! ” sobbed Mrs. Coffin ; while her husband , plunging his hands deep into his breeches-pockets , and elevating his eyebrows till they were lost in his shaggy hair , exclaimed ,— “ Good Je-hosaphat ! ” which was the nearest approach to an oath in which he ever indulged . “ An ’ so , ” pursued the widow , after enjoying for a moment the consternation of her audience ,— “ an ’ so I thought I had better come an ’ see ef he could n't be took in here ; not that I would n't do for him , an ’ be glad to , fur as I could , but he a'n ' t in a state to be left alone , an ’ you know my trade takes me away consid'able from home ,— an ’ which , if I do n't foller it , why , when I git a little older , I shall have to come here myself , an ’ be a burden on your hands an ’ the town 's . ” “ We would take good care of thee , if thee did come , Keziah , ” said Mrs. Coffin , in whom the habitual equanimity of the “ Friend ” had conquered the emotion of the woman . “ Though I do not deny that it is pleasanter and better for thee to support thyself , as thee always has done . ” “ I do n't doubt you would be good to me , Miss Coffin , an ’ thank ye , Ma'am , kindly for a-sayin ’ of it ; but you know innerpendance is sweet to all on us . ” “ Surely , surely , Keziah ; and now , Phineas , I suppose thee will see at once about this poor man , wo n't thee ? ” “ Yes , Marthy , yes . I 'll go right off and see one of the selectmen ; and I reckon , by the time you git a bed ready for him , we shall be along . ” Phineas accordingly bustled out of the room ; and Mrs. Janes , after lingering a few moments , took her leave and returned to her charge , inwardly congratulating herself on having so new and interesting a piece of intelligence with which to lighten her next day 's “ tailoring . ” Mrs. Coffin , left alone , stood for a moment considering , and then , opening a door , called gently ,— “ Faith ! ” “ Yes , mother , ” replied a voice whose soft tones seemed the echo of her own . A moment after , a slender , dark-eyed girl , about twenty years of age , entered the room , and said cheerfully ,— “ What is it , mother ? ” “ I have somewhat to tell thee , Faith . ” And the Quakeress repeated , in calm , unemphatic language , the story narrated by Mrs. Janes . “ The poor man will soon be here , Faith , ” continued she , “ and I wanted to ask what thee thinks should be done with him . Thee knows there is no room that can have a fire in it , except the one where Polly and Susan sleep , and they are both too sick to be moved into the cold ” — “ He shall have my room , mother , ” said Faith , quietly . “ Thy room , child ? ” “ Yes , mother ; and I will sleep here on the couch . I should like it very much indeed ; for you know I never have been able to be quite the orderly and regular girl you have tried to make me . ” “ Thee is a good girl , ” said the mother , quietly . “ Not half so good a girl as I ought to be , with so good a mother , ” replied Faith , throwing her arms about her mother 's neck and kissing her fondly . The elder woman returned the caress with an involuntary warmth , which , pure and natural though it might be , was yet at variance with the strict rule of her sect , which had taught her to avoid everything like compliment or caress , as savoring of the manners of the “ world 's people . ” She therefore , after one kiss , gently repelled the girl , saying ,— “ Nay , Faith , but it sufficeth . Go , then , if thee will , and make ready thy chamber for this sick man , while I prepare him some broth . ” An hour later , a pung or box-sleigh drew up at the poor-house door , from which was lifted a long , gaunt figure , carefully enveloped in blankets and cloaks . As he was taken from the sleigh , he feebly murmured a few words , to which Phineas Coffin replied kindly ,— “ Do n't be scart ,— it 's all safe , and Nathaniel will fetch it right in after us . ” “ What ! this ‘ ere ? ” queried the youth called Nathaniel , while he lifted from the sleigh , somewhat contemptuously , a long flat something , carefully enveloped in a cotton case . “ Yes . Fetch it along this way , ” replied Phineas ; and Nathaniel followed the chair , in which the sick man was carried , into the pretty little maiden chamber which Faith had so quietly relinquished to one who she thought needed it more than herself . Mother and daughter stood ready to receive their new charge , and see him comfortable in the warm , soft bed which they had prepared for him . “ Thee will soon get rested now , friend , and go to sleep ,— wo n't thee ? ” said Mrs. Coffin , in her gentle voice , as she turned down the sheet a little more evenly . “ Where is it ? ” panted the exhausted sufferer , trying to look beyond his kind nurse into the room . “ What does thee mean , friend ? ” “ It is this thing , mother , ” said Faith , bringing it forward , and leaning it against the wall at the foot of the bed . “ He brought it with him , ” continued she , in a low voice ; “ and father says , he did n't seem to care half so much about his own comfort as to have that safe . ” “ It is my — property ,— all I have — left . I wo n't be — parted from it . You — sha'n ' t take it — away , ” gasped the sick man , in an excited tone . “ Thee shall not be parted from it , friend , ” said Mrs. Coffin , soothingly . “ Surely we would not deprive thee of what is thine own , and what thee seems to value so much . Now if thee will try to go to sleep , I will stay with thee the while , and when thee wakes give thee some broth to strengthen thee . ” “ Let — let her stay .— Go away ,— the rest of you , ” whispered the feeble voice , while the weary eyes rested upon Faith 's grave , sweet face . “ Thee means my daughter ? Faith , does thee wish to stay ? or had thee rather I should ? ” “ I will stay , mother , if he wishes it . ” “ Very well , daughter . When thee is weary , come down , and I , or one of the women , will take thy place . ” Mrs. Coffin left the room , and Faith , her sewing in her hand , was about seating herself by the fire , when the voice of the stranger summoned her to the bedside . Turning , she found his hollow and gleaming eyes fixed sternly upon her , while a long , lean finger was pointed alternately at her and the frame leaning against the wall . “ Girl ! ” “ Can I do something for you ? ” asked Faith , kindly . “ Do n't you look at it — or let any one — else , while I 'm — asleep . ” “ I certainly will not . ” “ Promise ! ” “ I do promise . ” “ Swear ! ” “ Nay , friend , that would be wrong , ” replied the girl , unconsciously adopting the phraseology of the Quakers , while expressing a sentiment learned from them ; for though Faith had been brought up outwardly in the creed of her father , she had , without being aware of it , adopted many of the tenets to which her mother held . “ I will promise you very solemnly , however , ” continued she , “ that I will neither look at yonder thing nor allow any one else to do so ; and you will be wrong to doubt my word . ” “ I do n't .— What is your name ? ” “ Faith . ” “ A good omen . Mine is — Ichabod . ” “ Ichabod Widdrinton ? ” “ Ichabod . Call me so ,— all of you . ” “ Very well , if it is your name , we will . Now you must go to sleep . ” “ Sit there ,— where I can see you . ” Faith complied with this request , although uncertain whether it was not prompted by a distrust of her promise . The stranger soon slept , and his young nurse then made a more attentive survey of his features than she had yet done . He seemed not over forty years of age , and would , in health , have been considered a handsome man ,— although the fine silky hair , thin beard , sensitive nostril , and delicate mouth could never have expressed much of strength or resolution . The traces of disease and starvation were painfully apparent ; but it seemed to the thoughtful Faith that behind these she could perceive in the sorrowful , downward curve of the lips , in the lines of the hollow , throbbing temples , in the gloomy light of the dark eyes , symptoms of a long corroding care , which , though secretly , had done its work of devastation more surely and more ruthlessly than the more apparent foes . “ How he must have suffered ! ” murmured she . It seemed as if the tone of gentle pity had penetrated the light slumber , and reached the heart of the sick man ,— for , opening his eyes , he smiled upon the girl , a wan , sad smile , which was at once an assent and a benison . From that moment , until the welcome end of that sad life , Ichabod would patiently endure no tendance but Faith 's ; and she , with the calm and silent self-abnegation of her order , ( for Florence Nightingale is but a type , and there are those all about us who lack but her opportunities ,) devoted herself to him . Her mother sometimes remonstrated , and begged her to yield her place in the sick-chamber to her or to one of the pauper women ; but Faith , whose grave sweetness concealed more determination than a stranger would have guessed , would simply say ,— “ Dear mother , what is a little fatigue to one as well as I am , compared with the pleasure of making this poor stranger 's death-bed happy and quiet ?— which it certainly would not be , if he was crossed in his fancy for seeing me about him . ” And the conscientious mind of the mother was forced to yield assent to this simple logic . A few weeks thus passed , and then the sick man became a dying man . The pauper inmates of the house were all willing and anxious to watch beside him through the long nights , but Ichabod received all their attentions very ungraciously ; nor was it till Faith told him , in her kind , decided way , that she could not stay with him at night , that he consented to allow the others to do so . At last there came the evening when the physician said to Mrs. Coffin , as he entered the room where she sat with her husband ,— “ He wo n't last till morning ,— ‘ tis impossible . ” “ Then thee had better watch beside him , Phineas . It is not fitting that Faith should do so . ” “ Certain . I 'll go right up , and send her down , ” replied Phineas , readily . But when the arrangements for the night were made known to Ichabod , he caught hold of Faith 's dress , as she stood at his bedside bidding him good-night , and gasped out ,— “ No , no !— you !— I must have — you !— I shall die — die to-night !— And — and I want to tell — to tell you something .— Stay ,— stay , Faith !— it 's the last — last time , and I — I shall never trouble any one — any more . ” “ Let me stay , mother ; father , do ! ” pleaded Faith , looking from one to the other . “ I should be very unhappy , always , if I was obliged to deny him this last request . I shall not be afraid , mother ; and Betty can sleep in the chair by the fire , if you wish it , so as to be at hand , if “ —— “ Well , child , if thee feels a call to do so , and it will make thee unhappy to be denied , I will hold my peace . But thee must certainly have Betty here , and promise to send her to call me , if Ichabod should be worse ,— wo n't thee ? ” Faith gave the required promise , and in a short time the chamber was prepared for night . The old woman ( whose skill in the last awful rites which man pays to man caused her always to be selected for such occasions ) slept soundly beside the glowing fire , the dying man dozed uneasily , and Faith , shading the light from his eyes , opened the large-print Bible , which her mother , careful both for the well-being of her daughter 's immortal soul and temporal eyesight , had recommended for her night 's perusal . The hours passed slowly on , unmarked by change , until Faith had counted three solemn strokes from the old clock in the entry , when the sick man suddenly awoke . As Faith came to his bedside , to offer him the draught for which he always asked on awakening , she was struck with a change in his face . The eyes were at once calmer and brighter , the look of uneasy pain had disappeared , and the thin lips wore almost a smile . “ Dear Faith , ” said he , in a gentle voice , which yet was stronger and more unbroken than any she had heard from him before , “ how good you have been to me ! I am dying ; but do not call any one yet . I want to talk to you a little , first . Put another pillow under my head , and raise me ,— so . Now light your other candle , stir the fire to a brighter blaze , and then uncover — it . ” Faith , pale and quiet , did as she was bid , stirred the fire , till its ruddy glow brightened every nook of the little white-washed chamber , and made the old crone beside it wince and mutter in her sleep . Having shielded her from its fierce light , she then , with trembling fingers , opened a little penknife which lay upon the table , and cut the twine with which the cover was sewed at the back . The last stitch severed , the cloth fell with a solemn rustle at her feet , and disclosed — a picture . Faith examined it with much attention and some curiosity . It was the full-length figure of a man , dressed in rich robes of office , his powdered hair put back from his forehead , his left hand resting on the pommel of his sword , and his right clasping a roll of parchment . The expression of his face was grave , majestic , and noble ; and yet between those handsome features and the attenuated face of the dying pauper Faith soon perceived one of those resemblances , strong , yet indefinable , which are so apparent to some persons , so undiscoverable by others . “ A noble gentleman , Faith ,— was he not ? ” said Ichabod , at length . “ And they say his picture does not do him justice . He was an English gentleman of property and station ,— the heir of a good fortune and honorable name ; but he left all to come here and help found this new country ,— this glorious land of freedom and conscience ,— where every man has perfect liberty — to starve in his own fashion . “ He came and was a great man among them . He built the finest house in the village of Boston , and then came hither , where they made him governor and named a bay after him . “ He went home for a visit to England , and there he had this picture painted by the court-painter of those days , and brought it back with him as a present to his wife . “ He was father of many children , mostly girls : and finally died in a very dignified and respectable manner , full of years and honors ,— as they say in storybooks . “ His handsome property , being divided so often , made but rather small portions for the children , and several of the daughters died unmarried . “ Then the family began to decay , and each succeeding head of the family found it a harder struggle to keep up the old hospitalities and the traditional style of living . They died out , too . The lateral branches of the family-tree never flourished , and one after another came to an end , till about forty years ago the remnant of the family-blood and the family-name was centred in two cousins , a young man and a girl . They met at the funeral of the girl 's mother , and found in a short conversation that they were the sole representatives of the old name , alive . “ They married , gloomily helping on the fate which awaited them , by uniting their two threads of life in one , that thus she might sever it more easily . I was their only child , and they named me Ichabod ,— ‘ the glory has departed . ’ “ It is a sad proof of how deeply the bitterness of life had entered their souls , that , even in the supreme moment when they clasped their first-born in their arms , the name which rose from heart to lip , and which they bestowed upon him , was in itself a cry of anguish and despair . “ The husband soon died . Man breaks , woman bends , beneath the crushing weight of such a life . My mother lived , a dark and silent woman , till five years ago . Then she died , too , and I inherited my ancestor 's portrait and the curse of the Withringtons . “ I tried to work , to earn my bread , as men all about me were doing . But no ,— the fate was upon me , the curse pursued me . Everything failed which I attempted . I sunk lower and lower , until the name and the picture , which had been my pride , became a shame and a reproach to me . I abandoned the one and concealed the other , resolved to reveal neither until the moment arrived when death should wipe out the squalor of life , conquer fate , and expiate the curse . “ Quick , Faith , quick ! The hour has come . Take the knife you just held ,— cut the canvas from its frame ,— cut it in fragments ,— lay it on the blazing fire . We will perish together ,— the First and — the Last . ” “ Nay , Ichabod , give it to me , ” said Faith , shrinking from the proposed holocaust “ I will always keep it , and value it . ” “ Would you see me fall dead at your feet , while attempting to do for myself what you refuse to do for me ? ” asked the dying man , with feverish ardor , and half rising , as if to leave his bed . “ No , no ,— I will do it , since it must be so , ” exclaimed Faith , eagerly . “ Lie down again and watch me . ” Ichabod sunk back upon his pillows , and gazed with eyes of fitful light upon the girl , while she , opening the keen knife , cut slowly and laboriously round the margin of the stout canvas , which shrieked beneath the blade , as if the spirit of the effigy which it bore were resisting the fearful doom which threatened it . At last the canvas was entirely released , and Faith silently held it up before the eyes of the dying man , upon whose face had come a dull , leaden blankness , and whose eyes were painful to watch as they struggled to pierce the film which was gathering over them . “ Burn , ” he hoarsely murmured . With a sigh , Faith cut the picture into strips , and laid them gently , reverently , upon the coals heaped in the large fireplace . The greedy flames leaped up to grasp their prey , and Faith turned sick and faint as she watched them fasten upon that noble face , which seemed to contract and shrivel in its anguish as they seized upon it . She gazed a moment , painfully fascinated , then turned toward the bed ,— but as her eyes fell upon Ichabod 's face , she started back , and , rousing the old woman from her slumber , sent to summon her mother . Mrs. Coffin came immediately ,— but when she entered the little chamber , the last fragment of the canvas was shrivelling in the flames , the last sigh of the dying man was parting from his white lips . They had perished together ,— the First — and the Last . THE PROFESSOR AT THE BREAKFAST-TABLE . WHAT HE SAID , WHAT HE HEARD , AND WHAT HE SAW . You will know , perhaps , in the course of half an hour 's reading , what has been haunting my hours of sleep and waking for months . I cannot tell , of course , whether you are a nervous person or not . If , however , you are such a person ,— if it is late at night ,— if all the rest of the household have gone off to bed ,— if the wind is shaking your windows as if a human hand were rattling the sashes ,— if your candle or lamp is low and will soon burn out ,— let me advise you to read the “ Critical Notices ” or some other paper contained in this number , if you have not already devoured them all , and leave this to be read by daylight , with cheerful voices round , and people near by who would hear you , if you slid from your chair and came down in a lump on the floor . I do not say that your heart will beat as mine did , I am willing to confess , when I entered the dim chamber . Did I not tell you that I was sensitive and imaginative , and that I had lain awake with thinking what were the strange movements and sounds which I heard late at night in my little neighbor 's apartment ? It had come to that pass that I was truly unable to separate what I had really heard from what I had dreamed in these nightmares to which I have been subject , as before mentioned . So , when I walked into the room , and Bridget , turning back , closed the door and left me alone with its tenant , I do believe you could have grated a nutmeg on my skin , such a “ goose-flesh ” shiver ran over it . It was not fear , but what I call nervousness ,— unreasoning , but irresistible ; as when , for instance , one looking at the sun going down says , “ I will count fifty before it disappears ” ; and as he goes on and it becomes doubtful whether he will reach the number , he gets strangely flurried , and his imagination pictures life and death and heaven and hell as the issues depending on the completion or non-completion of the fifty he is counting . Extreme curiosity will excite some people as much as fear , or what resembles fear , acts on some other less impressible natures . I may find myself in the midst of strange facts in this little conjurer 's room . Or , again , there may be nothing in this poor invalid 's chamber but some old furniture , such as they say came over in the Mayflower . All this is just what I mean to find out while I am looking at the Little Gentleman , who has suddenly become my patient . The simplest things turn out to be unfathomable mysteries ; the most mysterious appearances prove to be the most commonplace objects in disguise . I wonder whether the boys that live in Roxbury and Dorchester are ever moved to tears or filled with silent awe as they look upon the rocks and fragments of “ puddingstone ” abounding in those localities . I have my suspicions that those boys “ heave a stone ” or “ fire a brick-bat , ” composed of the conglomerate just mentioned , without any more tearful or philosophical contemplations than boys of less favored regions expend on the same performance . Yet a lump of puddingstone is a thing to look at , to think about , to study over , to dream upon , to go crazy with , to beat one 's brains out against . Look at that pebble in it . From what cliff was it broken ? On what beach rolled by the waves of what ocean ? How and when imbedded in soft ooze , which itself became stone , and by-and-by was lifted into bald summits and steep cliffs , such as you may see on Meetinghouse-Hill any day ,— yes , and mark the scratches on their faces left when , the boulder-carrying glaciers planed the surface of the continent with such rough tools that the storms have not worn the marks out of it with all the polishing of ever so many thousand years ? Or as you pass a roadside ditch or pool in spring-time , take from it any bit of stick or straw which has lain undisturbed for a time . Some little worm-shaped masses of clear jelly containing specks are fastened to the stick : eggs of a small snail-like shell-fish . One of these specks magnified proves to be a crystalline sphere with an opaque mass in its centre . And while you are looking , the opaque mass begins to stir , and by-and-by slowly to turn upon its axis like a forming planet ,— life beginning in the microcosm , as in the great worlds of the firmament , with the revolution that turns the surface in ceaseless round to the source of life and light . A pebble and the spawn of a mollusk ! Before you have solved their mysteries , this earth where you first saw them may be a vitrified slag , or a vapor diffused through the planetary spaces . Mysteries are common enough , at any rate , whatever the boys in Roxbury and Dorchester think of “ brickbats ” and the spawn of creatures that live in roadside puddles . But then a great many seeming mysteries are relatively perfectly plain , when we can get at them so as to turn them over . How many ghosts that “ thick men 's blood with cold ” prove to be shirts hung out to dry ! How many mermaids have been made out of seals ! How many times have horse-mackerels been taken for the sea-serpent ! —— Let me take the whole matter coolly , while I see what is the matter with the patient . That is what I say to myself , as I draw a chair to the bedside .— The bed is an old-fashioned , dark mahogany four-poster . It was never that which made the noise of something moving . It is too heavy to be pushed about the room .— The Little Gentleman was sitting , bolstered up by pillows , with his hands clasped and their united palms resting on the back of the head ,— one of the three or four positions specially affected by persons whose breathing is difficult from disease of the heart or other causes . Sit down , Sir ,— he said ,— sit down ! I have come to the hill Difficulty , Sir , and am fighting my way up . His speech was laborious and interrupted . Do n't talk ,— I said ,— except to answer my questions .— And I proceeded to “ prospect ” for the marks of some local mischief , which you know is at the bottom of all these attacks , though we do not always find it . I suppose I go to work pretty much like other professional folks of my temperament . Thus :— Wrist , if you please .— I was on his right side , but he presented his left wrist , crossing it over the other .— I begin to count , holding watch in left hand . One , two , three , four ,—— What a handsome hand !— wonder if that splendid stone is a carbuncle .— One , two , three , four , five , six , seven ,—— Ca n't see much , it is so dark , except one white object .— One , two , three , four ,—— Hang it ! eighty or ninety in the minute , I guess .— Tongue , if you please .— Tongue is put out . Forget to look at it , or , rather , to take any particular notice of it ;— but what is that white object , with the long arm stretching up as if pointing to the sky , just as Vesalius and Spigelius and those old fellows used to put their skeletons ? I do n't think anything of such objects , you know ; but what should he have it in his chamber for ?— As I had found his pulse irregular and intermittent , I took out a stethoscope , which is a pocket-spyglass for looking into men 's chests with your ears , and laid it over the place where the heart beats . I missed the usual beat of the organ .— How is this ?— I said ,— where is your heart gone to ?— He took the stethoscope and shifted it across to the right side ; there was a displacement of the organ .— I am ill-packed ,— he said ;— there was no room for my heart in its place as it is with other men .— God help him ! It is hard to draw the line between scientific curiosity and the desire for the patient 's sake to learn all the details of his condition . I must look at this patient 's chest , and thump it and listen to it . For this is a case of ectopia cordis , my boy ,— displacement of the heart ; and it is n't every day you get a chance to overhaul such an interesting malformation . And so I managed to do my duty and satisfy my curiosity at the same time . The torso was slight and deformed ; the right arm attenuated ,— the left full , round , and of perfect symmetry . It had run away with the life of the other limbs ,— a common trick enough of Nature 's , as I told you before . If you see a man with legs withered from childhood , keep out of the way of his arms , if you have a quarrel with him . He has the strength of four limbs in two ; and if he strikes you , it is an arm-blow plus a kick administered from the shoulder instead of the haunch , where it should have started from . Still examining him as a patient , I kept my eyes about me to search all parts of the chamber , and went on with the double process , as before .— Heart hits as hard as a fist ,— bellows-sound over mitral valves ( professional terms you need not attend to ) .— What the deuce is that long case for ? Got his witch grandmother mummied in it ? And three big mahogany presses ,— hey ?— A diabolical suspicion came over me which I had had once before ,— that he might be one of our modern alchemists ,— you understand ,— make gold , you know , or what looks like it , sometimes with the head of a king or queen or of Liberty to embellish one side of the piece .— Do n't I remember hearing him shut a door and lock it once ? What do you think was kept under that lock ? Let 's have another look at his hand , to see if there are any calluses . One can tell a man 's business , if it is a handicraft , very often by just taking a look at his open hand .— Ah ! Four calluses at the end of the fingers of the right hand . None on those of the left . Ah , ha ! What do those mean ? All this seems longer in the telling , of course , than it was in fact . While I was making these observations of the objects around me , I was also forming my opinion as to the kind of case with which I had to deal . There are three wicks , you know , to the lamp of a man 's life : brain , blood , and breath . Press the brain a little , its light goes out , followed by both the others . Stop the heart a minute , and out go all three of the wicks . Choke the air out of the lungs , and presently the fluid ceases to supply the other centres of flame , and all is soon stagnation , cold , and darkness . The “ tripod of life ” a French physiologist called these three organs . It is all clear enough which leg of the tripod is going to break down here . I could tell you exactly what the difficulty is ;— which would be as intelligible and amusing as a watchmaker 's description of a diseased timekeeper to a ploughman . It is enough to say , that I found just what I expected to , and that I think this attack is only the prelude of more serious consequences , — which expression means you very well know what . And now the secrets of this life hanging on a thread must surely come out . If I have made a mystery where there was none , my suspicions will be shamed , as they have often been before . If there is anything strange , my visits will clear it up . I sat an hour or two by the side of the Little Gentleman 's bed , after giving him some henbane to quiet his brain , and some foxglove , which an imaginative French professor has called the “ Opium of the Heart . ” Under their influence he gradually fell into an uneasy , half-waking slumber , the body fighting hard for every breath , and the mind wandering off in strange fancies and old recollections , which escaped from his lips in broken sentences . —— The last of ‘ em ,— he said ,— the last of ‘ em all ,— thank God ! And the grave he lies in will look just as well as if he had been straight . Dig it deep , old Martin , dig it deep ,— and let it be as long as other folks ’ graves . And mind you get the sods flat , old man ,— flat as ever a straight-backed young fellow was laid under . And then , with a good tall slab at the head , and a footstone six foot away from it , it 'll look just as if there was a man underneath . A man ! Who said he was a man ? No more men of that pattern to bear his name !— Used to be a good-looking set enough .— Where 's all the manhood and womanhood gone to since his great-grand-father was the strongest man that sailed out of the town of Boston , and poor Leah there the handsomest woman in Essex , if she was a witch ? —— Give me some light ,— he said ,— more light ,— I want to see the picture . He had started either from a dream or a wandering reverie . I was not unwilling to have more light in the apartment , and presently had lighted an astral lamp that stood on a table .— He pointed to a portrait hanging against the wall .— Look at her ,— he said ,— look , at her ! Was n't that a pretty neck to slip a hangman 's noose over ? The portrait was of a young woman , something more than twenty years old , perhaps . There were few pictures of any merit painted in New England before the time of Smibert , and I am at a loss to know what artist — could have taken this half-length , which was evidently from life . It was somewhat stiff and flat , but the grace of the figure and the sweetness of the expression reminded me of the angels of the early Florentine painters . She must have been of some consideration , for she was dressed in paduasoy and lace with hanging sleeves , and the old carved frame showed how the picture had been prized by its former owners . A proud eye she had , with all her sweetness .— I think it was that which hanged her , as his strong arm hanged Minister George Burroughs ;— but it may have been a little mole on one cheek , which the artist had just hinted as a beauty rather than a deformity . You know , I suppose , that nursling imps addict themselves , after the fashion of young opossums , to these little excrescences . “ Witch-marks ” were good evidence that a young woman was one of the Devil 's wet-nurses ;— I should like to have seen you make fun of them in those days !— Then she had a brooch in her bodice , that might have been taken for some devilish amulet or other ; and she wore a ring upon one of her fingers , with a red stone in it , that flamed as if the painter had dipped his pencil in fire ;— who knows but that it was given her by a midnight suitor fresh from that fierce element , and licensed for a season to leave his couch of flame to tempt the unsanctified hearts of earthly maidens and brand their cheeks with the print of his scorching kisses ? She and I ,— he said , as he looked steadfastly at the canvas ,— she and I are the last of ‘ em .— She will stay , and I shall go . They never painted me ,— except when the boys used to make pictures of me with chalk on the board-fences . They said the doctors would want my skeleton when I was dead .— You are my friend , if you are a doctor ,— a'n ' t you ? I just gave him my hand . I had not the heart to speak . I want to lie still ,— he said ,— after I am put to bed upon the hill yonder . Ca n't you have a great stone laid over me , as they did over the first settlers in the old burying-ground at Dorchester , so as to keep the wolves from digging them up ? I never slept easy over the sod ;— I should like to lie quiet under it . And besides ,— he said , in a kind of scared whisper ,— I do n't want to have my bones stared at , as my body has been . I do n't doubt I was a remarkable case ; but , for God 's sake , oh , for God 's sake , do n't let ‘ em make a show of the cage I have been shut up in and looked through the bars of for so many years ! I have heard it said that the art of healing makes men hardhearted and indifferent to human suffering . I am willing to own that there is often a professional hardness in surgeons , just as there is in theologians ,— only much less in degree than in these last . It does not commonly improve the sympathies of a man to be in the habit of thrusting knives into his fellow-creatures and burning them with red-hot irons , any more than it improves them to hold the blinding-white cautery of Gehenna by its cool handle and score and crisp young souls with it until they are scorched into the belief of — Transubstantiation or the Immaculate Conception . And , to say the plain truth , I think there are a good many coarse people in both callings . A delicate nature will not commonly choose a pursuit which implies the habitual infliction of suffering , so readily as some gentler office . Yet , while I am writing this paragraph , there passes by my window , on his daily errand of duty , not seeing me , though I catch a glimpse of his manly features through the oval glass of his chaise , as he rides by , a surgeon of skill and standing , so friendly , so modest , so tender-hearted in all his ways , that , if he had not approved himself at once adroit and firm , one would have said he was of too kindly a mould to be the minister of pain , even if it were saving pain . You may be sure that some men , even among those who have chosen the task of pruning their fellow-creatures , grow more and more thoughtful and truly compassionate in the midst of their cruel experience . They become less nervous , but more sympathetic . They have a truer sensibility for others ’ pain , the more they study pain and disease in the light of science . I have said this without claiming any special growth in humanity for myself , though I do hope I grow tenderer in my feelings as I grow older . At any rate , this was not a time in which professional habits could keep down certain instincts of older date than these . This poor little man 's appeal to my humanity against the supposed rapacity of Science , which he feared would have her “ specimen , ” if his ghost should walk restlessly a thousand years , waiting for his bones to be laid in the dust , touched my heart . But I felt bound to speak cheerily .— We wo n't die yet awhile , if we can help it ,— I said ,— and I trust we can help it . But do n't be afraid ; if I live longest , I will see that your resting-place is kept sacred till the dandelions and buttercups blow over you . He seemed to have got his wits together by this time , and to have a vague consciousness that he might have been saying more than he meant for anybody 's ears .— I have been talking a little wild , Sir , eh ?— he said .— There is a great buzzing in my head with those drops of yours , and I doubt If my tongue has not been a little looser than I would have it , Sir . But I do n't much want to live . Sir ; that 's the truth of the matter ; and it does rather please me to think that fifty years from now nobody will know that the place where I lie does n't hold as stout and straight a man as the best of ‘ em that stretch out as if they were proud of the room they take . You may get me well , if you can , Sir , if you think it worth while to try ; but I tell you there has been no time for this many a year when the smell of fresh earth was not sweeter to me than all the flowers that grow out of it . There 's no anodyne like your good clean gravel , Sir . But if you can keep me about awhile , and it amuses you to try , you may show your skill upon me , if you like . There is a pleasure or two that I love the daylight for , and I think the night is not far off , at best .— I believe I shall sleep now ; you may leave me , and come , if you like , in the morning . Before I passed out , I took one more glance round the apartment . The beautiful face of the portrait looked at me , as portraits often do , with a frightful kind of intelligence in its eyes . The drapery fluttered on the still outstretched arm of the tall object near the window ;— a crack of this was open , no doubt , and some breath of wind stirred the hanging folds . In my excited state , I seemed to see something ominous in that arm pointing to the heavens . I thought of the figures in the Dance of Death at Basle , and that other on the panels of the covered Bridge at Lucerne ; and it seemed to me that the grim mask who mingles with every crowd and glides over every threshold was pointing the sick man to his far home , and would soon stretch out his bony hand and lead him or drag him on the unmeasured journey towards it . The fancy had possession of me , and I shivered again as when I first entered the chamber . The picture and the shrouded shape ; I saw only these two objects . They were enough . The house was deadly still , and the night-wind , blowing through an open window , struck me as from a field of ice , at the moment I passed into the creaking corridor . As I turned into the common passage , a white figure , holding a lamp , stood full before me . I thought at first it was one of those images made to stand in niches and hold a light in their hands . But the illusion was momentary , and my eyes speedily recovered from the shock of the bright flame and snowy drapery to see that the figure was a breathing one . It was Iris , in one of her statue-trances . She had come down , whether sleeping or waking , I knew not at first , led by an instinct that told her she was wanted ,— or , possibly , having overheard and interpreted the sound of our movements ,— or , it may be , having learned from the servant that there was trouble which might ask for a woman 's hand . I sometimes think women have a sixth sense , which tells them that others , whom they cannot see or hear , are in suffering . How surely we find them at the bedside of the dying ! How strongly does Nature plead for them , that we should draw our first breath in their arms , as we sigh away our last upon their faithful breasts ! With white , bare feet , her hair loosely knotted , dressed as the starlight knew her , and the morning when she rose from slumber , save that she had twisted a scarf round her long dress , she stood still as a stone before me , holding in one hand a lighted coil of wax-taper , and in the other a silver goblet . I held my own lamp close to her , as if she had been a figure of marble , and she did not stir . There was no breach of propriety then , to scare the Poor Relation with and breed scandal out of . She had been “ warned in a dream , ” doubtless suggested by her waking knowledge and the sounds which had reached her exalted sense . There was nothing more natural than that she should have risen and girdled her waist , and lighted her taper , and found the silver goblet with “ Ex dono pupillorum ” on it , from which she had taken her milk and possets through all her childish years , and so gone blindly out to find her place at the bedside ,— a Sister of Charity without the cap and rosary ; nay , unknowing whither her feet were leading her , and with wide , blank eyes seeing nothing but the vision that beckoned her along .— Well , I must wake her from her slumber or trance . I called her name , but she did not heed my voice . The Devil put it into my head that I would kiss one handsome young girl before I died , and now was my chance . She never would know it , and I should carry the remembrance of it with me into the grave , and a rose perhaps grow out of my dust , as out of Lord Lovel 's , in memory of that immortal moment ! Would it wake her from her trance ? and would she see me in the flush of my stolen triumph , and hate and despise me ever after ? Or should I carry off my trophy undetected , and always from that time say to myself , when I looked upon her in the glory of youth and the splendor of beauty , “ My lips have touched those roses and made their sweetness mine forever ” ? You think my cheek was flushed , perhaps , and my eyes were glittering with this midnight flash of opportunity . On the contrary , I believe I was pale , very pale , and I know that I trembled . Ah , it is the pale passions that are the fiercest ,— it is the violence of the chill that gives the measure of the fever ! The fighting-boy of our school always turned white when he went out to a pitched battle with the bully of some neighboring village ; but we knew what his bloodless cheeks meant ,— the blood was all in his stout heart ,— he was a slight boy , and there was not enough to redden his face and fill his heart both at once . Perhaps it is making a good deal of a slight matter , to tell the internal conflicts in the heart of a quiet person something more than juvenile and something less than senile , as to whether he should be guilty of an impropriety , and , if he were , whether he would get caught in his indiscretion . And yet the memory of the kiss that Margaret of Scotland gave to Alain Chartier has lasted four hundred years , and put it into the head of many an ill-favored poet , whether Victoria or Eug é nie would do as much by him , if she happened to pass him when he was asleep . And have we ever forgotten that the fresh cheek of the young John Milton tingled under the lips of some high-born Italian beauty , who , I believe , did not think to leave her card by the side of the slumbering youth , but has bequeathed the memory of her pretty deed to all coming time ? The sound of a kiss is not so loud as that of a cannon , but its echo lasts a deal longer . There is one disadvantage which the man of philosophical habits of mind suffers , as compared with the man of action . While he is taking an enlarged and rational view of the matter before him , he lets his chance slip through his fingers . Iris woke up , of her own accord , before I had made up my mind what I was going to do about it . When I remember how charmingly she looked , I do n't blame myself at all for being tempted ; but if I had been fool enough to yield to the impulse , I should certainly have been ashamed to tell of it . She did not know what to make of it , finding herself there alone , in such guise , and me staring at her . She looked down at her white robe and bare feet , and colored ,— then at the goblet she held in her hand ,— then at the taper ; and at last her thoughts seemed to clear up . I know it all ,— she said .— He is going to die , and I must go and sit by him . Nobody will care for him as I shall , and I have nobody else to care for . I assured her that nothing was needed for him that night but rest , and persuaded her that the excitement of her presence could only do harm . Let him sleep , and he would very probably awake better in the morning . There was nothing to be said , for I spoke with authority ; and the young girl glided away with noiseless step and sought her own chamber . The tremor passed away from my limbs , and the blood began to burn in my cheeks . The beautiful image which had so bewitched me faded gradually from my imagination , and I returned to the still perplexing mysteries of my little neighbor 's chamber . All was still there now . No plaintive sounds , no monotonous murmurs , no shutting of windows and doors at strange hours , as if something or somebody were coming in or going out , or there was something to be hidden in those dark mahogany presses . Is there an inner apartment that I have not seen ? The way in which the house is built might admit of it . As I thought it over , I at once imagined a Bluebeard 's chamber . Suppose , for instance , that the narrow bookshelves to the right are really only a masked door , such as we remember leading to the private study of one of our most distinguished townsmen , who loved to steal away from his stately library to that little silent cell . If this were lighted from above , a person or persons might pass their days there without attracting attention from the household , and wander where they pleased at night ,— to Copp'shYpppHeNHill burialhYpppHeNground , if they liked ,— I said to myself , laughing , and pulling the bed-clothes over my head . There is no logic in superstitious fancies any more than in dreams . A she-ghost would n't want an inner chamber to herself . A live woman , with a valuable soprano voice , would n't start off at night to sprain her ankles over the old graves of the North-End cemetery . It is all very easy for you , middle-aged reader , sitting over this page in the broad daylight , to call me by all manner of asinine and anserine unchristian names , because I had these fancies running through my head . I do n't care much for your abuse . The question is not , what it is reasonable for a man to think about , but what he actually does think about , in the dark , and when he is alone , and his whole body seems but one great nerve of hearing , and he sees the phosphorescent flashes of his own eyeballs as they turn suddenly in the direction of the last strange noise ,— what he actually does think about , as he lies and recalls all the wild stories his head is full of , his fancy hinting the most alarming conjectures to account for the simplest facts about him , his common-sense laughing them to scorn the next minute , but his mind still returning to them , under one shape or another , until he gets very nervous and foolish , and remembers how pleasant it used to be to have his mother come and tuck him up and go and sit within call , so that she could hear him at any minute , if he got very much scared and wanted her . Old babies that we are ! Daylight will clear up all that lamplight has left doubtful . I longed for the morning to come , for I was more curious than ever . So , between my fancies and anticipations , I had but a poor night of it , and came down tired to the breakfast-table . My visit was not to be made until after this morning hour ;— there was nothing urgent , so the servant was ordered to tell me . It was the first breakfast at which the high chair at the side of Iris had been unoccupied .— You might jest as well take away that chair ,— said our landlady ,— he 'll never want it again . He acts like a man that 's struck with death , ‘ n ’ I do n't believe he 'll ever come out of his chamber till he 's laid out and brought down a corpse .— These good women do put things so plainly ! There were two or three words in her short remark that always sober people , and suggest silence or brief moral reflections . —— Life is dreadful uncerting ,— said the Poor Relation ,— and pulled in her social tentacles to concentrate her thoughts on this fact of human history . —— If there was anything a fellah could do ,— said the young man John , so called ,— a fellah 'd like the chance o ’ helpin ’ a little cripple like that . He looks as if he could n't turn over any handier than a turtle that 's laid on his back ; and I guess there a'n ' t many people that know how to lift better than I do . Ask him if he do n't want any watchers . I do n't mind settin ’ up any more ‘ n ’ a cat-owl . I was up all night twice last month . My private opinion is , that there was no small amount of punch absorbed on those two occasions , which I think I heard of at the time ;— but the offer is a kind one , and it is n't fair to question how he would like sitting up without the punch and the company and the songs and smoking . He means what he says , and it would be a more considerable achievement for him to sit quietly all night by a sick man than for a good many other people . I tell you this odd thing : there are a good many persons , who , through the habit of making other folks uncomfortable , by finding fault with all their cheerful enjoyments , at last get up a kind of hostility to comfort in general , even in their own persons . The correlative to loving our neighbors as ourselves is hating ourselves as we hate our neighbors . Look at old misers ; first they starve their dependants , and then themselves . So I think it more for a lively young fellow to be ready to play nurse than for one of those useful but forlorn martyrs who have taken a spite against themselves and love to gratify it by fasting and watching . —— The time came at last for me to make my visit . I found Iris sitting by the Little Gentleman 's pillow . To my disappointment , the room was darkened . He did not like the light , and would have the shutters kept nearly closed . It was good enough for me ;— what business had I to be indulging my curiosity , when I had nothing to do but to exercise such skill as I possessed for the benefit of my patient ? There was not much to be said or done in such a case ; but I spoke as encouragingly as I could , as I think we are always bound to do . He did not seem to pay any very anxious attention , but the poor girl listened as if her own life and more than her own life were depending on the words I uttered . She followed me out of the room , when I had got through my visit . How long ?— she said . Uncertain . Anytime ; to-day ,— next week ,— next month ,— I answered .— One of those cases where the issue is not doubtful , but may be sudden or slow . The women of the house were kind , as women always are in trouble . But Iris pretended that nobody could spare the time as well as she , and kept her place , hour after hour , until the landlady insisted that she 'd be killin ’ herself ; if she begun at that rate , and haf to give up , if she did n't want to be clean beat out in less than a week . At the table we were graver than common . The high chair was set back against the wall , and a gap left between that of the young girl and her nearest neighbor 's on the right . But the nest morning , to our great surprise , that good-looking young Marylander had very quietly moved his own chair to the vacant place . I thought he was creeping down that way , but I was not prepared for a leap spanning such a tremendous parenthesis of boarders as this change of position included . There was no denying that the youth and maiden were a handsome pair , as they sat side by side . But whatever the young girl may have thought of her new neighbor , she never seemed for a moment to forget the poor little friend who had been taken from her side . There are women , and even girls , with whom it is of no use to talk . One might as well reason with a bee as to the form of his cell , or with an oriole as to the construction of his swinging nest , as try to stir these creatures from their own way of doing their own work . It was not a question with Iris , whether she was entitled by any special relation or by the fitness of things to play the part of a nurse . She was a wilful creature that must have her way in this matter . And it so proved that it called for much patience and long endurance to carry through the duties , say rather the kind offices , the painful pleasures , that she had chosen as her share in the household where accident had thrown her . She had that genius of ministration which is the special province of certain women , marked even among their helpful sisters by a soft , low voice , a quiet footfall , a light hand , a cheering smile , and a ready self-surrender to the objects of their care , which such trifles as their own food , sleep , or habits of any kind never presume to interfere with . Day after day , and too often through the long watches of the night , she kept her place by the pillow .— That girl will kill herself over me , Sir ,— said the poor Little Gentleman to me , one day ,— she will kill herself , Sir , if you do n't call in all the resources of your art to get me off as soon as may be . I shall wear her out , Sir , with sitting in this close chamber and watching when she ought to be sleeping , if you leave me to the care of Nature without dosing me . This was rather queer pleasantly , under the circumstances . But there are certain persons whose existence is so out of parallel with the larger laws in the midst of which it is moving , that life becomes to them as death and death as life .— How am I getting along ?— he said , another morning . He lifted his shrivelled hand , with the death'shYpppHeNhead ring on it , and looked at it with a sad sort of complacency . By this one movement , which I have seen repeatedly of late , I know that his thoughts have gone before to another condition , and that he is , as it were , looking back on the infirmities of the body as accidents of the past . For , when he was well , one might see him often looking at the handsome hand with the flaming jewel on one of its fingers . The single well-shaped limb was the source of that pleasure which in some form or other Nature almost always grants to her least richly endowed children . Handsome hair , eyes , complexion , feature , form , hand , foot , pleasant voice , strength , grace , agility , intelligence ,— how few there are that have not just enough of one at least of these gifts to show them that the good Mother , busy with her millions of children , has not quite forgotten them ! But now he was thinking of that other state , where , free from all mortal impediments , the memory of his sorrowful burden should be only as that of the case he has shed to the insect whose “ deep-damasked wings ” beat off the golden dust of the lily-anthers , as he flutters in the ecstasy of his new life over their full-blown summer glories . No human being can rest for any time in a state of equilibrium , where the desire to live and that to depart just balance each other . If one has a house , which he has lived and always means to live in , he pleases himself with the thought of all the conveniences it offers him , and thinks little of its wants and imperfections . But once having made up his mind to move to a better , every incommodity starts out upon him until the very ground-plan of it seems to have changed in his mind , and his thoughts and affections , each one of them packing up its little bundle of circumstances , have quitted their several chambers and nooks and migrated to the new home , long before its apartments are ready to receive their bodily tenant . It is so with the body . Most persons have died before they expire ,— died to all earthly longings , so that the last breath is only , as it were , the locking of the door of the already deserted mansion . The fact of the tranquillity with which the great majority of dying persons await this locking of those gates of life through which its airy angels have been going and coming , from the moment of the first cry , is familiar to those who have been often called upon to witness the last period of life . Almost always there is a preparation made by Nature for unearthing a soul , just as on the smaller scale there is for the removal of a milk-tooth . The roots which hold human life to earth are absorbed before it is lifted from its place . Some of the dying are weary and want rest , the idea of which is almost inseparable in the universal mind from death . Some are in pain , and want to be rid of it , even though the anodyne be dropped , as in the legend , from the sword of the Death-Angel . Some are stupid , mercifully narcotized that they may go to sleep without long tossing about . And some are strong in faith and hope , so that , as they draw near the next world , they would fain hurry toward it , as the caravan moves faster over the sands when the foremost travellers send word along the file that water is in sight Though each little party that follows in a foot-track of its own will have it that the water to which others think they are hastening is a mirage , not the less has it been true in all ages and for human beings of every creed which recognized a future , that those who have fallen worn out by their march through the Desert have dreamed at least of a River of Life , and thought they heard its murmurs as they lay dying . The change from the clinging to the present to the welcoming of the future comes very soon , for the most part , after all hope of life is extinguished , provided this be left in good degree to Nature , and not insolently and cruelly forced upon those who are attacked by illness , on the strength of that odious fore-knowledge often imparted by science , before the white fruit whose core is ashes , and which we call death , has set beneath the pallid and drooping flower of sickness . There is a singular sagacity very often shown in a patient 's estimate of his own vital force . His physician knows the state of his material frame well enough , perhaps ,— that this or that organ is more or less impaired or disintegrated ; but the patient has a sense that he can hold out so much longer ,— sometimes that he must and will live for a while , though by the logic of disease he ought to die without any delay . The Little Gentleman continued to fail , until it became plain that his remaining days were few . I told the household what to expect . There was a good deal of kind feeling expressed among the boarders , in various modes , according to their characters and style of sympathy . The landlady was urgent that he should try a certain nostrum which had saved somebody 's life in jest sech a case . The Poor Relation wanted me to carry , as from her , a copy of “ Allein 's Alarm , ” etc . I objected to the title , reminding her that it offended people of old , so that more than twice as many of the book were sold when they changed the name to “ A Sure Guide to Heaven . ” The good old gentleman whom I have mentioned before has come to the time of life when many old men cry easily , and forget their tears as children do .— He was a worthy gentleman ,— he said ,— a very worthy gentleman , but unfortunate ,— very unfortunate . Sadly deformed about the spine and the feet . Had an impression that the late Lord Byron had some malformation of this kind . Had heerd there was something the matter with the ankle-j'ints of that nobleman , but he was a man of talents . This gentleman seemed to be a man of talents . Could not always agree with his statements ,— thought he was a little over-partial to this city , and had some free opinions ; but was sorry to lose him ,— and if — there was anything — he — could ——. In the midst of these kind expressions , the gentleman with the diamond , the Koh-i-noor , as we called him , asked , in a very unpleasant sort of way , bow the old boy was likely to cut up ,— meaning what money our friend was going to leave behind . The young fellow John spoke up , to the effect that this was a diabolish snobby question , when a man was dying and not dead .— To this the Koh-i-noor replied , by asking if the other meant to insult him .— Whereto the young man John rejoined that he had no particul'r intentions one way or t'other .— The Koh-i-noor then suggested the young man 's stepping out into the yard , that he , the speaker , might “ slap his chops , ” — Let ‘ em alone ,— said young Maryland ,— it 'll soon be over , and they wo n't hurt each other much .— So they went out . The Koh-i-noor entertained the very common idea , that , when one quarrels with another , the simple thing to do is to knock the man down , and there is the end of it . Now those who have watched such encounters are aware of two things : first , that it is not so easy to knock a man down as it is to talk about it ; secondly , that , if you do happen to knock a man down , there is a very good chance that he will be angry , and get up and give you a thrashing . So the Koh-i-noor thought he would begin , as soon as they got into the yard , by knocking his man down , and with this intention swung his arm round after the fashion of rustics and those unskilled in the noble art , expecting the young fellow John to drop when his fist , having completed a quarter of a circle , should come in contact with the side of that young man 's head . Unfortunately for this theory , it happens that a blow struck out straight is as much shorter , and therefore as much quicker than the rustic 's swinging blow , as the radius is shorter than the quarter of a circle . The mathematical and mechanical corollary was , that the Koh-i-noor felt something hard bring up suddenly against his right eye , which something he could have sworn was a paving-stone , judging by his sensations ; and as this threw his person somewhat backwards , and the young man , John jerked his own head back a little , the swinging blow had nothing to stop it ; and as the Jewel staggered between the hit he got and the blow he missed , he tripped and “ went to grass , ” so far as the back-yard of our boarding-house was provided with that vegetable . It was a signal illustration of that fatal mistake , so frequent in young and ardent natures with inconspicuous calves and negative pectorals , that they can settle most little quarrels on the spot by “ knocking the man down . ” We are in the habit of handling our faces so carefully , that a heavy blow , taking effect on that portion of the surface , produces a most unpleasant surprise , which is accompanied with odd sensations , as of seeing sparks , and a kind of electrical or ozone-like odor , half-sulphurous in character , and which has given rise to a very vulgar and profane threat sometimes heard from the lips of bullies . A person not used to pugilistic gestures does not instantly recover from this surprise . The Koh-i-noor , exasperated by his failure , and still a little confused by the smart hit he had received , but furious , and confident of victory over a young fellow a good deal lighter than himself , made a desperate rush to bear down all before him and finish the contest at once . That is the way all angry greenhorns and incompetent persons attempt to settle matters . It does n't do , if the other fellow is only cool , moderately quick , and has a very little science . It did n't do this time ; for , as the assailant rushed in with his arms flying everywhere , like the vans of a windmill , he ran a prominent feature of his face against a fist which was travelling in the other direction , and immediately after struck the knuckles of the young man 's other fist a severe blow with the part of his person known as the epigastrium to one branch of science and the bread-basket to another . This second round closed the battle . The Koh-i-noor had got enough , which in such cases is more than as good as a feast . The young fellow asked him if he was satisfied , and held out his hand . But the other sulked , and muttered something about revenge .— Jest as y ’ like ,— said the young man John .— Clap a slice o ’ raw beefsteak on to that mouse o ’ yours ‘ n ’ ‘ t 'll take down the swellin ’ . ( Mouse is a technical term for a bluish , oblong , rounded elevation occasioned by running one 's forehead or eyebrow against another 's knuckles .) The young fellow was particularly pleased that he had had an opportunity of trying his proficiency in the art of self-defence without the gloves . The Koh-i-noor did not favor us with his company for a day or two , being confined to his chamber , it was said , by a slight feverish attack . He was chop-fallen always after this , and got negligent in his person . The impression must have been a deep one ; for it was observed , that , when he came down again , his moustache and whiskers had turned visibly white — about the roots . In short , it disgraced him , and rendered still more conspicuous a tendency to drinking , of which he had been for some time suspected . This , and the disgust which a young lady naturally feels at hearing that her lover has been “ licked by a fellah not half his size , ” induced the landlady 's daughter to take that decided step which produced a change in the programme of her career I may hereafter allude to . I never thought he would come to good , when I heard him attempting to sneer at an unoffending city so respectable as Boston . After a man begins to attack the State-House , when he gets bitter about the Frog-Pond , you may be sure there is not much left of him . Poor Edgar Poe died in the hospital soon after he got into this way of talking ; and so sure as you find an unfortunate fellow reduced to this pass , you had better begin praying for him , and stop lending him money , for he is on his last legs . Remember poor Edgar ! He is dead and gone ; but the State-House has its cupola fresh-gilded , and the Frog-Pond has got a fountain that squirts up a hundred feet into the air and glorifies that humble sheet with a fine display of provincial rainbows . — I cannot fulfil my promise in this number . I expected to gratify your curiosity , if you have become at all interested in these puzzles , doubts , fancies , whims , or whatever you choose to call them , of mine . Next month you shall hear all about it . — It was evening , and I was going to the sick-chamber . As I paused at the door before entering , I heard a sweet voice singing . It was not the wild melody I had sometimes heard at midnight :— no , this was the voice of Iris , and I could distinguish every word . I had seen the verses in her book ; the melody was new to me . Let me finish my page with them . HYMN OF TRUST . O Love Divine , that stooped to share Our sharpest pang , our bitterest tear , On Thee we cast each earthborn care , We smile at pain while Thou art near ! Though long the weary way we tread , And sorrow crown each lingering year , No path we shun , no darkness dread , Our hearts still whispering , Thou art near ! When drooping pleasure turns to grief , And trembling faith is changed to fear , The murmuring wind , the quivering leaf Shall softly tell us , Thou art near ! On Thee we fling our burdening woe , O Love Divine , forever dear , Content to suffer , while we know , Living and dying , Thou art near ! ART . PICTURES AT SEVILLE AND MADRID . Seville , January , 1859 . I do not know whether I ought not to take you to the Museo on so bright a morning , although I should like better to stroll with you on the Paseo by the pretty river across which I look to the faintly seen hills of Ronda , with the rich palm-trees in the foreground , and a great stone pine in the middle distance , which would recall to us the Campagna and Italy . Many people have said to me , “ You cannot judge of Murillo till you see him at Seville , ” — they , of course , having been at Seville . This is so far true , that his best picture is undoubtedly in the Cathedral here ; but in all other ways , Murillo is perfectly to be seen in other cities . You know , therefore , just what the pictures and the Museo have to say to you . They speak of a most clever artist , who evidently consulted Nature conscientiously , and who perceived and understood very often many phases of her grace and beauty . The most masterly of his fifteen or twenty pictures in the gallery is the one of Saint Thomas of Villanueva giving Alms to the Poor ; and it is , certainly , charmingly arranged , with great breadth of effect and clever drawing ,— on a cool scale of color throughout . The Saint is in a black robe , relieved against a light background of gray wall . The beggar who is receiving alms is capitally understood , and carries the light broadly through the picture . A charming little boy leans against his mother in the left-hand corner , in half shadow , and shows her the coin in his hand . A few other heads fill up the right-hand of the picture behind the Saint . A red drapery , of a dull color , and a touch of brown-red here and there , warm the agreeable grayness of the rest of the canvas . I like much , also , a “ Conception , ” in many respects like the usual picture which Murillo repeated so often ; but the Virgin in this one is represented as very young ,— about twelve or fourteen years old ,— and the whole effect is most silvery and delicate . But the Saint Antonio in the Cathedral is , I should say , his great picture . It is very simple , and full of feeling . The Saint , half kneeling , stretches forward to the vision of the Christ-Child , which descends in a glory of cherubim toward him . The great mass of light falls directly upon the kneeling figure and the upturned face , and throws strong shadows on the ground . One is reminded , in some of the angel-figures , of the brilliant light and shadow on the little flying cherubs in the “ Assumption , ” at Venice . Here all is silvery , where in Titian all burns with the glory of a Venetian sunset . But this picture of Murillo seems to me what one must call an eminently “ happy ” picture . It gives one the idea that the painter enjoyed painting it , for the expressive movement of the Saint is most admirably given , and the extreme simplicity of every part of the picture is most agreeable ; so that we are ready to give great praise to Murillo for what he did , and to say that he was earnest and tried to represent what he really felt . And when we say that , we say a great deal ; do we not ? But we cannot , for a moment , compare him to the great Venetians . He did not attempt what they did , because he did not feel it at all ; and , as a painter , he is not comparable to them . One sees that he executed with rapidity and a sort of dash , as it were . The Venetian concealed his execution , as Nature does , and attempted to render the most subtile things which he knew his art alone could give , in their full force and beauty . As a painter , therefore , he cannot be compared with men who wrought from so different a principle . And when we think of the lovely elevation and noble thought in the great Venetians , we must quietly rest grateful for those great blessings ,— grateful and happy that they exist , and that we , in some measure at least , understand and appreciate their meaning . Is it not delightful to think of them and know them in their precious old corners and over their dear old altars ? Madrid , March , 1859 . You see that we have at last left Andalusia , and are here in what is like a bit of Paris ,— shops , dress , carriages , and now and then the smell of asphalt pavement being renewed . Still , mantillas are the coverings for the female head , and peasants in costumes drive mules and donkeys through the crowds in the busy streets , and one is still in Spain . We came , you know , for the gallery , and the first glimpse of it showed us that we have enough to do to see that , during our proposed stay of a month . I must tell you just a few things about the pictures , and give you a peep at Madrid through my eyes , since you are not here to use your own . Murillo is here the same as everywhere else . I very much prefer his pictures in Seville . Velasquez , however , is to be really seen nowhere so well as here . I do not know how many pictures there are here by him , but a great quantity , it seems to me : Philips without number , in childhood , youth , and age ; Dons with curled moustaches ; Queens with large hoops and disfigured heads ; an actor , full of life and character , one of his very best . But his greatest picture , and really a wonder , is his portrait of himself painting the little Infanta , who is in the foreground of the picture with two young girls , her court ladies , her dwarf , and a diminutive page . It is quite like a photograph , in clear , broad effect of light and dark . From the other side of the room , full of truth and vigor ,— as you approach it , you find it is dashed in with a surety of touch and a breadth truly extraordinary ,— no details , no substance even ; painted with one huge brush , it would almost seem , all is vigorous , dashing , clever , the triumph of chic , as shown by a master hand . The dog in the immediate foreground is capital , the page pushing him playfully with his foot . The dwarf stands next , full of a sort of quaint truth , with her big head and heavy chin . The mass of light falls on the Infanta , who takes a cup of something , chocolate , I suppose , from one of the kneeling girls , while the other makes a reverence on the other side . Beyond are a nun and a guarda-damas , and in the mirror at the other end of the room are most cleverly indicated the portraits of Philip and his wife . Velasquez stands on the left of the picture , behind the Infanta , painting , with his canvas turned back toward us as we look into the room . The black figure of an attendant has passed out of the apartment and is going up a stair against a clear white wall . The skilful way in which you are led into the picture is astonishing , and the whole thing is quite by itself as a piece of painting . There is no attempt at anything subtile or even delicate in the treatment , speaking from the point of view of a result achieved by paint on canvas ,— no texture , no difference of handling , no imitation ; all is paint , admirably put on , for the effect across the room . I think we must set Velasquez quite by himself as a truthful and surely most gifted portrait-master . With a peculiar gift ,— genius , I think we might say ,— certainly he is like no one else , and nobody else is like him . Then there is his equestrian portrait of Philip IV ., of which you may remember the sketch in the Pitti Gallery ,— also one of the Duke of Olivarez , fresh , dashing , and spirited . But I prefer the portrait of — some actor , I am sure ,— full of character , against a gray wall background ,— one of those faces one is sure one has seen somewhere in Spain , and he is declaiming evidently with the most capital action .— So much for Velasquez . But I hardly dare attempt to tell you of the glory of the great Titian , who seems almost newly revealed , in many perfect works . Nothing can equal the superb style of a portrait of Alfonso of Ferrara ; it is like nothing but Nature ,— a splendid , dark , manly face and figure , standing and looking thoughtfully at you , or rather , beyond you , caressing in an absent way a little silky dog who puts his paw up to attract his master 's notice . The glowing flesh , the superbly painted dress of deep blue with fine arabesques of gold ,— the delicate hand lying on the soft , silky hair of the dog , with its turquoise ring on the second joint of one of the fingers ,— you can imagine it , can you not ? Next him stands Philip II ., pale , elegant , and repulsive , in gorgeous armor worn over festal , glittering white satin . Charles V. is on the other side ; and I hardly know which of these portraits is the finest as a work of Art , for all are perfect . Charles is standing , with a noble dog leaning up against his hand ; there is something simp á tica in his gray eyes , his worn face , and even in his protruding jaw , it is so admirably rendered , and gives such a firm character to the face . His costume is elegant í simo , white satin and gold ,— with a tissue-of-gold doublet , and a cassock of silver-damask , with great black fur collar and lining , against which is relieved the under-dress ; he wears his velvet cap and plume , and a deep emerald satin curtain hangs on his right hand . These portraits are just about as wonderful as any you may remember ,— in his best style and in capital condition . But I know you would say that the great portrait of Charles on horseback is more grand . It is a sort of heroic poem ; he looks like Sir Galahad , or Chivalry itself , going forth to conquer wrong and violence . His eager , worn face looks out from the helmet so calmly and so steadily , the flash of his armor , which gleams like real metal , the coal-black horse , which comes forward out of the landscape shaking his head-piece of blood-red plumes against the golden sunset sky and champing the golden bit , the grasp of the lance by the noble rider : well , painting can do no more than that . It is history , poetry , and the beauty of Nature recreated by the grand master . An entirely different phase of his character is seen in his Ariadne Asleep surrounded by the Bacchanals . This is full of antique Grecian feeling ; and such a subtile , delicious piece of painting ! Ariadne is in the foreground , full of warm , breathing life , her arm thrown over her lovely head , and her golden hair falling over the vase of gold and onyx on which she rests ; a river of red wine runs through the emerald grass ; two beautiful girls have just put by their music and instruments , and one turns her exquisite face toward us to speak to the other reclining on the grass . The one who turns to us is the beauty of the Louvre , or some one very like her , in full Venetian loveliness . In her bosom are one or two violets and a paper with Titianus written on it . The bit of music on the grass has Greek letters . Dancing figures are in the middle of the picture . The fauns stagger under the dark trees , carrying great sumptuous vases of agate and gold . Silenus is asleep on a sunny hill at a distance , and the white sails of the ship with Theseus gleam on the deep-blue sea . There is another called an Offering to Fecundity . It is a crowd of most lovely baby boys , wonderfully painted , frolicking on the green among flowers and fruits . A figure full of action and passion holds up a glass to the statue of the goddess in one corner . The children are kissing each other and carrying about baskets of fruit ; these baskets are hung with rich pearls and rubies and gems of all kinds . The green , fresh trees wave against a summer sky , and the work is full of tender , sensitive elegance and love . It shows to me an entirely new side of Titian in its extreme delicacy and sweetness . Nobody can ever speak of a “ want of refinement ” in Titian , if they thought so before , after seeing these pictures . Then there is the Herodias , the same as the girl in Dresden who holds up the casket ,— wonderfully delicate and beautiful ; and several other portraits and pictures , which I cannot tell you of , even if you are not already tired . I ought , however , to say that Paul Veronese has a very fine Venus and Adonis here , full of sunlight and summer beauty , and Christ Teaching the Doctors , nobly serious in character and admirable in treatment ; also two sketches of Cain and of Vice and Virtue , very full of feeling for his subject . The Cain has his back toward you . His wife and child look up at him entreatingly . There is a fine , solemn horizon with a gleam of twilight . There are several Tintorets , but no favorable specimens ,— a portrait is the best . There is also a Giovanni Bellini , which brings back the Venetian altar-pieces , quiet and lovely ; and a Giorgione , like the large one in the Louvre , in many ways ; a Madonna and Infant , with a fine female Saint and a noble Saint George . These are some of the glorious treasures which the Spaniards own . If we could only have some of these ! or if , while we or our country are committing the sin of coveting the Spanish possessions , we would only covet something worth the having ! I confess , I should delight to take away one or two fine jewels of pictures that nobody here would miss . I had almost forgotten to mention the great Raphael , the “ Spasimo . ” It is in his Roman style , with much that is , to me , forced in the action and expression . The head of Christ , however , is beautiful , and exquisitely drawn . Beside the Spasimo , there is a little picture of the Virgin and Child , with Saint Joseph , in Raphael 's early manner , very lovely , and reminding one of the “ Staffa ” Madonna , at Perugia . It is faint in color , and most charming in careful execution . Then there are the finest Hemmlings I have ever seen ,— finer than those at Munich : lovely Madonnas , meek and saintly ; superb adoring Kings , all glowing with cloth-of-gold and velvets and splendid jewels ; beautiful quiet landscapes , seen through the arches of the stable ; and angels , with wings of dazzling green and crimson . The real love with which these wonderful pictures are caressed by the careful , thoughtful artist makes them most precious . Every little flower is delicately and artistically done , and everything is invested with a sort of sacred reverence by this earnest Pre-Raphaelite . One or two Van Eycks have the same splendor and depth of feeling . These pictures look as if they were painted yesterday , so clear and brilliant are their colors . It is a pleasant circumstance , that some of the great Venetian pictures in the gallery here were gained for Spain by the judgment and taste of Velasquez . When he went to Italy with a commission from Philip IV ., which it must have delighted him to execute , “ to buy whatever pictures were for sale that he thought worth purchasing , ” he spent some time in Venice , and there bought , among other things , the Venus and Adonis of Paul Veronese , and several of the works of Tintoretto . The Titians had come to Spain before , and it was from the study of them , perhaps , that Velasquez learned to paint so well . At any rate , we know what he thought of Titian ; for Mr. Sterling gives an extract from a poem by a Venetian , Marco Boschini , which was published not long after Velasquez 's journey to Italy , in which part of a conversation is given between him and Salvator Rosa , who asked him what he thought of Raphael . You will like to see it , if you have not Sterling by you . “ Lu storse el cao cirimoniosamente , E disse : ‘ Rafael ( a dirve el vero , Piasendome esser libero e sinciero ) Stago per dir che nol me piase niente . ’ “ ‘ Tanto che , ’ replich è quela persona , ‘ Co ’ no ve piase questo gran Pitor , In Italia nissun ve d à in l ’ umor , Perche nu ghe donemo la corona . ’ “ Don Diego replich è con tal maniera : ‘ A Venetia se trova el bon e ‘ l belo ; Mi dago el primo luogo a quel penelo ; Tician x è quel che porta la bandiera . ’ ” Here is a translation :— The master , with a ceremonious air , Bowed , and then said , “ Raphael , truth to tell , For to be free and honest suits me well , Pleases me not at all , I must declare . ” “ Since , then , ” replied the other , “ you so frown On this great painter , in Italy is none By whom , indeed , your favor can be won ; For upon him we all bestow the crown . ” Don Diego thereupon to him replies , “ At Venice may be found the good and fair ; I give the first place to the pencil there ; Titian is he who carries off the prize . ” REVIEWS AND LITERARY NOTICES . 1 .

Scribner . 1859. pp . 302 . The first allusion we know of to an Americanism is that of Gill , in 1621 ,— “ Sed et ab Americanis nonnulla mutuamur , ut MAIZ et KANOA . ” Since then , English literature , not without many previous wry faces , has adopted or taken back many words from this side of the water . The more the matter is looked into , the more it appears that we have no peculiar dialect of our own , and that men here , as elsewhere , have modified language or invented phrases to suit their needs . When Dante wrote his “ De Vulgari Eloquio , ” he reckoned nearly a thousand distinct dialects in the Italian peninsula , and , after more than five hundred years , it is said that by far the greater part survive . In England , eighty years ago , the county of every member of Parliament was to be known by his speech ; but in “ both Englands , ” as they used to be called , the tendency is toward uniformity . In spite of the mingling of races and languages in the United States , the speech of the people is more uniform than that of any European nation . This would inevitably follow from our system of common-schools , and the universal reading of newspapers . This has tended to make the common language of talk more bookish , and has thus reacted unfavorably on our literature , giving it sometimes the air of being composed in a dead tongue rather than written from a living one . It gladdens us , we confess , to see how goodly a volume of Americanisms Mr. Bartlett has been enabled to gather , for it shows that our language is alive . It is only from the roots that a language can be refreshed ; a dialect that is taught grows more and more pedantic , and becomes at last as unfit a vehicle for living thought as monkish Latin . This is the danger which our literature has to guard against from the universal Schoolmaster , who wars upon home-bred phrases , and enslaves the mind and memory of his victims , as far as may be , to the best models of English composition ,— that is to say , to the writers whose style is faultlessly correct , but has no blood in it . No language , after it has faded into diction , none that cannot suck up feeding juices from the mother-earth of a rich common-folk-talk , can bring forth a sound and lusty book . True vigor of expression does not pass from page to page , but from man to man , where the brain is kindled and the lips are limbered by downright living interests and by passions in the very throe . Language is the soil of thought ; and our own especially is a rich leaf-mould , the slow growth of ages , the shed foliage of feeling , fancy , and imagination , which has suffered an earth-change , that the vocal forest , as Howell called it , may clothe itself anew with living green . There is death in the Dictionary ; and where language is limited by convention , the ground for expression to grow in is straitened also , and we get a potted literature , Chinese dwarfs instead of healthy trees . We are thankful to Mr. Bartlett for the onslaught he makes in his Introduction upon the highfaluting style so common among us . But we are rather amused to find him falling so easily into that Anglo-Saxon trap which is the common pitfall of those half-learned men among whom we should be slow to rank him . [ A ] He says , “ The unfortunate tendency to favor the Latin at the expense of the Saxon element of our language , which social and educational causes have long tended to foster in the mother country , has with us received an additional impulse from the great admixture of foreigners in our population . ” ( p . xxxii .) We have underscored the words of Latin origin , and find that they include all the nouns , all the adjectives but two , and three out of five verbs ,— one of these last ( the auxiliary have ) being the same in both Latin and Saxon . Speaking of the Bostonians , Mr. Bartlett says , “ The great extent to which the scholars of New England have carried the study of the German language and literature for some years back , added to the very general neglect of the old master-pieces of English composition , have [ has ] had the effect of giving to the writings of many of them an artificial , unidiomatic character , which has an inexpressibly unpleasant effect to those who are not habituated to it . ” ( p. xxv . We again underscore the un-Saxon words .) Now if there be any short cut to the Anglo-Saxon , it is through the German ; and how far the Bostonians deserve the reproach of a neglect of old English masterpieces we do not pretend to say , but the first modern reprint of the best works of Latimer , More , Sidney , Fuller , Selden , Browne , and Feltham was made in Boston , under the care of the late Dr. Alexander Young . We have no wish to defend Boston ; we mean only to call Mr. Bartlett 's attention to the folly of asking people to write in a dialect which no longer exists . No man can write off-hand a page of Saxon English ; no man with pains can write one and hope to be commonly understood . At least let Mr. Bartlett practise what he preaches . When a deputation of wig-makers waited on George III . to protest against the hair-powder-tax , the mob , seeing that one of them wore his own hair , ducked him forthwith in Tower-Ditch ,— a very Anglo-Saxon comment on his inconsistency . We should not have noticed these passages in Mr. Bartlett 's Introduction , had he not , after eleven years ’ time to weigh them in , let them remain as they stood in his former edition , of 1848 . In other respects the volume before us greatly betters its forerunner . That contained many words which were rather vulgarisms than provincialisms , and more properly English than American . Almost all these Mr. Bartlett has left out in revising his book . Once or twice , however , he has retained as Americanisms phrases which are proverbial , such as “ born in the woods to be scared of an owl , ” “ to carry the foot in the hand , ” and “ hallooing before you 're out of the woods . ” But it will be easier to follow the alphabetical order in our short list of adversaria and comments . ALEWIFE . We doubt if Mr. Bartlett is right in deriving this from a supposed Indian word aloof . At least , Hakluyt speaks of a fish called “ old-wives ” ; and in some other old book of travels we have seen the name derived from the likeness of the fish , with its good , round belly , to the mistress of an alehouse . BANK-BILL . Is not an Americanism . It is used by Swift , Pope , and Fielding . BOGUS . Mr. Bartlett quotes a derivation of this word from the name of a certain Borghese , said to have been a notorious counterfeiter of bank-notes . But is it not more probably a corruption of bagasse , which , as applied to the pressed sugarcane , means simply something worthless ? The word originally meant a worthless woman , whence our “ baggage ” in the same sense . Footnote A : This , perhaps , was to be expected ; for he calls Dr. Latham 's English Language “ unquestionably the most valuable work on English philology and grammar — which has yet appeared , ” ( p . xxx ., note ,) and refers to the first edition of 1841 . If Mr. Bartlett must allude at all to Dr. Latham , ( who is reckoned a great blunderer among English philologers ,) he should at least have referred to the second edition of his work , in two volumes , 1855 . This , perhaps , was to be expected ; for he calls Dr. Latham 's English Language “ unquestionably the most valuable work on English philology and grammar — which has yet appeared , ” ( p . xxx ., note ,) and refers to the first edition of 1841 . If Mr. Bartlett must allude at all to Dr. Latham , ( who is reckoned a great blunderer among English philologers ,) he should at least have referred to the second edition of his work , in two volumes , 1855 . CHAINED-LIGHTNING . More commonly chain-lightning , and certainly not a Western phrase exclusively . CHEBACCO-BOAT . Mr. Bartlett says , “ This word is doubtless a corruption of Chedabucto , the name of a bay in Nova Scotia , from which vessels are fitted out for fishing . ” This is going a great way down East for what could be found nearer . Chebacco is ( or was , a century since ) the name of a part of Ipswich , Massachusetts . TO FALL a tree Mr. Bartlett considers a corruption of to fell . But , as we have commonly heard the words used , to fell means merely to cut down , while to fall means to make it fall in a given direction . TO GO UNDER . “ To perish . An expression adopted from the figurative language of the Indians by the Western trappers and residents of the prairies . ” Not the first time that the Indians have had undue credit for poetry . The phrase is undoubtedly a translation of the German untergehen ( fig .) , to perish . HAT . “ Our Northern women have almost discarded the word bonnet , except in sun-bonnet , and use the term hat instead . A like fate has befallen the word gown , for which both they and their Southern sisters commonly use frock or dress . ” We do not know where Mr. Bartlett draws his Northern line ; but in Massachusetts we never heard the word hat or frock used in this sense . They are so used in England , and hat is certainly , frock probably , nearer Anglo-Saxon than bonnet and gown . IMPROVE . Mr. Bartlett quotes Dr. Franklin as saying in 1789 , “ When I left New England in the year 1723 , this word had never been used among us , as far as I know , but in the sense of ameliorated or made better , except once in a very old book of Dr. Mather 's , entitled Remarkable Providences . ” Dr. Increase Mather 's Providences was published in 1684 . In 1679 a synod assembled at Boston , and the result of its labors was published in the same year by John Foster , under the title , Necessity of a Reformation . On the sixth page we find , “ Taverns being for the entertainment of strangers , which , if they were improved to that end only , ” etc . Oddly enough , our copy of this tract has Dr. Mather 's autograph on the title-page . But Mr. Bartlett should have referred to Richardson , who shows that the word had been in use long before with the same meaning . To INHEAVEN . “ A word invented by the Boston transcendentalists . ” And Mr. Bartlett quotes from Judd 's Margaret . Mr. Judd was a good scholar , and the word is legitimately compounded , like ensphere and imparadise ; but he did not invent it . Dante uses the word :— “ Perfetta vita ed alto merto inciela Donna pi ú su . ” LADIES ’ TRESSES . “ The popular name , in the Southern States , for an herb , ” etc . In the Northern States also . Sometimes Ladies ’ Traces . LIEFER . “ A colloquialism , also used in England . ” Excellent Anglo-Saxon , and used wherever English is spoken . LOAFER . We think there can be no doubt that this word is German . Laufen in some parts of Germany is pronounced lofen , and we once heard a German student say to his friend , Ich lauf ’ ( lofe ) hier bis du wiederkehrst : and he began accordingly to saunter up and down ,— in short , to loaf about . TO MULL . “ To soften , to dispirit . ” Mr. Bartlett quotes Margaret ,— “ There has been a pretty considerable mullin going on among the doctors . ” But mullin here means stirring , bustling in an underhand way , and is a metaphor derived from mulling wine . Mull , in this sense , is probably a corruption of mell , from Old Fr . mesler , to mix . TO BE NOWHERE ( in the sense of failure ) is not an Americanism , but Turf-Slang . SALLY-LUN , a kind of cake , is English . TO SAVE , meaning to kill game so as to get it , is not confined to the Far West , but is common to hunters in all parts of the country . SHEW , for showed . Mr. Bartlett calls this the “ shibboleth of Bostonians . ” However this may be , it is simply an archaism , not a vulgarism . Show , like blow , crow , grow , seems formerly to have had what is called a strong preterite . Shew is used by Lord Cromwell and Hector Boece . SLASHES . “ Swampy or wet lands overgrown with bushes . Southern and Western . ” Used also in New York . SPAN of horses is Dutch ( High or Low ) . TO WALK SPANISH ; to “ walk ” a boy out of any place by the waistband of his trousers , or by any lower part easily prehensible . N. E . This is , perhaps , as old as Philip and Mary . TO SPREAD ONE 'S SELF is defined by Mr. Bartlett “ to exert one 's self . ” It means rather to exert one 's self ostentatiously . It is a capital metaphor , derived , we fancy , from the turkey-cock or peacock ,— like the Italian pavoneggiarsi . We find in the Tatler “ spreading her graces in assemblies . ” This last , however , may be a Gallicism , from é taler . STRAW BAIL . “ Worthless bail , bail given by ‘ men of straw . ’ ” This is surely no Americanism , and we have seen its origin very differently explained , namely , that men willing for a fee to become bail walked in the neighborhood of the courts with straws stuck in their shoes ,— though Mr. Bartlett 's explanation is ingenious . SUNFISH . Mr. Bartlett thinks this a corruption ; but the resemblance of the fish , as seen in the water , to the ordinary portraits of the sun in almanacs and on tavern-signs seems to us enough to account for the name . A few phrases occur to us that have escaped Mr. Bartlett . A CARRY : portage . Passim . CAT-NAP : a short doze . New England . CHOWDER-HEAD : muddle-brain . New England . COHEES ( accent on the last syllable ): term applied to the people of certain settlements in Western Pennsylvania , from their use of the archaic form , Quo ’ he . TO COTTON TO . DON ’ KNOW AS I KNOW : the nearest your true Yankee ever comes to acknowledging ignorance . GANDER-PARTY : a social gathering of men only . New England . LAP-TEA : where the guests are too many to sit at table . Massachusetts . LAST OF PEA-TIME : day after fair . LOSE-LAID ( loose-laid ): weaver 's term , and probably English ; means weak-willed . Massachusetts . MOONGLADE : a beautiful word for the track of moonlight on the water . Massachusetts . OFF-OX : an unmanageable fellow . New England . OLD DRIVER : } euphemistic for the OLD SPLIT-FOOT : } Devil . ONHITCH ( unhitch ): to pull trigger . ROTE : sound of the surf before a storm . Used also in England . New England . SEEM : I can n't seem to see , for I can n't see . She could n't seem to be suited , for could n't be suited . STATE-HOUSE . This seems an Americanism . Did we invent it , or borrow it from the Stad-huys ( town-hall ) of New Amsterdam ? As an instance of the tendency to uniformity in American usage , we notice that in Massachusetts what has always been the State-House is beginning to be called the Capitol . We are sorry for it . STRIKE : } terms of the game of STRING : } nine-pins . SWALE : a hollow . New England . English also ; see Forby . TORMENTED : euphemistic , as “ not a tormented cent . ” New England . WELL-SWEEP . We have gone through Mr. Bartlett 's book with the attention which a work so well done deserves , and are thoroughly impressed with the amount of care and labor to which it bears witness . We have quarrelled with it wherever we could , because it cannot fail to become the standard authority in its department . Its value will increase from year to year . For instance , the Spanish words , in which it is especially rich , are doomed to undergo strange metamorphoses on Anglo-Saxon lips ; for it is the instinct of the unlearned to naturalize words as fast as possible , and to compel them to homebred shapes and sounds . There is often an unwitting humor in these perversions , [ A ] and they are always interesting as showing that it is the nature of man to use words with understanding , however appearances might lead us to an opposite conclusion . Footnote A : We remember once hearing a man say of something , that it was written in a “ very grand delinquent [ grandiloquent ] style , ” — a phrase certainly not without modern application . We have heard also Angola-Saxons and Angular-Saxons ,— the latter , at least , not an unhappy perversion . We remember once hearing a man say of something , that it was written in a “ very grand delinquent [ grandiloquent ] style , ” — a phrase certainly not without modern application . We have heard also Angola-Saxons and Angular-Saxons ,— the latter , at least , not an unhappy perversion . The least satisfactory part of Mr. Bartlett 's book is the Appendix , in which he has got together a few proverbs and similes , which , it seems to us , do no kind of justice to the humor and invention of the people . Most of them have no characteristic at all , except coarseness . We hope there is nothing peculiarly American in such examples as these :— “ Evil actions , like crushed rotten eggs , stink in the nostrils of all ” ; and “ Vice is a skunk that smells awfully rank when stirred up by the pole of misfortune . ” These have , beside , an artificial air , and are quite too long-skirted for working proverbs , in which language always “ takes off its coat to it , ” if we may use a proverbial phrase , left out by Mr. Bartlett . We confess , we looked for something racier and of a more puckery flavor . One hears such now and then , mostly from the West ,— like “ Mean enough to steal acorns from a blind hog ” ; “ I take my tea bar-foot , ” the answer of a backwoodsman , when asked if he would have cream and sugar . Some are unmistakably Eastern ; as , “ All deacons are good ,— but there 's odds in deacons ” ; “ He 's a whole team and the dog under the wagon ” ; “ That 's first-rate and a half ” ; “ Handy as a pocket in a shirt ” ( ironical ) . Almost every county has some good die sinker in language , who mints phrases that pass into the currency of a whole neighborhood . We picked up two such the other day , both of the same coinage . The county-jail ( the only stone building where all the dwellings were of wood ) was described as “ the house whose underpinning comes up to the eaves ” ; while the place unmentionable to ears polite was “ where they do n't rake up the fires at night . ” A man , speaking to us once of a very rocky clearing , said , “ Stone 's got a pretty heavy mortgage on that farm ” ; and another , wishing to give us a notion of the thievishness common in a certain village , capped his climax thus :— “ Dishonest ! why , they have to take in their stone walls o ’ nights . ” Any one who has driven over a mountain-stream by one of those bridges made of slabs will feel the force of a term we once heard applied to a parson so shaky in character that no dependence could be placed on him ,— “ A slab-bridged kind o ’ feller ! ” During some very cold weather , a few years ago , we picked a notable saying or two . “ The fire do n't seem to git no kind o ’ purchase on the cold . ” “ They say Cap'n M'Clure ' s gone through the Northwest Passage . ” “ Has ? Think likely , and left the door open , too ! ” Elder Knapp , the once noted itinerant preacher , had a kind of unwashed poetry in him . We heard him say once ,— “ Do you want to know when a Unitarian ” ( we think it was ) “ will get into heaven ? When hell 's froze over , and he can skate in ! ” We quote merely for illustration , and do not mean to compare the Elder with Taylor or South . The element of exaggeration has often been remarked on as typical of American humor . In Dr. Petri 's “ Compact Handbook of Foreign Words ,"[ A ] ( from which Mr. Bartlett will be surprised to learn that Hoco-pocos is a nickname for the Whig party in the United States ,) we are told that the word humbug “ is commonly used for the exaggerations of the North-Americans . ” One would think the dream of Columbus half-fulfilled , and that Europe had found in the West the near way to Orientalism , at least of diction . But it seems to us that a great deal of what is set down as mere exaggeration is more fitly to be called intensity and picturesqueness , symptoms of the imaginative faculty in full health and strength , though producing , as yet , only the raw material . [ B ] By-and-by , perhaps , the world will see it worked up into poem and picture , and Europe , which will be hard-pushed for originality ere long , may thank us for a new sensation . The French continue to find Shakspeare exaggerated , because he treated English just as our folk do when they speak of “ a steep price , ” or say that they “ freeze to ” a thing . The first postulate of an original literature is , that a people use their language as if they owned it . Even Burns contrived to write very poor English . Vulgarisms are often only poetry in the egg . The late Horace Mann , in one of his Addresses , commented at some length on the beauty of the French phrase s'orienter , and called on his young hearers to practise it in life . There was not a Yankee in his audience whose problem had not always been to find out what was “ about east ” and shape his course accordingly . The Germans have a striking proverb ; Was die Gans gedacht , das der Schwan vollbracht ; What the goose but thought , that the swan fullbrought ; or , to de-Saxonize it a little , pace Mr. Bartlett , What the goose conceived , that the swan achieved ;— and we cannot help thinking , that the life , invention , and vigor shown in our popular speech , and the freedom with which it is shaped to the need of those who wield it , are of the best omen for our having a swan at last .

The passages he quotes in illustration are sometimes strangely comic . Here is one : “ To SAVE . To make sure , i. e ., to kill game , or an enemy , whether man or beast . To get conveys the same meaning .... The notorious Judge W —— of Texas ... once said in a speech at a barbecue , ( after his political opponent had been apologizing for taking a man 's life in a duel ,) — “ ‘ The gentleman need not make such a fuss about getting such a rascal ; everybody knows that I have shot three , and two of them I saved . ’ ” We have but one fault to find with Mr. Bartlett 's Dictionary , and that it shares with all other provincial glossaries . No accents are given . No stranger could tell , for example , whether hacmatack should be pronounced hac'matack , hacma'tack , or hacmatack ’ . The value of Mr. Wright 's otherwise excellent dictionary is very much impaired by this neglect . Ignorance of the pronunciation enhances tenfold the difficulty of tracing analogies or detecting corruptions . The title of Mr. Coleridge 's volume ( the second on our list ) is enough to give scholars a notion of its worth . It is the first instalment of the proposed comprehensive English Dictionary of the Philological Society , a work which , when finished , will be beyond measure precious to all students of their mother-tongue . At the end of the volume will be found the Plan of the Society , with minute directions for all those who wish to give their help . Cooperation on this side the water will be gladly welcomed . Of Dean Trench 's two volumes , one is new , and the other a revised edition . No one has done more than he to popularize the study of words , which is only another name for the study of thought . His new book has the same agreeable qualities which marked its forerunners , maintaining an easy conversational level of scholarly gossip and reflection , the middle ground between learning and information for the million . Without great philological attainments , and without any pretence of such , he gives the results of much good reading . Mr. Craik 's book is a compact and handy manual . The SLANG Dictionaries are both as ill-done as possible , and the author of the smaller one deserves to be put under the pump for taking the name of the illustrious Ducange , one of those megatheria of erudition and industry that we should look on as an extinct species , but for such men as the brothers Grimm . The larger book has the merit of including a bibliography of the subject , for which the author deserves our thanks , though in other respects showing no least qualification for the task he has undertaken . We trust there are not many “ London Antiquaries ” so ignorant as he . One curious fact we glean from his volume , namely , the currency among the London populace of certain Italian words , chiefly for the smaller pieces of money . What a strident invasion of organ-grinders does this seem to indicate ! The author gives them thus : “ Oney saltec , a penny ; Dooe saltee , twopence ; Tray saltee , threepence , ” etc ., and adds , “ These numerals , as will be seen , are of mongrel origin ,— the French , perhaps , predominating . ” ! He must be the gentleman who , during the Exhibition of 1851 , wrote on his door , “ No French spoken here . ” Dooe saltee and tray saltee differ little but in spelling from their Italian originals , due soldi and tre soldi . On another page we find molto cattivo transmogrified into “ multee kertever , very had . ” Very bad , indeed ! For one more good thing beside the Bibliography , we are indebted to the “ London Antiquary . ” In his Introduction he has reprinted the earliest list of cant words in the language , that made by Thomas Harman in Elizabeth 's time . We wish we could only feel sure of the accuracy of the reprint . In this list we find already the adjective rum meaning good , fine ,— a word that has crept into general use among the lower classes in London , without ever gaining promotion . The fate of new words in this respect is curious . Often , if they are convenient , or have knack of lodging easily in the memory , they work slowly upward . The Scotch word flunky is a case in point . Our first knowledge of it in print is from Fergusson 's Poems . Burns advertised it more widely , and Carlyle seems fairly to have transplanted it into the English of the day . As we believe its origin is still obscure , we venture on a guess at it . French allies brought some words into Scotland that have rooted themselves , like the Edinburgh gardyloo . Flunky is defined in Fergusson 's glossary as “ a better kind of servant . ” This is an exact definition of the Scotch hench-man , the most probable original of which is haunch-man or body-guard . Turn haunch-man into French and you get flanquier ; corrupt it back into Scotch and you have flunky . Whatever liberties we take with French words , the Gauls have their revenge when they take possession of an English one . We once saw an Avis of the police in Paris , regulating les chiens et les boule dogues , dogs and bull-dogs . Vocabularies of vulgarisms are of interest for the archaisms both of language and pronunciation which we find in them . The dictionaries say coverlet , as if the word were a diminutive ; the rustic persists in the termination lid , which points to the French lit , bed . On the other hand , he still says hankercher , having been taught so by his betters , though they have taken up the final f again . Sewel , in the Introduction to his Dutch Dictionary , 1691 , gives henketsjer , and Voltaire , forty years later , hankercher , as the received pronunciation . Sewel tells us also that the significant l was still sounded in would and should , as it still is by the peasantry in many parts of England . Mr. Swinton 's book , the last on our list , is an entertaining one , and gives proof of thought , though sometimes smothered in fine writing . It is written altogether too loosely for a work on philology , one of the exactest of sciences . But we have a graver fault to find with Mr. Swinton , and that is for his neglect to give credit where he is indebted . He seems even desirous to conceal his obligations . The general acknowledgment of his Preface is by no means enough , where the debt is so large . The great merit of Dr. Richardson 's Dictionary being the number of illustrative passages he has brought together , it is hardly fair in Mr. Swinton so often to make a show of learning with what he has got at second hand from the lexicographer . Dr. Trench could also make large reclamations , and several others . There is beside an unpleasant assumption of superiority in the book . An author who says that paganus means village , who makes ocula the plural of oculus , and who supposes that in petto means in little , is not qualified to settle Dr. Webster 's claims as a philologer , much less to treat him with contempt . The first two blunders we have cited may be slips of the pen or the press , but this cannot be true of the many wrong etymologies into which Mr. Swinton has fallen . We hope that in another edition he will correct these faults , for he shows a power to appreciate ideas which is worth more than mere scholarship , vastly more than the reputation of it among the unscholarly . A History and Description of New England , General and Local . By A. J. COOLIDGE and J . B. MANSFIELD . Illustrated with Numerous Engravings . In Two Volumes . Vol . I. Maine , New Hampshire , and Vermont . Boston : Austin J. Coolidge , 1859. pp . xxv ., 1023 . This is a book of great labor , being nothing less in plan than a condensed town-history of New England . In spite of all efforts to the contrary , one is forced to admit that there is very little poetry in American history . It is a record of advances in material prosperity , and scarce anything more . The only lumps of pure ore are the Idea which the Pilgrims were possessed with and its gradual incarnation in events and institutions . Beyond this all is barren . There is a fearful destitution of the picturesque elements . It is true that our local historians commonly avoid all romance as if it were of the Enemy ; but if we compare their labors with “ The Beauties of England and Wales , ” for example , the work certainly of uninspired men , we shall be convinced that the American Dryasdust suffers from poverty of material . There is no need to remind us of Hawthorne ; but he is such a genius as is rare everywhere , and could conjure poetry out of a country meeting-house . In books of this kind we see evidence of what is called the “ enterprise ” of our people on every page ,— one almost hears the hum of the factory-wheels , as he reads ,— but that is all . It is not to be wondered at that foreigners fail to find our country interesting , and that the only good book of American travels is that of De Tocqueville , who deals chiefly with abstract ideas . It is possible to conceive minds so constituted that they may reach before long the end of their interest in the number of shoes , yards of cotton , and the like , which we produce in a year . The only immortal Greek shoemaker is he who had the good luck to be snubbed by Apelles , and Penelope is the only manufacturer in antiquity whose name has come down to us . One thing in the narrative part of this volume is striking ,— the continual recurrence of massacre by the French and Indians . This is something to be borne in mind always by those who would understand the politics of our New England ancestors . We confess that we were surprised , the other day , to see a journal so able and generally so philosophical as the London “ Saturday Review ” joining in the outcry about the treatment of the Acadians . If our forefathers were ever wise and foreseeing , if they ever showed a capacity for large political views , it is proved by their early perception that the first question to be settled on this continent was , whether its destiny should be shaped by English or Keltic , by Romish or Protestant ideas . By what means they attempted to realize their thought is quite another question . Great events are not settled by sentimentalists , nor history written in milk-and-water . Uninteresting in many ways the Puritans doubtless were , but not in the least spoony . The volume before us contains a vast amount of matter and fulfils honestly what it promises . It tells all that is to be told in the way of fact and statistics . The first settlers , the clergymen , the enterprising citizens , the men of mark ,— all their names and dates are to be found here . Of the literary execution of the book we cannot speak highly . The style is of the worst . If a meeting-house is spoken of , it is a “ church edifice ” ; if the Indians set a house on fire , they “ apply the torch ” ; if a man takes to drink , he is seduced by “ the intoxicating cup ” ; even mountains are “ located . ” On page 68 , we read that “ the pent-up rage that had long heaved the savage bosom , and which had only been smouldering under the pacific policy of Shurt , now knew no bounds , and burst forth like the fiery torrent of the volcano ” ; on the same page , “ the impending doom which , like a storm-cloud in the heavens , had overhung with its sable drapery the settlements along the coast , and Pemaquid in particular . ” Of a certain tavern we are told that the daughters of the landlord were “ genteel , sprightly , intelligent young ladies , ambitious of display and of setting a rich and elegant table . ” This is no doubt true , but surely History should sift her tacts with a coarser sieve . In spite of these faults , the book is one which all New Englanders will find interesting , and we hope that in their second volume the authors will balance their commendable profusion of industry with a corresponding economy of fine writing . An Oration , delivered before the Municipal Authorities of the City of Boston , July 4 , 1850 . By GEORGE SUMNER , etc , etc , Boston . 1859. pp . 125 . The opposition in the Common Council to the order ( usual on such occasions in Boston ) to print the oration of Mr. Sumner , and the series of assaults it has encountered front the administration press , have given it a considerable , though secondary , importance . Intrinsically a performance of great merit , those on whom the weight of his arguments and learning fell disclosed their sense of its power by the anger of their debate and their efforts to repel it . Its value , as containing a fresh and instructive contribution to the knowledge of our Revolutionary history , derived from original sources of inquiry , explored by Mr. Sumner in person , would alone have rescued from neglect any ordinary Fourth-of-July oration . The services and aids of Spain , material and moral , pecuniary and diplomatic , to the American Revolutionary cause ,— the introduction , through the fortunes of Captain John Lee of Marblehead , of the American question into the policy and polities of Spain ,— the effect of the arrival of our National Declaration of the 4th of July , 1776 , on the fate of that gallant New England cruiser , then detained as a pirate , for his heroic exploits under our infant and unknown flag ,— the incidents of vast and varied labor and accomplishment in our behalf , connected with the name and administration of the eminent Spanish minister and statesman , Florida Blanca ,— the weaving and spreading out of that network of influences and circumstances , in the toils of which France and Spain entangled Great Britain , until she found herself confronted by much of the physical and all the moral power of the Continent , and from which all extrication was made hopeless , until the American Colonies should be free ,— the origin of “ the armed neutrality , ” and the shock it gave to the naval power of England , in the very crisis of the hopes of American liberty ,— are presented in a narrative , clear , condensed , and original . From the aspect of peace and freedom in which our country so happily reposes , going on prospering and increasing , “ by confidence in democratic principles , by faith in the people , and by the spirit of mutual forbearance and charity , ” the orator turns to that Europe to which our fathers there looked for succor , now “ echoing to the clang of arms , and hostile legions arrayed for combat . ” A tribute to Italy , for the gifts , poured out from her treasures of art , science , medical skill , and political knowledge , of literature and philosophy , to all the uses and adornments of human life , introduces a reference to the Italian Republics of the Middle Ages , which are shown to have been based on these great principles :— That all authority over the people emanates from the people ,— should return to them at stated intervals ,— and that its holders should be accountable to the people for its use . “ To those Republics , ” it is added , “ we also owe the practical demonstration of the great truth , that no state can long prosper or exist where intelligent labor is not held in honor , and that labor cannot be honorable where it is not free . ” Mr. Sumner 's defence of democratic republican ideas ,— of the fitness of the European peoples for self-government ,— his repulse of those unbelieving theorists who would consign the French and the Italians to the eternal doom of oppression ,— are manly , powerful , and unanswerable . His hearty love of genuine democratic principles , as taught by the old republican school of statesmen and philosophers , and his zealous pride of country , which always made him one of the most intensely American , in thought , word , and deed , of all the Americans who have ever sojourned in the Old World , shine forth from every page of the Oration . And in the honest ardor of his defence of the natural and political rights of man , as they were taught by Turgot , by Montesquieu , by Jefferson , not content with declamation or rhetoric , he ploughs deep into the reasoning by which they were demonstrated or defended , and ranges wide over the fields of learning by which they were illustrated . Careful for nothing but for the truth itself , he refutes the errors of a French writer who had charged practical ingratitude on the part of America towards de Beaumarchais , the agent of the first benefactions of France to these Colonies , and arraigns and exposes the historical mistakes of Lord Brougham and of President Fillmore , unfavorable to Republican France and to Continental liberty . The crimes of Austria are shown to have been made possible by the moral support Austria has received from the government of England . The fruits of the reverses suffered by Hungary , and by other nationalities struggling for independence and popular liberty , are exhibited in the sacrifices since endured by England in the war in the Crimea , and in the embarrassments of the present hour . Among our own duties and responsibilities to the great and world-wide cause of liberty ,— discussed thus far in its relations to Europe ,— Mr. Sumner proceeds to present the grand duty we owe , not less to ourselves than to Europe , of giving to the struggling nations an example of government true to the memories of our National Anniversary , and to the fundamental ideas of civil freedom “ implied in an independent , but rigidly responsible judiciary , and a complete separation of the legislative and judicial functions . ” From Jefferson , Madison , Hamilton , Marshall , and Story ,— to say nothing of English and French jurists ,— Mr. Sumner brings authority to define and illustrate the true place of the judicial office in the political system of a free government . And here , fidelity to those principles of liberty he had explained and defended , fidelity to the “ good old cause ” itself , at home and in the grand forum of the nations , demanded and received the frank avowal , that “ a recent scene in the Supreme Court of the United States has shown that Jefferson was no false prophet , and has furnished at the same time a serious warning to all who prefer a government based upon law to either despotism or anarchy . ” The clear and sharp , merciless and logical veracity with which he discriminates between the solemn judgment of a tribunal and a stump speech from the bench ,— the startling narration of decisions and statutes , practice and precedent , condensed into a few of the closing pages of the Oration , with which the discussion read by Chief Justice Taney in the famous case of Dred Scott is confronted and exposed ,— are among the greater merits of this elaborate and able discourse . It must have required of one not in the arena of political strife , who for a large part of his manhood has occupied himself abroad in the studies of an intelligent scholar and a patriotic American , somewhat of self-denial , to throw away the certainty of almost universal cheers for his performance , by incurring the displeasure of some of his audience and many of his countrymen . It was not , however , in the interest of any opinion of African slavery that the case of Scott was here referred to . It was in the interest of republican liberty everywhere , endangered by all departures in the model republic of the world from fundamental principles of good government , and all the more perilled in proportion to the station , quality , and character of the active offender . And Mr. Sumner was right . The truth of history , the law of this land , and of all lands where there is any law which marks a boundary between legal right and despotic usurpation , unite to denounce , and will forever condemn , the judicial magistrate whose great name is tarnished and whose “ great office ” is degraded by this political pronunciamento , uttered from the loftiest judicial place in America . Stripped of verbiage and technicalities , the case is within the humblest comprehension . The chief justice and a majority of his associates held that Dred Scott , who sued his master for his freedom in the Federal court , had been already legally declared to be the slave of that same master by the highest court of the State of Missouri , in which State Scott resided at the time . They held that this decision of the Missouri court was binding on all other tribunals ; and that the Federal court had no authority to reverse it , even if wrong . The merits of the cause then before the court were thus conclusively disposed of , whether the decision be regarded as bearing on the main issue between the parties , or on the plea in abatement filed by the defendant , avowing that Scott was not a citizen of Missouri ,— an averment , if true , fatal to his standing in the Federal court ,— since its jurisdiction of the cause depended on the citizenship of the litigants . In a word , if he was a slave , he was no citizen , If he was the slave of Sanford , his doom was fixed , his dream of rights dissolved . If the decision of the Missouri court was finally binding , the functions of the Federal tribunal were at an end . What , then , was the pertinency of going on to argue the effect of the Ordinance of 1787 over Scott while a resident in Illinois , or of the Missouri Compromise on him during his residence in Wisconsin , or the effect of his color , race , or ancestral disabilities upon a cause controlled finally and beyond appeal by the authority of a decision already made and recorded ? Mr. Buchanan made hot haste to use this pronunciamento of his chief justice , issued only a few hours after his inauguration as President , and withheld until after the election of 1856 had taken place . He proclaimed — on its authority as a judicial exposition of a point of constitutional law — the existence of slavery in the Territory of Kansas . And he endeavored to make it efficient and powerful by practical application in the administration of the government of the Territory , and by interpolating these bastard dogmas , dropped from the Federal bench , into the creed of the political party of which he was the official chief . These dicta of Mr. Chief Justice Taney made Dred Scott neither more nor less a slave , neither more nor less a citizen , than he had been without their utterance . But they aided the purpose of subjugating Kansas , of opening all American territory to slavery , of Africanizing the continent by reopening the slave-trade , of breaking down barriers which State legislation has interposed against the introduction of slaves , and of putting the propagandists of slavery in full possession of every power . We gladly record our sense of the skill , learning , and intrepidity with which Mr. Sumner fulfilled his task of presenting , defining , and defending , within the brief limits of a single oration , the cause of Liberty ,— Liberty ,— American , European , universal . Out of the Depths . The Story of a Woman 's Life . London : Macmillan & Co. 8vo . pp . 381 . The author of this book is like an awkward angler , who fails to take a trout himself , and spoils the water for the more skilful man who may follow him . Its object is the illustration of that subject which has been called “ the greatest of our social evils , ” and which , in its present aspect , is certainly one of the saddest that the statesman or the moralist is called upon to contemplate , and yet one the duration of which seems to be inevitably coexistent with every form of civilized society yet known to the world . The author has sought his end by means of a fictitious autobiography . This was of course . No unusual faculty in the selection of methods was necessary to the choice ; for only in the autobiographical form could the inner life of a courtesan be so revealed as to present a truthful and living picture of her soul 's experience . A fine novel of this kind would be a great book , and one productive of much good ; not , indeed , directly to the wretched class that would furnish studies for it , but to society at large , and so indirectly to the class in question , by providing a subject of this kind which could be studied and talked about . Dumas fils ’ “ Dame aux Camelias ” is a great melodramatic story ; but it is so exceptional in its incidents and episodical in its character , that its heroine is quite worthless as a specimen for examination and analysis ; and it is , beside , so very French as to be almost valueless in this regard , for that reason alone . What it would be well to have written is the story of an abandoned woman , told simply and without any reserve , except that of decency , and purely from a woman 's point of view . But , except by a woman , and at the cost of the experience to be recounted , this is manifestly possible only to genius . The author of “ Out of the Depths ” has not attained the desideratum ; but has yet approached so near it , that we fear the right man , or , possibly , woman , may be deterred from the attempt to do better . If so , there is a good subject — good for the making of a grand psychological , physiological , and dramatic study — lost . The subject of this professed autobiography , Mary Smith , is the daughter of a gardener on a large English estate . Her family is much noticed and favored by the ladies of the mansion , and she , who is handsome and intellectual , soon acquires tastes and an education above her position ; and as she is vain and selfish and of a voluptuous temperament , the consequence seems inevitable . Her first fault , however , is committed with her betrothed husband , a young gentleman , destined for the Church , by whose sudden death , at a time when his life was more than ever essential to her happiness , she is left an outcast , a creature to be spurned from the door of those upon whose tender care Nature and themselves had given her unextinguishable claims . She finds shelter and kind treatment with two girls who belong , though not ostensibly , to the class into which she is about to fall , and soon she appears as the mistress of a foolish young nobleman , for whom she has not the least affection . At last he wearies of and parts with her , and she finds a second companion and protector in an eminent barrister , who takes pleasure in cultivating her literary tastes . Her unfaithfulness to him results in a separation , and she passes into the hands of a third keeper , who abandons her on occasion of his approaching marriage . Infuriated at his desertion , she intrudes upon him at a social party at his private chambers , and behaves so outrageously that she is handed over to the police , and her name appears in public as that of an infamous and disorderly woman . From this point she rapidly descends to the lowest rank of her unfortunate class . On her way , a strong hand is put out to save her . It is that of a gigantic young clergyman , who allows her to think that she has decoyed him to her room , but who really goes there to endeavor to turn her from her course of life . She scorns his exhortations , and attempts to browbeat him ; but she finds him ready for a row upon the spot . He offers to fight her crowd of bullies singlehanded , and when she locks the door upon him , twists the lock off , hasp and all , with a turn of his wrist . Although they part ,— he none the worse , she none the better , for the interview ,— it is not without fruits ; for he leaves her his address , and when , after being reduced to the lowest depths of degradation and brought to the last endurable pinch of suffering , she determines , at the death-bed of a repentant companion , to reform at any cost , and does set her face upward , and is beaten back and trodden under foot by the righteously uncharitable of her own sex , she thinks of her big clergyman , seeks him out , and by his instrumentality is taken into the country , and made the mistress of a school in his parish . Here the friends of her youth find her , forgive her , and cherish her ; and she receives a proposal of marriage from an estimable and wealthy farmer , who persists in his suit , even after she has told him of her former life , and after the small-pox , caught on a ministration of mercy , has harrowed all the beauty from her face . But rapid consumption supervenes , and relieves the author from the embarrassing position into which he had brought himself . This is all the story that Mary Smith has to tell ; and it will be seen , that , so far as the incidents are concerned , it is commonplace enough . It is not distinguished by one novel incident , or one fresh character , except , perhaps , the muscular divine . Even in the grouping and narration of its old incidents it exhibits no dramatic power , and little skill of characterization in the portraiture of its personages . And not only does a matter-of-fact air pervade the narrative , but the tale is told with such reticence of fact as well as of feeling , that it reveals but little of the real life of a London courtesan , and leaves the reader almost as ignorant as he was when he took up the book of what it is that makes the horror of such existence ; all of which might have been imparted without any violation of the decorum proper to such a book , and which , therefore , should not have been withheld . The book , too , is much too goody-goody . There is too much preaching throughout it , and in certain parts a suddenness in the kneeling down to pray that is quite startling . This stupid sort of goodness helps much to defeat the purpose of the work . Even the strong minister , although his is not the old-fashioned way , seems to have more beef on his bones than brains in his head , or he would not answer to a desperate exclamation of Mary Smith ,— “ Do n't say that . God only knows what is best for us all ; even you , and all like you , may begin to live for the good of society , without being its bane . ” This is very true ,— as true as Justice Shallow 's original observation , that “ we must all die . ” But the idea of attempting to impress a degraded woman of the town by telling her that she , and all like her , might be brought to live for the good of society ! But in spite of these faults , the book has one great merit , which is not too common ; it seems to be the truthful story of a real life . This impression is partly the result of a peculiarity of style which is very difficult to express otherwise than by saying that the use of language seems to indicate that the writer is of the condition of life in which Mary Smith professes to have been born , and has acquired a knowledge of language and literature in the manner in which she relates that she acquired hers . There is no vulgarity , but a certain air of constrained propriety , and an absence of any elegance , or grace , or indications of a slow and unconsciously acquired acquaintance with the phraseology of cultivated society . If this be really assumed , the author has exhibited a delicate refinement in the art of writing not surpassed in any work of imagination known to us . Another ground for the seeming actuality of the story , to those who have any knowledge of the class to which its heroine belongs , is the cause to which she attributes her fall . This was not seduction ; for she confesses , what hardly one in a thousand of her sisters in shame will fail to confess , if they speak the truth , that she was not seduced ;— and neither was it poverty ; for her father was well-to-do , and she the petted attendant , almost the friend , of a young lady of wealth and station ;— but it was her vanity and her unrestrained passion . She is represented , in the first place , as regarding a good match , a rich husband , as the great object of life ; and to such a woman chastity is not a sentiment , but a dictate of prudence ; just as to a man whose great purpose is the getting of money , honesty is but the best policy . After she has met the man who brings her fate with him , ( it might as well have been any other of his class ,) she writes ,— “ The one great pleasing and wretched hope of my mind was that I should see him again ; for it is so pleasant to believe that any man in a higher station should take an interest in me . ” And again she speaks of “ exultation at the prospect which opened before me of being raised out of the station in life from which I sprang by birth ” ; and again , of her “ desire of being a lady . ” This vanity it is , this desire to dress and live like the women above them , and have intercourse with the men above them , which leads the greater number of our fallen women to their ruin , or , rather , sends them to it with their eyes open ; and for the rest , when Mary Smith , living in her own fine house , the petted mistress of the wealthy Mr. Plowden , was unfaithful to him , it was not for love of fine clothes or fine society . It is not long since our whole country was shocked by the dire results of a similar abandonment to vanity and wantonness , about which the usual amount of commonplace and cant was uttered . It is time that the very truth was told about this matter , in sad earnestness and singleness of purpose . We hoped to find the whole truth in “ Out of the Depths ” ; but , finding only a part of it , we can greet it only with a partial welcome . Reply to the “ Statement of the Trustees ” of the Dudley Observatory . By BENJAMIN APTHORP GOULD , JR. Albany : Printed by Charles Van Benthuysen . 1859 . 8vo . pp . 366 . The question between Dr. Gould and the Trustees of the Albany Observatory was not one of merely private or passing interest . It concerned not only all men of science , but all men of honor . It concerned all who like pluck , and who , in a quarrel , instinctively take sides with one against many . It was of interest to men of science , because the question was between show and reality , between newspaper notoriety and the quiet advancement of real and enduring knowledge . It concerned men of honor , because it was of some consequence to know whether public sentiment in America would justify , nay , tolerate even , the printing of confidential letters , and not only the printing , but the garbling of them to suit the ends of personal spite . It concerned lovers of fair-play , because it was to be settled whether it is right to accuse a man of peculation whom you wish to convict of disagreeable manners . Dr. Gould 's pamphlet is a thorough vindication of himself . It is so not only as to graver charges , but incidentally , by its perfect quietness of tone , it answers the accusation of bad temper . The hitting is none the less severe that it is done with scientific precision , and the astronomer shows his ability to make his antagonists “ see stars ” in a less comfortable way than through a telescope . There is a grim humor , too , as well as dignity , in the Cool way in which Dr. Gould recapitulates all the charges made against him ,— especially where he condenses them in the Index . Better pamphlet-fighting has not been seen since Bentley . The hardship of the matter is , that people are commonly more ready to believe slander than to trouble themselves with reading a refutation of it . It gave us particular satisfaction to see that the American Association for the Advancement of Science had shown its sense of the merits of the quarrel by electing Dr. Gould vice-president of their body .
