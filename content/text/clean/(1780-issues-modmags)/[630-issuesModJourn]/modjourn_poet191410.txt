I  OCTOBER 1914  SONGS OF THE COAST DWELLERS  THE CHIEF S PRAYER AFTER THE SALMON CATCH  O KIA KUNAE praise Thou hast opened thy hand among the stars And sprinkled the sea with food The catch is great thy children will live See on the roofs of the villages the red meat  drying Another year thou hast encompassed us with life Praise Praise Kunae O Father we have waited with shut mouths With hearts silent and hands quiet Waited the time of prayer Lest with fears we should beset thee And pray the unholy prayer of asking We waited silently and thou gavest life  Oh praise Praise Praise Open the silent mouths the shut hearts my tribe   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Sing high the prayer of Thanksgiving The prayer He taught in the beginning to the Kwakiutl The good rejoicing prayer of thanks As the sea sings on the wet shore when the ice thunders  back And the blue water floats again warm shining living So break thy ice bound heart and the cold lip s silence Praise Kunae for life as wings up flying as eagles to the sun Praise Praise Praise  SONG OF THE SEARCH  descend through the forest alone Rose flushed are the willows stark and a quiver In the warm sudden grasp of Spring Like a woman when her lover has suddenly swiftly taken  her I hear the secret rustle of the little leaves Waiting to be born The air is a wind of love From the wings of eagles mating O eagles my sky is dark with your wings The hills and the waters pity me The pine trees reproach me The little moss whispers under my feet Son of Earth Brother Why comest thou hither alone   Song of the Search  Oh the wolf has his mate on the mountain Where art thou Spring daughter I tremble with love as the reeds by the river I burn as the dusk in the red tented west I call thee aloud as the deer calls the doe I await thee as hills wait the morning I desire thee as eagles the storm I yearn to thy breast as night to the sea I claim thee as the silence claims the stars  O Earth Earth great Earth  Mate of God and mother of me Say where is she the Bearer of Morning  My Bringer of Song Love in me waits to be born Where is She the Woman  SONG OF THE CONQUEROR OF WOMEN  I am Mo an mat ma the Dandy My tribesmen jealous call me Many Faces But the name over my house door Is Conqueror of Women The Moon Woman s finger wrote it there I am as that red deer of stars In the night s skyey forest Ever pursued by the tossing foam of maidens love Froth from the mouths of hunting wolves Ak and some that be not maidens   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  My blind eyed kinsmen look to the little straying feet Of such and this and that um m m m Look to it They follow me As the twinkling foam track of hungry stars Endlessly trails after him the antlered one the Red Star But takes him never Aik Ki yi y  1 am the Conqueror of Women My grass cap is set round with red breasts of red breasted  woodpeckers My hair is sleek black long bead twined It flashes like the watered fins of Auch Willo Striking through the sea in the sun It is priceless as the fur of seals It is heaven blossomed like Yethel s wing I am tall tall tall and proud Proud proud proud and strong Strong strong strong like Like all the men of the Haidas Like all save me who am tallest proudest strongest My moccasins are of white doe skin much embroidered Five little rows of smallest white owl feathers Go round and round  The star signs the love signs worked in colored grasses O my kinsman O No al es would you wed with Ho g tonight If you knew oh la la who worked my moccasins   Song of the Conqueror of Women  I am the Conqueror of Women My body is swiftly strong as the storm in spring And beautifully large as the pale gold sand beneath the moon I am long limbed and thewed like the cliff And curved in mighty curves like the shore about the sea My voice in love making is as birds warring It is as sea gulls shrieking in the ears of women In anger ai k how terrible in anger is my voice It splits the hearts of women like Yethel pecking clam shells Ai They follow follow my bright moccasins Through the crooked trails of the woods They break my hunting scent they scare my fishes Ak ak ak love seekers husband snatchers Foolish foolish and unwise you dance after a ghost I am Many Faces the Dandy I wed none I wed none I miss none I lose none I am the Conqueror of Women  SONG OF THE FULL CATCH  Here s good wind here s sweet wind Here s good wind and my woman calls me Straight she stands there by the pine tree Faithful waits she by the cedar She will smile and reach her hands When she sees my thousand salmon Here s good wind and my woman calls me   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Here s clear water here s swift water Here s bright water and my woman waits me She will call me from the sea s mouth Sweet her pine bed when the morning Lights my canoe and the river ends Here s good wind here s swift water Strong as love when my woman calls me  THE CHANGE SONG  Death s first snows are drifting on my cheek Pale are my lips As the kiss of Cin Uza I lie low and still Near me crouch my silent kinsmen They hold the breath and wait the hour of wailing They have wrapped the scarlet mourning blanket Round the shoulders of the oldest man He has taken their sorrow He droops at my door Like a bleeding hawk where the eagles have battled He is so old he feels not any grief His heart is cold In his ears no sound is And in his eyes no light Therefore have my kinsmen given him their griefs Because the dawn leaps clear into their eyes Because the sound of women s feet   The Change Song  Rustling on the cedar mats when the torch is blown Calls sweetly to their ears And their hearts are beating for the hunt They may not bear the sorrow of my passing We have known strong joys together  I take your loves my kinsmen I leave with you no griefs Sing my kinsmen when ye swing me To the topmost branches of the cedar Sweet smelling arms of cedar reach for me Tenderly receive me Hold me in the Last Caress under open sky Sing my kinsmen when the oldest man Takes his lone trail through the forest He will wear no mourning blanket when he comes again  tomorrow He will say Rejoice I have borne your grief afar I have buried it deep The place is not known The wind of your singing shall rock me In the arms of my mother the cedar Yet there is a sweeter song my kinsmen It is the Change Song of Supreme One I hear it now He chants it to my heart Because pale death has crossed my threshold and has clasped  my hand   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Fear not sings Supreme One I am making pure making pure I destroy not life I am Life maker  The oldest man has entered the forest Ah Ah my kinsmen are wailing They saw me depart with Death Into the White Change But I go on and on And I sing the Change Song of Supreme One  Ha k eohos la no ya ai

the Chief Ki Ki Ki y When I stamp my mighty little foot my mother weeps She fears me she trembles Also old Bi iq my grandmother The earth trembles the sea shakes My little foot stamping rocks all the canoes of the world The clouds like screaming windy birds Fly fly before my little willow bow The eagles screech leaping to the pine tops   Song of the Little Son  When they see me fit my sparkling red feathered little arrow T o my gleaming bowstring Running on the beach above the glistening bay For sport I shake my tall little spear Ok Ki see the great shadows on the sea Kok wats Tyee old Salmon Chief Beckons with his tail all other fishes And dives to the bottom of the world He fears me Ki Ki Ki y  Tlet la the fisher calls from his big canoe Where my father s twenty tribesmen paddle O Leqa a to q Little Son we pray thee No longer shake thy frighting spear If thou scare all the salmon from the sea How shall we eat dried fish when winter dances Thy tribe will die Ai the sweet smoked fish I hide my spear Once more the sea is full of salmon Swimming to the fishers nets I run among the berry bushes Crying my fierce Ki Ki y And laugh to see the wild wolves fleeing  See Me I jump the highest log Ki Ki Ki y My stuck out little fingers pierced the sky Leqa a to q Who calls Ho tis but my trembling mother   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  When the beach crawled longly down To the low sea at morn With my sharp hunting little knife  I killed the fat Father of the Clams  Leqa a a to q  Ho ai ai Angrily she calls  me Farewell slaves I hear the loud voice of the Great Chief s Great Woman  calling The high voice of the Great Chief s great Little Son s great Mother  Leqa a a to q co omes See Me Grinding flashing my long white many fierce little teeth I run I run I run Ki Ki Ki y To eat my big little supper  SONG OF WHIP PLAITING  In the dawn I gathered cedar boughs For the plaiting of thy whip They were wet with sweet drops They still thought of the night  All alone I shredded cedar boughs Green boughs in the pale light Where the morning meets the sea And the great mountain stops   Song of Whip Plaiting  Earth was very still  I heard no sound but the whisper of my knife My black flint knife It whispered among the white strands of the cedar Whispered in parting the sweet cords for thy whip O sweet smelling juice of cedar Life ooze of love My knife drips Its whisper is the only sound in all the world  Finer than young sea lions hairs Are my cedar strands They are fine as little roots deep down O little roots of cedar Far far under the bosom of Tsa Kumts They have plaited her through with love Now into my love gift Closely strongly I will weave them Little strands of pain Since I saw thee Standing with thy torch in my doorway Their little roots are deep in me  In the dawn I gathered cedar boughs Sweet sweet was their odor They were wet with tears The sweetness will not leave my hands No not in salt sea washings   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Tears will not wash away sweetness I shall have sweet hands for thy service  Ah sometimes thou will be gentle Little roots of pain are deep deep in me Since I saw thee standing in my doorway  I have quenched thy torch I have plaited thy whip I am thy Woman  SONG OF THE YOUNG MOTHER  M m m m n N n n n m Ai i he i ah o he a i ne Swing my chiefiing fragrantly On the cedar branch Cedar Cedar tenderly Sway to the singing wind Bright flying Wind with song in thy white throat And light in thy wide sea eyes The sky s blue feathers on thy wing Oh blow blow gently softly Wind Rock my chiefiing Wind In his little woven cradle  When thou wast still a seedling Deep in mine earth months deep   Song of the Young Mother  I sat in thy father s doorway making thy cradle At the first light eager I rose to the weaving In the dusk my fingers still threaded Needing no light I remember my mother sat near me often watching Sometimes weeping Yes she wept Yet answered not when I asked wherefor In the night thou hast waked me at his side Dancing in thy dark house to the doors that soon must open On thy white shining dawn shores of life And I have seen the Moon Woman s round face Laughing through the smoke hole mocking Pointing to thy empty cradle hanging Ai but her smile grew kind She said Wait a little longer impatient one When next my round face peeps through the smoke hole I will seek him at your breast Ai i hi Very precious is the man child Ere it is born a woman loves it How cam st thou here little Chiefling A woman gave thee life  Yes my mother wept watching me weave for thee And I have wept too a little  Strange that pain came with love I knew it not until thy father sought me Yet what woman would cast love out   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Gladly in the dusk I waited him None told me not my mother even of the pang So my heart joyous sounded a song of drums Beating the loud wild march for his swift trampling feet The breasts of love were as the eaves of a house Jutting through the red mists and the dusk of ending day Calling the hunter to enter to his rest The door trembled with strange winds He circled my house with the arms of strength  And took me with weapons Joy Ay Yet I cried from the depths with a sudden deep cry And in grieving earth was the torch quenched   Darkness and his his utterly in that dark None had told me  Nor that his strength would leap rejoicing at my cry  At dawn it is our custom I went forth alone Into the mists that wrap the sleeping cedars And droop to the pale unwakened sea Alone on the dawn s white rim I gathered cedar boughs My tears fell shining among the earth s bright drops For now I knew Why the maiden plaits a whip of cedar fibre To give into her husband s hand on her marriage day Once I asked my father it seemed so strange A maid should weave and weave a rod for her own sorrow He laughed and said It is our custom ay an old custom I know not if it means aught now   Song of the Young Mother  Or ever did have meaning My mother sat near Ay I have remembered that she spoke not But silently in the shadow of his body drooped her head  Ay tis old the custom Old as earth is old Ancient as passion Pitiless as passion Ay pitiless pitiless the earth way for women Bitter it is as the taste of bright sea water That he who takes the gift and wields our weaving of  desire Knows not the meaning of the gift nor can know ever Into the heedless hand of passion We yield our power of pain  It is the law of the earth way  So it is with birth giving Aii he the mightier pang The mightier loving And thou and thy father the two Strong Ones Glad glad of the woman s pain cry  M m m m n Ai i he i Sleepest thou little Fading Ay thou didst long drink at my breast But hast not drained it of love   POETRY A Magazine of V erse  Cedar Cedar carefully Guard my little brown cone On thy earth bending branch M m m m n A i i he i Little life bud on the bough Sleep sleep thou drowsy one Thou art guarded well  Ay rock rock safely safely little Man Child A woman watches thee  NO ANSWER IS GIVEN  I am Ah woa te the Hunter  I met a maiden in the shadow of the rocks Her eyes were strange and clear Her fair lips were shaped like the bow of dawning I asked her name Striking my spear in the deep earth for resting  I am Kantlak a maiden named for the Morning On the mountain top I heard two eagles talking The word was Love They cried it beating their wings on each other Until they bled and she fell Yet falling still weakly cried it To him soaring and died I came to a mossy low valley of flowers   No Answer is Given  There I saw Men iak the white grouse White with chaste dreams like the Spring Moon fairer  than flowers Through the forest a dark bird swooped with fierce eyes And Men iak flew down to it Her white breast is red dyed she lies on the moss Yet faintly cries the same strange word Hunter will you come to my little fire and tell me What Love is  I could not see the maiden s face clearly for the dusk Where she sat by her small fire only her eyes In the little flicker I saw her feet they were bare Tireless slim brown feet I saw how fair her lips were I drew nearer to cast my log on the fire I said Maiden I am the Hunter When dusk ends the chase I leave the Mighty Killing Far or near where gleams some little fire I grope through the forest with my heavy log Till I find one by the fire sitting alone without fuel I cast my log gladly into the fire thus It grips the flames mount the warmth embraces  Almost I can see your face Woman The bow of your fair lips is hot with speeded arrows Your strange clear eyes have darkened Fear not our fire will outlast the dark   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Hunter what of the cold on the bleak hillside When the log burns gray and the fire is ashes I replied I have never seen this When the fire burns low I am asleep She said What of me if I sleep not and see the ashes I yawned I said I know not I wake in the sun and go forth  The bow of her lips was like the moon s cold circle She said Hunter you have told me of Love It may be so I answered I wished to sleep She said Already it is ashes I looked and saw that her face was gray As if the wind had blown the ashes over it I was angry I said Better you had slept She said Yes but I lie bleeding on the moss Crying this word  I answered This is so but wherefore and asked idly Wherefore remember him who brought to your lone little  fire The log that now is ashes She shivered in the cold dawn I saw that her eyes were darker than shadows Her fair mouth was like my perfect bow But I could fit no more arrows to it  She said Hunter see how gray are these rocks Where we have sheltered our brief night   No Answer is Given  I looked they were ashen She said See how they come together here and here As the knees the breast the great brow the forgotten eyes Of a woman Sitting waiting stark and still And always gray Though hunters camp each night between her knees And little fires are kindled and burned out in her hollows It was so the mountain was a stone woman sitting Kantlak said She remembers him who turned her fire to  ashes She waits to know the meaning of her waiting Why the love that wounded her can never be cast out  I asked idly Who will tell her And laughed for the sun was up I reached for my arrows I drew my strong spear from the deep earth by her feet Kantlak looked up to the other gray face and said No answer is given Down to the cold white endless sea shore Slowly she went with bend head A young deer cast its leaping shadow on the pool I ran upon the bright path swaying my spear  Constance Lindsay Skinner   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  IN TH E LABORATORY  So you have lost your keen Italian craft You sir with the pale blue steady eyes The restless liquids changing in a wink The elemental catch and cling the flames The quiet cultures hatching hour by hour All these are not the secret Kiss of Death You do not follow me It s just as well I only muse on fashions of your trade For you the present mode s enough for you The rose red liquor of the Borgia s feast The ointment on the blade at Elsinore The cobra touch of the Byzantine ring Crude things they seem I take it in your eyes And yet they had their midnight will of life  But you have lost the pose the furtive air That devilish old theatric charlatan Had much the better of you sir in style This same clear glass he used it for a gaze That hoped to glimpse the cloudy shape of Fate You spread a drop upon a slide stain it Some hue that pierces evil things alone Magic in that A little if you like And balance in its groove this paltry drop The light gleams through it to the lens above No I can t look sir It s my life you know   In the Laboratory  Give me a moment Let me prattle on What s this And this Grave issues every one This tells you if a beam of ribboned steel Will hold some daring tower against the sky These tubes the milk tests ah the little lives That hang in peril till you mark them safe And this a matter of your own research You are still curious A mere chance you think I understand Into the springs of life The primal secrets and the hidden wells You peer when trade is dull You tear apart The final atoms in their whirling dance And trust they may not find their way again The mind of God is swift And so is Death  No sir not yet The first look must be mine How should it stand If the round discs are clear Fair winds and hope and lengthening days you say Good Fear sir is a grisly thing to feel If they be tinged with violet then the plague The pale slow plague is rotting out my life Suppose I dash the thing aside and slay The messenger of evil ere he speak No no a moment more That was my Fear Who sometimes cries before I crush him down Now I will know The violet shade you say Is the death sign the white is innocent Well now the hoary wings of doom are poised   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Above me and I feel their fluttering Tomorrow and the fostering sun the flowers The kisses and the songs the green spring roads And all my soul s new fortunes and desires Tremble across this disc of light Ah God Some brandy Sweet Life The glass is clear  Thomas Wood Stevens   TO J L  Often within the house where we have met You are an aching presence and a pain The cruel obsession of a tortured brain With only you and loss of you beset Each room where you have moved is a regret In every spot some self of you is slain And Oh I question must he die again And die a thousand deaths till I forget  But when I plunge into the moving street Into the vital sunlight and keen air When face to face and life to life I meet My living brothers all the old despair Falls from me in the faces that I greet And in the quickened heart throbs you are there  A GIRL STRIKE LEADER  A white faced stubborn little thing Whose years are not quite twenty years Eyes steely now and done with tears Mouth scornful of its suffering   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  The young mouth body virginal Beneath the cheap ill fitting suit A bearing quaintly resolute A flowering hat satirical  A soul that steps to the sound of the fife And banners waving red to war Mystical knowing scarce wherefore A Joan in a modern strife  CITY OF HUGE BUILDINGS  City of huge buildings into which men have poured their souls City of innumerable schools where little children are taught and cared for City of the great University discussing solemn and learned questions City of well dressed beautiful women sleek satisfied sure  of their clothes and of themselves And their husbands sleek and satisfied also I a common prostitute in the wan morning buying cocaine Ask you the meaning of it all  Florence Kiper Frank   ON THE JAIL STEPS  I ve won the race Young man I m new  Old Sallow face Good luck to you  I ve turned about And paid for sin And you come out As I go in  Ten years but mark I am free free  Ten years of dark Shall gather me  My wife long while She wept her pain  She cannot smile She weeps again  My little one Shall know my call  Child is there none For sin grows tall  Now who are you Spar of hell s flood  And who and who But your own blood   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  A STATUE IN A GARDEN  I was a goddess ere the marble found me Wind wind delay not Waft my spirit where the laurel crowned me Will the wind stay not  Then tarry tarry listen little swallow An old glory feeds me I lay upon the bosom of Apollo Not a bird heeds me  For here the days are alien Oh to waken Mine mine with calling But on my shoulders bare like hopes forsaken The dead leaves are falling  The sky is gray and full of unshed weeping As dim down the garden I wait and watch the early autumn sweeping The stalks fade and harden  The souls of all the flowers afar have rallied The trees gaunt appalling Attest the gloom and on my shoulders pallid The dead leaves are falling  Agnes Lee   RETROSPECT  In your arms was still delight Quiet as a street at night And thoughts of you I do remember Were green leaves in a darkened chamber Were dark clouds in a moonless sky Love in you went passing by Penetrative remote and rare Like a bird in the wide air And as the bird it left no trace In the heaven of your face In your stupidity I found The sweet hush after a sweet sound All about you was the light That dims the graying end of night  Desire was the unrisen sun Joy the day not yet begun With tree whispering to tree Without wind quietly Wisdom slept within your hair And Long Suffering was there And in the flowing of your dress Undiscerning Tenderness And when you thought it seemed to me Infinitely and like a sea About the slight world you had known Your vast unconsciousness was thrown    POETRY A Magazine of Verse  O haven without wave or tide Silence in which all songs have died Holy book where hearts are still And home at length under the hill O mother quiet breasts of peace Where love itself would faint and cease O infinite deep I never knew I would come back come back to you Find you as a pool unstirred Kneel down by you and never a word Lay my head and nothing said In your hands ungarlanded And a long watch you would keep And I should sleep and I should sleep  Rupert Brooke  COMMENTS AND REVIEWS  THE AUDIENCE I HAVE protested in private and I now protest more openly against the motto upon the cover of POETRY The artist is not dependent upon his audience This sentence is Whitman tired You have only to compare Whitman to my mutton headed ninth cousin or to any other American of his time who had the great audience to see the difference of result And for all that Whitman was not such a poet as Dante who never gave way and from whom we have the tradition of an answer more becoming to genius Quem stulti magis odissent When they asked him who was wisest in the city he answered He whom the fools hate worst The artist is not dependent upon the multitude of his listeners Humanity is the rich effluvium it is the waste and the manure and the soil and from it grows the tree of the arts As the plant germ seizes upon the noble particles of the earth upon the light seeking and the intrepid so does the artist seize upon those souls which do not fear transfusion and transmutation which dare become the body of the god I ask you had Synge an audience in his life time He was hounded or despised by a half educated Zoroastrian rabble of respectable people more stupid and sodden than is to be found even in America He had a scant handful   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  of friends Had Dante the popular voice He had his youthful companionship with Guido and correspondence with a man from Pistoja and with the latinist De Virgilio  Must we restrict this question to poets I ask the efficient man in any department of life Can we have no great inventors without a great audience for inventors Had Curie a great audience Had Ehrlich for his bacilli Can we have no great financier without a great audience Had the savior of the world a great audience Did he work on the magazine public  Is there any use carrying it further Did not the disciples of Confucius beg him to do something popular Have we not his imperturbable answer So you wish me to become famous shall I take up archery or charioteering I shall take up charioteering  It is true that the great artist has in the end always his audience for the Lord of the universe sends into this world in each generation a few intelligent spirits and these ultimately manage the rest But this rest this rabble this multitude does not create the great artist They are aimless and drifing without him They dare not inspect their own souls  It is true that the great artist has always a great audience even in his life time but it is not the vulgo but the spirits of irony and of destiny and of humor sitting within him Ezra Pound   The Audience  II  Controversy is good for the soul and the magazine which expresses but one opinion is doomed  Of course as Mr Pound says there is a sense in which a great audience may be a very small one That wa6 hardly Whitman s meaning however nor is it the hint we intend to convey by our motto Modern inventions forcing international travel inter racial thought upon the world have done away with Dante s little audience with his contempt for the crowd a contempt which however disregarded the fact that his epic like all the greatest art was based upon the whole life of his time the common thought and feeling of all the people No small group today can suffice for the poet s immediate audience as such groups did in the stay at home aristocratic ages and the greatest danger which besets modern art is that of slighting the great audience whose response alone can give it authority and volume and of magnifying the importance of a coterie  In an essay on The Bigness of the World Atlantic Monthly September 1911 I discussed this question of the poet and his audience at greater length than POETRY has space for The concluding paragraphs were  Great art the highest art comes only when profound energy of creation meets profound energy of sympathy The leader must have his army behind him the vates must hear an outcry of passion and understanding from all his world Of old when the poet spoke for a few the response of the few was enough Today when he must speak for the many the many must hear him must not only hear but understand him in their profoundest secret instincts of sympathy or rebellion else he can not utter   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  the truth that is in him and modern democracy must go uninspired  Thus we shall hardly have our votes until our huge heterogeneous crowd becomes as aware of the spirit as it is today of the flesh as keen for truth and beauty as it is today for comfort The inventors have had their world behind them modern democracy is still giving them its commands Science takes no step forward that the man in the street does not know he thrills over X rays and radium he is eager to test the mono rail he jokes about the inhabitants of Mars In this direction lies increase of comfort and knowledge here the creative energy of our age meets equal energy of sympathy and each day records a new miracle And all these are glorious deeds necessary to the making of a larger world We live in a great age but a greater age must come  Already there are many signs of an awakening of spiritual consciousness in the crowd confused and scattered signs of far blown sympathies exaltations ideals Democracy is becoming awake and aware is discovering a deeper need than the need of food and raiment At present this instinct is vague and formless voiced in dim and clouded questionings almost world wide political doubt spiritual unrest The new democracy must grope and wander lingering among vast uncharted uncertainties It must search long for its poet prophet who shall sing the old era away and usher in the new And when he comes he must be of spiritual stature great enough to stand fitly on mountain tops and speak for a world more vast than man has ever known  Art is not an isolated phenomenon of genius but the expression of a reciprocal relation between the artist and his public Like perfect love it can be supreme only when the relation is complete There is a magic in it beyond the reach of reason a magic which Whitman felt when he wrote the sentence printed on our cover Science is explaining more and more the reactions and relations of matter of life It  becomes increasingly clear that nothing can stand alone genius least of all H M Comments and Reviews  NATIONALISM IN ART  American and English critics do love to talk about American art They tell us just what it ought to be about and how it should be presented They are constantly on the qui vive to detect foreign ideas and alien interests and even if forced to admit good work in something possessing these baneful qualities they are sure to heave a sigh and deplore the fact that it is un American  It would seem that the only thing to cure critics of this attitude would be a course in psychology It is not so surprising that English critics ignorant of our civilization and of the vastness of our country and its many and various intellectual reactions should erect a spurious ideal of what literature here should be But that our own critics should persist in demanding a narrow and purely surface Americanism is more astonishing  To their minds Americanism would seem to consist of a mixture of trade unionism slums neither of which phenomena it may be remarked is peculiar to this country polyethnic factories and limitless prairies peopled by heroic cow boys This would appear to be a rather narrow range in which to confine the art of a great nation For we are a great nation and that supremely interesting thing a nation in the making Is our lack of a correspondingly great art due to our youth or to other and more artificial causes  T o all people who find art a worthy preoccupation and endeavor this question is one of paramount interest What can we do to get ourselves worthily down on canvas or   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  paper How can we produce that concourse of great artists which the critics are always fuming at us for not possessing How angry they would be if we suggested that they were one of the obstacles which stand in the way that this constant talk and urging on the subject of Americanism was one of the surest ways not to get it W e have gone daft in this country on the social we speak of people as though their only value were in the aggregate W e pounce upon individualism with jeers and sneers and misunderstanding Universal suffrage works as badly in the domain of the arts as it does in Wall Street In fact it undoubtedly works worse For there are many more able business men than there are able artists so the public may very well be supposed to have an apter judgment in business affairs than in letters Not that the public is not a good judge of results The man in the street can see the difference between a great financier and the keeper of the corner grocery And great artists attain their rank through universal though not always popular opinion Certainly the public sees results but the public is not a very good judge of how results are to be come by  Art is a thing of the individual It is all very well to group by gone artists into schools for class room convenience It amuses a certain type of mind to fasten tags upon living men It interests readers and stimulates their curiosity to line artists up in opposing factions like the two sides of a base ball game But these are purely exterior phenomena and leave the profound individuality of the artist untouched So shy and unaccountable is the creative impulse that it has   Nationalism in Art  so far defied the researches of psychologists It depends upon a number of physical and mental phenomena worked upon by environment And it is this subtle elusive and awe inspiring thing which the critics are so anxious to push here and there  A nation is its character just as a man is Personality is made up of all sorts of traits and habits cross sectioning and inhibiting each other It is in its essence in the kind of character a man has that his national character comes out It is stupid and impertinent to be forever telling a man to try and be someone else The American artist must first of all be encouraged to be himself and by being himself openly and fearlessly he will also be entirely American In fact he could not help it if he would W e are a nation with marked characteristics there is no lack of national flavor about us That we do not get it into our literature is because of another national trait we are conventional hopelessly timidly so All the intellectual revolts and movements come from abroad But and here is the point American artists living abroad are usually in the van of such movements Whistler led one of the most important artistic reforms of our time and one of the best known of the French symbolists is Stuart Merrill an American No we are not stupid and not incapable of the seething intellectual force which makes for change but here at home we live in an atmosphere of stuffy monotony and the critics who should be our teachers and helpers are forever asking us to mold ourselves on one pattern   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  No other country has treated its artists so Other countries have realized that in the richness and manysidedness of artistic achievement lies the greatness of national artistic life  Musicians speak of the attack with which a singer takes a note National character is shown in this quality of attack the way an artist takes a subject the fluid play of his personality about it Let us show a little more trust in our artists let us believe that they know what is good for themselves better than we do And when an American artist with all the force and vitality of his go ahead American nature braves the scorn of the critics and lays a beautiful pomegranate before us let us not weep or scold because it is not a rice pudding  Poe and Walt Whitman share the honor of being America s greatest poets And what a difference How unlike are the subjects which inspired them and how utterly unlike their forms of attack But it is quite obvious to the most casual reader that neither of them could have come out of any country except America It is the fashion to call Poe an exotic Why Because there has only been one of him Could he have been an Englishman a Frenchman a German Clearly he has none of the national traits of these or any other foreign countries It must be then because he is a genius that we fail to see the American in him Is it not a little sad that genius is so rare with us that when it appears we dub it exotic  No what the American artist needs to be told is to be himself And to spare no study to present that self as it   Nationalism in Art  really is If a poet chooses the ancient Aztec civilization as the background for a poem it may be as purely American a production as though he had laid his scene in the lower East Side of New York at the present day If he chooses to people the Kentucky woods with fairies who are we to bar out the fine play of his imagination as alien to our national temper And is it not a little ludicrous perhaps pathetic to have a reviewer upbraid him because he has not chosen to write about the laborers on the adjacent farms What reviewers of that type do not understand is that neither poet nor painter chooses his subject It is the subject which chooses him he can no more help his preferences and inspirations than he can help the shape of his head  These unscientifically trained reviewers seem to think  that a man decides what is to ignite his creative impulse as  wilfully and calmly as he would choose a number at a  roulette table and the subject taken they speak as though  the rest were chance A profound ignorance of psychic laws  is responsible for these ideas The fact would seem to be  just the reverse An artist cannot choose his number but  he can learn to spin his wheel We are afraid to go to  school lest we cease to be ourselves A strong man gains  an added sense of power by everything he learns Every  great artist has spent a life of laborious learning He has  mastered his technique with infinite pains and by so doing  has been able to fling his personality unimpeded before the  world The only motto for a serious artist is WORK  Instead of begging us to be what we are not the critics   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  should urge us to be more fully what we are Only so will they hasten the day when America will have the great artists for which she clamors Amy Lowell  REVIEWS  Des Imagistes An Anthology The Glebe A amp C Boni  Imagism is essentially a graphic art and like the finest etching print or wood cut depends upon a highly cultivated state of appreciation in the observer It is not an art of the naive or unsophisticated A great many of the classical poems of the Japanese are also graphic in the sense in which I use it here Their poems exist independently it is true of the pictures that they were designed to accompany or that were made in their turn to complete the text of the poet but the spirit of the poem was based upon this dual appreciation In other words it was based upon a mental image to which more than one sense or more than one art sense was contributory The fact that poet and painter played into each other s hands so to speak was due to a more general culture in art than many of us in the west possess and it was due also to the non imitative quality of the respective arts Perhaps this is one reason why the visual element which plays an important part in the poems in this volume is not likely to find ready appreciation or understanding  An Image Mr Pound says is that which presents an intellectual and emotional complex in an instant of time   Reviews  The moon rose full and the women stood as though around  an altar Sappho How shall I find the white flower That resembles the hoar frost When I think I have come upon it It is only a flake of white crystal That melts in my fingers  From the Japanese  In several brief poems by Mr Pound in this anthology the Image would not exist without this contributory sense of delicate vision  Be in me as the eternal moods of the bleak wind and not As transient things are gaiety of flowers Have me in the strong loneliness of sunless cliffs And of gray waters Let the gods speak softly of us In days hereafter The shadowy flowers of Orcus Remember Thee  O fan of white silk  clear as frost on the grass blade You also are laid aside The petals fall in the fountain  the orange colored rose leaves Their ochre clings to the stone  Mr Aldington also gives a delightful visual impression in Au Vieux Jardin which one New York reviewer frankly finds ridiculous no doubt because a delicate combination of color could never set him nigh to weeping And the same reviewer objects to the delicate artificiality the delicate antiquity the delicate futility of the imagist poems But   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  there are hands of otherwise very worthy people to which one would not confide the delicate artificiality the delicate antiquity the delicate futility of an Etruscan vase  But the Etruscan vase was not futile but useful the reviewer would probably object Yes but would not the most vulgar manufactured china jug serve as well he might be answered The futility after all is in the impossibility of imposing a selective choice on the naturally unselective  Modernity moreover is not objective not a matter of time and place A sparrow hopping on the lawn in London appeals to this reviewer but substitute Athens for London and his sense of modernity would be outraged  There is much individual variety in the expression of the eleven poets represented in this anthology but all the poems are more or less bound together by certain tendencies which it is unnecessary to indicate here as the principles of Imagism have been set forth at some length in this magazine and about three fourths of the poems included were first published in POETRY The collection of the poems in a single volume is valuable as affording a concentrative expression of the group and an appended bibliography increases its value for the collector A C H   Reviews  Sonnets From The Patagonian by Donald Evans Marie Claire  Saloon Sonnets With Sunday Flittings by Allen Norton  Marie Claire  There are signs of a late grafting of the spirit of the eighteen nineties upon certain young poets of the United States Of course we have had earlier and more authentic indications of that spirit in poets whose work is based upon the artistic methods of the nineties but the grafting of which I speak represents rather a tendency to imitate only that phase of the cult whose literary trademark is the sophistication of wickedness  Curiously enough this phase seems to have fastened itself particularly upon New York Philadelphia and St Louis Chicago with the exception of a few cases transferred to Greenwich Village seems to have escaped this light attack of the measles I was told lately of an argumentative contest between two young poets each of whom desired to prove that he was wickeder than the other T o a remark that the out worn very much passé desire to épater les bourgeois was no doubt at the root of the matter a friend responded that these young men did not indeed care so much to shock others as to shock themselves and the remarkable fact was that they succeeded so well  Not a little of this foolish and rather wasteful child s play in combination with certain post impressionist leanings is found in the two volumes of poems by Mr Donald Evans and Mr Allen Norton   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Mr Evans has a decided gift for unique and memorable phrasing derived from a concise perception of the complexity of a mood Many of these phrases occur in poems that have been quoted by reviewers for the sake of the supposed jolt they would give the public but there are other poems less obvious in intention and more subtle and there is much natural vigor in his work Rhythmically his sonnets are rather monotonous Mr Norton s sonnets are even more metronomically regular and his impressions are choppy and hurried giving the effect of confusion rather than of clarity In many cases he kills his images before they are born His Sunday Flittings are more musical but he even more than Mr Evans seems to be still fin de siècle A C H  OUR CONTEMPORARIES  In addition to much good criticism non academic and personal The St Louis Mirror often publishes poetry that deserves more than casual recognition In the Spoon River Anthology Mr Webster Ford unites something of the feeling and method of the Greek Anthology with a trace of the spirit of Villon but the tradition has only served to lead him to a little cemetery in a small town it might be any small town in the United States where death reveals life in a series of brief tragic epitaphs W e regret that we have space to quote only a few of the poems   Our Contemporaries  OLLIE M GEE Have you seen walking through the village A man with downcast eyes and haggard face That is my husband who by secret cruelty Never to be told robbed me of my youth and my beauty Till at last wrinkled and with yellow teeth And with broken pride and shameful humility I sank into the grave But what think you gnaws at my husband s heart The face of what I was the face of what he made me These are driving him to the place where I lie In death therefore I am avenged  DOC HILL I went up and down the streets Here and there by day and night Through all hours of the night caring for the poor who were  sick Do you know why My wife hated me my son went to the dogs And I turned to the people and poured out my love to them Sweet it was to see the crowds about the lawns on the day of my  funeral And hear them murmur their love and sorrow But oh dear God my soul trembled scarcely able To hold to the railing of the new life When I saw Em Stanton behind the oak tree At the grave Hiding herself and her grief  THE HILL  Where are Elmer Herman Bert Tom and Charley  The weak of will the strong of arm the clown the boozer the  fighter  All all are sleeping on the hill  One passed in a fever  One

dead   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  NOTES  Miss Constance Skinner who was born in British Columbia was brought up among the Indian tribes of the Northwest Her father a government official used to take the child with him on his rounds so that she became friendly with many primitive bards When she began to interpret their work in English the themes found their own form dictated by the poet s feeling for the old rhythms her intimate knowledge of Indian love and character gained through early association and impression and her later study of material gleaned at first hand  Her first Indian poem Song of Whip Plaiting proved on analysis to be accompanied by a primitive musical theme something more than a monotonous chant which filled in the verbal pauses in places and marked out the changes of mood and sentiment and of the beat and tempo The diminuendo and crescendo the rallentando and accelerando the rest staccato rubato and sostenuto are clearly perceptible to the ear in all the songs but are most easily followed by the layman in the Chief s Prayer after the Salmon catch which of its own initiative without design achieved the form and beat of the Bilqula Death Song in the original tongue The Song of Full Catch was suggested by the Canadian halfbreed voyageur song V la le bon Vent and follows its melody which seems more Indian than Gallic The author says  Primitive song was the spontaneous utterance of feeling Intellectuality and learning were negligible The spoken lines were in broken metre and the idea which was an emotional rather than an intellectual conception was completed by the accompanying   Notes  instrumental theme It was strongly endowed with the primal and essential qualities of poetry viz passion and aspiration the lifting of the heart from the visible to that invisible of which it is symbolical  W e add a few notes explanatory of tribal customs on which these poems are founded  Chief s Prayer With this tribe no prayer but one of thanksgiving is ever offered to Supreme One They say He has all wisdom and knows what we need and we cannot advise Him but the praise of those who know He is their Father and trust Him is pleasing to Him Kindness is the social and individual ideal of the tribe  Ku na e is pronounced in three syllables with the accent on the second  The Search The lover wanders in the forest asking the earth to show him where love is Earth reveals to him the name of the maiden he desires so he returns to her at dusk with the sanction of all Nature to give force to his wooing  The Change Song Some tribes bury their dead on the highest tree tops They bend down the tops with ropes etc fasten the body thereon in an open coffin then let the trees leap skyward again with the departed They wrap the red dyed mourning blanket round the oldest man and he goes alone secretly into the woods and buries the grief of the tribe in a place known only to himself In the way of nature he will die next supposedly and then the grief will be utterly unknown also Age bears the grief because it has no longer any thrilling joys to be clouded  Whip plaiting In some tribes the lover brings a torch at night and sets it alight in the sand floor within his beloved s doorway If she accepts him she quenches the flame in the earth and goes to him in the darkness The cedar tree is literally the tree of life supplying fibre for weaving baskets cradles mats blankets whips the ornaments used in religious ceremonies and even food in fish famine besides drooping boughs on which to hang babies in cradles for the wind to rock them   POETRY A
