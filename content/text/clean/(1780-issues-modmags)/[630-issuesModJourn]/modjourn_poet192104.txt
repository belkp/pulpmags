VOL XVIII No I  APRIL 1921  THE BOX OF GOD  I BROKEN BIRD  broken bird Whose whistling silver wings have known the lift Of high mysterious hands and the wild sweet music Of big winds among the ultimate stars The black robed curés put your pagan Indian Soul in their white man s House of God to lay Upon your pagan lips new songs to swell The chorus of amens and hallelujahs In simple faith and holy zeal they flung Aside the altar tapestries that you Might know the splendor of God s handiwork The shining glory of His face O eagle They brought you to a four square box of God Crippled of pinion clipped of soaring wing And they left you there to flutter against the bars   In futile flying to beat against the gates To droop to dream a little and to die  Ah Joe Shing ób by the sagamores revered As Spruce the Conjurer by the black priests dubbed The Pagan Joe how clearly I recall Your conversion in the long blade s House of God Your wonder when you faced its golden glories Don t you remember when first you sledged from out The frozen Valley of the Sleepy eye And hammered on the gates of Fort Brazeau To sing farewell to Ah nah qúod the Cloud Sleeping banked high with flowers clothed in the pomp Of white man s borrowed garments in the church Oh how your heart as a child s heart beating before High wonder workings thrilled at the burial splendor The coffin shimmering black as moonlit ice And gleaming in a ring of waxen tapers After the chant of death the long black robes Blown by the wind and winding over the hills With slow black songs to the marked out place of death The solemn feet that moved along the road Behind the wagon with windows the wagon of death With its jingling nickel harness its dancing plumes Oh the shining splendor of that burial march The round eyed wonder of the village throng And oh the fierce hot hunger the burning envy That seared your soul when you beheld your friend Achieve such high distinction from the black robes   Lew Sarett  And later when the cavalcade of priests Wound down from the fenced in ground like a slow black  worm Crawling upon the snow don t you recall The meeting in the mission that night your first In the white man s lodge of holy medicine How clearly I can see your hesitant step On the threshold of the church within the door Your gasp of quick surprise your breathless mouth Your eyes round white before the glimmering taper The golden filigreed censer the altar hung With red rosettes and velvet soft as an otter s Pelt in the frost of autumn with tinsel sparkling Like cold blue stars above the frozen snows Oh the blinding beauty of that House of God Even the glittering bar at Jock McKay s Tinkling with goblets of fiery devil s spit With dazzling vials and many looking mirrors Seemed lead against the silver of the mission  I hear again the chanting holy men The agents of the white man s Mighty Spirit Making their talks with strong smooth moving tongues  Hear Hear ye men of a pagan faith Forsake the idols of the heathen fathers The too many ghosts that walk upon the earth For there lie pain and sorrow yea and death   Hear Hear ye men of a pagan faith And grasp the friendly hands we offer you In kindly fellowship warm hands and tender Yea hands that ever give and never take  Forswear the demon charms of medicine men Shatter the drums of conjuring Chée sah kée Yea beyond these walls lie bitterness and death  Pagans ye men of a bastard birth bend Bow ye proud heads before this hallowed shrine Break break ye the knee beneath this roof For within this house lives God Abide ye here Here shall your eyes behold His wizardry Here shall ye find an everlasting peace  Ah Joe the pagan son of a bastard people Child of a race of vanquished outlawed children Small wonder that you drooped your weary head Blinding your eyes to the suns of elder days For hungry bellies look for new fat gods And heavy heads seek newer softer pillows With you again I hear the eerie chants  Floating from out the primal yesterdays The low sweet song of the doctor s flute the slow  Resonant boom of the basswood water drum The far voice of the fathers calling calling  I see again the struggle in your eyes The hunted soul of a wild young grouse afraid Trembling beneath maternal wings yet lured   Lew Sarett  By the shrill whistle of the wheeling hawk I see your shuffling limbs hesitant faltering Along the aisle the drag of old bronzed hands Upon your moccasined feet the forward tug Of others soft and white and very tender One forward step another a quick look back Another step another and lo the eyes Flutter and droop before a flaming symbol The strong knees break before a blazoned altar Glimmering its tapestries in the candle light The high head beaten down and bending before New wonder working images of gold  And thus the black robes brought you into the house Wherein they kept their God a house of logs Square hewn and thirty feet by forty They strove To put before you food and purple trappings Oh how they walked you up and down in the vestry Proudly resplendent in your white man s raiment Glittering and gorgeous the envy of your tribe Your stiff silk hat your scarlet sash your shoes Shining and squeaking gloriously with newness Yet even unto the end those blood stained nights Of the sickness on the lung that bitter day On the Barking Rock when I packed you down from camp At Split hand Falls to the fort at Sleepy eye While drop by drop your life went trickling out As sugar sap that drips on the birch bark bucket   And finally chills in the withered maple heart At frozen dusk even unto the end When the mission doctor framed by guttering candles Hollowly tapped his hooked horn finger here And there upon your bony breast like a wood bird Pecking and drumming on a rotten trunk Even unto this end I never knew Which part of you was offering the holy prayers The chanting mouth or the eyes that gazed beyond The walls to a far land of windy valleys And sometimes when your dry slow lips were moving To perfumed psalms I could almost almost see Your pagan soul aleap in the fire light naked Shuffling along to booming medicine drums Shaking the flat black earth with moccasined feet Dancing again back among the jangling Bells and the stamping legs of gnarled old men Back to the fathers calling calling across Dead winds from the dim gray years  O high flying eagle Whose soul wheeling among the sinuous winds Has known the molten glory of the sun The utter calm of dusk and in the evening The lullabies of moonlit mountain waters The black priests locked you in their House of God Behind great gates swung tight against the frightened Quivering aspens whispering perturbed in council   Lew Sarett  And muttering as they tapped with timid fists Upon the doors and strove to follow you And hold you tight against the uneasy winds Wailing among the balsams fumbling upon The latch with fretful fingers tight against The crowding stars who pressed their troubled faces Against the windows In honest faith and zeal The black robes put you in a box of God To swell the broken chorus of amens And hallelujahs to flutter against the door Crippled of pinion bruised of head to beat With futile flying against the gilded bars To droop to dream a little and to die  II WHISTLING WINGS  Shing ób companion of my old wild years In the land of K tchée gah mée my good right arm When we battled bloody fisted in the storms And snows with rotting scurvy with hunger raw And ravenous as the lusting tongues of wolves My Joe no longer will the ghostly mountains Echo your red lunged laughters in the night The gone lone days when we communed with God In the language of the waterfall and wind Have vanished with your basswood water drum  Do you recall our cruise to Flute reed Falls Our first together oh many moons ago   Before the curés built the village mission How banked against our camp fire in the bush Of sugar maples we smoked kin nik kin nik And startled the sombre buttes with round raw songs With wails that mocked the lynx who cried all night As if her splitting limbs were torn with pain Of a terrible new litter How we talked Till dawn of the Indian s Kéetch ie Má ni dó The Mighty Spirit and of the white man s God Don t you remember dusk at Cold spring Hollow The beaver pond at our feet its ebony pool Wrinkled with silver placid calm as death Save for the fitful chug of the frog that flopped His yellow jowls upon the lily pad And the quick wet slap of the tails of beaver hurrying Homeward across the furrowing waters laden With cuttings of tender poplar down in the swale The hermit thrush who spilled his rivulet Of golden tones into the purple seas Of gloam among the swamps and in the East Serene against the sky do you remember Slumbering Mont du Père shouldering its crags Through the crumpled clouds rose flushed with after  glow And dew lidded dusk that slipped among the valleys Soft as a blue wolf walking in thick wet moss How we changed our ribald song for simple talk    Lew Sarett  My frien Ah déek you ask um plenty hard question Ugh Were Kéetch ie Má ni dó he live Were all dose Eenzhun spirits walk and talk Me dunno

Under dose soft blue blanket she s falling down On hill and valley Somebody somebody s dere In dose hill of Mont du Père sleeping sleep  it  ing  And when the fingers of the sun lingering  Slipped gently from the marble brow of the glacier  Pillowed among the clouds blue veined and cool How one by one like lamps that flicker up In a snow bound hamlet in the valley the stars Lighted their candles mirrored in the waters   And floating from the hills of Sleepy eye Soft as the wings of dusty millers flying The fitful syllables of the Baptism River  Mumbling among its caverns hollowly  Shouldering its emerald sweep through cragged cascades In a flood of wafted foam fragile flimsy  As luna moths fluttering on a pool    Caribou you hear dat somebody s dere Ain t in dose hills of Mont

ing   Hush don t you hear K tchée gah mée at midnight That stretched far out from the banks of Otter slide To the dim wet rim of the world North East West The Big water calm thick flecked with the light of stars As the wind riffled fur of silver fox in winter The shuffle of the sands in the lapsing tide The slow soft wash of waters on the pebbles   Sh sh sh Look Ah déek on K tchée gah  mée

Dreaming about hees woman rolling sleeping And later you recall beyond the peaks That tusked the sky like fangs of a coyote snarling The full blown mellow moon that floated up Like a liquid silver bubble from the waters Serenely till she pricked her delicate film On the slender splinter of a cloud melted And trickled from the silver dripping edges Oh the splendor of that night The Twin fox stars That loped across the pine ridge Red Ah núng Blazing from out the cavern of the gloom Like the smoldering coal in the eye of carcajou The star dust in the valley of the sky Flittering like glow worms in a reedy meadow  Somebody s dere He s walk um in dose cloud Look You see umf He s mak um for hees  woman Tie w ile she sleep dose t ing she want um most Blue dress or dancing You see my frien

he s in dere   The green moons went and many many winters Yet we held together Joe until our day Of falling leaves like two split sticks of willow   Lashed tight with buckskin buried in the bark Do you recollect our last long cruise together To Hollow bear on our line of marten traps When cold Pee bóan the Winter maker hurdling The rim rock ridge shook out his snowy hair Before him on the wind and heaped up the hollows Flanked by the drifts our lean to of toboggans Our bed of pungent balsam soft as down From the bosom of a whistling swan in autumn Our steaming sledge dogs buried in the snow bank Nuzzling their snouts beneath their tented tails And dreaming of the paradise of dogs Our fire of pine boughs licking up the snow And tilting at the shadows in the coulee And you rolled warm among the beaver pelts Forgetful of your sickness on the lung Of the fever pains and coughs that wracked your bones You beating a war song on your drum And laughing as the scarlet moccasined flames Danced on the coals and bellowed up the sky  Don t you remember the snowflakes drifting down Thick as the falling petals of wild plums The clinker ice and the scudding fluff of the whirlpool Muffling the summer mumblings of the brook The turbulent waterfall protesting against Such early winter sleep like a little boy Who struggles with the calamity of slumber   Lew Sarett  Knuckling his leaden lids and his tingling nose With a pudgy fist and fretfully flinging back His snowy cover with his petulant fingers Out on the windy barrens restless bands Of caribou rumped up against the gale Suddenly breaking before the rabid blast Scampering off like tumbleweeds in a cyclone The low of bulls from the hills where worried moose Nibbling the willows the wintergreens the birches Were yarding up in the sheltering alder thicket From the cedar wind break the bleat of calves wedged warm Against the bellies of their drowsy cows And then the utter calm the wide white drift That lay upon the world as still and ghastly As the winding sheet of death the sudden snap Of a dry twig the groan of sheeted rivers Beating with naked hands upon the ice The brooding night the crackle of cold skies

 And later when your bird claw fingers rippled Over the holes of your cedar Bée bee gwún Mellowly in a tender tune how the stars Like little children trooping from their teepees Danced with their nimble feet across the sky To the running water music of your flute And how with twinkling heels they scurried off Before the Northern Light swaying twisting Spiralling like a slender silver smoke On the thin blue winds and feeling out among The frightened starry children of the sky   Look in de Land of W inter somet ing s dere Somebody he s reaching out hees hand for me Ain t For me he s waiting Somebody s dere Somebody he s in dere waiting waiting   Don t you remember the ghostly silence splintered At last by a fist that cracked the hoary birch By a swift black fist that shattered the brittle air Splitting it into a million frosty fragments And dreary Northwind coughing in the snow Spitting among the glistening sheeted pines   Lew Sarett  And moaning on the barrens among the bones Of gaunt white tamaracks mournful and forlorn   Sh sh sh sh My Caribou Somebody s  dere He s crying little bit crazy in dose ivind Ain t You hear um far way crying Lak my old woman w en she s lose de

somebody s dere crying crying   Then from the swale where shadows pranced grotesquely Solemn like phantom puppets on a string A cry pointed brittle perpendicular As startling as a thin stiff blade of

whistling wings have known the lift Of high mysterious hands and the wild sweet music Of big winds among the ultimate stars The black robes put you in a box of God Seeking in honest faith and holy zeal To lay upon your lips new songs to swell The chorus of amens and hallelujahs O bundle of copper bones tossed in a hole Here in the place of death God s fenced in ground Beneath these put in pines and waxen lilies They placed you in a crimson gash in the hillside Here on a bluff above the Sleepy eye Where the Baptism River mumbling among the canyons Shoulders its flood through crooning waterfalls In a mist of wafted foam fragile as petals   Lew Sarett  Of windflowers blowing across the green of April Where ghosts of wistful leaves go floating up  In the rustling blaze of autumn like silver smokes Slenderly twisting among the thin blue winds Here in the great gray arms of Mont du Père Where the shy arbutus the mink and the Johnny jump up Huddle and whisper of a long long winter Where stars with soundless feet come trooping up To dance to the water drums of white cascades Where stars like little children go singing down The sky to the flute of the wind in the willow tree Somebody somebody s there O pagan Joe Can t you see Him as He moves among the mountains Where dusk dew lidded slips among the valleys Soft as a blue wolf walking in thick wet moss Look my friend at the breast of Mont du  Père Sh sh sh sh Don t you hear His talking waters Soft in the gloam as broken butterflies Hovering above a somber pool  Sh sh sh sh Somebody s there in the heart of Mont du Père Somebody somebody s there sleeping sleeping   Lew Sarett   STILL COLORS  VELVET SHOES  Let us walk in the white snow In a soundless space  With footsteps quiet and slow At a tranquil pace Under veils of white lace  I shall go shod in silk And you in wool  White as a white cow s milk More beautiful Than the breast of a gull  We shall walk through the still town In a windless peace  We shall step upon white down Upon silver fleece Upon softer than these  We shall walk in velvet shoes Wherever we go  Silence will fall like dews On white silence below We shall walk in the snow   Elinor Wylie  FIRE AND SLEET AND CANDLE LIGHT  For this you ve striven Daring to fail Y our sky is riven Like a tearing veil  For this you ve wasted Wings of your youth Divined and tasted Bitter springs of truth  From sand unslaked Twisted strong cords And wandered naked Among trysted swords  There s a word unspoken A knot untied Whatever is broken The earth may hide  The road was jagged Over sharp stones Your body s too ragged To cover your bones  The wind scatters Tears upon dust   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Your soul s in tatters Where the spears thrust  Your race is ended See it is run Nothing is mended Under the sun  Straight as an arrow You fall to a sleep Not too narrow And not too deep  SILVER FILAGREE  The icicles wreathing On trees in festoon Swing swayed to our breathing They re made of the moon  She s a pale waxen taper And these seem to drip Transparent as paper From the flame of her tip  Molten smoking a little Into crystal they pass Falling freezing to brittle And delicate glass   Elinor Wylie  Each a sharp pointed flower Each a brief stalactite Which hangs for an hour In the blue cave of night  ATAVISM  I always was afraid of Somes s Pond Not the little pond by which the willow stands Where laughing boys catch alewives in their hands In brown bright shallows but the one beyond There when the frost makes all the birches burn Yellow as cow lilies and the pale sky shines Like a polished shell between black spruce and pines Some strange thing tracks us turning where we turn  You ll say I dream it being the true daughter Of those who in old times endured this dread Look Where the lily stems are showing red A silent paddle moves below the water A sliding shape has stirred them like a breath Tall plumes surmount a painted mask of death  Elinor Wylie   AGE AND YOUTH  How little wisdom in how many years How little wisdom and how much of pain And now the slack knees tremble the eye blears And mist wreaths blur the mirror of the brain And Memory in her niche with fumbling fingers  Plucks at old dreams mislaid which crumble soon And there is naught she touches now that lingers And her lamp smokes and dims a clouded moon And Youth a long way off looks sidewise over  Into the place of shadow and stops singing  The immemorial lay of Love s true lover While for a space Hope s hand grows tried of clinging  To his limp hand and droops careless and cold Along the grass and even Youth seems old  And even Youth seems old But Youth is old Old as the springtide as the April flowers Youth s infinite history is a tale thrice told Aeons but mask them in Youth s counted hours That rosebud and the dew upon that rose Lack but the memory of all ages past The wavering snowflake knows not but God knows The winters it has lasted and shall last Yes Youth is old and Age is ever young A new thing in its season a new thing New and more terrible than ever tongue   Lee Wilson Dodd  Of fool or poet has dared to say or sing  Yet not more terrible than Youth that seems  A dreamer s dream of some dead dreamer s dreams  RIDDLE  You would be free  Would you be free  If you were free  Is the wind free  Or the wind worn sea  Or sun tied earth  Or the earth tied moon  Is Ariel  Is Caliban  Is Satan in Hell  Or God in Heaven  Riddle my rune Little man  Lee Wilson Dodd   POETRY  E BE THAN  They come weeping They raise their voices Women meet them As they ride from the plain The band is home But none rejoices For many men Return not again  The chief leads them Yet heavy hearted He slowly rides From the wide shining plain Warriors mourn The friends departed For many men Return not again  Women follow The children weeping Straggle along Through the dust of the plain Many mourning Friends or fathers For many men Return not again   Carroll Lane Fenton  Priests chanting The sacred death song Raise dull grave poles High above the wide plain Men mourn Sons and cousins For dead men s souls Return not again  Carroll Lane Fenton  SONG  Hills are all aflower Skies are all afire Fool was I to sorrow For a dead desire  Lo the April marvel Stirs the earth again Break my heart of beauty That would not break of pain  H Thompson Rich   TO A NEW ENGLAND GIRL  Ah you have taken my hot delight In France and stripped it of its wings Broken the swift Icarian flight Of untoward imaginings That sought a sun hardly my own And you have winged and brought me down Through sudden ecstasy to rest Upon your white New England breast Where love is fragrantly austere As those deep bosomed hillsides are That slope down to Franconia Full blossoming in early year  TO AN AUTHENTIC PRIEST  He weighs me down this Christ of yours He weighs me down his arm is on My elbow in the streaked dawn Oppresses he my evening hours Still he outshines the manifold Bright rays that centre in my heart Much loveliness I knew grows cold The while his threatening fires start To gnaw at this old edifice Of sturdy lusts Outsavors he   Edward Townsend Booth  The savor of my ancient bliss He tempts me to apostasy Edward Townsend Booth  THE INTRUDER  Across my book your hand augustly reaches Thrusts it away I turn impatient to the window watching The tossed trees play March sunshine glinting on a chilly rain pool That snow banks frame A lusty wind comes gusting on its errand And names your name  Captive defeated having striven I yield me To thought awhile Letting the sunlight on the roughened waters Bear me your smile Hearing the mischief making wind that named you Question afresh If spirit find in spirit full contentment Only through flesh  Grace Stone Coates   THREE SONNETS  PERSPECTIVE OF CO ORDINATION  The circles never fully round but change In spiral gropings not as on a wall Flat patterned but back into space they fall In depth on depth of indeterminate range Where they begin may be here at my hand Or there far lost beyond the search of eye And though I sit desperately rapt and try To trace round round the line and understand The sequence the relation the black art Of their continuance hoping to find good At least some logic of part joined to part I judge the task one of too mad a mood And prophecy throws its shadow on my heart And Time s last sunset flames along my blood  WORLD BEYOND WORLD  Two mirrors face to face is all I need To build a mazy universe for my mind Where world grows out of world I dizzily find Solace in endless planes that there recede The fifth plane world soft shimmering through the glass Surely it has a light more bland than ours   Arthur Davison Ficke  And in the far ninth hides a whirl of powers Unknown to our dull senses I would pass Down the long vista pausing now and then To taste the flavor of each separate sphere And with each vast perspective cool my eye Whom should I meet there Never living men What should I love there Nothing I hold dear What would the end be Endless as am I  LEAF MOVEMENT  From its thin branch high in the autumn wind The yellow leaf now sails in upward flight Hovers at top slope then a whirling bright Eddy of motion sinks The storm behind With gusts and veering tyrannies would uphold Even as it downward beats this gorgeous thing Which like an angel s lost and shattered wing Against the grey sky sweeps its broken gold Another eddy desperate or in mirth Brings it to rest here on the crackled earth Where men can see it better than on the bough What quite preposterous irony of wind s will Touches it where it lies golden and still And once more lifts it vainly heavenward now  Arthur Davison Ficke  COMMENT  DRINKWATER ON ABERCROMBIE  R JOHN DRINKWATER during his recent visit to Chicago threw out a challenge to the advocates of the new movement by saying during one of his club lectures Lascelles Abercrombie is the most important poet under forty five now writing To be sure he expressed the opinion tentatively remarking on the futility of any attempt at finality in contemporary criticism on the impossibility of ranking an artist while he is still in active career And it must be admitted that to many of his hearers the eminence decreed to Mr Abercrombie was a convincing example of this futility  We all express opinions but unless blind egotists we do it with Mr Drinkwater s modest reserve offering them as a passing and perishing comment a stick thrown on the current rather than a tree planted to outlast its violence And so while agreeing heartily with Mr Drinkwater as to the unfinality if one may coin a word of contemporary opinion let us take up what we consider his over praise of Mr Abercrombie and try to justify a contrary point of view  Mr Abercrombie is distinctly even slavishly in the Victorian tradition Tennyson and Swinburne are his immediate progenitors with such traces of remoter ancestry as they have handed down He loves to wander in the old protected gardens amid a lush overgrowth of verbal foliage   Drinkwater on Abercrombie  a heavy atmosphere of rank rhetorical perfumes H e repre  sents the extreme of all those qualities of aesthetic motive  and style which the more progressive modern poets from  Yeats and Robinson to Ezra Pound and Carl Sandburg have  been leading us away from qualities which express not  the strength of the tradition but its feebleness and excess  not its growth but its decay Let us illustrate by quoting a  rather long passage from Emblems of Love It is Sappho  who speaks the brief and magic Sappho who though re  membered for only thirty lyric lines has tempted more poets  to platitudes than even Helen of Troy herself We quote  three sentences the first two thirds of her monologue  This bright earth Maketh my heart to falter yea my spirit Bends and bows down in the delight of vision Caught by the force of beauty swayed about Like seaweed moved by the deep winds of water For it is all the news of love to me Through paths pine fragrant where the shaded ground Is strewn with fruits of scarlet husk I come As if through maidenhood s uncertainty Its darkness colored with strange untried thoughts Hither I come here to the flowery peak Of this white cliff high up in golden air Where glowing earth and sea and divine light Are in mine eyes like ardor and like love Are in my soul love s glowing gentleness The sunny grass of meadows and the trees Towers of dark green flame and that white town Where from the hearths a fragrance of burnt wood Blue purple smoke creeps like a stain of wine Along the paved blue sea yea all this kindness Lies amid salt immeasurable flowing The power of the sea passion of love I Sappho have made love the mastery   Most sacred over man but I have made it  A safety of things gloriously known  To house his spirit from the darkness blowing  Out of the vast unknown from me he hath  The wilful mind to make his fortune fair  W e hear a number of old favorites discoursing thus elo  quently in Emblems of Love Helen Vashti Judith and  Holofernes a pair of warrior cave men and finally the  typical He and She of an achieved millennial world In  this last of the dialogues before the Marriage Song and  Epilogue She clothes her passion in the following lofty  lines  What hast thou done to me I would have soul Before I knew thee Love a captive held By flesh Now only delighted with desire My body knows itself to be nought else But thy heart s worship of me and my soul Therein is sunlight held by warm gold air Nay all my body is become a song Upon the breath of spirit a love song  To match this nobly rotund declaration of love one must  go back to Tennyson s lover in The Princess whose passion  so overwhelmed him that he cried  Nay but thee From yearlong poring on thy pictured eyes Ere seen I loved and loved thee seen and saw Thee woman through the crust of iron moods That masked thee from men s reverence up and forced Sweet love on pranks of saucy boyhood now Given back to life to life indeed through thee Indeed I love  It took twenty more lines to clinch the affair with Tennyson s princess and Mr Ahercrombie s He and She are even more expansive   Drinkwater on Abercrombie  Mr Untermeyer calls Mr Abercrombie s type of product metaphysical poetry Without inquiring whether this phrase is a contradiction in terms one might insist that Emblems of Love contains very little of either poetry or metaphysics that it is merely a turgid long winded artificial izing of certain grand old tales which only genius of a high order can touch to new beauty To me the dullness of it is not atoned for by magic of sound or phrase or by that swift breathless Tightness of imagery with which the true poet surprises us Mr Abercrombie offers plenty of images carefully thought out elaborately wrought similes and metaphors set forth in his heavy slow pacing iambics according to the most approved classic rules images which we follow at a respectful distance and without a thrill Here is one from the speech of a tramp in the dialogue Blind in Interludes and Poems published in 1908  Fool I have been One of the mutiny that attempts God And to take landing on the side of Heaven For foothold on the slippery peril of wall Reaching and tearing at God s sheer resentment Still to be thrown down by the towering glass A litter of upturned faces gesturing Against the calm front of his Sabbath s wall The desperate height of shining builded scorn  Interludes and Poems issued when the poet was only twenty four might be excused as one of the solemn follies of youth youth over educated and reeking with metaphysical wisdom The five dramatic Interludes have each a large profound and usually tragic subject motive under   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  which the pompous verse staggers heavily overburdened  One is hardly convinced when God himself utters a speech  of nearly fifty lines beginning  Simple this prayer is smelling sweet to me Therefore I take it and begin my power Yea I will largely let thee out of here Of being beautiful otherwise tiring thee  Nor does The Seeker persuade us when he says I have achieved That which the lonely man Spoke of core of the world that Self I know with seventy lines more to explain the achievement  At twenty eight the poet should have matured somewhat but Emblems of Love shows him still more deeply involved in the tangled meshes of an intellectually theorized and heavily artificialized art He might have persisted in that manner to the end if the new movement hadn t begun about that time for even in England the new movement as expressed in Harold Monro s Poetry and Drama and the Georgian anthologies meant something simpler than Mr Abercrombie s style had as yet achieved In the first Georgian Poetry we find his dialogue between a sea captain a doubting Thomas and a mysterious Stranger a little more tolerable though it moralizes tediously and in the second his play The End of the World shows the beginning of an effort at modern diction and a less involved style a necessary change since the people are ordinary publicans and sinners The play is stiffly talky however and its motive  is too slight for all the pother of reflective or didactic speeches    Drinkwater on Abercrombie  Deborah published in 1913 is another evidence of a change of heart Even though still clogged and rhetorical the style seems almost bare in comparison with the works above quoted as the following passage shows  That was not wind That was a hound s tongue Deborah you heard The beagles out of hell are loose in the wind The Gabriel hounds are running wild tonight Oh now God rest the little one s soul he died Unchristened and the Gabriel hounds are out Here we two sit and warm us at the fire And yonder in the darkness and the wind The little soul of Miriam s still born child Runs crying from the mouths of the Gabriel hounds  Deborah is a good example of the tragedy deliberate descriptive and static so to speak tragedy which is willed by the author rather than decreed by fate in which the characters are pulled by strings instead of impelled by their own mysterious and unreasoning volition The plot or rather the three plots for the three acts fall apart is perfectly reasonable indeed too reasonable But it lacks spontaneity the breath of life and therefore we are not convinced when Miriam and Deborah run out into the deadly marsh  Mr Abercrombie seems to the writer the extreme example of the kind of thing that is the matter with much modern English poetry His over intellectualized motives and his lush and leaden involved style have been admired too much by the Georgians And so we feel impelled to record our divergence from Mr Drinkwater s publicly announced opinion H M   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  REVIEWS  NECTAR AND SYRUP  Collected Poems by Walter de la Mare 2 vols Henry Holt amp Co A fit of admiration for de la Mare s works has upset the  U S A and her newspapers But every newspaper article I have read is a weak jumble done in a strange attitude of self defense One of the last champions of rhyme is passing if this chance is lost rhyme is to be an entirely lost proposition this is what they seem to say  This chance is not completely lost Walter de la Mare is a good rhymer one of the very best of today Indeed he is probably the sweetest rhymer of today His Peacock Pie poems and his Poems for Childhood are clever and darling They are not the drooling child poems one often meets with They are good old fashioned child poems and a little more there is a naively mystical note in most of them and bright new humor  And so Listeners Motley and the previous book Poems 1906 contain poems that have a hauntingly sweet music and others the mysticism of which is real sweet and naive also landscapes delicately drawn like this one  Snow at break of day On fields forlorn and bare For shadow it hath rose Azure and amethyst And every air that blows Dies out in beauteous mist   Nectar and Syrup  But too many other poems strike us as Maxfield Parrish s pictures do they are at first sight lovely but then to more scrupulous eyes this loveliness becomes falsity They are embellishments rather than works of beauty The naiveté of them is studied and they are childish where they should be simple The truthfulness of the image is sacrificed for the sake of vividness with the effect that a short lived vividness is attained which dies under scrupulous eyes Thus the famous moonlight poem where everything is silver even to the paws of the sleeping dog and the snout of the running rat is essentially a falsified picture Stripped of truthfulness all that remains of it is a sometimes pleasing jingle  As for his much discussed use of hackneyed words symbols colors music inasmuch as this is the age old vice of poets and scribblers there is nothing to say in de la Mare s defense And inasmuch as our times have witnessed a quite wonderful movement towards complete newness in poetry Mr de la Mare for this serious fault of his may be called unoriginal It is extenuating that the quaint delightful music of some of his poems gains in quaintness by the use of words which if hackneyed have a certain traditional flavor But the worst of it is that this use of hackneyed language and forms springs from a lack of faith in today and moreover it is made possible by the fact that nothing very actual concerns Mr de la Mare for were he concerned in things that require to be expressed in a modern language he would use it Here we find fairies and witches of the old type we find knights and damsels instead of guys and janes Why not give us   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  today s witches There are some And why not give us if not guys and janes today s knights and damsels There are some  However the critic should not say Why not He is concerned in the work of art as it is and not as it should be Well let us admit then that we have seen these witches these damsels these knights before in a hundred books of the past De la Mare is a repeater Not a bad one but for that reason he is just so much less a poet He is a poet of abstract sentiment chiefly And in this abstraction we detect a lack of roots a lack of force Even most of his landscapes are as we have said embellishments of old models and the only human beings in these books are some characters from Shakespeare  Like many poets Walter de la Mare belongs in the class of sentimental rejecters of reality and today His mysticism what there is of it is therefore a weak thing a negation rather than an exuberance His music has the melodious sweetness of a luxury rather than of everyday song  Among his best child poems we find this  Ann Ann Come quick as you can There s a fish that talks In the frying pan  He put up his mouth And moaned Alas Oh most mournful Alas alack Then turned to his sizzling And sank him back   Nectar and Syrup  We must say it again some of these child poems are as delightful as Mother Goose s E Carnevali  ONE POET  Advice by Maxwell Bodenheim Alfred A Knopf The Forerunner His Parables and Poems by Kahlil Gibran  Alfred A Knopf Neighbors by Wilfrid Wilson Gibson Macmillan Co The Birds and Other Poems by J C Squire George H  Doran Co Songs While Wandering by A Newberry Choyce John  Lane Co  There are three Englishmen one Syrian and one American in this list and patriots may stand up and cheer since the single American has written the only book among them that is worth any serious consideration I shall postpone my comment upon it to the end  Mr Choyce sings some old songs while wandering His chief distinction seems to be that he was wounded in action and has just completed a lecture tour through our West South and Middle west The publishers themselves think so for they let these important matters take first place in their wrapper description and add a few perfunctory words about charm lyric qualities etc To these casualties were added a small gift for rhyming and a grateful heart So we have variations on the theme of God s own country rocky mountains peaceful valleys descriptions of soulful meetings   with a Mormon maid and an Indian princess and other tender damsels varied with nice longings for Home England in the sheltering sea etc and Mother It is quite as if the English Captain in Shaw s Great Catherine had traveled here and appreciatively burst into poetry The only comfort one can get is that Mr Choyce is evidently quite young and has years of self awareness before him  In language that is simple and apt that even rises to a quiet poignancy a pervading suspense that is truly stirring Mr Gibson s Neighbors is a gathering of those intimate biographies that catch a life time on one pivotal perception This the larger part of the book gives it some distinction If read too consecutively impressions are dulled by a monotony of theme and treatment Mr Gibson is skilful in weaving his spell but he cannot escape it himself one finds the same emotions underlying the same moods pervading all the poems In the end one rises from the book having fed upon fare touched with a faint savour of the bread of Elysium and been made hungrier thereby The other poems are mainly occasional pieces of little importance  We have had conductor music and now we have editor poetry J C Squire presents charming well worked intelligent poems which show discrimination and taste I have the impression in reading his book of skilful parodies upon some unknown and invisible poet There is disproportionate intellectuality but it entertains and stimulates even if it tends merely to wear a path around old emotions It is after all something to get the careful expression of a highly   One Poet  cultured versatile man whose words have restraint and authority if not the compulsion of genius The first impression is of admiration for work well done for the faultless architecture of his metaphors and the unobtrusive efficiency of his rhythms  Parables and prose poems like those in The Forerunner by Kahlil Gibran will have all the unpopularity of sermons outside the pulpit The form itself that of free self responsible utterance gives an irritating finality to the content which a world grown skeptical is tempted to snub There is in this book neither the stark authenticity of prophecy nor the beautiful crystallizations of a creative imagination What we have here is pompous dramatizations of only half individualized platitudes sounding sufficiently sad true through a mist of fine language to catch the attention with mirages The accompanying drawings in dim shadow shape and vague lines give a fine touch of completeness to the book supplying a somewhat needed justification for the text Incidentally this volume should be praised as a specimen of bookmaking Mr Knopf has been conscientious in making out his list and he has been careful as other progressive publishers have not to give each book an appropriate format  Mr Bodenheim s book is a garland of persistently new flowers so different that a myth might be made of the strange sap in these short stems of the new designs made by the cluster of the petals the new color new flesh and of the truly terrifying fact that there are no roots or at least none that are visible or palpable or explicable   W e know that Bodenheim s faith is an exaltation of form out of his own mouth if we were inclined to a polemic What philosophy has not been enunciated a thousand times what beauty has not been celebrated over and over what sunrise sunset moon sea or mountain has not been published into notoriety by a timeless following of rhapsodists Nothing that a man can touch but is mottled over with fingerprints The business of the poet then if he is not to add merely a new and more or less unrecognizable parody is to mold his material into a new shape to give creative individuality a play in fashioning an ultimate appearance  Actually Bodenheim has done more He has found new themes going to neglected or forbidden realms to find them And he has come to them with a new attitude enabling him to equip his foundry with new molds  In doing this in not making his poems a personal synthesis of instinctively selective preferences in seeming to have written suddenly and on impulse without drawing matter and manner from confessed admirations or self fertilizing memories Bodenheim has actually proved himself an original poet He has broken through where so many others have wandered in circles have taken vague new paths and come dishearteningly back to their starting places where so many others less self sufficient have fallen into impotent night radiances of disintegration  A new attitude is a rare achievement and originality an enviable state of blessedness One may well believe that new words and new meanings are needed for its expression   One Poet  and forgive the inversions ellipses forced embraces exaggerations and diminutions of his vocabulary But it has its penalty To what conflagration Mr Bodenheim s fire may lead to is impossible to say but its flame is small and illuminates a little space only One misses in his work exactly that contact with a literary evolution which enables lesser poets over cleared fields to cover wider areas  It is impossible to miss or fail to enjoy the exhilaration of this verse Like the composers who have transformed music who have swelled the orchestra with new instruments who have added to each section whole new gamuts and in daring new combinations have made the orchestra more articulate so Bodenheim is widening the scope of words his verbs are quivering with new gestures his adjectives are suffused with new and subtle colors his nouns cry out new names his pronouns enter strange new relationships and the juxtapositions of phenomenal contrasts and harmonies have added new sounds deeper and more sonorous or shriller and more piercing  But just as the new composers as yet are finding it hard enough work to utter the new sounds and have hardly begun to sing songs with them so Bodenheim has in my opinion found it hard enough work to fashion the new meanings of words without attempting to say much with them His poems be they about grass blades or men have a final common appearance because their subjects are not inspirations but serve like the string in the chemical precipitate merely to focus crystallization Any string would do as   well and to provide himself a store of strings we find the poet tending to make catalogues he gives advice impartially to a large list of things and it occurs to me that he would give the same advice to any fortuitous association of subjects that Bodenheim had to give advice and it didn t matter to whom So we find him drawing a series of portraits So we find him wearily stretching out to the stock figures to prostitutes Pierrots etc  There is no quarrel with this It seems to be Mr Boden heim s destiny to break the molecules of words into atoms of meanings and to indicate crudely the possible new associations No doubt other poets will use them for greater speech Isidor Schneider  TEACHER POETS  The Roamer and Other Poems by George Edward Wood  berry Harcourt Brace and Howe Sonnets from a Prison Camp by Archibald Allen Bowman John Lane Co When one reads Dr Woodberry s poems the question  arises why does this man s work occupy so high a place in the minds of many supposedly discriminating people There is even a Woodberry Society the only society dedicated to a living American writer Yet Dr Woodberry s poetry is merely the careful well wrought work of a cultivated gentleman trained in literary traditions and familiar with the world of books   Teacher poets  1 wonder if the explanation is not to be found in the prevalent American theory that because a man is successful in one field he is necessarily to be treated with reverence in every other field The average citizen believes that because Henry Ford has made millions of dollars building automobiles he is an authority on the single tax the Jews the theory of relativity the internal problems of Santo Domingo and the doctrine of transubstantiation The relatively learned gentlemen who comprise the Woodberry Society may not swallow such bunk as that but they share mildly in the popular hallucination Dr Woodberry was a great even a delightful university teacher A census of the Woodberry Society would probably show a comfortable majority impressed originally with their hero s pedagogical ability and personal charm He was a great teacher ergo he is a great poet  Dr Woodberry s latest volume contains a long spiritual narrative The Roamer in blank verse a sonnet sequence Ideal Passion and a number of other sonnets and lyrics Technical excellence a plenty is found in all the poems so is conventional but sincere idealism What is lacking is intensity There is about the emotions an unearthly pallor Austerity the quality which the poems most nearly approach is just missed and missed because they are lit not by the consuming white flame of experience but by the clear cold steady light of intellectual reflection  Sonnets from a Prison Camp is also the work of a teacher Dr Bowman now professor of philosophy in Princeton   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  University was an officer in the British army and was taken prisoner by the Germans The hundred or more sonnets dealing with his experiences are too numerous unless exceedingly good which these are not They are interesting but they give an impression mainly of craftsmanship There is too much emphasis on ethical and esthetic theory not surprising in a professor of philosophy Moreover the sonnets tend to form an explicit rather than an implicit narrative whereas the sonnet sequence being a succession of lyrics is best adapted to the opposite  Nelson Antrim Crawford  TWO BOOKS OF REFUGE  Black Marigolds translated by E Powys Mathers The Dark Mother by Waldo Frank Boni amp Liveright  There be two deluges everlasting One is the deluge of new poetry which one may witness at the POETRY office the other is the deluge of new novels from England aggravated by the indigenous rain  This month we the lovers of poetry stand on a rock out of the one deluge and on a raft over the second deluge The rock is a little yellow pamphlet decorated with strange black scrawls Black Marigolds the raft is a novel The Dark Mother by the author of Our America  Whoever thought of Sanskrit Whoever heard of Chauras And who is E Powys Mathers Here is one of the most beautiful poems I ever read It   Two Books of Refuge  is the love poem of Chauras a young man of nineteen hundred years ago dying for having loved the king s daughter If I see her body beaten about with flame  Wounded by the flaring spear of love Then is my heart buried alive in snow  Seeing the stupendous wealth of expression in this ancient poem so beautifully rendered by Mr Mathers we dreamed that in those days there were only poets living in a beautiful world only poetic words to be spoken But the pitiful struggle of the beautiful is eternal and here too we have a glimpse of it where eternal love and death are sung  They chatter her weakness through the two bazaars Who was so strong to love me And small men That buy and sell for silver being slaves Crinkle the fat about their eyes and yet No Prince of the Cities of the Sea has taken her Leading to his grim bed Little lonely one You clung to me as a garment clings my girl  A delightfully quaint flavor is given to the poem by the slightly ungrammatical expressions and punctuation In the translator s own words I have tried by not letting my verse become a coherent lyric poem in the English sense to keep its disjointed air  This is one of those cases in which we cannot do better than quote I see her far face blond like gold Rich with small lights and tinted shadows Over and over all of her   Her scented arms Lay like cool bindweed over against my neck  When slow rose yellow moons looked out at night   To guard the sheaves of harvest and mark down The peach s fall how calm she was and love worthy  The salt of the whispers of my girl Murmurs of confused colors as we lay near sleep Little wise words and little witty words Wanton as water honied with eagerness  We may recall here another beautiful love death that of Wagner s Tristan and Yseult The experience that became song for Chauras cost him his young life  A brief notice only of the other book The reason why we so much as mention The Dark Mother here is that we have found in this book what is very seldom to be found in a novel poetry  It is a book of sensitive health The symbol for the first fifty pages might be a tall stemmed flower quivering in a sweet even breeze There is such delicacy mixed with such extreme health that we are reminded of the antennas of insects  The air moved toward the mountain the waves and the trees and the earth moved toward the mountain All the world moved gently upward toward the mountain like a tide The mountain moved downward toward earth spilled water and spread trees in it  This David is a man of perfect senses perfect eyes  And David saw the breathing of the woods the warm comfort of trees that had grown up together and knew their silences They were clothed in a sweet sanctity of resolve and repose They took the rain with faint bowed heads  Lovers of poetry owe at least an acknowledgment to this book of honest prose which is full of beautiful words a real gardenful E Carnevali   Celtic Fairies  CELTIC FAIRIES  Visions and Beliefs in the West of Ireland 2 vols collected  and arranged by Lady Gregory with two essays and notes  by W B Yeats G P Putnam s Sons Irish Fairy Tales by James Stephens illustrated by Arthur  Rackham Macmillan Co The Boy Apprenticed to an Enchanter by Padraic Colum illustrated by Dugald Stewart Walker Macmillan Co Although the books here listed are not strictly in POETRY S  province their highly imaginative content places them so near it that we must recommend them briefly to our readers  Lady Gregory s beautiful and scholarly work presents the raw material out of which the modern Irish poets headed by Synge and Yeats have shaped masterpieces and from which their successors will continue to draw so long as there are Irish poets In setting forth thus the Celtic consciousness of an imminent supernaturalism the distinguished editor uses the names and the exact language of the individuals who tell the tales giving thus to her book the value of direct testimony as well as the vigor and beauty of that folk diction which Synge has immortalized The scope of the work is indicated by such sectional sub titles as  Sea Stories Seers and Healers The Evil Eye Banshees and Warnings Friars and Priest Cures Mr Yeats essays and notes are of course not only competent but sympathetic  Mr Stephens beautiful book is a poet s retelling of some of the old Celtic folk tales tales handed down from long ago in the manner Lady Gregory s collection makes us under   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  stand It goes without saying that the tales are shaped into compact form by this close stylist without loss of simplicity and charm And Mr Rackham s illustrations are a return to his best manner and most imaginative mood  This book and Mr Colum s are for children in the sense only that some of the world s best literature has been so intended but no grown up who loves imaginative and poetic folk stories should deny himself the pleasure of such work by poets at play One is apprenticed to an enchanter in reading Mr Colum s book and his paraphrases of the classic epics Homer the Norse sagas etc may also be recommended to any child young or old as examples of vivid and beautiful imaginative prose H M  A LITTLE SCHOOL FOR TH E ELECT  The Little School by T Sturge Moore Harcourt Brace  and Howe  The little school for which Mr Moore writes his lovely book is obviously the sort of school that an artist like Mr Moore would plan Its teacher would be a painter or engraver or poet while the pupils would be girls and boys with the vision and the appreciation of the developing artist  Naturally this is not the kind of school or book that children nourished on the red and yellow humor of Rudolph Dirks or even the monotonous wholesomeness of The Youth s Companion will greatly care for It is too quiet too reflective too full of beauty But this fact is not against it The child with parent or teacher of sense and apprecia   Homespun  tion will find in the volume perhaps not realms of gold but at least places where blow the many winds always things of mystery to children and not to children alone where as Mr Moore himself says  None comes none goes But the wind knows  And the man or woman will find in the poems as much as the boy or girl indeed to almost any child without guidance the book is likely to be a bit recondite N A C  HOMESPUN  Rhymes of a Homesteader by Elliott C Lincoln Houghton  Mifflin Co  This is a book of western verse much of it of the homely familiar kind in dialect which passes current as good newspaper verse It is hard to establish a line by which one can say of verse of this sort This is a counterfeit of the genuine homespun and this on the other hand is the real stuff Several of the poems in this book rise above the counterfeit and approach the real thing but the majority are written down with that careful colloquial carelessness which fails of its effect just because of its too apparent condescension The naiveté of genuine folk homespun is not assumed An author may achieve the folk quality because he is naive really or he may achieve it through conscious simplicity but not merely through rhyming dialect or colloquial nonchalance   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  One may be severe on this score because Mr Elliott s best poems are so far beyond the rest Wheel Tracks The Homesteader The Sheepherder Forty Below The Chinook and The Third Year give promise of a much finer development of the author s talent A C H  MR BYNNER S SKIT  Pins for Wings by Emanuel Morgan The Sunwise Turn  New York  Mr Bynner must have had a beautiful time with himself working out these thumb nail caricatures There are too many for them all to be clever of course but a few have the delicate tang of wit  A hamadryad in the tree of knowledge is not bad for Miss Millay or Overalls rhyming for Walt Mason A cardinal on a merry go round is still better perhaps for Mr Chesterton A graphophone in the morgue is only a half success for Edgar Lee Masters and A colored postcard as Hamlet does not quite hit off adequately the cruelly battered egoism of Cale Young Rice  But the masterpiece of wit which would excuse a volume of failures the portrait complete and satisfying which leaves nothing more to be said is this of George Edward Woodberry  Grape juice  In the Holy Grail  A word of praise also for Mr Saphier s line drawings  and for one or two of Mr Opffer s sketches H M   OUR CONTEMPORARIES  BOND OR FREE  They are still talking about free verse both pro and con  although the champions of both sides insist that the dis  cussion is closed and the poets continue to do as they please  and get their poems printed We commend to Mr Tom  Daly and other fulminators the following contribution to  the controversy from a recent number of the Mercure de  France It is part of the theatrical review of Dec 15 1920  by Maurice Boissard  To say that rhyme is poetry that there is no poetry where there isn t rhyme is to express the worst poetic routine Let s take an example José Maria de Heredia if you will You know the sonnets of Trophées God knows that those lines rhyme but is it poetry in the true sense of the word Not in the least It is versification extremely brilliant we admit but still mere versification It is made for the eye for the ear not for the spirit or the soul It is a sequence of tours de force a show of patience suggestively like certain complicated trinkets manufactured with tiny shells by meticulous maniacs Do you want a more general argument You certainly have read poems by foreign poets translated into French line by line and without any rhyme because the translator had in mind only the thought of being faithful to the significance of the poem itself Have you felt the penetrating charm of these translations a charm due solely to the feeling expressed to the landscape described charm that the lack of rhyme left untouched or even increased by means of those essentially poetic elements vagueness imprecision indecision all that which is poetry itself Rhyme with its dryness its regularity its monotony its mechanical quality and exterior brilliance would have left nothing of that beauty or at any rate would have decidedly impaired it Rhyme is nothing but a poetic make up a way to look like poets for people who know no better than to make verses and it is high time to follow the advice Verlaine gave to tordre enfin le cou à ce bijou d un sou   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Not only rhyme is not poetry but moreover it is an encumbrance an obstacle to poetry for its sake the poet falsifies his inspiration  Probably Mr Daly s favorite magazine is Scribner s for  we read in one of its recent advertisements  The four or more poems contained in a representative number of Scribner s are joyous lyrical and well conceived Such themes as the bird on the bough summer in Arcady the little silver strip of road are preferred over grave or mournful subjects Yet all poems must conform to a high standard of dignity and distinctiveness CORRESPONDENCE  CONCERNING KORA IN HELL  Dear POETRY Writers quite as much in the countries of older art tradition as in America may be divided into two classes one the professionals whose concern is style technique finished achievement the other those who attempt at least to explore and develop new experience The former class restrict themselves generally to quite conventional themes or if they are very daring develop for themselves new themes about which they write verses ultimately hardening into a manner inherited or their own and softening in so far as ability to penetrate deeply goes Limiting ourselves strictly to America we may mention such poets of the first class as Masters Sandburg Aiken the list need stop short of only a very few names Particularly with Sandburg may one be sure that he will take an image and consciously sustain and develop it long after he has lost poignant feeling for the validity of the image He is a   Concerning Kora in Hell  professional writer He has learned in his own manner to be sure how to use the image the metaphor the brutal truth and the sentimental humanitarianism So starting out with the statement that the moon is a pot of gold mud he must have that gold mud spread over worldly possessions and of course at last a love woman He and many others seem to feel that it is necessary to write if not an authentic poem to write anyway Unless from an impulse to say something keenly felt writing is without justification  Of this first group few pass from their adolescent rebellions and miseries into a more spiritual type of searching Their discovery of experience is limited to material environment the corn fields the marching men small town viciousness the hog butchers of industrialism Outside and perhaps controlling the forces back of these externalities are more fundamental forces which they do not sense forces which have a universal application while retaining also a strictly local significance The experience of the locality is after all that of the universe The history of any individual relates itself with startling similarity to that of the age  Today is a time of the breakdown of faiths amongst the so called sensitized and intellectuals With the coming of the theory of evolution the more sublime metaphysical theories were gradually abandoned pragmatism with its doctrines concerning the usable realities followed on to lubricate the joints of a mechanistic universe However where a few began to doubt the value of these practical answers before the war literally thousands now doubt Why   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  should we believe in evolution which does not explain involution or the quite evident lack of progress Have we anything to prove that physically and spiritually the human species is not on the retrograde What is morality is non morality a possibility Dogmatized it becomes at last a degenerate morality must all ethics be individualized then Many questionings cynicisms scoffings and doubt ings attack all former judgments and demand that their defenders prove their basis and indicate clearly that it is something other than blind faith or inward hunger rhapsodized into a proclamatory religion made out of dream stuff Ecstatic faith and prophetic exaltation are too primitive to be explainable in the religious instinct for say Whitman to satisfy the diagnostic mind and the psychologist  Whatever certain groups or individuals may think or feel the civilized peoples of the world are groping for some basis of faith a faith in the mere value of living out their lives rather than a religious explanation of existence But there is a new difficulty in their groping they no longer trust logic sequence order the intelligible rational deducible  It is writers who are sensitive to this baseless way of accepting life or rather tolerating it because life is what we have who are developing the so called modern forms Both modern and form are words that signify too much traditionally and too little actually To qualify let me say I mean by modern that which is of the quality of today displaying sensitive consciousness of the age s attitudes and   Concerning Kora in Hell  philosophies By form I mean method of expression and conveyance and I have no concern with any structural form metrical rhythmic or geometric  James Joyce with his prose first indicated the modern form Possibly his style could be traced back to the oftentimes incoherent Rimbaud the likeness here is purely a mode the texture quality of perception attitude and substance are quite different the one has the mature detached mind the other tossed himself with the seething of adolescence into the field of sophisticated discovery and perhaps when adolescence and its ragings were over he would have relapsed into quite conventional or mediocre writing  In America William Carlos Williams and he beginning only with his improvisations entitled Kora in Hell is conscious of the new form in relation to the dubiety of the day Not agnosticism for the agnostic will say I can t know decisively we are simply doubting and doubting whether we are right in doubting There is in this book the spasmodic quality of the active imaginative alternately frightened and reckless consciousness One will search in vain for sequential outline it is incoherent and unintelligible to may I say the ordinary mind though I dislike the superior implication of self which the phrase carries with it Since minds are so elusive none is actually ordinary It is incoherent and unintelligible to those people with lethargy of their sensing organs They look for the order and neatness of precise developed thought It is not there Kora in Hell is accepted as a portrait of Williams consciousness a sort   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  of retouched photograph He is not distinctly located to himself it s a Should I or shouldn t I and what ifdon t It s a conscientious sensitive mind or life organism trained in childhood to staid and tried acceptances and moralities trying to be open and to think sense or leap to a footing which more acceptably justifies the life process than any of the traditional footings seem to  To me Kora in Hell is immeasurably the most important book of poetry that America has produced I find in Whitman a hardened exaltation which proclaims rhapsodic dogmatism the result of physical well being of the freedom of open air space and green fields Admirable in its day but the day is by for those of us who live in cities such as New York and Chicago and who perhaps have never seen a real prairie or the mountains of the Great Divide and who sleep in tenement house bedrooms several stories up from the soil which flavors Indian imagism and produces sweep of the corn sap flowing rhythms And we will not accept the statement that it is regrettable we have never had these things Our situation is our situation and by the artist can be utilized as substance for art There can be no turning back to the soil to the Indians literature is not thus consciously developed We are here in the cities of smoke subways tired faces industrialism here with the movies and their over gorgeousness and the revues and follies which gradually inject their ultra coloration into vaudeville here where it is deemed necessary to applaud art things Mozart and Schumann music established classics which fall   Concerning Kora in Hell  dully upon our hyper neurotic senses Be the conditions hectic heated artificial are economic political and social forces then not natural they are the conditions of a great portion of the country  For those who wish poetry to create some sublime beauty which to others grows irksome since it is necessary to turn from its sublimity to the reality of existence William Carlos Williams Kora in Hell will mean little To those however who rather like to have the record of somebody else s conscious states by which to check their own with which to respond and commune it will mean a great deal The writer not caring for literature as literature not knowing what function it performs in life other than that of a mental decoration if it does not get into reveal and sensitize people to new experience believes however that no book previously produced in this country has been so keenly vividly aware of age conceptions qualities colors noises and philosophies as Kora in Hell It is a break away from poetry written by poets who set out to be poets It is adventurous exploration Robert McAlmon NOTES  Mr Lew Sarett whose interpretations of Chippewa
