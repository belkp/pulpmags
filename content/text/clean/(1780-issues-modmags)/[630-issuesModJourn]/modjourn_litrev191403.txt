realm of man s experience PPRECIATION has its outlet in art and artto complete the circle and the figurehas its source in owes its whole current to appreciationThat isthe tides of art would cease to ebb and flow were it not for the sun and moon of appreciationThis function of the sun and moon is known as criticismBut criticism as an art has not flourished in this countryWe live too swiftly to have time to be appreciative and criticismafter allhas only one synonym appreciationIn a world whose high splendor is our chief preoccupation the quality of our appreciation is the important thingLife is a glorious performancequite apart from its settingin spite of the kind of part one getseverybody is given at least his chance to actWe may do our simple best with the roles we receive we may change our lines if we re inventive enough to think of something betterwe may alter ourbusinessto get our personalities across more effectively or we may boldly accost the stage managerhand back the part he d cast us forand prove our right to be starredThe player who merely holds madame s cloak may do it with dignity and graceand he who changes his rolewith a fine freedom and couragediscovers that he s not acting but living his part For this reason we feel that we needn t be accused of an unthinking all s right with theworldattitude when we assert that life is gloriousAnd close to Life so closefrom our point of viewthat it keeps treading on Life s heels is this eagerpanting Art who shows us the wonder of the way as we rush alongWe may as well acknowledge right here that we ve never had a friendexcept in one or two rare instanceswho hasn t shaken his head at us paternally about this attitude toward artIt s purely transitional he saystolerantly life is so much more interestingyou seethat you re bound to substitute people for arteventuallyIt really doesn t matter so much that Alice Meynell wrote Renouncement as that MrsJones next door has left her husband Wellhe s wrongat leasthe can t speak for usWells said to save the kitten and let the Mona Lisa burn who would consider anything elseW e think it s rather silly in our paternal friend to argue with us so heatedlybeside the point It s not a question as to which is more important Renouncement or MrsJonesWe re merely trying to say that we re intensely interested in MrsJonesbut that MrsMeynell has made our lives more wonderful permanentlyThe Little Review TH E LITTLE REVIEW means to reflect this attitude toward life and artIts ambitious aim is to produce criticism of booksmusicartdramaand life that shall be fresh and constructiveand intelligent from the artist s point of viewFor the instinct of the artist to distrust criticism is as well founded as the mother s toward the sterile womanMore soperhapsfor all women have some sort of instinct for motherhoodand all critics haven t an instinct for artCriticism that is creative that is our high goalAnd criticism is never a merely interpretative functionit is creationit gives birthIt s not necessary to cite the time worn illustration of Da Vinci and Pater to prove itBooks register the ideas of an agethis is perhaps their chief claim to immortalityBut much that passes for criticism ignores this aspect of the case and deals merely with a question of literary valuesT o be really interpretative let alone creativecriticism must be a blend of philosophy and poetryWe shall try very hard to achieve this difficult combinationAlsowe mean to print articlespoemsstories that seem to us definitely interestingor to use a much abused adjective vitalOur point of view shall not be restrictivewe may present the several judgments of our various enthusiastic contributors on one subject in the same issueThe net effect we hope will be stimulating and what we like to call releasingThe more I see of academicismthe more I distrust itIf I had approached painting as I have approached book writing and musicthat is to sayby beginning at once to do what I wantedI

Mark Lennan the kind of person to be kept out of a because he d not take charge of anyone s good novelThe very beauty of the The Little Review book made it insidioussomeone saidsuch art expended in defense of immorality would soon tend to confuse our standardsSomeone else remarked patronizingly OhThe Dark Flower may be well done and all thatbut personally I ve always had a passion for the normal Butmost maddening of allI thinkwere those readers of thrillersof sweetsentimental stories those persons who patronize comic opera exclusively because they see enough tragedy in life to avoid it in the theaterwho asked earnestly Butafter allwhat s the use of such booksWhat possible good do they doOn another page of this review such questions are answered with a poignancy I dare not compete withI want to tryinsteadto tell why The Dark Flower seems to me an altogether extraordinary piece of workIn the first placeconstructivelyThe story covers three episodes of a man s love lifeSpringwith its awakeningSummerwith its deep passion and Autumnwith its desperate longing for another SpringBut the handling of the episodes is so unepisodic that you feel you ve been given the man s whole lifeday by dayfrom Oxford to that final going down the years sans youthsans springsans beautysans passion sans everything save that faintglimmering light far out there beyond This effect of completeness is achievedI thinkby the remarkable intensity of the writingby the cleverand by no means easymethod of sometimes allowing the characters the author s pre rogative of addressing the audience di rectlyHighly subjective in everything that he doesGalsworthy has reached a climax of subjectivity hereThe Dark Flower is as personal in its medium as musicIn the second place the great mat ter of styleEvery page shows the very poetry of prose writing there s an inevitability about its choice of beautiful and simple words that makes them seem a part of the nature they describeFor instanceto choose at random from a multitude of exquisite things under the stars of this warm Southern nightburning its incense of trees and flowersor And he sat for a long time that evening under a large lime tree on a knoll above the SerpentineThere was very little breezejust enough to keep alive a kind of whisperingWhat if men and womenwhen they had lived their gusty livesbecame treesWhat if someone who had burned and ached were now spreading over him this leafy peace this blue black shadow against the starsOr were the starsperhapsthe souls of men and women escaped for ever from love and longing If only for a moment he could desert his own heartand rest with the trees and stars With a single clause likefor ever part of the stillness and the passion of a summer night Galsworthy gets effects that some poets need three or four verses forIn one place he defines for all time a Chopin mazurka as a little dancing dirge of summerin another gives you with one stroke an impression of his hero that it s impossible to forgetHe looks as if he were seeing sands and lions In the third placeGalsworthy s psychology is profound impregnableOne simple characterization will serve to illustratehe describes a man s face as having the candour of one at heart a childthat simple candour of those who have never known how to seek adventures of the mindand have always sought adventures of the body As to the lesson of The Dark Flower its philosophyitsmoralI can only say that it hasn t any such thingthat iswhile it s full to the brim of philosophyit doesn s attempt to force The Little a philosophy upon youIt offers you the truth about a human being and lets it go at that which seems to be the manner of not a few who have written greatlyFor the other sort of thinggo to any second rate novelist you happen to admire he ll give you characters who have a hard time of it and tell you just where they re right and where they re wrongI can see how you feel you re getting more for your moneyReview I can t help feeling that everything Galsworthy has done has had its special function in making The Dark Flower possibleThe sociology of Fraternitythe passionate pleading of Justice and Strifethe incomparable emotional experiments of A Commentarythe intellectuality of The Patrician all these have contributed to the noble simplicities and the noble beauty of The Dark FlowerThe Garden My heart

Meynell s Poems Charles Scribner s Sons The Little Review A Remarkable Nietzschean DEWITT CWING MrFaustby Arthur Davison FickeHave you thought there couldThere can be any number RFAUST is the embodiment of the Nietzschean attitude toward the universeThis characterization consciously ignores the legendary Faust of Goethe as having no vital kinship with his namesakeThere is of course a skeletal likeness one to the otherbut the hero in MrFicke s drama is incarnated with modern flesh and endued with a supreme willHis unconquerable spirit is not that of Goethe s Faust but of Frederich NietzscheIncidentally and singularly it is the spirit of WhitmanAnd these two menmore than any other two or twenty in the realm of literaturerepresent the undying god Panor the spirit of YouthNietzsche and Whitman are the understanding comrades of the young hearted and open mindedMrFaust s creator may have no conscious knowledge of Whitman s poetrywhich is a matter of no momentbut he has read Nietzscheand that is momentousindispensable in relation to this splendid result of white heat intellectionI say intellection because MrFaust is not so much a work of art as a remarkable example of reproductionI know thatalthough the thought and feeling of the work rise in places to the power of an inspiration wholly personal to the authornever Thus Spake Zarathustra For that is an originalauthentic voice whichlike everything else in naturehas no substitute or duplicateI can fancy a stronghealthyorganically cultured young manjust beginning to feel his way into the realities that lie outside the American cornbeltby chance taking a peep into one ofMitchell KennerleyDrama New York be but a single Supreme of SupremesWhitmanNietzsche s great booksandfascinated and quickened by that marvelously contagious godleaping to new heights of his own manhoodI should guess that in this instance the young manwho happens to be a lawyerthirty one years oldliving at DavenportIa was temporarily Christianized by bad luckillness or something of the sortand in this extremitykicked by Nietzscheexperienced the feeling of personal adequacy to which MrFaust gives utteranceRecovering himselfhe avowed his own godhoodeven to the last ditch And that is the triumphant Youth the Nietzsche of the thingA day or two subsequent to the appearance of MrFicke s book upon the market I had the pleasure of hearing it readwith well nigh perfect sympathy and appreciationby the foremost Nietzschean expositor in this countryLike other listeners I was amazedcharmed and arousedWere these results referable to the play alone or in part to the readeror to bothTo what extentI was compelled to askwas the effect illusory or hypnoticI had read some of Ficke s versewhich had given no intimation of anything in its author so heroically Nietzschean as MrFaustI had consequently tabbed Ficke as probably a poetic possibilityprovided he lived a dozen years in an involuntary hellundergoing a new birthEntertaining the doubts indicated by my questionsI read MrFaust to myselftrying it in my fashion by the treesthe stars and the lakeSubjected to this test the play did not have the ring and lift which The Little I had heard and felt when it was read perhaps I should say given an added vitality by a Nietzschean philosopherIt now impressed me as an extraordinary tour de forcereaching in some of its passages a species of accidental transNietzscheanismWritten in blank versethe superior quality of which is admirably sustainedthe style of the drama is undeniably poeticalas Edwin Bjorkmanthe editor of MrKennerley s Modern Drama Seriesstates in an interesting biographical sketch but where there is so much consciousness of workmanship so much preoccupation with an imported idea instead of sweeping control by an innerpersonal urge like thatfor examplewhich produced Thus Spake Zarathustrapoetry is not to be expectedWhat surprises me is thatdespite this restrictionMrFicke strides upward in many lines to the borderland of the godsIn the first three acts he writes as one possessedas an intellectualist furiously interested in Americanizingif you pleasethe racial implications of the philosophy of a superhumanity which will always be associated with the name of his temporary masterNietzscheIn these acts there is a deal of amazing revealment of insight of aspiration for transcendent goalsof the spiritual insatiability of manAnd there is a cold humorUnderneath the whole thing lies its own by productsocial dynamiteI think that MrFicke finished his play in three actsbut he added two more to make it fiveI was about to saybut in the fifth he achieves a measurable justificationfor the last sentenceTouch me across the dusk is poetry the wonderful words of the dying Faustaddressed to Midgethe only person who understood himNear the middle of the opening actFaustroused by an inquiring mind to Review an analytical protest against things as they aresaysI would go Out to some golden sun lighted land Of silenceThat is poetical it is cosmic in its feelingLooking at a bust of Washingtonhe enviously nocompassionately remarksNot a star In all the vaults or heaven could trouble you With whisperings of more transcendent goalsAt this juncture Satan appearsgains recognition by recalling an incident in volving Faust with a blackmailing woman in a college during his youthand thereafter tempts him into emptyunsatisfying paradisesIn his wandering and winding pilgrimage through the world Faust makes the footprints that we recognize as those of our own humanityseeking its way somewhitherHe is offered but rejects peacehappinesssalvation and all the rest of their related consolationsknowing that none of them could satisfy his restless heartT o his uncomprehending friends he is lostand Satan himselfto whom in such circumstances he is obviously resigned by societyfails to claim himBut Midgethe heroineknew himshe could touch him across the duskwhich was his kind of immortalityAnd so Faustwith a vague consciousness of his own godhooda sense of his own supremacyan unshakable faith in one thing himself passed from the earthly freedom of his will into the great releaseIt is altogether too early in the morning of humanity to expect to see this play or one like it on the stageThat it should be written by a young American and published by a young Englishman is enough to satisfy those who would enjoy its presentationand those to whom it would be Greek or unpleasant whether they saw it or read itmust wait for its truth through their childrenacross the dusk10 The Little Review The Lost Joy FLOYD DELL HERE was once a ladyI forget her namewho said that love was for women one of the most important things in the worldShe made the remark and let it go at thatShe did not write a book about itIf she had considered it necessary she would doubtless have written such a bookConsider the possibility a book entitled Woman and Lovea book proving with logic and eloquence that woman ought to loveand thatunless she lovedthe highest self development was impossible to her and to the race It is not entirely absurdSuch a book might have been necessaryIf half of all womankindthrough some change in our social and ethical arrangementsrefrained from love as something at once disagreeable and ungenteeland if the other half loved under conditions disastrous to health and spiritthen there might have been need for a book preaching to women the gospel of loveIt would have been time to urge thathateful as the conditions might belove was for womenneverthelessa good thinga fine thinga wonderful and necessary thingIt would have been time to break down the prejudice which made one half of womankind lead incomplete and futile livesand to raise love itself to its proper dignityWellwe are in a condition like that todayonly it is not loveit is work that has lost its dignity in the lives of womenIt is not loveit is work from which one half of womankind refrains as from something at once disagreeable and un genteelwhile the other half of woman kind performs it under conditions disas trous to health and spiritThere is need today for a book preaching to women the gospel of workIt is time to break down the prejudice which makes one half of womankind lead incomplete and futilebecause idlelivesWe need a book to show women what work should mean to themAndcuriously enoughThe book existsIt is Olive Schreiner s Woman and LaborIt is a wise book and a beautiful bookThere are statistics in itbut there is eloquence naming on every pageIt is a book of the joy and the significance of work for womenWhen Olive Schreiner sayswork she means itShe does not refer to the makeshifts which masquerade under the term of social usefulness She means work done with the hands and the brainwork done for moneywork that sets the individual free from dependence on any other individualIt is a theme worth all her eloquenceFor work and loveand not either of them aloneare the most important things in the world the supremest expressions of individual lifeHGWells on America I came to America balancing between hope and skepticismThe European world is full of the criticism of Americaandfor the matter of thatAmericatoois full of ithostility and depreciation prevail overmuchforin spite of rawness and vehemence and a scum of blatantohquite asininefollythe United States of America remains the greatest country in the world and the living hope of mankindIt is the supreme break with the old tradition it is the freshest and most valiant beginning that has ever been made in human lifeThe Passionate FriendsThe Little Review 11 Paderewski and the New Gods MARGARET CANDERSON I SHAL L keep alwaysas my most unforgettable memorythe thought of a certain afternoon during Paderewski s tour this year when he walked quietly back across the stagein response to an encoreand played Schumann s WarumIt was somehow heart breakingIt was a more poignant questioning to methan Arnold sunquencheddeep sunkenold world painSaywill it never heal Nothing that I have ever heard or seen has given me so vivid a sense of being in the presence of an art that is immortalIt seems to have become hideouslypopularto love PaderewskiThe critics will tell you that it s only done in Americathat Europeans have any number of idols they put before himand that we who persist in calling himthe greatestare simply under the spell of an old hypnotismThere was a timethey ll concedewhen he came like a conquerorroyally deserving the flowers we strewedBut now there s Bauerthere s Godowskyand Hofmanand Gansand BusoniOne local critic has even gone to the length of saying that since the American public has sat at the feet of these men and learned sanity in piano playing it has no enthusiasm for Paderewski sneuroticdisorderedincoherentmusichis woeful exaggerations of sentiment and hysterical rhapsody I should say some unpublishable things to that critic if we should ever discuss the subjectThe three most interesting human faces I know are Forbes Robertson sKreisler sand Paderewski sIn the English actor s there is a meeting of strength and spiritualitynot the anaemicspiritualityof certain new cultsbut a quality of soul that makes him a princea philosophera lovera soldiera sad humorist all in the limits of one personalitythat means utter nobilityIt can be as cold as a graven imageor as hot with feeling as a poet sDepth upon depth of subtlety plays across it not the hypnotic subtlety of the Orientalistbut the austere subtlety of an Eng lish scholar and a great gentlemanIn Kreisler s there is a meeting of strength and sensuousness that means utter fascination to the artist who would paint himutter revealment to the musician who would analyze his artFo r the secret of Kreisler s personality and his music lies in that finely balanced combination of qualitiesa sensuousness that would be a little overpoweringa little druggingwithout the gigantic strength that seems to hold it in leashThat balance makes possible his little air of military jauntinessof sad Vienna gayetyit gives him that huge effect of power that always makes me feel I m watching the king of the forest stride through his kingdomYou need never expect emotionalism from this musicianhe s too strong to give you anything but passionIn Paderewski s face there is a meeting of strength and two other predominant qualitiessentienceI thinkand sufferingIt s difficult to express his greatinteresting head in a series of nounsbut there are some that come near to itmysterymelancholywearinessa sort of shattering sorrowalways the sense of struggle and painand always the final releasement in musicFor while you can conceive a Forbes Robertson away from the stageand a Kreisler apart from 12 The Little his violinyou can never for a moment think of Paderewski without his pianoNot that he s less of a manbut that he s the most sensitized human instrument that ever dedicated itself to an artTo resort to the most overworked phrase in the languagePaderewski has a temperamentSomebody has said that no fat person ever possessed oneand after you ve speculated about this till you begin to wonder what temperament really isyou can come back to Paderewski as the most adequate illustrationYsaye is the best example I know of the oppositeWhen strength turns to fat wellwe ll not go into that but to make my point and there s certainly nothing of personal maliciousness in it it s necessary to reflect that obesity has some insidious influence upon artistic utterance Schumann Heink is an artist in the best meaning of the word but no one ever talked of her and temperament in the same breathso she doesn t negate the issue But Ysaye s tepidwinglessuninspired music his utterly sweet but fat music that appears to attract thousands of peopleis as lazily inadequate as its creator would be in a marathonIt s as though his vision had dropped slowly away with every added pound of avoirdupoisOr perhaps it s because vision has a fashion of dropping away with ageAh but Paderewski has the yearstoonowand his playing is as virileas flamingas it ever wasAn artist with a temperamentdoesn t get oldany more than Peter Pan doesPaderewski s furrowed face shows the artist s eternal striving his music shows his eternal youthhis faithfulness to the vision that furnishes his answer to the eternalWarum This is the secret of Paderewski s white magicHe s still the supreme god Bauer plays perfectly within the rules exquisitely and powerfully and misses Review the top height by the mere fraction of a moodthe simple lack of a temperament oras OHenry might have explained itby the unfortunate encumbrance of a forty two inch beltHofman has an impatience with his mediumapparentlythat leaves his hearer unsatisfied with the piano while Paderewskithough he transcends the instrumentdoes so because of his love for the piano as a mediumand forces his hearer to agree with him that it s the supreme oneGodowsky forces things into the piano pushes them in and makes them stay therePaderewski draws things outalwaysand fills the world with themI can think of no comparison from which he doesn t emerge unscathedIf I were a musical reactionarythis judgment would have no value herebut I m notClassical perfection is no longer interesting Beethoven seems no longer to comprehend all music in factthe people who have no rebellions about the sterility of the old symphonies are quite beyond my range of understandingBut Paderewski plays the old music in a new waygives it such vitality of meaning that you feel it s just been born orbetterperhapsthat its composers have been triumphantly revaluedrejustified in their claim for eternal lifeHis Beethoven is as full of color as his Chopin and whoby the wayever started the popular nonsense about De Pachmann or anyone else being the supreme Chopin exponentNo one has ever played Chopin like Paderewskino one has ever made such simplehaunting melodies of the nocturnesno one has ever struck such ringing Polish music out of the polonaisesor such windswept cadences from the Berceuseno one has ever played the Funeral March so like a cosmic processionthe mighty moving of humanity from birth to death and new lifeno one has ever so visualized those orchestras of butterflies that The Little Review played to Chopin in the sun I have still one great wish in the worldthat sonic time I may hear Paderewski play on a Mason and Hamlin that piano of unutterable depth and richnessThe fact that he s never used it is the one flaw in his performancesfor no other instrument that I ve heard gives you the same sense of drowning in great waves of warm soundThe combination would convince even the followers of the new godsButold or newand even on his cold Steinwayno one has ever drawn from the piano the same quality of golden tone or dared such simplicity of singing as PaderewskiTo put his genius into a sentenceno one has ever built so strong a bridge across the gulf that yawns between vision and accomplishmentThe Major Symphony GEORGE SOULE Round splendor of the

GEORGE BURMAN FOSTER PROFOUND unrest tortures the heart of the modern manThe worldslaughtering the innocentsis meaninglesslifebruised and bewilderedis worthless such is the melancholy mood of modernityToday life is a burden to many to whom it was once a joyDecadentsthey call themselveswho rediscover the elements of their most personal life in everything that is weary and ailingWe are all more or less infected with this weariness and ennuiThe blows which the spirit experiences from opposing sides today are so powerful that no one is in a position to endure them with equanimityThe forces resident within the soul no longer suffice to give support and stability to lifeHence our culture has lost faith in itselfOur civilization is played outWhat the Germans call Weltschmerz has come over usPhilosophers have fashioned it into systems singersinto song the sad but not sweet music of humanity sufferers allinto a sharp cry for redemptionDeniers of the malady must have their eyes opened by physiciansscurrying around curatively in this humanityFirst of allthere are those who borrow their panacea from religionThey demand a reform of the ecclesiastical life according to the sense and spirit of primitive ChristianityThey propose to recover the religion of Jesusand to find in it healing for all the diseases of the timesBut this remedy is so complicated that it reveals rather than heals the whole disunity and distraction of our present lifeIt was Tolstoiin garb of desert prophetwho would restore original ChristianityHe preached a radical reversal of our cultural life a monastic asceticisma warfare against all life s impulseson whose development our culture is foundedAnd ecclesiastical liberals would do virtually the same thing when they try to extract from the religion of Jesus a food that shall be palatable to modern tasteand then call their ragoutcompounded according to their own recipeoriginal ChristianityThere are other voicesnoisier and more numerousThese hold Christianity in all its forms to be the hereditary evil of humanityand see the salvation of the world only in a purification of life from every Christian memoryOwing to the brisk international interchange of ideas todayBuddhism has awakened a momentary hopeas if from the religion of far off India a purer spiritual atmosphere might be wafted to usin which we could convalesce from the Christian maladyNowwhat shall we say of all these strivings to heal the hurt of the modern mind All of them have one adverse thing in common They would tear up an old tree by its rootsand put in its place another tree equally as old and equally as rottenThere is something reactionary in all of themThey want to cure the present by the pastIt is precisely this that cannot be doneIf Christianity was once originalspontaneouscreativeit is so no moreWe cannot lead an age back to Jesuswhich has grown out beyond himAnd the Buddha religion is no more youthful and life giving than the Jesus religionIt is indicative of the depth of the disgust and the extent of the confusion on the part of the man of today that such a hoary thing as Buddhism can make so great an impression upon himA revivedrenascent heathenismeven as compared with ChristianityThe Little Review would mean a reactionary and outlived form of lifeThat men of moral endeavor and scientific vision could hope for a substitute for Christianitya conquest over Christianityin a rebirth of paganismis a new riddle of the SphinxOne way only remains out of the aberration and dividedness of our present lifenot backwardbut forwardNo winning of a religious view of the world in any other way No pursuit of the tasks of the moral life by those who seek a real part and place in the modern worldin any other way Hencea man is coming to be leader a man whoas no otherembodies in himself all the pain and all the pleasureall the sickness and all the convalescenceall the age and all the youthof our tumultuous and

your own heart and hopeIf you have ever thought seriously about yourselfif you have even tried to think seriously about yourselfyou have taken up into yourself a part of Nietzsche as you have so thoughtEven without your knowledge or intentionyou have passed into the world of thought for which the name of Nietzsche standsIt has been only now and thenin quite significant turning points in human historyand only in the case of the rarest of menthat such an influence has gone forth as from this manOnce in the horizon of his powerand you are held there as by magicAnd yet not in centuries has a name been so reviled and blasphemed as hisAnathematized from the pulpitridiculed from the stagedemolished by any champion of blatant and blind bourgeoisierefuted regularly by pedantshe is still

belongs to Nietzsche for no contemporary so gathers the youth under his shining bannerAnd it is because the moral seething of our timeour struggle with questions of the moral lifeare recapitulated and epitomized in Nietzschethat he stands outlike an Alpine apocalypseas the new prophet of our new dayThe mysterious need of a man to find himself in anotheranother in himselfas deep calls unto deep or star shines unto staris met in the resources of the great personality of NietzscheThe new day whose billows bear us afar began with doubtFirsta doubt of the Church and its divine authorityA violentdevastating storm swept over popular lifeThe storm was speedily exorcisedAgain The sea of faith Was oncetooat the fulland round earth s shore Lay like the folds of a bright girdle furled A new faith emerged from the old doubtlike sweet waters in a bitter seaand kept man a living soul Th e sea is calm tonightThe tide is full But the calm proves to be treacherousThe tide of the new faith now in the bibleand in the doctrine derived from 16 The Little the biblewent back to seaand now I only hearIts melancholylongwithdrawing roarEetreating to the breath Of the night wind down the vast edges drear And naked shingles of the world The human spirit urged a newmightier protest against the It is written which was said to put an end to all doubtThe new doubtas free inquiryas protestant scienceflung down the gauntlet to the bible faithNo page of the sacred book remained untouchedOnly one certainty sprang from this new doubtthe certainty that the sacred book was a human bookTherefore it had no right to rule over manMan was its judgeit was not man s judgeIt must be measured by man s truthman s conscienceHownowshould the timorous heart of man be quieted in the presence of this new doubtAt once new props were offered him truth and the stateWhat science recognized as true what morals and bourgeoise customs and civil law sanctioned as good these were now proffered manthat he might brace up his tottering life thereby Trust the light of scienceand you shall indeed have the light of life do what is good and you shall be crowned with the crown of life This was the watchwordThen

historyan old hereditary woe with which humanity is weighted downThis doubt long and ominously maturing throughout the spiritual evolution of our new time finds its most radicalmost consciousand most eloquent expression in Friedrich NietzscheHe launches this doubt not only against all that has been believed and thought and donebut against all that men believe and think and do todayHe shakes every position which men have held to be unshakableAn irresistiblediabolical curiosity impels him to transvalue all values with which men have reckonedand to inquire whether they are values at all whether good must not be called evil trutherrorAs Nietzsche ventures upon this experiment of his curiosityas he advances farther and farther with itsuddenly he laughs with an ironicuproarious laughterThe experiment is a success In the new illumination all the colors of life changeLight is darkdark is lightWhat men had appraised as foodas medicineevinced itself to be dangerous poisonmiserably encompassing their doomAnd since men believed that all the forces presentdyingpoisoned culturewere resident in their morals and their Christianity it was necessary to smash the tables of these old valuesIn full consciousness of his calling as destroyer of these old tablesNietzsche called himself the immoralistthe anti ChristMorals and Christianity signified to him the most dangerous maladies with which men were sufferingHe considered it to be his high calling as savior to heal men of these maladiesHe sprang into the breach as anti ChristLike Voltairehe was the apostle and genius of

as Brooke does in The Hill and in that exquisite sonnet beginning Oh Death will find melong before I tire of watching you that he should waste his time on stupidunpleasant cynicisms like Wagner and

listening to the argument for the plaintiffrefused to hear anything further That feller wins he said decisivelyOn being told that it was customary and necessary to hear the defendant s side alsohe duly listenedwith growing amazementDon t it beat all he saidpatheticallyat the close now the other feller wins In much the same frame of mind I read the articles that are appearing in the current magazines on the subject of feminism and militancyEdna Kenton s in The Century is the only one that is content to give one side of the caseDecidedlyyou will say on reading itThat feller wins The Atlantic prints an admirable article by WLGeorge on Feminist Intentionsand follows it hastily with a rebuttal by ESMartinMuch Ado About Women fearingI imaginelest it would seem to be bowing its venerable head before newprofane altarsLife gets out a really excellent suffrage numbersane and logical and reasonableand has followed it up ever since with all the flings it can collect against suffragemilitancyor feminism in any formA recent amusing instance of this is a letter by one Thomas HLipscombwho signs himselfalackA Modern Manand adds that his name is legionJudging by the terror in the communication MrLipscomb s modernity goes back as far as the Old Testament Proverbsand the womanly ideal he so passionately upholds is in all respects Review 21 the one the writer of this particular proverb acclaimsI have heard it used as a text so oftenand have had it grounded into the very framework of my being so consistentlythat it seems almost strange and irreverent to regard it with an alien and critical eyeAnd yet just see what is expected of the poor thingShe Seeketh wool and flax and worketh willingly with her handsBringeth her food from afarKiseth while it is yet night and giveth meat to her household Considereth a fieldand buyeth itwith the fruit of her hands planteth a vineyardHer candle goeth not out by nightShe Layeth her hands to the spindleand her hands hold the distaffMaketh fine linenand selleth itand delivereth girdles unto the merchanttogether with a few other airy trifles such as bearing and rearing childrenI supposeBut most significant of all Her husband is known in the gates where he sitteth among the elders of the landI should think so indeed There seems to be little else left for him to doI can almost hear the writer smacking his lips over this descriptionwhich no doubt tallies closely with MrLipscomb s own notionsFor all this she is to Receive of the fruit of her own handsand her own works shall praise herPossibly women have tired a little of letting their own works praise them and nothing else But I am taking the letter too seriouslyTo go back to The AtlanticI find MrGeorgewho is in full sympathy with the movement of which he writesclassifying the demands of the feminists as follows Economicallythey intend to The Little open every occupation to women they intend to level the wages of women in generalthey wish to change the attitude of those who regard women s present inferiority to menthey frankly admit that there is inferiority in many respectsas inherent and insuperableby demonstrating that it is due merely to long lack of thorough trainingan old friendapparentlyin a new dress They wish also gradually to modify and change existing marriage laws so that they will be equally fair to both sexesA careful re reading of MrMartin s article fails to reveal much in the way of counter argument to MrGeorge s forcible appealThere s a great deal of courteous agreement and some rather good satirebut against the specific counts of the feministsintentions MrMartin raises no telling argumentWe hear that whereas fathers wish all earthly blessings for their daughtersmothers do notas women are jealous of womenalso that mothers fear the modern woman on account of their sonsfor whom they in turn wish all possible goodthe modern woman will not make a good wife Angels and ministers of grace defend us In a double quality as daughter to a devoted and loving motherand as a devoted and loving mother to a most precious daughterI throw down my gloveI am sure MrMartin has never acted in either of these capacitiesso precious little he knows about it BesidesI do want my son to have everything that the world provides in the way of blessings and happinessso I want him to have as a wife a thoroughly modern woman with an awakened soul and a high idealto finish the good work in him which I have at least endeavored to beginAs I read furtherhoweverthe cat begins to poke a cautious head out of the bagWomenMrMartin arguesare not responsible for the blessings the Review feminist movement is trying to bring themIt is men That is why he is so particular to tell us of the careful solicitude of a father for his daughtersMenright alonghave procured all happiness for womenorif not men exactlyat least a sort of Zeit Geist I believe he calls it necessity And the poor deluded feminists are simply the little boys running along by the side of the procession and holleringThe procession is made up of vague forcesworking nowadays for the enlargement and betterment of life for womenforceshe quaintly complainsthat are making things go too fast their way already So we must take all credit from Luther and Knox and Calvin and the reformers of all times and give it to the Zeit GeistTheytooare little boysI supposewho ran along and holleredAt least they hollered lustily and welland the feminists are in good companyAnd the peroration every true woman will appreciate this What a husband sees in forty yearsmaybeof the good and bad of life for a woman what a father sees in his daughters and the conditions of modern life as they affect girls those are the things which count in forming or changing the convictions of men about woman s errand in this current world Well However far the Zeit Geist has progressed in other directionsit is plain that it has not made inroads on MrMartin s consciousness of the present state of affairsWho has given men the power and right to decide about woman s errand in the worldFor lo these many years we have been letting husbandsfathersand brothers decide for us just what it were best for us to doand if the new idea has any significance at all it is just thisthat we feel able to decide for ourselves what we most want and needMHPThe Little Review The New Note

letters by the man who might be called the American Henleythough that only does him half justiceto keep one up at night and teach him unforgettable thingsPeople have been saying that this collection doesn t represent the best letters Moody wroteCertainly if he wrote more interesting ones the world ought to be allowed to see themfor these are valuable enough to become an American traditionThe following is typicalTo Daniel Gregory MasonDEAR DANI have just heard from your sister in law of your enforced furloughI am not going to help you curse your luckknowing your native capabilities in that

patch of ice in the parkunder a poverty stricken sky flying a pitiful rag of sunsetSome little muckers were guying a slim raw boned Irish girl of fifteenwho circled and darted under their banter with complete unconcernShe was in the fledgling stageall legs and armstall and adorably awkwardwith a huge hat full of rusty feathersthin skirts tucked up above spindling anklesand a gay aplomb and swing in the body that was ravishingWe caught hands in midflightand skated for an houralmost alone and quite silentwhile the rag of sunset rotted to piecesI have had few sensations in life that I would exchange for the warmth of her hand through the ragged gloveand the pathetic curve of the half formed breast where the back of my wrist touched her bodyI came away mystically shaken and elateIt is thus the angels converseShe was something absolutely authenticnewand inexpressiblesomething which only nature could mix for the heart s intoxicationa compound of

skatingand has turned away his face from all manner of IrishI am supported by a conviction that at an auction on the steps of the great white throneI should bring more in the first mood than the

MARGERY CURREY Rahel Varnhagen A Portraitby Ellen KeyTranslated from the Swedish by Arthur GChaterwith an introduction by Havelock Ellis GPPutman s SonsNew York OR certain distinctive women Rahel Varnhagen lived for the same women Ellen Key has written this appreciation of RahelBy the woman to whom fine freedom of living and fearlessness and directness of thought are the only possible terms on which she may deal with the social situation in which she finds herself this book will be read and re readand pencil marked along the margins of its pagesThe rare womanhere and therewho worships simpledirect thinkingwhichafter alltakes the most couragewill know how to value RahelAlways she thought truthfullyThe woman who has been filled with joyful new amazement on finding that her only reliance is on herself that she may not depend upon this person or that convention to preserve her happiness will know how to value herJust so far as any woman of today has become interested in her own thoughts and workis the originator of ideasand knows the joy of making or doing something that more than all else in the world she wants to make or doso far she is nearer to becoming of the size of this great womanSuch a woman will share with Rahel Varnhagen the certainty that higher morality is reached only through higher liberty such a woman must demandas did Rahelperiods of that recuperative and strengthening solitudeboth of thought and mode of livingwhich only the self reliant and fearless can endureShe knows that she herselfnot conventionmust furnish the answer to questions of right and wrong by earnestfree inquiry and by testing every experienceThe acceptance of no convention was inevitable to Rahelas she thought of itShe put it to the best of scrutinyWhat value was there in itIt was not violating conventions which she set out to doThe Little Review but meeting them with a quietsincere inquiry of the reason and truth they containedRahel Varnhagen lived in Berlin a hundred years ago and was probably the most beloved and much visited woman of those whose salons attracted the notable men of the day FichteHegelPrince Louis FerdinandFouquéthe Humboldtsthe SchlegelsSchleiermacherand other giants of the timeRahel was a woman the lamentable rarity of them whose influence was not through her literary workher letters to friends are all that we have of her writing not through brilliancy of speech alonenor through her munificent patronage of the artists and literary men of her dayshe was not richand we read of the garret in which she entertained her friends but through the richness of her personalitythe glowing warmth of her sympathyher understandingand the wisdom of her heartAnd the value of Rahel to us lies in the calm directnessthe innocence as she herself calls itof her thinkingTo her went the acclaimed wise men of the day for the comfort of her fearlessness and simplicity of thought upon their questionsShe was said to be brilliantShe was not brilliant in the sense of being learnedor of being capable of mere intellectual jugglery and fantastic adroitness of thinking she was brilliant in the crystal clearness and the sure rapidity of her thinkingThe unexpectedness and strangeness of the simple truth she spoke bewildered peopleFor this reason she could sayI am as much alone of my kind as the greatest manifestation here on earthThe greatest artistphilosopheror poet is not above me This passion for truth in her own thinking was the origin of her social valueIts stimulus to others was immediateand her recognition through it of the important things in life made her detect at once those people and things that were original and valuable in themselvesRahel s most comprehensive significance writes Ellen Keylay in augmenting the productivenesshumanity and culture of her time by herself everywhere seeking and teaching others to seek the truth by everywhere encouraging them to manifest their own cultureby imparting to others her profound way of looking at religionmen and womenliterature and artby judging everything according to its intrinsic valuenot according to its deficiencies by everywhere understandingbecause she lovedand giving lifebecause she believed in liberty Think alwaysceaselessly this was Rahel s cryThisshe saidis the only dutythe only happinessTo a young friend she wrotebegging that he keep ploughing through things afreshtelling him that he must always have the courage to hurt himself with questioning and doubts to destroy the most comfortable and beautiful edifice of thought one that might have stood for life if honesty demands it And sohaving thought out things in the most utter freedomunhampered by old preconceptionsand finally unafraid of the starkness of the truths which she facedshe let nothing prescribed be her unchallenged guide or stand as a substitute for her own vigor and hardness of thinkingThis is why she said that she was revived by downright brutalityafter being wearied by insincerityA virtueso calledhad to give a very good accounting of itself to RahelShe demanded that it answer a certain test before it could be called a piece of goodnessFor instancein many cases she recognized in performance of duty mere acquiescence a laziness of mind which does not bestir itself to ask what The Little right this duty has to impose itselfPatience to her was often lack of courage to seize upon a situation and change it to suit the imperative demand to express oneselfThe more I see and meditate upon the strivings of this world wrote Rahelthe more insane it appears to me day by day not to live according to one s inmost heartT o do so has such a bad namebecause simulacra of it are in circulation Of these simulacra we are familiar in every age the amazing antics of certain self styled radicals the unaccountable manifestations of those whowhile professing liberality of viewseem to have no standards of values in their extravagances of livingRahel could understand every nature except the insincere and unnaturalWhile we mourn or exult over the eager efforts of women in our day to evolve completely human personalitiesit is interesting to read Rahel s summing up of the feminist movementHas it been proved by her organization that a woman cannot think and express her ideasIf such were the caseit would nevertheless be her duty to renew the attempt continuallyAnd how exclaims Ellen Keywould Rahel have abhorred the tyrannical treatment of each other s opinionsthe cramping narrow mindednessthe envious jostlingthe petty importance of nobodieswhich the woman s cause now exhibits everywheresincefrom being a movement for liberty in great women s soulslike Rahel s ownit has become a movement of leagues and unionsin which the small souls take the lead Since it is reality and not appearance that alone could stand before Rahel s devastating scrutiny of human thingsand since to her the highest personal morality consisted in being truecoercive Review 27 marriage seemed to her the great social lieHow could one of her simple clarity of thinking be anything but outraged by the vulgarities of an average marriage Is not an intimacy without charm or transport more indecent than ecstasy of what kind so ever she demandsIs not a state of things in which truthamenityand innocence are impossibleto be rejected for these reasons alone Of the evils in Europe she criesSlaverywarmarriage and they go on wondering and patching and mending Rahel believed that in the existing institution of marriage it was almost impossible to find a union in which fullclear truth and mutual love prevailedOf Rahel s naturewarmrichly exuberant with a healthy sensuousness and desire for sunlightJean Paul s letter to her gives us the essenceWinged one in every sense he wroteyou treat life poetically and consequently life treats you in the same wayYou bring the lofty freedom of poetry into the sphere of realityand expect to find again the same beauties here as there Biographical facts are negligible hereEven comment on the interpretive insight of Ellen Key seems not to be essentialthough without it this book could not beIt is the personality of Rahel Vamhagen that mattersand the influence of that personality on the men of her dayRahel is distinctive as a challenger of the worn out social and ethical baggage that somehowin all its shabbinesshas been reverentlywith ritual and with authoritygiven into our keeping by those who were as oppressed by it as we in turn are expected to beWith the simplicity of her questioning the honesty of these conventionsRahel has made worship of some of them less inevitable28 The Little Review Some Contemporary Opinions of Rahel Varnhagen CORNELIA LANDERSON HEIN E saidI should wear a dog collar inscribedI belong to Frau VarnhagenRahel s power over the brilliant minds of her day lay in her own wonderful personalityShe was uniqueknew it and gloried in itShe wrote to Varnhagenher husband and lover Yo u will not soon see my like again She understood thoroughly the limitations of her sexThey are so surprisingly feeble she says almost imbecile from lack of coherenceThey lietoosince they are often obliged toand since the truth demands intelligenceI know womenwhat is noble in their composition keeps together stupidity or madness And she speaks of theirclumsyterrible stupidity in lying Butdespite Rahel s opinion of womenor because of her understanding of their needsshe was a true feminist and looked toward their liberation through development and self expressionEllen Key writes How Rahelwith her lucidity of thoughtwould have exposed the modern superstition that it is in outward departments of work that woman gives expression to her humanindividuality She says by true economynature keeps woman nearer to the plant Thiseconomyis easily understood it is because the tender life is woman s creation and because that life requires tranquillity for its genesis and growthbecause a woman taken up by the problems of external lifeno longer possesses the psychological qualifications which are indispensable in order that a child s soul may grow in peace and joybecausein other wordschildren need mothersnot only for their physical birth but for their human bringing upRahel hits the very center of the spiritual task of motherhood when she says that if she had a child she would help it to learn to listen to its own inmost egoeverything else she would sacrifice to thisThe progress or ruin of humanity dependsin Rahel s prophetic viewupon the capacity of the mothers for performing their task How Rahel had listened to her own inmost ego is shown by the following characterization by Ellen Key Rahel probably did not know a single date in the history of Greecebut she read Homer in Voss s translationit made her declare thatthe Odyssey seems to me so beautiful that it is positively painful and she discovered that Homer is always great when he speaks of wateras Goethe is when he speaks of the starsProbably she could not enumerate the rivers of Spainbut she knew Don QuixoteIn a wordshe was the very opposite of the kind of talent that passes brilliant examinations and is capable of carryingcompletely undigested sentences in its head What Rahel could not transform into blood of her blood did not concern her at allThere was such an indestructibleconnection between her abilities such and intimateco operation between her temperament and her intelligence that there was no room in her for all the unoriginal ballast of which the views and opinions of most other people are made upshe could only keep and only give what was her own What Rahel s power over her contemporaries was we may gather from what The Little Review they say of her who was Rahel and nothing more Heine describes her as the most inspired woman in the universe TMundt calls her the sympathetic nerve of the time The Austrian dramatistGrillpargerrelates Varnhagen went home with meAs we passed his houseit occurred to him to introduce me to his wifethe afterwards so celebrated Rahelof whom I then knew nothingI had been strolling about all day and felt tired to deathand wasthereforeheartily glad when we were told that Frau Varnhagen was not at homeBut as we came down the stairsshe met us and I submitted to my fateBut now the ladyelderlyperhaps never handsomershriveled by illnessreminding me rather of a fairynot to say a witchbegan to talkand I was altogether enchantedMy weariness disappearedor perhapsrathergave way to intoxicationShe talked and talked till nearly midnightand I don t know whether they turned me out or whether I went away of my own accordNever in my life have I heard anyone talk more interestinglyUnfortunately it was near the end of my stayand I could not repeat the visit The Poetry of Rupert Brooke MARGARET CANDERSON Poemsby Rupert Brooke Sidgwick and JacksonLondon The unusual thing about Rupert Brooke the young Oxford don whose poetry is just finding its way in this country is that he has graduated from the French school without having taken a course in decadenceThe result is a type of English poetry minus those qualities we think of as typical of the British mind and plus those that stand as the highest expression of the French spiritThere is nothing of self conscious reserve about MrBrooke and yet it is not so obvious a quality as his frankunashamed revealment that places him definitely with the French typeIt is rather a matter of form that quality of saying a thing in the most economic way it can be saidof finding the simple and the inevitable wordMrBrooke stands very happily between a poet like Alfred Noyesin whom one rarely finds that careful selectionand the esthetes whose agony in that direction becomes monotonousFor examplein the first sonnet of this collectionOh Death will find melong before I tire Of watching youand swing me suddenly Into the shade and loneliness and mire Of the last landTherewaiting patientlyOne dayI thinkI ll feel a cool wind blowingSee a slow light across the Stygian tideAnd hear the Dead about me stirunknowingAnd trembleAnd I shall know that you have diedAnd watch youa broad browed and smiling dreamPasslight as everthrough the lightless hostQuietly ponderstartand swayand gleamMost individual and bewildering ghostAnd turnand toss your brown delightful head Amusedlyamong the ancient DeadThere are about eighteen words in this one sonnet chosen with infinite pains and yet the effect of the whole is quite The Little Review unlabored an effect of spontaneity reduced to its simplest termsPerhaps the point can be made more emphatically by a miscellaneous quotation of single linesbecause the poignancy of Rupert Brooke s phrasing leaves me in a torment of inexpressivenessforced to quote him rather than talk about himHere are a few Like hills at noon or sunlight on a tree And dumb and mad and eyeless like the sky The soft moan of any grey eyed lute player Some gaunt eventual limit of our light Red darkness of the heart of roses And long noon in the hot calm places My wild sick blasphemous prayer Further than laughter goesor tearsfurther than dreaming Against the black and muttering trees And quietness crept up the hill When your swift hair is quiet in deathSavage forgotten drowsy hymns And dance as dust before the sun The swift whir of terrible wings Like flies on the cold flesh Clear against the unheeding sky So high a beauty in the air Amazed with sorrowHaggard with virtue Frozen smoke Mist garlanded and a thousand other things that somehow have a fashion of striking twelveThere s a long poem about a fishbeginning In a cool curving world he lies And ripples with dark ecstasiesthat flashes through every tone of the stream sdrowned colourfromblue brilliant from dead starless skiesto the myriad hues that lie between darkness and darkness And there s one about Menelaus and Helen containing this description High sat white Helenlonely and sereneHe had not remembered that she was so fairAnd that her neck curved down in such a wayThe simplicity of that last line but what a picture it isThe important things about MrBrookehowever and of course this should have been said in the first paragraphare his sense of life and his feeling for natureOf the first it might be said that he is strong and radiant and sure and at the same time reverently impotentThe Hillwhich I like better than anything in this collectionwill illustrateBreathlesswe flung us on the windy hillLaughed in the sunand kissed the lovely grassYou said Through glory and ecstasy we passWindsunand earth remainthe birds sing stillWhen we are oldare oldAnd when we die All s over that is oursand life burns on Through other loversother lips said I Heart of my heartour heaven is nowis won We are Earth s bestthat learnt her lesson hereLife is our cryWe have kept the faith we said We shall go down with unreluctant tread Rose crowned into the darkness Proud we wereAnd laughedthat had such brave true things to say And then you suddenly criedand turned awayEverything in it with the exception ofkissed the lovely grass which might easily be spared is fine with unreluctant tread Rose crowned into the darkness is vivid with beauty and when the simple dignity of such brave true things to say has swung you to its great heightthe drop in that sudden last line comes with the most moving wistfulnessThere are several poemstoo long to quote herewhich show MrBrooke s affinity with the outdoors but The Little perhaps even five lines from one of them will suggest it Then from the sad west turning wearilyI saw the pines against the white north skyVery beautifuland stilland bending over Their sharp black heads against a quiet sky And there was peace in themNot long ago I asked a poet in whose judgment I have a profound beliefto read these poems of Rupert Brooke s and give me his opinionAfter looking at two or three he said he was afraid he wasn t going to like thembut the next day he reported that he wished to retractmaking the magnificent concession that some of Brooke s moods are healthy Of course there is a number of things in this volume that can easily be interpreted as unhealthy or repulsivelike the WagnerCreeps in half wantonhalf asleepOne with a fat wide hairless faceHe likes love music that is cheap Likes women in a crowded placeAnd wants to hear the noise they re makingHis heavy eyelids droop half overGreat pouches swing beneath his eyesHe listensthinks himself the loverHeaves from his stomach wheezy sighsHe likes to feel his heart s a breakingThe music swellsHis gross legs quiverHis little lips are bright with slimeThe music swellsThe women shiverAnd all the whilein perfect time His pendulous stomach hangs a shakingBut it seems something more than that to meAs an attack on German emotionalismhowever unjustlyfrom my point of viewthrough Wagner the poem struck me as an exercise of extraordinary clevernessI don t know that anyone has ever said so effectively the things that ought be said about that type of emotion which feeds not upon life butinverselyupon emotionMrBrooke s pictures have much of Review 31 the quality of Bocklin sThat first sonnet can be imagined in the same tone values as Bocklin s wonderful Isle of the Deadand the closing lines of Victory need the same medium Down the supernal roadsWith plumes a tossingpurple flags far flungRank upon rankunbridledunforgivingThundered the black battalions of the GodsSeaside needs an artist like Leon Dabo Swiftly out from the friendly lilt of the bandThe crowd s good laughterthe loved eyes of menI am drawn nightwardI must turn again Wheredown beyond the low untrodden strandThere curves and glimmers outward to the unknown The old unquiet oceanAll the shade Is rife with magic and movementI stray alone Here on the edge of silencehalf afraidWaiting a signIn the deep heart of me The sullen waters swell towards the moonAnd all my tides set seawardFrom inland Leaps a gay fragment of some mocking tuneThat tinkles and laughs and fades along the sandAnd dies between the seawall and the seaHow perfect those last three lines areHow skilfulin painting the seato concentrate upon something from inlandmaking the ocean twice as old and vast and unquiet because of that little tinkling tuneOne will find in Rupert Brooke various kinds of thingsbut never attitudinizing and never insincerityHe is one of the most important of those young Englishmen who are doing so much for modern poetryHe is essentially a poet s poetand yet his feet are deep in the common soilSwinburne would have liked himbut the significant thing is that Whitman wouldtooThere are several poems I have not mentioned that Whitman would have lovedThe Little Review Tagore As a Dynamic GEORGE SOULEWe do not agree that Tagore is a dynamic tant than his thinkingBut we are N The Crescent Moonwith its ravishing beauty of childhoodin The Gardenerwith its passion of loveand especially in Gitanjali and SadhanaMacmillan with their life universal and all permeatingwe have found the poet Tagore and been gratefulIt remains to ask What has Tagore done to usWhat is he likely to do for the futureWhat has been his answer to the promise and the challenge of the worldReligions have provided one answerIn his zeal of affirmation the prophet has declared that the individual lives after death that in some unseen world completion shall be attainedYet increasing millions find this explanation fading into unrealityIf one living organism is perpetuated after its physical dissolutionwhy not anotherWe can account for every particle of life which the blossom loses by its deathSome has passed to the seed the rest finds its chemical reactionwhich in turn produces other forms of life in entirely new individualsTo assert that the original blossom lives in an unseen form outside the realm of thought is preposterousWhy should itIts function has been accomplishedThe sentimentality behind this thinking is a weak prop for a vigorous mindAnd exactly the same reasoning applies to all living organismsincluding manThe more intelligent part of mankind has also outgrown the conception of a definite heavenIt is impossible to imaging a satisfactory heaven for the individualA place where there is no strifewhere everything is perfection and com we find him a poet whose music is more impor glad to print this interesting analysis pletionwhat joy is to be found thereThe essence of life as we know it is growth and survival its happiness comes from the exercise of a functionGrowth and survival postulate extinction in heaven an individual would evaporateSome thinkers have made a substitute religion of humanity They find solace in action tending to make the world a better placethey have been gratified by an imaginative conception of a future heaven on earthAs a religion of morality and action this is magnificentYet its dogma does not satisfyA heaven on earth is no more conceivable than a heaven anywhere elseIf we find our happiness in actionhow shall our descendants find happiness when there are no more evils to conquerThough a static condition of blessedness be the goal of humanitarian endeavorit is the progress toward it which furnishes the joy The Oriental thinker has looked for his answer in a different directionThough the individual is partial and unsuccessfullife as a whole is always triumphantCannot the individual by contemplation identify himself with the world soulCan he not tack himself on to this all inclusive life by denial and forgetfulness of himselfBrahmin saints have done so imaginativelyBut such an answer is no answerWe are individualsafter alland thinking of Nirvana will not rob us of our separate bodies and mindsContemplation is not a substitute for livingThe doctrine of transmigration is equally unsatisfyingIf an individual The Little never succeeds in any single lifeinnumerable chances will be mere repetitions of tragedyThe only hope of such a process would be a final heaven on earthwhich is just as inconceivable as that of the humanitariansWe cannot now be satisfied with theological answersNor will the world ever find an answer permanently satisfactoryIs not this as it should beA fixed system of thought which answers every spiritual craving must be a shell around the individualpreventing growthIt finally ceases to be a dynamic and becomes a wall in the way of the feelers which mankind is constantly sending into his spiritual environmentIt forces him to restIt eventually turns all his expansion into the lower planes of lifeIt is deadeningsuffocatingas soon as he reaches its limitsOf what naturethenmust be the religion of the modern man and womanFirst of allit must not be imposed from withoutit must grow through the personality and find its being thereIt must not only square with every known fact of science and thought it must stimulate to a fervent desire for new understandingIt must not deny or destroy lifeit must be life s essenceIt must ring with a call to the individual to assume his proper dignity of lifeIt must harmonize with the laughter of children and with the bitter beauty of a winter seaIt must flame with emotionyet be keen and hard as a swordAnd it must be not a self constituted standard with which every other thing is arbitrarily comparedbut a principle of growth making necessary Review 33 in us visionstrengthfreedomand fearlessnessIt is my feeling that Tagore will suggest to the modern man such a religionHe gives expressionthough notof courseperfect expressionto a synthesis of many latent instincts of the modern mindHe glories in understandingnot only facts and truthbut emotions and all manifestations of lifeHe calls us to see vivid beauty wherever it is foundHe acclaims the aid of science in extending man s personality throughout the universeHe sees the oneness of all lifeand bids man stand erect on account of this eternal and timeless force coursing through himHe sees the oneness of humanityand the necessity of perfecting human relationsHe depicts purity without asceticismvigor without brutalityHe emphasizes joy and actionHe does not blink the fact of deathbut robs it of horror by showing it as the natural end of a victorious lifeWhile he encourages by the idea of an ultimate goalhe inspires by the conception of a real connection with infinity here and nowRevering the universal lifehe sees that it finds expression only in individualsand that the law of our being must be to live as completely as possibleMany before Tagore have said these things partiallyBut it remained for a poet who combines the intelligence of the Orient with that of the Occident to say them alland to say them with such beauty and simplicity that a large part of the world listensIf he succeeds in making us conscious of such a religionhe will have quickened life and made it potent as few artists canThe Little Review Ethel Sidgwick sSuccessionMARGARET CANDERSON Succession A Comedy of the Generationsby Ethel Sidgwick SmallMaynard and CompanyBoston THEL SIDGWICK is the world s next great woman novelistThough I confess eagerly that I enjoy her novels more than any novels I ve ever read I mean it literally it isn t on so personal a basis that I offer the judgmentBut I m confident that within ten years the critical perspective will show her on this pinnacleSince George Eliot and the BrontësI can think of no woman who has focused art and life so intensely into novel writing though even as I say this Ethan Frome looms up and leaves me a little uncomfortableBut the important thing is that Ethel Sidgwick is going to count enormouslyPeople who aren t yet aware of herand there seems to be a lot of themcan be easily explained as that body of the public that neglects a masterpiece until it has become the fashion to acclaim itBut Ethel Sidgwick has written a novel that s more important than any number of our traditional masterpiecesFor instanceit s a much more important story than Vanity Fairjust as Jean Christophe is more valuable than Ivan hoeThe novel of manners has its delightful placeand so has the historical romance but the novel that chronicles with subtlety the intellectual or artistic temper of an age is as much more important than these as Greek drama is than the moving picture showI know there are people who ll read Succession and continue to prefer Thackeray s geniality to Miss Sidgwick s brilliant seriousness and her humor that s not at all genial but rapidsophisticatedimpatient of comedy in the accepted senseEthel Sidgwick might write a radiant tragedyor a wistful satireor a sad comedyI can never imagine her being anything so obvious as merely comic or genialShe doesn t laughshe couldn t chuckleshe has just the flash of a smileand then she hurries on dazzlinglyas though things were too important to be anything but passionate aboutShe doesn t warm the cockles of your heart or whatever that silly phrase is and she doesn t do cruderaw things to show you that she knows life She goes down into the darkness rose crownedin Rupert Brooke s gorgeous phrase when she goes into the sunlight it is always with something of remembered agonyThat s the fine quality of her vitalismShe s too strong to be hardtoo steel like to be robustShe s like fire and keen air to borrow another poet s phraseShe reflects life through the mirror of a vivid personality which is one way of being an important artistShe assumes that you re also vividand quickand subtleand this gives her writing the most beautiful quality of nervousness the kind you mean when you re not talking about nervesIn shortEthel Sidgwick is the most definitely magnetic personality I ve ever felt through a book s pagesSuccessionthough complete in itselfis really a sequel to Promisepublished a year agoThe sub title presents the ideaand can be concretely expanded in a sentence Antoinechild wonder violinistand the youngest of the celebrated Lemauresrevolts against the musical ideas of his grandfatherHere it is The Little again the battle of youth and agemade particularly interesting because it s a purely intellectual warfareand particularly charming because its participants are such delightful peopleThe first glimpse of Antoine is irresistibleAfter a series of concerts in Englandhe is being taken by his uncle to their home in FranceMLucien Lemaure has chosen the long route because his nephew has an odd habit of sleeping better on the water than in any house or hotel on shore and while he doesn t understand this nephewhe has vital reasons for considering himfor upon Antoine s delicate shoulders rests the musical honor of the family Sleep wellmon petit he saidin the tiny cabin W e are going home Antoinewho had no immediate intention of sleepingwas staring out of the dim porthole of a fascinating space of the unknownThat is home to youhe asked vaguely T o be sureMy first youth was passed therelike thine After an interval passed spent in a vain effort to imagine his uncle with no hair on his faceAntoine gave it up and recurred to the windowI wish I lived on the seahe murmuredIn the trainflying toward ParisLucien refers to the last London recitalwhen Antoine had made both his uncle s and his conductor s lives a burden by his indifferent rehearsal of his grandfather s latest compositionAntoine s outburst had outraged Luciento whom faith in his father s character and genius hadall his lifeamounted to a religion What will you tell him then said Antoineturning his dark eyes without deranging his languid attitude along the seat Just that I said some sottisesthe same as always He is not a childthought Lucien instantlyHe is clevermaddeningOf coursemy action will have to be explainedI shall sayhe said aloudwith deliberationthat we differed about the concertoThat you were difficult and headstrong over thatwhich is certainly trueYou have admitted since that it was too much for youeh Review 35 Yessaid the boy It is an awful thingbut I played itI had to have something real that nightYo u imply my father s composition is not real Ohdo notsaid the boyunder his breathI have remembered he is your father now T o be suresaid MLucienwith statelinessAnd have you no duty to him as well I shall see him soonI shall remember then Antoine diverted his eyesto his uncle s private reliefDo you think I do not want to rememberafter that I should think you would be ashamed said Lucienby way of the last word in argumentand retired to his paper Yo u like me to be ashamed said Antoinesnatching the last word from himthough still with a manner of extreme languor GoodthenI have beenIt is nothe watched the trees of Normandy sleepily a very nice feelingI am glad you know what it is likeat least growled his uncle into the paper Don t you said his nephew What it is likeis to make you feel rather sick all the time especially while you are playing itWhat The thing you are ashamed ofHow I wanted to hug himAntoine said Lucienrising and discarding the paperdo not be absurdHerelook at meYou suffered that night at the concertehYou excited yourself so muchlittle imbecileAre you tired nowNothank you this is Francereplied AntoineThat is a French cow he murmured no t so fatThat is a French treenot so thickThe sky is differentand the sunThe concerts will be easierI expectBut the first glimpse of MLemaurethe grandfatheris reassuringIn facthe s almost as irresistible as Antoinemaking you realize immediately that the battle is going to be a subtle oneand that it may be difficult to know which side to takeafter allThe old musician asks about the last recitalI was not at the last orchestral Lucien answersI left him in Wurst s chargeand The Little Review went to the country I should not easily desert my postas you knowbut the boy made it clear enough he had no use for meHe clung to that sacré concerto of Tschedinwhich he knows you detestand which I never thought in a condition to per formHe mocked himself of my objectionscontradicted meeluded meand twisted Wurst round his finger at rehearsals And WurstWurst found him charmingHe has Russian blood himselfand had known the composerHe has encouraged Antoine s revolutionary tendencies from the firstThe pair of them took the last concert so completely out of my hands that it seemed fruitless to remain Bébé forgot himselfpronounced MLemaurestill quite at easeIndeed the situation so reminded him of Antoine s childhood that he longed to laugh Wha t did he sayand when We will not revive itsaid LucienWhen he came to his senseshe apologized sufficientlyPerhaps he was not well when is the first engagement Sunday Let him be for a timeThere is no harmLucien gruntedI shall not disturb him while he is seasickif that is what you meanIt would do him no harm to play scales all the weekScales as you willbut not personsNot Dmitri TschedinI meannor even meIt is intrusive personalityalwaysthat disturbs the current of Antoine s philosophy Father How absurdBut I have long remarked itHis own individuality fights the alien matterand it is not till he has either rejected it or absorbed that he is steady againWurst and his Russians have excited him nothing more naturalFor me said MLemaureplunging into memoryas he stood by his son s side at the window at his agethe realm of music did not hold such petulant passionsany more than it held flat heresylike that of Sorbier and Duchâtel Antoine adores Duchâtelremarked LucienThere is no fighting thereBon The old man laughedHeresy on the hearth thenif it must be soSo long as he does not play the stuff in my hearing There are over six hundred pages in the storyand they cover just a year and a half of Antoine s lifeThis appears to be an impossible literary featany orthodox novelist will tell you that you can t hold a reader through six hundred pages with the story of a fourteen yearold boyBut Miss Sidgwick s holding power is wellI read Succession during a brief trip to Bostonand much as I longed to absorb Concord and all its charmsI found I only had half my capacity with me the rest was with Antoineand it stayed there till in desperation I shut myself up in a hotel room and saw him safely off to America with his nicewholesomeinartistic fatherThen came the awful realization that I d have to wait a whole year for the next volume for surely Miss Sidgwick intends to make a trilogyThe explanationof this absorption is simply that Antoine is so interestingHis professional life is dramaticbut even in the commonest experiences of every day his world is as vivid as it can only be to a dramatic natureFor instancein this little scene with his brotherThere was a little thing on legs he announced that went under the carpet just nowIt was rather horribleand I have not looked for it A blackbeetleI presume said PhilipIt was not blacksaid AntoineIt was pink a not clean pinkyou understandI found it a pause disagreeableHow could you find it when you had not looked for itsaid PhilipAnother pauseAntoine considering the pointwhich was an old one Yo u will catch it he suggestedshooting a soft glance at his brother Wh y should Isaid Philip They re perfectly harmless I shall dream of it said Antoineshutting his eyesIt was too longdo you seeand pink as well His brow contractedand he finished with gentle conviction I f it comes upon my bed in the nightI shall be sick Of coursemost interesting of all is his musical developmentin which are involved several personalities of striking character Duchâtelthe revolutionarymore a sonafter the French fashionThe Little Review than a man or a musicianSavignythe celebrated alienistwho treats the child hypnotically in his severe illnessesLemonskia rival child wonderwho is like a pigand vulgar which it is silly to saybecause he is a beautiful artistaccording to AntoineReussthe great German conductorand the boy s staunch friendwho hatesthe cursed French trainingof making life weigh so heavily on its youthJacques Charretteurthe vagabond violinist a man to play French music in FranceCécilethe auntwho has the perception to understand the little genius with the dark eyeswhoseexpression was so beautiful that she could hardly bear it and Ribierathe famous Spanish pianistwho warms the pianoin Antoine s wordsand calls the boy an intelligent apeby way ofexpressing his admirationAll these people are drawn with consummate skillI think one of the most poignant passages in the bookto meis Antoine s description of how he had raté the solo at a London concertIt was at the end of the seasonand he had been harassed by a thousand needless frictionsThe first part had gone pretty wellthough I did not like how the Duchâtel soundedI thought that was the violinperhaps and a new roomIt was a bad roomprettybut stupid for the soundI heard much too muchso I was sure they were not hearing properlyThey were extremely stilland made a little clapping at the endI did not find it a good concertbut Wurst in the interval said it was very welland I should not excite myselfSo when I did notthen I was tiredand it seemed stupider than beforeAnd at last that thing camethe Mirski Capricewhich you know how detestableThe passages are hard in that thingbut I know themEvery morning I played them to Moriczso now I do not troubleAnd thenin the middle of itI heard Peter Axel playing wrongAnd I was frightened horriblyAnd I made him an awful frown for forgetting itand Peter was looking at meHis face was not happy like it generally isIt was like one of those worst dreamsAndof courseI stopped playingbecause it cannot be like thatAnd Peter saidGo back very quietlymak ing a lot of little passages and returning for me to finddo you see He gave you a chance to pick upeh said Philip And you couldn t Couldn t I would notI was furious awful I said a rude thing to Axel in passingand went off the estradeAnd they all clapped together down therebah though they knew it was not finishedThey were sorry I had stopped because they were people who like a difficult Capriceto be amused by itBut I was not amusedNor Petervery much He laughed sharplyDon tI saysaid PhilipIt s all over nowIt doesn t matterreallyEverybody forgetsnow and then I do notsaid AntoineI do not know how it is to forgetI know that thing I know all the little noteslong agobefore Moricz since yearsIt is not possible to forget a little concert piece that you know Did you go on again YesAfter Wurst had finished talkingI had toI should not have for my unclebut I had to for himHe was violentWurstHe said it was indigne and loche if I stoppedand a lot of other wordsHe was like a little dog barkingA man like Wurst does not raterHe does not know how that is doneHis head has all the big scores inside He did not see how it was for me to stand up on the estrade againwith quantities of beautiful people looking kindIt would have been so better if they had sifflilike here in ParisThe book closes on an unexpected and suggestive noteAntoinewho had always realized that his grandfather couldn t bear his beingdifferentin musichad taken quietly to composing the kind of things he lovedHe made a quintet in which Ribiera was given a brilliant piano partand which he thought beautifulextremelyBu t when they played it for himthough he was moved to cryhe found itsideasnot so good as he had thoughtWhereupon he plans to produce better ones in his new overtureSuccession is a masterpiece of artand Antoine is the most lovable and interesting character in new fictionThe Little Review The Meaning of Bergsonism LLEWELLYN JONES ERGSON S philosophy is the antithesis of the natural science view of the universe as mechanismIn that view the laws of nature are fixed sequences controlling matteror energyand the more complicated and faultless the mechanism the higher the lifeJust how this mechanism became conscious of the fact that it was a mechanism caught itself at itselfso to speakand announced the laws of its own being is a question as puzzling as the old theological one of the aseity of God which is simply a Latinized way of asking how the deity couldbeing infiniteturn himself inside out in such a manner as to become aware of his own existence and attributesIn factthe two questions are one and the sameAccording to Bergsonmechanism not only cannot explain consciousnessbut it is the very antithesis of conscious lifeBehind mechanism he places an inextinguishable but not uncheckable vital urge with endless potentialities and with no fixed goalThe progress of this elan vital is through resistance to matterwhich is simply the reversal of its own movementThe onward urge is what Bergson calls pure duration or motionand its collision with its own reverse movement is what appears to us as spaceThe actual situation of life at any given time is simply a modus vivendi between this spiritual activity striving to be freeand the reverse movementWe knowof coursethat the physical universe is simply energy running downJust as a glass of water cools offso the sun dissipates its heatand sowe are learningthe elements break up into simpler formsgiving off their contained energy in the forms of heat and electricity as they do soBut on the other hand the plant takes unto itself that energy of the sunand with it builds up again the inorganic salts from its soil into higher forms with a greater content of stored energyWhat the plant doessays Bergsonis typical and symbolical of what all life does at all timessets up a reverse current to the running down tendency of the universe of matterLife cannot do this easilybut has to adapt itself to the resistance of the downward flowIt does this through its motor reactionsits sense organsand above all through its intelligence when that is evolvedThe evolution of these things gives us our ideas of spaceThe insect cuts up its environment into spatial forms easy for it to deal withMan with different sense organs probably lives in a different space worldAsa thing is where it acts it is obvious that the boundaries of things in the material realm would be quite different if we hadfor examplesome sort of sense organ adapted to identify things by their electrical propertiesBut this identifying of things by spatial and material conceptsthe mathematical order is instrumental to the ends of actionand the original consciousness of lifewhile it in eluded the potentialities of intellectual knowledgewas instinctiveInstinctaccording to Bergsonis first hand knowledgebut knowledge incapable of conceptual extensionIt is therefore no use in the practical affairs of lifebut certain and immediate in its apprehension of the actual flow of life itselfIn its broadened form of intuition it is responsible for all the valid and original insights of the philosophers and poetsThe structural and dialectic forms in which philosophies have been given to the world The Little Review are simply the intellectualizing process which philosophers have used to buttress and which they have often thought producedthe insight which was prior to and independent of the systemBergson s doctrine has been seized upon by apologists for every creed and for every iconoclasmBergson has been accused of every intellectual crimefrom being the intellectual father of syndicalism to being the last rich relative of struggling obscurantismThe protestant theologians talk glibly of Bergson s idea of Godand use him as a stick with which to beat the hated materialistBergson himself would never apply his philosophy to the uses of the syndicalistsThe argument of the syndicalists themselves is simply an ingenious parody of the Bergsonian philosophyas it is so far developedAs mechanism and the mathematical orderthey saydo not represent lifewe cannot by the means of natural and sociological sciences predict in advance what life will doand what forms it will takeW e cannot base revolutionary actionfor instancealong Marxian linesbecause the whole Marxist philosophy rests upon the assumption that life is the slave of material forces chemical firstlyand economical in the human dramaand that it will therefore follow along predetermined linesIf life is anelan vital breaking its path as it goesand only able to think in terms of the pastthen revolutionary activity must cut loose from the reactionary intellectand trust itself to its instinctsfight its way to that freedom which is impossible in the mathematically determined intellectual realmand which is equally impossible of achievement by mere intellectual foresightSo the syndicalist in the name of Bergson cuts loose from all theories of the future he wishes to bring inpreaches the general strikefor its stimulating effect on the emotions of the proletarian constituents of his socialelan vitalquite careless of whether it would ever be a practical success or not and deliberately cuts loose from all forms of bourgeoise culture But the anti revolutionists point out that Bergson does believe in the intellect as a guide to the practical affairs of lifeand industry and production the field of the syndicalist are far more mechanical than they are vitalIn man s industrial relations he has to approximate himself as much to the machine as possibleand for Bergson s anti intellectualism to be applied to this particular realm of life is as great a calamity as could happen to the doctrineAnd then these conservatives proceedless justifiably perhapsto train the captured gun of intuition upon the syndicalistsThe racial intuitionsthey sayare older than the race s newly found intellectual conceptionsFor generations the race has lived by certain instinctive rules of conductReligioncustomand patriotismthese are all sacred because they are extra intellectualand they dare us to disturb these sacred thingsIt is a strange sight this most revolutionary philosophical doctrine being used to support all the prejudices that the ages have handed down but we cannot deny that it is a plausible use of intuitionismand a more legitimate use than that to which Sorel and his followers have put the teachings emanating from the College of FrancePerhaps the most detailed application that Bergson has yet made of his philosophy to the affairs of life is his application of its principles to the puzzling aesthetic problem of laughter and the comicHis theory is that laughter is a social corrective directed against the man who allows the dogging steps of mechanism to overtake him and imprison his spirit in a web of meaningless actionThe man who is walking along the street The Little Review should be goingin a determinate direction with a determinate end in viewand with the ability to get there in spite of reasonable obstaclesSo says societyWhen he becomes abstractedwalks mechanicallyand in consequence falls over a brickwe laugh at himHe has permitted himself to become a machine for the nonce instead of a self conscious spiritand society cannot afford to have its interests jeopardized in that wayThe International Journal of Ethics for January 1914 contains an article by JWScottwho accuses Bergson of ethical pessimism on the grounds of his view of the comicHe points out that the psychology of comic actionas Bergson works it outis precisely that of moral actionFor in moral actiontooa man does what is habitualwhat is against his own self conscious impulsewhat is mechanical in that it is a fixed course of conduct pursued without reference to the favor or disfavor of the environmentThe life impulse must behe convicts Bergson of sayingadaptable to its circumstances it must insert itself between the determinisms of matterit must pursue the crooked path where the straight path is too difficultIt cannot follow its moral ideal without making itself ridiculousas indeed in real life moral people are always doingThis criticism hangs on the acceptance of a moral idealand if we must have an ideal in the sense of a goal beckoning us from the futurethen the criticism is well founded and Bergson is an ethical pessimistBut systematic ethics have been denied by other philosophers before Bergsonand most people of modern temperament are quite willing to let the whole question of a priori ethics dropThey might not be willing to exchange it for the very unpoetic utilitarianism which has so often been offered in its placebut Bergson offers something more than thatIf he be an ethical pessimisthe is not a religious pessimistOf religion he has not yet spokenexcept incidentallyObviously so long as he uses the scientific method in his philosophyproceeding from facts to their subordination in a picture whose values are given by intuitionshe cannot present a systematic philosophyBut in spite of the fact that pessimism not only in ethics but in his view of the content of personality and its relations with the universe is charged against himBergson means to be decidedly optimistic in his treatment of personalityIn his article in The Hibbert Journal for October1911occur these remarkable wordsIf thenin every provincethe triumph of life is expressed by creation ought we not to think that the ultimate reason of human life is a creation whichin distinction from that of the artist or man of sciencecan be pursued at every moment and by all men alikeI mean the creation of self by selfthe continual enrichment of personality by elements which it does not draw from outside but causes to spring forth from itselfIf we admit that with man consciousness has finally left the tunnelthat everywhere else consciousness has remained imprisonedthat every other species corresponds to the arrest of something which in man succeeded in overcoming resistance and in expanding almost freelythus displaying itself in true personalities capable of remembering all and willing all and controlling their past and their futurewe shall have no repugnance in admitting that in manthough perhaps in man aloneconsciousness pursues its path beyond this earthly lifeOn the other suppositions of Bergson s philosophy this is by no means so far fetched as are most theories of immortalityFor the consciousness which cuts out the patterns of our spatial life here could easily cut out others in the beyondlike enough to our present ones to carry on the continuity of our active existenceThe idea of survivalor an idea that may be applied to transmundane survivalis suggested by Laurence The Little Review Binyon in a recent volume of poems entitled Auguries He writesAnd because in my heart is a flowing no hour can bind Because through the wrongs of the world looking forth and behind I find for my thoughts not a closenot an endWith you will I follownor crave the strength of the strong Nor a fortress of time to enshield me from storms that rendThis is lifethis is hometo be poured as a stream as a songThis is quoted not only because it represents the poetical realization of Berg son s messagebut because it points to one reason why the charge of pessimism Instinct and Clarence Darrow recently echoed that high estimate of instinct at the expense of intelligence which has been the fashion since BergsonSome of these dayswhen that case has been overstated often enoughthere will be a return swing of that pendulumThe instinctive waspwhoin order to paralyze itknows how to sting a caterpillar as though she knew its anatomy may not always seem in all respects superior to the human surgeon who does actually know anatomy and can ap has been brought against Bergson even in this connectionIf only progress is our homeif there be no stabilityhow is that permanence of values to be achieved which Hoffding declares to be the essential axiom of religionWe may love our faithful dogbut according to Bergson it represents an evolutionary blind alleyWe may create as we willbut we shall survive our creationsHereafter allis at the best a tempered optimismNo reunions are promised in the Bergsonian paradiseOnly a perpetual streaming that does notso far as Bergson has yet told usand that is an important pointever wind safely home to seaIntelligence ply that knowledge in a thousand waysversus the wasp s oneSome day it will strike some one that no creature has an instinct against poison comparable in delicacysubtletyand fullness with a chemist s noninstinctiveintelligent knowledge of poisonsand nonpoisonsSo with a number of thingsThe pragmatic objection to our present glorification of instinct is that it tends to become a glorification of intellectual whimGeorge Cram Cook in The Chicago Evening PostThe Little Review The Jewels of a Lapidary Emerson s Journals Houghton Mifflin least nine events of permanent historic interest have occurred in American literature within the past few years they are represented by the publication of nine volumes of Emerson s JournalsThose who are trying to achieve a personal religionwhich acknowledges God as an immanence instead of a propositionhail with a quiet joy every extraction from the great mine in which Emerson stored the jewels of his lifeIf we do not recognize them as lapidarious we must perceive them as the better metals of ourselvesfor thisfriend and aider of those who would live in the spiritinhumed those spiritual values which all men at some time or another seek as their ownEmerson buoys us up for our common struggles and makes us conscious of that aid which is the awakening of latent powerHe composed the bricks which thousands of builders have used in fashioning beautiful personal templesI dot evermore in my endless journal he wrote to Carlyle the arrangement loiters longand I get a brick kiln instead of a house Speaking of his philosophical work he confesses aformidable tendency to the lapidary style and addsI build my house of boulders Emerson s published journals are kilns and quarries from which the foundation materials for the edifice of character have been obtained by countless buildersIf he could not construct a system of philosophyas Arnold allegeshe could and did provide thebouldersand indicate the pattern which others have usedHe is a part of every well read Volume IX1856 1863 CompanyBoston Americanandchiefly through Carlylestill lives in the land of his forefathersHe was an inspiration to Whitmanone of whose specimen days closed with a long and blessed evening with Emerson Such evenings are as real now as in Whitman s timeand are more commonly experiencedfor Emerson is westward boundHe has traveled slowly in this direction boulders are not carried by exploiters and pioneers who build and live in a world not of the spirit but of the sensesWith the establishing of easier communication between centers of thought and fields of action in AmericaNew England boulders were brought hitherto chink the crude walls of western lifeand it is a token of Emerson s vitality and spiritual universality that his bricks and boulders are discoverable in all sorts of shacks which men are trying to improveLumber decaysbut boulders remainand some of them become talismanicIn reading and re reading Emerson s Journals one is impressed with their remarkable quotabilityand in this mechanical handiness of his work we have a partial explanation of the slowness with which it has been assimilatedBoulders are fated to be knocked about before they are appreciatedWe throw them at one another with a sort of physical dexterity untilburnished and transformedthey are recognized as adapted to higher usesWe do not flippantly quote or mention the authors who have become personal to us I quote Emerson s Journal as a blessed soliloquyDCWThe Little Review New York Letter GEORGE HE most interesting hours of the last week I have spent in listening to discussions of the futuristsSomeone told of a superb incident recently reported of a speech by Marinettithe enunciator of the futurist philosophyMarinettiafter denouncing the past in his usual methodproceeded to eliminate women from his world But said someonehow will you continue the human raceWe will not continue the human race rejoined Marinettiwith superb éclatDaring and magnificent utteranceButafter allperhaps he is the only sane oneand the norm of human intelligence quite insaneThat fits in well with the recently reported discovery of a Paris scientistthat all variations in the course of evolution are the result of diseaseand that there would have been no man had not some ape had a parasite in his thyroid glandAll of which goes to show that I was right in my statementwhich Chesterton probably has said before methat all logical extremes are illogicalsince the world is based on an eternal paradoxReally it is quite simple to follow the futurist line of thought once you get the hang of itFor instance two developments of painting predicted at the TroubetzkoysIn the firsteach plane in the cubist pictureinstead of being coloredis to be numberedand the numbers printed in a catalogue opposite the names of the colors for which they standThus any approach to the vulgar intrusion of realism would be avoidedand abstract beauty furtheredWhat chances for the imagination And think of the subtle possibilities in the mathematics of color One could surely express by some abstruse quadratic a color quite beyond SOULE the realm of visual possibilityand thus man by one gigantic tug at his bootstraps would pull his soul out of its finite limitationsThe second school was aptly named the auto symbolistsIn this school Nietszchean individualism attains its sublime extremeThe artistinstead of expressing his spirit in the vulgar symbols understood by everybodyarbitrarily chooses a symbol known only to himselfIf he wishes to depict a determined man going up a mountain on a mule s back he may paint a mouse trapT o him the mouse trap perfectly expresses the particular feeling he has when viewing his own mental image of the picture he has decided to paintWhat matter about anybody elseIf you ask him cui bonohe will reply why any bono at all Andof coursehe is perfectly logicalAnd the satisfying aristocratic aloofness of his position If people as they surely willstudy his mouse trap and discuss in vain what it portendsif they pay vast sums for his pictures and start a literature of criticisms to guess his unguessable riddlesso much the betterHe can laugh at them with diabolical gleeEverybody is a fool but himselfand he can go on creating in the seventh circle of his own soul undisturbed by the barnyard cackle of the worldHas the cubist literature of Gertrude Stein awakened echoes in Chicago have read it without understanding before thisBut one night my host a greatstronghumorousintelligent hulk of a manhimself a scoffer at cubism read part of her essay on Matisse so that it was almost intelligibleHis inflection and punctuation did itHer chief characteristics seem to be an aver The Little sion to personal pronouns and a strict adherence to simple declarative statementsuntroubled by subordinate clauses or phrases of any kindHer thoughtthereforeresolves itself awkwardly in a four square wayThe multiplicity of her planes becomes confusing after a pagebut each plane stands aloneThusI quote inaccuratelySome ones knew this one to be expressing something being strugglingSome ones knew this one not to be expressing something being strugglingThis one expressed something being strugglingThis one did not express something being struggling Whichof courseis the cubist way of saying that Some thought he was trying to express struggle in an objectothers thought the contraryAs a matter of facthe sometimes did express struggle sometimes he did not But it seems her early work is now getting too obviousso she is in the throes of a later phaseIn her Portrait of Miss Dodgeshe has eliminated verbs and sentence structure entirelyflinging a succession of image nouns at the readerOne can surely not accuse her of prettiness The craze for colored wigs of coursean outgrowth of futurismWhy should a man be any color except that which his will dictatesThis has longa few monthsbeen the cry of the painterand the smart set has echoed Review Why should heWomen in green and blue wigs have been seen in New York alreadyButof courseit would be senseless to stop there if one has an orange toupé he

clear that it may be taken as an introduction to the study of philosophy Trenton TimesNietzscheto the average manhas been little more than a name a sort of synonym for turbulence and violence of a nature not clearly understoodTo suchthis book will be welcomeIt gives enough of both sides of the question of individualism to enable the reader to judge intelligently the principle of theOvermanGreensboro Daily NewsNIETZSCHE The appearance of aphilosopher like Nietzsche is a symptom of the timesHe is one representative among several others of an anti scientific tendencyThe author here characterizes him as a poet rather than a thinkeras a leader and an exponent of certain unruly and immature mindsThough his philosophy is severely criticisedthough it is weighed and found wantinghis personality is described not without sympathy and with an appreciation of his geniusHis predecessorMax Stirnerand other kindred spirits less known than Nietzsche are also introducedand if the reader adopts the author s views he will condemn the tendencies and thoughts of these erratic philosophers but at the same time appreciate their aspirations and love them in their very errorsThe fundamental error of them all is an extreme individualism which regards every single person as an absolute autonomous sovereign beingwhile a consideration of the origin of personality proves them to have originated within and under the influence of the social surroundings of communities from which they cannot be separated and of which they are and will forever remain partsIn this relation of the individual to society lie the roots of ethicsThe individual cannot cut himself loose from his social surroundings without doing harm to himselfand the rules which this interrelation imposes upon the several members of society constitute an obligation which we call duty Established in 1887 The Open Court Publishing Company Scientific and Educational Books 122 South Michigan Avenue CHICAG O The
