And with closed eyes I hear the moan  Of solemn winds round naked crags  Of Colorado s mountains The snow  Lies deep about me Gray and old  Hags of cedars gaunt and bare  With streaming tangled hair  Snarl endlessly White winged and proud  With stately step and queenly air  A glittering cool and silent cloud Upon me sails The wind wails  And from the canon stern and steep  I hear the furious waters leap   A GRAY SUNSET  She sits to watch the evening sun Her gnarled hands folded on her knees Upon her hair the river breeze Lays light cool palm Her work is done She rests as one who fears to rest With chin upthrust she seems to wait A summons some dread footstep at the gate Her breath scarce lifts her lean bent breast  Her wayward sons are all afar Her daughters drudge for tired men Her husband s grave lies up the glen And she the sport of some grim star Sits there alone with dim dull eyes Of what she dreams I cannot tell Her pains have fitted her for hell Her deeds should lift her to the skies  It seems God cursed her at the start She was foredoomed to toil and pain She has no higher prize to gain Than rest and endless quietude of heart Hunger and solitude the agony of birth The numbing dulness of the daily task She has not shunned she does not ask Her God to free her from the earth    TO A CAPTIVE CRANE  Ho brother Art thou prisoned too Is thy heart hot with restless pain I heard the call thy bugle blew Here by the bleak and chilling main Whilst round me shaven parks are spread And cindered drives wind on and on And at thy cry thy lifted head My gladdened heart was westward drawn  0 splendid bird your trumpet brings To my lone heart the prairie springs  THE MOUNTAINS ARE A LONELY FOLK  The mountains they are silent folk  They stand afar alone And the clouds that kiss their brows at night Hear neither sigh nor groan  Each bears him in his ordered place As soldiers do and bold and high They fold their forests round their feet And bolster up the sky  Hamlin Garland    THE COMING OF HIPPOLYTUS  SCENE A high Tower overlooking the sea  Phaedra The singing women move about the streets With gold between their breasts their garments sway About them with little murmurs as a wind Murmurs through the deep heart of a forest Broken and fugitive and soft Their song Is but the wind s murmuring turned to song Nurse is it happiness that bids them sing Who sing to welcome thus my lord s return  The Nurse Wilt thou not also greet King Theseus  Phaedra Nay for the heat lies heavily upon me The white heat the intolerable heat The heat which has sucked my soul away from me Which melts the stone even See it lies Palpitating along the balustrade I cannot raise my head to sweep away This lock which presses heavily on my forehead I cannot turn my head nor raise my eyes Beyond the shadow on the further wall See the great golden banner how it droops There is no veil betwixt the earth and sun How should I rouse myself to meet the King  The Nurse So shouldst thou show more fair in the King s sight Phaedra Let thy shadow fall between me and the sun   The Coming of Hippolytus  Speak not to me of Theseus Am I not Phaedra God s daughter Is not my face white Consumed and wasted as a funeral pyre Because the blood beneath it burns it to ashes Like flakes of fire my days are falling from me Visibly one by one since God has wrought Fearfully his being into mine And what have I to do with mortal man  The Nurse Yet art thou wedded to Theseus and his wife And meet it is thy soul should bend to him  Phaedra Why did no god come to me Am I then Less fair than my sister who was loved of a god Is not my heart wild enough and my love Are not its wings strong and tempestuous Wide reaching and far roaming o er hill and sea Enough to satisfy any god s desire Am I not too a goddess half revealed Through a close clinging veil of irksome flesh Which tortures me till I would fly beyond The furthest barriers of the confined world Does not sharp fire sting me in hands and feet  The Nurse Thou art ever restless thus yet turn thy gaze From the proud heavens which have no care for thee  Phaedra For me there is no comfort I am wrought With doubtful blood for me there is no rest Not in heaven nor yet among the shades   Certainly not on earth How amongst men Or gods shall such as I find comfort How In whom the god s wars with the woman s blood Who even in death shall be a twofold thing  The Nurse Yet art thou Queen here thy will made thee Queen  Phaedra It was the will of Theseus made me Queen Who being blind loved me and I was blind And saw only the gold shining round his brows And saw the brow beneath was calm as death And no ambiguous light in the calm eyes And I said his calmness shall be to my soul As twilight soothing with grave hands the sea Now is my soul like a rag torn in shreds  The Nurse Lovest thou not King Theseus  Phaedra I can hate I can no longer love And who am I To be bound thus to the slow wheel of earth I can hate as a god hates whom men forget All men all gods but mostly my lord the King Who has brought me weary love and a dull heart  The Nurse This cup is evil drink thou not of it  Phaedra This cup is evil I will drink deep of it I am outcast from love Let the sea rage And the rain beat on the brown earth pitilessly It shall not rage nor be pitiless as I  The Nurse Thou art a child whose quick and petulant speech   The Coming of Hippolytus  Scatters thy soul like sparks Do I not know thee And how thou wert ever thus yea and wouldst spurn With thy uneasy hands even my breast  Phaedra Oh peace How weary am I of mortal  speech And of the gods who love me not but I Equally hate them Nay there is one I love One goddess Aphrodite I have sought Her temples with white gifts and gifts of fire Prayers which gushed forth like blood from a pricked  wound Yet she hears not nothing she recks of me The Nurse She is a dangerous goddess speak not of her Phaedra Why wilt thou tarnish life with thy grey  tongue Her only do I worship I will go At once and offer sacrifice Prepare Wine and spiced cakes and myrtle wreaths and flowers For all my soul is eager to wait on her  The Nurse Yet canst not meet the King  Phaedra Let the King be Nay but I am weary nay I will not go I tire of Aphrodite even of her And of all things and of my most impotent heart Which dares not stop from beating Would I were Strong like that fierce limbed Queen Hippolyta The King once loved who rules the clamorous tribe   Of Amazons gaunt women with one breast Who war with men and conquer Yea and Theseus Brings does he not even now from that far land The son she bore him grown a man to plague us The gods alone know wherefore  The Nurse It may be This son shall prove a son to thee and bring Unto thy manifold heart comfort and love  Phaedra To me shall he bring no comfort How  should one Sprung from King Theseus bring me comfort Yet Surely a strange soul must be his conceived In a womb not used to child bearing and reared With dangers for his play fellows since birth Among the forests and dark scattered rocks The winds with wings like shadows and the fierce Sun burning the highest pinnacles of the hills  The Nurse Behold they come and lo King Theseus brow Is cloudy seeing thee not crane forth thy head  Phaedra She advances to the balcony and looks over  Ah he is straight as a young sapling a tree Shining white in a dark wood I have seen his eyes Once in a wild dream I had once and his lips A little cruelly curved like a drawn bow His hand which would not spare though it should smite Her he loved yea deeper because he loved her   The Coming of Hippolytus  Would he smite and no pity dim those eyes of his  I hate him from the bottom of my soul The Nurse Wilt thou not go to meet thy lord Phaedra I hate  Him from the bottom of my soul Give me My veil and crown I go to meet my lord  Margaret Sackville    THE PROCESSION  Paven gray  The triumphal way Clove the plain like a javelin head Circled the hill in a broad progression And up to the white acropolis sped Waiting the feet of the great procession It lay to the noonday sun outspread  Ninety columns of rough hewn granite  Edged the way in a lordly line Rocks hewn down From a mountain crown  In giant ages by kings divine Each the leap of a man might span it Towered as high as a forest pine  Dust looms gray  Down the pillared way Foaming to gold where the sun breaks in They are coming The noise grows deeper and duller See through the great blocks out and in Flashes of sharp and insolent color Leap through the crowd with the marching din  The rumor thickens a fear wonder Neighings and shouts and the tramp that casts   The Procession  Like a smoking pyre  The white dust higher The pikes are clustered like harbor masts The chariot wheels on the pavement thunder And the horses leap at the trumpet blasts  The heralds troop  In a serried group The long bright shafts of their trumpets rise Like sun rays over a mountain shooting Fire on the bright brass flashes and flies Fierce as the raucous music bruiting Triumph up to the holloing skies  Banners wavered with lazy flappings  Over the tall crests dancing there Like beasts afraid The long horns brayed  Harsh through the hot and dusty air And greens and scarlets of robes and trappings Threaded the rocks with a sultry glare  Now they strode  Up the mounting road Their rich barbaric music sounding Tawny and fierce till it shrank and paled As the carolling cohort dwindled rounding The curve of the hill and its echoes hailed Far from the loftier crags rebounding   Fires from the foundering sun ship curdle  Westering cloud banks High and afar The marching lines On the curved inclines  Gleam like a string of jewels that star The breast of the towering hill they girdle With emerald ruby and golden spar  In the phoenix glow  Of the sunset lo A crown of fire was the far seen crowd High on the terraced summit swaying The hill that rose to the evening cloud Stood like an altar where after the slaying Flames of the offering leapt and bowed  And over that ocean of men impassioned  Men whom the current of life bore high In the great repose Of godhead rose  Throned august in the golden sky From the pure white splendor of marble fashioned The porch of the Temple of Victory  M D Armstrong   THE IRISH FAIRIES  When Eber came to Kerry When Guaire gave his gold Then were we young and merry Who now are old  The green and the gray places Then were they green and gray We saw but shining faces And open day  We saw but shining faces The sickle moon of night White queens in royal places And jewels bright  We heard but beauty spoken Red war and passion sung Music on harp strings broken When we were young  What is the morning plougher To us whose ancient dream Is as a fallen flower Upon a stream   POETRY  The glen travails with ploughing That once was green and still The sower follows sowing Over the hill  THE PUCA  The Puca s come again Who long was hid away In cave or twilight glen Too shy too proud to play Under the eve of day  I saw him dance and skip But now in the beech wood Wild rhymes upon his lip And laughter in his blood I envied him his grip Upon the sunny mood  Then altered he his note To one of weariness He shook his hairy coat The double of distress And cried deep in his throat For gall and bitterness   The Puca  The Puca s gone again To sleep his wits away In cave or twilight glen Too shy too proud to stay Under the eye of day  Joseph Campbell  NOTE The Puca seems essentially an animal spirit Some derive his name from poc a he goat and speculative persons consider him the father of Shakespeare s Puck On solitary mountains and among old ruins he lives grown monstrous with much solitude and is of the race of the nightmare W B Yeats Fairy and Folk Tales of the Irish Peasantry  PASSE ROSA  Cecelia del Balzo wife of Amadeus IV Duke of Savoy was so called in the twelfth century throughout all Europe  More beautiful than roses Eight centuries have rolled Their hundred cycles o er you And still we may adore you  Reading the printed pages where your history is told  More beautiful than roses O lady dear and dead The daughters of a strange new race Ponder on your amazing grace  And picture your white hands and sunny head   More beautiful than roses You have been dead so long Where is the sweet white breast of you And where the golden crest of you  And where the men who bled for you fighting through right and wrong  More beautiful than roses Upon your grave today The violets that were your eyes Are smiling to Aosta s skies  Eight hundred years ago you went that way More beautiful than roses Sometimes your eyes were  filled With bitter tears you might not shed And now your griefs and you are dead  And yet through Time the crucible your perfume is distilled  Louise Driscoll    POEMS  ANCORA  Good God They say you are risqué O canzonetti We who went out into the four A M of the world Composing our albas We who shook off our dew with the rabbits We who have seen even Artemis a binding her sandals Have we ever heard the like 0 mountains of Hellas  Gather about me 0 Muses When we sat upon the granite brink in Helicon Clothed in the tattered sunlight O Muses with delicate shins O Muses with delectable knee joints When we splashed and were splashed with The lucid Castalian spray Had we ever such an epithet Cast upon us  SURGIT F AM A  Fragment from an unwritable play  There is a truce among the gods Korè is seen in the North Skirting the blue gray sea In gilded and russet mantle   The corn has again its mother and she Leuconoë That failed never women Fails not the earth now  The tricksome Hermes is here  He moves behind me  Eager to catch my words  Eager to spread them with rumor  To set upon them his change  Crafty and subtle  To alter them to his purpose  But do thou speak true even to the letter  Once more in Delos once more is the altar a quiver  Once more is the chant heard  Once more are the never abandoned gardens Full of gossip and old tales  THE CHOICE  It is true that you say the gods are more use to you than fairies But for all that I have seen you on a high white noble horse Like some strange queen in a story   Poems  It is odd that you should be covered with long robes and trailing tendrils and flowers It is odd that you should be changing your face and resembling some other woman to plague me It is odd that you should be hiding yourself in the cloud of beautiful women who do not concern me  And I who follow every seed leaf upon the wind They will say that I deserve

veins who now Moving among the trees and clinging in the air she severed Fanning the grass she walked on then endures  Gray olive leaves beneath a rain cold sky   LUSTRA  I  O helpless few in my country O remnant enslaved  Artists broken against her A stray lost in the villages Mistrusted spoken against  Lovers of beauty starved Thwarted with systems Helpless against the control  You who can not wear yourselves out By persisting to successes You who can only speak Who can not steel yourselves into reiteration  You of the finer sense Broken against false knowledge You who can know at first hand Hated shut in mistrusted  Take thought I have weathered the storm I have beaten out my exile   Poems  II  The little Millwins attend the Russian Ballet The mauve and greenish souls of the little Millwins Were seen lying along the upper seats Like so many unused boas  The turbulent and undisciplined host of art students The rigorous deputation from Slade Was before them With arms exalted with fore arms Crossed in great futuristic X s the art students Exulted they beheld the splendors of Cleopatra  And the little Millwins beheld these things With their large and anaemic eyes they looked out upon this configuration  Let us therefore mention the fact For it seems to us worthy of record  III Further Instructions  Come my songs let us express our baser passions Let us express our envy for the man with a steady job and no worry about the future  You are very idle my songs I fear you will come to a bad end   You stand about the streets You loiter at the corners  and bus stops You do next to nothing at all You do not even express our inner nobility You will come to a very bad end  And I I have gone half cracked I have talked to you so much that I almost see you about me Insolent little beasts Shameless Devoid of clothing  But you newest song of the lot You are not old enough to have done much mischief I will get you a green coat out of China With dragons worked upon it I will get you the scarlet silk trousers From the statue of the infant Christ at Santa Maria  Novella  Lest they say we are lacking in taste Or that there is no caste in this family  XENIA  I The Street in Soho

speakers naked in the sun untrammelled  Ezra Pound   EDITORIAL COMMENT  RHYTHMS OF ENGLISH VERSE  I  MISCONCEPTION of this subject is so  general that it may be useful to clear the  ground by some consideration of its ele  ments Not only the school rhetorics  but textbooks of prosody like The Art of Versification by J Berg Esenwein and Mary Eleanor Roberts Home Correspondence School still insist as a rule that the rhythm of English verse is as they put it accentual in contradistinction to the rhythm of classic verse which they pronounce quantitative Even Mr George Saintsbury in his ponderous three volume History of English Prosody refuses to take sides in the battle of Accent versus Quantity which is as if one should preface a treatise on astronomy with a refusal to decide whether the earth goes around the sun or the sun around the earth  Since Sidney Lanier musician and analyst as well as poet wrote his Science of English Verse there is no longer any excuse for persistence in the old error Rhythm is rhythm and its laws are unchangeable in poetry in music in the motion of tides and stars in the vibration of sound waves light waves or the still more minute waves of molecular action Always and everywhere  rhythm is measured movement a regular succession of time intervals English verse is as quantitative as Greek verse because its primary rhythms depend quite as essentially upon the time values of its syllables upon its marshalling of long and short syllables in feet of a given length while its secondary rhythms its phrase movements mark off with larger curves longer time intervals The fact that in English the syllabic quantities are more changeable than in Greek and Latin makes no difference with this essential truth our verse also is quantitative even though the Greek ear may have demanded more exactness in length of syllables while the English ear permits our poets greater liberty in making many syllables long or short at will Nor does our use of accent rhyme and other devices some of them unnecessary to the Greek poet make any difference  Accent is universal in human speech though slight in certain languages while rhyme alliteration etc merely mark off and emphasize rhythmic intervals  The best way of clearing our minds of error is to think of verse in terms of music We have been told so persistently that an English foot consists of a given succession of accented and unaccented syllables that it becomes less confusing to discard the word foot altogether and use instead the musical term bar Perhaps it would be a good thing if we could also discard the old terms iambic trochaic anapaestic dactylic etc and classify poetic measures merely as three time or four time For   Editorial Comment  this is the fundamental difference and a recognition of it would make us free to analyze as many varieties of movement in each as there are in music In modern poetry as in modern music the tendency is toward increasing freedom and variety of movement in both the bar and the phrase involving closer and more extended intervals and subtler cadences The music of Messrs Debussy and d Indy is paralleled by the poetry of Messrs Vildrac Romains and other young Parisians and in English by that of the Imagists and others But at present we are analyzing not the new measures but the old as the iambic should be studied before vers libre Nor can the secondary rhythm the grouping of bars together in phrases be considered until the movement within the bar is clearly understood  All English poetry is in either three time or four time that is each bar counts three beats or four for the language does not admit of the five beat measure found infrequently in oriental poetry If we continue using the old terms the three time measures are the iambic each typical foot or bar consisting of a short and a long syllable to be indicated by an eighth and a quarter note the trochaic the trochee reversing the iambus and the tribrach consisting of three short syllables represented by three eighth notes The four time measures are the anapaestic each anapaest being two short syllables and one long the dactylic one long and two short both these measures being varied by the spondee a foot of two long   syllables The long syllable consumes in utterance twice as much time as the short and in English usually though not always it carries a slight stress or accent All the above measures are varied by rests inversions etc exactly as in music and there are four time measures still unnamed which may hardly be classed as either anapaestic or dactylic  In a poem as in a piece of music the first technical point to be noted is the time is the piece written in three time or four time Does each bar count three beats or four The musician is always informed for the kindly composer states his time at the beginning of his opus as openly as he states his key but the reader of poetry has to find out for himself whether a given poem is in three time thus belonging usually to the great iambic class which includes probably ninety nine hundredths of all English verse or in four time so belonging usually to the much smaller anapaestic class  Having discerned the measure of the poem one may analyze the poet s lines exactly as the composer analyzes and writes down in notes the air which floats through his mind One will need most of the musician s materials that is one will need quarter notes and eighth notes and sometimes half notes and sixteenth notes quarter rests and eighth rests dots ties and triplets almost every device in short used by the musician for expressing time The expression of tune is not attempted here   Editorial Comment  Let us select for analysis one of the most beautiful strains of music in English verse Shakespeare s seventy first sonnet The typical bar is an iambus for example the bar for me in which the first syllable counts one beat and the second two The voice discovers in each line five bars followed by a pause of one bar the first two lines showing no variation from the iambic type while others vary widely as follows    The fourteen lines of this beautiful sonnet show almost all the variations of which iambic pentameter is capable A few others may be found in the first three lines of Hamlet s most famous soliloquy   Editorial Comment  In all these examples the voice pauses for the length of a bar at the end of each line but this circumstance though incidental in a large majority of lines is by no means a rule for all Blank verse both epic and dramatic often sweeps down line boundaries as in the following examples from Shakespeare and Milton  Besides this Duncan Hath borne his faculties so meek hath been So clear in his great office that his virtues Will plead like angels trumpet tongued against The deep damnation of his taking off  Of man s first disobedience and the fruit  Of that forbidden tree whose mortal taste  Brought death into the world and all our woe  With loss of Eden till one greater man  Restores us etc  In the common hymn measure with lines of four and three feet or bars alternating the voice always lengthens the short lines by a pause of one bar as in To the Cuckoo by Wordsworth   Readers will vary slightly from these formulae of course in minor details for example in the length of certain syllables but in general they will follow them rather closely Study of them will show that each bar like a bar of music takes the same amount of time for utterance as every other bar except that the reader like the musician varies the tempo in phrasing it will show that the succession of long and short syllables in these bars and also the position of the stress or accent varies almost as widely in poetry as in music that rests or pauses of varying lengths occur frequently sometimes even at the point of usual stress and more often than not to the length of an entire bar at the end of each line that a long syllable sometimes bridges two bars counting one beat in each and many other points too many to be mentioned  Thus far we have studied only the iambic measure which is so dear so natural to the English ear that until the time of Shelley and Coleridge other measures were rare in English verse being found only I think in early poems of the Piers Ploughman type and in certain ballads  and Elizabethan songs In a future article other measures will be discussed H M   A CONFESSIONAL  The Kingdom of All Souls and Two Other Poems by George Edward Woodberry The Woodberry Society  The most amazing feature of this small volume of poems is the preface It is at once a gloss upon the text and a confessional At least without this gloss the spiritual crises in the first poem and a large share of the spiritual intention of the other two poems might not be comprehensible yet to be exact the preface gives us so much more insight into the poet s mind that the poems are in reality a gloss upon the preface I shall quote therefore from both Mr Woodberry says  These three poems though written without reference to one another have a slight element in common which may perhaps excuse their being placed together in that they are all poems of expectancy in the mood of faith in the future They have a touch of prophetic conviction and that atmosphere of largeness of world hope which is a trait of our time  They are grounded in personal feeling and reality and the first of them is charged with specific allusions to my own experience which may not be sufficiently self explanatory The editor who published it for example desired more light on what I meant by the youth in the Sicilian mine whom he took to be a symbolical figure I seldom deal in symbolism if there be hidden meanings in my verses they are there without my knowledge  Mr Woodberry then goes on to give us his explanation of the obscure passages in The Kingdom of all Souls which explanation the editor of The Atlantic printed with the poem in order to protect the reader from the pitfall which he had found We follow his example  In the stench and murk of Sicilian mines I lost my ways of light For a youth with a torch came gazing on me with the nude archaic line That I loved in the marbles of Athens and the fire of his soul sank in mine   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  The woe of his eyes the want of his limbs the intimate look of his soul Who shall measure the wave of passion that from spirit to spirit may roll And year after year grew poverty dear and thereat I wondered then That my soul issued first unto wan lives accurst in the loveliest lands of men  What I actually saw is just what I say I saw The incident made a deep impression upon me I went down into a sulphur mine in a remote corner of Sicily It was pitch black except for our candles it was very hot Then this youth came along the gallery with his torch and went by but having seen me he came back to get some soldi He was naked as the others were practically and the light of his torch showed the figure in the darkness he was eighteen or less I should say and his pose as he held out his hand was as perfect as you can imagine for a simple action in which his body the place alt joined it was a perfect expression of poverty What struck me however was the extraordinary resemblance the lines of his figure bore to the archaic Apollos at Athens there is one at Naples in which the body seems stiffened in its material as if the artist could not free the form from the stone The living body was just the same stiffened in its lines just so and this youth so seen was as perfect a piece of archaic art as I ever saw It made an indelible impression on my eye and on my heart too  The second obscure passage follows  Then I said to my Spirit beside me tall I have fear this is some charm That the Impish Ones have wrought upon me to do me malignant harm That for the blood wasted and beauty blasted I lay bright worship by Hover above it sink in it love it tis some charm of the Evil Eye But my Spirit beside me gathered height in his pride Then as a greater wonder arose  Whereat my delicate being aloof with the horror thereof froze  For I saw in the den of a prison pen on a peak of Argos coast Men whom whips compel mould as in hell the matrix of the Host Murderers thieves and every brood of dark and heinous sin Forged in that shed the seal of God s Bread that stamps Christ s name therein  At the state prison at Nauplia in Greece the convicts fabricate an iron stamp which is used to imprint the Christian symbol IHS on the Faster bread I was very much shocked by that  The italics are not the poet s They are used to denote the state of partial salvation the contradictory   A Confessional  experience of a half awakened soul For the poem is obviously the tragic experience of a conventional soul facing unconventionality life The poet apparently has looked out upon life only through the eyes of others has looked upon life through a form of life already made static through the creative art of others And even the new shock of awakening consciousness is due less to individual experience than to the forceful suggestion of a master mind Mr Woodberry naively records this history and we learn with astonished amusement how things which are commonly supposed to be a poet s birthright have been acquired in this instance through patient apprenticeship  The thought toward the end of the poem past the sensual past the moral  contains a Nietzschean element which is found elsewhere in my later verse I picked up a volume of Nietsche then unknown to me quite by accident in a bookstore at Athens eight years ago and was so struck by it that I bought it The translation was in Italian La Gaia Scienza I afterward bought and read all his works and little sympathetic as I am with the doctrines of the Super Man by which he is most known there was much in his discursive mind which was kindred to my own solitary musing and brooding in those Mediterranean years I felt him like the call of a voice in the unknown before me fear I am less one of the million We Americans than of the few Us Europeans I was always doubly conscious Le Voyageur et Son Ombre and my heart at least has knowledge Par delà le Rien et le Mal Aurore might have served as the title of this little book and if I have not talked with Zarathustra there are those in our small company who have Nietzsche was an original and powerful genius perhaps with the eccentric proud wilfulness of a natural leader of men s minds I know no modern thinker with such a fire flow in him the vital burst la vie I think of him as what I have found most rare in life either among men or books a companion on my way 7 dare say J should have found him in real life quite impossible but safely walled apart by time and space and death we are friends in the spirit From him too as you already observe I took the title of the third poem  Ah those minds whom in real life one would doubtless have found quite impossible One can not help wondering how Nietzsche in real life would have found Mr Woodberry or how safely walled apart by time and   space and death with what keen satiric zest he may not now view this naive token of kinship  Not the least surprising thing about Mr Woodberry s book apart from the unconscious humor of the preface is the metrical echo of Edgar Allan Poe in the poems Here too is a spirit whom judging from Mr Wood berry s biography of Poe he would doubtless have found quite impossible in life But life shocks Mr Woodberry even though he turn to art to soften it art that has been drawn as it were from the very entrails of life as it is always drawn He does not realize apparently that there are other men besides murderers and thieves men whom whips compel who mould as in hell the matrix of the Host  A C H  ANNOUNCEMENT OF PRIZES  The prize of two hundred and fifty dollars offered by the guarantors of POETRY for the best poem published
