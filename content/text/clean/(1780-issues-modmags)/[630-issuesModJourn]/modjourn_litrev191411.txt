has repudiated his English honorary degreesand now Thomas Hardy has placed on Nietzsche the responsibility for the destruction of the cathedral of RheimsThe tragedy of nationalismit seemsis not content with ruining lives and artit must also vitiate philosophy and culture Nietzsche and his followersTreitschkeVon Bernhardiand others writes HardyIn the next sentence he speaks ofoff hand assumptions One is tempted to write Christ and his followersCzar NicholasKaiser Wilhelmand othersNietzsche has been claimed as a prophet by hereditary aristocratsby anarchistsby socialistsby artistsand by militaristsThere is even a book to prove that he who called himselfthe Antichristwas a supporter of the Catholic ChurchOne suspectshoweverthat the Jesuit who wrote it had a subtle sense of truthThe most fundamental truth about Nietzsche is that the torrent of his inspiration is open to everyone who can drink of itHis valuehis qualityconsist not in the fact that he said this or thatbut that life in him was strong and beautifulThis is true of all prophets how much more sothenof the one who threw to the winds all stiffness of orthodoxy and insisted on a transvaluation of all valuesO my soulto thy domain gave I all wisdom to drinkall new winesand also all immemorially old strong wines of wisdom said ZarathrustraBut even in his teachings we can find no justification of the present shame of EuropeIt was Darwin who laid the foundation for the philosophy of the survival of the fittest and the struggle for existenceWith the shallow inferences from these conceptions Nietzsche had no patienceIf the fittest survivesthe fittest is not necessarily the bestThe brute force which makes for survival had no attraction for NietzscheHe called upon man s will to make itself the deciding factor in the struggleWhen he argued for strengthhe argued for the strength of the beautiful and noblenot strength for its own sakeOf what avail is a great individual to the world if he makes himself weak and sacrifices himself to an inferior enemyThe French gunners who defended the Cathedral of Rheims might justly claim the approval of NietzscheIf the Allies had turned the other cheek and allowed their countries to be overrun by German militarismthey would then have proved themselves Christian and truly anti NietzscheanMoreoverNietzsche uncompromisingly opposed the supremacy of mere numbersthe supremacy of non spiritual valuesHe argued after the war of 1870 that the victory of Prussian arms endangered rather than helped Prussian cultureCulture is a thing of the spirit it was undermined by the tide of smug satisfaction in the triumph of militarismThe Little Review 5You say that a good cause will even justify warI tell you that it is the good war that justifies all causes wrote NietzscheIt is the logic of the newspaper paragrapher which makes this statement a justification of militarismThe good war what is thatIt is the quality of heroismthe unreckoning love of beautythe pride of the soul in its own strength and purityIt is the opponent of mere contentment and sluggishnessIt is the militant virtue which has inspired great souls since the beginning of the worldit is the hope of future manIf a cause is not justified by the good war what can be said for it It is a pathetic absurdity to think that Nietzsche would have found the good war in the present struggle for territory and commercial supremacyNogentlemen of lettersfight the Kaiser if you mustbut do not aim your clods at the prophets in your hasty partisanshipFor it is in this very Nietzsche and his good war that mankind will now find its spirit of hopeW e who see that wars of gunpowder are evilwe who intend to abolish themcannot do so by denying our own strength and appealing helplessly to some external power in the skyWe must say with Zarathustra How could I endure to be a manif man were not also the composerthe riddle readerand the redeemer of chanceT o redeem what is pastand to transform everyIt wasintoThus would I have itthat only do I call redemptionWill so is the emancipator and joy bringer calledthus have I taught youmy friendsIn Ecce Homo the wordGermanhas become something like his worst term of abuseHe believes only in French cultureall other culture is a misunderstandingIn his deepest instincts Nietzsche asserts to be so foreign to everything Germanthat the mere presence of a Germanretards his digestion German intellect is to him indigestionIf he has been so enthusiastic in his devotion to Wagnerthis was because in Wagner he honored the foreignerbecause in him he saw the incarnate protest against all German virtuesthecounter poison he believed in Wagner s Jewish descent He allows the Germans no honor as philosophersLeibnitz and Kant werethe two greatest clogs upon the intellectual integrity of Europe No less passionately does he deny to the Germans all honor as musiciansA German cannot know what music isThe men who pass as German musicians are foreignersSlavsCroatsItaliansDutchmenor Jews He abhors thelicentiousnessof the Germans in historical mattersHistory is actually written on Imperial German and Antisemitic linesand MrTreitschke is not ashamed of himself The Germans have on their conscience every crime against culture committed in the last four centuriesthey deprived the Renaissance of its meaningthey wrecked it by the Reformation Whenupon the bridge of two centuries of decadencea force majeure of genius and will revealed itselfstrong enough to weld Europe into political and economic unitythe Germans finally with theirWars of Liberation robbed Europe of the meaning of Napoleon s existencea prodigy of meaningThus they have upon their conscience all that followednationalismthe n√©vrose nationale from which Europe is sufferingand the perpetuation of the system of little statesof petty politicsGeorge Brandes inFriedrich Nietzsche The Little Review The Cost of WarCLARENCE DARROW Along with the many other regrets over the ravages of war is the sorrow for the destruction of propertyAs usualthose who have nothing to lose join in the general lamentationThere is enough to mourn about in the great European Holocaust without conjuring up imaginary woesSo far as the vast majority of people is concernedthe destruction of property is not an evil but a goodThe lands and housesthe goods and merchandise and money of the world are owned by a very fewAll the rest in some way serve that few for so much as the law of life and trade permit them to exactAt the bestthis is but a small share of the wholeAll the property destroyed by war belongs to the owners of the earth it is for them that wars are foughtand it is they who pay the billsWhen the war is overthe property must be re createdThisthe working men will doIn this re buildingthey will work for wagesThenas nowthe rate of wages will be fixed by the law of demand and supply the demand and supply of those who toilThe war will create more work and less workmenTherefore labor can and will get a greater share of its production than it could command if there was less work and more workmenThe wages must be paid from the land and money and other property left when the war is doneThis will still be in the hands of the fewand these few will be compelled to give up a greater shareThe destruction of propertytogether with its re creation means only a re distribution of wealth a re distribution in which the poor get a greater shareIt is one way to bring about something like equality of propertya cruelwastefuland imperfect waybut still a wayThat the equality will not last does not matterfor in the period of re construction the workman will get a larger share and will live a larger lifeAs the war goes onthe funds for paying bills will be met in the old way by selling bondsThese too will be paid by the owners of the earthTruethe property from which the payment comes must be produced by toilbut if the bonds that must be paid from the fruits of labor had never been issued this surplus would not have gone to laborbut would have been absorbed by capitalThis is true for the simple reason that the return to labor is not fixed by the amount of productionthe rate of taxationthe price of interest and rentsbut by the supply and demand of laborand nothing elseIf labor shall sometime be wise enoughor rather instinctive enough to claim all that it producesit will at the same time have the instinct or wisdom to leave the rulersbonds unpaidThe Little Review 7 But all of this is farfar awayin determining immediate effects we must consider what isnot what should beAnd the jobless and propertyless can only look upon the destruction of property as giving them more work and a larger share of the product of their laborChicago was never so prosperousor wages so highas when her people were re building it from the ashes of a general conflagrationSan Francisco found the same distribution of property amongst its workmen after the earthquake and the fire had laid it wasteand her people were called upon to build it up anewCarlyle records that during the long days of destruction in the French Revolution the people were more prosperous and happy than they had ever been beforeTruethe Guilotin was doing its deadly work day after daybut its victims were very fewThe people got used to the guilotinand heeded it no more than does the crowd heed a hanging in our county jailwhen they gayly pass in their machinesAfter the first shock was overduring the four years of our Civil Warwages were highermen were better employedproduction greaterand distribution more equal than it had been at any time excepting in the extreme youth of the RepublicThen land was freeThen againthis world has little to destroyAfter centuries of so called civilizationthe human race has not accumulated enough to last a year should all stop workThe world livesand always has livedfrom hand to mouthThis is not because of any trouble in producing wealthbut because things are made not to usebut to sellAnd the wages of the great mass of men does not permit them to buy or own more than they consume from day to dayIt is for this reason that half the people do not really workthat the market for labor is fitful and uncertainand never great enoughand that all are poorAfter a devastation like a great warthe need of re creating will turn the idle and the shirkers into workmenbecause the rewards will be greaterThis will easily and rapidly produce more than ever beforeFrom this activityinvention will contrive new machines to compete with mengoing once more around the same old circleuntil the world finds out that machines should be used to satisfy human wants and not to build up profits for the favored few One may often regret the impulses that bring destruction of propertybut before any one mourns over the destruction of propertypurely because of its destructionhe should ask whose property it isThe Little Review

to be had beneath the grinning surfaceOne of them is the discovery of those rare persons to whom flippancies are impossible those splendid persons who take life simply and greatlySeveral months ago I tried to write an impression of Emma Goldmanfrom an inadequate background of having merely heard two of her lecturesSince then I have met herOne realizes dimly that such spirits live somewhere in the world history and legend and poetry have proclaimed themand at times we hear of their passingbut to meet one on its valiant journey is like being whirled to some far planet and discovering strange new gloriesEmma Goldman is one of the world s great people thereforeit is not surprising to find her among the despised and rejectedOf course she is as different from the popular conception of her as anyone could beThe first thing you feel in meeting her is that indefinable something which all great and true people have in common a quality which seems to proceed on some a priori principle that anything one feels deeply is sublimeThen a sense of her great humanity sweeps upon youand the nobility of the idealist who wrenches her integrity from the grimest depthsA terrible sadness is in her face as though the suffering of centuries had concentrated there in some deep personal struggleand through it shines that capacity for joy which becomes colossal in its intensity and tragic in its disappointmentsBut the thing which takes your heart in a gripand thrusts you quickly into the position of the small boy who longs to die for the object of his worshipis that imperative gift of motherhood which is hers and which spends itself with such utter prodigality upon all those who come to her for inspirationEmma Goldman has ministered to every kind of human being from convicts to society womenShe has no more idea of conservation than a lavish springtime and where she draws courage and endurance and inspiration for it all will remain one of those mysteries which only the artist can explainA mountain top figurecalmvastdynamicawful in its lonelinessexalted in its tragedy this is Emma Goldman the daughter of the dream as William Marion Reedy called her in an appreciation written several years ago A dreamyou say he askedafter sketching her gospel Yes but life is death without the dream In that rich book of Alexander Berkman sPrison Memoirs of an Anarchistshe is given a better name I have always called you the Immutable is the way the author closes one of his letters to herAnd this is the quality which distinguishes Emma Goldman a kind of eternal staunchness in which one may put his fundamental trust20 The Little Review This is the woman America has hated and persecutedthrown into jaildeprived of her citizenshipand held up as an example of all that is ignorantcoarseand baseAmerica will recognize its failure some dayafter the brave spirit has done its work after the spasm of the new war has ushered in quite simply some of the changes which Emma Goldman has been pleading for during her years of fightingBut it takes education to produce such awakeningsand there is no immediate hope of such a general enlightenmentThe stupidity of the situation regarding Emma Goldman is that other prophets have raised their spears to the same heights and have been misunderstood or ignored but not outraged by the peculiar ignorance which Americans alone seem capable ofHad Ibsen appeared among us to lecture on the Tightness of Nora s rebellion or to denounce the pillars of society as he did in his writinghetoowould have been thrown into prison for free speech or accused of a president s assassinationThe cruelty of the situation regarding Emma Goldman is that she has so much work to do which so many people needand that she cannot break through the prejudice and the superstition surrounding her to get at those dulled ones who need it mostTen years ago she was preachingunder the most absurd persecutionideas which thinking people accept as a matter of course todayNow the ignorant public still shudders at her nametheintellectualsespecially those of the Greenwich Village radical type dismiss her casually as a sort of good Christian one not to be taken too seriously there are so many more daring revolutionists among their own ranks that they can t understand why Emma Goldman should make such a stir and get all the credit the Socialists concede her a personality and condone her failure to attach herself to that line of evolutionary progress which is sure to establish itself Unscientificis their damning judgment of herher Anarchism is a metaphysical hodge podgethe outburst of an artistic rather than a scientific temperamentAnd so they all miss the real issuenamelythat the chief business of the prophet is to usher in those new times which often appear in direct opposition to scientific predictionand this above all that life in her has a great grandeurHow do such grotesque misconceptions ariseWhy should it have happened that all this misapprehension and ignorance should have grown up about a personality whose mere presence is a benediction and whose friendship compels you toward high goals you had thought unattainableThere is no use asking how or why it happened it is a perfectly consistent thing to have happenedfor it happens to everyonein greater or less degreewho strives for a new idealBut if I could only get hold of all the people who are unwilling to understand Emma Goldman and force them to listen to her for an hour what a sweet triumph comes with theirOhbut she s wonderfulAnd now about her ideasIf you have read Wilde s Soul of Man The Little Review Under Socialism you know the essence of Emma Goldman s AnarchismWhat is there about it to cause an epidemic of terror It is merely the highest ideal of human conduct that has ever been evolvedWellit is possible to get even the prejudiced to admit this muchNearly everyone can see that government in its essence is tyranny that one human being s authority over another is a degrading thingthat no man should have the power to force his neighbor into a dungeon on the flimsy pretext that punishment is a prevention and a protection that no man should dare to take the life of another manon any basis whatever that crime is really misdirected energy andcriminal typesusually sick people who should be treated as suchthatabnormalpeople are those who have not found their work that people who work should have some share of their production that the holding of property is a source of many evils that possessiveness andbargainingare mean qualities that co operation and sharing are splendid ones that there should be an equality between giving and takingthat nothing worth while was ever born outside of freedomand that men might live together on this basis more effectively than on the present oneEven yourreasonableman will grant you this premise but then he plays his trump card It may all be very beautiful of course it isbut it can never happenOscar Wilde answered him in this way Is this UtopianA map of the world that does not include Utopia is not worth even glancing atfor it leaves out the one country at which Humanity is always landingAnd when Humanity lands thereit looks outandseeing a better countrysets sailProgress is the realization of Utopias Emma Goldman believes thisShe does not belong with the rank and file of AnarchistsCults andismsare too restrictive for her But you are an extreme Individualist the Socialists tell her NoI am not she answers them I hate your rigid Anglo Saxon individualismIt is just because I am so deeply social that I put my hope in the individual It is because she hates injustice of any sort so passionately that she adopted Anarchism as the soundest method of combating itIf you have laws you must accept the abuses of lawWhy not be more completely simple why keep on pretending that we need a machinery which fosters tyrannies instead of giving freedom an unhandicapped path to begin upon its great responsibilitiesThis was the idealism upon which the American founders built a minimum of governmentat leastwhen that evil seemed to become a necessityIn her remarkable book that has just been publishedVoltarine de Cleyre discusses this phase of the matter brilliantly in a chapter calledAnarchism and American Traditions There is no possibility of going into it minutely hereexcept to ask those who insist upon regarding Anarchism as an unconstructive force to read itThese are the things Emma Goldman is trying to preachShe does not expect to see a new order spring up in response to her vision so the face22 The Little Review tious ones who poke their stale jokes at the unspeakable humor of a communistic society might save their wit for more legitimate provocationsAll she hopes is to quicken the consciousness of those through whom such changes will come to improve the individual qualityIt reminds you of Comte s suggestionat the time when he fell deliriously in lovethat all the problems of society could be solved on that divine principleIt is like Tolstoy s dream prophecy his prediction of the time when there will be neither monogamy nor polygamybut simply a poetogamy under which people may live freely and beautifullyAnd so Emma Goldman continues her worktalking passionately to crowds of peoplesickened by audiences who listen merely out of curiositydisheartened by the vapid applause of those who make their own incapacities the burden of their rebellionheartbroken by the masses who cannot respond to any idealcheered by the few who understanddedicated to an eternal hope of new valuesThis is the real Emma Goldman a visionistif you willbut at the same time a woman with a deep faith in the superiority of reality to imaginationHo w she has lived lifeHo w gallantly she makes the big out of the little and accepts without complaining the perverted role which has been thrust at herTo have seen her in her home with its hundreds of books and its charming old pictures of Ibsen and Tolstoy and Nietzsche and Kropotkin to have seen her friendsher nephews and nieces offering her their high adoration to have watched her gigantic tendernessher gorgeous flinging away of self on every possible pretextto have listened with her to great music in a kind of cosmic hush that music is made by and for such spirits to have heard her the crucified talk of the ideal she cherishes and how her expression of it has been so far below her dreamto have compared heran artist in lifeas incapable of spiritual vulgarity as a Rodin or a Beethovenwith a sensitiveness which makes her almost fear beautywith a sweetness that is overwhelming to compare her with the vulgarians who denounce her is to fall into a mad rage and long to insult them desperatelyI said before that Emma Goldman was the most challenging spirit in AmericaBut she is so much more than thatshe is many wonderful things which this article merely touches uponbecause it is impossible to express them allScience is after all but a reassuring and conciliatory expression of our ignoranceMaeterlinckThe Little Review Poems MAXWELL BODEXHEIM Expressions of a Child s Face

slantingcambric curtain of his soulAnd stirred it to low songThe Spiritual Dangers of Writing LibreEUNICE TIETJENS The spiritual dangers that beset a struggling poet are almost as numerous as his creditorsand quite as rampantAnd woe unto him who falls a prey to any one of them For poetrybeing the immediate reflection of the spiritual life of its authordegenerates more quickly than almost any other form of human expression when this inner life goes astrayThere is first of all the danger of sentimentalityan ever presentsticky danger that awaits patiently and imperturbably and has to be met afresh every dayTrueif the poet yields to this danger and embraces it skillfully enoughthe creditors aforementioned may sometimes be paid and much adulation acquired into the bargain witness Ella Wheeler Wilcox but it is at the price of artistic deathThere is the danger of giving the emotions too free reinof producingas Arthur Davison Ficke has said in a former number of THE LITTLE 26 The Little Review REVIEWmerelyan inarticulate cry of emotionwhich moves us likethe crying of a child Much of our sex poetry is of this typeOn the other handthere is the equally present danger of becoming over intellectualizedof drying up and blowing away before the wind of human vitalityEdmund Clarence Stedman went that wayThen there is the danger of determined modernityof resolutely setting out to bevitalat all costs and crystallizing into mere frozen impetuosityas Louis Untermeyer has done and the other danger of dwelling professorially in the past with John Myers O HaraThere is too the new danger ofcosmicality of which John Alford amusingly accuses our American poets of to dayAnd there are manymany other pitfalls that the unsuspecting poet must meet and bridge before he can hope to win to the heights of immortalityBut there seems to be a whole new set of dangersespecially virulentthat attend the writing of vers librefree versepolyrhythmicsor whatever else one may choose to call the free form so prevalent to dayThese dangers are inherent in the form itself and are directly traceable to itFor contrary to the general notion on the subjectit takes a better balanced intellect to write good vers libre than to write in the old verse formsIt is essentially an art for the sophisticatedand the tyro will do well to avoid itThe first of these dangersand the one in which all the others take rootis a very insidious periland few there be who escape itIt is the danger of being obviousIn writing rhymed or even rhymeless poetry of a conventional rhythmical pattern the mind is constantly obliged to sift and sort the various images which present themselves to test themand turn them this way and thatas one does pieces in a mosaictill they at last fit more or less perfectly into the patternThis processalthough it sometimesowing to the physical formation of the languagedistorts the poet s meaning a littlehas the great artistic advantage of eliminating many casual first associationswhich on careful thought are found not worth sayingIt is precisely this winnowingweighing process which the form of free verse lacksAnything that comes to mind can be said at onceand with a little instinct for rhythmis saidThe result of this mental laziness is that the ideas expressed are often obviousBut here a curious phenomenon of the human mind comes into playJust as a physically lazy man will often perform great mental exertions to avoid movingso the mind will frequently go to quite as great lengths to find unusual methods of expression to concealeven from itselfthis laziness of first thinkingThe result is the attempt to cover with words the fundamental paucity of the ideasThere are several principal effects which may result from thisOne is brutalityA conception whichif spoken simplyis at once recognized as tritemay if said brutally enough pass muster as surprising andstrong The Little Review A crude illustration of this is to be found in the recent war poetry ofmangled formsandgushing entrails Ezra Pound furnishes the most perfect exampleAnother effect is the tendency to the grotesqueThis device is more successful in deceiving the poet himself than the otherthough it has less general appealFor it is possibleby making a thing grotesque enoughto cover almost completely the underlying conceptionSkipwith Cann√©ll runs this dangeralong with lesser menA third peril is that which besets some of the Imagistes the danger of reducing the idea to a minimum and relying entirely on the sound and color of the words to carry the poemStill another result of the complete loosening of the reins possible in vers libre is the immediate enlargement of the egoIt is not so easy to see why this should resultbut it almost invariably doesand has since the days of WhitmanIt usually goes to day with the effect of brutalityThe universe divides itself at once into two portionsof which the poet is by far the greater half I I Ithey sayand againIII And having said it they appear to be vastly relievedThe next step is to lay about them gallantly at every person or tendency that has ever annoyed them I have been abusedthey say I have been neglected You intolerable PhilistinesI will get back at youIt is odd that it never seems to occur to these young men that they can only hit those persons who read themand that every person who reads them is at least a prospective friendThose who neglect them they can never reach and slapping one s friends is an unprofitable amusementExamples of these unfortunate spiritual results of abandoning oneself too recklessly to the free verse form are numerousJames Oppenheim s latest volumeSongs for the New Age although it is in many ways an excellent work and deserves endorsement by all who really belong to the new age and are not merely accidentally alive to day nevertheless shows in places the tendency to obviousness and slack workMore flagrant examples are to be found elsewhereTake for instance Orrick JohnsHere are some stanzas from his long poemSecond Avenuewhich took the prize in Mitchell Kennerley s Lyric YearHow often does the wild bloom smell Over the mountained city reach To hold the tawny boys in spell Or wake the aching girls to speechThe clouds that drift across the sea And drift across the jagged line Of mist enshrouded masonryHast thou forgotten these are thineThat drift across the jagged line Which youmy peoplereared and built To be a temple and a shrine for gods of iron and of giltThe Little Review Ayethese are thine to heal thy heartTo give thee back the thrill of YouthTo seek therein the gold of ArtAnd seek the broken shapes of Truth The same Orrick Johns wrote this blatant bit of free verse in Poetry a few months laterBoth the pauctiy of ideas and the enlarged ego are very well shown here No man shall ever read meI bring about in a gesture what they cannot fathom in a lifeI tell Bob and Harry and Bill costs me nothing to be kindI am a generous adversarybe not deceivedneither be devotedis because I despise youif any man claim to be my peer I shall meet himthat man has an insolence that I likeam beholden to himknow the lightning when I see itthe toad when I

broadly surveys the history of humanityAll the great turning points of that history seem to be inwardly associated with violent upheavals and fearful revolutionsAnd of all these revolutionsit may be doubted whether history records any one on so large a scale as that which confronts us under the name of Christianityin the transition from ancient to mediaeval ecclesiastical cultureIt was not a single Crucified One that gave Christianity the sacred symbol of its religion unnumbered thousands mostly slavesbreathed out their poor lives on martyrscrossesThe old culture went down in rivers of blood not too figuratively meant and a new aroseorbetterwas createdNowwhat is true of this most important revolution of our antecedent cultural life is true alsoin corresponding measureof every newbecomingin the history of peoplesNo stateno churchno social formhas ever arisen but that the path of the new life has passed over ruins and gravesMust this be soMust it be eternally soIs it a thing of historical inevitabilityis it even a law of the very order of the world itselfThe answer first answerat all events isYes To affirm itselfto persist as lifethis belongs as nothing else does to life s very natureWhat newly arises negates what has already arisenAll that is living pronounces a sentence of death upon all that has been alive and that now sets itself against the new lifeAccordinglywe are wont to call life a struggle for existenceOld Greeks coined a phrasePolemos pater panton war is the father of all thingsThe right to life is the right of the strongIn view of these thingsmay we fairly raise the question as to whether there are exceptions to so universal a ruleWere we to set up a different rightwould it not be the right of the weak Would it not be to make the sick and the infirm masters over the well and the strongWould it not be to preach a decadent morality as do all the pusillanimous and the hirelings who beg for the protection of their weakness because they do not have the strength to drive and force their way through life The man whofor a generationhas been called the prophet of a new culturethis Friedrich Nietzscheis he notthenprecisely the apostle of this

our churches and stop our preachingas the first thing to be doneFor the churches preach goodness and lovenot might and dominionsee in man child of Godnot beast of preyIf all this were a partisan matter for or against Nietzsche I would have nothing to do with itTo join in the damnatory fulminations against this manor to advertise mitigating circumstances for his thoughtand to re interpret the whole from such a standpointuntil the whole should seem less brutal and less dangerous to do either the one or the other is not for mebut for those polemicists and irenicists who are adding to the gayety of nations in these otherwise heartbreaking timesby the high debate as to whether Nietzsche be both the efficient and the final cause of our present world warNot to defend Nietzschenot to condemn himbut to wrestle for a firmclearmoral view of life in our seething timesthis alone is most worth whileand this too is my taskBut for all thatI do believe we must penetrate muchmuch deeper into this new prophet s spirit than either friend or foe has yet doneif we are to win from Nietzsche a deepening of our own and our time s moral view of lifeWould that we might forgetfor a moment at leastall that partisan praise and blame have scraped together respecting this most modern of all philosophers would that we might accompany him into the most hidden workshop of his own thoughts and hearken to the personal confessions of his wonderful soulAnd what would we hear thereThis preacher of crash and catastrophe and cataclysmtemporal and eternalspeaking ofthoughts which come with dove s feet and steer and pilot the worldofthe stillest hours which bring the storm Zarathustra Nietzsche hears the Hollenlarmthe hellish alarumthat men make in lifethat life itself makes he observes how men lend their ears to this noisehow they are frightened by itor exult over ithow they think that the truth is the truer where the noise is the louderhow the howling of the storm signifies to men that something good and great must be taking placesome great event of history must be under wayThen Nietzsche sets himself like a flint against this evaluation of things The greatest experiencesthese are not our noisiestbut our stillest hoursIt is not around the inventor of new noiseit is around the inventor of new values that the world revolvesinaudibly revolves I speak for myself alonebut these are wordsNietzsche wordsfor which I would gladly sacrifice whole volumes of moral and theological worksThese words sharpen the eye and the ear for life values which the majority of men today pass by pass by more heedlessly perhaps than everThese great words supply us with a criterion for the evaluation of questions of the moral lifea criterion that no one will cast aside who once comes to see what it meansIt is a criterion without which we do not yet comprehend 34 The Little Review life in its depthsbecause we so constantly contemplate things from a false angle of visionSomething of the men who

interest to the excuses for the German Socialists who went to waras well as to the attacks on them for doing soNowthough hesitating to obtrude our ignorance into the muddle of a complicated discussionwe can t refrain from offering a suggestionThe bottom reason for sudden activity under the stress of unusual circumstances is to be foundnot in a conscious mental decisionbut in the previously formed habits of the individual mindW e are referring partly to the mob emotion which has swept away so many even of the greatest souls of EuropeW e are thinking more of the essence of Socialismand the sort of emotional method which has been produced among its adherents the material upon which mob psychology had to workThere is no essential difference between the method of German Imperialism and the method of German Socialismthe only difference lies in the objectivesBoth insist on the supreme importance of the stateboth work through cohesive organizatoin and the almost unquestioning following of leadersThe habit of obediencethe instinct for organizationthe gregarious mode of action these are the very qualities of the individual German which have made it possible for the German Social Democratic Party to grow to such size and strengthWhat more ineviatblewhen the mobilization order went upwhen flags flew and drums beatthan that the individual German Socialist should in his excitement shoulder his gun and march to war Of coursewe don t really know anything about itand we haven t the resources to make anything like a scientific investigationBut we strongly suspect that the morals of organized humanity will remain inferior to the morals of the individual until the individual habit of mind becomes one which denies to organized humanity supreme authority

acutely in a general sensePatriotic poetry is nearly always badIf there is a worthy reference to the Armada in Elizabethan poetryit has escaped meand the English resistance to Napoleon has never been a very happy subject for English writersThe good poetry that is provoked by war is of a different 46 The Little Review characterit is personalvisualand concreteIt never expresses any general aspect of warbut only such subjects as have been personally observed and felt by the poetI would give as instances Rudyard Kipling and the German poet Liliencronboth of whom have written well about soldiers and fightingbut foolishly about War and PatriotismYet any poet going about the streets today must see and feel a quantity of poetical thingsA week or so agoI saw an endless baggage train belonging to the artilleryas it passed through BarnetIt had come from Worcestercommandeering horses and wagons on the way it was going to Brentwood and thence God knows It was very long and uneven the carts had bakersand butchersnames on them the horses were ridden with halters and sacks for saddles the men were tired and dishevelledI spoke to one of them who was watering his horse at a troughoffered to bring him beer from a public house close bybut someone had given him tea farther back on the road and he would rotHe thanked me and rode awaydrooping very much over his horse s neckIt was all a poem in itself or it gave me the emotions of a poembecause it had none of the conventional glitter of warIt was poetical because it was business likejust as our khaki service uniforms are more beautiful than the bright clothes the troops wear in peaceIf the war poets would confine themselves to real and tangible things like thisthey might well express the experience through which we are now passingBut they seem unhappily obsessed with the idea of expressing an obstreperous valour and self confidence and bluster which the nation is very far from feelingThe nationso far as I can gauge itis showing an obstinateworkmanlike silence and does not either make light ofor grumble atthe hardships it has to suffer the baggage train of which I have spoken was a very adequate symbol of thisBut no one is ever so greatly out of touch with the people as a popular poetAt the beginning of the warthe musical in London were shocked by an announcement that no German or Austrian music would be played

BachMozartBeethovenWagnerand even Sch√∂nbergLuckily good sense and humour killed the absurd ideabut not before a French and Russian programme had been substituted for the first Wagner nightNowmuch as I shrink from the thought of having to hear Tschaikowsky instead of WagnerI do believe that we have a cause for national resentment against the second of these composersHis ridiculous and windy prose works have been among the writings which have provoked the warWith Nietzscheand with the renegade EnglishmanHouston Stewart Chamberlainhe has encouraged the notion that there is a special Teutonic culture which is superior to any other The Little Review 47 and which deserves to be spread at any costSuch an idea has never appealed to the true Germanseg Goethewho knew what he owed to France and

wait to let his good friend knowhad jumped on an elevated trainand after being carried two stations too far in his elationwas there with his prizeNothis is not the beginning of a magazine storynor is

his ownThe managerstrust put every difficulty in his wayand finallywhen the building was nearly done and the company was engagedsucceeded in crushing himThe next attempt was a repertory company on the East sidebut this wiped out what little was left of his The Little Review resources before it got fairly startedOne play was produced on Broadway it ran two weeksLast year another was rehearsed for nine weeksbut it was withdrawn on the day of the dress rehearsalbecause the author refused to make a change insisted on by the managerNow the writer has retired to his farm in the Connecticut hillswhere he and a companion have with their own hands built a little theatreIn thison Sunday afternoons during the summerhe reads from his fifteen manuscript plays to such few people as can get there to hear himAnd as he readsthere is on his face much the same enthusiasm as on the night years ago when he got his passage from HamletI visited Butler Davenport for the third time last SundayThe main house is a rambling mid Victorian affairwith queer crannies and cupola rooms from which one can look far across the hills to the SoundOn its left is an old farmhouse of the eighteenth centuryfurnished as MrButler s grandfather left itand with a musty smell which no old furniture shop could counterfeitBetween the two is an old fashioned gardenin midsummer filled with larkspurcosmosand a hundred other flowers which few but our grandmothers could nameAt the intersection of walks at its center is a crab apple treesurrounded by a benchA formal garden with highthick cedar hedgesbird housesunsuspected grass walks and an avenue of woodbine arches lies on the other side of the main houseIn the rearstretching out towards the wide valleyis a longhedged walk ending in an archbetween fields of wild flowersDown it one could go to any kind of distant mysteryThe theatre is a simplestrong little building behind the old farmhouseIts most expert bit of carpentry is the balconybut that isof courseunpretentiousThe seats are ordinary kitchen chairsand there is nothing on the stage but a reading deskBut the luxury of sitting between wide open doors in the hill breezefull of grass odors and wing soundsis better than the comfort of plush seats and much gilded frescoThis timehoweveras there were only four of uswe sat out under an apple treeExcept for a moment when a tragic passage was interrupted to shoo away a loud voiced and ill mannered henit was the most nearly perfect theatre I have knownAnd the playIt is impossible to do more than hint at the nature

reality is not artbut it is a bleeding chunk of reality your aesthetic emotions may sleep at the sight of a tortured animalbut your humane emotions will roll up to your throat when you witness the simple tragedy of a Jewish girl in StPetersburgpresented in Michael Morton s playThe Yellow TicketTo me such a realistic play in such a realistic The Little Review 51 presentation has as little to do with dramatic art as a reporter s story has to do with literature but I brushed aside my memories of Rheinhardt and Komissarzhevskaya when I went to see a piece of Russian life at Powers And I saw it indeed realnudeappallingSome of my acquaintances have asked me whether the tragedy could be truewhether a Jewish girl has no right to live in StPetersburgunless she has bought her protection from the police by selling her reputationthat is by procuring a yellow ticketthe trade licence of a prostituteYesit is trueA Jew is forbidden to abide outside the Pale of Settlementwith the exception of certain merchants and persons of a university educationand prostitutesThe latter form the most desirable element in the eyes of government officialssince their occupation does not generally presuppose any predilections for revolutionary ideas or free thoughtI have known instances where women involved in the Revolutiongentiles as well as Jewessesobtained yellow tickets which served them the r√¥le of a carte blanche from the molestations of the policeThere are many anecdotic facts in Russian life that seem incredible to the outsiderand MrMorton has produced in his play a mass of such facts with photographic verisimilitudeIt must be said to the credit of the actors that they have escaped the slippery path of melodramatic overdoingK Jael The Little Theatre Hosanna I felt like shoutingwhen the curtains slowly concealed the mysterious stageI am still under the spell of the oriental atmospherenot yet cooled off for objective criticismWhat Florence Kiper Frank has done with the biblical subject may terrify the orthodox student of the Biblebut I greeted her daring heresy and free manipulation of epochs and stylesShe has skilfully blended the bloodthirstygloating outcries of Deborah s Song with the idylic lyrics of Solomon s Songsand has presented in Jael a composite typea mixture of the savage tent womanof the passionate yet gentle Shulamiteand of the eternal jealous femaleThe resultas far as the creation of an atmosphere goesis a positive successA word about the stagingMaurice Browneon the privilege of a pioneermay be congratulated on the progress he has made in leaving behind mouldy conventions and approaching the state where he can produce pure aesthetic emotionsThe three one act plays on the present billregardless of their merits or demeritsdemonstrate the great possibilities of an artistic stage managerwho can do away with elaborate accessories and produce suggestive illusions with the aid of an ultramarine background and calico apple blossomsYetas in all pioneeringthere are signs of hesitation and of half measuresI am sure that the effect of Jael would not in the least The Little Review diminishit would rather be intensified if we were spared the inevitable storm pryotechniesThe verses in themselves imply the idea of battle and tempestand Miss Kiper in the title r√¥le has the voice and diction to serve the purposeKHarold Bauer in Chicago HERMAN SCHUCHERT There yet remain certain pianists and other opinionated craftsmen in music who will saywhen approached on the subject of Harold Bauer s piano playing Ohyesbut you know Bauer is wellshall we saya monotonistHis playing is all of one style beautiful toneto be sure butohsuch a sameness He shades beautifully yessurelybut it s all too colorless And it probably never occurs to these critics that a pianist who uses an entirely beautiful tonewho shades delicatelyand who is definitely individual in his playingmight not seem monotonous to the admirers of true piano artistryAnd it is quite certain that these carpers failed to attend Bauer s last Sunday afternoon recital in Orchestra Hallwhen and where the above composite quotation was put to shameThe program was headed by that most unequal set of little piecesinterestingdullgracefuland often clumsy Brahm s WaltzesThe Brahms faddists may sacrifice all the credit to their idolbut he deserves only a part of it for Bauer made these waltzes float as lightly and pleasantly as the material permittedand invested them with all possible contrast and pulseThere was no lack of what pianists callpoint either in this opening number or in the remainder of the program and it is this quality ofpoint which is the season more in evidence in Bauer s work than ever beforewhich makes the carpers appear rather uninformed Pointis nothing mysteriousit means definite and crisp rhythmbrightness of tone designed to contrast with richness and warmth of tonesharp shadings artistically brought outand a deeply satisfying precision in tempiThis man s work deserves this inclusive termWhatever lack there might have been in seasons pastthere has been a fragile foundation for the criticism mentioned at the beginning of this appreciationwhenas late as three years agohis tonal ideals apparently did not include great brilliance this Sunday recital went far to establish the fact that Bauer has a happy variety of tone colors at his commandwhich variety includes no little brillianceSheer facility and The Little Review 53 digital expertness have never seemed to occupy the attention of this master pianistexcept insofar as such facility and expertness would give expression to purely musical content and now if the carpers continue to shrug their shoulders at the praise of Bauerit will be because they miss the usual bombast and key swatting of esteemed mediocrityand certainly not because of any inadequacy of technic for musical purposesor lack of pianistic lustreNo mediocrity of a technic worshipper or piano eater ever gave a performance of Beethoven s Opus 3 that could compare with that of Bauer on Sunday afternoon for he then projected a deeply significant artparticularly in the first movement of the sonatawhich must be inexplicable in wordsSchumann s Scenes from Childhood were given a highly imaginative treatment a treatment which penetrated even the academicsAnd Schumann s Toccata that battered veteran of many an ivory struggle ceased for once to be an endurance stuntand hummed forthas the composer hoped and indicatedas a strangely beautiful bit of musicBauer s playing of this will remain long in the awakened music receptaclesSo will his interpretation of his own arrangement of Cesar Franck s PreludeChoraland Fuguewhich are three movements vieing with each other for supreme religious solidity and his nonchalant handling of the tricky D flat Study of LisztThe Chopin Scherzo in C sharp minor closed a program which would surely have been sombre and sleepy under the fingers of any less than a pianistic musicianIn certain splendid moments Bauer seems like a high priest performing a tonal miracleor like a potent magician weaving curious and impossible dream fabricsAndwith all pleasant fancies put asidehe is an exponent of modern pianism at its bestIn music a light blue is like a flutea darker blue acelloa still darker a thunderous double bassand the darkest blue of all an

sculptors in this city is working industriously without regard for applause from either the crowd or the fewJust as there are religious and social rebels people who refuse to accept the old dogmas and habits merely because they were successful at a certain time and fit for a certain period in human history these young artists refuse to adopt methods and views of the past for the purpose of expressing their views on modern subjectsIn striving to realize the new idea in form and color they are of necessity passing through that period in which the intellect discerns and style is chosen the period of experimentAnd if they do not achieve as great a success as the old mastersthey certainly work in the spirit of a Monet or a RembrandtW e print this month reproductions of work done by four

theGreat American Poet He has come so fast and far on the road to art and sanity since the early days when he drew minuteand seemingly pathologicalmaps of the territories of heavenand grinning grotesques of the Demon Rum He has carved his own way with so huge and careless a hand And his workin spite of its strangenessis so deeply rooted in the crude but stirring consciousness that is America to day Surely there is ground for hopeLike every artist who creates a new formMrLindsay has had to educate his publicAnd the task is not by any means accomplished yetWe have had to overcome an instinctive feeling that poetry should be dignifiedand to look the fact in the face that it must first of all be tellingand that in cases where these two elements conflictdignity is a secondary considerationW e have been rudely jostled out of our academic position that poetry must be condensedpoignantand literaryand we have been shown that by going back to the primitive conception which included as the principal element the half chant of the bard true poetry may be diffusefull of endless iterations and strangely impassioned over crude and even external objectsSo much we have learnedand after the first shock of surpriselearned gladlyIt has opened to us whole new reaches of enjoymentWe hope sincerely that we are not yet done with MrLindsay s educative processThe Congo is

FeminismFuturismFree Love This is perhaps a more succinct expression of his facility of faith than can be found in his verseReaders should thank him for itbecause it renders unnecessary any further attempt to discover what he believesAt the opening of the volumeMrKilmer quotes the following stanza from Coventry PatmoreMine is no horse with wingsto gain The region of the Spheral chime He does but drag a rumbling wainCheered by the coupled bells of rhymeThistoois usefulbecause it frankly warns us against looking in his verse for anything which is not thereWithin his self imposed

produced by a late suburban trainTo a Young Poet Who Killed Himself is an obvious rebuke to the small hearted versifierand Old Poets is a comfortable exposition of the philosophy of comfortThe religious poems will probably not be moving to anyone who does not share MrKilmer s creedMrKilmer s work is glossy with a simplicity more easy going than profoundThough he is young himselfhe obviously does not sympathize with young poetsof whom he writes There is no peace to be taken With poets who are youngFor they worry about the wars to be fought And the songs that must be sungHis ideal is that

Iconoclasm Artby Clive Bell Frederick AStokes CompanyNew York It is an exquisite pleasure to disagree with Clive Bell Like a fierce Hun he whirls through the art galleries of Europeand smashes all venerated masterpieces into a heap of rubbishsparing but the Bysantine Primitives and some of the Post ImpressionistsBetween these two epochs he sees a hideous gap not more than one in a hundred of the works produced between 1450 and 1850 is he willing to accept as a work of artIt naturally hurts to witness the slaughter of your old friendssuch as MichelangeloVelasquezWhistlerbut our Attila

Survey Modeen English Literature From Chaucer to the Present Dayby GHMair Henry Holt and CompanyNew York Good histories of English literature are rareand MrMair s book should accordingly be given a warm welcomefor it combines brevity with comprehensiveness of treatment in a very unusual mannerMrMair not only writes well and knows his subjectbut he seems instinctively to know what his readers will want and he supplies itFor instancewe do not remember that popular histories of English literature bother to tell such a detail as how the chronological order of Shakespeare s plays is determinedbut MrMair s telling of that will show The Little Review the layman just what literary scholarship meansand in conjunction with his other remarks on our knowledge of Shakespeare it will rescue the uninformed from the chance of falling into such errors as the Baconian theoryThe bookhoweveris not one of higher and textual criticism and chronologyIt is a work of appreciationand the appreciation is that of a modern manIt is obvious that Chaucer might be treated in a manner quite alien to the interests of the man of today who is not a scholarbut the treatment of his work which ends in joining his hands to those of Charles Dickens as workers in a kindred quest is one that is well calculated to persuade even the philistine that Chaucer is a figure of passable interest to himIt is the mark of the live man to recognize geniusand the manner in which MrMair treats the genius of that great poetJohn Donneis in vivid contrast to the way in which it is usually treated in histories of English literatureFor example Very differentis the closely packed style of DonnewhoMilton apartis the greatest English writer of the centurythough his obscurity has kept him out of general readingNo poetry in Englishnot even Browning sis more difficult to understandThe obscurity of Donne and Browning proceed from such similar causes that they are worth examining togetherIn bothas in the obscure passages in Shakespeare s later playsobscurity arises not because the poet says too littlebut because he attempts to say too muchHe huddles a new thought on the one before itbefore the first has had time to express itself he sees things or analyzes emotions so swiftly and subtly himself that he forgets the slower comprehension of his readershe is for analyzing things far deeper than the ordinary mind commonly canHis wide and curious knowledge finds terms and likenesses to express his meaning unknown to ushe sees things from a dozen points of view at once and tumbles a hint of each separate vision in a heap out on to the pagehis restless intellect finds new and subtler shades of emotion and thought invisible to other pairs of eyesand cannotbecause speech is modeled on the average of our intelligencesfind words to express them he is always trembling on the brink of the inarticulateAll this applies to both Donne and Browningand the comparison could be pushed farther stillBoth draw the knowledge which is the main cause of their obscurity from the bypaths of mediaevalismBrowning s Sordello is obscure because he knows too much about mediaeval Italian historyDonne s Anniversary because he is too deeply read in mediaeval scholasticism and speculationBoth make themselves more difficult to the reader who is familiar with the poetry of their contemporaries by the disconcerting freshness of their point of viewSeventeenth century love poetry was idyllic and idealistDonne s is passionate and realistic to the point of cynicismTo read him after reading Browne and Johnson is to have the same shock as reading Browning after TennysonBoth poets are salutary in the strong and biting antidote they bring to sentimentalism in thought and melodious facility in writingThey are corrective of lazy thinking and lazy compositionAnother feature in which this book differs from others of its kind is that the author is not afraid to bring the record down to the work of his contemporariesand the struggles of MrShaw with the bourgeois worldand the era opened by MJSynge and the Irish literary renascenceare here sympathetically dealt withLJThe

within an enclosed garden that she might never know the ways of man They told her that the bandage made her see more clearly than if her eyes were freeFor they had painted images upon the inside of
