ten dollars a year to its Fund The magazine began under a five year  endowment which expired Sept 30th I9 I7 and although the  endowment has been partly resub scribed for another period this Fund is insufficient and expenses are constantly increasing The art of poetry requires if it is to advance not only special sympathy from a discriminating public but also endowment similar to that readily granted to the other arts All who believe in the general purpose and policy of this magazine and recognize the need and value of such an organ of the art are invited to assist thus in maintaining it

hunter moon is chipping at his flints At his dripping bloody flints He is rising for the hunt And his face is red with blood From the spears of many spruces  And his blood is on the leaves that flutter down The Winter maker Beé bo an Is walking in the sky And his windy blanket rustles in the trees He is blazing out the trail   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Through the fields of nodding rice For the swift and whistling wings Of his She shé be For the worn and weary wings Of many duck Ho plenty duck plenty duck Ho plenty plenty duck  Hi Hi More slowly and quietly verging on a chant  Hi Hi Hoy eeeeé Ya Hoy eeeeé Ya Keetch ie Má ni dó Má ni dó  The seasons have been barren In the moon of flowers and grass From the blighted berry patches And the maple sugar bush The hands of all my children Came home empty came home clean And the big rain of Nee bin the summer maker Washed away the many little pa tridge And even Ad ik kum aig sweetest white fish Went sulking all the summer moon Hiding in the deepest waters Silver belly in the mud And he would not walk into my nets Ugh Thus the skin sacks and the mo kuks Hang within my teepee empty   Soon the winter moon will come Slower chant ris  ng to a watt  Slipping through the silent timber Walking on the silent snow Stalking on the frozen lake Lean bellied  Squatting with his rump upon the ice The phantom wolf will fling his wailings to the stars Then Wéen di go the Devil spirit Whining through the lodge poles Will clutch and shake my teepee  Calling Melancholy wailing from this point on higher and Calling higher in pitch  Calling as he sifts into my lodge And ghostly little shadow arms Will float out through the smoke hole in the night Leaping tossing shadow arms Little arms of little children Hungry hands of shadow arms Clutching Clutching Clutching at the breast that is not there Shadow arms and shadow breasts Twisting Twisting Twisting in and twisting out On the ghastly clouds of smoke Riding on the whistling

chanted monotonously in a high pitch with a downward inflection  at the end of every sentence and at other places where the voice naturally  falls  Hah eeeeeeeee oo oo oo oo oo oo oo oo My little Pigeon woman For you alone as I float in my little birch canoe in the  purple twilight I am singing I am calling on my little cedar lute tenderly  For you alone for you alone I am playing on my little yellow flute mellowly And though the singing of my throat is like the grumping of  the frog at night among the water lilies yet the notes from my cedar Pee bo an are like silver bubbles in the moonlight  Therefore why do you hide away from me like the timid  little fawn that peers tremblingly at me from yonder bending willows  My little Pigeon woman My Kah lee lee oh kah lay quay  Hah eeeeeeeee oo oo oo oo oo oo oo From the clouds of purple twilight on yonder shore  the wailing loon is calling calling calling for his woman drearily   And I am also calling on my little yellow flute wearily In the dewy glade of yonder valley the whip poor will is crying for his mate In the sombre lonely shadows of the timber the melancholy owl is also calling But the owl and the whip poor will do not hear an answer  to their many many callings Nor do I hear an answer to my melody The meadow lark is fluting his golden song  and from the lilied meadows other golden notes come floating back to him like little golden bells  And though the meadow lark does not sing more tenderly than my little yellow flute you do not answer my callings  My little Pigeon woman My Kah lee lee oh kah lay quay  Hah eeeeeeeee oo oo oo oo oo oo oo And now the purple wings of the night are softly folded  down upon my sleepy little lake and the sighing silver balsams  The cooing wood dove has slipped her head beneath her downy wings and the hermit thrush will pipe no longer   The eyes of the many little stars are peering down  upon me from the sky steadily And the wan and sickly moon is smiling yellowly at me I do not like the many little peering eyes  I do not like the smiling yellow moon I love the sun that dances down the sky with a swirl of scarlet robes and with her head flung back over her shoulder a taunting smile on her vermilion face  And now the flutings of my little Pee bo a n avail me no longer For you have flown away from me you have flown away  from me like the sun that slipped down behind the willows trailing her purple veils behind her on the shimmering waters of my lake and over the edge of the world  But tomorrow the sun will come back to me  the sun will come back tomorrow My little Pigeon woman My Kah lee lee oh kah lay quay  Lew R Sarett   PRAYERS AND FANTASIES  I  To have passed so close to annihilation and which is worse to have become stained so inalterably with the ideas and habits of masses this leaves me immeasurably discouraged out of love with myself  Now I am good only to mimic inferior masters My thoughts are stifling heavy grey dust from a scorched road For me silence or if speech then some humble poem in prose Indeed I am too conscientious or shall we say too impotent to dare the cool rhythm of prose the sharp edges of poetry  Nymphes de Parnasse Encore un Pégasse raté  II  Touch once again with the lips of thought the fair rigid limbs of goddesses men imagined beside the inland sea Give the life of our blood to one among them and worship in her oval of tremulous gold the beauty of that body whose embrace would murder us with ecstasy  Recall from Orcus the Foam born lady of many names make for her a broidered throne among the dusky colonnades of the soul Death a fierce exaltation sweeps from the lips of the conqueror but from hers gently a frail kiss breathes a savor of life   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  III  Slowly too slowly the night with its noise and its fear and its murder yields to the dawn One by one the guns cease Quicker O dawn quicker dazzle the hateful stars lighten for us the weight of the shadows  The last rat scuttles away the first lark thrills with a beating of wings and song The light is soft deliberately consciously the young dawn moves My unclean flesh is penetrated with her sweetness and she does not disdain even me  Out of the East as from a temple comes a procession of girls and young men smiling brave candid ignorant of grief  Few know the full bitterness of night but they alone will know the full beauty of dawn if dawn ever comes  IV  Life has deceived us The thoughts we found so vivid and fresh were dull and crass as the prayers muttered to a worn rosary by an infidel priest  The joy we felt in beauty our sense of discovery at the touch of some age green bronze even the sick horror at some battlefield where the flesh had not quite fallen from the shattered bones all this was old a thousand times felt and forgotten   i  And is the kiss of your mouth then but the reflection of dead kisses the gleam of your breast a common thing Was the touch of your hand but a worn memory of hands crumbled into cool dust  v  And in the end one comes to love flowers as women and women as flowers Beauty recoils from excess Imitate the wise Easterns and let a few sprays of blossom decorate the empty chamber of the soul and spread their fragrance through its recesses  Ah To retain this fragrance to make permanent this most precious of essences this mingling of suave and acrid perfumes something wild and tender and perverse and immortal I will make for myself from tempered silver an Aphrodite with narrow hips and small pointed breasts and wide brow above gay subtle eyes and in her hand shall be a perfume ball sweet with this divine fragrance  VI  Escape let the soul escape from this insanity this insult to God from this ruined landscape these murdered fields this bitterness this agony from this harsh death and disastrous mutilation from this filth and labor this   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  stench of dead bodies and unwashed living bodies escape let the soul escape  Let the soul escape and move with emotion along ilex walks under a quiet sky There lingering for a while beside the marble head of some shattered Hermes it strews the violets of regret for a lost loveliness as transient as itself Or perhaps by some Homeric sea watching the crisp foam blown by a straight wind it gathers sea flowers exquisite in their acrid restraint of color and austere sparseness of petal  There perhaps among flowers at twilight under the glimmer of the first stars it will find a sensation of a quiet almost kindly universe indifferent to this festering activity  VII  The gods have ceased to be truth they have become poetry Now only simple pure hearts and those who are weary of doubt believe Why not pray to the gods any god Perhaps even from the immensity of space will come a gently ironic echo  Dionysios lord of life and laughter from whom come twin gifts of ecstasy hear me  I pray the noble lacchos of reverent mien and wide tolerant eyes to look mildly upon me and to show me the mystery of beauty the mystery of vineyards the mystery of death   And I pray the young Dionysios the bearer of the fawn skin the charioteer of leopards the lover of white breasts to show me the mystery of love  And grant that nothing ignoble may render me base to myself let desire be always fresh and keen let me never love or be loved through ennui through pity or through lassitude  VIII  The moon high seated above the ridge fills the ruined village with tranquil light and black broken shadows ruined walls shattered timbers piles of rubbish torn up ground almost beautiful in this radiance in this quiet June air Lush grass in the tangled gardens sways very softly and white moths dart over the bending sprays  Somehow to night the air blows clearer sweeter the chemistry of earth is slowly purifying the corrupting bodies the waste and garbage of armies Sweetness darkness clean peace the marble rock of some Greek island piercing its sparse garment of lavenders and mints like a naked nymph among rustling leaves  Heavy scented the air to night new mown hay a pungent exotic odor ah phosfene And to morrow there will be huddled corpses with blue horrible faces and foam on their writhed mouths  Richard Aldington France I9l8    AFTERWARDS  Blow upon blow they bruise the daylight wan Scar upon scar they rend the quiet shore They ride on furious leaving every man Crushed like a maggot by the hoofs of war Gods that grow tired of paradisial water And fill their cups with steaming wine of slaughter  I fear a thing more terrible than death The glamour of the battle grips us yet As crowds before a fire that hold their breath Watching the burning houses and forget All they will lose but marvel to behold Its dazzling strength the glamour of its gold  I fear the time when slow the flame expires When this kaleidoscope of roaring color Fades and rage faints and of the funeral fires That shone with battle nothing left of valor Save chill ignoble ashes for despair To strew with widowed hands upon her hair  Livid and damp unfolds the winding sheet Hiding the mangled body of the Earth The slow grey aftermath the limping feet Of days that shall not know the sound of mirth   But pass in dry eyed patience with no trust  Save to end living and be heaped with dust  That stillness that must follow where Death trod The sullen street the empty drinking hall The tuneless voices cringing praise to God Deaf gods that did not heed the anguished call Now to be soothed with humbleness and praise With fawning kisses for the hand that slays  Across the world from out the fevered ground Decay from every pore exhales its breath A cloak of penance winding close around The bright desire of spring And unto Death As to a conquering king we yield the keys Of Beauty s gates upon our bended knees  The maiden loverless shall go her ways And child unfathered feed on crust and husk The sun that was the glory of our days Shining as tinsel till the moody dusk Into our starving outstretched arms shall lay Her silent sleep the only boon we pray  Iris Tree   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  MY TEN BUCKEYES  Two I will plant at the edge of our camp In the land where we go These they are four I will hold for the ridge That our pennon shall know I think yes I think that these three I will save on the chance That some of our boys may be called Far away out of France  One is left that is mine all alone See the number I bear And the regiment cut in the brown And this shall be there In my pocket Yes more it shall be In my heart as I go My State my own State my home State Where the buckeyes grow  Charles L Sherwood  SOMEWHERE IN FRANCE  Somewhere in France my heart is kept In a soldier s heart out there Last night I know not where it slept My heart in his heart s care   Isabel Howe Fiske  I know not if he slept at all  My man across the sea  I do not know if he will fall  Or come back safe to me  He has my heart That is my share My bit that I have sent out there  Isabel Howe Fiske  RAINY DAYS  Gray hills gray clouds gray faces at the pane Gray hearts that long for sunshine and blue skies The ceaseless rattle of the wind born rain Against bleak pavements All the roadway lies Sodden and glimmering with slow spreading streams Storm beaten into dullness and pale gray The hurrying footfall as it passes seems Half deadened by the falling rain Away In the drab distance looms the murmuring town Cloaked in vague outline misty and half seen  Its own lights hanging over it like a crown Pale in the waning afternoon How keen The wind that moans away its chilling flight Gray days gray hearts gray hurrying down of night  Shirley Harvey   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  REUBEN ROY  A little fellow brown with wind I saw him in the street Peering at numbers on the posts But most discreet  For when a woman came outdoors Or slyly peeped instead He turned away took off his hat And scratched his head  I watched him from my garden wall Perhaps an hour or more For something in his attitude The clothes he wore  Awoke the dimmest memories Of when I was a boy  And knew the story of a man Named Reuben Roy  It seems that Reuben went to sea The night his wife decried The fence he built before their house And up the side  He wanted it but she did not Because it hid from view   The spot in which her mignonette And tulips grew  Nobody saw his face again But each year unawares He sent a sum for taxes due And fence repairs  My curiosity aroused I sauntered forth to see Whether this individual Were really he  Who are you looking for I asked His eyes like two bright pence Sparkled at mine and then he said  A fence  Somebody burned it Hallowe en When people were in bed Before the judge could prosecute The culprit fled  Well Reuben only touched his hat And mumbled Thank you sir And asked me whereabouts to find A carpenter  Harold Craword Stearns   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  THREE POEMS  LAUGHING IN THE MOONLIGHT  Three women laughing In the moonlight In the night Eerie Strange With sound of water Thundering up the cliff With sound that comes from swaying boughs Of pine trees Giant pines of a virgin forest Fringe of wilderness The border Of a narrow strip of clearing On the bluffs  Laughing How their voices carry Fearlessly Such merriment As must awake the sleepy soul of the forest Merriment so mad How it carries Elfish laughter Far out over the wicked waters Peals and peals   Helen Louise Birch  And the moonlight wavers glitters Strokes their white throats with its poison Makes its streaks and streams of silver Cold and colder in its joy Sinks its sharp silver dappled shining moon fangs In their eyes  Laughing women Mad and merry Send their voices on the winds Calling destiny about them Calling to titanic powers Till their play And their lightness And their madness And their harsh and eerie laughter Rouses forces that through aeons Long have slept Slept and waited for a summons Deep enough Wild enough Light enough And evil enough To call them forth Slow they stretch their unused muscles Answer in a dawning smile  Three women are laughing in the moonlight In the night   And earth is reeling In light and shadow Air and water In some fearful manner Mingle With their voices All of nature throngs and rushes Into the vast Chaotic Drift of sound A world of maddened unchained souls Of wicked savage glee  Naked Earth Swings into consciousness Uncovered Sudden Reeling in light and shadow Through this hellish hellish laughter Through this wild Malicious Evil Evil Laughter   VERTIGO  What did you play  Or have such melodies no names  And were they played on ivory keys  Or did your fingers find a way  So touch by touch  To where the nerves of all my being  Stretched their uneasy length  Did I look deep into your eyes Or were mine closed When sudden vision of some new world Caught me in floods of light  I laid my hand upon your arm And felt the cool black curtain of your sleeve  Why when you left me Was I plunged in sorrow Weary of all known things Grey languid and too dull for thought  Slowly the moments passed While still I leaned Against the door which closed you out And felt no pain   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  AND SO THE DAYS GO BY  And so the days go by All filled with majesty and stateliness The eastways slant of the morning beams So fresh Turns subtly into noon And with a secrecy beyond belief The hours pass And the long rays slant into the west They tint the heavy phlox heads red like fire And make black shadow of the pale wild currant The hills beyond the lake drift far away Unreal and blue  Unreal and pure and fey Oh the long hour and the rising mist Is the frail beauty of the twilight grey  Helen Louise Birch   MASKS  Do birds sing for their mates  My song was for one airy and shining Lighter than a butterfly s wings On the way she would half turn and listen She fluttered solemn occupied yet I never knew her airy  business Now that I sing of an earthly woman She listens wondering  A HELEN  You looked tired For you came from far  Perhaps from Greece  You may have been walking for ages  You stepped slowly As though you carried Some precious wine  You stayed a moment Then vanished Wondering As if you were some one else   GIRLS  I  Your family has moulded you  Marks of their tools and fingers Show about your torse and face  Your cheeks near the mouth Are half frozen  Your soul flutters Faintly  II  Your flesh slopes like rose petals Like rose petals It holds and drinks in the light  Your humid lips Remember the mother s milk  Yet there flutters about you a flame Maturing you withering you  III  In the cafeteria the girl moved briskly In her imitation silk sashed hang how it will dress   Yet knocked constantly against the customs In taking her water her sugar her catsup  In the street too she walked briskly The old purse dangling and the old hat moving firmly Of a sudden she stopped looked about listened Struck by the city shot like a flying bird  Then she took herself in hand and went on  MYRRH  Your face called up a lily  Glowing in the dusk Your body the dusk green stalk Your lips were parched imploring   As if they thirsted for the kiss behind the kiss  As if they awaited disappointment  PAIN   Her lips lie tired discarded Her eyes are on the alert as if for some mystic tryst Through the white limbs where desire has leaped and pranced Now runs the invisible fire  An offering to some mysterious god   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  A LADY TALKING TO A POET  For a moment you felt nude and shivered  Your social position hung near You threw it about you A garment frail and lacy  THE GOLDEN APPLE  Running to art exhibitions to concerts and to the poor in  the tenements With eyes held high up as a cloud and as soft as haunting She stopped to pick up The golden apple shaped distiller  A DILETTANTE  Tall delicately stout With turned wine moist moustache He spoke like some bragging spoiled school boy Art is its own reward  THE TRAITOR  He knew the lady s half mocking half regretful smile Fluttering like one of the sweet pea petals   Had been fertilized by the sweat and blood of her husband s  vest workers Yet his eyes resented the intrusion Of firm matter of fact chins of servants  A RICH GENTLEMAN  Your nostrils sniff the air Your ears stand alert Near you like wolves in the forest Lurk other people s poverty and suffering And though your heart is robust Tough like the cheek of a country girl You dare not trust it  A PETIT BOURGEOIS  Sharp nails grow out from your fat fingers Over your clean shaven lip glimmers the moustache of a tom cat Your smiles are investments at a hundred per cent  Yet one has only one life one mouth one stomach and can  take only one woman at a time Also when you were younger before you knew You foolishly allowed suffering to reach your heart So your face sometimes contorts wistfully  You use this sanctimoniously to deceive   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  LA MORT DE PAUL VERLAINE  The few rosy cloud splotches In the bluish white afternoon sky Shed down ruddy flowers of light Big capriciously shaped lilies and orchids so thickly That some held at the stems stood as if growing straight  from the grass Among them he came short heavy a little ragged With eyes and lips that had laughed much with wine Faintly drunk as if wine vapors of the past were hovering  in his head Blowing his flute and dancing Now fast now slow and now stopping listening An earth flower among the light flowers  Tired he dropped down on the grass The light flowers caressed his cheeks and his drowsy eyes with their cloud like coolness piling about him Did the trees understand  The birds sang As though it were a sunrise   DEATH  One comes to me every day Gentle tactful and of Admirable dignity  He is friendly though not wheedling  He wants me to know him Sometimes he touches my arm Or even presses it impulsively  TO A WOMAN ASLEEP IN A STREET CAR  Woman sleeping in the car  Strange aloof and far  Shall I shake you and tell you  Who you are  Wake up and let us speak Till our hearts are bared to the core Till we are a man and a woman no more Till we are empty like vases that leak  Till we droop and fall  Till we are nothing at all  Max Michelson  COMMENT  A CENTURY IN ILLINOIS  ILLINOIS has been celebrating with speeches a poetic pageant and the dedication of monuments the centennial of her admission to the Union Every imaginative mind must have accepted this challenge to review the dramatic history of those hundred years and thrill over the prodigious epic they unfold The beautiful wilderness of flower tossing prairies changing into one of the world s great granaries coal fields manufactories criss crossing with railroads and word bearing light carrying wires building up villages towns and one of the most populous and powerful cities on earth founding institutions and governments quarrelling legislating fighting fierce wars nursing and developing great men including the soldier who led the Union troops to victory and the president whom time is crowning as one of the mightiest spirits of the ages is it not an incomparable story a fantastic dream come true a poem beyond the reach of genius however plumed and starred  A tradition like this is an immeasurably precious heritage for the people of Illinois and the whole Middle West and disregard of it would be a menace to our civilization By a fault of our American character we are too neglectful of such traditions and it is the province of art to produce imperishable reminders which shall avail to keep great days great deeds great men in memory It is not strange no cause for despair if we have not yet produced art which   measures up to our history epoch making deeds must have their day before art can build above them the stuff of dreams It may be a platitude to repeat that our pioneer ancestors were living instead of writing their epics tragedies lyrics of joy and pain but the platitude hides a profound truth the mighty imaginative stimulus of the wilderness the stupendous continental dreams which led those men and women on  With many globe trotting Americans the historic sense is over sentimentalized they weep for fallen Caesars in the Forum they make Stratford on Avon a place of pilgrimage and on the shores of our virginal Great Lakes they long for the glamour of a peopled and sorrow haunted past Foolish are they unworthy of their fathers whose hearts felt the glamour of the present and whose far seeing eyes visioned the future Shall we not emulate the pioneers who were inspired by the inviolate freedom of the vast wilderness confronting them A spirit like theirs if we possess it and act upon it as they did will construct the future of the world  But Illinois even now need not be ashamed of her art history She would not need to be ashamed of it if her list were limited to one name that of Abraham Lincoln the greatest literary artist the nation has produced whose speeches are prose poems of incomparable beauty And Chicago why do we hear puny apologists for Chicago who has no need of such mistaken service Is not Chicago by admission of that dyed in the wool New Yorker Henry L   Mencken the most civilized city in America possessed of the mysterious something a spirit that broods upon the face of the waters Is there not a feeling of youth in her a feeling big and free and many colored and conquering like the oceanic lake at her right hand a feeling from the inmost heart of the nation as Lake Michigan is the focal centre of a continent  Chicago Illinois the Middle West this vital and vitalizing section needs only in art the spirit it has shown in other things the spirit of active and immediate response to the need of the hour It is in this spirit that Chicago invented the sky scraper in this spirit that she brought forth The Spoon River Anthology and Chicago Poems in this spirit let me hope that POETRY was founded and that many greater things will be achieved in the future of our dreams  The most dangerous enemy of this spirit is self distrust a certain colonialism which leans upon London Paris New York thus bidding our artists imitate instead of create or exiling them instead of keeping them at home Every artistic venture confronts the benumbing influence of this enemy meets the facile temptation to become itself colonial When POETRY began for example two courses were open it could have become what The Little Review is now the organ of a choice little London group of superintellectualized ultimates and expatriates or as I hope it has become the organ of a higher and more conscious concentrated and independent imaginative life in this country The first course would   have been comparatively easy I remember with what cordial kindness a poet in exile once offered to conduct from London our entire prose section and since the editorials would no doubt have been very clever and very scornful of most things American we should unquestionably have been praised by some of the choicest spirits on both sides of the water and should have acquired by this time a much longer list of subscribers  The other course however seemed more important though much more difficult and less immediately rewarding Our enormous potential constituency may not yet be sympathetically aware of our effort to make its poetic impulse independently self assured and articulate but it can not deny that POETRY has achieved is achieving something of this purpose It has set in motion far travelling currents of influence it has gathered together and brought into sympathetic contact a group of poets now widely recognized a group which let us hope Chicago will cherish instead of shooing away The word coterie is perhaps over despised Coteries having been necessary and effective in Athens Rome Florence Paris and London they are of course equally necessary and may prove equally effective in Chicago A coterie is but a group of people working together and teamwork is required in the arts as in everything else if anything save benumbing isolation is to be accomplished If POETRY can help to develop and make articulate the imaginative life of the nation as when for example it wrings out of a poet s over modest reluctance the beautiful Chip   pewa monologues in the present number then its editors will be more proud than of having introduced the imagists important as that episode was in our earliest history and the literary history of our period  So let us raise the flag of Illinois be a part of its centennial and help to make its future more glorious ever more vital and inspiring in the life of the nation and the world  H M  AN INTERNATIONAL EPISODE  Some of our readers have asked me what number of The English Review would contain my reply to Edgar Jepson s article of last May Let me answer the question with the following correspondence  Mr Austin Harrison Editor of The English Review to Miss Monroe returning the latter s manuscript Mr Jepson and United States Poetry  Dear Miss Monroe  I really think it is hardly necessary to enter into a controversy over Jepson s article We are very full at this moment and I could not in any case find room now Miss Harriet Monroe to Mr Austin Harrison  My dear Mr Harrison Your letter of July 9th returning my comments on Mr Jepson reminds me of the Kaiser s reply to Belgium You invade our province quite uninvited and undesired and kill off its most prominent citizens Then when I protest you inform me that it is hardly necessary to enter into a controversy It would have been more in accordance with the British tradition of fair play if this consideration had caused you to decline Mr Jepson s egregiously caddish article  And so ends an international episode Or perhaps not quite ends For The Little Review now under the dictatorship of Ezra Pound reprints a condensa   tion of Mr Jepson s article in its latest number Mr Pound stating in his footnote that the article was ordered by POETRY and then rejected for its lack of flattery Let us take the trouble to set Mr Pound right our letter to Mr Jepson saying that we might wish to use his proposed appreciation of American poetry was not an order and our rejection of it was not due to its lack of flattery but to its cheap incompetence By the reprint Mr Pound freshens up so to speak the article s attack on POETRY a magazine which during the past six years he has so amiably represented in London Evidently this poet obeys the scriptural injunction not to let his right hand know what his left hand is doing  Perhaps Mr Harrison was not without excuse in declining my article for Mr Jepson s was certainly not worth a controversy the only wonder is that any editor however insular could consider it worth his space Opinionating however denunciatory is not criticism To call Mr Frost s Snow a maundering burble or to dispose of The Chinese Nightingale as harmless enough verse inspired by The Ingoldsby Legends which Mr Lindsay had never heard of or to dismiss with scorn Cloyd Head s closely woven Grotesques after reading at random four lines proves nothing except that Mr Jepson should apply to himself his condemnation of Edgar Lee Masters by admitting that he has no poetic quality of any kind or critical either H M   POETRY AN ESSENTIAL INDUSTRY  The truth has been officially spoken at last that poetry is an essential industry The story as it comes to us by hearsay evidence which we can not vouch for runs thus Mr Conrad Aiken being included in the recent military registration somewhere in Boston or near it showed his undeniable fighting spirit by fighting for his art he demanded fourth class registration not on the usual easy terms for he might have claimed exemption because of having a family to support but on the ground that he was a poet and that poetry is an essential industry The claim being novel was referred to Washington and by some ultimate Solomon there sitting in judgment was sustained being affirmed and decreed and locked and bolted under all the sacred seals of law  Thus the art owes to Mr Aiken a new and important service much more hazardous than his various books though any book of verse is indeed a heroic hazard or his high spirited bristlingly militant critical articles The art owes to him what it has never before so far as we can remember received in this country official recognition a definite legal status POETRY as the organ of the art which Mr Aiken for the last six or eight years has proudly served and loyally fought for extends to him its cordial thanks and congratulations May he live long to write and fight under the banner of the muse  Let the paragraphers make merry if they will that wise man in Washington was wiser than they H M   REVIEWS  MISS LOWELL AND POLYPHONIC PROSE  Can Grande s Castle by Amy Lowell Macmillan Co Amy Lowell a Critical Appreciation by W Bryher Eyre  amp Spottiswoode Ltd

they present admirably the poet s claims for this form and enable us to study its value as a poetic medium Miss Lowell who has if not invented at least adapted the form to her purposes and made it peculiarly her own says in her preface  Polyphonic prose is perhaps a misleading title as it tends to make the layman think that this is a prose form Nothing could be farther from the truth The word prose in its title simply refers to the manner in which the words are printed polyphonic manyvoiced giving the real key Polyphonic prose is the purest the most elastic of all forms for it follows at will any and all of the rules which guide other forms Metrical verse has one set of laws cadenced verse another polyphonic prose can go from one to the other in the same poem with no sense of incongruity The only touchstone is the taste and feeling of its author  Miss Lowell tells of getting the hint of the form from Paul Fort but of finding both the French alexandrine and the traditional English iambic pentameter unsuitable as a basic rhythm  I finally decided to base my form upon the long flowing cadence of oratorical prose The variations permitted to this cadence enable the poet to change the more readily into those of vers libre   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  or even to take the regular beat of metre should such a marked time seem advisable We may pass over as of no importance the much mooted question whether this form is poetry or prose It has never been possible and it never will be to draw an absolute line between poetry and prose however sharply grammarians rhetoricians and other rule makers have tried to do so These pieces unquestionably are pure artistry as close in their structure as any of the long eighteenth century narratives and descriptive pieces in the heroic couplet or the nineteenth century ditto in blank verse even if Miss Lowell s rhythms be more elastic than those earlier rhythms to which our ears have been long attuned We may therefore consider the form and these four presentations of it on their merits and by their results just as long ago we might have considered Thomson s Seasons Cowper s The Sofa Tennyson s Idylls of the King or any other of those long poems of narrative and description fairly numerous in English literature which whatever their metrical structure move inevitably back and forth between poetry and prose Miss Lowell s form has a certain advantage in being more frank in slipping more easily from one to the other according to the exigencies of the story and the poet s mood  The poems are I repeat sheer artistry they represent the accomplished virtuosity of a scholarly and imaginative mind of an expert rhyrhmist of a richly endowed human being who is keenly even lovingly observant of life The trouble is the observation the imaginative grasp of the various incidents seems a bit intellectual and aloof the artistry too   deliberate and self conscious the manner too explanatory and thus the whole effect too literary The poems become over picturesque and their vivid presentations of people and places contrasts and paradoxes too studied too brilliant The winds blow too sharply one can scarcely breathe There is a perpetual flicker of little rhymes and flutter of rhythmic bells There is unresting and never ending movement of both detail and mass swift rushings from paddle wheels to smoke plumes from America to Japan The eye can scarcely see or the ear hear for the glitter for the blare If Cowper and Thomson were too placid Miss Lowell is too eager too violent  It may be that she is thus true to her time this age of telephone calls and trolley cars and machine guns just as Cowper and Thomson were true to their leisurely eighteenth century But art has many ways of defeating itself and only one way of swinging clear of threats and dangers The transcendent art which is seized and carried by the emotion an impassioned renunciation which triumphs in loss that I can not find in this book The poet may be true to her consumingly restless period but she does not get a perspective on that period does not establish its relation with that spacious stillness which we call eternity  Thus the brochure by W Bryher recently published in London seems to me to rate Miss Lowell too highly in calling her a poet of the first order though praise from London for any American artist is rare enough for over generosity to be pardoned The art which forgets and   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  transcends art is beyond her reach or at least it may have been touched by her in my opinion only in a few of her briefer poems such a lyric for example as Venus Transiens or such a pure grotesque as Red Slippers Short of this I am with the English critic in many details of his or it may be her appreciation In these days of sloppy and slipshod writing Miss Lowell s scholarship and careful workmanship are a relief Also certain figures lines and passages have extreme vividness and beauty  The orchards are filled With cherry blossoms at butterfly poise  and  The fountain bent and straightened itself  In the night wind  Blowing like a flower  These and other metaphors equally happy are quoted in the brochure and to them we might add many from the new volume such as in Guns as Keys which presents Parry s expedition to Japan  Madeira Cape Town Mauritius Singapore nice firm stepping places for seven league boots or with ripe fruit bearing guns pointed inland  Here is an effective passage the great Nelson really falls in it  Red blood in a flood before his eyes Red from horizon to zenith crushing down like beaten metal The Admiral falls to his knees to his side and lies there and the crimson glare closes over him  If only the poet knew when to stop In my opinion the  next phrase a cupped inexorable end carries the figure too   far and nullifies the tragic beauty of the picture Also the paragraph which then follows is simply an ineffective intrusion  The blue thread is snapped and the bolt falls from the loom Weave shuttle of the red thread Weave over and under yourself in a scarlet ecstasy It is all red now he comes to die Red with the white sparkles of those cursed stars  The above quotations are typical perhaps of both Miss Lowell s vision and lack of vision her attainment and her limitations One wonders how a close observer can make such incomplete and unconvincing use of American slang as she does on page fifty four and how an accomplished stylist can so frequently carry the exclamatory note to the breaking point Somehow when her art has free rein it goes too far This for example from The Bronze Horses the latest and longest of these four poems  Such a pounding pummelling pitching pointing piercing pushing pelting poking panting punching parrying pulling prodding pulsing piling passing you never did see  How was it possible to write down all those alliterative participles without realizing that there were too many of them How is it possible for a poet so gifted not to recognize over strain I question such a passage with full recognition of this poet s rare gift for effective and artistic use of the grotesque a quality which has been much misunderstood  T o conclude I think Miss Lowell makes her point as to the adaptability and flexibility of her medium even though I would question certain details like its over elaborate use of rhyme It responds to varying moods it accepts grace   fully in Guns as Keys for example the interludes in free verse and would yield as easily perhaps to more conventional measures And I can agree with much of W Bryher s appreciation though to call this poet the most individual of writers and her poems crushed experiences spilling in drops of light may be extreme But there is much truth in these sentences from the conclusion  The curves of her cadences are sharp with truth with sensitiveness to the irony of existence which yet believes in adventure and in resistance Dreams and a core of ever recurring loneliness are perhaps the soul of their intense life The offering of her own vision to unobservant eyes the breaking of innumerable barriers for among all poets Miss Lowell is essentially an explorer  H M  A POTENTIAL ARTIST  Nocturne of Remembered Spring ond Other Poems by Con  rad Aiken Four Seas Co  This poet always gives me the feeling that some day he may win through and do something important some day when he has finished his more or less unconscious experimenting in the manner of Masefield or Gibson or some earlier poet and his more or less inevitably bookish emotionalizing in fields remote from actual emotional experience He has been tempted by a dangerous facility a really expert facility which enables him to turn out verses satin smooth or burlap harsh at will and to play with rhythmic tones and colors like a virtuoso and one resents the fact that as yet this expert ness has proved in the higher sense ineffectual producing only such blatant melodrama as Earth Triumphant or as in   The Jig of Forslin an up to date sentimentalism which parallels the mid Victorian sentimentalism of Owen Meredith s Lucille  One resents it because the man himself is not cheap because one discerns sincerity under art which he has not yet succeeded in making really sincere because one feels in this poet if I may use an over worked phrase a suffering soul a soul which since it is fitted out with so much talent with a technique as it were ready made should attain to art profoundly true and beautiful One is perpetually hoping for such attainment and for my part I shall not give up hoping as I open each new book from his hand  This hope is not satisfied by Nocturne of Remembered Spring any more than by the earlier volumes No one knows this better than its author whose anonymous review of his own volume in the Chicago News should be the despair of any other reviewer so keenly discerning was it so cruelly just in its discriminating severity The man not only knows himself but agonizes in the knowledge the man who can say of his own art such things as these  Mr Aiken comes to the rehearsal so to speak still fumbling in his pockets for his part Sometimes the radicals please him and he plays with the radicals sometimes he plays with the shell backs And even when apparently most single minded he carries on clandestine flirtations This is a serious weakness It points to a fundamental lack of conviction in Mr Aiken s mind as to poetic values  In Turns and Moines he wilfully sacrificed his ability to write in smoothly involved curves for a dubious gain in matter of fact forcefulness In The Jig of Forslin he recanted and with occasional sops to downright and rigid realism abandoned himself to a luxuriation   in romantic virtuosity And now in Nocturne of Remembered Spring he is more clearly than ever a schisophrenetic  Et cetera with references to the musical symbolism almost obsessionally pursued emotional symbols so idiosyncratic as to be almost meaningless vacillations between flesh and sentiment the dominant erotic theme Indeed almost the only merit the poet admits in his book is the occasional flush of verbal magic  Well it has other merits but on the whole its author s wittily serious arraignment is bitterly true The book shows that loss of power inevitable when an artist skirts the edges of his soul and avoids the depths It is either the last of its kind the poet s farewell to the stage play and facile stunt doing of his youth or else it represents a hardening of the crust of his mind a hopeless covering up of the real man and the potential fine artist under a poetic loquacity unconquerably artificial and insincere Mr Aiken must decide whether he will or will not force his art to be true to him Even now this may be beyond his power he may have borne too long with the lady s light minded escapades and frivolities Yet she is worth the effort fasting and prayer and flagellation may be an effective spiritual discipline for the pair of them  H M   OUR CONTEMPORARIES  ONE ON US  All POETRY poets and editors as well will please take notice Th e following letter appeared September 20th in the columns of our watchful St Louis contemporary  THE CLICHE  Editor of Reedy s Mirror  I write to you in considerable bewilderment having heretofore been assured that POETRY of Chicago was the foe of the threadbare phrase the archaic adjective Yet in a single copy the August issue I find these specimens of virginal imagination Red dawn last charge wee head weary bran love light fragrant hay young green vagrant wind rustling grass dank odor tossing spray fading light fleeting feet red blood lonely nights deathless ire meadows wide slow refrain fair daughter and gallant courage  Add to those the fresh young Broadway turns  Largess paven crass perchance frore and rathe and you may possibly sympathize with such bepuzzlement as exists on my side of the Sierras George Sterling  PRAISE FROM SIR HUBERT  Wonder of wonders we are discovered by that exclusive English aristocrat the London Saturday Review The following excerpts are from an editorial on Some Essentials in Modern American Poetry by W Bryher in the issue of August 31st  Inspiration here is a dull and lifeless thing America is producing book after book of fresh and exultant vision young as any Elizabethan just as definitely original The restless future is a willing captive in its hands While we in England praise our immaturities blind to outside loveliness experiment with them is at point to pass into achievement Vividness vitality and concentration beauty and originality of expression if these are the essentials of modern poetry and I believe they are look for them in the   work of Amy Lowell H D John Gould Fletcher Sandburg Frost and many another writer Truly the time is ripe for a re discovery of America  What are the tendencies which have startled American poetry into so sudden and virile a realization of loveliness so true and individual an expression of life Partly it is the power the new gift of these younger writers to love their future with a strength drawn from their past Partly it is due to the varied roots from which these new impulses are derived Miss Lowell owes much to her French reading H D is unmistakably Greek in form and thought the literature of many countries unites in Fletcher with Sandburg Swedish ancestry mingles with American experience  An so on for three columns with brief analyses of the five poets above mentioned ending with Miss Lowell as the most original poet of the new movement  Carl Sandburg has been acclaimed also by Clement  Shorter in the London Sphere Chicago Poems he pro  nounces one of the most original books the age has pro  duced and its author a second Walt Whitman We  find no mention however of the fact that for once a poet  was first discovered and even be prized in his own home  town CORRESPONDENCE  A WORD FROM MR SARETT  In sending us The Blue Duck its author wrote as follows  from the University of Illinois  I have come to appreciate recently first the vast rich amount  of poetic material that lay in my nine years of experience among the  Chippewas and in my intimate knowledge of their customs lan  guage music and peculiar mental and emotional slants and sec  ondly I realized the peculiar fitness of the new poetic form as a  vehicle for Indian poetry Hence I started The Blue Duck  There are a few bits that might be made more poetic and deli  cate but I hold that they ought not to be if the poem is to be true   to type if it is to be an interpretation of the genuine Indian have made every figure image and word honest and realistic within the range of experience imagination and language peculiar to honest to goodness Indians elevated a bit here and there however to avoid the commonplace The poem tries to hit the happy medium between the finer idealism of Indian thinking and emotion and the other extreme of realism with its crudeness commonplace ness and roughness In its basic fidelity to Chippewa concepts and images to Chippewa language and diction to Chippewa moods and emotional reactions to Chippewa singing and the monotonous dancing rhythms in these respects the poem is as perfect as I can make it  The poem is an interpretation of a Chippewa Medicine Dance and Song In early autumn a duck crudely carved from wood is placed upon a pole on the shore of the lake adjoining the Indian village A medicine man starts the ceremony by beating monotonously on the Mi de gwa kik a small drum The chief singer and dancer begins to stamp and to posture and to shout and to grunt finally breaking into a song and at times a chant invoking Keetch ie Manx do the Big Spirit to send down many ducks for the fall hunt to make a good duck season  In order to catch the rhythm tap two beats for each measure and stress the first beat Maintain the drum beats monotonously through the poem except when the dancing ceases for a time and the chant begins Lew R Sarett  A TRIBUTE TO MR MICHELSON  The following Comment on the Poems of M M comes from a poet who read them in manuscript  Could I understand  Every accent of your tongue  Which haunts me  I should be transfigured  No crowd could touch my garment  No dust soil it  But alas  The woman with ears of echoing sea shell  Lies yet unrisen  On the sea sand of my heart  Frances Shaw  ANNOUNCEMENT OF AWARDS  Each November of POETRY S history has brought to the members of its staff the agreeable duty of awarding two or more prizes When the magazine began prizes in this art were practically unheard of in America although annual prizes and scholarships in painting sculpture architecture and music have been common The editors believed and still believe in these awards both as a stimulus to the artists and a kind of advertisement of the art before the public We believe that they are as well deserved and as effective for these purposes in poetry as in the other arts and we rejoice that the example of the magazine is being followed by the Poetry Society of America through Columbia University and that other institutions and individuals are at least considering the bestowal of such awards  Compared with other artists the poet as everyone knows is absurdly ill paid POETRY is we believe almost the only one of the special magazines which has been able to pay anything to its contributors yet we should hate to expose the ridiculous smallness of our checks for such far famed poems of the past six years as Rupert Brooke s war sonnets and Joyce Kilmer s Trees or among poets now living for six of Tagore s Gitanjali or for Ego Dominus Tuus by Mr Yeats General Booth by Mr Lindsay Silence by Mr Masters Songs out of Stress by Sara Teasdale and many others ridiculous compared with the five eight even ten thousand dollars paid to our contemporary painters and sculptors of equal   rank for a single work of no greater beauty and inherent value Nor will the few prizes offered in this art bear comparison with the numerous and extremely large awards to painters and sculptors in our various large cities for example thirty four hundred dollars in five prizes accompanied by gold silver and bronze medals at a single annual exhibition of the Chicago Art Institute  POETRY would like to change all this it would like to be rich enough to pay for poems at least a living wage so that poets would not have to face the grim alternative of starving or getting an engrossing and art destroying job The editors constantly run up against cases of poignant suffering caused by this condition suffering which far from enriching the poet s art tends to stifle it altogether They could dispose of thousands a year to individuals who desperately need the money and whose talent gives them fully as much right to it as the numerous American art students have who enjoy local or travelling scholarships or even large allowances with studio and residence from the American Academy at Rome  At this point to enforce my argument the postman hands me a letter from Sara Teasdale who recently received the Poetry Society s five hundred dollar prize She tells of the soul destroying struggles of one or two young poet friends and adds  I wish that you would write an editorial about Crowder s dictum that poets are essential to the nation s well being So far so good But how is a poet to live on his work Did Gen Crowder or any of these other patriotic people and organizations who continually write to poets for verses to be furnished free for patriotic causes ever consider that point If a poet makes 500 a year on his poems   he is doing well Most of the laity have no idea how small the sums paid to poets are If they knew I think there might be some patriotic and generous millionaires who would come forward with more prizes endowments and what not  One chief trouble is that the short story writers and their publishers make a point of advertising the huge sums paid to successful short story writers Therefore the unsuspecting laity think that poets fare equally well An eager lady asked a friend of mine quite confidentially the other day Sara Teasdale gets about a thousand dollars for each of her poems doesn t she  And the New York Sun discussing Joyce Kilmer s career says  We ask that our poets above all people should be wise But we are told that Wisdom comes with leisure and books and children about her knee The young poet of to day has scant enough of the first the second he has no chance to enjoy and the children are apt to represent so many mouths to be fed  A poetry born of conditions prevalent to day is apt to be thin how otherwise when there is so little time for ripe thought and thick packing It is apt to lack sustaining power how else when the creator comes to his task already fagged from the world s work It is apt to lack careful workmanship time is so scarce And it will fail often to afford that escape from our muddy prison that the poet should offer us the world is too much with him  Well we must change all that and for a beginning it would be impossible to over state our feeling of gratitude to the two guarantors of POETRY who have given annual prizes during the past five years as well as to others who have given occasional prizes They are pioneers in a good cause and it is our firm belief that their generosity will so leaven the public mind as to give rise to a long list of successors POETRY as we have often said is a current exhibition no more than in other current exhibitions can we hope to show numerous masterpieces or to manifest impeccable justice in   our awards Human judgment is notoriously fallible but such as it is it must be our guide  With this preliminary the editorial staff of POETRY has the honor of announcing the three prizes awarded to poems printed in POETRY during its sixth year October 1917 to September 1918 inclusive  Poems by members of the jury in this case New Mexico Songs by Alice Corbin and Carolina Wood cuts by Harriet Monroe are withdrawn from competition And Mr Yeats having declined November 1913 POETRY S earliest prize award on the magnanimous ground that prizes should go to younger poets we must regard his beautiful poem Ego Dom inus Tuus October 1917 as hors concours Also the jury has not been able to consider as a possibility awarding the Levinson Prize to anyone who has previously received it although Prairie by Carl Sandburg Canticle of the Race by Edgar Lee Masters and The Empire of China Is Crumbling Down by Vachel Lindsay would otherwise have been considered and are herewith most honorably mentioned Translations are also exempt from competition for prizes although this year has been fortunate in four translations of such special distinction that we have mentioned them below in a separate list  The HELEN HAIRE LEVINSON PRIZE of two hundred dollars for a poem or group of poems by a citizen of the United States is awarded to  MR JOHN CURTIS UNDERWOOD   of New York and New Mexico for his Serbian war poem The Song of the Cheechas printed in the June number This prize was founded in 1913 by Mr Salmon O Lev  inson of Chicago Previous awards have been as follows 1914 Carl Sandburg for Chicago Poems 1915 Vachel Lindsay for The Chinese Nightingale 1916 Edgar Lee Masters for All Life in a Life 1917 Cloyd Head for Grotesques  The prize of one hundred dollars offered by an anonymous guarantor for a poem or group of poems without distinction of nationality is awarded to  MR AJAN SYRIAN  of New York for his group of Syrian and Armenian war poems From the Near East in the August number Our readers will note the odd coincidence by which both these prizes go to poems of the war This prize or other prizes similar in intent have been previously awarded as follows 1913 Vachel Lindsay for General Booth Enters into Heaven 1915 Constance Lindsay Skinner for Songs of the Coast  dwellers 1915 H D for Poems 1916 John Gould Fletcher for Arizona Poems 1917 Robert Frost for Snow In addition to these two annuals another guarantor of the  magazine offers this year a prize of fifty dollars for a poem   or group of poems by a young beginner in the art This prize is awarded to a twenty year old poet of unusual promise  MR EMANUEL CARNEVALI  of New York for his group The Splendid Commonplace  printed in the March number  Three other special prizes of one hundred dollars each have been previously awarded to Louise Driscoll for Metal Checks as the best poem of the war received in competition and printed in our War Number of November 1914 to Wallace Stevens for Three Travellers Watch a Sunrise adjudged the best one act poetic play received in a prize contest July 1916 and to Muna Lee for numbers III IV and VII of her group Footnotes January 1916 the prize having been offered by Mrs Julius Rosenwald for a lyric poem or poems by a young poet printed in POETRY during its fourth year  Besides the above three awards the following poems receive honorable mention The Tired Woman by Max Michelson February Morning Hymn and The Smoke Prayer by Frank S Gor  don June Carlos

February With the Wind by Konstantin Balmont translated by Edith Chapman Tracy August Two Spanish Folk songs translated by Salomon de la Selva November   NOTES  Mr Lew R Sarett lives in Urbana as a professor of English in the University of Illinois His knowledge of the Chippewa language and customs is due to his having spent nine seasons with the tribe while earning money as a guide in their
