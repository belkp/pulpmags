flutter of ribbon twixt the seas The low roofed houses lie afloat White foam drift of the Caribbees Under lithe palms that fan the sky Down in each drowsy plaza there  Brown footed girls go glancing by  With red hibiscus in their hair Low mountains trailing veils of cloud In the two oceans dip their feet And hear the proud tides roaring loud  Where Andes with Sierras meet 0 Panama 0 ribbon twist  That ties the continents together Now East and West shall slip your tether And keep their ancient tryst   What are you doing here Young men with your engines vast Sons of the pioneer Who conquered wastes austere And from ocean to ocean passed Sons of the men who made Reaper and telegraph Steamer and aeroplane All the iron handed things Swift feet and ears and wings That would make the old gods laugh For the bitter games they played With the secrets they kept in vain What are you doing here Young men with your dredges and drills That level the ancient hills Into a path for ships Open your eyes and lips What do you see and hear  Oh we build you the world s last wonder The thing not made with hands Our steel beasts gnaw asunder The locked and laboring lands We choke the torrent s rage And bid him his wrath assuage By drowning the jungle deep   Our Cariai  In steel locked chambers gray We hold his floods at bay On wide blue lakes asleep Now shall the brave ships ride Over the crouching hill From eager tide to tide That so we may fulfil The iron century s will That so our country maker of tools sublime The nations may surprise With this last gift of the grand old workman Time His prodigy powerful delicate sentient wise Perfect in strange completeness strong to obey Strong to compel the world along its way And praise man s triumph in its mighty rhyme  But what are you doing here Young men with your flags With your glamor of joy severe In the labor that never lags With your villages up the hill The screened little houses gay Where the good of all is the will Of each in a grand new way Sons of the men who founded New states in the wilds to be Garden and range unbounded   For young Democracy Sons of the heroes dear Who fought for liberty What are you doing here  Look it s the same old fight Out of the dark to the light Never the end shall be  I ill the last slave is free Here while we dig the Ditch We would build you a perfect state Where service makes men great And the great scorn to be rich Where each one has his place And a measure more than his mead A banner of joy to grace The strength of the daily deed Where wan Disease the slayer Is trapped in his poison lair With Squalor and Want and Care Where the Work is a marching song Sung by us all together Bearing the race along Through good and evil weather Oh tell them shout it through the halls of time When the Big Chief unrolls his glorious plan Draws hearts and hands together in perfect rhyme Nothing shall be impossible to Man   Our Canal  But what are you doing here Young men with your gates With your bells and beacons clear Where the hope of the whole world waits With your call across the seas To the ships that circle afar To the nations that burn and freeze Each under her separate star Sons of the dreamers brave Who followed the Truth austere Of poets and prophets grave What are you doing here  Hush we wait at the gate Till the dream shall be the law He gave us our beacons and bells Who first the vision saw And the fleets of the world in state Shall follow his caravels Ghost led our ships shall sail West to the ancient East Once more the quest of the Grail And the greatest shall be the least We shall circle the earth around With peace like a garland fine The warring world shall be bound With a girdle of love divine What build we from coast to coast Tis a path for the Holy Ghost   Oh Tomorrow and Yesterday At its gate clasp hands touch lips They shall send men forth in ships To find the perfect way  All that was writ shall be fulfilled at last Come till we round the circle end the story The west bound sun leads forward to the past The thundering cruisers and the caravels Tomorrow you shall hear our song of glory Rung in the chime of India s temple bells  0 lazy laughing Panama 0 flutter of ribbon twixt the seas Pirate and king your colors wore And stained with blood your golden keys Now what strange guest on what mad quest Lifts up your trophy to the breeze 0 Panama 0 ribbon twist That ties the continents together Now East and West shall slip your tether And keep their ancient tryst  To COLONEL GOETHALS and the other laborers in the Canal Zone   LOVE SONGS  I  I love my life but not too well To give it to thee like a flower So it may pleasure thee to dwell Deep in its perfume but an hour I love my life but not too well  I love my life but not too well To sing it note by note away So to thy soul the song may tell The beauty of the desolate day I love my life but not too well  I love my life but not too well To cast it like a cloak on thine Against the storms that sound and swe Between thy lonely heart and mine I love my life but not too well  II  Your love is like a blue blue wave The little rainbows play in Your love is like a mountain cave Cool shadows darkly stay in  It thrills me like great gales at war It soothes like softest singing   It bears me where clear rivers are With reeds and rushes swinging Or out to pearly shores afar Where temple bells are ringing  III  And is it pain to you That we must love and part Ah if you only knew The gladness in my heart  Love is enough Each day I look upon the sun He loves me I shall say Now is my life begun  He loves me Every night On the dark verge of sleep The rapture will alight And to my bosom creep  Peace for I should not dare A keener joy implore My soul shall feel no care Until you love no more   Poems  LULLABY  My little one sleep softly Among the toys and flowers Sleep softly 0 my first born son Through all the long dark hours And if you waken far away I shall be wandering too If far away you run and play My heart must follow you  Sleep softly 0 my baby And smile down in your sleep Here are red rose buds for your bed Smile and I will not weep We made our pledge you had no fear What then to fear have I Though long you sleep I shall be near So hush we must not cry  Sleep softly dear one softly They can not part us now Forever rest here on my breast  My kiss upon your brow What though they hide a little grave With dream flowers false or true What difference We will just be brave Together I and you   THE INNER SILENCE  Noises that strive to tear  Earth s mantle soft of air And break upon the stillness where it dwells The noise of battle and the noise of prayer The cooing noise of love that softly tells Joy s brevity the brazen noise of laughter All these affront me not nor echo after  Through the long memories They may not enter the deep chamber where Forever silence is  Silence more soft than spring hides in the ground Beneath her budding flowers Silence more rich than ever was the sound  Of harps through long warm hours Tis like a hidden vastness even as though Great suns might there beat out their measures slow  Nor break the hush mightier than they There do I dwell eternally There where no thought may follow me  Nor stillest dreams whose pinions plume the way   Poems NOW Yosemite Valley It is creation s morning Freshly the rivers run The cliffs white brows adorning Sing to the shining sun The forest plumed and crested Scales the steep granite wall The ranged peaks glacier breasted March to the festival The mountains dance together Lifting their domed heads high The cataract s foamy feather Flaunts in the streaming sky Somewhere a babe is borning Somewhere a maid is won It is creation s morning Now is the world begun Harriet Monroe    HERMONAX  Gods of the sea Ino Leaving warm meads For the green grey green fastnesses Of the great deeps And Palemon Bright striker of sea shaft Hear me  Let all whom the sea loveth Come to its altar front And I Who can offer no other sacrifice to thee Bring this  Broken by great waves The wavelets flung it here This sea gliding creature This strange creature like a weed Covered with salt foam Torn from the hillocks Of rock  I Hermonax Caster of nets Risking chance   Acon  Plying the sea craft Came on it  Thus to sea god Cometh gift of sea wreck I Hermonax offer it To thee Ino And to Palemon  ACON  After Johnannes Baptisia Amaltheus  I  Bear me to Dictaeus And to the steep slopes To the river Erymanthus  I choose spray of dittany Cyperum frail of flower Buds of myrrh All healing herbs Close pressed in Kalathoi  For she lies panting Drawing sharp breath Broken with harsh sobs She Hyella Whom no god pitieth   II  Dryads Haunting the groves Nereids Who dwell in wet caves For all the whitish leaves of olive branch And early roses And ivy wreaths woven gold berries Which she once brought to your altars Bear now ripe fruits from Arcadia And Assyrian wine To shatter her fever  The light of her face falls from its flower As a hyacinth Hidden in a far valley Perishes upon burnt grass  Palles Bring gifts Bring you Phoenician stuffs And do you fleet footed nymphs Bring offerings Illyrian iris And a branch of shrub And frail headed poppies  H D   THE CODE HEROICS  There were three in the meadow by the brook Gathering up windrows piling haycocks up With an eye always lifted toward the west Where an irregular sun bordered cloud Darkly advanced with a perpetual dagger Flickering across its bosom Suddenly One helper thrusting pitchfork in the ground Marched himself off the field and home One stayed The town bred farmer failed to understand  What was there wrong Something you said just now What did I say  About our taking pains To cock the hay because it s going to shower I said that nearly half an hour ago I said it to myself as much as you  You didn t know But James is one big fool He thought you meant to find fault with his work That s what the average farmer would have meant James had to take his time to chew it over Before he acted he s just got round to act  He is a fool if that s the way he takes me   Don t let it bother you You ve found out something The hand that knows his business won t be told To do work faster or better those two things I m as particular as anyone Most likely I d have served you just the same But I know you don t understand our ways You were just talking what was in your mind What was in all our minds and you weren t hinting Tell you a story of what happened once I was up here in Salem at a man s Named Sanders with a gang of four or five Doing the haying No one liked the boss He was one of the kind sports call a spider All wiry arms and legs that spread out wavy From a humped body nigh as big as a biscuit But work that man could work especially If by so doing he could get more work Out of his hired help I m not denying He was hard on himself I couldn t find That he kept any hours not for himself Day light and lantern light were one to him I ve heard him pounding in the barn all night But what he liked was someone to encourage Them that he couldn t lead he d get behind And drive the way you can you know in mowing Keep at their heels and threaten to mow their legs off I d seen about enough of his bulling tricks We call that bulling I d been watching him   The Code Heroics  So when he paired off with me in the hayfield To load the load thinks I look out for trouble I built the load and topped it off old Sanders Combed it down with the rake and said O K Everything went right till we reached the barn With a big take to empty in a bay You understand that meant the easy job For the man up on top of throwing down The hav and rolling it off wholesale Where on a mow it would have been slow lifting You wouldn t think a fellow d need much urging Under those circumstances would you now But the old fool seizes his fork in both hands And looking up bewhiskered out of the pit Shouts like an army captain Let her come Thinks I D ye mean it What was that you said I asked out loud so s there d be no mistake Did you say let her come Yes let her come He said it over but he said it softer Never you say a thing like that to a man Not if he values what he is God I d as soon Murdered him as left out his middle name I d built the load and knew just where to find it Two or three forkfuls I picked lightly round for Like meditating and then I just dug in And dumped the rackful on him in ten lots I looked over the side once in the dust And caught sight of him treading water like   Keeping his head above Damn ye I says That gets ye He squeaked like a squeezed rat  That was the last I saw or heard of him I cleaned the rack and drove out to cool off As I sat mopping the hayseed from my neck And sort of waiting to be asked about it One of the boys sings out Where s the old man I left him in the barn under the hay If you want him you can go and dig him out They realized from the way I swobbed my neck More than was needed something must be up They headed for the barn I stayed where I was They told me afterward First they forked hay A lot of it out into the barn floor Nothing They listened for him Not a rustle I guess they thought I d spiked him in the temple Before I buried him else I couldn t have managed They excavated more Go keep his wife Out of the barn  Some one looked in a window And curse me if he wasn t in the kitchen Slumped way down in a chair with both his feet Stuck in the oven the hottest day that summer He looked so mad in back and so disgusted There was no one that dared to stir him up Or let him know that he was being looked at Apparently I hadn t buried him   The Code Heroics  I may have knocked him down but just my trying To bury him had hurt his dignity He had gone to the house so s not to face me He kept away from us all afternoon We tended to his hay We saw him out After a while picking peas in the garden He couldn t keep away from doing something  Weren t you relieved to find he wasn t dead  No and yet I can t say it s hard to tell I went about to kill him fair enough  You took an awkward way Did he discharge you  Discharge me No He knew I did just right  Robert Frost    SONGS OF DELIVERANCE  I THE SONG OF YOUTH  This is the song of youth This is the cause of myself I knew my father well and he was a fool  I herefore will I have my own foot in the path before  take a step I will go only into new lands And I will walk on no plank walks The horses of my family are wind broken And the dogs are old And the guns rusty I will make me a new bow from an ash tree And cut up the homestead into arrows  Behold how people stand around There are always crowds of people standing around Whose legs have no knees While the engineers put up steel work Is it something to catch the sunlight Jewelry and gew gaw I have no time to wait for them to build bridges for me Where awful the gap seems stretching there is no gap Leaping I take it at once from a thought to a thought I can no more walk in the stride of other men Than be father of their children   Songs of Deliverance  My treasure lured like a bright star And I went to it young and desirous Lo as it stood there in its great chests The wise men came up with the keys Crying Blasphemy blasphemy For I had broken the locks And when the procession went waving to a funeral They cried it again For I stayed in my home and spoke truth about the dead  Much did I learn waiting in my youth At the door of a great man I waited on one foot and then on the other The files passed in and out before me to the antechamber  for at that door I was not favored O costly preferment Yet I watched them coming and going And I learned the great man by heart from the stones  on their faces When presently the retainers arrived one above the  other in a row saying The great man is ready I had long been a greater than he  This is the reason for myself When I used to go in the races I had but one prayer And I went first before the judges saying Give everyone a distance such as you consider best I will run scratch   II VIRGINS  I have had one fear in my life When I was young I feared virgins But I do not any more By contact with them I learn that each is a center And has a period of brightness And stands epitome in that brief space Of the Universe Ah the ephemeral eternal In virgins eyes I would live reflected as in a globe And know myself purer than crystal  III NO PREY AM I  No prey am I of poor thoughts I leave all of my followers I tire quickly of them I send them away from me when they ask too much for  though I live alone Still will I live night and day   There is not anything in me save mutation and laughter My laughter is like a sword Like the piston rod that defies oceans and grades When I labor it is a song of battle in the broad noon For behold the muscles of a man They are piston rods they are cranes hydraulic presses  powder magazines   Songs of Deliverance  But though my body be as beautiful as a hill crowned with flowers I will despise it and make it obey me   Is the old love dead Then I shall await the new To embrace it more sturdily and passionately than ever  the old And break it under the white force of my laughter Until it lies passive in my arms There is nothing in me but renewal If my friend bow his head over me I soon surprise him  with shouts of joy For in an instant I am again what I was Only with a few moments more of the infusion of Earth I tell him the griever to follow me and he is a griever no  more He raises his head and must follow Yet it is my battle not his battle For in me I absorb others I hail parties and partisans from afar Not men but parties are my comrades Not persons but nations are my associates I shake the hand of nations For I am a nation and a party and majorities do not  elect me I elect myself I swam in the sea and lo   The continents assembled like islands off ray coast My talk is with Homer and Bonaparte with David and  Garibaldi with China and Pharaoh and Texas When I laugh it is with Lucifer and Rabelais A pathfinder is my mistress one hard to keep and un  bridled I have no respect for tame women My friends and I do not meet every day For we are centuries apart our salutations girdle the  globe I have eaten locusts with Jeremiah I invite all hatreds and the stings of little creatures They enrich me I glory in my parasites  No man shall ever read me For I bring about in a gesture what they cannot fathom  in a life Yet I tell Bob and Harry and Bill It costs me nothing to be kind If I am a generous adversary be not deceived neither  be devoted It is because I despise you Yet if any man claim to be my peer I shall meet him For that man has an insolence that I like I am beholden to him I know the lightning when I see it And the toad when I see it I warn all pretenders   Songs of Deliverance  Yet before I came it was known of me to the chosen all  that I should do Every tree knew it Every lion and every leech knew it And called out to meet the new enemy The new friend What power can deny me It was known that I should do not one thing but hun  dreds For I despise my works and make them obey me I have my time and I bide it It was known that I should turn no whit from my end  until I had attained it  Nothing has scathed me Nothing ever nor ever will I have touched pitch I have revelled in it and rolled in it Buried in mire and filth I laughed long And sprang up I have loved lust and vain deviltries And taken them into my heart Their dirt and their lies and my heart was aflame With a new fancy Not me can pitch defile For the Spring my sister rose under my feet And I was again naked and white Ready to dive into the deep pool green and bottomless The medium for heroes since it is dangerous and beautiful   The pool of Tomorrow It is because I breathe like fishes and live in the waters of Tomorrow that Death fears me  How often I have intercepted thee O Death 0 windy Liar Thou canst do nothing against me If I command thee to stand back thou art afraid and  cowerest For I have caught thee often and punished thee  1 am the greatest laugher of all Greater than the sun and the oak tree Than the frog and Apollo I laugh all day long I laugh at Death I hail Death I kiss her on the cheek  as a lover his bride But the lover goes not to his bride unless he desire her I go not to Death until I am ready The strong lover goes not to his bride save when he would  people his land with sons Then I too I go not to Death save it be for the labor  greater than all others I shall break her with my laughter I shall complete her Only then shall Death be when 1 die  Orrick Johns EDITORIAL COMMENT  THE LAST VICTORIAN  The Works of Francis Thompson 3 vols Scribner  Francis Thompson has not been ten years dead but already Time s busy secretaries are writing out the verdict For there is nothing in his verse or prose which only the future can interpret he was not Shelley crying havoc or Blake divining the song of the morning stars Neither in the truth which he uttered nor in his art its instrument was he beyond the reach of contemporary judgment which recognizes in him a colder and more austere modern descendant of the mediaeval mystics one who as a poet was the last of the great Victorians  Of these he was in certain respects one of the least important The quantity and range of his work are slight and his lyric strain however poignant is less inherently original than were those of Tennyson Browning Rossetti and Swinburne But more than any of these men his whole intellectual and spiritual life was shut up with the vision in a narrow chamber if you will before a shrine which to the Anglo Saxon temperament seems almost cluttered with gorgeous trappings but yet free of worldly images and distractions The fire of physical suffering scarred him to the bone maiming his creative power and shortening his life but at least it burned away much modern rubbish   Thus of all the Victorians he was perhaps the most nakedly sincere the most passionately alive to purely spiritual values True he clothed his spirituality in a mediaeval ritual of gorgeous images and colored words such sublimated materialism was partly an inheritance of his faith and partly temperamental with him His eyes saw the vision thus and not otherwise even as John beheld the jeweled hierarchies of heaven For him the ultimate truth was thus veiled but it was not well nigh concealed as with Tennyson by the formidable structure of Society or dimmed as with Browning by distracting vapors of emotional and intellectual delight It did not contend with a crowd of rights and wrongs of loves and hates and literary preoccupations as with Swinburne or falter beneath suspicion and cynicism as with Rossetti or hide behind nineteenth century passimism as with Arnold Francis Thompson s life was stripped bare of all these things  His message is of course summed up in The Hound of Heaven the world old message of the spiritual conquest of man Roman Catholic and mediaeval mystic as he was the message is not essentially different from that of Bunyan in The Pilgrim s Progress and as in the great non conformist s allegory the battle becomes a series of symbolic pictures But the new series is more stern than the old and we miss the flash of joy the orchestral finale of ecstasy at the end In Bunyan lingered something of Elizabethan rapture he could not   The Last Victorian  be robbed of happiness by all the world s injustice summed up in years of imprisonment But Thompson was a child of a colder age his religion was wrested from a mind afraid of joy  In his intellectual attitude Thompson was a conservative He was an orthodox Roman Catholic he expressed in various odes the conventional British view of the Victorian era Cecil Rhodes the Boer war etc and though in The Nineteenth Century he passes in proud review the new knowledge won by science he has but a dim and fleeting vision of new glories past its own conceit for the blind worm of materialism In his art also he was content with the old forms and he clung more lovingly than most of his contemporaries to the old archaisms The encrusted velvet of his poetic diction was further than theirs from the garb of living speech Yet sometimes he attained a strain of fiery purity and of rhythmic beauty rarely surpassed Perhaps his finest moment of lyric utterance is the famous passage from the essay of Shelley There free from verse forms which often tempted him to an over sumptuous ritual he speaks quite simply and unconsciously with bolder imagery and a grander rhythmic movement than in even his finest poems  But if he was not the prophet of a new era he was a spirit beautiful and noble astray and well nigh ruined in a world too huge and clattering and distracted one who his gaze thrown onward saw a few things with   singular intensity and told of them with complete sincerity who reduced to sordid penury never whined or lost the vision At the end he could truthfully say of his muse  Her heart sole towered in her steep spirit Somewhat sweet is she somewhat wan And she sings the songs of Sion By the streams of Babylon  LINDSAY S POEMS  General William Booth Enters into Heaven and Other  Poems by Nicholas Vachel Lindsay Kennerley  It is not for nothing that Nicholas Vachel Lindsay was born in Lincoln s city and within eye shot of the Capitol Political idealism typified by the dead leader wages bloody war in his imagination with political shiftiness typified by that faulty dome In boyhood he must have brandished some old soldier s sword and sharpened it to a keener edge as he gazed at the forlornly shoddy tomb of the martyred hero Perhaps the grim humor of the situation was embodied for him in that luckless monument which was the best that America could do in the sixties to honor the memory of the greatest modern Man the master spirit who among other details of his greatness included that of being our supreme artist in English prose  In any case the young Nicholas grew up a crusader   Lindsay s Poems  one with a sense of the tragedy and comedy in all the  futile and costly ugliness around him The people had  intended beauty in that belief his faith was sure it  was his business to strip off the cheap offerings the  tawdry incrustations of false ideals and reveal to them  the living shrine  This in his opinion is what a poet is for This seems to be what he is trying to do in preaching his gospel of beauty in crying out against drink prostitution luxury graft and other forms of vicious hideousness and in pleading for bare beggary true love imaginative thinking clean living all austere ideals His sincerity in this use of his art hardly admits of question the point for us is how far does he in this first book of poems get his message into poetry  Perhaps it is not too fond a claim that at least he makes a beginning puts one stout foot on the slope of Parnassus in such poems as General William Booth Enters into Heaven Eagle Forgotten Where is David  And one would praise finely phrased lines and passages of high spiritual sympathy in the poems about Poe and  O Henry and the light hearted singing lilt in some of the fanciful poems  Mr Lindsay is a poet with a message a message which his fellow countrymen would seem to be in need of May all the prairie muses help him to utter it  H M   POETIC DRAMAS  The Americans by Edwin Davies Schoonmaker Mitchell Kennerley Mr Faust by Arthur Davison Ficke Mitchell Kennerley The Wolf of Gubbio by Josephine Preston Peabody Houghton Mifflin Co Tiger by Witter Bynner Mitchell Kennerley  Mr Edwin Davies Schoonmaker s five act poetic drama The Americans is announced as a play dealing with the daily life both of the masses and the classes This is enough to prompt misgiving But Mr Schoonmaker has put a great deal of life into his types and his work carries with it the author s passionate conviction too often lacking in modern plays presenting social causes It is true that the play bears the strain of that overwrought emotionalism at once realistic and artificial which is the signet of melodrama but in spite of the forced nobility of his heroes and the mechanical inhumanity of his capitalist he has nevertheless been able to infuse in his play a spirit of earnestness and passionate faith that raises it above its own envelope as it were His scheme is too vast to adapt itself to the practical concerns of stage presentation and the speech of his characters has not been focused narrowly enough upon the need of concrete realization by the audience His canvas reminds one of those panoramic views of Gettysburg or the   Poetic Dramas  Crucifixion impossible to visualize save by taking in at once a three quarters view of the horizon Because the spirit of the play commands sympathy the regret is all the more keen that it was not fashioned for immediate and practical stage use It deals with original native material and is thus a step in the right direction For all the activity of our drama leagues and our endowed or subsidized theatres their stages remain empty or are temporarily filled with foreign literary drama to which the great mass of our people remain unsympathetic because these plays have no immediate significance for them The drama ceases to be a moving force when it is divorced from life  Mr Ficke s modern version of the Faust legend is not divorced from life in that it is supposed to give us the essence of life But life extracted from life tends towards abstraction and Mr Ficke s characters become types of the tough or tender minded in the phrasing of William James they are generalities puppets on which the poet strings his philosophical action The spirit of his message is so modern and so much in the air at present that it would be almost trite to remark that Mr Faust might just as well have been called Mr Neitsche Judged from the standpoint of poetic dramatic expression one regrets again the lack of stage sense in conception and a certain monotonous regularity in the poetic vehicle apparent also in the drama by Mr Schoonmaker Iambic pentameter is a foot rule supposed to govern all English   blank verse but the organic rhythms of the classic prototypes transcend the measure  In The Wolf of Gubbio Mrs Josephine Preston Peabody varies her blank verse with lyric movements but her play is also a closet drama Is it because our stage is so largely pictorial and all our modern revolutionaries tend to make it more so that we have lost as dramatists the power to endow character with life and action independent of scenic environment and explanation At present I believe that if the author were forced to omit all stage directions and all indications of scenery relying solely upon his own medium to express his dramatic content we should come nearer to actable and consistent drama A large part of the action of Mrs Peabody s drama is in stage directions quite impossible of stage realization Out of the bleak refrain of the wind comes the voice of The Wolf big and sorrowful is the opening word of her play  Tiger is a piece of dramatic propaganda a brief one act play moving swiftly to a striking climax Were it comedy rather than tragedy it would be called a farce since its action is based upon situation and its characters are types whose parts in life seem to be externally arranged Destiny that deus ex machina of the old plays was really far less external than the social conscience that disposes the fate of characters on the stage today Mr Bynner s characters are types too in the sense that they are familiar in contemporary journalism There is no   Our Contemporaries  objection to this but one wishes that he could have made them a little more human and less artificial It would not have hurt the propagandist motive of his play if he had moved us to sympathy for their thwarted sense of life their perverted instincts the debased histories of their stunted souls This would rather have given us that sense of time that spherical depth beneath the surface which is necessary to the permanent effect of any drama however short Synge s short plays have this permanence just because they do give this sense of the relation of a part to the whole of life this rounded completeness Mr Bynner s play is eminently actable and the most interesting thing about it for us is that it is written in verse which is close to speech and that it moves as readily or in fact more readily than if written in prose A C H  OUR CONTEMPORARIES  I  Mr William Stanley Braithwaite issued recently through the Boston Transcript his annual pronunciamento upon current poetry in American magazines He has heroically read all the verse in the seven leading magazines mostly those solemn standpatters which print a little verse as a decorative incident We quote his mathematical table of conclusions  The total number of poems printed in each magazine and the number of the distinctive sic poems are Century total 58 30 of distinction Harper s total 57 29 of distinction Scribner s total 45 30 of distinction Forum total 53 27 of distinction Lippincott s total 66 21 of distinction The Bellman total 53 25 of distinction The Smart Set total 169 49 of distinction   Happy nation whose leading magazines print 211 distinctive poems in one year From these fortunately numerous 211 poems the cheerful critic selects and reprints the seven best POETRY would like to present these seven masterpieces as a Bostonian exhibit Two of them are indeed by poets of some distinction Mr Robinson and Miss Cather though The Field of Glory and A Likeness by no means represent them at their best The other five represent current magazine poetry in its most banal mood of mediocrity Of one of them November by Mahlon Leonard Fisher the Transcript s critic of poetry says Not since Keats On First Looking Into Chapman s Homer and Miss Reese s Tears has there appeared so fine a sonnet in English poetry We quote the opening lines of this epoch making production  Hark you such sound as quivers Kings will hear As kings have heard and tremble on their thrones  If this kind of opinionating passes for criticism in Boston what can be expected of the shadowy region beyond the Alleghenies  II  In a recent number of The Poetry Review Mr Herman Scheffauer lets himself go in a poem called America Inarticulate Judging from the confusion of images and   Our Contemporaries  rhetorical phrases naked with the shame of having served many masters it might much better have been called Inarticulate Scheffauer America s great sin is the lack of bards Hear the voice of this bard  Thou at thy fiery breasts hast held me Too bitter was the milk perchance Would that the savage posset then had quelled me Ere wrath took sword my nursling peace to slay  Let us pray 0 my compatriots for poets with stronger stomachs  Thou art so young O soiled yet splendid mother  Art thou of song so fruitless being young  Hath youth no magic shell for song  Nor ever a sybilline glory for thy tongue  No harp to whelm the roar of brazen hives  No anthem no sonorous tubes to smother  The clamor of the anvils the mad throng  Of hucksters and of silver blasted lives etc  Not thus does the triumphant artist speak of his mother his muse or his mistress But there is no rage like that of impotence  A C H  NOTES  Mr Orrick Johns who was born in St Louis in 1887 was a journalist in that city when he received in
