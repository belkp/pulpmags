This is a novel of the West, vigorous, stirring, picturesque: in its pages are reproduced the atmos- phere of the prairies; in its pages live and act such characters as have made the W est the land of romance. The hero Hal, the Squaw Man s son is a half-breed whose father was an Englishman of noble family. He was educated in the English schools and trained for the Army, but when this novel opens he has heard the    silent call   and is back near the ranch where he was born. The plot centres largely about the asphalt beds near the Red Butte Ranch and, involving a fight with the Asphalt Trust, bears strongly on the present conservation problem. Hut, beyond all. this is a love story, written with all the emotional intensity and delicate feel- ing that distinguished the   Squaw Man.

While here he spent from eight to ten hours a day in hunting, most of it done to supply food for the black members of his camp. No one can read any of these articles without realizing at once that the author is always very much more than the traditional hunter. Nothing seems to escape him, and his observa- tions upon the animals large and small, his keen appreciation of the beau- ties of the landscape, the birds, llowers, trees, have been the occasion of very wide comment. There are a number of exceptionally interesting passages in this article that show how carefully he observes. A para- graph about the way va- rious animals run. their peculiar and individual ways of covering ground rapidly, is a distinct and novel contribution to natural history. Contrary to a very generally accepted opinion regarding the mongoose as a snake killer, Mr. Roosevelt tells of putting a puff adder before one of the little animals, expecting it to avoid the poisonous fangs by its agility. Instead of jump- ing about, the mongoose grabbed the adder by the middle and was struck several times on the snout but without any apparent injurious effect. On this journey Mr. Roosevelt was for a while without white companions, and he expresses much appreciation and sympathy for his faithful black servitors. Evidently Kcrmit was a tire- less hunter, and none of the others could keep up with him once he got started. Again Mr. Roosevelt refers to the lion as a scourge to ani- mals and men. While  Ireat Britain probably will be long in command of the seas by right of superior naval power, she will yet have formidable rivals. Among them Germany seems most inclined to follow her lead in the rapid construction of dreadnaughts of the most powerful type. It seems to be the plan of the German Emperor to reach a point in naval strength where "a war with her would, even for the greatest naval power.   e accompanied with such dangers as would render that pow- er s position doubtful.  When President Cleve- land sent his famous Venezuelan message it seemed that war was al- most inevitable. A sim- ilar episode in Germany was the Emperor's telegram to President Kruge; following the Jameson raid. It stirred England to the depths and she began immediate preparations to put her lleet on a war basis. Elmer Roberts, whose remarkable article on  Monarchical Socialism in Germany  attracted very wide attention, has written  Some Reflec- 37 G  rnyA , fQfO.fy CSkaritt S-SN . Mr. Rcofccvcil and hi  gun bearer . Fri iti x   but0gr4fjh by Kituiuiwt Hcl   -' magazine notes tions   n the Growth of the German Navy  for the July number. It is a notable contribution to the subject of the seemingly armed neutral- ity that exists between Kngland and Germany. Their relations are rarely without an occasion for discussion, and every now and then some sensational newspaper sees a war cloud on the horizon. Certainly Germany s naval strength is rapidly assuming impressive proportions and her licet of dreadnaughts will soon rank with the world s best. Mr. Roberts says that  'apt. Mahan s  real work on  The Influence of Sea Power on History,  has had as much to do with the build- ing of the German navy as any other single factor. V  T   Few great figures in history have been asso- ciated with more horrible and unscrupulous crimes than Catherine tie Medici. Tradition has given her a place as a great  ioisoner. one who spared no means to defeat or kill an enemy. The one great crime of which she was guilty was the St. Bartholomew massacre, but she has been held up for all time as the type of the vin- dictive and heartless ruler. Professor Paul van Dyke contributes an article to the July number which he calls  An I'nlinished Crime,  dealing with the career of Catherine, and readers will have occasion to i liange greatly their views of her. She was a woman of ambition with a desire to rule, the author admits, but she has lieen credited with a whole catalogue of crimes of which she was never guilty. That the record of the particular medi- tated crime referred to by Professor van Dyke should have been lost to history all these years is to say the least remarkable. It is a chapter of heretofore unwritten history of great interest and with a fine flavor of  he romantic, ' 'lie facts in the   ase have waited three hundred and fifty years for publication. V  V Many visitors lo California who have also been to Italy find much along that part of the Pacific Coast to remind them of the Mediterranean There, too, the sea is wonderfully blue and the skies elea r. There are many other resemblances evident to the observing traveller Up north of San Francisco, in some of the most beautiful valleys of the State, is the great vineyard country, the land of grapes and wine-making. In Napa Valley, a region of extinct volcanoes where 1 toil- ing Springs and steam still issue from the ground here and there, is one of the greatest wineries in the world. The great storage vats hold thou- sands of gallons and the vintage festivals are a picturesque feature of every year.   rowrning the valley is the splendid mass of Ml. St. Helena, better known to all readers of Robert Louis Stevenson as Mt. Silverado, on whose summit he spent his honeymoon, the story of which he told so charmingly in  The Silverado Squatters.  It is not only the vintage country that reminds the visitor of Italy, however the fishermen of San Francisco Bay with their lateen sail fishing smacks and the groups about the fishermen s wharf are Italy over again Mr. Peixotto has written an article on   Italy in California   and will illustrate it with his own drawings. V  Few travellers write with so keen an apprecia- tion of the intimate human associations of places as Madame Waddington. She is always a de- lightful guide, and her reminiscences of people and places make most attrai live and entertaining reading. Her very wide acquaintance in F.u- rojie has given her special opportunities for ob- servation. In July she will contribute "Venice  A Sketch,  giving many charming impres "ions of the life on the canals and in the palaces. The article will be illustrated with reproduc- tions in colors of paintings by F. Hopkinson Smith. V  V  The short stories of the July number include three that are very certain to be very widely read. Pwo of them arc by writers who are without rivals in their special field. Kate Douglas Wig- gin s host of readers will find all of this favorite author s charming humor and sentiment in  The Turning Point : and Mrs. Mary Ray- mond Shipman Andrews s  The Campaign I rout  will delight every lover of the woods. It, too, has a vein of alluring humor and a shrewd and genial appreciation of character. The third story is by a new writer, C. II. Luther  The Wings of the Morning.  The scene is the Arizona desert and it has some very line descriptive passages and strong imaginative qualities.

The third charged him. He was carrying a double-barrelled .450, but failed to stop the beast; it seized him by the leg, and his life was saved by his Swahili gun-bearer, who her eye; his horse jumped and swerved at the shot, throwing him off, and he found himself sitting on the ground, not three yards from the dead lioness. Nothing more was seen of the other.

He came within an ace of dying; but when I saw him, at the hospital, he was well on the road to recovery. One day Selous while on horseback saw a   ouple of lionesses, and galloped after them, followed by Judd, seventy or eighty yards behind. One lioness stopped and crouched under a bush, let Selous pass, and then charged Judd. She was right alongside him, and he fired from the hip; the bullet went into lions in which warfare with wild beasts was one  .it the main features of man s existence. At one dinner my host and two of my fellow guests had been within a year or eighteen months severely mauled by lions.

One afternoon, at Government House. 1 met a government official who had once succeeded in driving into a corral seventy zebras, in- ing beautifully; the bulbuls were the most noticeable singers, but there were many others. The dark ant-eating chats haunted the dusty roads on the outskirts of the town, and were interesting birds; they were usu ally found in parties, flirted their tails up and down as they sat on bushes or roofs or wires, sang freely in chorus until after dusk, and then retired to holes in the ground for the night. A tiny owl with a queer little voice called continually not only after night- fall. but in the bright afternoons.

Most of the time in Nairobi we were the guests of ever-hospitable McMillan, in his low. cool house, with its broad vine-shaded veranda, running around all four sides, and its garden, fragrant and brilliant with a wealth of flowers. Birds abounded, sing- spitted insects on the spines of the imported cactus in the gardens. Striped squirrels the size of chipmunks lived in the trees. It was race week, and the races, in some of which Kermit rode, were capital fun. The white people army officers, govern- ment officials, farmers from the country roundahout, and their wives rode to the races on ponies or even on camels, or drove up in rickshaws, in gharries, in bullock tongas, occasionally in automobiles, most often in two-wheel carts or rickety hacks drawn by mules, and driven by a turbaned Indian or a native in a cotton shirt.

The constabulary, Indian and native, were in neat uniforms and well set up,  hough often barefooted. Straight, slen- der Somalis with clear-cut features were in attendance on the horses. Native ne- groes, of many different tribes, flocked to the race-course and its neighborhood. 'I'he Swahilis, and those among the others who aspired toward civilization, were well clad, the men in half European costume, the women in flowing, parti-colored robes. But most of them were clad, or unclad, just as they always had been. Wkamba, with filed teeth, crouched in circles on the ground. Kikuyu passed, the men each with a blanket hung round the shoulders, and girdles of i hains, and armlets and anklets of solid metal; the older women bom under burdens they carried on the back, half of them in addition with babies slung somewhere round them, while now and then an unmarried girl would have her face painted with ochre and vermil- ion. A small party of Masai warriors kept close together, each clutching his shining, long-bladed war spear, their hair daubed red and twisted into strings.

Metier with shield and spear and head-dress of nodding plumes, held a dance near the race track. As for the races themselves, they were carried on in the most sporting spirit, and only the Australian poet Pat- terson could adequately write of them. On August 4th I returned to l.ake Nai- vasha, stopping on the way at Kijabe to lay the corner-stone of the new mission building. Mearns and Loring had stayed at Xaivasha and had collected many birds and small mammals. That night they took me out on a springhaas hunt. Thanks to Kermit we had discovered that the way to get this curious and purely nocturnal animal was by  shining  it with a lantern at night, just as in our own country deer, coons,owls,and other creat- ures can be killed. Springhaas live in big burrows, a number of them dwelling to- gether in one community, the holes close to one another, and making what in the West we would call a   town   in shaking of prairie dogs. At night they come out to feed on the grass. They are as heavy as a big jack-rabbit. with short forelegs, ancl long hind legs and tail, so that they look and on occasion move like miniature kangaroos, although, in addition lo mak- ing long hops or jumps, they often run al- most like an ordinary rat or rabbit. They are pretty creatures, fawn-colored above, African Game Trails and white beneath, with the terminal half of the tail very dark. In hunting them we simply walked over the tints for a couple of hours, flashing the bull's-eye lantern on all A  I  Mm shxutllbaa From a jihou u Jph I j L l uuu l IRlki sides, until we saw the light reflected hack by a springhaas s eyes. Then 1 would ap- proach to within range, hold the lantern in my left hand so as to shine both on the sight and on the eves in front, resting my gun on my left wrist. The number 3 shot, in the Fox double barrel, would always do the business, if 1 held straight enough. There was nothing but the  gleam of the eyes to shoot at : and this might suddenly be raised or lowered as the intently watching animal crouched on all-fours or raised itself on its hind legs. I shot half a dozen, all that the naturalists wanted. Then I tried to shoot a fox; but the moon had risen from behind a cloud bank; I had to take a long shot and missed. While wailing for the safari to get ready, Kermit went off on a camping Irip and shot two bushbuck, while 1 spent a couple of days trying for sing sing waterbuck on the edge of the papyrus. I did not shoot well, and among other feats I missed one bull, and wounded another which I did not get. as well as missing a serval as it bounded off in the tall grass. This was all the more exas-   erating because inters  ersed with the misses were some good shots: I killed a tine waterbuck cow at a hundred yards, and a buck tommy for the table at two hundred and fifty; and, after missing a handsome black and white, red-billed and red- legged jabiru, or saddle-billed stork, at a hundred and fifty yards, as he stalked through the meadow after frogs, I cut him down on the wing at a hun- dred and eighty, with the little Springfield rifle. The water- buck s ient the daytime out- side, but near the edge of the papyrus: I found them grazing or resting, in the open. at all limes between early morning and late afternoon. Some of them s K-nt most of the day in the papyrus, keeping to the watery trails made by the hip- posand bv themselves; but this was not the general habit, un- less they had been persecuted. When fright- ened they often ran into the papyrus, smash- ing the dead reeds and splashing the water in their rush. They are noble-looking an- telope, with long, shaggy hair, and their chosen haunts beside the lakes were very attractive. Clumps of thorn trees and flow- ering bushes grew at the edge of the tall papyrus here and there, and often formed a matted jungle, the trees laced together by cree  ers, many of them brilliant in African Game Trails their bloom. The climbing morning-glories up. There were deer ferns; and Spanish sometimes completely covered a tree with moss hung from the trees and even from their pale purple flowers: and other bios- the bamboos. The flowers included utterly soming vines spangled the green over which their sprays were flung with masses of bright yellow. Four days  march from Xai- vasha, where we again left Mearns and Loring, took us to Ncri. Our line of march lay across the high plateaus and mountain chains of the Aberdare range. The steep, twisting trail was slippery with mud. Our last camp, at an altitude of aljout ten thou- sand feet, was so cold that the water froze in the basins, and the shivering porters slept in numbed discomfort. There was constant fog and rain, and on the highest plateau the bleak landscaj e, shrouded in driving mist, was northern to all the senses. The ground was rolling, and through the deep valleys ran brawling brooks of clear water; one little foaming stream, suddenly tearing down a hillside, might have been that which Childe Roland crossed before he came to the dark tower. There was not much game, and all of it moved abroad by night. One frosty evening wc killed a dykcr by shining its eyes. We saw old ele- phant tracks. The high, wet levels swarmed with mice and shrews, just as our arctic and alpine meadows swarm with them. The species were really widely different from ours, but many of them showed curious analogies in form and habits: there was a short-tailed shrew much like our mole shrew, and a long haired, short-tailed rat like a very big meadow mouse. They were so plentiful that we frequently saw them, and the grass was cut up by their runways. They were abroad during the day, probably rinding the nights too cold, and in an hour Heller trapped a dozen or two individuals belonging to seven species and five different genera. There were not many birds so high strange forms, as for instance giant lobelias ten feet high. Others we know in our gar- dens; geraniums and red-hot-pokers, which in plac es turned the glades to a tire color. Vet others either were like, or looked like, our own wild  lowers: orange lady-slippers, red gladiolus on stalks six feet high, pansv- like violets, and blackberries and yellow raspberries. There were stretches of bushes bearing masses of small red or large white flowers shaped somewhat like columbines, or like the garden balsam; the red flower la.l  on sJope of Kcma near fir   elephant camp Kiuut m l y l ilamml Heller. African Game Trails bushes under the bamboos, ihe white at a lower level. The crests and upper slopes of the mountains were clothed in the green uniformity of the bamboo forest, the trail winding dim under it' dark archway of tall, dose-growing stems. Lower down were junipers and yews, and then tree ferns and strange dragon trees with lily-like frondage. Zone succeeded zone from top to bottom, each marked by a different plant life. In this part of Africa, where  lowers bloom and birds sing all the year round, there is no such burst of bloom and song as in the northern spring and early summer. There is nothing like the mass of blossoms which carpet the mcadowsof the high moun- tain valleys and far northern meadows, during their brief high tide of life, when one short joyous burst of teeming and vital beaulv atones for the long death of the iron fall and winter. So it is with the bird songs. Many of them are beautiful though, to my ears, none quite A as beautiful as the best of our own bird songs. At any rate there is nothing that quite cor responds to the chorus that during May and J une moves northward from the Gulf Slates and southern Califor nia to Maine, Minne- sota, and Oregon, to Ontario and Saskat ihewan; when there comes the great ver nal burst of bloom and song: when the may-tlower. bloodroot, wake-robin, anemone, adder's tongue, liver- wort, shadbiow, dog- wood, redbud glad- den the woods; when mocking-birds and lardinals sing in the magnolia groves of the South,and hermit thrushes, winter wrens, and sweetheart S oilman Nii .Mtru. :ie 'A Ihe elephant guide  S  3rTO VS Frnnt      b  K ; tnll Kooteidu in t H C spruce and hemlock forests of the North; when bobolinks in the Hast and meadow- larks Hast and West sing in the fields; and water ousels by the cold streams of the Rockies, and canyon wrens in their sheer gorges; when from the Atlantic sea-board to the Pacific wood thrushes, vocries, rufous- backed thrushes, robins, bluebirds, orioles, thrashers, cat-birds, house finches, song sparrows- some in the East, some in the West, some both East and West and many, many other singers thrill the gar- dens at sunrise; until the long days begin lo shorten, and tawny lilies burn by the roadside, and the indigo buntings trill from the tops of little trees throughout the hot afternoons. We were in the Kikuyu country. On our march we met several parties of na- tives. I had been much inclined to pity the porters, who had but one blanket apiece; but when 1 saw the Kikuyus, each with nothing but a smaller blanket, and without the other clothing and the tents of the porters, I realized how much better off the latter were simply because they were on a white man s safari. At Neri Itomn we were greeted with the warmest hospitality by the Distrii l Commissioner, Mr. Browne. Among other things, he arranged a great Kikuyu dance in our honor. Two thou- sand warriors, and many women, came in: as well as a small party of Masai nioran. The warriors were naked, or half-naked: some carried gaudy blankets, others girdles of leopard skin: their ox-hide shields were colored in bold patterns, their long-bladed s  ears quivered and gleamed. Their faces and legs were painted red and yellow; the faces of the young men who were about to undergo the rite of circumcision were stained a ghastly white, and their bodies fantastically painted. 'I'he warriors wore bead nec klaces and waist belts and armlets of brass and steel, and spurred anklets of monkey skin. Some wore head-dresses made out of a linn s mane or from the long black and white fur of theColobus monkey: others had plumesstuck in their red-daubed hair. They chanted in unison a deep- toned chorus, and danced rhythmically in rings, while the drums throbbed and the horns blared; and they danced by us in column, springing and chanting. The women shrilled applause, and danced in groups by themselves. The Masai circled I'irsT ric ih:ni  lamp, keiiix I rim a l   Liluiuntl llrllci.

Some of the tribesmen held wilder dances still in the evening, by the light of fires that blazed in a grove where their thatched huts stood. The second day after reaching Neri the clouds lifted and we dried our damp clothes and blankets. Through the bright sunlight we saw in front of us the high rock peaks of Ken'ia, and shining among them the fields of everlasting snow which feed her glaciers; for l eautiful. lofty Kenia is one of the glacier-bearing mountains of the equator. Here Kermil and Tarlton went northward on a safari of their own, while Cuninghame. I idler, and I headed  or Kenia itself. For two days we travelled through a well-j  coplcd country. The fields of com always called mealies in Africa  of beans, and sweet   otatoes, with oc- casional plantations of bananas, toui hed one another in almost uninterrupted suc - cession. In most of them we saw the Kikuyu women at work with their native hoes; for among the Kikuyus, as among other savages, the woman is the drudge and beast of burden. Our trail led by i tear, rushing streams, which formed the head waters of the Tana; among the trees fringing their banks were graceful palms, and there were groves of tree ferns here and there on the sides of the gorges. On the afternoon of the second day we struck upward among the steep foot- hills nf ihe mountain, riven by deep ravines. We pitched camp in an open glade, surrounded by ihe green wall of tangled forest, the forest of the tropical mountain sides. The trees, strange of kind and endless in variety, grew tall and close, laced to- gether by vine and Creeper, while under- brush crowded the space I  e tween their mossy trunks, and covered the leafy mould beneath. Toward dusk crested ibis  lew overhead, with harsh clamor, to seek their night roosts; parrots chattered, and a curi- ously homelike touch was given by the presence of a thrush in color and shape al- most exactly like our robin. Monkeys called in the depths of the forest, and after dark tree-frogs piped and croaked, and the tree hyraxcs uttered their wailing cries. Elephants dwelt permanently in this mountainous region of heavy woodland. On our march thither we had already seen their traces in the  shambas,  as the culti- vated fields of the natives are termed; for the great beasts arc fond of raiding the crops at night, and their inroads often do serious damage. In this neighborhood their habit is to live high up in the moun- tains, in the bamboos, while the weather is dry; the cows and calves keeping closer to the bamboos than the bulls. A spell of wet weather, such as we had fortunately been hav- ing, drives them down in the dense forest which covers the lower slopes. Here they may either pass all their time, or at night they may go still further down, into the open valley where the shambas lie; or they may occasionally still do what they habitually did in the days before the white hunters came, and wander far away, mak ing migrations that are sometimes seasonal, and sometimes irregular and unaccountable. Xo other animal, not the lion himself, is so constant a theme of talk, and a subject of such un- flagging interest round the camp-fires of African hunters and in the native 1 hc hy 'crie     lla  S of the African I'rocnaphoUfgiuii'i Ky l-.dumii.l Heller Go4 African Game Trails wilderness, as the elephant. Indeed the ele- phant has always profoundly impressed the imagination of mankind. It is. not only to hunters, but to naturalists, and to all jteople who possess any curiosity about wild creat- ures and the wild life of nature, the most in- teresting of all animals. Its huge hulk, its singular form, the value of its ivory, its great intelligence- in which it is only matched, it at all. by the highest a  es, and   ossibly by one or two of the highest carnivores and its varied habits, all combine to give it an interest such as attaches to no other living creature below the rank of man. In line of descent and in physical formation it stands by itself, wholly apart from all the other great land beasts, and differing from them even more widely than they differ from one another. The two existing S iecies  the African, which is the larger and finer animal, and the Asiatic differ from one another as much as they do from the mam- moth and similar extinct forms which were the contemporaries of early man in Europe and North America. The carvings of our palu-olithii forefathers, etched on bone by cavern dwellers, from whom we are sun- dered by ages which stretch into an imme- morial past, show that in their lives the hairy elephant of the north played the same part that his remote collateral descendant now plays in the lives of the savages who dwell under a vertical sun beside the tepid waters of the Nile and the Congo. In the first dawn of history, the sculpt- ured records of the kings of Egypt, Baby- lon, and Nineveh show the immense im- portance which attached in the eyes of the mightiest monarchsof the then world to the chase and the trophies of tliis great strange beast. The ancient civilization of India I loasls as one of its achievements the taming of the elephant: and in the ancient lore of that civilization the elephant plays a dis- tinguished part. The elephant is unique among the beasts of great bulk in the fact that his growth in size has been accompanied by growth in brain power. With other beasts growth in bulk of Ikh.1v has not been accompanied by similar growth of mind. Indeed sometimes there seems to have l een mental retrogres- sion. The rhinoceros, in several different forms, is found in the same regions as the elephant, and in one of its forms it is in point of size second only to the elephant among terrestrial animals. Seemingly the ancestors of the two creatures, in that pe- riod. separated from us by uncounted hun- dreds of thousands of years, which we may conveniently designate as late miocene or early pliocene, were substantially equal in brain development. But in one case in- crease in bulk seems to have induced leth- argy and atrophy of brain power, while in the other case brain and body have both grown. At any rate the elephant is now one of the wisest, and the rhinoceros one of the stupidest of big mammals. In conse- quence the elephant outlasts the rhino, although he is the largest, carries infinite- ly more valuable spoils, and is far more eagerly and persistently hunted. Both ani- mals wandered freely over the open country of East Africa thirty years ago. But ihe elephant learns by experience infinitely more readily than the rhinoceros. The former no longer lies in the open plains, and now even crosses them if possible at night Hut those rhinoceros which former- ly dwelt in the plains for the most part con tinue to dwell there until killed out. Not the most foolish elephant would under sim- ilar conditions behave as the rhinos that we studied and hunted by Kilimakin anti in the Sotik behaved. No elephant, in regions which have been hunted, would habitually spend its days lying or standing in the open plain; nor would it. in such places, rejK-atedly, and in fact uniformly, permit men to walk boldly up to it without heeding them until in its immediate neigh- borhood. The elephant's sight is bad, as is that of the rhinoceros; but a very brief ex K'rience with ritle-bearing man makes the formet take refuge in regions where scent and hearing count for more than sight; while no experience has any such effect ou the rhino. The rhinos that now live in the bush are the descendants of those whit h always lived in the bush ; and it i  in the bush that the species will linger long after it has vanished from the open, and it is in the bush that it is most formidable. Elephant and rhino differ as much in their habits as in their intelligence. The former i  very gregarious, herds of several hundred being sometimes found, and is of a restless, wandering temper, often shifting his abode and sometimes making long migrations The rhinoceros is a lover of solitude; it is usually found alone, or a   K.;.tiyu village anil jilun'a .ioti 1 r xt  u t j J.

Moreover, ii is comparatively stationary in its haliits, and us a general thing stays permanently in one neighborhood, not shifting its position for very many miles unless for grave reasons. The African elephant has recently been divided into a number of sub-species; but as within a century its range was continu ous over nearly the whole continent south of the Sahara, and as ii was given to such extensive occasional wanderings, it is prob- able that the examination of a sufficient series of specimens would show that on their confines these races grade into one another. In its essentials the beast i  al- most everywhere the same, although, of course, there must be variation of habit - with any animal which exists throughout sm Kikuvu village near firfi  icjihmt Ft mo .

The herd liee frvmtispiccel  eMinx uneasy wide and diversified a range of territory; for in one place it is found in high mountains, in another in a dry desert, in another in low- lying marshes or wet and dense forests. In Hast Africa the old bulls are usually found singly or in small parties by them selves. These have the biggest tusks; the bulls in ihe prime of life, the herd bulls or breeding bulls, which keep in herds with the cows and calves, usually have smaller ivory. Sometimes, however, very old but vigorous bulls are found with the cows; an  I I am inclined to think that the ordinary herd bulls at times also keep bv themselves, or at least in company with only a few cows, for at certain seasons, generally immediately after the rains, cows, most of them with calves, appear in great numt ers at certain places, where only a few bulls are ever found. Where undisturbed elephant rest, and wander about at all times of the day and night, and feed without much regard 650 to fixed hours, morning or evening, noon or midnight, the herd may be on the move, or its meml crs may Ijc resting; but during the hot noon they rarely or never feed, and or- dinarily stand almost still, resting for ele- phant almost never lie down unless sick. Where they are afraid of man. their only enemy, they come out to feed in thinly forested plains, or cultivated fields, when they do so at all, only at night, and before daybreak move back into the forest 10 rest. Where we were, on Kenia, the elephants sometimes moved down at night to feed in the shambas, at the expense of the crops of the natives, and sometimes stayed in the for- est, feeding by day or night on the branches they tore off tin- trees, or. occasionally, on the roots they grubl ed up with their tusks. They work vast havoc among the young or small growth of a forest, ami the readiness with which they uproot, overturn, or break off medium-sized trees conveys a striking h'rai   .i   AVr j   iv. m.'.'.

There is still hope that the feat may he per- formed; but hitherto its probable economic usefulness has for various reasons seemed so questionable that there has l een scant encouragement to undergo the necessary expense and labor. Up to the present time the African elephant has yielded only his ivory as an asset of value. This, however, lias been of such great value as well nigh to bring about the mighty beast s utter ex- termination. Ivor ' hunters and ivory trad- ers have  jcnetrated Africa to the haunts of the elephant since centuries before our era, and the elephant s boundaries have been slowly receding throughout historic time; but during the century just past its process Vol. XLVII. 67 has been immensely accelerated, until now there are hut one or two out-of-the-way nooks of the Dark Continent to the neigh- borhood of which hunter and trader have not penetrated. Fortunately the civilized powers which now divide dominion over Africa have waked up in time, and there is at present no danger of the extermination of the lord of all lour footed creatures. Large reserves have l een established on which various herds of elephants now live what is, at least for the time being, an en- tirely safe life. Furthermore, over great tracts of territory outside the reserves regu- lations have been promulgated which, if en- forced as they are now enforced, will pre- vent any excessive diminution of the herds. In British Last Africa, for instance, no cows are allowed to be shot save for special pur- poses, as for preservation in a museum, or to safeguard life and property; and no bulls 657 Mr. I  n -cvcll and bull clcpiant   iul ui Merit Fttittt u .     .h by Kcsii.it Rcc- crrfl with tusks weighing less than thirty pounds apiece. This renders safe almost all the females and an ample .supply of breeding males. Too much praise cannot be given the governments and the individuals who have brought about this happy result, ll would be a veritable and most tragic calamity if I lie lordly elephant, the giant among exist- ing four-footed creatures, should be   er- mitted lo vanish from the face of the earth. But of course protection is not perma- nently possible over the greater part of the country, which is well fitted for settlement; nor anywhere, if the herds grow too numer- ous. It would be not merely silly, but worse than silly, to try to stop all killing of elephants. The unchecked increase of any big and formidable wild beast, even though not a flesh eater, is incompatible with the existence of man when he has emerged from llu- stage of lowest savagery. This is not a matter of theory, but of proved fact. In place after place in Africa where pro- tection has been extended to hippopotamus or buffalo, rhinoceros or elephant, it has 05S been found necessary to withdraw it be- cause ihe protected animals did such dam- age to property, or became such menaces to human life. Among all four s  edes cows with calves often attack men without prov- ocation. and old bulls are at any time likely to become infected by a spirit of wanton and ferocious mischief and apt to become man killers. I know settlers who tried to pre- serve the rhinoceros whic h they found living on their big farms, and who were obliged to abandon the attempt, and themselves to kill the rhinos Ijecause of repeated and wan- ton attacks on human beings by the latter. Where we were by Neri, a year or two l e- fore our visit, the rhinos had become so dangerous, killing one white man and sev- eral natives, that the District Commissioner who preceded Mr. Browne was forced to undertake a crusade against them, killing fifteen. Both ill South Africa and on the Nile protection extended to hippopotamus has in places been wholly withdrawn be- cause of the damage done by the beasts to the crops of the natives, or because of their African Game Trails unprovoked assaults on canoes and boats. In one instance a Iasi surviving hippo was protected for years, but finally grew bold because of immunity, killed a bov in sheer wantonness, and had to be himself slain. In Uganda the buffalo were for years pro- tected, and grew go bold, killed so many natives, and ruined so many villages, that they are now classed as vermin and their destruction in every way encouraged. In the very neighljor- hood where I was hunting at Kenia, but six weeks before my coming, a cow  buffalo had w a n - dered down into the plains and run amuck, had at- tacked two villages, had killed a man and a boy, and had then been mobbed to death by the spearmen. Kle phant. when in numbers, and when not possessed of the fear of man, are more impossible neighbors than hip- po, rhino.or buffalo; but they are so ea- gerly sought after by ivory hunters that it is only rarely that they get the chance to become really dangerous to life, although in many places their ravages among the crops are severely felt by the unfortunate natives who live near them. The chase of the elephant, if persistently followed, entails more fatigue and hardship than any other kind of African liuniing. As regards ri k, it is hard to say whether it is more or less dangerous than the chase of the lion and the buffalo, both Cuning- hame and Tarllon, men of wide experience, ranked elephant hunting, in point of dan ger. as nearly on the level with lion hunt- ing. and as more dangerous than buffalo hunting; and all three kinds as far more dangerous than the chase uf the rhino. Personally, I believe the actual conflict with a lion, where the conditions arc the same, to be normally the more dangerous s jort; though far greater demands are made by elephant hunting on the qualities of per- sonal endurance and hardihood and reso- lute perseverance in the face of disap  oint- nu-nt and difficulty. Buffalo, seemingly, do not charge as freely as elephant, but are more dangerous when they do charge. Rhino when hunted, though at times ugly customers, seem to me c ertainly less dangerous than the other three; but from sheer stupid truculence they are themselves apt to take the offensive in unexpected fash- ion, being far more prone to such ag- gression than are any of the others  man-eating lions al- ways excepted. Very few of the native tribes in Africa hunt the ele- phant systematical- ly. But the  Ndo- robo, the wild bush people of F.ast Africa, somei imes catch young ele- phants in the pits they dig with slow labor, and very rare- ly they kill one with a kind of harpoon. The 'Ndorobo are doubtless in part descended from some primitive bush  jeople, but in part also derive their blood from the more advanced tribes near which their wandering families happen to live; and they grade into the lat- ter. by speech and through individuals who seem to stand half way between. Thus we had with us two Masai  Ndorobo, true wild   eople, who spoke a bastard Masai; who had formerly hunted with Cuning- hame. and who came to us because of their ancient friendship with him. These shy woods creatures were afraid to come to Neri by daylight, when we were camped there, but after dark crept to Cuning- hame s tent. Cuninghame gave them two A cow elephant 1 roju a pliotogrnph l,j L  . CuinrictM.T.t African Game Trails fine red blankets, and put them to sleep in a little tent, keeping their spears in his own tent, as a measure of precaution to prevent their running away. The elder of the two, he informed me, would certainly have a fit of hysterics when we killed our elephant  C'uninghame was also joined by other old friends of former hunts, Kikuyu 'Ndorobo these, who spoke Kikuyu like the people who cultivated the fields that cov- ered the river bottoms and hillsides of the adjoining open country, and who were, in- deed, merely outlying, forest-dwelling mem- bers of the lowland tribes. In the deep woods we met one old Derobo, who had no connection with any more advanced tribe, whose sole Indongings were his s  ear. skin cloak. an l fire stick, and who lived purely on honey and game; unlike the bas- tard  Ndoroho, he was ornamented with neither paint nor grease. But the  Ndo- robo who were our guides stood farther up in the social scale. The men passed most of their lime in the forest, but up the moun- tain sides they had squalid huls on little clearings, with shambas, where their wives raised scanty crops. To the 'Ndorobo, and to them alone, the vast, thick forest was an open l ook; without their aid as guides both C uninghame and our own gun-bearers were at fault, and found their way around with great difficulty and slowness. The bush  ieople had nothing in the way of clothing Save a blanket over the shoulders, but wore the usual paint and grease and ornaments; each carried a spear which might have a long and narrow, or short and broad blade; two of them wore head- dresses of tripe skull-caps made from the inside of a sheep's stomach. For two days after reaching our camp in the open glade on the mountain side it rained. We were glad of this, because it meant that the elephants would not be in ihe bamboos, and C uninghame and the  Ndorobo went ot7 to hunt for fresh signs. C'uninghame is as skilful an elephant hunt- er as can be found in Africa, and is one of the very few white men able to help even the wild bushmen at their work. By the afternoon of the second day they were fair- ly well satisfied as to the whereabouts of the quarry. The following morning a fine rain was still falling when C'uninghame, Heller, and I started on our hunt; but by noon it had stopped. Of course we went in single hie and on foot; not even a bear hunter from the cane-brakes of the lower Mississippi could ride through that forest. We left our home camp standing, taking blankets and a coat and change of underclothing for each of us, and two small Whymper tents, with enough food for three clays; 1 also took my wash kit and a lx ok from the pigskin library. First marched the  Ndorobo guides, each with his spear, his blanket round his shoulders, and a little bundle of com and sweet potato. Then came Cuninghame, followed by his gun-bcarer. Then I came, clad in khaki-colored flannel shirt and kha- ki trousers buttoning down the legs, with hob-nailed shoes and a thick slouch hat; I had intended to wear rublxr-solcd shoes, but the soaked ground was too slippery. My two gun-bearers followed, carrying the Holland and the Springfield. Then came Heller, at the head of a dozen  X rters and skinners; he and they were to fall liehind when we actually struck fresh elephant spoor, but to follow our trail l v the help of a Derobo who was left with them. For three hours our route lay along the edge of the woods. We climbed into and out of deep ravines in which groves of tree ferns clustered. Wre waded through streams of swift water, whose course was broken by cataract and rapid. We passed through shambas. and by the doors of little hamlets of thatched beehive huts. We met llocks of goats and hair ", fat-tailed sheep guarded by boys; strings of burden- bearing women stood meekly to one side to let us pass; parties of young men sauntered by, S n-ar in hand. Then we struck into the great forest, and in an instant the sun was shut from sight by the thit k screen of wet foliage. It was a riot of twisted vines, interlacing the trees and bushes. Only the elephant paths, which, of every age, crossed and recrossed it hither and thither, made it passable. One of the chief difficulties in hunting ele- phants in the forest is that it is impossible to travel, except very slowly anil with much noise, off these trails, so that it is some- times very difficult to take advantage of the wind; and although the sight of the ele- phant is dull, both its sense of hearing and its sense of smell are exceedingly acute. Hour after hour we worked our way on- ward through tangled forest and matted A cow elephant l-K.n  m  tlioto f.tpli k. .1 Cuuin liAine. jungle. There was little sign of bird nr animal life, and a troop of long-haired black and white monkeys bounded away among the tree tops. Here and there brilliant flowers lightened the gloom. Wc ducked under vines and climbed over fallen timl r. Poisonous nettles stung our hands. We were drenched by the wet boughs which we brushed aside. Mosses and ferns grew rank and close. The trees were of strange kinds. There were huge trees with little leaves, and small trees with big leaves. There were trees with bare, fleshy limbs, that writhed out through the neighboring branches, bearing sparse clus- ters of large frondage. In places the forest was low, the trees thirty or forty feet high, the bushes that choked the ground between, 661 Maj  showing ilie lyr iliur  1  'i Mr- RoOtcwlt   -rt.c c  fifteen   r twenty feet high. In other places mighty monarclis of the wood, straight and t:ill, towered aloft to an immense height: among them were trees whose smooth, round holes were spotted like sycamores, while far above our heads their gracefully spreading branches were hung with vines like mistletoe and draped with Spanish moss; trees whose surfaces were corrugated and knotted a  if they were made of 1 mndles of great creepcrs; and giants whose but- tressed irimks were four times a man s length across. Twice wc got on elephant spoor, once of a single bull, once of a party of three. Then Cuninghame and the  N'dorobo re- doubled their caution. They would mi- nutely examine the fresh dung; and above all they continually tested the wind, scan- ning the tree tops, and lighting matches to see from the smoke what the eddies were near the ground. Eac h lime after an hour s stealthy stepping and crawling along the twisted trail a slight shift of the wind in the almost still air gave our scent to the game, and away it went   efore we could catch a glimpse of it, and we resumed our walk. The elephant paths lei  up hill and down  for the leasts are wonderful climbers  662 and wound in and out in even,  direction. They were marked by broken branches and the splintered and shattered trunks of the smaller trees, especially where the elephant had stood and fed, trampling down the bushes for many yards around. Where they had crossed the marshy valleys they had punched big round holes, three feet deep, in the sticky mud. As evening fell we pitched camp by the side of a little brook at the bottom of a ra- vine, and dined ravenously on bread, mut- ton, anti tea. The air was keen, and under our blankets we slept in comfort until dawn, breakfast was soon over anti camp struck: and once more we began our cautious prog- ress through the dim. cool archways of the mountain forest. Two hours after leaving camp we came across the fresh trail of a small herd of perhaps ten or fifteen elephant cows and calves, but including two big herd bulls. At once we ttiok up the trail. Cuninghame and his bush people consulted again and again, scanning every track anti mark with minute attention. The sign showed that the elephants had fed in the shamhas early in the night, had then returned to the mountain, and stood in one place resting African Game Trails for several hours, and had left this sleep- ing ground some time l efore we reached it. After we had followed the trail a short while v.e made the ex  eriment of Irving to force our own way through the jungle, so as to get the wind more favorable; but our prog- ress was too slow and noisy, and we re- turned to the path the elephants had beaten. Then the  Ndorolxi went ahead, travelling parallel thereto. It was about noon. The elephants moved slowly, and we listened to the Inmghs crack, and now and then to the curious internal rumblings of ihe t'reat beasts. Carefully, every sense on the alert, we kept pace with them. My double- barrel was in mv hands, and wherever    s- sible, as I followed the trail, I stepped in the huge footprints of the elephant, for ,  %v tt T buck I'ntrn   v KctmH Ho.- t noiselessly ami at speed. Oneof them was clad in a white blanket, and another in a red one, which were conspicuous; but they were too silent and cautious t   let the beasts see them, and could tell exactly where they were and what they were doing by the sounds. W hen these trackers waited for us they would appear lx;fore us like ghosts; once one of them dropped down from the branches above, having climbed a tree with monkey like agility to get a glimpse of the great game. At last we could hear the elephants, and under Cuninghame s lead we walked more cautiously than ever. The wind was right, and the trail of one elephant led close alongside that of the rest of the herd, and where such a weight had pressed there were no slicks left to crack under my feet. It made our veins thrill thus for half an hour to creep stealthily along, but a few rods from the herd, never able to see it. be- cause of the extreme denseness of the cover, but always hearing first one and then an- other of its members, and always trying to guess what each one might do. and keeping ceaselessly ready for whatever might befall. A ll K'k of hornliills flew up with noisy i lam- or, but the elephants did not heed them. At last we came in sight of the mighty- game, The trail took a twist to one side, and there, thirty yards in front of us, we made out part of the gray and massive head of an elephant resting his tusks on the Mr. Roo evclt s an .1 Kenoit'i camp near which they got  he rhino ftftd etepJant From 4 phoiitgr pfc by K mit Ro  i  clt. branches of a young tree elephants hard- ly ever feed a  noon. A couple of minutes passed before, by cautious scrutiny, we were able to tell whether the animal we could set- was a cow or a bull, anti whether, if a bull, it carried heavy enough horns. Then we saw that it was a big bull with good ivory. It turned its head in my direction and 1 saw its eye; and I fired a little to one side of the eye, at a sjtot which 1 thought would lead to die brain. I struck exactly where I aimed, but the head of an elephant is enor- mous and the brain small, and the bullet missed it. However, the shock momenta- rily stunned the beast. He stumbled for ward, halt falling, and as he recovered I fired with the second barrel, again aiming for the brain. This lime the bullet sited true, and as I lowered the rille from my shoulder, I saw the great lord of the forest come crashing to the ground. But at that very instant, before there was a moment s time in which to reload, 664 the thick bushes parted immediately on my left front, and through them surged the vast bulk of a charging bull elephant, the matted mass of tough cree  ers snapping like packthread before his rush. He was so close that he could have touched me with his trunk. I leaj ed to one side and dodged behind a tree trunk,opening the rille, throw- ing out the empty shells, and slipping in two cartridges. Meanwhile Cuninghame tired right ami left, at the same time throwing himself into the bushes on the other side. Both his bullets went home, and the bull stopped short in his charge, wheeled, and immediately disapfieared in the thick cov- er. We ran forward, but the forest had i losed over his wake. We heard him trum- pet shrilly, and then all sounds ceased. The  Ndorobo, who had quite properly disap teared when this second bull charged, now went forward and soon returned with the rejiort that he had fled at sf ecd, but was evidently hard hit, as there was much blood -a African Game Trails 605 on ihe spoor. If we had been only after ivory we should have followed him at once; but there was no telling how long a chase he might lead us; and as we desired to save the skin of the dead elephant entire, there was no time whatever to spare. It is a formidable task, occupying many days, to preserve an elephant for mounting in a museum, and if the skin is to be properly saved, it must be taken off without an hour's unnecessary delay. So back we turned to where the dead tusker lay, and 1 felt proud indeed as I stood by the immense bulk of the slain monster and put my hand on the ivory. The tusks weighed a hundred and twenty pounds the pair. There was the usual scene of joyful excitement among the gun- bearers who had behaved excellently  and among the wild bush people who had done the tracking for us; and, as Cuning- hame had predicted, the old Masai Derobo, from pure delight, proceeded to have hys- terics on the body of the dead elephant. The scene was repeated when Heller and the porters appeared half an hour later. Then, chattering like monkeys, and as happy as possible, all, porters, gun-bearers, and  Ndorobo alike, began the work of skinning and cutting up the quarry, under the leadership and supervision of Ileller and Cuninghame, and soon they were all splashed with blood from head to foot. One of the trackers took off his blanket and squatted stark naked inside the carcass the better to use his knife. Each laborer rewarded himself by cutting off strips of meat for his private store, and hung them in red festoons from the branches round about. There was no let-up in the work until it was stopped by darkness. Our tents were pitched in a small open glade a hundred yards from the dead ele- phant. The night was clear, the stars shone brighdy, and in the west the young moon hung just above the line of tall tree tops. Fires were speedily kindled and the men sat around them, feasting and singing in a strange minor tone until late in the night. The flickering light left them at one moment in black obscurity, and the next brought into bold relief their sinewy crouching figures, their dark faces, gleam- ing eyes, and flashing teeth. When they did sleep, two of the  Ndorobo slept so close to the fire as to burn themselves; an Vol. XLVII. 68 accident to which they arc prone, judging from the many scars of old burns on their legs. I toasted sliccs of elephant s heart on a pronged stick before the lire, and found it delicious; for I was hungry and the night was cold. We talked of our success and exulted over it, and made our plans for the morrow; and then we turned in under our blankets for another night s sleep. Next morning some of the  Ndorobo went off on the trail of Cuninghame s ele- phant to see if it had fallen, but found that it had travelled steadily, though its wounds were probably mortal. There was no ob- ject in my staying, for Heller and Cuning- hame would be busy for the next ten days, and would ultimately have to use all the porters in taking off and curing the skin, and transporting it to Neri; so I made up my mind to go down to the plains for a hunt by myself. Taking one porter to carry my bedding, and with my gun-bearers, and a Derobo as guide, I struck off through the forest for the main camp, reaching it early in the afternoon. Thence I bundled off a safari to Cuninghame and Heller, with food for a week, and tents and clothing, and en- joyed the luxury of a shave and a warm bath. Next day was spent in writing and making preparations for my own trip. A Kikuyu chief, clad in a cloak of hyrax skins, and earning his war spear, came to con- gratulate me on killing the elephant and to present me with a sheep. Early the follow- ing morning everything was in readiness; the bull-necked porters lifted their loads, I stepped out in front, followed by my led horse, and in ten hours  march we reached Neri boma, with its neat buildings, its trees, and its well-kept flower beds. My hunting and travelling during the following fortnight will be told in the next chapter. On the evening of September 6th we were all together again at Mem boma, on the north-eastern slopes of Kenia  Kermit, Tarlton, Cuninghame, Heller, and 1. Thanks to the unfailing kindness of the Commissioner, Mr. Horne, we were given full information of the elephant in the neighborhood. He had no  Ndorobo, but among the Wa-Meru, a wild martial tribe, who lived close around him, there were a number of hunters, or at least of men who knew the forest and the game, and these had been instructed to bring in any news. 066 African Game Trails Wc had, of course, no idea that elephant would be found close at hand. But next morning, about eleven, Horne came to our camp with four of his black scouts, who re- ported that three elephants were in a patch of thick jungle beside the shambas, not three miles away. Horne said that the ele- phants were cows, that they had been in the neighborhood some days, devastating the shambas, and were bold and fierce, having charged some men who sought to drive them away from the cultivated fields; it is curious to see how little heed these elephants pay to the natives. 1 wished a cow for the Museum, and also another bull. So off we started at once, Kcrmit carrying his camera. I slipped on my rubber-soled shoes, and had my gun-bearcrs accompany me barefooted, with the Holland and the Springfield rifles. We followed foot paths among the fields until we reached the edge of the jungle in which the elephants stood. This jungle lay beside the forest, and at this point separated it from the fields. It consisted of a mass of rank-growing bushes, allied to the cotton plant, ten or twelve feel high, with only here and there a tree. It was not good ground in which to hunt elephant, for the tangle was practically impenetrable to a hunter save along the elephant trails, whereas the elephants them- selves could move in any direction at will, with no more difficulty than a man would have in a hay field. The bushes in most places rose just above their backs, so that they were completely hid from the hunter even a few feet away. Yet the cover af- forded no shade to the mighty beasts, and it seemed strange that elephants should stand in it at mid-day with the sun out. There they were, however, for, looking cautiously into the cover from behind the bushes on a slight hill crcst quarter of a mile off. we could just make out a huge ear now and then as it lazily flapped. On account of the wind we had to go well to one side before entering the jungle. Then in wc went in single file, Cuninghame and Tarlton leading, with a couple of our naked guides. The latter showed no great desire to get too close, explaining that the elephants were  very fierce.  Once in the jungle, we trod as quietly as possible, threading our way along the elephant trails, which crossed and recrosscd one another. Evidently it was a favorite haunt, for the sign was abundant, both old and new. In the impenetrable cover it was quite impos- sible to tell just where the elephants were, and twice we sent one of the savages up a tree to locate the game. The last time the watcher, who stayed in the tree, indicated by signs that the elephant were not far off; and his companions wished to lead us round to where the cover was a little lower and thinner. But to do so would have given them our wind, and Cuninghame re- fused, taking into his own hands the man- agement of the stalk. 1 kept my heavy rifle at the ready, and on wc went, in watchful silence, prepared at any moment for a charge. We could not tell at what second we might catch our first glimpse at very close quarters of  the beast that hath between his eyes the serpent for a hand,  and when thus surprised the temper of  the huge earth-shaking beast  is sometimes of the shortest. Cuninghame and Tarlton stopped for a moment to consult; Cuninghame stooped, and Tarlton mounted his shoulders and stood upright, steadying himself by my hand. Down he came and told us that he had seen a small tree shake seventy yards distant; although upright on Cuninghame s shoulders he could not see the elephant it- self. Forward we stole for a few yards, and then a piece of good luck befell us, for we came on the trunk of a great fall- en tree, and Scrambling up, we found our- selves perchcd in a row six feot above the ground. The highest part of the trunk was near the root, far Jiest from where the elephants were; and though it offered pre- carious footing, it also offered the best look- out. Thither 1 balanced, and looking over the heads of my companions T at once made out the elephant. At first I could see noth- ing but the shaking branches, and one huge ear occasionally flapping. Then I made out the car of another beast, and then the trunk of a third was uncurled, lifted, and curled again; it showered its back with earth. The watcher we had left behind in the tree top coughed; the elephants stood motionless, and up went the biggest ele- phant s trunk, feeling for the wind; the watcher coughed again, and then the bushes and saplings swayed and parted as three black bulks came toward us. The cover was so high that we could not see their tusks, only the tops of their heads and their African Game Trails 007 backs being visible. The leader was the biggest, and at it I fired when it was sixty yards away, and nearly broadside on, but heading slightly toward me. 1 had pre- viously warned every one to kneel. The recoil of the heavy rifle made me rock, as I stood unsteadily on my perch, and I failed to hit the brain. But the bullet, only miss- ing the brain by an inch or two, brought the elephant to its knees; as it rose I floored it with the second barrel. The blast of the big rifle, by the way, was none too pleasant for the other men on the log and made Cuninghame s nose bleed. Reloading, 1 fired twice at the next animal, which was now turning. It stumbled and nearly fell, but at the same moment the first one rose again, and I fired both barrels into its head, bringing it once more to the ground. Once again it rose an elephant's brain is not an e3sy mark to hit under such conditions  but as it moved slowly off, half stunned, I snatched the little Springfield rifle, and this time shot true, sending the bullet into its brain. As it fell 1 took another shot at the wounded elephant, now disapjiearing in the forest, but without effect. On walking up to our prize it proved to be not a cow, but a good-sized adult  but not old  herd bull, with thick, short tusks, weighing about forty pounds apiece. Or- dinarily, of course, a bull, and not a cow, is what one desires, although on this occa- sion I needed a cow to complete the group for the Museum. However, Heller and Cuninghame spent the next few days in preserving the skin, and I was too much pleased with our luck to feel inclined to grumble. We were back in camp five hours after leaving it. Our gun-bearers usually felt it incumbent on them to keep a digni- fied bearing while in our company. But the death of an elephant is always a great event; and one of the gun-bearers, as they walked ahead of us campward, soon began to improvise a song, reciting the success of the hunt, the death of the elephant, and the power of the rifles; and gradually, as they got further ahead, the more light-hearted among them began to give way to their spir- its,and they came into campfrolicking, gam- bolling, and dancing as if they were still the naked savages that they had been before they became the white man s followers. Two days later Kermit got his bull. He and Tarlton had camped about ten miles off in a magnificent forest, and late the first afternoon received news that a herd of ele- phants was in the neighborhood. They were off by dawn, and in a few hours came on the herd. It consisted chiefly of cows and calves, but there was one big master bull, with fair tusks. It was open forest with long grass. By careful stalking they got within thirty yards of the bull, behind whom was a line of cows. Kermit put both barrels of his heavy double .450 into the tusker s head, but without even stag- gering him; and as he walked off Tarlton also fired both barrels into him, with no more effect; then, as he slowly turned, Ker- mit killed him with a shot in the brain from the .405 Winchester. Immediately the cows lifted their ears, and began trumpeting and threatening; if they had come on in a body at that distance, there was not much chance of turning them or of escaping from them; and after standing stock still for a minute or two, Kermit and Tarlton stole quietly off for a hundred yards, and waited until the anger of the cows cooled and they had moved away, before going up to the dead bull. Then they followed the herd again, and Kermit got some photos which, as far as I know, arc at least as good as any that have ever been taken of wild elephant. He took them close up, at imminent risk of a charge. The following day the two hunters rode back to Meru, making a long circle. The elephants they saw were not worth shooting, but they killed the finest rhinoceros we hail yet seen. They saw it in an open space of tall grass, surrounded by lantana brush, a flowering shrub with close-growing stems, perhaps twenty feet high and no thicker than a man s thumb; it forms a favorite cover for elephant and rhinoceros, and is well-nigh impenetrable to hunters. Fort- unately this particular rhino was outside it, and Kermit and Tarlton got up to about twenty-five yards from him. Kermit then put one bullet behind his shoulders, and as lie whipped round to charge, another bullet on the point of his shoulders; although mortally wounded, he showed no signs whatever of being hurt, and came at the hunters with great speed and savage desire to do harm. Then an extraordinary thing happened. Tarlton fired, inflicting merely a flesh wound in one shoulder, and the big, fearsome brute, which had utterly disre- 008 African Game Trails gardecl the two fatal shots, on receiving this flesh wound, wheeled and ran. Both firing, they killed him before he had gone many yards. He was a bull, with a thirty- inch horn. By this time Cuninghame and Heller had finished the skin and skeleton of the bull they were preserving. Near the carcass Heller trapped an old male leopard, a sav- age beast; its skin was in fine shape, but it was not fat, and weighed just one hundred pounds. Now we all joined, and shifted camp to a point eight or nine miles distant from Meru boma, and fifteen hundred feet lower among the foot-hills. It was much hotter at this lower level; palms were among the trees that bordered the streams. On the day we shifted camp Tarlton and I rode in advance to look for elephants, fol- lowed by our gun-bearers and half a dozen wild Meru hunters, each carrying a spear or a Itow and arrows. When we reached the hunting grounds, open country with groves of trees 3nd patches of jungle, the Meru went off in every direction to find ele- phant. We waited their return under a tree, by a big stretch of cultivated ground. The region was well peopled, and all the way flown the path had led between fields, where the Meru women were tilling with their adze-like hoes, and banana planta- tions, where among the banana trees other trees had been planted, and the yarn vines trained up their trunks. These cool, shady banana plantations, fenced in with tall hedges and bordered by rapid brooks, were really very attractive. Among them were scattered villages of conical thatched huts, and level places plastered with cow dung on which the grain was threshed; it was then stored in huts raised on posts. There were herds of cattle, and flocks of sheep and goats; and among the burdens the women bore we often saw huge bottles of milk. In the shambas there were platforms, and sometimes regular thatched huts, placed in the trees; these were for the watchers, who were to keep the elephants out of the sham- bas at night. Some of the natives wore girdles of banana leaves, looking, as Kermit said, much like the pictures of savages in Sunday-school l  oks. Early in the afternoon some of the scouts returned with news that three bull ele- phants were in a piece of forest a couple of miles distant, and thither we went. It was an open grove of heavy thorn timber be- side a strip of swamp; among the trees the grass grew tall, and there were many thickets of arbutelon, a flowering shrub a dozen feet high. On this the elephant were feeding. Tarlton rs favorite sport was lion hunting, but he was also a lirsl-class ele- phant hunter, and he brought me up to these bulls in fine style. Although only three hundred yards away, it took us two hours to get close to them. Tarlton and the  shenzis  wild natives, in Swahili  a kind of African chinook   wa-shenzi   who were with us, climbed tree after tree, first to place the eiephants, and then to sec if they carried ivory heavy enough to war- rant my shooting them. At last Tarlton brought me to within fifty yards of them. Two were feeding in bush which hid them from view, and the third stood between, facing us. We could only see the top of his head and back, not his tusks, and could not tell whether he was worth shooting. Much puzzled we stood where we were, peering anxiously at the huge half-hidden game. Suddenly there was a slight eddy in the wind, up went the elephant s trunk, twist- ing to and fro in the air; evidently he could not catch a clear scent; but in another mo- ment we saw the three great dark forms moving gently off through the bush. As rapidly as possible, following the trails al- ready tram  ed by the elephants, we walked forward, and after a hundred yards Tarlton pointed to a big bull with good tusks stand- ing motionless behind some small trees seventy yards distant. As I aimed at his head he started to move off; the first bullet from the heavy Holland brought him to his knees, and as he rose I knocked him flat with the second. He struggled to rise; but, both firing, we kept him down; and I fin- ished him with a bullet in the brain from the little Springfield. Although rather younger than either of the bulls I had al- ready shot, it was even larger. In its stomach were beans from the shambas, ar- butdon tips, and bark, and especially the twigs, leaves, and white blossoms of a smaller shrub. The tusks weighed a little over a hundred pounds the pair. We still needed a cow for the Museum; and a couple of days later, at noon, a party of natives brought in word that they had seen two cows in a spot five miles away. Piloted by a naked spearman, whose hair African Game Trails 6G9 was done into a cuc, wc rode toward the place. For most of the distance we fol- lowed old elephant trails, in some places mere tracks beaten down through stiff grass which stood above the head of a man on horseback, in some places paths rutted deep into the earth. We crossed a river, where monkeys chattered among the tree tops. On an open plain we saw a rhinoc- eros cow trotting off with her calf. At last we came to a hill-top with, on the summit, a noble fig-tree, whose giant limbs were stretched over the palms that clustered be- neath. Here wc left our horses and went forward on foot, crossing a palm fringed stream in a little valley. From the next rise wc saw the backs of the elephants as they stood in a slight valley, where the rank grass grew ten or twelve feel high. It was some lime before we could see the ivory so as to be sure of exac tly what we were shoot- ing. Then the biggest cow began to move slowly forward, and we walked nearly par- allel to her, along an elephant trail, until from a slight knoll I got a clear view of her at a distance of eighty yards. As she walked leisurely along, almost broadside to me, I fired the right barrel of the Holland into her head, knocking her flat down with the shock; and when she rose I put a bullet from the left barrel through her heart, again knocking her completely off her feet; and this time she fell permanently. She was a very old cow, and her ivory was rather better than in the average of her sex in this neighborhood, the tusks weighing about eighteen pounds apiece. She had been ravaging the shambas over night which accounted in part for the natives being so eager to show her to me and in addition to leaves and grass, her stomach contained quantities of beans. There was a young one just out of calfhood, and quite able to take care of itself with her; it ran off as soon as the mother fell. Early next morning Cuninghame and Heller shifted part of the safari to the stream near where the dead elephant lay, intending lo spend the following three days in taking off and preparing the skin. Meanwhile Tarlton. Kcrmit, and 1 were to try our luck in a short hunt on the other side of Meru boma, at a little crater lake called Lake Ingouga. We could not get an early start, and reached Meru too late to push on to the lake the same day. The following morning we marched to the lake in two hours and a half. We spent an hour in crossing a broad longue of wood- land that stretched down from the wonder- ful mountain forest lying higher on the slopes. The trail was blind in many places because elephant paths of every age con- tinually led along and across it, some of them being much better marked than the trail itself, as it twisted through the sun- flecked shadows underneath the great trees. Then we came out on high downs, covered with tall grass and littered with volcanic stones and broken by ravines which were choked with der.se underbrush. There were high hills, and to the left of the downs, toward Kenia, these were clad in forest. We pitched our tents on a steep cliff over- looking the crater lake or pond, as il might more properly be called. It was bordered with sedge, and through the wa- ter-lilies on its surface we saw ihe reflec- tion of the new moon after nightfall. Here and there thick forest came down to the brink, and through this, on op K site sides of the pond, deeply worn elephant paths, evidently travelled for ages, wound down to the water. That evening we hunted for bush buck, but saw none. While sitting on a hillock at dusk, watching for game, a rhino trotted up to inspect us, with ears cocked forward and tail erect. A rhino always has some- thing comic about it, like a pig, formidable though it at times is. This one carried a poor horn, and therefore we were pleased when at last it trotted off without obliging us lo shoot it. We saw new kinds of why- dah birds, one with a yellow breast, one with white in its tail; at this altitude the cocks were still in full plumage, although it was just past the middle of September; whereas at Xaivasha they had begun to lose their long tail feathers nearly two months previously. On returning to camp we received a note from Cuninghame saying that Heller had been taken seriously sick, and Tarlton had to go to them. This left Kermit and me to take our two days  hunt together. One day we got nothing. We saw game on the open downs, but it was too wary, and though we got within twenty-five yards of eland in thick cover, we could only make out a cow, and she took fright and ran with- out our ever getting a glimpse of the bull   070 African Game Trails that was with her. Late in the afternoon we saw an elephant a mile and a half away, crossing a corner of the open downs. We followed its trail until the light grew too dim for shooting, lmt never overtook it, al- though at the last we could hear it ahead of us breaking the branches; and we made our way back to camp through the darkness. The other day made amends. It was Kermit s turn to shoot an elephant, and mine to shoot a rhinoceros; and each of us was to ac t as the backing gun for the other. In the forenoon, we saw a bull rhino with a good horn walking over the open downs. A convenient hill enabled us to cut him off without difficulty, and from its summit we killed him at the base, fifty or sixty yards off. His front born was nearly twenty- nine inches long; but though he was an old bull, his total length, from tip of nose to tip of tail, was only twelve feet, and he was, I should guess, not more than two-thirds the bulk of the big bull I killed in the Sotik. We rested for an hour or two at noon, under the shade of a very old tree with glossy leaves, and orchids growing on its gnarled, hoary limbs, while the unsaddled horses grazed, and the gi ..-bearers slept near by, the cool mountain air, although this was mid-day under the equator, mak- ing them prefer the sunlight to the shade. When we moved on it was through a sea of bush ten or fifteen feet high, dotted here and there with trees; and riddled in every direction by the trails of elephant, rhinoc- eros, and buffalo. Each of these animals frequents certain kinds of country to which the other two rarely or never penetrate; but here they all three found ground to their liking. Except along their winding trails, which were tunnels where the jungle was tall, it would have been practically impos- sible to traverse the thick and matted cover in which they had made their abode. We could not tell what moment we might find ourselves face to face with some big beast at such close quarters as to insure a charge, and we moved in cautious silence, our rifles in our hands. Rhinoceros were especially plentiful, and we continually came across not only their tracks, but the dusty wallows in which they rolled, and where they came to deposit their dung. The fresh sign of elephant, however, dis- tracted our attention from the lesser game, and we followed the big footprints eagerly, now losing the trail, now finding it again. At last near a clump of big trees we caught sight of three huge, dark bodies ahead of us. The wind was right, and we stole toward them, Kermit leading, and I immediately behind. Through the tangled branches their shapes loomed in vague outline; but we saw that one had a pair of long tusks, and our gun-bearers unanimously pro- nounced it a big bull, with good ivory. A few more steps gave Kermit a chance at its head, at about sixty yards, and with a bullet from his .405 Winchester he floored the mighty l east. It rose, and we both fired in unison, bringing it down again; but as we came up it struggled to get on its feet, roaring savagely, and once more we both fired together. This finished it. W e were disappointed at finding that it was not a bull; but it was a large cow, with tusks over five feet long a very unusual length for a cow one weighing twenty-five, and the other twenty-two pounds. Our experience had convinced us that both the Winchester .405, and the Spring- field .300 would do good work with ele- phants; although I kept to my belief that, for such very heavy game, my Holland .500-.450 was an even better weapon. Not far from where this elephant fell Tarlton had, the year before, witnessed an interesting incident. He was watching a small herd of elephants, cows and calves, which were in the open, when he saw them begin to grow uneasy. Then, with a shrill lrum  ct, a cow approached a bush, out of which bounded a big lion. Instantly all the cows charged him, and he fled as fast as his legs would carry him for the forest, two hundred yards distant. He just managed lo reach the cover in safety; and then the infuriated cows, in their anger at his escape, demolished the forest for several rods in every direction. TALES OF MEN THE EYES By Edith Wharton I E had been put in the mood for ghosts, that evening, after an excellent dinner at our old friend Culwin s, by a tale of Fred Mur- chard s the narrative of a strange personal visitation. Seen through the haze of our cigars, and by the drowsy gleam of a coal fire, Culwin s library, with its oak walls and dark old bindings, made a good setting for such evo- cations; and ghostly experiences at first hand being, after Murchard s brilliant open- ing, the only kind acceptable to us, we pro- ceeded to take stock of our group and tax each member for a contribution. There were eight of us, and seven contrived, in a manner more or less adequate, to fulfil the condition imposed. It surprised us all to find that we could muster such a show of supernatural impressions, for none of us, excepting Murchard himself and young Phil Frcnham whose story was the slightest of the lot had the habit of sending our souls into the invisible. So that, on the whole, we had every reason to be proud of our seven  exhibits,  and none of us would have dreamed of expecting an eighth from our host. Our old friend, Mr. Andrew Cuhvin, who had sat back in his arm-chair, listening and blinking through the smoke circles with the cheerful tolerance of a wise old idol, was not the kind of man likely to be favoured with such contacts, though he had imagination enough to enjoy, without en- vying, the superior privileges of his guests. By age and by education he belonged to the stout Positivist tradition, and his habit of thought had been formed in the days of the epic struggle between physics and meta- physics. But he had been, then and always, essentially a spectator, a humorous de- tached observer of the immense muddled variety show of life, slipping out of his scat now and then for a brief dip into the con- vivialities at the back of the house, but never, as far as one knew, showing the least desire to jump on the stage and do a  turn.  Among his contemporaries there lingered a vague tradition of his having, at a re- mote period, and in a romantic clime, been wounded in a duel; but this legend no more tallied with what we younger men knew of his character than my mother s assertion that he had once been  a charming little man with nice eyes  corresponded to any possible reconstitution of his dry thwarted physiognomy.  He never can have looked like any- thing but a bundle of sticks,  Murchard had once said of him.  Or a phosphor- escent log, rather,  some one else amended; and we recognized the happiness of this description of his small squat trunk, with the red blink of the eyes in a face like mottled bark. He had always been pos- sessed of a leisure which he had nursed and protected, instead of squandering it in vain activities. His carefully guarded hours had been devoted to the cultivation of a fine intelligence and a few judiciously chosen habits; and none of the disturb- ances common to human experience seemed to have crossed his sky. Neverthe- less, his dispassionate survey of the uni- verse had not raised his opinion of that costly experiment, and his study of the human race seemed to have resulted in the conclusion that all men were superfluous, and women necessary only because some one had to do the cooking. On the im- portance of this point his convictions were absolute, and gastronomy was the only sci- ence which he revered as; dogma. It must be owned that his little dinners were a strong argument in favour of this view, be- sides being a reason though not the main one for the fidelity of his friends. Mentally he exercised a hospitality less seductive but no less stimulating. His mind was like a forum, or some open meet- 671 672 The Eyes ing-place for the exchange of ideas: some- what cold and draughty, but light, spa- cious and orderly a kind of academic grove from which all the leaves had fallen. In this privileged area a dozen of us were wont to stretch our muscles and expand our lungs; and, as if to prolong as much a  pos- sible the tradition of what wc felt to be a vanishing institution, one or two neophytes were now and then added to our band. Young Phil Frenham was the last, and the most interesting, of these recruits, and a good example of Murchard s somewhat morbid assertion that our old friend  liked  em juicy.  It was indeed a fact that Cul- win, for all his mental dryness, specially tasted the lyric qualities in youth. As he was far too good an Epicurean to nip the flowers of soul which he gathered for his garden, his friendship was not a disinte- grating influence: on the contrary, it forced the young idea to robustcr bloom. And in Phil Frenham he had a fine subject for ex- perimentation. The boy was really intelli- gent, and the soundness of his nature was like the pure paste under a delicate glaze. Cuhvin had fished him out of a thick fog of family dulness, and pulled him up to a peak in Darien; and the adventure hadn't hurt him a hit. Indeed, the skill with which Cuhvin had contrived to stimulate his curiosities without robbing them of their young bloom of awe seemed to me a suffi- cient answer to Murchard s ogreish meta- phor. There was nothing hectic in Fren- ham s efflorescence, and his old friend had not laid even a finger-tip on the sacred stupidities. One wanted no better proof of that than the fact that Frenham still reverenced them in Cuhvin.  There s a side of him you fellows don t see.   believe that story about the duel   he declared; and it was of the very essence of this belief that it should impel him just as our little party was dispersing to turn back to our host with the absurd demand:  And now you ve got to tell us about your ghost " The outer door had closed on Murchard and the others; only Frenham and 1 remained; and the vigilant servant who presided over Culwin s destinies, having brought a fresh supply of soda water, had been laconically ordered to bed. Cuhvin s sociability was a night-blooming flower, and wc knew that he expected the nucleus of his group to tighten around him after midnight. But Frcnham sappeal seemed to disconcert him comically, and he rose from the chair in which he had just re- seated himself after his farewells in the hall. "My ghost  Do you suppose I m fool enough to go to the expense of keeping one of my own, when there are so many charm- ing ones in my friends  closets  Take another cigar,  he said, revolving toward me with a laugh. Frenham laughed too, pulling up hisslen- dcr height before the chimney-piece as he turned to face his short bristling friend.  Oh,  he said,  you d never be content to share if you met one you really liked.  Cuhvin had dropped back into his arm- chair, his shock head embedded in its habit- ual hollow, his little eyes glimmering over a fresh cigar.  Liked liked  Good Lord   he growled.   Ah, you have, then    Frenham pounced on him in the same instant, with a side- glance of victory at me; but Cuhvin cowered gnomelike among his cushions, dissem- bling himself in a protective cloud of smoke.   What s the use of denying it   You ve seen everything, so of course you ve seen a ghost   his young friend persisted, talking intrepidly into the cloud.  Or, if you haven t seen one, it s only because you ve seen two   The form of the challenge seemed to strike our host. Tie shot his head out of the mist with a queer tortoise-like motion he sometimes had, and blinked approvingly at Frenham.   Yes,  he suddenly flung at us on a shrill jerk of laughter;  it s only becausc I ve seen two   The words were so unexpected that they dropped down and down into a fathomless silence, while we continued to stare at each other over Culwin s head, and Cuhvin stared at his ghosts. At length Frenham, without speaking, threw himself into the chair on the other side of the hearth, and leaned forward with his listening smile . . . II  On, of course they re not show ghosts  a collector wouldn t think anything of them . . . Don't let me raise your hopes . . . their one merit is their numerical The Eyes 073 strength: the exceptional fact of their being two. But, as against this, I m bound to admit that at any moment 1 could probably have exorcised them both by asking my doctor for a prescription, or my oculist for a pair of spectacles. Only, as I never could make up my mind whether to go to the doctor or the oculist whether I was afflicted by an optical or a digestive delu- sion I left them to pursue their interesting double life, though at times they made mine exceedingly uncomfortable . . .  Yes uncomfortable; and you know how 1 hate to be uncomfortable t Hut it was part of my stupid pride, when the thing began, not to admit that I could be disturbed by the trifling matter of seeing two-  And then I d no reason, really, to sup- pose I was ill. As far as I knew I was simply bored horribly bored. But it was part of my boredom I remember that I was feeling so uncommonly well, and didn t know how on earth to work off my surplus energy. I had come back from a long journey down in South America and Mexico and had settled down for the win- ter near New York, with an old aunt who had known Washington Irving and corre- sponded with N. P. Willis. She lived, not far from Irvington, in a damp Gothic villa, overhung by Norway spruces, and looking exactly like a memorial emblem done in hair. Her personal appearance was in keeping with this image, and her own hair  of which there was little left might have been sacrificed to the manufacture of the emblem.  I had just reached the end of an agi- tated year, with considerable arrears to make up in money and emotion; and theoretically it seemed as though my aunt s mild hospitality would be as beneficial to my nerves as to my purse. But the deuce of it was that as soon as I felt myself safe and sheltered my energy began to revive; and how was I to work it off inside of a memorial emblem  I had, at that time, the agreeable illusion that sustained intel- lectual effort could engage a man s whole activity; and I decided to write a great book I forget about what. My aunt, im- pressed by my plan, gave up to me her Gothic library, filled with classics in black cloth and daguerrotypes of faded celebri- ties; and I sat down at my desk to make myself a place among their number. And to facilitate my task she lent me a cousin to copy my manuscript.  The cousin was a nice girl, and I had an idea that a nice girl was just what I needed to restore my faith in human nature, and principally in myself. She was neither beautiful nor intelligent poor Alice Now- ell  but it interested me to see any wom- an content to be so uninteresting, and 1 wanted to find out the secret of her content. In doing this 1 handled it rather rashly, and put it out of joint oh, just for a moment  There s no fatuity in telling you this, for the poor girl had never seen any one but cousins . . .   Well, I was sorry for what I d done, of course, and confoundedly bothered as to how I should put it straight. She was staying in the house, and one evening, after my aunt had gone to bed, she came down to the library to fetch a book she d mislaid, like any artless heroine on the shelves be- hind us. She was pink-nosed and flustered, and it suddenly occurred to me that her hair, though it was fairly thick and pretty, would look exactly like my aunt s when she grew older. I was glad I had noticed this, for it made it easier for me to do what was right; and when I had found the book she hadn t lost I told her I was leaving for Eu- rope that week.  Europe was terribly far off in those days, and Alice knew at once what I meant. She didn t take it in the least as I d ex- pected it would have been easier if she had. She held her book very tight, and turned away a moment to wind up the lamp on my desk it had a ground glass shade with vine leaves, and glass drops around the edge, I remember. Then she came back, held out her hand, and said:  Good-bye.  And as she said it she looked straight at me and kissed me. I had never felt anything as fresh and shy and brave as her kiss. It was worse than any reproach, and it made me ashamed to de- serve a reproach from her. I said to my- self:  I ll marry her, and when my aunt dies she ll leave us this house, and I ll sit here at the desk and go on with my book; and Alice will sit over there with her em- broidery and look at me as she s looking now. And life will go on like that for any number of years.  The prospect frightened me a little, but at the time it didn t frighten 674 The Eyes me as much as doing anything to hurt her; and ten minutes later she had my seal ring on her finger, and my promise that when I went abroad she should go with me.  You ll wonder why I m enlarging on this familiar incident. It s because the evening on which it took place was the very evening on which I first saw the queer sight I ve spoken of. Being at that time an ardent believer in a necessary sequence between cause and effect I naturally tried tn trace some kind of link between what had just happened to me in my aunt s library, and what was to happen a few hours later on the same night; and so the coincidence between the two events always remained in my mind.  I went up to bed with rather a heavy heart, for I was bowed under the weight of the first good action I had ever consciously committed; and young as I was, 1 saw the gravity of my situation. Don t imagine from this that I had hitherto been an instru- ment of destruction. I had been merely a harmless young man, who had followed his bent and declined all collaboration with Providence. Now I had suddenly under- taken to promote the moral order of the world, and I felt a good deal like the trust- ful spectator who has given his gold watch to the conjurer, and doesn t know in what shape he ll get it back when the trick is over . . . Still, a glow of self-righteousness tem  ered my fears, and I said to myself as I undressed that when I d got used to being good it probably wouldn t make me as nervous as it did at the start. And by the time I was in bed, and had blown out my candle, I felt that I really was getting used to it, and that, as far as I'd got, it was not unlike sinking down into one of my aunt s very softest wool mattresses.  I closed my eyes on this image, and when I opened them it must have been a good deal later, for my room had grown cold, and the night was intensely still. I was waked suddenly by the feeling we all know the feeling that there was some- thing near me that hadn t l een there when I fell asleep. I sat up and strained my eyes into the darkness. The room was pitch black, and at first I saw nothing; but grad- ually a vague glimmer at the foot of the bed turned into two eyes staring back at me. I couldn t sec the face attached to them on account of the darkness, I im- agined but as I looked the eyes grew more and more distinct: they gave out a light of their own.  The sensation of being thus gazed at was far from pleasant, and you might sup- jjose that my first impulse would have been to jump out of bed and hurl myself on the invisible figure attached to the eyes. But it wasn t my impulse was simply to lie still ... 1 can t say whether this was due to an immediate sense of the uncanny nature of the apparition to the certainty that if I did jump out of bed I should hurl myself on nothing or merely to the benumbing effect of the eyes themselves. They were the very worst eves I ve ever seen: a man s eyes but what a man  My first thought was that he must be frightfully old. The orbits were sunk, and the thick red-lined lids hung over the eyeballs like blinds of which the cords are broken. One lid drooped a little lower than the other, with the effect of a crooked leer; and between these pulpy folds of flesh, with their scant bristle of lashes, the eyes themselves, small glassy disks with an agate-like rim about the pupils, looked like sca-pebblcs in the grip of a starfish.  But the age of the eyes was not the most unpleasant thing al out them. What turned me sick was their expression of vicious security. I don t know how else to describe the fact that they seemed to belong to a man who had done a lot of harm in his life, but had always kept just inside the danger lines. They were not the eyes of a coward, but of some one much too clever to take risks; and my gorge rose at their look of base astuteness. Yet even that wasn't the worst; for as we continued to scan each other I saw in them a tinge of faint derision, and felt myself to be its object.  At that I was seized by an impulse of rage that jerked me out of bed and pitched me straight on the unseen figure at its foot. But of course there wasn't any figure there, and my fists struck at emptiness. Ashamed and cold, I groped about for a match and lit the candles. The room looked just as usual as I had known it would; and I crawled back to bed, and blew out the lights.  As soon as the room was dark again the eyes reappeared; and I now applied my- self to explaining them on scientific prin- ciples. At first I thought the illusion might The Eyes 675 have been caused by the glow of the last embers in the chimney; but the fire-place was on the other side of my bed, and so placed that the fire could not possibly be reflected in my toilet glass, which was the only mirror in the room. Then it occurred to me that I might have been tricked by the reflection of the embers in some polished bit of wood or metal; and though 1 couldn t discover any object of the sort in my line of vision, I got up again, groped my way to the hearth, and covered what was left of the fire. But as soon as I was back in bed the eyes were back at its foot.  They were an hallucination, then: that was plain. But the fact that they were not due to any external dupery didn't make them a bit pleasanter to sec. For if they were a projection of my inner conscious- ness, what the deuce was the matter with that organ  I had gone deeply enough into the mystery of morbid pathological states to picture the conditions under which an exploring mind might lay itself o  en to such a midnight admonition; but I couldn t fit it to my present case. I had never felt more normal, mentally and physically; and the only unusual fact in my situation that of having assured the happiness of an amiable girl did not seem of a kind to summon unclean spirits about my pillow. But there were the eyes still looking at me . . .  I shut mine, and tried to evoke a vision of Alice Nowell s. They were not remark- able eyes, but they were as wholesome as fresh water, and ii she had had more im- agination or longer lashes their expres- sion might have been interesting. As it was, they did not prove very efficacious, and in a few moments 1 perceived that they had mysteriously changed into the eyes at the foot of the bed. It exasperated me more to feel these glaring at me through my shut lids than to sec them, and I opened my eyes again and looked straight into their hateful stare . . .  And so it went on all night. I can t tell you what that night was, nor how long it lasted. Have you ever lain in bed, hope- lessly wide awake, and tried to keep your eyes shut, knowing that if you opened  em you d see something you dreaded and loathed  It sounds easy , but it s devilish hard. Those eyes hung there and drew me. I had the vcrlige de I abinie, and their red lids were the edge of my abyss. ... I had known nervous hours before: hours when I d felt the wind of danger in my neck; but never this kind of strain. It wasn t that the eyes were so awful; they hadn t the majesty of the powers of darkness. But they had how shall 1 say   a physical ef- fect that was the equivalent of a bad smell: their look left a smear like a snail s. And 1 didn t see what business they had with me, anyhow and I stared and stared, try- ing to find out . . .   1 don t know what effect they were try- ing to produce; but the effect they did pro- duce was that of making me pack my port- manteau and bolt to town early the next morning. I left a note for my aunt, ex- plaining that I was ill and had gone to see my doctor; and as a matter of fact I did feel uncommonly ill the night seemed to have pumped all the blood out of me. But when 1 reached town I didn t go to the doc- tor s. I went to a friend s rooms, and threw myself on a bed, and slept for ten heavenly hours. When I woke it was the middle of the night, and I turned cold at the thought of what might be waiting for me. I sat up. shaking, and stared into the darkness; but there wasn't a break in its blessed surface, and when I saw that the eyes were not there I dropped back into an- other long sleep.   I had left no word for Alice when I lied, because I meant to go back the next morn- ing. But the next morning I was too ex- hausted to stir. .-Vs the day went on the exhaustion increased, instead of wearing off like the lassitude left by an ordinary night of insomnia: the effect of the eyes seemed to be cumulative, and the thought of seeing them again grew intolerable. For two days I struggled with my dread; but on the third evening I pulled myself togeth- er and decided to go back the next morn- ing. I felt a good deal happier as soon as I'd decided, for I knew that my abrupt dis- appearance. and the strangeness of my not writing, must have been very painful to jvoor Alice. That night I went to bed with an easy mind, and fell asleep at once; but in the middle of the night I woke, and there were the eyes . . .  Well, I simply couldn t face them; and instead of going back to my aunt s I bun- dled a few things into a trunk and jumped onto the first steamer for England. I was 076 The Kyes so dead tired when I got on board that I crawled straight into my berth, and slept most of the way over; and I can't tell you the bliss it was to wake from those long stretches of dreamless sleep and look fear- lessly into the darkness, knowing that I shouldn t sec the eyes . . .   I stayed abroad for a year, and then I stayed for another; and during that time 1 never had a glimpse of them. That was enough reason for prolonging my stay if I d been on a desert island. Another was, of coursc, that I had perfectly come to see, on the voyage over, the folly, complete impossibility, of my marrying Alice Now- ell. The fact that I had been so slow in making this discovery annoyed me, and made me want to avoid explanations. The bliss of escaping at one stroke from the eyes, and from this other embarrassment, gave mv freedom an extraordinary zest; and the longer 1 savoured it the better I liked its taste.  The eves had burned such a hole in my consciousness that for a long time 1 went on puzzling over the nature of the apparition, and wondering nervously if it would ever come back, but as time passed I lost this dread, and retained only the precision of the image. Then that faded in its turn.  The second year found me settled in Rome, where 1 was planning, 1 believe, to write another great book a definitive work on Etruscan influences in Italian art. At any rate, I d found some pretext of the kind for taking a sunny apartment in the Piazza di Spagna and dabbling about in- definitely in the Forum; and there, one morning, a charming youth came to me. As he stood there in the warm light, slender and smooth and hyacinthine, he might have stepped from a ruined altar one to Antinous, say but he d come instead from New York, with a letter  of all people  from Alice Nowell. The letter the first I d had from her since our break was simply a line introducing her young cousin, Gilbert Noyes, and appealing to me to be- friend him. It appeared, poor lad, that he  had talent,  and  wanted to write ; and, an obdurate family having insisted that his calligraphy should take the form of double entry, Alice had intervened to win him six months  respite, during which he was to travel on a meagre pittance, and somehow prove his ultimate ability to in- crease it by his pen. The quaint condi- tions of the test struck me first: it seemed about as conclusive as a mediaeval  ordeal.  Then I was touched by her having sent him to me. 1 had always wanted to do her some service, to justify myself in my own eyes rather than hers; and here was a beau- tiful embodiment of my chance.  Well, I imagine it s safe to lay down ihe general principle that predestined geniuses don t, as a rule, appear before one in the spring sunshine of the Forum looking like one of its banished gods. At any rate, poor Noyes wasn t a predestined genius. But he ii'ris beautiful to see, and charming as a comrade too. It was only when he began to talk literature that my heart failed me. I knew all the symptoms so well the things he had  in him,  and the things out- side him that impinged  There s the real test, after all. It was always punctually, inevitably, with the inexorableness of a mechanical law it was always the wrong thing that struck him. I grew to find a certain grim fascination in deciding in ad- vance exactly which wrong thing he d select; and I acquired an astonishing skill at the game . . .  The worst of it was that his belise wasn t of the too obvious sort. Ladies who met him at picnics thought him intellectual; and even at dinners he passed for clever. I, who had him under the microscopc, fan- cied now and then that he might develop some kind of a slim talent, something that he could make  do  and be happy on; and wasn t that, after all, what I was concerned with   He was so charming he continued to be so charming that he called forth all my charity in support of this argument; and for the first few months I really be- lieved there was a chance for him . . .  Those months were delightful. Noyes was constantly with me, and the more I saw of him the better 1 liked him. His stupidity was a natural grace it was as beautiful, really, as bis eye-lashes. And he was so gay, so affectionate, and so happy with me, that telling him the truth would have been about as pleasant as slitting the throat of some artless animal. At first I used to wonder what had put into that radiant head the detestable delusion that it held a brain. Then I lx:gan to see that it was simply protective mimicry an in- stinctive ruse to get away from family life The Eyes 077 and an office desk. Not that Gilbert did- n t dear lad  believe in himself. There wasn t a trace of hypocrisy in his composi- tion. He was sure that his  call   was irre- sistible, while to me it was the saving grace of his situation that it uusn't, and that a little money, a little leisure, a little pleasure would have turned him into an inoffensive idler. Unluckily, however, there was no hope of money, and with the grim alterna- tive of the office desk before him he couldn t postpone his attempt at literature. The stuff he turned out was deplorable, and I see now that I knew it from the first. Still, the absurdity of deciding a man's whole future on a first trial seemed to justify me in withholding my verdict, and perhaps even in encouraging him a little, on the ground that the human plant generally needs warmth to flower.  At any rate, I proceeded on that prin- ciple, and carried it to the point of getting his term of probation extended. When 1 left Rome he went with me, and we idled away a delicious summer between Capri and Venice. I said to myself:  If he has anything in him, it will come out now; and it did. He was never more enchanting and enchanted. There were moments of our pilgrimage when beauty born of murmuring sound seemed actually to pass into his face  but only to issue forth in a shallow flood of the palest ink . . .  Well the time came to turn off the tap; and I knew there was no hand but mine to do it. We were back in Rome, and I had taken him to stay with me, not wanting him to he alone in his dismal pension when he had to face the necessity of renouncing his ambition. I hadn t, of course, relied solely on my own judgment in deciding to advise him to drop literature. I had sent his stuff to various people editors and critics  and they had always sent it back with the same chilling lack of comment. Re- ally there was nothing on earth to say about it-  I confess I never felt more shabbily than I did on the day when I decided to have it out with Gilbert. It was well enough to tell myself that it was my duty to knock the poor boy s hopes into splinters  but I d like to know what act of gratuitous cruelty hasn t been justified on that plea  I ve always shrunk from usurping the func- tions of Providence, and when I have to exercise them I decidedly prefer that it shouldn t be on an errand of destruction. Besides, in the last issue, who was I to de- cide, even after a year s trial, if poor Gil- bert had it in him or not    The more I looked at the part I d re- solved to play, the less I liked it; and I liked it still less when Gilbert sat opposite me, with his head thrown back in the lamp- light, just as Phil s is now . . . I d been going over his last manuscript, and he knew it, and he knew that his future hung on my verdict we d tacitly agreed to that. The manuscript lav between us, on my table  a novel, his first novel, if you please  and he reached over and laid his hand on it, and looked up at me with all his life in the look.  I stood up and cleared my throat, try- ing to keep my eyes away from his face and on the manuscript.   The fact is, my dear Gilbert,  I be- gan-   I saw him turn pale, but he was up and facing me in an instant.   Oh, look here, don't take on so, my dear fellow  I  m not so awfully cut up as all that   His hands were on myshoulders, and he was laughing down on me from his full height, with a kind of mortally-stricken gaiety that drove the knife into my side.  He was too beautifully brave for me to keep up any humbug al out my duty. And it came over me suddenly how I should hurt others in hurting him: myself lirst, since sending him home meant losing him; but more particularly poor Alice Nowell, to whom I had so uneasily longed to prove my good faith and my immense desire to serve her. It really seemed like failing her twice to fail Gilbert-----  But my intuition was like one of those lightning flashes that encircle the whole horizon, and in the same instant 1 saw what I might be letting myself in for if I didn t tell the truth. 1 said to myself:  I shall have him for life  and I d never yet seen any one, man or woman, whom 1 was quite sure of wanting on those terms. Well, this impulse of egotism decided me. I was ashamed of it, and to get away from it I took a leap that landed me straight in Gil- bert s arms.   The thing s all right, and you re all wrong   I shouted up at him; and as he hugged me, and I laughed and shook in his incredulous clutch, 1 had for a minute G78 The the sense of self-complacency that is sup- posed to attend the footsteps of the just. Hang it all, making people happy luis its charms-  Gilbert, of course, was for celebrating his emancipation in some spectacular man- ner; but 1 sent him away alone to explode his emotions, and went to lied lo sleep off mine. As I undressed I began to wonder what their after-taste would be so many of the finest don t keep  Still, 1 wasn't sorry, and 1 meant to empty the bottle, even if it did turn a tritie flat.  After I got into bed I lay for a long time smiling at the memory of his eyes his blissful eyes. . . Then I fell asleep, and when I woke the room was deathly cold, and I sat up with a jerk and there were the oilier eyes . . .  It was three years since I d seen them, but I d thought of them so often that I fancied they could never take me unawares again. Now, with their red sneer on me, I knew that I had never really believed they would come back, and that I was as de- fenceless as ever against them ... As before, it was the insane irrelevance of their coming that made it so horrible. What the deuce were they after, to leap out at me at such a time   I had lived more or less care- lessly in the years since I d seen them, though my worst indiscretions were not dark enough to invite the searchings of their infernal glare; but at this particular moment I was really in what might have been called a state of grace; and I can t tell you how the fact added to their horror . . .   But it's not enough to say they were as bad as before: they were worse. Worse by just so much as I d learned of life in the interval; bv all the damnable implications my wider experience read into them. I saw now what I hadn t seen before: that they were eyes which had grown hideous gradually, which had built up their base- ness coral-wise, bit by bit, out of a series of small turpitudes slowly accumulated through the industrious years. Yes it came to me that what made them so bad was that they d grown bad so slowly . . .  There they hung in the darkness, their swollen lids dropped across the little watery bulbs rolling loose in the orbits, and the puff of fat tlesh making a muddy shadow underneath and as their filmv stare moved with my movements, there came over me Eyes a sense of their tacit complicity, of a deep hidden understanding between us that was worse than the first shock of their strangeness. Not that I understood them; but that they made it so clear that some day I should .  . . Yes, that was the worst part of it, decidedly; and it was the feeling that became stronger each time they came back to me . . .   For they got into the damnable habit of coming back. They reminded me of vam- pires with a taste for young flesh, they seemed so to gloat over the taste of a good conscience. Every night for a month they came lo claim their morsel of mine: since I d made Gilbert happy they simply wouldn t loosen their fangs. The coinci- dence almost made me hate him, poor lad, fortuitous as I felt it to be. I puzzled over it a good deal, but couldn t find any hint of an explanation except in the chance of his association with Alice Nowell. But then the eyes had let up on me the moment I had abandoned her, so they could hardly lie the emissaries of a woman scorned, even if one could have pictured poor Alice charging such spirits to avenge her. That set me thinking, and 1 began to wonder if they would let up on me if I abandoned Gilbert. The temptation was insidious, and 1 had to stiffen myself against it; but really, dear boy  he was too charming to be sacrificed to such demons. And so, after all, I never found out what they wanted . . Ill Tite fire crumbled, sending up a flash which threw into relief the narrator s gnarled red face under its grey-black stubble. Pressed into the hollow of the dark leather armchair, it stood out an in- stant like an intaglio of yellowish red- veined stone, with spots of enamel for the eyes; then the fire sank and in the shaded lamp-light it became once more a dim Rem- brandtish blur. Phil Frenham, sitting in a low chair on the opposite side of the hearth, one long arm propped on the table behind him, one hand supporting his thrown-back head, and his eves steadily fixed on his old friend s face, had not moved since the talc began. He continued to maintain his silent immo- bility after Cuhvin had ceased to speak, and it was I who, with a vague sense of dis- The Eyes 079 appointment at the sudden drop of the story, finally asked:   Hut how long did you keep on seeing them   Culwin, so sunk into his chair that he seemed like a heap of his own empty clothes, stirred a little, as if in surprise at my question. He appeared to have half- forgotten what he had been telling us.  How long  Oh, off and on all that winter. It was infernal. I never got used to them. I grew really ill.  I'renham shifted his attitude silently, and as he did so his elbow struck against a small mirror in a bronze frame standing on the table behind him. He turned and changed its angle slightly; then he resumed his former attitude, his dark head thrown back on his lifted palm, his eyes intent on Cuhvin s face. Something in his stare em- barrassed me, and as if to divert attention from it I pressed on with another question:  And you never tried sacrificing Noyes      Oh, no. The fact is I didn't have to. He did it for me, poor infatuated boy     Did it for you   llow do you mean      He wore me out wore everybody out. He kept on pouring out his lamentable twaddle, and hawking it up and down the place till he became a thing of terror. I tried to wean him from writing oh, ever so gently, you understand, by throwing him with agreeable people, giving him a chance to make himself felt, to come to a sense of what he really had to give. I d foreseen this solution from the beginning felt sure that, once the first ardour of authorship was quenched, he d drop into his place as a charming parasitic thing, the kind of chronic Cherubino for whom, in old societies, there s always a seat at table, and a shelter behind the ladies  skirts. I saw him take his place as  the poet : the poet who doesn't write. One knows the type in every drawing-room. Living in that way doesn t cost much- I d worked it all out in my mind, and felt sure that, with a little help, he could manage it for the next few years; and meanwhile he d be sure to marry. I saw him married to a widow, rather older, with a good cook and a well-run house. And 1 actually had my eye on the widow . . . Meanwhile I did everything to facilitate the transition lent him money to ease his conscience, intro- duced him to pretty women to make him forget his vows. But nothing would do him: he bad but one idea in his beautiful obstinate head. He wanted the laurel and not the rose, and he kept on repeating Gautier s axiom, and battering and filing at his limp prose till he d spread it out over Lord knows how many thousand sloppy pages. Now and then he would send a pailful to a publisher, and of course it would always come back.  At first it didn t matter he thought he was  misunderstood.' He took the atti- tudes of genius, and whenever an opus came home he wrote another to keep it Company. Then he had a reaction of de- spair. and accused me of deceiving him, and Lord knows what. I got angry at that, and told him it was he who had deceived him- self. He d come to me determined to write, and I d done my best to help him. That was the extent of my offence, and I d done it for his cousin s sake, not his.  That seemed to strike home, and he didn t answer for a minute. Then he said:   My time s up and my money s up. What do you think I d better do     I think you d better not be an ass,  I said.  He turned red, and asked:  What do you mean by being an ass       I took a letter from my desk and held it out to him.  T mean refusing this offer of Mrs. El- linger s: to be her secretary at a salary of five thousand dollars. There may lie a lot more in it than that.   He flung out his hand with a violence that struck the letter from mine.  Oh, I know well enough what s in it   he said, scarlet to the roots of his hair.    And what s your answer, if you know     I asked.  He made none at the minute, but turned away slowly to the door. There, with his hand on the threshold, he Stopped to ask, almost under his breath:  Then you really think my stuff s no good    I was tired and exasjierated, and I laughed. I don t defend my laugh it was in wretched taste. But I must plead in ex- tenuation that the boy was a fool, and that Fd done my best for him I really had.  He went out of the room, shutting the door quietly after him. That afternoon I left for Frascati, where I d promised to sj end the Sunday with some friends. 1 was glad to escape from Gilbert, and by the same token, as 1 learned that night, I had m 6S0 The also cscapcd from the eyes. I dropped into the same lethargic sleep that had come to me before when their visitations ceased; and when I woke the next morning, in my peaceful painted room above the ilexes, I felt the utter weariness and deep relief that always followed on that repairing slumber. I put in two blessed nights at Frascati, and when I got back to my rooms in Rome I found that Gilbert had gone . . . Oh, nothing tragic had happened the episode never rose to  hat. He d simply packed his manuscripts and left for America for his family and the Wall Street desk. He left a decent little note to tell me of his decision, and behaved altogether, in the circum- stances, as little like a fool as it s possible for a fool to behave ...  IV Culwin paused again, and again Fren- ham sat motionless, the dusky contour of his young head reflected in the mirror at his back.  And what became of Noyes after- ward    I finally asked, still disquieted by a sense of incompleteness, by the need of some connecting thread between the paral- lel lines of the tale. Culwin twitched his shoulders.  Oh, nothing became of him because he became nothing. There could Ik  no question of  becoming  about it. He vegetated in an office, I believe, and finally got a clerkship in a consulate, and married drearily in China. I saw him once in Hong Kong, years afterward. He was fat and hadn t shaved. I was told he drank. He didn t recognize me.   And the eyes   I asked, after another pause which Frenham s continued silence made oppressive. Culwin, stroking his chin, blinked at me meditatively through the shadows.   I nev- er saw them after my last talk with Gilbert. Put two and two together if you can. For my part, I haven t found the link.  He rose  stiffly, his hands in his pockets, and walked over to the table on which re- viving drinks had been set out.   You must be parched after this dry talc. Here, help yourself, my dear fellow. Here, Phil   lie turned back to the hearth. Eyes Frenham still sat in his low chair, making no response to his host s hospitable sum- mons. But as Culwin advanced toward him, their eyes met in a long look; after which, to my intense surprise, the young man, turning suddenly in his seat, flung his arms across the table, and dropped his face upon them. Culwin, at the unexpected gesture, stopped short, a flush on his face.  Phil what the deuce  Why, have the eyes seared you  My dear boy my dear fellow I never had such a tribute to my literary ability, never   He broke into a chuckle at the thought, and halted on the hearth-rug, his hands still in his pockets, gazing down in honest per- plexity at the youth s bowed head. Then, as Frenham still made no answer, he moved a step or two nearer.  Cheer up, my dear Phil  It s years since I ve seen them apparently I ve done nothing lately bad enough to call them out of chaos. Unless my present evocation of them has made you see them; which would be their worst stroke yet   His bantering appeal quivered off into an uneasy laugh, and he moved still nearer, bending over Frenham, and laying his gouty hands on the lad s shoulders.  Phil, my dear boy, really what s the matter  Why don t you answer  Have you seen the eyes   Frenham s face was still pressed against his arms, and from where I stood behind Culwin I saw the latter, as if under the re- buff of this unaccountable altitude, draw back slowly from his friend. As he did so, the light of the lamp on the table fell full ol. bis perplexed congested face, and I caught its sudden reflection in the mirror behind Frenham s head. Culwin saw the reflection also. He paused, his face level with the mirror, as if scarcely recognizing the countenance in it as his own. But as he looked his ex- pression gradually changed, and for an ap- preciable space of time he and the image in the glass confronted each other with a glare of slowly gathering hate. Then Culwin let goof Frenham s shoulders, and drew back a step, covering his eyes with his hands . . . Frenham, his face still hidden, did not stir.

If the real business of living was not a simple matter for a generation that had few alternatives and many necessities, it must he complicated indeed for a generation which has the time and money to live com- paratively at its ease. Except for the poor, making the acquaintance of the three R s i-i no longer romantic. The three R s are everywhere. Boys no longer need tramp hundreds of miles to find ordinary instruc- tion as they used sometimes to come tramp- ing up to the New England schools clear from the Mississippi Valley. The little red school-house has followed the railroad and even the  Fresno  scraper. A boom town scarcely springs up in the Western sage- brush which hasn t a high-school almost as soon as it has a hotel and a bank. As a place for final instruction, the need for the old-fashioned  academy  has long since passed away. Going to college, meanw hile, has become with an astonishingly varied class of boys, lips's brother, John, Cornwallis had not yet almost a matter of course. A vast and surrendered.

These latter words arc written. I suppose, above the gateway of every preparatory school to-day over high-schools in kindly little Western towns, over fashionable  Iro- ton, St. Mark s, and St. Paul s. One can not see them perhaps, but founders and teachers and fond parents, at least, hon- estly believe they arc there. The words are doubtless the same but their meanings must be as varied as American life to-day is varied. When Andover was founded Washing- ton s army was still at Valiev Forge.

And you have but to glance casually at this multitude all American citizens of to-morrow to see lhat it stretches between widely separated extremes. On the one hand is the high-school in the typical American town the comfortable little Middle-Western city, for instance, where none is very rich nor very poor. A boy lives with his father and mother and brothers aixl sisters at home. He learns   a il   three parts, and the square of a b, and also, probably, how to take i are of a furnace and shovel snow. All the varied human relation- ships of a home and a town still fairly homogeneous, and scarcely aware of such words as  tradesman  or  serving class,  gradually shape and color hi-' mind and character. The Swedish carpenter's son beats him in geometry; the washer-wom an s d a tighter knows more than he of By- ron and Shakespeare. His own wit is leaden beside the repartee of the expressman, and he knows the grocerv- nun very well because the groceryman, who used to go to school with hi  father, re- gards him affectionately as a sort of nephew, and always ask- him if he won t have a 6N2 ride when he happens to drive by. All the kindly humanity of the place steeps into him far more, probably, than he realizes at the time. He can't quite escape observing that there is illness and failure in the world as well as foot-ball heroes and banjo clubs, and hi  own enthusiasms are set against a saving background of men with lines in their faces who have t   hustle to pay rent and coal bills. He is part, in short, of a commonwealth in- stead of a cull; a school-boy instead of a College  man  in miniature. and litlle at Andover, the There   not so much n stake uikS the wIh.U: mi   Also, probably, he is indifferently taught, crude in manners and clothes, and although he may go down to college with a general knowledge of human nature, and an in- stinctive democracy which his more spe- cially prepared classmates may not acquire until years after they have left college, he goes awkwardly, like a tourist suddenly stepping into Paris or Timbuctoo. At the other extreme is the fashionable preparatory school, cloistered away in some peculiarly agreeable and beautiful comer of the country. The little boy of twelve is taken here before he has begun, so to speak, to wake up. He may even have begun earlier and  prepared" for the pre- paratory. Surrounded by other little I toys exactly like himself, he is shut away from the re-I of the world for six impressionable years. He is taught charming manners, kept from the hurly-burly of the public school, and from temptation in so far as te nptation resides in outside things, He is traineil almost as rigorously for a special role as if he were the son of an acro- bat following his father s trade, or some rich little city girl preparing to  come out.  If he i nTt in the class room, he is hard at it 011 the foot ball or base-ball field, or track or river. There arc no loose ends or waste. Every  moment is filled with carefully planned work or play, and watched over by older men men who have travelled, alumni of the college for which he is pre- paring, perhaps, who have played on the the c   nc pmhc sensible a d uaiuul teams and belonged to the clubs he hopes to play on anil belong to. Naturally he develops rapidly, and as this development is all along the line of making him a  gentleman  and a success in college, his comparative progress is as- tonishing. He learns loyalty to an ideal  his school, anil what it stands for when the public school-boy still considers teachers his natural enemies. He makes many de- lightful and valuable friends. He puts on a black coat and pumps each evening,  rt- haps, learns to play cricket or fives, always uses the  Sir" when addressing a master  acquires as a matter of course a thousand little agreeable graces. There is nothing  fresh  about these little gentlemen when they enter college. They come down to Cambridge or New Haven you can tell them at a glance as serenely almost as they might go to visit an uncle or a grown- up brother. How far this preparation for college life is a preparation for ordinary life is, of course, another and more difficult story. If the mould into which they are run some- times hardens around them, it is not sur- prising. for that was a charming place, there in the country, where all were light- hearted and polite and healthy and nice, and our ordinary world doubtless often seems badly arranged and rather tire- somely difficult. Were these two alternatives equally prac- ticable much might be said for either the 6Sj The I'foment House at Andover n o   Id   4oiii.il lim c ifc utM of those ti c l by boy  wbo are oo ki  fj t  e i wiy through the   bcol  loose" home and high-school training: the special preparation of the "tighter  board- ing-school life. But of course there is rarely so simple an alternative. The mere co t of hoard and tuition nearly a thou- sand dollar  a year in the more exclusive schools practically eliminates, for them at Th  Oilman II .u%e at Kxetcr T    u l   f ike fiiic old New l-  tftiitt houses clutwi tctiMfcc ol both E least, all hut the sons of the fairly well-to- do. And the rich little hoy rarely has the choice between a fashionable school and the broad humanizing experience in a small town. His parents may have three houses and no home, or prefer to travel, or get divorced. And the choice is more likely to be between being really trained in a boarding-school or spoiled at home by private tutors. And even the robus- tious democracy of a Walt Whitman might balk, for rea- sons of health alone, at forc- ing a l iov to grow up in a city like New York. Moreover,  going to col- lege  is coming to mean at least two rather different things. In the West the co- educational State university, aiming at  results," is the last stage of a system of edu- cation which has much in it ..mi Aodnn. to appeal to a democracy a system, that is. which is an organic part of the State, which keeps as close at possible to what seem practical needs, and through which the future citizens, boys and girls alike, march together side by side until they emerge prepared to establish homes and serve the State which trained them. Those who prefer the older universities, however and it isn t apparent that the suc- cess of Wisconsin, for in- stance, has lessened the de- sire for Harvard, Princeton, or Yale find it increasingly difficult to enter there with- out special preparation. In the West, if not everywhere, the high-schools tend to be come more and more voca- tional, to prepare their pupils for self-support rather than fora more extended quaffing of the Pierian spring. And excepting those who hold to the public school experience for such reasons as I have suggested, there are enough who prefer the old-fashioned training of the Kastem universities, apparently, to demand private preparatory schools, and more of them, for some time to come.

They were started in the heart of Puritan Xew Fngland, in the midst of the War for Independence, and f  r over a cen- tury they have kept alive the sacred fire with which the young nation was burning at their birth. No other schools have helped in the making of so many distinguished men, nnr are any, perhaps, so saturated with traditions so peculiarly American. In their early days, when most of the buys were working their way as they went, rais- ing vegetables to help pay their board, bundling up as if for a sleigh ride 011 Sun- days to listen to three sermons in an un- heated church, and on Monday reciting what they could remember of the discourses of the day before; in the day of Master Eliphalet Pearson  . .

Of late years, as the type of boys has changed with the c hanging times, it has been found advisable more and more to gather them esjiecially the young- er ones in dormitories controlled by the schools. Kventually, 1 supjiose. they will be all lodged in school buildings. The newer dormitories, like Dunbar Hall at Exeter and Bancroft Cottage at Andover, are quite as tine as any buildings at the more fash- ionable schools, and discipline in them is much the same, but many of the sedate old colonial houses, with their broad while faces and green blinds, are still used as Ixmrding-places, ami the practice of en- couraging a strong sense of personal re- sponsibility still survives. As the Andover catalogue says: "The Academy aims to attract students with a definite educa- tional purpose and a high moral stand- ard. The Academy is not a suitable school for boys who are idle, insubordinate, or lacking in self-control; or for such as re- quire the constant supervision of a teacher and the routine of the school-rooin in or- der to enforce industry and fidelity.

And nearly a fifth ol those who register are sometimes dropped before the end of the year. This does not mean dismissal necessarily; it may mean merely that for one reason or another they can not keep the pace. A 1x v is asked, so to speak, not how long he has studied, but does he know his lesson:  Make good or get out,  as one might paraphrase the motto of one of Eng- land s famous schools. It is a wasteful method, from the point of view of the more paternal schools, but those who survive are likely to be pretty tit. As boys may enter any of the four classes, both Andover ami Exeter are much used by those who can take only a year or two of special preparation. And as there is no age limit a few years ago a bricklayer em- ployed on one of the Andover buildings, and recently supervising mechanical engineer of one of the tallest buildings in New York, laid down his trowel and joined the school  the boys are likely to be older than in the more restricted schools. Their age, their numbers there are nearly five hundred  and their comparative absence of restric- tion give to both Andover and Exeter much of the atmosphere of small college towns  an atmosphere robust and bracing; per- haps, for tenderly nurtured boys, too little restricted, too much as freshman year at college might be without the steadying in- fluence of upper classmen. There are sons of millionaires at Andover and Exeter, and side by side with them mill boys from the near-by towns and big-fisted youths from the Pennsylvania mines. Sixty or seventy at each school are helped by scholarships, and it is no disgrace what- ever to pay for one s l oard by waiting on table. Many people are opposed to such supposedly menial tasks, but I think that if they could see these boys rush in to the Commons together from their noon recita- tions, and see those who are working throw off coats, shoot into duck jackets and begin to  rustle  food, sometimes picking up the talk where they left it, and with no more self-consciousness than you would pass the sandwiches at a summer picnic, they might feel differently. There is something in the air of those two old New England towns 687 688 Sonic American Preparatory Schools which makes such things possible, and ii is a fine and impressive thing in this day and age that it should he so. This atmosphere of old-fashioned Amer- icanism that all the schools considered here have a more or less similar scholastic and athletic equipment is assumed as a matter of course is an especially impor- tant influence of Andover and Exeter. I do not refer to mere democratic rawness, but to that air of earnestness, sincerity, and Society when there was none, an Education Society when there was none. She in- vented i he first religious newspaper, and has sown her Greek lire and her Hebrew lire on this Continent all the way to the Pacific seas.  The theological seminary is no more, but the boys live in its dormitories and use its chapel each morning and on Sundays. And it was on one of their frosty November Sunday mornings that I went to church 0 mn  ceinent day exert'ut the Hill Scliuo . independence, dignity without  jose or af fectation, which fairly seems to radiate from these fine old white houses and an- cient elms. One feels this especially. 1 think, at An- dover, the Andover of which that fiery old divine, the Rev. Joseph Cook of Boston, once said after Dr. Holmes had smiled at the rectilinear nature of New Englanders.   She may have lacked imagination, but she lifted up her thoughts to the Chinese junks, to the pagans of Burmah, to the isles of the South Seas, to the Indian Empire, and when there was no missionary society she invented one. Andover may have lacked imagination, but she imagined a Tract So- ciety when there was none, a Temperance there with them. Outside the air was crys- tal clear, the elms stood gray and bare in its clearness, and Broadway seemed very far away. Across the street was the home of Harriet Beecher Stowe, and a few doors away the house in which  America  was written. And for a boy born in New Vork or the West it must have meant a good deal to stand up in that place and sing as those five hundred husky young Americans sang to the tune of  Elton,  Whittier s hvmn: near I.ord and l aihcr of Mankind forgive our feverish ways Rccluthe u  in our rightful mind In piirvr lives our service find In de   R-r reverence, praise.

And let our ordered lives confess The Ijeauiy of thy peace. Life isn't   ulishcd at either of these schools, but one can not help feeling that there is something very valuable here for young Americans destined to spend their lives afterward amongst automobiles and stock exchanges and the rush and glitter of our day. Something is preserved here which still lives in the Harvard Yard and which to-day s undergraduates will scarcely find in the weathered oak and swimming pools of Harvard s  Gold Coast.  Although Andover and Exeter are sub- stantially alike, there arc various lit tie dif- ferences apparent enough to those familiar with the schools. Goings and comings are a trifle more carefully watched at Andover and the boys incline to go to Yale. Exeter men incline to go to Harvard, and they like to think that they are even more democratic than Andover. Carelessness in clothes not an impor- tant symptom of democracy to be sure is almost a fad at Exeter. Flannel shirts arc- common, and sweaters, although not   er- mitted by most instructors, are worn to class sometimes. The typical Exeter cos- tume seemed to include, when 1 was there, a negligee shirt with the collar turned up so as somewhat to resemble the collars Mr. Gladstone used to wear. Exeter has more scholarships about fifteen thousand dollars a year is available  and the scholarship boys are, in a way, the backbone of the school. They are com- pelled to stand well in their studies and, as they are often the school s best athletes, they almost succeed in making bard study and high marks fashionable. They seemed amused at Exeter at a recent visitor who, in addressing the I joys. had good-naturedly as- sumed that they preferred  " marks to A's or B's. And there were many stories here, as at Andover, of boys who had worked their way through and made a great success afterward in college or business. Recently the rich father of a boy had suddenly lost his money. A wealthy uncle offered to pay the boy s expenses, but he would have none of it. He opened a dothes-pressing shop in his room, the other boys loyally sent him their clothes, and he was able to carry him- self through without help. Stories of this sort are characteristic of Kxeter. It is part of the school s tra- dition, stoutly preserved no matter how W 9 coo Some American Preparatory Schools many rich lx ys may conic. Mr. Tufts, whose kindly scholarship has been initi- ating barbarous young I'.xonians into the beauties of the English classics for more than a quarter of a century, con- ducted chapel exercises the morning 1 was there, and he asked one of the boys to see him after the service was over. The boy had a library book long overdue, and i happened to be stand- ing near enough to hear him mumble, with a grin, that he hadn't had any money to pay the fine.   There s a wood-pile in my back- yard." said the old gentleman drvly. It was the sort of reply which would Ik.- cherished at Exeter whether or not there was any likelihood of the boy sawing wood. These morning exercises, which are held in an assembly room instead of a separate chapel, begin at a quarter to eight, an engagement somewhat diffi- cult for an uninitiated city man to meet in the cold dawn of a New England winter. I hurried in with the boys, un- noticed. just as the room was quieting down. The opening hymn had scarcely lteen given out when the room suddenly broke into loud applause. I asked the lx y nearest me what they were clap- ping about.   You, I guess,  he smiled. And the same embarrassing salute, giv- en with the same matter-of-fact air, fol- lowed us from the doorway each lime we marched to our table in Alumni Hall. A custom similarly quaint is the fin- ger snapping in class. There is more or less of this in every high-school, of course, but these athletic youths have at- tained an astonishing proficiency. Un- less the victim answers the question immediately and it must take rare presence of mind to keep one s head  the room is alive with arms, hurled at the instructor and quickly snapped back, and a racket like so many fire- crackers. At St. Mark s this has been refined into an excited  Oh, sir  Oh, sir  Oh, sir    and at most schools it would make the master s blood run cold, but it was from just such lx ys as these doubtless that T.xeter helped to make during the lirst century of her existence   nine college presidents, including three of Some American Preparatory Schools 691 Harvard, fifty-two college professors, two hundred and forty-five teachers, thirty-six authors, five ambassadors, seven cabinet ministers, twenty-eight members of Con- gress, twelve governors of Stales, a long list of Federal and State judges, and such men as Daniel Webster, Lewis Cass, Edward Everett, Jared Sparks, John G. Palfrey, Richard Hildreth, George Bancroft, James Walker, and Francis Bowen.  others might have been picked out Hotch- kiss in Connecticut, Belmont in California, and soon quite as well as these two.

It has l een under Dr. Amen, formerly of Harvard, that Exeter has regained the standing which a period of executive laxness caused her somewhat to lose a generation ago. The principal of Andover is Mr. Al- fred E. Stearns, who combines in an uncom- mon way the old New England traditions with a sense of humor and an enthusiasm for out door sports more typical of our day. The Hill School, at Pottstown, Pennsyl- vania, and the Lawrenceville School, in the pleasant country near Princeton, differ from each other in many ways, and yet they may Ik- grouped here as schools more ex- clusive than Andover or Exeter, and yet not quite as  tight" as the fashionable "church'1 schools of New England. Many names of the parents are rather less likely to be familiar to the newspaj er readers of Boston or New V'ork. Walking on eggs is an absurdly simple pastime compared to making generalizations in such matters as these, but I shall   erhaps not hazard too much by relating the remark of a well- informed Lawrenceville alumnus that the Itovs in his school might be said to represent the  second generation.  It is rather hard to say what that is. but I suppose it might mean that their parents had arrived at the Oriental rug period, although their grand- parents were not accustomed to mahogany and plate. Lawrenceville was founded in its present form by the legatees of the estate of Mr. A flotilla In  o tr c spk.iixn p  iii1 l siiU  K ln  i.

Started in 1810 and continued as a small l oarding-si hool, it was acquired in 1.S7S by these legatees and opcne I in 1881. Several buildings have been added since then, but it was the school's good fortune to start with a lilteral endowment and a definite archi- tectural plan. It has mom for nearly four hundred boys more than twice the num- l er al either Groton or St. Mark s and it equipment includes a golf course, a lav- ish supply of out door fields, and the finest school gymnasium in the country. Lawrenceville's most characteristic feat- ure is its house system. The boys below the upper form occupy separate houses, looked over bv a master and his wife, as- sisted sometimes by an unmarried master. Each of these houses or dormitories is a home unit. The boys cat, sleep, and study there, and there are inter-house contests in athletics. The boys of the upi er form live with two masters in the Upper House, a spacious dormitory presided over by two unmarried masters. They have no pre-   92 scribed study hours, provided they keep up a certain grade in their marks; they can smoke during certain hours in a room ar- ranged for that purpose if they have their parents    ermission, and the seven directors 1 hosen by themselves attend to a consider- able extent to discipline.

Among Lawrenceville s historical exhib- its is the Jigger Shop, a semi-scholastic re- freshment parlor kept by a Jersey philos- opher who has learned the tastes of boys. His place is a sort of museum in which everything from macaroons to golf clubs or writing-paper to ginger-snaps can be ob- tained. One of the masters, as a mark of special courtesy, treated me to a  jigger,  the proprietor being left to choose the one at the moment most in vogue. He filled a tall soda-water glass half full of marshmallows. Over this he poured a thick chocolate syrup. He put ice-cream on top of this, and an inch or two of whipped cream on top of the ice-cream, gave a stir, and the  jigger  was ready. The coun- ter was lined with glass bowls filled with chopped nuts and syrup, breakfast foods, chopped bananas and syrup, chopped or- anges, pineapples, etc., which, mixed in various combinations, arc daily devoured by the young Laurcntians. Although the Jigger Shop is not included in the gymnastic equipment of the school, it strikes one as a fairly adequate lest of Miay  c%lc. e  Mruucll luve Jetfvol to iiiW .it St. I .iul   physical prowess, and one might say of it as James   .

The school s more serious purpose has not. per- hajis.

The Hill School is a family school, like Groton and St. Mark s, and, in a rather special sense, a private school. It has nei- ther endowments nor scholarships, and in its present form, with its two hundred and fifty lx ys, it is a continuation of the school started in 1851 by the Rev. Matthew Meigs, reorganized in 1S76 by Mr. John Meigs,  i' 3 Some American Preparatory Schools his son, and conducted I y him ever since.  Neither the fad of any social set. nor the pel of any religious denomination,  as one of it-s. friends rather bluntly described it to me, as we stood in its sunny quadrangle on the day of the annual game with Hotch- kiss. it is conducted along the same lines of compactness and efficiency as any other modern business enterprise, with the differ - uct to turn out boys prepared thoroughly for college and he has gone about his task with the same executive energy and eye to results that would be used by a capable or- ganizer in other fields. The Hill School masters good-humoredly sigh now and then at the pace they have to keep, and it is a matter of record that Hill boys rarely fail to pass their entrance examinations.

There are the usual out-door athletic fields at Hill, and unusually careful train- ing is given to the athletic teams, but the in-door gymnasium is small. Instead of an expensive gymnasium there is a large out-of-door lloored space, with a roofed dirt track, open t   the air, around it. Here the boys are exercised, in sunlight whenever possible: and it is believed that they get more practical good than they would from an expensive gymnasium. I should savthat this was rather typical of Mr. Meigs s keen interest in results.

Except for the chajiel a gift of the alumni the gymnasium, masters' club, and a few de- tached cottages near by, nearly all the school's life as at St. Mark s is carried on under one roof. And in this familv at- mosphere the head master's wife a lady of strong religious feeling has had an important part.

School as a bride, and she has grown up a pari of that little court yard life. At eleven each morning when the lx ys are nibbling crackers just as they do at Groton the masters drift into her cheerful drawing- room for tea or coffee, and some of her famous cinnamon buns. Here, too, after the game with Hotchkiss, 1 watched the foot ball team, looking absurdly small and boyish in their every day clothes, learning manners and being fed with tea and cakes and tactful praise. And the discussions about their future which these young men have with the head-master s wife in the  sky parlor  are matters of school history. A master s wife in such a school has a wide field for the exercise of her influence. For several very important years she and her husband are switchmen, so to speak, turning all these little human ventures from one track to another. She may not l e able to follow T r. Holmes s advice and begin the education of children with their grand- parents, hut she often can, as I heard Mrs. Meigs herself say, turn the advice about and begin the education of grandchildren. Scarcely less potent is the influence of the athletic instructor, Mr. Sweeney, who was brought to the school from a lithographer s office and, breaking records in a high jump, to Iiecome an unusual power not only over the boys  bodies but also their minds. I suppose there is not a better trained eleven in any of the preparatory schools, and it is said that the plays worked out by Mr. Sweeney and the boys at Hill are some- times used by next season s Vale team. They looked, indeed, like little Vale men in the bud when they came swinging on to the field the day of the Hotchkiss game, in sailor hats and blue and white sweaters, and one wasn't surprised to hear that a majority of them go to Yale. The St. Paul's School lies about two miles from Concord, New Hampshire, in a rolling, rather hilly country, covered with while birches and pines. Its size it has room for nearly four hundred boys and the arrangement of its many buildings make it differ from such small parental schools as St. Mark s and Groton, and vet it falls rather more naturally into a class with them than with Lawrencevillc or Hill. All three are New England  church " schools, all suggest American adaptations of English forms, and the social flavor of the three although St. Paul's is more dif- ferentiated is much the same.

Some American Preparatory Schools 007 memory of  he place which seems to linger most pleasantly in my mind is of the out- door life of the playground and of the country roundabout, with its ponds and woods.  And I think of coursc assuming those things which it has in common with other good schools that the casual visitor, too, carries away some such impression as most characteristic of St. Paul's. It is, indeed, a beautiful country, a school-boy s paradise. The school was built on the banks of an old mill-pond, where the boys canoe in summer and play hockey in winter, and ibere is a larger pond two miles away to which the crews are carried in big stages every spring afternoon. Something like a thousand acres of woodland arc under the school s control, and the boys can even go trapping and chop down trees. Dr. George C. Shattuck, who founded the school in 1856, expressed in his deed of gift his desire for physical and aesthetic educa- tion in the school s constitution a rather startling innovation in those days and Dr. Coit, for many years head-master, hail the boys play cricket for the excellent reason that cricket is so uninteresting to watch that any normal boy would be more likely to play it than to loaf on the side lines. Row- ing and foot-ball have taken the place of cricket now, and the whole school, you might say, plays. For foot-ball, the boys are divided among three clubs, the Isthmian, Delphic, and Old Hundred, and each club has six teams, graded as fairly as possible according to weight and age. The big boys of one club play the big boys of another, and so on down to the midgets of the first form. Eighteen elevens are therefore hard at it during the autumn. A percentage is kept and there are mugs for the winners, and big permanent cups in the library to record the victories of the clubs. Track athletics and hockey are arranged in the same way. The oarsmen are di- vided between the Shattuck and Halcyon clubs, and during the spring there are four eights, two sixes, and three fours. All their contests, except for occasional hock- ey games, are with each other. Under these conditions the overwrought atmos- phere of interscholastic games is escaped, athletics become fun, and s x rt what it should be. Vol. XLVIL 70 St. Paul s grew very fast during Dr. Coil s administration, and the school is rather more cosmopolitan than either Gro- ton or St. Mark's. Many boys come from the West. In a sixth form Latin class of eleven boys, I found five from Pittsburg, and the eleven were to l e scattered to Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Trinity, and the University of Pennsylvania. The founder of Andover would have been peculiarly interested, I imagine, if he could have returned and dined with us in the spacious old English hall of the Upper School at St. Paul s. I do not suppose that he would have noticed how agreeably these young sixth formers were dressed; doubtless all our clothes so tragically im-  K rtant to a school-boy sometimes would seem outlandish to him. But he could not have failed to observe the physical beauty, the general alertness, and winsome charm of these finished little gentlemen. Picked boys they are certainly. If you wanted to fill an eight-oared shell, or start a fashion- able club, or lead a forlorn hope, or show Mr. Phillips the best type of modern young American, I don t suppose you could do better than to pick them here.   It always gives me an emotion,  a lady confided to me as we rode back toward New York. She had been to visit her son, and she referred to the sight of the lx vs marching into the stately English chapel in the morning, two by two, bareheaded, and glowing with health and good spirits. Well, I think it would have given the Hon. Samuel Phillips an emotion too. But he would have l een most impressed, I imagine, to see these boys pore over their papers dinner hour is mail hour in the Upper School from the colleges for which they were preparing. TheCrrwiow, News, Princetonian these they ripped open and ran over with exact- ly the business-like air of stockbrokers running ticker-tape through their fingers. W'ho was picked for the 'varsity lx at, how many were trying for the college daily, who would manage the base-ball team  all the gossip of the college world was their gossip too. Ahead of them was last year's class and the classes before that, pioneers paving the way. To take up the pleasant burden, meet the right people, make the right teams and clubs,  make good,  in short and it called for ability and hard work, too was their  great end and real businessof living.  Some American Preparatory Schools And one could not help thinking, as one watched them, of boys in far-away high- schools who must next fall meet and com- pote in this curious business with these fin- ished little men of the world. Obviously, the former stood no chance, no more than a Cook s tourist on his first visit to London would have of dining with the King. And l eing for the most part well-mannered, sensible American boys, afraid, 3bove all things, of "butting in  and being   fresh,  they would flock by themselves, criticising the others for snobbishness, or sorrowing silently at their own unexplained lack of social success. St. Mark s and Groton, in spite of var- ious differences the St. Mark s boys arc gathered under one roof, for instance, the Groton boys in two houses at opposite sides of a broad lawn may be classcd together very much as were Andover and Exeter. They lie near each other in the pleasant rolling country of Eastern Central Massa- chusetts, St. Mark s at Southboro, and Groton alxmt two miles from the village of the same name. St. Mark s was founded in 1865 by Mr. Joseph Burnett, and Gro- ton was organized nineteen years later by the Rev. Endicott Peabody, its head- master still. The present head master of St. Mark s, the Rev. William Greenough Thayer, is a graduate of Amherst, and a former master at Groton. Both schools are of the small parental type there are about one hundred and twenty-five boys at St. Mark s and about one hundred and fifty at Groton and both are intimately as- sociated with the Episcopal Church. Both of these schools arc  fashionable  in the sense that socially ambitious parents will move mountains to get their sons ad- mitted, and that a list of the lx ys  names reads like a rather carefully expurgated So- cial Register of Boston and New York. Both schools have waiting lists more than filling up their future classes until 1923 bovsen- ter between the ages of twelve and fourteen generally and, roughly speaking, it might be said that a child isn t likely to get into either unless he is registered as soon as he is twrn.  Of course,  as I was gravely informed at Groton,  a Groton man wires to I r. Peabody as soon as his son is born. Others generally think that a letter is quick enough.  When one uses the word   fashionable,  on the other hand, one doesn t imply super- ficiality or lack of earnestness. Many of these boys come from families whose names are familiar to the readers of the newspaper society columns, but the majority of them, also, come from families which are  best  in a truer meaning of the word families which stand for broad culture and solid attainment. Merely as a preparatory school, for instance, Groton has perhaps no su Jcrior in America. When President Hadley of Yale and Mr. Roosevelt send their sons thither, something ljcsidcs mere social glamor is doubtless in their minds. Groton s special quality is due to the per- sonality of its head-master, and the fact that it started with, and because of its small numbers and careful selection has been able to keep, an unusually picked lot of boys. Mr. Peabody is an American with an English school and university training, and an American meeting him for the first time would doubtless take him for an Eng- lishman. He is an all around athlete he used to play with the boys on the school teams until he liccame too heavy for them  and yet a churchman; a scholar and yet a very graceful and sophisticated man of the world. Altogether his is a personality pe- culiarly fitted to win the confidence and lead the type of boy for whom the Groton school was started. The English feel that our college athletes think too much of winning, train and spe- cialize too seriously. To make a business of sport seems scarcely gentlemanly, accord- ing to their tradition thal a gentleman docs a great many things rather well in an off- hand way, but doesn t do any one thing so painfully that you might mistake him for a professional. Such an athlete is thehead-masterhimself, and something of his attitude is absorbed doubtless by the boys. Mr. Pealiody once discovered two of his boys dragging a third about in the mud in order to give his new foot-ball clothes the proper veteran atmos- phere.  Come, come   he said,  that s like a soldier taking off his tunic and shoot- ing it full of holes to get a reputation for bravery.  The night before the game with Hotch- kiss at the Hill School, I heard a master tell- ing of a Hill captain who had once stayed out of the big game because he thought he hadn't been playing as well as the school Some American Preparatory Schools 099 had the right to expect. It was an act which required real moral heroism.  It was more than that,  said the master solemnly, groping for the proper word;  it was a a sort of consecration,  The story was told to illustrate the do-or-die spirit of the Hill boys, and it did so excellently, and it also illustrated what the head-master of Groton, I imagine, would consider the rather morbid seriousness with which al- umni, coaches, and grown-ups generally contrive to invest the sports of school and college boys. Mr. Peabody once came across a big sixth form foot-ball player weeping in the locker room because his team had been   eaten by St. Mark s. There are fashions in these matters, you know, as Mr. Peabody would say, with his whimsical smile, and it was the fashion to weep that year.  It isn t as bad as that,  he suggested.   I can t help it,  blubbered the young giant.  Oh, yes; you can,  said the head-master,  and you will at once.   Yes, sir,  said the boy, and ceased forth- with. In his classes, too, the head-master pre- serves, in the most engaging fashion, a simi- lar attitude of tolerant sujjeriority to, and polite detachment from, over-seriousness and mere strenuosity. I never listened to a more lively and vigorous recitation than that of his little first formers in Latin. They piped out their answers and shifted up and down the benches as the answers happened to lie right or wrong, as if they were playing some delightful game. They were as trim and well-disciplined as so many little soldiers, and yet, ljeUveen the head-master and these neat little fellows in their broad turnover collars, there was al- ways a certain half-whimsical, unpedagog- icai air as of  one gentleman to another.  It was  Right you are   when little Mr. Delancey Beekman III gave the proper ablative, or  Bless my souf  shocking  shocking   when he was wrong;  Good shot   when the boy at the foot of the class guessed right,  but only a shot, wasn t it    lest he be too complacent; and  Steam ahead steam ahead I   when any one hesi- tated too long. I recall a rather Anglicized young master at one of the other schools who was trying, 1 fancy, to hit a similar note, and who did it very badly. The class was reading  Sir Roger de Coverley,  and the instructor wished t   point out that the office of justice of the peace was a less exalted position in America than its equivalent in England.  Of course over they-ah,  he said,  he s a  a a gentleman anrl and all that kind of thing. Whereas he-nh be might be I mean to Stiy our little friend of the coun- try the cobbler, you know, who dispenses justice as he makes his shoes   And with a pleased air he tucked his handkerchief into his cuff. The point he was trying to make was a perfectly gcxxl one, and he might also have explained that the English  public schools  can draw their masters from a class of men of force and a broad culture, which, for such work, has scarcely more than begun to exist here. Every night the hundred boys in the Hundred House  the other sixty boys live in the Brooks House across the lawn , file past Mr. Peabody, shake hands, and say  Good night, sir,  before they go upstairs to bed. Every morning, in the robes of an Episcopal clergyman, he strides into the beautiful Gothic chapel which represents, to quote the careful description of Mr. Oscar Fay Adams, the  Curvilinear half of the Middle Pointed style, often called the Late Decorated, but so far along in the style that its transition to the Third Pointed or Perpendicular is already manifesting it- self  a moment later in a plaid cap he strides out the side door and across to the recitation hall. The prefects, as the mon- itors chosen from the fifth form are called, sit at the head-master s table 3nd talk over with him all the school problems, exactly like the big brothers of a large family, and every evening, after the younger boys arc- tucked away, the other instructors gather in the head-master s study or dining-room for a talk and a bite of supper before they go to bed. A difficulty in a school of this type is that it will become too much like a family, and it was with the hope of getting more differ- entiation that the plan has recently been tried of going outside the waiting list and admitting each year, after an examination, a few boys from the West and South. Even with this break in the walls, however, there is a series of questions framed so in- geniously to reflect the applicants  general culture and previous environment, that there is little danger of the admission of 700 Some American Preparatory Schools any very startling alien influence. As it was explained to me at Groton with ob- vious truth:  Of course wc should like to have the blacksmith's son here, only it wouldn t be kind to the blacksmith. ' A school of this type is a very interesting and significant thing, and it must be taken pretty seriously. The high-schools and even such schools as Andover and Exeter decline to admit, so to speak, that our democracy is any less simple than it was a hundred years ago. Such a school as Gro- ton implies that we have an aristocratic, if not a leisure class, and that there is a place in America for schools performing a func- tion similar to that performed by the famous old  public  schools of England. That there is a demand for such schools their tremendous vogue is sufficient proof, and whatever one may think about them  as about automobiles or steam engines it seems apparent that they are here to stay. There is no question that the English public schools send out year after year an unusually fine and virile type of young men to take up the burden of a ruling class and hold up the pillars of the empire. We have no such traditional ruling class. Our best men generally go into business. They rule, to Ijc sure, through the power of their money, but it is an unconscious, generally, rather than a conscious responsibility. And it may be the mission of such schools as Groton is to teach to our chosen few some proper traditions of responsibility. It is not for this, however, that ambitious parents and boys generally struggle to get into such schools. They are not thinking of duties but of privileges. And the real danger is not that the school is a poor school but that it is such a good one. It is not vulgar snobbishness that weakens democ- racy, but a refined and intelligent scep- ticism. And it is not every son of well- meaning but thoughtless parents who can break through the stamp which such a school sets upon him and get the best afterward out of our boisterous and dis- arranged world. The little Groton boy in his pumps, black coat, and broad white collar is very charm- ing saying  Good night   to Mr. Peabody. He is not quite so charming five or six years later in college as he lets a good part of that vigorous, mixed-up stimulating world sweep by unheeded those who are- big enough to break through their environment are perhaps the finest type of young Ameri- cans outside the doors of his particular fashionable society'. And ho is sometimes not charming at all ten years later when you see him of a late afternoon gloomily lapping up highballs in his New York club  a good deal fatter now, a good deal lazier, and a good deal less interested in every- thing not included in his little circle. It is not fair of course to blame any school fur the dangers of wealth and the common weaknesses of humanity, any more than it is fair to allow another school the credit for giving to the nation the distinguished men whose school-days there were merely part of a long life work. But it is fair and it is im-   ortant to consider the slant which a boy s surroundings are likely to give his natural tendencies.  Of course, .a master said, referring to the almost military regime of work and play,  we don t make poets here but I fancy the poets would be poets anyway.  The important thing isn t the poets they don t make, but the poetry they may help to destroy the poetry of common things, the kindly beauty of our varied American life; the stirring fret and urge, different temperaments and different breeds living and working and playing together. This is the real tragedy of these societies for the prevention of knowing what other Ameri- cans are like. It isn t that the boys aren t carefully chosen, but that they are too carefully chosen. It is precisely because these l ovs are all so nice and good-looking and jjolite, and  the kind they are likely to know after- ward,   that hall the bracing charm and romance of American life, school-bov or grown-up, is losf. It isn t that so few of us can get inside to know them; it is that so few of them ever gel outside to know us. It isn t that America particularly needs this or that one hundred and fifty boys, but that these one hundred and fifty boys rather par- ticularly need America.

They brought her down to London s level her in her white robe out of stainless air: here she was still, as Glyde had made her there, but a woman for men to quarrel over, or a bone for dogs. Her heart surged hot against Wan less: she could not, if she would, forget it least of all in the Fulham Road. She felt spotted in Mrs. Benson's spotless dwelling largely because it was Mrs. Ben- son's, partly because a smell of fried her- rings drifted in daily from the street. She felt herself the chosen of a servant, one for whom a clown held battle; and then she found herself resenting the phrases, grow- 702 ing hot over them.

She was a speck at his feet. He had sent her away once.   I m busy,  he had said, without looking at her; and she had gone away on tiptoe. These things vexed her to remember, and she felt that Mrs. Benson s dwelling could not be hers. Mrs. Benson, too, it must be owned, had an incumbrance, which she kept as far as might be in the lower regions of her house, but which was now and again encountered on the stair: a shambling son, one Joe, mostly in shirt-sleeves, distilling familiarity and beer from every pore. He was a ne er- do-well, whom it was his mother s cross and crown to keep in complete idleness. He cast dreadful looks, as of an equal in snug- ness, a fellow-minion, at the chiselled pro- file of our goddess, and was not long before he tried for a full-faced effect. Sanchia's eyes of clear amaze should have cut him down, but they did not. His  Morning, miss,  was daily reminder of a shared clay. Sanchia made herself inaccessible, and Mrs. Benson agonized. To apologize for her son had been as futile as to make excuses for death ; but she tried it.

Pimlico found her a lodging, at the gates of whose dingy mysteries were parks, Westminster, the sky and the river: eternal things, making for tranquillity. It had been her first impulse, the mo- ment she reached London, to go to her father, with whom alone she had regularly corresponded during her years of exile. There was Vicky Sinclair, to be sure, her sister next in age: oncc in a while came a letter from her. But Vicky was married to a man she knew nothing of, and she found herself shy.

She hated secrets, and couldn't pose as a culprit; so she delayed and de- layed. It was a comfort to her to know that he was at hand across a league of murky air: meantime, she sought about for scope to spread her wings. For a fortnight she drank of the gales of liberty, filled her bosom with beauty, and let art smooth out her brows. She listened to music, looked at pictures, renewed her reader s ticket, and spent whole days brows- ing under the Bloomsbury dome. Climb- ing the heights, she planned out schemes of work, felt her critical faculties renewed, studied men and women, and found her old pleasure in quiet chuckling over their shifts. But she had to chuckle alone, for she never spoke to a soul. For a fortnight or so all went well and then, quite suddenly, with- out any warning, going, as it were, to the fountain for water, she found there was no bottom to her cruse. She went to bed san- guine, she awoke morose. She saw the day with jaundiced eyes, scorned herself, cried  Liver   and took medicine. She was glued to her books all day, returned late to her lodging, and found herself in tears. She discovered a tenderness, a yearning; she lay awake dreaming of her childhood, of her girlhood, of Vicky, of her father s knee, of Senhouse, her dear, preposterous friend, whose gray eves quizzed while they loved her. Golden days with him golden nights when she dreamed over his eager, profuse, interminable letters  All these sweet, seemly things were dead  Ah, no, not that, else she must die. She cried softly, and stretched out her arms in the dark to the gentle ghosts that peopled it. Then, being practical in grain, she jumped up, lit can- dles, and wrote deliberately to each of her sisters finally, after much biting of the pen, to her father. Before her mood could cool, she dressed hastily, slipped out and posted her letters. Coming back to bed, she paused in the act to enter it one knee upon it. Wide-eyed she wondered why she had not written to Senhouse. To him, of all people in the world, first of all  And his answer a certainty. Hot came the reply to her question, and smote her in the face. Never to him again never. There are cer- tain things no woman can bring herself to do. The more she has need of a man the less possible is it to tell him so. She sighed as she got into her bed, but her eyes were very kind. Of the five fair daughters of Thomas Welborc Percival, East India merchant in The Poultry, Philippa, the eldest, the trenchant and clear-sighted, lived in Bryan- ston Square, mother of three children. Her husband, Mr. Tompsett-King, was a solici- tor, but he was much more than that. An elderly, quiet gentleman, who talked in a whisper, and seemed to walk in one too, he presided over more than one learned society and spoke at congresses on non-controver- sial topics. A sound churchman, he de- plored Romish advance on the one hand, and easy divorce on the other. The sal- vation of human society lay, he held, within these limits. Distrust the emotions; sub- mit all things to reason love of God, and love of woman. On these terms he pros- pered, like his father before him. It all seemed very simple to him. The hand- some Philippa respected him, obeyed him particularly, and never differed from him in opinion. But she colored every com- pliance with his decrees with an idiosyn- crasy so marked as to make them seem her own. Where he held that Rome pandered to the emotions, she laughed it to scorn as a forcing-house of spiritual foppery; where he saw in divorce a treason to the law of con- 704 Rest Harrow tract, she said that it tempted women to fall. Is it not easy enough to sin  Must we legalize it   Why put a tax upon marriage   Mr.Tompsett-Kingdeprecated all dottings of iotas; when Philippa stormed at society, lie hummed a sad little tunc. Before he left for Bedford Row he patted her shoulder and said,   Gently does it.  Some such scene must ensue ujx n the Prodigal's letter. Hawise, Lady Pinwell, lived in the coun- try. Her husband was a baronet, and a handsome blond. A pretty, apple-cheeked, round-eyed girl, very much of a kitten, she was now grown plump, sleek, rather slow to move, and many times a mother. She de- ferred to her husband in all things, and by his wish received her parents on a formal visit once a year. She saw very little of her sisters, and as for Sanchia the thing was not to be heard of not even mentioned to Sir George. As, in fact, she burned the child's letter before she left her bedroom, she does not come into the tale at all. But the pensive Mclusine, three years younger than Philippa, seven older than Sanchia, may be reckoned with. She was also married, to a Mr. Gerald Scales, the son of a baronet. He was not, however, to inherit the title, for he had a brother, Sir Matthew, and frequent nephews. But his means were ample for his rank and discreet amusements, and went further and did more for him than prolific Sir Matthew s: for Melusine gave him no sons. His circle of being, in and through which trailed with charming languor his wife, was of more dap- pled sheen and of ampler circumference than that of Bryanston Square. Haring its centre in Kensington Gore, it readied to Ranelagh on one side, to Maidenhead on the other. There was a riverside villa down there, where Mrs. Scales gave parties in the summer-time and was punted about by flushed gentlemen in pink shirts. She was the tallest of the five sisters, and the most graceful; near-sighted enough for lor- gnettes, an elegant young woman. She had an instinct for attitudes, turns of the head, which were useful in tete-a-tete conversa- tions. Mentally, she was not strong, and perhaps her manner was too elaborate: she draped herself when she sat down as if her skirts were window-curtains. Toy Pom- eranians were a hobby of hers, and the early Florentine masters. She could read off the names of the saints in a Sacred Conversa- tion as easily as you or I a row of actresses in a photograph shop. Mrs. Jameson s books were at her fingers  ends. Her mother favored her more than any of her children, and was often at her house on visits. Gerald Scales called her the Dowa- ger, and pleased her vastly. He himself was Tubby to his friends. Vicky, a year older than Sanchia, had married a Captain Sinclair, who was sta- tioned at Aldershot. She had been the romp of former days, and when the storm had burst, hotly on the culprit s side. But Vicky had been flighty, and marriage changes one. Sanchia s eyes grew wistful as she sat, her letters on the wing, and thought of Vicky. Her first response was from Mclusine, in a telegram from Taplow which read   Darling alas    and no more. Her com- ment was shrewd:  Mamma is there   and she was right. Then came her father s letter, to pluck at her heart-strings. Hein- vited her to The Poultry' at   any hour of the day and the sooner the better ; but was clear that she could not visit Great Cumberland Place without writing to mamma.   Doing the civil,  was his jocu- lar way of putting it one of papa s little ways, when he meant more. She knew that he was right, and postponed the fond man and his injunction. His love might be taken for granted by a favorite child. Just now it was her sisters  judgment she craved. Philippa wrote with her accustomed steel. It might have been a bayonet: yet she meant to be kind.  Bryanston Square, Thursday.   My Dear Sanchia: I may as well say at once that I am not surprised to hear from you; in fact, I have been expecting some such letter as yours ever since I read in the Times of Claire Ingram s death. Poor, unhappy woman, it was time. Some of the Picrponts  the Godfrey P. s  are intimate friends of ours: we dined there last week; no party just ourselves and heard all about it. I learn that Mr. Ingram has gone abroad, but imagine that he will be in Lon- don before the end of the season. Have you written to mamma  If not, pray do so. I assure you that it will 1m: taken as it is meant. Nothing but good can comc of it. Of that I am sure. Rest Harrow 705   Now, as to your proposals. I think I will ask you t   come to me here. 1 am very busy, with calls a thousand ways. I really have no afternoons free for as far forward as I can see except Sundays, which I de- vote entirely to Tertius and religion. No woman ought to separate the two love of God, love of husband in God. Sooner or later, all women learn it. Then the morn- ings are naturally occupied with the house and the children. They have Miss Mead- ows; but she is young and absurdly incon- sequent. I don't see how you can expect a girl in her teens to work miracles. In fact, I don t want her to, and am at hand to see that she doesn t.   I have spoken to Tertius, and you must forgive me for saying that we both think, under the circumstances, it would look, and be, better in every way if you came here, in the first instance. Without discussing what is done, and  I pray  done with, you will see, I think, that for me to seek you out would be, to say the least of it, unusual. You left our father's house for reasons of your own; I had left it to be married to Tertius. Forgiveness, if you wish it from me, is yours: countenance of the step you took never. You will not ask it. So come here any morning that suits you, and I shall be pleased. You will find me ready to do everything 1 can to put you on your proper footing in the sphere to which you were born.  Believe me, my dear Sanchia,   Your affectionate sister,   Philippa Tompseti-King.   P. S. The Church s arms arc very wide. One cannot be too thankful, as things have turned out, that Claire Ingram never sued for divorce. God is most merciful.  There was some knitting of brows over this; and some chuckling. Comedy is  lie art of the chuckle; but it is very seldom that one of the persons in the play can prac- tise that which delights the spectators. San- chia was such a person. She could detach herself from herself, see her own lloutings and thwackings, and l e amused. At the same time her reply to Philippa was curt.  You,  she wrote,  are busy, and 1 am not. I will come to you one of these fine mornings, and must trust to Miss Mead- ows s sense of fitness not to work miracles that day.  A day or two later came a telegram from Vicky Sinclair.  Just got your letter. Coming at twelve. Vicky.  Sanchia glowed.  Just like her, the darling.  Philippa's astringent proposal was put aside. At twelve thirty-five there lit from a han- som an eager and pretty little lady, all in gauzy tissues and lace scarf, who knocked at the door like a postman and flew up the stair into Sanchia's arms.   Oh, Sancic, Sancie, how sweet of you to write  Now we are all going to be happy again for ever after. Oh, and here s Cuthbert I forgot.  In the doorway stood the erect form, and smiled the bronzed face, of Captain Sinclair of the Greys. His  How d'ye do, Miss Sanchia   was accompanied by a look of such curious inquiry that Sanchia gave him two lingers, said,   Quite well, thank you,  and no more. Much more had been ex- pected, and the captain was somewhat taken aback. He had been ready to wel- come the prodigal and admire her too. What s more, he had already very much ad- mired her. To have one s generous mo- tions damped by a coolness of that sort is sickening. But there it was: what could one say   what could one do   He went to the window and stood there, whistling in a whisper, until his wife dismissed him. To the Cavalry Club stalked he, working him- self into virtuous heat. There, at luncheon with a friend, he expatiated, which was un- wise and unmannerly at once. But his own wrongs swallowed up his wife s rights. "I ll be damned, Jack,  he took up his parable,  I ll be damned if ever 1 do a woman a good turn any more. Never, never again.

Square shoul- ders deep-chested gel. That sort.  He stared at the table-cloth hard.   I was taken by her, mightily taken. So when she and my wife had done kissin , I put in my little oar.   How d'ye do, Miss   i won t mention names, though upon my dick I don t know why 1 should t e squeamish. But there it was; and I d have kissed her, as you do kiss your wife s well, cousin, let's say if you want to. Bless you, not a bit of it. Proud as   epper. Gives me a linger:  Quite well.  says she.

Well, now, I tell you, that's the last time, absolutely the last time 1 do the civil thing to well, to that sort, if she s mv wife s grandmother.  He stared out of window, mist over his blue eyes.

II Vicky was enchanting; for half an hour Sanchia was at the top of bliss. To l e petted and diminutived by a butterfly it was like that; for though the child was a year older than she, six years of marriage had made a baby of her. Her audacities of old had become artless prattle, her sallies were skips in the air. Vet to be purred over by a kitten was pure joy. " You dar- ling  You darling little Sancie  You l eautiful, pale, Madame-de-Watteville kind of   erson  Oh, my treasure and I thought I should never see you again   So she cooed while she cuddled, Sanchia, for her part, saying little, but kissing much. Her lips were famished, but Vicky s must be free for moments if her words were to l e intelli- gible. During such times she stroked or patted the prodigal, and let her browse on her cheeks. By and by. raptures subsiding, the pair settled down for talk, and the discrepancies which eight years had made began to show up, like rocks and boulders in a strand left bare by the ebb. Grotesque the shapes of some of them, comical others; but wrecks and dead things come to light at low water  spectral matter, squalid, rueful matter. And there are chasms set yawning, too, which you cannot bridge. Sanchia was to be lacerated. No doubt it was laughable at first, as naivete is.  Cuthbert was very- funny about it   for instance.   He was awfully anxious to sec you, you know you had never met, I think  and yet not quite lik- ing it. He said it was a great risk; he seemed to think I ought not to be there. He takes great care of me, the darling. And there was little Dickie, you see. Sancie  he can just walk a kind of totter from my knees to Cuthbert s and then so proud of himself  Cuthbert said that my duty was to Dickie; but I told him that I meant to come.  Yes, it was comical.   Did Captain Sin- clair think I should give him a complaint    Sanchia was smiling, with eyes and mouth; but the smile was fixed. Vicky hugged her.  You dear one  Prettiness is your complaint. I should like him to have some of that.  She held her at amis  length, looked and glowed, and kissed. She took a serious tone, for the matter was serious.   You know, Sancie, you re the only beauty in our family, the only real beauty. Philippa s awfully handsome, I know, and greatly admired and I ve al- ways said that Melot is lovely. There are those three sorts of woman, you know. Philippa s handsome, Mclot s lovely, and you re beautiful. Then there s prettiness. I know I m rather pretty: everybody says so. Besides, there s Cuthbert. Oh, you can always tell  For one thing he s so fussy about my clothes you ve no idea.  She preened herself, like a pigeon in the sun, before she returned to her praises.   But you  You re quite different. You re like a goddess.  She touched her curiously.   Yes, 1 thought so. Exactly like a god- dess.   She sighed.   I can t think how you do it. Swedish exercises  I know it s wonderful what they do for you in no time. But you have to think about them all the while, and I think of Cuthbert and Dickie and the horses and, oh, all sorts of things'. I hose sort, 1 mean nice things.  She pondered Sanchia s godhead, shaking her pretty draperies out, then recalled her- self.  Oh, yes, about coming here. Of Rest Harrow 707 course I knew that mamma would make a fuss but I bad determined long ago,before 1 dreamed that it w ould ever happen, not to tell her a word. It was only Cuthljert who made me feel well, serious. He is so wise, such a man of the world  But 1 told him that I meant to come whatever he could say  and afterwards it turned out that he wanted to come too. He was really quite keen. Wasn't that sweet of him   You would adore Cuthbert if you knew him as well as I do. But. of course, that's absurd.  She suddenly became intense.  Sancie   she said, then stop  ed anil peered.  Yes   It was a sobered goddess who waited for close quarters. Vicky put her question, but peered no more.   I wish you would tell me one thing, which has always puzzled me. But don t, if you would rather not. How did you   I simply can't understand it how did you ever   I suppose you loved him very much   Sanchia w'as in a hard stare.   Yes,  she said slowly,   1 suppose I did.  Vicky s head darted back.   Ah  But now you don't a bit. I knew you didn'tI Sancie, that s what I can't understand. Because, you know, when you re married, you do. You always love the same person. You must you can t help it. He s so natural: he knows things that you know. He knows everything. Oh, Sancie, 1 can't talk about it, but you understand, don't you   Poor Sanchia nodded, not able to look up. Alas for her secrets, offered, taken, and for- gotten  But Vicky's vivacious fingers groped in her empty cupboard.  And then, as well as that, you ought to love him. You see, you ve promised; it s all been made so sacred. You never forget it -the clergyman, and the altar, and the hymns. You're all in while veiled. And you kneel there before the altar and he holds your hand. And the ring oh, Sancie, thefecling of the ring    She opened her little hand and lookeddownatthcsmoothed gold,coiled be- low the diamonds and pearls.   You never forget the first feel of that. It means every- thing   She blushed, and said, in a hushed sort of way,   It meant Dickie, to me.  Sanchia drooped and bled. Vicky, deep in her holy joys, was remorseless. Even when she turned once more to her sister s affairs her consolation made wounds.   Cuthbert said that it would come all right now now that Mrs. Ingram the wife was  That s rather horrible. Even you must feel that. Instead of being sorry that his wife is dead, one has to be awfully glad. I suppose you felt that at once; and of course Ac did. Poor woman  I wonder if she was buried in her ring.  She eyed her own.  No one would dare to take it off. I made Cuthbert promise me this morning. But of course people do marry again, and it will lie practically the same as that.  She reflected.   Yes, practically, it will, but oh, it s very extraordinary  You've had all your fun of engagement and all that, long ago.  She looked down deep- ly at her hand; and then she gazed at her sister.  And, oh, Sancie, you ve had your honeymoon    Before the deadly simplicity of that last stroke Sanchia fell, and lay quiv- ering. She could not ask for mercy, she could explain, extenuate, nothing. Hud- dled she lay. At this aching moment the one tiling that the world held worth her hav- ing seemed to be the approbation of tliis butterfly child. For Vicky s happiness was specific. Nuptial bliss lay, as it were, crystallized within it. There are moments in one's life when love itself seems lust, and safety the only holy thing. Vicky, tearing at her heart, had turned her head. Vicky once gone, with promise of fre- quent intercourse by letter and otherwise, it was to Philippa s fine house and respect- able man-servant she next surrendered her- self. The meeting was cool, but not intol- erable to a goddess sore front Vicky's whip. Philippa could ply a longer lash, but not by the same right, nor with the same passion to drive it right. Sanchia s eyes met hers upon the level: and if the elder had a firmly modelled chin, so had the younger sister. Her strength, too, lay, as it always had, in saying little, whereas Philippa s forte was dialogue. But it needs two for that. After the first greeting there came a pause, in which the embarrassment, upon the whole, was Mrs. Tompsett-Ring s. The trenchant lady had had her sailing orders, and was going to follow them. Mr. Tompsett-King had told her that Sanchia must be led, not driven, into Ingram s arms.  Assume the best of her, my dear friend,  he had said.   if you wish to get the best out of her. Take right intentions for granted. 70S Rest Harrow It is very seldom that a woman can resist that kind of flattery. So far as I can read your sister s mind, she has suffered from your mother s abrupt methods. I beg of you not to repeat them. Nothing but mis- chief could come of it.  When Mr. Tomp- sett-King called her his dear friend, she knew that he was serious. But Sanchia s mood had not been reck- oned with: Philippa was not Vicky. In the old days, in a wonderfully harmonious household, there had been a latent rivalry between her and all her juniors. The great- est trouble had been with Sanchia, the de- liberate. And so it was now that when the elder warmed to her task of making bad best, she was suddenly chilled by that old pondering and weighing which had always offended her. Sanchia replied to her as- sumptions and suppositions by saying sim- ply that she didn't know where Mr. Ingram was, and that he was no better informed than she. But surely Philippa raised her brows but surely she knew when he was coming to London   Sanchia s head-shake shocked her. There was but one conclu- sion to be drawn from it.  'There s been a quarrel,  then said she.   No,  Sanchia answered as if thinking it out   No, I shouldn t say that. I should say, a difference of opinion.    My dear,  said Philippa and the phrase with her was one of reproof  on essentials there can have been none. He will wait a year, of course. Under the cir- cumstances, a full year. But-  Sanchia had replied.   I don t know what he means to do. I have left VVanless.    Oh, of course, of course. But I was going to say I fully expect that he has written to mamma.  Santhia s eyebrows and her   I should think that unlikely. Why should he write to mamma   fright- ened Philippa, while to Mr. Tompsett- King s advice it was clear gain. It was necessary', after it, to get on to surer ground. The interview terminated by an understand- ing that Sanchia should write to her mother. Philippa took her husband to dine in Great Cumberland Place that night; and there, he with Mr. Percival, she with the lady, obtained the terms of a settlement. Sanchia was to be allowed a hundred a year  for the present.  Mr. Percival intended privately to make it two.  Everything was to be assumed in her favor; but she was not to be asked to meet company'. Neither Mrs. Percival nor Philippa could be brought to that, and Mr. Percival, so far as he was con- cerned, had no desire for any sort of com- pany but hers. lie was one of those men made rosy-gilled for happiness. Good fel- lowship, the domestic affections if they were not there, they must appear to be. His friends of the city were always on his lips  Old Tom Peters Old Jack Summers- Old Bob Old Dick. Good fellows every- one. All the pet names in the family had been his. To him belonged Pippa and Sancic, Melot and Vicky.   My girls,  or   My rascals,  he used to call them to Tom Peters or Jack Summers, and bring them home jerky little tin pedestrians from the city, or emus pulling little carts; or  later on  bowls of goldfish or violet nosegays from Covent Garden. If he had a nearer pas- sion, it was to stand well with all the world. That s two passions, however, to his score; and the struggle between them, in San- chia s case, had taken him as near tragedy as the easy man could go. Heaven lie praised, the good times were come again. Now he was all for the return of the prodi- gal, without conditions   and no questions asked,  as he put it. But in this he could not get his dear de- sire. Philippa's sense of justice was in- tlamed, as well as her moral sense. What  you eat a cake, and then, instead of sitting down to your plain bread and butter  away you flounce, and get ready to cat an- other cake  That s dead against the prov- erb, that s monstrous, that s offensive.  Mamma, mamma,  Philippa had pro- tested.  you can never have her back to flourish her sin in all our faces.   Thank you, Philippa, for reminding me, however gratuitously, of my duties to society',  had been Mrs. Percival s acknowl- edgment. She liked sin as little as Philippa, but she liked being lectured a great deal less. Poor Mr. Percival had pulled bis whiskers throughout the debate, and now sighed, as hebit them. His girl was to lie denied him  but iie could give her two hundred a year, and go to see her often. That was comfort. And then the meeting took place. First with mamma, who had never liked her, and was now a little afraid of what she might do. For Philippa had made it quite plain that if Rest Harrow 709 Sanchia was not humored, she would have nothing to say to Ingram.  She's ex- hausted her criminal passion that s what it comes to,  was Philippa s judgment. "Now she will have to l e cajoled.  So Mrs. Percival was cowed into civility. The pair conversed, rather painfully, for perhaps an hour. They had tea. All the effort to talk was made by Sanchia, who broached the children Philippa s three, Vicky s one and got nothing but perfunc- tory enthusiasm in reply. Mrs. Percival was far too sincerely interested in herself to care for children. The sons-in-law proved a better subject. Here she could point a moral inwards. She extolled them highly  never was woman so blessed in her daughters  husbands. Mr. Tompsett-King    TerUus, the soul of honor: the most delicate-minded man I have ever known. And sensitive to a fault  I assure you   Captain Sinclair was  our gallant Cuth- bert,   or  my soldier son.   Sweet little Vicky s  knight  Chivalry lives again in him. It has been the greatest blessing in my days of trouble to be sure of the ideal happiness of those two young lives. Ah  one does have one s consolations.  This eulogium seemed to leave little to be said for Mclusinc and her prize; and yet it was certain that Mrs. Percival favored Gerald Scales above the others. A lift of the voice was observable   Gerald, who, naturally, is quite at home at Marlborough House. . . .    Gerald, with that charm- ing old-world courtesy of his. . . .   Dear Lady Scales told me that, of her two sons, Gerald should have been the baronet. Poor Sir Matthew suffers from hay-fever to that extent. . . . But Gerald is a splendid young man. Darling Melot is, I need not tell you, fully appreciated at Winkley.  That was the seat of Sir Matthew in Essex. Sanchia, for her part, having regained the throne of her serenity from which Vicky had toppled her of late by means of Phi- lippa, was able to contemplate this singular parent of hers with the interest due to a curious object, and some internal amuse- ment. She was too far removed from her to be moved, too much estranged to be hurt. She wondered at herself for feeling so little of what, in the days of babyhood, she had firmly held to be the devout opinion. She found that, from a child, she had always judged her mother, and was sure now that her mother knew it. She remembered how hopeless she had always known it to be to explain any attitude of mind she may have exhibited and been blamed for. So now, though it was abundantly clear to her what was hoped of her, and though she could see perfectly well that the chance of her doing it was so risky that she must be handled like a heavy fish on a light line, she made no effort whatever to show why what was to be hoped for was absurdly impossible. She watched her mother sail about it and about in ever- narrowing circles, heard herself commended for her promptitude in leaving Wanless, an- swered inquiries as to Ingram's behavior un- der what Sirs. Percival otiosely called  his bereavement,  echoed speculations as to his whereabouts played, in short, vacantly an empty part, and kept her mother upon ten- terhooks. She gained civil entreaty this way. But her father s bustling entry changed all this. She had not known of herself how susceptible she still was Vicky had made her cower; but her father made her cry. He affected a bluff ease in his manner of greeting her.   Well, Sancie, well, my dear, well, well   and then he cleared his throat; but he did not dare to look at her. Sancie answered him by jumping into his arms, and upset him altogether.   Oh, my girl, my girl my little Sancie    and then thcpairof them mingled tears, while Mrs. Percival, who thought this exhibition out of place   under the circumstances,  and not in the best pos- sible taste, tapped her foot on the carpet, and wished that Philippa had been here. But, once they were beyond a certain floodmark, as she knew by long acquaint- ance, Mr. Percival s emotions must be given play. She retired, therefore, and left the clinging pair. Directly she wTas gone, the good gentleman s embrace of his child grew straiter, and his kisses of her brows and hair more ardent. He humbled himself before her, thanked her for coming back to him.  My darling, it was line of you to come   Pon my soul, it was fine     No, darling, no,  she protested, smiling sadly at his fondness.  I always loved you, my child  My Sancie you know that of your old father,  hey   He pinched her cheek before he kissed it again.   Pon my life, it cut me down like a frost to do what was done.

She allowed him to speculate as he would; and her moth- er, returning, found the pair, one on the other s knee, with the future cut and dried. But Sanchia rose at her entry.   Dearest, I must go now,  she told him,  but I ll see you again very soon.  He urged her to stay and dine.   We re quite alone, you know. No ceremony with our child, hey   But she smilingly refused.

We ll talk about it soon. But I must go now to my books. I m working very hard, at mv Italian. I ve forgotten lots.  He had to let her go but, manlike, he must relieve himself in a man's way. He drew her into his study, bade her   see what she should see.  He went to his desk and sat to his check-book. He returned with the slip wet in his hand.   There, my child, there. That will keep the wolf from thedoor, I hope. For a day or two, you know.  She read   Miss Sanchia Pcrcival two hundred pounds sterling.  It brought the tears to her eyes again. It was so exactly like him.   You darling how' ridiculous of you  but how sweet   He glowed under her praises.  Plenty more where that came from, Sancie  then piously added,  Thank God, oi course.  Sanchia, in the hall, turned to her mother.   Good-bye, mother,  she said, and held her hand out  Mrs. Percival took it, drew her in, and kissed her forehead.   Good-by, my child.  She could not, for her life, be more Cordial than that. The offence itself seemed a pinprick lieside the rankle of the wound to her pride. This child had set up for herself, and was now returned without extenuation, without plea for mercy. Shewasoncof those peoplewhocannot be happyunless theirright to rule be unquestioned. Had the girl hum- bled herself to the dust, grovelled at her feet, she would have taken her to her breast. But Sanchiastood upright, and Mrs. Percival felt the frost gripe at her heart. It must be so. Her father went with her to the door his arm about her waist.  Come soon,  he pleaded, and when she promised, whispered in her ear   Come to The Poultry, if you d rather I m always there as you know,   iime, and we ll lunch together. You ll l e like a nosegay in the dusty' old place.    Yes, yes, I shall come often,  she told him, and nestled to his side. Then she put up her cheek for his kiss.  Good-night, papa dear.  He wept over her, and let her go. Then he returned to his hearth and his wife. In his now exalted mood he was really master of both, and Mrs. Percival knew- it.   You gave her the money, I sup- pose.-'  she said; and he,  Yes, my dear, I gave her two hundred pounds.  He had doubled the sum agreed, but Mrs. Percival let it pass. Ill 1- pon this footing her affairs now stood: she was to be one of the family, with two hundred pounds a year to her credit, the run of her teeth in the house, and  by' a secret arrangement  as often in her father s com- Rest Harrow 711 pany as she could find time to be. Mean- time, by her own deliberate choice, she maintained her lodging in Pimlico, and read at the Museum most days of the week. She prepared herself to be happy, and under a buoyant impulse, due to the softening of her affections, wrote to her friend Mr. Chevenix and asked him to come to see her. That he briskly did. She received him cordially. 11 was good to see the cheerful youth again, and to be able to rejoice in the man of the world he affected to be. A man of the world throned, as it were, upon the brows of a suckling. Wisdom was justified of her child.  So you cut it  Thought you would.

I didn t know her from Adam, you know, but still  Oh, you ll like Aunt Wenman. She ll want you to live with her, and you might do much worse.  Sanchia listened, smiled, and pondered. It was not her way to be disposed of so simply. What was most impressive to her about this conversation was the real reticence un- derlying the chatter of her friend. She could feel his conviction of her want of tone; she was convinced of it herself. Her pur- pose in life seemed gone. Once it had been love, next it had been the ordering of affairs. The second had been so absorbing that she had not missed the first; indeed, she had be- lieved it there until the very end, when she had called it up, and had no answer. But now what aim had she, in this lonely, empty life she was leading, whose hours were so many that she had to fill them up with Italian got out of books  Without knowing it,it was life she wanted, not books. She with her brains, vitality, beauty, and charm had been growing in these graces un- aware, flowering in secret at Wanless under her aprons, behind her account-books and garden gloves. Now that all these swad- dling bands were stripped off her, behold her, armed at all points for the lists. So Chevenix had beheld her, it seems. Let her sec the world, approve her mettle, run her career. Chevenix, watching her, judged in those pondering eyes, in that half-smile which had charmed him before, a kind of quivering expectancy, new to her. He judged her tempted, and renewed his sug- gestions.   What you want,  he told her,  is to try a fall or two with the world. You ve been too snug, you know too long under glass. You left the schoolroom to go to Wanless  and where were you there  Under cover. You want the sun, the wind, and the rain; you want to know what these things feel like and how the rest of us take  em. And you want to be seen, if you ll let me say that. We all like being looked at, I believe. I 712 Rest Harrow know that I do, when I m quite sure about my hat. Now you won t get much of that in a Warwick Street two-pair front, let me tell you no, nor in your B. 17, or whatever your seat is, at the Museum. You re a star you re to shine. Well, give  em a turn in Charles Street. I ll fix it up for you. I wish you d think it over.   She gave him grateful looks, hut said little. Nevertheless, he went away encouraged. A week or so later, she found a card upon her table: that of a Mrs. John Chevcnix.  That's my sister-in-law,  the friendly youth told her.  That s Mrs. John. You go and see her. She's a good sort of wom- an. You ll meet Aunt Wenman there. I thought it all out, and that s the way to get at it. She ll jump at you, in my opinion. She loves orphans. Collects em. You go   She was due in the city on a visit to her father, was, in fact, dressed for it in her best white frock, roses in her hat. She promised to think of it and of course would return Mrs. John s call. The amiable youth ac- companied her as far Eastward as it was possible for him to go. He went, indeed, further, and in full view of St. Paul's de- cided upon a visit to that sanctuary. You never knew your luck, he said. He might meet Senhousc there.

I believe I should,  she admitted.   I should love to see him again.    He'll turn up at Aunt Wenman s, I'll bet you,  Chevenix felt sure.  She rakes  em in all sorts. l o think about her, now, there s a dear. You won t be able to stick it at home, you know.    I msurethat I sha n t go home,  Sanchia said.  And law thinking about your aunt.    Right,  cried Chevenix, and briskly mounted the steps of the cathedral. Mr. Percival had provided a tea for her which had the appearance of a banquet. The table seemed sunk in flowers; a great urn held the tea. There were buns in pyra- mids, snow-mantled cakes, apricot jam, strawberries, clotted cream. Nothing was too good for his beloved, as he cried aloud when he saw her, fresh and glowing in her lace frock and flower-wreathed hat.   My girl and upon my soul, a picture   She blushed at his praises, and came in kissing distance.  Y'ou make a school- trcat of me, dearest. You mustn t be wick- ed with your money, or I sha n t come any more to see you. I won t be spoiled.    No, my dear, no and you can t be,  he assured her.   Good Lord, my child, you re the only one I ve got left. All my birds flown but you  And I hadfiveof the sweet- est, sauciest, happiest girls in England once upon a time. . . . Now, come you and pour out a cup of tea for your foolish old father. We re snug here hey  Better than Great Cumberland hey  You mon- key   He pinched her ear and felt that they shared a secret. She caught his happiness, and bathed in his praises, feeling the sun upon her limbs. I low she 1  wed to be loved  1 low she loved to be praised for her good looks  The world had grown suddenly kind again: the world was good. There, ahead of her, stood Mrs. John Chevenix and a friendly Lady Maria, beckoning her to London de- lights, a friendly world of admiring eyes. She was to be looked at she was to listen  anti be heard. Her heart beat, eyes shone starry. Life, which had seemed behind her, now danced before, a gay procession. She told her father what seemed to be in the wind. He listened and stared.   Lady Maria, hey  Wc are going up in the world.

He looked at her anxiously, then away from her, while he patted her caught hand.    Yes, my dear, yes. 1 understand that you feel like that.

She thinks I m wicked; you think I m good. I don t know what I am I don't understand myself at all; but I m quite sure that I should do it again, if it had to l e done.  Her eyes grew large with the certainty of her argument. She had a divine seriousness, a rapt look, as of one inspired from within.   1 don't see how you can help it, if you see quite clearly that the person needs you. 11 seems disloyalty. It seems making too much of yourself as if what happened to that part of you mattered  And it seems making too little of yourself, too as if you shrank, as if you were afraid of vile people. One can t afford to be afraid for the sake of such a small thing.  Mr. Percival, nodding, patting her hand, put in a gentle remonstrance.   I shouldn t say that, Sa ncie, 1 shouldn t, indeed. It used to be considered everything in the world, to a woman.  She mused, then decided. "No. I can t understand that. It s not everything  To In i:c in tlu  world. It's almost nothing com- pared to other things like freedom. To me the only thing that seems to matter is one's mind. Freedom for that  You can give up anything else.

"I don t know, upon my soul, where you get these notions of yours, my dear. I don t, indeed. Not from me. I believe.  She smiled gently at him, but with a wist- ful tinge, as if she felt her isolation. " I don t know, either but there they are. I always know w hat I ve got to do. I see il, or feel it, ahead of me. There's a path that way, a path the other. I see the fork, and have to follow one of them. I always know which.  That was equally beyond him. He left it. and returned to a more practical puzzle- ment.   But when when you made up your mind about him, you know  I wish you would tell me.   I'll tell you everything I ean, dearest, of course."   W ell, now, your freedom, you know. Your freedom of mind. Now, you gave him your freedom, didn't you  And your mind too  Didn t you. now   She had to consider that, and he watched her with anxiety. But she looked him fair- ly in the face with her answer, so that he read the truth in her eyes.  'No," she told him.  No. lie never had that, luckily for me. I always knew what I had to do before he did; I could always see where he was right and I was wrong or the other way about. I don t think I could ever give up my judgment. At least   She had to think again ; and again she answered him, but with heightened color.  If I did it would be a different sort of person alto- gether. Quite a different person.  His face fell. This didn't sound like marriage-bells. "Oh, my dear   he said ruefully.   You don't mean to tell me    She jumped up and hugged him. " You darling old thing, of course not.  But she kept her face buried in his whiskers.   If I ever did that give up my mind, 1 mean   I believe I should be happier.  Mr. Percival had no doubt about it. He had old-fashioned opinions.  utimittl y Kitiycr 4Hut hi- wifr fly P.

The brown and purple moorlands come to rest me and the freshness of sunlit sand-dunes, salt wind and spray, and the ceaseless murmur of " Grenen   where the North Sea and the Baltic clash together. It is so strangely   north this Skagen; north of Copenhagen, north of I'rvderiks- havn, north across the moors in a hollow   f the mountainous sand ridges where they close in together l etween the seas. A l:t workshop is this for the Danish painters, R i c k e r t sons of Vikings, who. more than other men, seek to interpret the life of the sea. I had a foreshadowing of a unique ex- perience as we rushed through the great waste of darkness, past the lonely way stations that jM int the road to this seeming end of the world; and I was not disap- pointed. It began at Brondum s Hotel when the door was tlung wide upon the dark court- yard, showing against a background of panelled and painted wall, the yellow- bearded, genial face of Brottdum himself. There was in his welcome a delightful blending of dignity and friendliness, rare enough in inns, which somehow made me feel as if. after long wandering. I had come home. And when I stood on the threshold of mv room, the marvel grew    I he l.ifc-biMt Oui '       taunt  Tuxeo.

If this is the inn. " said I, " Skagen must be like no other place in the world.  And I fi ll asleep to the murmur of the sea In the morning 1 leaned from my window and felt that my last words were true, and I wondered why. There was nothing ex- traordinary in the scene l efore me. My muslin curtains were fluttering in the salt breeze, but no sea was visible. I looked out upon a patch of garden, a strip of sandy road on whi  It a woman in a shawl and a fisherman stood gossiping, and a plain little brick cottage or two with rows of splendid hollyhocks against their palings. Kverv- thing seemed familiar except the rack of drying fish in a bit of o  en prairie; and 710 yet all the familiar things had a different look they had suffered, perhaps, a  sea- change.  All in a moment 1 knew that I had the secret, though as yet I had seen nothing nf the splendor and the terror of the sea of Jutland. I felt that here as in few places in the world, the land and the ocean come together and are one. And yet it was long I before I could find the veritable sea, it lay so quietly under its maze    f dunes. 1 stumbled in and out among the tarred, red tiled fishermens' hut . wandered up and down sandy roads that begin anywhere and end haphazard. I came upon the little white church in its grove, strayed into the gay plantations "f young trees and out upon the moors, until after much vain climbing of turf and sand hummocks, I looked down at last upon the broad beaches and long lines of surf hammering the triple sunken reefs with a roar that 1 had heard, however faintly, in all my ranging, I fere was the lighthouse, .Skagen Fyr, towering among the sand- hills, and here the perpetual ridge of foam, as far as the eye could reach, though a    r 5Mermc i on the Iteiub a  Ska ei  '" l y F' S.

It is here at   Gronen   one sees at work the creative power that has made  "The Skaw   what it is. For countless centuries the waves have been heaping up enormous sand-dunes into a long, hook like pronimi- toiy, and changing the face of the moors. Several miles away rises ghost like the tower of the old Gothic church, which dur- ing service one day in 1775 was buried so swiftly and sodeeply that the people had to esca K: by the belfry. However 1   ng things and men may endure at Skagen they come at last into the net of the sea. This sand is strangely fertile. It is said to grow barley. And where the dunes are undisturbed, not only are their 1 rests held firm with the usual coarse scrub and tangle, hut in the hollows of them grow glorious masses of silver-gray sea-thistle with sky blue flowers, the largest 1 have ever seen; clumps of glossy, golden-berried sea-haw- tliorn, tiny forests of a fragrant white Lilli- putian orchid-like blossom, and 1 know not what else. It is. then, the unforgettable presence of the sea that gives its peculiar quality to the work of the Skagen painters. They have interpreted in their own ways, in the perfect medium of light and air that it gives, not only its innumerable moods, but anil more especially its effect upon the lives of the people in this little lishing village. Two things one feels strongly 011 this sea- built Skaw: that life is both serious and simple, and that it must be still much as it was in the days when Hamlet was Prime of the land. Then .is now there could have been only lishing and fish-curing, a little hunting on the moors, a little grazing on scanty 'trips of grass, a little tillage lietween the bog and the sand. Then as now, these few men, dwelling miles from their fellows across treacherous bog-lands, lighting for their lives in the struggle for a livelihood, must have   ecn a folk of simple ideas with a strong feeling of the imminence of death in life. Some battles befell not far away, and it may l e that a Viking chief lies buried in the tumulus on the shore; but sailors have landed rarely until these last years, since the harbor has been built, and the 7i7  The l.ifc-b-it i  Driver.

Mlch e  Amkf- Vci  at r  tr.tt  lvV . h l line thrll lifts tot   Kui Skagen folk have grown to express theirown individuality without the interference that conies of constant clashing with other lives. For centuries they have worked together in a kind of brotherhood, of which the greatest friend and the greatest foe is the sea; and it is the realization of this lon  history of travail that gives to their faces the spiritual significance reflected in the art of theSkagen painters. These summer days, in the friendly at- mosphere of Brondunt s. I saw but one aspect of their work. What room was there for affectation, mannerism, or ornament in the bare simpli  itv of the sea   There was no temptation to the conventional, often spurious, picturesque, for the village is cleanly built and in straight lines; and the great contentions of wind and sun allow no mould or fungus or decay. Even the artistic apparatus of a peasant dress is lacking: the more directly do the painters approach the deeper beauty. Yes. I could feel the freshness, the un- studied charm of Skagen: and its darker 71S side, the shadow ol" it  brilliant sunlight, came to me through many winter tales. 1 could scarcely imagine life in a place where there have been twenty shipwrecks in a year: much less could I conceive any truth in that legend of I.ittle Christmas live  December 23 . 1S25, when fifty merchantmen came ashore in the night. But when I went to the Skagen Hotel and saw a great room tilled like a museum with the figureheads and name-boards of ships of all nations, then 1 began to understand the stern-featured men and sober-eyed women; andl felt the emotional background that, like a second atmosphere, gives a strange power to the Skagen pictures. And when I had seen the life-boat and the life- Uiatmen, w ho year after year risk and lose their lives for other lives, I felt something of the world of grim experience that underlies the quiet watchtulnessof Kriiyer's" Evening on the Beach at Skagen.  and the cheerful gossip of Michael Ant her's group of lisher- men on the sunlit sands, as well as the tragedies of the sea painted by Fru Anna SUagen 719 Ancher. The sheer vitality   f the air in which life grows strongly and freely deep- ens ihe bitterness of the contrast when the sea has its way. 1 went to church on Sunday morning, and there 1 saw again rows of faces that filled me with longing to know the strange his- tories written upon them.    n the one side were the women in their Mac k dresses; on the other, the serge-clad men. And there was no extraneous ornament of Iniilding or of dress to lessen the effect of the spiritual beauty that shone upon them almost like a presence. And when service was done, the j eople lingered for a christening; and 1 saw in the life one of Michael Anchor s pictures, and perceived that it was the simplest possible study from reality. A fisherman's child, Nils Olaf- I think was named: and he took the ceremony with a lively sense of tragedy, in marked contrast with the composed faces of the elders round about him. The thought that clung to me persistently, as I watched the scene, was of the limitations of this deep and narrow life. Little Nils Olaf, unless he were swept away in some sudden disaster, would grow old like his ancestors before him, in this simple ancient form of existence. For him, almost certainly, there would lie little choice of ways, scant complexity of ex  erience; and in this, is he the happier  It is not difficult to understand how from their study of these Skagcn faces, the Da- nish painters have learned to invest their portraits with vitality and strength. Per- haps chief among them in this respect is Michael Anc her: and it is curious to note how, on the one hand, he uses the sea as a background, and how, on the other, he has attained a marvellous directness and sim- plicity that makes his highest achievements not unworthy of Rembrandt. But Skagcn is not only the workshop, it is the home   f painters, several of whom have built houses of their own, while others are content with the genial simplicity of Brondum's. There are traces of their stay " liunul    Dy Fru Anna AncHcr S iirttu l beaut  that ;Ik iic upm  rhrtn  liaott lil c   Anchor's Sludi.  under this roof-tree in the sketches that cover the panels of the dining-room walls, an l the portraits of themselves that make a frieze,   f which the central face is that of ruddy Brondum himself, cigar in mouth. For si .me reason perhaps bccause it has been for several generations in the same family the inn is the abode of singularly pleasant customs. One is that the master himself sits at the head of his long table, and that the guests feel themselves enough nf a family t   linger about in small informal groups until all have assembled. F.ven the total stranger without introductions, does not find it necessary long to study the sea- pieces and landscape and interiors and fantasies and still life that adorn the walls; for your Dane is the most friendly and hospitable man in the world, and the spirit at Brondum s is distinctly social. liven language is no barrier. The Dane learns F.tiglish, French, and German, because, as he says, nobody can or will learn Danish. Another pleasant way at Briindum's is that after-dinner coffee is a social function.

You find small groups in the little salon with its books and piano,  ierhaps one or two in the writing-room; but for the most part, the guests step through the ojven door into the garden, where it is easy to pass an hour or two at the rustic tables under the trees. Sunday evenings, all the year round, the members of the artist colony are Brondum's guests. Possibly the custom arose origi- nally through the fact that Fru Anna Anther is the daughter ol the house. The table is rearranged so that the supper party can be together; and there is no lack of the in- tercourse that lives by its own vitality while the hours drift awav. One looks from the guests to the clever study by Krilyeron the wall of a similar gathering in which some of the same people apjjear, and so one realizes the full truth of the representa- tion. In its own way, this scene is as interesting as that in the little church. Here is Kriiyer himself, burly and red bearded, with blinking eyes that seem to see all things at once; here is the dark, ascetic face of Paulsen, scholar among painters; Tu c   -t home.   I Skagen Michael Ancher and hi  wife. here is Professor  Tuxen, iron-gray, fur- rowed, and kindly, with him his charming Norwegian wife: here is Michael Ancher, bluff, gray bearded, soft of speech, and his wife, with her clear-cut, eager profile and pretty laugh. In my lime it was already to   late for the literary giant, Holger Drachntaim. whose Viking-presence used to dominate these gatherings. He was then in his last illness, and only a few months later his ashes were placed in an um by the sea at Skagen . but I was familiar with the look of him from the portraits that several   f the artisl  had been making, in the realization that the end was not far. Apart from Brondunvs. life at Skagen shows the same charming simplicity and freedom that seem to thrive in the air of the place. Professor Tuxen, Court painter in England as well as in Denmark, has built himself a beautiful house, in which Queen Alexandra herself has photographed him with his family; but it is noticcable for these rare qualities. Alike in the llowcr massed garden where tea is served, English fashion, under the trees, and in the deli- ciously quaint dining-room with its sanded floor, its long table under the window, and its barbaric, painted furniture atypi- cal Scandinavian interior there is Iteauty rather than splendor, anil a wit almost Gallic to lighten the Danish profusion of hospitality. After supper we gather in the bare, lofty studio. There are cushions on the floor and a great wood tire blazes and crackles on the hearth. Two concen- tric circles of . andles hang from the roof, the two kinds of light giving such effects as Viego Johansen sometimes paints. The men smoke and there is coffee. Some play billiards. Stories arc told . . . and the hours have slipped away past midnight. The Anchors have always lived for I he most part at Skagen: and for many years K.rover has come to dwell in one of the charming, long, low houses of the older Danish fashion. Sometimes these are tarred, sometimes built of concrete with visible timber framewi rk: they are usually red-tiled and one-storied, and have an interminable row of windows I have counted as many as fifteen and perhaps several doors. They have gay gardens: in the autumn the hollyhocks flaunt up to the very tiles. I have never seen else- where such glorious hollyhocks as in Denmark, 1'he summer I was in Skagen was a little train portrait making.

In K rover's studio, I watched the ariist at work upon a study of Paulsen, while he discoursed easily in French upon theories of art: and in Ant her s house, the master brought forth his unfinished portrait of Kroyer, similar in style to his own su  erb self-portrait in the National Gallery at Copenhagen. Everywhere among these painter-folk one feels the spirit of high endeavor and of earnest toil that never claims to reach its ideal. Here seems to be no waste, no friction, no hurry. Every step is toward its end, and the end is worthy. And yet this is not all. Life here may be fresh and real and child-like, but it is more than these things. It is in the words of one who lives at Skagen,  So amusing   Amusing  With that background of trag- edy  Yes. Ijecausc of it. Imperfect Eng- lish had stumbled upon a happier word than one more accurate. Nowhere can in- terest in daily happenings Ih  keener than where these are threatened with change; and nowhere does the play of life seem more joyous than where the reality is grimmest. I have sometimes thought that the gay independence of Skagen. its verve and its daring, appear in a little tale of Fru Anna Ancher. One rainy day she put on her mackintosh and went to the station to see the Tuxens off to England. "Come to Frederikshavn with us, Anna " they said. 724 The Man Who Missed His Moment She laughed:   I ve only three farthings in my pocket.  But she went. So they coaxed her to Aarhus and to Esbjerg; and at Esbjerg they said:  You might as well come all the way now." So she sent a telegram to her husband and went to England, in a mackintosh, with three farthings in her pocket, and less than three words of English   n her tongue  Anil for this spirit, 1 take it, Skagcn is to blame, and the sea that made Vikings. I had a message, the other day, fn ni the garden where the elm-tops are always swayed in the sea wind; and as 1 read it memories began to throng. . . . There was the day we drove out among the sand- dunes with the children. We had tea kept hot in straw-packed bottles, and   oured Out into brown peasant ware; and we drove back along the hard floor of the wet beach. Once it yielded a bit and Nina- -or was it Vibcke - was rather frightened. . . .There was that early morning rush down to the sea for the life-boat practice, and the gos- sip with the old sailor, and coffee in the summer-house that he had built at the end of a curious maze. . . . There were studio talks and garden talks, and rambles over the sand and over the moors; and all the while there was the strong home-feeling in a strange land. But in the end came farewells at the station; and as the little toy train moved away, I had left of Skagen no more than two great La France roses in my hand, a blur of receding sand-dunes, purple against a sunset of orange and gold, and a lasting memory of strong and friendly hearts that help one to find the whole world akin. THE MAN WHO MISSED HIS MOMENT By Gerald Chittenden 1 LLL'sr rations nv Irma In ni sikai x  IT S been a tiresome term, hasn't it. I Martin   suggested Mrs. Graham.  Not so tiresome as the day,  he answered.  I had to red-ink the same grammatical error in eighteen different and consecutive examination papers, anil if young Morgan had made it in the nine- teenth, I should have killed him slowly and painfully.

They re nice boys, but they lay instead of lie like a lot of hens. That thread will have to bant before it can get through the eye of your needle.  It was in before Ik- had finished speaking, but her glasses fell off, and it popped out again.  It s the rich man and the kingdom of heaven,  commented Graham.  Try again. It's only twice too large for the hole.   Only women can do the impossible,  she answered unperturbed, and succeeded forthwith.  There   "You're right, ' lu- answered, with un- expected seriousness;  only women can.  lie Ijent forward to knock out his pi  e on the andiron, and remained for a momenl with his elbows on his knees, staring at the fire. She looked across at him, her needle caught in the middle of a stitch; the sad- ness of his face was very evident, because he did not know that she was watching him. She went on with her sewing, cast- ing furtive glances at him the while: pres- ently the sound of sleigh Ix-lls broke the silence.  There's Johnny,  said Graham, and rose. A draught of air made the lire flicker, and their elder boy- the one who was a Senior at Vale came in, kissed hi  mother, shimk hands with his father, and asked for a cup of tea. "Why, it's nearly dinner lime,  ob- jected Mrs. Graham, as she touched a match to the alcohol lamp;  you'll have She looked ucro  at turn. I cr needle caught in tbc loniul- of :i siitch-.

When will you learn to take care of your eyes " "Probably never. Besides, it's not very close work. Do turn on the light.  The house was wired for electricity, ap- parently for use in illuminating the bath- room. It was never used anywhere else. John lit the lamp.  McGurk drove me up.  he said, a  he replaced the chimney.  He had to leave Seaburv anil Hawkins at the school, -m  we went there lirst.    They re back for the alumni dinner, 1 suppose   said Mrs. Graham.   Yes. I stopped there a moment to see the kid. He told me to till you he was bringing a couplc of boys over for dinner.   Porthos and Athos, 1 suppose   asked Graham.  The same, They re a great triumvi- rate, aren t they  Mr. Blake said that the Judge and the Magnate were going to ar- rive to-night."  Good  1 haven t seen either of them for an age.  Mrs. Graham had gone out to tell the cook that there would be extra people to dinner, and the pious ejaculations of that perfervid Hibernian retainer, who always prayed both long and loud when told of an unexpected guest, came faintly from the kitchen.  Maggie s always up to sample, i n t she    commented John.   I wonder if we could get along without her     We couldn t, and she knows it,  replied Graham.  Did Maggie enter her usual protest   he asked, as his wife came back. 7 5 The Man Who Missed His Moment   The shteak is not made av rubber, praises be,   quoted Mrs. Graham, in a rich South Irish brogue.   Ah' how can I make food fer three feed a dozen   Answer me thot   Oh, Maggie is too absvird.    Protest is in her blood,   answered Graham,  and she doesn t mean any more by it than any other Irish legislator. Here   ome the boys,  he added, as the stamping of feet and a laugh in the corridor heralded the Three Musketeers.  We re not late, are we   asked Peter, the younger of the Graham boys. "It s snowing again.   1 suppose it will lie one of those con- founded white Christmases,  commented Graham as lie shook hands with Porthos and Athos.  Well, perhaps they have their good points,  he corrected as he caught his wife s reproachful eye.  Mrs. Graham will never let me say anything against them, but I d prefer to migrate every winter to some country that wasn't so aggressively Puritanical the West In- dies, for instance. Many old boys back for the dinner    Lots,  answered Peter,  and more coming to-morrow. The Judge and the Magnate get here on the eight o clock. It s great they re coming.   Who arc they exactly     asked Athos.  They re the two I joys that gave me the most trouble in my first year here.  an- swered Graham.  Evervliody prophesied an evil end for both of them, and evervliody was right, as usual. One s a judge of the Circuit Court, and the other owns all the railroads east of the Mississippi.   Then how do you mean that everybody was right  " asked Porthos, who sometimes rose too late for the fly.  Because everybody can t possibly be wrong,  replied Athos, indulgently.  Porthos,  said Peter, his eves on the ceiling,  Porthos doesn t express himself at all. He comes by freight in the ca- boose.   Dinner s ready,  interrupted Mrs. Graham, who was always a little afraid that school boy badinage might hurt the feelings of her good friend Porthos. In her girlhood she had known his mother, and had lieen intimate   acquainted with him- self when he was an infant; as a conse- quence  he could never realize that lie was old enough to take care of himself.  All the same,  said Porthos to Athos as they moved toward the dining-room,  I don t think Mr. Graham prophesied a bad end for either of them.  "Sh " said Athos, "he ll hear you.   Why shouldn't he   demanded Por- thos.  Idiot   responded Athos. It was a cheerful meal, served in the happy-go-lucky fashion that made all guests at the Grahams resolve to dismiss their servants and get a Maggie to do the work, if they had to go to Ireland after her. Bui they never did, because they could never find a Maggie. She was waitress, valet, cook, and spiritual adviser all in one, and this evening when she of cned the door to the Judge and the Magnate, she oftenly praised God for their presence. When Graham reached the door, she had l egun to scold them both for walking from the school iu a howling blizzard.  Well, well   said the Judge as he greeted Graham. "I don t believe you or vours have changed a bit since the Flood, and here's the Magnate bald as a tin lamp, and me with one foot in the grave.  Be it known, the Judge was so great that he had no need to be grammatical. "It s mighty good to be back,  said the Magnate, and they came into the library with Graham In-tween them, all three talking ai once.   It makes me feel twenty years younger to see you two again,  said Mrs. Graham.  Now, sit right down and tell me all about everything both of you Ix-fore a lot more old boys come and sidetrack Martin and me.  It was a large order, but they did their best to till it, and succeeded to such good purpose in fifteen minutes, that the three Musketeers sat silently agaj e except when t hey were laughing. The Magnate was a wit and the Judge was a humorist; Graham was a little of both, and Mrs. Graham knew how to keep them all going. As the room tilled with graduates. Graham and his wife were swept away in the currents   f hos- pitality, but not in-fore they had jointly ex- tracted promises from the Judge and the Magnate to remain after all the rest had gone.

Don t these boys average ten years younger than we did at their age   re- marked the Judge. "Do you put sentences like that in your opinions   retorted the Magnate. "I hojie not. Hut don t they   "They do." said the Magnate, and added,  Do you come back here to see the school or tt  sec Graham   "I've thought nf that too. I think it s Graham with me mostly Graham, at anv rate.   Me too,  said the Magnate.  1 often wonder why he ever stuck to school teach- ing.

Generally," said the Magnate, "a man can control circumstances if he s as strong as Graham is. But sometimes there's a psy- chological moment to secure control, and if you don t do it then you never can."  That s it   exclaimed the Judge.  Graham missed his moment, and lie was too good a sport ever to squeal about il to any one. That s why we re reasoning fn m a surmise instead of from a certainty now." 1 1 he e mutt be from nexxlv nil my former wives.

Do you suppose,  said the Magnate slowly,  that he ever thinks of that side of it      Not he  He doesn t know his own size in the first place.   Yet he s missed his moment, and he s not as happy as he should l e. Do you think any one ever tells him things such a.-  we ve been saying now   The Judge caught the idea. Afterward he claimed that he thought of it first, and that the Magnate only elaborated the Vot- XI.VII. 72 details. Eventually the discussion almost caused a rupture in their friendship. But just now there was no disputation, for the tim   was short if they were to put the great scheme through before Christmas. It was a scheme more Gallic than Anglo-Saxon; the Judge s name was Duhamel, and he afterward brought forward that fact in support of his claim of discovery, but the Magnate cast aspersions on his logic. The Magnate s name was Jenkins. The two were the last to leave Graham s house that night for their quarters in one of the school buildings; it was after one in the morning when the door closed be- hind them. Graham came back to the library when he had seen them off, and found John standing alone by the fire- place.  The snow is making fast,   he said as he sank into his favorite chair, and lit a good-night pipe.   It's nice to see them all again  some in rags and some in tags, and some in velvet gowns.  More velvet than rags, though, bless  em'   The pipe was going well, and he regarded his son 729 The Man W'lio Missed 11 is Moment keenly through the smoke.  What s on your mind, Johnny    Father,  answered the boy,  I've been thinking over our last conversation, and I can t see my way to being dependent on you for a medical education, with the kid com- thut time in a profession that deserved all a man's heart and had only half of mine.

Graham s hand had been over his eyes, shading them from the lamp. I le dropped it at John s last words, and the boy saw in his father s face something that was almost never visible there the bitter travail in which his characteristic smile had l ccn born.  Johnny,  said Graham after a moment,  you have no right to deprive your mother and me of anything we have looked forward to so long. If your inclinations-   You know my inclinations, sir."  Better than you do. They were mine once, and I ve had thirty years to get per- spective on them. I thought, as you do, that I could cam all I needed in three years  and I'm not a doctor yet. I ve been all an ambulance in I he street, or saw the out- side of a hospital.

If you are, you ll Ik  a failure too, and you may miss meeting the woman God made for you as 1 have not.  With a hand that trembled, the boy turned up the lamp till it smoked, and then turned it down again.  1 think I never understood before at least not quite. I'll let you pay.   Thanks,  said Graham, dryly. He rose and stood with his back to the fire- place. the one weak spot in his armor once more effectually concealed. Upon impulse, John placed both hands on his father's shoulders and looked into his eyes. The Man Who Missed Ilis Moment  Hut a failure you   he said.  1 think you re the most successful man in the world.  One of Graham's usual quizzical retorts was t n the tip of his tongue, but he did not 1st it slip off.  The leopard's spots, my dear boy," was all he said. " I'm a very fortunate man at any rate."  Aren t you two boys going to lied   said Mrs. Graham, entering at that mo- ment.  I ve decided to do what Father wants about studying medicine.  John blurted it out.   I m so glad.  She kissed him, and smiled at her husband.  Well, let s all go to bed,  said Graham, characteristically closing the subject. But he lingered after they had left the library, revolving many memories, and pondering many hopes. So well and carefully did the Judge and the Magnate conceal their tracks, that un- til Graham came down to breakfast on Christmas morning he suspected nothing. His end of the table was almost entirely covered with letters; Mrs. Graham, John, and Peter, who were accessories before the fact, were in a state of more or less sup- pressed enthusiasm, and Maggie, who al- ways invaded the dining-room horse, foot, and artillery when interested in anything that was going on there, was very much in evidence. Graham looked aghast at the letters.  My sins have found me out," he said.  Thesv must be from nearly all my former wives.   Look at  em, Dad,  pleaded Peter.  At the outside yes. But I shan t open them till I m a good deal less nervous than I am now. The Red Cross stamps alone would endow the Adirondacks.  He controlled his curiosity till he had finished his breakfast, and Maggie l e- came so impatient that she retired to the kitchen and smashed crockery for five minutes on end.  The condemned man ate heartily and seemed calm.  observed John, as his father o nned the first letter. Graham s face changed as he read, and lost the expression of whimsical dismay that had rested upon it since be entered the room. The deep lines softened; the calm optimism of it became vivified by a very poignant pleasure. It was. a shadow of the way he had looked at their wedding, his wife thought, and at a very few other times in their life together. He read letter after letter, oblivious or almost oblivious of tb - rest ofahis family. There were letters from men who had been boys thirty years ago, and from boys of last year; letters from boys he dimly remembered, and from some that he had almost completely forgotten; letters from the West, the Fast, the South, and the North; from Wall Street, and from the prairies. None of them were very long, but even- one of them recalled relations and events which he thought had long since faded from the memories of these Christmas correspondents. Some thanked him for some specific thing that he had done for them in the old days; some, and these were ihc most pleasant of all, thanked him not at all, but only wished him the merriest of Christmases; some jested, and a few were pensive. All the parties signatory had quite evidently written with a keen pleasure in the writing, for the Judge s circular letter had commanded this - if you can t do it con a more, don t do it at all.  A' Graham finished each letter lie passed it to John, and it went the round of the table. In the end, he looked across the centre- piece at his wife, then turned to John with a smile that, was as hi  old smile, yet in some way subtly different.  Perhaps,  he said,  you d better teach school after all.  Mulicro From x photograph l   br u   CW   nt A: Cu. of the pointing by f i cte Xjiitiunl. In ibc Music  Ic ChantMjr. MOLIERE AND LOUIS XIV By Urander Matthews I   Impromptu de Ver- sailles  was the first play   if Molii-re s written to the King s order; and it was speedily followed by others, commanded by Louis XIV and composed es  ecially for performance at court. It would lie idle to assert that these plays, prepared for particular occasions and cramped by the rigorous limitations of the court-ballet, have greatly raised M  - liere s reputation with posterity. But the cleverness and the ease with whii h he car- ried out the King's wishes, did lift him higher in the favor of the monarch, who had taken all power into his own hands. Perhaps we must consider these lighter trifles, put together hurriedly to meet the caprice of the King, as the price that Mi  liere paid for the privilege of writing his later and ampler plays t   please himself, the richer and deeper comedies in which he was able lo express himself more abundantly. Vet there is no reason to think that Mo- liere was working against the grain in trying lo gratify the King, or that he did not find amusement himself in the exercise of his in- ventive ingenuity. Probably the associa- tion with the King and with the court was as pleasant to him asit was profitable. Louis XIV was then young; he had only recently come into power; he was ardent in the pur- suit of pleasure. He enjoyed every kind of theatrical entertainment, delighting more Moliere and Louis XIV 733 particularly in musical spectacle. He was good-looking and graceful; and he liked to figure in the court ballets, a form of quasi- drama. which had a general likeness to the English masques  both of them being de- scended from the same Italian original. Popular at court for several reigns, these ballets had been mostly mythological in theme, as unreal as they were elaborate, setting in action Minerva and Venus, the muses and the graces, satyrs and nymphs. The plot itself was almost always forced and fantastic; and the interest of the spec- tators was centred on the groups of dan- cers, who came on at intervals to sing and to caper in character. In the  Facheux  Moliere had shown how it was possible to get away from the frippery of mythology and to devise a genu- ine play, which would justify a succession of song-, and dances quite as well as the earlier and emptier schemes introducing gods and goddesses. In that comedy-bal- let, simple as it was, he had proved that a web of true comedy might be embroidered at will with the interludes of singing and dancing which characterized the ballet. The comedy-ballet, as Moliere thus pre- sented it, was less pretentious and less fa- tiguing than the earlier type with its exag- gerated grandiloquence; and it was more amusing because it contained within the spectacle what was after all a real play, how- ever slight this might be and however over- laden this might seem when distended by its extraneous terpsichorean accompaniments. Stripped of these needless accessories, the  Facheux  is but a single act. So is the first comedy-ballet, which Moliere devised for Louis XIV himself, the  'Manage Fone.  It is in one act, in prose; but it was first performed in January, 166.J, at the Louvre, with a variety of songs and dances, w hich expanded it to three acts. It was written for the King; it was produced before him; and it was also performed by him for he himscll appeared as a gypsy in one of the interludes. The plot has the needful simplicity; it turns on a single sug- gestion. presented from a variety of as- pects. Sganarelle, the same fixed type that Moliere had impersonated more than once before, is a man of fifty, and he is thinking of getting married. But he docs not know his own mind two minutes together. He consults a friend: he consults two philoso- Vol. XLV1I. 73 pliers,one after the other; he even consults a pair of gypsy girls; he hasadisquicting inter- view with hischosen bride, and lie overhears a still more disquieting interview between her and one of her admirers. Finally, he re- solves to break off the match; and thereupon thechosen bride s fat liersends him hergentle spoken brother, who insists either on a duel to the death or a marriage on the spot. And Sganarelle accepts immediate matrimony in preference to immediate mortality. This is the story of the playin one act; yet it lends itself to a host of other consultations and of other misadventures of Sganarelle, episodes of singing and dancing, which Moliere ingeniously scatters through the action, and which he could omit without loss when the play had to stand on its own merits. There is genuine comedy in the perplexities of Sganarelle: and there is rich humor in the two philosophers whom he seek'  to consult. The pedant with his mouth crammed with scholastic phrases was one of the accepted types of the com- edv-of-masks; but in the hands of the Ital- ians it presented only a caricature of ex- ternal characteristics. Moliere had had a solid training in philosophy himself; the vocabulary of the schools was perfectly fa- miliar to him; and here he turned it to humorous uses, caricaturing the essential qualities of the philosophy then going out of fashion. Having utilized what are really three of the fixed ty'pes of the comedy-of- masks, Moliere employed again its custom- ary and convenient scene, the open square, with the houses of four of the characters all on the stage together those of the two philosophers, that of the bride, and that of Sganarelle himself. As usual, the acting took place in the neutral ground between the houses, very much as it had done in the  Ecole des Femmes.  This summary outline serves to show that the   Mariage Force  is not one of Moliere s more important plays; but it will serve as a specimen of the comedy-ballet which he was often called upon to impro- vise at the King s command. II  The I jest title of Louis XIV to the recollection of posterity is the protection he extended to Moliere,   so Mr. John Lord  Morley has declared;   and one reason why 734 Moliere and Louis XIV this was so meritorious is that Moliere s work had a markedly critical character, in refer- ence both to the devout and to the courtier. But Moliere is only critical by accident. There is nothing organically negative about him; and his plays are the pure dramatic presentation of a peculiar civilization.  The civilization that Moliere portrayed was peculiar partly because of the conditions which had prevailed in France during the infancy and youth of Louis XIV, and partly because of the personal character of the King himself. Francis I had already established the royal authority, breaking down the influ- ence of the feudal nobles in the provinces, and seeking to centre all power in Paris in the hands of the sovereign. Richelieu took up the work of Francis 1 and made ready to substitute autocracy for mere monarchy. He overrode violently all laws and all cus- toms which might in any way limit the might of the monarch. So thoroughly did he consolidate the kingly power that it sur- vived the weak rule of Mazarin, marred by the petty bickerings and murderous in- triguings of the Fronde. Louis XIV lived through the Fronde; and suffered from it and was humiliated by it. What he wasthen forced to see intensified his resolve that he himself, when he took the government, should be supreme, with no one to gainsay his royal will. He meant to be the focus of everything; to hold all command in his own control: to let no one shine except by re- flected light from the throne; to be the centre of the solar system. It was as though he had taken to heart the saying set him as a copy for his boyish wriling-lessons:   Homage is due to kings; and they may do whatever they choose.  The reign of Louis XIV, like the reign of Solomon, began magnificently; and both kings, the Frenchman and the Hebrew, survived to see the failure of their rule, the misery of their people, and the pitiful di- minishing of their glory. There were not a few great men in France, while Louis XIV sat on the throne; but the King him- self was not one of them. He was not a man of much more than ordinary ability, although he was not without a certain sly cleverness. He had a shrewdness of his own; he had abundant taste; he had the knack of saying the right word at the right time; he was wise enough never to uncover his immense ignorance, the result of his neglected education. He was as lacking in depth of understanding and in breadth of outlook as he was in solidity of knowledge. His dominant characteristics were pride and selfishness; and they united to give him a monstrous egotism, even surpassing that of Napoleon, without being sustained by the soaring imagination and the superb energy of the Corsican adventurer. He was supremely proud and also super- latively vain, although in most men who arc proud the larger vice inhibits the pettier. He erected statues to himself in hisown life- time; and he did not allow any statues to be erected during his reign to any of his pred- ecessors. He created Versailles, where he was free from all comparison with the past splendor of France, and where he caused to lie strewn broadcast throughout the decora- tions. his own boastful emblem, the sun, and his vainglorious motto, declaring that he had   no equal among many I  At Ver- sailles, which he had created, he saw only his own creatures, the courtiers who hung on his nod and who prostrated themselves at his beck. He was jealous of the ablest of his ministers, Colbert and Louvois, at times treating them harshly, while he was more affable toward their feebler successors who had no will of their own, and whom he preferred because he believed that he had trained them himself. He was ever greedy of flattery, although not so insatiable in his youth as he became in his old age, when the only way to the royal favor was by grovel- ling servility. Vet even when he had just ascended to the throne he was always ex- pecting a compliment, almost demanding fulsome eulogy, and never declining it, however gross or abject it might be. He took himself so seriously that this incense seemed to him only what was due to him. He was so well pleased with it that he seems never to have despised those who proffered it. His selfishness was appalling. In all France he cared for no one and for nothing but himself and hisown pride. In public affairs he held himself above all law, over- riding every other authority in the state without scruple or hesitation. In his private life he disdained to be bound by any code of morality or even of decency. In his youth he was an ardent sensualist; and in his old age he naturally became a narrow- Moliere and Louis XIV' 735 minded Ingot. He Haunted his amorous intrigues, sometimes two or three at once, in the face of the Queen, in the eyes of the whole court, anti even before the   e  ple of France, lie punished severely the lady in charge who sought to prevent his having access by night to the apartments of the Queen s maids of honor. He legitimated his bastards, even those he had by Mme. de Montespan, the children of a double adultery, which he thus forced on the gaze of the world. He had no consideration for the fatigue or the health even of those whom he cherished, his intimates, his own family. He had no regret, no kindly feeling, no gentle word for the vanquished or for those who no longer pleased him. His own per- sonal caprice was his sole law. What his sluggish mind and his arid soul most delighted in was the empty ceremonial of Versailles. He found unfailing pleasure in the pettiness of it all. He enjoyed the routine of royalty; and in the incessant di rection of all its details he was as hard- working as he was hard-hearted. He was glad to submit himself to rigorous slavery of the prescril ed etiquette and he subjected all the nobility to it, enforcing their attendance upon his   erson, to the neglect of their estates and the min of their fortunes. He did everything in public, the cynosure of an adoring group of courtiers. He got out of l ed and washed his hands and put on his shirt while a throng of nobles tilled his bed- room. Every day had its regulated duties and every hour had its prescril: ed occupa- tions. Life at Versailles was monotonous and senile; and the sole relief for the empti- ness of this parade was the'spectacle of en- vious rivalry for the favor of the sovereign. The King himself did not care if every- body was uncomfortably lodged in the ill- planned and unhealthy palace; he was him- self in reality little better off than they were. The outward show with its gaudiness grati- fied him daily and hourly, so that he gave no thought to the discomfort, the dirt, and the ever-present possibility of disease. He had no more regard for the convenience or the health of the courtiers whose presence in the palace was due to hisdirect command, than he had for the well-being of the popu- lace of the kingdom, crushed beneath the taxes constantly increasing to pay for the palace, for the support of the courtiers, for the lavish wastefulness of the royal exist- ence, and for the indefensible wars to which he was urged by his pitiful avidity for mis- taken glory. In the beginning of his reign lie gave France what it most needed, order and sta- bility and unity, that it had never had be- fore. Toward the end lie laid waste the Palatinate; he ordered ruthless religious persecutions executed by brutal dragoons; ami he revoked the Edict of Nantes, which broke up countless homes, sowed discord in countless families, drove out of the kingdom hundreds of thousands of most useful and orderly citizens; and by so doing he deprived France of a most precious ele- ment in its population, an element that might have wisely guided the Revolution which his selfish rule made inevitable. Louis XIV was the perfect embodiment of the King by divine right. In him we see this autocratic principle reduced to the absurd, lie acted selfishly always, seeking glory in useless war and in ostentatious living; and he never felt any obligation to consider the cost of this glory, such as it was. He has been acclaimed as a great king; but as- suredly it is only as a king that he is great. He was despicable in the meanness of his ambition and he was contemptible in the intensity of his selfishness. Behind all his grandeur his essential   ttiness stands forth. Ill If Louis XIV was the King whose char- acter has been summarily indicated in the previous paragraphs and if Moliere was the man whose character is known to all the world, how was it possible that they should ever have worked together, that the play- wright should have pleased the sovereign, and that the monarch should have sustained the dramatist  The question must needs be put, and it is not easy to answer. First of all, must it be noted that Moliere saw the King only in the earlier years of his reign before the worst characteristics of the ruler had had time to   c declared or even to be developed. W hen Moliere died the King was only thirty-five; and it was after Moliere's death that the royal selfishness stiffened into habit. The defects of the King s character and the appalling results of these defects were scarcely visible during Moliere s lifetime. Moliere shared with his contemporaries an inherited regard and 73 3 Moliere and Louis XIV admiration for the kings of France. He had seen the meanness and the miser   of the I'ronde; and he was glad to behold the reins of government firmly held by a strong hand. In the beginning of the young king s rule there was peace and prosperity in the land; and the monarch got the credit even if Colbert had done the work. There was a general gladness in the air; and the buoy- ancy of hope. Moliere, like the rest of his   ountrymen, was captivated by the glamour of Louis XI Vs youthful grace. Then Moliere was a burgher of Paris, with no Jove for the arrogant nobles; and he was gratified to see the King take power from them and keep it for himself. This action of the sovereign, while it might raise him to a still loftier position, tended toward a juster equality among his subjects. Mo- liere was no republican; he was no precursor of the Revolution; lie was no advanced thinker; he had no aptitude for political speculation; he accepted the framework of government as he found it, glad that the King gave to the country the internal peace it sorely needed. Moliere was no syco- phant; he had manly self-respect; but he was his own contemporary, after all; and like his contemporaries in France, he unliesi- tatingly accepted the inequalities of society as he found them. There is no reason to suppose that he perceived the emptiness of rank and the danger that comes from the existence of privileged classes. He had no respect for place in itself, for the foolish courtier, for the dissolute noble; and he took every occasion to laugh at the one and to hold the other up to scorn, pleased that the King permitted this. For the rest, for the system of caste, for the autocracy of the monarch, he cared little, accepting a state of things which must have seemed to him natural. Furthermore, Moliere had a hereditary appointment in the King s household. Chaucer was a   valet of the King s cham- ber  to Edward Til; and Moliere had the humbler post of one of the va cts de chamhrc tapissicrs du roi to Louis XIY. This ap- pointment gave him a   crsonal relation to the sovereign; it imposed on him the occa- sional task of making the King s bed; it may even account in some measure for the protection now and again extended to him by the monarch, whose pride led him to look with favor on all those attached to his own person. For this protection, however, it is easy to find other reasons. The King in his youth was very fond of the theatre; and Moliere brought back to Paris a type of broadly humorous play, which the mon- arch greatly relished. This accounts for the bestowal,first of the Petit-Bourbon, and secondly of the Palais Royal. Later, as Moliere grew in stature as a comic drama- tist and began to put more of the realities of life into his comedies, the King found him- self provided with a new form of pleasure. The records show that Louis XIV, as might have been expected, preferred com- edy to tragedy; and in acting comedy Mu- litre s company was far superior to the rival organizations. This, in itself, was a reason why the King should afterward take the company under his own patronage. This would explain the King s suggestion of a new character to be added to the  Fa- cheux ; and also his commanding Molifcre to retort on his enemies with the  Im- promptu de Versailles.  Probably Louis XIV , entrenched in his own pride, found pleasure in Moliere s ex- posure of the predeuse and of the marquis ami of the falsely devout. Probably again, the sovereign was so secure in his suprem- acy that he felt no fear of any social disin- tegration, such as would have influenced a usurper like Napoleon, who declared at St. Helena that he would never have permitted the first performance of  Tartuffe.  Un- der Napoleon TartutTe  would have been suppressed and its author exiled; and under Louis XIV it was performed and its author rewarded. This much must lx  set down to the credit of Louis XIV. That the King really saw and felt the purport of that play is very unlikely; and it is slill more unlikely that he ever suspected its author to Ix; more than a clever contriver of comic plays. Moliere was manly always, and never ser- vile; but when he was in the presence of the King he knew his place and kept it. Not for nothing had he cultivated his insight into human nature; and we may be sure that he had formed a pretty shrewd guess as to the best way to win the regard of the sov- ereign and to gain the royal support for the bolder comedy he had resolved to write. I he most open road to the young King s good will was to minister to his pleasures; and it was along this road that Moliere advanced. He was prompt to obey the Moliere and Louis XIV King s wishes and to anticipate the King s desires. However important the work on which he might be engaged, he was always ready to lay it aside to devise the kind of play that the King wanted, comedy-ballet or spectacle, as the case might be. What- ever the inconvenience to himself, the in- sufficiency of lime, the haste with which he had to full'd his task, he never hesitated and he never complained. Whatever the King had commanded was executed at once by Molicre as best he could. Swift obedience was a quality Louis XIV could well ap- preciate as he could also the inventive fertility that Molicre revealed in the suc- cession of plays written to order. It is no wonder that the King was willing to do what he could for a servant of his pleasures, who met his wishes at once. To say this is not to say Louis XIV overlooked the dilTer- c-nce of rank any more than Moliere for- got it. There is a pretty anecdotc setting forth the King s discovery that Moliere was once breakfast css because his fellow valets      chambre refused to eat with an actor and narrating the monarch's magnanimity in thereupon inviting the dramatist lo join him in his own royal meal. It i   a picturesque legend illustrated in paintings by Ingres and G rome. But it is quite impossible to believe without surrendering all we know about the inevitable etiquette and the invincible ceremonial of the court,and with- out denying the haughty arrogance of the sovereign who was served alone, and who did not allow even the princes of the blood to sit at meat with him. It could not have happened; but if it had happened, the re- port of an event so monstrous would have reverberated through all the abundant let- ters and journals of the time. As the case stands, the simple story first emerges a cen- tury and a half after Moliere s death; and it appears then in a memoir of slight his- toric validity, wherein it is credited to the doubtful recollection of an unnamed phy- sician. There are two other anecdotes, of which one at least is more solidly authenticated, and which reveal more clearly the King s opinion of the dramatist. Grimarest, Moliere s second biographer, to whom we arc more indebted than ninny later schol- ars have been willing to admit, and who displayed a desire to collect all the infor- mation accessible Grimarest, writing in 1705, declared that  within the year the King had occasion to say that there were two men he could never replace, Moliere and Lulli.  Now Lulli was a wily Floren- tine, who composed the music for the court - ballets, and who also shone as a buffoon, evoking spontaneous laughter by his antics. Grimarest would not have dared to publish this in the King s lifetime, if he had not be- lieved it to be true. And it sounds highly probable, for it confirms the belief that Louis XIV saw in Moliere, not so much the supreme comic dramatist, as the deviser of court ballets, the adroit minister to royal amusement. The other anecdote is to be found in the life of Racine, written by his son. The as- sertion is there made that Louis XlVonct asked Boileau who was the rarest of the great writers that had given glory to France during his reign, and that Boileau at once named Moliere. To which the King re- plied,    I should not have thought it," add- ing with the gracious condescension he seems often to have shown to Boileau   but you know more about these things than I do.  Probably it had never before struck him that Moliere was either a great writer or a rare genius, since he had always regarded from a very different point of view the dramatist who was also an actor. "Grandpaw, why wasn't you to the war " THE RETREAT FROM CxETTYSBURG By Nelson Lloyd Il.I.USTJtA'l'lONS UY J. CONACHKR RANDPAW, why wasn t you to the war " It was the hundredth time little Myron had asked the question, and having replied a hundred times to the satisfaction of any fair-minded person, Amos Killiwil  felt justified in answering it now with a look of reproach. But it was hurled at him as he stood conspicuous in the dusty-brown clothes of peace amid the warlike blue of the Grand Army, and the eyes bent on him from l encath the brims of many slouch hats seemed to demand a reply. lie had to tell again the story which he had been hurling from the housetops these thirty years how lie had wanted to go, but bis brother Bert had stolen a march and slipped away in the niglu, leaving him to care for their old parents; how Bert had been killed at Gettysburg. But these were not fair minds that he addressed, and the more he descanted on Bert s heroic service the broader were the smiles greeting him on every hand. Then the question was put to him by Mrs. Cridlc, and it came with a double cut, for her son was only playing the cymbals in the band, yet as she asked it she looked the picture of the Spartan mother, from the exalted height of the top step regarding him contemptuously as he sat among the women and the children watching the parade. He was with the -. i The Retreat from Gettysburg 739 women and the children when the Rev. Mr. Hike, from an impregnable position on the rostrum, hurled his volley of reproaches at the craven souls who had clung to secur- ity and plenty when their brothers were fighting for their country, and it seemed that the rolling periods and disdainful glances of the orator of the day were aimed at him. He lied. Only when in his own home did he feel safe from contemptuous eyes, from curling lips and shrugging shoulders. But even here the music of the band penetrated and set his blood to tin- gling, and the roar of the post cannon made his heart leap. The spirit of the boy does not die in the man. It needs but martial music and the crash of guns to arouse it. And in Mr. Killiwill s soul the boy was stirred to lusty life. He longed to step with the drum-beat, to have a hand on the Cannon s rope, to take a man s part at the camp-fire. But he had stayed at home  He had no place in the village that day  not even for Bert s sake. He would go away and stay away till the storm of war had passed over the valley. He would go to Gettysburg, for there, if anywhere, there where Bert had died, he would be treated with some distinction. And he longed for a little distinction. He had never tasted of it, but it was enough that he had seen his friends feasting on it, as in the pride of their blue and brass they marched and countermarched through the village street. Distinction came quicker to Mr. Killi- will than he had expected, and in a degree beyond his dreams. Yet he reaped only what he had sowed, for when a man plants a soldier cap upon his head and boards a train for Gettysburg it is to be presumed that he is a veteran returning to the scenes of his prowess. No one would dream of asking him why he had not gone to the war. And this was the very reason why Mr. Killiwill was wearing Bert s old cap, the one precious relic of his brother s soldier life. He had no purpose to sail under false colors. He was going as a Christian dog would go, in a Mussulman's garb, to penetrate the mysteries of Mecca. This innocent disguise would allow him to wander unharried among the monuments; he could stand in peace on the spot where Bert had died and it would be as though Bert s spirit were protecting him from con- temptuous inquisition. But though his first intention was innocent enough, he began to feel a guilty pride when he noticed the side- long glances of respect which were aimed at him. Then the conductor addressed him as  captain,  and he accepted the honor as the easiest thing to do, yet unconsciously he sat more erect and looked out more fiercely from beneath the battered visor. That a real veteran, a man in the Grand Army uniform, should halt in the aisle beneath the flickering light of the lamp and stare at him, was not surprising, but it was surprising that the stranger should sud- denly grasp a seat for support, and then when strength had returned to his shaking knees should lice to the end of the car. There he made a feint at drinking at the water-cooler, but Mr. Killiwill saw' that over the lop of the glass he was being furtively watched. He turned to the win- dow as though something in the gathering darkness without held his attention, but all the while he kept the corner of one eye in- tent on what was happening within. With quick steps that told of a sudden resolution made at immense cost to nerves, the stran- ger came down the aisle, stopped at his side, and leaning over touched him fearfully on the shoulder.   Bert   he exclaimed, recoiling when his finger met solid substance. Mr. Killiwill started. It was his turn to lie frightened, and he shrank into his comer. The unerring first impulse was for honesty, but it was not easy to explain to this gallant veteran why he had not gone to war, and still more difficult why he was masquerad- ing in his brother s soldier cap.   Bert Killiwill,  the veteran said again in thick voice,  I thought you were dead; I could  most have swore you were, yet who could forget that pecul ar cast of the eye  When I saw you looking out of the window and at me all at oncet, I said to myself,   It s him I m sure it is him.   Hard though Mr. Killiwill pressed against the side of the car, it would not open to let him escape, and the stranger cut off all way of retreat by dropping into the seat l eside him and placing a hand on his knee, pinching it hard to make sure that it was llesh and bone.   Don t you mind Hatcher Hencry Hat- cher   he asked.   No.  Mr. Killiwili s voice trembled as he spoke.   I don t remember anything.  740 The Retreat from Gettysburg   Where have you been all these years   demanded Mr. Ilatchcr, squeezing his knee till he winced.   How did it come you wasn t killed at Gettysburg after all  You don't wonder I t     k you for a ghost first off, do you  Can't you remember anything  Think a bit you mind Hatcher Henery Iiatcher, your old tent-mate   This bombardment of questions demantl- ed an answer. Mr. Killiwill realized that lie could extricate himself from his un- pleasant position by telling the truth, but the tnith entailed a humiliating confession, so he had recourse to cunning. He played for time, fleeing to the refuge of tobacco, that boon companion of procrastination, and while he Idled his pipe, and lighted it, and puffed it into soothing life, he settled on a line of action. Mr. Hatcher could not keep him a prisoner forever in the comer of this seat, and if he allowed him to persist for a few hours in his mistake the moment must come when he could quietly abandon the unsought company. For the present there was a certain delight in sitting this way, smoking, journeying with so pleasant a companion, a man marked above the common herd by his blue 3nd brass.   l don t mind much about the war, Henery,  said Mr. Killiwill softly.   I have heard tell that I was killed, but, of course, that s not so. I do remember that 1 was hit here.  He tapped his forehead.  The next I knew I was home, and there I've been till to-day, when I felt kind of an on- resistable desire to go back to the old bat- tlefield. Now, tell me all about yourself. Mcbbe you ll help my memory.  Mr. Hatcher was not to be side-tracked so easily, for the return of Bert Killiwill to life was a remarkable event and not one to be passed over lightly.  The boys will Ix- surprised," he cried, slapping his companion heartily on the shoulder.   You'll give  em a shock, sure. They'll all be at the reunion all that s left of the old regiment Ballinger, the colonel, and our captain of course you remember them, Bert      I was hit here,  Mr. Killiwill said, tap- ping his head again, lie could not tight back the smile which came to his face as he thought of the boys and the surprise in store for them. To Mr. Hatcher this was only evidence of a disordered condition of mind, such as might be expected in one who had been struck on the head with the butt of a musket in the heat of battle. " I understand, Bert,  he said kindly.  You mustn't bother about things too much, for it might upset you more. Meb- be seeing familiar faces will bring back your memory gradual.  He moved toward the end of the scat, and half turned, so that from the vantage of distance he could fix a more earnest eye on his comrade s face. His brow was fur- rowed; he seemed to lie concentrating all his own mental force on awakening the sluggish consciousness of his old friend.  Bert, there is something I want to ask you,  lie said in a deep, measured tone, a voice so ominous that Mr. Killiwill started.  There is one you remember, now isn t there one     One.-'  exclaimed Mr. Killiwill, meeting the solemn gaze with frightened eyes.

Mr. Killiwill shrank back into the cor- ner, tapping his forehead again and again. " I was hit here,  he said. He was lie- ginning to think that he really was Bert and had suffered a blow from a musket, so sure was Mr. Hatcher of it and so masterful in his treatment of his unfortunate com- rade.  Think of one,  commanded the veter- an,  of one you d rather see than anybody else on earth.  He passed his hands before his com- panion s eyes, but this hypnotic gesture was to Mr. Killiwill a threat of violence and he edged further away.  What are you talking about   he said hoarsely, raising his arms to protect him- self.  I am referring to   Mr. Hatcher stopped. For a moment he studied Mr. Killiwill s face, to find in the anxious, re- proachful look there but further evidence of mental weakness.   I won t tell you now, Bert,  he went on in a lone of caress.   Shocks are bad in such cases and we must bring you back easy-like.  His kindly demeanor restored Mr. Killi- will s courage and with a show of some spirit he demanded,  ' Now, who are you referring to     But the veteran shook his head.  Not now,  he said.   I'm afraid of upsetting you. It s enough that we have you back- even as you are- -and it s mighty glad the boys will l e to see you living instead of in a soldier s grave. You are in my charge now. comrade, and to-night we ll be tenting once more on the old camp ground, which is to say at the boarding-house where my folks are staving.  The mysterious reference to the one whom, above all others, he wished to see had made Mr. Killiwill very uneasy, and he was now tixed in his intention not to leave the train at Gettysburg at all, but to let it carry him on, out of the clutches of this kind-hearted comrade who had taken possession of him. But circumstances con- 741 742 The Retreat from Gettysburg spired against him, and when  he train was slowing down, the conductor called the last stop. Gettysburg, and Mr. Hatcher con- fiscated his little hand-bag. There was nothing left f"r him but to surrender for the time and to trust for the evening to open a way of escape. So he followed his com- panion with trepidation, for back of all the kindness, the gentle grip on the arm, the soothing modulation of the voice, he was beginning to suspect some deep-laid mo- tive. He could face his own past without fear, for it was as clean as an unused slate, but of Bert s he was not so confident, and it was into Bert s that he was being carried. His fear of that past grew deeper when Mr. Hatcher stopped suddenly beneath a flick- ering street-lamp and again began those mysterious passes before his eyes, saying in solemn tones as he waved his hands,  Think think can t you remember the one     I don t remember anything, Henery. I was hit here,  cried Mr. Killiwill fran- tically. Fearing to overturn by emotion the al- ready tilting senses of his comrade, Mr. Hatcher desisted and led the way on in silencc. But once in the boarding-house the soft smile which had been playing about his lips began to spread; it caught his eyes and they beamed on Mr. Killiwill; it caught his hands and they rubbed them- selves together with a soft, unctuous sound; it caught his feet and they did little jig- steps about the narrow hall.  Henery   cried the astonished Mr. Killiwill.  Ssh   whispered Mr. Hatcher raising a finger in warning.  Now open your mouth and shut your eyes and I'll give you a great, big. big surprise.  With one hand he seized the door-knob and with the other he caught Mr. Killiwill by the shoulder and pushed him violently into the parlor. In a rocking-chair, beneath a lamp, read- ing, sat a woman. The commotion made by Mr. Killiwill on his sudden entrance brought her to her feet. The sight of him sent her down into the chair again and she lay back staring at him. Then she began to tremble so violently that all her long curls got a-going and "her hands sh x k as she lifted them to her eyes to adjust her spectacles.   Well, ma am,  said Mr. Killiwill with an apologetic cough. At the sound of his voice she clutched the string of pink corals which hung from her throat and began twisting them as though she would end her life by strangling.   I hope 1 didn t startle you, ma am,  said Mr. Killiwill, a little louder. She rose slowly from her chair.  Bert   she cried.  My Bert, back from the grave   Mr. Killiwill groaned. Only the truth could save him now, and it was on his lips, but when he raised his hands to make his solemn avowal, his brother s old soldier cap rose before his eyes with them, a thing to be explained, and explained, to humiliate him. He clapped it on his head to get it out of his sight, backed toward the door and laid a hand on the knob, only to find that it would not turn. He edged toward the window, hoping to discover there a means of egress, however undigni- fied, but even in this he was checked, this time by a woman s hands.   You are real,  she cried joyfully, as her fingers closed on his arm.   Oh, Bert, don t you remember me limily Hatcher  your Emily    No, 1 don t,  snapped Mr. Killiwill, striving to push her away from him gently.   I don t remember anything.  But she would not lx- denied. With a sob she clasped her hands behind his neck and suddenly became limp, so that Mr. Hatcher, projecting his head into the room at this juncture, thought it wise to leave the happily united pair alone. Though he closed the door softly, the click of the latch did not escape the quick ear of Mr. Killi- will.   Henery old comrade," hecalledplead- ingly.   I thought she'd bring your memory back,  cried Mr. Hatcher, as he answered the summons and advanced toward the pair with arms upraised in fraternal bene- diction.   1 thought that when the sight of the one you loved best on earth burst upon your eyes the whole past would open up like.

With that he darted out of the room, and the banging of the front door and the rapid footfalls on the pavement promised the quick coming of the comrades. So con- fused was Mr. Killiwill that he was hardly aware of what was passing, and when at last the quiet of the place and the soothing tones of Miss Hatcher s voice stilled the turmoil of his brain, he was surprised to could he when she nestled against him so naturally and her very curls seemed to claim his shoulder as their birthright  He glanced down at her stealthily. It was many years since he had looked this way into a woman s face, and the prospect pleased his eyes though it was somewhat autumnal. His anger fled, for after all the present was not unpleasant, and while he sat up very straight, staring at the ceiling and seemed to disclaim any connection with the imprisoned arm, he remained passive    It s so good to have you here again,  Miss Hatcher said, and he saw that it was only kind to return the pressure of her 744 The Retreat from Gettysburg hand,  You know I never, never could believe that you were killed.

And that was a good deal, Herbert, for Mr. Pettingbird was the lead- ing druggist in Carlisle. Wouldn't it have been awful if you d have come back and found me Mrs. Pettingbird    Miss Hatch- er shuddered.  Pettingbird, old Pettingbird   cried Mr. Killiwill, as though the leaven of mirth was in the very memory of his discomfited rival. This time the pressure originated in his hand, for he had begun to feel that Miss Hatcher s sufferings and sacrifices had placed his family in her debt, and he alone was left to repay her.  Mr. Pettingbird had almost won me,  Miss Hatcher went on softly, looking away from him.  Then you came home with Henry on furlough and after that all his wealth couldn t tempt me.    Pettingbird old Pettingbird   repeat- ed Mr. Killiwill. Miss Hatcher looked up sharply.   You remember him and yet you don't remember me,  she said in a tone of chiding.   You ve changed so litile that it seems only yester- day that we parted. Can t you mind one tiny little thing of it all. Bert    A little.  replied Mr. Killiwill, for he was not a man to make a woman unhappy by his coldness.  What   she asked, seizing his free hand and holding him completely captive. Mr. Killiwill coughed.  There was the  the it s gone from my mind. My mem- ory is so jumpy.   The night we walked by the mill- dam,  prompted Miss Hatcher.  You told me-  She looked up at him. He knew what he must have said under such circum- stances, but he could see no reason for repeating what she had known for thirty years, and was silent, his feet seeming to hold all his attention and to require pro- found study.  What was it you told me   she asked softly.   Well,  he replied,   I guess I must have said that I favored you.   That you loved me,  she corrected.   Yes, mebbe I said that,  he returned, pulling at an ear as though it troubled him.  And do you still wear that lock of my hair   she said.  Now that you mention it,  he replied with shameless assurance,   I do mind com- ing across it in one of my pockets and 1 couldn't think where I got it; so I gave it to Myron.   Myron  Who s Myron   inquired Miss Hatcher.   He s my grand   Mr. Killiwill caught himself just In time.   My grandnephcw  my brother Amos s son s boy,  he added quickly.   I can t remember much, but I guess you ll find that on the main points I m all right.  His incautious reference to his grand- son warned Mr. Killiwill that though his present situation was delightful enough it was fraught with danger to him. In this exchange of tender nothings he was fritter- ing away precious moments, for Mr. Hatch- er would soon be upon him with a sufficient force of comrades to guard him. If ever, this was his time to escape, for beguiled by his increasingly tender glances, Miss Hatcher had relaxed her vigilance and al- lowed her hand to lie passively in his. Hardly breathing lest a tremor betray him, he withdrew his arm, as gently as though she were made of spun glass, and once free, rose hurriedly. She tried to follow, but he pushed her back with gentle insistence.  No, Emily,  he said in his softest tone,  you are too tired too overcome by this happy meeting. Rest here while I run down to the hotel and gel supper, for I ve had nothing since noon but an apple.    You might forget me again,  she ex- claimed, struggling to rise. Mr. Killiwill avoided the outstretched hands and made a dash for the door, only to run into the arms of Mr. Hatcher and a great company of veterans- With a cheer they swept him back into the room. They all knew him. It mattered little that he did not know them, for they understood, and the mental infirmity he suffered for his country' only made him doubly dear to them. So happy were they over his miraculous escape and his return, and so considerate of his peculiar mental state, that there was little for Mr. Killiwill to do but to receive The Retreat from Gettysburg 745 their felicitations in embarrassed silence. When he tried tospeak their voicesdrowned his. If he raised a hand in protest, some- one seized it and shook it. When he strug- gled free from the grasp of Comrade Sim- mons it was only to fall into the arms of Comrade Pitcher. Bewildered by this bois- terous reception, he forgot Miss Hatcher s existence, for the press of old soldiers about him had shut her from his view. Her brother brought her back to him, and the wild hope he had cherished that once the first enthusiasm over him had subsided he might find a way of escape, was crushed. Mr. Hatcher, rapping on the table for order, seemed to be beating that hope into frag- ments, and then to scatter them to the winds as he waved his arms. Mr. Killiwill had come to regard Mr. Hatcher wflh im- measurable awe. The veteran s every smile seemed to augur evil, and as he was being smiled on now more l enignly than ever, icy thrills of fear shot through him.   Now, boys, I ve a happy announcement to make,  said Mr. Hatcher when he had stilled the tumult.  Two hearts   He gave a meaning glance, first at his sister and then at Mr. Killiwill, who was trying to say something but was unable to form the words.  Two hearts which for thirty years have been separated will begin beating as one to-morrow.  Mr. KilliwiU s hands were stretched toward him in mule appeal, but he did not see them.   We are fortu- nate to have with us our chaplain, Mr. Young, who will perform the ceremony at ten in the morning, and so you are all invited to be present at a regular military wedding.  Mr. Hatcher gave no names. His glances told the story, and half of the company rushed to congratulate his sister, while the others crowded about Mr. Killiwill. He was making furious gestures of protest, but Mr. Hatcher would not listen to him.    Don t worry, Bert,  he said kindly,  we will have a committee to attend to everything.    But it s kind of sudden,  pleaded Mr. Killiwill.  Sudden   cried Mr. Hatcher.  Have- n t you two been waiting for thirty years  Sudden  Huh    Well, s'pose wc say next day instead of to-morrow,  said Mr. Killiwill in a shaking voice.   Most of the boys will be gone then,  snapped Mr. Hatcher.  They mustn t l e disappointed, and they ve set their hearts on a military wedding.  A score of voices were raised in approval. Seeing thal his request for delay had no popular support, Mr. Killiwill had recourse to what flashed to him as the most con- vincing of arguments. Catching Mr. Hatcher by the sleeve, he whispered in his ear,   But, Henery, I ve nothing saved up.  Mr. Hatcher waved this potent argument aside as though it were a child s.  It's like you to think of that, Bert, but you mustn t let it bother you. Emily has lots--three hundred dollars a year, besides a half inler- est in a Pennsylvania Railroad bond.  Mr. Killiwill s hands fell and he drew a long breath. In a flash the storm-clouds parted and he basked in the brightest of sunshine. Looking at Miss Hatcher now, he wondered how he could ever have been so cold to such a woman. How fortunate that his stupid blundering had not lost her to him forever  It was clear that his trip to Gettysburg had been providential; that no mere chance could have led him here. He had been called, not lo enjoy Bert s honors, but to care for and protect this lovely woman who had given her whole life to his brother; who had refused Mr. Pet- tingbird and riches and had clung to the memory of her soldier. His duty was plain. Did he reveal the truth as to him- self, she might in a moment of anger upset this heaven-made plan for her happiness, and while he could not long persist in his equivocal course, it would be wrong to explain too soon the mistake as to his identity.  Well, if you insist, Henerv,'  lie said smiling.   But 1 thought you had otter to know.    It s the happiest day of my life,  cried Mr. Hatcher, shaking his hand.  And to-morrow is none too soon,  said Mr. Killiwill, beginning to edge his way through the crowd toward Miss Hatcher.   Emily,  he called in a voice of possession. He coughed. With a tremendous effort he called again,  Emily, my dear   He stopped suddenly, seeing a large, bearded man in uniform, a new-comer, standing on the threshold siaring at him, open-mouthed and open-eyed.  Who is that, Ilenerv   he asked, dig-  The Retreat from Gettysburg 747 ging his fingers into his hair as though to turn up the buried past.  I ve seen him some eres before. I m sure I have.    Why. it s Plummer, William Plummer," cried Mr. Hatcher.  Of course you re- member him, Bert. He slept in our tent.    William Plummer,  exclaimed Mr. Kil- liwill, opening his arms.  It s him  It s Bert   Mr. Killiwill found himself in a giant s embrace.   I didn t believe it at first, but it is him.  "William William,  Mr. Killiwill mur- mured, as though overcome with this meet ing with his old comrade.  And they told me you couldn t remem- ber anything,  said Air. Plummer.   But you do rememlnrr me don t you, Bert     Some,  was the guarded reply. The path of duty was so clear now.   You know I was hit on the head, and i  kind of infected my memory, but it's coming back gradual.  Over his shoulder he smiled at Miss Hatcher, and she answered him by shaking her curls.   He remembers those as were very dear to him, Mr. Plummer,  she said, and then turned away to hide her confusion.   Of course,  said Mr. Plummer, holding his comrade at arm's length and drinking full of the refreshing sight   f him.  My, but it s good to see you after all these years.   And it s nice to see you, William,  re- turned Mr. Killiwill.  And,  said Mr. Plummer, now pitching his voice very low, that its solemn tones might drive every word deep into the clouded memory,   there is one-  Mr. Killiwill seized Mr. Plummer by the lapel of his coat. " Don t ssh    he whis- pered hoarsely.   Who is longing to see you, Bert,  Mr. Plummer went on, lifting Sir. Killiwill off his feet and holding him at safe distance.  I must have visited you on furlough,  faltered Mr. Killiwill, casting a helpless, frightened look about him.  Why, he does remember,  cried Mr. Plummer in triumph. "Boys, he remem- bers.   Don't you think we d better talk these family matters in private, William     pleaded Mr. Killiwill.  Not a bit of it.  Mr. Plummer shook him to emphasize his refusal.  No one will rejoice more than our old comrades to see you two united. It s a real reunion we arc going to have. She s in town now, Bert, and she couldn t believe that what we heard was true.  It can t be true, William,  she says.  It can t be that after thirty years of waiting my Herbert has come back to me.  But he has. And, Bert, speaking as her brother who knows, I can tell you she's a jewel a perfcct jewel.    I know I know,  said Mr. Killiwill, struggling vainly to free himself.   But for special reasons I d rather nothing was said till I d seen her.   Seen her   Mr. Plummer folded his comrade in his arms to keep him from falling.   Why, Bert, she ll be here in five minutes. She only waited to fix up a bit.    What are you talking about, William    demanded Mr. Hatcher, taking Mr. Plum- mer's wrist and uncoiling his arm. Mr. Plummer beamed on the company.   I'm going to invite you all to a wedding  a regular military wedding, with the chap- lain and a band.    But I'm attending to that,  snapped Mr. Hatcher, drawing himself up with dignity, for he was evidently angry at this interference in what he deemed his family affairs. Mr. Plummer dropped Mr. Killiwill and confronted Mr. Hatcher with a frown.   You    he said, scornfully.   What right have you, Henery Hatcher, to be arranging about my sister's wedding plans which was settled thirty years ago   Mr. Killiwill, free at last from the loving clutch of the giant, looked at Miss Hatcher. Never had she seemed more lovely to him than at that moment as she stood, erect, her arms folded, her head up, gazing con- temptuously at William Plummer. It was hard to give her up, to give up the beauty and wealth which but a little while ago had seemed so secure for him, yet the door which admitted Mr. Plummer might at any instant give forth one more terrible than he, and were she twice as beautiful as Miss Hatcher and thrice as rich he dared not brave the storm he saw rising on the faces of those about him. Now its force was divided. Mr. Plummer was declaring that he knew Bert Killiwill too well to believe him so fickle, so untrue to his little Margaret. Mr. Hatcher was shaking his fist in Mr. Plummer s face and denouncing him for plotting to get possession of the finest man 748 The Retreat from Gettysburg who ever wore the blue and to ruin the life lights shone ahead and he heard the clang of one of the sweetest women in the world, of an engine s bell. He had thought that Miss Hatcher was proving herself a woman he must run the whole way home, and had of spirit and was loud in her assertion that resigned himself to that herculean exertion, she had trusted her soldier for thirty years but instinct had brought him back over the and would not desert him now. She was way he had come. The lights were mov- moving toward him with hands out- ing. It was a train, going where he stretched as she spoke, but he did not wait neither knew nor cared. Mr. Hatcher s for her. The door was open. With a sharp voice rang almost in his ear, angrily bound he reached it. Not even to seize his now, and it seemed that Plummer s arms precious hand-bag did he pause in the must be stretching out toward him.

Vol. XLVII. 74 THE PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT OF INLAND WATERWAYS By Samuel O. Dunn REMARKABLE agitation has I teen going on recently for additional development of inland waterways by the Federal Government. A project for the construction of a waterway fourteen feet deep, or more, from the Great Lakes to the Gulf   f Mex- ico, is receiving wide spread support. This main project is supplemented by numerous minor ones, including the deepening of the Mississippi to St. Paul and of its various tributaries and of other rivers in all parts of the country; the construction of a ship- canal to connect the lower end of Lake Michigan with Lake Erie; the construction of a ship-canal from Lake Erie lo the At- lantic Ocean, etc. To finance these great works it is proposed that Congress shall vote a bond issue of S500.000.000, which amount shall be spent at the rate of $50,- 000,000 annually until exhausted. The three principal arguments advanced for ihis plan arc  1  that it would cheapen transportation;  2  that it would regulate railway freight rates; and  3  that it would provide in ihc best practicable way needed additional facilities of transportation. These arguments arc pressed with great earnestness and confidence by the advo- cates of development of waterways. It is the purpose of this article to examine them in the light of experience in this country and elsewhere, and particularly with refer- ence to commercial and transportation 1 on- ditions in the United States. There are various im idental benefits besides those above referred to which it is contended waterway development would confer. It is not considered necessary, however, to no- tice them here; for if it can lie shown that development of waterways is desirable for transportation reasons, no citation of inci- dental l enefits it would confer is necessary to make out a case for it; and if the oppo- site can be shown, it must follow that the in- cidental benefits it would confer, such as the reclamation of overflowed land along 75  our rivers, should be sought by some less expensive means than the digging of four- teen or twenty foot channels. When it is said that the proposed works would cheapen transportation it is meant that they would provide means by which commodities could be carried at a lower cost than they can now or probably can in future be carried by railway. In supjiort of this contention the freight rates of boats on the ocean and Great Lakes, which are much less than those of the railways of the United States, are frequently cited. But this evidence is not pertinent. The most costly parts oi a railway s plant to build and maintain are its roadway and terminals; and the physical limitations they place on the size and capacity of the vehicles that can be used on them cause a large part of the expense of of erating railways. Nature provided for ocean and lake boats road- ways which have none of the physical limi- tations of a railway's roadway; and nature and governments provide and maintain the harbors which serve as their terminals. The case of artificial waterways, including under this designation both canals and im- proved rivers, is very different. Expendi- tures analogous to those for the construction and maintenance of a railway s roadway must be made on them; and the expenses of operation caused by the physical limita- tions of their channels are comparable to those caused bv the limitations of a rail- way s track. Now, of course, the real question to be considered is not the relative cheapness of transportation by rail and on natural waterways, but the relative cheap- ness of transmutation by rail and on arti- ficial waterways. Nor is the question whether transporta-  ion on artificial waterways can be made cheaper than on railways to the shipper the one properly to be considered, as is very commonly assumed. The true question is whether the total cost of transportation can be made less. The rates that shippers pay to the railways cover the total cost of rail The Proposed Development of Inland Waterways 751 carriage. The rates that shippers pay to Imats ordinarily cover only the cost ami profit of o  erating the boats. To arrive at the total cost of water transportation, to the charges of the  mats must l e added what the public expends on the waterways. It might be that the average rate by railway on commodities adapted to water trans- portation would be five mills per ton per mile, and by boat only four mills, and yet that, because of taxes paid by the public to defray interest and maintenance charges on the waterways amounting to two mills per ton per mile, the total cost of transportation by water would be greater than the cost by rail. Transportation would not then have been cheapened by waterway development. It would merely have been cheapened to the shipper. And it could have been cheapened equally to the shipper, with 50 per cent, less expense to the public, if the government, instead of developing water- ways, hail paid a bounty of one mill per ton- mile on shipments sent by rail equal in amount to those carried by water. We ran arrive at a rational opinion as to whether further development of rivers and canals in the United States would cheapen transportation here only by studying the past experience of this and other countries. Now, while the traffic of the  ireat Lakes and the railways of the United States has grown rapidly, that of most of the canals and rivers of this country has for some years declined. The commerce on all our inland waterways, except the  ireat Lakes, in 1889 was 40,600.000 tons; and in 1906. only 31,800.000 tons. The advocates of waterway development reply that the ca- nals and' rivers of the United States have not been able to hold their own because they have not been sufficiently developed and because the railways have used un- fair methods of competition. They call attention to the fact that while the traffic on our rivers and canals has been declining, the commerce on the rivers and canals of F.urope has been growing faster than on the railways of F.urope. The principal in land waterways of F.urope are those of Great Britain, Belgium, Germany, and France. The traffic carried on the water- ways of Great Britain has been declining. But the tonnage carried on the waterways of Belgium increased 115 per cent. I etwecn 1888 and 1905, while the tonnage on the railways increased only 62 per cent. The ton-miles of traffic carried on the water- ways of France increased 15.  per cent, be- tween 1880 and 1905, while the ton-miles of traffic on its railways increased only 72 per cent. The ton-miles of traffic on the water- ways of Germany increased 211 per cent, between 1885 and 1905, while the traffic on German railways increased only 168  jer cent. Data such as these, it is argued, show that wherever waterways arc projjcrly de- veloped and not subjected to unfair competi- tion they provide service and rales that attract most of the bulky commodities. But the more carefully rail and water transportation in F.urope ami in the United States are studied the more we shall be convinced that the experience of Europe affords no evidence, at least, that the total cost of canal or river transportation can be made less than the cost of rail transporta- tion in the United States. The British Royal Commission on Ca- nals and Waterways issued late in 1909 a comprehensive report of its investigation of the waterways of continental Euro  e. This, in conjunction with the re xirt on the pro- posed Lakes-to-the-Gulf Deep Waterway, issued a short time l efore by a board of United States army engineers, anil other United States Government re  orts, makes  jossible a tolerably up-to-date comparison of the more important waterways of F.u- rope, those of France and Germany, with those of the United States. The waterways of France which arc con- siderably used include about 4,500 miles of rivers and 3.000 miles of canals. The maximum depth which has been obtained on them is 8.5 feet, while most of the traffic is carried on water varying in depth from 1.5 to 5 feet. The largest estimate of the mileage of the waterways of Germany is 8.500 miles; the mileage on which the traffic is considerable is 6,200. The depth of the  free rivers  varies from 3 or 4 feet on those, such as the Oder, Elbe, and Vis- tula, which have unstable l eds, to 5 or 6 feet on those, such as the Rhine and Upper Main, which have stable beds; and on the lower sections of some of the larger rivers the maximum depths are 8 to 10 feet. The depths of the canalized rivers are 2.6 to 7.5 feet: and of the canals, t to 10 feet, the lat- ter being very rare, and 4 to 6 feet being most common. 752 The Proposed Development of Inland Waterways The United States Government had spent, u   to 1907, over S20S.000.000 on the improvement of the Mississippi Valley wa- terway system alone; and the Mississippi River now has in its lower section a mini- mum depth exceeding that of any river in Europe. During seasons of low water, boats having draughts of 25 to 30 feet can easily be taken from the Gulf of Mexico 270 miles to New Orleans, Baton Rouge, and Bayou Sara. Boats of a draught of 9 feet can always be taken from these points 840 miles to Cairo, 111.; boats of S feet, from Cairo to St. Louis, 182 miles; and boats of 4J feet, from St. Louis via the Mississippi and Illinois Rivers and the Illinois State Canal to Chicago, 365 miles. There is a channcl of at least 4J feet at low water  7 feet during 1907-S  from the mouth of the Illinois River 620 miles up the Mississippi to St. Paul, Minn.; and a channel of at least 4  feet up the Missouri River to Kan- sas City, and of 2J feet to Fort Benton, 2,285 miles from St. Louis. At mean stages of water there is a depth in the Ohio of 9 feet from Cairo, 111., to Pittsburg, 1,000 miles; and the Monongahela, a tributary of the Ohio, has a depth of 5 feet into the Pennsylvania coal fields. The Kanawha, another tributary of the Ohio, has a depth of 6 feet into the West Virginia coal fields. Other streams in the Mississippi River sys- tem which have channels as good as those of most of the navigated rivers of Europe include the Alleghany, Little Kanawha, Muskingum, Kentucky, Cumberland, Ten- nessee, St. Croix, Minnesota, Osage, Gas- conade, St. Francis, Yazoo, Arkansas, and Red. There are 295 navigable streams and 45 canals in this country, having an aggregate mileage of 28,600 miles; and of these, 40 streams, with a length of 2,600 miles, have a depth of ro feet; and 70. with a length of 3,200 miles, have a depth of 6 to to feet. Over 67 per cent, of the total water-borne commerce of Germany is carried on the Rhine and Elbe, yet these two rivers to- gether have only 617 miles of channel, with a depth of as much as 4   feet, which is the minimum depth on the present water- way of 1,657 miles from Chicago to New Orleans. We must look elsewhere than to the com- parative conditions of the waterways of Europe and of the United States for an ex- planation of the fact that while on the one commerce has grown, on the other it has de- clined. One explanation advanced is that municipalities and private corporations in European countries have provided excel- lent terminal facilities for lx ats at cities and large towns, and the concerns running water lines have develop'd types of tow- boats and barges which can be operated at the minimum cost, while in the United States there has been almost no improve- ment in river or canal boats or terminal facilities for thirty years. But the failure to provide good facilities in the United States has been the effect, not the cause, of the decline of the water traffic. They would have been provided by private enterprise had there been protits in sight to justify it. One reason, undoubtedly, why our wa- ter-borne traffic has not grown is that our principal waterway system, except the Great Lakes, viz., the Mississippi and its tributaries, is not so situated with reference to the main currents of commerce as to be able to command a large amount of traffic, no matter what rates may be made on it. In order that either a waterway or a rail- way may get traffic and actually cheapen transportation by carrying it, it is not enough that it should be willing and able to make low rates. It must also run in the same general direction as currents of com- merce large enough to atTord it a substantial business. The general direction in which commerce moves is determined by the eco- nomic law of supply and demand. People ship goods to make a profit; they can only make a pro tit by shipping them from where they are less valuable to where they are more valuable; and where they shall be less valuable or more valuable is determined, since the coming of the railway, mainly by conditions independent of the way in which waterways run. In this country, owing to historic and economic reasons, manufactured goods are shipped mainly from east to west, and the products of the farm, mine and forest, mainly from west to east. The amount of traffic which moves north and south is relatively small; and there seems no ground for anticipating any substantial change in this respect. As the Mississippi and its tributaries run mainly north an 1 south, it is hard to see where a heavy traffic for them could be obtained even though the boats on them were able to I he Proposed Development of Inland Waterways 753 competc successfully in rates against the nortb-and-south railways. The situation of the principal waterways of Europe relatively to the main currents of commerce is more fortunate. The Rhine in Germany, for example, like the Great Lakes in this country, is ideally located relatively to the sources of production and consumption of coal, iron ore, etc., to get a large traffic in them. In Europe, also, commerce grew up before the advent of the railway, and the direction of the currents of traffic has been influenced more by the way the waterways run. Here commerce and the more flexible railway have grown up together, each determining where the other should go in substantial disregard of most of the waterways. While the fact that the Mississippi Val- ley waterway system runs transversely to the main currents of commerce tends to show why it has not developed a heavy commerce, it does not explain why its traffic has actually decreased while that on the competing north-and-south railways has grown. Nor does it explain why the traffic on other waterways having more favorable situations, such as the Erie Canal anti the Hudson River, has declined. The main reason why the water-borne traffic of the United States has decreased while that of Europe has increased is the wide difference between railway freight rates here and abroad. The average railway rate per ton per mile in Belgium is over 16 mills; in France, 14 mills; and in Germany, 13 mills. In the United States it is 7.54 mills, or 47 p01- ccnt- of what it is in Belgium, 54 per cent, of what it is in France, and 58 per cent, of what it is in Germany. Mere averages which take no account of differences in conditions and methods of transportation may mis- lead, but, allowing for all such differences, it is quite safe to say that railway freight rates here are very much lower than in Eu- rope, especially for long hauls and for the cheaper and bulkier commodities. In fact, the rates of American railways compare favorably with those of European water- ways. On the Rhone, in France, the rates vary from 7.8 mills to 15.6 mills per ton per mile; on the Seine from 26  twenty-six  to 56  fifty-six  mills: on the Canals du Centre and du Midi from 6.2 to 7.8 mills; on the canals in the north-east and east of France from 3.8 to 4.6 mills. The average rate on a wide variety of commodities mov- ing to Paris, where the traffic is very dense, is 5.78 mills. The average rate on all the waterways of France is not less than 6 mills. The average for the waterways of Ger- many, according to the statistics given by the Royal Commission, is about 5 mills; and the average for the Belgian waterways about 6.5 mills. Before these rates can fairly be compared with those of railways several facts must be considered. A waterway usually is longer between any two points than a railway. This makes its rates seem lower than they are. If the .distance by rail between two points is 100 miles and in' water 150 miles, and the rate by both rail and water is $1 per ton, the average per mile by rail will be 10 mills, and by water only 6.6 mills; but the greater distance which makes the wa- terway s average rate per mile lower will also hinder the waterway from getting traffic. Now, the distances on which these average rates for the waterways of Bel- gium, Germany, and France are computed are at least one-third greater than the dis- tances by rail. Computed on the dis- tances by rail, the average rate by water in Belgium and France would be about 8 mills and in Germany about 6.5 mills. Furthermore, the average railway rate for an entire country includes the compara- tively high rates on many high-grade com- modities which seldom can move by water and the rates on many roads running through mountainous territory where ojier- ating expenses are greater and rates are apt to be more than on the low-grade railways with which waterways mainly compete. While the average railway rate per ton-mile in the United States is 7.54 mills, the aver- ages are much lower on many American roads having low grades or handling traffic consisting largely or mainly of cheap and bulky commodities. The average rate per ton per mile of the New York Central in 1907 was 6.4 mills; of the Pennsylvania Railroad, 6.3 mills; of the Illinois Central, 5.8 mills; of the Lake Shore   Michigan Southern, 5.27 mills; of the Big Four, 5 mills; of the Norfolk   Western, 4.95 mills; and of the Chesapeake   Ohio, 4.33 mills. It would seem from the foregoing that the cost lo the shipper of water transporta- tion in Belgium, Germany, and France is 754 The Proposed Development of Inland Waterways certainly on the average no less tluin on American railways.  The total cost is substantially greater than llie cost to the shipper. The expenditures of the French Government for maintenance of canals anti improved rivers and for interest on the money laid out in their development amounts to 4 mills  kt ton per mile for all water- borne traffic. The similar expenditures of Belgium amount to 4.6 mills; and those of Germany to 8J-tenths of a mill per ton per mile, including the Rhine and Elbe on which the traffic is very large, and, exclud- ing them, to 2 mills per ton per mile. This makes the total average cost of water trans- portation in France, estimated according to waterway mileage, 10 mills   er ton per mile; and, estimated according to railway mileage, 12 mills. It makes the total aver- age cost of water tran   ortation in Ger- many, estimated according to waterway mileage, not less than 6 mills; and, esti- mated according to railway mileage, not less than 7.5 mills. It makes the total cost in Belgium, based on waterway mileage, 11 mills; on railway mileage, 12.6 mills. In Germany it just altout equals, and in Belgium and in France it greatly exceeds the average cost of rail transportation in the United States. It is not possible to estimate what is the average rate on the rivers and canals of the United States. It is worth noting, how- ever, that in 1906 the average amount paid by the shipper on each ton carried on the Mississippi waterway system, regardless of the distance it was carried, was 62 cents, while the interest alone on what the gov- ernment had spent in improving thiswater- way system, computed at 4 per cent., was 33 cents per ton. Transportation service by rail is faster and better than by water. The freight car can move as well into a shipper s ware- house to get goods as on the road's main line, while all goods shipped by water must in some way Ix- hauled to and from the wa- ter s side and Ik- transferred to and from the boat. Therefore, to compete successfully with railways, boats must make rates to shippers not only as low as, but lower than,   Thr Kniiftl Stale  National Waterways Commivtion s  s in it  preliminary report, nhich was issued af trr ihc aVivr ua  wrilten: "Thr average European freight fsClCj-ntl railway paralleling water rtnil   are higher than ii . sr  m lims similarly  tuuhd in the United Stales, ami European rate  far water-borne carriage, ui wwne instance , even where the traffic H very tofgr, are .is high or higher than on railway  iti the United State  where truUic u. likewise Urge ' those of railways. Experience in Europe and the United States shows that they must ordinarily be 20 to 50 per cent, lower. The conclusion is inevitable that if our water- ways and their equipment were in the exact condition of those of France and Germany, and made equally low rates, they would fail as utterly in the future to compete success- fully with the railways as they have hereto- fore. Some of the advocates of further devel- opment of waterways apparently see this. They therefore demand that the proposed Lakes-to-the-Gulf waterway shall be dug 1 ,j feet deep, or even 20 feet, or more; and they paint alluring pictures of great vessels loading at Chicago and St. Louis, and steaming without transfer of goods through the country to the Gulf, and thence to all the ports of the world. But if the waterway were deepened to only 14 feet hardly any boats could use it which cannot use it now, for over 95 per cent, of the vessels on the Great Lakes draw over 14 feet of water and more than 80 per cent, draw over 19 feet; and, of course, sea-going vessels cannot navigate where lake vessels cannot. Even if the Lakes-to-the-Gulf waterway were dug 20 feet or even 30 feet deep, it is not probable it would be used by lake or ocean steamships. The average cost of an ocean steamship per ton of capacity is S71; of a lake steamship, S41.50; and of a river tow- boat anil barges capable of carrying 10,000 tons of freight on an 8A-foot draught, only $12.00. Moreover, a lake or ocean vessel is  M orly constructed for navigating a canal or a tortuous river with a swift current ; its ratio of length to lx-am is loo great and its rudder  x wer insufficient to keep it from frequently running into the banks except when moving very slowly. Col. Thomas W. Symons, of the corps of engineers of the United States Army, in a report in 1897 on the proposed deepening of the Erie Canal, estimated that the cost to the shipper of transporting wheat in a lake freighter of 7,000 tons capacity through a ship-canal would be 38 per cent, greater than with a tow-boat and barges on a barge-canal. This took no account of the fact that the esti- mated cost to the public of building the ship-canal would be four times as great as that of building the barge-canal. The Mississippi waterway system could be used as well now by boats such as those on the The Proposed Development of Inland Waterways waterways of Europe as if it were much deeper; and if it were much deeper it could not and would not be used by either lake or ocean vessels. If the proposed development of water- ways would reduce what 1 have called the  total  cost of transportation, it is quite obvious that it would be practicable for boat owners to make rates which would be high enough to cover a return on the gov- ernment s expenditures and yet low enough to attract traffic from the railways. If those who advocate further development of waterways believe that the owners of the lioats could do this, and are animated solely by public motives, why do they not make it a part of their programme that the govern- ment shall levy such tolls on the boats as may be sufficient to compensate it for its expenditures  When the United States Reclamation Service builds an irrigation ditch, it requires those whose lands are watered to pay for the water. Is there any more reason why the government should provide facilities of transportation for boat owners or shippers for nothing than why it should provide irrigation for farmers for nothing   In some cases governments have levied tolls on canals and improved rivers, but in no case since the advent of the rail- way has it l een jiossible to get in this way enough revenue to pay interest and main- tenance charges. The second argument in favor of water- way development to which 1 have alluded is that it would regulate freight rates. By this is meant, of course, that it would re- duce the rates of competing railways. If 1 draw the correct inference from the data 1 have presented, unless lower rates were made on the canals and improved rivers than ever have been made on such water- ways, the effect of their development on ex- isting railway rates would be but slight. Assuming, however, that it would enable canal and river boats to make lower rates than ever have been made by them any- where, what would be the effect on railway rates  It should first be remarked that advo- cates of waterway development hold in- compatible views as to the effect it is de- sirable that it should be allowed to have. In a Chicago newspaper, President 1 aft recently was quoted as saying that water- ways should be developed to regulate rail- way freight rates. In the same column of the same newspaper Representative J. K. Ransdell, of Louisiana, President of the Rivers and Harbors Congress, was quoted as repeating the charge frequently made that the railways of the United States have in the past attracted commerce from the waterways by unfair methods of competi- tion, and as saying that when the water- ways are further developed there should l e legislation to prevent the roads from so re- ducing their rates as to monopolize the traffic. Now, if the railways are not al- lowed in the future, as in the past, to freely reduce their rates to meet water competi- tion, the waterways will not regulate rail- way rates; and if the railways arc allowed to so reduce their rates they will attract traffic from the waterways. A policy of prohibiting railways from meeting the rates of water-carriers would not be without precedent. The French Government does not let them reduce their rates within 20 per cent, of those of the water lines. The  ierman railways which are owned by the government also refrain from meeting the water rates. This is one- reason why railway rates in France and Germany are relatively high. It does not seem probable that such a policy would be adopted in this country. We are more apt to adopt the   olicy either of letting the railways reduce their rates to  joints where they meet water competition, without correspondingly reducing them to other points, or of letting them reduce their rates to meet water com  etition and re- quiring them, when they do so, to make corresponding reductions to all points. Probably it is the latter policy which Mr. Ransdell meant to advocate. The former policy would aggravate the very discriminations in railway freight rates to different communities about which there is now so much complaint. For the main cause of these discriminations is that where the railways encounter effective wa- ter coni  ctition it forces them to make lower rates than they can afford to make else- where. With every increase of water com- petition there would be an increase of discrimination. All the people of the coun- try would be taxed to pay for the develop- ment and maintenanceof the waterways; but only those adjacent to the waterways would get the benefit of any resulting reductions 760 The Proposed Development of Inland Waterways in railway rates. The communities not on the waterways would actually be in- jured. It is the relation between rates that mainly counts; and a community may be as much harmed by reductions in the rates oi a rival community as by advances in its own. It may be said that such discriminations in rates could and should be prevented by passing a law retiring railways lo make rates as low in proportion where they do not encounter water competition as where they do. But the railways could not afford to reduce all their rates to the level of those that they make to meet water competition any more than the manufacturer or mer- chant could afford to reduce all his prices to the basis of those- he makes to  jet rid of surplus and otherwise unsalable goods. The effect of such legislation would be to force the roads in many cases to quit mak- ing rates to meet water competition. This would not benefit places without water transportation; for the communities having water transportation would still enjoy the lower water rates. It might actually injure communities without water transportation. For the law will not permit the railway to l e denied a  fair return." If it quit meet- ing the water rates it would lose whatever traffic it had got to points having water transportation; and if this reduced its ag- gregate profits below a  fair return  it legally could make up the deficit by ad- vances in rates to communities without water transportation. These communities would then have paid taxes to secure for rival communities low water rates and for themselves the privilege of paying higher railway rates. If fairly conclusive evidence could be adduced that development of waterways would lower the total economic cost of transportation it might properly be decided that the benefits it would confer on the whole country would outweigh any disad- vantages under which it would put parts of the country. But since the evidence tends to show that it would not reduce the total cost of transportation, it would seem rather inconsistent for the- government, after pro- hibiting discrimination by railways between communities, except under  substantially dissimilar conditions,  to take the money of all communities and use it to build water- ways which would create the very  dis- similarity of conditions  which legally au- thorizes railways to discriminate between communities, and which, as I have pointed out, would give some communities advan- tages over others, even if the railways were absolutely prohibited from discriminating at all. The third argument in favor of further development of waterways which I have mentioned is that it would provide in the best way needed additional facilities of transportation. That expansion of such facilities is needed is not questionable. Every fall and winter for some years before the panic of 1907 the country suffered from what were called  shortages of cars," but what were really shortages of railway facili- ties in general. Owing to subsequent large increases of facilities and improvements in methods of operation the railways last fall and winter handled the heaviest traffic in their history without serious congestion or delays. But commerce again is growing rapidly; and unless means of transporta- tion are increased proportionately periods of  car shortage  will recur. The object of public policy should Lie to cause such additional facilities to be pro- vided. whether by the expenditure of public or private capital, as will, at the least cost, move most freely the increased commerce of all parts oi the country. I have already sought to show that it is improbable that rivers and canals can be so developed as to make the cost of trans iortation by water lower than by rail. It is still more improb- able that their development would provide as effectually for the tree movement of the commerce of all parts of the country' as would expansion of the facilities of the rail- ways. It is practicable to develop rivers and canals only in certain sections; and these arc not necessarilv the parts of the country which most need additional facili- ties of transportation. As already re- marked, the principal river system of this country runs north and south, while the great currents of commerce flow east and west. The most severe congestions of traffic in the winter of 1006-7 were on the railways running from the Pacific coast to the Great Lakes, from the trans-Mis- souri country and the South-west to Gal- veston, and from Chicago and St. Louis to the Atlantic seaboard. The Mississippi and its tributaries were at that time in as The Proposed Development of Inland Waterways 757 good condition to carry a large commerce as any waterways in Europe; yet they were not resorted to to relieve the situation. On the other hand, it is perfectly feasible to secure expansion of the facilities of the railways in proportion to the needs of the whole coun- try and of each part. Most of our rail- ways are but the skeletons of what they should be made. Our total railway mile- age is over 230,000 miles. Of this, only 20,000 miles is double-tracked. While it costs much less to build the second than to build the first track, the capacity of the road is thereby quadrupled. The Board of Army Engineers estimates that it would cost Si6o.ooo,ooo to dig a channel 14 feet deep from Chicago to New Orleans. 1,657 miles. This would build almost 2,000 miles of low-grade, double-track, well- equipped railway; or it would build 3,500 miles of good, low-grade, single-track rail- way, which could handle as much traffic as an equal mileage of waterways; or it would double-track 5.500 miles of existing single-track railway, thereby increasing the capacity of the American railway system the equivalent of 22,500 single-track miles. The S500.000.000 which it is proposed to spend on inland waterways during the next ten years would build 5.000 miles of good, low-grade, double-track railway; or it would build 10.000 miles of good, low- grade, single-track railway; or it would double-track almost 20.000 miles of exist- ing single-track railway, which would be equivalent to an increase in single-track capacity of almost 60.000 miles. If the ad- ditional railway facilities were provided by private capital we may feel sure they would, in general, lie provided where they would be of the most public utility. For private capitalists naturally would invest where the largest profits were to In.- secured; that would l e where there was available the largest traffic; and those places where the largest traffic is available are those where there is the greatest need for ad- ditional means of transportation. The public can obtain the needed increase of railway facilities by the simple expedient of adopting a policy of regulation, which, while protecting the rights and interests of the public, will not make investment in railways less attractive than in other businesses. There are facilities of transportation, the scientific and systematic improvement of which by the Federal and State Govern- ments would reduce the congestion of traffic on the railways and lower the cost of trans- portation without involving wasteful dupli- cation. These are the public highways. From about February 1 to October 1 of each year the railways have many thou- sands of idle cars. Late in September and early in October the traffic sweeps on them in a deluge, and for about four months there is a car shortage instead of a car sur- plus. These annual alternations of car satiety with tar famine are due largely to the condition of the public highways. In the greater part of the United States the snows, and the alternate thaws and freezes, of fall and winter put the highways in such bad shape that it is hard or impossible to pull a heavily loaded wagon on them. In consequence, most farmers rush their c rops to market soon after harvest. At the same time the railways have to haul the larger part of the coal traffic, and thus they are swamped. If the highways were put in good condition the farmers could haul their crops to the railway station more at their convenience and the annual conges- tion of traffic would be alleviated. The country s annual bill for transportation would also be much reduced. Mr. Frank Andrews, expert in transportation of the Department of Agriculture, estimates, after a thorough investigation, that the average cost per 100 pounds of hauling wheat from the farms to the railway stations is 9 cents; of hauling corn, 7 cents; of hauling cotton. 16 cents; and of hauling oats, 7 cents. The average length of the hauls are 5 to to miles. The average rail-and-ocean rate on grain from St. Louis via New York to Liverpool is less than 15 cents j er 100 pounds. It is evident that there is a great deal better opportunity to reduce the cost of transportation by improving the public highways than by improving either rail- ways or waterways. It is easily imaginable that, in a country where changes in commercial and industrial conditions occur so rapidly as in this, the time might come within a comparatively few years when additional development of waterways would be justifiable and desir- able. But the criterion of whether it is de- sirable at any particular time should be the extent of the use made of channels pre- 758 Gemma to Beatrice viously provided. The government having provided as good channels as can be found elsewhere, nothing less than such utilization of them as justifies past expenditures can afford rational ground for inferring that their further improvement or the construc- tion of new channels will be justified by re- sulting public benefits. GEMMA TO BEATRICE By Katharine Fullerton Madonna Beatrice, in highest Heaven:  I have a word oh, I had many words To that slim girl in red who struck him blind Years since, in bitter Florence. Poets, they say, Are better blind, and sightless eyes can see God's ranged worlds, where we sec murk and flame. Yet for no grace she gave him, did he lose The look of men who look upon the sun, Or gain the look of ghosts beyond the grave. Light women are at worst but traffickers, Exchanging least for most: this saint gave naught, And snatched a soul Madonna pilferer  Not even bride of Christ, this Beatrice, But wedded to an honest citizen. I saw no matter there for sacred song, Or magical complicity of stars. But 1 have paced beside him while he spoke Tongues 1 knew not, heard ' Bice" called at midnight  While the lamp flickered and I lay alone. I doubt not God has made this mystery, This scourge of Beatrice to smite our sins; I rail no more against the long Possession. My heart beats quieter against his heart Each year; my hands have learned to cherish I he yellow sheets that slowly build the Work  On which I read but one name: Beatrice. I have struck truce at last with Beatrice. Ah, lady, in the utmost ranks of Heaven You sit with saints, he says, devising well Of Love. I say you have not known it: nav, Gemma, in this, has lore past Beatrice, Past Dante, who himself has lore past prophets. Beyond the grave, I render him again To that pale Presence which beset his days, Vet left him Gemma s. You who loved him not, Gemma to Beatrice Accept the homage of immortal sung, The tribute of all lovers yet unborn, Who still will talk of  Dante s Beatrice,  Linking your name through ages with his name, Betrothed in Heaven and to Eternity. Let this content you, you who loved him not  A girl, a stranger s lips have canonized, And wonder-struck to find herself a saint. They who go murmuring your name and his. Scarce will know what was Gemma, and no words    ill outlast death to tell if I was fair. Vet would 1 scorn to be but Beatrice, I who am Gemma  I who have been bride And mother, and am now content to go Through the slow Purgatorial years, until The centuries shall slay my human heart, And leave me fit for Heaven, where you sit. The Work is yours, Madonna; but his head, Pillowed on my young bosom, taught me first  Watching above his sleep a motherhood Without the bearing-pangs. Then came the child That said to all the world:  Lo, these arc one, And I am both, indissolubly twain.  I swear no separate sainthood is worth this  Vour Dante, worn with hymning you, sought rest Within my arms: I kissed the haunted brow To slumlx-r. If by sleight of soul, or chance Of constellations, Dante s mind fell prey To Beatrice, shall Gemma grudge it her  No stars imposed me on his heart; he chose Gemma to wife, and Gemma stands defended Before all men, as you before all angels. I have shed many tears, Madonna, for your sake: Now I am wise, and would not change with you. Who have known love but as the angels know ii. In Heaven, where none gives or take-, to wife. I have loved Dante, whom you did not love; I wedded Dante, whom you did not wed: I hold no woman is so blest as I  No other woman bom will have had this. Gemma and Beatrice must still be twain, And Beatrice has the better part, I know, Winning from Florence straight to Paradise, Unpurged and pure. And yet this poet of our-. Madonna, though his mind transcends the tomb, Roams, pitiless and wise, among the dead, And shapes each petal of the deathless Rose, 700 Gemma to Beatrice  Oh, I have crouched to listen, at the dawn, To know what kept him sleepless and aloof    This poet of yours and mine, I say, Madonna, Treads earth with firmest feet; bread nourishes The hand that writes, and body s   eace has part In the soul s rapture. Were it not for Gemma, The world, mayhap, had not known Beatrice. 1 am content to perish, knowing this: That my poor flesh has served my Dante s soul, That hands and feet and heart have ministered.  Nay, there was sorcery, lady, in your gift  One  'lance no word:  twas God, not you, that wrought it; Another could have served for Beatrice.  But I have paid in human wise for him: The roses of my cheeks have ebbed into The veins of these his children; my seared brow Is but the scroll of my perplexity, Deep-scrawled; my hands have coarsened and grown hard Because his fare was delicate; I have turned Bread into manna, water into wine, And inch by inch my beauty wrought his strength. I have no beauty now there stands the Work  My alchemy, Madonna, is worth yours; Three souls, not two, have done our Dante s task. I give you greeting, lady, in all peace And reverence. I ask your pardon now I'or ancient hatred, ere I had grown wise. Gemma and Beatrice must still be twain, And Dame must seek both. This is the law Of every poet s soul. No woman bom May lie the twain: each woman born must choose, Or love a lesser man. I would be Gemma, Though God should give me choice of Beatrice. We shall not meet, be sure, in Paradise. When Gemma is come thither, it will lie To sit far off, the humblest citizen Of the celestial city. I shall come late, Slow-faring under penitential skies Through a long age, and purged of all that made Me Dante s wife, and servant of the Work. Scarce Dante will remember on that day I hat Gemma was, or will know Gemma s face. I have had earth, Madonna. Heaven is yours. I shall not speak through all eternity 1  challenge you. Oh, I am well content   THE POINT OF VIE.W- PRIZING, as I believe most readers do, any form of literary animation, even when arising from had blood, I always hasten to the scene of verbal conflict in the hope of seeing manly blows exchanged. The art of literary warfare is declining, as compared with the brave  lays of old. Not that writers hate each other any less. On the contrary there is as much wrath as ever, but its expression is hopelessly inadequate. Writers personally are often at the boiling-point, whose Disparagement words will not  come to a boil." Take, for example, the great volume  f hostile comment caused by those two witty and provocative persons, Bernard Shaw and Mr. G. K. Chesterton. N   two writers of our day have invited so many attempts at a sar- castic rejoinder. The literary folk are always nagging at them. Every newspaper has had its fling, and there is one British weekly maga- zine which makes a  Mint of printing a bitter word about one or the other of them in every issue. From all these whole-hearted endeav- ors, it seems as if something of interest ought to have come. But so far as I recall there has been nothing at all commensurate with the hostile intentions not a  Parthian dart,  or an  envenomed shaft,  or a  flick on the raw,  or a  well-directed thrust,  or any of the mordancies, causticities, pilloryings, unmask- ings, wilhcrings, and excoriations which con- noisseurs in literary bitterness delight to de- scribe. It has been a sad display oi verbal impotence, humiliating to two warlike nations of Anglo-Saxon blood. Often the rage is bare- ly articulate, expending itself in mere short outcries of  fool,   clown,   driveller,  and  mountebank,  as if the hater had run short of breath. Somebody will merely utter three times the dreadful term  mud prophets,  whatever that may mean. Another will say  self-advertiser  and let it go at that. No gibes or thunderbolts; no fun or fury; nothing that could give pain to the victim or pleasure to the ondooker; just a nosc-to-thumb gesture, and all is done. It is hard to see why writers go into battle if this is the best they can do. And it is the same way with the single com- bat. Many a literary hand-to-hand encounter have I attended in recent years, only to find it an affair of pop-guns.  Why do you box my ears in public   said a well-known writer to his foeman, not so very long ago rather a lapse from the good old-fashioned  reply to my critics    You re a Bayswater prophet,  said an angry editor to a playwright.   You're a blazing boy,  was the thundering rejoinder. And each withdrew, claiming the victory. But this was an uncommonly savage contest as modern word-fights go. Usually earh backs away expressing surprise at the other's lack of gentility. It is the reader s misfortune. He ought always to be the tertius gaitdeiis at these affairs. Vnless at least one shot proves fatal, there is no excuse for the printing. It is un- seemly that literary wrath should bring forth no fruit meet for publication. Not that I would bring back the days of  The Dunciad  or of  F.nglish Bards and Scotch Reviewers.  You cannot ask an angry modern author to plan these long campaigns or to rout the household out at midnight, as Pope did in his transports of inspired malignity. But as a lover of the manly art  for others  I do protest against these poultry-yard fulfil- ments of gladiatorial undertakings, this cheat- ing of the hope of bloodshed by exhibitions in spilled milk. For a light is after all a public occasion and should be an occasion of interest. It is a promise of warmth and of heightened color, and we have a right to demand some little excitement as we hurry to the field. The eyes of the cat arc greener and her tail is handsomer when she fights. It is not unreason- able to exj cct as much of authors. Self-love has ever been a rich literary vein. Admirable consequences have flowed from its wounds, and many a good poem has followed a puncture. Great happiness has often been conferred upon the world by the simple process of pricking an author. Moreover, every well-known writer is entitled to at least one dangerous foe, none of your sputtcrers of  fool,   mountebank,  and  mud prophets,  but the sort of enemy who will take pains in order to inflict them whose rule for the arena shall be  to  eri til sc scnti.it mori, or, if that high standard is unattainable, who will at least so strike lhat he will enter- tain the amphitheatre. But nowadays when a critic is angry he merely seems out of sorts  761 The Point of View no literary bowels to his wrath, the wits being lost along with the temj er. Hence the ab- sence of an effective opposition party  as bad for books as it is for politics. It does not mean an era of good feeling. It means an era of no feeling at all. IT may be remarked that the essays on the attractions of old age are usually written liy youngish persons who look forward to that presumptively happy period through those least presbyopic lenses of pleasant an- ticipation with a real pleasure of hope. There is bound to be an empirical for'Aj; r', lll0ri quality in their study of the subject; the student has the detached altitude of the essayist whose free-running phrases arc never hamstrung by any sharp edge of experi- ence. It is an admirable thesis; some of the wisest and greatest minds in the world have al- ready expressed it; the essayist feels himself, in a measure, on sure ground, and he pricks along very cheerfully, untroubled by any present sen- sation of the shadows which lie is sure must be found coo  and agreeable when he shall later on perceive himself riding into their out- lying mists. As an English writer has reminded us re- cently, when we read the  De Senectute  we are not listening to Cato the Elder, at eighty- four, but to Cicero, a considerably younger man, telling us what he thought Cato would have said. The same writer cites Gibbon as really perceiving the matter most clearly when, after acknowledging the peace-bringing philoso- phies achieved by men later in their lives, he yet wrote:  Hut I must reluctantly observe that two qualities, the abbreviation of time and the failure of hope, will always tinge with a browner shade the evening of life." The browner shade, which marks the falling leaf, must have its inevitable hint of melancholy, of course; and the failure of the chlorophyl doubtless must cause such measure of regret as exists as an integral part of any failure. But if the philosopher have gained any balance of mind at all through his years, he will observe that the greenness which is agreeable to the eye in the leaf, is less desirable in the woody fibre; a sappy sprout cannot hold its own with a seasoned trunk; you can i live by chlorophyl alone, in this world. And out of this strong, seasoned wood he can make himself a club for defence against some attacks of the pridewhich luxuriates most boastfully in the greenness of the leaf. And so he can come by at least a single con- solation for his age. If he must grow old, at least he need not fear lest he grow young. What nightmare of fate would that be, for a man to know, surely and of a truth, that his strong sense, his experience, his wisdom even, his poise, his gentleness, his tolerance all his  best of life"  as Rabbi Ben Ezra saw ii  must slip from him, with imperceptible slow- ness, jx-rhaps, so that he should scarcely feel his deprivation till it was complete, yet going on so surely as night follows day, leaving him worth a little less with every elusive year, yet gaining no ounce of influence or men s rcspect    for these synovial fluids of men's lives would dry up and leave him helplessly creaking in his stark greenness of spirit. A man may con- sider, looking backward through his years, that he has not got so much as he had expected  of truth, or love, or the seeds of the fruit of the forbidden tree. But whatever he has got - that s his own, at least. lie is not to have it filched from him, pitilessly, sneeringly, by some strange goblin with green blood in its veins. He may feel some shuddering sense that this goblin once lived in his father s house; but at least he left it   lost it somewhere back there, years ago. And brown as he may be himself, he will never have to see that green thing again. OF our books, none have a life so much their own as those wherein there still crops out the genius not of an author alone, but of a reader worthy of that author. A keen intelligence has passed that way; in pass- ing, it has conveycd to an inanimate object the Stir of its own life. The thought of the writer has been taken a stage farther on in the jour- ney toward truth; else it has been led into one of the untrodden by-paths. Or per- haps the text has been tortured with interlineations by one who proves himself no mean antagonist; the margins have been stabbed, not with imbecile interro- gation points, but with ironical rejoinders, with taunts, in the face of which the author is cruelly condemned to silence. Questioned and questioner are alike departed; perhaps they walk arm-in-arm by the Stvx bank, amic- able in their discussion of die points at issue. A year ago a great library was dispersed. Hundreds of collectors divided among them- selves, according to their preferences and their purses, the books that had been a celebrated The Point of View 763 critic s playthings and tools. The books are scattered the editiones prinetpes, the authors' copies, the books that an- precious only for their notes in that fine, clear hand, each letter formed with carc as if it had its value. Fort- unate as are the possessors of these volumes, they must sometimes own to a certain feeling of guilt, as having profited by an ill deed. In the breaking-up of such a library there is the final dissipation of a personality. The books should have been kept together, like Car- lyle's, that are preserved at Harvard. Kept together, they would have had a meaning no less precious to the sentimentalist than to the closest student of the man as writer and as thinker; yes, and as reader, too. A book well read and somewhat scarred by the reader's jiencil is become a part of him a member of his spiritual body, liven the Bosh  inscribed by Carlyle opposite a statement that lie disbe- lieved or disliked has a transcendental value for us, embodying something of his character. One prizes his expletive above the bit of phi- losophy or of poetry that it so cruelly and doubtless so unjustly qualifies there to the end of time. Not great men alone have scribbled on the edges of books they loved or quarrelled with Nor was the practice limited strictly to school- girls  scribblings in the current novels. Those were days when every man of scholarship or substance took pride in his books; the era of the levelling public library was not yet come. And with the more personal feeling that the reader had in those bygone daw  remcnil er, he had fewer books, but he read them through   that reader was apt to have a genuine tete-a- tete with the writer himself, before the volume was laid down. As for my grandfather, who may not have differed very widely from your own, he look a naive pleasure in writing over against a bit of characterization in a novel he liked, or in a favorite essay, the initials of his excellent neighbors: it was a discreet  just like M. G.,  or,  C . Mrs. H. A.,   that he traced there. The marginalia, these, of a man who never distinguished himself: and yet they have a certain quaint significance for me, though I have no clue to the identity of the  M. G. s  and the  Mrs. H. A.'s.   What it proves to me is the fact that my good grand- father prig though he may have been read with an ojicn eye and an intelligence that never slumbered. It shows, besides, that he went back to his books that he picked them up the second time, and the third that he looked on them as old friends and confidants; as such, not to be lightly jilted in favor of the next  best-seller.  Yet best-sellers there were, and ever have been. In the eighteen-fifties, a certain young man named Mitchell was writing them. Mis books were read by old and young; they sold like hot cakes, as we say; like bread, as the more sober idiom would have it. Our fathers read those books, if we ourselves did not; sometimes they read them to our mothers.  The Reveries of a Bachelor  is still read to- day; but my copy of it is gray and dog's- eared, like a school-boy's Virgil; the bravery of its gilding is tarnished; yet how crisp were the pages sixty years ago  The  Reveries" came into the world with a pseudonym to cloak their author's modesty: Ik Marvel was the pseudonym, and we buried its wearer, bachelor no longer, though still an amateur, but yester- day. Ik Marvel had survived his literary gen- eration, and even in his hey-day an old-world flavor was tasted in his style; the gentle senti- mentalist was one that knew the Spectator papersand had smoked his pipe late over Steme and Goldsmith. It is hard to see how he was the worse off for it or his readers, either. I treasure my copy of the  Reveries," though I picked it up for a song at a stall where none but the maimed of the book world find their way. It is a shabby old book, and its two engravings have only stained the pages that they adom. But, as I turn the pages of  Over a Wood Fire   the best of the Rever- ies, as it is the first ,  Smoke, signifying Doubt, and Blaze, signifying Cheer, and Ashes, sig- nifying Desolation, they take on a new meaning for me, and a double interest. The author s sentimentality seems to me less ob- vious than before; his humor less facile and less reminiscent. It is pleasant to think that I am not the first to get pleasure out of that cigar of his, A Cigar three times Lighted. Tramping through the woods, one comes upon the dead ashes of a camp fire. Does not that make the woods more interesting territory  Mere I have a book that some one else has marked as suited his whim of the passing mo- ment the passing moment of half a century ago  Something of the fellow s'temjierameni I know from the record of it thal he made hem. And the book this copy of it has had its little history, that it tells after its own pretty fashion. I cannot do half so well; and some- thing keeps me from transcribing. I feel guilty enough in trying even to retell it. 764 The Point of View Estelle s lover took the  Reveries  with him in all his comings and goings. He, too, was a Bachelor though that against his will. When he returned from his Wanderjahre  the book went with him , his fondness for the " Reveries,  his fondness also for a certain maiden, were only the stronger for his having seen the world and the wonders thereof. Fi- nally he took a step that I commend to you, all lovers that have been rejected once in love, and yet would try again. He gave the book  and a flower pressed in it that he had plucked otT Shelley s grave  to the maiden that had said him no  I am falling into the rhctoric of the youth , telling her that the Revery called Blaze, signifying Cheer, expressed more feel- ingly than he could express them  though not more expressively than he could feel  the sen- timents he had for her. Once more he played the suppliant. And he begged her on a tly- leaf to regard his heart outjxmrings on the various pages  all very neatly written with the sharpest of hard pencils  as thoughts that he had set down only for himself, as he had then supposed; that belonged to her too, however, since she was their single inspiration. In Lon- don, and amid the distractions of tailor shops and haberdasheries; in Paris, where he had attended, for all his passion, at cafe and at comedy; in Florence, drinking in the beauty of the Pitti and drinking Lachrima Christi, too  it was she, the little maid of die: lui, whose image had flashed and flitted and floated be- fore him. So he sent her his travelling book, his bed book, too; in which was to be found so much that was hers and that he hoped might be his, as well. A very pretty way of offering one's self, thought I, as I read the neat handwriting of his heart outpourings. And I think so yet. Oh, yes, he was a sentimentalist, the author of the  Dream Life  and the  Reveries ; and a sentimentalist was he who wrote the dedication to Estelle; but remember, please, that the world was younger then younger by half a century. If that seems little to you in the light of our geological knowledge, well, remember, too, that  Werthcr s Sorrows  were not so dim in the literary background of that day; and young ladies still read Miss Jane Porter s  Scottish Chiefs  and "Thaddeus of Warsaw," and even, perhaps, if they were not too nervous, Mrs. RadclifTe s  Mysteries of Udolpho,  with its story' of the love of Emily St. Aubert and the young Valancour. I don t think the less of the unknown gentleman who signed only his initials, but who gave little glimpses into the heart of a man in love  first love, I think , in his foot-notes to Ik Marvel's   Reveries." I am sorry, though, that the book fell into the dealer s hands even though it is in my keeping now. Let us hope that the busy bookseller never stopped to read the finely pencilled sentences upon so many pages. 1 wonder, too one can t help wondering  whether the suit was smiled on at the last: if it was, why was not this doubly human docu- ment treasured by its recipient   Was she un- grateful for the heart that went with it  Was she cruel, as well as fair, Estelle    THE FIELD OF A R.T   run . I A' I Of 7  IF. ItOOK-  'J I J7i THE ex-lil ris, so frequently worthy of consideration as a work of art, espe- cially in its modern manifestations, is based primarily on the individuality of the per- son for whom it was made. It is the result of a natural impulse to indicate ownership in a book by more than a simple signature, or a type-printed label, by some device that shall be distinc- tive, that shall give some in- dication of the owner's char- acter and tastes. In fact, this impulse, and the pleasure in its artistic expression, have led sjme people to have more than one book-plate. Eger- ton Castle has several; Count zu Leiningen-Wester burg, over twenty. In these little art products, not only the skill and indi- vidual attitude of the artist are expressed; the personality and ideas of the one who or- ders the plate have had also tlu-ir influence on the result, and are, in fact, as one book- plate designer has well said, the key-note of the design. That does not alter the fact that ultimately the artist's personality is often the dom- inating one, and forms the main reason why   articular plates are sought. The factors in the compo- sition of the book-plate are, therefore, the relative mental attitudes oi owner and artist, and I he sympathy of each for the other's stand-point. It is this combination of elements which makes the charm of the book-plate, which results in a variety of inter- est that has caused the cult of the book-plate to become wide-spread and has occasioned a voluminous literature. Associations and periodiralsdevoted lolKKik- plates exisl in various countries, and large col- Vol. XLVlI. 75 lections of plates have been formed, such as the one in the British Museum  seventy thousand or more pieces , or private ones, such as those of Mr.    . Baillic and Mr. Henry Blackwell in this ciluntry. An extensive literature deals with the book-plate in general, in particular countries, in the work of individual artists. Book-plates for children  frequent   articularly in England and the United States  and for and by women have found their recording historians. The mass of material has led the systematic classifier to group plates into divisions, such as I he Jacobean, the Ribljon and Wreath, the Al- legorical, the Pictorial. The last, again, has l een subdi vided into the book-pile plate, the library interior  which frequently pictures the owner among his books , the por trait, the biographical, the landscape.. In earlier days the book- plate reflected the importance of heraldry in all the pomp of armorial bearings, and was, therefore, an emblem of fam- ily dignity rather than an expression of personal tastes. To-day the pictorial plate pre- dominates, directly or sym- bolically illustrating a par- ticular individuality. That, of course, does not exclude the opportunity fbr an unob- trusive introduction of lie raldic devices, liut possibili- ties for a less hampered effort on the part of the artist are immeasurablv increased. Mottoes, allegorical allu- sions, the portrait of the own- er, pictures of favorite places, the parapherna- lia of sjxirts or other hobbies, rows of books labeled with the names of preferred authors, allusions to personal achievement, wit good and poor, the downright pun  a cat and a bull on the plate of Chabaui , such elements, 765 By   H- Ffnckcn. 1 By Sidney I. Smith. with decorative selling, form material for e.v- Hhris. There ii plenty of opportunity for the display of  xior taste. An apjxarcnt an.vieiv to avoid running counter to the Scriptural ad- monition regarding bushel-covered lights may result in a   arailc of self-advertisement that weighs down the designer s freedom of expres- sion, as the Old Man of the Sea did Sindbad the Sailor.  Beraldi boldly asserts that  tin- worth of a bibliophile is in inverse ratio to the dimension of his ex-libris."  But if the owner may be too much in evidence, so, too, may the artist. An attempt to make a book- plate a compressed pictorial biography may prove fatuous, but it is equally unfortunate to make it a miniature mural decoration or poster, or to utilize it in the exploitation of super-advanced artistic idiotisms. Not stiff- ness, not even necessarily absolute seriousness, but a certain dignity is called for here; vagaries are out of order. The final purpose should always l e kept in view. Appropriateness is a prime necessity, appropri- ateness in conception, de- sign, and execution, the last implying a for the dium. taste which judgment of hold good here as well. The book-plate may in- dicate the owner's taste 766 By Geo. Wh:irt  i Kdward  with no distinct reference to him, as when A.  . Hopkins adopts an illustration from the  Hypnerotomachia Poliphilii   Florence, or another a figure from Botticelli's  Spring.  Or the allusion may he more di- rect, as in Francis Wilson s plate, which repre- sents a court-jester lost amid old volumes while lime goes on unheeded. The towers of Notre Dame looming dark in Victor Hugo s plate, by Bouvenne, are sufficiently clear in meaning, as i - a pair of hands 011 the key-board of a piano in another instance. In Phil May s plate, by W. Nicholson, the London 'Arriet, whose rak- ish vulgarity May hit off so well, is dccoratively utilized. And it is a dry, bibliophilic chuckle which is caused by the exultant JcTat  " I have it   entwining a volume on the plate which Bracquemond designed for Poulet-Malassis- Certain devices frequently recur  for instance, in Kng- tand, a quasi-allegorical fe- male reader, of more or less saccharine quality , as do mottoes such as  inter l'olia fructus.

Such vig- orous emphasis of non-lending ownership appears in a more elementary form in doggerel like the familiar  Don't steal lliis book, my honest friend, or else the gallows may be your end," and even the curse of heaven is called down on the heads of remiss borrowers. The middle course, that of the admonitory lender, is furnished by Garrick:  La premiere chose qu'on doit faire quand on a emprunte un livre e'est de le lire afin de pouvoir le rendre plus tot.  The ex-libris remains in its totality a  docu- ment,  a phase of human activity which not only cannot be overlooked, but which repays study, and is of most varied charm. It ap- peals through personal, historical, or literary association, it attracts as an instance of art ap- plied, as one of the many forms in which art may be made an integral part of daily life. Specifically the artist's province, when the basic ideas have been decided on, is the de- sign. the co-ordination of the various elements into an orderly whole. Over-elaboration, here, is as objectionable as a slighting of essen- tial possibilities. One of the problems always is  he arrangement of name and motto; a problem similar to thut of the ornamental value of lettering on medals, exemplified, say, by the work of Pisanello. It is over four hundred years since the first known book-plate was made, and the list of artists who have since then designed book- plates either occasionally or habitually is a Pj  LouU Rbead. long one, A great variety in artistic style and mood has been enlisted in I his specialty of production. Names taken almost at random from the list illustrate this. Diircr, Amman, Chodowiecki, Thoma, Greiner, Sattler,    r ik in Germany and Austria; Fait home, Bartolozai, Strange, Bewick, Sherborn in England; Eisen, Bouvmne, Bracquemond in France. Just a few, but what an array of influences they bring to mind: nationality, schools, personality. What a variety of technical methods, of adaptation of dif- ferent reproductive processes to individual style. There are reflected the wit, fancy, anil grace of the French, the decorative quality in Eng- lish work such as Crane's, the contemplative- ness and analysis of the German, the versa- tility and adaptativencss of certain of our own artists. In numerous individual variations are these movements and tendencies of na- tions and schools and groups expressed. The very names of Boucher, Gravelot, and Moreau le jenne conjure up pictures of the elegance and gaveiy of the eighteenth century in France, as Cheret's evokes the  tester and the litho- graphic art. IX V. Cameron, Sir Charles Holroyd and Frank Brangwvn repeat the dis- tinction and character of their larger etch- ings. The   Little Masters," Holbein and Max Klinger give pregnant expression to German ideas and ideals, old and new. Rassenfosse, Ro  s, Hovtema, Carl Lirsson form further rich notes in this concert of racial expression. The medium employed   the formal line-engraving on copper, the free etching, the vigorous wood- By W. M. Stone. tty We Ed ar Ki her PIaic Pr f. Grander Matthews, by lvJwm A. Abbey The Field of Art cm has also its distinct ami imjxirtant   art in the result. Adjustment of medium to style, giving natural expression to period and na- tionality, we find in the best art of any kind, and so here also. In our own country wc may trace the devel work of the men just named, which, while differing in style and in degree of freedom, hears in every case a certain stamp of reserve. For the artists who draw for the process plate no such limits arc set; the very facility of re- production invites free expression and tempts ipment oi the book-plate from the heraldic those who have a tendency, to go beyond proper magnificence and stately for- mality of the line-engraving period to the free expression of thought, or of   assing mood or whim which is transmitted by the immedi- a ten ess of the photo-me- chanical processes.    ne turns from the earliest work by Hurd, Paul Revere, H  w- rn, Doolittle, Dawkins  from which Washington s plate stands out mainly through associated veneration , to that of F.. D. French, Who in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries perpetuated the best tradi- tions of line-engraving on copper with signal success, lie employed formalized foliage, as did Bcham and other German masters, with ever-varying effect, with a dignified beauty of deco- rative line and a calm no- bility of expression which give him a place apart J. Winfred Spencclcy, who did not long outlive Mr. French, also engraved on copper, with more variety in design. A happy combination of adapiativeness and individ- uality, of dignity and a cer- tain free, ctchcr-like swing in his landscapes, marks his work. A similar note of variety is felt also in the line-engravings of Sidney L. Smith, W. F. Hy Shcldcit Cherry By Walter M Aikmati artistic bounds. It is de- cidedly to the credit of these younger designers, of book- plates that the whole of their work, subjected to so many influences, anti with so many opportunities for going astray, is so satisfac- tory.

II Garrett, Louis Rhcail, E. L. Warner have occa- sionally turned to it. But while a number of able artists have devoted all or most of their energies to this form oi art, fascinat- ing to many, it is with a shade of regret that one notes the very few cases iti which an American painter has turned aside from his canvas to design an occa- sional plate. We are still too much dominated by the idea that art.   high art,  is painting or sculpt ure, and that most other forms can be left to Hopson  who sometimes adds aquatint to the artist-artizans or treated as a bit of by-plav. pure line'.

Dioxogen is from 25   to 5Q-   stronger than ordinary peroxide, which means that when you dilute Dioxogen  as you do for nearly every purpose  you use less Dioxogen and add from 25 o to SO"o more   water. You do the diluting yourself and don t pay for the water. The Dioxogen bottles hold 'i more  large size  i more  than the corresponding sixes of ordinary peroxide; this means that when you buy Dioxogen, in addition to the greater strength and purity, you get Vi more in quantity. Considering the advantages of both the greater strength and the greater quantity, one hottle of Dioxogen will actually do as much and last as long as two bottles of ordinary peroxide. SCMHNHK-S MAGAZINE ADVERTISER Of even greater importance than Dioxogen economy is Dioxogen purity. Dioxogen has no disagreeable  tdor or bitter taste; it contains no acetanilid; acetanilid makes ordinary peroxide taste bitter and smell rank. No toilet table, no home emergency outfit is complete without Dioxogen. It is a necessity for the proper cleansing of the mouth and tcclli, excellent for tlic complexion and to relieve sunburn, de- lightful for use after shaving, a protection from infection in i'uts and wounds, and a prompt and safe relief in many other simple and serious emergencies of everyday life.

Kuhn, Incorporated  sound investments that have earned for clients interest returns of 5"y and 6%, which is con- siderably in excess of the ordinary bank interest rate. The safety of these bonds is due to the fact that J. S.   W. S. Kuhn, Inc., carefully in- vestigate each enterprise before handling its bonds whether municipal, public utility, irrigation or water works- and then purchase the bonds outright. This investigation is most thorough and often extends over many months. This rigorous and exhaustive examination by authorities of actual experience makes possible the record of this house  Never a day's delay in payment of principal or interest Also, many of its WaterYVorksand Irrigation bonds are guaranteed by a holding and opera- ting company having a capital and surplus of $4,500,000. This intrinsic safety backed by such a record for reliability gives to the securities handled by this house an element of exceptional security. The bonds we offer arc frequently issued in $100, as well as in $500 ami $1000 denomina- tions. That is, $100 will purchase a bond with exactly the same security and interest rate as a $500 or $1000 bond of the same company bears.

E GUNS and AMMUNITION BRAND "TARLTOX took- his big double-barrel and 1 advised me to take mine, as the sun had just set and it was likely to be elose work; but I shook my head, for the Winchester .405 is, at least for- me personally, the 'medicine gun' for lions." Ex-President Roosevelt In Scribner's Magazine Used by Successful Hunters. Sold Everywhere THE Winchester Model 1   .405 Caliber Rifle DREADNOUGHT OF THE JUNGLE 1 SCKI E.  EK'S MAGAZINE ADVERTISER NONBLURRABLE 1p That s another feature SaL of the Stevens Repeating   Shotgun No. 520. The front of the receiver is milled with a short, matted surface, far enough away from the eye to give a dear, unblurred sight. There is no projection behind the brecch to distract the mind or blur the eye. This is the Stevens Natural Sighting Method. It gives clean cut natural lines, with a perfected and natural balancc that makes this No. 520 a natural pointer. The Stevens is the fastest Repeater in the world, because the Repeating Action is the easiest to operate and bccausc the mechanism cannot be clogged when you do work it fast. THUMB   FINGER Arc enough to operate the pump action of this model. So easy working, such simple and accu- rate parts that, after pushing the safety catch, a one-armed man can reload the Stevens Repeater by giving the gun a forward "yank." Put the Stevens Repeater in the hands of an ordinary shooter and he can get in 6 shots while his double-barreled camp-mate is ejecting his second shell. But all this unusual speed would be useless in a gun unless it is absolutely NON-BALKABLE That's what the Stevens is. 6 Lightning shots with never a chance for a clog or balk. The best experts in the country have tried to balk this gun and failed. The reason is that the empty and the loaded shells travel by 2 separate routes and both start at once. They cannot meet   they cannot balk the gun. The repeating speed is ahead of the human hand. Knowing that the gun can t clog increases your speed. Knowing that it's a Natural Pointer increases your accuracy and cuts down the misses. Knowing that there is a wall of solid steel between you and the primer gives you confidence. No gas or parts of the gun can blow back. Safety   close, hard hitting   top speed   natural pointing   non-balking   perfect balance are these the things you want in a gun   Clinch what we say by seeing the gun for yourself. Throw a Stevens Repeater to your shoulder in any Sporting Goods store. Get the feel of it and know for yoursdl just what we mean when we call it the Natural Pointer. Act now and you will thank us every field day of your life. Every trap day too. If your dealer hasn't this gun in stock we will send express prepaid on receipt of List Price $27.

DO YOU WANT TO BE A BETTER SHOT  It s the fine points that make the big difference between the expert and the ordinary shot. Experts don't give away these points they spent long years to get. But it's to our advantage that present and future users of Stevens' rifles and shotguns become expert shots. We employ some of the world's crack shots. They know all the little kinks the fine points that gel them big scores. Do you want these short cuts to expert shooting   Then write us what interests you rifle shooting, the tr   s or field-shooting.

They are still  fiddling.  In the history of fire insurance in America, a large majority of the fire insurance companies organized have failed or retired from business. To be insured in a company like the HARTFORD, that has been in busi- ness a hundred years and will be in business a hundred years from now, costs no more than to be insured in one that may go out of business next week. It s your property which is to be insured. It s your money that pays the premium. You are to get the indemnity in case of fire. In short, it s your business and this matter is up to you. Why then, don t you DO something  And here s what to do. At the bottom of this adver- tisement is a coupon. Cut it out, write in the name of your insurance agent or broker, sign your name and mail it to him. Any agent or broker can get you a policy in the HARTFORD if you tell him to do so.
