TWILIGHT OF LOVE 51    chairs and an immense enervation seemed to possess his body.  But little by little this weariness passed. He began to experience a curi- ous, unexpected sense of ease, that puz- zled him. Slowly be glanced about.  The old men were stretched out like him in their chairs, placid; they were at ease too. He began to understand.  After all, this was the desiderate es- tate. . .    They were all at ease together, they shared the same placidity, the calm of fulfillment, the calm of forgotten hopes.

The Alpine Wanderers  By Florence Wilkinson  PERHAPS at beaded evening When all the lake towns shine From Vevey to Saint Gingolph,-- And in a twilight line By every Alpine valley Tinkle the homeward kine,-- Comes a remembered footfall: (That footfall will be mine.) You wake some crystal morning, See Monte Rosa glow, Suddenly you remember One sunrise long ago, And the sharp pain will blind you Unto that dream of snow: The flush, the hush, the farness,-- (They are my tears that flow.) You thread the slender pathways By the grey rushing Arve, --How well we knew those ledges That the long glaciers carve-- White mists will wreathe and bind you By the swift rainbowed Arve: (They are my arms that bind you, Your empty arms that starve.)   A GREAT man is one who leaves footprints on the sands of time. But a wise man is one who covers up his tracks.
