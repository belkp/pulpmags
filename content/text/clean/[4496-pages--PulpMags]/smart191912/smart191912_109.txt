Seeing Things  By John Temple I REALLY must be suffering from hallucinations. When I started dancing with Florence I noticed that she had on white kid slippers. Of this fact I am positive. Yet when the music stopped and I happened to glance to the floor I could hardly believe my eyes. The slippers were a sort of peculiar mottled black!     On Winter Nights  By John McClure ON winter nights when snow-flakes fall So quietly without, And the dim embers on the hearth Call, and dreams crowd about, Then I take refuge from the snow In books of balladry And dream the dreams that long ago Old poets dreamt for me, Turning the musty leaves to scan-- Long dead the makers quaint thereof-- Those courtly sonnets Italian And madrigals of love. On all snow-haunted winter nights I dawdle until dawn O'er tales of tourneys and of knights And ladies love-begone.
