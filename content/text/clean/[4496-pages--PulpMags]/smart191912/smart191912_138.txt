Criticism at a Gallop  By George Jean Nathan    I  THE argument of the writers for the dailies that the production of a piddling play like Mark Reed's defunct "She Would and She Did"--simply because a star actress happened to find its leading role rich in opportunities for personal exploita- tion-- constitutes a loud hoot at the star system is of a piece with an argu- ment which would maintain that be- cause one sometimes finds a fly in noodle soup the fly constitutes a blanket case against noodle soup. Quite con- trary to being an argument against the star system, the presentation of such an exceptionally poor play as that named is an argument for the star system since -- by virtue of the barriers of amateurish writing and technic which it assiduously interposes against the star's talent -- it contrives to develop that talent as talent is ever developed when confronted with handicap and challenge. An actor or an actress is not developed -- nor is the quality of acting best to be improved -- by good plays; it takes bad plays to school and ripen. If it is true that no actor has ever failed as Hamlet, it is equally true that no actress has ever failed as Cyprienne. But where a second-rate actor or actress can pass muster in a good play, helped as he or she is by the author's fertile imagination, finished writing and smooth technic, it takes a first-rate actor-- or at least an actor of first-rate potentialities -- to get away with an unyielding, hide-bound bad play. And any bad play that brings out the first-rate qualities of even a second-rate actor, by offering that actor at every turn the difficult     defiance of an author's shortcomings, surely provides a good argument in favour of a system that develops and broadens our actors, whether star or non-star.  To argue further, as have some of the gentlemen, that the star system was in this particular case responsible for the production of the aforemen- tioned opiate, that save for the com- placency of the star actress in question it assuredly would never have been produced, is even more widely to miss the mark. In support whereof I offer up the fact that another producing manager, to whom the manuscript was originally submitted under the title of "Golf," planned to present the play without a star and finally gave up the notion only because the play which he was then presenting in his con- tracted-for theater turned out to be an unexpected financial success and be- cause no other theater at an equally low rental -- permitting him to make a profit on a box-office as low as $5,500 a week -- was available.  Such a piece as "She Would and She Did" is infinitely less an argu- ment against the star system than an argument against certain stars who are currently part of that system. Not against these stars as actors, but against them as judges of manu- scripts. For one star like Faversham or Ditrichstein who generally knows a good play when he reads one, there are two like Miss Grace George who, once they no longer safely rely on the old reliables of repertoire, fall for a grand parade of " Richest Girls," "Sylvia of the Letters," "Earths," "Eve's Daughters," "Sauces for the    131
