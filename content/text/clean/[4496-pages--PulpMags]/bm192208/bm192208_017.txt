14 Blueberry Pie "Your sister?" she asked sadly, but with a certain eager curiosity. "Yes--I--I think so," said Irene. "Is--she--the body--here?" "No," said the woman. "They came last night--took her right down to the morgue. You can see her down there." Irene hesitated. Her mind leaped on. "I--I--we want to take the body home--if it is my sister," said Irene. Then, "Do you know what I could do-- how to get it?" She started to cry. "It's too bad," said the woman. "I'm Mrs. Figg. She's rented a room of me for over six months, now. Never talked much of herself. And yester- day morning--come in, dearie. . . ." Irene went in, saw the cheap little room of the other woman, listened to stories of her. No one cared for her. It seemed the woman was herself, in a way. That didn't matter. She wanted--the body. "I'll go, now--to the morgue," she said. "I'll go with you, if you like, dearie," Mrs. Figg volunteered. Irene shivered a little more at that. Then she nodded. After all, she didn't know how to get a body at the morgue. With this woman, who be- lieved her story. . . . She sat, quiet, while the woman dressed. They took a cross-town car. The morgue. . . . It was a big, gloomy building, smelling of disinfectants, clean, sol- emn. They went into a bare room, with wooden chairs about. A man asked questions. Irene sobbed. Mrs. Figg answered. The woman had died--no post-mortem had been necessary. Irene suddenly remembered those. What if there had been. How would she have got out of this? Yes, they could see the body. If Irene could identify it there would be no objection to her taking it away. She must get an undertaker, of course--she could sign, authorizing him--he could take it to his shop, em- balm the body--have it shipped to her home out of town. . . . Irene didn't want an undertaker or embalming. All she wanted was that body, untouched, in her apartment, without a coffin, without anything-- that body. She must get it. What could she do? She must get it. Her mind raced on. Well, she'd do her best. A new cunning seemed to come to her. If things would only go on. . . . The man led the way down a row of narrow stairs into a big room, with walls of white tile, clean, like a kitchen. There were huge drawers in the walls--drawers that pulled out. . . . "Here," said the man, and pulled out a drawer, a long drawer' with a woman on it--a dead woman. Was that the woman? She looked, cov- ered her eyes. A dead woman--a woman she had never seen before--a blonde woman with a sad, thin face-- not like hers--and yet--in a way--if there was enough time before the body was found. . . . She glanced at Mrs. Figg through her fingers. She had to be sure that this was the woman--that they were not testing her. Mrs. Figg nodded. "The poor, poor thing," she said. "Yes," said Irene, "that--that's my sister--two years older than I am-- and she'd dead--all alone . . she sobbed. They were real tears, now. She was thoroughly frightened. The man turned away. He was ac- customed to scenes. They went up the narrow stairs. Another man filled out a blank slip,
