ELLSWORTH VINES, JR., the spectacular young Pasadena athletic star who holds the U. S. National Championships for 1931 and 1932, and has now swept through the 1934 professional ranks as well! You'll enjoy this pleasing "Energizing Effect" When you've used up your en- ergy--smoke a Camel and notice how you feel your flow of natu- ral energy snap back. This experience, long known to Camel smokers, has now been confirmed by a famous New York research laboratory. Camel smok- ers enjoy a positive "energizing effect"...a healthful and delight- ful release of natural, vibrant en- ergy. Millions have found this to be true. A typical Camel ex- perience is this, Ellsworth Vines, Jr. speaking-- "Championship tennis is one of the fastest of modern sports. After four or five sets, you some- times feel that you just can't take another step. That's when a Camel tastes like a million dol- lars. Camels have a refreshing way of bringing my energy up to a higher level. And I can smoke all the Camels I want, for they don't interfere with my nerves." So, whenever you want a "lift," just smoke a Camel. You can smoke them steadily. For the finer, MORE EXPENSIVE TO- BACCOS in Camels never get on your nerves. Camel's Costlier Tobacco never gets on your Nerves Camels are made from finer, MORE EXPENSIVE TOBACCOS than any other popular brand. "Get a LIFT with a Camel! Copyright, 1934, R. J.
