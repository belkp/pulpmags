Duck Soup  By Lulita Crawford Pritchett    If there was one thing Puck liked more than to eat, it was to get a cowboy and a girl sewed up in a wonderful romance.     MIKE FLANNERTY, wizened cook at Towner's sawmill, swore at the potatoes that were sending up clouds of fragrant steam from the kettle. He swore at the beans. Then he opened the big oven and swore melodiously at two huge huckleberry pies as he lifted them onto a board shelf to cool. Swearing came natural to Mike. It was a sign of his good humor.  Two shadows that had been lurking near the doorway suddenly materialized into a tousle-topped, freckled-faced girl of about fourteen, and an impish looking elk. Both were sniffing hungrily. The girl was Puck Randall, tomboy daughter of old Rip, the cowman, and the critter was her pet, Joker. Puck was relieved to find Mike cheerful. She considered it safe to put in an appear- ance and hoped he had forgotten the un- fortunate episode of their last meeting.  But the minute Mike clapped eyes on the two dusty tramps his whiskers bristled and he bellowed, "So it's you, dad blarst you! Git afore I tan your slippery hides!"  Mike must have been more attached to that sourdough jar than Puck had realized. On their visit a week ago Joker hadn't meant to get his head stuck in the jar and smash it against a tree. He'd only wanted to sample the sour dough. And he hadn't meant to bust Mike's best dishes. He couldn't help it if they came crashing about his ears when he nibbled the oilcloth along the kitchen shelf.   75
