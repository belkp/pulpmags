8 The Highest Law THERE were nurses there and a doctor, and I heard them say they'd keep me under observation in the psychopathic ward till they found out if I was sane. And anyway I was under arrest for trying to kill myself. I was so weak I could only half-open my eyes and listen, but I couldn't say a word. Then I saw something that kind of wiped the blur away from my eyes and made me want to scream. "My Pete ... and another stretcher.. and on it a black-haired girl!" him go up to the doctor in the white uniform, and I heard him say that the girl was his wife, Edna Grey, and that she had gone suddenly insane, and ho wanted them to keep her there until her sanity was tested. Then he gave his name as Howard Grey, and his address as Riverside Drive. I fainted again. IT was night before I was conscious once more. That something was my Pete stand- ing in the doorway, though he wasn't looking at me. He had his big over- coat on and a slouch hat pulled down over his face, so that it hid his glass eye--but I recognized him at once. Just behind him was another stretcher, like the one I was lying on . . . and in it was a girl with her eyes shut, and her black hair all tumbled about a silk dressing gown she wore. She was so white, I thought maybe she was dead. I tried to move and call to Pete, but I couldn't; I just lay there and watched This time I saw I was in a big, higli- ceilinged room, with gray-painted walls and a cement floor without any carpets. There was a dim light burning in the center, just over my head, and I could see a couple of windows near-by, with bars over them. All around me were white iron beds and on them were women, some of them strapped down with twisted sheets, most of them groaning and making a lot of horrible noises. I found that my own hands were tied to my sides with sheets, and the wrist I'd slashed hurt something fierce.
