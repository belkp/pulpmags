THE TEAKWOOD BOX 361 in his thumb, as though he had put it in a fire of hot coals. A strange numbness ran through his arm. He stared down at the table to see a neatly-concealed needle, probably hollow, slowly retreating into the side of the box; in the same glance he saw that the teakwood curio was empty, contained nothing. Blood was on his thumb, dripping from under the finger-nail, where seemed to be an inflamed, tiny wound. He heard a peculiar, spine-stiffening cackle, on the same penetrating high key as the whistle. First it came spasmodically, but broke down into a low gurgle, a sucking sound. The thief's heart seemed to bloat and swell, yet tried to beat faster; Joe clutched at his hot brow with clammy, weak hands. Young San Pedro Joe, a short time ago successful light-finger man, fell dead on the kitchen floor. The white light shone on his ill-proportioned, slight body. For a moment, there seemed a slight rustling. A dirty, filth-incrusted window banged open. But all was quiet outside in the hot, choking night air. To Howard Phillips Lovecraft Master-writer of the weird, essayist, poet, 1890-1937 By FRANCIS FLAGG He lived--and now is dead beyond all knowingOf life and death: the vast and formless schemeBehind the face of nature ever showingHas swallowed up the dreamer and the dream.But brief the hour he had upon the streamOf timeless time from past to future flowingTo lift his sail and catch the luminous gleamOf stars that marked his coming and his goingBefore he vanished: yet the brilliant wakeHis passing left is vivid on the tideAnd for the countless centuries will abide:The genius that no death can ever takeCrowns him immortal, though a man has died.
