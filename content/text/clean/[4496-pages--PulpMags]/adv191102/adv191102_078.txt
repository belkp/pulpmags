A Samaritan of the Riverine 641 Credit of over eleven hundred thousand dollars gold! "Underneath was a letter from Major- General A. Berkintowitz. First he resigned. Then he explained that when he found the Torres money was no good he and Joey could not sleep of nights till they laid a plan to make it good. He deserted to Torres to give the old man the idea to be president and how to do it. Joey had staid only to get the last hundred thousand, the promised insurance. The only reason he had induced Torres to have me come to take charge of the customs was that I, having paid over the phony money, would surely be the last to charge him with dishonesty if he changed the Torres paper money for Torres gold customs receipts. "Gentlemen, under that letter was the pile of notes I had bought from Duncan for a poker-set, and the balance was figured to a penny at the prevailing rate of exchange. The rest had gone to France in Joey's boxes. Of course I had to take one of the gunboats and get myself over to Curasao before Torres called for the money to pay the army. I thought I'd heard the last of those fellows until this old smooth-bore went off to-night. There hangs the other one. ' ' Jimmie took down the old piece, broke it and out flew a nicked ball-cartridge. "And neither one ever fired a shot!" A SAMARITAN OF THE RIVERINE by Randolph Bedford IN THE wild, burning sheep-walk of Central-Eastern Australia, watered by the mighty Darling and sundry smaller and deceitful streams; where the Winter is a flood; where the Summer is a furnace, and the sun and the baked dust and the parched gums are of a uniform dull red; and where the early Spring is as delicate as its sister seasons are fierce, the Samaritan of the Riv- erine lived in the body. And there he lives in the memory even unto this day. But the people of the rivers did not gen- erally know him as the Samaritan, nor do they. His real name was Stephen Been. The wags styled him "The Has Been."
