  WEIRD TALES 115    countered Revell, "that this Isphahan which you treasure as an antique was painfully new in the days when good old Shah Abbas was so partial to fine weav- ing and inventing new designs.

"But, damn it, I tell you--"  "Ah yes, surely. Nevertheless, I insist that the appreciation of antiques is an Occidental taste, and one which is jolly well artificial.

He knows his litany now; but he wasn't born that way."  Revell scored.  "But bin Ayyub is a cultured gentle- man. I'll take you out to his house, and then you'll be convinced about it all, in- cluding his being a descendant of Saladin."  "Very well, have it your own way.

"Not that I doubted your word. But in all honesty, old onion, can you blame me for being a shade skeptical? When even the Shall's palace in Teheran is cluttered with gilt bric-Ã -brac, and modern Sultanieh rugs, and all that sort of atrocious thing. Beastly taste these beggars show.
