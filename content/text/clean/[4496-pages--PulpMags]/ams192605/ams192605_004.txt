COPYRIGHT ACKNOWLEDGMENT "Off on a Comet," and "A Trip to the Center of the Earth" by Jules Verne, copyright 1911, by Vincent Parke and Co., (Parke, Austin and Lipscomb Co.) In Our Next Issue: "DOCTOR HACKENSAW'S SECRETS." by Clement Fezandi√©, by popular requests. A new and hitherto un- published story of the great and illustrious Dr. Hackensaw, which can not fail to hold your interest from start to finish "THE RUNAWAY SKYSCRAPER," by Murray Lein- ster, a story of the Fourth Dimension, in which the great Metropolitan Life skyscraper in New York vanishes into the Fourth Dimension. One of the most suprising tales we have ever read. (This story was scheduled for the May issue, but had to make room for the Jules Verne story). "THE SCIENTIFIC ADVENTURES OF MR. FOS-DICK," by Jack Morgan. Perhaps you did not know it, but there can be excellent humor in scientifiction. One of the most excruciatingly funny stories, which at the same time is an excellent piece of scientifiction, is en-titled "Mr. Fosdick Invents the Seidlitzmobile." "A TRIP TO THE CENTER OF THE EARTH." by Jules Verne, (second installment), wherin our heroes have now penetrated to subterranean depths and find a tremendous number of surprises. "WHISPERING ETHER," by Charles S. Wolfe, a radio story that holds your interest and injects quite a few new thoughts into a well-known subject. One of the greatest short stories we have ever seen. (This story also was due for publication in May, and was crowded out by the conclusion of the Jules Verne story, "Off On a Comet").  Another weird story by Edgar Allen Poe, which we are sure you will like. HOW TO SUBSCRIBE FOR "AMAZING STORIES."
