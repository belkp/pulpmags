112 The Too-Easy Alibi from his mouth; the sounds were the fear-filled, desperate, horrified screams of a trapped animal that knows it can- not escape. For, upon the fire-escape, peering into the room, was Pug! The knife was still imbedded in the bootlegger's body; it had not been dislodged from the time Joe had forced the stiletto to its mark. Even though Pug had crawled to the window for assistance, had leaned out, and had fallen down the fire-escape to the floor below, the knife had remained implanted in his flesh. Joe saw the man he had killed; saw Pug looking in through the window. Now, Pug was not ludicrously sur- prised. Instead, ferocious hate glared from his features, devilish anger- stared from his sightless eyes. And in one cold hand Pug held a torn bit of newspaper which bore the words "I O U 5 Little Joe." There was no need to accuse Joe of the crime; no need to seek for in- criminating evidence. His screams had reached a pitch that sounded as though his vocal chords were being tom from his throat by the strain. He proclaimed his guilt in horrible noises. He forgot that his alibi was perfect; forgot every- thing but Pug's loathsome, leering face. Joe's wild screams betrayed him, and Cummings knew that he was in the presence of the man who had killed Pug. Later, of course, Joe was calmed by opiates, and his confession written down. But the confession, and the bit of newspaper found in Pug's lifeless hand, were only corroborative evidence. The thing that destroyed Joe's perfect alibi, that broke down his feeling of safety, and that finally sent him to the electric chair was Pug's face staring through the window from the fire- escape.
