For a moment I saw only the great snow field that stretched off to the horizon, dazzling white in the sunlight. Then I saw some- thing else. M'sieuwhat I am going to tell you may sound strange, but I swear by the saints it is true. You may say that providence does not bring about such coincidences as to lead a heart-broken lover, wandering over the northland, to a hidden cabin on a stormy night just in time to--ah, say what you will, m'sieu, I swear it is true, that there, streaking off across the white plain, like twin threads, I saw two trails, a man's and a woman's, that spun away toward the south, where they merged with the horizon haze in the distance.

Then, with my Sense of direction restored, I turned toward my own country. That, m'sieu, is all I know of the mat- ter.
