THE DOOR INTO INFINITY 153 of it into pure air. They were in the darkness, floating in the tunnel beyond the block, the current carrying them swiftly onward. The walls were shaking and roaring frightfully about them as they were borne round the turns of the tunnel. Then they saw ahead of them a circle of dim light, pricked with white stars. The current bore them out into that starlight, into the open sea. Before them in the water floated Sturt, and they swam with him out from the shaking, grinding cliffs. The girl stirred a little in Ennis' grasp, and he saw in the starlight that her face was no longer dazed. ''Paul-" she muttered, clinging close to Ennis in the water.

Look!" cried the inspector, pointing back at the black cliffs. In the starlight the whole cliff was col- lapsing, with a prolonged, terrible roar as of grinding planets, its face breaking and buckling.
