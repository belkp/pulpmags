WHY is so much space given to plans of cities ?—is " TheMask" taking up archeology—What have plans of citiesto do with the Theatre? Many a time have we heard thisasked; and we feel that there is time now for a word about why itis done.•3?LONDON, Paris and Roma have once been the three centres ofthings Dramatic. The Dramatists, the Theatres, the Scenogra- phers and the performers of Roma, of Paris and of London did some- thing towards bringing these three cities into the condition in which wefind them in the 18th century Plans of Nolli, Turgot and Horwood.For this reason alone it is impossible to over-look the value ofsuch plans.And consider for a moment how great is the influence of a cityupon these people of the Theatres, and how important to us lookingfor them now to know the place they lived in. To be as impressio- nable as poets, as courageous as actors, is to be daily at the call ofthe city. Environment, as a hundred essayists have pointed out, is apowerful factor in the shaping of the destiny of a man or woman.La Gabrielli or Metastasio in Roma, Garrick or Sheridan in London,and Talma or Beaumarchais in Paris do not go about with eyes closedbut open: they draw into themselves and absorb into their systemvery possible impression;—they must be forgiven for so often havingooked on these three cities as set stages. And so if we want to know more of these playwrights and actorswe must turn to these plans and we will find more.Look where they walked or rode .... see what it is they saw daily.Were it but for the sake of two such people in each city theseplans would be well worth possessing. Imagine that you are writingthe life of La Gabrielli. By the aid of two of the plans you canfollow her whereabouts in Roma and in London. No longer is ita mere dream for you when you read of her entering Roma by the Portadel Popolo and driving to her rooms at the Hotel of Carlo Roland nearSan Carlo in Corso: and when she comes to sing in London in 17 7 5you need be no longer vague in your mind as to exactly where wasthe Opera House at which she sang.When in the same year Signora Agujari is singing at the Pantheonwe can see where-abouts it was she sang and where she went whenshe visited Dr. Burney at No. 36 St. Martin's Street which leadsfrom Leicester Square.When we read of Talma we are not content to slither over thewords which tell us that he was born in the Rue des Menetriers,later lived in Rue St. Georges No. 4: in 1821 came to live atNo. 9, Rue de la Tour des Dames and died there in 1827. Wewant to see where these places were situated.When he comes to London we are curious to see his house,13 Old Cavendish Street where he lived in 1780; his school inManchester Square where he studied, and we shall turn to the Planof London and place him.Why all this to do ? you ask. What can be the good of it ?It seems to us that it helps to make history live, and, until historyis alive, history is a dull thing.And it also helps the imagination:... besides, some of us enjoy plansThat is why these plans are being reprinted. A fresher and livelieinterest will be taken in the doings of our old friends; and we anless likely to forget they were real beings.And the streets and quais and the houses planned and built s&lt;well by excellent architects, are we to forget these too ?We even like to remember the able impresario Faliconti and tfollow his footsteps in 1 726 to and from the Teatro Capranica—i1 734 to and from the Argentina.These theatrical things are not the least of things. We will kbold enough to say that they are some of the most important, beir D closely connected with the happiness of three peoples, the Romans,Frisians and Londoners.Such records are accounted very little by some of the more diffi- ult Historians of Europe, .... and that is the gravest of pities. Noind can afford to forget the happiest hours of its people's existence;id in the past never were the peoples happier than when at thelayhouse.Let every possible record be treasured of these hours, which notily make the trials and hardships possible, but positively help a na~&gt;n to exist.These plans of cities, besides reviving in us the remembrance ofe happiness of a people, serve as invaluable allies when you areird at work writing your Histories, making your yearly income.You may not be a wealthy man and able to afford the originals.. you may not have enough room on your table to contain the threeuge volumes of Turgot, Horwood and Nolli.So that is another reason for giving so much space in 4' The Mask "&gt; these three plans: that you might have them to work from—easilyt your elbow—at a fantastically low price.You may be a Professor of English in some far off city in Ame- ica or in Canada, in Africa or in some other English Colony.Do not ask people why 4 4 The Mask" is trying to serve you andul your fellows: will you not see if you cannot them why.More especially since there must always be one or two who willeternally ask why a thing isn't other than it is, instead of discoveringthe many good reasons for themselves.Do not be one of these, but be ever our kind supporters, even aswe remain.Your faithful servants,THE MASK Publishers. LONDON AND WESTMINSTER. THE BOROUGH OF SOUTHWARK ANDPARTS ADJOINING: BY R. HORWOOD 1792-1799. Mr. HORWOOD is waiting for someoneto do him a little justice, for so faras I have been able to ascertain (andI am rather far off to be quite fair aboutthis) very few people seem to have recog- nized his powers while he lived or forvery long after his death.Fortunately he did his work so wellthat the indifference of his contemporarieshardly matters to him : yet it would havebeen easily possible for Biographical Dic- tionaries and other such lists to mentionhis name : but so rarely is Horwoodmentioned that I do not find him even inthe Dictionary of National Biography (l).Cunningham gives him one line. I am quiteignorant of his career. And I cannot pointto his dwelling in this plan of his.His work, this plan alone, informs meof his abilities. The original double plateseach measure 41 by 22 7 a inches. Thewhole plan therefore measures 1 3 feet by7 feet 5 inches.All I have been able to do is toadd for you a few theatrical facts anddates about the different houses of drama- tists and actors and actresses and criticsand the like.Some of these facts and dates appearwith the first eight plates in the presentnumber of The Mask; the remainder,with the other eight plates, will appearin the July number.My list has been made with the assis- tance of only too few books: amongst them those by Timbs, Cunningham, Pennant,Brayley, H. Barton Baker, Sir E. K.Chambers, Boaden, Miss Burney, Fitzgerald,Austin Dobson and some 30 or 40others.But this little labour had not evenbegun if I had not been presented witha copy of the great and costly plan bya friend in Banbury, obviously your friendsince by an act of this kind he makes itpossible for me to distribute to hundredsof today's students something needed bythem for over a hundred and twenty-fivyears.

A FEW FACTS AND DATES ABOUT THEATRES AND THOSE ASSOCIATED WITH THEM. c. g. e. PLATE 1A ST. MARY LE BONE.BAKER STREET.1817. Mrs Siddons lived in SiddonsHouse, looking into the Regent's Park,on the east side, at the top of thestreet; here she died, June Bth, 1831.The house was destroyed in 1903-5 ;a railway station was put up, the Com- pany agreeing to set up a tablet tocommemorate the site. PLATE 1C BLOOMSBURY.QUEEN'S SQUARE.Here between 1770 and 1774 livedDr. Barney and his family. Here cameDavid Garrick to visit them.GOWER STREET.Mrs Jordan is living here in 1788.ALFRED PLACE. Bedford Square.Sheridan Knowles lived at No. 29. PLATE 1D BAGNIGGE WELLS.COLD BATH FIELDS .A noted place of public entertainment,a kind of minor Vauxhall.Nell Gwynne is said to have hada country-house near this spot, and herbust was here in 1789, when Waldronedited Downe's Roscius Anglicanus.SADLER'S WELLS.1683. A famous old place of publicamusement: first a music house, thena theatre, and called Sadler's Wellsfrom a spring of mineral water, disco- vered by one Sadler, in 1683, in thegarden of a house which he hadnewly opened as a public music-room,and called by his own name as " Sad- ler's Music House."The New River flowed past the* theatre, and on great occasions was■ even carried under the stage, and theflooring removed, for the exhibition ofaquatic performances. Here Grimaldi,the famous clown, achieved his greatesttriumphs.In 1844 this little theatre cameunder the able management of Mr. Phelps, and for some years maintaineda well-deserved celebrity for the per- formance of the plays of Shakespeare,Beaumont and Fletcher, Massinger, &amp;c.ISLINGTON.COLEBROOK-ROW.Near by lived Charles Lamb for awhile, in Colebrook-row, close toDuncan Terrace, (64 Duncan Terrace)in what he calls 44 a detached whitish44 house close to the New River ". Ina letter to his friend R. Barton he writes :44 When you come Londonward you44 will find me no longer in Covent44 Garden ; I have a cottage in Colebrook44 Row, Islington; a cottage, for it is deta- -44 ched; a white house with six good44 rooms in it; the New River (rather44 elderly by this time) runs (if a mo- -44 derate walking pace can be so term- -44 ed) close to the foot of the house;44 and behind is a spacious garden with44 vines, (I assure you), pears, straw- -44 berries, parsnips, leeks, carrots, cab- -44 bages, to delight the heart of old44 Alcinous ".THE RED BULL THEATREThis theatre, built in 1606, stoodat the upper end of St. John-street, westof St. John-street, on what is now called44 Red-Bull-yard " or Wood Bridge street. PLATE 1E THE NURSERY.This was a school for the educa- tion of children for the stage in Gold- ing-lane, Moorfields, established in thereign of Charles 11. by William Legge,ancestor of the Earls of Dartmouth.There is a view of it by J. T. Smith,called The Queen's Nursery.FORTUNE THEATRE.This was built in 1600 by PeterStreet, a carpenter, for Philip Hen- slowe and Edward Alleyn, and stoodon the east side of Golding-lane inthe parish of St. Giles's, Cripplegate.In Alleyn's Diary is the followingentry: " 1621. Dec. 9. Md. this night att12 of the Clock the Fortune wasburnt".Collier tells us that the originalbuilding was a square construction oflath, plaster and timber. The new theatre (for it was rebuilt immediately)was circular, and built of brick andtile. The sign of the house was a* picture or figure of Fortune, In 1649,the inside of this new theatre was des- troyed by a company of soldiers seton by the sectaries of those periloustimes; and in 1661, the ground wasadvertised 44 to be let to be built upon ".It was from this theatre that Alleynderived the larger portion of the fundsfor the foundation of God's Gift Col- lege, at Dulwich. A passage, con- necting Whitecross-street with Goldinglane, is still called Playhouse-yard.BLACKFRIARS THEATRE.This was built in 1576, by JamesBurbadge and his " fellows servantsof Dudley, Earl of Leicester, in con- sequence of an act of Common Councilpassed the preceding year, prohibitingthe erection of a playhouse within thelimits of the City jurisdiction.BLACKFRI ARS.Sir Anthony Van Dyck lived inBlackfriars from the time of his comingto England in 1632 to his death in1641. The rent of his house, " at amoderate value ", was estimated, in1638, at £2O, and the tithe paid£1.6.3.Ben Jonson dates his dedication ofVolpone or The Fox "from my housein the Blackfriars, this 1 Ith day ofFebruary, 1607.ALLEYN'S ALMS HOUSES.Three sets of alms-houses in London(each for ten poor people) were builtand endowed by Edward Alleyn,(1626) the actor, and founder of God'sGift College at Dulwich : /. in Lamb- cilley, (formerly Petty France), Bi- shopsgate-street; 2. in Bath-street, (for- merly Pest-House-lane), Old-street, St.Luke's; 3. in Soap-yard, Deadman's- place, Southwark. (This last we findin Plate 3, E.)The first brick of the alms-housesin Bath-street was laid by Alleyn him- self on the 13 th of July, 1620 ; andon the 29th of April, 1621, he re- cords his having placed three men andseven women in the ten houses.They were rebuilt in 1707.BUNHILL FIELDS BURIAL GROUND.This cemetary, near Finsbury Square,was called "the Campo Santo ofthe Dissenters".Among the famous men buried herewas Daniel De Foe, (1661-1731),The entry of his burial runs: " 1731,April 26. Mr. Dubow, Cripplegate ".Here too they buried William Blake, (I 757-1827), at the distance of abouttwenty-five feet from the north wall.There was no monument in 1850. I sup- pose and hope there is some such littlerecord now.Thomas Stothard, R. A,, who diedin 1834 and who is best known byhis 44 Canterbury Pilgrimage ", a deli- berate crib from Blake, lies close to theman who was so 44 good to steal from ". PLATE 1F SHOREDITCH.THE THEATRE.In Holywell Lane, Shoreditch. Theearliest building erected in or near Lon- don purposely for scenic exhibitions,stood on 44 certain howsing and voidgrounds lying and being in Holywell,in the county of Middlesex, " let(April 13th, 1576) by Giles Alleinof Haseleigh, in Essex, gentleman, to44 James Burbadge, late of Londonjoiner ", for twenty-one years, at theyearly rent of £l4.The house was erected at the costof John Brayne, the father-in-law ofBurbadge, who advanced £6OO oncondition that Burbadge should assignto him a moiety of the theatre andits profits. That assignment does notseem to have been executed in thelifetime of Brayne, and his widowwas obliged to commence proceedingsin equity, to compel a fulfilment of thecontract. The point in dispute v/asafterwards moved to the Star Chamber,Allein, the ground-landlord, complain- ing to the Privy Council that the rentwas partly unpaid* and that CuthbertBurbadge, the son, had, Dec. 28th,1598, 44 carried the wood to theBankside, and there erected a newplayhouse with the said wood".Allein's bill was referred to FrancisBacon, Esq., whose decision was that44 the said bill is very uncertain andinsufficient, and that no further answerneed to be made thereto." ...Anotherproof that Bacon was Shakespeare.The 44 new playhouse" was, it isbelieved, the Globe, then rebuilt orenlarged.THE CURTAIN.In Holywell Lane, Shoreditch. A thea- tre built, it is thought, in 1576, and socalled from a house in Shoreditch,44 commonly called the Curtayne and44 sometime appertaining to the Priory14 of Haliwell now dissolved." Thename survives in Curtain-road.44 And neare thereunto (Holywell44 Priory) are builded two publique- 44 houses for the acting shewe of co- -44 medies, tragedies, and histories for44 recreation. Whereof one is called44 the Courtein, the other the Theatre.44 both standing on the south-west side44 towards the field " (*).The Curtain fell into disuse aboutthe commencement of the reign ofCharles I.ST. LEONARD'S.1588: 1618. Holy well-street forHoliwell) in this parish was in thereign of Queen Elizabeth and James Linhabited by players of distinction,connected with the Curtain Theatre,the Blackfriars Theatre and the Globeon the Bankside.The parish register records the in- terment of the following: Richard Tarl- ton, (d. 1588): James Burbadge (d.1596): Richard Burbadge (d. 1618):Gabriel Spenser, the player, regardingwhom, in the burial register of St. Leo- nard, Shoreditch, is the following en- try:—44 1598. Gabrieli Spencer being44 slayne, was buryed ye xxiqth of44 September. Hogge Lane44 Hogge Lane " denotes his residence.He was a player in Henslowe's com- pany of actors, and was killed inHoxton-fields in a duel with BenJonson, rare Ben Jonson.The burials of William Sly andRichard Cowley, two original perfor- mers in Shakespeare's plays, are alsoregistered here.Another original performer in Sha- kespeare's plays who lived in Holy- well-street, was Nicholas Tooley (2).HACKNEY.Strype, the historian, was lecturerat Hackney from 1689 till 1724, anddied in 1737, in his 97th year. PLATE 2A EDGEWARE ROAD.Oliver Goldsmith once lived here fora while.In the Road from Uxbridge we seea row of houses in front of St. Geor- ge's Burying Ground. These I believewere called St. George's Row, andabout 1837 became Hyde Park Place,In 1895 or thereabouts, I remembercalling at the second house west ofthe Chapel, No. 19, to see the dra- matic critic Mr. Max Beerbohm. Thehouse nearest to the Chapel was thatof Rope the confectioner who supplied the finest wedding breakfasts of thetime, even superior to those of Gunter.MANCHESTER SQUARE.This is on the north side of Oxford- street and was begun in 1776 by thebuilding of 44 Manchester House ' onits north side. It was finished in 1788.Here it was that Mr. Prendergasthad a school about 1780 to whichTalma went. (J)PORTMAN SQUARE.Montague House in the north-westangle of the square was built for Mrs.Montague, (1 720-1800), authoress ofthe Vindication of Shakespeare againstVoltaire.

Here in 1799 itis clearly numberless, both 15 and 16being further along.44 I saw Byron for the last time in44 1815. He dined or lunched with 44 me at Long's in Bond-Street. I44 never saw him so full of gaiety and44 good-humour, to which the presence44 of Mr. Mathews, the comedian, ad- -44 ded not a little. Poor Terry (the44 actor) was also present 0)At No. 18 was once Stevens's Ho- tel, but not numbered here. EvidentlyHotels were skipped in 1799, for inTallis's Views No. 18 is markedclearly enough.44 During the first months of our44 acquaintance we (Byron and Moore)14 frequently dined together alone ; and44 as we had no club in common to44 resort to— the Alfred being the only44 one to which he at that period be- -44 longed, and I being then a member44 of none but Watier's—our dinners44 used to be at the St Alban's, or at44 his old haunt, Stevens's (2)In 1793 and before Sir ThomasLawrence lived at No, 24 in 1794until 1804 at No. 29.At No. 29 was the Library ofMessrs Ebers &amp; Co. at which boxesfor the Opera were booked. Mr. JohnEbers was for some years the managerof the King's Theatre in the Hay- market, losing £44,000 on the under- taking. He died on Dec. Bth 1858at Notting Hill Terrace. HarrisonAinsworth (Ebers's son-in-law) whobecame a publisher at No. 27, issuedin 1828 an interesting book on thisseven years venture.To No. 30, corner of Stafford-street,came John Mitchell the theatrical agentin 1834 when the number became 33.In 1813 Lady Hamilton li ves atNo. 130.In 181 1 Madame Catalani was at143 now occupied by Savory &amp; Moore.In September 1730 Lavinia Fenton,the original Polly in the 44 Reggais*Opera ", came to live in Bond-street,taking the house in which Lady Eli- zabeth Wentworth li 'ed.About 1780 Mrs Robinson (44 Per- dita ") was living in Cork-street offBond -street.SAVILLE STREET.In 1816 Richard Brinslsy Sheridandied in the front bedroom of No. 17.In a short note to Mr. Rogers, May15th, 1836, six weeks before his death,he says— :44 They are going to put the44 carpets out of window and break into44 Mrs . S.'s room and take me; for44 God's sake let me see you ".A present of £ 150 from Mr. Ro- gers arrived in time. Sheridan hadpreviously li/ed in No. 14. In 1791 Lord Barry more has a pri- vate Theatre in Saville Street called44 Varies Amusantes " ; and in No- vember Haydn visits it and writesin his Diary, 44 The Puppets were wellmanaged, the singers bad, but the or- chestra tolerably good Boxes cost5/ ; Pit 3/ ; Doors open at 7begins at 8.LOWER GROSVENOR STREET.In 1730 Mrs. Nancy Oldfield, theactress, died here.UPPER AND LOWER BROOKSTREET.Handel lived at No. 57 (now 25)in the house which in 1850 becameMr. Partington's 44 on the south sideof Brook-street", in 1799 three doorsfrom Bond-street, now four doors I be- lieve.

The clamour however increasing, and noauthority stopping the stupidity whichwas called " liberty" of free speechat the time, Giffard was induced toremove in 1735 to Lincoln's-Inn-fields.Here he remained two seasons, thenreturned to his old quarters (the twoor five objectors obviously havinggone to Heaven), and on the 19thof October, 1741, had the ho- nour to introduce to an Aldgate au- dience, David Garrick (1717-1779),who made his first appearance on a Lon- don stage in Goodman's-fields Theatrein the character of Richard HI. Gar- rick lodged in Mansfield-street at thattime.Now had the three or six objectorsgone on objecting, the whole of Lon- don might have been cheated of theliveliest mind in the 18th centurytheatre.The theatre in which Garrick ap- peared was pulled down about 1746.Another theatre on the same spot, ofwhich there are views by Capon, wasburnt down in June 1802.ROYALTY; THEATRE, Well StreetWellclose Square,This was built by Cornellius Dixonand J.

He plies aJ. trade that can be learned by all andis regularly practised by too many. Therules of his craft are simple, if indeedthe re be any rules. With less practicethan the drawing-room pianist or theamateur cricketer, with one-tenth of theexpenditure of time and thought needfulto play a tolerable hand at bridge, withone-hundredth of the spiritual zest thatturns a village blacksmith into a localpreacher, an actor may stand upon thestage and interpret for us the things ofthe imagination. His range of voice andmovement is seldom greater than that ofthe practised political speaker; his sense ofpresence may be matched by any ladyreceiving an afternoon call. His physicalfitness, as shown in bright eyes and whiteteeth, a clear skin, a firm carriage andan elastic step, is hardly more remarkablethan that of a good average spectator.Even his tailor is seldom more accom- plished than the tailor of the best-dressedoccupant of the stalls. By what right does this man walk divinely before hisfellow-men? The actor is a representa- tive of his audience—a representative ofthe finer type, maybe, but a representa- tive. He is not a different order ofbeing, but one of ourselves. He stoopsto our gestures, he employs our slang, hecondescends to our conventional tones, hebends to touch our commoner emotions.The actor is the typical looker-on; he isthe man in the stalls brought on to thestage. The more nearly he represents us,the more clearly is he self-confessed asamateur. The end of naturalistic acting,whether in tragedy or comedy or farce,is amateurism. When the actor's laughter nolonger shakes the theatre, when his figureno longer towers above us with gesturesof antique greatness, then indeed he and wetogether are amateurs; for we deserve notheatre and he deserves no audience.The actor is a professional. He is aman with a calling, a man inspired, aman possessed. He is impelled to giveform to a conception of character, he isdriven to enter another's spirit and laughand weep with him. He is destined to represent man in movement, "in actionhow like an angel, in apprehension how likea god»" He unfolds the meaning of actionand discovers rhythm in the stumbling gaitof events. He lends bodily vitality, the bloomof health and the spirit of energy to all thecreatures of his fancy. He animates the por- trait of a sick man; we hang upon thelips of the imaginary bores and dullardswho are transfigured by his art. Thisprofessional pride of the actor sur- vives a decadence of the stage. It en- dures through period after period, classicaland romantic, naturalistic, prosaic, poetic.Behind the amateurism that overspreadsour theatre, behind the lifeless gesturesof realistic habit and the meaninglessmarch and countermarch of conventionalmovement, we see the steadfast figure ofthe interpreter. Behind the pretence ofthe mirror we see the reality of themask. The art of acting is greater thanthe actor; it lifts him above the level ofamateurism to which our realists wouldreduce him. Among all the feeble im- pulses of the stage we are conscious, hereand there, of the swift intake of thebreath of inspiration. There is no otheracting but inspired acting, whether it betragic or comic or farcical; the rest isvanity of vanities.The uninspired actor (otherwise theamateur) does not play his part; he re- presents it with the help of an academicand superficial technique. At the besthe gives the mask of caricature to a figurethat he fails inwardly to comprehend, afigure that may even be unworthy ofcomprehension. He seeks for a fashionahletype into which he can mould his ownpersonality. He goes from manager tomanager and from comedy to comedy withhis type ready-made; and each finds ause for him, since the audience must havestyle at all costs, and caricature is a form of style. His mannerisms, which shouldbe the legitimate byplay of his art, be- come in time his entire stock-in-trade.The sound middle actor, without the giftof caricature or the instinct for originalportraiture, chooses a sound middle per- formance from his wardrobe of experienceas a man chooses a jacket. Authors andproducers do not bother him; the partfits him and that suffices. He is closelyakin to the " character actor," whoseaim is to portray everything but character—accent, appearance, gesture, habit, mari- ner, all that is easy and unessential. Forthese performers the (art of acting is akinto the painter's art in the academic orstory-telling picture. The author tells hisstory and they assist him faithfully by tel- ling theirs; here the matter begins andends. Of a conception of drama largerthan that of the " dramatic " scene, ofan inner technique of acting deeper thanthe outer technique of tone and gestureand facial play, they do not begin to think.Theirs is the small change of acting, con- venient in the pocket, eloquent on thecounter, readily given, readily accepted.But the capital of the actor is inspiration.The everyday theatre pretends to re- present actual experience. It tries toshow us " by electric light, in a roomwith three walls, how ordinary peopleeat, drink, love, walk, and wear theirjackets." It stands or falls with the ve- risimilitude of the life it reproduces; thisis made the test of drama and actingalike. The advertisement of a monthlymagazine declares that " there is no storyso fascinating as a True Story." Wemay smile at the crudity of the sentiment,but it is widely approved. A dramaticmurder trial or a dramatic divorce suitwill momentarily play the theatre off thestage; and even Drury Lane is playedoff the stage by Ascot. But in effect actual experience remains the corner-stoneof the realistic theatre. The actor repre- sents an emotional experience that he issupposed to have undergone. Is he abetter actor for having personally under- gone it? The realistic theory maintainsthat he is, and realistic practice supportsit, for the endeavour of the actor is torepresent the experience as personal tohimself (i.e., personal to his sympatheticaudience). An actress depicts the re- morse of adultery. Is she a better actressfor having herself, at some time, been anunfaithful wife ? Here the de; ender ofrealism protests publicly that the questionis unfair, since it arouses irrelevant moralprejudices ; but privately and confidentiallyhe will assert that she is. Let us go astep farther. An actor depicts the remorseof a murderer. Is he a better actor forhaving himself committed a murder? Doubt- less he would be, replies the realist, butwe must draw the line of logic somewhere;life would be too dangerous if every stagecrime required a rehearsal in reality. Theactor can go to a murder trial at the OldBailey (where, indeed, we often hear ofhim as a spectator); he can pick up hisbits of " local colour " on the Embank- ment or in the alleys of Chinatown. Hecan reproduce the reality of emotionalexperience, though it be at second-hand.He can defend the banality of the storyhe tells by pleading that it is true. Weare reminded of the conventional portraitistwho asks " Do you know Lady B? "or"Do you know X? as he shows usround the canvases of his studio. Weknow X. and Lady 8., and recognise theirlikenesses at once, to the painter's obviouspleasure. But is this recognition the objectof the art of painting ? Is faithful por- traiture, daubed with local colour, the aimof the art of acting ? It has been saidthat a good portrait is one in which we recognise the painter. A good piece ofacting is one in which we recognise anactor (neither type nor individual, but ar- tist). The perception of this truth mustprofoundly alter our point of view regar- ding the theatre. The drama of realisticpersonal experience, with all its elaboratetechnique of expression, falls to the ground,and in its place stand only a few symbolserected by the aspirations of the audience,the imagination of the dramatist, and theinspiration of the player.These symbols, however, are lasting,while the unwieldy structure of the theatreas we know it is visibly breaking down.The symbols rest upon agreement betweenpartners; the theatre of to-day rests upona disagreement that is becoming an openbreach. What is drama itself but aneverlasting symbol ? Does anyone believethat our theatre fifty years hence will re- semble our theatre of to-day?—a stuffylittle hall lined with plush seats, a trenchfor the orchestra, a proscenium arch withrows of electric lights, a scene set withthree walls of painted canvas? The im- provements in mechanical contrivance alonewill revolutionise that stage for us. Theunchanging qualities of the stage are thesymbols that spring from passion, wit andpoetry. The art of the inspired actorendures. Even in a physical sense hepossesses, with Duse and Bernhardt andEllen Terry, the secret of lasting youth.His body is disciplined and preserved bya technique of acting that subordinates;every muscle to the creative impulse.Also the conscious will of the actor pre- serves the instrument and vessel of hisart, as a ballerina preserves the supplenessof her limbs. This actor sees an innerworld. His parts are not pieced togetherfrom the rags of " local colour " andpretended realism, but are created froman imagined experience; and the act of imagination transfigures his form, beautifieshis gestures, and gives rhythm to hiswords.Show me your part, says the actor,and I will show you my inspiration. Thereis no making of bricks without straw. Evena restoration of the theatrical spirit to thetheatre demands an imaginative groundwork,a plan for the actor to build upon. Arestoration of melodrama calls for a me- lodramatist. A restoration of high comedycalls for classic graces of dialogue. Arestoration of poetic drama must be in thefirst place the work of poets. What doesour present-day theatre offer to the ambi- tious actor? It offers, as we know, asuccession of modern parts in which theactor's vices, such as his emotional " re- straint," his natural conversational tones,his accent of unimpeachable gentility, histimid and ordinary gestures, will be ac- counted virtues; while his real virtues,such as his ability to fill the stage, hisskilful manipulation of his own naturalmask, his bold exaggeration of outline inthe portrayal of character, his physical•domination of the audience, in a word hiscreation of the part, are as likely as notto make him thoroughly ridiculous. Hewill be praised for being " natural " andblamed (God save us!) for being " ar- tificial."The art that conceals art, in the smugohrase, is the only art that will be al- lowed him. He may, however, be per- mitted occasional brief incursions into theElizabethan theatre, or rather into the mo- dernized theatre of Shakespeare, where hehas barely time to unlearn the faults ofelocution and carriage acquired in moderncomedy before the run of the play comesto an end and he reverts to the world ofslang and back-chat.It is said that we have few Shake- spearean actors, and none who can speak blank verse effectively. But how shouldany young actor be able to speak verse,how should any young actor be able toplay Shakespeare, when the whole envi- ronment of his art is prosaic ? If hewould bear himself like a Duke of Athensor Malvolio, he must betake himself towatch the Russian Ballet in Petrouchkaor Carnaval, for he will not capture thespirit of dignity in the stage drawing-room.If he would speak his lines like a god andnot like an Oxfordian oracle, he mustlisten to good music in the concert-room,for he will not pick up the art at rehearsal.Let the actor watch the Guards at thetrooping of the Colour or the motionlessLancers seated on their charges in Whitehall. Here is presence, here is plastique;but how were they acquired ? By monthsin the barrack-yard and the riding-school;by grinding labour, by the daily perseve- rance that is itself a tyranny. Let theactor betake himself to the gymnasium,for he will not capture presence or dignityon the golf-links. It is not the loose- limbed, easy gesture of the tweed-cladathlete that counts on the stage, but thetaut muscle and the poise of the discus- thrower. Work and again work, rehearsaland again rehearsal, health and physicaldomination; these are the watchwords.To be every inch a king is first ofall to be every inch an actor. We hearof players who go into training for theirparts, who walk or swim or ride so andso many miles a day for physical fitness*sake. They do well, but there is amental training also. There is the plasticworld of Art to which the actor properlybelongs and with which he must himselfbe in harmony.These matters, it may be said, arefor schools of acting to consider. Theschools instruct their pupils in dramatictechnique; the schools distinguish carefully between Shakespearean and modern me- thods of representation. It is not theirfault if their pupils neglect the soundadvice of the dramatic pedagogue. Butin fact the schools fit novices to gain ex- perience ; they can do no more. Theyreflect the spirit of the theatre at large,tinged with a certain conservatism that isproper to academies. At a dramaticschool the actor will learn little that isfresh and much that is out of date. Hewill be prepared for the stage as a manis prepared for life by the school or uni- versity ; the serious work then begins.This is not to say that schools of actingare needless. On the contrary, theywere never more urgently needed thanto-day, when the stage is overcrowdedwith masquerading amateurs. As prepa- ratory schools for the current theatre,under the guidance of accomplished andpainstaking actors, they have both theiradvantages and their drawbacks; but asschools of gymnastics and elocution, musicand rhythm, of all the humanities thatare kindred to the classical art of acting,they will be eventually the nursery andhope of the stage.An actor speaks to us through sym- bols of reality, just as a poet speaks tous through images and metaphors. If themetaphors be borrowed or worn-out, noresponsive image appears in the listener'smind. The voices that roll " like distantthunder " awaken no echo; the inky nightand the rosy dawn fade into a neutraland muddy hue. There is a limit to thereceptivity of the human mind, where suchfigures of speech are concerned; a momentcomes when even the name of dragonconjures up no picture of frightfulness. Soit is, surely, with the symbols that theactor employs. He borrows from theworld of reality in order to create a worldof appearance; there is the essence of his art. He seeks for enduring symbols thatshall express the relation of appearance toreality—for style and gesture, tone andpresence that shall maintain a just propor- tion between the actual and the imaginary.He is confronted by a whole propertyroom of conventional symbols that are longago worn threadbare, like the phrases ofthe novelette. For every emotional emer- gency, for every situation, for every turnand twist of character, the histrionichang in readiness. There is a fitting forevery figure. The spectator, aware of theemptiness and banality of these symbolsthat he has seen a hundred times, callsthem " theatrical " and thus lays the blameupon the theatre for what is in fact theplayer's want of imagination.But the symbols of the theatre cannotbe other than theatrical. Every endea- vour to make them " real " reverses theactor's natural process by re-creating aworld of sham reality from that of ap- pearance. The presence of real donkeys;or real water on the stage gives pleasureto large audiences, but it can scarcely beheld to diminish the " theatricality " of aperformance. The actors of the GrandGuignol smear themselves with red ochreto represent a bleeding wound, but theconvention does not bring them one stepnearer to naturalism. Our quarrel shouldbe, not with the theatrical spirit that isproper to the theatre, but with the pre- tentious realism that marks a lack of anyspirit at all. The enduring symbols ofthe actor's art are artificial, like the en- during monuments of the sculptor. Tocover them with everyday rags and tat- ters is to mistake their whole significance.It is asked, how can the actor escapefrom realism? Is not he, of all artists,most deeply committed to the portrayal ofactual life in movement ? Is not he, ofall artists, the one who needs most ur- gently to feel the firm rock of experiencebeneath his feet? Are there not greatplayers, like Duse, in whom the dramaof the three-wailed room with its natu- ralistic conventions has kindled an unexam- pled flame of genius? Shall the actor,whose task it is faithfully to play the partallotted to him, shatter the fabric of dramaon which he depends? The answer isthat the fabric is shattered and rebuilt byevery true actor's performance. Duse'sHedda Gabler and Mrs. Alving andLady of the Sea were not the heroinesknown to the reader of Ibsen, althoughafter her performance their memory maybe ineffaceable. They were successiveincarnations of a passionate spirit who un- derstood them all, and, therefore, estab- lished an imperious right to play them inher own fashion.The actor requires, indeed, to feel thecontact of experience, but it may verywell be a spiritual expet ience such as ani- mated this gifted woman. The actor isindeed committed to the portrayal of lifeas we know it, but if his work be welldone we should feel that we have neverknow it before. It is in this act ofreaching out to the unknown that theplayer makes his individual and sublimegestures. A single step out of the rut,and he is saved. A flash of perceptionthat the part he plays is created and notimitated, a touch of the selfless spirit thatseeks expression and not repetition, andthe actor stands before us once more asa figure significant and dominant, a sphinxand an interpreter, a priest and a worship- per, a player with a right to the stage.

FRANCESCO 11, Duke of Modena (,), fore- seeing a long truce from warfare, andhappy years of peace assured to the stateby the treaty of the Pyranees, devoted him- self to ensuring prosperity to letters and thearts. Not content with having protectedartists and poets in the past, he conceivedin 1 685 the idea of having a theatre erectedto the east of the ducal palace, where alrea- dy, in the middle of the century, there hadbeen constructed a little Court theatre whichhad later disappeared. He entrusted thedirection of the works to the architectTomaso Brezzi and the painter Frances- co Stringa. Painters from Bologna, Reg- gio and Modena were summoned in largenumbers to contribute their work towardsthe decoration of the theatre, the prepa- ration of the scenes: among others whoworked in the new Court theatre werethe two Bibienas, the Fleming Pietro Se- nau, Agostino Stringa, Jacopo Consetti,Tomaso Costa and Antonio Fornasari.The works, carried on with feverish in- tensity by troops of masons, carpenters the interior of the theatre was entirelyof wood—and gilders, were completed inthe following spring.I have discovered a letter of G. B.Ruini, dated March 21 st 1686, in whichhe describes with some detail the openingperformance. The " Eritrea e gV ingannidella maschera " of the Count G. B. Ro- selli was being staged, and sumptuouscostumes, embroidered in silver and gold,were prepared for the actors, and machinesconstructed for apparitions and flightssuch as to produce the sensation " ratherof the divine than of the human The6th of March 1686, the anniversary ofthe Duke's birth, was fixed for the so- lemn inauguration, but just in those daysFrancesco 11. was seized with an attackof gout. For this reason the opening wasput off until the 13th of March.This untoward circumstance producedsome disappointment among the numerousvisitors drawn to Modena by the bruit ofthe preparations and by the solemnity ofthe spectacle. Three gentlemen of theBolognese family of the Marsigli hadarrived with a following of seventy per- sons on horseback, and Donna Cristina," vanquisher of the most obdurate hearts ",had made a solemn entry with a cortegeof fifty cavaliers. It is calculated that theladies and gentlemen gathered for theevent numbered four hundred. But notone of them departed when the postpone- ment of the inauguration of the newtheatre became known.On the morning of the 13 th all re- sorted to the ducal palace to form anescort to the Duke, who wished to repairon foot to hear mass in the church of theJesuits. But the magnificent multitudewas again disappointed : the Duke, notyet recovered, had to go out in a car- riage, and thus the visitors, who wouldhave accompanied him on either hand and in the rear, were obliged to forego the dis- play both to others and to themselves ofthe unusual spectacle of a gorgeous cortege.But, although deprived of the sight of theMost Serene Duke, the good Modenesewere able none the less to satisfy theircuriosity in admiring the group of magni- ficent guests who followed the ducal car- riage at a distance, likewise making theirway to the church of the Jesuits, as thoughthe mass were the first number on the pro- gramme prepared for the inauguration of theCourt theatre. The most brilliant amongthem all was the Prince Luigi d'Este,who, by the richness of his dress, " leftthe spectators for a good while in ecstasyIn the afternoon a touiney was givenin the piazza, under the leadership of thissame Prince Luigi. These feats of armswere the object of a certain citizen pride;and the spectators participated eagerlyin a fine blow or in the disappointmentover some thrust at the expense of itsown champions. Thus, while the princesof the house of Este had proved themselves,by valour and grace of movements, " Prin- ces verily Estenese ", a Modenese cham- pion, the marchese Bonifacio Rangoni,captain of the Duke's guard, " while hewas intent on cutting off the head of a cer- tain Mermaid (l), or rather, as others morecertainly say, after having cut it ", slippedhis foot from one of his stirrups and letfall his sword. A very grave fault for a champion fighting in a tourney, " a shame- ful thing in a cavalier ", and which pro- duced great bitterness in his fellow citizens.After the jousts were over, all theladies and the cavaliers repaired to thetheatre to witness the " Eritrea perfor- med by the gentlemen of the EstenseCourt. " Eritrea, queen of Cyprus " wasthe Conte Antonio Scapinelli, gentlemanof the chamber to the Prince Cesare, andCelinda " the cavaliere Nicolo Martelli.Those gentlemen who undertook femaleparts must have been very well made upas there was one who dared to assumethe scanty vestments of the goddess Ve- nus, and who was the conte Ippolito Ca- randini.The opera was followed by ballets.Everything contributed to render marvel- lous the spectacle in which one did notknow whether to admire most the splen- dours of the scenes, and costumes, andthe marvel of the machines, or the rich- ness of the dresses, the headdresses, thejewels, displayed by the crowd of elegantlady spectators.Nor was there lacking a fresh proof ofthe lordliness of the house of Este in theprofusion of refreshments and sweetmeatswhich were offered to the spectators inthe intervals of the performance, while theDuke himself was pleased to distribute tothe guests delicious candies brought inforty " royal basins So that the guests,Ruini assures us, went away bearing theindelibly impressed memory of the gene- rosity of the Duke.After this solemn inuauguration the thea- tre remained closed for some time. Butthe Modenese long continued to discourseupon this unforgettable fete. We are,however, in the seventeenth century : thecentury of the academies and of disserta- tions. A little book was printed whichdescribed tirelessly the marvels of the tour- ney. And in the meantime there wereresumed the usual gatherings of those Aca- demicians known as the " Dissonanti ",who discoursed interminably upon subjectsthe most arduous or the most trilling, ac- cording as one likes to consider them.Six days after the inauguration of theCourt theatre the academicians gatheredto hold forth upon the following theme:"If in Woman virtue may be foundcompatible with vice ". The Duke, whowas evidently a person of wit, when heknew that such a theme was proposed,foreseeing that someone, in sustaining hisown thesis, might launch some pointeddart at the fair sex, gave orders to theacademicians that they should not issuethe usual invitations to the ladies whowere accustomed to be present at thosefashionable reunions as today they gatherat live o'clock tea in some Lyceum. TheDuke added, however, that if, although notinvited, some lady should repair to theacademy, she should not be sent away.Curiosity regarding the proposed themenaturally attracted a large throng of ladies,more numerous than had they been express- ly invited. Some of them, hearing fromthe orators such a succession of back- handed compliments directed against them,were unable to restrain fiery words, whichdid not escape some of the academicians.These then hastened to ask them bywhom they had been invited, to whichthese indiscreet ladies did not know whatto reply ;... such are the surprises whicheven today await certain imprudent per- sons who affect intellectuality so as to follow7the fashion, and who lack good sense,the most necessary endowment of a woman.It seems to me that those ladies wouldhave acted better in taking part in therepresentation of the " Eritrea" ratherthan in pushing into the space reservedto the public in an academic sitting. Each in his own place: they shouldhave left to those cavaliers the illusion ofphilosophising, even upon feminine virtuesand vices,... no different from male ones,... ;and should, the rather, have preventedany of these from usurping their place,daring even to represent on the stage thepart of the mother of Love.Venus triumphant would have bettertamed those disgruntled academicians.

(l) We give here an explanation* of this quoted passagefrom Ruini's letter which has been received from the authorof the article, in reply to a query whether the context in theoriginal suggested the actual cutting oft of a head, or merelycutting at it. Ed." The phrase " to cut off the head of a certain Mermaidor '1 after having cut off her head " (it is a phrase quotedfrom the letter of Gr. B. Ruini, March 21, 1686), refers, accor- ding to me, actually to the cutting off of the head; that is,to the decapitation of a mythological being such as is theMermaid. It must have been a Mermaid of papier-mache, ofwood, or of some other material, moved perhaps by humanbeings concealed in its interior. It was in fact one of thosemany " monsters n which appeared frequently in the tourneysof mythological theme, so frequent in the seventeenth century.The victory of the knight over the Mermaid was evidentlycompleted by this decapitation, which was thus a pretence,although the cutting off of the head.... of cardboard... may havereally taken place. And the theatrical climax was here spoi- led by the misadventure of the knight to whom it befell totransgress the knightly rules which directed these spectacles MR.

Inthe next chair to mine sat an Englishmangrumbling graciously about his countrymen.1 had met him in the train. We had tra- velled from Torino together.We had spoken of my French playhouses,of Moliere, of Racine—and of his playhousesand of Shakespeare.He had told me that, while there was aquite a large group of intelligent men andwomen who cared to hear Shakespeare ifwell performed, the larger public as a wholedid not care."

THE SADLER'S WELLS FUND.A PROTEST FROM "THE MASK" THE enthusiasts for establishing Old Sad- ler's Wells Theatre as a second Old Vichave issued another prospectus asking for mo- ney and stating the Object of the Fund.Let us consider this Prospectus a little. THE OBJECT OF THE FUND. TO establish the historic theatre of Sad- ler's Wells as an Old Vic for North" London, putting it under the management" of the existing Old Vic as a second" theatreSo far the enthusiasts have persuaded theCarnegie United Kingdom Trust to providethe whole of the £ 14,200 needed for thepurchase of the building, and now another£ 40,000 is needed " for its reconstruc- tionWhy has the Carnegie Fund found this£ 14,200 for this purchase ?The Trustees of the Carnegie Fund be- lieve in the Drama " as a definite factor innational education " ; that is why they haveput down the £ 14,200 to buy the oldplayhouse. A good and a safe bit of pur- chasing it seems to us; and should theTrustees of the Carnegie Fund later on wishto pull down the Theatre and put up a fac- tory for Biscuits, or for machinery, it can,we suppose, do so.What else does the Fund get for itsmoney ? What are the conditions imposed bythe Trustees of the Carnegie Fund ? That wedo not even guess at. That we are not told.After £ 40,000 more has been collectedby the Committee, the immediate step is toconvert the older Sadler's Wells into a fairlyOld Vic for North London.... and, adds theprospectus, this "is in itself of the utmostvalue and importance ".But we have serious doubts as, to its va- lue ; and as to its " utmost value ", we findit ridiculous. " Importance " means of coursebeing important ": important means "ofgreat consequence—momentous, pompous ".(■Oxford Dictionary). THE Old Vic ", proceeds the prospec- tus, " is not run for profit, but is a" Foundation under the Charity Commis- ii  *sioners .Admittedly while fashionable to " notrun for profits ", its all foolery to run for afall if you come to consider it sensibly.An artist, if he is not very popular, isnot found running his art for a profit—thatis true, but obviously so ; yet when his artbegins to sell, say what we will he is pro- fitting ; and therefore he is running for profitas well as other things are. Why not? Sowhy this statement in the prospectus belit- tling profits ? Miss Baylis doubtless would beonly too happy to see a profit; does she notalready concentrate a good deal on searchingfor Funds ?—indeed she has a real knack inraising Funds. What does she raise fundsfor, except for ultimate Profit ?We forget all the sums that Miss Baylishas managed to raise, but we congratulateher on every penny. In 1922 she raised£ 30,000 to start the structural alterations ofthe Old Vic forced on her by the passionatelove for education of her late Aunt EmmaCons. The story is always the same withthe Old Vjc. When it's money that's wan- ted appeal to the educationalists: wherethere's a blunder to absolve or a debt tomeet, put it all down to education. Anyhow£ 30,000 is, one would have thought, enough on which to start any Miss Baylis. Give£ 30,000 to an Edmund Kean or a Shakes- peare or even a modern playwright and itwould be enough to float him into immensesuccess if you let him work out his planwithout interference. But perhaps lesser peo- ple need more propping up. Still we shouldhave said that for Miss Lilian Baylis £ 30,000was ample.So Miss Baylis and the Old Vic—thetwo seem inseparable—do not look for profit.On further consideration of the questionoerhaps this is quite as well: for whenMr. Cochran presented Miss Baylis, theOld Vic and all its company in " The Ta- ming of the Shrew " at the New OxfordTheatre in the west end of London, only£ 33 was taken in a night at the popularprices of 1/3 to 7/6.That was in 1924. And it was oneyear later, in 1925, that this failure to appealto the real public was compensated by artificialaid from the Trust which believes that theDrama is a definite factor in national educa- tion, and prefers to support Institutions ratherthan Individualities.For our part we feel that the work ofHenry Irving, Sir Squire Bancroft, Sir JohnHare, Sir H. Beerbohm Tree and Sir GeorgeAlexander did more for national education,than six Old Vies could ever dream of doing.Add to these names the names of se- veral more successful managers whose appealto the real public was answered by the realpublic, and you have the theatre of 1880to 1910. CHARITY COMMISSIONERS. THE Old Vic, says the Prospectus of theSadler's Wells Fund, is a large Theatrein Waterloo Road and is not run for profit,but is a Foundation under the Charity Com- missioners.Do you like the sound of that ?We don't: and we don't know why; butwe don't like it.Under the plea of providing Opera andDrama " at prices which even the very poorcan afford " this Old Vic claims and getsfirst £ 30,000, then £ 14,000, and is nowbegging for another £ 40,000, and slowlythrusts out a white and very well nourishedhand to take it. " There is no sight in the world likecrowded house at the Old Vic " says theprospectus : but there we think it exaggerates.We have been in many dozen theatres" in the world " and seen sights as good—possibly better.If it's a collection of poor people one islooking for, anyone can see a hundred suchcrowds in the Cinemas in the east end ofFirenze or Paris, Roma or Stockholm : gloomytired worried crowds it is true. In the thea- tres of Europe, we have seen better crowdsof poor people, in Paris, in London, inVienna and in St. Petersburg; for the marks ofpoverty were not quite so emphasized and theywere a jollier crowd, a far more excited lotof people.To exploit poverty in a Prospectus as athing to see is strange : and we marvel toobserve on the Executive Committee of theSadler's Wells Fund names which ought notto be there.They are there to help to do some good :we are aware of that:—but good throughthe theatre can only be done by supportingthe Theatre as it is—bettering it as it is—as a sound financial affair and as the homeof the Dramatic art—the flag flying high. CLEARLY PROVED. FOLLOWING this plea, the Prospectus statesthat " the presentation of Shakespeareand other drama of high quality, and opera "at these prices " has clearly proved that ifthe ordinary public is given the chance ofgood mental fare it quickly learns to appre- ciate it ". Which is not true if Mr. Coch- ran's announcement is correct, that £ 34 wasthe full sum " the ordinary public " wouldpart with at the Oxford Theatre, London,when " given a chance " to witness " a pre- sentation of Shakespearean Drama ", i.e.," The Taming of the Shrew " by the OldVic Company; and remember, this same" Taming of the Shrew " is the most rollic- king farce Shakespeare ever penned, and verypopular. ROOM FOR REHEARSAL. THE Prospectus proceeds to tell us howthe Sadler's Wells Theatre will benefitthe Old Vic : it will " give sufficient room x Miss Baylis for rehearsal ". 60,000 forrehearsal room seems a little fantastic, for thespace we require for rehearsal can be easilyprovided by any fairly big extra room. ON AND ON AND ON. BESIDES space for rehearsals the Prospectusclaims other advantages. Amongst themthat " it would give London what it has ne- ver possessed, continuous opera played sixtimes a week " and so on. As though abarrel organ, only because it can play on andon and on and never stop till the crack ofdoom is what the world asks from Art.What is asked is good work three timesa week rather than poor work four times aweek or trash for six times a week. Andyou cannot call even competent Dramaticwork good work—it must be first class ornothing to be entitled to be called good. STRANGE STATEMENT. *4 A LL excess of income over expenditure "£~\ coos the prospectus 44 must necessarilygo to the improvement of production ".That is where the vision of these peopleis so limited: for not by any means mustproduction be improved if there be £ 30,000,or even £ 100,000, profit to spend on thatproduction. Genius alone can improve that,or immense talent, or great mother wit—callthe quality what you will.And this is not what Miss Baylis pos- sesses or ever spends a penny to procure.But, pleads the Prospectus, " Trams andbuses pass the doors " of this New oldplayhouse:—alas, there again is more trouble.They do pass, these trams and buses.44 Countless thousands " the pleading voicegoes on, growing weaker and weaker, willreceive " knowledge and entertainment com- bined ". Shakespeare will have 14 a homeworthy of him ", and there the voice dies away. NOW all this alone would not be sufficientto prove that the Old Vic group is anincompetent one: it would rather point toa certain awful competence. Yes, an awfulcompetence: but only for affairs, for mana- ging an empty Theatre very very skilfully—for that alone.Miss Baylis is not exactly an inspired person. She is not a great actress—a greatwriter—a great stage-manager. She is one ofthe many people who, in these last sad twentyyears, has risen by her own abilities, and,rising, she has glided out of her own sphereand intruded on the theatrical preserves.And let there be no misunderstandingabout this. The stage is preserved especiallyfor those of theatrical talent; this old estateof ours is not to be the dumping ground ofthe incompetent.Miss Baylis we find incompetent, for shehas not done the things expected of a soundmanager of a theatre which is " not run forprofit ".Such a manager must run it for somethingpositive—the negative virtue of not sellingenough tickets, so as to cover every expense,is really insufficient.Had the sole alternative flashed acrossher brain, had she said " no profit but Ge- nius anyhow we could have praised her.As a matter of fact the sole healthy ideaof a theatre, is to run it for Genius athundering profit too: aiming deliberately forboth, sniffing at neither.Miss Baylis has sniffed at both.She was given an Honorary Degree ofM.A. by Oxford University in 1924.We know that in the England of today,it is the epoch for allowing domestic servantsto rise from their splendid situation and goon to the stage—into journalism —to becomenovelists—to scratch with apen—to splutterwith a voice—and generally to make a hellof what was once our old heaven.Miss Baylis is of course no domestic ser- vant ; she is a nice kindly middle-aged ladywho could be of the truest service to anyHospital, any Charity Institution; and evenany accountant's office should feel proud tohave such a capable servant, provided shecould rid herself of the notion that businessmust be purged of all commercialism beforeit can " follow the gleam " and men " riseon stepping stones of their dead selves ",and could restrain herself from quoting othersuch scraps of Tennyson to the clerks.But Miss Bayl is has shown us what it isshe can do. The Old Vic represents thekindly spirit towards the poor of the Surreyside; and now this warm-hearted womanwishes to do the same to the poor of ano- ther edge of London. Well, why not ....why should not all theCharitable institutions of Greater Britain lendtheir aid to her in this second effort. If Eng- land believes in the sort of thing (and thedole to a lazy untrained pack of duffers seemsto prove that England does believe in thesort of thing), then by all means full speedahead. But do not ask the sounder part ofold London to tolerate the notion: do notexpect sensible men to countenance this follyof feeding the unwilling by forcing quasi in- tellectual food down their throats sugared withthe awful phrase, " it will do you so muchg00d.... really it will ". For every sensibleman knows that really it won't.WHAT the Carnegie Trust wastes is of noimportance to anyone in his senses.We look upon the £ 30,000 spent onthe Old Vic as money wasted. But thisfurther £ 60,000 which is now being slowlyextracted from Londoners' pockets is a grie- vous business, and that it will also be so muchwaste is a little too bad.Summing it all up :—we think it a verygreat shame, as well as a silly thing to do.And one last word. Do not forget thatour English Theatre suffers not from being overprofessional, but is already in danger of be- coming not a little amateurish. SOME EXTRACTS FROMTHE PRACTICE OF MAKINGSCENES AND MACHINESIN THEATRES.(BOOK TWO), BY NICOLASABBATTINI DA PESARO Figure 1. Figure 2. Figure 3. Figure 4. (I) CHAPTER 37, METHOD OF MAKINGTHE SECTIONAL SKY. WHEN it shall be necessary, in theIntermezzi, for the machines to riseinto the sky or to descend thence uponthe stage, the sectional sky must be used,on account of the facility which it affordsfor such operations, and also on accountof the satisfaction and wonder which thespectators derive therefrom, not perceivinghow the machines, in rising from theground, disappear, nor how, emerging fromthe sky, they descend to the earth.To accomplish this one must first con- struct a portion of the sky, beginning withthe section nearest to the front of the Stageand at the height most convenient, andfollowing on according to the slope, aswas stated in the First Book, Chapter 4.And this first piece must be made as wideas is the space from the front of the stageto the place where the Machines are to rise,,at which point this first section will finish.Having done this, one will commencewith another section, set parallel to theedge of the first strip, but placed so muchhigher than the edges of the first piecethat the spectators, seated in the first rowsnear the stage-opening, may not see thespace which remains between the end ofthe first piece and the beginning of thesecond. This space must also be madeas wide as shall be necessary so that themachines may easily issue thence andre-enter without obstruction. By this method the other sections canalso be made, ....as many as are required. Let the floor of the Sala, or of the Thea- tre, be A, B. and that of the stage C. D.Let the first section of the sky be EF, andthe second GH, and let there be as muchdistance from the back edge F to the begin- ning of the second section at G as shall berequired for the passage of the machines, aswas said above: and let the point G be setsufficiently above F to prevent the openingFG from being seen by the persons seated inthe front row at I, but so that the eye maybe fixed upon the point K, as is shownin IK. (I) These four lines have been drawnin profile so that the demonstration maybe more intelligible. CHAPTER 38. HOW PART OF THESKY MAY BE LITTLE BY LITTLECLOUDED OVER. * "M 1 • 1 ■■■■■—■■■ , ■ , 1 ■ ■ Mill IIMIIWIWIIIHIIMII 111 ■IIIIIIIIHIT is customarily required that the skyshould cloud over little by little.When it is desired to do this, andthe sky having been first made in sectionsas was set forth in the preceeding chap- ter, one will set up, in line with the aper- tures, and on one side of the Stagebehind the Houses, (2) a Telaro (3) corre- sponding to each aperture, which should be made of laths of thin board, coveredwith canvas painted to resemble clouds,taking care that those to the front bemore boldly coloured than the others, aswas said in regard to the colouring of theScene : and these must be equal in sizeto the clouds one desires to show.When this shall have been done onewill fix in each Telaro one or two sup- ports in the manner of tie-rods. Letthese be of light wood, but strong.These will then be adjusted in line withthe sky-sections, behind the houses, sufficient- ly low down not to be seen by those in front.When the time comes for producingthis effect, one or more men, placed abovethe sky, facing the sectional pieces, musthold the tie-rods in their hands, so thatwhen the signal is given them, they maycause the said Telari to run beneath thesky, halting them where it shall be needful,so that in this manner it shall seem asthough the Sky be clouding over. Let the profile of the first section of thesky be A. B. and of the second C. D., andthe Telaro E. F. be painted as a cloyd, aswas said above : and let this be placedbehind the Houses on one side, where ever itbe more convenient ; and let the tie-rod beG. H. ; and let the person who shall haveto stand above the end of the first section beat B, holding in his hands the tie-rod G. H.at H. When wishing to perform this opera- tion, the person placed in H shall be ableslowly to walk above the last sectionalpiece of the sky, holding, as has beensaid, the tie-rod in his hands, and gui- ding the Telaro by its means to the des- tined point, accomplishing in this mannerwhat is desired. If the Telari be large,two or three persons must be set, withtwo or three tie-rods, following the afore- said method. CHAPTER 39. HOW IN ONE MOMENT TO CLOUD OVER THE SKY. ON requiring to cloud over the sky ina moment one will, if one wishes soto do, (albeit this is not a natural thing),accomplish it in the following manner.The sections of the Sky having beenmade by the method set forth above inthe other Chapters, one will make someTelari according to the number of thesections : and let these be of such lengthand breadth as one shall wish the Cloudsto appear, painting them as was said inother places.When the said Telari are made, onewill set them in line with the openingsof the sectional pieces, sufficiently far backthat they may not be seen by the spec- tators ; and let them be placed in grooves,which will have first to be made andplaced at either side, so that they canrun in these grooves in the manner of aportcullis ; and the said grooves must com- mence from the beginning of the Telariand correspond in length with all theparts of the sky, that is of the sectionalpieces ; and they must be painted of thesame colour as the sky itself.All this being h accomplished, and thesaid Telari being adjusted, each in itsplace, and when it is desired to performthe said operation, one will place two,or three, men at each Telaro, and whenthe time comes, let all run the said Te- lari in their grooves, so that in this mannerone will in an instant see that portion ofthe sky clouded over; but the sectionnearest to the front must remain as it was before, since it is not possible to changeit by this method.One will be able, however, to ac- complish the change of this piece by ano- ther method which will be related in thefollowing Chapter. Let the profile of the first section be A.B. and of the second C. D. which has tobe clouded over ; and let E. F. be theTelaro placed above the first piece of thesky A. B. on a level with C. D. andadjusted in the portcullis or groove E. F. G.in such wise that it can run in it easily.To bring about, then, the cloudingover of the section C. D., one will placethe men at E, from whence they can ina- moment make the Telaro run in theline E. F., because when E shall havearrived at F, F will be at the point G;and thus what was to be done will beaccomplished.In like manner one will be able tocause the other sections of the sky to beclouded over, with the exception, however,of the front one, as was stated above. CHAPTER 40. ANOTHER METHODTO CLOUD OVER THE SKY INANINSTANT. I NAWIIIIIIB MHIGIIAI«W&gt;I 1118 lIMW N mm*,,, IN tm\ mmmm HHII uuwmm WMWIWHIMTKTHIS other method of clouding over thesky will he almost similar to the onerelated in the preceeding Chapter, with,however, this difference : that whereas, jnthat one, Telari were placed at the edgesof the sections of the sky, in this onecanvasses, coloured like clouds, must beplaced in those same positions : and thesecanvasses must be equal in length andbreadth to the portions of the sky whichare to be covered, adjusting one side of each canvas to the front edge of its sec- tion. To the other edges one will attachtwo or three ends of cord, or as manyas shall be necessary according to the sizeof the canvas.These cords have to be twice aslong as the length of the said canvasses,and run in pulleys, which must be placedat the extreme outer edge of each sectionof the sky which is to be clouded over.The aforesaid Canvasses shall then berolled up or gathered together in the po- sitions indicated above, in such wise thatthey may not be seen by those out in front.When all these things have been pre- pared and adjusted, one will, in the ap- pointed places, set the men, each of whommust hold in his hand his end of thecords ; and, at the moment when theoperation has to take place, all will pullthe cords in unison, so that in that instantthe parts of the sky will be covered overwith the cloud-painted canvasses.Should one then wish the sky to re- turn as before, one can double the cords,and, pulling their other ends, one will seethe sections of the sky uncovering, andreappearing as they were before.In this manner one will also be able tocloud over the foremost section of the sky,placing a piece of canvas front edge of it. Let the first section of the sky be A. B.and the second C. D., which has to be in- stantaneously clouded over: and let the pieceof cloud-painted canvas be rolled up and ga- thered together at E.; and let the rope beE. F. G.: and let the end E be sewn to thecanvas at E., passing through the pulley inF. and returning with its final end to G. The person who is to operate will,then, hold in his hands the end of thecord G. ; and at the appointed time willinstantly draw the cord towards him withspeed, so that the edge of the canvas E.will arrive at F. In this manner one willhave caused the piece of sky C. D. tobe clouded over.One will operate by the same methodin regard to the other sections of the sky.One will also be able to pull the otherend of the cords, which are set abovethe said canvas, and must be of such alength that E., the front edge ,of thecanvas, when it was in F., may returnto its former position in E.

My dear Gordon Craig.In so far as my colossiousness is not a legitimatestage effect which you would be the last man to dispa- rage, it is something that I cannot help, I can only apo- logize and plead that I was born so. How would youalter me if you could ?You are quite right in saying that the contributionI and my followers (in the chronological sense) have madeto the drama is not an artistic contribution. Wycherleycould say what he had to say as well as I, and couldput it on the stage with as much art. Congreve was asfine an artist as Granville-Barker. The fact that Man andSuperman leaves The Country Wife so far behind that Icannot persuade people that the two authors belong to thesame species, and the stupendous superiority of The Ma- dras House to the Way of the World, is due wholly tothe difference in the subject matter and the mental ca- pacity of the authors. Wycherley and Congreve thoughtwomen over thirty ridiculous, venereal disease funny,and the betrayal of an old husband by a young wifescreamingly laughable. That covers their entire recordedbody of thought. Ido not share these tastes; and if Idid, I have something more important to think about and make an audience think about. I have nothing in commonwith Wycherley and Congreve except our art, and an in- defensible but irrisistible love of acting for its own sake.And I daresay Granville-Barker would say the same.But this is not what has drawn a reply from me toyour sally. You have brought against me the unjust ac- cusation that I have thrust everybody else off the stage.You specify our friend Henry Arthur Jones as a case inpoint. Now the truth is that I could not get my last playinto the theatre until Henry Arthur gracefully made wayfor me by suspending the performance of a play of hiswhich was still unexhausted after a long run. When, longbefore the war, Mr Jones renounced his London vogueand withdrew to America, he did so, not because he wascrowded out, but because, like Shakespeare, he fell into amood of disillusion with English society which he expressedin plays compared to which Timon of Athens seemed agenial optimistic comedy, He went away because he couldnot stand us any longer, not in the least because we couldnot stand him. When he returned after the war he foundhimself for a time excluded from the London West Endtheatres ; but so were we all. The war had raised theatrerents to a figure which no serious author's followingcould cover. When the situation was eased by the sub- stitution of the sharing system for the renting system hemade a triumphant return with the play that kept minewaiting. Your sympathies are due to me, not to him : allthe more so as his misanthropy has taken a most unfor- tunate turn for me. He could not feel like Timon to- wards his country when the war smote it. He forgaveit, but forgave it on the very unexpected ground that itsfaults were the result of it? having been misled by twofiends in human shape, tri-initialled and one-syllabled, byname H. G. Wells and G. B. Shaw. What could we saybut that if the indictment he brought against his entirenation can be narrowed down to a gorgeous burst of hisbest invective against two harmless individuals, we willsuffer meekly for of reconciling him to his own people ?Thus Mr Jones's cause is not really your point.When next you are moved to accuse me of shutting thedoors of the theatre on my fellow playwrights just as MrJones accuses me of shutting the gates of mercy on man- kind, pause and remember what the theatre was when Istormed it, and what it is now. As far as serious originalwork was concerned there were two men in possession,Pinero and Jones, and two new arrivals in the offing:Barrie and Carton. The others were translating from theFrench or writing comic operas, or complaining bitterlythat they were being kept out of the theatre by an ima- ginary Ring. Today the first policeman you ask can, with- out mentioning Pinero, Jones, Carton, Barrie or myself,reel you off a list of twenty established West End Londonplaywrights, enjoying a liberty of subject and treatment,and a standing in literature (to say nothing of the fortunesthey have in their film rights) which drive the aforesaidP, J, B, C, and G. B. S. to shake their fists at the hea- vens and ask despairingly why they were not born fiftyyears later. And you, Edward, have had a splendidshare in this triumph over the Philistines. In the nine- teenth century they did not know what you were talkingabout: today they may not know much better; but youare the most famous theatre man in Europe. Twentyyears ago Charles Ricketts made a stage picture of thethird act of Man and Superman which neither he nor anyother artist in Europe has surpassed or can surpass. No- body took the slightest notice of it then. Today it wouldmake ten reputations. I am actually asked what would St Joan have been without Ricketts: and I am obligedto confess that it would have been a mere sketch in blackand white.And you have the face to tell me that I have closedthe theatre to everyone but myself! that its wide wallsencompass but one man! Ungrateful Edward!But I forgive you for the sake of your deftly im- plied flatteries.Ever yours, a little the worse for wear. (i) For Mr Gordon Craig's article. " The Colossus " seeThe Mask. January 1926. A WORD FROM MR. GORDON CRAIG. Gordon Craig. Dear Mr. Shaw.Writing of you — of George Bernard Shaw — isone thing. Writing to you is quite another — for thento me you are another being.I see that you allow me to print your letter in " TheMask " for you send it almost as an article : you enclose acard with George Bernard Shaw's compliments and thekind after thought This — if you care for it — shallremain exclusive to The Mask.That, if you will allow me to say so* is typical ofthe generous sort of thing I am told you do and most peoplewould forget to do ; it is also typical that you shouldtake the care to give a head line to your letter " THECOLOSSUS SPEAKS". "The Mask" might other- wise have been so daring as to put as heading, " THECOLOSSUS REPLIES ", — thereby attempting to snatch at achance of making itself more important than it is.Had you not made it clear to me that you wantedthe letter printed in " The Mask "# I should have beeninclined to pocket it and write my word of thanks privatelyto you, instead of doing so through the little magazine.For as you see, by writing before the public I haveto give away an especially awkward fact which is that Ihardly know you. Others who have met you six, ten,twenty times and come to know you well, doubtless callyou Bernard or G&gt; B. S.: whereas I, having met youbut thrice, and quite by chance, am perforce obliged bythe courtesy of our country to address you in my letteras Mr. Shaw, it being the first time I have heard fromyou or written to you.This is rather a come-down. It is true I mightstart as you do, and address you by your professionaltitle — your full name ; but I am not, alas, privileged todrop ceremony when half through and plunge on youwith " Look here, George, it won't wash " ; and as I maynot do this I prefer to stick to ceremony.So that this note must be the very briefest: — mustbegin and end in thanking you for your letter, which willprove to be the most popular item " The Mask hasever featured.But as this brief note is not at all the sort of thing whichmy own little public expects from me, allow 'me here toreassure them before you of my determination to returnbefore long to a subject I feel sure they are not yet tiredof, and seemingly never will be.... The subject—G. B. S. Yours sincerely. Genova .Careful j-eaders of Mr. Gordon Craig's article " 7heColossus " published in the January number of " The Mask "and to which Mr. Bernard Shaw replies in this number willnote that Mr Henry Arthur Jones was not cited as one whowas thrust off the stae'e by Mr. Shaw.

I know very little about Mr. JamesLoeb except that he is a retiredBanker and is a rich man—in this heresembles Mr. Henry Ford: I amhappy to say I possess many volumesof the Classics which Mr. Loeb hadthe wit to spread around, the wisdomto «•••••But I write here as though I knewall about Mr. Loeb. I wish I did.I know all about Mr. Ford. 1 wishI didn't.Two rich men : the first distingui- shed, educated, and I don't doubtgifted: the second obviously gifted,undistinguished, and innocent of a greatmany things.Mr Ford's Life and Work bothbore me to death. Otherwise he isdelightful. For he seems to be anactive, good-natured little man, and asan assistant to Mr. Loeb would havedone well. I mean by that wouldhave done well from my point of view;for after all, to make or cause to bemade a Ford car is only to do wellin a very limited way; to cause amillion or two million cars to be madeis to do less well and the way stillnarrower : to amass millions of dollarsin doing this is creditable, for it iseasier to lose millions unless you arecareful. Careful Mr. Ford, believingthat to be careful is the full sum ofexistence (and it is very much), askscarelessly in his book in chapter 13this very poor question: " WHY BEPOOR ? " He doesn't answer it be- "'icause the only approach to a reply is contained in another question, 14 WHYNOT ? "Had Mr. Ford been one of Mr.Loeb's assistants some of the faults ofthe Loeb Classical Library would as- suredly have been eliminated. Firstof all the little faults of production :the translators would have been assis- ted by one or two poet-scholarsand the following passage would havebeen bettered :Messenger. Know that he tookthee from my hands, a gift.CEdipus. Yet, if no child of his,he loved me well.Messenger. A childless man tillthen, he warmed to thee.(Edipus. A foundling or a pur- chased slave, this child ?Messenger. 1 found thee in Cithoe- ron's wooded glens.CEdipus. What led thee to explorethose upland glades ?Messenger. My business was totend the mountain flocks.CEdipus. A vagrant shepherd jour- neying for hire ?Messenger. True, but thy saviourin that hour, my son—and, so on.1 hold that Professor J T. Shep- pard would have done this better.He takes more liberties I suppose withhis Greek friends* work, but what ofthat; he keeps us all alive. You canread his 44 Helen " and not hate Euri- pides or Loeb, or Sheppard, or yourlibrary, or life itself. Mr. Ford wouldprobably have plumped for Sheppardtoo and he would have fitted out twoor three romantic yachts and soughtfor and found Sheppard.Again Mr. Ford, as enthusiast andassistant, would have seen to it that ineach volume we were told of Mr.Loeb and his intention in doing thisexcellent work. This would havebeen made clear by a series of essaysby the very best prose writers of theage. He would have added three orfour volumes of chronology and topo- graphy by the finest scholars.Then in the difficult matter of dis- tribution how useful Henry Fordcould have been. He would haveseen to it that we alt were enabled toget these lovely books, and for a morereasonable sum. He would have is- sued several million copies and forcedthese into our hand :—willingly aftersome delay (in fact till we began toappreciate the gift) we should havepaid up our two or three shillings pervolume. As it is they cost muchmore.I grieve that a man like Ford isallowed, is even forced, to waste hisexceptional carefulness and his astoun- ding energy on turning out useless cars.There are enough cars already andenough car makers; whereas good as- sistants are rare, and Mr. Loeb lackedjust such an assistant as Mr. Fordwould have made.Of Mr. Henry Ford's book it isneedless to say anything. He hasbeen flattered by the press as only afabulously rich man can be flattered,and it is Mr. Samuel Crowther, whohas written the book for him and doneit amazingly well, that must be com- plemented.C| Lest it be supposed that 1 decryall the Loeb translations let me addthat they are often very good, but some- times it seems as though a tramwayticket collector had pushed throughand- got the job. Poets and fineprose writers should have been calledto assist at this work. If Sir EdmundGosse or Prof. Gilbert Murray weretoo busy, another such man of tasteand discernment could perhaps havebeen found to control the entire edi- tion. Why wasn't it done ? I believethat the search broke down too earlybecause Henry Ford was allowed tobecome a boss instead of remainingwhat he was born to be, a first-classassistant.I do regret that there are not morepictures in the Loeb Library. SomePortraits of the Masters, only too oftenreproduced, do adorn the little vo- lumes ; but I miss the kind of thingwhich Dion Clayton Calthrop gives usin his 44 Music Hall Nights ", a rea- dable book with little classic touchesabout the mouth-organ which is 44 fullot Pagan joys If only the Paganliterature was allowed today to beeven as Pagan as a mouth-organ, whowould ever feel as I feel towardsE. Capps PH. D,, LLD.; T. E. Page,Litt. D. ; W. H. D. Rouse, Litt. D.the able and scholarly editors of theLoeb Library, and the absent Mr.Henry Ford for shirking the wholebusiness. Mr. Loeb almost did a greatthing, and would have done it had heenlisted under him not only scholarlybeings but living human men of ge- nius. Poets, prose-writers,... all theunemployed writers of real talent. WithFord over them each would have beenforced to supply his bit, and to trans- late the Classics a whole little worldis needed, one putting in bolts all day,another spraying on the colour, a thirdgiving a wheel a shove, a fourth saying44 yes ", a fifth.... in short, the workof Ford, plus the incantation of thewitches in Macbeth, plus some scho- larly agonies, and the thing couldn'thave gone wrong. Although my whole life has beenspent writing reviews of books seated inthe corner of the inner room in theold Inn of Wine Office Court, I too couldhave helped Loeb. I could have help- ed to steady the unemployed.I could have gone over to Americato look for talent, for that is not whereFord would have failed to look for, butonly failed to discover, talent. I shouldin those days fifteen years ago havespotted talented Mr. Nathan. I wouldhave taken him to Bedford Street.I should have done as I have said,and led him meekly round to Mr.Heinemann and he would soon havefixed him up, given him a good con- tract, and we should now both be hel- ping Mr. Loeb (under Henry Ford);instead of which there goes poor Na- than philosophising, attitudinizing andkeeping Alfred A. Knopf far too busy.But Nathan will write on, and Iwill write on, and Calthrop will listenin, and Sheppard will be roped in tothe Greekeries at the Scala, and Fordwill fool away his time out of his rightplace, and Loeb will do good thingssomewhere else, and Sophocles willsuffer. And all because the twentiethcentury considers it a virtue that eachman shall be out of his right place.No, Mr. Loeb, finally no. I ad- mire and applaud your intentions andyou really have achieved a great deal;but had you only perceived that it wasin your power to make your Libraryblaze like the bush of Moses, you couldhave reversed History. But are youeven now going to sit down and allowlittle Mr. Ford to make rules for Lifeand Work,—even at the eleventh hourare you going to allow that ? THE WAY TO SKETCH, VernonBlaise. Oxford University Press. 7/6DRAWINGS FOR THE THEA- TRE, R. E. Jones; Theatre Arts Inc.U. S. A. $ 5.00PAUL SCHEURICH, Dr. OskarFischel. Rembrandt Verlag, Berlin,(price not marked). MR. Blake, in telling us how tosketch, seems to me to enjoyhimself to the extent of forgetting thoseof us who would like to hear how tosketch." Some people " he says, delibera- tely not looking in our direction, "people find a difficulty in throwing theeye out of focus ' : and then he pro- ceeds to explain how we fools canachieve the simple operation, and I amforcibly reminded of a recipe I onceread for making Blue Sky. He says*' Hold the finger up about six inches from the eye and look at it ; then, ma- king up your mind not to change thestate of the accommodating musclesof the eye, suddenly remove the finger;you will see all the objects before you,at a greater distance than six inchesenveloped and without detail. I havefound this dodge most useful in "etc, etc, etc.He gives us eight sketches by Corot,Renoir, Turner and others, and one ofhis own as a colour plate.I like Mr. Blake for the thorough- hearted way he enjoys himself andhis own productions. He gives us inall nineteen of his own sketches.... andan extra one on the cover, ....perhapsthe least successful of the twenty, buthe forgets to show us how the greatsketchers Van Gogh, Callot, or Daumierdid the business.I weary a little of Mr. Blake andturn with considerable pleasure thepages of an admirable book of sketchesby Mr. R. E. Jones.Here is someone who knows howto sketch, and, as is usual nowadays,he is employed to do something else.And yet not always and not every- where is this so. In Germany menare sometimes put to the task theywere born for, and Paul Scheurichwas certainly born to draw, to paintand to sketch. Alas, Scheurich luresme away from Jones. He sketcheseverything, anything, ....theatres andactors sometimes; thank God not allthe time. Four of his designs are forVoltaire's " Candide ", others for" Hundschen der Marquise " and thesedelight me with their grace, a qualitylacking entirely in the sketches cfR. E. Jones.But then Paul Scheurich has notdeserted his Muse for the Theatre asMr. Jones has been forced to do. Mr.Jones succeeds most admirably insome sketches for a production of" Richard 1111 think these representhis best work for the stage, and. theyare good as sketches.There can be no comparison betweenthe work of the two men, Scheurichso cultured, so graceful, so far advanced,and Jones so immature although butfour years his junior: still one can com- pare the fate of the two. And it saysvery much for Germany and very littlefor America. WHO'S WHO INTRE, b\) John Palmer. Pitman &amp;Sons. 255. net. MR. Parker's work is well knownby now for this is the fifth edi- tion revised and enlarged, of the best book on the subject, and very goodat that.It tells us who is who in the Thea- tre, but it also tells us who was who.And in the book's Theatrical Calendarhe tells us " what was what " as farback as the 16th centmy.And here most men would havestopped, and it is here that Mr. Pal- mer generously goes on. He gives usthe names of all the Dramatic Critics—or nearly all, for a few are omitted,including Mr. Horace Wyndham. Hegives us ninety tables of TheatricalFamilies, Mr. J. M. Bulloch helpinghim there. The longest " runs " areall listed, " Chu-Chin-Chow " with2,238 performances being well aheadof all others : " Charley's Aunt" beingsecond with 1,466. Some only total- ling 100, .... a long enough run onewould have thought.We are then given a list of West- end Theatres, details about these pla- ces, sizes, addresses, managers' names,telephones, all very exact and excel- lent, and to me immensely instructive,A list of performers who have pas- sed away follows, in which we evenfind Ristori and Siddons, the latterdying on June Bth 1831, aged seventy- six. The date is correct, and I onlymention it because the date of herbirth (also given) is I think incorrect.She is down as having been born in1753 on June 13th and July sth, whichis improbable.Mr. Parker's list of Theatrical Willsis very interesting to study. Barnumheads it with £1,000,000. Lottathe actress comes next with £BOO,OOO.Sir Charles Wyndham comes tenth inthe list with £197,035, but is theactor who leaves the largest sum, Gar- rick being the next with £120,000.But in Garrick's time £120,000 wasworth more than it would be today.Irving leaves very little, £20,527, andis easily beaten in the art of savingmoney by his son H. B. Irving wholeft £39,176. Last on the list comesStephen Phillips with £5 ; and one issurprised to find that Charles Brook- field left only £269.The book ends with forty-fourpractical plans of the London Thea- tres showing how the seats in each arearranged.But who was Mary Raby ? Sheacted Mrs. Hawkins in " TreasureIsland " in 1924, was the only wo- man in the piece, and yet is excludedfrom the Biographies.

GROUP PSYCHOLOGY, Sig- mund Freud. Boni &amp; Liveright.$ 2.00. IN the old days we theatre folk imi- tated the sea by a vast blue-greencloth, covering the entire stage, andunder it ten, twenty, or thirty boyswould roll or bend or move from sideto side, thus delighting a simple-mindedhappy race of unenlightened ladies andgentlemen who thrilled to be so de- ceived.We had other ways of suggestingthe sea, ....its waves, its breakers andits salt spray, but the main devicewas the cloth which heaved up anddown.This old device is almost gone, dri- ven away not by better devices but bya more enlightened and sceptical being,who likes anything better than to bedeceived.I do not know what the first ninevolumes of " The Mariners' Mirror "may contain, but I suppose it is toomuch to expect to find there a detai- led account of how to make a stageocean, how to cause a ship to sail overthe stage and to tack in sight of theaudience.Even without it this Quarterly journalof the Society for Nautical Researchwill do. Such quarterlies seem to meto be every whit as excellent as books.Here one gets 120 pages for six shil- lings, and every page of the utmostvalue to students,... and what seamanlis not a student. To go to sea, and,having seen and experienced, to returnhome and, on dry land, find " TheMariners* Mirror " waiting with yourgrog and plenty of tobacco heavens,what a life. And the " Mariners* Mirror " willof course advertise the existence of"Adventures by Sea " a folio which"The Studio Ltd " have publishedfor the price of three guineas.There are 22 magnificent colour- plates and I don't know which I likebest; and there are 79 full pageplates,wonders in half-tone, ....the storm- ing of this, the taking of that, oneafter another; and not too much text,and this some of Masefield's best ;inshort, a book which everyone can enjoyand hardly anyone will be able to getunless he hurries up, for it has aneloping look about it.And it is these ships, we are toldby Sir Alan Moore, in his " Last daysof Mast and Sail" that are all passingaway: if they happen to have sailsand masts they are useless.The book that Sir Alan has writ- ten is not likely to pass so quickly.Nor am I persuaded that the daysof the sail and mast are numbered.Is the horse-drawn carriage to go too?I should not care to prophesy aboutthese things. I have sometimes riskedan optimistic guess about the Theatre,and its actors, plays, masks and therest, because 1 have looked into pos- sible changes and betterment in themanagement of this world of ours. 1have no talent to despair as Sir AlanMoore despairs; I could only do ittheatrically ; he does it in the nearestto the true tragic manner—which is athought too grave to please me.He says that " nothing less than thefailure of the race can revive thatand mast which once produced suchable individual men ".... The failureof the race, what race ? The racewhich cannot perceive all the values ofthe best we have on earth is a racewhich may well fail, falling captivesuddenly to some race which can un- derstand each value and can put themin order once more. In those daysSir Alan's last chapter to his beautifulbook will be prized, but the world Itrust will not wait placidly for that dayto come.Unfortunate it is that it will mean,here and now, sinking the twelve chap- ters of Pirate Sigmund Freud's volume." Group Psychology and The Ana- lysis of the Ego "is the flag flown, andI am reminded of the old skull andcrossbones.Too bad ... too bad.... for Freud isa man of great qualities.... as was oldMorgan : but his group is a group ofPirates. We all love 'em, these pirates,roaming the wide seas and oftendoing good; curing people of thejumps, really gaining little for them- selves ; not altruists, not egoists, but justunaware of all the values.Sir Alan's book breathes health,pours it into you. Freud's book wouldkill you. It is the first and last I shallread by this remarkable being.As I write this the wind is howling,and smashing trees, and playing havocall around. The sea is in a fury....and I happen to re-open the Memoirsof " Lady Anne Barnard at the Capeof Good Hope, 1797-1802 " at thepicture showing her in the Atlantic onboard the mast and sail ship " Sir Ed- ward Hughes "; the picture is called" General Hartley and I moralize ondeck " and is drawn by Lady Anne.She was a delightful lady with a realgift for painting vivid water colours.This one shows us that the ship whichtook her to Africa, was about as wideas a couple of good-sized cabins, withits deck level with the water. Thereare some advantages in living in 1926and I see it clearly when I look atthis General and Lady moralizing atthe edge.One of the best antidotes to mora- lizing is a little bibliography, and thelittle bibliography, of •• John Cary, En- graver, Map, Chart and Printseller andGlobe-maker " is perfection.As a piece of bookmaking it is de- licious except for the rather roughpaper on which it is printed. Whathas put us all against that paper ofpolished surface once known as ArtPaper ? Why do publishers use it solittle today ? It pleased the touch andwent well with the half-tone plates.I am entirely in its favour ; a book isthinner and perhaps a little heavier,but what of that; the smooth touch ofit is so agreable. Or if ' Art * paperis too glossy, there is that ordinarysmooth paper used in books of refe- rence.... and what better ?The six books reviewed here are allprinted on rough paper of a blotting- paper texture, and I for one detestthat: five of them have plates onsmooth paper, and the contrast is notpleasant. What law binds the publi- shers to use such a combination; whycannot they escape from the situation?As a rule the plates come unstuck,though nowadays a new and good me- thod prevents that, and the plates inMr. Kingsford's excellent " Early Hi- story of Piccadilly, Leicester Squareand Soho " are clearly not going tocome out after the book has had harduse. And that it will have hard useis certain, for it is a book that wasneeded. The public all over the worldwould no doubt like to see a goodmany more such books on London, but for itiy part I would that they dealtwith one district only, or even onesquare, 6r one street; and I wouldhave the entire history of that street,square or district, not alone that of onecentury of it. Limit the space of grounddealt with, not the facts.Both these books from the Cam- bridge Press are delightfully bound,and the price of the John Gary bookis astonishingly low, spite of it 3 expen- sive looking covers. I do not despairof some day seeing English publisherscutting the covers and coming to thecackle a little quicker and adopting thecontinental custom of issuing seriousworks in paper covers. So much moresensible, especially in an age when ashilling or two off the price makes sucha great difference to the public's purse. EDITORIAL NOTES. ENGLISH COMMONSENSE.mmmmmmmmmemmmmmmmmmmmammmmßmmcmaamßmmmmmmmmrnmmmmMmmmmmmmm twmmmwmmmmmmmmmmam IT is seldom that the careful observer1 can find anything at all fundamen- tally wrong with the policy of theItalian Theatre. And if today we havenoticed something odd, may be it isonly a temporary hitch in a mechanismwhich formerly ran along very smoothly.Once you smoked your cigar or ci- garette during performances—only in afew theatres was it disallowed. Nowyou may not smoke in any real thea- tre, and only in a few Halls. Thisnew regulation may have some unex- pected consequences.The Facist Government, so sanelymasculine in most things, seems not tohave perceived that the prevention ofsmoking in a theatre may in time ren- der the Italian stage effeminate.It may not have occurred to themto look around Europe and Americaand see what kind of audience isbrought into being when smoking isforbidden.It is seldom that the careful observercan find much that is fundamentallyright with the policy of the EnglishTheatre.But recently one of the best Thea- tres in London has done a very sen- sible thing. The order has gone outthat " In the Gaiety Theatre by per- mission of the Lord Chamberlain smo- king of cigars and cigarettes is per- mitted in all parts of the house du- ring performance ".It is many a year since so sane, soordinary an innovation has been per- mitted.With our excellent modern systemsof ventilation the smoke annoys noone, and the obvious pleasure derivedby most men (and some ladies) whosmoke a good cigar or cigarette afterdinner is not interfered with. Themood evoked by smoking a good smokeis the right mood to witness the per- formance of a play or a comic opera.If the acting is so magnificent that itcan succeed in putting out the cigarsit will be quite an achievement. Buta regulation should not.We shall be much surprised if thispermission to smoke does not verygreatly increase the popularity of theGaiety Theatre.And to think that London shouldbe the place where this little innova- tion has seen the light, and withoutany pain and with a lot of pleasure."We wish the Gaiety Theatre manya long run and we look forward toits next commonsense reform. ——p—asa—««—■g—iManacftf bwummKHH—aawia»,iwnBWßßßßWMneMßß«S TRA TFORD UPON A VON.THIS TIME ENGLISH NOT AMERICAN.
