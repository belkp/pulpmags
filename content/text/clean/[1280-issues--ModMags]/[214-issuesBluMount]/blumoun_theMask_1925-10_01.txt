Showing the whole Plan on a smaller scale, Piranesi, the Elder, has worked on this Plate. Plate 1. FOREWORD J. S. IN Nolli's Plan of Roma, which is here offered for thefirst time in a handy form and at a popular price, wehave a leaf of genuine History, for it is all fact.Books about the Roma of the 18th century may con- tain as much fancy as fact, and that in time renders themof little use to the historian. We talk of the Roman streets,of the Palaces, Theatres, Churches and other monuments;we write of the Piazza Navona or the Palazzo Rospigliosi,and though all these may be known by hearsay to us theystill remain vague, ....vague as to position, form, size, andin their relation to their surroundings. We may have seen these places, but. perhaps forgottenone of them, and, certainly, quite forgotten where they areplaced, how surrounded, or how one reaches them fromthe Porta del Popolo or from the Porta di S. GiovanniLaterano.Ask yourself to define the track leading from Portadel Popolo to the Piazza Navona without looking at any plan. It is only a matter of pulling down a few street....but can you do it?To save you the trouble here is Nolli. He can stancon your desk in his present form: in 1748 he was far to&lt;big a book to be handy: and even if you can get a cop)now it is too large to serve you as reference book, for it i:a folio of thirty six pages, and measures one foot severinches by one foot two inches.4 4 The Mask " having seen that, besides this plan oiRoma being one of the very best, it was used frequently bjthe most active students of the Theatre, thought that, byreducing it to a practical size it would be doing some ser- vice. So now you can have your Mollis Plan of Romaclose at hand to refer to when rereading the many bookswhich deal with Roma, no matter what the subject. Notonly theatrical students but scholars of all kinds will findit useful.The Plan illustrates many hundreds of books, but italso corrects, and with authority, a number of them, sup- plementing others. Errors have sometimes crept into theseDooks because the chief guide, ie Roma itself, was notproperly followed.Nolli shows us eight Theatres, most of them veryclearly defined. Teatro Alibert, 296:Teatro Argentina, 771:Teatro Capranica, 332:Teatro de' Granari, 618:Teatro della Pace, 611:Teatro della Pallaccorda, 444:Teatro di Tordinona, 536:Teatro della Valle, 795.But we must not forget that this short list of eight thea- tres represents none but the 44 public playhouses ": and thaiin many a palace was a magnificent Teatro privato oi» a Teatrino. And, lest we develope any wrong notion aboutRoma and its manner of doing things of this kind in theseventeenth and eighteenth Centuries, let us state what aprivate Theatre was not in those days.Merely because it was private, it was not anythingwhich today we call "amateurish but inasmuch as it wasan " amatore delle arti", a lover of the arts, who devoted alarge portion of his wealth and time to the care of hisTeatro, so was the work amateurish, but only in this sense.Devoting time and money to his Teatro did not asa rule mean that he interfered with the work, the con- struction of the place, the production or composition of plays,&gt;pera or ballet. Counts Pepoli and Albergatti, two of theoremost amatori d'arte of Italy, did assuredly write plays,tnd perform in them; but as a rule the great people ofloma made and kept their private theatres more for theentertainment of their guests and to avoid the inconvenien- :es of the public playhouses with their crush, draughts,loise and suffocation.Amongst those who had Private Theatres in Romavere the Queen of Poland, Maria Casimira, who in 1709ived in Pal azzo de Torres alia Trinita del Monte: Olimpia\ldobrandini, the famous Principessa di Rossano; theSpanish Ambassador whose private theatre in the Spanish3alace was built in 1688: the Barberini family, whoseheatre it is said seated 3000 people and was opened in1634. The Prince Galicano had a private Theatre atvhich Evelyn in 1645 witnessed " a magnificent opera ".Then there was the teatro of Palazzo Rospigliosi; those of3alazzo Corsini; of Palazzo Colonna in Borgo, (the Co- onna family had it seems two private theatres, one of thesemown as " il grand teatro del Contestabile Colonna "); ofthe Palazzo Panfili in the Corso; and of the Collegio Ro- mano. The most fashionable theatre of 1639 was a pri- vate Theatre built by Bernini in the Fonderia del Yati- cano. Lastly there was the teatrino built for Cardinal PietroOttoboni by Juvarra in about 1 700, a building of threetiers and most beautifully designed interior. We have seenthe almost unknown original designs. In 1678 during thecarneval there were 130 comedies given in the privatetheatres of Roma.But most of our readers probably know all aboutthese places and what was performed there, and the Planis nnlv to serve as a means of locating their exact positions. A NEW PLAN OF ROMA BY GIOVAN BATTISTA NOLLI.(1)PUBLISHED IN THE YEAR MDCCXLVIII. (i) FOREWORD BY THE DESIGNER. ALTHOUGH the leaves of the large Planof Roma ought to be all unitedtogether, so as to have them all extendedbefore the eye, as are usually all Geo- graphical Maps, yet, if it should pleaseanyone to have them bound, in book form,it is to be noted that, to be able to makeuse of its indexes, desiring to find thoseBuildings or Places which are in the samePlan, it is necessary first to find in thealphabetical Index the name of that Buil- ding or Place which one is seeking, andio see what is the number by which itts indicated on the sheets ; then the same number is found in the other numericalIndex, and in this wise one will know inwhich Rione it is described : and, seeingin that same Rione the number alreadyfound, one will see the Place or Buildingdesired. At the top of each sheet arerepeated the Rione,and, some being de- scribed in a single sheet, others in severalsh eets, there is indicated, beside the nameof each one, those sheets in which somepart of this same Rione is included, andin one of which there will be found thenumber of the Building, or Place, whichone seeks.

ROMEWAS NOTBUILTI N ADAY (1} IAMB A TTISTA, or Giovan Battista Nolli was born atVJT Como, in Italy, about thebeginning of the eighteenthcentury. An architect by profession, he built the church ofS. Dorotea in Roma, and in 1748 made a plan of that city,which was issued under the title of " Nuova Pianta di RomaIt is a plan of the modern city with indications of the ancientruins, and was considered the finest which had been executedup to that time. Some years later, about 1755, he made anotherplan of ancient Roma.He died in 1780, ten years after his son Carlo, who, a painter and engraver, predeceased him, in Naples where hehad gone to work for the King of Naples, in 1770.(2) r I AHERE are two Indexes in the original edition. We1 have not included the Alphabetical Index, thinking thatone Index would be enough for the moment. We have usedthe two, and find the one i?icluded here to be the more usefulof the two.*BUT we will give the Alphabetical Index in the nextnumber of " The Mask and those who wish canhine the whole work together. THE PRIVATE TEAT RINGOF THE COLLEGIO ROMANOIN ROMA J. S. MECHANISM INSTALLED IN THE TEATRINOOF THE COLLEGIO ROMANO IN ROMA. FROM THE CONTINUATION OF DUMONT'S41 PARALLfeLE DES PLANS ET DES PLUSBELLES SALLES DES SPECTACLES PUBLIQUESo D'EUROPE" OF 1760. oThis Continuation teas published 1775. I have selected these two and six other plans anddesigns of stages and stage scenes because theyillustrate a point in the development of the Theatrein Roma in the 18th century,I have not seen them reproduced in any bookor journal since they were first printed in thatcentury. Every day it is the very celebrated" La Scala " at Milano, or the equally celebrated44 San Carlo " in Napoli which we see reproducedfor us, until surely the world is in danger ofgrowing tired of them. npHE date when the theatre was put up in the•*» Collegio Romano is unknown to me : whetherthere was one only or the place had more is alsounknown to me.Colleges in Italy were not slow to providegood stages for the students and their study ofdeportment and speech. In Parma in the firsthalf of the 17th century we find in the Collegiodei Nobili such a theatre. This College continuedto improve its theatre, and about 1652 had mo- veable scenes of the triangular kind of which Sab- battini had written in 1637 ; and by about 1750had two Theatres, one large and one small.The point I wish to make, is, that documentsexist which show us very complete Italian CollegeTheatres, and that they are not merely temporarystages. THE THREE LARGE ROMAN THEATRES OF THE 18th CENTURY. £. TEATRO ALIBERTI in Via Margutta. 2. TEATRO ARGENTINA in Strada de' Cesarini. 3. TEATROTOR DI NONA opposite Castel Sant'Angelo.All three were public Theatres. The Tor di Nona was first built in 1660 but soon destroyed by fire; it wasrebuilt in 1671 : destroyed in 1698, and rebuilt in 1735, and this is the plan given above (fig 3). This buil- ding was destroyed by fire in 1780, and again built in 1781 ; it fell in ruins in 1785 when it was again rebuilt,and again in 1795; restored in 1830, restored again in 1867, it was finally destroyed in 1882, and in 1886 demo- lished for ever to make room for a new embankment to the Tevere. Surely few Theatres have been morePhoenix-like. The Teatro Alibert or Aliberti (fig. /), first known as Teatro delle Dame, built in 1718, wasburnt at the end of the 19th century. The Teatro Argentina (fig. 2) was built in 1732 and still exists. THE PRIVATE TEATRINO OF CARDINALOTTOBONlin Roma, designed and built by the Architect Juvarra circa1700-1705.

REPRODUCED FROM THE LIBRETTO OF 4&lt; CARLO MAGNO n ROMA 1729.ENGRAVINGS BY BALPASAR GABBUGGINi AND F. VASCONI. THE PRETTYTHEATRE PART TWO AS I said in my opening notes on thistheme, I do not intend to be critical. Mypurpose is more that of the print-collectorthan of the writer.Have you not seen this print-collector insome old shop, in Rue de la Seine or Ruedes Beaux Arts, as he sits by the hourturning over hundreds of prints of all subjectsand of all centuries.... silent.... pausing tolook at some, turning over others without morethan a glance, picking out with deliberation,but without a word said, one here, onethere ; laying them in a heap. Then, after agood three hours' search, silently paying forthese, ....going home.... undoing his package....going more slowly over each print.... sayingnothing.My purpose is his: he thinks a devil ofa lot, may be ; but whatever he thinks it ishis delight in the print as a print, includingsubject, condition of the print, name of en- graver, date, quality of the work and price.And so is it here with me. If some arecensorious, when they hear of Mile. Guimard,Sophie Arnould and Madame Montansier, toselect three of the most remarkable namesfrom a big bouquet, .... if some find the privatetheatres of the first two ladies mere hot-bedsof vice and the many public theatres ruledover by the third dens of infamy, I have cometo look on them as the old print collector looksupon his treasures. They have cost me verylittle, and have given me great pleasure:I have read so much about them, seen thehouses they made and seen them recorded again;1 have seen them die : even come to forgetthem in the centuries which followed: remem- bered them again while contemplating subse- quent centuries : see them again now. I forone cannot pick one of them out for censure.But I muse at times: La Guimard isworth the threepence I gave for her: Sophieat a golden guinea was not dear: MadameMontansier .... I would any day give againthe shilling I was asked for her and withouta murmur.If the price is sometimes low, what of that: I gave what the print-seller asked. For a songby Mozart there is no price, ....so rare thatfew can hear it, so cheap that anyone mayhave it: for a glance at the Palazzo Ducalein Genova nothing is asked ; you may evenpass it for nothing and not see it. So thatit seems that the price of a thing is nothingby which to guage the value : " nothing fornothing and dam little for sixpence " soundspretty so far as it goes, but the sound is itsprincipal asset. There is not truth there.You sometimes can get all for nothing andsometimes for a thousand pounds nothing.The pretty is often held to be so cheapthat it is not worth any notice at all; andassuredly a little of it can be afforded by anyof us and is useful to all. It is useless todeny that. "Whether in certain centuries itwas worth quite so much as the price put onit is another matter. I cannot tell; ....I leaveit to the Due d'Orleans and the Prince d'Heninto settle that between them.... if they evermeet nowadays.The pretty, spite of it being so cheap,possibly cost the Theatre of Europe and itsDrama a pretty penny. What of that?....are we not here today to pay the mortgage ?I have the utmost sympathy with thosewho feel they are too poor to do more thanadd to this debt, for the next century will haveto pay. Possibly that is one of the reasonswhy so many well-to-do actors nowadays warntheir sons against taking up the profession.But let us return to my print shop.The last time I was in Zenabella Idiscovered a book in my print shop. It wasa hovel of a place, and there lay Zola's" Nana ". I bought it; I took it home andI read it. NANA. X. Y. Z. " All Paris Will visit your Theatre " Say,my brothel, answered the Manager I suppose that there are very few peopleliving today who are reading Emile Zola'snovel " Nana " for the first time : yet I havebut just finished reading it and for the firsttime, although I began it some thirty yearsago and came to a full stop at the passagein Chapter One where a manager of a Theatreasks a habituee of his playhouse to drop the word " theatre " and substitute the word" brothel" (0.Knowing dozens of theatres which wereserious places, (serious as churches, banks, orships) I drew the line at any further interestfor a book, whose author, I saw, promised tokeep up the fantastic old delusion of the out- sider.That the theatre this Zola was to writeof, was no theatre at all, settled it for me thatI should not be interested. I put the bookdown. €J That I was probably prejudiced onlyoccurs to me now. For have not there beenwriters who made novels out of Banks full ofThieves, Churches full of Knaves ? Theworld is full of men and women, and men andwomen full of pranks, passions, vices andvirtues.Are we to read only about virtues andthe virtuous ? They exist and are often hidden,and so to reveal them with what we call" art * is to do a trick not without beauty.But no virtue is quite valuable surrounded bya sea ot virtues ; how mark a poor single virtue,how illumine it, if no vices are there to setoff its brilliance ? Too much virtue may beas vile as too much vice.* * *CI So three days ago when I was in needof a book to read .... a novel above all else....I happened to pick up a copy of " Nana"on a bookstall. For three francs I bought it,and in three days I have read it.And it is awefull.It deals with the life of a woman whogoes on to the stage without any qualifications,without genius or talent, unable to act, butpossessed of an astounding personality.... ofthe personality which attracts.... of animalmagnetism. This personality is not the personality ofa Rachel, who also attracted besides havinga genius as a tragic actress; it is not a bril- liant personality, it is just a weak one; sheis amiable, a hundred times amiable, loveable,and all over the place.By means of this personality displayed onthe stage she brings all Paris to her feet.She lives every kind of life, ....in poor quar- ters, in gaudy well-to-do ones, in neat ones,in sumptuous ones, and finally dies of thesmallpox, her face eaten away.To the end, and even beyond it, shestill continues to attract.This is not repulsive although it does notsound exactly attractive. But there is an un- der current which is interesting, more attrac- tive, stranger, for those of us who work inTheatres and want to see the Theatre of theworld taking on a new lease of life. It is atheme which recurs and recurs, and eachtime it does so it reminds us of paragraphswe read today in the newspapers, or of photo- graphs we have seen only yesterday in theshop windows. It is the theme of the Impre- sario and the hangers-on to Theatres, ....letit be instantly added the tenth-rate ones, theseflashy gentlemen with their big press agenciesand their paragraphed expressions of heartfeltdesire to uplift the drama, even to make itsacred, ....even if they have to sweeten thepill for the public by serving up the moralwith something that tastes good; in short, themost beautiful women that can be found inEurope and America.We hear of these funny fellows every day.In " Nana " we have their portraits. II. WHEN some suave theatrical impresario ordirector wrote to Nana, ....was she atthat time in Berlin or Prague?... saying hewanted to see her really a success, that itwas his way to work for love could notdream of business where she was concerned,....that her immense talents were being hid- den, that he felt it was part of his life's workto bring her to Pariis (or was it New York ?),she naturally ran off to Paris or New Yorkas quickly as possible. Yes, it was to Parisshe ran. And became a great success ; hadsome twenty lovers immediately, ....yes, in- stantly.... ; took up with a twenty-first, a man of wealth and left the twenty for a month ;then after a few weeks more took the twentyback with the twenty first. Then threw themall over; disappeared with a hideous lookingactor ; stayed with him a few months in moreor less poverty in Montmartre; then sank toworse poverty and haunted the cafe of someold woman who was always eager to see newfaces ; appeared on the stage for two nights,and in those two nights managed to win ano- ther protector, who lavished on her millionsof francs ; ... all this was quite natural. Theimpresario and the manager, looking holy,were photographed with the lady between them;all Paris was impressed, .... just like today.And our 1924 Theatre is where it wasin 1870: it is where these impresarios andmanagers, with their clever manipulation ofwomen, would have it.It is devilish clever to be sure. Theworld gets bitten by a longing to see a sa- cred play, ....having heard that the Oberam- mergau Passion Play is not to be seen unlessthe world will travel all the way to Oberam- mergau, and then only once in every tenyears. So the impresario and the managerresolve to make up a substitute to console afretful world. It shall have its sacred play,.... but it wont really be so sacred as allthat, because we are prudent gentlemen fromthe East, and know that the 'Western world(which, by the way, we despise) only wantsto have the shadow of sacred things ; if theremust be any substance let it be as fleshy aspossible.And Nana is again caught in the net....and landed ever so gently; put on the mar- ket ; praised by the modern press agent monthby month for her dramatic virtues, then eachwreek, then each day; cables are sent roundthe world of her amazing talents (and shewith but one, ard that the old magnetismpossessed by myriads of women) ; photographsfill the back pages of daily papers; and arich man, also from the East, is found to actnobly by supporting the immense expense,....so great is his love for art ....and religion,especially the Christian religion. In short thewhole thing almost causes the impresario tobreak down with emotion so noble he is, sheis, they all are.Every day and in every land this is beingdone in Theatres, on a small scale and on alarge scale. If not a " religious " play it's a Revue,or a Historical play; any old theme serves,.... it's the woman is the goods.Do you want any examples pointed outto you ? There's no need, they are so evident.The small town of Zenabella, in which, Iwrite this, has given me the details which Ihave here related.Perhaps in New or in Paris or inLondon today there are no ludicrous jokes ofthis sacred art business being perpetrated.I leave you to decide that.But here in Zenabella a dark-skinnedfellow of the name of Moses Bethany cameand bamboozled the entire province (and thetown itself) with his productions of a thinghe called " A Miraculous Play ", in whichthere was nothing sacred at all. But hew hefooled them ! ! !So do read " Nana it tells you howit is done so much better than I can.€jj A strange and sad point made byZola is the amazing infidelity of his Heroine :he is always returning and returning to this.Of her amours I do not speak; I refer to theinfidelity of her mind. And she and mostof her fellow-actresses are adepts at abusingeveryone with their tongues. Yet MadameBerton's pretty book had not then appea- red (1).There is hardly one, favoured or not fa- voured, whom these ladies do not abuse likepickpockets. It is a curious point; ..S.is it trueto life ?Have actresses such utterly unfaithful minds,so little control over their tongues? Do theyreally slander to the extent Zola makes out ?If so, is it due to the constant changing oftheir very nature each night, due to their pro- fession which forces them to this capaciousversatility ? Is it due to this profession thatthey come to behave like nothing real, andsee all real life and living beings as false lifeand false beings,as they open a door on thestage and go on into an unreal existence ? Ithink it is; and so possibly they may beexempt from the blame due to others, for theyhave no sense left of realities.If this be true, then, if they lied theywould lie like truth, making the very truthseem falsehood to it" : this goes without saying.One is not an actress, 1 suppose, for nothing. And yet so many of these great ladies in theParis story are dancers, singers, chorus-girls ;all blended together, as in life, I suppose;journalists, singers, bankers, painters and girls ;an odd crew.... and all so real.One wonders, is the whole book a libel,or is it true ?... or is it mezzo e mezzo. III. NOW it begins to look as though these fewnotes on the Pretty Theatre were soonto develope into the Ugly Theatre.But 'tis no such thing. The prettiness isthere, and under it what is under all else.We shall soon come to pretty Mile. Gui- mard, her mother, Mr Leger and the Mar- quis de Soubise. And Fragonard will stepinto the room ... or rather into that little pri- vate Theatre of hers ; and Fragonard is aguarantee for the perfection of prettiness.A few measurements of her theatre, afew dates as to when the place was putup ....and put up for auction.... cannot de- tract greatly from the charm; dates are inany case valuable as a basis for Terpsicoreto pirouette on.... and even to die on,... for- gotten.Poor Terpsichore, one of " le ballerine "who dominated nGt only the realms of thestage but also those of "la Galanterie ". To be continued. (1) Even today I wince for the Theatre when Zolais so appalling rude about it. Yet Ido not find him old- fashioned although it is the fashion to call him that. Thething which makes him seem so to people of today is thatthey have not read him. If Congreve be up-to-date it isbecause they do read him. Zola is now successfullydisposed of after a struggle, and because he added griefand pain to his tale he is to be shelved. Had he spangledand powdered his heroine at her death and let her laugha little more ironicallyv she and he today would be a lamode. (I) Vide Mask. Vol, X. Page 135. IMITATION.A NOTE BY JAN KLAASSENWITH STORY BY A. DUMAS PERE. IMITATING to perfection is certainly a talent,and it is this special talent which is pos- sessed by the Russians. They derive it fromthe far East.And in the Russian Theatre this talent hasbeen so cleverly employed that it has tho- roughly dazzled Europeans and Americans.With the Russians imitation really be- comes almost masterly. In defence of this it is often with justiceadvanced that Russians are not the only imi- tators : that even Italy was glad to derive fromthe East, and that her Architecture, Painting,house decoration and all is directly inspiredby the East. Nay, more, Eastern artists cameto Italy at a moment when the arts were in asad plight, and helped the Italians to recoverthemselves.But that is quite another matter, and the artof the Italian architects, sculptors, and painters,though derived from Greece or Byzantiumin the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, (0 is arather greater feat than the making of a wigwhich, when worn, is to be taken for growinghair.To derive from another nation is not toimitate slavishly. The Italians have derived,but have not the requisite nature or knack forimitating. The Russians assuredly have boththis nature and the knack.Russia's far-famed Ballet is the fruit ofthis slick talent, and the other forms of Dra- matic art are thought out and executed by menwho possess immense powers of mimicry.By this I do not mean that they take ideasfrom Antoine or from Reinhardt: I mean thatthey take a drama to pieces, find models ofeach piece in life, and then with astoundingpatience, make facsimiles so that you can hardlytell the difference from the originals.Personally I find this very attractive, justas I found the Queen's Dolls' House attractive.It seemed to me to be a real Palace in mi- niature.... all was there.... only a small Pri- vate Theatre was lacking. I admit that mimicry may possibly haveno relation whatever with art: anyhow it in- trigues me.As an illustration of this colossal power ofmimicry I think the following tale by AlexandreDumas pere will please. Dumas visits a private Collection in a smalltown of Southern France belonging toM. Grassei: — " I confess that I expected to see one ofthose poor collections to be met with in pro- vincial towns, with three or four stuffed fishhanging from the ceiling; but I was agreablysurprised to find in the very first room somemagnificent vases by Bernard de Palissy, anda complete collection of stones and mineralsfrom Mount Sinai,—a collection which, pro- bably, could not be found in the Paris Mu- seum of Natural History. Unfortunately I wasnot sufficiently learned in minerology to appre- ciate it properly : I accordingly turned to aquantity of objects of the middle ages, andabove all to some locks and keys, whichwere carved with a taste and skill that wouldhave done honour to Benvenuto Cellini.In this manner we passed successivelythrough four or five rooms, filled with cu- rious objects, the majority of which had beenprocured for M. Grasset by one of his friends,a learned and brave sea-captain, who hadsailed round the world I don't know howmany times, and who had arrived back fromChina about a fortnight or three weeks pre- viously, bringing with him a most singularexample, not of the intellect, but of .the pa- tience, of the worshippers of the Great Dragon.Amongst the different pairs of trouserswhich the captain had had made for him be- fore leaving Paris there was one which wasconsidered a master-piece: it was one of thosemiracles which sometimes issue from the esta- blishments of Vaudeau or Poole, and whichenvelop the boots, indicate the calf, abolishthe knee, mark the thigh, and deny the exis- tence of corporation. Accordingly, thanks tothe predilection entertained for them by theirowner, the trousers, after having flourishedalong the coast, at the Cape of Good Hopeand the Isle of France, arrived at Canton,nearly worn out. Nevertheless, owing to thatfashionable cut of which nothing, not even thefact of being new, can supply the place, they still looked very well, when the Sailor, whoserved as the captain's valet, spilled half theoil contained in af lamp which he was clea- ning, on the very middle of the thigh of theunfortunate pair.This blow, in spite of his philosophy, hadsuch an effect upon the captain, that he hadnot quite recovered from it when one of hisCanton associates came as usual to smoke apipe of opium with him. He found him insuch a state of vexation that he feared somegreat misfortune must have befallen him, andaccordingly enquired what had occurred toalter his habitual good humour. The captainshowed him the unfortunate trousers, which hehad now thrown aside : — " There ! " saidhe, "just look ! The very pair you were com- plimenting me on yesterday ! ".The friend took the trousers, and turnedthem about with the most provoking calm.When he was quite convinced that they couldhot be worn again, he observed : —" Well, you must have another pair made "." Another pair made! " retorted the ca- ptain, " And who's to make another pair,.... some of your Chinese fellows ? "." Certainly, some of my Chinese fellows! "returned the friend with imperturbable coolness." Yes, and get a sack sent to me, madein their regular style! " continued the captain,shrugging his shoulders." They won't make you a sack ", said theother," and, if you only supply them the modelupon which you want them made, they willturn you out a pair of trousers that Vaudeauwouldn't know from his own "." Really ? ", said the captain." Upon my honour ", assured the friend." Weil, I have heard hundreds of times ofthe fidelity of the Chinese in imitation "." And what you have heard upon thesubject has been less than the truth "." By heaven, you make me anxious to trythem" Do try, especially as it won't cost youmuch. How much did you pay for thosetrousers ?" Fifty-five or sixty francs, I don't quiteremember "."Well, you can see what they're capableof doing here for fifteen "." And what tailor must I take them to ? "." The first you come to. Mine if you like,he lives at the gate ". The captain takes his trousers under his arm,follows his friend, and arrives at the tailor's." Now ", said the friend, " explain whatycu want, and I will translate your wordsto him ".The captain did not need to be told twice,and, spreading out the trousers, he pointedout their cut, and ended by saying that hewanted a pair exactly like them. The friendtranslated the order, and laid great stress onthe directions." Very well ", said the tailor, " in threedays the gentleman shall have what he wants"." What does he say? " asked the captainimpatiently."He says you shall have them in threedays "." Three days ! That's a long time ", saysthe captain.The friend translated the captain's remarkto the Chinese, who looked at the trousersagain, shook his head, and said a few wordsin reply to the interpreter."Well?" asked the captain." He says there's a great deal of workto do and that three days are not too longin order to have it done properly "." Well, three days then: but don't let himbreak his word ".And the two friends went away, repeatingtheir directions to the craftsman for the last time,Three days afterwards, as the captain andhis friend were smoking their pipe of opium,the servant opened the door, and announcedthe tailor."Oh ho", said the captain; "Well, letus see if he is as skilful as he is punctual"." There they are " said the tailor." Let's try them ", said the captain as hetook the trousers from the hands of the tailor,put them on, and, in order to be certain thatthey fitted well, told the tailor to draw up theblinds." Why, they fit wonderfully", said thefriend."I should think so" said the captain:" he has given me my old pair. But whereare the others, you stupid ? " he exclaimed tothe Chinese.The friend translated the remark to thetailor, who gave the other pair with a trium- phant look.The captain changed the trousers."Well, I must be mad " said he. " This pair now seems to be mine. Where can thenew ones be ?The friend expressed the captain's doubtsto the tailor, who held out the trousers uponwhich he had just finished working."Well, here is the new pair" said thefriend."No, can't you see they are the oldones ? " replied the captain. " Why hang it,there's the spot of grease ! "." And there's one on the pair you have°n What' fool's wit can this be?"" The friend turned to the Chinese, que- stioned him, and, upon hearing his reply,burst into a shout of laughter "."Well?" said the captain." Well ", said the friend, " What did youorder from this good man " ?" I ordered a pair of trousers "." Like your own "." Yes, like my own"Well, he has made them so like thatyou can't tell the difference that's all. Buthe tells me that his greatest trouble has beento wear them out, and spot them in exactlythe same places ; and that he must charge youfive francs extra, because he failed with twopairs before coming to a satisfactory result;now, however, he defies you to distinguishone pair from the other. You must allowthat that's well worth twenty francs "." Indeed it is ", replied the captain, ashe drew a Napoleon from his pocket and gaveit to the Chinese,The Chinese thanked him, and asked forthe Captain's custom so long as he remainedin Canton, although, he added, if he alwayshad such difficult work given him, there wouldbe no profit on it.From that day the captain could never tellone pair of trousers from the other, so muchalike were they. He brought them both backto France as specimens of Chinese industry,and had promised to make a present of themto M. Grasset. If he kept his word, theymust be far from being the least interestingthings in the collection. MOSCOW and Leningrad are midway" onthe road from Paris to China. Thetrousers may be Parisian, but the trick isOriental; and the net result, as someone hasremarked, the synthetic Orient Express. (/) Those interested in this subject can trace it out ininnumerable works on Italian art. The following are a fewlines taken here and there from the " Renaissance in Italy{Fine Aids) " by J. A, Symonds, referring to the Oriental andGrczco-Roman influences felt by the early masters of archi- tecturey painting and sculpture, such as Cimabue, Niccola Pi- sano, and other thirteenth century artists.41 The Tuscans never forgot the domes of their remoteancestors; the Romans adhered closely to Latin traditions;the Southerners were affected by Byzantine and Saracenicmodelstl The intercourse of Venice with Alexandria determinedthe unique architecture of S. Mark's. The Arabs and Nor- mans left ineffaceable traces of their sojourn on Palermo.....All along the coasts we here and there find evidences ofOriental style imported into mediaeval Italy...." Existing thus in the midst of many potent influences, andsurrounded by the ruins of past civilisation, the Italians re- combined and mingled styles of marked variety. The Roman,Byzantine, Saracenic, Lombard, and German traditions wereblended in their architecture, as the presiding genius of eachplace determined.41 In the Campo Santo at Pisa may still be seen a sarcho- phagus representing the story of Hippolytus and Phcsdra....Studying the heroic nudities and noble attitudes of this bas- relief Niccola {Pisano) rediscover ed the right way of art—not by merely copying his model, but by divining the secret ofthe grand style. "THE SACKBUT" ANDTHE NEED FOR MUSIC. BY GORDON CRAIG. WHENEVER I see " The Sackbut ", that MusicalReview with a gay cover which appears every month,and costs but one shilling, and is altogether quite an achieve- ment, I am always delighted. The production is due to theenergy of Miss Ursula Greville, her managing Editor,and her Committee, which includes, amongst others, P. G.Konody and Granville Bantock.It contains excellent historical articles on Lully, Rossini,John Braham, and other articles by modern writers, ....byKalisch and Gatti on Strauss and Malipiero, it is a mostreadable shillingsworth, and its publishers are J. Curwen andSons Ltd.I would suggest that the need for music is positive, andthat if something can be done to bring it to U3 rather moreoften something should be done.I am today well fitted to say a word for the first timeabout the need for music, for, though I am only an artist,and ignorant of the history of music, and quite unawarewho really is who in the modern stream, I am one whoonce made a daily use of music; I mean i fed on it.And when I can no longer hear it I fear to grow thinat heart; and if it does not come to me I cannot hear it;....and so I starve, for seldom does it come.But I have been hearing it for the last six days. I hearit from four in the afternoon until long past midnight. Andthen I hear it once more in the morning from ten to eleven.Will you know where I am and what it is I hear ?I am in a big town in the north of Italy, having comehere to see and study an old and celebrated Theatre.I lodge in a top-but-one-floor room of a hotel whichlooks on to a very untidy courtyard ; and the courtyard isfull of hangings and cries and thuds and knockings. Thefar-off hum of wheels and motor horns is soothing to myear, which finds the slamming of shutters, the beating ofcarpets, the howls of servants, ringing of big electric bells,and crackling of cutlery and china, something to meet withfortitude.So much for the noise.But, as I said, this noise gives way to music at fouro'clock, No noise could stand up against such music. I ratherlike it; it has the common touch which Mr. Kipling tellsus we should try never to lose. Ido not believe 1 shalllose it; but, spite of Mr. Kipling, to say truly I sometimeswish 1 could. And my wish is in a measure granted, forI lose it in the morning as I will tell you later.This music, from four o'clock to past midnight, whichsweeps the courtyard of all its hideous noises, breaks threa- teningly outside my window in a great splash, and 1 feelin danger. I mean it quite seriously but without offence ;I am threatened by the breakers of modern Jazz music.To this Jazz, millions of people dance each afternoon andevery night when bored by the dull old fashioned tinkleat the Cinema. (It is, I hear, now acknowledged that folkonly go to a cinema for the sake of the music).The first time it attacked me I stood and listened to itwith attention for full ten minutes. Perhaps this show ofrespect for it appeased and propitiated its far-off god andwon for me the favour of its own African particular; forwhen I sat down to listen to it without impatience for thenext thirty minutes I found it bearable. I concluded that I could stay without doubt where I was;need not move to another hotel as for a moment 1 hadfelt I should have to do ; and that 1 could do my work,which, whatever it be, I always enjoy doing, and in moreor less any reasonable surroundings.So I tried to work. 1 got on quite well; though 1admit I was feeling quite ill.For eight days I felt quite ill every time I heard thatmusic, but now I hive grown to rather like it. At firstI believed that I was out of touch with it, because I wasnot down there and in it; and dancing hellishly in the flameswith some deadly serious modern lady who is not such afool as to ask why she does anything but just does it.Well, I don't always like to be outdone by the great,so every afternoon from four to eight and from ten totwelve I will work on through this steaming noise, (which1 am beginning to like) this landing-stage chatter, and askno questions.But its morning now, and up above me a player, Ithink a careful lady-player, has just ended an hour spractice. She has the uncommon touch. Of all tunes tohear coming down to me from on high, one of Chopin'sslighter and loveliest things was the most unexpected. ..and the sun seemed to break through the ceiling.i have heard this piece of music some hundred times ;but not since 1937 have I chanced to hear it.That is a long time to be without something on whichone feeds, and I mention it because it is a serious matter,this starving of the heart.I cannot engage a private orchestra, and I cannot goout to hear music. Very often there is none to go outto hear, i have to work, and regularly. I daresay I couldwork less regularly.So as I cannot hear music in my home by the sea, nearGenova, or go out to hear it, perhaps I ought to stay in thistop-but-one floor room for the rest of my life since I haveagain found music, ....and ask no questions as to its quality.I ought to embrace the full ignorance of the shatteringstrains and move to its blood and thunier rhythm whichis not without decision; allow my new work to be colou- red by its blood and strengthened by its thundering, itsclanging and tumbling form; for there seems a chance thatin the morning the dear lady upstairs may be practising herbit over and over again. These seventeen years I have beenmore or less without all music, and that is, I submit, tobe without a very needful thing.If when 1am at home a man with a dancing bearchances to comes down the road 1 go to the window andwatch and listen ;orif an organ passes and, playing as itpasses, passes away, I go on with my work thoroughlydisturbed, but thoroughly ....and well disturbed as I followit to the last far off note. All that was difficult becomesas easy as laughing then; all that was problematical issolved. Wasn't that music; and isn't that where musicis so magical. And mustn't music come and go like that,....sometimes lingering a while longer, causing us to throwdown the spade or the pen, to stop measuring, and to standstill and silent in our room or our field ?Is not that music ?If it be, when may we expect to be favoured with alittle ?Is Music perhaps a national thing?... if so, then ofcourse each nation will see that it is put in its right place....that it waits its turn. First the tram service, next the matterof drainage, and then that bothersome music.But if music is not a National thing, if it is so good,so easy, so harmless that individuals can deal with it, let them. 1 mean bring it alive again, and bring it in the rightway and the easiest way to everyone who needs it.How ? There must be ten thousand ways besides the44 Merrie England " way. I suggest that the ordinary waymight be discovered.* The organs and the bears and the traffic meantimeremain to cheer us, three or fcur times a year; until, withhearts once more whole again, musicians ccme pouring backto our cities, and we hear many dozens of old tunesagain—as I hear one of mine now on the floor above me.The positive need for music has not, 1 think, just yetbeen made clear to those people who have the control ofmost things in the world, and who, by a little thought,could bring music again into our daily existence.There is Mr. Otto Kahn ; there was Sir Ernest Speyer;they both gave large sums of money I am told to securemusic a hearing in London and New York. There wasthe Comtesse Greffuhle in Paris; there is Contessa Picco- lomini in Roma. These lovers of music have done a little—all they could do—and yet music does not reach meor you or our neighbours.There is Lord Berners ; there is Vaughan Williams andGoossens, and there is Martin Shaw in London. Shaw isassuredly trying to get music to those who need it; andpossibly others are doing something. But as well attemptto send coals from Newcastle in a handbag as leave thedistribution of music to the unaided efforts of the men whoare making it.It's a life's work to create any little tune anyhow;and then to spread it far and wide, that takes a whole life;and Kahn, Speyer, Morgan and Ford cannot give up theirbanking and motor businesses to devote their full time andstrength to the spreading of music far and wide.If they could, it is just such energies who could dothis task ; ....no lesser effort by lesser men can do it.It's folly to fail about music, and failure has beenachieved if we are only to get it by going to a theatre forit—or to a concert.Music means health ; it means light; it means all whicha world today unable to afford most things ciies out fortoday and is refused.I am no prophet, but, had I a prophesying gift, I thinkI would risk a safe word about music.I would say that if you can bring music into the streetsinto courtyards, into museums, into railway stations, into*every place where crowds go and pass from, you can againand again rout scepticism, drunkenness and ill health. Youcan get a long way towards solving half your troublesomemodern problems.But you must do it cunningly, with great art.I will give you two examples, one bad, one good.Music was introduced into a Museum one or two yearsago. I think it was in London at one of the SouthKensington Museums.How was it introduced into this place of wanderingpassages and courtyards gemmed with delicious things tolook at and to stud}', before which hundreds pass along daily,looking at them, and hundreds of others sit studying them ?This is what happened. A closed room was put asidefor the music. Caspita I a closed room for this fairy, forthis thing born with wings which are even now not crushed.Anyone in the museum who happened to find cut thatmusic could be heard there could go away from the silvercaskets, leave the golden frames and the tapestries andhear G concert!Incredible to me is such an innocence of the true natureof music * Is anything mere unpractical, when a world is sick forlack of a little first-aid, than the notice 44 First aid can beobtained by applying for a ticket (Price one shilling) andby going in search of the aidFirst aid has to be brought to the sick for the sickcannot even crawl to where it sits, if it squats in state forthe sake o an exaggerated good form.My second example illustrates this.Outside and below my house by the sea winds a longuphill road. One day last year three men came along thisroad. They were Russians or Poles or some kind offoreigners, and they carried an instrument apiece. Theyseemed to be artists—painters may be—and, walking fromtown to town, they were going towards Roma.As they came along they were playing a strange songof the north. I stopped in my work to listen ; and liste- ning, I put dewn my pencil and rose up quickly andran to call the others. 44 Did you hear the music? " 44 Yes,isn't it lovely".It was indeed very lovely. Nothing wonderful likeStrauss or Debussy perhaps; nor like Beethoven ; but inthe open air and coming tcwards us, these strange wildnotes sounded perfectly lovely and there an end to ar- gument.I ran out into the garden and leaned over the wall;—they had passed, and, getting fifty paces away, had cometo the end of their delicious piece. And they stopped. Theydid not talk or laugh.They were a little weary with their walking I daresay; and besides this, a man full of wine was coming fromthe direction in which they were going, gesticulating andlurching and making those bursting blatant noises whichcome from the drinkers who are less gay than gloomy.He was addressing the heavens, and called on them towitness to the misery that mankind and the governmenthad brought him to.And then this happened. The three young men withthe music, who had sat down by the roadside, stood uparid went towards him surrounding him on three sides,hemming him in like three of Robin Hood's outlaws wouldonce have hemmed in some rich farmer. And before youcould count nine they had begun to play music. Theyplayed it around him, all over him and into him ; and,will ycu believe me, he stopped dead still, uttered never asound, stood steady and with head depressed and turnedon one side listening.They played on for over five minutes. Then withouta word they passed on towards Roma. The drunkardpassed my house leaving them : not a sound, not a stagger,no lurching.The days of miracles are past I knew, but the day ofmusic will never pass.We stand in great need of music today. Is there noone who will bring it to us? PALAZZO BARBERINI.In which was the Theatre built by Bernini. Plate 3. A NOTE UPON"THE MASK". BY LENNOX ROBINSON.REPRINTED FROMTHE OBSERVER. LONDON. BELIEVING that many friends of " The Mask "of the New Movement in the Theatre will be interestedin the following extract from an article by Mr LennoxRobinson published in " The Observer "9 London, onOctober 12th last, we reprint it, for those who may nothave seen it, by kind permission of the Editor of " TheObserver ", Mr /• L. Garvin.% 44 THE BEST THEATRICAL MAGAZINEo IN THE WORLD ' \ oIT may seem an extraordinary thing to say, but 1 amalmost certain that Mr. Gordon Craig is the personage inthe English theatre to-day who most " matters . True,in one sense he is not "in " the theatre at all; he pro- duces nothing, has no theatre of his own, makes a for- tune for no playwright, exploits no players, but, in spiteof these things—or perhaps because of them—he loomswith a dreadful indistinct importance. No man in theEnglish theatre is so hated and reviled, no man so pas- sionately defended and revered.* *A man who can arouse such feelings of hatred andlove can indubitably be no nonentity. People do notguash their teeth and foam at the mouth over somethingthat does not matter, but foam and gnash the theatredoes over Mr. Craig, and he evidently matters to a veryintense degree. It is a little difficult to say just why(though it is easy to say that he is a genius, and thatgenius always makes itself felt), and, turning over thepages of the current number of " The Mask" I tried todiscover what exactly was his secret, and why our attentionis so arrested. For there is no doubt he does arrest it. 45 The Mask " is an amazing publication.I confess that, as a general rule, I am bored to extinc- tion by theatrical history and theatrical memoirs, and thatit is almost inconceivable to myself . that I should findmyself reading with avidity of the plays witnessed byJohn Evelyn in London in the middle of the seventeenthcentury. Extracts from his diary, together with Mr. Craig'scomments thereon, fill a large portion of this " Mask ,and I find myself reading every word greedily. Does myinterest spring from Mr. Craig's passionate, almost pathetic,interest in the theatre, or is it awakened only by his ownfine, vivid style ? But he has the faculty of inspiringothers. Every page of " The Mask ' glows. Comparedwith any other theatrical paper I know, it is as ginger- ale long-opened is to champagne. This yellow magazinebubbles, is gay and provocative and sometimes perverseand absurd, but most often wise and serious, and at everymoment stimulating. It is as easy to imagine falling asleepat one's own execution as nodding over " The Mask ". When I am feeling depressed I wonder whether thereis any " art " of the theatre worth making a pother about,but then the vision rises of this middle-aged Englishmanin Florence (or is it in Rapallo ?) breaking his heart overit, and my spirits rise and I feel there must be somethingfor him to break his heart about. But his heart is verynearly broken. He knows it when, having dreamed ofan interchange (" not as propaganda, but to give delight ")of artists between the countries of the world, he cries out :" I can see this because I am blind. But some one touchesme on the shoulder as I write, and my pen slows down.As though in a train that has stopped at no station,but by some hedgerow; everyone popping heads outfrom the windows and having sensational moments. Butthere is nothing really sensational: rather, a dull fact—thestoker is drunk; and what but intoxicated am I with thishope of what never was and what never will be ? " Andbecause we know that his heart is very nearly broken,we continue to harry him and gibe him (though, as some- one else in the magazine says with perfect ruth, hehas done nothing to interfere with our success in thetheatre), The quarry is panting, is very nearly down;if we can keep the hunt going a very little longer, hewill be only hound's meat. But 1 feel that Mr. Craigwould be the last person in the world to wish anyone tomake a poor mouth about him, and I content myself withsaying that if we have not given him a theatre he hasgiven us the best theatrical magazine in the world. * October 1924..

J. B. |N November, in one final downpour of rain, the Princei of Wales, &gt;in an excellent speech, closed the big EmpireExhibition after what has been undoubtedly a great success.Financial success is not the only success, and of coursethe Exhibition has cost much more money than it tookin. But the Nation, and its exhibitons at Wembley, willobviously win back far more than they will be able tocalculate. I hey will make money, and wonder why, andperhaps not attribute it to this big show. But it is theshow which will have done it all the same.And what of the rain ? The picture of thousandsof soaking Londoners with umbrellas is possibly an endu- ring sight.... would it be any less so had provision beenmade to keep them dry?We suggest that architects be allowed to control thebuilding of future exhibitions ; being practical people, ar- chitects know all about how to protect crowds of peoplefrom great rains and great heat. They employ the arch,the arcade, and many devices to do this. A good architectalso makes a fine looking piece of work, and the EmpireExhibition was not a fine looking piece of work.We also suggest that our next Pageant be somehowmade rather more original, five or six times less vast, andcost a third of the sum.It has surprised many people to learn that the Pa- geant cost a sum of money sufficient to have given Englanda couple of Theatres in which to house its Drama, whichDrama they say is in a poor plight. If it be so, one ofthe reasons would seem to be, that there is too muchmoney in England, not too little. Yet how often do peoplewho, one would think, should know better, privately orpublicly inform all of us who would like to see goodthings well supported that there is no money.What a horrid fib! BOOK REVIEWS. / PROFETI DI BABILONIA byG. F. Malipiero. Bottega di Poesia,Milano. Price 15 lire.THIS Milanese Publishing Companyproduces a quantity of books, someprinted very badly, and some excel- lently. It uses a poor sandy sort ofpaper without sufficient reason : for ifthere is no perfect paper in Italy, youngItalians could soon make some.It is all nonsense nowadaysto say there is no this, no that, withan awakened Italy easily able to makeeverything and make it perfectly.Anyhow, Signor Malipiero makesall he makes perfectly ; and this de- lightful book of scenes, letters, andextracts collected from 18th centurywritings by Chiari, Carlo and GaspareGozzi, Calsabigi, Affo, Algarotti, Ar- teaga, Metastasio, Milizia, and manyothers, with an excellent preface andnotes by Malipiero himself, is as goodas it could be.The subject is the Theatre : theyall speak of the Theatre of their time;and, as they are all serious men, thecollection is an important one, ....insome ways the most important whichexists.The book consists of 438 pages ofadmirable writing with one plate, iswell covered, distinguished in appearance,and costs only fifteen lire. It is, bythe way, dedicated to an Englishman.Fourteen more books are announcedia this series, 44 I Fascicoli Musicali ",of which this is the first.We could do without a good half- dozen of them: for example, 44 Neronedi Boifo " by Guj ; 44 Opera andDrama " by Wagner; 44 Falstaff diG. Verdi " by della Corte ; 44 Beet- hoven " by Rolland; and 44 Debussy"by Perracchio. It is Italians, not Ger- mans and Frenchmen, we want toknow better.As for Boito and Verdi, I some- times fee! that too much time hasalready been devoted to these remar- kably famous composers.More time given to telling us about the lesser known composers and libret- tists and their assistants is what welook for now. More about Pepoli,Albergatti and Contarini, and theirhouses and teatrini : more of Bibienaand his family, of the Galliari family,of the Mauri (or Mauro) family : ofF. C. Motta, of Petronio Nanni, andRivani; of the singers and dancerswho are out-shaddowed today by theeternal 4 4 return visit " of Farinelloand Cafarello.What of Sancta Stella, and Pi- stocci, what of architects like Sighizzi?How is it that seemingly no book orbooklet exists telling us all about hisservice to the Theatre ?I believe all these figures wait forSignor Malipiero to give them placeand prominence, in a new book, forhe has a way of dealing with thesefine things and people which does ho- nour to them. WOMAN IN WORLD HISTORY.HER PLACE IN THE GREATRELIGIONS, by E. M. White.Herbert Jenkins. 8/6 net.WE dont quite like the title of thebook : ....however. Do we likethe book ? In it the author is statedto have 44 ransacked the ages and roam- " ed the world to trace woman's44 influence in the story of civilization,44 with special* reference to the great44 religions, and to their effect on the44 position of womanhood. As the44 term religion has been taken in its44 broadest sense, it has included all44 the social and artistic spheres which44 each religion has touched, and thejre- 44 fore the book covers nearly all the44 field of woman's hisjtory. The aim44 has been appreciation before criticism,44 and the conclusions reached are44 neither anti-man nor anti-feministCertainly, in her 395 pages, MissWhite gives us a great deal that isinteresting in regard to the life ofwomen, from primitive times, and downthrough ancient Egypt, Babylonia andAssyria, through Hinduism, Buddhism,Mahammedanism and Judaism, throughancient Greece and Rome, and downfrom the beginning of the Christian Erato the present time : and her work isthe more useful because it is non-pole- mical : she has neither the frenzieddesire to prove that woman is at allpoints the equal of man 44 only bettera desire, even if one which is neverrealized,lhat characterizes certain ....toocertain.... feminist writers : nor has shethe inborn contempt for women whichdetracts from the value of the writingsof certain virulent anti-feminists. Her only aim is to trace down through theages certain influences which reactedupon, and emanated from, one half ofthe human species ; and the ways inwhich, in different periods, they roseto or lapsed from the fullest accom- plishment of their especial functions andprivileges as individuals and in relationto man and to the human family atlarge. It is not an unambitious aim,and we would recommend this bookto the study of those who have oftendisputed the conviction, now and againexpressed by writers in " The Mask *\that women are not exactly in theirright place upon the stage : they maylearn here that it was not any sign ofthe belittlement of women by men, orof degradation, or undue weakness ontheir own part, when they preferredto hold their lives aloof from publicity,and especially from what a Russianauthor has called "an amorous display'*before a public, for that spoilt public'sentertainment.It is a vexed question, I mustadmit ; whether it be better to sufferthe slings and arrows, or to take armsagainst a sea ... and end the troubles.And I for one rather like to seeone role always acted by a woman :I refer to the part of " Hamlet,..."with of course a man in the role ofthe " player queen MASKS AND DEMONS.

Martin Hop- kjnson : London : 15/— net.WE already referred to this bookin July 1924 when it reached usfrom its American publishers, MessrsHarcourt, Brace &amp; Co ; we are gladnow to see that a English edition hasappeared, and would recommend alltheatre students to secure a copy forthe sake of the large number of excel- lent illustrations it contains of masksof many nations, and the entertainingtext, RESTORATION COMEDY byBonamy Dohree. The ClarendonPress. Oxford. 6/— net.THE Publishers announce that"This44 book gives a general view of4 4 Comedy in the period from Etherege44 to Farquhar, and places certain aspects44 of Restoration Comedy in a new44 light. It investigates more thoroughly44 than has yet been done the vexed44 question of French influence, and44 proves by ample quotation that Res- 44 toration Comedy was, in the main,48 a natural development of late Eliza- 44 bethan work. But the principal 41 content is a description and criticism44 of the work of the chief writers44 of the period, apart from any44 theory ".Yes, and the whole thing is welldone; but where are the plays ?This charming book of 182 pagesgives us quite a number of passagesfrom the plays, as though the authorhad really felt as he went along thathe really couldn't continue to talk,(and talk so well) about them whilewe, his hearers, were left utterly in thedark as to what he was talking about.So he strikes a wax vesta now andagain and points to the pictures : 44 Yousee what I mean ", he seems to sayas he quotes a bit; at which outgoes the quotation, and we are againplunged in obscurity.The fact is there are very few ofus who know these plays well enough ;and I feel that Mr Dobree's ten chapterswould have been only in their rightplace as prefaces to the plays of thesix authors on whom he discourses.Without the plays the book is butdelightful meandering.On page 138, for example, Mr Do- bree tells us that, 44 a thread of sadness44 and disillusion runs through these44 plays, and live passions break through44 the veil of cynicism wherewith the44 critical comedy clothes itself. We44 pierce through the social world to44 the realm of our underlying motives,44 to our ardours and desires, for beauty44 as well as for grosser satisfactions ;44 and Congreve reveals himself as a44 poet pleading for finer living ".Well, the thread of what you willmay run where it likes, but unless wecan be helped to follow it we areprone to grow a little sleepy.It is of no use to say that wenierce through the social world ", andthat 44 Congreve reveals himself ", for,lacking the plays, no such blessed re- velation can be ours.In short, speech about a thing lacksall sanity without the hearers are firsttold what it's all about and until theycan judge for themselves. A vaguerecollection of Shakespeare is somethingto us when we come to read Coleridgeon his plays. And besides, we allhave a Shakespeare in the house. Butwhen it comes to a play by Etheregeand Shadwell, or even Congreve, unlessthe play be in the same volume andjoined to the discourse about it, weshall never be lured by the orator toread the play, to go out and hunt fora copy, to buy the play or listen to theorator; and it's quite likely we shalldamn the best orator and wonder whythe publisher didn't have enough faith so die Drama itself and had too muchin the critic of it.It is futile to hope that we shallbe sent by Mr Dobree to Eiherege,for there is not time in 1925 for eventhe average man to go trotting around ;and I for one will wager that very fewof the exceptional men will have timeto do so.Besides, there are too few and tooexpensive Congreves and Ethereges inthe market. WANTED a shillingCongreve: ,.,.and for our part wewant that volume prefaced by MrDobree.Yes, there's something in it, isn'tthere ? LIFE OF WILLIAM CONGREVEby Edmund Gosse C. B. Heinemann.7/6.MR Gosse is always gallant, and sohe was one of the earliest, if notthe very first, to write the Life ofCongreve.He might have written the life ofEtheridge, but what would there havebeen gallant in such an act as that ?No. Congreve the bore, that's theman to stand by, to prop up, forcebefore the Public, stick to, and finallytriumph with.That's the splendid English gallantryof it, and in Mr Gosse gallantry glowswith a steady flame.When I speak of Congreve as abore, I only mean that he fails to bebrilliant like Etheridge or powerful likeWycherley. He meanders, he has grace,he is charming, .... he is, in fact, aperfect bore.What pains he is at to make nofaults, this perfect Congreve. But itis Mr Gosse and his book we have toconsider, and it seems to me as goodtoday as it was when it first appearedsome years ago.Written probably with great difficulty,it has about it all the signs of easywriting.What is known of Congreve is alithere, and what is known is reallyhardly worth recording.How remarkable then that so greatan impression has been made with thisbook upon ali of us. THE THEATRE: IDEAS ANDIDEALS. J. W. H. Faulkner.A. Stockwell, London. 2/—.I wonder whether Mr Faulkner isquite correct in his statement that" the first Theatre was built by theGreeks between three and four hundredyears before Christ M? I have an idea that theatres existedlong before that.And I wonder, is Mr Faulknercorrect when he says that 44 An Exhi- 44 bition of Paintings, a Concert, a44 Recital of Verses, a Display of Dan- 44 cing.... none of these are entertain- 44 ments ".1 wonder what he would call Po- litics, as we receive them daily throughthe newspaper. I, who am a theatre- goer, rather resent seeing so muchdrama made out of politics in ourDaily Papers. It makes me quite bo- red when I go to hear a play.The ideas and ideals set forth inthis little booklet of 32 pages arefreshly stated and familiar to us. Themore often they are repeated (providedanyone listens) the better for the Londonstage.Unfortunately in London hardlyanyone has time to listen, except tohis own voice. What with having toget through a hard day's work, andhaving to sit through the wrong playat night, (for it's difficult to back awinner each time), listening has to beput off until our August days at Mar- gate, when all we want to listen tothen is what are the tame waves saying.But everyone belonging to the Bri- tish Drama League should assuredlypurchase this two shillings's worth ofIdeas and Ideals, and do their verybest to spread them through the lengthand breadth of the land.But the first thing to do is to per- suade people to listen, SMARAGDAS LOVER ; A Dra- matic Phantasmagaria by W. /. Tur- ner. Chatto &amp; Windus. 5/-MR W. J, Turner has a verystrong, a very genuine sense ofthe Theatre. It is needless to tellhim he avoids coming to the ordinaryHecuba or to warn him not to betempted away by unrealities, for it isjust by wandering exactly where hewanders that he will come across thereal lady, There will then be nodoubt at all what Hecuba is to himand he to Hecuba. Shell be rightthere, tragic or comic as he wills.Meantime, spite of this essential giftof his, he has not come across herthis time. But he is almost there.This is not a little to be able tosay. For he hasn't been looking forher in any of the places she longago left.His Phantasmagoria is a wierd andenchanting comedy which I think theEnglish actors of our day could make verylittle out of. When you have read it, if you have an eye to its exploitation on themodern stage, you more than likely closethe volume with the word 44 unsatis- factory " but what else can a thingof this kind be ? is not a Phantasma- goria 44 a crowd or succession of dimor doubtfully real figures " ?In any event it is good reading forit moves along and without effort, solong as one remembers that nothing isquite real. Sometimes it exceeds evenunreality, not only in the situations butin the very speeches, as, for example,when the Prime Minister in the playsays of Sir Leo Edward Meyer,44 Extraordinary people these Jews!All the world s shadiest transactionsare done in their houses but neverby them ".Again i come to the principal de- fect in all plays, and that is not anyfault committed by the authors. Thisdefect is that we are fast asleep inEngland so far as our Theatre is con- cerned. Proof: This.... Were we awakewe would of course produce this dramawithin the month; and the same au- thor's 44 Popomac " play would havecome (come and gone, or come andstayed) at least a year ago.But no, we are asleep. And howwe dream, to be sure. We dreamthat by selecting what we think to beexcellent plays made in the right waywe may get at last at the plays.Gloriously comic, crazy, dream. Weshall get at last at the plays if weproduce without any pausing or anysilly sort of superior hesitation, everyplay which every writer of even fairtalent, has the courage to pen.We shall produce them cheaply,rapidly and well. It is quite easy todo it cheaply and well provided you'rerapid about it.We shall thus put upon the stagemany hundreds of new plays each year,three or four of which will provetheir worth, thirty, or forty their promise,and some hundreds will pass away.We (sleeping) dream that we canbe cleverer than that. Utter delu- sion.In any case I hope Mr Turnerwill write and publish every play thathe has even the faintest desire to writeand publish, even if the London stageis not yet awake: for we want to seeall that he has in his imagination;technically we see what he might doshould he wish to; but if the Theatrewill go on dreaming he cannot exactlyexercise that wish to any great extent.The English stage is in the condi- tion it was in years ago, Men of ta- lent exist who should be given Thea- tres so as to wake it up. Till it wakes up the work of thousands of writers,actors, producers, will be wasted, andI do not believe England can affordto waste in this manner, I wont call itshameful; it is merely excessively stupid A GUIDE TO CAPER by ThomasBodkin and Denis Eden. (Chatto &amp;Windus). 5 shillings. C. AT'OU follow the pictures, not thetext, of this Guide,... if you wantto get there: but the text helps.It's the best five shillings* worth Ihave seen for many a day. Mr Edenis a new name to us, but there is no- thing at all of the beginner about hiswork.The second picture, the last picture,the ninth, tenth and eleventh picturesall play with light. If the sun is downthe moon shines; or a fire, or the starstwinkle, and it is this light which givesus so much happiness when we lookat these inhabitants of Caper, living themost sensible existence man could everlive, even after thinking about it foryears.I am an entire admirer of this ar- tist. I have nothing to find faultwith,... the whole thing is perfect.And not the least perfect thing aboutit is Messrs Chatto &amp; Windus's ins- tinct or judgement, in having recogni- zed in Mr Eden an artist of first classfancy. Just as courtesy is in everytouch, so is there courtesy in the wayit has been brought out.Charm is a word which extends tohoydens, Mrs Jordan was charmingThis book is more than that.... andthe way it has been issued by thepublishers, its paper, its covers, wrap- per, title page and all, reveals an un- derstanding for which I can find nobetter word than courtesy. If tenthousand copies be not sold quite soon I shall be very much surprised. THE SLEEPING BEAUTY byEdith Sitwell. Duckworth. 5/- net.A poem of 96 pages is an achieve- ment. I suppose Miss Sitwell alover of the more eleborate drawingsby Aubrey Beardsley.Never having read anything of hersbefore this is my impression.First that there are seasons andseasons for poems. I feel that thisone came out in the wrong season.I am in a cold room as I read thispoem, and I wonder why it does notgo easily. Not Miss Sitwell's fault, butmine to be so placed twixt the cold andthis deep sea.Obviously Miss Sitwell is full of gifts, clever, a poet, ....a graceful one;and with an ability to go on.As I read it I find myself unableto believe that the Sleeping Beauty isa theme any poet could make anythingmore out of than has Miss Sit well. JUDAS. A Tragedy in Three Actsby Claude Houghton. 7he Four SeesCo. Boston. 2.00.I do not think that everyone andanyone should be at liberty to takeup a pen and write tragedies in threeacts or in four.If they do so, and fail to writewell, I see no reason why they shouldever do it again.Mr Houghton has done ill, and Ihope his next will be free from allthat I find in this play.

EDITORIAL NOTES. THE ITALIAN THEATRE. THE old Italian Theatre, and bythat we mean its professional Thea- tre as it is today, pleases us so muchthat, unless very fine innovations aremade, we would respectfully suggestthat it is perhaps better for the Ita- lians to avoid novelties.Their Theatre is not the first inEurope because of the elegance andcomfort of its poltrone and its palchi(there England and America lead),nor because scenographically it is suf- ficient, or because it is developing anew group of excellent playwrights.It is first by virtue of its first-classacting and singing, because acting andsinging come to Italians apparently withimmense ease ....not because of anycleverness, which after all is a verysmall thing at best.First they have a language; theyknow how to speak it : they nevermumble, drawl, are never foggy; allis crisp, deliberate, and rapid. Theyknow how to carry themselves ; theyare born professionals; they 44 actthey do not pretend to deceive usthat they are 44 real ".Yet while acting they never play at44 make believe " ; they do not imi- tate toy soldiers and fashion plates andstatuary. While they are never unrealin that sense, 44 Realism " has neverbeen thinkable to them, for they knowwhat is what, and find Realism aslaughable as they find forced arti- ficiality depressing.This it is which we think placesall Italian actors in another sphere tothe actors of Russia, who are born*realists and deuced serious about it all,or born copyists of statuary, engra- vings, wooden toys and the like. Ita- lian actors are not like German actors,who are always earnest and clever butnever quite the thing. Certainly En- glish actors are the most gentlemanlyin Europe; and French actors, everthe neatest; but Italian actors are ac- tors before Abraham was,So that when nowadays innovationsare made in the way that the 44 Indepen- denti the 44 Tetiteairo " or T6thys- Theatre make them, or as Signor Bra- gaglia makes them, we regret to saythat they ring false. The 44 innovators "do nothing original.It is all what we call rather cheap.We have seen the designs for thenew 44 Teatro del Convegno " and itstrikes us they are curiously poor.If Italy possessed the knack for imi- tating northern nations, it would nothave waited twenty years to seize onthe notion used- now as an inn vationfor the new stage of the 44 Teatro delConvegno ".The 44 Piccola Canobbiana " de- signs for stage machines and audito- rium and proscenium are no better.Sironi's designs for 44 I cavalieri "are influenced by northern notions butare not at all good.As for Signor Bragaglia, he hasmuch excellent energy, little judgmentand no originality. He catches holdof all the notions he can find in thebooks of the last twenty-five years,and on a small stage he manages tohuddle them all together, bringing outmuch printed matter to announce theirexistence. The whole effect is that ofa mis-fit. Of course he does notadmit where he has gathered most ofthese notions : he seems to think thatthey are public property. By thus usingthem he becomes one of the public.We don't like it a bit. Signor Bra- gaglia can, we feel sure, do better, ....ordo less. It's not at all worthy of theimmense tradition of the Italian stage.Italians have imagination, have alwayshad it. So that to echo and to copyis, in an Italian, very poor, and in noway represents the new spirit whichhas inspired Italy to stand on its ownmerits in all things, and which seemsto possess enough force to last out thecenturies.The Facist Theatre, when it comes,will be one of the blossoms of thisNew Italy which today has no timeto turn to thoughts of blossoming, sinceits sole thought is the natural one, ....thatof spreading roots.Plenty of time for the arts later on.Inevitably those arts will blossom intime. Meanwhile these sad attemptsto 44 innovate " in the grand Italiantheatre are rather ridiculous; and thenotion that the Italian spectators, aretaken in cannot be maintained for amoment. A POET'S THEATRE. MR John Masefield has built him- self a theatre at Boar's Hill, nearOxford." What ridiculous nonsense " is the verdict of those folk who cannot al- low that a Theatre may be other thanthe swagger Teatro Fenice in Veneziaor the Prinz Regenten in Munchen.As though Selva and Semper (orwhoever built the Wagner Theatre)are to be the only model husbandmen.Who knows better than a Dramaticpoet what kind of Theatre is suited to hisplays ? We understand that the PoeticDrama by several poets will be presentedby Mr Masefield at his playhouse, whichis a simply constructed building in hisgarden, and is designed to accommodateabout one hundred persons. A firstproduction has been already given, andafter Christmas it is hoped that an Eliza- bethan comedy may be produced. Thestage is broad and sceneries are notgoing to be allowed to be a nuisance.One London paper was cruel enoughto say that 44 artistic curtains " wouldbe used in place of the sceneries. Asa matter of fact we believe that MrMasefield has around him a group ofdisciples, not studying how to write,but helping Mr Masefield how to playat theatres.And in our. opinion to play at Thea- tres in England is the very best thingone could possibly do. And if in thecountry, the country wvay of doing thisis ihe right way. That is why weutterly disbelieve the shocking suggestionof 44 artistic curtains Country thatchcountry wattles, country oak planks,,.,any of these as a background if youlike; there is danger in 44 artistic curtains "they are apt to catch fire. But then thiswould assuredly bring Mr Masefield'splayhouse all the advertisement fromwhich we think a country theatre shouldbe entirely exempt, but which the prac- tical man, even if he be in the desert,thinks is necessary.The unfortunate fate of too manya country playhouse is that it becomesthrough advertisement, just what thepoet would hate it to be, ....what thepoet never for a moment suspected itwas being lured to be; that is to say,a bit of a sensation.We recall the fate of several coun- try, or semi-rural, playhouses, Before ayear was out someone (assuredly notthe Poet) had been over-energetic;(that 4 practical * person over again) ithad been dragged or pushed up toLondon, where it played a while andwent out, puff, like a lamp.Why, after having chosen a noblerural spot as the place of places fora Theatre, a dash should be made atthe first chance for London, is puzzling.Goethe, who played with Theatres,played with a real playhouse ....inWeimar.... with a Court as well as the towns-people as spectators. Heworked hard at this playhouse of his,and it was even less than the poodleyou will remember which caused hisdownfall as Theatre Director. It waseven Fraulein Caroline Jagemann.And there have been other poets whofor a time have had little playhouses.Voltaire had one at Ferney. Here,about 1776, Lekain stopped for somedays to perform to a select and ap- preciative audience. At Cirey, too,Voltaire had a playhouse of his own :and some years earlier had one in hisvilla at Vernier, but we never hear ofhim suddenly carrying his charming ifamateur troupe to Paris or Berlin.We have not seen any drawings orengravings of these Theatres, but in1772, (about the time of the Ver- nier theatricals) it was customary tobe too magnificent rather than toosimple. The playhouse was a wordwhich stood for something with style,a sparkle of swagger in it. The poetAlbergatti liked things to look well- dressed, and so his theatre in Zolanear Bologna was the very thing. Alittle bit of a village this same Zola,but then a big piece of a Chateau,and in the Chateau some Teatrinoas Mr Stein would say, to seat threehundred people. And the poet Pe- poli.... how many theatres he built inhis houses in Venezia and Bolognaand in his villas at Codalunga andelsewhere has net yet been decided.But it is on record that he not onlyhad his own plays and those of otherpoets performed in them, but alsooperas in prose and ballets, in whichPepoli danced, 44 the best dancer ofthem all " says the historian.But of all private country theatresthat at Esterhaz, where Haydn livedfor many years writing his divine thingsfor the only quite divine performers....for marionnettes.... is the country thea- tre we like to think of most. Haydnand Masefieid would have got on welltogether, we believe. What a pitythat the old Count Esterhazy of thosedays is no more among us to show usall how.... exactly how.... a countrytheatre should be set before the King :—or rather before himself and hishousehold. But as he is not with us,and as no lord seems to have retainedthe old tricks that lords once played,we must be content when a poet orany other artist rigs out a theatre forhimself. It's not the thing to do;...' Art for Art's sake' is no fun at all;and theatre for theatre's even less: butwhat would you ?... when a poet isat the same time a grand Signore hecan do these things as some of us think they should be done ; when hehas only his crown of laurels, even ifhe do them better, he cannot do themas they should be done.Mr Masefieid will do them like a sim- ple English poet, and that means he willdo them just as well as they can pos- sibly be done ; and those of us whocannot be there, will feel envious of thosewho can, and who will hear beautifulverse spoken as it should be spoken.See plate 2 and Page 35 for someidea of what a little private Theatremeant in the 28th centmy, Ed. VALUELESS NEWS.THE Observer in its issue for No- vember 2nd. had an exceptionallyfunny twenty-five lines about a BerlinTheatre. Here it is : —EVEN BERLIN SHOCKED.THE DRAMATIC THE A TRECOMES TO GRIEF.The movement of a few enthu- siasts to help forward the great bandof unacted dramatists has received acrushing blow. The new " DramaticTheatre ", which opened with everyencouragement from the critics, andwhich produced George Kaiser's (t Bil- les and Jeanne " as its first venture,has since alienated every type of au- dience by a succession of extravagantplays violating all canons of goodtaste even in so exceptionally broad- -minded a city as Berlin.The result is a triumph for thewatchful Clerical Centre party, whosemembers have their own theatre league,but needed their own house. Whilethe Social-Democrats support their ownexcellent '' People's Theatre *whichcarefully avoids plays of reactionarytendency, the tf Dramatic Theatre "has now become the home of the po- litical Catholics, whose taste in dramais characterised not so much by pro- paganda as by elimination. This rulesout, for instance, not only three-cor- nered problems, but divorce in itsentirety. This is a triumph for theideals of the Centre, which would passunnoticed in a Catholic province, butis a sign of its renewed activity inBerlin.q What foolery and what cliches !Really, it is time to ask even thiswell-nigh perfect journal to make ascrap of its Foreign Theatre Correspon- dents and start afresh.For some time we have studiedcarefully the theatrical news sent to44 The Observer " from Wien, Berlin,and Budapest; and have wondered howlong Mr Garvin would let it go on. Why is foreign theatrical newsnecesary to 44 The Observer unlessit be either very entertaining or veryinforming ?We suppose that the only peoplewho feel the necessity are those whoare ever active in informing Londonthat the North European Theatre isquite the most important upon earth.Hundreds of English actors doubt- less read 44 The Observer ", but theywill surely not be impressed by thenonsense which week after week issent from Wien, Berlin and Pest.For example what the dickens isthere of interest in this twaddle fromBerlin about some Theatre which is44 the home of the political Catholics "and " whose taste is characterised byelimination " ? And how comes it thatthis or any taste 44 rules out " divorcein its entirety, and how is this 44 atriumph for the ideals of the Centre " ?And then, 44 Catholic province 44 re- newed activity 44 watchful clericalcentre party ", 44 broadminded city ofBerlin".—Really, 44 Observer " ! youwho are the very pride of journalismand our delight, to accept such Pro- paganda from the Theatre of Elimi- nation in Berlin is not what you cameinto existence to do. To hear fromWien or Budapest that an audiencehas sat spellbound, or that one couldhave heard a pin drop, hardly carriesas far as London.Besides, what Austria and Germanydo in Theatres is not half as importantas the good 44 Observer" seems tothink. If there is space that needs fill- ing, we know of a good number of peo- ple who could make that space glitter.There is much being done in theEuropean and American Theatre weekby week; but, strange as this maysound to some ears, it is not alwaysto be found inside a playhouse.For example, a book now andagain appears which does more toadvance the European Theatre thantwo years of energetic acting and pro- ducing will do. Yet we hear nothingof this book,... or next to nothing. Afoolish conference is held, and it is re- ported gravely. Or a new society for- med, and reported as gravely. No dis- cernment is shown by the reportstwixt what is of value and what worth- less. This is a pity and a great wasteof valuable space, time and money.11 Observer n will pardon this pre- sumption from the smallest serious paperon earth to the largest and most im- portant;... but it is w The Mask's *speciality, this little matter of Thea- tres. Like all specialists it thinks itknows. Who knows,... perhaps it may. VENEZIA AND PROGRESS.TO judge from some recent articlesin 44 The Manchester Guardian **and 44 The Daily Telegraph " peopledo not seem to realize in England thatItaly is not a Museum or a Theatre,and that its Cities, however superb,have no wish to crumble just to obligethe tourists and the archeologists.Italy looks on it that life comesfirst, and all the rest comes after.And if electric motors are to beof any aid towards bringing to lifepart of Venezia or of any other city inItaly, what sort of being is it that willcry out about this? Venezia and thecities of Italy are not for him, theyare for those who live and work anddie there.44 The Mask " is all for the Arts.You know that, we think. But onlyfor Art which comes along because apeople is alive. When a city is dead,a nation drugged, a continent dulled,Art had better wait awhile in thatcity, nation or continent.True, perhaps, that around somecities (did the Italian nation wish it)a wall or a line might be drawn withorders given that it was too good anexample of ancient work to be dis- turbed. Such a place might be ropedoff and put apart as a National Mo- nument, and outside its walls a newcity built. Inside its walls the veryplainest but cleanest accommodationmight be provided for all who wishedto study and work there in the monu- ment, as in a vast Biblioteca, andspecial permissions granted to such onthat understanding. We have oftenfelt that cities like Venezia or San Gi- mignano might well be reserved forsuch a purpose.But if the cities must be used, andmust be brought up to date, why not?Where is Shakespeare's, Bacon's andElizabeth's London ? Has the loss ofthat particular place (and lost it is)been no gain ? And if Titian's, Tie- polo's and the Doges* Venezia shouldpass, where would be the loss ? Tous, yes; to you, yes, to many thou- sands yes, ....but to many millions,probably no. What use in architecturefor which the millions of people have nocare, which new laws no longer love ?Gondolas are pretty boats, and toglide is sometimes a pleasant necessity,and a canal is not always as bad asit seems. But, since Shakespeare's Playsare not valued by us, Englishmen hadbetter, we think, pause before too has- tily criticizing their Venetian friends.How comes it that we Englishcriticize ? Is it just because we somehow be- lieve Venezia to belong to us, ....to beour honeymoon spot, our playground.And what are we ? a nation ofpeople more forward than any in prai- sing speed, electricity, cinema, liste- ning-in ; ....and we quickly produce amillion pounds if promised a safe in- vestment in something up-to-date anda curse to everyone.In Manchester we weakly give overa poor cheap little National Theatreto a Cinema firm : with a lot of wordprotest yet without real resistence, weyield it up; yet we have the audacityto tell Venezia from Manchester to keepitself unspotted from the monopoly forthe supply of motors.Private enterprise could have savedfor Manchester its Theatre Royal; andhad the 44 Manchester Guardian " spo- ken with the spirit it so often showsin other matters, (ie, in money matters)no commonplace motor-driven cinemacould have come into the TheatreRoyal.When Manchester can save oneTheatre, and a grand old place like theTheatre Royal, it will be quite timeenough for Manchester to lecture Ve- nezia. AS OTHERS SEE ....LONDON. J. S. CAN anyone tell us what causedSir Alfred Butt or the DruryLane Committee to piace Mr BasilDean at the head of Drury LaneTheatre ?According to George Jean Nathanof New York, Dean would seem tobe a man of very- small talent, asthe following passage from an articlein 44 The American Mercury " willshow. Dean has been over in NewYork producing plays. We want tosee a man put into Drury Lane whohas no time to go to New York orNewhaven to produce anything.Nathan says that 44 It is not James44 Elroy Flecker's 44 Hassan " that has44 failed, it is Mr Basil Dean's. Flecker44 wrote a play rich in the music of44 romance and poesy, as beautiful a44 thing of its kind as has appeared44 in recent dramatic literature; Dean44 staged it with all the imagination44 and rhythm of a sailor's smoker.44 The production, indeed, served as a44 piquant example of the low level to44 which the English stage, in this44 respect, has sunk. Dean is regarded44 as one of the best and most artistic44 of London producers, Over here,44 they do finer work up alleys.44 I have passed an eye over seven 44 or eight of Dean's productions, three44 in New York and the others in44 England. All of them have been44 drolly incompetent. Not only has44 the gentleman apparently no sense of44 the dramatic, not only is he seeming- 44 ly quite innocent of the technic of44 projecting a manuscript over the44 footlights, but he is, to boot, utterly44 without a sense of beauty and a44 sense of form. His ideas of scenic44 investiture go back to the day when44 furniture was painted on the back- 44 drop and when a 4 big production *44 was any one in which the stage44 was so packed and crowded with44 scenery and irrelevant but costly44 props that the actors had to make44 their entrances from the wings side- 44 ways. His ideas of lighting are so44 absurdly antiquated that even some44 of the most patriotic London re- 44 viewers have difficulty in concealing44 their derisory hiccups. For Dean44 appears to believe that all that is44 necessary to achieve some exception- 44 ally nobby illumination effects are44 a half dozen vari coloured gelatine44 slides supplemented by an indefati- 44 gable fellow stationed at the dimmer.44 He sought to evolve mystery with44 a mere blue light and romance with44 a pink one. In the matter of dra- 44 matic suggestion, he was equally44 unhappy. His scenes of melodrama44 were painstakingly languid ; his scenes44 of physical passion, as, for exam- 44 pie, the one wherein the fair Yasmin44 conquers the flesh of Hassan, were44 as sexual as playing postoffice.44 Thus was a beautiful poem with44 its beautiful incidental music of Fre- 44 derick Delius and with all its poten- 44 tial stage wonder reduced to no- 44 thing ".This comes of being possessed of anability to push into Drury Lane with- out credentials. This comes of dis- honest theatrical Criticism.London is slowly being made alaughing stock by this sort of thing,and it is time the London Press saidso clearly.Unfortunately Walkley, Archer,Grein and a few others do nothing toimprove matters. They either are cy- nical about our stage or gush aboutits worst elements. Not that Walkleyor Archer err about playwrights; butto Theatricals they are sense-blind.Grein is not blind; he is merely ut- terly unfitted for a responsible positiou as a critic of our English Theatre. ON A DESIGN BY SANGALLOAN INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM. J. S. A DESIGN BY ANTONIO SAN GALLO IL GIOVANE (1485-1546) SHOWING DEVICE FOR ATRIANGULAR SCENE FOR A THEATRE,from a hitherto unpublished design in the Uffizi Library, Firenze. Plate 11. IN our last two Symposiums we invited the Actors, Managers andCritics to the table. This time we invite the Architects, Designersand Scholars.They are more bashful and so respond with rather less rapiditythan did the performers and the critics. But we believe that the fewanswers will prove of considerable interest to our readers, all of whomcan suggest solutions to the difficult problem for themselves.We think that most of the writers have come to a solutionbut for us the matter still remains unsolved. A PRELIMINARY NOTE ABOUT THE DESIGN. THIS design is by Antonio San Gallo the Younger (1485-1546) and isreproduced for the first time from the original drawing in the Uffizi Libraryin Firenze.I It is for a Theatre, showing the stage, scene and spectators seats.The special thing which has concerned the artist is a revolving triangular scene foreach side of the stage.What exactly was this scene to do or what it do. It looks to us likea bit of a puzzle, and for this reason interesting.Was the triangular scene raised up above the ospitii or rooms ? Was it behindthem ? If behind, where did it show ? Was the front side of the Ospitii a transparency ?Or was there hung a square of cloth in front of the two top portions of theospitii which, when raised, revealed which ever side of the triangle was turned tofit the opening left exposed ?The square opening indicated on the left side of the scene suggests the later notion.The date of the drawing, about 1515 to 1530, makes it worth while studying.For Palladio was but born in 1518 dying in 1580 and did not erect hisfirst stage until 1565, and not till 1 545 did Serlio's second Book of Architecture appearwith its scenic section : only in 1 539 did he build his wooden Theatre in Vicenza.This San Gallo (for there were six in all) is supposed to have assisted Raf- faello and Bramante, both of whom concerned themselves with the questions of scenes,machines and stages. Is this perhaps some record of Raffaello's work in Rome ?Among San Gallo's contemporaries in scenic work were Peruzzi, Aristotile,Genga and Pericoli.Vitruvio's book had appeared for the first time about 1486—one year afterSan Gallo's birth : so this is an early document. Miss Campbell in her admirablebook " Scenes and Machines " (1923) does not mention it or its designer.Scholars and artists will note several interesting points besides the two revolvingtriangular scenes.WE therefore put the following questions :1. How were these triangular side scenes used ?2. Can anyone say for what play ?3. Were there but three scenes on each triangle or were others attached asthe play progressed,—ie. a new one for each " ascione " or "action" or scene?4. Is this the artist's sketch for work to be done, or is it a record by the artistof work he had seen done ?Besides answers to these questions we invited any additional information orsupposition no matter how extravagant. Without dashing in with a guess or two,how arrive at any solution of what seems to be one of the most interestingexamples of the use of triangular side scenes.WE also felt it would be of interest to other students if one or two answers could begiven on the following points :—(IB) What were the ospiiii and why so called ?(2B) Why was the place for the spectators called Teatro and not the whole building?(3B) What is the foro and why on the plan does it take such space? How was it!used ?(4B) Have we aula regia correctly translated ? was it a fixed scene fit for tragedy ? — or what was it ? THE ANSWERS. BRUNO BRUNELL1. (Cortina d'Ampezzo).1. I hold that the triangular "machine "~~ geared behind the " ospitii " through anrture which was opened every time theHb. \ action required it, as appears from the perspec- tive drawing of the stage right hand side. Theposition in which the " macchina " appearson the left side must be a schematic simpli- fication to make plain, by means of the draw- ing, where it was to be inserted: it musthave been supported by a pivot at the heightof the first piano of the " ospitii ". It cor- responds in this sense also with the other de- sign in the ground-plan, at the left side ofthe stage (a triangle set in a square).2. 1 believe it is impossible. At thevery most the indication of the " aula regia "may lead us to presume that it served for atragedy.3. It is probable that only three sceneswere painted, as it is indicated that the" macchina " served for each " ascione " orscene.4. The notes which accompany the de- sign lead rather to the supposition that thesewere jottings made by Sangallo subsequentto some performance at which he had beenpresent.IB. The " ospitii " seem here like smallstages ( palcoscenici) upon which took placeazioni complimentary to the principal azione ;perhaps allegorical azioni. Elsev/here, onthe contrary, (for example in the illustrationsof an edition of Terenzio which 1 have inmy library, but have not the possibility ofconsulting here) they appear rather as pal- chetti, platforms, reserved for honoured guests.2B. The " aula regia " in tragic playswas the part of the stage reserved to thepersonages of royal lineage : it is also a remin- der of the Greek theatre, which had theporta regia in the permanent scene—a thingwhich the classic theatre often reproducedamong us ; (see the Teatro Olimpico).The back of the stage was, on the con- trary, reserved for the populace, and therepresentation for which this stage served leftevidently a large part to the masses.JOHN MASEFIELD. (OxfoTd).1. They revolved upon some central pole,like the merry-go-round. I made a little mo- del to prove this. You can get charmingaffects by such means. The scene at theback may have remained the same, or maylave been changed by simply raising anddropping, in the usual way.2. No doubt someone can, and will.3. There is no limit to Italian invention:3r other genius.4. Artist s jottings of something very goodwhich he could do better, or thought he could. 1 B. Tiring chambers, which looked likebuildings, and were used as such when theplay demanded.2 B. The spectators " go to the theatre ",the actors to the stage.3 B. All magnificence should be ample,This was the setting for the plays of the con- temporaries of Michael Angelo, who weremuch concerned with the right use of space,or as they called it, " with the art of de- »#sign.4 B.... ?FRANCOIS M. FLORIAN. (Lucerne).My dear Mr John Semar,—you ask toomuch. You would like me to make a foolof myself or a historian, or a pedant. Dohonour to the imagination of man or at leastto his fancy, and do not ask us to be lear~ned about what no one can know. Our fancyis so nimble you know.1 have no doubt that this good AntonioSan Gallo scribbled down hundreds of suchlittle notions as the one in your design. Raf- faello did the same. Aristotle San Gallo,Antonio s father or uncle or nephew (whatmatter which) did the same. Peruzzi, Sab- battini, Chiaramonte, Bramante, Genga- (seewhat a lot of names I know), Pericolo (molto!)La Cecca (ah), Lancia, Buontalenti, BaldiProfondavalle ....how many thousands of suchlittle sketches aod scribblings must they havelet fly from their wrists into the air. Whereare they all now ? Still flying in the air ? Isuspect! How catch them all, get them allinto their right order again? ...!and once inorder how then fill in those gaps whichthe men when living talked, filling in with aword or two here, a word or two there.To rebuild an old wall exactly as it wasyou have to collect all the old stones. Col- lect them then if you can ....but don't forgetthe mortar or whatever else served to jointhem. And when putting them together tryto get them each in his old place, so as toget the wall to look as it really looked. Thengive 150 years of time and may be you'llrecover the old beauty.But have you ever yet seen this done, orhave you perhaps seen a picture of it ? I fearthat's all you can ever see or hope to see,I fear you can never reconstruct an old wallprecisely as it was and as for an old idea, you need a lot of humbug to join its dis- jointed notions, as the bricks need a lot ofold mortar.Ah what folly your pretty plan exposes.You solemnly set out to ask twenty or thirtywise men to explain what is beyond explana- tion, to reconstruct, plus common sense, thisfunny notion by the good Antonio. And theten or twelve will respond—solemnly: andyou will as solemnly print their " conclu- sions ".But you have done a good thing throughyour folly. You have once again proved howimportant it is that artists of 1925 shall createafresh, shall go ahead, do any wild thing,mad thing, rather than that maddest of things,reconstruct.You have made it clear for the hundredthtime, that to waste time wondering what itwas they did in 1525 or 1825 may be agood waste of second rate time, but is anabominable waste of first rate time. Firstrate time is the day, the hour, the momentof the artist. Waste him and his hours andmoments, and you and your nation are playingthe fool. He is nimble and he is gifted bythe Gods, and you run a grave risk in notasking him to be himself, to invent ever new- er things for everyone. Let him remainyoung since he has a young mind and spirit *,let him go ahead; let him sow seed; lethim amuse himself that way since he enjoys it.Encourage that in him—and reap the harvest.And now as I shall be in Koln next weekI shall go and study for a few days at the Thea- trewissenschaft Institute at their University—for 1 very much doubt the entire truth ofwhat I have written here.— Perhaps a littlesuffering in the Institute will make it clearer.° W. R. LETHABY. (London). OForo I suppose was the Roman Forum,Aula Regia was rather the Basilica or Pu- blic Hall in the Forum than a Royal Palace.1 suppose spectators looked through the Ba- silica into the Forum beyond. It would seemto have been a classical Roman play in which" the Gods " appear.May not the hospitalia be Inns ? A Ro- man theatre was a semicircle with a scene,in adopting the word in the middle agesthe curved part may have been the theatreproper. The opitio (?) on left seems to have an open room ( camera) on upper floor andtwo windows on exterior below; also doorbelow on left of centre. The right hand onehas two external windows in each floor. Thebig flag-like thing 1 suppose is one side oftriangular revolving scenes: similar one shownsmaller on right in position ? That is raisedhigh ? Three scenes on revolving triangularframes are well known. They allowed threeeasy changes and possibly more if loose pain- tings were hung up over the first lot.0 GORDON CRAIG. (Genova)~o1. I haven't the faintest idea—and I shallbe very surprised if anyone else is able tospeak with authority. It is the only drawing1 know of where triangles are usedanother scene.... for obviously they revolvedinside those side ospitiishowing though theupper part of the face of the side scenes.But everyone can see this : — I can suggestnothing new. A god or a saint appears sur- rounded by clouds and seraphs as in the„oldbox of tricks revealed by Furtenbach, PadreBrueil and others.3. If a thing can go round like this trian- gular affair it certainly would tempt many ascenic man to make use of the fact and putnew scenes on it on each revolution. — butItalians of that day wouldn't.4. I think it is a record of something seenon a stage,—the sketchy drawing suggeststhis and the artist's notes make it moreevident1 B. What are " Ospitii " ? I have nonotion ....places for the actors to wait andrecover in ?2B. Teatro was a place to see a showin and a semicircle seems to have been pro- ved best for seeing from—whereas a full cir- cle or an oval was best for hearing in andan Odeo was made so.3 B. This Foro has always puzzled me, andI have come across no explanation which is atall illuminating. Was it a place built out infalse perspectives—built of thin wood andplaster and not to be approached by the per- formers, ....not a " practicabile " ? I imagine so.The spectators in those days, were but onlyprinces and men of taste, but were by no meansprejudiced against a bit vof unnecessary sce- nery. The acting and singing were perfect,— had to be — so if Raffaello, Peruzzi or San Galio wished to build up some imitationForums or Palaces, why not ? No one wouldnote them beyond their worth. No one wouldfail to note them and their worth. A per- formance was then looked on as a delight, tosee and to hear.Not display, either in voice or trappings,but style was the thing. The critics praisedthe first rate in terms of the first rate,—andDemocracy had not at that time made itselfunsafe for the whole world.HORACE WYNDHAM. (1.

Probably a sketch for work which theartist hoped he would persuade an adventu- rous manager to produce.ALFRED MORTIER. (Paris).The drawing or sketch which you attri- bute to Antonio di San Gallo has very muchinterested me. Here are the thoughts that ithas suggested to me.Let us first examine the manuscript text,which accompanies the sketch. On certainpoints my interpretation differs from yours.Instead of facivevano I read facieoano. Butthat is unimportant, the sense remaining thesame. Instead .of " come dicie di tresorte " which you translate exactly by " as Isaid of three kinds ", I propose to read: sifacieva varii adornamenti comedici e di tresorte.Comedici is an ancient word, which hasdisappeared from the Italian language, butwhich is derived in direct line from the La- tin comoedicus and signifies " relative to thecomedy ".The sense which I propose seems to meclearer, more accurate and more plausible.Will you note, in fact, that the version " comedicie" (as I said) relates to nothing, since San Gallo has not spoken at all before ofthree sorts of ornaments (1)." Secondo la materia " signifies quiteobviously " according to the material of thecomedy "; that is to say, according to thedecorative requirements necessitated by thesubject of the piece, according to the scene,the place, where the action passes ; and cansignify, in addition, according to the natureof the subject-matter, for you are not una- ware that there were already, at the time ofBaldassare Peruzzi, three types of decors, di- stinguished, one from another, as the comic,the tragic, and the satiric or pastoral.Finally, you translate " aula regia " by" Royal palace which seems to me notvery exact, and which could lead the stu- dent into error. The aula is, originally, aninterior court yard usually surrounded by co- lumned porticoes. If you look attentively, onSan Gallo's sketch, at the part which I havedesignated on my plan by the letters M andN, (2) you will see that, in M especially,San Gallo has slighty indicated some co- lumns standing out from the facade of thebuilding and consequently forming a portico.And, at the foot of these columns, he haswritten in " aula regia ", thus clearly in- dicating that this part of the scene, borderedby colonnades on the two sides of the stage,constituted the aula, or royal court flankedby palaces.Further on, beyond the aula, is seen theperspective of the scene which San Gallo callsthe Foro. Here an alternative presents itself:must we understand by Foro any public placewhatsoever, or more especially the RomanForum ?The question is of importance. Were ita matter of the Roman Forum, that wouldlocalize the researches and permit us to de- duce that this scene was destined for a playthe action of which was laid at Rome. From1510 to 1530 these pieces are not numerous;I for my part know only the " Amicizia "of Jacopo Nardi, and the " Tullia ", a tra- gedy by Lodovico Martelli, whose actiontakes place at Rome. Later, in 1546, thereis the Orazia by the Aretine and, before that, in 1542, the Talanta by the same author;but the scene of the Talanta was constructedand painted by Vasari, who speaks of it inone of his Letters.For these reasons I hold that, by Foro,San Gallo meant to signify some place (pub- lic square) whatsoever of a city, showingthe vista of its streets and houses, as usuallydone in his times.In conclusion, it would be also well todefine with exactitude the expression "edera cosa (or perhaps casa, which would bemore precise) posticcia ", which you havetranslated by the somewhat vague term of" constructed thing ", but of which the truesense would be " factitious thing that isto say a " chose factice ", which signifiesa house actually constructed. We must notin fact forget that, in the earliest days ofstage scenery,... until 1535 at least,... the pa- laces and houses on the stage were solidlyconstructed in wood ; it is only later that Ser- lio advises replacing the solid wood with can- vas painted and fixed upon frames as is stilldone today.San Gallo takes care, then, to specifythat the two lateral " ospitij " are not to beconstructed, but that they are " cosa postic- cia '*; that is to say, capable of being remo- ved or replaced easily and at will. (2) Thatis why I consider that you have been rightto add " moveable", and 1 reply to yourpoint of interrogation: *' Yes, Sir, certainlymoveable ".Why " moveable " ? For a very simplereason; which is that, after the death of Gi- rolamo Genga, his pupil Baldassare Lanciaor Lanci of Urbino (1510-1571), and alsoAristotile di San Gallo who was — let us notethis important detail—the uncle of our An- tonio di San Gallo, began to establish gira- ting scenery decors.The " Ospitij " of which San Gallospeaks are thus made of painted canvas fixedup on frameworks, and consequently light andeasily " moveable ", so as to obtain some" changements a vue ".In his treaty on " Perspettiva pratica "(Roma, Mascardi 1644) on page 91, Jacopo Barozzi da Vignola speaks at length, andgives a design, of the system of the -ments a vue. And, like our San Gallo, hedescribes the triangular apparatus used tothis end, turning on a central pivot. He recalls (2) his memories: at Castro, atthe Duke Pierluigi Farnese's, the scene changedtwice, and was constructed by Aristotile diSan Gallo. At Florence, likewise, in 1569,at the " Palazzo ducale " the scene changedseveral times, and the decors were made byBaldassare Lanci d' Urbino, of whom I havespoken above.Let us note in regard to this an interestingdetail. Towards 1542 Aristotile di San Gallo,without employment, goes to Roma to hisnephew Antonio di San Gallo, to seek work;for Antonio held a good position there indecoration and architecture. It is in the fol- lowing year (3) that Aristotile repairs to Castroto execute the rotating scenery of which Ihave spoken above. It is possible that thenephew may have shown the uncle his draw- ings and his ideas about the girating scene.5|C *Let us now examine attentively the sketchof Antonio di San Gallo.The drawing A presents no difficulty.It is a prismatic chassis (framework), a prismturning on a pivot. According to Barozzi daVignola, each face of the prism was paintedwith a different subject or view. Here itseems that each face of the prism may havebeen surrounded by a frame, and that it hadsome slight depth, so as to afford place forone or more actors ; in short, a veritable littlescene, and not merely a flat painted surface.In fact, in his commentary, San Gallo says :" Perche in ogni facia a varij li efetti doe inuna Vaparitione delli dei etc....If an apparition, god, goddess or phantom,can find place there, that means that the littlescene has depth; but necessarily a very re- stricted depth, on account of the other facesof the prism. That matters little however, for an apparition generally remains motionlessand does not need much space as do theactors who come and go. Thus the prismaticscene suffices perfectly for its function. We now come to the enigmatic questionof the manoeuvring of the apparatus.This is my interpretation, founded notupon hypotheses but solely on the most care- ful examination of the San Gallo design ofwhich you have failed to perceive an impor- tant detail, which to my mind illumines thewhole working. (I)At the outset and normally the " ospitijare free, because they serve as coulisses forthe actors who come on or go off the stage.We have seen this system practised in ourdays by Max Reinhardt(2&gt;, who, having sup- pressed the ancient portants forming a coulisse,replaced them by some constructions, notsuspecting, probably, that his intended noveltywas some centuries old.But here it is that, owing to the exigenciesof the drama or action (per ascione), themachinist wishes to utilize the macchina (fi- gure H) (3) or prismatic apparatus.For the moment this " macchina " is si- tuated in what we call the " cintres " of thetheatre, or, to be clearer, in the upper struc- ture, that high part invisible to the spectators.This upper part of the theatre was perfectlyadapted for the preparation up there of allthat was required. Barozzi da Vignola(4)(op. cit. p. 91) relates that he has seen thesky open and that " there appeared in theair a great number of men in the form ofgods, who sang and played a delicious music,and at the same time a cloud descendedunder their feet, which covered in the wholescene ".Consequently the " macchina " H was, ifnecessary, equipped with its scenery up there.The &lt;f macchina " H could rise and des- cend at will, supported by its central pivot, exactly like one of our modern lifts. Whenit was high up, the actors of the piece hadthe free use of their " ospitio which tra- versed only the stock of the lift. When Hhad to descend, the actors withdrew from theospitio so as not to be crushed.At the desired moment, and plannedfor example, for the apparition of the gods, Hdescended. When once H was at the bottom,the ospitio G mounted to the flies, like thecover of a box which one lifts up.In your questions you ask: Was the trian- gular scene behind the ospitii or rooms ?I reply : no, and I prove it. Will youlook on my plan (figure BCDE), at the littletriangle E (2). You will there perceive a detailwhich has escaped you, and which San Gallohas indicated on his sketch. The triangle isset in a square.The square is the " ospitio ", a structurewhich, indeed, possesses its four sides, ashere: unless it be that, on the back side, in- visible to the spectator, there is an emptyspace permitting the angle of the triangularprism to exceed the line, as the drawing ofSan Gallo clearly indicates.You then ask : was there hung a squareof cloth in front, etc....And I conclude : no, not a piece of stuffbut a veritable cage, which covered and hidthe triangle until the moment when the cagewas hauled up into the air and allowed thetriangle be seen.Thus the ospitio was not transparent.* * Here then is my reply to your questionNo. I.To question No. 2, (" Can anyone sayfor what play ?) I am incompetent to replyand have not the time to make the necessaryresearches. All that I can say is that thepiece is a tragedy since the scene takes placein an aula regia.No. 3. Nothing would prevent the adjust- ment, during the course of the piece, of otherdecors to the triangle, since two sides of itwere always invisible to the spectators.No. 4. San Gallo's drawing seems to meto refer to a past work which he has seen,for he says : " si facievano, fingevasi.... donde uscivano etc.... Had it been a questionof a present work or one to be prepared, hewould have written: "si fanno, fingonsi.... ;or else.... " si faranno, etc.... ".* * ❖Further Remarks.I am surprised that San Gallo's designis dated from 1515 to 1530. (1) Lacking anyformal and documentary certitude 1 hold itto be later, the date being given us whenAristotile di San Gallo made use of the trian- gular scene and the changement a atCastro.The great square opening to which youdraw attention in the ospizio F on the leftdoes not seem to me seriously to weaken mytheory. I doubt whether this was an ope- ning, for such opening would have allowedthe ascent and descent of the triangular liftto be seen, and would have consequentlybeen opposed to the purpose of the ospitii,which were destined, on the contrary, tohide the lifts.This square seems to me to be a kindof balcony, but closed at the bottom in sucha way as not to let the interior be seen.Finally I draw your attention on my dia- gram to the lines L and L, which do notfigure on your " Key to the design butwhich exist on the original design, and whichare the lines of perspective of the triangle (2).«£• of*cr^mDear Sir.1 add some observations to my letter ofyesterday.1° In observing, on the design by SanGallo, the prismatic apparatus raised to the up- per part of the theatre (figure H in my plan) (3)one notes that it is furnished with a frame.It is, then, actually a little scene—and thusthis apparatus differs from the flat paintedsurface mentioned by Barozzi da Vignola. Moreover one perceives two indicationswhich represent, according to me, two per- sonages. Iis the head and Yis the body.Y head.This personage, a god or an apparition,is indicated in a yet clearer fashion in theenlarged apparatus (2) (figures A on my plan),showing the right arm raised, the left armbent. It seems to appear in the middle of alandscape of rocks. (3)2° I add likewise that if aula signifies" cour interieure (interior court) or peristyle,it may equally mean " Salle d'un palais "" Saloon, hall, of a palace", and in the pre- sent case it is this latter sense which oughtto prevail, for San Gallo expressly states" fingievasi una sala ".One may then ask oneself what the backof the decor or Foro represented; for if theaula regia represents a closed salle, the backcan no longer represent the perspective of acity, habitually painted in the XVI century.There is here a little difficulty to resolve.3° El parato ? I think that by this wordmust be understood the decorated part of thetheatre (la partie decoree du theatre), theconstructed part (partie construite) as opposedto the merely painted perspective.A. M. NASALLI-ROCCA. (Ptacenz4In any case I can tell you at once that theverbs used in the past tense make me thinkthat Sangallo was treating of a representa- tion seen by him. It would be well to makehistorical researches.1. It seems from the design that the la- teral triangular scenes were used to changethe picture with the greatest celerity at eachchange of action or ascione, such as the an- cient " pieces ", comprising a succession ofsomewhat complex events, often called for.2. It is not possible to say for whatplay without making precise and accurate re- searches regarding the activities of AntonioSan Gallo.3. The interesting machine, which musthave worked a perno (pivot-wise) on theospitii, was evidently invented for a specialplay in which there was to be a rapid ap- parition of Olympian Gods. This renderednecessary the rapid transformation of thescene. There could be three fixed scenes as,on the other hand, there could be others setor hung over these when the play so required.4. It is more probable that the artist mayhave planned a machine and a scene adaptedto a particular play rather than have recordeda work already accomplished, because in thislatter case there would perhaps be more am- ple and definite theatrical details.1 B. It is certain that the ospitii were therooms set apart for the actors; and they ap- pear evidently to be such, both from theirposition at the sides of the scene, and fromthe inscription which accompanies the sketchattributed to Sangallo il giovane. I believethat the name of ospitii derives from the analo- gous denomination in use in the Greco-Romantheatre which, precisely at the sides of thestage, had the galleries destined to receiveand shelter the actors and Theatrical pro- perties.2B. The Teatro in the past was gene- rally the stable part of the building destinedfor spectacles, and precisely that defined bythe place for the spectators and the cavea.Thus, in the design, the part denominatedteatro, with the accessory space destined forthe orchestra, and the other given over to theconstruction of the scena (stage). The scenawas in fact an addition ; moveable, and addedlater; and evidently did not form part of theteatro as built, but was only like a joined-onstructure.3 B. The foro is the usual place destinedfor public gatherings and does not appear tohave any special significance" in our pre- sent case. If it is held, as appears, that thedrawing relates to a particular work, it isevident that in the representation of the scenicsetting there must have been a foro, but whe- ther Greek, Roman, Fantastic-mythological,does not matter. In the matter of the di- mensions the sketch has no pretensions totechnical exactness ; and, on the other hand,it being necessary to give a proportion, theforo had to be more ample than the AulaRegia.4B. Aula Regia is right in so far as itshould relate to a definite scene for a parti- cular work which required the representationof a regal hall with a view through an openbackground on to the Foro. ALLARDYCE NICOLL. (London)- In connection with the exceedingly inte- resting early XVI century drawing which hasbeen kindly sent to me I should like to makea few remarks both on the MS text and onthe plan itself.1. Although I am not a palaeographer Iam inclined to question some of the readingof the MS. Lines 5 and 10 of the first pas- sage are clearly doubtful; I should suggestthat the word 44 parato " in the former shouldbe read 44 parete " and that 44 e dera cosapostitia" should be read 44 aveva cosa (or' cosi ') posti tre ". The "u" of the wordI take to be " aveva "is not unlike the 44 u "in the first word of the passage, while the"tre" is very similar to the "tre" in thelast line of all. The translation would thenbe as follows :" Aula regia and the hospitalia were" made on the proscenium which we call the4 wall * and a sala was simulated and at" each side an ospitio or room whence the" actors came forth. This had 3 stations so" that according to the subject matter variousdecorations were given, as I said, of three&lt;&lt; 1 •J »»kinds .It seems to me that this gives a bettersense to the whole passage.2. While the drawing, judging from thepast tense of the verbs, is not a design for aperformance not given, 1 question whether itreally represents an Italian theatre. If thisdrawing be compared with the fanciful Ro- man theatre given in the Jocundus edition ofVitruvius (1513) a startling similarity will beapparent. The " teatro " is simply a trans- lation of the Greek @£axpov (from ©saa&amp;at4 to see ') in its original sense of 4 the audi- torium '. In Vitruvius we get the hospitaliaat each side and in the middle the valvaeregiae, corresponding to the aula regia here.Finally, at the rear of the stage is a squareodeum which would be the equivalent of theforo in the drawing. As regards the triangulatemachina, Daniello Barbaro has a note in hisedition of Vitruvius which may serve as acommentary :44 Vtrunque aliae portae erant concharum" modo, quas Nichios dicimus, ita pro fronte44 scenae tres erant apertiones, ante quas in44 singulis machinae erant collocatae triangu- 44 lares axibus versatiles, in singulis earum " frontibus picturae erant secundum fabularum," quas agebant, opportunitatem.

These sentiments were highly appre- ciated by the English spectators, and theyimmediately broke into a round of ap- plause ".When in past ages a King or an Em- peror visited the Theatre and some line inthe play could be taken as an allusion to theadmired monarch, an audience would some- times rise up and applaud; —it is never onrecord that the King rose up and applaudedhimself.But what would you have? — To-dayevery true democrat is his own King; — howcharming then, since there is no one to ap- plaud him, that he should applaud himself.

ENGLISH ACTORS AND ITALIAN. SOME time back, while carrying out for mypaper (I) an enquiry into the conditionsof the dramatic theatre in the principal nationsof Europe, I had the opportunity, during abrief stay which I made in London, to com- pare the English actor, with whom I waswholly unacquainted, with the Italian actor, all of whose good qualities and all of whosedefects I know thoroughly well. I have notbeen able to pursue my studies in this mattervery deeply. Hence I am the first to recog- nize that, in speaking of the English actor,I shall not be able to pass any judgments,but merely to give my " impressions ", leavingto the reader, more expert than I, the taskof correcting my probable errors.The English actor has above all a " stylewhich the Italian actor lacks. He seems toignore the genial improvisations which are thenatural product of a nature extraordinarilysubject to the gusts alike of the true and ofthe false passions. The lack of " dramatictemperament " which, according to us peopleof the south, is inherent in the English race,makes itself felt also in the theatre. It is thus Iexplain how it is that the English actor, whoseemed to me excellent in acting comedy,farce, pantomime and classic tragedy, appearedto me somewhat cold, colourless, and meagrein expression in the interpretation of themodern drama. But this defect is also con- tributed to by the " School ", which I believeis a " high school " for all, and which perhapsderives from the special social education.pertaining to certain classes of the Englishnation. The dress, the bearing, the gesture,the tone of voice, of the leading actor andof the leading actress are not noticeablydistinguishable from those of the lowest superwho comes to the front of the stage to speakthe single line of ten words which constituteshis whole part.A correct, measured, easy naturalness, themechanical foundation of which only themediocre actors disclose, while the betterones know how marvellously to conceal everytrace of study and of effort, constitutes exactly,in my opinion, the " style "of the Englishactor. It is not the disordered, unequal andfrequently even discordant spontaneity of theItalian actor, and it is not the elegant but man- nered stylization of the French actor. It is aquid medium between these two extremes.Certainly, on the English stages, bad actorsare also to be met with; but some small degreeof style exists equally in all, be they good orbad :—a sign that all obey one and the samerule.I have also noted, (and whoever knowsthe habits of the Italian actor will not besurprised by this observation of mine) that all keep themselves strictly within the limits ofthe part assigned to them. The perfect sub- division of work, which characterizes theEnglish people in other fields and whichconstitutes its great strength, is evidentlyobserved also upon the stage.Give an Italian actor of some merit a part,be it but of modest dimensions, in which hehas the opportunity of displaying his ownpowers, and, at the opportune moment, (whichis almost always inopportune) you will seehim seek by every means to attract tohimself the attention of the public, usurping,for a moment or so, the place of the leadingactor and creating for his own personage,however insignificant it be, the illusion ofbeing for that moment the protagonist of thedrama.It does not, on the contrary, seem to meto be one of the habits of the English actorto overcharge or distort his part for love oftheatrical effect. I did not chance, for example,at the entrance alone upon the stage of aleading actress, to see that which is normalin Italy,—an emptiness, a truly " splendid iso- lation left around her instantly as thoughshe were suddenly mounted upon a pedestaland the others were but poor pigmies at herfeet.In yet stronger contrast with this correctdiscipline, and with the measured naturalnessto which I have referred already, are theexcesses, exorbitant even for us who knowthe volcanic dramaticity of Grasso and theclamorous comicality of Musco and of Petro- lini, to which the English actors attain in thedrama of adventure of the type of that " GoodLuck " which was represented during the pastyear at Drury Lane, and in classic farce, asin " The Merry Wives of Windsor " whichat that time was being performed by a Shake- spearean company at the Golders GreenHyppodrome. It was in fact a revelation tome to see with how much unrestrained briothere unfolded before my eyes, accustomed tothe timid—(timid through a too great respect) —Italian interpretations of the same comedy, thegay adventures which set forth the Garter Inn,the streets, and Windsor Park (l). A workwhich I had until the previous day considered archaic appeared to me all at once as extraor- dinarily alive, thanks to the overpowering andbroad comicality of its interpreters. In likemanner as the English actors adopt this spe- cial method in the classic farce of Shake- speare does the Italian actor change in style,in manners, in customs, when he acts Goldoni.In conclusion, I consider that our Italiantheatre lacks a good scuola di plotone, whilethe English theatre would perhaps be benefittedby a course of individual exercises.The Italian actor can boast a greaterwealth of natural gifts, a greater ductility andelasticity of talent, a more sensitive and im- passioned nature. The English actor canboast in his turn the superiority which derivesfrom a disciplined study, from a more cons- cientious respect for his art; and, above all,from the habit of reciting without a prompterwhich gives him an extraordinary mastery ofhimself and of his own resources.

IT may slrike Italian students of the Theatre as strangethat my appreciation of the work done by the ItalianPrompter has increased not lessened.I remember once listening to an early rehearsal of anItalian Company. I heard the Prompter giving each word." Then it comes automatically and easily into the ear ofthe actor " I thought; " what a blessing! He has notto think ; — all he needs to do is to feel. What a releasefrom an incubus I thought. Hamlet is there on thestage. The ghost appears. He does not know what hewill say — and slowly his ear hears the words afar offand yet tiny and close in his ear. Angels and ministersof grace.... defend us.... why, it is one of the greatblessings of the Italian stage; it was an inspiration on thepart of who ever first thought to invent this Prompter.Doubtless it was the Dramatic Poet who was the firstPrompter — and I see no reason why he should notcontinue to perform this part of his task.And this — this wonderful aid to spontaneity — is thefigure il Gran Signor Pirandello and others will haveremoved, so as to save the stage !" Angels and ministers of grace defend us UNIVERSITIES AND THE DRAMAA REPLY BY PROFESSOR ALLARDYCE NICOLL. IT is far from my wish to quarrel with theaims and intentions of The Mask, a pe- riodical which I, as everyone who is trulyinterested in the drama, most heartily admireand honour.At the same time, there are three paragraphsin the recent (July) number which seem tome to demand some comment, the more espe- cially as two of them are directly inspiredby my own article in the last issue.I refer to Mr. C. G. Smith's letter onp. 143, to the Editorial Note,— Drama notTheatre—on p. 144, and the other note—British Opera—on p. 150.In many ways, everyone will agree withcertain points raised by Mr. Smith. Undoubt- edly " theatricals " can be carried too far ina university, and, moreover, " theatricals"are not fundamentally theatrical at all. It isunquestionably bad for students who have aliving to make to be led to imagine that theyare budding Hamlets, and the inglorious (and,be it whispered, on occasions mute) Hamletsof College productions can hardly be said tohelp on the work of the drama. So farMr. Smith, the writer of the Editorial Noteand I agree. There come now the furtherassumptions that only "young gentlemen" goto the University and that there is no use instudying the " laws " of drama. In the firstplace, conditions have vastly changed from thetime when Collegio this or Collegio that builttheatres for its students in XVIII centuryItaly. I can say from experience that themajority of my students have had to deprivethemselves of many things before they couldattend the College classes and all of themhave had to think with due seriousness ofbread and butter questions when they tooktheir degrees. Secondly, there seems to besome sort of confusion concerning the vitalquestion of study of the drama and of thetheatre. Why does The Mask print va- luable plans of Rome and of Paris? Whydoes it present to its readers engravings anddrawings of by gone theatres? Why doesit delve into the musty records of the past?Because Mr. Gordon Craig, one of our mostdistinguished creative artists, knows that inspi- ration for future endeavour may come from theserecords. Surely this is a task which a Universitymay well perform? By studying intensively thedocuments of departed centuries, by collectingtogether all available materials, by providinga centre of information on these subjects aUniversity may well make itself an integralpart of the great body theatric.Perhaps my views may be clearer if I setdown a concrete instance. At East LondonCollege in the University of London I amstarting in October (and I trust Mr. Smithwill aid me) a School of Dramatic Studyand Research. This School will not appealprimarily to ordinary undergraduate students;it will not exist for the purpose of '' trainingyoung gentlemen in the crafts of the stage ";it will not indulge in amateur theatricals.Our appeal will be to the acting pro- fession and to the student of the theatre.We shall engage in research work such as isso ably presented in the pages of " TheMask ".We shall endeavour to make the results ofthat research available by talking of the va- rious periods of dramatic literature (treatingthe drama as drama and not as poetry), ofthe theatrical art of past times, of the con- ceptions of drama in past ages, of the latestmovements in the international world of theTheatre.The Theatre cannot "be a little worldby itself for the Theatre belongs to huma- nity, and perhaps the Universities may havesomething to give to it which the artistry ofthe theatre will transmute into gold.In announcing this new School of Dramain The Mask, I wish therefore to note that Ido not wish to train the " young gentlemen "students to be actors, or scene-painters, orcostume-designers, or producers. My aim —and this I think should be the aim of allUniversity departments of this kind — is toprovide a cultural centre which may in itsown way (however slightly) improve the con- ditions of the theatrical world. It is only thelesser and the unsuccessful artists who cry outabout the sanctity of art and the contamina- tion of scholarship. Your Leonardo da Vinci and your Dante and your Milton never madethat mistake.While amateur theatricals will not be in- dulged in at this new centre, revival of un- known works of the past and performance ofnew works will form part of the activities ofthe School. If professional actors and actres- ses, aided by professional artists and produ- cers, co-operate, there seems to be no reasonwhy a University should not provide thecentre for an "experimental" theatre. Theordinary theatrical work in London is hope- lessly commercialised. Commercialism of agood sort is, of course, not to be despisedin the stage world; Shakespeare gave usHamlet and Moliere gave us Les FemmesSaoanles under those conditions. But thecommercialism in the theatre of today is notof the right sort; it is parasitic and art-quel- ling.Surely then, there is reason to welcomeany endeavour which strives, not to curb theartist, but to give him the opportunity of de- veloping and improving his art ?With these general remarks on the Uni- versities and the drama, I should like to makeone comment on the British Opera.No one could be more eager to seePurcell on the stage than I, yet one mustever remember that art, especially the art ofthe theatre, is international.The British National Opera Company isan endeavour to create for London a centreof interpretative artistry such as Berlin andVienna and Paris already possess.To limit the B.N.O.C. to the performanceof all British seems to me undulyinsular.Surely a National Theatre, if that evercomes into existence, would not refuse toplay Ibsen or Moliere or Goldoni any morethan a Continental theatre, nationally supported,would refuse to play Shakespeare or Sheridan ?I must apologize for occupying so muchspace in the pages of The Mask. I havehad to write at length because I think therehave been misconceptions all round, because Ibelieve that the theatre can thrive only whenit is regarded by all in an international spirit,and because I look confidently to the suppor- ters of The Mask and to lovers of the theatresuch as Mr. Smith for encouragement and aidin my effort to establish a centre for real dra- matic and theatrical study in London. MR. C. G. SMITH'S REPLY THE Editor of " The Mask ", havingcourteously shown me an advance proofof Professor N icoll*s letter relating to my ownin the last number, enables me to reply with- out delay to some of his points and to make,if necessary, yet clearer what I then wroteregarding " University and DramaProfessor Nicoll announces the imminentestablishment of a school for the study ofthe art of the theatre at the East LondonCollege.This, in some ways, is an excellent plan.It will not, it is true, be able to train actorsor make artists, but it can ultimately developecriticism and produce critics; and that issomething.But why does Professor Nicoll take ex- ception to what he calls my " assumption "that " only ' Young gentlemen * go to the Un- versity " ! why does he seem to slight the oldEnglish notion that young gentlemen have stillsome sort of claim though gentlemen ? Hesays that " conditions have vastly changed ".But surely conditions have never changed,never can change, to such an extent that aCollege education will aim, even if at times itfail, to make its students anything other orless than gentlemen ?Our Colleges are, we shall always suppose,to lend men, be they by nature boors, ani- mals, what you will, a certain manner; nay,more manners.That is what one feels regarding such aninstitution as the old Collegio dei Nobili inParma: it did lend its students manners, ad- dress, a certain polish. And that is definitegain. It matters nothing whether the studentbe poor, of humble parentage, rich or of thebluest blood. Every man surely wishes tohave fine manners, nor will he object if theworld note it. And the old College Theatreswere of value in so far as they contributed to- wards this end.Professor Nicoll seems to lay great storeby the fine fact that a student has paid forhis own Education; that he has sacrificedmany things to do so, and has had to con- sider bread and butter questions while doingso.That's A1 highly creditable; but itNdoesn't in itself constitute any superiority overthose less unfortunately equipped. And those who believe it does, might consider the wordsof that ballad by Gilbert the wise .... a Lon- doner and which begins :Spurn not the nobly bornwith love affectedNor treat with virtuous scornthe well connected.High rank involves no shame....We boast an equal claimWith him of humble nameto be respected.Blue blood.... blue blood.... etc.Professor Nicoll must not imagine that anyof us undervalue the born democrat and theintellectual Bolschevic, but some of us cannever be brought nor bring ourselves to under- value the born gentleman. That is all.The second point in my letter in whichProfessor Nicoll finds "some sort of confusion"is that wherein I maintained that the study ofthe Theatre and the Drama were not quiteof an equal value to a University man:that, while a little drama was most valuable,theatricals were not particularly so ; were, infact, something of a waste of time andmoney. And I added that it was perhapsthe Theatres more than the Colleges whichneeded the millions to endow them with thepower to study Theatricals: in fact that ifthey were financially endowed with such po- wer it would be rendered unnecessary for Col- 1 a »leges to step in: .... dare I even say, butt in.Professor Nicoll mentions Mr GordonCraig, and by so doing strengthens my argu- ment.Mr Craig, says Professor Nicoll, has per- suaded the Editor of " The Mask " to pub- blish " valuable plans of Rome and Paris andpresent its readers with engravings and draw- ings of bygone Theatres and he is to bepraised ".But praise is cheap, and soft words butterno parsnips". Is Mr. Craig merely to be4 praised ' for his services,... a little sweetwind blown upon him.... while Colleges areto receive solid support to play at Theatri- cals, usurp a position not their own ? BecauseMr Craig is an artist, not a collegiate body,(not even a Professor like Herr Max Rein- hardt) is he to step aside — be side-step- ped — ; passed over and denied support whilethat support is given to Universities and Col- leges for the very work he initiated and wasborn to do ? He it is who wishes to reestablish his" School for the Art of the Theatre andis entitled to do so since the whole idea forsuch Schools originated with him. It seemshowever that Professor Nicoll would prefer todo it for him and is laying his plans to do so.Now Professor Nicoll is a most able Pro- fessor, and he cannot be blamed because heis not an artist. To blame him would be asirrational as to blame a man for being bornwith a silver spoon in his mouth.But for all this it is, I think, the artistand not the professor who can be relied onbest, to give to the theatre all it needs. And,so long as college professors put themselvesforward to usurp the offices which ought byevery right to be filled by artists and theatremen, they continue to do the theatre, regar- ding which they profess to be solicitous, se- rious harm.Professor Nicoll writes in rather too pa- thetic a tone. He says he thinks there issurely room for 44 any endeavour which strivesto give the artist opportunity of developingand improving his art ". Which is a fine- sounding phrase, but a hollow one whenexamined.The best way to 44 give the artist oppor- tunity " is to stand out of his light, to setfoot in no position which should be his byright of birth, endowment and capacity; tobring the powers of a trained academic intel- ligence to bear so as to induce those in power,those with financial control, to afford artistfunds to work with and opportunity to work.First put bur friend Gordon Craig into aposition to develope the art he knows so well,so that artists can thrive through him: thenthere will be plenty of room in the outercircle for a hundred professors and their ac- tivities.But for the Professors to push forwardtoday into the theatre and say 44 we can dothis , while there is a man who has beendoing it for twenty years yet who is still waitingfor the power and means to give to othersthe result of his efforts, is a little too much.I wonder how the readers of 44 The Mask "feel about it ? Mr Craig has had countless imitators.Now one more has to be added to the list,as Professor Nicoll, who long ago had hisown task assigned him, pushes forward to runthe Gordon Craig School for the Art of the Theatre, calling it " The London UniversitySchool of Dramatic Study and Research ".It is just what Professor Baker did atHarvard.For years Craig had projected and calledfor such a School. Baker, across the Atlantic,looking up from correcting the theses of theyoung gentlemen of Harvard, heard and echoedhim, and, being quite smart, got it.But Baker's School was what Nicoll'sSchool will be, .... a Professor's School.Craig called for a school for serious crafts- men who should then be drafted into a spe- cial, an experimental, Theatre; who shouldstudy practically under artists, not under pro- fessors. And, while he still awaits his op- portunity, professors parody the whole scheme,squandering endowment money and their own,and, I fear, their students', timeIf I am a little warm in my expressionsin this note it is that I for one dislike to seea valuable artist like Craig wasted, whileevery amateur seems able to push forward,elbowing his way into a position which Craigrefuses to use elbows to gain. MEASUREDRECITATIONA STUDY ON THEPOETICAL RHYTHMS OF SPEECH BY LORENZO GUIDO BREZZO 11 'tis we musicians know n(R. Browning: Abt Vogltr), PURE RHYTHM 1. - Rhythm is the order of elements insuccession.2. - A rhythm measure (shortly a )is a duration unity that can be repeated inde- finitely in succession.3. - Measured isochronism finds its originin the tendency of the mind to perceive phe- nomena under the aspect of unity. That per- ception is easy in proportion to the degree oflikeness possessed by the component elements;for, the greater the likeness, the weaker willbe the power of attracting attention, exercisedby each.4. - In order to become perceptible to theear, a measure must be filled with sound. Asregards speech, the sound is the spoken language.5. - In order to make each measure per- ceived separately, the sound must undergo amodification at the beginning of every measure.The modification, in the present case, is oneof intensity.6. - If we consider the spoken language asa prolonged sound, every fraction of that soundbetween two successive moments of diminishedintensity constitutes a syllable (1\7. - " The strength of each separate force- impulse, such as we give to the separate syl- lables, tends to diminish progressively. Thebeginning of each of these force-impulses marksthe beginning of the syllable " We shallcall this beginning " accent ", and use it tomark the beginning of the measure.8. - When every measure is marked byan accent, we have the measured diction,which gives rise to poetical rhythm. Ordinary (i.e. unmeasured) diction produces prose rhythm. 9. Accent isochronism is therefore the firstfundamental law of poetical rhythm (1).10. - The syllables of any indefinite setnever possess accents of equal intensity. Ifwe call the weakest accents 1, accents 2 willdivide the set into groups of several measures.Each group constitutes a foot. The foot-accenttends towards isochronism (9), that is, the setis apt to fall into equal feet.11. - We shall indicate the measure andthe foot by means of the symbols — , VJ . Itmust be remembered that either of them standsfor a measure, not for a syllable. The formerstands for a measure marked by accent 2,. thelatter for a measure marked by accent 1. Toavoid confusion, they shall be called strong andWeak, not longa and brevis.12. - In any definite set of syllables, some foot- accents are stronger. We shall call them 3They will divide the sets into groups, and eachgroup constitutes a metre. The metre-accenttends toward isochronism (9).13. - The secondfundamental law orhythm is seen at work constantly for the firsttime, in connection with the metre. The ac- cent proper to a rhythm-member finds its placeat the end of the member. The reason isthis. An accent is a point on which attentionis focused : what enables a stronger accent toattract attention is the difference between itsown intensity, and that of the weaker accents.Now, this difference cannot be felt unless theweaker accents be heard first.14. - As it is easier to imagine few thanmany objects together, the rhythm-member thatis apt to prevail is always the simplest pos- sible (3). This fact constitutes the third fun- damental law of poetical rhythm.15. This is the notation of the metre oftwo two-measure feet, which is the simplestpossible : 16. - In any indefinite set of metres, somemetre-accents are stronger. We shall markthem 4 (,). They will divide the sets intogroups : each group constitutes a verse. Theverse-accent is final (13), and tends to iso- chronism (9). This is the notation of the two- metre verse : 17. - In the same way, groups of verses areformed with final isochronous accents whichwill be marked 5. Each group constitutes apolustich : 18. - Stanzas are formed in the same way,with final isochronous accents to be marked 6.Here is the two-polystich stanza : 19. - Intermediate rhythm members are notas a rule found between the stanza and thepoem. The last accent of the poem is itsaccent proper, which might* be marked 7, ifnecessary.20. - In the typical stanza scheme (18)all the rhythm-members of the same order arealike, and all the members are binary. Rhythmis therefore perceived here under the aspectof unity, as perfectly as possible.21. " Besides the tendency to unity (3), themind possesses a tendency to perceive phe- nomena under the aspect of multiplicity. Sothe perception of a phenomenon is not satis- factory, unless it takes place under bothaspects (2). Unconsciously following this secondtendency, usage has modified the typical stanzascheme, imperfect because too unitary, intoforms much too numerous to be recorded,which are obtained by combining in every possible way rhythm-members composed ofany number of members of inferior order. Inthese derivative schemes, any of the above- mentioned accent-isochronisms may be inter- rupted, or disappear. Yet, if we considerthe schemes that are met with in the literarypractice, we shall find that, besides the indispen- sable measure-isochronism (8), several others aregenerally preserved, among which, stanza-iso- chronism is hardly ever wanting. SPEECH RHYTHM 22. -Up to now, we have consideredsyllables as if they were elements not subject,in their grouping, to any law but that ofrhythm, so that we might use them to embodyany given pure-rhythm scheme, as we mightwith the sounds of a musical instrument. Ifthe language were an arbitrary construction,if it were possible, in order to represent ideasto make up words of such shape and size aswe please, we might make speech-memberstally exactly with the members of any pure- rhythm scheme. Every simple idea could berepresented by means of a one measure word,every coumpound idea by means of as manywords as there are measures in the foot, andso on. But language is an autonomous andirregular construction, which we can make useof only on condition of respecting its laws.In most cases, therefore, the correspondencebetween speech-members and pure-rhythmscheme members will be unattainable.23. - The members of speech are : theword, the phrase, the clause, the period.24. - Division of speech-members—. Thisis obvious as far as words are concerned. Asto clauses and periods, the grammar principleson the analysis of sentences are sufficientA phrase is more difficult to define (2),and therefore more difficult to divide by rule.Yet the difficulty disappears in practice, mostparticular instances being very clear.25. - Accent. — Each member of speechis endowed with a proper accent, which couldbe called the centre of gravity of the wholemember. That accent must not be confusedwith emphasis, which is a further stress added occasionally to a word accent, in order togive prominence to the idea for which thatword stands (I). Since the nature of thataccent is rhythmical, the accent itself shallobey the rules of pure rhythm, as far as lan- guage structure and the meaning of speechwill permit.Namely : Word-accents have a fixed seatof linguistic origin, which cannot, as a rule,be influenced by rhythm-law.Phrase-, clause-, and period-accents fol- low the second fundamental law of poetical- rhythm (13), and place themselves at the endof the member.Not all accents marked with the samenumber have exactly the same degree of in- tensity. Yet, to take into account all possibledegrees is unnecessary and would lead toconfusion. The meaning of numbers in ournotation is that any accent of a given order—3, for instance-is always stronger thanthe strongest accent of the inferior order—2—,and weaker than the weakest accent of thesuperior order—4—.The word on which the accent falls neednot be the most important of the member, ashere we have to do with accent, not withemphasis (25). As long as the accent doesnot lend the word a prominence inconsistentwith the natural meaning of the member, theword itself is immaterial.In the following clause, the last word isa different one at each inversion. Yet theaccent always falls on that.But time drives flocks from field to \\ fold(2)From field to fold drives time the jj flocksThe flocks from field to fold drives (| timeFrom field to fold time flocks does || driveIt is easy to make up similar examples forthe phrase and the period.26. - Separation of speech-members. —Speech-members are separated from eachother by means of caesurae. We have syl- lable-, word-, phrase-, clause-, and period-cae- surae. A caesura is a moment of relaxed attention, caused by a diminution of intensity,which will soon attain to silence, wheneverthe caesura is of some importance. Since therecannot be degrees of silence as there aredegrees of intensity, silence-caesurae are in- tensified by being lengthened. As a rule,the stronger the accent, the more importantwill be the following caesura. MEASURED DICTION 27. - Ordinary speech diction is not mea- sured, since neither the syllables nor the cae- surae have an absolutely fixed duration. Therelative duration values (quantity) proper tospeech-sounds, already variable in themselvesto a notable extent, are moreover incessantlymodified by emphasis Yet this varietyis restrained by limits which cannot be disre- garded in practice, for it is through keepingwithin these limits that each uttered portionof speech can retain a quantitative physiognomysufficient for its instant recognition. Clearnessand power of speech greatly depend uponthat.Speech becomes measured in order toacquire further unity through rhythm (3). Thatend is desirable only inasmuch as it can beattained without loss of clearness or power,or, at least, with greater gain than loss. Mea- sured diction, therefore, must needs be foundedon ordinary good diction. One of its charac- teristic features is, that accent always prevailsover emphasis (25).28. - Measures and syllables. —As thesyllable is practically the shortest element ofthe language, it is apt to coincide with themeasure which is the least member of purerhythm. So a measure will usually be filledup with a syllable of average length. Theresult will be that its relative duration willprove sometimes a little longer, sometimes alittle shorter than in ordinary diction. Ifthis difference exceeds a certain limit, thediction becomes too artificial, and clearnessor power of speech is impaired. In that case,the syllable shall be made to last more thanone measure, or a measure shall be filled upwith several syllables. Naturalness of utte- rance is further preserved :a) By beginning a syllable after the be- ginning of a measure, and filling up the gap either with a lengthened preceding syllable,or with a caesura, according to sense. Thisis often done with weak syllables and occa- sionally with strong syllables in weak feet. The fourth syllable begins towards themiddle of the fourth measure.b) By beginning a syllable before the be- ginning of a measure and shortening the pre- ceding syllable accordingly. The fourth syllable lasts somewhat less andthe fifth somewhat more than a measure.29. - Feet and words. — Feet naturallytend to be binary (14), if that is compatiblewith natural diction. If not, they becometernary, again to revert to binary grouping assoon as possible. Yet, should they be com- pelled to remain ternary for a considerabletime, the tendency to the simplest member (14)would be overcome by the law of isochro- nism (9), and ternary grouping would acquirea certain degree of stability.The tendency to foot-accent isochronismwill sometimes induce a lengthening, or, lessfrequently, a shortening of a syllable, not no- ticeable in ordinary diction, and which isquite permissable, so long as it does not in- terfere with clearness or power of speech. The second syllable is lengthened in mea- sured diction that foot-accent isochronism maybe preserved.30. - Metres and phrases. — Everythingthat has been said about feet and words, ap- plies to metres and phrases, with the only dif- ference that metre-accent isochronism will bemore often interrupted. For, if it is easy toget rid of a redundant measure by shorteninga syllable, or to obtain an extra measure by lengthening a syllable or inserting a shortcaesura, it is hardly ever possible to makeaway with the duration of one or several feet, orto wedge in a long caesura without marringthe sense. Yet, instances of metres, partlyfilled up with words, and completed by meansof added silent measures, are very often to bemet with (34). Here are examples of howdifferent metres get formed under the influ- ence of speech-rhythm; The binary metre is preserved throughout,as the sense allows the syllable " cap " tohave accent 3 on it. As the sense forbids the first syllable of" little " having an accent stronger than 2,the metre becomes ternary. On the otherhand, as "cap " cannot have an accent weakerthan 3, the following metre consists of a singlefoot. A new foot, with accent 2 (tiny) beingadded, the metre becomes quaternary. Owing to the new foot (pretty), withaccent 2, the metre becomes quinary. It isto be noticed that quinary metres are alreadycomparatively rare, and longer metres arebecoming rarer and rarer as ihe number ofcomponent reet increases.31. - Verses and clauses. — The difficultyof preserving accent-isochronism is still greater. 32. - Polystichs and periods. — To pre- serve accent-isochronism is all but impossible.33. - There are no members of speechthat outwardly correspond to stanzas. Theyare made up of several periods linked toge- ther into a compound one by the sense.34. - Duration of caesurae. — When asufficient number of measures marked by syl- lable-accents has been heard, the measure iskept up, for some time, by habit, in the mind,though the voice be silent. The same thinghappens with all rhythm-members. It is clearthat the period of a rhythm-member cannotchange during silence, for want of accent.Therefore a caesura (9) shall normally lastas many measures as are required, in orderthat the first subsequent accent may fall inwith the accent-period in progress.35. - From what has been said, it followsthat measured diction does not necessarilydepend on any special arrangement of words,though that arrangement may have a greatinfluence upon the degree of excellence ofthe poetical rhythm obtainable in each instance.Therefore, under the aspect of rhythm wecannot properly speak of poetical or proseform as visible in writing, since speech, inwhatever form be it written, is always ame- nable to measured as well as to ordinarydiction. POETICAL RHYTHM FORMSTO BE MET WITH IN PRACTICE. 36. - Since the poetical rhythm-form of aliterary piece is determined by the interplayof pure-rhythm laws, and the laws of speech,it is different for each piece, so that no listof pre established schemes can possibly begiven. Yet, in that interplay, we shall di- stinguish three phases, to one of which anygiven form can be ascribed.37. - First phase. — The members of speechare moulded upon the pattern of a pure-rhythmscheme.a) Syllables are moulded upon measures : This happens very frequently, as it israther easy to arrange the speech so as tohave a set of syllable-words that can be made to last one measure each, withont loss of ;natural diction. 1b) Words are moulded upon feet: This is not so easy, as it is often impos- sible to arrange the speech so as to have aset of words identical in number of syllables,natural quantity and accent.c) Phrases are moulded upon metres :Ex: The longer 1 life, the more of || fence ;The more of | fence, the greater |J pain,The greater pain, the less de | fence,The less de fence, the greater | gain&lt;2&gt;.d) Clauses are moulded upon verses:Ex. Open the temple-gates unto my [j love,Open them wide that she may enter || in;And all the posts adorn as doth be || hove,And all the pillars deck with garlands ||trimThis case is extremely common.e) Periods are moulded upon poiystichs :Ex : The ghosts of Ossian skim the misty vale,And hosts of Sylphids on the moon-beamsail &lt; &gt;./) Compound periods are moulded uponstanzas:Ex: What should we talk of dainties, then,Or better meat than's fit for men ?These are but vain; that's only goodWhich God hath blessed and sent forfood (5).This case is normal with hardly any ex- ception.38. - Second phase. — Speech membersare no longer moulded upon the pattern ofa pure rhythm-scheme, yet the latter is stillpartly made perceptible through rhyme. Rhyme is an assimilation of sounds under the aspectof quality. It is chiefly employed as a factorof unitary perception; but this point does notconcern us here, as it has nothing to do withrhythm.Rhyme is also used to mark the end ofa rhythm-member, generally a verse (,). Thenits office is akin to that of accent; in fact,it might be called a quality accent.a) Verses are made perceptible throughrhyme: 39. - Third phase. — Rhyme having dis- appeared, pure I-rhythm members no longerretain a means of their own through whichto make themselves perceptible side by sidewith speech-members.That means that one of the two rhythm- patterns must be sacrificed. Which shall itbe? If we give up speech-rhythm, we betraya tendency towards a uni-lateral notion of poetical art, that is, towards considering it asbeing outside the pale of ideas, and akin toinstrumental music. So it seems that theadvisability of abandoning pure rhythm maybe taken for granted.Yet, shall a poet take pains to cut hissentences into an elaborate system of linesand use a number of otherwise totally unne- cessary capitals, only to give his readers thetrouble of undoing his work ? The argumentis a strong one ; yet it can be reversed. Shalla poet—Milton for instance, — carefully breakhis lines and build up their fragments intospeech-members of ever-changing length, thatthe reader may do his best to merge thatbeautiful variety into a monotonous sequenceof iambic pentameters ? If a poet desires apure-rhythm scheme to be perceptible in hiswork, let him make it tally with his speech- members.40. -In the following examples, the no- tation is calculated to give prominence tospeech-rhythm only. Pure-rhythm schemes,when existing, have been disregarded.Polystichs are separated from each otherby means of a blank line.Caesurae are marked, when necessary, bymeans of blank measures &lt;x).41. - Example I. 43. - If we compare the two last examples,the first of which was written by the poet inthe manner peculiar to the pure-rhythm schemecalled iambic pentameter, the second in theone peculiar to prose, we get further evidenceof what was stated at No. 35: namely, thatdiction, as marked by us, does not, as faras rhythm is concerned, afford any ground fordistinguishing prose form from poetical form.The rhythm features of the two are the same:measure-accent isochronism maintained throu- ghout, foot-accent isochronism seldom inter- rupted, metre-accent isochronism broken oftener,verse-accent isochronism all but wanting, po- lystich-accent isochronism wanting altogether.It is true that in the second example, weoften find a syllable lasting two measures,whereas in the first, that happens only once.Yet such cases, as well as the opposite onesof one measure filled up with several syllables,are extremely frequent in numerous poemsunmistakably written in what is usually called 44. - We shall conclude our study by ob- serving that the same has enabled us to takea bird's-eye view of the whole range of pos- sible poetical rhythm forms, from those throughwhich unity alone is best expressed, and whichcan be realized only with the help of puresound in instrumental music, (18) to somechosen from actual literature, among such asbest embody multiplicity. (41-42).The search for and analysis of particularforms, together with the examination of theiraesthetic worth, cannot be the object of anessay on general principles.Yet, let us state a fundamental rule: Thebetter a rhythmic form unites harmoniouslywell-balanced expression of unity and multi- plicity with clearness and power of speechthe higher its literary merit will be.

Mais Vami- tie est indulgente, et je compte trop sur lavotre pour ne pas etre convaincue quelle nevous permettra pas d'etre injuste envers moien vous laissant prendre pour negligence uneimpossibility reelle.Depuis que je suis en cette ville on nem'a pas encore laisse un seul instant de libre,comblee des bontes de toutes les plus grandesdames, et principalement de M™e la duchessede Devonshire. Je passe chez elle tout temps,ou je ne suis pas employee au thiatre. EnVerite, mon cher petit bon ami, la manieredont on me recoit partout est si flatteuse quellepourroit bien faire tourner une tete moins sen- see que celle de votre petite bonne amie,mais elle est ci'une trop rare bonte pourpas a Vabri de toute epreuve. Vous allez enjuger par les sages reflexions que ses nouveaussucces lui ont fait faire, et dont elle va vousfaire part.J'ai pense que je ne pouvois profitercirconstance plus favorable pour terminerlamment ma carrieretheatrale, et je vous croistrop mon ami pour ne pas approuver la re- solution que je prends de quitter I'Opera.Vous n'ignorez pas, que depuis quelque temps,il est devenu le centre des cabales, par con- sequent du mauvais gout, les perruquiers, leslaquais, sont devenus les juges des talents, lesmiens n'ont jamais du leurs succes qua labonne compagnie, et je ne veux pas risquerde devenir la pdture de celle dont on remplitpresentement le parterre. II me seroit trop dur,apres ving-cinq ans de suffrages bien soutenus, de finir par eprouver des desagrements, etparmi mes chers comarades, fen connois quisont remplis de bonnes sur le chapi- tre. Or, comme dans tous les temps je n'aijamais cherche qua faire plaisir,]etre le comble a mes procedds pour eux endonnant ma demission. Disposes de ma placemon ami, mais si vous voules ecouter les con- seils de I'amitie, ne la donnes qu'au talent etnon a la protection ni au charlatanisme. Jevous le repete, il est tres dangereux de don- ner legerement des premieres places, attenduque I'on n est plus matt de les oter auxsujets que Von a rendus pcssesseurs quand onfinit par voir clairement ne sont en etatde les remplir. II faut encourager les jeunessujets en les recompensant bien. Soyez liberalen argent, mais avare des premieres places,si vous volez ne pas fermer la porte de1'Opera aux vrais talents qui pourroient lesmeriter. Excusez, mon . ami, si je vous donnedes conseils, mais c'est mon pour vousqui me les diete, ainsyque le desir que j'ayde ne pas voir detruire la belledanse que j'ai Vu exister a I'Opera.On m'a mande que vous aviez suspendu1'arret du conseil qui retablissoit les feux, fensuis vraiment fachee; vous savez que je vousai toujours dit qu'il n'y avoit que ce moyende retablir le bon ordre dans le service deI'Opera. On est bien plus empresse a remplirson devoir quand 1' interet est attache, et lacertitude de toucher son argent, tous les mois,sans nulle espece de conventions, rend biendes sujets infiniment paresseux. Je tiens toujoursaux feux, sans eux cela ira toujours mal.J'ai encore une grace a solliciter de votreamitie, mon ami, c'est de permettre avelon de tester a Londres jusqu'a la Jin dumois prochain. Independamment du service quivous me rendrez en me laissant ce danseur,vous lui en rendrez aussi un bien grand, caril a paru un libelle a Paris, et il est accused'y etre pour quelques chose.

YOU remember this letter which is quotedby M. Edmond de Goncourt in the62nd paragraph of his delightful book on thefamous dancer.It is a distinguished neatly written (l)example of the usual theatric communicationsof all time which say "1 am a great successbecause I am sought after for my art by greatpersons " and which add " I have made agreat deal of money ".Sometimes it is less studied as in the caseof the fortunate dancer Mile. Boubon, whenshe writes from London to the Hairdresser Al- bert of the Rue des Petits Champs saying " Sendme two more boxes of the Powder you keepfor the Princess Lamballe, for I am going totake tea on the 1st of next month with thehighest personage in British Navy; one writesit so: Mr Midshipman and he has promisedme the most sumptuous banquet of fish—they call them les shrimps. I must not fail to appear a I'A Ibert and 1 pray youx not toforget, by the 1st of the month ".Mile. Guimard as we see from her let- ter was not left alone for an instant by thegreat ladies—in fact the Duchess of De- vonshire keeps her close to her all the timeshe is not in the Theatre. Fortunate Duchessto be able to afford it—for Mile. Guimard's timewill cost the Duchess, or anybody else, money.That is what is so admirable about LaGuimard : she really did know how to makethe Pretty Theatre pay. Only one womanever surpassed her in this.... the immenseMile. Montansier; but then Mile. Montansiersurpassed every theatrical one in every thea- trical thing, and for this became the headand front of the Pretty Theatre: there wasnone like her, none. And some wretches evenadded " Thank God *\But La Guimard ran her close—was lessof an agent and more or less of a free lance.She seems to have managed to raise allher funds without bothering about any chorus,that chorus on which la Montansier countedso greatly.And in 1772 to assist her to raise funds,she persuaded one or more wealthy gentlemento build h§r a maison. This Maison deMile. Guimard she sold in 1786: she sold itby lottery, 2500 tickets at 120 livres (so theysay ; others say 5 livres) a-piece were issued,signed by Mile. Guimard and vised byM. Chavet the notary of Rue St. Martin. Thelucky person to get the house for 120 livres(or for 5) for she bought but one ticket, wasthe Comtesse du Langin who resold the placefor 500,000 francs to the banker Perregaux.This house contained a little private Thea- tre from the designs of Architect Le Doux:a jewel of a Theatre: a casket: able to hold500 spectators. The ceiling was painted byTaraval, the panels by Fragonard, the skirtingboard by the great David. To the perfor- mances given here came every admirer of LaGuimard and The Pretty Theatre. The re- pertoire has been collected under the title" Theatre d'Amour ".Assisting her would be Mile. Dervieux,Mile. Duthe and other talented persons. LaGuimard could hardly be described as pretty,but, like Ophelia when mad, she, when sane,turned things to favour and to prettiness. {To be continued) % (1) For parts 1. and 2 see " The Mask October1924 and January 1925.(2) There is no date to the letter.

After anEngraving by Biondel. find that one house in every five, at aconservative estimate, ought to have itsdistinguishing badge (J). If all these hou- ses were purchased by the State andconverted into museums the people ofParis would have to move to thecountry ; this is the reason, or one ofthe reasons, why many a landlord hasrefused to claim a noble lineage for hisproperty. One in particular has effectedwhat is really a posthumous eviction.I now write in the house whereRacine lived during the last six yearsof his life, where Clairon lived forthirty, where Adrienne Lecouvrear mether tragic death, and where Voltairewas a frequent visitor. Before me aredocuments proving these facts, but thelandlord, having hidden his marbletablet in the cellar, points down thestreet to No. 13, telling his illustrioustenants that they must apply elsewherefor admission; he will have none ofthem. For some time, (until there wassome talk in the Chamber of Deputiesof purchasing such houses at a nominalsum) this, same landlord was proud toshow visitors the room in which hewas 44 sure the author of 4 Ph£dre *breathed his last, " and he woulddoubtless have written indignant lettersto the papers protesting against anyupstart historian who dared questionthe authenticity of the Hotel de Ranes.But now it is different INext door is the house, undistin- guished by any tablet, where Balzaclived as printer and publisher; youmay have your shoes half-soled underits eaves. Five minutes* walk fromthere you may buy peas and onions inthe (unmarked) mansion where Lau- rence Sterne lived and wrote part ofthe 44 Sentimental Journey **. Withoutknowing it you may sleep in Synge'sroom for seven francs a night, rent Tur- genev*s apartment, have breakfast inFlaubert's library, and drink an aperitifat the same bar over which Verlainereceived his absinthe. All this is very THAT practical common sense forwhich the French are celebrated isseen to best advantage in the use towhich the nation has put her shrinesand public monuments. The unin- formed tourist who has visited theLouvre and paid his respects to theVictor Hugo house in the Place desVosges is wont to imagine that everyother double-starred attraction has like- wise been converted into a museumand cared for by the State. As hewanders through the streets, readingthe marble tablets that mark the housewhere 44 Alfred de Musset, born atsuch a place on such a day, died, "or where Th£ophile Gautier spent twoyears of his life, he is likely to beimpressed with the idea that the Frenchare an altogether pious people of cul- tured historians, guardians of a brilliantpast, eager to perpetuate in marble thelandmarks that recall an illustrious past.The sentimental tourist, asl HenryJames would have called him, does notknow, however, that the houses nowdistinguished by the familiar yellowtablet represent possibly less than onepercent of the total that deserve com- memoration. Let him enquire into thehistory of the houses in but a singleold street in Paris and he will soon pleasant and as it should be; the Pa- risian cannot be expected to turn hiscity into a museum; after all, Balzacand Voltaire and the rest are dead,and the butcher and post-card vendormust live.THE OLD STAGE IN PARIS.There is one such monument ofwhich I would try to render someaccount, for it cannot long survive theuses to which it has been put. Wereit not that the stage, and the shell atleast of the whole structure of the oldCom£die Frangaise were still in exis- tence, the statement that Paris has noold theatres would be quite true. Thestatement was made not long ago byan authority on stage history that theoldest theatre in Paris dates only fromthe end of the eighteenth century. Theruin I am to tell about dates from theseventeenth (2).The remains of what was for ahundred years the most brilliant, mostimportant and most celebrated theatrein Europe, may be seen to-day not fifty yards from the* Boulevard St.Germain. The somewhat modernizedfacade is distinguished from a row ofsimilar facades by a tablet, now yellowwith age and all but undecipherable,on which you may read that this is the 44 former Hotel of the ComddiensFrangais, ** and that it was occupiedby the King's Troupe between 1689and 1770. The wooden stage, insidestands almost as it stood when theTroupe moved to better quarters ahundred and fifty years ago. Theoriginal balconies and corridors havebeen made over into apartments, andthe parterre—or pit—is at present anopen courtyard. The stage and dres- sing rooms, fly galleries and loft abovehave all been converted into store- rooms and offices for the use of awholesale book distributor.There are people working frommorning to night on the stage whereClairon and Lecouvreur, Mol6 andLekain achieved fame; there are fa- milies living in rooms the floors ofwhich have been trod by Rousseau,Diderot, Voltaire and Beaumarchais,cooking their meals in kitchens onceoccupied by boxes where sat the kingsof France—and their mistresses. Thestairs up which Voltaire climbed todiscuss with Clairon the play he waswriting and the very dressing-room inwhich that imperious minx receivedher illustrious admirers, are now usedby porters bearing heavy boxes of booksand made into platforms for the storingof old furniture and discarded officesupplies. With one exception, no oneof all 1 addressed in the building knewthat he was rubbing elbows with theghosts of the past, and no one seemedto care.It was by accident that I learnedof the existence of the stage of the oldCom£die. I had indeed often noticedthe tablet, but I assumed that thebuilding had been erected over the spotonce occupied by the theatre, and wasnot, indeed, the famous building itself.TREADING HALLOWEDo GROUND. oOne day it occurred to me to enterthe courtyard of No. 14 Rue de1'Ancienne Com£die. The illustratorof these notes had armed himself witha ground plan of the structure as itexisted in the middle of the eighteenthcentury, and together we succeeded inidentifying air the important parts ofthe stage and 44 house " that have beenpermitted to remain.Passing the concierge's door weenter the courtyard, the ground ofwhich, now covered with cobblestones,marks the exact location of the oldparterre. This is a space twenty-sevenby thirty-five feet square, formerlyroofed in; now, of course, there is only the open sky. At the other endof the court, facing us as we enter,is a series of three high windows anda glazed door which, when thrownopen in warm weather, allows us tosee the stage opening as it was 200years ago. On the occasion of ourfirst visit the snow was falling, to thatit was necessary to knock at the door.No one answers our summons andwe walk boldly in. The floor, weperceive, is modem, but just under itis another, of solid oak planks; theoriginal stage. Through packing boxesand heaps of books we are able toobserve the slant of the floor, a con- siderable grade from the highest pointup-stage right down to the curtain line.We ask an employee for permis- sion to 44 look around "—we are stu- dents of the French theatre and wouldlike to make a few sketches of thisstage. The employee knows nothing ofany stage and informs us that it isforbidden to enter. Since, however,we have already entered, he is a littleperplexed—he knows no regulationsbeyond the first, but takes it uponhimself to tell us that we must makeformal application to the owner. Wenext ask whether it is forbidden tolook elsewhere. Oh, not at ail-outsidehis own precincts we are quite atliberty I One takes the small stairwayto the right.The stairway, we see, proclaims itsauthenticity by the style of its ironrailings and the size and shape, of theterra cotta tiles. We refer to our planand identify it as one of two that gave access on the first floor to two stageboxes, on the next to the actors'dressing rooms, and at the top to thegalleries over the stage. Nothing re- mains of the stage boxes except twoplatforms, now used as store-rooms.The dressing rooms, what is left ofthem, are used as cloak rooms for theclerks. We mount to the secondstory—which is, by European count,the third, and, from behind a moderntemporary wall running round a largeoffice, we cat-ch sight of the ends ofhuge beams supporting the roof.The office occupies the greater partof the space once used for manipula- ting such scenery as was used inelaborate productions. As we look outof the windows into the courtyard weare standing immediately over the oldproscenium arch, and the solid beamsthat formed its basis are now used tosupport the new floor. The windowsthat allow us a view of the 4 4 house "have of course been put in during the- last century. A young man in the office appearsto understand the object of our visitand one is not surprised to learn that heis working in a theatre. It is throughhis courtesy and interest that we areallowed to break the rules of the houseand descend to the floors below. Wenow go down the stairway to the left.From this side the actors' dressing roomshave entirely disappeared ; nothing re- mains but the floors, which are utilizedfor some dark purpose which we areunable to fathom. Reaching the floorimmediately below, we stand in agallery that was used by the manipu- lators of lights and of the elaboratescenery that was introduced after themiddle of the eighteenth century. Thisgallery is about fourteen feet above thelevel of the stage and extends aroundthree sides of it. On a level with theeye are small modern windows set injust above the bottom of the oldproscenium opening. Between the floorof this gallery and that of the officeabove—a space of less than eightfeet—is a forest of beams and rafters,untouched, even by paint, since 1770.On some of the cross beams overheadwe discover wooden pulleys used forraising and lowering stage-sets. Someof these are all but hidden by theinnumerable book bins and packingboxes, the weight of which threatensthe collapse of the entire gallery.ONTO THE FORBIDDEN STAGE.We now descend into the forbiddenarea of the stage itself. Here againare book bins and boxes, stoves, a small elevator and many desks. We peerinto dark corners, measuring distancesand deciphering our plan, and discoverthat this space is practically intact;nothing has been done to the stageexcept to encumber it with the para- phernalia of a combined storeroom andoffice. Take down the glass doorsy sealup the modern windows, clear out thebooks, desks and inclosed offices, andyou might produce a play before anaudience standing, as audiences did, inthe pit, out in the open courtyard.Let us leave the stage for a mo- ment and step into the street. Thefacade is that of the ordinary seven- teenth century house, not appreciablydifferent from many another in theneighborhood.A new story has been added to theold structure, or rather the originalmansards have been incorporated intoa new top story. The little shopsoccupying the ground floor were for- merly used as entrances and ticketwindows. In the front part of thebuilding—between the street and thecourtyard—there is a staircase whichgave access to the second and thirdtiers of boxes.On the death of Moli&amp;re in 1673,the troupe he had organized and trainedwas expelled from the Palais-Cardinal(now the Palais-Royal) at the instiga- tion of the composer Lully. Lullyhad his own theatre at the time inthe Rue de Vaugirard, but feeling thathe was out of the fashionable districthe insisted on appropriating the theatrein which his old rival had found fameand success.Moli&amp;re's successor, Lagrange, isforced to look for a new home. Hefinds a tennis court in the Rue desFosses de Nesle (now the Rue Ma- zarine). This tennis court is convertedinto a theatre, and the old Moli&amp;retroupe, joining forces with the Com£-diens du Marais, sets up business fora short time as the Theatre Gu£n£gaud.In 1680 Louis XIV. issues a decree consolidating the actors of the Th&amp;treGu6n6gaud with those of the Hotelde Bourgogne. It is this famous decreethat marks the establishment of thetheatre now known as the Com6die-Frangaise, or the Theatre-Frangais.In his will Cardinal Mazarin hadestablished the College des QuatreNations. The college occupied theground now marked by the cupola ofthe Institute. Unfortunately for thecomedians, their theatre was just 200yards from the sacred precincts of thecollege. Complaints were made andin 1687 Louis issued another decreerequiring the actors to seek otherquarters. The next move was to apoint not three minutes walk up thesame street toward what is now theBoulevard St. Germain, to anothertennis court, evidently outside the zonewhere the college youths were allowedto wander The Jeu de paume del'Etoile occupied an irregularly shapedplot of ground between the old Ruedes Foss6s-Saint-Germain-des-pr£s andtwo houses on the old Rue des Mauvaisgargons. The Rue des Foss6s is nowthe Rue de Fancienne Com6die, theother is the Rue Gr£goire-de-Tours.The architect, Francois d'Orbay, set towork filling the old spaces at hisdisposal and in 1689 the new theatreinaugurated the most brilliant period ofits long career with a performance ofRacine's " Phidre " and " Medecin malgr£ lui ".The theatre was considered one ofthe most magnificent buildings of Europe.The " house " included three balconiesof loges, not including the stage boxesand benches on the stage itself. It issaid that 2,000 spectators could beaccommodated. This seems an exag- geration, though it must be borne inmind that there were no seats in theparterre, and that many hundreds canbe crowded into a space 850 feetsquare. Besides, there is no reason tobelieve that 250 years ago the Frenchnation was any more particular aboutthe comfort of its audiences than it isnow. The parterre gods of the day,called " Knights of the Chandelier "because of the huge cluster of waxcandles that dripped grease into thepit, were so tightly fitted into theirpen as to make it impossible to faintwith decency when the air became, asit often did, overheated. The Theatredes Vari6t£s, now doing business onthe Boulevards, has been modeled, sofar as crowding and ventilation areconcerned, on the old Com£die Fran- gaise.Let us now return to the stage.Look for a moment at the accompa- nying diagram, a copy of the -sketchmade by the architect Biondel in 1752.With the exception of the beams thatsupport the galleries just over the stage,the two stairways (B and C), and thetwo wooden walls (A), little of thestructure of the upper part of the stageremains. The long double lines to the rightand left of the open part of the stage(marked U) mark the position of rail- ings behind which, indicated by aseries of lines, were the stage benches.These benches were the occasion ofone of the most interesting episodes ofstage history, and this particular stagewas the scene of a drama more eventfulthan most of the tragedies enactedupon it.You will notice that the open spacebetween the railings is very small com- pared with the total area behind thecurtain line (D). The stage benchesand boxes below them occupied allthe floor space except an opening fifteenfeet wide at the curtain and elevenup-stage. The benches were the mostdesirable places in the theatre, andwere occupied by the rich merchants,the nobility and others who wished toshow themselves to the 44 house #\44 During the entire evening of aperformance ", says one writer, 44 therewas not a moment's silence on thestage, even during the most affectingtragic scenes. Rich merchants, wittypetits-maitrcs, entered and left, followedby servants in elaborate attire, bustledto and fro, talked and joked, whilethe actors endeavored to drown outthe confusion and attract the attentionof the audience ".Dramatists bitterly complain of thenuisance: Cr£biIIon cites the case of a well dressed young man who enteredafter the curtain had risen; as he waslooking for his seat the audience ima- gined him to be the lover in the play,Voltaire never wearies of repeating thathe is forced to write his plays with aview to the convenience of the spec- tators on the benches, and must ofteneliminate an effective scene because itwould be ridiculed by the petits-maitres.Indeed, that strict adherence to theunities which every self-respecting eigh- teenth century dramatist is everlastinglypreaching about is attributable in largemeasure to the cramped stage of theConfedie. What was worse, no actorwas ever free of interruption and fewplays escaped a shower of commentsfrom the benches. THE NUISANCE SIDE OFo PLAYGOING. o As we look down from the dustyplatform that surrounds the stage onthree sides it is almost impossible toconceive the narrowness of the spaceat the disposal of the old actors.There where the bookkeeper now sitsin his glass cage were rows of benches,and this side of the elevator shaft marksthe railing of the benches on the left.It must have been at the very spotwhere now hangs a 44 No Smoking "sign that a certain actor, playing thepart of a messenger in a pseudo-Roman tragedy, arrived at a critical momentand found his way blocked by spec- tators. The actors down-stage waitedfor his entrance and cue, and couldnot continue. A tense moment, relievedimmediately after by a clarion voicefrom the pit:44 Make way for the messenger! "What matter if the scene was spoiled !This intolerable nuisance was bornefor over a hundred years, just as theinnumerable abuses of to-day are borneand will continue to be borne—forfinancial reasons* Everyone knows thatgoing to the theatre in Paris is anordeal, but so long as the public iswilling to pay ushers for the privilegeof being shown to the wrong seat, nochange will be made.So it was with the benches, onlyin that case it was the actors whobenefited, and not, as to-day, themanagers. However, in 1759 theCount de Lauraguais offered the meansof effecting an immediate reform. H/sdrew up a report which he submittedto the court, and was permitted to payfor the renovation of the stage. At acost of 60,000 livres the stage wasfinally cleared of the benches. Thefirst performance on the new stage wasdesigned to show what could be doneunder conditions allowing the intro- duction of scenery and greater freedomof action to the players. Says theMercure de France after the opening night: 44 Ijt was to be feared that thestage might seem too bate with noone on it bat the actors ; however, itwas only necessary to witness upon itA comedy ", &amp;c. The italics are mine.The bench frequenters were furiousand gathered in the old Cafe Procope,just opposite the theatre (and still inexistence) where, it is said, 44 themirrors and chandeliers were the onlysufferers " in the row.It was after 1759 that the pulleysfor handling scenery were installed inthe first gallery, of which I have alreadyspoken. Just over our heads, underthe floor above, we discover two woodenpulleys. On the opposite side of thegallery is one more, intact like theother two: but the fourth is gone.These pulleys, 1 dare say, would notrevolutionize stage history; they arecertainly not the sort of relic the Statepreserves in glass cases but they domean something. They mark an epoch,they symbolize an event in theatricalhistory as momentous as the discoveryof the cyclorama or the introductionof real water into a storm scene, andI think with regret of that fourth pulleywhich I am told, was 44 taken by theproprietor for his personal needs1 have often wondered what these44 personal needs " were, and wonderedagain how long before his 44 personalneeds " will demand the utter demo~lition of the old building.

CORRESPONDENCE. A DICTIONARY OF THE DRAMA. Faithfully yours,One of your Earliest Subscribers. To the Editor of the Mask*Sir : LAST April in an article in " The Mask ** ProfessorAllardyce Nicoll informed us that he was engaged withsome twenty students in the preparation of an elaborateDictionary of the Drama.More recently a friend sent me a four-leaf prospectusof Professor Nicoll's School of Dramatic Study and Re- search, and on page 2 of this I read that A Dictionaryof British Drama is being prepared.I suppose these refer to one and the same work ; andyet what a vast difference exists twixt the subject " Drama "and the subject " British Drama I must say I am somewhat disappointed.The best " Dictionary of British Drama " that I havecome across was begun by Davenport Adams — (youhave spoken of this in " The Mask " already) and waspublished by Chatto &amp; Windus. The first and only vo- lume is decidedly usefull.I understand that much of the material for a secondvolume has existed ever since the work was stopped bythe death of Mr. Davenport Adams. So that ProfessorNicoll's labours need not be as arduous as at first theyseemed likely to be: more especially since all the facts aboutBritish Drama could get without much difficulty into two orthree volumes, whereas an adequate Dictionary of Euro- pean Drama would require at least twelve volumes.May 1 at the same time ask when Mr. GordonCraig's School for the Art of the Theatre is going toreopen? It seems to some of us to be more needed thanit ever was. FOREIGN NOTES MILANO O. Salamim. WE live in the most active city in Italy and yet wedo not advance very much in theatrical things. Weare and like to remain Milanese — rather unconcernedas to what is going on in other places. We have our i eatro alia Scaia — which is larger than the Paris OperaHouse — and the singing is bfetter, the conductor a manof genius, and our direction is energetic and able. Yefsomehow while our work at the Scala pleases the middleclass shopkeeper and his family and strikes them as veryoriginal, and our old playhouse which is the perfection ofcomfort, sanitation and regularity pleases the true Milanesegentiluomo we cannot exactly be said to do much in thef 1 .11 • "«Vway or brilliance.We go on and on and we repeat masterpieces and dothem adequately — (the adequate with us is the highwater mark of endeavour and we are fantastically adequate)and oar theatre is a success, and yet something is lacking— a spark is lacking.Reduce the whole proportions of this theatre to thatof some small opera house in Voghera or Pesaro, reducethe salaries and the expenses and the display and thenumbers of the performers, and any Milanese coming toour theatre wduld be in no way astonished. Toscaniniwill always be Toscanini, that is to say, the first conductorof the age ; but he might be far better occupied conductingin a big hall like the Augusteo in Roma; in fact we aresure that his finer work would be heard better there.In a theatre a master-conductor is more or less thrownaway. What is needed in a theatre is the theatrical atits best; a musical, poetical, or a literary director is al- ways an error.There are other places for these great persons.The Theatrical must dominate in a Theatre, and theTheatrical is, I regret to say it, the roguish ; the deity ofthe place is not a solemn one, nor earnest, nor hectic:he is easy going and nowadays a bit of a rascal.Unfortunately, Toscanini can never be that. He is theForbes Robertson of the Italian Theatre; a man whosomehow or other with all his immense adequacy is not heard at his best in the theatre. FROM LONDON. A leading London journal writes that a combinationof Miss Gladys Cooper and Sir Gerald du Maurierin Mr, Frederick Lonsdale's new comedy 44 The Lastof Mrs Cheyney " may come about this season.If it comes about, 44 this combination of three of theoutstanding figures of the English Theatre "it 44 should bethe big stage event of the autumn *\ From this statement one can guage how immensethe other events are likely to be.

Halton &amp; Truscott Smith, Ltd. London 1924. 30/- net THIS is a very delightful book whichI, for one, would have printed onvery much thinner paper. There is noother fault (if this be a fault) that I canfind with the work of the publishers,which is done in a lavish manner, andwith taste.What is said in the book is exactlywhat was necessary to say, namely,that we have in England " sufficientmaterial from which to develop a spec- tacular dance for the theatre whichshall consist of movements at once na- tural and expressive, and possessing theadvantage for England that they arecast in the dance idiom of our owncountry. " All critics having any doubtscould not do better than copy thisstatement and embellish it ten ortwelve times in the course of each year.Foreign dances really do deserve a rest.It really is time, I think, for an En- glish ballet. I should hate to becomesceptical, but I am sceptical for thismoment. I am sceptical when I seea thing called the English InternationalOpera Company holding itself up onforeign operas. It is quite absurd tocall something which is not English, En- glish. Call it what you will but donot call it English- There are heapsof other good names. And I dread lestan English ballet should be grown fromRussian seed. It would be excessivelystupid.Cecil Sharpe, the author of this book,devoted long years of his life, withvery little help from others, to searchingfor an English folk dance tradition, forhe felt that, if he once found it andcould give it shape, an English balletwould in time come into being.I haye often imagined an Englishballet, and I have a little imaginationand can sometimes spend half an hourwatching the ballets which I myselfcreate. Do not suppose me to be oneof those superior beings who believethat all is created solely through the imagination. Before all, perhaps, thereis the dancer, and I should be sorryfor the public to be obliged to rely onme to cut the capers; but I can seethese ballets — these English ballets.&lt; I see the curtain rising, I know thecolour. It is not the colour of theRussian ballet, nor that of the French;it is the English colour right enough.I see the first movement: that is En- glish, too. It is quite unlike anythingthe great Diaghilev brought to Englandfrom Russia. It is rather more easy ;it is about six times as healthy. Therewas always something just a trifle sickabout the Russians : a certain sicknesssoused in perfumery. Of its kind it iswithout question the very last word,but the kind has nothing whatever todo with the English ballet which, asyou are doubtless aware, must have amelancholy all it own and a merrynessnot necessarily noisy.And I am told that Mr. Cochranhas started an English ballet. Well,with all due respect to Mr. Cochran,I very much have my doubts. Mr.Cochran, whom I have always thoughtowed much to influence of Mr. Duveen,is one of the most able men in thedramatic world to start a limited lia- bility company, but an English balletis not in his line. Mr. Cochran is animpresario : nothing certainly less — andnot more. It was Mr. Cecil Sharpe whowas the founder of the English ballet.Not that his rescuscitation of the Morrisdance means very much. It would bea mistake to take the English Morrisdance as revived by Mr. Sharpe tooseriously, but there are things in it whichcan never be taken seriously enough.In a little booklet by Ralph Gardiner,called " The English Folk Dance Tra- dition ", the author says that one ofthe great projects of the English FolkDance Society is the creation of anEnglish ballet comparable to those ofRussia and Sweden. I do not likethat word u project ". Neither do Ilike the suggestion that a dance societyis to be left to the creating of thislong-waited-for ballet. I would ra- ther Mr. Gardiner created it himself;or, if Mr. Gardiner is not a great dan- cer, that he should create it togetherwith one great dancer, preferably aman. Now and again societies giveus original performers but not habitually.The greatest French actor of the eigh- teenth century, Le Kain, came from aprivate society theatre, but somehow Ilook for a great dancer to appear anyday from the ranks of a pantominechorus in Huddersfield, or Nottingham,or Bradford. Such a man would notbe in love with the Russian ballet. If anything he would rather fear it andbe silent where Chelsea gushes. Andto such a man this book by Sharpewould mean very little ; and the truthis that all this book can do is to keepin front of our eyes the fact that thereis such a thing as the dance, and thatit was very wonderful in France, andwas courageous in Italy, and charmingin Vienna. Such a book can keepus all talking at the dinner table. Itis like a little illustrated programme ofan evening's entertainment which haslasted nineteen centuries, gone by in aflash like a bicycle goes by the win- dow, in a flash. The nineteen centuriesof Dance and Ballet have gone by inthat flash, leaving England nothingbehind.I believe that there is really some- thing true in the fact that one mustbe quick to catch a thing as it is goingby; something true in it. Of courseif you have a policeman at theend of the street and you give himhis orders he will stop the bicycle, butwhat worries me is that he might notbe able to arrest the intelligence of acouple of centuries.... still one neverknows.This book by Sharpe and Opp&amp;contains a great deal of history. Anumber of dates, allied with a numberof names, and illustrated by a numberof superb reproductions; for there areseventy-five plates, and seven illustra- tions in the text, and the four colou- red plates engraved and printed byReiach are really charming; and thesethings all help to make it very wellworth its price, and I bless the au- thors for giving us a good index.Has the book sold well? I hearso often of books that do not sell well,and that always makes me worry aboutpaper and the binding of books; and,as I said at the beginning I thoughtthat this paper was rather too heavy,too rich, I must now point to an extrafault; I think the binding is too ex- pensive. If paper and binding hadbeen less, could not the book havecome out at half the price —at 15/ -Such a price is more within the reachof another four or five hundred people.And, still thinking about paper and thebinding of books, 1 wonder if it wouldnot be possible to bring the bookout for 5/ -, giving a little less pe -haps, and certainly eliminating more an 1more of the swank. It's swank tha:costs such a lot nowadays. Can't gcto a theatre ! Why not ? Plush seats,Bristol board programmes, one shilling.Axminster carpets on staircase. Twohundred extra lamps for the auditorium.Costumes for the people who show you into your seat. Evening dress forthe manager; motor car to and fromthe place. Hoity, toity. What is themeaning of all this swank ? It is notworth anything, and yet millions ofpounds are wasted on it. You tell methat nobody would visit the not-Swankytheatre, that nobody would buy swank- less books. I would not like you toconsider me at all rude, but if you area good friend of mine I tell you thatyou are deluded. If you had twoo orthree days to spare (and if I had) Iwould go through all the details of theproduction of books and the manage- ment of theatres, and I would showyou step by step where all this swankwas unnecessary and how it totted upto the waste of many millions ofpounds.I only regret the swellness of thisparticular book because it is a book Ishould like to see many thousand peo- ple possessing. The same publishersissue another book on 44 Old Frenchline Engravings", this they limit to1250 copies, and issue at three gui- neas and seven guineas, which seemsto me a very proper thing to do, be- cause old French line engravings arethings which very few cultured peoplelove to ponder over; and their bookof 44 Old French Colour Prints *\ byCampbell Dodgson, also limited, is quitereasonable at three guineas ; but 44 TheDance which is a popular thing, be- longs to the public, and the publicshould be able to buy all its popularthings very cheaply. FUCINI. NOVELLE E POESIE,Edited by Henry Furst D. Litt. : Uni- versity of Chicago Italian series.THE little books of this series areedited by Mr Ernest Hatch Wil- kins. And it is, to judge from thisvolume, a really delightful series.Scholarly, not too bulky, pleasant goodpaper, solidly bound, copious notes,and Dr Furst's notes are clear, briefand entertaining: it is just what iswanted.Fucini was born in 1843. 44 Nowriter " says Dr Furst, 44 excelledhim in simplicity and purity of style,in serenity of outlook, humour andgenuine feeling He wrote in thePisan dialect. 44 He taught belle let- tere (or, as he said, cartoline postali)at a boyfs school in Pistoia ". Thenhe became an inspector of schools,14 an occupation for which his naturewas perfectly adapted ". He died in192LMatthew Arnold was older by r twenty years but they were contem- i poraries. I should like to read an5 imaginary conversation between theset two who were both poets and bothE inspectors of schools.5 Dr Furst gives us three out of ther hundred sonnets of Fucini and ten of• the tales and a selection from Fucini's► impressions of Napoli. Ever since the: sonnets appeared in 1872 they must: have proved a source of inspiration to' hundreds of comedians; Musco, Fer- ravilla, Petrolini, who have assuredly■ held the book in their hands as somuch treasure; and it is only whensuch comedians read such verses aloudthat we, the poor public, ever get thefull value of them.For there is something loud inthem : and the loud has more in itthan the timid suspect, for to the timidthere is mostly rudeness ia the loud.For my part I want to hear moresonnets, verses, tales of genius spokenaloud, but not by the poets : by theactors and to people who delight tolisten as the Italians do. I cannotabide to be listening with folk whoare waiting for something pathetic,sententious, witty or biting. The loudis anyhow a guarantee that we are tobe spared these things : I feel safe withthe loud the moment it strikes up. Itis after all only the old elephant ofthe jungle : but the pathetic, the sen- tentious and the witty, as they start,remind me too immediately of thecrocodile, the lion and the tiger cat.I have never loved the lion to theextent that tradition does. He issupposed to be so bold, so direct,whereas he approaches his prey in atortuous way. Ferravilla would bealways likening people to animals, I amtold. 44 Look —a horse " he would say,or 44 a grey cat Many an actor hasthis instinct and looks quickly for theanimal each man stands for. THE CALL OF THE NIRVANA,Drama in Five Acts by Rudolf Broda,English version with the collaborationof Selma B. Stone. The Four SeasCo. Boston.THIS publishing house in its announce- ments, prospectuses and wrapperstells the public that this series of books,ie The Contemporary Series, are booksof belles-lettres,—poetry, plays, essays,issued in an attractive format andavailable at a popular price. But whenI search to discern how popular is thisprice nothing informs me.I am however rewarded, for I findsomething else, which is, that these • books include a playlet by Benavente,i one by Gordon Bottomley and one byf Von Hofmannsthal.i M The Call of the Nirvana " israther more than a bit dull: it is the! copyright of Ernst Bircher, VerlagAktiengesellchaft in Berne. It readsbadly. It might, who knows, act welland it might not. I can conceive no- thing more undramatic, but then I canconceive nothing less attractive thanthe 44 heavy antique wove paper the44 coloured wrappers 99 and the 44 spe- cial designs" which are all made agreat point of in the announcements.In 1923 the same firm issued 4&lt; TheArt of Cineplastics " by Elie Fauretranslated from the French by WalterPach, Price I/—. (They announcedprices in those days). A rare 1000copies were issued — 44 1000 copiesonly '* — and 25 on Stratford Paperwhatever that may be. M. Faure saysin this booklet that Chaplin (re Charlie)makes him think of Shakespeare.... hehas the same bewildering and yet lucidlyricism that Shakespeare had 41 LucidLyricism *#! and there is something inMr Walter Pach that reminds me ofShakespeare,—the silver sound, I think,44 and music with its silver sound ".But the golden silence of Chaplin,how that can be compared with Shakes- peare who is all words puzzles me.Compare Charlie with an actor andI'm with you, Elie. Compare himwith Ferravilla.... but where has Charliesuddenly gone to ? AROUND THEATRES by MaxBeerbohm. Heinemann.Avery remarkable book of Dra- matic Criticisms appeared in Lon- don in the year 1924 and no onenoted it. It was called 44 AroundTheatres *\ was in two volumes, andis by Mr. Max Beerbohm.—Well, Ialmost wonder if I need go on.Is it necessary today to explain whyany book by Mr Beerbohm must bethe best book of the year. Have weforgotten that there is an art of wri- ting ?As a rule we cannot write and Iam almost convinced that the thing wecall thinking is not exactly thinking.But Mr. Bernard Shaw, Sir A. W.Pinero, Mr Rudyard Kipling, and adozen more " great writers" and44 thinkers '* are, I believe, convincedthat they can both write and think:and, being so convinced, they set towith a will, and, thinking it all out,they then write it all down. As Iamdoing here. But what troubles me is that I know1 am doing it badly. No such doubt'roubles them—as she said " no bloom- ng fearWhat I want to be saying in twowords, and take a hundred and missdoing it, is that I think Beerbohm isone of the best brains and one of thefew perfect writers we have had, andI cannot say it. To plump it out wouldbe of no good. Even a drama musthave a beginning, a middle and anend.And I am so impatient; I want theaudience to come in with me to allour Theatres—to this one here—to sitdown—hold up their hands to a cur- tain on which are flashed the words" All's understood " and go out againand enjoy themselves there. As I amdoing here.But Mr Shaw, Sir A. W. Pineroand the others don't want that at all.Good gracious no. They want nothingto be understood until they have for- ced us all to come to heel —to entera parody of the real playhouse, to sitthere three hours and go out moreconfused than before. Then and thenonly may we go home and take twenty- five years waiting for the light todawn.... and slowly, slowly get theglimmering that we—just—have—wa-sted— twenty-five — years listening tomodern dramatists talking about prac- tically nothing at all.Some of us arrive at this by a sortof short cut to happiness and avoidgoing to listen to modern dramatiststalking. I am one of these. Sometwenty-six years ago I heard a playby Mr Pinero and three years laterone by Mr Shaw, and I never wantto hear another. Some thirty years ago 1 read a page by Mr. Max Beer- fbohm and I never intend to miss ano- ther.Explain why it is that these boreus and the other enchants. Or ra- ther let me do so in two lines. Itis because Mr Beerbohm is a bornartist and Mr. Shaw and Sir A. W.Pinero and many of the other admira- ble gentlemen in the Dramatic fieldnever were and so never can beanything in any way whatever ap- proaching to the condition of artists.And so while Mr Shaw for threeyears wrote a dramatic criticism eachweek in the " Saturday Review ", re- tiring from the post to give place toBeerbohm who for twelve years wrotea dramatic criticism each week for thesame " Saturday Review ", the Shawessays count as nothing and the Beer- bohm essays are well-nigh perfect.Shaw, who looks like Hercules, gives in after three years of it; Beer- bohm, who looks like anything butHercules, beats him by enduring nineyears longer than the giant was ableto ....this is of course a point everyonewill have noted.I regret that these two new volumesare two out of a rare set of nine, forthose who should know of these Dra- matic Criticisms will not come to knowof them until Messrs Heinemann is- sue a popular edition ; and let us hopethis will appear during 1926. I dohope this with all my heart.I had intended to lift tempting pas- sages from these essays but I will not:you must somehow get hold of a copyand read all the essays. There is oneon Henry Irving which you will readseveral times. I advise you to read itafter you have read Mr Shaw's articleon " Mr Irving takes paregoric " datedMay 4th 1895. In that article MrShaw is constrained to state, of theStory of Waterloo, that " there isabsolutely no acting in it—none what- ever " ; he asserts, too, that a call-boycould have performed a certain passagein that play. In fact Mr Shaw, besidesbeing no artist, is woefully ignorant ofacting ; yet he assumes, when he writes,all the assurance of one who knowsall about it.Mr Beerbohm, on the other hand,is a born actor, and, so far as I know,makes no pretention at all to beingthat. Every fine artist has a bit ofgenius for acting. Giotto and Cellini,Fragonard, Mozart, all of 'em had it ;and poor Shaw is totally without thatbit of genius.... for the reason abovestated.I delight to see, in this the stupidage, our G. B. S. raised up to be acentral figure.If it were not a stupid age, Beer- bohm would in all probability havewrit us our plays ;... they would havebeen powerful humorous things.... no- thing would have been amiss. Insteadof this we have his Dramatic Criticisms—two books just as wise as they areunaffected, as useful to the stage as theyare useful to the student of the En- glish language. The student of Englishhas profitted ; the theatre, as representedby those who elbow their way inand out of its stagedoor, has notprofitted.But those of us who do care verymuch that the playhouse shall recoveritself, as assuredly it shall, offer toMr. Beerbohm our admiration and ourthanks for the lessons he gave us everySaturday for twelve years and whichsome day we hope to show him wehave more or less understood. RING MASTERS.RICHARD WAGNER&amp; JAMES .My Circus Life by James Lloyd witha preface by G. K. Chesterton,Noel Douglas. Price 5j*Wagner's Music Drama of the Ringby L. Archier Leroy ; engravings byPaul Nash. (Noel Douglas) Price / 2 j-6*NOEL Douglas of 38 Great OrmondStreet, London is a new-comer inthe Publishers' Ring. He enters the magiccircle with a crack of the whip. Andout trot some of the prettiest little po- nies ever I did see, in the shape ofbooks as buxom as good work andmaterials and watchful eyes can makethem.When we see good craftsmanship inthe publishing or theatrical line or, forthat matter, in the way of restaurants,Hotels, or Governments, our mindsoften turn to thinking of the unseenworkmen who can make or mar allcooperative work.Is it not some sort of toast to absentguests some of us offer silently to thegood workmen on seeing their work :— are the curses not loud but deep tothe bad workmen.And of course the good ones knowof this—feel it in their bones—be theyhidden by a big curtain or thick walls,by black ink or red tape. The badworkmen never know what they getfrom us or what they misss That'swhat renders them surly and makesthem strike.And the good hidden workman, onhearing the rounds of applause, looksat the ring-master as he strides out toacknowledge with a bow the approvalof the public for the work of himselfand his men.On the return of the ring-masterdoes he go round to all and sundryand say " It was you, old chap, whomade the show ;—the applause is yours,not mineRing-masters may once in a bluemoon realize when some one memberof a company has actually done thework of forty—but he has to be veryill first, ...laid up, unable to be onthe spot.The ringmasters, for all the applausethey endure, are to be respected.When I first saw Barnum's Big Circusthere were three rings. In each aring-master. And here we have threeof them too. Douglas, Wagner andLloyd.Douglas is dressy, Wagner classic,and Lloyd knows his business. Bar- num, the Deity of Showmen, presidesover the whole business.The cover of the Wagner book hasmade itself up like the face of a clown—Grock couldn't have done it better ;that of the Lloyd book is like thegreen satin trousers of Fratellini. Andthe insides of both books bubble withfun. Even as all clowns get their laughsthrough being deadly in earnest, so dosome of the better kind of Ring-masters.And Wagner gets his that way.Not for Wagner is there any valuein that vulgar saying about laughinglast. He never laughs, just as the classicold ring-master of 1870 never laughed.He lets others do this and he lets otherstalk and sing and run about. Wagner• has let Mr. Leroy his devoted admirertalk, and for 196 pages Mr. Leroytalks Wagner at us. He and Mr. Barborcrack some jokes at his expense and thehorses trot round ; there's the circus.Immense as ever, Richard Wagnertowers in the centre.It is a circus I never go to.On the other hand nothing couldkeep me out of Mr. James Lloyd'scircus.His kind is the genuine article. Thejoke L. A. Leroy makes with H. R.Barbor about Wagner being a Man ofthe theatre hits no one but the gianthimself. Lloyd is here to prove it ajoke and a rather unkind one.Only men like Lloyd are men of thetheatre. Festespiels by the hundred,Beechams by the score, Dalcroze's bythe million, will never be true theatre.A passage in Mr. Leroy's introductionstrikes me as curiously blind. He writes;" When this (some trifle cr other) hasbeen accomplished we may look for- ward to a production of " Tristan ",perhaps, which does not in any wayremind us of an evening at Lord GeorgeSanger's estimable show ".He fails to see, with most Wagne- rians, that what Wagner lacked wasSanger's genius.... the genius of thegenuine Showman, and that his solechance ofj being taken as a serioustheatre man lay in a forlorn hope thatsome day he might remind us of LordGeorge Sanger.I could understand a Wagner whobegan the way he did; who went :through it all and came out cured, andthen began his work. But to go onand in still further, to grow more and 'more Wagnerian when he should have 1grown more and more Sangerian, that's &lt;the trouble.These two books are made to live Iside by side. Mr Lloyd's faults are tall the showman's—in a book he has -41 been and gone anJ done it" as Mr. Chesterton says in a charmingIntroduction.And inasmuch as he has been ashowman and gone off afterwards anddone a book to say what exactly isthe whole life of a showman—a manof the theatre — by so much has heblazed light on the rare old smokewhich Mr. Leroy and some three hun- dred other very clever men produce fromtheir bonfires as they go round andround and round them throwing in thisand that fillet, root and entrail, so asto make the charm work, and ultimately,we hope, " to share i* the gains *\" Up from the clown " is the mottoof the men of the theatre, not downfrom the Gods How long will ittake humanity (and one may add thecritic) to see this ?Is it not the cry " up from theape " that gives man at last a hope ?If it is " down from the Gods " thenall hope has gone. And if Wagnerbe one of the Giants—if his spirit hasreached so high as Bach, Beethoven andMozart, what the deuce are his gnomesdoing numbling round our cauldron ? JACOPONE DA TODI, POETAND MYSTIC. 1228*1306; byEvelyn Underbill. Dent Sons.16/— net.IF ever an intemperate man walkedthis earth it was Jacopone da Todi—but there have been few whose in- temperance took them off the earth asdid his. He soared with intempe- rance ; a lack of cardinal virtue laun- ched him into Heaven. He loved somuch that he loved all but himself.A writer in " The Mask " (J) recentlytold us something of his story but Ithink it very unlikely that its readerswill ever hear it retold correctly. Evenpagans nowadays are such scandal- mongers, such back-biters; and Jaco- pone was that unforgivable thing, a trueChristian. Mad, but Christlike in parts.In some ways he resembles thatfigure created by Walter Pater, Den- nys d*Auxerois. But Dennys was farmadder for he seems to have had twomasters—Jacopone had but one. Po- sitively he believed in love and not inFamour. (And this is one of the best books jwe have about him in our English (language. It also contains thirty* four &lt;of his songs in Italian and in English, jThe publishers announce only thirty- |three but I counted twice and counted ,thirty-four. (_ s I regret that the talented authoressforgot to include J. A. Symonds' workin her " Bibliography " : and, while Iam captious, let me indulge a regretthat so many publishers use quite suchthick paper.I don't like rough blotting like pa- per to touch, and I don't think anylover of books likes it. Neither do 1like the top edge of a fine book to bepainted. If gilt, well and good; or ifyeliowed, very carefully, it passes. Butall depends on how these difficult jobsare done. Still the great firm of Dentis not alone in occasionally doing alittle clumsy work. It is more or lessthe fashion today. Not half enoughconsideration is paid to those ancientproblems which beset even the devoted, lovers of good covers, paper, type, set- ting and covers. *I have noticed that the CambridgePress has a delicate taste in such mat- ters. Chatto &amp; Windus too. I oftenlike the books Jonathan Cape sends out.The work of Mr Heinemann used tobe refined and some of it is so still.All the good publishers try to pro- duce fine work of course ; but nowa- days the right kind of brain and eyeseems too often not to be employed bythese publishers.We all know (or suppose) that goodcardboard, cloth, paper and the likeare hard to get and that all thesethings are rather more expensive; but it&amp;brains I'm talking about, the special brainwhich understands what are* the quali- ties needed in book work and how tohandle the book-binders and printers.The Curwen Press has some real ta~lent, and so I take it that the Presshas men of brains and taste in control..Let printers experiment more withnewer papers, newer shapes, colours zand by new I mean those papers andcolours which are in front of theirnoses and so near and so cheap thatthey fail for this reason to be aware- of them.And why put on such heavy andcostly covers ? why such armour-cladaffairs ? why not aim for delicacy andgood sense.This is just what I feel Jacoponewould have said had he ever knownof any but the most superb and yetthe cheapest binding, printing andpaper. Experiment, for heaven's sake,,dear publishers. Put aside a small'sum of money a year to be used solelyfor making experiments ; make them un- beknown to us and on no account riskan experiment in public. Experiment isonly for the laboratory, and, if doneseriously, would cost you only a fewhundreds a year. (i) Vol. X. No. 2. April 1924. f THE GREATER LAW by Leo- nard C.

Price 2/6 net each.FIRST the great old man.Dumas was fifty-seven years oldwhen he wrote this hook and thereare some chapters as good as anythingin " Monte Cristo " or t\&gt;e other mas- ter pieces.He was in Napoli, installed in theChiatamone Palace by Garibaldi, andthere he brought to life Ferdinando,King of the two Sicilies and Jerusa- lem, Infante of Spain, Duke of Parma,of Piacenza, of Castro, and hereditaryGrand Prince of Tuscany, that prepo- sterous but sensible Italian whom thelazzaroni of Napoli called " II Re Na- sone " King big Nose #\The genius with which Dumas bringshim to life is one of the things weshall never cease to marvel at : — howdoes he do it ? how can this being bemade to move, to walk right out intoour room, and exist for us as he exi- sted in realty. For he is real and notmade up. He is preposterous ; yet heis likable, and admirable. He has mostof the faults of a poor king and thequalities of a perfect one — He is, infact, a king.Most novelists give us less than apoor actor does when playing the part.All else in the book, good as it is,fades by the side this brilliant creation. There slops Emma Hamilton, andthere stalks Nelson : Lord Acton lookspoisonous and Queen Caroline daggers.These are not fortunate enough to bemore than sketches ; yet put any one ofthem into either of the two works bydu Boisgoby and our attention wouldbe rivetted on these figures and weshould take them to be alive. It isbecause Ferdinand is a round littlemasterpiece that the others become flat.Du Boisgoby does not create anyfigure at all worth while in his my- stery tales, but he is readable. Notso readable as Bennett with his " GrandBabylon Hotel ", or Chesterton withhis " Man who was Thursday ". Whatfirst class entertainers are these twothrillers! As good as either, to mythinking, is A. E. W. Mason's " TheHouse of the Arrow Mason doesn'tdisappoint; " The Winding Stair "...."The Villa Rose "....Yes. I like Mason.But I am forgetting that it is duBoisgoby I am supposed to say I like;and, if you don't give me Mason, Ches- terton, or. the author of " The Cap- tive of Love du Boisgoby will do.

As it is, the repertorysystem acts as a spook to us or seems tobe too stupid a thing and too ordinaryfor any English theatre manager tocomprehend.Well, it is of no use wasting moretime in talking about that: it's all beentalked in and out of existence;—let itgo then, and let us read these excel- lent plays without further regrets.The newer school of English play- wrights, to which Mr. Hughes belongs,is on the right road. It is concernedwith plays which are plays, not playswhich are Sermons or Debates orDrugs or Propaganda. Questions seemno longer to teaze the younger drama- tists. What a blessing. We reallyare getting on at last. Woman takes her place in these new dramas insteadof being put up in a pillory for theDramatist to throw oranges at her orto flatter her " good-fellow "-ship.Yes, indeed we are getting on. Orrather, Mr. Hughes and the others aregetting us on, so good luck to themone and all. AN ITALIAN DICTIONARYby Alfred Hoare.

MAGAZINES. THE " Theatre Arts Monthlycontinues to do as well as ever;indeed better, since it is giving usmore information of American theatres of the last century, and abstaining fromtoo much speculation about the newmovement in Europe.But for all this Mr Macgowan hasa fling at that movement in a recentnumber and the fling fails.He supposes that this New Move~ment was started and planned for ashort run. He lives in a land where(so I hear) a house of ten stories isoften built to last but a year and tobe swept away and another built onits site, and this, second, house in itsturn is broken up for a third to beraised, and all this in the space ofeight or nine years.Much as we must all adore Ame- rica we never cared a straw for thatsort of thing. And so Mr Macgowanis wrong to suppose that anyone inthe year 1925 can sum up the resultsin America of the seed sown in 1900,The results will be seen, I shouldguess, about the year 1960 or 2000.The amiable writer manifests hisway of seeing things wrong by clai- ming that the old Park Theatre,New York, of 1805 44 might havedelighted Palladio, Inigo Jones andCopeau in equal measure Whetherit delights Copeau remains to be dis- covered; but no one who knows any- thing of the work of Palladio andJones can have a moment's hope thatit would have given these men anythingbut excrutiating delight of a ribald kind.Appia and Craig it seems, accordingto Macgowan, are not doing as theyfondly suppose they are, but they havebeen for years 44 fighting the battle ofrealism against artificiality ".If we did not hold that Mr Mac- gowan had done some good service tothe New Movement we should puthim down as a bit of an ignoramusand a very sleepy fellow. The factis, America hustles him along witlFsomemillions more of its good boys and true,and he is not allowed the time to stopand think twice or three times over amatter—or, say, seven or eight times.In Europe it is still customary to givemost of the time to thinking so as tosee and to understand, and a few hoursto the writing down the conclusions.In America three minutes are al- lowed for thought and one glimpse ispermitted, and then copy has to beready by six o'clock the same evening.Always bear this in mind when rea- ding the 44 Theatre Arts Monthly "and you'll never bear a single one ofthe boys any ill will:—but, if you failto remember it, its ten to one you'll growwaxy as did St John Ervine, or, worsestill, contemptuous like some of hisbetters. i 44 Ah ! but the potentialities of Ame- ' rica—think of the potentialities " saysthe American.; Potentiality is possession of dominantpower, possibility of action, and Ame- rica is not holding back anything; nothing' is allowed to lie dormant : all is exploi- ted the moment it has been netted : to■ net it, to bag it, the young fellows comeover to Europe, and, as 44 The Lite- rary Digest " puts it, 44 ransack Eu- rope on a Harvard travelling scho- larship ". Exactly. Ransack Europe—and take back nothing in a bag.No, dear and much admired Ameri- cans, not so will you ever come to ownthe right to boast proudly that your landhas Potentialities. Your own Whitmanhad potentialities when he was thirtyand he had done it by himself and bywaiting. He absorbed all he couldAsiatic and European—but he absor- bed more that was in the trees and lakesof his own land. Then he wrote a poem,his 44 Song of Myself ", and becameWhitman, not Tennyson-and-water.WE stick to it.... 44 The Reviewof Reviews " is one of the veryfew illuminating journals issued. ItsAmerican version and the other ver- sions of the same notion are the othersthat make up the few things to whichwe refer. For here at a glance livefolly of the majority is revealed, andas a rule the minority is made to lookas foolish.It is only in the 44 Review of Re- views " that we can see that whileone half of England howls downMr. Churchill, the other half howlsdown the last three or four Chancellorsof the Exchequer, whoever they maybe; while the Premier is exe- crated seemingly by 44 everyone " today,every other one execrated the latePremier yesterday. So everyone isbeing howled down.Sides cease to exist in the 44 Reviewof Reviews " for all are laid flat. It'slike Punch and Judy. Punch alonerules supreme. Be the governors po- werful or vacillating, cruel or kind,all's one—they are all wrong.The majority must chatter, musthave its way, must pull down, break,spoil and cry for the moon.This the 45 Review of Reviews " re- veals as no other journal ever has re- vealed, for it extracts all the howls, andof course all the praise where it canbe found, from all the journals andthese it reprints. Every man is exa ted—Rulers alone, whoever they be, aredegraded—not by the Review of Re- views, for that Review has a ruler too,but by the Laws of Democracy. EDITORIAL NOTES. OUTBURST IN BBOAA—BOMB—K—a ■ ■■■ rk RNINRMWI I w~m r IIW m 1111——«C»BIWHEN Mr. St. John Ervine, inhis famous speech delivered atthe Authors' Club on October 22nd1923, declared that we in Englandwere passing through a period of tran- sition from masculine feminine, anddeteriorating too, he was obviouslyrude but probably right: when he ad- ded that owing to feminine predomi- nance tragedy vanished and its placewas taken by comedy, he was growingrather more polite and a little vague :but, by the time he had wound up bysaying that if the writers wanted toget the world back on to decent linesthey had to start off with the gloomiestpossible view of it, he had descendedto the honied small talk of the draw- ingrooms and was utterly wrong.Writers do not get the world back ;—if writers do anything with the worldthey fan it or poke it as it goes for- wards on its own career. It is muchto be one of the world's lacqueys,outrunners, or pages, and the artists,writers and acrobats are all just aboutthat.Mr. Ervine is rather like that ladyof the other day who, at the end ofthe second act of " Fallen Angels "stood up in a box at the Globe Thea- tre, London and said that, as a mem- ber of the British public she protes- ted.. ; at which the other nine hun- dred and ninety-nine members of thatBritish public broke in more rudelyand said 4# sit down ".It was not a man, you note, whorose up and protested against the co- medy as Mr. Ervine would have ussuppose : on the contrary, a man didrise up later from a stall afcd remarkthat he had come to the theatre to beamused and that he 'did not relishhaving his amusement interrupted inthe ladylike Ervine way. But the ladyhaving blundered, (just like Ervine)blundered on and said she wasn't goingaway and that what she thought ofNoel Coward was..., at which her voicewas drowned by the nine hundred andninety nine British Publicans male andfemale, and no one noticed if she did or didn't 44 go away ". She wouldhave been a fool not to.We haven't seen 44 Fallen Angels ",and we have not read it though aw- fully keen to read it now. Nor havewe heard what it's about; or whethergood, bad or indifferent : but we haveseen and heard too many ladies inLondon protesting. Some protest quietly,but we prefer the Ervine kind. Ofcourse it's a bit vain to up and tella whopper openly, but it shows a bitof Ervinism. Honest honest Ervine, hereally is a very proper sort of a duf.fer: whereas the other kind of ladywho protests quietly, damning thingsin the meanest way, is the lady welike least. She'll not say out that itsa damnable play, be it by Coward,Maugham or Ervine. She'll say theauthor smells; or 'tis a pity he's sodirty; or that he has no windows inhis house. We know of two celebra- ted ladies (one is now dead,... had apublic funeral too : the other may haveone) who both attempted to damntwo artists (one of them our bestplaywright) in the way we state. Thisis why we rather admire old Ervineand the protesting lady of the Globetheatre.But all of them, all these theatre goingcritics, have the wrong notion in theirhead. They go to see a play in thewrong way. The only way to go isfor an evening's amusement or refresh- ment ; and the sole way to do this isto go there passively, leaving any senseof one's own importance and all one'sown fixed ideas at the box-office withone's 10/6.Protesters are not the public andare generally dead-heads; they get tic- kets somehow for nothing. 44 The pu- blic " is no one but he who pays; andhe who pays, unless he is a fool, isnever going to a theatre to protest. Wealways pay for our tickets, and whenwe don't enjoy the comedy, well, thedisappointment sharpens us up. Besides,there is generally something good inevery evening's entertainment, and itis folly to annoy oneself or one's fel- low theatre-goer during the evening.The dramas written today are goodor bad in as much as the conditionsgoverning us are good or bad.At least so it seems to us; and, ina letter received on this very pointfrom M. Francois M. Florian. (dated44 September 1st, at the hour of 11. 45between Vilvoorden and Bruxelies")he would seem to agree with us. Hesays; 44 if you don't like the kind ofplays a country produces you mustchange the conditions prevailing in theland if you want better "; and he continues: 44 That is * how it seems to44 me as I wander from city to city.44 Half my life is spent in a second- 44 class compartment of a French, Ita- 44 lian or German train, and I must44 say I prefer your English trains and44 their third class carriages. But Iam44 never going to grumble at the others....441 pay my 153 lire or my 73 francs44 and thank the directors with a full44 heart whenever I hear that old cry44 44 Premier Service ". The Train44 game and the Theatre game are44 alike in this, that one must ' play44 the game ' as you say in both ca- 44 ses. Ervine and that lady and the44 other ladies you wrote me of are44 playing some other game—la crosee44 may be ". BRITISH OPERA. IN our last issue we voiced the sen- timent of many millions of Briti- shers ; ie, that British Opera should beBritish and be damned to the foreignstuff, till it was more British.Professor Nicoll voices a fine mino- rity of folk who believe Art to be In- ternational (0.What we said was not that the Bri- tish National Opera Company does notperform one British Opera, but doesperform too many foreign Operas.If it performed Purcell and Macken- zie and Sullivan and Delius and a do- zen others—Dent, Shaw, Bantock—allof them, we should not have blamedit for taking such a name as the Bri- tish National Opera Company.Professor Nicoll avoids the point.Who objects to Rossini, Bizet, Wag- ner, Debussy and the others. Theirworks are adorable—but they must notflourish, and be flourished by us, tillthe operas of Britishers are also beingproduced. All of us would then wel- come the foreign work. Why must wein England have Wagner plus Reinhardtforced on us and not be allowed tohave Purcell plus Craig as a pre- lude ?Mr. Smith has touched on this ten- dency in his Reply in these columnsthis quarter (2). We wish England wouldrouse up and do more than merelytouch on it :—we wish that the Presswould bring it home once and for allto the English people that they arebeing cheated of our best artists, boththe dead masters and their living fol- lowers, (1) See page 163-4.(2) See page 164-6. MISREPRESENTATION*' Vous I'avez voulu, vous Tavez voulu,Georges Dandin ".WELL now, who'd have thought it.It appears that Gordon Craig'sschool has 44 sought to make the actor44 more remote, masking him, robbing44 him of personality, so that he should44 seem isolated, a creature a different44 birth At least that is what 44 TheLabour Monthly recently asserted.That interesting publication knows agood deal.... same as hundreds of 44 La- bour " folk, — whatever 44 Labour " is.We too have laboured, and yet wecannot bring ourselves to feel isolated,and 44 Labour " is only an awfully iso- lated thing if it stands itself aloof fromall other things. To be so stern aboutit, to feel that a special name—ie La- hour—is needed to denote what wealways supposed was a little universe!and everyday act, strikes us now andagain as rather far fetched.To be remote, to rob the actor oftrue personality, is the last notion toappeal to the Gordon Craig School,of that we are quite sure. So M. E.of the Labour Monthly must give usanother chance if he feels like it,and give another guess. This one waswrong. In the age when men werenearest to the ideals of Socialism, ac- tors were masked. Not to make themaloof—remote—isolated, but solely fora technical reason. It makes for mud- dled thought to feel as M. E. feels.But then a good Conservative inEngland would also object to a mask- ed actor; or to a really good actorwere he masked or not. A Liberalwould agree with the Conservative andthe Socialist here. In fact very fewmen if they get tied up to a politicalparty can cut away from it all at thesensible moment and revel in Theatri- cals, and so they miss very much.All thought of party in a playhousebrings there a host of suspicions.44 He is doing this for a reason "murmurs the Citizen Smith: Sir M,E. Smith is equally sure of that too—but for the opposite reason Wil- liam Mc. Black-Smith, the judge,is positive of it and the other Smithsdisagree with all these and hold totheir opinion which is that there's amotive behind that Mask—a fell pur- pose hidden behind this backcloth, andthose pink lights mean a certain lossof votes at the next election. All ofwhich is fiddle-faddle. Artists are notclever like that—they can do a bit intheir own line but that's not the line.They hold very few views and sel- dom an opinion—except on technical matters, and they strive to enjoy them- selves in their work and give pleasure, And this they often succeed in doing. Why should our good friend M. E. go for the Gordon Craig School when the Gordon Craig School only has one aim, to do some good work—do it well —and to give some pleasure ? It s a pity. But then hundreds of folk in England are for ever going for things about which they are mistaken, They have that smallest of passions— the passion for trying to bring us all up—to form us after their own like- ness. Fearful loss of time—absurd path to wander in and get lost. And so we have no Theatre in England. Everyone wants it to be as he wants. Ask him what it is he wants and he can't give a sound ans- wer. Yet he wont have Craig—he won't have Barker; he won't have anything except what he wants. And so that's all he gels. Isn't it time for them to sit quiet for a bit—and let the artists give the Public their best ? The artist can do that but he can't do more : and while everyone of the publicis giving an opinion in the different Dai- lies, Weeklies and Monthlies, the artistcannot even begin to give you his best.After all, what he knows he cangive you must be rather better thananything you can think of for yourselves;but there of course you don't agree,And your opinion is of more value toyou than his art :—well then have andhold to your opinion. But don't ask forthings to be better—for now they areprecisely as you wanted them, GeorgeDandin. A SYMPOSIUM REPLY. J. S. Diagram I. Diagram 2.

Hugh Walpole, writing to "TheTimes ", informs us that owingto the Russian Revolution, the solesurviving member of the Dostoevskifamily, Miss Aim6e Dostoevski, is leftwithout resources and that she is ill inSwitzerland. Russia did not enter theCopyright Convention till Dostoevski'sworks had been translated into al- most every European language, so thegreat writer's family never received apenny from these European and Ame- rican translations —and we know howfew pennies he received for his works inhis own Russia and how he was dri- ven to his writing. Anyhow some two years ago a fundwas started in Switzerland by friendsand admirers of Miss Dostoevski, butthe fund was exhausted last August.Mr. Walpole informs us that 44 thesmallest sums contributed to this fund,addressed Dostoevski Fund, C/o Comp- toir d'Escompte de Geneve, Rue duSimplon, Vevey, will be thankfully re- ceived and acknowledged". We havesent a small sum and we hope thatone or two of our readers who haveby chance not seen 44 The Times"letters will send along too; — for,if they can believe it, these i requestsare sometimes not responded to asquickly as one would suppose.Something comes in between the impulse and the deed and nothing isdone.So in remembrance of the great writer BHEBODBHMHHKaSI§®j Ltd ❖ANNOUNCEA NEW BOOK by GORDON CRAIGBOOKS &amp; THEATRESWith about thirty Illustrations#This delightful volume contains a collection of Essays about books in general and thetheatre in particular, told with the freshness and charm which characterised the author'sWoodcuts and Some Words.
