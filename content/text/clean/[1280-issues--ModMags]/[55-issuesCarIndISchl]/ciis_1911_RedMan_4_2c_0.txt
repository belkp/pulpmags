Indian boys and girls love the open air. They thrive when they ride and work on the plains or camp in the solitude of our great forests. The Indians are Nature's own children. Tbe movement for open air school work is not new. Such schools have been in successful operation in the large cities of this country and have had extensive introduction abroad. In a word, the open-air cru- sade concerns itself with the physical needs of school children. It is a most serious matter when the schools to which our children go contribute to weakened vitality and an undeveloped physique. The open-air school- room makes for wide-awake recitations, alert children, attentive pupils and interesting sessions. More studying is done in less time and much more is retained. The teaching is vitalized, the pupils are contented and quit shunning the school, and the teachers feel more in love with their work because of its exhilaration. Dr. Watt, the author of this interesting and valuable article, is one of the pioneers for open-air schoolrooms. He was fot years principal of tbe Graham School in Chicago where the best results have been obtained. He is now giving his entire time to tbe work. The article should be read by every official of the Indian Service, ft is the last word of an authority, and that there is need, in the Indian Service, to heed what is said, every official will admit. Let us give the Indian children more fresh, pure air so that when their education in books and industry is com- plete, they may bave strong bodies to help them apply their education to tbe difficult problems of life.—The Editor. OME remarkably important discoveries in science have given educators new light on the business of teaching and learning. There is much more in the atmosphere than was suspected ten years ago. A finer knowledge of the atmosphere has been brought to bear on the business of the school, and results already obtained indicate that a great increase in efficiency for teacher and learner is easily within reach.48 fteb iflan, bp 3&eb iHen A few words regarding what is known now regarding the air will make it easy to understand how certain forms of air treatment have doubled efficiency in many pupils, helped school discipline, obviated dullness and stupidity, and made the school room a more lively and cheerful place. Our text books generally tell us that the air consists of oxygen and nitrogen in the proportion of about one to four by bulk with a few other substances of little importance unless the carbon dioxide present is too great in proportion to the rest. The old fallacy that carbon dioxide is a poison has been exploded and few books in use now state that it is a poison. Dr. Ira Remsen states that it is no more a poison than pure water. One may be asphyxiated in it but not poisoned. And yet reference books in every library refer to carbon diox- ide formerly known as carbonic acid gas, as a poison in the air and articles on ventilation usually state that air is dangerous when more than four parts in 10,000 of it are carbon dioxide. It has been shown that good pure air with pure carbon dioxide to the amount of 400 parts to the 10,000 does not harm those who breathe it for a long time. As no school room is liable to accumulate carbon dioxide to the amount of 400 parts to 10,000, we may feel sure that the bad air of the school is caused by something else. Live Air and Dead Air. The books generally tell us that the oxygen in the air sustains life and the nitrogen does nothing for us. We know now that oxy- gen does much more for us than to sustain life, and that nitrogen does not go into our lungs and out again without beneficent results. Natural, outdoor air has in it a finer oscillation than was known ten years ago This oscillation was suspected, but it is only in re- cent months that the electric character of atoms, the magnetic qual- ities of air and the action of electrons have been demonstrated be- yond doubt It is but recently, too, that we have come to know something definite about the short rays of sunlight, the emanations o	radium in natural air, and the highly interesting and surprising oscillations which arise from various sources and may bespoken of in the aggregate as radioactivity. Although these things are recent contributions to our scientific®J)c £et> itlan, bp &eb itlen 49 knowledge and are so important as to constitute a new science, finer than chemistry because showing much finer divisions of matter than atoms, there is a mass of new learning regarding natural air that has come to light within the past few months. To the ordinary chemist oxygen is 02 and ozone is 03. As there is little ozone present in a school or a dwelling, he ignores ozone and treats of 02 only. Now it happens that there are at least eight kinds of particles in oxygen that is partly ionized. The list given by Sir J. J. Thom- son of the Cavendish laboratory of Cambridge University is as fol- lows-. (1)	Ordinary molecular oxygen, 02. (2)	Neutral atoms of oxygen, 0. (3)	Atoms of oxygen with one positive charge. (4)	Atoms of oxygen with two positive charges. (5)	Atoms of oxygen with one negative charge. (6)	Molecules of oxygen with one positive charge, 02. (7)	Ozone with a positive charge, Os. (8)	Os with a positive charge. Now I cannot take space to tell you that Professor Thomson is a leader in the world’s advance and his data perfectly reliable. His list does not by any means tell you what is in the air you breathe. It gives merely part of what some oxygen is. There are in the oxygen and the nitrogen we breathe many forms of gas which carry into our lungs positive and negative farces, separated finely for definite purposes. There are also other things besides impurities, microbes, etc., which influence our lives powerfully. There are particles much finer than atoms in these gases. They possess tremendous energy and power to pass through other matter. Nothing is hard enough to resist them. 1 hey are smaller than atoms and molecules, and shoot through them without being in the least impeded or diverged. A particle of radium emanation darts through steel as if it were mere fog. The alpha particles cut through the heart of a moun- tainous atom at the rate of 10,000 miles a second. Whenever one of these extremely minute particles passes through an atom it ener- gizes it. It gives it rapid motion. It makes it positively or nega- tively magnetic, depending on the element as to which,I hese magnetized atoms are electrons, metabolons, or ions. 1 he atoms of oxygen and nitrogen in the air of out-doors are ex- posed to continuous bombardment by radium emanations and other radioactive agencies. Many of its atoms are thus energized from the greatest source of power in the universe. Professor Eve of McGill University has counted the emanating particles in the air. In one cubic centimeter of good natural air he finds an average of 600 of these. They are furiously darting about and imparting life to the mixed gases which we call air. Air thus energized is live air. It has a profound effect on ani- mal life. We consume oxygen in our lungs—a little to maintain life. But I believe we get our vitality, efficiency, going power, re- sistance to disease, indefatigability, and other desirable possessions, both physical and mental, from both nitrogen and oxygen. When they are energized we are energized. When they lose their fine oscillations we are weak, dull, sick. Heating the Air Destroys Its Energy. 1 he least rise in temperature cuts down the magnetic power of outdoor air. A great roasting of air, such as goes on against the red-hot sides of a heating furnace or in the hot radiators of a steam- heated building, kills the air. Dead air breathed will sustain life in a slow, dying way. But it does not sustain vigor, efficiency, and resistance to chill and dis- ease. When we lose resistance some sort of illness ensues. This order is common: weariness, a cold, tuberculosis or pneumonia death. Vital Air for Schools. The school is hurt when weariness enters. When the instruct- or is tired the work is not at its best. When the student is weary his study is more or less futile. It is possible to study long hours daily in pain and weariness and know less after a year of such work than was known before. There are students who know things to-day which they did not know last year, but their actual knowledge is less now than then. With sufficient weariness one may study arduously and gradual- ly know less and less by loss of part of what was at first possessed. In most schools there are dunces. They are the butt of class merriment and the despair of instructors. Often they are tortur-®f)e fteb itlan, bp &cb itten 51 ed with sarcasm and scolding, but any spur given them is liable to drive the ability to study out and fill the mind with thoughts of re- sentment and morbidity. A student has a right to be lazy and stupid if compelled to breathe air devoid of energy sustaining qualities. He should not be roused by any harsh measures. The conditions for his success should be afforded and then mild assistance will become effective. The greatest help in education is the coupling of the body with the source of natural energy. This is to be done through the nose and through the skin. I shall not speak of the skin here, for the limits of this paper prevent treatment of the subject of breathing in more than a brief, sketchy manner. 1 have directed the work of several thousand students in air more natural than that of the average school and have seen some wonderful physical results as well as mental and moral ones. In the Graham school in Chicago when we humidified the air and low- ered the temperature of the rooms about ten degrees the office dis- cipline was cut down about 80 per cent. This means that the hot, dry air of the school before that time was responsible for four-fifths of the friction in the rooms which was so serious as to require help from the principal. After testing the results of humidity and lower temperatures and of open-air school work, I wrote a book on “Open Air” with a view to telling just what we had done and how others may get similar results. Many schools have since copied the work, although in some of them the ventilating system is such that 1 have been obliged to give specific directions. In some instances the book has been read so carefully that success has followed and a great relief experienced. One superintendent reported an increase in efficiency amount- ing to ten per cent within twenty-four hours. Hundreds of edu- cators came to the Graham school to see the work. In some cases failure to grasp details or follow directions prevented success. Using Cold Air. It is dangerous to chill a room down to less than 66 degrees Fahrenheit without properly humidifying. It is dangerous to let cold air from outdoors pour upon stu- dents in a very dry room. One should not expect to enjoy a cold room at once after being52 i\eb iflan, bp fteb Jfflen weakened by the ordinary dead, dry air of school. And yet visitors have entered our cool rooms, exclaimed over their delicious air, and asked us why we cared for cool air when “this room is so plea- sant”. 1 hey had not seen the thermometer. A moderate degree of coolness will be appreciated by any well person at once if the air is vital and right as to humidity. A room at 62 degrees is as warm in feeling when rightly hu- midified as it is at 72 when very dry. It takes 25 per cent less fuel to warm a room or a building to 62 than to 72. There will be a great saving in coal when schools are adjusted to this great econo- my. But the matter of money saving is a bagatelle in contrast with what good, vital, humidified air does for culture, growth, health, strength, and saving lives. From the use of cool air we proceed to the use of what I call “warm open air”. 1 hat is air that has been warmed somewhat but which has in it enough humidity and some of the radioactive part- icles and atoms which are ordinarily killed off by heat. Saving Lives in School. After an address on this subject in a parents’ meeting in Chi- cago, I noticed among the throng who came to the front to ask questions as to what to do in their homes, a women who said she wished to see me privately regarding her son. But as we were leaving the building some time afterwards I could not find her. She had gone. But she was at my office in the morning and the boy with her. A poor widow with her only child, a big boy with a badly scarred neck. Swollen glands had often opened there. He said the physi- cian had "cut off quite a lot of the flesh so it wouldn’t look so bad.” 1	he poor boy had never been able to attend school through any term. He was far behind boys of his age. He could not learn easily. He became ill whenever he entered school and his glands enlarged. He had found relief at night by sleeping in an open window in a sort of tent he.had invented, using a clotheshorse to support a sheet over himself so he could be practically in the open air without making the house too cold. He wished to try school in an open-air room. I welcomed him, showed him how to get a permit and transfer, and told him I was sure he could attend my school and learn rapidly. I assigned him)t &eb itlan, bp &eb &ltn 53 at first to a closed room with its cool, humidified air, telling him it was not what I wanted for him physically but that the teacher was the one I wished him to have. The class was two years ahead of his grade. But the teacher was kind, cheerful, and specially winning to boys who were dull or ugly. I explained this to Harry and told him he would find some big boys in the room who were as backward as he. But I asked him to come at once to me if he felt at all ill or a gland should swell. He remained in that room several weeks, doing advanced work and catching up rapidly. He was not ill a minute and he missed no school time that winter. He was transferred to an open-air room later and was happy as ever a boy could be. He gained in weight, strength, knowledge, and health by studying in vital air. Open Air for Disease. Tuberculosis is treated in open air. Pneumonia is now cured in rooms with windows removed. Nervous debility yields to fresh air treatment. In our open-air kindergarten over loO little chil- dren escaped all the so-called children's diseases last year, not one case of measles, whooping-cough, mumps, scarlet fever, chicken pox, diphtheria, or pneumonia being developed, although some of these children were compelled to remain at home because other members of their families had contagious diseases. The feeling of weariness which many persons have continually is overcome in right air. Susceptibility to draughts passes away so that one enjoys a current of air day or night. One becomes immune to coughs and colds by living in right air. Such air is cheap. It costs far less than the air usually afforded in schools, homes, offices, churches, and public buildings. It means health, cheer, strength, alertness, efficiency, and life wherever it is applied. The whole subject of ventilation of schools is to be readjusted. We are paying out good money for what is called sci- entific ventilation and getting in return slow torture, stupidity, dis- ease, and death.Hospital Management and the Train- ing of Indian Girls as Nurses: By A. R. Allen, M. D.' HE methods used for the care of the pupils of the Carlisle Indian School have been the outgrowth of suggestions of the many excellent physicians in charge of the school since its inception in 1879. At first these methods were crude, but by careful prun- ing and addition and the latest and most approved practice, the hospital, sanitary and health supervisions are down-to- date in every respect. In view of the importance of health and sanitation in relation to Indian welfare, this article, descriptive of actual conditions and things done, has been prepared. At present, every pupil, on admission to the school, is given a complete physical examination, and the results are noted on a card index kept in the physician’s office. If any defects are noted, and they are not serious enough to render him incapacitated for active study and work, steps are at once taken to eliminate the trouble. Those that come disabled are returned to their homes. These physical examinations are made from time to time and at least twice yearly—when reporting for the Outing System and when they re- turn to the school at the end of the outing season. Since February, 1911, monthly weighings of the individual pu- pil has been in vogue. This weighing shows in a general way the physical condition of the pupil. If the weight is at a standstill or there is a loss, a physical examination reveals the cause of the failure to gain, or of loss of weight. As this weighing is done monthly and the records kept, a comparison can be made in a few seconds and cases of incipient tuberculosis or other serious illness discovered that might otherwise escape observation for a much longer time. Health Safeguarded Under Outing. When the pupils are sent out under the Outing System, the patron is furnished with blank forms that are to be filled out and returned to the school hospital every two months. These forms contain questions relating to the presence of cough, the condition of the eyes and eyelids, and the weight of the pupil. In cases of illness, a doctor’s certificate is required, and in serious cases an *Dr. Allen is Visiting Physician in ctuuge ol the Carlisle Indian School hospital, Stlriteon-ln-cbief to the Todd Hos- pital ol Carlisle, and Member ol the Boaid ol Medical Examiners ol the State ol Pennsylvania.—Editor.AIK AND EFFICIENI EDUCATION—POURTH-GRADERS STUDYING IN OPEN AIR AIR AND EFFICIENT EDUCATION—FIRS I—GRADE CHILDREN DOING CONSTRUCTION WORK IN OPEN AIRAIR AND EFFICIENT EDUCATION—MR.

By means of this form, the school physician is kept in touch with the pupil and the general physical condition is known. By die above mentioned means, a general supervision is kept of all the pupils in the school and a good working knowledge of the state of each individual pu- pil is known. Sanitary Inspection. Every Saturday sanitary inspection of the buildings is made and on the last Saturday of the month, a general inspection of the whole United States Indian School Hospital, CaditW. rinn.ihaaU. YtAft.

The resident physician is a member of these sanitary com- mittees and thus we have a knowledge that is up to date. At other times, when necessary, the visiting and resident physicians inspect conditions that need attention. From time to time, and at unexpect- ed meals, the visiting and resident physicians inspect the dining rooms and take meals there so that the condition of the food and cooking are kept up to the standard.

A longer time is de- voted when the number of students who need attention is greater. During this time, the resident physician, the head nurse, and the detail- ed pupil nurses are on duty to care for all cases that may need at- tention, the resident physician being in charge. The minor cases are attended to at once and the more severe cases are held over for more careful examination and retention in the wards for treatment, if necessary. Those that are sent to the wards are examined by the visiting physician on his daily arrival in company with the resident, and the treatment is outlined for the case. This treatment is en- tered by the head nurse in the order book for the guidance of the nurses, and entered upon the patient’s chart. The patient’s name, age, sex, date and diagnosis is then entered upon the hospital book, and if the case is a mild one, a small chart is made out and placed under the patient’s pillow; if a severe one, a Wilson temperature62 ®fje &eb iflan, bp &tb itlen MINOR ILLNESS CARD.

Infectious cases are isolated at once, and suspicious cases are also isolated until the diagnosis is finally made. In all serious cases, the blood, expectoration and urine are examined in the labora- tory which has recently been built and equipped; blood counts are made and smears taken. These are entered upon the proper charts. In cases of fractures, X-Rays are used and then a Roentgen Shado- graph is made and filed. Biological Laboratory. The laboratory is one of the most important additions to the hospital. Here all the necessary equipment is kept, and all need- ful examinations are made.

There is a blood counting apparatus for red and white corpuscles, and instruments to estimate the hemoglobin and blood pressure. We have found the laboratory very useful in our work, and while it64 &eti iflan, bp &eb iflen is not as complete as a modern hospital would want it, nevertheless, it is sufficient for our requirements at the present time. We have recently added to our equipment, a first-class eye case for refracting the eyes. This work has been done heretofore by an oculist in the town. This will be a great saving to the students, as the work of fitting them with eye glasses will be done by our own physician. We found the case was a necessity in the treatment of trachoma, as the record of the acuity of vision in each case was of value in the treatment of the disease. While these additions to the hospital equipment entail extra ef- fort, the results to the school prove their worth. We find, however, that one good innovation leads on to other improvements, and we have now added a filing case for the records of each case of illness. These are grouped in sections, and we thus have on file for imme- diate examination the record of each pupil’s illness with the notes and bedside records of the case during the entire school attendance. Monthly Weighings Important. The monthly weighings which have been mentioned are paticu- larly valuable as a means of compelling attention to the falling off in the general health of a pupil. Where the weight is stationary, or there is a loss, an immediate physical examination is made, and the blood and sputum examined under the microscope. If nothing is found, the patient is kept under observation, is made to sleep in the balconies at the hospital and put on a full diet with milk and eggs, and frequent physical examinations of the chest are made. Under this regime, if there is any disease present, it is found and at the same time the pupil is placed under the most favorable environment to regain his normal condition. We find that the balconies at the hospital are of the utmost value in these cases. A number of cases of tuberculosis have been arrested that were going rapidly to the bad, and while too early yet to be positive about the matter, yet we believe some have been cured. The bal- conies are a necessity in a school of this kind, and the good they have done for the pupils is hard to estimate. During the winter months the pupils that sleep on these balconies are furnished with woolen nightgowns, knit head and neck caps, and plenty of blankets so that no complaint of cold is ever heard. In fact, those who sleep out doors complain when they are moved to other quarters. These®fjc 3&fb iflan, bp &tb iften	65 balconies are placed on the two sides of the side wings of the first floor of the building and on the rear of the back building on the second floor, and comfortably accommodate eighteen boys and six66 ®})e &cl> iflan, bp fteb ittcn IAMB--------------------- Trlbt | |------SIM,--------------, /«..._ Age________________—-------years Respiration---------- Condition at, Bye*.. , --------- Height _______tt.—---------las.	1 Insp. ...................—	Ban..............—.....

The accompanying photographs give a good illustration of the bal- conies. I may say here that these balconies are also used in the treatment of the pneumonia cases with the very best results. Eradication of Trachoma. The arrival of Dr. Daniel White, the Government trachoma expert, at the school last fall, developed the fact that, while die gen- eral eyesight of the students was in excellent condition, some had trachoma, and after carefully considering the matter, we isolated all the infected pupils. These pupils had separate beds, towels, wash- stands, etc. After a complete examination was made, every case in the school was operated on. The pupils were taken to the hospital in small groups, and two operation tables were prepared for our use. After the operations they were then removed to the wards and ice cloths applied to the eyes and kept there from twenty-four to forty-eight hours until the reaction from the operation had les- sened. This method was kept up until all the cases were operated upon. Then, the after treatment was instituted. The pupil report- ed to the eye dispensary three times a week for three to five months. New cases coming into the school with this infection are operated upon immediately and the after treatment administered as above, until the conjunctiva is in a normal condition. All of these cases require refraction and the glasses must be changed from time to time as the eyes improve. We have found at this school that this treatment has materially improved the pupils’ sight and sore eyes are a rarity. This action has resulted in absolutely controlling trachoma in the school. Treatment of Appendicitis. From time to time it has been noticed that pupils are affected with appendicitis of a mild type, the greater number of cases being recurrent. In those cases that are recurrent, and in fact in every case that comes to the hospital, the situation is thoroughly explained to the student who generally writes home for permission to have the appendix removed, should it become imperative. These letters of permission are filed, so that if a severe case develops in these pupils, we can operate at once and under favorable circumstances. During the past year three cases have been operated upon with favorable®fje fteb illan, bp £tb iflen results. Our treatment in the hospital of these cases is to withhold, absolutely, water and food for forty-eight to sixty hours and place an ice cap over the appendix. The bowels are left severely alone until the attack begins to wane, when they are moved. If, in spite 1 I a* % i it TT I MT I !

HEALTH OUTING BLANK. of this treatment, the case does not improve, or is very severe in the beginning, an operation is performed. Pupils' Teeth. There is also an arrangement made with a leading dentist of Car- lisle whereby he visits the Indian School twice weekly, and takes care of the pupils’ teeth. This is an exceedingly useful as well as prophalactic measure in many ways, and 1 believe limits the ten- dency to tubercular adinitis, etc.70 ®fje &eb iflan, bp fceb iWen The dentist is greatly interested in this work at the school, and has proved a valuable acquisition to the medical staff. Indian Girls Make Successful Nurses. In the hospital there are employed from four to six of the pupils as nurses. These girls are given practical training in nursing, and receive two lessons a week in practical nursing and anatomy, and are taught how to keep the proper records and charts of the patients, etc. Since I have been in charge, I have been more than surprised at the adaptability of these girls. They make the best kind of nur- ses and are much better fitted for this profession than many of the white race. I have made a special effort to have hospitals in this state take them in their training schools, and have thus far had the following hospitals agree to receive them: Medical Chirur- gical, St. Josephs, Methodist Episcopal, Pennsylvania, German, all at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Lancaster General, Lancaster, Pennsylvania, and at present I am in correspondence with sev- eral others about receiving our pupils. We expect to send five or six of these girls each year to the different hospitals for train- ing, only allowing one girl to a hospital, as we find this works out more satisfactory to the school and to the hospital. Among the many former pupils of this school, Mrs. N. R. Denny, in charge of the Outing System, has furnished me the names of the follow- ing nurses and the results they have achieved. I have just had a re- port from the Lancaster General Hospital, Lancaster, Pa., stating that the present pupil nurse at that hospital is one of the most de- sirable pupils in training, states that they are willing to take another at any time we may desire to send one. Arrangements With City Hospitals. The visiting physician, owing to his wide acquaintanceship and his close association with the profession at large, has been able to make arrangements whereby the different hospitals of Philadelphia take care of;the more serious cases that cannot receive the desired operative or medical attention at the school hospital, with little and many times with no expense to the school. These cases have been cases of disease of the eye and a few serious surgical cases. They have been treated at the Medico-Chirurgical Hospital, University of Pennsylvania Hospital and the St. Joseph Hospital, of Philadelphia.®fje &eb iHan, bp £eb ifflen 71 Records of Nurses. Of the twenty or more Carlisle girls who have graduated as nur- ses I give the names of those who have made exceptionally good re- cords: Charlotte Harris, a Cherokee, and a graduate of the class 1902, Carlisle, al- so a graduate of the Jefferson Hospital, Philadelphia, has practiced in Philadel- phia and vicinity constantly since her graduation. She is making an excel- lent record. Alice Heater, Class 1905, Carlisle, also graduated from the Jefferson Hospi- tal, Class 1908. She also completed a post-graduate course in the Philadelphia Hospital for contagious diseases. tor two years after her graduation, she practiced in Philadelphia, earning $25 a week. Just a year ago, she went West and is now located in San Francisco, "where I have done equally as well as in Philadelphia,” she says. “I earn from $25 to $30 a week here. For a young woman who has to make her own living, I think she could not choose a better profession than that of a nurse.” Miss Heater’s record is excellent. Another Carlisle girl who is making a good record in her profession, is Estaiene Depeltquestangue, a Kickapoo Indian, who graduated from the Lake- side Hospital, Cleveland, Ohio. Immediately after her graduation she was placed in charge of one of the wards in the same hospital, which required much responsible work. Rose Nelson Van Wie, Class 1903, Carlisle, is another nurse, who, up until her marriage a few months ago, practiced her profession most successfully. She graduated from the City Hospital, Worcester, Mass. She is now loca- ted in Branford, Conn., where her husband is in business. Another Carlisle graduate, Class 1906, who has made a special success of her work is Mrs. Juliet Smith Twoax, now living at 2042 W. Erie St., Chicago, 111. She graduated from the Jefferson Park Hospital, Chicago, in 1909. After her graduation, she was for one year stationed at the Sycamore Hospital, in the *ame city, and was appointed head nurse at the end of the year. “I refused the position, as it would not pay me,” she states. “I never made under $25 a week and often received $35. I wish more Indian girls would take the course in nursing. I find it fascinating, uplifting and beneficial,” she enthusiastically adds in a letter to the superintendent. Sara Peirre, another Carlisle girl, is now assistant manager of a Convalescent Home in Portland, Oregon, and is making a splendid record. We find other Carlisle girls who have graduated as nurses located as follows: Theodora Davis is at the St. Joseph’s Hospital, St. Paul, Minn., making a good record. Lilian Wind, a graduate of the Training School for Nurses, Hartford, Conn., is still practicing most successfully in New England.72 Gftje l&eb iflan, bp &eb jHen Nancy Seneca, a graduate of the Medico-Chi Hospital, is now in the Indian Service at Rapid City, S. D. She has been in the service most of the time since her graduation. Elizabeth Wind Diven, her sister, graduated from the Methodist Hospital, Philadelphia, Pa., and has made use of her training to advantage. Hattie Jamison had her training at the Waterbury, Conn., Hospital and is now stationed at the Emergency Hospital, Warren, Pa., as is also her cousin Geneva Jamison, another Carlisle girl. Savannah Beck, another graduate, though she had no training outside of that given in our school hospital, is practicing in West Chester and vicinity and is making a most excellent record. Nancy Wheelock Williams, Zippa Metoxen Schanandore, Phebe Howell, Jennie Wasson Codding, Julia Long Rames, are other trained nurses who up until the time of their marriages were excellent nurses. Some of our best nurses have died. Nancy Cornelius, an Oneida, was the first Carlisle girl to get a nurse’s diploma. She was the pioneer Indian nurse and was most excellent in her profession. Katie Grindrod, a graduate of the Class 1889, Carlisle, and also of the Women’s Hospital, Philadelphia, was an excellent nurse during her lifetime. Seichu Atsye, the only Pueblo trained nurse, also graduated from the Women’s Hospital and did excellent work. Delia Randall graduated from a New Haven, Conn., Hospital and did good work. There are many other Carlisle girls who took partial trainings in different hospitals and made splendid use of their training.Bad Civic Conditions and a Remedy: By Wilson L. Gill, LL. B„ President of the Patriotic League, Supervisor at Large of Indian Schools. The Red Man is constructive in its attitude toward the Indian and his relation to the government. It substitutes optimism for pessimism. It seeks in its small way to be an influence for the uplift and improvement of the race rather than to find fault and to pull down the existing order. It encourages every movement in bebalf of the Indian which is sane, sim- ple of comprehension, and based on sound principles. The main work of Indian civilization is a question of education, but education without the goal of citizenship is like a ship without a rudder—it leads nowhere. Tbe School City, with which the article herewith deals, has been found a vital influence in connection with educational work, as carried on in our public schools for whites. It is gaining ground because of the perfection of the movement and its popularity. As a part of General Leonard Wood’s constructive policy while Military Governor of Cuba, Mr. Gill introduced it on a large scale among the Cubans during the period of American occupation, a few years ago. It has also been introduced in many of the largest schools in the country. The idea has been adopted by the government for inauguration in Indian Schools. The School City is a democracy based on kindliness and justice. We believe it is a step in the right direction and should be commended. Mr. Gill has been ap- pointed a supervisor of Indian schools with authority to work the matter out in Indian schools. He is just starting out on an extensive tour of Indian schools throughout the country, and the movement which he is fathering will make every school more effective where it is definitely and thoroughly established. The Indian is going through a transition period. In many places near reservations, town sites are being established. The Indians are be- ing elected to office and they must be taught the rudiments of government and the duties of the various offices. Aside from this practical benefit, the inauguration of the demoracy in the school is an advance step towards vitalizing the instruction and obtaining the sympathetic cooperation of the student body. The students thus become a real factor in the school's government.—The Editor. CONDITIONS in the cities of our country are not what they should be. For many years a large majority of all the college graduates through- out the United States have failed to attend primary meetings, to vote at local elections and to take their turn on juries; and the less-educated men have not been sufficiently instructed in regard to the principles of our American institutions to pre- vent their being constantly the prey of unscrupu-74 <El)e &eb iflan, bp &eb iWcn lous men in public affairs. Taxes are too high for the benefits re- ceived, and the very foundations of our institutions of liberty are shaken. Search for the Root of the Evil Led to Civic Discovery. In 1891 some of the most prominent men of our country organ- ized the Patriotic League for the purpose of discovering the root of the evils and to render such service as might be in their power to eradicate it. After several years of study and experiment they came to the conclusion that intelligent and efficient citizenship is a practical art, simple as it is, which cannot be taught by the old- fashioned academic method of the schools, and can be learned ef- fectively only by practice of the art itself. Laboratory Work in Citizenship. This discovery is simply in the line of progress which took the useless instruction in chemistry out of the academic classroom and has made it practical and valuable by work with chemicals in the laboratory, and that has set the law student studying cases, rather than giving up his whole time to text books and lectures. How the Principle is Applied. The process is both simple and interesting to the youngest pu- pils and oldest students. The pupils in each schoolroom are or- ganized as if they were citizens of a little city. They elect a mayor, president of the council and judge and other officers when they are wanted. All the pupils are members of the council or legislative assembly. Several school cities in one building are formed into a state. They are taught to make laws, to carry them into execution and to adjudicate all matters in dispute. Under instruction of their teachers, they actually govern themselves. They rapidly eradicate those forms of evil which are not easily reached by their teachers, but which greatly detract from the pleasures and value of school life. They are confirmed for life in the habits and character of in- telligent, unselfish, efficient American citizenship. Another Presentation of the Same Idea. New Arrivals from Other Countries. A vast new population from the south and east of Europe, with no antecedents to prepare them for successful citizenship in a de-FRONT VIEW OF SCHOOL HOSPITAL.

The ward politician has been the only means for training them for participation in our public affairs, and the results are disastrous to the spirit and prac- tices of true democracy. Sons of Revolutionary Sires. The descendants of the colonists have their memories stored with a great variety of information, and their wits whetted on mathe- matics, but after they have left the university, they will not, more than once or twice, attend primary meetings and local elections. They are out of reach of the heeler, but are eliminated from local politics. These conditions make “machine government” inevitable. Machine Governmetit Is Inevitable! When the only possible way to serve the public welfare seems to be through the existing “machine” form of government, it some- times happens, as we have seen in Philadelphia, that the most ex- cellent citizens enter the public service. We do not complain of our public servants, neither do we find fault with our citizens who will not vote, nor do we complain of “machine government” and “bosses.” These are but necessary results, not causes—they are but symptoms of the wrong. The root of the matter is what concerns us. Our people are trained in the schools and colleges to be subjects of government in which they have no part except to obey. Their habits and character in relation to government are by this means established and they are not responsible for it. They are, however, responsible for how the children of the present time are trained, and are not you one of those who are responsible for the future? There is a remedy, simple, scientific and effective. Citizenship Like Chemistry Cannot Be Taught Successfully Except by Laboratory Practice. For many years time and energy were wasted because of the false theory that chemistry could be taught by means of text-books, lectures and illustrative experiments made by the teacher. Now students learn chemistry while working with chemicals in a labora- tory. Even at the present time, school boards and the faculties of colleges and universities have failed to awake to the fact that80 )t &eb iWatt, bp 3R.eb iHen citizenship cannot be taught academically any more than chemistry can. Text-book civics without the practice of real, unfeigned citizen- ship is worse than useless, as it serves to blind those who are in- terested in the matter to the astounding fact that for ninety and pos- sibly ninety-nine per cent of all students, our educational institu- tions are doing absolutely nothing that will ever be availed of for the cause of citizenship or the defense of our American institutions in time of peace. Students have had no part in their own government except to obey. As a consequence of this, educated men, with comparatively few exceptions, will not perform their most simple and important civic duties, such as attending primary meetings and serving on juries. Because of this, democracy in America is not so great a success as it ought to be, and such failure of government of the people, for the people and by the people, as has been illustrated by the political scandals in Minneapolis, St. Louis, San Francisco, etc., is altogether too common. The Most Practical Means for Civic Education is Wasted. To make it possible to carry on the work of education, it is necessary that government should be maintained among all pupils from the kindergarten through the university. This necessary government which has been utterly wasted, so far as any education- al purpose is concerned, furnishes all the elements and the most perfect opportunity for laboratory work in citizenship. Econo- my and efficiency in the schools demand that this necessary ele- ment in school and child life shall no longer be allowed to go to waste. Utilize School Government for Civic Training. The School Republic or Children’s Commonwealth is the prac- tical application of this idea. The responsibility for maintaining order and right conditions is accepted by the young people. They are trained to make and enforce laws in relation to their own conduct, to elect their own legislative, executive and judicial officers and to perform the functions of citizens and of officers as effectually as chemists have been taught to handle chemicals. Many teachers in every part of our country are acting practical- ly on this knowledge, but except in a very few places, they have notme &eb Man, bp £eb Jflen 81 the authoritative support which they need to enable them to get best results and to make the work permanent in their schools. There is no more reason why the practical training in citizenship, which is but another term for morality, should be on a charity basis than training in mathematics. The object of the School Republic or Children’s Commonwealth movement is to induce school boards and legislatures to recognize this and to make adequate provision for introducing it into the schools and for supervision by those who have been especially and thoroughly prepared for this work. History and Present Status of the Movement. The first School Republic was in New York City in 1897. The New York City Board of Education authorized the use of the meth- od but did not require it or make any provision for supervision, without which there is no possibility of any successful general intro- duction of this or any other method in the schools of any city. Much publicity was given to the first experiment, both at home and abroad, with the result that some school republics have been organized in every State of our Union and in many countries in Europe, Asia, Africa, Australasia, South and Central America. Following the close of our war with Spain, Major-General Leonard Wood, the military governor of Cuba, desiring to illustrate to the adult population the meaning of true citizenship and at the same time have the children trained in the practice of it, appointed me general Supervisor of Moral and Civic Training for the Island of Cuba, where I organized its thirty-six hundred school rooms as School Cities. I proclaimed to the children the doctrine that there could be no true and successful citizenship except it should be based on that spirit of brotherly love which is expressed in the Golden Rule. They accepted this doctrine most eagerly, and cleaner physical and moral conditions followed instantly. This method was adopted by teachers in some of the Indian Schools. Dr. Charles M. Buchanan, seeing it in successful use in one of the day schools of which he was and still is the superintend- ent, and appreciating its educational and moral value, inaugurated the system in the large government boarding school at Tulalip, on Puget Sound, when it was opened in 1905. The results there have been so satisfactory that Mr. Valentine, Commissioner of In- dian Affairs, acting for the Government, in April 1911, appointed82 ®be &eb Jfllan, lip &eb ifleu me Supervisor of Indian Schools for the purpose of introducing the method into every Indian School. The teachers in the Indian Ser- vice accept the method most cordially and the young Indians re- spond to it heartily. In March, 1909, four special commissioners of education from Europe, South America and Japan, without knowledge of each other, wrote desiring to confer with me in the City of New York in refer- ence to school citizenship in their countries. I invited them to meet, and they did so a number of times. On the 3d of April they signed articles of agreement founding the Children’s International State with the view of developing civic and moral training in every country and cultivating international friendly intercourse and re- lations among all public school children. This has been sufficiently tested to demonstrate its practicability as soon as money shall be furnished from any source for clerical and other assistance to attend to it. Stories of the Serrano. Christiana Gabriel, Mission. Y GRANDMOTHER, a Serrano Indian woman, was born and raised under the shadow of the San Berna- dino Mountains. It was from her that I heard many stories about the curious customs, beliefs and super- stitions of the Serrano Indians. When I was a child I delighted in hearing her tell bear stories, or stories about the eagle; in fact any animal story. Both the bear and the eagle are considered quite sacred among the Serranos, and to this day the younger children are not permitted to speak of the bear except during the afternoon, because then the bears are asleep. It is said that if we speak an unkind thing about a bear in the morning or evening, the trees, or anything around where we say this unkind thing, will tell the bear and we would then meet the old bear somewhere the following day and perhaps be injured. The little horn-toad, it is said, is a grandfather of the rattlesnake; if you kill or tease the little horn-toad you will be bitten by his grandfather, the rattlesnake.Cbttor’si Comment AGRICULTURAL FAIRS AMONG INDIANS. THE second annual Cheyenne and Arapaho Indian Fair was held at Darlington, Oklahoma, during the lat- ter part of September, and from a com- phrehensive report which was made by the superintendent, it seems to have been a great success. The program was extensive, offering much that was interesting and valuable, besides pre- senting a substantial variety. There were races of different kinds, athletic contests, and a splendid exhibit. De- scriptive talks were given on sanitation and cleanliness and the prevention and cure of disease, particularly tubercu- losis. An interesting item of news is that the gate receipts were sufficient to pay all the premiums and operating expenses. The exhibit was composed of live stock and poultry, farming and garden products, cooking and sewing. The attendance was unusual, and the interest among both whites and Indi- ans was aroused to the highest pitch. The best of order was maintained. There was an absence of gambling, and not withstanding a bad crop year, the exhibits were of the highest order. Such fairs as this should be encour- aged among the Indians. They have been held at several places and suc- cess has attended the efforts of the superintendents and the progressive Indians wherever the exhibition has been tried. The Indian Fair on the Crow Agency among the Crow Indi- ans has been a great factor in the agri- cultural and industrial devolopment of these Indians. Many of the Indi- ans are taking hold of agriculture as a consequence, greater interest is being manifested in the work, and less idling done by the people. Among the Navajos at Ship Rock, New Mexico, a very extensive fair has been held for some years and thou- sands are each year attracted, because of the splendid exhibits and the inter- esting attractions. An excellent fair was held this year during the latter part of September among the Indians on the Fort Totten reservation, which has been reported a great success. The Indians themselves are evidenc- ing the greatest interest in the fairs in these and other places where they have been tried. They have gladly taken part by exhibiting their own sup- plies, produce and handiwork, and each year has shown better farming meth- ods, more sanitary living and greater progress toward civilization. The agri- cultural fair is a great aid in the de- velopment of any agricultural people, and the fairs among the Indians offer a splendid opportunity to the Govern- ment as an educational agency. YELLOW STAR. THERE has been published an Indian story entitled, "Yellow Star” by Elaine Goodale Eastman, the talented New England writer who knows the Indian so intimately and sympathetically. It is a story for young people but is equally interest- ing to the mature minds, and should84 ®ljt &et> illan, bp &eb Jfkn be read by both Indians and whites. "Yellow Star” is an Indian girl who is given the name of Stella after she had been adopted by a missionary in the Dakotas. Stella was picked up after the battle of Wounded Knee, and her Indian name is The-One Who-Was-Left-Alone. After the death of her husband, the widow of the missionary brought the girl to a New England village, where she at- tended school, became*the most popu- lar girl in the village, graduated from the academy, and won the hearts of both old and young by her beauty, in- telligence, and unselfishness. After completing her education in the East, she feels the call of her people and goes back to Dakota as a field matron. On the reservation, notwithstanding the difficulties in her way, both offi- cially and because of the opposition of some of her own people, she encour- ages them to better living, improves their sanitation and enlightens them in many of the ways of civilization. It is an interesting story, and Mrs. East- man tells it with directness and force and a sympathy which will tend to draw the two races closer together. In these days when the moving picture shows are showing pictures of frontier life which are mostly vision- ary and untrue, and which have the effect of throwing the Indian in an unwholesome light and arousing prej- udice against him, such books as Mrs. Eastman’s are a welcome addition to our literature concerning the Ameri- can Indian. The story presents some- thing of the difficulties in bringing the Indian to citizenship, but on the whole its tone is optimistic. The book is beautifully illustrated by Angel DeCora and William Lone Star, who teach drawing and native In- dian art at the Carlisle Indian School.

THERE is plenty of romance and adventure in “The Indian Book,” by William John Hopkins, to stir any healthy and full-blooded boy or girl with enthusiasm. Written in the style of “Once upon a time” the book deals with the habits, customs and history of the Mandan Indians who lived in the Missouri Valley. There are a number of stories delightfully told, de- picting conditions which, while they are seen no more because of the rapid progress and assimilation of the Indi- ans, are of historical interest to young people. The book is well written and the stories hold the attention. The volume is comphrehensively illustrat- ed from Catlin’s famous paintings of Indian scenes and characters.

On E of the Indians of the North- west, Attlu by name, has been awarded a medal by the Canadian Government for his proficiency in carving. He is considered one of the most famous carvers in wood, bone and metal in the Northwest. His work is widely sought and is done in typical Indian design.€x=S>tubente anb #rabuate£ John H. Miller, a Chippewa Indi- an, and a graduate of Class 1902, sends a very interesting and appreciative let- ter to the superintendent. He writes: "Your most welcome and encourag- ing letter was received sometime ago. I am certainly glad you think of us who are on the “firing line.” It is true, as you say, that the success of any school lies in its graduates. My trade at school was harnessmaking, and I had determined to follow the same trade after graduating. When I arrived home, I applied for work in a harness shop. I did not get it then, so I worked at what I could find to do. Two years went by before I was given a chance in that shop; then I was tried for a week and the work lasted nine months. When the work became slack, I was dropped. After a lapse of about one year, I was again hired by this same firm. I have now been in the same shop nearly five years. This harness shop is connect- ed with one of the finest hardware stores in Northern Michigan. I have sole charge of the shop, making all kinds of harness, from a very heavy harness to a very fine buggy harness. I have had offers to go elsewhere, but I am very well satisfied here in Elk Rapids, Mich. I shall always be one of Carlisle’s scouts.” Alice Heater, a Digger Indian, and a graduate of Class 1905, is now located in San Francisco, Cal., where she is still carrying on her noble work of nursing. She writes: “I graduated from Carlisle in March, 1905, and on April 1, 1905 entered Jefferson Medi- cal College Hospital in Philadelphia. I graduated from there on April 1,1908. My training at the hospital was general, including both medical and surgical cases. After completing three years’ training at Jefferson Hospital, I entered the Philadelphia Hospital for con- tagious diseases, where I completed a post-graduate course of six months in that special line of nursing. After finishing my course, I continued to practice my profession in Philadelphia. There I was very successful, earning $25 per week. Just a year ago, I came West and located in San Francisco, where I have done equally as well as in Philadelphia. For a young woman who has to make her own livelihood, I think she could not choose a better profession than that of a nurse. Aside from earning a fair salary, a nurse comes in contact with the better class of people, and she has the consolation of feeling that she may be of good serv- ice to humanity.” From Mary Brittain in Pala, Cali- fornia, comes a very interesting letter. Mary is a Mission Indian who return- ed to her home in June, 1909. We quote from her letter: “I was certainly delighted to receive both the Arrow and the catalogue. I would be happy if I thought I could again be a student at dear old Carlisle, but I fear I will never be more than a returned student. Since my return, I have been working until a few months ago, when I was taken ill. Then I lost my work and used up all the money I had saved.86 ®tje &eb itlan, bp fteb iWen I am much better now. I have worked for the same family ever since my re- turn from Carlisle. I tried to go to a night-school in San Diego, but my eyes gave me a great deal of trouble, so 1 had to give up my night-school. We are in the midst of our harvest season now. I send my greetings to my old Carlisle friends.” Mrs. Zippa Schenandore, nee Metoxen, an Oneida Indian, and a former student, writes to us from her home in Oneida, Wisconsin. She says, in part, as regards her training as a nurse while at Carlisle: “I think nursing is one of the grandest things for girls to know. I know I have never regretted that I studied nursing, although, after my graduation from the Connecticut Training School for Nurses, I nursed for only one year. Then household duties occupied my time. Now, I have a family of seven to care for and my training as a nurse is a great help to me. Two of my oldest children are in the Tomah In- dian School. I expect to send them to Carlisle when they are a little older.” Mrs. Juliette Smith Twoax, an Onei- da Indian, and a graduate of Class 1906, in a letter to the superintendent says: “1 wish more Indian girls would take the course in nursing. I find it fas- cinating, uplifting, and beneficial. I took my training as a nurse in Jefferson Park Hospital in Chicago, graduating in 1909. After graduating, I located in Sycamore, III., where I assisted with all the surgical operations, and also took in private cases. I never receive less than $25 per week and of- ten $35, and am kept very busy. I think Carlisle is doing wonders in up- lifting the Indians. Long may she live to continue her great work.” Mamie Hoxie, a Nomelaki from Round Valley, Calif., writes that she arrived home safely and since has secured a position in the same school withSarah, hersister, who graduated in the class of 1910. She says: “I am glad that I had the opportunity of at- tending school at Carlisle. I certainly do appreciate it now.” Mrs. Betty Wind Diven, a Wyan- dotte Indian, and a former student, graduated from the M. E. Hospital in Philadelphia, in 1894. She was assistant nurse at Carlisle and also at Salem, Oregon. She sends us a very helpful article on "The Art of Nurs- ing,” which will be published later. Ray Pedro, a Pueblo Indian, and a former student, is now located at Gallup, New Mexico. He says: “I am working on the Santa Fe Railroad, and earn about $65 per month. I am a married man now. My wife is an Albuquerque School girl and we are very happy in our married life.” Edward Fritz, a Shawnee and an ex-student, is now located at Vinita, Okla. He says, "Carlisle has done a great deal for me and I hope that I may be able to make a visit to Old Carlisle.” Mattie Parker Nephew, a Cayuga Indian, and a graduate of Class 1901, says: “I am always interested in the affairs of Carlisle, and appreciate the weekly Arrow very much.”tfjere in anp jop tfjat is gtoeeter tfjan tfjt con= gctoufines# of toorfe toeU bone, 3 fjabn’t fienfieb it. tEfje feeling of butp toeU performeb ifi tfje elixir of tfje gobfi.
