Author in his own person  NO man should stand before the moon To make sweet song thereon With dandified importance His sense of humor gone  Nay let him don the motley cap The jester s chastened mien If he would woo that looking glass And see what should be seen  O mirror on fair Heaven s wall We find there what we bring So let us smile in honest part And deck our souls and sing   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Yea by the chastened jest alone Will ghosts and terrors pass And fays and merry friendly things Throw kisses through the glass  THE SOUL OF THE GAMBLER  Where now the huts are empty Where never a camp fire glows In an abandoned canon A gambler s ghost arose  He muttered there The moon s a sack Of dust His voice rose thin I wish I knew the miner man I d play and play to win  In every game in Cripple Creek Of old when stakes were high I held my own Now I would play For that sack in the sky  The sport would not be ended there Twould rather be begun I d bet my moon against His stars And gamble for the Sun  WHAT THE MINER IN THE DESERT SAID  The moon s a brazen water keg A wondrous water feast   If I could climb the sands and drink And give drink to my beast  If I could drain that keg the flies Would not be biting so My burning feet be spry again My mule no longer slow  And I could rise and dig for ore And reach my fatherland And not be food for ants and hawks And perish in the sand  WHAT THE MOON SAW  Two statesmen met by moonlight Their ease was partly feigned They glanced about the prairie Their faces were constrained  In various ways aforetime They had misled the state Yet did it so politely Their henchmen thought them great  They sat beneath a hedge and spake No word but had a smoke A satchel passed from hand to hand Next day the deadlock broke   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  THE MOON IS COMPARED TO A CITY  What the Tired Reformer Said  The moon s a perfect city with Curved walls encompassed round With yellow palaces upreared Upon a glittering ground  Sometimes a disk a planet dead But on this splendid night When all the sky is shining clear When my whole heart is light  I think it is a place for friends My soul is there in mirth With golden robed good citizens Far from the dusty earth  Hail to the perfect city then I love your doors and domes Your turrets and your palaces Your terraces your homes  THE MOON IS A KNIGHT IN ARMOR  What the Soldier Said  Oh see the knight in armor Who keeps his visor down And charges with a moon beam spear On hard hearts of the town   Who makes the shabby fountain square A flowering glimmering park Who pierces with a sharp sweet dream The crabbed minds and dark  Who conquers those who see him not Their brooding heads bent down The knight whose scarcely heeded strokes Have cleansed and cleared the town  EUCLID  Old Euclid drew a circle On a sand beach long ago He bounded and enclosed it With angles thus and so  His set of solemn greybeards Nodded and argued much Of arc and of circumference Diameter and such  A silent child stood by them From morning until noon Because they drew such charming Round pictures of the moon   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  DRYING THEIR WINGS  What the Carpenter Said to the Child  The moon s a cottage with a door Some folk can see it plain Look You may catch a glint of light A sparkle through the pane Showing the place is brighter still Within though bright without There at a cosy open fire Strange babes are grouped about The children of the Wind and Tide The urchins of the sky Drying their wings from storms and things So they again can fly  YET GENTLE WILL THE GRIFFIN BE  What Grandpa Told the Children  The Moon It is a griffin s egg Hatching tomorrow night And how the little boys will watch With shouting and delight  To see him break the shell and stretch And creep across the sky The boys will laugh the little girls I fear may hide and cry   Yet gentle will the griffin be Most decorous and fat And walk up to the milky way And lap it like a cat  WHAT THE RATTLESNAKE SAID The Moon s a little prairie dog He shivers through the night He sits upon his hill and cries For fear that I will bite  The Sun s a broncho He s afraid Like every other thing And trembles morning noon and night Lest I should spring and sting  THE RECREANT QUEENS  To be tied to a pebble and thrown through a palace window  The Moon s a mirror where dim shades Of queens are doomed to peer The beauteous queens that loved not love Or faith or godly fear The night wind makes their mirror grey The breath of Autumn drear And many mists of time and change Have clouded it apace   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  In mercy veiled it lest each queen Too clearly see her face With long past sins deep written there And ghostly rags she now must wear While slain men o er her shoulders glare Leering at her disgrace  THE SCISSORS GRINDER  What the Tramp Said  The old man had his box and wheel For grinding knives and shears No doubt his bell in village streets Was joy to children s ears  And I bethought me of my youth When such men came around And times I asked them in quite sure The scissors should be ground  The old man turned and spoke to me His face at last in view And then I thought those curious eyes Were eyes that once I knew  The moon is but an emery wheel To whet the sword of God He said and here beside my fire I stretch upon the sod   Each night and dream and watch the stars And watch the ghost clouds go And see the sword of God in Heaven A waving to and fro  I see that sword each century friend It means the world war comes With all its bloody wicked chiefs And hate inflaming drums  Men talk of Peace but I have seen That emery wheel turn round The voice of Abel cries again To God from out the ground  The ditches must flow red the Plague Go stark and screaming by Each time the sword of God takes edge Within the midnight sky  And those that scorned their brothers here And sowed a wind of shame Will reap the whirlwind as of old And face relentless flame  And thus the scissors grinder spoke His face at last in view And there beside the railroad bridge I saw the Wandering Jew   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  WHAT THE YOUNG RHYMER SAID  No poet spent with visions Bit by the City s teeth Laughing at fortune seeking Fame and the singer s wreath But must grow brave this evening Humming a wilder tune Armed against men and nations Why He beholds the moon  Nicholas Vachel Lindsay  PARTINGS  If I leave you without a word It is not that I do not love you But that life s love depths are stirred By the shadow of God above you  If I leave you without a sign It is not that my heart is colder But that you are now more mine Through love grown wiser and older  Elizabeth Gibson Cheyne   A VERY OLD SONG  Daughter thou art come to die Sound be thy sleeping lass Well without lament or cry Mother let me pass  What things on mould were best of all  Soft be thy sleeping lass The apples reddening till they fall In the sun beside the convent wall  Let me pass  Whom on earth hast thou loved best  Sound be thy sleeping lass Him that shared with me thy breast Thee and a knight last year our guest He hath an heron to his crest  Let me pass  What leavest thou of fame or hoard  Soft be thy sleeping lass My far blown shame for thy reward To my brother gold to get him a sword  Let me pass  But what wilt leave thy lover Grim Sound be thy sleeping lass The hair he kissed to strangle him Mother let me pass  William Laird   STONE WALLS  Dividing the land are the walls walls of stone and linking Pasture with meadow and meadow with pasture again Loops of stone I see them stretching everywhere in lines  and circles Beautiful reaching lines that separate wheat fields From the pale blue of rye and the waving splendor of  oats Separating and joining 0 walls of gray Join I beseech you my spirit with yours Separate me from the world that I may be with you Touching the golden of wheat fields the silver of rye  ROCKS  Through the pasture lie the rocks gray as the sea in a fog As the sea in a mist 0 breath of my yearning O sea breaking gray in a fog The rocks rise tumultuous the rocks are waves Flee from them they are in pursuit Lichen crusted their summits rolling most mightily  Flee from the rocks the pale crested waves of the meadows Mary Eastwood Knevcls   AN IMPRESSION  The arching skies the ancient wind Soughing through immemorial trees The sense of all that lurks behind The year s now tattered masonries Where the blithe birds once built their home High in the air sweet leafy dome  Then the lone figure of a girl Clear limned against the buttressed hills Slim beautiful a tiny pearl Set round with ruby light that fills The all illumined spaces where No dark may creep nor shadow dare  Not for an earldom would I break The silence of yon dreaming maid I could not play her soul awake With Love s most magic serenade Her thought holds secrets hid from me Deeper than mortal minstrelsy  SONG OF EARTH S MEANING  What does it matter you say When the wilderness lies tame to the hand of man It can last but a day It is part of the primal plan For the best of mortal endeavor to pass away   Nay not so Man must conquer the soul of him win Leash the lightning burrow the plumbless sea Level the mountains make him a place within Dank aired mines build him cities where he Shall walk alert and free Nor trample on want and woe  Tis the spirit of man to fight For the ultimate prizes won By the sweat of his brow the light That is in him by star and sun To plant and plan and die in the quest Till the tortured world by east and west Yield him a largess of tilth and joy and rest  Haggard beat down beset By a myriad opposing things He shall labor in faith to get The glory that gives him wings To see the desert bloom like the rose And the crooked paths made straight The miracle wrought in the face of foes That menace him soon and late Since something within him dares and his deep heart  knows   Tis the romance of daedal days In this latest birth of Time And better than all the lays Of legends that ring in rhyme Tis the victor song sublime Of the pigmy that first began Up toward the stars to climb When he quoth to himself I can  He cannot but live his life Pricked by this wonder thought To use the hammer and knife Till out of the stress is wrought Out of the sorrow and strife A world a smile in an after age Even as God in his counsels sage Struck from chaos our heritage  Then hail to the master work To the romance of matter hail Never a chance to shirk Never the will to fail Till the planet conquered and cleansed shall shine As fire and swing to the song divine Of the cosmic choir brother your song and mine  Richard Burton   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  APOLOGY  Be not angry with me that I bear Your colors everywhere All through each crowded street  And meet The wonder light in every eye As I go by  Each plodding wayfarer looks up to gaze Blinded by rainbow haze The stuff of happiness  No less Which wraps me in its glad hued folds Of peacock golds  Before my feet the dusty rough paved way Flushes beneath its gray My steps fall ringed with light  So bright It seems a myriad suns are strown About the town  Around me is the sound of steepled bells And rich perfumed smells Hang like a wind forgotten cloud  And shroud   Me from close contact with the world I dwell impearled  You blazon me with jewelled insignia A flaming nebula Rims in my life And yet  You set The word upon me unconfessed To go unguessed  A BLOCKHEAD  Before me lies a mass of shapeless days Unseparated atoms and I must Sort them apart and live them Sifted dust  Covers the formless heap Reprieves delays  There are none ever As a monk who prays The sliding beads asunder so I thrust Each tasteless particle aside and just  Begin again the task which never stays  And I have known a glory of great suns When days flashed by pulsing with joy and fire Drunk bubbled wine in goblets of desire  And felt the whipped blood laughing as it runs Spilt is that liquor my too hasty hand Threw down the cup and did not understand  Amy Lowell   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  FOUR POEMS IN UNRHYMED CADENCE  I London my beautiful it is not the sunset nor the pale green sky shimmering through the curtain of the silver birch nor the quietness it is not the hopping of the little birds upon the lawn nor the darkness stealing over all things that moves me  But as the moon creeps slowly over the tree tops among the stars I think of her and the glow her passing sheds on men  London my beautiful I will climb into the branches to the moonlit tree tops that my blood may be cooled by the wind   II Dear one you sit there in the corner of the carriage and you do not know me and your eyes forbid  Is it the dirt the squalor the wear of human bodies and the dead faces of our neighbors These are but symbols  You are proud I praise you your mouth is set you see beyond us and you see nothing  I have the vision of your calm cold face and of the black hair that waves above it I watch you I love you I desire you  There is a quiet here within the thud thud of the wheels upon the railway  There is a quiet here within my heart but tense and tender  This is my station   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  III Under the lily shadow and the gold and the blue and mauve that the whin and the lilac pour down on the water the fishes quiver  Over the green cold leaves and the rippled silver and the tarnished copper of its neck and beak toward the deep black water beneath the arches the swan floats slowly  Into the dark of the arch the swan floats and the black depth of my sorrow bears a white rose of flame  IV IN THE GARDEN The grass is beneath my head and I gaze at the thronging stars in the aisles of night   They fall they fall I am overwhelmed and afraid  Each little leaf of the aspen is caressed by the wind and each is crying  And the perfume of invisible roses deepens the anguish  Let a strong mesh of roots feed the crimson of roses upon my heart and then fold over the hollow where all the pain was  F S Flint   POETRY A Magazine of Verse COMMENTS AND REVIEWS  POETRY A ZEST FOR LIFE  T is good to be reminded of first principles  in these days of professional scholarship of  detail Enjoyment of Poetry by Mr Max  Eastman Charles Scribner s Sons is not  only psychological analysis worthy of an ex professor of philosophy but it is also emotion It is the work of a live man enthralled by the power and beauty of the spirit of poetry and passionately moved to show its importance in the eternal and temporal scheme of things and to hint at the abysmal folly and stupidity of neglecting it So full of essential faith is the author faith in life in man in unvanquishable truth and beauty in the ever renewing vitality of the art that his mood throughout the book is joyous he carries one along in the sweep of his generous feeling and pays no attention to hackneyed complaints of this so called prosaic and material age  Mr Eastman begins by showing that poetry is essentially love of life The poetic person loves the journey while the practical person loves the goal The former lives the latter only uses life for his purpose The distinction he thinks  lies not in books but in the protoplasm No doubt if we knew enough we could  trace this cleavage of two motives back into the very birth of alertness in matter  and there see the one current scorning the other as today For poetry is an  attitude of the body Both anteceding and transcending speech or idea it is  a way of experiencing realities    Children are poetic in their zest for experiment and adventure Aeschylus was poetic in forgetting his tragedies to order inscribed upon his tomb the boast that he fought at Marathon The author is full of a healthy scorn for that pretty demon called an Artistic Temperament the poetic instinct is not an attribute of special exotic or disordered types but a universal quality of our nature No man living is wholly bereft of a zest for life but it is only the childlike and the poetic who make innumerable intimate acquaintances who welcome and perfect all experience  Mr Eastman s scorn of the rhetoricians is refreshing With one large gesture he dismisses their catalogues from the dictionary reduces simile and metonymy and synecdoche and other long tailed monsters to the primitive human impulse for naming things for naming them eloquently poignantly in words or phrases that flash the very essence of their meaning on the mind  The selective poetic name guides the attention to a focus and this service though it may seem slight is in fact very great and for the majority indispensable  to the acute realization of anything Even to that lucky few who are by nature awake when their eyes are open the living word is no superfluity He who can speak it who can sometimes catch the humor of their sensibility and crystallize it upon a point is as dear to them as he is tedious who can neither select a focus nor remain silent but spreads adjectives all over the face of nature Words make the world grow not because they express a feeling but because they give to the feeling locality and distinct body The more hot and electric the mind s passion for experience the more it narrows itself to a single item and  condenses there the whole ecstasy Ideally poetry would always be a vivifying through the magic of imagery and syllable of present experience in an adventurous world  But they are Time s fools who summarize We  cannot squeeze out the essence of this volume nor quote  a tithe of its very quotable phrases All that is for its    POETRY A Magazine of Verse  readers who should be numerous The whole effect of the argument is to combat the popular heresy that poetry is a bookish art Poetry is a countryman he says and greets every experience by its own name Poetry ushers us out of the library it is a gesture toward the world  In democracy and more democracy he thinks lies the hope of the art That baleful constraint the ideal of respectability is a more sure destroyer of poetry than even poverty or absorbing ambition The wealthy wrap themselves in fabrics and fine manners encase themselves in forms touch nothing to the quick  They who cherish hopes of poetry will therefore do well to favor every assault of labor upon the monopoly of leisure by a few They will be ready for a drastic redistribution of the idle hours  The brief and curiously elementary chapter on prosody is the only vulnerable point in the book We reserve its inadequacies and those of certain longer works on the subject for further discussion  H M  AS TO PREACHING  Poets are always asking Why can t I preach if I want to why if I write a pure lyric today can t I write a sermon ode tomorrow without gathering on my head the anathema of critics We do not need the talk of Art forart s sake to answer the question  All expression is preaching an endeavor to inform a comrade spirit of a truth or a seeming truth which the preacher s spirit has achieved but there are two methods   of conveying this truth One is to appeal to man s intellect and by process of reason and stimulation to mental activity to arouse his inner self to an understanding of the new conception that is the method of the priest in the chancel The other method is to recreate and transmit by the medium of words or music or painting or sculpture the actual experience which has originally brought the truth to light in the preacher s own soul so that another will find the truth for himself That is the poet s method The priest s method is indirect Unable to transmit to another the actual experience which has been vital to him he tries to reach the spirit by way of the mind The poet s method is direct and ultimately the only effective one Men do not learn as they are taught they learn as they experience The poet who sermonizes therefore is for the time being denying his gift of direct utterance and voluntarily taking the cumbersome indirect way  Pulpit orators come and go The best of them men like Wesley Beecher Phillips Brooks leave a volume or so behind them which is forgotten as all commentary is ultimately forgotten by all to whom life is an adventure rather than a series of theological problems The only preachments that live are those imaginative outbursts of temperament in clash with life which we call according to the outward form poetry or music sculpture or painting What pulpit orator or moralizing poet indeed can compete with the C major Symphony of Beethoven Or   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  even with so seemingly slight a thing as  Ah what avails the sceptred race Ah what the form divine What every virtue every grace Rose Aylmer all were thine  Rose Aylmer whom these wakeful eyes May weep but never see A night of memories and sighs I consecrate to thee  In lines such as these in Heine s songs and in Catullus in the Ode to a Nightingale in Shelley s  Swiftly walk over the western wave  Spirit of Night I Out of the misty eastern cave Where all the long and lone daylight  Thou wovest dreams of joy and fear Which make thee terrible and dear Swift be thy flight  Or in Goethe s  Ueber alien Gipfeln Ist Ruh In alien Wipfeln Spurest du Kaum einen Hauch Die Voglein schweigen im Walde Warte nur balde Ruhest du auch  Or in Wordsworth s  I wander d lonely as a cloud That floats on high o er vales and hills When all at once I saw a crowd  A host of golden daffodils Beside the lake beneath the trees Fluttering and dancing in the breeze  in such lines lie the only sermons that really matter for they fling open the windows of God s high palaces and give us a glimpse of the calm glories within   All expression truly is preaching and preaching one thing Harmony from chaos There are many folk these days who are planning in their own way to remake the world and a horde of poets among them for the poet alack must have his sociological theories packed down and salted or the critics will have none of him So we are deluged with tracts in rhyme and critics there are who will praise them and call them poetry And with it all we are like to forget that one far away lyric outburst the greatest social sermon ever preached  The fowls of the air have their nests and the foxes their holes but the Son of Man has not where to lay his head  Of all who preach to man the artist alone has a touch of the eloquence of God for it is given him to reject dry logic chopping words and speak his wisdom through the divine medium of trees and birds and stars and the eternal passions of men Hermann Hagedorn  REVIEWS  Romance Vision and Satire English Alliterative Poems of the Fourteenth Century newly rendered in the original metres by Jessie L Weston Houghton Mifflin Company Miss Weston who is well known for her translations  from mediaeval romances and her studies in the Arthurian legends has in this volume essayed a very difficult task That danger and distress await everyone who under   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  takes the translation of poetry from one language into another has long been recognized but it seems to be assumed that the modernization of ancient poetry written in the mother tongue may be undertaken with a light heart As a matter of fact successful modernization is perhaps even more difficult than translation In the first place the modernizer is tempted to retain the words and idioms of the original text even when they have lost their ancient meanings and associations In the second place if the language has undergone a loss of inflections the preservation of the original metre tempts to the insertion of words which are either conventionally decorative or mere empty syllables It is generally admitted that the most successful translations are not literal reproductions but imaginative reconstructions of the ideas imagery associations verse effects and tone of the original Such a method applied to modernization would produce results so obviously unlike the original on the surface as to insure immediate rejection The modernizer being debarred from the only method of successful translation therefore is tempted into the difficulties and dangers just indicated and Miss Weston has yielded to the temptation  Some of the poems which she has chosen to present are without question the most difficult poems in the English language Not only is the meaning often obscure but the complications of the verse structure have often resulted in a boldness of diction which is justified   only by the poetic power of the original author Miss Weston has not missed the general meaning of her texts very often but she has often inserted meaningless or conventionally decorative words for the sake of filling out the metre and still more often has substituted for the dynamic diction and visualized imagery of the original words and images that have no life or power of impressing the inner eye  But notwithstanding these deficiencies the power of this poetry is such that the book must be recommended to readers who cannot deal directly with the originals Gawain and the Green Knight and Piers the Plowman are to be sure already accessible in prose translations and Pearl has been more than once rendered into prose and into verse but Gawain at least is more effective as verse even when shorn of its brilliance and vividness and speed than as prose and the fascination of Pearl may excuse a new verse rendering of it even after the partial version by Dr Weir Mitchell and the complete one by Miss Sophie Jewett Moreover the other poems The Adventures of Arthur Morte Arthur Cleanness and Patience are not elsewhere accessible to the modern reader  One statement in the Preface is so misleading that it must be supposed that the poems were not printed as Miss Weston intended She says Since the original text of these poems is now unintelligible save to scholars they should be reproduced in their entirety But of   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Morte Arthur this volume contains only 291 lines out of 4346 the extract from Cleanness begins with line 1357 that from Patience begins with line 61 and ends with line 344 omitting 345 531 a passage containing some of the best poetry and best psychology in the poem  It is also difficult to accept the statement on the title page that the poems are rendered in the original metres The nearest approach to this is in the case of Pearl but it is practically impossible to secure in a translation the remarkable combination of complex rhyme and structural alliteration which is the characteristic technical feature of that poem The use of rhyme in the main stanza of Gawain is a blunder in technique as rhyme tends to check the rapidity of movement The same remark is true in lesser degree of Cleanness Patience and Piers the Plowman A purely alliterative measure even though rough and imperfect would have better preserved the movement and tone of the original  It is greatly to be hoped that this volume will help to emphasize the fact that Chaucer was not the only English poet of high ability in the fourteenth century In general conception and in details of execution Gawain and the Green Knight is a poem of which any writer in any age might well be proud and each of the other poems contains passages not inferior to any in the Gawain  John M Manly   Love Poems and Others by D H Lawrence Duckworth  The Love Poems if by that Mr Lawrence means the middling sensual erotic verses in this collection are a sort of pre raphaelitish slush disgusting or very nearly so The attempts to produce the typical Laurentine line have brought forth  I touched her and she shivered like a dead snake  which was improved by an even readier parodist to I touched her and she came off in scales  Jesting aside when Mr Lawrence ceases to discuss his own disagreeable sensations when he writes low life narrative as he does in Whether or Not and in Violets there is no English poet under forty who can get within shot of him That Masefield should be having a boom seems as one takes count of these poems frankly ridiculous  It is no more possible to quote from them as illustration than it would be to illustrate a Rembrandt by cutting off two inches of canvas The first is in mood ridden chiaroscuro the characters being a policeman his sweetheart his mother and a widow who has taken advantage of his excitement and by whom he has had a child It is sullen and heavy and as ugly as such a tale must be  Yi tha rt a man tha rt a fine big man but never a baby had eyes As sulky an ormin as thine  I damn well shanna marry er  So chew at it no more  Or I ll chuck the flamin lot of you  You needn t have swore   So much for the tonality Kipling has never done it as well in verse though he gets something like the same range in his prose of Bedelia Harrodsfoot The comparison with Masefield is as I have said ridiculous It is what Masefield would like to do and can not  Violets presents two girls and another at the funeral of a young fellow who has died among  Pals worse n r any name as you could call  Ah know tha liked im better nor me But let  Me tell thee about this lass When you had gone  Ah stopped behind on t pad i th drippin wet An watched what er ad on If this book does not receive the Polignac prize a year from this November there will be due cause for scandal Mr Lawrence was discovered by Ford Madox Hueffer during the latter s editorship of the English Review about four years ago Some of his verses appeared then and he has since made a notable reputation by his prose works The White Peacock and The Trespasser His prose training stands him in good stead in these poems The characters are real They are not stock figures of the poor done from the outside and provided with cliché emotions I expect you know who I am Mrs Naylor  Who yer are yis you re Lizzie Stainwright An appen you might guess what I ve come for  Appen I mightn t appen I might  This prize awarded by the British academic committee to Walter de la  Mare in 1911 to Masefield in 1912 is given for a work of imagination which  must have appeared before the November previous   Mr Lawrence has attempted realism and attained it He has brought contemporary verse up to the level of contemporary prose and that is no mean achievement These two poems at least are great art  Ezra Pound  NOTES  Mr Nicholas Vachel Lindsay was introduced to the readers of POETRY through General Booth Enters into Heaven in the January number This poem will
