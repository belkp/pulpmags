little poems Delicate as a flock of doves  They fly away like white winged doves  TWO IMPRESSIONS  I  The colorless morning glides upward  Over the marsh and ragged trees  Though our mood be sombre And our bodies angry for more sleep   This feathered softness of pale light Falling negligently upon us Delights us  II  High above the drab barren ground Three herons beat across the dawn blue sky They drift slowly away Until they appear As three horizontal umber brush strokes On finely shaded cobalt And the mist driven by the wind Up and across the distant hill Gleams like soft white hair Brushed amorously backward  COMPENSATION  As I dozed in a chilly dug out I dreamt that Li Taï Pé the sage And Sappho the divine Lesbian And Abou Nawas the friend of Khalifs Came to me saying There can be no death of beauty Endure we also suffered  And for a token of their love they gave me A gold chrysanthemum a fiery rose And a cleft open dew wet nectarine   Richard Aldington  LOSS  This is not hell At least merely a comfortable hell With warmth and food and some still moments Ere the true hell comes rushing in again Yet this one thought is torture  Have I lost her lost her indeed Lost the calm eyes and eager lips of love The two fold amorous breasts and braided hair The white slim body my senses fed upon And all the secret shadows shot with fire  BEAUTY UNPRAISED  There is only you The rest are palterers slovens parasites You only are strong clear cut austere Only about you the light curls Like a gold laurel bough  Your words are cold flaked stone Scentless white violets  Laugh Let them blunder The sea is ever the sea And none can change it None possess it  Richard Aldington   WAR FILMS  MOTHER S SON IN SALONIKA  The midnight shadow sinking down has slung Over your tent the one tent of us all my love In whose close folds above you near above The flame of my soul like a trembling star is hung  That is my spirit hovering close above You now as you turn your face towards the sky Oh as you stand looking up do you know it is I Do you lift your lips to kiss me good night my love  CASUALTY  As I went down the street in my rose red pelerine Some one stopped me and said Your lover is hurt Oh bring him to me I said Oh lay him between My arms let me cover him up in my skirt  And you oh see the myriad doves that walk Beneath the steps of St Paul s Catch several And kill for Aphrodite Don t speak do not talk One of you kindle a fire to consume them withal  MESSAGE TO A PERFIDIOUS SOLDIER  If you meet my young man Greet him from me   D H Lawrence  Touch him on the shoulder And tell him from me The moon is not any warmer the sun no colder  If he understands You will know by his eyes If he only stands And stares in surprise Tell him prayer is stronger than iron faith makes no demands  THE JEWESS AND THE V C  Ah young man What sort of timorous potion of love have you drunk If you see my rings how they sparkle within my ears You go about in a dream with your countenance sunk And children behind you taunting you to tears  Why if you saw my limbs how they shine on my body What then would you do Then for sure you would go And die like a dog in a hole Tis strange what a shoddy Lover you make such a hero in front of the foe  SIGHS  Ah my love my dear  But what if my love should chance to hear As he is passing unbeknown What if he turned and saw me here I should lean and whisper in his ear  Love my love now all is known  Love me and put me out of fear  Or leave me alone  THE CHILD AND THE SOLDIER  O brother put me in your pouch As you would a fresh sweet locust pod For I am frail as a flask of glass As a fine grey egg or a slender rod O brother and I am the golden ring You wear on your finger so gladly For God  Takes everything from you tomorrow and gives me everything ZEPPELIN NIGHTS  Now will you play all night Come in my mother says Look in the sky at the bright Moon all ablaze Look at the shaking white Searchlight rays  Tonight they re coming It s a full moon When you hear them humming Very soon You ll stop that blooming Tune   D H Lawrence  Children sing on unheeding Sally go round the sun Sally go round the moon Sally go round the chimney pots  On Sunday afternoon  DAUGHTER OF THE GREAT MAN  The daughter of the great man rolls her khaki wool And in her hands the sparkling needles fly Swiftly I wish I might kiss her fingers but full Of danger I find her even worse than the fields where we die  PRISONER AT WORK IN A TURKISH GARDEN  Appeal from the garden  Over the fountain and the orange trees The evening shadow has sunk Bringing night once more and the man with the keys That shut me up in my bunk  You forty ladies in the harem bower Listen for I will explain Bitter to me is this evening hour Each evening bitter again  Response from the Harem  Sisters I am sorry for this foreign man Who labors all day in the sun   Sisters the search light s swinging fan In heaven has begun  Stranger soft are the tears that fall For pity of thee Sisters the guns are speaking let all Sing soothingly  MOURNING  Why do you go about looking for me mother I and my betrothed are together in the shed Sitting there together for a little while Why are you so anxious Leave me peaceful with my dead  THE GREY NURSE  The grey nurse entered a rose garden Where roses shadows dappled her Her apron was brown with blood She prayed And roses wondered at her prayer  NEITHER MOTH NOR RUST  God only God is eternally God is forever and only He  Where white maid are the men you have loved  They are dead so God was between you you see  D H Lawrence   CHALANDRY  I saw Chalandry gassed Four hundred men Blind retching snuffling Staggering past  The colonel and his staff Our ninety sixth Men horses officers Over half  Two carried one and all Whose sight remained Led columns wavering Quick to fall  Those silent stumbled by And brushed their eyes With grimy rags or fists  Unendingly  Out of the night they came And all day long And then another night  Still the same  Goodrich   C Schauffler  TWO SONGS OF THE ENIGMA  For L F S  MODERN LOVE SONG  Now that the evenfall is come And the sun fills the flaring trees  And everything is mad lit dumb And in the pauses of the breeze A far voice seems to call me home  To haven beyond woods and leas  I feel again how sharply stings The spell which binds our troubled dust With hint of divine frustrated things The Soul s deep doubt and desperate trust That she at sunset shall find wings To bear her beyond Now and Must  So place your head against my head And set your lips upon my lips That so I may be comforted For ah the world so from me slips  To the world sunset I am sped Where Soul and Silence come to grips And Love stands sore astonishèd   Robert Nichols  A WANDERING THING  The hopeless rain a sigh a shadow Falters and drifts again again over the meadow It wanders lost drifts hither thither It blows it goes it knows not whither  A profound grief an unknown sorrow Wanders always my strange life thoro I know not ever what brings it hither Nor whence it comes nor goes it whither  Robert Nichols  YOU DIED FOR DREAMS  You re quiet forgetful of the blind disaster That laid you here You re quiet Shall I tell then At whose word you went out saying O Master And with what strange beauty your dying blessed your men  You re quiet oh so still and pale and quiet You who were ruddy and the quickest and so strong I shall tell them I think after this riot That you died for dreams because the world is wrong  Arthur L Phelps   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  POEMS  TO ANY POET  Below there are white faced throngs Their march is a tide coming nigher Below there are white faced throngs Their faith is a banner flung higher Below there are white faced throngs White swords they have yet but red songs Place and lot they have lost hear you not For a dream you once dreamed and forgot  THE BISON  How great a front is thine  A lake of majesty  Assyria knew the sign  The god incarnate King  A lake of majesty The lion s drowns in it And thy placidity A moon within that lake  As if thou still dost own  A world thou takest breath  Earth shape and strength of stone  A Titan sultan s child   Padraic Colum  THE VULTURES  Foul feathered and scald necked  They sit in evil state  Raw marks upon their breasts  As on men s wearing chains  Impure though they may plunge  Into the morning s springs  And spirit dulled though they  Command the heights of heaven  Angels of foulness ye  So fierce against the dead Sloth on your muffled wings And speed within your eyes  THE WANDERERS  A mighty star has drawn a nigh and now  Is vibrant in the air The trembling half divested trees of his Bright presence are aware  And Night has told it to the hills and told The partridge in the nest And left it on the long white roads that she Gives light instead of rest  I watch it in the stream the stranger star Pulsing from marge to main   What mould will be my flesh and bone before That star is there again  Padraic Colum  SHROUDS  Ho Stranger consider and give answer  Whether a lonely bed in a sun struck veldt With the eagles crying above you And a soft nosed bullet spreading and grinding Beneath a bloodless puncture And the winds singing in the brilliant blue  Or a damned respectable passing at Clapham Rival undertakers with black edged Gothic lettered Cards waiting on your unwashed doorstep Mary Ann is resting from the shock of grief Very reverent Madam say they with three carriages Black horses and plumes to say nothing of a brass bound Coffin cheap and very respectable Damned re  spectable  Such is the passing of most men  Better say I the sand and the sound of the eagles crying  Reeves Brook   FROM LAUREL WREATHS  THE FALLEN  Wherever you are O strong throated Husky souled The sun was on your swords The light of all time and the still wanderings of high Ro  mance through forest tracks Flame touched you flame and wonder The stars for a moment singing in your lips The sea for an instant washing the doors of your souls Wherever you are O fallen Timid though or gruff Prometheus welded your limbs And set them aflame  Now we hear of you dying And do not understand  THE SOLDIER TO HELEN  Do not think of me sadly only me sadly I beseech you Let your little hands slur not an instant over the sweet  passages Let not your lips be smitten It is well   Here in the silver snuff of dusk That will put my single candle out I know Silently some evening when the moon hangs low Here in the mellow hush of war War is a hush that puts your legs on straighter And your torso fitter for the bait of gods I am well  Candle or flame or moth Do not worry do not slip a moment on the yellow path Your little feet dance over as a wild faun on the hills Do not be troubled It is well  MY FRIEND  He ran wild I have seen the stiff butterfly weed by the road Flaming as he When I asked him I who could sit every night By a snug safe fire He said I was a mendicant under the Dark Reign And sat on a dung hill nine years Praying grace God gave me grace I have a wine cup that is higher than the towers rising over  Notre Dame   Loureine Aber  FAREWELL  Will you latch up the doors And hush the lyre that wakes its soul in the corner Latch up the doors and open the windows That the wind may come in For I go earthward and shall nevermore return Nevermore When the Autumn rises like a burnished god When the Spring steps over the writhing hills When Winter sweeps her robe across the roofs And Summer wheels her droning sleepy bees Nevermore Will you latch up the doors But hang no yew on the lintel And weep no tear in the doorway I go skyward and shall nevermore return Though the earth soul cry at me whining like a lone lover  in the dark Though the soil lean her bare brown bosom toward my  cheek Latch up the doors Still the wailing lyre in the corner I go deathward and shall nevermore return  Loureine Aber   ARBOR VITAE  J K Died July 30th 1918  Nothing sings so sweetly as the silence of his song Nothing runs so swiftly as his feet supremely still Nothing seems so neighbored to the heavens as the hill Whereon he sleeps all conquering forever young and strong  His soldier body is at peace and dreams have closed his  eyes But his spirit drains the cup of love for which his body bled Oh poems may be made by fools as humbly he has said Yet God and he have made the tree beneath whose shade he  lies  Louise Ayres Garnett  IN NEW MEXICO  There is a hut far up the path Its door has fallen and the sun Looks in by day and many stars Look in when day is done  There is an idle mining claim Dug into rock a fling at Chance But God for what you don t find here Look on his grave in France  Glenn Ward Dresbach   BELLEAU HILL  O winds that mourn the dead on Belleau Hill Cease wailing blow a trumpet for the free Who gave their lives for love of liberty O wind shout forth their praise from Belleau Hill  O stars shining upon the cross so still That marks the summit and the battle s end Light up our sky that we may still defend The hill he won and all his hopes fulfil  O flowers that climb the top of Belleau Hill Give to my dead hopes life and to them bring The colors of the young returning Spring The faith that lives the love no death can kill  Mary Gray  OF RUINED CITIES  Soissons and Cambrai Noyon and Verdun Dear dead with beauty on them as they lie But Ypres and Lens beneath the shining sky Are skeletons slow bleaching in the sun  Eve Brodlique Summers   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  SIDE LIGHTS ON WAR  DOLLY PARKER  For three years she had been the belle of her town Always she was dated up for weeks ahead Always she wore flowers and fraternity pins And rings and bangles That men had given her She was the most rushed at all the dances Her telephone rang the oftenest The postman brought her the most letters The picture shows the drug stores knew her On summer nights her hammock swung gently On winter nights the lamps were low in her parlor As a man gambles She flirted  Then War came And as a strong wind sweeps the street of dead leaves The town was swept of men There were no telephone calls and no flowers The hammock was still the lamps turned low had no  meaning She couldn t compete with her rival She couldn t compete with War   Margretta Scott  MRS JOHN WRIGHT  She no longer held him In the long dragging evenings She knew that The mirror shouted to her That she was no longer desirable Her hair had lost its color Her eyes were dull She loathed his perfunctory kisses His polite inquiries as to what she had been doing all day She loathed him Because she loved him  Then War came He went towards it hungrily Like a dog to red meat Life woke up in him rubbing its eyes In a hot glow of emotion He remembered what she had been to him And in his voice was a tenderness That kindled beauty within her The night before he left she slept in his arms And War had given more than it can take away  MRS FINNIGAN  She never got enough to drink She was as thirsty as a sun dried pond   Her old man gave the money to Mary She wasn t afraid of a chit like Mary But she was afraid of her old man  War came And her old man had to go She gave him a holy medal And God s blessings She got his allotment And a Government allowance The swinging doors of every saloon hailed to her She slept with a black bottle under her pillow It s a foine war she would say to Mary And the Govermint treats you splindid  DAVID  He was a poet And because beauty burned within him Beauty was around him He walked through life on tip toe hugging dreams In him was a gentle eagerness And to him all women were good And all children beautiful The sky was a minstrel ground And the moon and stars ancient players Water sang to him And flowers prayed to him   Margretta Scott  The day was a packet for delight The night a box for beauty  When the wings of War whizzed in his ears He was kindled as with a million torches Because he was a poet He became an aviator He rode his bird of War through the clouds And the winds wailed before and after him One day as a bright bird falls He fell from the sky And he died chanting his hymn to War And War was beauty  Margretta Scott  A ROAD OF FRANCE  All day the carts go by along the road That bear a regal though a sorry load Long pine trees stripped of all save of their crown Which in the trodden mire is trailing down  Young kings that knew the mountains and the stars  Dragged captive at the chariot wheels of Mars  Charles L O Donnell   THE CENSOR  The Censor growled to see so many letters He lit his pipe and read them hastily  One said Dear pal you ought to see me now This France is some swell place I m telling you The wine is great and oh the women boy   Another said Dear sister pray for me This is a cruel war but God is good My bunkie s gone went West last week poor chap Dear sister pray for me Good night Good bye  Another said Well wife how are you now And how s the boy I dreamt about you both Last night Don t worry dear I ll soon be home And now good night These stars are kisses dear   The Censor yawned He was so tired of letters  John R C Peyton   IN THE RED CROSS  To A W F  Her near presence teases the slender young red head Playing at war work laughing as she plays The look in her eyes bodes a deal of mischief God help the bold ones till she mend her ways  Just passed the boundary set out for childhood Ah there s a breath of April with the lass Lanes and little places with echoes of a one step God help the shy ones how soon their luck will pass  She never caring for the solemn moments Dusty feet that go trampling the ground She never heeding anxious praying persons God help the wakeful how her sleep is sound  The fragrance of violets steals quickly upwards All of the sky is full of shooting stars Half of a kiss would surely never matter God help our memories what should they be but scars  Gordon Hamilton   THE HOME COMING  They come back Up the great street To the drum beat and the heart beat And the thud of tramping feet To the lightning and the thunder Of the nation in the street They come back From that heart breaking Terrible leave taking From the cold lips Of the unquiet sea and the lips Of the dead children of the ships From the unending waiting Wrapped in that death unending And the quick charging Into what mess Of bloodiness They come back O hearts that bled See they are not dead They come back They come back  They come back Up the great street To the drum beat and the heart beat And the sense of shadow feet   George Marian  To the tear drops and the heart stops Of the pale ones in the street March the ghosts Of all the hosts That went but come not back From the heart breaking Terrible leave taking From the hell Where they fell From that ghastly night ride And the lonesome row of beds where they died They come back Up the great street To the drum beat and the heart beat And the music of the street To the laurel wreath of tears And the crown of honor of cheers From the nation in the street For the smooth brow And the still feet O hearts that bled And bleed and bleed For your dead Who to our utter need Gave what they had Forgive If we who see our loved ones live To day rejoice   With straining arms and husky voice Forgive forgive  They come back Up the great street To the madness of the gladness Of the people in the street The wounded come Home From the heart breaking Terrible leave taking They come back To the memory and the aching O you of the torn flesh Now when you hear our cheering and our cry Of welcome do not glaze your eye With that strange wondering why You did not die The empty earth about you Could not endure without you You are the faith that s in us and the seeing Beyond ourselves into our utmost being  They come back Up the thousand streets To the uproar and the furore And the wild joy of the streets To the lightning and the thunder   George Marian  And the rainbow in our hearts Then shout throats and brasses blare And flags and bugles tear the air For here go Heroes of heroes they who dare For dreams give things Flowers and houses and love For the vision of The spirit that is in them Blow flags and bugles blow Here where our heroes go All of the most beautiful and great The poems and the music of all time The sense that there is something that s sublime Are marching up the street Up the great street To the drum beat and the heart beat And the cadence of their feet Up the great street From what heart breaking Terrible leave taking From what bloodless treachery And what bloody butchery They come back veiled in their victory  George Marian   A LITTLE GIRL S SONGS  FOR YOU MOTHER  I have a dream for you Mother Like a soft thick fringe to hide your eyes I have a surprise for you Mother Shaped like a strange butterfly I have found a way of thinking To make you happy I have made a song and a poem All twisted into one If I sing you listen If I think you know I have a secret from everybody in the world full of people But I cannot always remember how it goes It is a song For you Mother With a curl of cloud and a feather of blue And a mist Blowing along the sky If I sing it some day under my voice Will it make you happy  MORNING  There is a brook I must hear Before I go to sleep There is a birch tree I must visit Every night of clearness I have to do some dreaming I have to listen a great deal Before light comes back By a silver arrow of cloud And I rub my eyes and say  It must be morning on this hill  ROSE PETAL  Petal with rosy cheeks Petal with thoughts of your own Petal of my crimson white flower out of June Little petal of my heart   Hilda Conkling  THE DEW LIGHT  The Dew man comes over the mountains wide Over the deserts of sand With his bag of clear drops And his brush of feathers He scatters brightness The white bunnies beg him for dew He sprinkles their fur They shake themselves  All the time he is singing  The unknown world is beautiful  He polishes flowers Humming Oh beautiful He sings in the soft light That grows out of the dew Out of the misty dew light that leans over him He makes his song  It is beautiful the unknown world  POPLARS  The poplars bow forward and back They are like a fan waving very softly They tremble For they love the wind in their feathery branches They love to look down at the shallows  At the mermaids On the sandy shore They love to look into morning s face Cool in the water  NARCISSUS  Narcissus I like to watch you grow When snow is shining Beyond the crystal glass A coat of snow covers the hills far The sun is setting And you stretch out flowers of palest white In the pink of the sun   YELLOW SUMMER THROAT  Yellow summer throat sat singing  In a bending spray of willow tree  Thin fine green y lines on his throat  The ruffled outside of his throat  Trembled when he sang  He kept saying the same thing  The willow did not mind  I knew what he said I knew  But how can I tell you  I have to watch the willow bend in the wind  NIGHT GOES RUSHING BY  Night goes hurrying over  Like sweeping clouds  The birds are nested their song is silent  The wind says 00 00 00 through the trees  For their lullaby  The moon shines down on the sleeping birds  My cottage roof is like a sheet of silk Spun like a cobweb My apple trees are bare as the oaks in the forest When the moon shines I see no leaves  I am alone and very quiet  Hoping the moon may say something  Before long  SEAGARDE  I will return to you  O stillest and dearest To see the pearl of light That flashes in your golden hair To hear you sing your songs of starlight And tell your stories of the wonderful land Of stars and fleecy sky To say to you that Seagarde will soon be here Seagarde the fairy With her seagulls of hope   Hilda Conkling  EASTER  On Easter morn Up the faint cloudy sky I hear the Easter bell  Ding dong ding dong Easter morning scatters lilies On every doorstep Easter morning says a glad thing Over and over Poor people beggars old women Are hearing the Easter bell  Ding dong ding dong  SNOW FLAKE SONG  Snowflakes come in fleets Like ships over the sea The moon shines down on the crusty snow The stars make the sky sparkle like gold fish in a glassy bowl Bluebirds are gone now But they left their song behind them The moon seems to say  It is time for summer when the birds come back To pick up their lonesome songs  POEMS  See the fur coats go by The morning is like the inside of a snow apple I will curl myself cushion shape On the window seat I will read poems by snow light If I cannot understand them so I will turn them upside down And read them by the red candles Of garden brambles  THOUGHTS  My thoughts keep going far away Into another country under a different sky My thoughts are sea foam and sand they are apple petals fluttering   SNOW STORM  Snowflakes are dancing They run down out of heaven Coming home from somewhere down the long tired road They flake us sometimes The way they do the grass And the stretch of the world  BUTTERFLY  As I walked through my garden I saw a butterfly light on a flower His wings were pink and purple He spoke a small word it was Follow I cannot follow I told him I have to go the opposite way  GEOGRAPHY  I can tell balsam trees By their grayish bluish silverish look of smoke Pine trees fringe out Hemlocks look like Christmas The spruce tree is feathered and rough Like the legs of the red chickens in our poultry yard I can study my geography from chickens Named for Plymouth Rock and Rhode Island And from trees out of Canada No I shall leave the chickens out I shall make a new geography of my own I shall have a hillside of spruce and hemlock Like a separate country  And I shall mark a walk of spires on my map A secret road of balsam trees With blue buds Trees that smell like a wind out of fairy land Where little people live Who need no geography But trees  Hilda Conkling eight years old  COMMENT  A YEAR AFTER  AT this time a year ago the American troops were push ing into the thickest of the fight undaunted by the inferno of blood and noise the hideous diabolic rain of death Today they are marching through our streets these rows on rows of bronze colored boys coming back as modestly as they went away somewhat abashed by the cheering crowds and the young girls throwing flowers  In the emotion of the moment it may be that old things are passing away and that all things shall become new  It seems appropriate to recall those tragic summer days of our suffering and loss and to inquire into the meaning of that Victory which our soldiers bring home to us on their banners and for which their comrades died Will it mean spiritual renewal more ease more joy more faith a richer more spontaneous and expansive life for all those who do their share of work in the world Millions of young men have been pulled out of their little ruts of inbreeding toil have been carried over seas to discover how beauty bloomed in Europe long ago and how another kind of beauty may flame today in their own hearts may express itself in new blood brotherhoods and in tragically generous ideals Millions of young women have risen in spirit to follow their heroes to that new old world and support them with hands and hearts in all the arduous details of  war   Will it be enough to give back their old jobs to these boys with the new vision these girls with the new hope Must we not give them something more Must we not toss to them beauty like roses beauty from the full fragrant baskets of nature and the arts beauty for them to breathe and play with and pin on their coats and have for their own like sunlight Must we not feel and help them to feel that every human soul is a potential artist in his own way and degree entitled to free and spontaneous and joyous expression in beauty and that the universal instinct for self expression in beauty is not to be crushed or laughed at or postponed or even quite satisfied from without but is to be fulfilled and developed from within until it becomes the happiness of life whether for work or play  Is there any other solution for the unrest of the world any other solution than spiritual enrichment than opening the way for a full free expressive life where hitherto life has been narrow slavish and suppressed Our Puritan ancestors refused the arts but their art instinct flowered in religion must we be sterile because we have lost their forced and hybrid flower of faith And is there life or the hope of it in sterility  Thus the arts are of cosmic importance Every art enterprise which has life in it should be encouraged as an effort to free the spirit of man statesmen if they were wise would see to it that the best art of the time flows as naturally and inevitably through the land as its life giving rivers do And each humblest joyous effort at creation is   A Year After  in its degree an art enterprise Every farm boy gaily whittling out an animal or drawing a head in chalk every village dramatic or poetry club delighting to act their own plays to read their own verses and leading it may happen now and then beyond the village levels by opening some youth s pathway to the heights these are the true revolutionists who will create the new world  Will they create great art great poetry Who knows that is in the hands of the whimsical god who scatters at his will the seeds of genius But at least they may prepare and enrich the soil so that the seed may not fall on rocky or barren ground and they may give the sapling a fair chance at healthy growth A masterpiece of art or poetry or science or business the Reims cathedral Hamlet the Loening monoplane Marshall Field s store is never an isolated magic miracle but the response of genius to the cumulative will of the immediate world The great ages in any department of human effort come only when great energy of creation meets great energy of sympathy The match must strike the right surface to produce the fire  H M  NOTES FROM A TALK ON POETRY  The poet goes up and down continually empty handed To tear down to destroy life s lies to keep the senses bare to attack to attack for the nakedness he achieves the sense of an eternal beginning and end that is his job in lieu of getting into the game on a fair footing   The most whimsical work is the result of seriousness and nothing else Any man who does not take his technique which means saying what he means and not saying what he does not mean with bitter seriousness is a jackass The sign of a poet s unforgiving seriousness is his rebellious laughter which he guards with immaculate craft A dimming technique ensnares the senses one must continually break down what oneself has accomplished One must come out clean One is not tricked or beaten into acquiescence except by physical decay  Poets have no quarrel with anyone Especially not with the regular fellow In tired moments we must envy him the sport the game guy I see him laugh at life I ve seen him fling it aside for a glass of beer I love these fellows perhaps I wish I could be like them I remember their names Fred Sempken Dago Shenck Vincent Stephenson But I m not blind as they were To see makes me afraid I am conscious that I know nothing They didn t care one way or the other their laughter was sincere But not more sincere more real than mine Mine is not bitter stuff disguised as laughter not a lie My laughter is no more a lie than theirs is Get wise that s all They have their silly jokes and their careless laughter But there is only one joke I know a joke when I see it  Heavy talk is talk that waits upon a deed Talk is servile that is set to inform Words with the bloom on them run before the imagination like the saeter girls from Peer Gynt It is talk with the patina of whim upon it that   Notes from a Talk on Poetry  makes action a bootlicker The world of the senses lies unintelligible on all sides It is only interpretable by the emotions It only exists when its emotion is fastened to it This is artistic creation  I must write I must strive to express myself I must study my technique as a Puritan did his Bible because I cannot get at my emotions in any other way There is nothing save the emotions I must write I must talk when I can It is my defiance my love song all of it  But is the world of the senses only interpretable by the emotions A scientist must ask that question he must say to me If you really want to go in for truth and will shut up long enough for me to tell you something why don t you go after it in a scientific way Look at Curie or Ramsay or Ehrlich these men made material and useful discoveries Did they not interpret the objective world by something more than the emotions No they did not These are questions a poet must answer or give up his position It will not do to say One man is one thing and another man is something else That will do for life but a poet cannot answer in that way He is a revolutionist he is out for truth  This is my answer What has Curie or Mme Curie achieved Radium thank you But here s a better example What has Professor Doolittle who during a lifetime studied the oscillations of the earth on its axis Doolittle the father of H D what has he achieved sitting till morning with his beard actually frozen to the eye piece of   his telescope in Upper Darby He has achieved nothing save brotherhood with Villon whose ink was frozen in the pot when he finished writing his Petit Testament He has achieved an emotion It is the search of that alone that kept him there Without it nothing could have made him look into his lenses no matter if they had chained his head to the eye piece  What difference does it make that the scientist s deceptions are profitable He seeks the emotion of stability of fixity of truth But he thinks the things he finds are that truth And he teaches this to others and it becomes law i e a lie  And so he goes on from work to work piously seeking seeking triumphs that melt under his fingers the moment he touches them For his triumphs are fleeting just as the triumphs of any one else are fleeting What is the discovery of radium to Mme Curie today Aside from the lying orthodox convention of fame which no man has ever cared a damn for if he could have his life anew what is her discovery to her but a stale useless thing a thing she would forget in a minute if she could equal it with another as great It is to her exactly nothing save the end of the circle exactly where the beginning was a serenity a stasis a community with her masters And what is that but an emotion But the scientist does not realize beforehand that he is deceived in his solidities while the artist knows the fleeting nature of his triumphs before they come Therefore I do not propose to be a scientist in my seeking of truth   Notes from a Talk on Poetry  Knowledge is a fleeting emotion Science is an emotion Progress is rot The artist is the only man bound by his intelligence to consider facts the fundamental emotional basis of all knowledge  Poetry is a language of the emotions A poem is good when it hasn t a comma in it that doesn t contribute to the specific emotion of the poem Nothing else is necessary A bad poem is full of English literature Modern poetry has certain characteristics By modern poetry I mean specifically that body of verse written under conditions of my living knowledge and with which I am in sympathy a thing of the immediate past In common with all other poetry it has been under the necessity of realizing that eyes ears fingertips everything we are everything we do is constantly wearing out The sense seeks avidly not only a language but a fresh language This is the first job of the artist he must do this it is truth For a truth twenty years old is a lie because the emotion has gone out of it After that it lives as a lie as life s servant a law  But the particular characteristic of modern poetry has been its dispersive quality It goes into all corners into every emotion down as well as up because it must because it seeks the truth because there is nothing save the emotions because no emotion can be justly stressed above another  Rhyme was a language once but now it is a lie It is not to be boastful that I strike out against the old but because I must It is one effort to remain aware In the presence of some rhymed masterpiece of antiquity I am   humble in its beauty I take refuge But one is never safe no sooner is one a little at ease than life comes back to the slugging match When life really wants a weapon it will always slam antiquity in a fellow s face forcing him to become defiant to accept nothing  It is impossible to write modern poetry today in the old forms It is not perfection that I dare attack but lies masquerading behind and through that perfection for nothing is safe Again and again I affirm there is no importance in anything save the emotion Play again I ll smash every lie you put up I ll sit derisively drinking wine laughing cracking jokes with Fra Angelico watching him begin the new picture  To each thing its special quality its special value that will enable it to stand alone When each poem has achieved its particular form unlike any other when it shall stand alone then we have achieved our language We have said what it is in our minds to say William Carlos Williams  REVIEWS  SASSOON ON TH E WAR  Counter Attack and other Poems by Siegfried Sassoon E P  Dutton amp Co  The war is over now and the war will fade in memory and change Already it is beginning The bunk and the slush and the bright cheery surface of the war life that surface which men built that they should not go mad these   Sassoon on the War  things are conquering in men s minds They are set down in print How should they not live  The agony is hidden One does not gladly relive agony How strange the home folk say that the boys do not talk more of what they have seen Agony is too strong a tune for words They cannot carry it They buckle like the tones of a phonograph when the strain is too great They screech and the agony escapes Only the surface and the bunk can be said easily  But Siegfried Sassoon has grappled with agony and has set it down more nearly than any other poet Even with him the tones buckle sometimes but to one who has felt what he writes the screech is fitting though it escapes the boundaries of art  Sassoon more than any other poet of war has gone straight to the root of war to the sea of human pain that underlies and feeds its horror His book is a cringe of pain At times the very pages seem to cringe under one s hand so terrible is their content This from Counter attack  The place was rotten with dead green clumsy legs  High booted sprawled and grovelled along the saps  And trunks face downward in the sucking mud  Wallowed like trodden sand bags loosely filled  And naked sodden buttocks mats of hair  Bulged clotted heads slept in the plastering slime  And then the rain began the jolly old rain  There is no refusal to face facts here no mitigating of the essential fact that war is a degenerating thing in every way and blights all it touches There is no tenderness of mind He quivers and cringes but he carries on upheld by the   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  sheer power of his agony and a certain pride in the human soul He sees the accompanying bunk and it draws from him a bitter irony Could anything in words cut deeper than this  Does it matter losing your legs For people will always be kind And you need not show that you mind When the others come in after hunting To gobble their muffins and eggs  Does it matter losing your sight There s such splendid work for the blind And people will always be kind As you sit on the terrace remembering And turning your face to the light  Do they matter those dreams from the pit   You can drink and forget and be glad  And people won t say that you re mad  For they ll know that you ve fought for your country  And no one will worry a bit  And his arraignment of the press For having been myself war correspondent in France I applaud every word of it There are exceptions of course Paul Scott Mowrer the poet but Sassoon is right He sees true  His Repression of War Experience and To Any Dead Officer both too long to quote here his Glory of Women his The Effect the title poem of the book and half a dozen others these are to my mind without any exception the truest human documents written about the war The war should be seen as Sassoon sees it should be faced as he faces it Perhaps then there would be no more war  Buy this book you who have not been to the war and you who have buy it and read it once a year lest you   Sassoon on the War  forget We dare not forget We have no right to forget Not hatred of the enemy that will pass and should But the pain the unutterable agony of body and spirit this must not be forgotten We must hold Sassoon to us that we do not sink again into the feather bed of peace For as Sassoon writes so is war E T  IRISH GRIEF  The Sad Years by Dora Sigerson Mrs Clement Shorter  With an Introduction by Katherine Tynan George H  Doran Co  For the friends of Mrs Shorter who read her personality into these poems they undoubtedly mean more than for the stranger Yet they have a fine genuineness a freshness and spontaneity which commend them even to the most casual reader All the poems in this book were written during the war and they express a passionate devotion to Ireland the country of her birth and a distress over the Irish situation which was as Mrs Tynan says in her introduction the chief cause leading to Mrs Shorter s physical break down and death Among the best poems in the book are The Black Horseman The Comforters Home and They did not See Thy Face poems sure to be included in future Irish anthologies Of these we quote The Comforters  When I crept over the hill broken with tears When I crouched down on the grass dumb in despair I heard the soft croon of the wind bend to ray ears I felt the light kiss of the wind touching my hair   When I stood lone on the height my sorrow did speak As I went down the hill I cried and I cried The soft little hands of the rain stroking my cheek The kind little feet of the rain ran by my side  When I went to thy grave broken with tears When I crouched down in the grass dumb in despair I heard the sweet croon of the wind soft in my ears I felt the kind lips of the wind touching my hair  When I stood lone by the cross sorrow did speak When I went down the long hill I cried and I cried The soft little hands of the rain stroked my pale cheek The kind little feet of the rain ran by my side  A C H  OTHER POETS OF THE WAR  In Flanders Fields by John McCrae with

Book of Songs by Jesse Edgar Middleton G P Putnam s Sons En Repos and Elsewhere Over There by Lansing Warren and Robert A Donaldson Houghton Mifflin Co The Drums in our Street by Mary Carolyn Davies Mac  millan Co Forward March by Angela Morgan John Lane Co The Chosen Nation by Irwin St John Tucker Published  by the Author Chicago No one can read without emotion the commonest journalism of the war whether it be in prose or verse Th e ex   Other Poets of the War  perience of fighting men tersely reported from day to day during those four years has been immediately absorbing beyond any literature of past or present Bits of this journalism indeed had literary value a vivid spontaneous beauty even though like flowers of the field it was born but to perish but oftener its poignancy depended upon the reader s fervor of interest rather than the writer s artistry  War verse being more quotable than war prose has been more easily caught up and preserved The war anthologies are full of good journalism of vivid reporting with now and then a lyric or perhaps a drama of higher quality to give us hope that the devastating tragic glory of those years of wrath may yet leave adequate record  The books listed above are mostly journalism but now and then some poem lifts the emotion of the moment into song thus winning a chance of survival after the moment has passed John McCrae achieves this in the much quoted In Flanders Fields achieves it by sheer simplicity and concentration in the expression of a moving and tragic appeal Another poem on the same motive a living soldier s address to The Anxious Dead is perhaps still finer and its quatrains fit the subject better than the too slight rondeau form of the first Here it is minus the final rather inadequate stanza  O guns fall silent till the dead men hear Above their heads the legions pressing on These fought their fight in time of bitter fear And died not knowing how the day had gone O flashing muzzles pause and let them see The coming dawn that streaks the sky afar   Then let your mighty chorus witness be To them and Caesar that we still make war Tell them O guns that we have heard their call That we have sworn and will not turn aside That we will onward till we win or fall That we will keep the faith for which they died  McCrae who was about forty years old and a Lieutenant Colonel in the Canadian medical service when he died of pneumonia in France will be remembered for these two poems and possibly also the sonnet on death Mine Host  Lieutenant Mackintosh of the Seaforth Highlanders who was killed in action on the Western Front at the age of twenty four is also a questioner of death His two books are full of the subject he was haunted by the living presence of the dead The best of these Beaumont Hamel Three Battles From Home In Memoriam deserve a good place in the war anthologies deserve it for their delicate touch upon the most intimate emotion as in this poem the third of the Three Battles  Not for the day of victory I mourn I was not there The hard fierce rush of slaying men The hands up in the air  But for the torn ranks struggling on The old brave hopeless way The broken charge the slow retreat  And I so far away  And listening to the tale of Roeux I think I see again The steady grim despairing ranks The courage and the pain The bodies of my friends that lie Unburied in the dew   Other Poets of the War  O friends of mine and I not there To die along with you  Besides these war poems among the most direct and tragically appealing that I have read Mackintosh s two volumes contain earlier work the promising practice verse of an enthusiastic young Celt who might have proved his mettle as a poet if the war had spared him  In Sea dogs and Men at Arms Jesse Edgar Middleton at least presents in his opening poem The Canadian the point of view of our colonial neighbors to the north I never saw the cliffs of snow he sings the Island of my dream  And still the name of England Which tyrants laugh to scorn Can thrill my soul It is to me A very bugle horn But the book does little else Nor does En Repos and Elsewhere Over There verses written in France by Lansing Warren and Robert A Donaldson attempt anything beyond journalism mostly humorous journalism But some of the pieces are extremely good of their kind En Repos Allies Communiqués and Envoi for example These two young Americans hit off cleverly the dough boy sentiment and sense of fun When we pass from the work of soldiers to war verse written by outsiders we usually encounter a different note Soldiers even when they accept ready made the most conventional ideas of war write from intimate personal experience But the outsiders are usually making poetry out   of an imaginative experience too clogged with theory or with the common over worked sentimentality Even Mary Carolyn Davies makes one a little impatient her book plays up too easily the proper sentiments of soldier boys their sweethearts mothers and chums At Wipers and Calvary and On Leave in a Strange Little Town for example are almost tricky in their sentimental appeal Miss Davies whose best verse expresses a high free girlishness will lose her artistic sincerity if she doesn t stop demanding too much of it Not often in The Drums in Our Street her first book does she utter a cry as poignant as in this brief poem  The Great War  Youth crucified to save the world  Hangs on the cross and to the sky  Utters while thunderbolts are hurled  A fearful cry  Who has betrayed him Each one asks  Low Is it I  Angela Morgan s book Forward March is rhetoric unashamed marching down well worn high roads of war sentiment love sentiment nature sentiment Here for example is the beginning of Resurgam  Out of the graves a Summons  Out of the ruins a Voice  O children of men  Tis the hour again  Of earth s primeval choice  Whether to drift supinely  Where chaos rides unfurled  Or gird the will divinely  To re create the world  And Irwin St John Tucker does no better with The   Other Poets of the War  Chosen Nation even though he sets forth his socialistic theme in Elizabethan trappings an hundred and five Spenserian stanzas Neither Miss Morgan s orthodoxy nor Mr St John s heterodoxy in the troublous affairs of this world can make a poet The latter says in his Foreword  The poem contains in condensed form all that I know of history and likewise my view of the present situation and hope of the future  And yet in spite of such an all inclusive lofty motive here is the utmost Mr St John s muse can achieve  Now O thou young Republic girt with stars  Whose spacious territories hailed us here  Thou wert God s trust from hate recurrent wars  To show the way how peace may persevere  How men be cleansed of hate and greed and fear  How federated states in one may dwell  Seeking one good through ends of earth brought near  Thy words indeed are high but guard thou well  By deeds belying words thy predecessors fell And so forth to the bitter end  There has been much complaint of the poets because none of them has yet achieved a Divine Tragedy of the war But it may be in the heart of the muse of war to give the world not an epic solo but a lyric chorus and we may hear already a good many fine clear voices singing over the battlefields the flags and the graves H M  A FREE SPIRIT  Twenty by Stella Benson Macmillan Co Wha t one gets chiefly from these poems is the impression of a liberated spirit There is not the sensuous enjoyment one   expects of poetry What one retains is the philosophy rather than the rounded aesthetic emotion of poetry which exists of itself and is yet not exclusive of the author s personal philosophy as well Yet one may well be grateful for the underlying humanness of this verse and for the quality of humor courage and perception revealed This let us believe is feminism of an enlightened kind and the word is not used in the sense of political propaganda Miss Benson has a light satirical humor more effective in that it is light as in Redneck s Song To the Unborn or The New Zion Many of our male satirists lose force because of the heaviness of attack The lunge exceeds the object or like an icicle grown too heavy it falls of its own weight As a contribution to feminine psychology the reader may be referred to such poems as The Secret Day New Year I918 or The Woman Alone from which we quote the first two stanzas  My eyes are girt with outer mists My ears sing shrill and this I bless My finger nails do bite my fists In ecstasy of loneliness This I intend and this I want That passing you may only mark A dumb soul with its confidant Entombed together in the dark  The hoarse church bells of London ring The hoarser horns of London croak The poor brown lives of London cling About the poor brown streets like smoke The deep air stands above my roof Like water to the floating stars My Friend and I we sit aloof We sit and smile and bind our scars  This will hardly avail to give an adequate impression of   A Free Spirit  the author s spirit but it is an inkling There is a secret meaning in many of Miss Benson s poems not to be discerned by all who run but of more than casual importance for those who read and understand A C H  OUR CONTEMPORARIES  GEORGES DUHAMEL RETURNS  The enlightened poetry editor of the Mercure de France has returned to his post vacant since the war claimed him for inspirational work among wounded soldiers From his introductory article in the issue of April 16th we quote a few sentences  C est maintenant que les poètes vont nous dire si la guerre doit faire jaillir d autres sources que celles du sang et des larmes C est maintenant qu il nous sera peut être donné d entendre le chant rude simple et si triste qui seul pourra s élever à la hauteur des hommes de ce temps  Jamais la muse française ne fut aussi féconde jamais d ailleurs en dépit des difficultés de l heure présente elle ne fut peut être plus luxueusement secondée par l art du typographe ou du graveur  Nous aurons donc beaucoup de travail et du plus délicat et du plus difficile De tout mon coeur je souhaiterais que ce travail ne fut jamais pénible et qu il ne servit jamais à la discorde C est une incroyable ambition Pour vivre la critique a besoin plus encore d être passionnée que d être juste Et des lors comment n engendrerait elle point la mésentente et le ressentiment Je suis pourtant bien résolu à ne pas commencer une autre guerre Je suis pourtant bien résolu d autre part a dire droitement mon avis a ceux qui m auront fait l honneur de me le demander  Criticism needs even more to be impassioned than to be just this message from one of the finest critics now living may be passed on to certain neutral minded purveyors of opinion in American newspapers   THE P S A COLUMBIA PRIZES  The second award of the annual let us hope it is an annual prize of five hundred dollars offered by the Poetry Society of America and Columbia University for the best book of verse published in the United States during the last calendar year in this case the year 1918 was announced in New York June 6th  The prize is split in two Carl Sandburg receives half of it for Cornhuskers and Margaret Widdemer half for The Old Road to Paradise Henry Holt amp Co score also as they published both books  The result is evidently a compromise and all lovers of the art may thank the kind fates that Carl Sandburg got even a look in at any prize for which William Lyon Phelps and Richard Burton formed two thirds of the jury of award The third member was Sara Teasdale the prize winner of last year who is as competent in criticism as she is in the art itself and who has long been an ardent admirer of Carl Sandburg s work  The result emphasizes the point so often insisted on by POETRY that all such juries of award should consist entirely of professionals that is of poets For years architects painters and sculptors have been fighting to establish this rule in all competitions to a great extent with success Poets should follow their example This rule would have relieved the committee of Mr Phelps whose recent book The Advance of English Poetry in the Twentieth Century proves him an incompetent It is to laugh that he should have had   The P S A Columbta Prizes  a place on such a jury Mr Burton though hardly a leader in the art is at least a poet  POETRY may be permitted to smile in remembering the clamor of journalistic guffaws which greeted its award of the initial Levinson Prize to Carl Sandburg s first POETRY entry Chicago Poems his first appearance anywhere as a poet This prize was awarded in November 1914 CORRESPONDENCE  IN SOUTH AMERICA  Dear POETRY DO you ever listen to our southern neighbors  In Rio
