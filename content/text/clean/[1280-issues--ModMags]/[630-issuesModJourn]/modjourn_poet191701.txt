fendered  bow  Bumped with soft splash against the wharf  though now Again within the Yard a hammer rang A solitary hammer striking steel Somewhere aloft and strangely stridently Echoed as though it struck the steely sky The low cold steely sky  She seemed to feel That hammer in her heart blow after blow In a strange clanging hollow seemed to strike Monotonous unrelenting cruel like Her heart that such a little while ago Had been so full so happy with its news Scarce uttered even to itself   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  It stopped That dreadful hammer And the silence dropped Again a moment Then a clatter of shoes And murmur of voices as the men trooped out And as each wife with basket and hot can Hurried towards the gate to meet her man She too ran forward and then stood in doubt Because among them all she could not see The face that usually was first of all To meet her eyes  Against the grimy wall That towered black above her to the sky With trembling knuckles to the cold stone pressed Till the grit seemed to eat into the bone And her stretched arm to shake the solid stone She stood and strove to calm her troubled breast Her breast whose trouble of strange happiness So sweet and so miraculous as she Had stood among the chattering company Upon the ferry boat to strange distress Was changed An unknown terror seemed to lie For her behind that wall so cold and hard And black above her in the unseen Yard Dreadfully quiet now  Then with a sigh Of glad relief she ran towards the gate As he came slowly out the last of all   The News  The terror of the hammer and the wall Fell from her as a woman to her mate She moved with happy heart and smile of greeting A young and happy wife whose only thought Was whether he would like the food she d brought Whose one desire to watch her husband eating  With a grave smile he took his bait from her And then without a word they moved away To where some grimy baulks of timber lay Beside the river and twas quieter Than in the crowd of munching squatting men And chattering wives and children As he eat With absent eyes upon the river set She chattered too a little now and then Of household happenings and then silently They sat and watched the grimy flowing stream Dazed by the stunning din of hissing steam Escaping from an anchored boat hard by Each busy with their own thoughts who till now Had shared each thought each feeling speaking out Easily eagerly without a doubt As innocent happy children anyhow The innermost secrets of their wedded life So as the dinner hour went swiftly by They sat there for the first time troubled shy A silent husband a silent wife   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  But she was only troubled by excess Of happiness and as she watched the stream She looked upon her life as in a dream Recalling all its tale of happiness Unbroken and unshadowed since she d met Her man the first time eighteen months ago   A keen blue day with sudden flaws of snow And sudden sunshine when she first had set Her wondering eyes upon him gaily clad For football in a jersey green and red Knees bare beneath white shorts his curly head Wind blown and wet and knew him for her lad He strode towards her down the windy street The wet gray pavements flashing sudden gold And gold the unending coils of smoke that rolled Unceasingly overhead fired by a fleet Wild glint of glancing sunlight On he came Beside her brother still a raw uncouth Young hobbledehoy a strapping mettled youth In the first pride of manhood that wild flame Touching his hair to fire his cheeks aglow With the sharp stinging wind his arms aswing And as she watched she felt the tingling sting Of flying flakes and in a whirl of snow A moment he was hidden from her sight  It passed and then before she was aware With white flakes powdering his ruddy hair   The News  He stood before her laughing in the light In all his bravery of red and green Snow sprinkled And she laughed too in the sun They laughed and in that laughter they were one  Now as with kindled eyes on the unseen Gray river she sat gazing she again Lived through that moment in a golden dream And then quite suddenly she saw the stream Distinct in its cold grimy flowing Then The present with its deeper happiness Thrilled her afresh this wonder strange and new This dream in her young body coming true Incredible yet certain none the less This news scarce broken to herself that she Must break to him She longed to see his eyes Kindle to hear it happy with surprise When she should break it to him presently  But she must wait a while yet Still too strange Too wonderful for words she could not share  Even with him her secret He sat there So quietly little dreaming of the change That had come over her But when he knew For he was always one for bairns was John And this would be his own their own There shone A strange new light on all sin e this was true All all seemed strange the river and the shore   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  The barges and the wharves with timber piled And all her world familiar from a child Was as a world she d never seen before  And he too sat with eyes upon the stream Remembering that day when first the light Of her young eyes with laughter sparkling bright Kindled to his and as he caught the gleam The life within him quickened suddenly To fire and in a world of golden laughter They stood alone together and then after When he was playing with his mates and he Hurtled headlong towards the goal he knew Her eyes were on him and for her alone Who had the merriest eyes he d ever known He played that afternoon Though until then He d only played to please himself somehow She seemed to have a hold upon him Now  No longer a boy a man among grown men  He d never have a thought apart from her  From her his mate   And then that golden night When in a whirl of melody and light Her merry brown eyes flashing merrier They rode together in a gilded car That seemed to roll forever round and round In a blind blaze of light and blare of sound For ever and for ever till afar   The News  It seemed to bear them from the surging throng Of lads and lasses happy in release From the week s work in yards and factories For ever through a land of light and song While they sat rapt in silence hand in hand And looked into each other s merry eyes They two together whirled through Paradise A golden glittering unearthly land A land where light and melody were one And melody and light a golden fire That ran through their young bodies and desire A golden music streaming from the sun Filling their veins with golden melody And singing fire   And then when quiet fell And they together with so much to tell So much to tell each other instantly Left the hot throng and roar and glare behind Seeking the darker streets and stood at last In a dark lane where footsteps seldom passed Lit by a far lamp and one glowing blind That seemed to make the darkness yet more dark Between the cliffs of houses black and high That soared above them to the starry sky A deep blue sky where spark on fiery spark The stars for them were kindled as they raised Their eyes in new born wonder to the night And in a solitude of cold starlight   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  They stood alone together hushed and gazed Into each other s eyes until speech came And underneath the stars they talked and talked   Then he remembered how they two had walked Along a beach that was one golden flame Of yellow sand beside a flame blue sea The day they wedded that strange day of dream One flame of blue and gold   The murky stream Flowed once again before his eyes and he Dropped back into the present and he knew That he must break the news that suddenly Had come to him last night as drowsily He lay beside her startling stern and true Out of the darkness flashing He must tell How as he lay beside her in the night His heart had told him he must go and fight Must throw up everything he loved so well To go and fight in lands across the sea Beside the other lads must throw up all His work his home   The shadow of the wall Fell on her once again and stridently That hammer struck her heart as from the stream She raised her eyes to his and saw their flame Then back into her heart her glad news came As John smiled on her and her golden dream   The News  Once more was all about her as she thought Of home the new home that the future held For them they three together Fear was quelled By this new happiness that all unsought Had sprung from the old happiness   And he Watching her thought of home too When he stepped With her across the threshold first and slept That first night in her arms so quietly For the first time in all his life he d known All that home meant or nearly all for yet Each night brought him new knowledge as she met Him smiling on the clean white threshold stone When he returned from labor in the Yard And she d be waiting for him soon while he Was fighting with his fellow oversea She would be waiting for him   It was hard For him that he must go as go he must But harder far for her things always fell Harder upon the women It was well She didn t dream yet He could only trust She too would feel that he had got to go Then twould not be so hard to go and yet Dreaming he saw the lamplit table set With silver pot and cups and plates aglow For tea in their own kitchen bright and snug With her behind the tea pot saw it all   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  The colored calendars upon the wall The bright fire irons and the gay hearth rug She d made herself from bright hued rags his place Awaiting him with something hot and hot His favorite sausages as like as not Between two plates for him as with clean face Glowing from washing in the scullery And such a hunger on him he would sink Content into his chair   Twas strange to think All this was over and so suddenly Twas strange and hard   Still gazing on the stream Her thoughts too were at home She heard the patter Of tiny feet beside her and the chatter Of little tongues   Then loudly through their dream The buzzer boomed and all about them rose The men and women soon the wives were on The ferry boat now puffing to be gone The husbands hurrying ere the gates should close Back to the Yard   She in her dream of gold And he in his new desolation stood Then soberly as wife and husband should They parted with their news as yet untold  Wilfrid Wilson Gibson   A LETTER OF FAREWELL  Mother little mother They will tell you After they have shot me at sunrise I died a coward It is not true little mother You will believe me  You know how we marched away Banners bright bayonets the Marseillaise I shut up the old chansons Ah my diplome France needed her sons for war We waited aching for the hour At last it came I had my turn in the trenches  I won t tell you all What it meant to learn the new trade A scholar was I and young Youth died in me And all the old epics the beautiful songs long silent Ah that was another life At first it sickened me The torn flesh bleeding the horrible bodies long dead The ruined towns sprawling like toothless hags The mud the lice the stenches   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  The stupefying noise A crashing of damned worlds And then the command to kill At first the loathing was a vomit in my heart  Then something rose in me From the abyss Life the great cannibal Killing and feeding on death I was his workman through ten million years I ran to the slaughter singing I killed with a shout The red rage sucked me up In its whirlwind Dashed me on dancing feet Against the enemy The enemy everlasting And my life tossed on bayonets Blown against guns  Staked like a last piece of gold on the hundredth chance Always my life came back to me unscathed  Was it man to man The haughty beauty of war I grew numb at last I felt no more I slipped off man s pride like a garment A rotten rag It was brute to brute in a wallow of blood and filth   A Letter of Farewell  And so in that last charge on Thiaumont Little shattered city Lost and won won and lost Day after day In the interminable battle In that hot rush I killed three Boches Stuck them like squeaking pigs The soft flesh sputtering The nick of the steel at bones I felt them no more than the crunch of an insect under my  foot In the old days Then I fell worn out Under a wall Hungry thirsty listless My gun dropped from my hand I could not rise Perhaps my eyes closed  When life came back a big Boche was standing over me He had my gun but his face was kind I thought you were dead he said and stood looking at me Then he unscrewed his canteen Drink he said poor little one I won t kill you  I sprang up as tall as he and took his hand Babbling It s foolish business why should we   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  I m through with it And a great strength rose in me And a white light filled me Waves of unbearable love washed over me And I knew I could fight no more  The charge had rolled on I slipped away Crying It is over over forever men shall kill no more I shouted the news I summoned the soldiers The tongues of fire came down upon me Let the guns rot I said And the cannon rust Look in your brother s eyes And clasp his hand  So they took me and tried me And I must die But for telling the truth Not for what they say It will surely be little mother The sin that was little at first In the savage forest When men fought with clubs The sin we have gorged and glutted With gases and bombs And machine guns   A Letter of Farewell  And battle ships of sea and air It has grown heavy and monstrous It will be cast off like the plague There will be a new nation No one shall stop us from loving each other So goodby little mother I don t mind dying for it That nation I see it Harriet Monroe SEEDTIM E Not too deep

leaves And turn the hard gray soil to brown  Striding he measures out the earth  In lines of life to rain and sun And every year that comes to birth  Sees him still striding on and on  The seasons change and then return  Yet still in blind unsparing ways  However I may shrink or yearn The ploughman measures out my days  His acre brought forth roots last year This year it bears the gleamy grain Next spring shall seedling grass appear Then roots and corn and grass again  Five times the young corn s pallid green I have seen spread and change and thrill Five times the reapers I have seen Go creeping up the far off hill  And as the unknowing ploughman climbs Slowly and inveterately 1 wonder long how many times The corn will spring again for me  Gordon Bottomley   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  POEMS  MY LADY SURRENDERS  How did She abdicate Was it with soft sighs And pretty feignings of a lover s state Or was it solemn wise With altar offerings and rapt vows Oh no when Love himself was there Most housewifely she bound her hair And was off across the fields to milk the cows  THE SILENCE  When I meet you I greet you with a stare Like a poor shy child at a fair I will not let you love me yet am I weak I love you so intensely that I cannot speak When you are gone I stand apart And whisper to your image in my heart  SENTIMENTS  Windswept from where they grew These tender flowers lie dead How many things were true Had they been left unsaid   Completion  COMPLETION  The man is made as a machine He is as efficient as a new gun And in his light is the full spectrum seen He is my God my lover and my son  AFTER ANNUNCIATION  Rest little guest Beneath my breast Feed sweet seed At your need I took Love for my lord And this is my reward My body is good earth That you dear plant have birth  Anna Wickham   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  A MAN  Often when I would sit a dreamy straight haired child A book held gaping on my knee Watering a sterile romance with my thoughts You would come bounding to the curb And startle me to life You sat so straight upon your vibrant horse That lovely horse all silken fire and angry grace And yet you seemed so merged in him So like At least my thoughts Gave you a measure of that wildness And oh for many years you seemed to me Something to marvel at and yet to fear  But now I know that you resemble most That growth in nature that you most revere You are so like so very like a tree Grown straight and strong and beautiful With many leaves The years but add in richness to your boughs You make a noble pattern on the sky About your rugged trunk Vines creep and lichens cling And children play at tag Upon your branches some will hang their load And rest and cool while you must brave the sun But you put forth new life with every year   A Man  And tower nearer to the clouds And never bend or grow awry  I wonder what sweet water bathes your roots And if you gain your substance from the earth Or if you have a treaty with the sun Or keep some ancient promise with the heavens  RAIN  I have always hated the rain And the gloom of grayed skies But now I think I must always cherish Rain hung leaf and the misty river And the friendly screen of dripping green Where eager kisses were shyly given And your pipe smoke made clouds in our damp close heaven  The curious laggard passed us by His wet shoes soughed on the shining walk And that afternoon was filled with a blurred glory That afternoon when we first talked as lovers  Jean Starr Untermeyer   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  ANACREONTIC  Do ye mock me wantons that I come among ye Drunken bedecked with garlands Like a white sacrificial bull Laugh then So Cypris laughing shake one petal down From her rose braided hair Honeyed with kisses be profuse The glowing purple that brims up this gold Laugh then and mock but kiss me for what man Would come among ye sober Wise I come Borne on Silenus ass to praise Eros  Frederic Manning   T O A MOUNTAI N PIN E O lonely pine Upon your granite cliff I know your pain Tossing your weird arms To the mighty winds Beating your ragged breast With shrunken hands I know your pain For I have stood On such high dawn kissed peaks And flung my arms And beat with futile hands Because I still was held To stone and clod By sullen roots Of unremembered lives Anna Spencer Twitchell   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  SURVIVORS  On a sea island s green and swaying world Satiric Time heaps treasures and the shore Far to the waves echoes an old dismay For heavy along it certain moths lie curled Weapons and mouths they have but little more And whosoever sees them looks away  Yet once that race envied the sky with tears And their mornings and their evenings grew Until the mightiest flashed in wings of light Ravished with blood up from the creeping years To beat against the floor of heaven and through And pour down daysprings gloriously bright  Mad butterflies that hour a wind prepared Emptied the air of all and they were drowned And the sea moaned that washed their holy wings But these the wingless these who never dared Went warm and safe and fat upon the ground And later in due season put forth stings  Ridgely Torrence   TOWARD CHILDHOOD  Backward O Time and for a single hour Make a small child of him who stands before us At the advanced age of seventy five Leander M Coggswell multimillionaire  In days when gross wealth drugs the very atmosphere It would be vain to guard these present lines from its insidi  ous approach Shall I seem to overdo If I give Mr C one hundred millions Very well they re his  He lives today in semi retirement And has forgotten partly how the money came Completely so if asked officially Others have now bent their backs to the great burden He no longer keeps tab he tells us on the workings of the  vast machine  He buys now and then a picture a coronet a castle He smiles impartially on the great and on the small On the heedless and on the inquisitive Reads detective stories And plays croquet  Now let us make him a little younger We strip him first of his bland leisure   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  And of his more puerile interests Five years ago yes even less He was aflame to found to furnish to fill His great museum He the modern Medici Cosimo and Lorenzo in one Books manuscripts madonnas choked his days Art and learning walked captive at his heels  But Caesar never grew so great you say Upon such meat as that Of course not There was a previous period A phantasmagoric jumble of varied interests Filled the public air all was kept aloft By superhuman skill and all was juggled Just a bit too swiftly for the questioning eye to follow Even for the interested orb Of the Uncle of us all Banks foundries railways tanks stock market state leg  islatures what you will Everything brought about with suave and Mephistophelean  mien By the great thaumaturge While deft assistants at the lesser tables Passed on the properties and dressed the scene  Peeling away still further from our friend His years dexterity and grandeur We find him on a lower stage   Toward Childhood  Before a poorer audience Doing less skilfully and on a smaller scale The tricks that made the man himself It seems viewed restrospectively a mere rehearsal Of his immense Performance Here industrious thrifty and alert  To give his qualities their better names He practiced in semi privacy and with no possibility of  praise The qualities he lauded later In pamphlets and addresses aimed at the nation s youth  Back still farther No company now no firm Just a lone young individual Of parentage blent and non distinguished let us say With a young helpmate of his own kind Both struggling together for a foothold Both putting forth their strained endeavors To feed and clothe a little flock And to get on  Next go his wife and children W e have left now only a young clerk or handy man Of lingo semi rustic semi foreign semi citified quite as you  like Moling away beneath the surface Yet coming up at intervals   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  To see the Main Chance shining in the sky Holding his own and more against all youthful rivals And shaping vigorously the grand ideals Which later were to fire his heart and ours  Next we deprive him of his office stool Or of his chance to labor hardily out in the sheds He s but a boy at school Quick quick with slate and pencil Sharp sharp among the playground s crowd  Next knee trousers go W e have a child of four in laughable habiliments Preserved by some uncouth disciple of Daguerre And later shown in half tones For the derisive adoration of the world But with a look sly and determined in the eyes Which promises much  Now but an infant in arms Borne in long convoluted skirts Oh what a forehead cries a visiting aunt Pushing the frilled cap back And kissing such brows mothers have often said with awe He may be president  Lastly a new born babe Hugged close within a home   Toward Childhood  On some elm shaded street Or in some slattern village farther west Or in some stony cabin far beyond our bounds  Can we go on Yes with Wordsworth who has Intimations And who may have bestowed on him Long streamers of supernal or infernal glory Or with Kant who has Innate Ideas And who may well have packed the baby full Of pre accumulated notions and experiences Or with Galton who cracks up Heredity And who may have presented a complete outfit Of traits passed on from linked forefathers Or with Taine who comes out strongly for Environment And who perhaps decreed our babe should be Entirely what Surroundings made him Modern opinion and current fashion May favor this last notion still  Thus our new born hero came at once Within a range of influences and waiting opportunities Which caused his Life to follow As easily and inevitably As a corollary upon a theorem proved As naturally as some prepotent cloud Careering through the littered heavens Helps weave strange disconcerting patterns on earth s fields   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  H m Are we not all clouds together Minor cirri dumpy cumuli Multitudinous shreds of vapor Rosy or gray That float or drive about in tiny tatters And some fixed fault within the national sky Prevents a

days  Through the war the spirit of man is to be  reborn we are told the costly red fertilizer  so lavishly poured out is to enrich the soil  of the new era so that souls will grow to nobler stature than is possible from the dry and weedy sod of peace Materialism and individualism are to be swept away and society is to unite for the common good is to organize and function with complete precision and with elimination of waste so that the rate of its progress will be to the past as a racing automobile is to the mail coach of our fathers or the ox cart of our grandfathers  The arts are to share in this rebirth we are led to hope A new purpose will consecrate our poets painters musicians architects a new glamour will glorify their dreams They will be caught up by the vast world encompassing current and carried along with irresistible force toward a goal of unimaginable splendor The human race thus far has groped in the dark divided confined chained Now it is just awaking rising casting off its shackles Freed by this war all but federated by its sacrificial agonies men and nations are just about to begin their militant march toward the common goal of a universal state organized for joy and beauty through mutual service and universal brotherhood   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  It may be that we should hear some such music as that in the New Year chimes For the men in the trenches for the maimed the dying the bereaved it is perhaps the only adequate consolation this hope that out of their blood drenched earth will spring a more glorious world But one can not help wondering whether the prophets are not led by the modern speed mania to apply to things of the spirit material laws  What will be the effect will it be creative or destructive of all this vast energizing of the race upon those men and women of genius who must in the future as the past be its leaders Humanity can not move faster or further than its greatest souls will the great souls of the new era have a chance to develop to full power through a childhood and youth geared up to the highest tension strain and will they find room for free and adequate action of brain and muscle in the pushing surging driven world of the new ideal designed to ignore and so obliterate all power which it can not immediately use And how will the artists of the future live through the universal roar and rush and find the quiet place and hour to dream in and grow wise  Much brooding on these questions seemed to take form and substance at the first Chicago production of Intolerance  D W Griffith s prodigious new movie which Vachel Lindsay a movie fan who has written a book on the new art calls the most wonderful and idealistic and mystical of all   The New Era  photo dramas the climax of cinema achievement What was it to me who not being a movie fan brought a fresh mind to the contemplation of this climactic amazing phenomenon  What was it it was a reductio ad absurdum of the speed mania it was an insanely de vitalizing and de energizing spectacle which jumbled up in one indigestible mixture the fall of Babylon a modern execution the Crucifixion and the massacre of St Bartholomew It ran these four parallel stories together at three second intervals for three hours making thirty six hundred jerks from one story to another thirty six hundred leaps for each agitated human brain The process was so athletic for at least one of the audience that the three crosses the imposing Babylonian walls Catherine de Medici and the modern trains and motors these last on a mad chase to save the virtuous hero from the scaffold were all plunging together down into the abyss not only that evening but for two three nights thereafter in the form of nightmare  Is this the art of the future Will there be any consecu tiveness any coherence in the life which it expresses any creative power in the minds which it spirals like a whirlwind Will the new era be an age of perpetual motion with the cinema audaciously sublimely efficient reeling off art and literature  In that case what will become of poetry and POETRY It is with some perturbation of spirit that we salute the new age and wish our readers a Happy New Year  H M   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  APPRECIATION  One of the privileges of working in a center of poetic influence like POETRY is that we are constantly made aware of the ever growing and deepening love of beauty that is stirring in the American people Through a hundred incidents great and small it comes to us daily There are times when beauty in this case the specific beauty of the written word seems almost visibly present with us and we can feel it spreading its slender leaves in the sun and striking strong white roots deep into the lives of the people  This feeling has been wakened in us of late by a movement which is springing up all over the country a movement whose results can hardly be estimated but which may well be a harbinger of the true golden age of American poetry  This movement goes back to the fountain head to the schools where the new generation is being formed Children are being taught more and more that poetry is something to be loved unquestioningly not something to be dissected pulled to pieces and hated And one of the means by which this is accomplished is the giving of time in school to the writing of verse by the children They are given pencil paper and the assurance that they will not be laughed at something which all too often has not been given in the past and no further restrictions If the result is seldom perhaps we should say never really poetry the after effects in love and appreciation of the art are incalculable Whatever we have ourselves tried to do even unsuccessfully is ever after a source of keen pleasure and the creation of an   Appreciation  audience such as these children will be in a few years may well call forth the great American poet whose wings have not yet lifted  From all over the country indications come to us of this movement From the High School of Pasadena has come a little printed volume of the work of the boys and girls compiled by Miss Isabel Frazee From a little town in the south eastern Cumberlands in Kentucky twenty odd miles from a railroad a town called Hindman has come an account by Miss Berenice K van Slyke of similar work in her English classes which has produced unusually good results from these isolated and so unsophisticated children At least two schools in Chicago the Francis Parker and the Chicago Latin Schools are doing similar work with their youngsters and there are of course many more of whom no word has reached us  Another movement which represents a different phase of the question but which is also sure to have wide spread results is the recent appointment by the General Federation of Women s Clubs a federation which includes among its members over three million women of a new committee on poetry Mrs Martha Foote Crow is chairman of this committee which is planning a nation wide campaign for study and appreciation of poetry among the women  The potentiality of the American people both in the creation of poetry and in appreciation of the art is only now beginning to be realized and we who were among the pioneers are feeling the great joy of seeing our work advance among the people at large E T   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  POETRY AND ORATORY  The difference between poetry and oratory is shortly this The poet aims at using language in an intense way and intensity is his product while the orator aims at using language in an exalted way and exaltation is his product Of course there is exaltation in poetry and there is intensity in oratory but the poet is not seeking for exaltation and the orator is not seeking for intensity The use of language in an exalted way however is always associated with the office of the poet and so it is easy to make oratory appear as poetry it is especially easy to make it appear as poetry when the orators deliver their addresses in verse Pope and Byron lived in an age of great orators and what they wrote in verse is amongst the great orations of their time  Lo the poor Indian whose untutored mind Sees God in clouds or hears him in the wind  That is the opening of a great oration And in Byron s long poems we get the very gestures of the orator Stop for thy tread is on an Empire s dust An earthquake s spoil is sepulchred below Is the spot marked by no heroic bust Nor column trophied for triumphal show  Oratory is the thing heard poetry is the thing overheard this aphorism suggests better than a whole chapter of analysis the difference between poetry and oratory Oratory deals with public things poetry deals with the secret things in the life of man Poetry to make use of a phrase of Turgenev s is the innuendo by which the soul makes known its enormous claim Oratory asserts the less   Poetry and Oratory  enormous claim for country or for friends We are made to feel that the poem could exist without an auditor but we know that the oration whether in prose or verse could not exist without the audience  Here is part of an oration from a volume I have been reading Irish Oratory The speaker John Philpot Curran is defending a man against whom the government has brought informers for witnesses Curran speaks of the informer as the wretch that is buried a man lies till his heart has time to fester and is then dug up a witness and then goes on  Have you not seen him after his resurrection from that tomb after having been dug out of the region of death and corruption make his appearance upon the table the living image of life and death and the supreme arbiter of both Have you not marked when he entered how the stormy wave of the multitude retired at his approach Have you not marked how the human heart bowed to the supremacy of his power in the undissembled homage of deferential horror How his glance like the lightning of heaven seemed to rive the body of the accused while his voice warned the devoted wretch of woe and death a death which no innocence can escape no force resist no antidote prevent  After reading this fine passage of oratory I think of Curran s single poem The Deserter s Meditation the poem which suggested to Byron the Gaelic measure that he used in one of his best lyrics  If sadly thinking with spirits sinking  Could more than drinking my cares compose  A cure for sorrow from thought I d borrow  In hopes to morrow would end my woes  But as in wailing there s nought availing  And Death unfailing will strike the blow  Then for that reason and for a season  Let us be merry before we go POETRY A Magazine of Verse  To joy a stranger a wayworn ranger In every danger my course I ve run Now joys all ending and Death befriending His last aid lending my life is done No more a rover nor hapless lover My days are over my glass runs low Then for that reason and for a season Let us be merry before we go  In this song there is no audience in view and no exaltation is sought The poem has intensity and through the lines comes something of the secret of a life  Padraic Colum  REVIEWS  FROST AND MASTERS  Mountain Interval by Robert Frost Henry Holt amp Co The Great Valley by Edgar Lee Masters Macmillan Co  In Kipling s story of primitive men the bard becomes a thing of awe because he can tell the tale of the tribe can save the tribe from engulfing oblivion by making words run up and down in men s hearts words that move too grandly to be forgotten In the final accounting perhaps this is the first function of the bard even more his office than the setting of dreams to magic measures  These two poets Frost and Masters are telling the tale of the tribe the varying tales of their separate tribes and the simultaneous appearance of their latest books tempts one to comparison and contrast Reading the two books as a whole without stopping for details one gets an overpowering impression not only of two different individuals   Frost and Masters  but of two different crowds In Frost Puritan New England speaks with a voice as absolute as New Hampshire s granite hills Whittier wandered there once singing a few songs and Emerson from those slopes looked inward and outward for truth But neither of these felt New England as Frost feels it  In the same way Masters tells the tale of his tribe We have had we have now other poets of the Middle West Whitman of course included this vast pioneer peopled plain in his sublimated vision of These States as a cosmic democracy Riley and Eugene Field both town lovers hardly aware of Mother Earth delighted in and to a certain extent individualized the traditional rural types of this region types handed down from Mark Twain Bill Nye and other great humorists Vachel Lindsay loves the Middle West like a big brother pleads with it sings of and to it glorifies it with troubadour poems making it picturesque weaving a glamour around it And Carl Sandburg loves Chicago and its sea hearted lake knows it intimately as a cosmopolis But perhaps none of these has got this particular region into his blood and bones so deeply as Mr Masters who was raised in one of its typical villages and who lives in its typical great city  Yankees are what they always were sings Mr Frost His New England is the same old New England of the pilgrim fathers a harsh austere velvet coated granite earth bringing forth rigid narrow heroic men and women hard but with unexpected softnesses Their religion has been   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  modified since Cotton Mather but not their character at least not the character of those who stay on their farms resisting the call of the West and the lure of towns To present this earth these people the poet employs usually a blank verse as massive as they as stript of all apologies and adornments His poetry is sparing austere even a bit crabbed at times but now and then it lights up with a sudden and intimate beauty a beauty springing from lifelong love and intuition as in these images of trees from two different poems  A resurrected tree A tree that had been down and raised again A barkless spectre he had halted too As if for fear of treading upon me  She had no saying dark enough For the dark pine that kept Forever trying the window latch Of the room where they slept  Nature is always thus an integral part of Mr Frost s human dramas not a mere background but one of the cast It is wonderful how he builds up the terrific winter tempest in Snow for example and does it not by mere statement but through the talk of those delicately contrasted characters the dry skeptical wife the slower matter of fact husband and the deep breathing deep dreaming evangelist lover of life and the storm And a springtime passion for the earth with human life yes and brute life as a part of it burns in such poems as In the Home Stretch Putting in the Seed Birches and The Cow in Apple Time   Frost and Masters  It is appropriate no doubt that Masters should be less selective than Frost the West is less reserved than New England Against Frost s one hundred pages we have nearly three hundred from Masters and The Great Valley is his second book of this year The watchful critic must regret much of it especially he must wonder to the extreme of amazement why the poet should have reverted to Marsyas and Apollo at Pherae which are in the mood of those early books whose academic unexpressiveness will always be one of the curiosities of literature But one must take a poet as he is and this poet has to pour out whatever is in his heart and leave his readers or Father Time to do the sifting He has to do this moreover in a spirit of careless abundance which throws off magic lines in a mass of coarser texture flowers grasses and weeds together under a brilliant and generous procreative sun  But this is the prairie s exuberant way one must look at this poet not in close detail but in the mass Thus one may get from him as from the prairies themselves a sense of space and richness One feels in him too the idealistic vision of a man accustomed to far horizons that impatience with things near things more or less faithless to the imminent beauty and that relief in the contemplation of things remote beauty s survivals or prophecies  This chaotic half baked civilization growing up out of these broad and fruitful plains into dull little towns and mad great cities all fitfully inadequately spiritualized this one feels in Mr Masters books One feels also a deep   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  and tragic love of it a thwarted but rooted faith in it which cannot be destroyed by all the messy materialism the soul wasting efficiency which he sees around him His great valley is dominated by the gigantic sombre figure of Lincoln the Autochthon of his dream Lincoln who ever renews his power in the imagination of the people growing greater like the elder Titans through the mists of time  How much of all this Mr Masters presents with adequate poetic magic no critic can define as yet We his neighbors and contemporaries find most of us the very essence of it in Spoon River which will surely tell something of the tale of our tribe to those who come after us W e find something of its atmosphere also its light and shade and space in the longer monologues of the later books though here the theme is more consciously and as a rule less creatively presented But in all one is carried along by a wave of power the cumulative effect like a geometrical progression seems out of proportion to the separate steps that make it This is the reader s tribute no doubt to the poet s rich and generous personality that of a deeply informed man of the modern world something between Chaucer and Rabelais but burning darkly in his heart a little secret candle to some mediaeval saint  One can not leave Mr Masters without protesting against the new edition of Spoon River now unfortunately the only one on sale The so called illustrations by Oliver Herford are pitiful beyond words So embellished the book looks like the typical ornamental volume on Reuben s parlor table   Frost and Masters  To return to our parallel it is important that two rich districts of this country each an individual and powerful personality are finding modern interpreters Who will speak as well for the South and for the Far West between sea  and mountains H M A DECORATIVE COLORIST Men Women and Ghosts by Amy Lowell Macmillan Co  In his book the dramatic monologues in the section called The Overgrown Pasture are perhaps the most keenly alive of the stories in various forms which compose it Their free verse presentation of the harsh Yankee dialect and of the hard stript Yankee character is poetry as crabbed as a barbed wire fence but it attains at times a certain tragic dignity by expressing with fit harshness the psychology of lonely New England rural women hurt to the point of madness or violence by solitude silence lack of sympathy and love It is a generation gone to seed which she gives us here an overgrown pasture which the hardy souls have deserted and in which only ghosts thwarted and wistful of life remain  The rest of the book might be called Decorations for it is essentially a series or rather several series of decorative paintings As becomes an artist in that kind Miss Lowell has a really vital sense of color and she keeps her planes intact and holds her vivid tones to the key and the pattern The only trouble is she is tempted to become too much involved with her decorative scheme Her form whether it be rhythm royal or polyphonic prose is in danger   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  of becoming too formal holding not only the characters of the story but the poet herself in too tight a mesh In the Figurines in Old Saxe this may be sufficient for her purpose a close eighteenth century mesh with gesticuated lovers moving back and forth to a delicately shadowed fate Yet that purpose is not quite enough to give a living soul to the work of her hand In Pickthorn Manor and The Cremona  Violin one can scarcely observe the clever psychology analyzing women s involuntary infidelities because of a certain over neatness in the design and it is a great relief when the heroine of Patterns cuts the mesh with the sword of tragedy and lifts the poem to a higher plane with her poignant cry What are patterns for Patterns is indeed not only the most effective of the Figurines in decorative quality but the most human and convincing as well And one cannot leave this group without a word of praise for the old Venice atmosphere like tarnished gold in The City of Falling Leaves  Similarly the War Pictures such pieces in polyphonic prose as Bombardment and Lead Soldiers are too consciously designed one cannot forget the pattern and it has not enough spontaneity and violence for the subject It is only when the pattern exactly fits the theme that we get such an admirable dramatic suite as Malmaison if one may borrow a musical term for this kind of choric movement or such an adorable grotesque as Red Slippers These are both in polyphonic prose a pattern which hardly lacks intricacy but which in these cases does not obtrude itself   A Decorative Colorisi  The book ends with a group of grotesques a mood in which Miss Lowell delights as deeply as any Chinese woodcarver They range from the delicate attitudinizing of The Dinner party to the fiercely jerky gesticulation of the Stravinsky imitations The art in these is very deliberate no doubt but that is the way with the grotesque always a deliberate mocking exaggeration  It is a relief to find a poet who is always an artist Miss  Lowell may have too much art at times but that is much  rarer than too little H M  CELTIC SONGS  Singing Fires of Erin by Eleanor Rogers Cox John Lane Co Songs of the Fields by Francis Ledwidge Duffield amp Co  Into a mold of conventional verse Miss Cox has turned moments from ancient stories of Ireland Her lines are trimmed with a sprinkling of Celtic images and a handful of immortal names Deirdre Aengus Cuchulain Emer and others But the statement that Miss Cox follows in the footsteps of Yeats is misleading Distinctly she bears no relation to him not even the doubtful one of imitator  Francis Ledwidge on the other hand in Songs of the Fields is truer to his heritage of Irish poetry A sense of beautiful language and a deep sense of fields and woods and waters meet in his poems Lord Dunsany who introduces him explains that he found him where he has long looked for a poet among the Irish peasants The only pity is that   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Mr Ledwidge has not looked much for himself there but instead has too often sought expression in borrowed language Especially his poems of Irish heroes draw from the magic of Yeats Yet in a sense to justify them they have beauty of their own too  The gray sea fogs above them are unfurled At evening when the sea walks with the moon And later in the same poem The Death of Laeg Sleep lays his heavy thumbs upon my eyes Shuts out all sounds and shakes me at the wrists For the rest this poet who for a living was in turn farm laborer miner and scavenger on the roads seems to have been seduced by the bright idiom of Keats and of the Elizabethans perhaps Though he wears this garment of another day with a poet s instinct it cannot help giving too much of his verse that unessential air of costumed quaintness Possibly he himself would find it hard to say just why he has used words and phrases like tis neath thwart dost nought the while I thought to  Mr Ledwidge is now lance corporal in an Irish regiment of the Mediterranean force in the face of which fact criticism seems cold One hopes however for other poems from him more native more intrinsic in character that the inherent music of his verse may gain edge and savor Already verses here and there make a sudden image the way these lines do from A Twilight in March  A gipsy lit a fire and made a sound Of moving tins and from an oblong moon The river seemed to gush across the ground    Celtic Songs  And then three syllables of melody Dropped from a blackbird s flute and died apart Sometimes his words have the amber quality of honey and with all their indirectness seem to distil almost as in a Greek idyl the sweetness of the earth  And I will meet her on the hills of South And I will lead her to a northern water My wild one the sweet beautiful uncouth The eldest maiden of the Winter s daughter  And now and then one comes on lines with no lack of directness like these from two different poems  The brown Nude beauty of the autumn sweetly bent Over the woods across the little town  Where I shall rest when my last song is over The air is smelling like a feast of wine  Dorothy Dudley  OUR CONTEMPORARIES  SIR ORACLE  Mr William Stanley Braithwaite has delivered once more his annual pronunciamento in the Boston Transcript We note with due humility his statement that the influence of POETRY has waned  If POETRY S influence has waned we may still rejoice that it seems to retain full power over Mr Braithwaite himself for in his list of the year s poems of distinction he mentions sixty five from POETRY against thirty five from Others and thirty three from the Century the two maga   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  zines next in favor also a POETRY poem Night for Adventures by Victor Starbuck is one of the four spread out for special honor on the valuable Transcript page  Moreover this is the first time the Boston dictator in these annual reviews has even mentioned POETRY or its influence We should be duly grateful that he has finally discovered us though alas with polite deprecation as the organ of Ezra Pound s radicalism and with the long delayed admission not yet intended as a compliment that the point of departure from conservatism he should have included his own conservatism may be dated from the establishment of POETRY A MAGAZINE OF VERSE  Mr Braithwaite s tardy and reluctant recognition of our influence is perfectly comprehensible POETRY has from the first taken exception to his autocratic tone and criticized his somewhat provincial opinions Opinions are always individual of course but when they are solemnly enunciated with the aid of lists starred and unstarred for greater or less distinction in a newspaper of long established literary reputation like the Transcript they assume an authority quite out of proportion to their value and therefore demand scrutiny  Last year Mr Braithwaite was almost a convert to rad  icalism This year his mind is at sea wondering whether  it should venture further out into the unknown but on the  whole steering shorewards reverting to type He decides  that although the influence of the innovators has been felt  so that strength independence and more daring execution  have resulted from contact with the new forces yet now   Sir Oracle  with the elimination of a great deal that sounded false and which was very much in evidence a year ago American poetry looks good to progress with fewer distractions Et cetera in a valiant effort to face gracefully in both directions  A mind so unsure of its ground necessarily moves freakishly Thus we remain untroubled by Mr Braithwaite s libellous assertion that Mr Sandburg a much heralded POETRY production was a failure or by his inference of failure in the case of Ezra Pound from the statement that the collected poems of Pound have so little interested the American public that they find it difficult to discover an American publisher and the magazine Others largely supported by his disciples has ceased publication  Mr Sandburg who by the way was the Lord s production not POETRY S Mr Sandburg stimulated by heavy sales and by the good opinion of critics like Francis Hackett Louis Untermeyer George Sterling Floyd Dell and many others of quality can easily get along without Mr Braithwaite s As for Mr Pound we doubt if he is seeking to discover an American publisher or if immediate public response is the ultimate criterion of a poet s fame But both these gentlemen are muscular intellectually as well as physically and abundantly able to take care of themselves The thrust at Others is less valiant No one can fail to regret the cessation of that brave little magazine which was founded without a cent of capital and carried on for twelve or more experimental and adventurous months through the devotion and personal sacrifice of its editor It may be a surprise to both editor and contributors to learn that they are disciples   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  of Ezra Pound though no doubt many of them are his admirers  In conclusion we may be permitted to inquire why Mr Braithwaite is reprinting in his forthcoming anthology of the year s magazine verse eight poems copyrighted by this magazine without so much as asking permission of its editor or in at least one case of the poet H M  THE SEVEN ARTS  The Seven Arts is the ambitious title of the new magazine published in New York of which James Oppenheim is the editor Waldo Frank the associate editor with an advisory board including Kahlil Gibran Louis Untermeyer Van Wyck Brooks Robert Frost Edna Kenton David Mannes and Robert Edmund Jones The ideal magazine is perhaps only another Utopian dream but none of the many now before us does just what The Seven Arts proposes to do to furnish a vehicle of expression for the artist in any or all of the seven arts and particularly for that portion of his work which is done through a joyous necessity of the artist himself This is a fine project We will not say that it deserves to succeed for desert is based not upon propaganda but upon accomplishment and nothing is so barren as a slogan unfulfilled But we shall watch the outcome with anxiety and hope  At first sight one fears that there may be more breadth than depth to the magazine that the ground to be covered may preclude the possibility of printing contributions of any   The Seven Arts  length This would be a pity as the fragmentariness of many of our periodicals makes one s mind feel like a scrap bag full of diverse remnants of information with hardly so much unity as a patch work quilt This is but a fear however  The outstanding contribution to the first number is perhaps Romain Rolland s America and The Arts although I confess that Allen Upward s fable The Saints of San Atoll gives me most pleasure The Frenchman s message seems to me very largely rhetoric I don t know what M Rolland means when he says that we are free of traditions that we are by this very lack of tradition isolated from the vast load of thought of sentiment of secular obsession under which the old world groans If it is possible as he says that the intellectual fixed ideas the dogmas of politics and art that grip Europe are unknown to us is it not possible that we have our own fixed ideas our own dogmas and obsessions And are we not just discovering that we may not go forward unhampered to our future while Europe sacrifices hers to quarrels and rancors and ambitions that should be dead that our freedom depends upon Europe s and Europe s upon ours  And I wish the editors of The Seven Arts would explain what they mean when they say that we have no traditions We have living traditions summed up in certain representative Americans statesmen or artists We have many traditions in the air so to speak waiting for artists to synthesize them The artist creates a school of style he does not necessarily follow one To say that we have no traditions is to say that we have had no artists no writers   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  no poets no statesmen It is perhaps due to the very nature of our democracy that our genius has been so largely individual and initiative Our writers have not run in schools it may be but to say that we have no traditions is to deny all that makes the American spirit which is certainly distinct enough to have a name and to be traditional It is to deny Lincoln Lee Washington Jefferson Hawthorne Poe Whitman and many others it is to deny ourselves the air we breathe and the ground we walk on  Do not copy foreign models says M Rolland an injunction also repeated recently by Theodore Roosevelt who is suddenly alive to the need of nationalism in art as well as in politics although in his Sorbonne lectures on good citizenship six or seven years ago he made no mention of the artist s share in statehood It is surprising how much the discussion of respective cultures incident upon the war has done to awaken interest in the arts and artists though not enough to form any national commissions or create any endowment funds or take the tariff off books  Be careless of form too says M Rolland but is not mastery of form the road to freedom and what form of art is foreign once it is assimilated The surest road to art is through an international understanding of art Of course  M Rolland means that we should not slavishly copy foreign models but we should not so use any model Particularly we should not wait as I pointed out several years ago to copy our own models after they have been assimilated by France or England or Germany and so returned to us Indeed what we chiefly need I think is to recognize our   The Seven Arts  own individuality our own traditions Perhaps we do not lack the tradition so much as the power of recognition No one yet I believe has pointed out a certain kinship between Hawthorne s realism and that of the Russian novelists who are now so much admired And Hawthorne flourished in the despised Victorian era A C H  THE NEW DIAL  We hope that The Dial under its new management may prove not only a journal of opinion but a pathfinder It is the function of an organ of criticism to create opinion as well as to record it to project itself into the future as well as to explore the past If it does not do this it is of no more value than a card index useful enough in its way but not very stimulating The trouble with The Dial under the old management was that it seemed to live too much in the past It was authoritative on established subjects the only good poet was a dead one We are very sure that this will not be the editorial conception of the new Dial  W e hope that in the heat of controversy we may not have seemed to belittle the achievement of the founder of The Dial the late Francis Fisher Browne who for many years devoted his fine abilities to the promotion of the higher culture in America If we have criticized the paper s attitude it was The Dial which commenced the quarrel We herewith bury the hatchet and extend our hearty good wishes to the present publisher Mr
