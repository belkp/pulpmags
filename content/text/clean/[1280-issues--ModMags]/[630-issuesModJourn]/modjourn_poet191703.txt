along  And my steps would make the time And the stanzas be my rest  What can I say with the words of my lips Oh let me speak from my toes tips Of my treasure and zest  Dancing I can tell every sweet Slow and soft soft and fleet Dancing I can tell every ill All my inmost wish fulfil All my sorrowing I can heal   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Oh to reveal With the bending of my head With the curving of my hand What no poem has ever said What no words could understand Things for a book too sad too gay The verses of my feet would say Telling sorrow telling delight Into the very marrow of men s sight  UNDER TH E TREE  I have found a seat At the foot of a tree All complete Made for me Smelling sweet With the needles of pine I sit very fine In the hollow here Of my root woven chair  TH E DANCER  Why are you gay little tree That you dance on the hillside Holding out your delicate skirt   The Dancer  Holding out your delicate fingers Tilting your little head when the wind comes blowing  Softly Suddenly You will shake your twinkling locks You will leap and skip little tree Tree on the hillside Lightly And twirl yourself away  TO A VINE THE WORKMEN CUT DOWN  How will your greenness stay Now your roots are cut away The little tendrils that climbed so high The little green leaves still fluttering in the sun Will shrivel and wither to dust when your sap is dry Your pleasant days are done  Oh you turned these bricks into a happy place Dancing and growing Dancing and throwing The dancing grace Of your shadows over the wall When the winds made your little leaves stir When your shade was full of the call And nesting of birds you were happy hearing the whir Of their wings   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Oh wings and summer days Will miss you and men whose treeless ways You gladdened in the dusty town I wish that we could keep your pleasant sheen I wish you need not fade and be cut down But buildings are more worth than vines you know Old vine Forgive this wasting of your precious green Forgive us that we had to let you go  ARCHES  Under the high arching bridge The shadow arch Bends itself Curved Down into the water And lies in the water As motionless As the arch above it is motionless Masonry of the dusk  CONTINUANCE  What will you find In the depths of the wind What does it hold Fold on fold on flowing fold Clasp it and your fingers press   Continuance  Only a soft emptiness Only air is in your hand Yet this nothing may command The purposes of men and seas Ordering them with a mighty ease With that same that ancient power That was born in time s first hour In the beginning of change and days But never its strength delays Or grows old or will weary or rest Nor the years diminish its wild invisible zest  SKY HUMOR  How many and many Since the world began Have sung of your beauty Moon Since the world began And now tonight We call you ours Saying that your beauty belongs to us Dreaming that only ourselves Have known your mystery  Sometimes Under the hiding of the clouds Do you smile And laugh to yourself   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  At these people of the earth And their imaginings  Oh but do not laugh at us unkindly Moon Remember how little time we live And you live so long  TH E LETTER  The words were beautiful Before I had read them  I laid my fingers along the edges Over the fold your hands had folded I laid my face to the face of my letter  Softly came down and closed in about me A solitude A separate world In which was no sound or motion or being Only the whispering of the paper Stirring to life in my brain  All day I carried it Against me Like a bird Against my heart where my life is Like a secret waiting in my heart Singing   Kin  KIN  Do you also know it Did you catch the beam Have you felt the fire Has your day the dream Did you drink as I did Was it long ago Does your memory of it Burn and glow Do you wait its coming Wish it back again Have you known the rapture Known the pain  HEY NONINO  I will put on my gay dress My corals and locket On my hair a blue ribbon And my softest shoes I will go and dance Where the mirror will show me I will go and dance And turn myself and courtesy Oh the mirror will be glad And courtesy way way down   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Spreading out my dress To watch how it looks Spreading out my gay dress over the floor  MEN FOLKS  When I look at men sometimes I can hardly tell how it is But when I see them Walking about Doing things Talking and planning So busy so serious Only children could be Only children So serious  A feeling comes over me as if I were God And looked forth from a great distance On all the humanness of the earth Compassionately  Helen Hoyt   COUNTRY RHYMES  OLD YOUTH  There s nothing very beautiful and nothing very gay About the rush of faces in the town by day But a light tan cow in a pale green mead That is very beautiful beautiful indeed And the soft March wind and the low March mist Are better than kisses in the dark street kissed The fragrance of the forest when it wakes at dawn The fragrance of a trim green village lawn The hearing of the murmur of the rain at play These things are beautiful beautiful as day And I shan t stand waiting for love or scorn When the feast is laid for a day new born Oh better let the little things I loved when little  Return when the heart finds the great things brittle And better is a temple made of bark and thong Than a tall stone temple that may stand too long  THE DOOR  Love is a proud and gentle thing a better thing to own Than all of the wide impossible stars over the heavens blown And the little gifts her hand gives are careless given or taken   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  And though the whole great world break the heart of her  is not shaken Love is a viol in the wind a viol never stilled And mine of all is the surest that ever God has willed I shall speak to her though she goes before me into the grave And though I drown in the sea herself shall come upon a  wave And the things that love gives after shall be as they were before For life is only a small house and love is an open door  THE TREE TOAD  A tiny bell the tree toad has I wonder if he knows The charm it is to hear him Ringing as he goes  He can t have gone the journeys He tells me to go on Here in the darkness Of the cool cropped lawn  He cannot know the thrill Of the soft spring wind Or the wonder when you walk What will come behind   The Tree Toad  He hasn t seen the places I d break my heart to win Nor heard the city calling When the cold comes in  He sings away contented And doesn t leave his tree But he sets my blood a going Where his song will never be  THE HORNS OF PEACE  No man s life is open as the houses Blindly he will build houses of a dream Where many maids are running clad in leather blouses Running with white legs into a stream  Blow blow the horns clearer in the morning Never let the world hear though the music wake Leaves on the ash tree and rose set thorning Let speech be over and no woman bake  The ash limbs are burdenless the rose stands idle A tremble with the horns blowing far and sweet And even an old man will dream of a bridal Seeing what he was when love was in his feet   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Blow blow the horns farther growing clearer I have seen my life and love as a cloud A star will thrust a face through coming nearer Never let the world hear a glad song aloud  DILEMMA  What though the moon should come With a blinding glow And the stars have a game On the wood s edge A man would have to still Cut and weed and sow And lay a white line When he plants a hedge  What though God With a great sound of rain Came to talk of violets And things people do I would have to labor And dig with my brain Still to get a truth Out of all words new  Orrick Johns   A BLUE VALENTINE  For Aline  Monsignore Right Reverend Bishop Valentinus Sometime of Interamna which is called Ferni Now of the delightful Court of Heaven I respectfully salute you I genuflect And I kiss your episcopal ring  It is not Monsignore The fragrant memory of your holy life Nor that of your shining and joyous martyrdom Which causes me now to address you But since this is your august festival Monsignore It seems appropriate to me to state According to a venerable and agreeable custom That I love a beautiful lady Her eyes Monsignore  Are so blue that they put lovely little blue reflections On everything that she looks at Such as a wall Or the moon Or my heart It is like the light coming through blue stained glass Yet not quite like it For the blueness is not transparent Only translucent   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Her soul s light shines through But her soul cannot be seen It is something elusive whimsical tender wanton infantile  wise And noble She wears Monsignore a blue garment Made in the manner of the Japanese It is very blue I think that her eyes have made it more blue Sweetly staining it As the pressure of her body has graciously given it form Loving her Monsignore I love all her attributes But I believe That even if I did not love her I should love the blueness of her eyes And her blue garment made in the manner of the Japanese  Monsignore I have never before troubled you with a request The saints whose ears I chiefly worry with my pleas are the  most exquisite and maternal Brigid Gallant Saint Stephen who puts fire in my blood And your brother bishop my patron The generous and jovial Saint Nicholas of Bari But of your courtesy Monsignore Do me this favor When you this morning make your way   A Blue Valentine  To the Ivory Throne that bursts into bloom with roses be  cause of her who sits upon it When you come to pay your devoir to Our Lady I beg you say to her Madame a poor poet one of your singing servants yet on  earth Has asked me to say that at this moment he is especially grateful to you For wearing a blue gown  THE THORN  The garden of God is a radiant place And every flower has a holy face Our Lady like a lily bends above the cloudy sod But Saint Michael is the thorn on the rose bush of God  David is the song upon God s lips And Our Lady is the goblet that He sips And Gabriel s the breath of His command But Saint Michael is the sword in God s right hand  The Ivory Tower is fair to see And may her walls encompass me But when the Devil comes with the thunder of his might Saint Michael show me how to fight  Joyce Kilmer   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  A NUN  One glance and I had lost her in the riot Of tangled cries She trod the clamor with a cloistral quiet Deep in her eyes As though she heard the muted music only That silence makes Among dim mountain summits and on lonely Deserted lakes  There is some broken song her heart remembers From long ago Some love lies buried deep some passion s embers Smothered in snow Far voices of a joy that sought and missed her Fail now and cease And this has given the deep eyes of God s sister Their dreadful peace  Odell Shepard WHAT THE ORDERLY DOG SAW  A Winter Landscape To Mrs Percy Jackson  The seven white peacocks against the castle wall In the high trees and the dusk are like tapestry The sky being orange the high wall a purple barrier The canal dead silver in the dusk  And you are far away  Yet I see infinite miles of mountains Little lights shining in rows in the dark of them Infinite miles of marshes Thin wisps of mist shimmering like blue webs Over the dusk of them  Great curves and horns of sea And dusk and dusk and the little village And you sitting in the firelight  II  Around me are the two hundred and forty men of B Com  pany Mud colored Going about their avocations Resting between their practice of the art Of killing men As I too rest between my practice Of the art of killing men   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Their pipes glow over the mud and their mud color moving  like fireflies beneath the trees I too being mud colored Beneath the trees and the peacocks When they come up to me in the dusk They start stiffen and salute almost invisibly And the forty two prisoners from the battalion guard room Crouch over the tea cans in the shadow of the wall And the bread hunks glimmer beneath the peacocks  And you are far away  III  Presently I shall go in I shall write down the names of the forty two Prisoners in the battalion guard room On fair white foolscap Their names rank and regimental numbers Corps Companies Punishments and Offences Remarks and By whom confined Yet in spite of all I shall see only The infinite miles of dark mountain The infinite miles of dark marshland Great curves and horns of sea The little village And you Sitting in the firelight  Ford Madox Hueffer    WHAT THE CIVILIAN SAW  Kensington High Street  It is all shiny and black like bombazine or taffeta Or the satin of my grandmother s gown that stood alone It was so thick A screen between us and knowledge That sometimes when we are very good gets on to the  placards  Past the screen of the dark the rain glissades Flowing down the straight damp palisades of the dark  Faces against the screen Lamps of living flesh hung out in the storm That has draped the world in black Here by the station an iridescent sheen Dazzling not gay And news Special oh Special What have they let through to us from over there For once  Faces news on the screen And the hungry crowds weltering in the dark Here is the English translation Of what goes on over there There where hangings are not black but red And the king of England is lying on the ground  Violet Hunt Hueffer   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  WINDS OF MARCH  The bare boughs are alive within And the young buds are trembling and curious  NEWLY SEEDED  It s for you little bird of course This sign is meant For you burrowing with your beak And shaking up sprays of dust  Do you not know How the earth held each yellow shining speck Close to itself feeding it breathing on it And from each rain drop Picked out the winy pearl For it to drink  Hop away little one go find you a worm Which with its sleek body alive has rubbed Against wet earth Has tasted the sunlight and the warmth Or some buzzing one with wings Drunk with the sun whose breath Blows it up today And will blow it out tomorrow   Night Moods  NIGHT MOODS  I am in your thin dark waters night They reach up I splash and flounder I drown  The waves separate make way They touch playfully my shoulders They whisper gently  II The earth is melted I am vapor A wave of the waves I will rise with the wind  The hunger of my heart Is now a dusky hillock of vapor Night has blown Her breath  ON A WINDY AFTERNOON  Yesterday afternoon on a short cropped lawn I saw the feet of the wind which I have read of in books And it was like the glimpse of a woman s bare feet Hidden quickly   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  OFF  God Over our ugly buildings Why did you bend out Your beautiful ravishing sky Take it off Let them jag The emptiness  FIRE  You contain more Than the red and the purple and the orange Which I see If I dared to tear you to shreds with my hands I would find that you contain also water And ice and even blackish brown earth To make beautiful things with  KNOWLEDGE  The craving of my body has been conquered It no longer deceives my thoughts Or colors them Knowledge purer than flame Is in me consuming me   The Adversary  THE ADVERSARY  Coiled around you is he A little blacker than a shadow  Before my lips reach yours I have to push him from them That s why my kisses Are so gentle  He is also coiled around me Do you feel his scales as I Perhaps that s why we kiss at all I know so little  A POLISH GIRL  You carry the dishes in your hands But your thoughts are elsewhere  As if you inwardly knew That in your kisses is the glow Of Sobietsky and the heroes  That your body has the pungent taste Which the willow tree and the rose Perhaps feel in the soil  And that your hair carries the fragrance Of the willow and the rose itself   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  PORTRAIT  To H M  A small tree Always surrounded by mist More often dark but sometimes light Very light almost made of light Yet even then between the branches There is shadow a wavering gloom  GONE  It was as though sunshine Had been thickened To a human form  You have left traces Of rose and orange On the afternoon  PLAYING HORSE  Mount little one  The horse trots back and forth  Time is harder than water  Nights days hours Shine   Playing Horse  Like pools of light Where were you child  The horse stumbles Little one  TRAVELER  Miles and miles you traveled  A wise brown bear Rode you on his back Then a bird hopped along Or flew in front and explained And a stone sent a bearded one With a book  In your small warm nest you heard Bells rung delicately and strange calls  We built you a little house We hung up a sun and a moon And stars like apples The walls we painted red and blue We spread out carpets of Bagdad And three glasses with sweet wine We stood in a corner  Max Michelson   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  LACQUER PRINTS  STREETS  Adapted from the poet Yakura Sanjin 1769  As I wandered through the eight hundred and eight streets  of the city I saw nothing so beautiful As the Women of the Green Houses With their girdles of spun gold And their long sleeved dresses Colored like the graining of wood As they walk  The hems of their outer garments flutter open And the blood red linings glow like sharp toothed maple leaves In autumn  DESOLATION  Under the plum blossoms are nightingales But the sea is hidden in an egg white mist And they are silent  SUNSHINE  The pool is edged with the blade like leaves of irises If I throw a stone into the placid water It suddenly stiffens   Sunshine  Into rings and rings Of sharp gold wire  ILLUSION  Walking beside the tree peonies I saw a beetle Whose wings were of black lacquer spotted with milk I would have caught it But it ran from me swiftly And hid under the stone lotus Which supports the Statue of Buddha  A YEAR PASSES  Beyond the porcelain fence of the pleasure garden I hear the frogs in the blue green rice fields But the sword shaped moon Has cut my heart in two  A LOVER  If I could catch the green lantern of the firefly I could see to write you a letter  TO A HUSBAND  Brighter than fireflies upon the Uji River Are your words in the dark Beloved   L  POETRY A Magazine of Verse  FROM CHINA  I thought The moon Shining upon the many steps of the palace before me Shines also upon the chequered rice fields Of my native land And my tears fell Like white rice grains At my feet  AUTUMN  All day long I have watched the purple vine leaves Fall into the water And now in the moonlight they still fall But each leaf is fringed with silver  EPHEMERA  Silver green lanterns tossing among windy branches So an old man thinks Of the loves of his youth  DOCUMENT  The great painter Hokusai In his old age Wrote these words   Document  Profiting by a beautiful spring day In this year of tranquillity To warm myself in the sun I received a visit from my publisher Who asked me to do something for him Then I reflected that one should not forget the glory of  arms Above all when one was living in peace And in spite of my age Which is more than seventy years I have found courage to draw those ancient heroes Who have been the models of glory  THE EMPEROR S GARDEN  Once in the sultry heats of midsummer An emperor caused the miniature mountains in his garden To be covered with white silk That so crowned They might cool his eyes With the sparkle of snow  ONE OF THE HUNDRED VIEWS OF FUJI BY HOKUSAI  Being thirsty I filled a cup with water And behold Fuji yarha lay upon the water Like a dropped leaf   POETRY A Magazine of Verse DISILLUSION A scholar  Weary of erecting the fragile towers of words Went on a pilgrimage to Asama Yama And seeing the force of the fire Spouting from this mighty mountain Hurled himself into its crater And perished  PAPER FISHES  The paper carp At the end of its long bamboo pole Takes the wind into its mouth And emits it at its tail So is man Forever swallowing the wind  MEDITATION  A wise man Watching the stars pass across the sky Remarked In the upper air the fireflies move more slowly  THE CAMELLIA TREE OF MATSUE  At Matsue There was a Camellia Tree of great beauty   The Camellia Tree of Matsue  Whose blossoms were white as honey wax Splashed and streaked with the pink of fair coral At night When the moon rose in the sky The Camellia Tree would leave its place By the gateway And wander up and down the garden Trailing its roots behind it Like a train of rustling silk The people in the house Hearing the scrape of them upon the gravel Looked out into the garden And saw the tree With its flowers erect and peering Pressed against the shojii Many nights the tree walked about the garden Until the women and children Became frightened And the Master of the house Ordered that the tree be cut down But when the gardener brought his axe And struck at the trunk of the tree There spouted forth a stream of dark blood And when the stump was torn up The hole quivered like an open wound  Amy Lowell   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  EDITORIAL COMMENT  HARD TIMES INDEED  N THE Contributors Club of a recent Atlan  tic are some anonymous reflections upon Poets  Hard Times reflections which sum up a fam  iliar point of view about poets and poetry with  convenient compactness A few excerpts will present the gist of the argument  These are hard times for the honest minor poet not because as Mr George Moore adventurously asserts art is dead under the curse of universal locomotion nor because the singer is denied a just hearing by the public   The honest minor poet wakes up in these days to find himself a child in a world of energetic serious maturity Even the daily headlines bring home to him that no one needs his songs of hills and leaves and clouds of elfin things and gypsy feet even of love and death touched as they are in his music with the kind deceiving shimmer of dreams   With the nations reeling like drunken regiments it is no wonder that the little singer finds himself beaten into humble silence If he is honest he knows that the world needs the burning insight and power of a prophet or the simplicity of eternal childlike Truth If he is not great enough in complexity to attain the one nor great enough in simplicity for the other he has nothing to say His stars and brooks will stand the test only if somehow he can weave them into the vast troubled web of human experience Pale pools white birds green fishes blue gardens are truly the playthings of an artistic moment and all the little emptiness of  love is like a rose blown down the wind unless he can give it the substance of life more mightily than any sweet chiming words alone can do Poetry cannot dabble in strange forms nor try to spice itself to vitality with new labels for old devices Now more than ever poetry must speak for itself  It is because of this high necessity that the singer is cast back into silence He is like a young person in a house of tumult and sorrow He yearns to help but he is dumb before the terrible or noble facts about him If he utters himself he is aware of in  Hard Times Indeed  adequacy and expects to be brushed aside Even if sometimes he feels sure that his dream knowledge sees deeper than the darkened eyes of his friends he dares not insist till Time has given him the right to be heard He must grow up before he can speak Or to put it more plainly he must be great to be worth hearing When he can never be great nothing is left for him but silence and wonder He may always keep the wonder   His courageous silence will leave more sky room for the great songs sure to come His wonder will open to him some private port of Paradise gleaming with the proud light of Truth  This kind of talk is still heard in more or less authoritative places although like the phrase minor poet it is somewhat out of fashion I am not convinced of the heroism of that self abnegating might be bard who is cast back into silence by high necessity struck dumb before the terrible and noble facts about him Were Coleridge Keats Shelley many others struck dumb by the terrible and noble facts of the Napoleonic wars yet these singers of clouds and leaves and elfin things were minor poets to their contemporaries Did any one of them hush his sweet chiming words to leave more room for the great songs sure to come No for he knew that the great song the great work of art is merely the highest tree of a forest rarely an isolated miracle  Let us get down to brass tacks This being a strenuous age of universal locomotion war and other bedevilments the world has no use we are told for the poet unless he is an Isaiah or a Hans Christian Anderson One might as well say the world has no use for gardens or dwellings or symphonies for sculptured friezes and monuments for portraits and landscapes for Venetian glass or Chinese rugs for jewels   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  and laces for club houses and art museums Because my favorite painter is not moved to depict cosmic horrors like Verestchagin shall I bid him burn his brushes and take to brooding in a corner Because the mad world is at war shall no one play the piano or plan a fair house or dream by a sculptured fountain under the tree Or Mr Essayist because thou art virtuous shall there be no more cakes and ale  The poet in any primitive society or any well organized civilization should be as much a matter of course as the carpenter No tribe no city is complete without one and the better he is the more effectually does he complete it But for any community to demand the ultimate perfection of its poet to expect him to be silent unless he can speak like Moses from Mount Sinai is as absurd as it would be to forbid to a carpenter his tools unless he can at once though unpracticed and unappreciated turn out Chippendale chairs  Some reader may retort with another familiar sentiment the true poet can t be silenced But the trouble is he can be silenced by starvation of body or soul song deafness of his generation or other obstructions and there is nothing more dangerous more bitter and perverted perhaps than a silenced poet If no one needs his songs his wonder far from leading him to some private port of Paradise usually ends in toxic decay or some violent explosion like other suppressed forces  But in a more profound sense the essayist s point of view is piteously wrong headed and piteously typical of much   Hard Times Indeed  wrong headedness at the present hour In such platitudes indeed such tawdry thinking lies the cause of this cosmic tragedy of nations and every poet who sings of brooks and clouds of elfin beauty of love and death thereby utters his heroic protest helps to remind us of eternal truth Are we to believe forsooth that this is a world of energetic serious maturity because men are riding in steamers and motor cars and building sky scrapers and killing each other by millions at the call of rotten dynasties and ideas Forever and forever no It is a world of overgrown children playing with expensive and explosive toys of children who make friends across the world and then madly mow each other down in a quarrel not their own which would make any wise man laugh but for his bitter tears of pity So hot with youth is the world that its soul the common feeling of the crowd is drawing our own reluctant nation into this furious game with a force that even the most illumined leader though mature far beyond the people would be unable to resist even as the illumined Lincoln was compelled in his day to respond to the immediate call and drive the dogs of war  If the world ever grows up into energetic serious maturity it will be because the common feeling of the crowd arrives at wisdom And wisdom is now as it ever has been insight into the eternal verities of truth and beauty Every artist who helps the world to see truth and beauty be it merely by a pastel landscape or a carved kitten or a song to a butterfly s wing does his bit toward reminding us of eternal verities and thereby bringing the world nearer to   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  serious maturity He is an advance agent of cilivization that higher civilization which means wisdom forbearance humor joy in life and magnanimity in death H M  THINGS TO BE DONE  Transportation is civilization Rudyard Kipling First we should get the tariff off books The work of the American Free Trade League may be purely economic and political it is outside the scope of our activities But a protective tariff on books is an obstacle to the free circulation of thought and must be done away with Transportation is civilization that phrase is the most profound that Mr Kipling has ever written But the free circulation of thought is the very core and pulse of the matter The United States has a new law which permits and even fosters the importation of contemporary painting and sculpture Is it anything but sloth and ignorance that leaves literature in worse condition than these other arts Second we should get a good copyright law The present law framed in the interest of a few local mechanics is also an obstacle to the free circulation of thought Is there any reason why the United States should lag behind other countries in a matter of this sort Third let us learn more languages let more people learn more languages The man who reads only one language is intellectually only half a man in comparison with the man of equal mental energy who can read two with comfort All things are not written in one tongue   Things to Be Done  Fourth we should multiply translations It is not everyone who has time to learn ten languages or even two Competition is of value even in matters of art and intelligence The better the stock in the store the more chance of finding what you need We need more translations of French authors not only contemporary but eighteenth century authors We need translations of German and Russian authors many more than we get  We need standards of comparison All excellence has not risen out of one ant hill America is full of provincial people who do not know that they are provincial who are insulted if one calls them provincial even though they have never stopped to inquire whether there are peculiar functions appertaining to provincials and particular opportunities afforded by the very fact of provincialism or whether it is a flaw to be perhaps in part overcome  Fifth we must try to think at least a little about civilization centralization and its possible functions the differentiation of individuals and the function advantage or disadvantage of such differentiation  We should read De Gourmont De Goncourt We should not assume that Christ knew more than Confucius until we have read Confucius We should mistrust the local parson and the local professor remembering that lots of people not so long ago were brought up to believe in Carlyle and Macaulay Nor should we assume that Darwin said the last word or that Christianity is the religion of all the world or that what we call Christianity would   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  have been recognized as such by most of our ancestors Codes etiquettes and moralities have wavered and varied Irony is still set down as a sin in manuals of devotion The last heretic was burnt at the stake in 1758 We are not yet out of the forest  It is necessary that the art of poetry should retain all its liberties The poet must be free to recognize the existence of ideas whatever they are and wherever he finds them  Questions for Meditation  Is America still a colony intellectually in all ways save  in her political organization Is she self sufficient What is the value of a metropolis of several Is America importing art and exporting artists Does she export artists or merely promising embryos  which hatch into artists elsewhere Does America want foreign books Does she originate or does she merely multiply and  dilute Is she bigoted Is her bigotry a danger to the arts To what extent does she fear discovery and discoveries Is she mistrustful of invention simply because she has  no critical sense no standards whereby to measure achievement Is this the reason for booms and for so many people of promise petering out  How many of her authors consider quantity preferable to intensity E P   REVIEWS  YALE DISCOVERS BLAKE  Selections from the Symbolical Poems of William Blake  edited with an Introduction by Fred E Pierce Ph D  Yale Univ Press  It is interesting to note that professors pedants and other critical persons are discovering that Blake was after all not so mad as his contemporaries thought and that they have even taken to patronizing him in consequence The moral is that if a man of genius only waits long enough he will be sure of some recognition  Blake s recognition as a poet has been slow in arriving because he is too much of the spiritual aristocrat for America and too much of the imaginative man for England In England there are still persons who think Blake mad such as Mr Comyns Carr and Mr G K Chesterton Mr Chesterton s small book on the subject may be disregarded He considers Blake mad for the simple reason that he did not hold the same opinions as his own In fact Mr Chesterton declares that Blake was mad because he was logical whereas Chesterton is not Everyone in England is mad according to Mr Chesterton except Mr Shaw and himself and Mr Shaw is mad because he is totally illogical whereas Mr Chesterton is logical or not just as it suits him to be  This however is a digression Blake was a genius and Mr Chesterton is a journalist Blake s madness was perfectly reasonable and extremely simple at bottom He   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  believed that man was at one time perfect but that he had fallen into imperfection and error because he preferred to exalt certain qualities over certain others instead of living in eternity as Blake called it or as Spinoza might have called it seeing all things sub specie ternitatis Thus Albion the perfect man first exalted his emotions over his intellect Then his rebellious instincts got the better of the emotional judgments of his intellect now hopelessly sentimentalized Then his merely animal instinct for existence conquered all three until at last his intellect divorced utterly from all contact with reality rebelled against the animal instinct in turn and went out alone in a world of stony horror and of darkness a charnel house of materialism to make laws for that world All this is plain and still plainer is Blake s intention when we grasp that he personalized these successive states under the figures of Urizen Luvah Urthona and Tharmas and their female counterparts Thus Blake explained the story of the world under the guise of a myth  But this is not all Blake like many other philosophers William James for example and Spinoza sought for a release from this endless circle of non entity He found it in three things first in the teaching of Jesus whereby mankind is delivered from the charnel pit of pessimism and negation through pity and forgiveness second in the doctrine of the Divine Right of Man as taught in the French Revolution third in the endless creation of a world of Art to set in opposition to the real world a fortress city which each   Yale Discovers Blake  man could build for himself and where he could be lord and master in his own house  Now this is not madness It is a philosophic system as valuable as any other and whose grandeur is unquestioned Blake however knew that philosophic explanations of the universe are of no value unless tested So he tested his by living it He became God as far as possible Socrates and he were brothers and had talks together and not only Socrates but Jesus Christ and the angels and even God Himself spoke to him through the imagination and were seen by him through the mind s eye  Madness No Had Blake been really mad he would have declared that such vision was given to him alone and not to other men But Blake insisted as Whitman insisted that what is true of me is every bit as true of you So to every man is given the Divine Power and Imagination and Blake spent his whole life urging others to use them Is there any spectacle more sublime than that of this poor man sneered and jeered at painting and writing his visions all his life long that others might share them I have never seen his hands idle except when he was sleeping said his wife after his death  So far Blake s doctrine is all of one piece Why is it then that in his Prophetic Books in which he gave this doctrine to the world we get not only confusion but contradiction It is because a scheme so vast as his was is utterly unrealizable by any one man Our desires and imaginations may be infinite but the machinery of our bodies our   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  vegetable existence as Blake would have called it is limited perhaps wisely and so all our desires cannot be achieved Were it otherwise we would wear eternity as a garment and we would have no further need for the material world or for human existence Yet Blake might have made his work more perfect from a literary point of view had he been a man to whom literature was the chief form of expression But we know it was not Blake was primarily an artist a painter and he lacked both the training the time and the inclination to weld the confused elements of his Prophetic Books into one great epic We must take him therefore as an unequal poet who planned a sublime structure but who was unable through poverty lack of education necessity of winning his bread and temperamental inclination towards another art to entirely fulfill his plans  Nevertheless it is necessary to point out that no one will ever realize Blake s true greatness as a poet who has not read Vala through from end to end Vala is Blake s supreme attempt at the epic Never again did he attempt so long or so connected a composition or one of the same breadth Vala is the story of the death and regeneration of all mankind The scene is eternity and the time during which the action is consummated is all infinity Page after page and passage after passage of superb poetry are unrolled before us At the conclusion the effect may be somewhat confused but we must admit that only two other poets in all history have ever dared to grapple with a theme of remotely similar extent These are Dante and Goethe in his Faust And   Yale Discovers Blake  we must remember that both of these poets show the same tendency to a lesser degree as Blake s work they present rather a succession of scenes than a closely connected whole We must remember also that Blake composed his work in about as many days as it took Dante and Goethe years to do theirs and then laid this rough draft aside never to return to it except as a quarry whence materials for both Jerusalem and Milton were obtained  These later works were written for a special purpose Blake by this time had passed middle age Oppressed by poverty stung by taunts of madness abandoned by his friends Blake was anxious to vindicate his position as an artist and a prophet Both Milton and Jerusalem are attempts to convert the public to Blake s theory of the universe and like all such self conscious attempts there is more thumping of the pulpit more expostulation more detailed exposition more symbolism than poetry Not that Jerusalem in particular does not contain much magnificent poetry But the whole scheme is unpoetic with its divisions into four chapters addressed respectively to the Public the Jews the Deists and the Christians and with its elaborate and somewhat wearisomely iterated attempt to prove that England is the spiritual Jerusalem or regenerator of the nations an attempt carried out through an extended and complicated symbolism of cities and states that taxes mind and memory to the breaking point  After Jerusalem Blake was silent Nothing proves the deep sanity of the man as well as his heroism better than   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  the fact that he concluded after all that his deeper message was not for his day and set himself again to art with what glorious results everyone who has seen the illustrations to Job and Dante can testify  When will the lovers of poetry and the students of Blake be given an adequate and a cheap edition of Vala Blake s masterpiece It is a disgrace to England and to America that nothing of the sort has been attempted Blake is not a poet who appears to advantage in selections It is to Professor Pierce s credit that he has given us rather longer blocks of Vala and Jerusalem than we so far have been accustomed to But his volume beautiful in typography binding and paper as it is is published at a price two dollars which sets it beyond the reach of the ordinary buyer The recent Oxford Edition priced at fifty cents is in some ways more complete and more satisfying for the beginner  Meantime there is the great Ellis Yeats edition as well as the late Ellis edition both of which are now out of print and unobtainable And in both of these the text notably of Vala is disfigured by emendations Vala may be only a rough draft but we want to read it as Blake left it Let us hope that Professor Pierce will so far succeed with his venture that he will venture further and will give us the one complete poem of William Blake that even in its rough and incomplete state comes nearest to being a masterpiece of epic poetry John Gould Fletcher   Claudel in English  CLAUDEL IN ENGLISH  The Tidings Brought to Mary by Paul Claudel translated  by Louise Morgan Sill Yale Univ Press  This poet this adventurer goes through life with his mind and emotions burning The flame lights up places darker than the night and before it solid things melt The earth and the grain and the flower which it bears the cow which gives us milk the good daughter and the bad daughter all are a congealed mystic breath and one thing is as simple and as wonderful as another  The bad daughter the poet s treatment of her is startling It seems as if this Frenchman was the first human being to discover the truth which seems so evident after it is brought before one that the human heart the mystic piece of live struggling flesh is of more importance than sin and virtue that sin and virtue are as compared to this real live thing a sort of external soil which might be washed off Not even Tolstoi who through all his life groped for this truth reached this extreme tolerance realized it so clearly We catch a glimpse of this now and then in W D Howells but not without some shade of snobbishness it is the fine lady like heart that matters Thomas Hardy and George Moore in Esther Waters have felt this but only for the flesh life of the woman  To this reviewer at least it appears that the poet s use of miracles is not so strained as it seems superficially The resurrection of the child is dramatically genuine and truth  POETRY A Magazine of Verse  ful even Ibsen would not have hesitated to use it It shows a dramatic intensity which is breath taking  The language is modelled partly on the prophets and partly on the modern vers librists and even in the translation which is excellent its beauty is evident as these extracts show The sky is beautiful but this is a beautiful thing too and even  worthy of God The heart of a man that can be filled leaving no part empty  Do not turn from me that face There are enough angels to serve the mass in heaven Or this bit of dialogue between an old man and his wife before he starts on his pilgrimage Anne Vercos The yes which will separate us now very low As round as the oui that formerly made us one His Wife speaking very low Yes Anne With his fire perhaps this author carries also a faint cloud but who would begrudge him this cloud in which his sensitive soul dwells as in a beautiful garden  Max Michelson  CATHAY AGAIN  The Great White Wall by William Rose Benét Yale Univ Press The heroic narrative in verse in which anthropomorphic  gods and brawny heroes stride through countless cantos of hexameter is necessarily out of vogue in these days of staccato short stories in vers libre and pithy etchings that reduce a life to an epigram Yet there is something in us that goes   Cathay Again  behind the vogue that escapes now and again from the stern censorship of our intellect and revels with a childlike glee in fierce bearded heroes with glittering swords in lovely maidens in distress in the color and gleam and swing of a crisp narrative in decorative verse And as for the Arabian Nights in whatever form we find them it will be a mercifully long day before we lose our delight in them  All these elements William Rose Benêt has gathered together into a really enchanting tale in his latest book The Great White Wall He has called for his enchantment on all the ancient sources on Kublai Kahn on ancient Cathay on Persia and India and Arabia but the enchantment remains authentic and Mr Benêt is at his happiest in evoking it The lines are everywhere agleam with color as in these from the description of the army of Timur the Terrible on the march Pheasant feather and peacock plume from many a marching head  dress glitters Bows on backs a crowd of archers bronzely swings along as one Herds of antelope goat and nihlgao straggle along the armies  fringes Mimics sorcerers and buffoons in parti colored costumes pass Dancing girls with golden anklets trip in the desert dust that singes High upheld above their bearers banners stream from poles of  brass Over all the embroidered arms of Samarcand the City Splendid Lion and Sun and Three Great Circles threefold realms that  signify Blaze on a banner of gold brocade And densely by his troops attended Odmar leading the Avant guard to a blare of terrible horns goes by   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Mr Benêt has avoided with real craftsmanship that pitfall of the narrative poem a too regular rhythm The framework of heroic measure is here but so well does he halt and vary it that nowhere even to the ear of the sophisticated is the sense rocked to sleep in the cradle of the metre and the ambitions and the love of Timur stand out almost as starkly as from prose In the end too while not losing the elaborate brightness of the key he lends a note of human truth to the tale by having Timur s spiritual defeat come at the moment of his greatest physical triumph  There is a distinct place in American poetry for Mr Benet s jewelled stories and it is to be hoped that he will give us more of them E T  OTHER BOOKS OF VERSE  The increase of public interest in poetry is shown by nothing more powerfully than by trade conditions the number of interesting books of verse which are being published and apparently sold and of anthologies biographies essays etc which belong to our province  We propose to group together for brief mention now and then books which would justify more extensive notice if we had the space or books whose authors have been so recently studied in our pages that there seems to be nothing especially new to say about them  Here for example is The Quest by John G Neihardt Macmillan Co a reprint of the best poems from his first   Other Books of Verse  three volumes 1907 1912 We have reviewed at some length this poet s more recent books and further pages would but repeat a certain feeling of disappointment Some of these poems seemed quite advanced when they first appeared but the art has gone a long way since then and many poets have raced past Mr Neihardt perhaps because they carry fewer impedimenta He is too much preoccupied with the masterful male attitude and with a diction and technique which seem old fashioned today the inspiration not being keen enough to carry the archaisms The Prayer for Pain is perhaps the finest poem in the book The Hymn Before Birth gives this poet at his worst in the second stanza and his best in the last  The Song of the Plow Macmillan Co by Maurice Hewlett is a rhymed English Chronicle dedicated to England long divided now made one It begins with 1066 and turns its flash light upon the wars of the roses the despotic kings the commonwealth Waterloo and other imperial episodes ending with a vision of the New Domesday the present war and all that its patriotic sacrifices mean for England Though Mr Hewlett is a poet by force of his own will rather than that of the gods this poem a fit subject for his muse presents its mediaeval episode picturesquely and rises to an eloquent patriotic apostrophe at the end  From the Hidden Way Robt M McBride amp Co New York indicates that James Branch Cabell a new Virginia poet has mediaeval loves not unlike Mr Hewlett s The   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  book is too long but it contains a few poems of real delicacy especially One End of Love which POETRY printed under the title Post Annas and perhaps The Oldest Story whose last line But life remains life s plagiarist sums up in a way the spirit of the book  Glen Ward Dresbach s first book The Road to Everywhere Gorham Press shows a dangerous facility enriched now and then with a true lyric touch A Road Song has a fine open air feeling in it a real shout and swing while Songs for a Violin and a few tiny songs like The More I Know of the Ocean and above all I Groped Through Blooms are exquisite Several are familiar to our readers  A sharp contrast is Smoky Roses G P Putnam s Sons by Lyman Bryson Here the pace is slow and heavy and the poet oppressed by modern miseries strips his verse bare of ornament The Flood is characteristic a stark description of the death in mad waters of a mother after a desperate effort to save her child Gratitude has a similar stern sincerity and now and then we have a good song in minor cadence like The Guest  A light and delicate touch has Antoinette de Coursey Patterson The Son of Merope and Other Poems H W Fisher amp Co Philadelphia is full of very fragile meshes but they gleam with pale gold and soft color Danaide for example is lovely  Horizons Four Seas Co by Robert Alden Sanborn are first fruits from a carefully tended garden The poet has delicate intuitions but not quite the necessary magic If   Other Books of Verse  only the sun would shine more brightly in his garden and the winds blow through it we should not care in what pattern it was planted But Lento in the imagist manner is a pretty thing  A Hidden Well Lyrics and Sonnets by Louis How Sherman French amp Co is a book of quiet songs genuine in their soft appeal because they present with a certain delicacy presonal and intimate moods of feeling Such poems as A Message Strangers Charm Mere Living and some of the sonnets are reflective rather than emotional not exactly lyrics perhaps but sincere and personal and gracefully done  Grandiloquent is a descriptive word for the style of Frederick Mortimer Clapp in On the Overland and Other Poems Yale University Press He piles Pelion on Ossa of words figures rolling phrases especially in the free verse poems a form which gives him too much freedom because the moment he cuts loose from the familiar iambic the meagre ness of his rhythmic instinct becomes painfully apparent  He is safer under the restraint of the sonnet form yet even then the efforts at sublimity too often achieve mere bombast as in the line  The night is like a snake Coiled lifeless on the twin vast brows of death One longs to suggest to certain poets a course of nursery rhyming to teach simplicity  H M   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  OUR CONTEMPORARIES  HOME RULE  In a recent Reedy s Mirror Vachel Lindsay has a few pertinent things to say on the subject of Home Rule for Poets One of them involves the critics or poets who prolong the barren discussion of the relative merits of free and metrical verse It is he says as dreary as the ancient scanning of the ward school pedagogues which he insists made many readers grow up to dislike poetry He might have added that in many cases we have heard precisely this class protesting most loudly against vers libre a case of poetic prudery so to speak indicating need of the services of a skilful psycho analyst Mr Lindsay says further The new free verse requires an ear that is first elaborately trained in conventional rhythms the people that like it best are apt to be those who love the old poets This is discriminating and true  Mr Lindsay also issues a challenge to American poets very consonant with his own philosophy of life to leave Bohemia at a suitable age as one would leave college and take up the life of a citizen of the larger world be it in Springfield Illinois or Davenport Iowa And he includes a reminder to the poet s home audience that it is absurd for utterly unknown labor leaders politicians merchants or bankers to insist that their local singer prove that he has won the admiration of the unborn of the whole wide world for all the ages to come before he is privileged to   Home Rule  sing the local songs Properly distributed he says there is room for a hundred poets one for each million inhabitants This is a good deal like the dream of the proper distribution of wealth but it is a good dream nevertheless Meantime however I wish we could count on an audience of one million for a hundred poets whether they are snuggling in imitation Latin quarters or planted out in the western cornfields I wish we could boast that much  A C H CORRESPONDENCE  A WORD FROM DR GORDON  Dear POETRY A propos of your aboriginal number don t you think the red man will be a motive of ever increasing importance in American art Undoubtedly some day we shall have a truly American music painting and literature and who shall doubt that the red man will infuse his genius into it I believe in both the rise and fall of man Primitive races not having fallen so low as is possible under civilization may be nearer to art closer to the universal creative spirit than we The greatest discoveries in biology have been made from a study of the lowly forms of life The Indian instinctively appreciates color line rhythm
