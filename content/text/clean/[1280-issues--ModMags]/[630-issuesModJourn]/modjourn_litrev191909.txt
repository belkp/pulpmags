General Headquarters of the French Army on the night of momentous decisions before the launching of the battle of the MarneThe confused history and strategy of that critical time becomes clear as mathematical demonstration under the author s magic of dramatic visionIt is as though he had watched the scene unfwold from a vantage point in the cloudsThe sense of perspective is there and the focus

THEE THUS ITS ENDROUGE by Ben Hecht MY friend lived with a dwarfed and paralytic nigger boy on the fourth floor of an apartment building where the city achieves the air of a fat and elaborately corseted dowagerThis was a dumbrectangular and virtuous buildinga symmetrical monument to the great and undisturbed norm of the cityIt was full of dumbrectangular and virtuous people who walked solemnly up and down the carpeted stairsinspired no doubt by the quaint hallucination that they were a living folkIn and out of this building and this street they passed with the dignity of the uncurious dead who nightly promenade the catacombsFrom the windows of his home my friend overlooked the funereal elegancies of a boulevard It is much simpler than suicide he explained to me when he had given me his address and invited me to walk home with him I give that as an off hand reason when people ask me why I live in this neighborhoodIt is not the real reasonAs a matter of fact I have my philosophy of backgroundsYou remember what Maldor wrote of methat I was a creature unworthy of my genius My friend laughedAs we walked he continued talkingIt was autumn and the air was colored like the face of a sick boyUpon the street rested a windless chillThe pavements were sombre as diving rainThere was an absence of illusion about the houses that we passedThey stoodgreat meaningless piles of redbrown and yellow brick etched geometrically against a denuded skyThe trees in the street were without leaves and thrust their gnarled and intricate contours into the shadowed airA pallor lay upon the roofs and there was a moon like loneliness about the windows beneath themAltogether a perversion of springtime was this daylike some morbid afterglow of May Most of all I like the trees when they are empty of leaves said my friendTheir wooden grimaces must aggravate these precisely featured housesPeople who see my work for the first time grow indignant and call me sick and artificialBut so are these treesPeople think of art in terms of symmetryWith a most amazing conceit they have decided upon the contours of their bodies as the standards of beautyTherefore I am pleasedto look at trees or at anything that grows and note how twisted and contorted such things are My friend laughedHe rubbed his hands together in a nervous wayJ lt is unfortunate he continued that I am a sculptorI should have been a GodehThen I could have had my way with peopleI would have made their bodies like their thoughtscrookedtwistedbulboushorribleI would have given them faces like their emotions and converted the diseases of their soulsinto outline Again my friend laughed and his voice grew somewhat sad What pleasing little cylindrical creatures we humans areWith our exact and placid surfaces thatwe call beautyAnd these grave and noble houses we erectYesI should have been a GodI would have had my way with people thenAs it is I have to content myself with clay We came to a tall red brick building ornamented with grey stoneand my friend motioned me to enterThe corridor was clothed in chaste gloom and into the nose came the odor of turpentinean excellent preservativeThe air was heavy with a benign inertiaWe mounted four flights of stairsMy friend knocked on a door and waitedAfter a pause the door was opened by a dwarfed and paralytic nigger boy dressed in a resplendent red and gold livery This is Goliath said my friend myservant Goliath answered in a childish giggleI watched him amazed as he moved awayHe had enormous feet and his legs were two pipe stems that touched at the knees and formed a wide inverted V to the floorWhen he walked these legsencased in tight red breeches and red stockingsstrained and overlapped as they dragged the great lifeless feet along in an imperceptible shuffleThe misshapen body leaned forward almost parallel with the floorThis gave him the unique air of a creature continually rising from some mysterious seatHis long bony arms vividly outlined in the tight sleeves of a red and gold braided monkey jackethung in complicated posture from his bulbous shouldersHis hands were huge and swollen and rested on the floor like an ape s when he was motionlessUpon the body was set a great black headAs he crept away from us the head lolled about as if struggling to detach itselfHis mouth remained opened and his eyes rolled toward meI caught glimpses of his faceregarding me between the tumblings of his headwitha curious paralytic leerHe seemed to me at first an idiotBut as he drew away I acquired another impressionThe tortuous gesture of his walk gave him an air of cunning and gravityMy friend was smiling at meI shrugged my shoulders and said What an ingenuity of movement The dwarfalready half way down the halltwisted his body around and became motionlessHis face remained lifted toward meIt was seemingly a boneless faceits black features flattened into the outlines of a malicious caricature Go onGoliath said my friend softlyA giggle came from the dwarf and he resumed his shuffle down the hallI entered after my friend into a room which made me think of the inside of a burgundy bottleHeavy red curtains hung over the windows and the afternoonsunfiltering throughcast a rouged and sombre glow upon the wall and furnitureIt lighted with strange car nelian tints the monstrous clay figures that stood upon black pedestalsFor a number of moments my eyes refused to focus upon these figures which lay like niello confusions in the red gloom about meIn this unfamiliar light they had the air of things hurled into beingThey arose from their pedestals like some company of inert monsters balancing themselves upon the red airSlowly their outlines became fixed for mefigure upon figure in tortuous postures each like some inaudible shriekI approached one of them and looked at it closelyIt was a thing four feet in height but massive seeming beyond its dimensionsIts legs were planted obliquely upon the pedestal toptheir ligaments wrenched into bizarre muscular patternsIts body arose in an anatomical spiralFrom its flattened pelvis that seemed like some phallic bat stretched in flightto its giant neckthe figure pre sented an agony to the eyeBut despite its emaciation and the terrific unreality of its contoursthe thing bore the inconceivable stamp of a manIts arms were crowded and folded over the chestthe hands clutching talon like at the lower part of the faceIts head was thrown back as if broken at the neck and the mouth was flung open in a great skull like laughIt was on the whole the flayed and monstrous caricature of a man done so cunningly that through the abortive hideousness of its outline its human character became more and more obvious as I stared I call himThe Lover said my friend behind meI moved toward another figureHere the contours achieved a morbidity surpassing the firstI sought for some likeness to judge it bygargoyles I had seen and curious Belgian etchingsBut the violence of its design approached a horror I had never encountered beforeThere was an abominable elation about the thingIts bird like arms were wrapt about it in frenzied embraceIt had breasts that hung like curved handsLike the other I had regarded its bodydespite the epileptic distortionswas unmistakably human I call her said my friend A Virgin For half an hour I moved from pedestal to pedestal observing the strange monstrosities my friend had achievedUndoubtedly they bore the stamp of geniusIn the rutilant glare of the room they seemed more than frenzies in stonecontrived to bewilder and nauseate the eyeAbout each I noted the same elation that the figure calledA Virginpossessedan elation like the inverse of raptureI turned at last toward my friend and smiledHe was watching me from a divan against the red hangingsHis thin face was serious and the light of his eyes shone vividly What do you think he askedI searched about for adjectives and answered him finally I would like nothing better than to describe these thingsThey arouse delightful word patterns in my thoughtThey would translate well into black phrases and grotesque imagesIt is more difficult to tell offhandthoughwhat I think of themThey have the virility of some hideous diseaseThey are not symbols but rather depravities My friend nodded his head They are like trees he said Entirely naturalPeople who see them regret that I do not use my talents in saner and lovlier directionsThey mention RodinHaI don t often answer themBut I ll tell you He had lighted a pipe and was blowing violet snarls of smoke into the red air of the room I ll tell you he went on I have no ambition to be an artistI prefer imagining myself a God and having my way with people My friend laughedHis handquiveringtouched my arm These things aren t nightmares he whispered The one over therethe virginis a little girl who lives on the floor beneathAnd the man I call the lover comes whistling home from work every evening and I sometimes meet him on the stairsAndof coursethere s Goliath the little nigger you sawI shape them all like Goliath because I penetrate the accident of their contours He became silentI had previously thought him saneI began to feel now that he was notUsually deft and whimsicalhe had become shot with passionsHe startled me by resuming suddenly People often speak of what they call my insanityThere are so many beautiful things in the worldthey tell mewhy do you pick out only the uglyI seldom indulge myself in arguing with themI might say that beauty in art is the individual distortion that each worker brings into his workBut I don t actually believe that I m actually not an artist but an experimenter in divinity He jumped abruptly to his feet and cursedHis head was flung back as he talked and his words came in a chant I live in this red lightI live in this painted gloom because I hate the sunlightI hate even my rivals the treesI live in this house because about me here I find an almost complete annihilation of lifeThe damned and placid surfaces of people who talk to me fill me with hateThere s a rottenness on the earth called humanitycreatures full of miserable lusts and decays who go about smiling and obeying laws which protect them from each otherThey tell me of health and sanityGood Godmansanity is the merciful blindness which keeps us from seeing each otherHealth is the artifice of our bodies which keeps us from loathing each otherI have neitherI see and I loateI could live among people like these He swept the pedestals with his arm People shaped like dead treesPeople freed from the monotonous hypocrisy with which nature endows their outlinesYou ve seen lobsters and crabs and beetles and spiders and all the crustacean monsters that aboundThese aren t abnormal accidents of creationThey re the things that a God intent upon truth fashioned in the beginningEach thing to seem as each thing wasBut the courage of this God deserted him and he grew frightened when he came to give body to the human brainAnd he compromisedask the devils how he compromisedYesI could live among people like these and be contentAnd as there would be ho need of sanity I would be quite saneGoliathehGoliath His voice had risen to a shoutHe stopped and stared at the far part of the roomI turned and saw the black dwarf moving in the doorwayHis body was flopping about and his legs sprawling under himHis rolling eyes were fastened upon my friend and with desperate gestures he crept forward Come heregood little Goliath whispered my friend God had courage for an instant when he fashioned youHe did not compromise when he gave you outlineCome herelittle one A high pitched giggle came from the dwarf s open mouthGoliath stood at length before my friend who caressed his huge head with trembling handsDuring the several months that followed I saw my friend infrequentlyOnce I visited him at nightGoliath the dwarf admitted meMy friend lay naked on the red divanRed painted lamps burned in the room and the air was colored as it was during the dayAt another time I found him in a wonderfully elated moodWe drank together and he talked for hoursBeneath the generalities he had given me at first I soon realized lay a consistent and erudite philosophyI had convinced myself that he wasas standards goinsane and yet during this and several subsequent visits his genius for giving the contortions of his brain outline in stone caused me to doubt so simple a diagnosisAlways I noted that he talked best and most vividly when Goliath his dwarf stood humped before him while his nervous hands played over the huge head and bulbous face of the creatureIt was to inform him that I had arranged for a private exhibition of his work in an art store that I came to visit my friend for the last timeA cool spring light illuminated the morningThe mild sweet wind seemed to have bathed the stone of the houses and pavementsOn the trees innumerable points of green crawled like fat little insects through the airI mounted the stairs with the ambitions of a SamaritanWhat my friend neededI told myselfwas a changea trip into the countryCloseted in his red room with his hideous servant and the figures on the black pedestalsthere was dangerI knocked at the door and waitedThere was no responseIt was early and I thought perhaps my friend and his servant sleptAs I waitedhoweverI heard the sound of the dwarf s voice rising in a high pitched giggleThe crooked little laugh continued and the door remained unopenedI knocked again and then turning the knob found the door was unlockedThe room was flooded as always with redinundated in garnets and carmines and azalean tintsOn the divan against the red hangings lay my friend nakedHis arms hung to the floorThe red shadow of the curtains seemed deeper on his skin than elsewhere in the roomBut as I looked I saw he was covered with bloodhis flesh hacked into wet ribbonsOver his facebody and legs this deeper shadow in the rouge of the room moved cloudily Goliath I criedThe dwarf lay on the floor in the center of the roomA longivory handled knife was at his sideHe had toppled over one of the pedestals and lay with his long twisted arms embracing the figure of a virgin that my friend had made out of clayHis hands as they clutched at the thing left red marks upon itHe continued to writhe and gigglehis face pressed against the taloned breasts of the figureas I approached himHAPPY FAMILIES by Aldous Huxley THE scene is a conservatoryLuxuriant tropical plants are seen looming through a greenish aquarium twilightpunctuated here and there by the surprising pink of several Chinese lanterns hanging from the roof or on the branches of treeswhile a warm yellow radiance streams out from the ballroom by a door on the left of the sceneThrough the glass of the conservatoryat the back of the stageone perceives a black and white landscape under the moon expanses of snowlined and dotted with coal black hedges and treesOutside all is frozen and deadbut within the conservatory all is palpitating and steaming with tropical life and heatEnormous fantastic plants encumberittreescreepers that writhe with serpentine lifeorchids of every kindEverywhere dense vegetationhorrible flowers that look like bottled spiderslike suppurating woundsflowers with eyes and tongueswith moving sensitive tentacleswith breasts and teeth and

the floral worldeach of its eight tentacles is armed with a sting capable of killing a horseNow this is a most interesting and instructive flower the patchouli bloomIt is perhaps the most striking example in nature of structural specialisation brought about by evolutionIf only Darwin had lived to see the patchouli plantYou have heard of flowers specially adapting themselves to be fertilized by bees or butterflies or spiders and such likeWellthis plant which grows in the forests of Guatemala can only be fertilized by English explorersObserve the structure of the flowerat the base is a flat projecting pancontaining the pistilabove it an overarching tube ending in a spoutOn either side a small crevice about three quarters of an inch in length may be discerned in the fleshy lobes of the calixThe English traveller seeing this plant is immediately struck by its resemblance to those penny in the slot machines which provide scent for the public in the railway stations at HomeThrough sheer force of habit he takes a penny from his pocket and inserts it in one of the crevices or slotsImmediate resulta jet of highly scented liquid pollen is discharged from the spout upon the pistil lying belowand the plant is fertilizedCould anything be more miraculousAnd yet there are those who deny the existence of GodPoor foolsTopsy Wonderful sniffingWhat a good scentAston The purest

EditorsJohn Rodker Jules Romains Advisory Boardjh DISCUSSION Critical Suggestions by Jessie Dismorr Ascepticdoubtful of the actuality of artistic presentmentmight be the agent needed to clarify aesthetic thoughtIt is the atheist with his intellectual integrity who has defined the shapes of religious conceptionsAgainst such an attitude the discounted imagination with all its force rises inevitably in self justificationArtlike religionsuffers chiefly from the too eager belief and im pressiblity of its devotees and from their too low intellectual standardIt is surely under estimated the part that suggestibility plays in our acceptance of forms of beautyWe submitnot only to the suggestion of contemporary taste but of inherited modesThere is nothing so easily evolved as aesthetic predilections in active minds but has not the time comenot for new predilections but for a new mentalityThe European critic should purify himself from occidental prejudicesthe eastern from oriental onesabove all should the westerner be free from partiality for the OrientThe whole technique of painting is a business of minute symbolism The finished representative piece of any diplomaed artist is nothing but thatthe symbolism however is of the cheapest qualityBad art represents a poor mentality in other words an invention of poor symbolsA disposition of mauve and grey in gradation upon a flat pink surface does not connect it with the actual roundness of an arm more closely than would the untouched spaceShading however is the occidental writing for roundnessDespite the strictures of our drawing mastersa picture cannot be right or wrong it can only be good or badRepresentative art is a contradiction in termsHas the man in the street who believes that a picture should beexactly like naturerealized the essential nonsense of the phraseIn his favorite oleographic piece even those qualities common to the subject and its presentment are of the least obviousWeightsubstancesizeeffectpositionfor instancediffer completelyHis phrase requires that the portrait of a man should be the twin brother of the modelThere is nothing more enlightening than the strict examination of critical terms The Soulspiritual are terms for the use of theologiansthey cannot be rightly used in connection with the plastic artsThat which the soul is to the bodybeauty is to the plastic experimentNo aesthetic achievement was ever the outcome of a metaphysical ideaPictures of FaithHopeCharity are portraits of womenAll art has a physical basisSo calledabstract artis equally involved in this lawIt is open to the artist to make so wide an imaginative detour from the original starting point that he alone may realize from whence he has comeA certain superfineness of intellect might disdain anything like literalism in translationand seek by indirections the plastic equivalent to the original factAbstract art implies nothing vague or ill definedon the contrary an extreme liberation of essentials from the obscurity of literalismBeauty is the result of a certain arrangement of formsAll beauty is accidentalIt is a surprise chiefly to the craftsman of whom it has been the aspirationThe strongest aesthetic impulse needs the curb of the most exact techniqueA display of emotion and physical abandon in aboldtechnique is merely vulgarityIt corresponds to the manner of a gourmet who too obviously enjoys his mealThere is that in most good art that is the counterpart ofbreedingin fine personsit may be replaced by the naivete and simpleness that is thebreedingof peasantsAn artist can no more create new forms than a musician can invent hitherto non existent tonesThere is no shape that he can mentally conceive which has not already been made use of by NatureA picture void of content is an impossibilityThe least advanced student in a Cubist atelier has more knowledge of the elements of form than Sir Joshua ReynoldsThe whole of the eighteenth century school crumbles to dust when subjected to the tests by which a student s work would be judgedThere are certain artists whose work should be greatly praisedbut in a particular wayThey are not the producers of individual masterpiecesthey are technical analystsOf such are the ImpressionistsMonetRenoir and their schoolof such also are the CubistsFauconnierMetzinger and othersAll color can be reduced to the primary tintsall form to the basic geometric shapesThere are a thousand clever artists to one intelligent oneGood art lis concerned with the making of gods or of toysCreations of almost equivalent powerCimabue and the Egyptians realized the former achievementIn our own day some excellent toy makers are the painters PicassoWadsworthHerbinBraqueetcThe love of things delivers from the tyranny of the love of personsAesthetic delight is the most complete rest from personal claimsSuperior minds value beauty for itself and discount associationArt that is one step beyond the level of taste charms like a noveltyart that is two steps ahead hurts like an outrageIt is not sufficiently realized that the qualities of Michelangelo are as esoteric as those of Picassoand are understood of as few in proportion of those who see the workThe finest characteristics of all great art are difficult to appreciatethough its minor charms will be recognized at onceGreat art at first sight is often austere and repellantand if it is an advance in a strange direction must be soPicasso is a type of the most restless and unconvinced artistic intelligencelacking in character as all experimentalists of his type are lackingperhaps an aestethic PascalFrequenters of galleries are fond of saying I like thisI don t like that But how irrelevant are such remarksThe approbation of those persons was the painter s least concernThe artist who works for fame is less an artist than a humanitarianObscure leisure is an artist s daily breadfame is his wineDrunkenness is a common viceIt is possible that a fine artistic intelligence may be yoked with a halting executive facultyBlake and possibly Cezanne are artists of this typeNothing however can finally affect greatnessobscurityclevernessfameclumsiness destroy only the second rateOne must differentiate between the recipe maker such as Brangwyn whose every picture must succeedso knowing is the use of tone and lineand the medium of intuition such as Gauguin whose pictures have the good fortune of possible failureIt is a mistake to judge an artist by one or by ten of his worksA show of landscapes by Cezanne may exhibit not one of first excellenceyet if nine tenths of his work were unsuccessful it would scarcely affect his legacy to the ageEgyptian artists touched priestsqueenskingsanimals and they became godsthe Greek could not touch the gods without turning them into fellow citizensBy his admirations is the rank of a man eventually establishedThe mess and muddle of an artist s personal life is the chaos from which evolves the order of creation I have been amazed at Miss Dismorr s alphabetical statement of aesthetic ideasIt seems to me that she is either obviousas in her paragraph about the frequenters of galleries or confusedas in her talk of the intellect and the intellegence or untrueas in her talk of the intellect and the intellegence or untrueas in her statement about art having a physical basis andthe love of things delivering one from the tyranny of the love of persons There is no appreciable difference between the love of things and the love of persons both deliver into the same tyrannyEtc etc etc MCA Four Foreigners by William Carlos Williams FOR my present purpose it is not necessary to distinguish between the poet and the prose artistOne should know when a thing is worthless whether it be prose or verseI speak of the work of Aldington and DHLawrenceas represented in the July issue of Poetry and of the work of Joyce and Dorothy Richardsonas represented in the Little Review of the same month The first two offerto mean indecent exposurethe second two have managed to endow their work with the bloom of excellenceBut what I am really atalwaysis a statement of those things which not only every man writing today must know but which any man writing or talking in any age has had to knownot only to know but to feelIf one must name names it is merely the tag to one s visionWhat is one to seeIs it a colored sunset of words twisted into nameless patterns as if spewed from a stone mouthor is it greatness or mediocrity as they appear in the toil of a living creatureI do not try to illustrate my remarks with passages from men s workThe work they do is my speechThe poemsthe work of Aldington and Lawrence relate to the great warAldington has decidedly gone backward in these poemsLawrence fails because he has not lifted himself above his own excellencesIt is perhaps the war that has reduced themIn any case one looks in vain for a glimpse of distortiona glimpse of agonya glimpse of flame to rise counter to the gross flame of mud even that enveloped the armies in the fieldI do not say it was possibleI say merely that the thing is absent from these poemsThey are empty nonsense having no relation to the place or the time they were written inThey have no existenceIt has been said that no man could exist during the warIt is rated as a virtue that a man could for a moment think of anything at all that had any worth in itThen Aldington s work is perhaps the work of a genius of fortitudeNo poet was able to exist during and in the war as far as I have been able to find outBut that does not mean that the work of good men who went into the war and were rendered mediocre by it is to be accepted as excellentNevertheless one must imagine some iron genius in whom cannon fire found an echo in has own stomachIf no human mechanism is strong enough for that then indeed we had better know it once in all its terrible significance and kill ourselves or murder the cannon makersBut one must judge the situation as it existshave the poets in this case mounted to the impossible height of housing a war in their hearts equal to the hellish filthiness of a war of tedium and ennui such as we knewNononoBeautiful and of fragmentary excellence as these poemswhich I have not the space to quotemay bethey are utter failuresWhat is this silly invocation to love and loveliness of Aldington s especiallythis address to doves flying over the horrid trenchesIt is the invitation to amnesiait fogs over the values of the scenes as representedthe things exist not more fully but lessAnd of course this is what is intendedReading these poems the effect is the annihilation of a section of the man s existence which Villon s or Sappho s poetry never isIt is a denial of that existenceReading them one sees nothingnothing existsBut since one does not see the very things which the amnesic invocation to love befoggs one does not seeneither feelthe love the poet speaks ofFor that reason the poem is anew emptyA poet enkindled in his heart by love s desolateness or fruit fulness would see the light shine on the parapet at so acute an angle that the representation of it would be a love poemAand Lsay one thing over and overmodern or ancientwar or no warlove is always love and poetry is poetryAnd they say it as might be expected of them in a lovely mannerin sweet free verse and in quatrains and so forthwhich is appropriateHave I lost her lost her indeedLost the calm eyes and eager lips of loveThe two fold amorous breasts and braided hairThis is good writingit is charming versebut it might as well be a translation from the Chinese as it is intrinsically a translation from the GreekThe devotees of Beauty may clatter and scold about the head of a man but he must nevertheless voice his disgust at that which aghI prefer Aldington to all themenin the worldIt is not thatI am objecting to a certain work of art that it is not what it is notI know I am a foolI have the fellow in my armsI do not ask for cannon in a poem but I do ask for more than a drugged swig of lovelinessI ask for existencefor wide open eyes into which shells pass and explode with all their havoc sucked from them for secret purposesOr if death is triumphant then more than ever let a fellow die like any other stupid numbskullPoetry is not a despairing cry of defianceIt is not a bottle to nurseIt is an assertionI am here today in the midst of living hellI equal to any hell of gas or noise or sniper s bullet or disease and its fithAhI know that I am a foolIt is easy for me to writeI have never been in the trenchesI have never seenAll the more reason then for me to speak at onceIn these poemsthe present form of this war as opposed to all othersthe inventionstheI amI here todaybewilders me by its absenceThe poet must use anything at hand to assert himselfIf he cannot do so he is less than greatThe proof that I am I is that I can use anythingnot a special formula but anythingThat is the first necessityTo be alive nowhere today to the full so that one does not wear mental snowglassesLoveIt is not rice powderIt is a thing one carries everywhereIt puts a light on the point of a bayonetteit does not dim the bayonette out of existenceOr if it doesto hell with such loveJoyce and Richardson do not err in the way I have indicatedOf course they are not writing of the warnor is their work influenced thereby but I cannot help thatTheir form livesIt is not a bedIt is not to put one to sleepIt lives in its todayThey plunge naked into the flaming cauldron of todayInsofar as their form goes the war exists in itcarries its own meaningIt is a different warit is not like other warsit is modernit existsit is not a thing to spitlickThese two overlook or place in its proper corner the God damned insolence of sexof love as against the momentDoes one wish to exist anesthetisedWhat can one care if Joyce is lewd and in the streetif Richardson is charming and in a girl s bedroomThey are there and it escapes noticeWhere is the genius to touch the world and change itto reveal the truth among the lies so that the world will shine for old and youngfemale and maleA vision will do this and not a love potionLove is great but it is nothing unless it enkindle the sense of sightof smellof hearingIn Solomon s Song the poet saw her bellyher navel and the rest of it in terms of his day so that he revealed not only her but his love of herThere is no such vision in Aldington s songsThere is a running commentary about chalk trenchesetc but where is the fusion of his love with the whiteness of the chalk of the trenchesthe rumbling of the love with the rumbling of the cannon if you willLifenot under certain conditions but all the timeunder all conditionsThat s what they would answer me withLove under all conditionsPerhaps it is temperamentalIt is that life to me is first and love only exists when it is a dynamo or a leafAnd I still insist that unless they embody the special condition in their formthe form of what they saythey are not expressing their lovethey are simply fooling themselvesBoth poets have done better workfar betterlet it go at thatAldington in the July English ReviewBut these things pass overbeyond and away from me The voices of the men fade into silence For I am burned with a sweet madness Soothed also by the fire that burns me Exalted and made happy in misery By loveby an unfaltering love and there s the whole thing againSappho is to be praised not because she was a lover but because she was a poetThe form of her versethe musicit portrayed the fidelty of hervision It is not that she sang of love that made her greatnot because love soothed her but because love gave her VISIONit burned for her in the delicate vision she had of her boy s cheeks and hair and walk and mannerIt was only a pseudo madnessAnd that is her greatness and that is why she cannot be imitatedDHLawrence by Margaret Anderson I agree with DrWilliamsbut I want to say something further about the poetry of DHLawrenceparticularly the love poetry inLookWe Have Come Through To me MrAldington s vines and flowers and lovelinessetc are so preferable to MrLawrence s heavy humannessThe blind welter of the human struggle has no necessary place in lovenothing burns more dimly than this perfectly typical expression of perfectly average six reactionsIt s the Whitman feelingintellectualizedI have never known why Whitman has been considered a voice on loveany more than I have known why Henry James s love stories have been consideredlove storiesOne seems as sterile to me as the otherin relation to any conception of loveThegreat humanview is certainly always accompanied by some utter absence of qualityI know it is considered by most people as the infallible sign ofvisionin love this tortured turning and twisting of the soulthis obviousdirectuntempered expression of the purely human needthe elementary human impulsesThis is the essence of MrLawrence s feeling about lovehis idea of loveThis is as far as he hasseen It is identical with nothing in the world but thevisionof the man in the street I don t mean the man who neither thinks nor feelsbut the man who talks about beauty and means the worship of very pink sunsetsDOROTHY RICHARDSON by John Rodker Dorothy Richardson appears in this new instalment of her cycle to have made a tiresome practise of what was originally a rather engaging mannerOne feels and perhaps that is what oneis expected to feel that nothing now will ever be able to interpose between herself and this Juggernath of her WORKWith extraordinary and arachnoid patience she persists in still rebuilding her web under some strange persecution delusion that the observing scientist has destroyed itThis is absurdthe original statement stands the additional respinning only results in what was a bright and not unoriginal conception becoming thickened to the diameter of a hawserIn this welter of material the reader feds like a Kafir carefully searching for the diamond swallowed the day beforeMuch is irrelevantsundry sparkles attract but they are not the indubitable articleStill he cannot conceive of the stone being elsewhere and the search is protracted indefinitelyRead for a brief half hour Miss Richardson is interestingher perception is justher comments show a lively mindbut while the writer with a fresh mind on several consecutive morningsshall we sayworked out in a thousand words or more the passage of Miriam through a front doorthe reader can hardly be expected to consider it relevantor in any case to remember itThe method of whipping up enormous masses of material to coagulate a skeleton may be newit may be even exciting in an age where all our curiosity is a kind of sunday morning paper society gossipbut there can be no doubt that if anything in life may be said to be a waste of time this kind of gossip is itCarefully avoiding all hills Miss Richardson keeps brilliantly to exotic valleys so full of life that one is suffocatedFor myself I would rather have an impression created in one phrase than in tenMiss Richardson will probably sayyesif you can get the same impression but when one gets no impression one has a legitimate grievanceThe best literature allows a very small latitude but certainly therei efrom indications givenone is allowed a real if circumscribed manoeuvring groundbut Miss Richardson is a too familiar familiarher jogging elbow is always in your ribs disaster waits you on either sideBut no brain could want all this detailYet Miss Sinclair s article ire mains truethere is quality in this worksympathy evenbut as a scientific studyelse why so ponderousit is fairly valueless since with every appearance of allowing herself a free rein Miss Richardson has a particularly firm hand on the reinsHer method has been compared to that of JoyceThis is mere footling since anyone with a sufficiently sympathetic and cultured brain can follow Joyce and be moved by himbut Miss Richardson s associations are as free as a choppy sea and with the same effectMiss Richardson is too intellectually subtleIt s a very clever gamea very dreary analysisReverberation of thought carried to a certain point has no further valuehe knew she knew he knew she knew KISS by Emanuel Carnevali You think you can leave the matter to your lips and they don t work right and then it s two deadmen

Berdon s next door have bought a new car she tells me MrsBerdon will have things sumptuous even though the spindle breaks I look up and fondle her with my eyesWhat a mixture of idiomWhen there is too much flax on the spindle it may breakbut what a jump from spindles to motorsMy mind encroaches upon secret back things with an eager cravingI feel playful and would like to put a kerchief with a red crossstich on mother s hairI hoard a sweet secret against herHer white hair is making a petal frieze against the arm support of the rockerFragrant little aristocratThe rocker is soughing against the arbor and the stout stems weigh and bend as if breathing with a fecund tenancy of birdsMother Rosa peers through the vines The Berdon s car is a very big one she comments and inclines forward with a glow of movementI have started a Chopin waltz on the victrolaThe music comes from an interior roomand only the high vocative notes speak aloud It maks apretty murmurI like the evenings in the quiet Mother Rosa saysIt is very still in our streetThe lampman walks by with a high torch and the lighted lamp in front of the lawn makes our arbor shed changing liquids of silver and shadowsI should like to talk to mother of some of the things I knowMemories filter back complete in conception with all themysticity of sound and feeling in which I received themI have the entire pungency of Mother Rosa s youth within meBut I cannot tlel herI cannot unravel myself sufficientlyHow go backA trumpeting breeze is pulling at the rockerShe smiles at its moodMother Rosa is an alien in the pretty mid western city where we liveShe is from a landowner s cottage on the Danubealways an alien but this she does not knowShe has tried hard to live the life of her neighborsShe is smiling with a restful guile at the tease of the breezeLife has pulled as freakishlybut she does not seem to rememberThe present is lovely to rememberthe present aloneThe rocker weighs slowlyThe evening is pleasant Mother Rosa I breath softlyI say it as one would utter a sighI have the feeling of the lover who carries with him some precious talisman of the pastand the romantic madness that the memory is wholeunblownunchanged is mineHow could it have changedthings age by releaseand I have never released my image of Mother Rosa of thirty years agoMotherShe stirs from within the matrice of shadows made by the vinesBut I cannot go onand I hide my pass to begin talk by gurgling a fond smileShe has taught me odd little love movements of my headshe thinks I am coquetting with her Child she murmursHas she entirely forgottenPeople walk past with consciousclear treadas folk do in small townsThese intermittent sounds fall like the drop of hard rain on the deck of a ship Do you remember our ocean voyageMother I ask emboldenedThere is a silence Yesyes she murmursI think I will mention the word sailor to her le Matelot EudoreEudoreWhere is EudoreAnd that blessed ship the Fantasieso luscious in my memoryIt all seems to have vanished away like veritable phantasyIs Mother Rosa entirely unsuspectingWhy will she not allow me an entity with her pastShe cannot have entirely forgottenI remember so many thingsThere was the nobleman Con stantindon t you rememberMotherWhy did he wear the nail on his little finger two inches longTwo storks grandfather hadand because it worried him not to know whether it was his own storks that came back each yearhe stole on top of the farm barn one yearand painted with bright red the wings of the storks Ahbut it worried me not to know he used to say gravelyGrandfather was very tall and had a sandy beardHe talked littlebut when he did he liked to repeat several times what he had said Wellso I stopped my worry by painting the storkswingsand sure the same two storks came back My blood pulsates warm and beautifulI see a big field odorous in the hot autumnThe corn is standing in tall yellow windrowsThe peasant women are scattered over the fieldThere is a cryA big eagle has swooped down to the groundThe women s shouts echo through the hollow corn stalksand one woman tears the air in wildanguished lamentDid the peasant woman Sara ever find the infant with which the vulture made offMother Rosa welcomes my yearning gaze as one does the breath of flowers sprung anew on one s treesas a casual outpouringI feel the plaintiveness and the infinite breach that suggestion is I am of older acquaintanceof much older acquaintanceI should like to cry out to her I wonder why the Berdon s go out so much Mother Rosa speaks upand rocksShe turns and faces me directly because the wind has loped her shawl away from her body Why do you look me through in this way There comes upon me a great hate for the walls of the housePerhaps if I had talked with her ten years beforetwenty years agoI go back to the vanished ship Fantasie and to Eudore aloneEudoreThose funny pumpkin legsWe had been eighteen days out at seaThe ship had one boiler cold since the sixth dayInto our big steerage room each night came the sailor EudoreHe is fifty four years oldI know that because he made that number of rope knots for me That is for the sprightly years of old Eudore he saidHe made eleven knots in honor of my years upon the earthThe night which I remember as the eighteenth dayEudore came into the big steerage for the night watchswaying and tumbling on his legsThe ship wallowed in savage jets that tolled the ship like a wanton buoy When will the end of this journey come Mother Rosa asked in great fear What do you saymadamif we stop asking each other Eudore answeredThe steerage room occupied a third of the holdWe were two hundred people thereor moreLater that night I awoke giddy with the billing of the boatI lay in a net next to Mother Rosa with my brotherThere was a great clatterthe foolish boat reeling like a top spinning downThe tin plates which had been left on the long tables in the middle of the room scurried and danced in a crazy festivalA noisyboiling stream of water had poured inThe steerage was full of sailors shouting to each otherand there was crying and wailing from the huge circle of bedsThe water swished in gullies underneath our bed netsI watched the sailors work a long timeand then I fell asleep watching themI don t know how much later I awokebut the racket and the pounding was quieterSomeone was singing and I saw that old sailor Eudore dancingSuch comical dancing I have never seenEudore pranced to keep his legs from slippingand twirled himselfhis fat body going round like the hoops of an old barrelThose funny pumpkin legsHis face beamed and sweatedand raised itself into a red moustached moonso pervading it seemedand obliterated the room You are my best beloved my La Sorella a voice was singing in

downstairs into a large cold twilit basement room in which nothing was visible but the outline of a long tablelit from the end by a low windowI will light a lamp for you in a moment he said in his half cockney monotonemy friends will be arriving soon and until they come I should like to show you the sketches I made on my holidayShe sat down silentlyIt had been difficult to talk coming along the extraordinary Farrington Road grappling with the idea of paying a visit thereIn this still stranger room she felt nowhereA heavy blankness seemed to lie over everything and with his slow quiet speech MrBowdoin seemed here to reproach her more strongly for talking vaguely and excitedly about Devonshire than he had with his sudden searching look of surprise in the Farrington RoadAs he lit a little lamp on the corner of the table she glanced at the back of his head and imagined him sitting at a typewriter with it in curl papers and determined to be at easeWhat a jolly room she exclaimed with forced animation as the light went up on bare wallsWindsor chairs were distributed sparsely about the spaces unoccupied by the tablea cottage piano stood in a corner at right angles with the wide low window spaceAbove it was some sort of picturethe only one in the room although he was a sort of artistthe floor was covered with rough matting and there was no mirror above the empty mantlepieceIt is quite bohemian said MrBowdoin lighting the piano candles with the rest ofthe match he had used for the lampLet me take your cloakMiriam divested herself with swift obedience of her golf cape with which he disappeared between high hung curtains screening the end of the room opposite the windowThis was bohemiaShe tried to remember something about bohemia and thought of Trilby with her yodelling milk callIt would be an outrage she feltin this cold empty roomThere must be a special way of behaving in English bohemiaPerhaps when the friends came she would find it outBut by that time she would be worn out with looking at sketches and trying to think of things to say about themI have the sketches in a drawer here said MrBowdoin coming back through the curtains The Little Review and turning up an end of the table clothMiriam sat silent thinking the voice of the French artistAhC est le pied de TrilbyWeeD apres natureNongDe memoire alorsand the little poemou rien ne troubleraTrilbyqui dormiraand was presently taking one by one faint little water colour sketches and listening to MrBowdoin s explanations of the subjectsWhy don t you put them about the room she asked insincerelyWellthey re just beginningshardly worthy of exhibitionI hope to attain to something better in the futureShe could see nothing she liked and stared obediently and silently at sketch after sketch until her eyes achedA knocking at the door brought the strain to an endMrBowdoin went upstairs and came down again bringing a tall ladyWhen he had performed introductions the lady divested herself of her outdoor things which he stood hovering to accept and sat briskly down on a Windsor chair facing towards the piano and at some little distance from Miriam who sat enviously resenting her assuranceShe sat drawn up in her chair looking very tall and thin in a clumsy dress with a high stiff col larbandHer head and hair above her thin dingy neck werecommonUndoubtedlyShe looked like a post office young ladyIt was most extraordinaryShe was quite oldtwenty seven or twenty eightWhile the other people came in she sat very still and self possessedas if nothing were happeningWas that dignity not attempting to hide your peculiarities and defectsbut just keeping perfectly still and calm whatever happenedThere were two men and another womanThey stood about in the gloom near the door while MrBowdoin carried away their things and came back and murmured Miss Rogers and Miss Henderson and then sat down in a row on the Windsor chairs in line near the pianoTheir faces were above the reach of the lamplightTheir bodies had the subdued hushed manner of the less important sitters in a parish churchMrBowdoin was putting the little lamp on the top of the pianoThe light ran up the wallThe picture was a large portrait of PaderewskiIt was amongst Miriam s records of Queen s Hall posterscoming and going among other posters of musicianspassed by with a hurried glancesoon obliterated by the oncoming of the blazing flower baskets as she hurried down Langham Place sore with her effort to forget the reminders of music beyond her reachLooking at it now she felt as if all she had missed were suddenly brought to herher sense of thwarting and loss was swept awayShe sat up relievedbathed in sunshineThe room was full of life and warmth and golden lightSheeagerly searched the features for their secretthe curious conscious half pleading sensitive weakness of the mouth and china sort of nakednessas if a whole weak nature were escaping there for everyone to see and were suddenly reined inheld in and back in some way by the pose of the reined in headThe great aureole of fluffy hair was shaped and held in by the same powerThe whole head soft and weak in all its deails was resolute and strongit was listeningThe face did not matterexcept as an interesting Polish facethe pose of the head was everythingwith its grip on the features andthe haira face listeningintentlyfrom a burning bushThere was some reason not yet understoodwhy musicians and artists wore long hairThe lamp had come off the pianobut the pale outline of the face shone clearly down from the gloom and MrBowdoin was seated at the piano murmuring I will give you a sonata of Beethoven The long sonata came to an end while Miriam was still revolving amongst her thoughtsWhen MrBowdoin sat back from the piano she returned to the point where she had begun and determined to stop her halting circular progress from group to group of interesting reflections and to listen to the next thing he might playShe was aware he was playing on his own piano better than he had done at Tansley Street but also more carefully and less self forgetfullyPerhaps that was why she had not listenedShe could not remember ever before having thoughtsabout definite thingswhile music was going on and felt afraid lest she was ceasing to care for musicShe found it would be quite easy to speak oogllywith an assumption of great appeciation and ask him to play some definite thingJust as she was about to break into the silence with a remarkone of the big curtains was suddenly drawn aside by a little old lady bearing a tray ofsteaming cupsShe stood just inside the curtains her delicate white haired lace capped head bowing from side to side of the room graciouslya bright keen smile on her delicately shrivelled faceMy mothermurmured MrBowdoin as he went down the room for the traySlender and short as he was she was invisible behind him as he bent for the tray and when he turned with it to the room she had disappearedMiriam gazed at the dark curtains hoping for hereturn and fearing itNothing suitable to an enthusiastic bo hemian evening could be said in a courtly mannerShe accepted a cup of coffee without a word as if MrBowdoin had been a waiter and sat flaring over itShe felt as if nothing could be said until there had been some reference to the visionShe hoped everyone had bowed and remembered with shame that she had only staredEveryone seemed to be stirringbut the beginnings of speech went forward as if the little old lady had never appearedMrBowdoin had sat down with the men on the other side of the room and the woman had crossed over to a chair near Miss Rogers and was in eager conversation with herMiss Rogers had only lately joined musical circles she heard MrBowdoin say in an affectionate indulgent toneThat accounted for the way she deferred to him and sat in a sort of complacent exclusive rapturekeeping her man unchanged before the onslaught of the eagerly talking womanThe woman was in the circle and did not seem to think it strange that Miss Rogers should be a candidateShe was talking about some orchestra somewhereof something she wanted to play he conducting she finished in a tone of worshipHer voice was refined and she talked easilybut she also had the common uneducated look and she was talking about CamberwellMrBowdoin was a conductor of an orchestra Those people played in orchestrasor wanted toThe three men were talking in eager happy sentences and laughing happily and not noisilyThere was something here that was lacking in Miss Szigmondy s prosperous musical peoplesomething that kept them apart from the world where they made their livingThey worked hard in two worldswhen MrBowdoin was at the piano again they all sat easy and at homein easy attitudesaffectionately listeningThe room seemed somehow less dark and their forms much more visible and biggerThe empty white coffee cups standing about on the table caught the lightMiriam s stood alone at the end of the tableMrBowdoin had taken it from her but without entering into conversation and she was left with her prepared remark about the piano and her plea for a performance of the Tannhauser overture going unsaid round and round in her mindShe sat ashamed before the determined restrained impersonal enthusiasm that filled the roomEven Miss Rogers was sitting less stifflyHer own stiffness must make it obvious that she was not in a musical circleMusical circles had aworldly savoir faire of their ownthe thing that was to be found everywhere in the worldTo be in one would mean having to talk like that eager worshipping woman or to be calm and easily supercilious and secret like Miss RogersEven here the men were apart from the womento join the men would be easy enoughto say exactly what one thought and talk about all sorts of things and laughBut the women would hate that and one would have to be intimate with the womenand rave about 3m music and musiciansMrBowdoin had probably thought she would talk to those womenBut after talking to them how could one listen to musicTheir very presence made it almost impossibleShe was unable to lose herself in the Wagner overtureIt sounded out thinly into the roomPaderewski was looking away to where there was nothing but music sounding in a wooden room just inside an immense forest somewhere in EuropeShe began thinking secretly of theworld waiting for her outside and felt painfully that she was affronting everyone in the roomtreacherously and not visibly as beforeShe had got away from them but they did not know itMrBowdoin passed from the overture which was vociferously applauded and went on and on till she ceased altogether to try to listen and he became a strangersitting there playing seriously and laboriously alone at his pianoshe wished he would play a waltz and she suddenly blushed to find herself sitting there at allThey all seemed to get up and to go at the same moment and when they drifted out into the street seemed all to be going the same wayMiriam found herself walking along the Farringdon Road between MrBowdoin and the shorter of the twoother menlonging for solitude and to be free to wander slowly along the new addition to her map of London at nightEven with bohemians evenings did not end when they endedbut led to the forced companionship of walking homeThe tall manand the two women were marching along ahead at a tremendous pace and she was obliged to hasten her steps to keep up with her companions evident intention of keeping them in viewPerhaps at the top of the road they would all separateWe will escort Miss Henderson to her home and then I ll come on with you to HighgateTo Highgate exclaimed Miriam almost stoppingAre you going to walk to Highgate tonightThey both laughedOh yes said MrBowdoin that s nothingHighgateThe mere thought of its northern remoteness seemed to be an insult to LondonNo wonder she had found herself a stranger with these peopleWalking out to Highgate at night and getting up as usual the next morningMagnificent strong hard thing to doHorribleWalking out to Highgate talking all the time they could never have a minute to realise anything at allrushing along saying things that covered everything and never stopped to realizetalking about people and things and never being or knowing anythingand perpetually coming to the blank emptiness of Highgatetheir unconsciousness of everything made them the right sort of people to have the trouble of living in HighgateThey probably walked about with knapsacks on SundayBut to them even the real country could not be countryAllcirclesmust be like that in some waydoing things by agreementThe men talking confidently about themcompletely ignorant of any sort of realityShe came out of her musings when they turned into the Euston Road and ironically watched the men keeping up their talk across the continual breaking up of the group by passing pedestriansYou ll have to walk back she interruptedsuddenly turning to MrBowdointhe buses will have stoppedI never ride in omnibuses frowned MrBowdoinI shall be back by twoMiriam waited a moment inside the door at Tansley Street listening for silenceThe evening fell away from her with the departing footsteps of the two menShe opened the door upon the high quiet empty blue lit street and moved out into a tranquil immensityIt was everywhereInto her consciousness of the unpredictable incidents of to morrow s Wimpole Street dayover the sure excitement of Eve s arrival in the evening flowed the light footed leaping sense of a day new begunan inexhaustible blissfulnesseverything melted away into itIt seemed to smite hercalling for some spoken acknowledgement of its presencealive and real in the heart of the London darknessIt was not her fault that Eve was not coming to stay at Tansley StreetIt came out of the way life arranged itself as long as you did not try to interfereRoaming along in the twilight she lost consciousness of everything but the passage of dark silent buildingsthe drawing away under her feet of the varying flags of the pavementthe waxing and waning along the pavement of the streams of lamp lightthe distant murmuring tide to a happy symphony of recognizable noisesthe sud the gradual approach of a thoroughfarethe rising of the murmuring tide to a happy symphony of recognisable noisesthe sudden glare of yellow shop light under her feetthe wide black roadthe joy of the need for the understanding sweeping glance from right to left as she moved across itthe sense of being swept across in an easy curve drawn by the kindly calculable swing of the trafficof being a permitted co operating part of the trafficthe coming of the friendly curb and the strip of yellow pavementcarrying her on again into the lamplit greyness leading along to Donizetti s To be continuedTHE CHINESEWRITTEN CHARACTER AS A MEDIUM FOR POETRY by Ernest Fenollosa and Ezra PoundThis essay was practically finished by the late Ernest FenollosaI have done little more than remove a few repetitions and shape a few sentencesWe have here not a bare philogical discussion but a study of the fundamentals of all estheticsIn his search through unknown art Fenollosacoming upon unknown motives and principles unrecognized in the Westwas already led into many modes of thought since fruitful innewwestern painting and poetryHe was a forerunner without being known as suchHe discerned principles of writing which he had scarcely time to put into practiceIn Japan he restoredor greatly helped to restorea respect for the native artIn America and Europe he cannot be looked upon as a mere searcher after exoticsHis mind was constantly filled with parallels and comparisons between eastern and western artTo him the exotic was always a mean of fructificationHe looked to an American renaissanceThe vitality of his outlook can be judged from the fact that although this essay was written some time before his death in 1908 I have not had to change the allusions to western conditionsThe later movements in art have corroborated his theoriesEzra Pound This twentieth century not only turns a new page in the book of the worldbut opens another and a startling chapterVistas of strange futures unfold for a manof world embracing cultures half weaned from Europeof hitherto undreamed responsibilities for nations and racesThe Chinese problem alone is so vast that no nation can afford to ignore itWe in Americaespeciallymust face it across the Pacificand master it or it will master usAnd the only way to master it is to strive with patient sympathy to understand the bestthe most hopeful and the most human elements in itIt is unfortunate that England and America have so long ignored or mistaken the deepr problems of Oriental cultureWe have misconceived the Chinese for a materialistic peoplefor a debased and worn out raceWe have belittled the Japenese as a nation of copyistsWe have stupidly assumed that Chinese history affords no glimpse of changein social evolutionno salient epoch of moral and spiritual crisisWe have denied the essential humanity of these peoplesand we have toyed with their ideals as if they were no better than comic songs in anopera bouffe The duty that faces us is not to batter down their forts or to exploit their marketsbut to study and to come to sympathize with their humanity and their generous aspirationsTheir type of cultivation has been highTheir harvest of recorded experience doubles our ownThe Chinese have been idealistsand experimenters in the making of great principlestheir history opens a world of lofty aim and achievementparallel to that of the ancient Mediterranean peoplesWe need their best ideals to supplement our own ideals enshrined in their artin their literature and in the tragedies of their livesWe have already seen proof of the vitality and practical value of oriental painting for ourselves and as a key to the eastern soulIt may be worth while to approach their literaturethe interest part of ittheir poetryeven in an imperfect mannerI feel that I should perhaps apologizefor presuming to follow that series of brilliant scholarsDavis LeggeStDenys and Gileswho have treated the subject of Chinese poetry with a wealth oferudition to which I can proffer no claimIt is not as a professional linguist nor as a sinologue that I humbly put forward what I have to sayAs an enthusiastic student of beauty in Oriental culturehaving spent a large portion of my years in close relation with OrientalsI could not but breathe in something of the poetry incarnated in their livesI have been for the most part moved to my temerity by personal considerationsAn unfortunate belief has spread both in England and in America that Chinese and Japanese poetry are hardly more than an amusementtrivialchildishand not to be reckoned in the world s serious literary performanceI have heard well known sinologues state thatsave for the purpose of professional linguistic scholarshipthese branches of poetry are fields too barren to repay the toil necessary for their cultivationNow my own impression has been so radically and diametrically opposed to such a conclusionthat a sheer enthusiasm of generosity has driven me to wish to share with other occidentals my newly discovered joyEither I am pleasingly self deceived in my positive delightor else there must be some lack of aesthetic sympathy and of poetic feeling in the accepted methods of presenting the poetry of ChinaI submit my causes of joyFailure or success in presenting any alien poetry in English must depend largely upon poetic workmanshipin the chosen mediumIt was perhaps too much to expect that aged scholars who had spent their youth in gladiatorial combats with the refactory Chinese chaaracters should succeed also as poetsEven Grek verse might have fared equally The apology was unnecessarybut Professor Fenollosa saw fit to make itand I therefore transcribe his wordsEP ill had its purveyors been perforce content with provincial standards of English rhymingSinologues should remember that the purpose of poetical translation is the poetrynot the verbal definitions in dictionariesOne modest merit I mayperhapsclaim for my workit represents for the first time a Japanese school of study in Chinese cultureHitherto Europeans have been somewhat at the mercy of contemporary Chinese scholarshipSeveral centuries ago China lost much of her creative selfand of her insight into the causes of her own lifebut her original spirit still livesgrowsinterpretstransferred to Japan in all its original freshnessThe Japanese to day represent a stage of culture roughly corresponding to that of China under the Sung dynastyI have been fortunate in studying for many years as a private pupil under Professor Kainan Moriwho is probably the greatest living authority on Chinese poetryHe has recently been called to a chair in the Imperial University of TokioMy subject is poetrynot languageyet the roots of poetry are in languageIn the study of a language so alien in form to ours as is Chinese in its written characterit is necessary to inquire how those universal elements of form which constitute poetics can derive appropriate nutrimentIn what sense can versewritten in terms of visible hieroglyphicsbe reckoned true poetryIt might seem that poetrywhich like music is a time artweaving its unities out of successive impressions of soundcould with difficulty assimilate a verbal medium consisting largely of semi pictorial appeals to the eyeContrastfor exampleGray s lineThe curfew tolls the knell of parting daywith the Chinese lineMoon rays like pure snow Unless the sound of the latter be givenwhat have they in commonIt is not enough to adduce that each contains a certain body of prosaic meaningfor the question ishow can the Chinese line implyas formthe very element that distinguishes poetry from proseOn second glanceit is seen that the Chinese wordsthough visibleoccur in just as necessary an order as the phonetic symbols of GrayAll that poetic form requires is a regular and flexible sequenceas plastic as thought itselfThe charactters may be seen and readsilently by the eyeone after the otherMoon rays like pure snow to be continued GRUMIAUX Guarantees These Lowest Prices for 30 Days Only Established 33
