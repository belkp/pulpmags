POEMS  BY ARTHUR DAVISON FICKE  SWINBURNE AN ELEGY  THE autumn dusk not yearly but eternal Is haunted by thy voice Who turns his way far from the valleys  vernal  And by dark choice Disturbs those heights which from the low lying land Rise sheerly toward the heavens with thee may stand And hear thy thunders down the mountains strown But none save him who shares thy prophet sight Shall thence behold what cosmic dawning light Met thy soul s own  II Master of music unmelodious singing Must build thy praises now   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Master of vision vainly come we bringing Words to endow Thy silence where beyond our clouded powers The sun shot glory of resplendent hours Invests thee of the Dionysiac flame Yet undissuaded come we here to make Not thine enrichment but our own who wake Thy echoing fame  III  Not o er thy dust we brood we who have never Looked in thy living eyes Nor wintry blossom shall we come to sever Where thy grave lies Let witlings dream with shallow pride elate That they approach the presence of the great When at the spot of birth or death they stand But hearts in whom thy heart lives though they be By oceans sundered walk the night with thee In alien land  IV  For them grief speaks not with the tidings spoken That thou art of the dead No lamp extinguished when the bowl is broken No music fled When the lute crumbles art thou nor shalt be But as a great wave lifted on the sea Surges triumphant toward the sleeping shore   Poems Arthur Davison Ficke  Thou fallest in splendor of irradiant rain To sweep resurgent all the ocean plain Forevermore  V  The seas of earth with flood tides filled thy bosom The sea winds to thy voice Lent power the Grecian with the English blossom Twined to rejoice Upon thy brow in chaplets of new bloom And over thee the Celtic mists of doom Hovered to give their magics to thy hand And past the moon where Music dwells alone She woke and loved and left her starry zone At thy command  VI  For thee spake Beauty from the shadowy waters For thee Earth garlanded With loveliness and light her mortal daughters Toward thee was sped The arrow of swift longing keen delight Wonder that pierces cruel needs that smite Madness and melody and hope and tears And these with lights and loveliness illume Thy pages where rich Summer s faint perfume Outlasts the years  VII Outlasts too well For of the hearts that know thee Few know or dare to stand   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  On thy keen chilling heights but where below thee Thy lavish hand Has scattered brilliant jewels of summer song And flowers of passionate speech there grope the throng Crying Behold this bauble this is he And of their love or hate the foolish wars Echo up faintly where amid lone stars Thy soul may be  VIII  But some who find in thee a word exceeding Even thy power of speech To whom each song like an oak leaf crimson bleeding Fallen can teach Tidings of that high forest whence it came Where the wooded mountain slope in one vast flame Burns as the Autumn kindles on its quest These rapt diviners gather close to thee Whom now the Winter holds in dateless fee Sealed of rest  IX Strings never touched before strange accents  chanting Strange quivering lambent words A far exalted hope serene or panting Mastering the chords A sweetness fierce and tragic these were thine O singing lover of dark Proserpine O spirit who lit the Maenad hills with song   Poems Arthur Davison Ficke  O Augur bearing aloft thy torch divine Whose flickering lights bewilder as they shine Down on the throng  X  Not thy deep glooms but thine exceeding glory Maketh men blind to thee For them thou hast no evening fireside story But to be free But to arise spurning all bonds that fold The spirit of man in fetters forged of old This was the mighty trend of thy desire Shattering the Gods teaching the heart to mould No longer idols but aloft to hold The soul s own fire  XI  Yea thou didst burst the final gates of capture And thy strong heart has passed From youth half blinded by its golden rapture Into the vast Desolate bleakness of life s iron spaces And there found solace not in faiths or faces Or aught that must endure Time s harsh control In the wilderness alone when skies were cloven Thou hast thy garment and thy refuge woven From thine own soul  XII The faiths and forms of yesteryear are waning Dropping like leaves   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Through the wood sweeps a great wind of complaining As Time bereaves Pitiful hearts of all that they thought holy The icy stars look down on melancholy Shelterless creatures of a pillaged day A day of disillusionment and terror A day that yields no solace for the error It takes away  XIII  Thee with no solace but with bolder passion The bitter day endowed As battling seas from the frail swimmer fashion At last the proud Indomitable master of their tides Who with exultant power splendidly rides The terrible summit of each whelming wave So didst thou reap from fields of wreckage gain Harvesting the wild fruit of the bitter main Strength that shall save  XIV  Here where old barks upon new headlands shatter And worlds seem torn apart Amid the creeds now vain to shield or flatter The mortal heart Where the wild welter of strange knowledge won From grave and engine and the chemic sun Subdues the age to faith in dust and gold The bardic laurel thou hast dowered with youth   Poems Arthur Davison Ficke  In living witness of the spirit s truth Like prophets old XV  Thee shall the future time with joy inherit Hast thou not sung and said Save its own light none leads the mortal spirit None ever led Time shall bring many even as thy steps have trod Where the soul speaks authentically of God Sustained by glories strange and strong and new Yet these most Orphic mysteries of thy heart Only to kindred can thy speech impart And they are few  XVI Few men shall love thee whom fierce powers  have lifted High beyond meed of praise But as some bark whose seeking sail has drifted Through storm of days We hail thee bearing back thy golden flowers Gathered beyond the Western Isles in bowers That had not seen till thine a vessel s wake And looking on thee from our land built towers Know that such sea dawn never can be ours As thou sawest break  XVII Now sailest thou dim lighted lonelier water By shores of bitter seas   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Low is thy speech with Ceres ghostly daughter Whose twined lilies Are not more pale than thou O bard most sweet Most bitter for whose brow sedge crowns were mete And crowns of splendid holly green and red Who passest from the dust of careless feet To lands where sunrise thou hast sought shall greet Thy holy head  XVIII Thou hast followed after him whose hopes were  greatest That meteor soul divine Near whom divine we hail thee thou the latest Of that bright line Of flame lipped masters of the spell of song Enduring in succession proud and long The banner bearers in triumphant wars Latest and first of that bright line to be For whom thou also flame lipped spirit free Art of the stars  TO A CHILD TWENTY YEARS HENCE  You shall remember dimly Through mists of far away Her whom our lips set grimly We carried forth today   Poems Arthur Davison Ficke  But when in days hereafter Unfolding time shall bring Knowledge of love and laughter And trust and triumphing  Then from some face the fairest From some most joyous breast Garner what there is rarest And happiest and best  The youth the light the rapture Of eager April grace And in that sweetness capture Your mother s far off face  And all the mists shall perish That have between you moved You shall see her you cherish And love as we have loved  PORTRAIT OF AN OLD WOMAN  She limps with halting painful pace Stops wavers and creeps on again Peers up with dim and questioning face Void of desire or doubt or pain  Her cheeks hang gray in waxen folds Wherein there stirs no blood at all A hand like bundled cornstalks holds The tatters of a faded shawl   Where was a breast sunk bones she clasps A knot jerks where were woman hips A ropy throat sends writhing gasps Up to the tight line of her lips  Here strong the city s pomp is poured  She stands unhuman bleak aghast An empty temple of the Lord From which the jocund Lord has passed  He has builded him another house Whenceforth his flame renewed and bright Shines stark upon these weathered brows Abandoned to the final night  THE THREE SISTERS  Gone are the three those sisters rare With wonder lips and eyes ashine One was wise and one was fair  And one was mine  Ye mourners weave for the sleeping hair Of only two your ivy vine For one was wise and one was fair  But one was mine   Poems Arthur Davison Ficke  AMONG SHADOWS  In halls of sleep you wandered by This time so indistinguishably I cannot remember aught of it Save that I know last night we met I know it by the cloudy thrill That in my heart is quivering still And sense of loveliness forgot Teases my fancy out of thought Though with the night the vision wanes Its haunting presence still may last As odour of flowers faint remains In halls where late a queen has passed  A WATTEAU MELODY  Oh let me take your lily hand And where the secret star beams shine Draw near to see and understand Pierrot and Columbine  Around the fountains in the dew Where afternoon melts into night With gracious mirth their gracious crew Entice the shy birds of delight   Of motley dress and masked face Of sparkling unrevealing eyes They track in gentle aimless chase The moment as it flies  Their delicate beribboned rout Gallant and fair of light intent Weaves through the shadows in and out With infinite artful merriment  Dear Lady of the lily hand Do then our stars so clearly shine That we who do not understand May mock Pierrot and Columbine  Beyond this garden grove I see The wise the noble and the brave In ultimate futility Go down into the grave  And all they dreamed and all they sought Crumbled and ashen grown departs And is as if they had not wrought These works with blood from out their hearts  The nations fall the faiths decay The great philosophies go by And life lies bare some bitter day A charnel that affronts the sky   Poems Arthur Davison Ficke  The wise the noble and the brave They saw and solved as we must see And solve the universal grave The ultimate futility  Look where beside the garden pool A Venus rises in the grove More suave more debonair more cool Than ever burned with Paphian love  Twas here the delicate ribboned rout Of gallants and the fair ones went Among the shadows in and out With infinite artful merriment  Then let me take your lily hand And let us tread where starbeams shine A dance and be and understand Pierrot and Columbine  Arthur Davison Ficke   POEMS  BY WITTER BYNNER  APOLLO TROUBADOUR  WHEN a wandering Italian Yesterday at noon Played upon his hurdy gurdy Suddenly a tune There was magic in my ear drums  Like a baby s cup and spoon  Tinkling time for many sleigh bells  Many no school rainy day bells  Cow bells frog bells run away bells  Mingling with an ocean medley  As of elemental people  More emotional than wordy  Mermaids laughing off their tantrums  Mermen singing loud and sturdy  Silver scales and fluting shells Popping weeds and gurgles deadly  Coral chime from coral steeple  Intermittent deep sea bells  Ringing over floating knuckles Buried gold and swords and buckles  And a thousand bubbling chuckles  Yesterday at noon   Poems Witter Bynner  Such a melody as star fish And all fish that really are fish In a gay remote battalion Play at midnight to the moon  Could any playmate on our planet Hid in a house of earth s own granite Be so devoid of primal fire That a wind from this wild crated lyre Should find no spark and fan it Would any lady half in tears Whose fashion on a recent day Over the sea had been to pay Vociferous gondoliers Beg that the din be sent away And ask a gentleman gravely treading As down the aisle at his own wedding To toss the foreigner a quarter Bribing him to leave the street That motor horns and servants feet Familiar might resume and sweet To her offended ears The money music of her peers  Apollo listened took the quarter With his hat off to the buyer Shrugged his shoulder small and sturdy Led away his hurdy gurdy Street by street then turned at last   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Toward a likelier piece of earth Where a stream of chatter passed Yesterday at noon By a school he stopped and played Suddenly a tune What a melody he made Made in all those eager faces Feet and hands and fingers How they gathered how they stayed With smiles and quick grimaces Little man and little maid How they took their places Hopping skipping unafraid Darting rioting about Squealing laughing shouting out How beyond a single doubt In my own feet sprang the ardour Even now the motion lingers To be joining in their paces Round and round the handle went Round their hearts went harder  Apollo urged the happy rout And beamed ten times as well content With every son and daughter As though their little hands had lent The gentleman his quarter You would not guess nor I deny That that same gentleman was I   Poems Witter Bynner  No gentleman may watch a god With proper happiness therefrom So street by street again I trod The way that we had come He had not seen me following And yet I think he knew For still the less I heard of it The more his music grew As if he made a bird of it To sing the distance through And O Apollo how I thrilled You liquid eyed rapscallion With every twig and twist of Spring Because your music rose and filled Each leafy vein with dew With melody of olden sleigh bells Over the sea and far away bells And the heart of an Italian And the tinkling cup and spoon Such a melody as star fish And all fish that really are fish In a gay remote battalion Play at midnight to the moon  ONE OF THE CROWD  Oh I longed when I went in the woods today To see the fauns come out and play    POETRY A Magazine of Verse  To see a satyr try to seize A dryad s waist and bark his knees To see a river nymph waylay And shock him with a dash of spray And I teased like a child by brooks and trees Come back again We need you Please Come back and teach us how to play But nowhere in the woods were they  I found when I went in the town today A thousand people on their way To offices and factories And never a single soul at ease And how could I help but sigh and say What can it profit them how can it pay To strain the eye with rivalries Until the dark is all it sees Or to manage more than others may To store the wasted gain away  But one of the crowd looked up today With pointed brows I heard him say  Out of the meadows and rivers and trees We fauns and many companies Of nymphs have come And we are these  These people each upon his way   Poems Witter Bynner  Looking for work working for pay And paying all our energies To earn true love For seeming gay Once we were sad I heard him say  NEIGHBORS  Neighbors are not neighborly Who close the windows tight Nor those who fix a peeping eye For finding things not right  Let me have faith is what I pray And let my faith be strong But who am I is what I say To think my neighbor wrong  And though my neighbor may deny That faith could be so slight May call me wrong yet who am I To think my neighbor right  Perhaps we wisely by and by May learn it of each other That he is right and so am I And save a lot of bother   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  THE HILLS OF SAN JOSÉ  I look at the long low hills of golden brown With their little wooded canyons And at the haze hanging its beauty in the air And I am caught and held as a ball is caught and held  by a player Who leaps for it in the field And as the heart in the breast of the player beats toward  the ball And as the heart beats in the breast of him who shouts toward the player So my heart beats toward the hills that are playing ball  with the sun That leap to catch the sun And to throw it to other hills Or to me  GRIEVE NOT FOR BEAUTY  Grieve not for the invisible transported brow On which like leaves the dark hair grew Nor for the lips of laughter that are now Laughing inaudibly in sun and dew Nor for those limbs that fallen low And seeming faint and slow Shall yet pursue More ways of swiftness than the swallow dips   Poems Witter Bynner  Among and find more winds than ever blew The straining sails of unimpeded ships Mourn not yield only happy tears To deeper beauty than appears  THE MYSTIC  By seven vineyards on one hill We walked The native wine In clusters grew beside us two For your lips and for mine  When Hark you said Was that a bell Or a bubbling spring we heard But I was wise and closed my eyes And listened to a bird  For as summer leaves are bent and shake With singers passing through So moves in me continually The winged breath of you  You tasted from a single vine And took from that your fill But I inclined to every kind All seven on one hill   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  PASSING NEAR  I had not till today been sure But now I know  Dead men and women come and go Under the pure Sequestering snow  And under the autumnal fern And carmine bush  Under the shadow of a thrush They move and learn And in the rush  Of all the mountain brooks that wake With upward fling  To brush and break the loosening cling Of ice they shake The air with Spring  I had not till today been sure But now I know  Dead youths and maidens come and go Below the lure And undertow  Of cities under every street Of empty stress   Poems Witter Bynner Or heart of an adulteress Each loud retreat Of lovelessness For only by the stir we make In passing near Are we confused and cannot hear The ways they take Certain and clear Today I happened in a place Where all around Was silence until underground I heard a pace A happy sound And people whom I there could see Tenderly smiled While under a wood of silent wild Antiquity Wandered a child Leading his mother by the hand Happy and slow Teaching his mother where to go Under the snow Not even now I understand I only know Witter Bynner   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  REVIEWS AND COMMENTS  The Story of a Round House and other Poems  by JOHN MASEFIELD Macmillan  NOT long ago I chanced to see upon a  well known page reflective and sincere  these words The invisible root out of  which the poetry deepest in and dearest  to humanity grows is Friendship  A recent volume may well serve as a distinguished illustration of the saying s truth Few persons I think will read The Story of a Round House and other Poems without a sense that the invisible root of its deep poetry is that fine power which Whitman called Friendship the genius of sympathetic imagination  This is the force that knits the sinews of the chief the life size figure of the book Dauber is the tale of a man and his work It is the story of an artist in the making The heroic struggles of an English farmer s son of twenty one to become a painter of ships and the ocean form the drama of the poem The scene is a voyage around the Horn the ship board and round house of a clipper where Dauber spends cruel grinding months of effort to become an able seaman on the road of his further purpose  Of beating thought into the perfect line   Masefield s Poems  His fall from the yard arm toward the close of the conquered horrors of his testing voyage the catastrophe of his death after  He had emerged out of the iron time And knew that he could compass his life s scheme  these make the end of the tragedy  Tragedy Yes But a tragedy of the same temper  as that of the great Dane where the pursuit of a mortal  soul s intention is more far more than his mortality  Unseen forever by the world part of its unheard melodies  are all the lines and colors of the Dauber s dreaming  At Elsinore rules Fortinbras the foe the fight is lost  the fighter has been slain These are great issues hard  unjust and wrong But the greatest issue of all is that  men should be made of the stuff of magnificence You  close the poem you listen to the last speech of its deep  sea music thinking Here is death the real death we  all must die here is futility and who knows what we all  are here for But here is glory  Only less powerful than the impression of the strain of Dauber s endeavor is the impression of its loneliness The sneers of the reefers their practical jokes the dulness the arrogance the smugness and endless misunderstanding the meanness of man on the apprentice journey has a keener tooth than the storm wind  The verities of Dauber are built out of veracities The reader must face the hardship of labor at sea He   must face the squalors the miseries If he cannot find poetry in a presentment of the cruel dizzying reality of a sailor s night on a yard arm in the icy gale off Cape Horn then he will not perhaps feel in the poem the uncompromising raciness inherent in romances that are true For the whole manner of this sea piece is that of bold free hand drawing of things as they are Its final event presents a genuinely epic subject from our contemporary history the catastrophic character of common labor and one of its multitudinous fatalities  Epic rather than lyric the verse of Dauber has an admirable and refreshing variety in its movement It speaks the high wild cry of an eagle  the eagle s song Screamed from her desolate screes and splintered scars  It speaks thick crowding discomforts on the mast with a slapping frozen sail  His sheath knife flashed His numb hand hacked with it to clear the strips The flying ice was salt upon his lips The ice was caking on his oil skins cold Struck to his marrow beat upon him strong The chill palsied his blood it made him old The frosty scatter of death was being flung  Some of the lines such as  The blackness crunched all memory of the sun  have the hard ring the thick packed consonantal beauty of stirring Greek   Masefield s Poems  Dauber will have value to American poetry readers if only from its mere power of revealing that poetry is not alone the mellow lin lan lone of evening bells though it be that also but may have music of innumerable kinds  Biography the next poem in the book sings with a different voice and sees from a different point of view the difficulty of re creating in expression here expression through words not through colors  This many pictured world of many passions  Biography too rises from the invisible root of friendship and bears with wonderfully vivid arborescence an appreciative tale of the fine contribution of different companionships to a life  Among the two score shorter lyrics of the collection are songs of the sea or of the country side chants of coast town bells and ports marine ballads and love poems This is however the loosest entitling of their kinds nothing but the work itself in its entirety can ever tell the actual subject of any true poem Of these kinds it is not to the marine ballads that one turns back again and again not to the story of Spanish Waters nor to any of the jin gling gold the clinking glass the treasure wreck verses of the book Their tunes are spirited but not a tenth as spirited as those of The Pirates of Penzance Indeed to the conventionally villainous among fictive sea faring persons of song Gilbert and Sullivan seem to have done something that cannot now ever be undone   The poems in the volume one does turn back to again and again are those with the great singing tones that pour forth with originality with inexpressible free grace and native power Again and again you will read A Creed C L M Born for Nought Else Roadways Truth The Wild Duck Her Heart and  But at the falling of the tide The golden birds still sing and gleam The Atlanteans have not died Immortal things still give us dream  The dream that fires man s heart to make To build to do to sing or say A beauty Death can never take An Adam from the crumbled clay  Wonderful wonderful it is that in the hearing of our own generation one great voice after another has called and sung to the world from the midst of the sea mists of England From the poetry of Swinburne of Rudyard Kipling of John Masefield immortal things still give us dream  Among the poems of this new book more than one appear as incarnations of the beauty Death can never take Of these perhaps none is more characteristic of the poet nor will any more fittingly evince his volume s quality than Truth  Man with his burning soul  Has but an hour of breath  To build a ship of Truth  In which his soul may sail  Sail on the sea of death  For death takes toll  Of beauty courage youth  Of all but Truth   Presen ces  Life s city ways are dark Men mutter by the wells Of the great waters moan O death O sea O tide The waters moan like bells No light no mark The soul goes out alone On seas unknown  Stripped of all purple robes  Stripped of all golden lies  I will not be afraid  Truth will preserve through death  Perhaps the stars will rise  The stars like globes  The ship my striving made  May see night fade  Edith Wyatt  Presences par P J Jouve Georges Crès Paris  I take pleasure in welcoming in Monsieur Jouve a contemporary He writes the new jargon and I have not the slightest doubt that he is a poet  Whatever may be said against automobiles and aeroplanes and the modernist way of speaking of them and however much one may argue that this new sort of work is mannered and that its style will pass still it is indisputable that the vitality of the time exists in such work  Here is a book that you can read without being dead sure of what you will find on the next page or at the end of the next couplet There is no doubt that M Jouve sees with his own eyes and feels with his own nerves Nothing is more boresome than an author who pretends to know less about things than he really does know It is this silly sort of false naïveté that rots the weaker productions of Maeterlinck Thank heaven the advance guard is in process of escaping it   It is possible that the new style will grow as weak in the future in the hands of imitators as has by now the Victorian manner but for the nonce it is refreshing Work of this sort can not be produced by the yard in stolid imitation of dead authors  I defy anyone to read it without being forced to think  immediately about life and the nature of things I have perused this volume twice and I have enjoyed it E P  THE POETRY SOCIETY OF AMERICA  The Poetry Society of America organized in 1910 was a natural response perhaps at the time unconscious to the reawakened interest in poetry now so widely apparent  There seemed no reason why poetry one of the noblest of the arts should not take to itself visible organization as well as its sister arts of music and painting since it was certain that such organization contributed much to their advancement and appreciation Poetry alone remained an isolated art save through the doubtful value of coteries dedicated to the study of some particular poet In the sense of fellowship of the creative sympathy of contact of the keener appreciation which must follow the wider knowledge of an art poetry stood alone detached from these avenues open from the beginning to other arts   The Poetry Society of America  The Society was therefore founded with a charter membership of about fifty persons which included many of the poets doing significant work to day together with critics and representatives of other arts the purpose from the outset being to include the appreciators of poetry as well as its producers It has grown to nearly two hundred members distributed from coast to coast and eventually it will probably resolve itself into branch societies with the chief organization as now in New York Such societies should have a wide influence upon their respective communities in stimulating interest in the work of living poets to which the Poetry Society as an organization is chiefly addressed  Since the passing of the nineteenth century poets the art of poetry like the art of painting has taken on new forms and become the vehicle of a new message The poet of to day speaks through so different a medium his themes are so diverse from those of the elder generation that he cannot hope to find his public in their lingering audience He must look to his contemporaries to those touched by the same issues and responsive to the same ideals To aid in creating this atmosphere for the poet to be the nucleus of a movement for the wider knowledge of contemporaneous verse the Poetry Society of America took form and in its brief period has I think  justified the idea of its promoters Its meetings are held once a month at the National Arts Club in New York with which it is affiliated and   are given chiefly to the reading and discussion of poetry both of recently published volumes and of poems submitted anonymously This feature has proved perhaps the most attractive and while criticism based upon one hearing of a poem cannot be taken as authoritative it is often constructive and valuable  The Society is assembling an interesting collection of books a twentieth century library of American poetry Aside from its own collection it is taking steps to promote a wider representation of modern poets in public libraries Jessie B Rittenhouse  NOTES THAT MASS OF DOLTS  Mr Pound s phrase in his poem To Whistler  American has aroused more or less resentment some of  it quite emphatic Apparently we of these states have  no longing for an Ezekiel our prophets must give us not  the bitter medicine which possibly we need but the  sugar and water of compliment which we can always  swallow with a smile  Perhaps we should examine our consciences a little or at least step down from our self erected pedestals long enough to listen to this accusation What has become of our boasted sense of humor if we cannot let our young poets rail or our sense of justice if we cannot cease smiling and weigh their words In certain respects we Americans   That Mass of Dolts  are a mass of dolts and in none more than our huge stolid fundamental indifference to our own art Mr Pound is not the first American poet who has stood with his back to the wall and struck out blindly with clenched fists in a fierce impulse to fight Nor is he the first whom we by this same stolid and indifferent rejection have forced into exile and rebellion  After a young poet has applied in vain to the whole list of American publishers and editors and learned that even though he were a genius of the first magnitude they could not risk money or space on his poetry because the public would not buy it after a series of such rebuffs our young aspirant goes abroad and succeeds in interesting some London publisher The English critics let us say praise his book and echoes of their praises reach our astonished ears Thereupon the poet in exile finds that he has thus gained a public and editorial suffrages in America and that the most effective way of increasing that public and those suffrages is to remain in exile and guard his foreign reputation  Meantime it is quite probable that a serious poet will have grown weary of such open and unashamed colonialism that he will prefer to stay among people who are seriously interested in aesthetics and who know their own minds For nothing is so hard to meet as indifference blows are easier for a live man to endure than neglect The poet who cries out his message against a stone wall   POETRY A M agazine of Verse  will be silenced in the end even though he bear a seraph s wand and speak with the tongues of angels  One phase of our colonialism in art the singing of opera in foreign languages has been persistently opposed by Eleanor E Freer who has set to music of rare distinction many of the finest English lyrics old and new She writes  In the Basilikon Doron King James I of England writes to his son And I would also advise you to write in your own language for there is nothing left to be said in Greek and Latin already and besides that it best becometh a King to purify and make famous his own tongue Might we add it best becometh the kings of art in America and England to sing their own language and thus aid in the progress of their national music and
