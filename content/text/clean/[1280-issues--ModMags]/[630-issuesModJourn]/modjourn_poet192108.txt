of a silence greater than all words Over the unspeakable dumb Everlasting hills With their muter herds Swifter than a blade that kills Mightier than prayer Fairer than the dawn When some dew yet remains unbroken Stronger than despair From the unspoken to the spoken While the heart rests momently Lovely as the half uttered words of a child More delicate more mild Terrible as the torn breasts of anguish   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  When strong wills languish Suddenly dreadfully exquisitely Love death and God shall come  SOWN  Rain and the patience of the planted field Grey skies that hasten to the need Of brown moistening earth and to the sealed Faint harvest in the unbroken seed Patience for waiting give us O planted men Who waits your budding and your heaped Flowers of death Again again Perhaps ye shall return the reapers not the reaped And braver than corn seed hid away together Of our meagre or our mighty yield Shall wake for the gathering in harvest weather  TO EARTH  Oh fortunate the waiting that shall end in wonder And blessed now the patience that is in thy biding For now are the herded clouds and the wild rain s thunder Over the roof of thy quiet seeds hiding  We too O earth shall need thy blessedness of waiting For the green flowering of pastures when the panting Storm shall cease though blood be the rain that is abating And men be the seeds of our wild planting   Charles R Murphy  WINTER  Now are ye lean O trees and shaped for soaring Over the sacred snow that hides the land Now after stress of bitter storms endured On the spent earth unmutinous ye stand  Only your faces now are turned not earthward However deep your roots are clasped there With the gaunt gesture of a saint s uprising Ye are the resurrection that is prayer  SPRING  Trees have a gesture of departure Yet forever stay Into what eager land they d travel No man may say  In the spring they stand on tip toe Yet self willed remain In autumn to let earthward Their hopes like rain  Yet forever a new spring cometh And their muteness swells To the voice of one long risen For long farewells  Who with steps of eternal patience In eternal quest   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Would venture a truth too lofty To be expressed  Whose heart at times is burdened When no dream consoles With a heritage too mighty For rooted souls  HUMILITY  Open the doors of temples scorn Their veils Yet in the flight of bird on sea In the fall of leaf from tree In the green patient spears of grain in the torn Sides of mountains where some verdure clings In all these things We have enough to brood on till we be Ready and humble as the corn  MID MAY  Put aside your words and there are left Stones of the grey walls and apple trees And in the flesh and mind and in what seems Birthing almost of an immortal soul Virginity and fortitude and hope Delicate as blossoms on the gnarled limbs White grey and green above the risen grass  Charles R Murphy   HOOFS AND HALOES  TE DEUM  Out in the hot sun I saw Satan stand He stroked the peaches with his finger tips And burst the melons open in his hand And squirted the fat grapes between his lips He cracked an apple and deep in the rift  Of snowy meat his yellow teeth he thrust A daisy from the grass he plucked and sniffed His fiery breath soon charred it into dust  He pinched the purple plums and playfully Took up his tail and twirled it round and round To lash the gold leaves from a maple tree And laughed the birds fled screaming at the sound He swung the boughs and with his sharp horns pricked The pears as they went swinging through the air And drove his hoof into the ground and kicked Stirring the damp earth through the grasses there Then tore the tangled undergrowth apart Till in its shadow he was deftly placed And stretched and said I marvel at God s art The earth could not be formed more to my taste  THE IDIOT  When earth was madly green he lay And mocked his shadow s dancing feet   Or from his laughter ran away To watch the poppies burn the wheat  But when the frozen leaves whirled by And colored birds were blown afar He climbed the bitter winter sky And hanged himself upon a star  BEAUTY IN FOURTH STREET  I  It was not strange that Beauty found Our path in June and eagerly Thrust up the gay flowers through the ground And put a bird on every tree  But strange it was when skies were grey That Beauty followed where we led And sat beside our stove all day And lay at night upon our bed  II  I live with Beauty and across the way I see a shabby park where women sit And scold the dirty children from their play While old men shift their wrinkled legs and spit   David Osborne Hamilton  So close to me these dusty lives go past  Shall I cry out how Beauty came to me O futile lips be still O heart close fast  Break not with joy lest you set Beauty free  OUR TIME  Once more earth bellows with the lust  Of rolling drums Once more we win with fire The passing wind and perish for the dust  Of man s desire  Fierce as the tiger in the night And greedy as the swine that roots the clod Is man whose spirit of eternal light Moves into God  David Osborne Hamilton  MEMORY  I walked with you beside the orchard bars Where the still plum tree drops her whiteness down You kissed my brow your kiss was like a crown You kissed my mouth my crown was set with stars  Margaret Belle Houston   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  POEMS  ALL SOULS EVE  Hark do you hear the choral dead Forgotten now their pride Who on this night would have us know They passed unsatisfied  They shiver like the thin brown leaves Upon a sapless tree Clinging with palsied withered might To their identity  Their voices are the unearthly winds That die before the dawn And each one has some tale to tell And having told is gone  Ah you who come with sea blue eyes And dead these hundred years Be satisfied I hold the cup Still brimming with your tears  CHINESE EPITAPH  She was a Manchu lady Near the tomb where she lies   Florence Kilpatrick Mixter  Broods an ancient Buddha with robes of jade and of coral And curious lapis blue eyes  She was a wistful lady When the west wind sighs Inscrutable even as the terrible calm of Buddha Her impassive disguise  She was a Manchu lady Azure the skies And golden the tracery sealing the proud lips of Buddha As the west wind dies  ALCHEMY  They had no souls the envious ones They were blind to your heart s beauty Deaf to your spirit s voice And dumb in the presence of your holiness But they felt a vague warmth In their cold hands As you passed And so they reached out For your flaming soul Throwing it on their own dead altar fires Warming their numb fingers in the golden flame That rose to Heaven Flickered And went out   Somewhere among the scattered ashes Lies the matrix stone Of your imperishable beauty  INVOCATION  Tonight in sleep there came to me A dream where Christ walked on the sea And shipwrecked I called out to hear His quiet answer I am near But when the waves had risen high I doubted till I heard him cry Come take my hand beloved one The long and lonely night is done Fear not and you shall walk with me As Peter walked upon the sea  Who was it called The night is slow To answer but awake I know The clutching terror of the heart That feels the weed choked waters part And drowning rears a Christ who stands With dim remembered outstretched hands Who knows if Peter s Christ is mine Like Peter now I ask a sign If Christ still walks upon the sea  How calm is dawn on Galilee   Florence Kilpatrick Mixter  LULLABY  Come sleep Her heart s a wood anemone Her thoughts are swallows flown Across the dusk Her hair s a willow tree By the west wind blown Her eyes are pools where bubbles rise and break Dream bubbles from the deep Her soul s a moth that flutters in their wake Come sleep come sleep   Florence Kilpatrick Mixter  IT VANISHED  To C A B  Can it matter to you and me Where the hurrying years have fled Since they told me you ceased to be Since the day when they called you dead Death As a cobweb spun By night on the dew drenched grass It vanished I saw you pass With your face to the rising sun  Grace Hodsdon Boutelle   THE MOUNTAIN GRAVEYARD  High on the mountain where the storm heads are Lying where all may see there is a place As hideous and shocking as a scar  That mars the beauty of a well loved face Infinitely drear and raw and nude It waits and listens in the solitude  There is no friendly tree in all that square Of scattered stones and arid troubled clay Bleak as the creed of those who journey there  Hard as the code by which they lived their day It gives them all they ask of it its best No beauty and no softness only rest  But oh the pity of it all is this They lived with beauty and their eyes were blind Dreaming of far strong joys they came to miss  Those that were near So at the last we find No tenderness of blossom but instead Mute emblems of the longings of the dead  These rain bleached sea shells in an ordered row Tell of an ocean that they never knew Except in dreams which through the ebb and flow  Of years set seaward as the torrents do Always they planned to follow knowing deep Within their hearts that dreams are but for sleep   DuBose Heyward  And see these tawdry bits of broken glass Which speak the foreign glories of the town The crowds the lights these too are dreams that pass  Here where the hemming walls of rock look down And clasp their children fast within their keep Until they cradle them at last to sleep  Yet all the while if they could only know The beauty that is theirs to breathe and touch The whisper of the dawn across the snow  The vast low drifting clouds that love them much Oh they could call their dreams home down the sky And carry beauty with them when they die  DuBose Heyward  INNOCENT SLEEP  My little son half woke last night A golden headed rosiness Dark eyed with drowsiness  Peered for a moment at the candle light  So I have seen the daisies sleep Pink tipped along a mountain wall And hardly stir at all  At the bright dawn their dreams have been so deep  Nancy Campbell   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  DIRGE  To those under smoke blackened tiles and cavernous  echoing arches In tortuous hid courts where the roar never ceases Of deep cobbled streets wherein dray upon dray ever  marches The sky is a broken lid a litter of smashed yellow pieces  To those under mouldering tiles where life to an hour is  crowded Life to a span of the floor to an inch of the light And night is all feverous hot a time to be bawded and  rowdied Day is a time of grinding that looks for rest to the night  Those who would live do it quickly with quick tears sudden laughter Quick oaths terse blasphemous thoughts about God the Creator Those who would die do it quickly with noose from the rafter Or the black shadowy eddies of Thames the hurry hater  Life is the master the keen and grim destroyer of beauty Death is a quiet and deep reliever where soul upon soul And wizened and thwarted body on body are loosed from  their duty   Richard Hughes  Of living and sink in a bottomless edgeless impalpable hole  Dead they can see far above them as if from the depth of a pit Black on the glare small figures that twist and are shrivelled in it  Richard Hughes  TIMELESSNESS  We knew a timeless place beside three trees Where lights across an arching bridge were set And dark against the sky was flung a frieze Of human joy in shifting silhouette Figures of children swift and lovers slow Made us a pageant as they crossed the hill We called it being dead and watched them go Remembering when we were living still Now you have died and found those timeless nights Ours was a dream which you have made come true Three trees are there a hill a bridge of lights I know I know I have been dead with you I shall put off my grief my sick despair Since only joy is silhouetted there  Louise Townsend Nicholl   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  FOLK SONG FROM THE DANISH  Little Rose and her mother from the boat where it lay Bantered each other in the merriest way  Ha ha ha sa sa sa sa  Bantered each other in the merriest way  No lover shall wed me no matter how bold  Till trees in the garden bear blossoms of gold  Ha ha ha sa sa sa sa  Till trees in the garden bear blossoms of gold  From the porch thinks Hr Peder amused at her jest  Tis always the one who laughs latest laughs best  Ha ha ha sa sa sa sa Tis always the one who laughs latest laughs best  And when later they entered the garden behold From each tree was hanging a ring of bright gold  Ha ha ha sa sa sa sa  From each tree was hanging a ring of bright gold  But Rosalie scarlet as fresh dripping blood Kept both her eyes fixed on the grass where she stood  Ha ha ha sa sa sa sa  Kept both her eyes fixed on the grass where she stood  Then Hr Peder he kissed her still full of the jest Most surely the one who laughs latest laughs best  Ha ha ha sa sa sa sa  Most surely the one who laughs latest laughs best   Antoinette DeCoursey Patterson  LUCREZIA BORGIA S LAST LETTER  Before me shine the words of her last letter Lucrezia Borgia to the Pope at Rome Wherein she begs as life s remaining fetter Slips from her that his prayers will guide her home  The favor God has shown to me confessing As swift my end approaches Father I A Christian though a sinner ask your blessing And kiss your feet in all humility  The thought of death brings no regret but pleasure And after the last sacrament great peace Will be mine own in overflowing measure If but your mercy marks my soul s release  And here the letter finds a sudden ending As though the dying hand had lost its power My children to Rome s love and care commending Ferrara Friday at the fourteenth hour  An odor as of incense faintly lingers About the page of saintly sophistries And I am thinking clever were the fingers That could mix poison and write words like these  Antoinette DeCoursey Patterson   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  IN THE NIGHT WATCHES  INVOCATION  Kwan yin mother of mercies Kwan yin goddess of prayer Hear my voice at thine altar Heed my foot on the stair  Lo the rice bowl is empty  Toa tai smiles no more Sorrow lurks at our roof tree Ruin waits at the door  Kwan yin mother of mercies Kwan yin goddess of prayer Hear my voice at thine altar Heed my foot on the stair  PIERROT AND COLUMBINE  The gods are dead and we are old And we are old for now at last For now at last our hearts are cold  Our hearts are cold and love is past  Our love is past and even so And even so our dreams have fled Our dreams have fled and so we know And so we know the gods are dead   Margaret DeLaughter  REQUIEM  All the love the love we gave them Tears unanswered prayers to save them Now what is there left to show Wooden crosses in a row  They wore their crown of thorns so lightly June still blossoms just as brightly How can laughing roses know Of wooden crosses in a row  Is it then so sweet their sleeping After all was life worth keeping There they lie and none may know Wooden crosses in a row  TOWARD EVENING  The poppies just outside my door Still flaunt their crimson loveliness How can they blossom any more Now I have lost my happiness  Not any grief of mine can mar The beauty of this tranquil weather Each evening with the first pale star Comes that same thrush we loved together   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  And pours gold notes from every bough Of his old sacred apple tree But he has lost his magic now He cannot sing you back to me  Margaret DeLaughter  LOVE S PASSING  Gold as the sun Bold as a boy Your wanton wings waken  The love you destroy Leaving within the heart of each flower Longing for an impassioned hour  Shade of the sea Maid of the sky Your azure wings beat on  My heart as you fly Dreamily on in a happy trance Letting me wither with never a glance  Rare as a pearl Fair as a nun Your white wings inspire The love that you shun   Gladys Edgerton  Rising from passion and glad desire Into the sun s heart higher and higher  Flown from the world Blown like a breath You leave me earth rooted  And wedded to death Wasting for lips I have never known Hoarding my fragrance for you alone  MY SEPULCHRE  The flame blue of heaven glows overhead Under my halting feet crisp leaves burn red Oh what an ecstasy now to be dead  Oh what an ecstasy now to lie down One with the autumn earth pulsing and brown So in the sunlight to slumber and drown  To drown in a sea of gold melt into air Crisp with the tang of frost pungent and rare Sunshine my sepulchre wind my last prayer  Gladys Edgerton   POETRY A Magazine of V er s e  POEMS ORIGINAL AND DERIVED  THE TRIPLE SHROUD  This is the triple shroud Spun of a single thread  On spindles of the whirling worlds In thundering halls of dread It makes the living shine as flame  And resurrects the dead  Life is the shroud of love Woven of dust and breath Death is the shroud of life Love is the shroud of death  THE WAY  Some souls have slept with sorrow And some have walked with shame With both I went in shadows Through firmaments of flame To clasp the formless in the form The substance in the name  ONCE MORE  Once more I strip my shroud from me Once more unfurl my azure wings   Mason A Freeman Jr  Pursue athwart the reeling suns An ever dancing star that sings Of madder joys than I have dreamed And fiercer griefs than I have borne Yet would I burn between her breasts Behind the curtains of the morn  EPIGRAMS  The Poet  Up leaped the lark in flight And saw the dawn Singing above the night  The Untrammelled  Only the wind is free He shapes at will The sea s plasticity  The Beggar  The tulip lifts its bowl Toward sun and cloud To ask its daily dole  Weeping willow  Is it a maid I see With hair unbound Or a weeping willow tree   The Lotus  The lotus dreams that she May root in mud Yet steal off with the bee  On a Cameo  This image on a ring Is all that lives Of what was once a king  Late Mourning  Plum petals fall like tears Upon a grave Neglected now for years  Recognition  What seek you from the sky Long since The noisy geese flew by  The Prophetess  For years the earth has known Impending fate Each time the dead moon shone  FROM THE VEDIC  The Egg  What lies hidden in the shell Was born through torment deep in hell   Mason A Freeman Jr  And it will burst its bonds to sense Analogous experience And swing through poles of heaven and hell To lurk again within the shell  Ecce Homo  Behold the man indeed the inner self Who sits inside no bigger than one s thumb Who limbless moves and lacking eyes can see Scans all the past can all the future plumb  The Herdsman  I hail the wandering herdsman of the night The watcher and the shepherd of the stars Who points the pathway leading to the light And for the sheep lets down the golden bars  The Rosary  Within the all enfolding hands The worlds are being told like beads Lift up your eyes and look thereon What need have ye of forms and creeds  Creation  The moon was gendered from my mind And from my eye the sun had birth And from my breast the winds burst forth And underneath my feet the earth  Mason A Freeman Jr   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  BEYOND SORROW  SO IT BEFELL  When the day is long And full of pain I remember A certain little lane Where every night At half past seven The train flashed by On its way to heaven  There you and I Watching in the lane Dreamed of riding Inside the train Away from the wide Sun flowered plain And tall fields of High rolling grain  When night is long And strangely sane I remember A certain little lane Where on one night So it befell The train passed heaven On its way to hell   Eda Lou Walton  WITHOUT GRIEF  Beyond sorrow I have seen a pool Of clear green waters Without shadows And in it lay my body cool And quiet as a leaf And I have watched it lying there And seen the sunlight on it Now I come back and meet you Without grief  I WOULD BE FREE  I would be free of you my body Free of you too my little soul I am so tired of this mocking hobby I am so tired of this imaged whole  I would be neither base nor godly Loathing myself could I bear then To see all life and suffering oddly Twisted and shaped to the needs of men  I would be neither my own nor another s I would not tend for myself nor hate The flame of silence that in me smothers Under the crackling smoke of fate   God what is there for such as in me Cannot be two and are not whole Within the spirit dwells the body Upon the body feeds the soul  CRISIS  Then being aloof To give myself Was nothing to me Only leaves falling On the roof Were prophecy  DESPAIR  If the dream goes Does it matter Life remains compact Integrate whole And the living of it Is the same Day by identical day There is nothing missing  NOW MORE THAN EVER DIVIDED  Now more than ever divided Loving and yet not loving   Eda Lou Walton  A worshiper of your gentleness Demanding my own aloofness Now more than ever divided Two of myself two in you Reared as a tower of granite Bright on the last blue hill Crumbled and rooted with wild flowers Under the touch of your hand Torn as a leaf from a woodvine Colorfully tossed to the wind Caught with dry tendrils of yearning Close to an ancient wall  IN RECOMPENSE  Now for the long years when I could not love you I bring in recompense this gift of yearning A luminous vase uplifted to the sun Blue with the shadows of near twilight Here in its full round symmetry of darkness Burning with swift curved flashes bright as tears I lift it to the lonely lips that knew Its slow creation and the wheel of sorrow turning Take it with hands like faded petals White as the moonlight of our garden And for the long years when I could not love you Drink from its amber colored night  Eda Lou Walton  POETRY A Magazine of Verse  COMMENT  MIDSUMMER DELITE  HE poets should companion us in midsummer poets old and new so they be good ones And we shall like them the better if we give way to their moods a little instead of imposing on them our own In this time of our despair we should turn to the poets for guidance and inspiration toward manhood rather than sink into the degradation of utter unbelief in anything outside our small selves so wrote the Chicago Post s London correspondent not long ago Yes guidance and inspiration no doubt but why be so solemn about it We turn to the poet for delight and of delight even guidance and inspiration are mere corollaries  Delight let us remind ourselves is no cheap or vulgar emotion What says our faithful guide the Century Dictionary First we are told that our modern spelling is wrong we should return to the earlier delite for there is no etymological reason for linking up this Old French word with the Anglo Saxon light and its extinct guttural Delite then let us for a midsummer moment resume the old spelling comes from the Latin delicere to allure the same root which gives us delicate delectable delicious and the verb transitive means we are told to affect with great pleasure or rapture  I will delite myself in thy statutes sings the Psalmist to God himself   Midsummer Delite  Man delites not me no nor woman either cries Hamlet And in Macbeth we are reminded that  The labor we delite in physics pain  No delite is too rare to be cheap and too richly fine to be vulgar Guidance and inspiration spring from under its wings but so do gayety and all the keen little joys of sense Are few of us heirs of delite Do we take our little joys and big ones merely as fact ridden pleasures and without this finer imaginative zest Then surely we are cheated of our share of man s universal inheritance then surely we have a grievance against the world whose misguiding civilization has locked us away from nature and the other high original sources of delite then surely we must turn to the poets the artists the seers and take them out with us under the sky into the woods the plains the mountains set them against the play of winds and waves of sunshine and dark storns Somehow we must restore the connection regain and develop our souls capacity for delite It is a stark sometimes a bitter business it implies the stripping away of fold on fold of flesh and fabrics and mockeries It implies the strict sincerities of nature and of art  Perhaps the poets would be of more assistance in this business if we could trust them more if as I said above we could give way to their moods a little instead of inposing on them our own The man in search of guidance and inspiration resents a sense of humor in a poet criticizes a grotesque as if it were intended for a god   The tame man resents a wild fling of free verse the violent man resents the sonnet s rounded mold of sentiment The average man looks for peace in art resents its call to war looks for his own image in a poet and a flattering image at that Our standardized fellow citizens wearing their clothes doing their jobs thinking their thoughts all too much alike would standardize that incarnation of the untamable the poet As The Nation puts it  We do not banish poets from the Republic but try to make them over into the image of congressmen Is it necessary we ask to be so wild and passionate and heedless How are we to know that the fellow is a poet and not a poseur  And the paper advises  Let us be content not to know Better that ten thousand poseurs should have their little fling and fun than that one Shelley or one far less than Shelley should be wounded or restrained or silenced Can we not be liberated from this spirit of miserable thrift Let us admit the noble madness of poets and allow for it Our verse will be less cool and humble and diluted and more simple sensuous and passionate We stand in bitter need of a glow however faint of the Dionysian the unsubdued The universe as William James finely said is wild as a hawk s wing  So in our summer wanderings of body or spirit it may be well to practice a little spiritual lavishness Only by giving ourselves away to our poet companions can we explore their kingdom of delite It should be a proud companionship of the free on equal terms of challenge and retort of daring unflinching sympathy Almost any poet worthy of the name thus treated has much to give H M   Brazilian Dance Songs  BRAZILIAN DANCE SONGS  It may be worth while if I set down for the readers of POETRY some of the songs which I learned on a fazenda twenty seven miles from a railway in the state of Bahia in Brazil White people did not come to this place and I think it very improbable that any Brazilian has taken the trouble to note either the words or the music of these songs so full of atmosphere which are known to the vaqueiros Brazilian gauchos and to the country people in general who dance sometimes to the sound of a guitar sometimes to the combined stimulus of an accordion and a bean rattle but again to the simply rhythmic accompaniment of the latter instrument alone an affair made from a gourd and gaily decorated  This dance or samba may be varied but frequently it consists of no more than monotonous movements of the hips and an uninterrupted stamping of the feet The men usually heated to the proper pitch of enthusiasm by a copious indulgence in rum move in a hesitating circle each man with a hand on the shoulder of the dancer before him approaching and retreating as they face the women who make a similar approach and retreat the groups joining in the song which is half recitative The dance sometimes constitutes a method of lightening labor for when a hut is to be constructed the prospective owner invites a sufficient number of friends who dig the large pit in which the mud is to be mixed for chinking the frail walls of the palm thatched dwelling Here appro   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  priately intoxicated by their appreciative host the male visitors in the dancing attitude described above churn the mud with their feet while the women pass to and from the nearest water supply carrying and emptying large earthen jars to the encouragement of the singers who stamp and sway with a hypnotic motion an expression of mingled stupidity and exaltation upon their tan complexioned faces I give you a very literal translation of a song which I heard on one of these occasions In the original there is a marked regular beat but the singers interpret the music very freely with an undupli catable variety of minor quavers and resultant accidentals that show the African influence dominant over the Portuguese  I was a seven months child I did not drink milk from the breast of my mother Yet now they send me to the stream to pound their clothes  In my father s corral were a hundred cows From which the milk was taken to feed me Yet today they send me to the stream to beat the clothes  Ei Take the leaves from the poisonous corana little Bahian half breed  I have no heart Yaya But I go to wash your clothes  In regard to this one must recall that there is a traditional distinction in being a seven months child and that only mothers of the common people suckle their children Yaya and Yoyo are feminine and masculine terms of respectful address introduced by the Negroes   Brazilian Dance Songs  Another song begins  In my land there are palm trees little half breed Where the sabia sings Ei lei lei Yaya  Come here my pretty little lady  The birds in this place Can not sing like my birds  Ei lei lei Yaya  Come here my little miss  The songs one hears in more populous districts are many of them entirely Portuguese in origin and have the Latin religious naiveté One known I think from one end of Brazil to the other is called Noiva Morta The Dead Bride and the lines are as follows  When I die I shall be dressed like a bride With my hair flowing free under my veil They will say to each other Already she resembles one of the angels of heaven  My dress will be woven of jealousy And marked with cruel passion My wreath will be of the flowers of white longing And my sepulchre shall be in your heart  A lullaby which was often sung to my baby says  Hush hush hush Open the door Turn the lamp high Little Manoel Jose wants to nurse Little Manoel Jose wants to sleep He will not sleep in a bed But in a hammock of boughs Under the leaves   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  This little baby can not sleep in a bed Because he is accustomed to lie between the feet of Our Lady Saint Anna  And another favorite of the same nurse maid of extremely unpoetical exterior has the charmingly unconsidered verse  I will come to you singing In a cart filled with roses and pinks Our Lady will stand in the centre  And she will select for me the one of you who is most beautiful  And again  I saw the sea fringed with gold And I thought it was a cushion of blue velvet I saw the sea wound with streamers of white ribbon No I was mistaken There is nothing there But I see white faces rising up at me out of the water  Here is a bit which is particularly characteristic of an ingratiatingly elastic ethical consciousness  Negress Laurencia who gave you the lace  It was the shopkeeper senhora He is called Senhor Chico He is called Senhor Chico  Lace of silk threads Skirt of coarse cotton  O lady strike me Don t lock me up If I stole the lace It was because I needed it very much To make me a skirt For the procession of my saint  I think I can not end this reminiscence better than by   Brazilian Dance Songs  giving you the first two verses of the Fado de Hylario A  fado is properly a song of the people and the one noted here is of Portuguese inspiration and as well known in both Portugal and Brazil as Suwanee River or My Old Kentucky Home among us  Go away ashamed moon Get out of the heavens The eyes of my beloved Are far brighter than yours  Our Lady is knitting a pair of stockings With yarn made of light The points of Her needles are the stars And the stockings are for the baby Jesus  The above translations are from memory and in spite of the defect of ignoring the rhythm will I think give some idea of the temperamental qualities of the Brazilian people Evelyn Scott  ABORIGINAL TASMANIAN POETRY  The extinct Tasmanians are interesting in that they were the most primitive race that we have any knowledge of They wore no clothes and their only shelters were a few pieces of bark propped up for a break wind yet they decked themselves with shell necklets and had quite elaborate poetry Does not this prove that art if it does not come before utility at least comes directly after food before clothes and shelter In singing their songs two or three would take up the burden always at intervals of a   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  third Some listeners have likened them to the songs of the Arabs one I don t know whether he was a Scotchman compared them to the bagpipes Around their fire at night they sang of the doings of the day and very often some striking scene would be enacted If the acted scene was a success a corollary was born which passed on from tribe to tribe all over

Macmillan Co  It is a relief to some of Mr Robinson s admirers to find him once more in the U S A instead of in Camelot for to tell the truth he is much more at home here and the figures he presents are much more convincing Although there are in The Three Taverns certain studies of historic or legendary characters Hamilton and Burr Rahel Robert John Brown Paul of Tarsus Lazarus both books are

monologue or dialogue narratives Avon s Harvest the longest is perhaps the most distinguished With true New England frugality it weaves a closely knit formidable tragedy out of meagre materials a college antagonism a blow a long worm eating revenge and its creeping emotion of horror is all the more powerful perhaps because of the poet s restraint Probably a psychoanalyst would diagnose Avon s case as insanity delusions induced by fear of the serpentine ruthless being whose offensive love had changed into consuming hatred But such a gradual burrowing insanity was never more sharply and powerfully presented The thing is done with a kind   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  of cold thrift as effective in its way as Poe s lush and shadowed eloquence the music in the one case being slow and stern and in the other rich and full of sombre color Avon has a tonal almost monotonous beauty  You need not ask What undulating reptile he was like For such a worm as I discerned in him Was never yet on earth or in the ocean Or anywhere else than in my sense of him  Again  And having had one mordacious glimpse of him That filled my eyes and was to fill my life I have known Peace only as one more word Among the many others we say over That have an airy credit of no meaning  Last year s book The Three Taverns is mostly also dramatic narratives I confess that certain ones interest me intellectually but bring little emotional thrill The Hamilton Burr dialogue the monologues by Saint Paul and Rahel Robert and John Brown are searching essays in character analysis but they leave one cold There is more of John Brown s naming personality in a few lines of Lindsay s poem  And there he sits To judge the world His hunting dogs At his feet are curled  than in these pages of farewell to his wife and the world fine as many passages are   Robinson s Double Harvest  Could I have known I say before I left you That summer morning all there was to know Even unto the last consuming word That would have blasted every mortal answer As lightning would annihilate a leaf I might have trembled on that summer morning I might have wavered and I might have failed  The best line in the poem is fortunately the last  I shall have more to say when I am dead  There is no lack of fire in London Bridge a case of ill assorted marriage in which the pair hurl swathed rocks of hatred at each other these two are terribly alive Also in a marriage case less violent but more perplexing one is deeply moved by Nimmo of the velvet eyes  At his bewildered and unfruitful task Of being what he was born to be a man  And one gets completely the inextinguishable grace of the vagabond in Peace on Earth and the nothingness of Taskar Norcross  a dusty worm so dry That even the early bird would shake his head And fly on farther for another breakfast  But it is in Mr Robinson s meditative poems that one tastes most keenly the sharp and bitter savor of his high aloof philosophy He is not for Demos  Having all See not the great among you for the small But hear their silence for the few shall save   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  The many or the many are to fall Still to be wrangling in a noisy grave  He offers no solution of the problem of creation either in general or in detail but he presents it in vivid lines  There were seekers after darkness in the Valley of the Shadow And they alone were there to find what they were looking for  He insists  That earth has not a school where we may go For wisdom or for more than we may know  But meantime  Say what you feel while you have time to say it Eternity will answer for itself  H M  THE POET OF THE WAR  Poems by Wilfred Owen with an introduction by Siegfried Sassoon B W Huebsch English critics have been giving high praise to Wilfred  Owen s poems Now that he has achieved an American edition we are enabled to ratify their choice of him as the most distinguished poet of the War and join in their sorrow over his early death as one of its heaviest losses  Personally I find his work very fine indeed I don t think the much discussed Strange Meeting stands out far if any above the others Apologia Pro Poemate Meo or The Show for instance or the three lyrics Greater Love Arms and the Boy Anthem for Doomed Youth The experi   The Poet of the War  ment with assonance in Strange Meeting arouses interest but this is not the only poem by any means in which he uses alliterative assonance skilfully although here the scheme is more definite and obvious  Certainly there is nothing cheap about Wilfred Owen and if he was making propaganda against war in his verse as he might very justly he was consciously making poetry also which is what some of the other war poets forgot or failed to do In one or two of the poems in the latter part of the book one comes upon the vein made popular by Siegfried Sassoon and Gibson and others the sort of bloomin character sketch or satiric incident as in Chances or S I W in which someone wrote the mother of the soldier who had kissed the muzzle of his gun and shot himself Tim died smiling But these are below the level of Wilfred Owen s other poems although certainly not below this type of poem by Sassoon or Gibson  The trouble with these poems if one considers them as propaganda is that they do not propagandize They have a piquant flair for the easy chair reader quite as much as that first emotional reaction to war which was Rupert Brooke s For the fact is they represent war as adventure and on the page it matters not whether a man is killed in a trench or in a gun fight in Arizona the zest for the reader is the same And the result so far as propaganda against war is concerned is quite the opposite of the effect intended   But when it comes to the slow horror of such a poem as The Show or the subtle satire of Arms and the Boy or the pitiful hopelessness of Strange Meeting there you have the deep personal experience and revelation which is the only sort of propaganda and one might say of poetry that counts These poems are indeed at the opposite pole from Rupert Brooke s gesture of sacrifice and renunciation And yet the sacrifice is made no less with a mar velously cool restraint and clear perception This is what makes Greater Love such a fine poem fine also in sheer poetic quality with a certain seventeenth century perfection like George Herbert or Donne  To go back for a moment to the sort of satiric graphic sketches noted above what I mean about these is what Wilfred Owen meant  Nevertheless except you share  With them in hell the sorrowful dark of hell  Whose mould is but the trembling of a flare  And Heaven but as the highway for a shell  You shall not hear their mirth  You shall not come to think them well content  By any jest of mine These men are worth  Your tears you are not worth their merriment  Neither are we I have sometimes thought worth their stark tragedies or these trench paradoxes which furnish incidents for the poetic cinema so to speak so that poets also may become war profiteers It is this that I have resented in many of the war poems which like the war to end war were supposed to rid war of its glamour The   The Poet of the War  best of Owen s poems are far indeed from this and that is their virtue  Wilfred Owen evidently belonged to a later generation than Rupert Brooke in spite of the few years between them this not only in respect to his attitude about war in which change Brooke would undoubtedly have shared had he lived but in respect to his verse as well It is nervous sinewy closely packed His is a hardness and a precision that could it have been preserved past the Sambre Canal where he fell only a few days before the Armistice would certainly have achieved much He could not one feels sure have degenerated into any Georgian looseness of thought or structure There is too much aloofness in his poems for that and too much clear vision A C H  MR MASEFIELD S RACER  Right Royal by John Masefield Macmillan Co  The poem Right Royal by John Masefield is undoubtedly a splendid realistic description of a steeplechase written I should judge by one who has never ridden over a course but who being a good horseman has painstakingly covered every point in the race Particularly good is his description of the London betting commissioner s representative who visits the racing stables and his picture of the race crowds on their way vividly recalls Charles Lever s description of those making their annual pilgrimage to the Punchestown steeplechases   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  But whether Right Royal could really have won this race as he does in Mr Masefield s poem is another matter  After the most grueling race of some four miles to which a horse can be subjected it seems unreasonable to suppose this super horse capable in a run of four furlongs on the flat of making up thirty lengths lost by his mishap at the jump known as Lost Lady  Let me make this quite clear Compton Course on which the race was run was four and a quarter miles in length The first time around the course Right Royal lost thirty lengths at the hurdle and ditch Eighteen lengths he seems to have made up by the time he came to his Lost Lady jump on the second time around the course This of course took a great deal out of the horse  Now at the average speed at which steeplechases of this distance are run the horses were covering approximately forty eight feet a second about four and a half lengths Right Royal in pecking at the Lost Lady jump thereby coming almost to a standstill recovering himself and again getting into his stride must have lost some four seconds or eighteen lengths As he was twelve lengths behind when taking the jump he had thirty lengths to recover before overtaking his field in half a mile This is obviously impossible  Conceding a steeplechase to be the chanciest of races the poem nevertheless seems to convey the impression that the rider of Right Royal rather expected all the other   Mr Masefield s Racer  horses to meet with mishaps thereby enabling his mount to win A number of stanzas being entirely irrelevant should have been omitted for a four mile effort it carries too much hay But the poem as a whole is delightful and takes every lover of a thoroughbred well over the jumps with him and holds the interest from post to finish  N Howard Thorp  NOTE Because of the controversy as to whether Mr Masefield s hero is a real horse or a super steed of the poet s invention the editor submitted the book to a cowboy poet whose horsemanship is as famous throughout the West as his poetry  SONGS AND SPLASHES  Morning Noon and Night by Glenn Ward Dresbach  Four Seas Co  One may find a few fine lyrics in this book as in the two earlier ones which this poet has put out songs simple almost to obviousness but deftly and musically turned Such are three or four in the Burro Mountains and Apple blossoms groups which open the volume numbers three and four of the Fruit growing group the longer poem To One Beloved and the first of the Songs after the War These all but the last our readers have seen here is a shapely new one with a wistful ending  I heard a thrush when twilight came Sing of the woes it had not known Of hearts that burned in rainbow flame Of barren fields where seeds were sown   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  And then it sang of happy trees Where fruit is golden in the sun Of raptures and of mysteries Through which the songs of seasons run And I was sadder for the song Of rapture than the song of pain For one lost gladness gone so long Came back and could not hurt again  Of the longer poems The Nest of the Bluebird has a softly flowing dreaminess the dreamer recalling the many human lives of his wandering soul If only there were more magic in its tunefulness more invention in its phrasing and epithets more white alchemic fire in its motive power the creative zest behind it we should have a memorable poem somewhat in the mood of Tennyson s Lotus eaters but bearing a different spiritual inference  Sometimes one is more irritated sometimes it seems absurd that a poet who has studiously trained himself should do the obvious or banal thing with such an innocent air Certain of the narrative poems are too cheaply journalistic one would think The Colonel s Lady for example to be allowed typewriter privileges not to speak of printer s ink And how can an accredited poet commit such a crime as the second of these two lines  I cannot dine with you today And hear how all your wealth does good  or close a war song with such a meagre rhyme compromise as But Lord of Nations tell us That Wars no more remain   Songs and Splashes  A few of the songs remind us that the poet has lived in New Mexico and Panama but the impress of the wilderness of strange places is not very strong on a temperament perhaps too hospitable to the lighter and more facile emotions H M  MODERN AND ELIZABETHAN  The Poet in the Desert by Charles Erskine Scott Wood  New revised ed Privately printed Portland Ore Maia a Sonnet Sequence by Charles Erskine Scott Wood with two sonnets by Sara Bard Field Portland Ore Some years ago in September 1915 POETRY reviewed  the first of these two books then just published Let us reaffirm the opinion then expressed which referred especially to the Prologue now the poem s first section  Mr Wood proves himself a poet not only by the sweep and power of his vision but by the rich imagery and rhythmic beauty of his free verse at its best His special distinction is that he really enters into the desert that his poetry really presents something of the color and glory the desolation and tragedy of this western wonderland  The new edition of the poem is almost a re writing of much of it and for the better as it is relieved of a good deal of social and political propaganda  It may be difficult to judge impartially Maia coming as it does in all the luxury of Gothic type on hand made large paper with decorative illustrations singularly personal at least the frontispiece is confessedly by the author and of a beauty a bit amateurish perhaps but delicate and rare But one may safely record astonish   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  ment that the same man should achieve when well along in the dangerous middle years of life these two poems of different moods and modes the challenging radical modernism of the one and the old world freshness and acceptance of joy of the other  It goes without saying that Mr Wood is a more arresting poet in the western desert than in the Elizabethan garden The sonnets are perhaps inevitably imitative of Sidney or Spenser while The Poet in the Desert is the intensely personal work of a modern observer and thinker an impassioned challenge to civilization containing passages of beauty and power H M  CLASSICS IN ENGLISH  Sappho by Henry Thornton Wharton Brentano s The Golden Treasury of the Greeks by Alexander Lothian Basil Blackwell Oxford England Medallions in Clay by Richard Aldington Alfred A Knopf The Poets Translation Series Second Set The Egoist  Translators put one under no obligation to consider their work in relation to original texts not included in their books I shall assume no familiarity with the classic works involved but shall consider these books principally as English poems upon foreign and antique subjects  Wharton is the standard Sappho This new edition outdoes the former containing useful literal translations   Classics in English  a useless and elaborate life metrical versions from various hands and disastrous attempts at paraphrasis by Miss Anne Bunner He is not content with a single notion of the shifty poet pedagogue he must have them all an encyclopedia of Sapphos  Mr Lothian who has rendered the Greek Anthology has worked hard His neat rhymed verse is no more Greek or at least no less English than Herrick the comparison which he invites could not be fair to him At his worst he contrives an embarrassed jig rhythm At his best there are elegant stanzas like this  Yet there your nightingales as clear  Sing as they sang of old  The clutch of death is wide but here  Is what he cannot hold  Medallions in Clay contains the translations from Anyte Meleager the Anacreontea and the Latin poets of the Renaissance which Mr Aldington prepared for the Poets Translation Series published some time ago in England A writer dealing with a past age must decide whether frankly to outfit it in historical trappings costume etc or to transpose it into the idiom of his race and day which produces an effect consistent if bizarre see Synge s Villon and Petrarch Mr Aldington has done neither the one nor the other  All traces of period have disappeared He might have preserved the aroma of these verses more successfully if he had kept the original line divisions leaving the   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  words more or less in their original order This would not of course indicate the original tune but it might create another as in Miss Densmore s Chippewa translations or Arthur Waley s Uta Such rhythms are at least jagged and clash upon the ear whereas the sort of cadence Mr Aldington writes lulls the mind to sleep Contemporary poetic prose seems to be a variety of metrical molasses  Mr Aldington however is earnest and scholarly his translations are infinitely to be preferred to the hackwork of professors and they doubtless contribute much to the general culture of Anglo Saxons To do so may have been the aim of the various imagists whose zeal and study carried out the scheme  Except H D they share his shortcomings as well as some of his excellences They all have reverent and bland dispositions toward the holy classics they seem to have worked in a cloud of sweetness and light But I feel an absence of outline clear light sensuous precision and a corresponding tendency to the sweet and discreetly sentimental This is true of Mr Storer s translations of Sappho Poseidippus and Asklepiades and it may be said also of the work of Mr Flint and Mr Whitall in the  First Set  The Pound Fenollosa Chinese had faces manners garments dreams tangibles Most of these Greeks and Romans have none The archaic energy which must have animated their exploits military or imaginative is   Classics in English  nowhere to be found No race of men ever subsisted on sweet rhetorical distinction This absence of vitality is an effect of diction of sound of rhythm as in this from one of Mr Aldington s Anacreontea  I would drink stretched upon delicate myrtle boughs and lotus grass And Love with his robe fastened about his throat with papyrus should serve me wine  The solitary exception naturally enough is the work of H D She writes English as hard as Anglo Saxon and cultivates no continental suavities She has had the discretion to select for her contribution Euripides  Choruses from the Iphigenia in Aulis and the Hippolytus  which remained impassioned even in the swathings of Professor Murray s Swinburnian verse  T S Eliot in reviewing the First Set in POETRY some years ago noted that in avoiding such an English cliché as Achilles ran like the wind her version Achilles had strapped the wind about his ankles is contrary to Euripides I agree with H D who seems to feel that a modern poet need not reproduce with exactness phrases redundant or over familiar She explains thus in a note in the Egoist vol II No II  While the sense of the Greek has been strictly kept it is necessary to point out that the repetition of useless ornamental adjectives is a heavy strain on the translator s ingenuity the Homeric epithet degenerates into what the French call a remplissage an expression to fill up a line Such phrases have been paraphased or omitted  Even Greek rhetoric evidently had its false notes   What if these warriors and women of hers are not Greek The Greeks are dead We cannot put the mask beside the face to measure it It is enough if the mask moves and speaks He who knows no Greek has the right to say I will call these Greek for they are surely men and women they have substance they move with passion  They will lift their shields Riveted with brass As they enter Simois In their painted ships  Phaedra cries out on her sick bed  Take me to the mountains  Oh for woods pine tracts  Where hounds athirst for death  Leap on the bright stags  God how I would shout to the beasts  With my gold hair torn loose  The individual talent cannot develop richly without an historic sense One need not know all periods of the past but some consciousness of Time s moods one must have one must feel Time strangely garbed with unfamiliar talk or metric H D s Greeks at least for the moment are my Greeks It does not matter whether they any more than Shakespeare s Romans from Plutarch correspond with the latest or best findings of scientific historians They live are entities in the mind with alien behavior and curious looks and in the contemplation of them the poet may truly see himself in his own time  Glenway Wescott    OUR CONTEMPORARIES  THE DIAL S ANNUAL AWARD  Our much esteemed contemporary The Dial is setting a new pace for literary prizes by offering an annual two thousand dollar purse to some one of its contributors This is we believe the largest literary award ever made in this country may it be a hint to others capable of being moved by a generous sense of justice  POETRY from its first number has been urging prizes and scholarships for poets believing such awards to be as rightfully due in this art as in painting sculpture or music But we have not yet made much headway Meantime count the scholarships in art schools In this year s graduating exercises at the Chicago Art Institute art school one young girl sculptor received a thousand dollar scholarship and another an award half as large for the two best designs on the subject Harvest fifteen hundred dollars handed out as a matter of course just like that for a couple of nice little academic bas reliefs I saw them not to be compared for a moment with many poems we have printed by gifted but impecunious boys and girls who scarcely know where their next meal is coming from Why are new scholarships and prizes founded every year in art exhibitions and schools while it remains impossible to convince our men and women of wealth however liberally disposed they may be that the poets have much more need of such awards and at   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  present more right to them How shall we wake people up to the bitter injustice of the poet s meagre earnings to the lack of all financial recognition of his service  The Dial is doing well to make a generous move in the right direction  NEW MAGAZINES  New organs of this art are appearing so rapidly that it is difficult to keep track of them The Measure is now nearly half a year old with Padraic Colum and Carolyn Hall as its editors for the summer quarter Tempo published at Danvers Mass with Oliver Jenkins as editor and R Ellsworth Larsson as associate appeared in June And Voices A Journal of Verse is to begin next autumn as a quarterly with Harold Vinal as editor and Fiswoode Tarleton as associate issuing from Steinert Hall Boston  Besides these along the Atlantic we welcome also The Lyric West A Magazine of Verse which began in April at Los Angeles under the editorship of Grace Atherton Dennen 1139 West Twenty seventh Street It is designed to foster the poetic development of the expanding West though it will be an open market for the work of all verse writers of all places  Mr Vinal may not be aware that there is an English Voices an interesting magazine of progressive modern spirit devoted chiefly to poetry but including some imaginative prose a few drawings and a section of reviews and notes In the latest Summer Number which   New Magazines  is No III of Vol V we find poems by certain of our own friends John Gould Fletcher Louis Golding Isaac Rosenberg as well as an article on Rosenberg by Samuel Roth formerly editor of The Lyric who is now in England The editor of Voices is Thomas Moult whose poem of last summer Here for a Time our

but we received recently a copy of a monthly published by Cornish Bros Ltd in Birmingham England under the title Poetry with the sub title A Magazine of Verse Comment and Criticism Somewhat intrigued we inquired of the editor Mr S Fowler Wright whether he was ignorant of POETRY S existence when he adopted the same title Mr Wright promised to pass the query on to his predecessor the founder but we have never received an answer As POETRY is fairly well known in England the duplication of titles is hardly to the advantage of either magazine  NOTES  Mr Charles R Murphy a Philadelphian and a

and beauty presented are typical of POETRY S quality Thanks to a rare coincidence of poise and generous imagination of sense and sensitiveness it ranks as easily the best vehicle of poetry in the English language  In the London Times of Nov 25th 1920 we read  We need not linger over the many English and French contributors to this periodical We do have to note that it has published as it honestly claims much of the best experimental poetry written by Americans in the past eight years They have succeeded in their primary design to create a poetry which should be American in thought feeling subject and form That is after all a distinct achievement  The Chicago Evening Post in commenting on POETRY S eighth birthday said  No editorship is infallible but it is rather interesting and enlightening to look over the old numbers of POETRY and to realize that the first important chance for publication in America was given to many poets almost unknown who have since obtained fame We wonder how many more may yet be helped POETRY is so far as we know unique in the length of its life recognized position and rigorously artistic standard  POETRY 543 Cass Street Chicago  Enclosed find
