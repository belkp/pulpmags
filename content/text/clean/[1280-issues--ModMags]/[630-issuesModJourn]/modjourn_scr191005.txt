Ill answering advertisements please mention SCRIBNER'S MAGAZINE MAGAZINE NOTES In the June number Mr. Roosevelt will give the account of his  Elephant Hunting on Mt. Kenia.  It is a remarkable article in every way, and reveals in a most convincing manner the surprising breadth of his observation, keen in- terest in the picturesque and intimate aspects of nature, and a thorough knowledge of the natural history of the elephant. Every one who reads these articles by Mr. Roosevelt is impressed by his unfail- ing interest in and sym- pathy for the varying aspects of the landscape, the pictorial features that only a man with a line lit- erary and artistic sense would be impressed with. The region of Mt. Kenia, with its dense forests and jungles, makes hunting there not only hard work, but as well dangerous, for it is impossible to get a clear viewof the big game. Mr. Roosevelt says that   noother animal, not even the lion himself, is so con- stant a theme of talk and a subject of such un flag- ging interest round the camp-fires. He is  the most interesting of all ani- mals.   For centuries the ivory hunters and traders have gone into the savage wilderness in pursuit of the great beasts. One thing that makes the ele- phant especially interest- ing is his remarkable in- telligence.  He is unique among the beasts of great bulk in the fact that his growth in size has been accompanied by growth in brain power.  Mr. Roosevelt s description of the great forest where   in an instant the sun was shut from sight by the thick screen of the wet foliage,  gives a vivid impression of the mystery and luxuriantgrowth of the region. The game was finally sighted and the hunting afforded abundant excitement. One great bull charged through the tangle  so close that he could have touched me with his trunk.  The illustrations for this article by Kermit Roosevelt, are probably the most interesting ever secured of herds of wild elephants in their native i unjde. Many readers will recall an article by Everett T. Tomlinson on the  Great Public Schools of England,  Rugby, Eton, arrow, and others. Their traditions, methods of teaching, and social as- pects offer a marked con- trast to any other schools in the world. Public schools in the sense we use the words over here, they are not. They occupy more nearly the place of our great preparatory schools. These, too, have their traditions. Arthur Ruhl has written an article for the June number which he calls  Some American Prepar- atory Schools,  in which he gives a delightful im- pression of a number of famous American schools. Several of them are not without an airof venerable age.   When Andover was founded Washington s army was still at Valley Forge; when F.xeter was founded by Mr. Samuel Phillips s brother, John, Corn wallis hadnotyet sur- rendered.  These Ameri- can schools have their dif- ferences, but their ideals are much alike. They have their own pecul- iar atmosphere, and when a boy comes up to Yale or Harvard or Princeton he is very apt lo bear the imprint of his particular school and to I e recognized easily enough by his mates. There is one aspect of all of these schools that is charac - teristic of the country. While mainly supported by boys from well-to-do families, they are yet democratic in spirit, and poor boys who make their way by waiting on table or by the winning of a scholarship or other work may be found in 37 Cofyright, iQiO, by Charles Scribntr's Sons. Mt. Kcnia. From a photograph by J. A Men Lormg. 38 MAGAZINE NOTES some of them. Mr. Ruhl has succeeded in con- veying an impression of the real spirit of these schools and of their influence. One of the large and certainly interesting questions concerning our national growth is that of the development of the inland waterways. The matter has been the occasion for considera- ble discussion and in the minds of many, no doubt, at first glance, there seems every reason for the government s spending all the money necessary to carry out some of the large schemes talked of. Back of the whole thing, of course, is the idea that increased waterways would mean cheaper transportation, a reduction in freight charges on both water and rail. A great water- way from  the Great Lakes to the Gulf of M exico  has an alluring sound, and this is only a part of the proposed developments. Samuel O. Dunn, whose recent article on  The Great Railway Rate Battle in the West  gave such a clear analysis of existing conditions and the remedies therefor, writes in the June number on  The Proposed Development of In- land Waterways.  He brings to the subject the same careful study of conditions in this country and shows the relative uses and values of the waterways of Europe. The cost of these new enterprises would be immense and the result apparently, owing to the direction of the water- ways and the country through which they run, at le; St a doubtful benefit. It is an article worth a very careful reading.  It is easily imaginable that, in a country where changes in commercial and industrial conditions occur so rapidly as in this, the time might come within a comparatively few years when additional development of waterways would be justifiable and desirable. But the cri- terion of whether it is desirable at any particular time should be the extent of the use made of channels previously provided. The government having provided as good channels as can lie found elsewhere, nothing less than such utilization of them as justifies past expenditures can afford rational ground for inferring that their further improvement or the construction of new chan- nels will be justified by resulting public benefits.  Away up at the tip of Jutland there s a little Danish town where the sands are forever shifting, and where the sea and the wide reach of skies have left their impress on every one who lives or goes there. It is far away from the tourist ways, a place of fish and fishermen, with the menace of the sea never forgotten. Skagen has been made known to the world by a group of painters who have found in the life of the people, the shores, and the sea of this small fishing village subjects of peculiar significance anil interest. Kreyer and Michal Ancher have won fame by their work there, and Professor Truxen, the court painter in both Denmark and England, has built a house there. Many artists find their way thus far northward. The inn in the quaint little town is a favorite gathering place for visitors, with its walls covered with pictures. Miss Edith Rickert has written an ar- ticle about  Skagen, the Danish Painters  Vil lage in Jutland  for the June number. It will lie illustrated with reproductions of paintings by Krever, Ancher, Truxen, and others. Mrs. Wharton will be represented in the June number by another of her  Tales of Men     The Eyes.  It is one of her distinctly remark- able stories, in which she deals with the haunting presence of a pair of eyes with all of her fine skill and art in creating and sustaining an impression of the ghostly and unreal. That the value of the wide popularity of Mr. Roosevelt s articles has been fully appreciated by the business world is apparent in the very unusual demand for space in the advertising pages. Since the first article appeared, in the October number, the volume of advertising has exceeded that of any similar period. This is due to the in- stant and greatly increased demand for Mr. Roosevelt s articles and to the recognition of the fact that Scribner s has maintained, from the first, a standard that has placed it in a leading position and given it a world-wide reputation. V V In an article on Moliere and Louis XIV Pro- fessor Brander Matthews has some very interest- ing things to say about thecharacterand influence of the monarch who has been credited with being such a great patron and cultivator of the arts. He  juotes the well-known words of John Mor- lev:  The best title of Louis XIV to the recol- lection of posterity is the protection he extended to Moliere.  Moliere was both playwright and comedian to the court, and he was happy in being always able to produce the things that pleased. Professor Matthews s characterization of Louis   redits him with shrewdness and taste, but savs his dominant traits were pride and selfishness, a monstrous egotism. There are a number of in- teresting anecdotes about Moliere. Some recent color printing in the Magazine, notably the illustrations act ompanying Mrs. Ely s article on  The Color Arrangements of Flowers,  has attracted a very unusual degree of attention both in this country and abroad. Several of the English papers have referred to these pictures in very appreciative terms. One of them, re- ferring to the article, says it  is illustrated in the inimitable style of our American contemporary.

TO LAKE NAIVASHA. OM this camjj we turned lorth toward Lake Nai- asha. The Sotik country through vhich we had hunted was sorely stricken by drought. The grass was short and withered and most of the waterholes were drying up, while both the game and the flocks and herds of the nomad Masai gathered round the watercourses in which there were still occa- sional muddy pools, and grazed their neigh- borhood bare of pasturage. It was an un- ceasing pleasure to watch the ways of the game and to study their varying habits. Where there was a river from which to drink or where there were many pools, the different kinds of buck, and the zebra, showed comparatively little timidity about drinking, and came boldly down to the water s edge, sometimes in broad daylight, sometimes in darkness. Hut where the pools were few they never approached one without feeling panic dread of their great enemy the lion, who, they knew well, liked to lurk around their drinking places. At such a pool I once saw' a herd of zebras come to water at nightfall. They stood motionless some distance off; then they slowly approached, and twice on false alarms wheeled and fled at speed; at last the leaders ventured to the brink of the pool and at once the whole herd came jostling and crowding in behind them, the water gurgling down their thirsty throats; and immediately afterward off they went at a gallop, stopping to graze some hundreds of yards away. The ceaseless dread of the lion felt by all but the heaviest game is amply justified by his ravages among them. A lion will eat a zebra  beginning at the hind quarters, by the way, and sometimes having, and sometimes not having, pre- viously disembowelled the animal , or one of the bigger buck at least once a week  perhaps once every five days. The dozen iions we had killed would probably, if left alive, have accounted for seven or eight hundred buck, pig, and zebra within the next year. Our hunting was a net advan- tage to the harmless game. The zebras were the noisiest of the game. After them came the wildebeeste, which often uttered their queer grunt; sometimes a herd would stand and grunt at me for some minutes as 1 passed, a few hundred yards distant. The topi uttered only a kind of sneeze, and the hartebeeste a some- what similar sound.

The tom- my buck  carried good liorns; the horns o  the does were usually aborted, and were never more than lour or live inches long. The most notable feature about the tom- mies was the incessant switching of their tails, as il jerked by electricity. In the Sotik the topis all seemed to have calves of about the same age, as ii born from lour to six months earlier; the young of the oilier game were of every age. The males of all the antelope fought much among them- selves. I he gazelle bucks of both species would fate one another, their heads be- tween the forelegs and the horns level with the ground, and each would pun  h his op- ponent until the hair flew. W atching the game, one was struck by the intensity and the evanescence of their emotions. Civilized man now usually passes his lile under conditions which elim- inate the intensity of terror felt by his an- cestors when death by violence was their normal end, and threatened them during every hour of the day and night. It is , mlv in nightmares that the average dweller in S'6 civilized countries now undergoes the hid- eous horror which was the regular and frecjuent portion oi his ages-vanished fore- father', and whi  h i--  till an everyday inci- dent in the lives of most wild creatures. Bui the- dread is short-lived, and its horror vanishes with instantaneous rapidity. In these wilds the game dreaded the lion and tin- other flesh-eating beasts rather than man. We saw innumerable kills of all the buck, and of zebra, the neck being usually dislocated, and it being evident that none of the lion s victims, not even the truculent wildebeeste or huge eland, had been able to make any light against him. The game is ever on the alert against this greatest of foes, and every herd, almost every indi- vidual, is in imminent and deadly peril every few days or nights, and of course suffers in addition from countless false alarms. But no sooner is the danger over than the animals resume their feeding, or love making, or their lighting among them- selves. Two bucks will do battle the minute the herd has stopped running from the foe that has seized one of its number, and a I n  k resumes his love making with ardor, in the brief interval between the first African Game Trails and the second alarm, from hunter or lion. Zelira will make much noise when one of their number has been killed: but their fright has vanished when once they begin their barking calls Death by violence, death by cold, death by starvation these are the normal end The savage of to-day shows us what the fancied age of gold of our ancestors was really like; it was an age when hunger, cold, violence, and iron cruelty were the or- dinary accompaniments of life.

It was to me a perpetual source of won- derment to notice the difference in the be- havior of different individuals of the same species, and in the behavior of the same in- dividual at different times; as, for example, in the matter of wariness, of the times for going to water, of the times for resting, and, as regards dangerous game, in the matter of ferocity. Their very looks changed. At one moment the sun would turn the zebras of a mixed herd white, and the hartebeeste straw colored, so that the former could be seen much farther off than the latter; and again the conditions would be reversed when under the light the zebras would show up gray, and the hartebeeste as red as foxes. I had now'killed almost all the specimens of the common game that the Museum needed. However, we kept the skin or skeleton of whatever we shot for meat. Now and then, after a good stalk, 1 would get a boar with unusually line tusks, a big gazelle with unusually long and graceful horns, or a line old wildebeeste bull, its horns thick and battered, its knees bare and 5 S A Mack- hacked j,id A tree hyn A buck oft hltf ga clt  with unuvu ly fine he n shot at Salt marsh cam  A pcllcw. African Gaine Trails calloused from its habit of going down on them when lighting or threatening light. Our march was northward, a long day s journey to what was called a salt marsh. An hour or two after starting we had a characteristic experience with a rhino. It was a hull, with poor horns, standing in a plain whit h was dotted by a few straggling thorn trees and wild olives. The safari's course would have taken it to windward of the rhino, which then might have charged in sheer irritable bewilderment; so we turned off at right angles. The long line of porters passed him two hundred yards away, w hile we gun men stood between with our rifles ready; except Kermit, who was busy taking photos. The rhino saw us, but apparently indistinctly. He made little dashes to and fro, and finally stood looking at us, with his big ears coi ke  1 forward; but he did nothing more, and we left him stand- ing, plunged in meditation probably it would be more accurate to say, thinking of absolutely nothing, as if he had been a huge turtle. After leaving him we also passed by files of zebra and topi who gazed at us, intent and curious, within two hun- dred yards, until we had gone by and the danger was over; whereupon they fled in fright. The so-called salt marsh consisted of a dry watercourse, with here and there a deep muddy pool. The ground was impreg- nated with some saline substance, and the game licked it, as well as coming to water.   ur camp was near two reedy pools, in which there were big yellow-billed ducks, while queer brown heron, the hammer- head. had built big nests of sticks in the tall acacias. Bush cuckoos gurgled in the un- derbrush by night and day. Brilliant roll- ers flitted through the trees. There was much sweet bird music in the morning. 1 unnv little elephant shrews with long snouts, and pretty zebra mice, evidently of diurnal habit, scampered among the bushes or scuttled into their burrows. Tiny  lik diks. antelopes no bigger than hares, with swollen muzzles, and their little horns half hidden by tufts of hair, ran like rabbits through the grass; the females were at least as large as the males. Another seven- foot cobra was killed. There were brilliant masses of the red aloe flowers, and of yel- low-blossomed vines. Around the pools the ground was bare, and the game trails V wMte-T. i1ed A   orcuf mc. O'jl  African Game Trails toward the rhinos, well to leeward.

So after them we trudged over the brown plain. But they were uneasy, and kept trotting and walking.

The day after reaching this camp, Cun- inghame and I hunted on the plains. Be- fore noon we made out with our glasses two rhino lying down, a mile off. As usual with these sluggtMi i reatures we made our preparations in leisurely  t le. and with scant regard to the animal itself. More- over we did not intend to kill any rhino un- less its horns were out of the common. 1 first stalked and  hot a buck Roberts ga- zelle with a good head. Then we off sad- dled the horses and sat down to lunch under a huge thorn tree, which stood by itself, lonely and beautiful, and offered a shelter from the blazing sun. The game was grazing on every side: and I kept thinking of all the life of the wilderness, and of its many trage- dies, whii h the great tree must have witnessed during the centuries sini e it was a seedling.

A mile's rapid walk brought us within two hundred yards, and we dared not risk the effort for a closer approach lest they should break and run. The cow turned broadside to, and 1 hit her behind the shoulder; but 1 was not familiar with the heavy Holland ritle at that range, and my I  ullet went rather too low. 1 think the wound would eventu- ally have proved fatal; but both beasts went off at a gallop, the cow now and then turning from side to side in high dud- geon, trying to catch the wind of her foe. We mounted our horses, and after a couple of miles  canter overhauled our quarry. C u n i n g h a m e took me well to leeward, and ahead, of the rhinos, which never saw us: and then we walked to within a hundred yards, and I killed the cow. But we were now much puzzled by the young one, which refused to leave; we did not wi h to kill it, for it was big enough to shift for it- self; but it was also big enough to kill either of us. We drew back, hoping it would go away; but it did not. So when the gun bearers arrived we advanced and tried to frighten it; but this plan also failed. It threatened to charge, but could not quite make up its mind. Watching my chance 1 then creased its stern with a bullet from the little Springfield, and after some wild i ir- cular galloping it finally dec ided to leave. Kermit, about this time, killed a heavy boarfrom horseback after a three-miles run. The boar charged twice, causing the horse to buck and shy. Finally, just as he was going into his burrow backward, Kermit raced by and shot him, firing his rifle from the saddle after the manner of the old-time Western buffalo runners. We now rejoined Mearns and Loring on the banks of the Guaso Nyero. They had collected hundreds of birds and small mam- mals, among them several new species. We had already heard that a Mr. Williams, whom we had met at McMillan s ranch, M.i'.'ti man ami wife. 1 r -tn .   'hot  yi.11  h l y I AMcii had been rather badly mauled by a lion, which he had mortally wounded, but which managed to i harge home. Now we found that Ur. Mearns had been quite busily en- gaged in attending to cases of men who were hurt by lions. Loring nearly got in the category. He killed his lioness with a light automatic rille. utterly unfit for use against Afrit an game. Though he a  tually put a bullet right through the beast s heart, the shock from the blow was so slight that she was not stopped even for a second; he hit her four times in all. each shot being mortal for he was an excellent marksman,  and she died nearly at hi  feet, her   harge carrying her several yards by him. Mearns had galloped into a herd of wildebeest and killed the big bull of the herd, after first running dean through a mob of zebras, which. a  he passed, skinned their long yel- low teeth threateningly at him, but made no attempt actually to attack him.

He ran into a large party of lions, killed two, and wounded a lioness which escaped after mauling one of his gun bearers. The gun bearer rode into ramp, and tlie Doctor treated his wounds. Next day Mearns was summoned to a Masai kraal sixteen miles   iff to treat the wounds of two of the Masai; it appeared that a boilv of them had followed and killed the wounded lioness, but that two of tiuir number had been much mal- treated in the fight. One, especially, had been fearfully bitten, the lioness having pulled the flesh loose from the bones with her fixed teeth. The Doc tor attended to all three cases. The gun bearer recovered; both the Masai died, although the I  octordid all in his power for the two gallant fellows. Their deaths did not hinder the Masai from sending to him all kinds of cases in which men or boys had met with accidents. He attended to them all. and gained a high rep- utation with the tribe; when the case was serious the patient's kinsfolk would usually present him with a sheep or war-spear, or something else of value. He took a great fan  y to the Masai, as indeed all of us did. They are a fine, manlv set of savages, bold and independent in their bearing. They never eat vegetables, subsisting exclusively on milk, blood, and llesh; and are remark- ably hardv and enduring. Kermit found a cave which had recently been the abode of a partv of 'Ndorobo, the wild hunter-savages of the wilderness, w ho are more primitive in their ways of life than anv other tribes of this region. They live on honey and the llesh of the wild beasts they kill: they are naked, with few and rude arms and utensils; and, in short, carry on existence as our own ancestors did at a very early period of pakeolithic time. Around this t ave were manv bones. W ith- in it were beds of grass, and a small roofed ent Insure of thorn bushes for the dogs. Fire stii ks had I een left on the walls, to be ready when the    wners  wanderings again 11rought them bai k to the cave; and also cry curi- ous soup stii ks, each a rod with one of the vertebra of some animal stuck on the end, African Game Trails and designed for use in stirring their boiled meat. From our camp   n the  iuaso Xyero we trekked in a little over four days to a point on Lake Xaivasha where we intended to spend some time. The first two days were easy travelling, the porters not being pressed and there being plenty of time in the after noons to pitch camp comfortably; here the wagons left us with their loads fit" hides and horns and spare baggage. The third day we rose long before dawn, breakfasted, broke camp, and were   lf just at sunrise. There was no path; at one time we followed game trails, at another the trails made by the Masai  heep and cattle, and again we might make our own trail. We had two Masai guides, tireless runners, as grace ul Mr Roosevelt and Cuninghame discussing the next few days' inarch, over a wilde- beest  hot by Mr Roosevelt.

The scenery was wild and beautiful; in the open places the ground was starred with flowers of many colors; we rode under vine- tangled archways through forests of strange trees. Down the steep mountain side went the safari, and at its foot struck off nearly par- allel to the high ridge. On our left the tree- clad mountain side hung above us; ravines, with mimosas clustering in them, sundered the foot-hills, and wound until they joined to give any water for drinking. It was eight o clock before the last of the weary, thirsty burden-carriers stumbled through the black, bowlder-strewn ravine on whose farther side we were camped, and threw down his load among his fellows, who were already clustered around the little fires they had started in the tall grass. We slept as we were, and comfortably enough; indeed, there was no hardship for us white men, with our heavy overcoats, and our food and water which we shared with our personal attendants; but I was uneasy for the por- ters, as there was another long and exhaust- ing day s march ahead. Before sunrise we 526 African Game Trails started; and four hours later, in the bottom of a deep ravine, Cuninghame found a pool of green water in a scooped-out cavity in the rock. It was a pleasant sight to sec the thirsty porters drink. Then they sat down, built fires and boiled their food; and went on in good heart. Two or three times we crossed singularly beautiful ravines, the trail winding through narrow clefts that were almost tunnels, and along the brinks of sheer cliffs, while the green mat of trees and vines was span- gled with many colored flowers. Then we came to 1 larren ridges and bare, dusty plains; and at nightfall pitched camp near the shores of Lake Naivasha. It is a lovely sheet of water, surround- ed by hills and mountains, the shores broken by rocky prom- ontories, and in- dented by papy- rus-fringed bays. Xext morning we shifted camp four miles to a place on the farm, and near the house, of the Messrs. Attenborough, settlers on the shores of the lake, who treated us with the most generous courtesy and hos- pitality as, indeed, did all the settlers we met. They were two brothers; one had lived twenty years on the Pacific Coast, mining in the Sierras, and the other had just retired from the British navy, with the rank of com- mander; they were able to turn their hands to anything, and were just the men for work in a new country for a new country is a poor place for the weak and incompetent, whether of body or mind. They had a steam launch and a big heavy row-boat, and they most kindly and generously put both at our disposal for hippo hunting. At this camp I presented the porters with twenty-live sheep, as a recognition of their good conduct and hard work; whereupon Khino shut from Salt man h camp horn longer than fr  From a photograph they improvised long chants in my honor, and feasted royally. We spent one entire day with the row- boat in a series of lagoons near camp, which marked an inlet of the lake. We did not get any hippo, but it was a most interesting day. A broad belt of papyrus fringed the lagoons and jutted out between them. The straight green stalks with their feathery heads rose high and close, form- ing a mass so dense that it was practically im- penetrable save where the huge bulk of the hip- pos had made tunnels. In- deed, even for the hippos it was not readily penetrable.

A fringe of papyrus here and there adds much to the beauty of a lake, and also to the beauty of the river pools, where clumps of them grow under the shade of the vine- tangled tropical trees. I he open waters of the lagoons were covered with water-lilies, bearing purple or sometimes pink tlowers. Across the broad lily pads ran the curious  lily trot- ters,  or jacanas, richly colored birds, with toes so long and slender that the lily pads would support them without sinking. They were not shy, and their varied coloring a bright chestnut being the most conspicuous hue and singular habits made them very conspicuous. There was a wealth of bird life in the lagoons. Small gulls, somewhat  African Game Trails like our black-headed gull, but with their hoods gray, tlew screaming around us. Black and white kingfishers, liny red- billed kingfishers, with colors so brilliant that they flashed like jewels in the sun. and brilliant green bee-eaters with chestnut breasts perilled among the reeds. Spur- winged plover clamored as they circled over- head near the edges of the water. Little rails and red-legged water hens threaded the edges of the papyrus, and grebes dived in the open water. A giant heron, the Goliath, flew up at our approach; and there were many smaller herons and egrets, white or particolored. There were small, dark cormorants, and larger ones with white throats; and African ruddy ducks, and teal and big vellow-billed ducks, some- what like mallards. Among the many kinds of ducks was one which made a whistling noise with its wings as it flew. Most plentiful of all were the coots, much resembling our common bald-pate coot, but with a pair of horns or papilla; at the hinder end of the bare frontal space. There were a number of hippo in these lagoons. One afternoon after four o clock I saw two standing half out of water in a shallow, eating the water-lilies. They seemed to spend the fore part of the day sleeping or resting in the papyrus or near its edge; toward evening they splashed and waded among the water-lilies, tearing them up with their huge jaws; and during the night they came ashore to feed on the grass and land plants. In consequence those killed during the day, until the late after- noon, had their stomachs tilled, not with water plants, but with grasses which they must have obtained in their night journeys on dry land. At night I heard the bulls bellowing and roaring. They tight savagely among themselves, and where they are not molested, and the natives are timid, they not only do great damage to the gardens and crops, trampling them down and shov- elling basketfuls into their huge mouths, but also become dangerous to human be- ings. attacking boats or canoes in a spirit of wanton and ferocious mischief. At this place, a few weeks before our arrival, a young bull, badly scarred, and evidently having been mishandled by some bigger bull, came ashore in the daytime and act- ually attacked the cattle, and was promptly shot in consequence. They are astonish- ingly quick in their movements for such shapeless-looking, short-legged things. Of course they cannot swim in deep water with anything like the speed of the real swim- ming mammals, nor move on shore with the agility and speed of the true denizens of 'lowing in bull hippo, Lake Nnivasha From a photograph by J.

Or- dinarily only their heads can be seen, and they must be shot in the brain. If they are found in a pool with little cover, and if the L'uninghame coming ashore on boy's back, Lake Xaivash.t From a photograph by J.

But the brain is small and the skull huge, and if thev are any distance off, and especially if the shot has to be taken from an unsteady boat, there is ample oppor- tunity to miss. On the day we spent with the big row- boat in the lagoons both Kermit and I had shots; each of us hit. but neither of us got his game. My shot was at the head of a hippo facing me in a bay about a hundred yards off, so that I had to try to shoot very low be- tween the eves; the water was smooth, and I braced my legs well and fired offhand. I hit him, but was confident that I had missed the brain, for he lifted slightly, and then went under, nose last; and when a hippo is shot in the brain the head usually goes under nose first. An exasperating feature of hippo shooting is that, save in exceptional circumstances, where the water is very shallow, the animal sinks at once when killed outright, and does not float for one or two or three hours; so that one has to wait that length of time before finding out whether the game has or has not been bagged. On this occasion we never saw a sign of the animal after I fired, and as it seemed impossible that in that situation the hippo could get off unobserved, my companions thought I had killed him: I thought not, and un- fortunately my judgment proved to be correct. Another day, in the launch, I did much the same thing. Again the hippo was a long distance off, only his head appearing, but un- fortunately not in profile, much the best position for a shot; again 1 hit him: again he sank and, look as hard as we could, not a sign of him appeared, so that every one was sure he was dead; and again no body ever floated. But on this da f Kermit got his hippo. He hit it first in the head, merely a flesh wound; but the startled creature then rose high in the water and he shot it in the lungs. It now found difficulty in staying under, and continually rose to the surface with a plunge like a por- poise, going as fast as it could toward the papyrus. After it we went, full speed, for once in the papyrus we could not have fol- lowed it; and Kermit finally killed it. just before it reached the edge of the swamp, and, luckily, where the water was so shallow that we did not have to wait for it to float, but fastened a rope to two of its turtle like legs, and towed it back forthwith. taken close up, from firm Mr Kouscvclt'  big bull hippo From photoi;Taph     Kcruut ........   There were others in the lake.    ne day we saw two playing together near the shore: and at first we were all of us certain that it was some 1  ii  water snake. It was not until we were very clo.se that we made out the supposed one liisj snake to lie two others; it was rather interesting, as giving one of the explanations of the stories that always ap- pear about large water snakes, or similar monsters, existing in almost every lake of anv  i ,e in a wild i ountry.    11 another day I shot another near shore; he turned over and over, splashing and tumbling: but just as we were about to grasp him. he partially recovered and dived to safety in the reeds. On the second dav we went out in the launch I got my hippo. W e steamed down the lake, not far front the shore, for over ten miles, dragging the big. clumsy row-boat, in whit h C uninghame had put three of our porters who knew how to row. Then we spied a big hippo walking entirely out of water on the edge of the papyrus, at the farther end of a little bay whit h was tilled with water-lilies. Thither we steamed, and when a few rods from the bay, Cuning- hame, Kermit.and I got into the row-boat; Cuninghame steered, kermit carried his camera, and I steadied mvself in the bow with the little Springfield rifle. The hippo was a self-contident, truculent beast; it went under water once or twice, but again came out to the papyrus and waded along the edge, its bodv out of water. We headed toward it, and thrust the boat in among the water lilies, finding that the bay was shallow, from three to six feet deep. While  till over a hundred yards from the hippo, I saw it turn as if to break into the papyrus, and at once fired into its shoul- der, the tiny pointed bullet smashing the big bones. Round spun the great beast, plunged into the- water, and with in huge jaws open came straight for the boat, floun- dering and splashing through the thick- growing water-lilies. I think that it  c hief object was to get to deep water; but we were between it and the deep water, and in- stead of trying to pass to one side it charged straight for the boat, with open jaws, bent on mischief. But I hit it again and again with the little sharp-pointed bullet.   nce 53i African Game Trails I struck, it between neck and shoulder; once, as it rushed forward with its huge jaws stretched to their threatening utmost, 1 tired right between them, whereat it closed them with the clash of a sprung liear trap; and then, when under the punish- ment it swerved for a moment, I hit it at the base of the ear, a brain shot which dropped it in its tracks.

The water was so shallow where I had killed the hippo that its body projected slightly above the surlai e. It was the hardest kind of work getting it out from among the water-lilies: then we towed it to camp behind the launch. The engineer of the launch was an Ind- ian Moslem. The fireman and the steers- man were two half-naked and much-orna- mented Kikins. The fireman wore a blue bead chain on one ankle, a brass armlet on the opposite arm, a belt of short steel chains, a dingy blanket  no loin cloth , and a skull cap surmounted by a plume of os- ni'll, and how very good the eating would be. Usually one would improvise the chant, and the i  ther join in the chorus. Sometimes they would solemnly sing complimentary songs to one another, each in turn chanting the manifold good qualities of his companion. Around this camp were many birds. The most noteworthy was a handsome gray eagle owl, bigger than our great horned owl, to wliii h it is closely akin. It did not hoot or scream, its voice being a kind of grunt, followed in a second or two by a succession ot similar sounds, uttered more quickly and in a lower tone. These big owls frequently came round camp after dark, ami at tirst their notes completely  534 African Game Trails puzzled me, as I thought they must be made by some beast. The bulbuls sang well. Most of the birds were in no way like our home birds. Loring trapped quantities of mice and rats, and it was curious to see how many of them had acquired characters which Heller trapped various beasts; beauti- fully marked genets and a big white-tailed mongoose which was very savage. But his most remarkable catch was a leopard. He had set a steel trap, fastened to a loose thorn branch, for mongoose, civets, or jackals; it was a number two Blake, such as in Amer- Julian and marabou st . rk 1 rum .1 photograph by Kermit Kooserdt. caused them superficially to resemble Amer- ican animals with which they had no real kinship. The sand rats that burrowed in the dry plains were in shape, in color, eyes, tail, and paws strikingly like our pocket gophers, which have similar habits. So the long-tailed gerbilles, or gerbille like rats, resembled our kangaroo rats; and there was a blunt-nosed, stubbv-tailed little rat superficially hardlv to be told from our rice rat. But the most characteristii rodent, the big long-tailed, jumping springhaas, re- sembled nothing of ours; and there were tree rats and spiny mice. There were gray monkeys in the trees around camp, which the naturalists shot. ica we use for coons, skunks, foxes, and perhaps bobcats and coyotes. In the morn- ing he found it gone, and followed the trail of the thorn branch until it led into a dense thicket, from which issued an ominous growl. His native boy shouted  simba ; but it was a leopard, not a lion. He could not see into the thicket; so he sent back to camp for his rille, and when it came he climbed a tree and endeavored to catch a glimpse of the animal. He could see noth- in.' , however: and finally fired into the thicket rather at random. The answer was a furious growl, and the leopard charged out to the foot of the tree, much hampered by the big thorn branch. He put a bullet African Game Trails 535 into it, and back it went, onlv again to come out and to receive another bullet; and lie killed it. It was an old male, in good con- dition, weighing one hundred and twentv- six pounds. The trap was not big enough to contain his whole paw, and lie had been caught firmly bv one toe. The thorn bush acted as a drag, which prevented him from going far, and yet always yielded somewhat when he pulled. A bear thus caught would have chewed up the trap or else pulled his foot loose, even at the cost of sacrificing the toe; but the cats are more sensitive to pain. This leopard was smaller than any full- grown male cougar 1 have ever killed, and yet cougars often kill game rather heavier than leopards usually venture upon; yet very few cougars indeed would show any- thing like the pluck and ferocity shown bv this leopard, and characteristic of its kind. Kermit killed a waterbuck of a kind new to us, the sing-sing. He also killed two porcupines and two baboons. The porcu- pines arc terrestrial animals, living in bur- rows to which they keep during the day- time. They are much heavier than, and in all their ways totally different from, our sluggish tree porcupines. The baboons were numerous around this camp, living both among the rot ks and in the tree tops. They are hideous creatures. They ravage the crops and tear open new-born lambs to get at the milk inside them; and where the natives are timid and unable to harm them, they become wantonly savage and aggres- sive and attack and even kill women and children. In I'ganda,Cuninghamehadonce been asked by a native chief to come to his village and shoot the baboons, as they had just killed two women, badly bitten several children, and caused sui Ii a reign of terror that the village would be abandoned if they were not killed or intimidated. He him- self saw the torn and mutilated bodies of the dead women; and he stayed in the village a week, shooting so many baboons that the remainder were thoroughly cowed. Baboons and boars are the most formidable of all foes to the dogs that hunt them just as leopards are of all wild animals those most apt to prey on dogs. A baboon s teeth and hands are far more formidable weapons than those of anv dog, and only a very few wholly exceptional dogs of huge size, and great courage and intelligence, can single-handed contend with an old male. But we saw a settler whose three big ter- riers could themselves kill a full-grown Heller s leopard. From  t photograph by IZdmund Heller. African yew-tree , l-'ioin a photograph by Edmund Heller. warthog boar: an almost unheard-of feat. They backed one another up with equal courage and adroitness, their aim being for two to seize the hind legs; then the third, watc hing his chance, would get one foreleg, when the boar was'speedilv thrown, and when weakened, killed by bites in his stomach. Hitherto we had not obtained a bull hippo, and I made up my mind to devote myself to getting one, as otherwise the group for the Museum would be incom- plete. Save in exceptional cases I do not think hippo hunting, after the first one has been obtained, a very attractive sport, be- cause usually one has to wait an hour be- fore it is possible to tell whether or not a shot has been successful, and also because, a portion of the head being all that is usu- ally visible, it is exceedingly difficult to say whether the animal seen is a bull nr a cow. As the time allowed for a shot is very short, and any hesitation probably in- sures the animal s escape, this means that two or three hippo may be killed, quite un- avoidably, before the right specimen is se- cured. Still there may be interesting and 536 exciting incidents in a hippo hunt. Cun- inghame, the two Attenboroughs, and I started early in the launch, towing the big, clumsy row-boat, with as crew three of our porters who could row. We steamed down the lake some fifteen miles to a wide bav. indented by smaller bays, lagoons, and in- lets. all fringed by a broad belt of impene- trable papyrus, while the beautiful purple lilies, with their leathery-tough stems and broad surface-floating leaves, filled the shal- lows. At the mouth of the main bay we passed a floating island, a mass of papy- rus perhaps a hundred and fifty acres in extent, which had been broken off from the shore somewhere, and was floating over the lake as the winds happened to drive it. In an opening in the dense papyrus masses we left the launch moored, and   uninghame and I started in the row- boat t   coast the green wall of tall, thick- growing, leather-topped reeds. Under the bright sunshine the shallow tlats were alive with bird lile.  lulls, both thegrav-hooded and the black-backed, screamed" harshly overhead. I he chestnut-colored lily trot- African Game Trails 537 ters tripped daintily over the lily pads, and when they flew, held their long legs straight behind them, so that they looked as if they had tails like pheasants. Sacred ibis, white with naked black head and neck, stalked along the edge of the water, anil on the bent papyrus small cormorants and herons perched. Everywhere there were coots anti ducks, and crested grebes, big and little. Huge white pelicans floated on the water. Once we saw a string of flamin- goes fly by, their plumage a wonderful red. Immediately after leaving the launch we heard a hippo, hidden in the green fastness on our right, uttering a meditative solilo- quy, consisting of a succession of .squealing grunts. Then we turned a point, and in a little bay saw six or eight hippo, floating with their heads above water. There were two much bigger than the others, and Cun- inghame, while of course unable to be cer tain, thought these were probably males. The smaller ones, including a cow and her calf, were not much alarmed, and floated quietly, looking at us, as we cautiously paddled and drifted nearer; but the bigger ones dove and began to work their way past us toward deep water. We could trace their course by the twisting of the lily pads. Motionless the rowers lay on their oars; the line of moving lily pads showed that one of the big hippo was about to pass the boat; suddenly the waters opened close at hand and a monstrous head appeared.  Shoot,  said Cuninghame; and I fired into the back of the head just as it disappeared. It sank out of sight without a splash, almost with- out a ripple, the lily pads ceased twisting; a few bubbles of air rose to the surface; evidently the hippo lay dead underneath. Poling to the spot, we at once felt the huge body with our oar blades. But, alas, when the launch came round, and wre raised the body, it proved to be that of a big cow. So I left Cuninghame to cut off the head for the Museum, and started off by myself in the boat with twro rowers, neither of whom spoke a word of English. For an hour we saw only the teeming bird life. Then, in a broad, shallow lagoon, we made out a dozen hippo, two or three very big. Cautiously we approached them, and when seventy yards off I fired at the base of the ear of one of the largest. Down went every head, and utter calm succeeded. I had marked the spot where the one at Vol. XLVII. 56 which I shot had disappeared, and thither we rowed. When we reached the place, I told one of the rowers to thrust a pole down and see if he could touch the dead body. He thrust according, and at once shouted that he had found the hippo; in another moment his face altered, and he shouted much more loudly that the hippo wras alive. Sure enough, bump went the hippo against the bottom of the boat, the jar causing us all to sit suddenly down for we were standing. Another bump showed that we had again been struck; and the shallow, muddy wrater boiled, as the huge beasts, above and below the surface, scattered every which way. Their eyes starting, the two rowers began to back water out of the dangerous neighborhood, while I shot at an animal whose head appeared to my left, as it made off with frantic haste; for I took it for granted that the hippo at which I had first fired  and which was really dead  had escaped. This one disappeared as usual, and I had not the slightest idea whether or not I had killed it. 1 had small opportu- nity to ponder the subject, for twenty feet away the water bubbled and a huge head shot out facing me, the jaws wide open. There was no time to guess at its intentions, and I fired on the instant. Down went the head, and I felt the boat quiver as the hippo passed underneath. Just here the lily pads w-ere thick; so I marked its course, fired as it rose, and dow-n it went. But on the other quarter of the boat a beast, evidently of great size it proved to be a big bull  now appeared, well above water; and I put a bullet into its brain. I did not wish to shoot again unless I had to, and stood motionless, with the little Springfield at the ready. A head burst up twenty yards off, with a lily pad plastered over one eye, giving the hippo an absurd resemblance to a discomfited prize-fighter, and then disappeared with great agitation. Two half-grown beasts stupid from fright appeared, and stayed up for a minute or two at a time, not knowing what to do. Other heads popped up, getting farther and farther away. By degrees everything van- ished, the water grew calm, and we rowed over to the papyrus, moored ourselves by catching hold of a couple of stems, and awaited events. Within an hour four dead hippos appeared: a very big bull and three big cowrs. Of course, I would not have African Game Trails shot the latter if it could have been avoided: I iut under the circumstances I do not see how it was possible to help it. The meat was not wasted: on the contrary it was a god- send. not only to our own porters, but to the natives round about, manv of whom were on short commons on account of the drought. Bringing over the launch we worked un- til after dark to get the bull out of the diffi- cult position in which he lav. It was nearly seven o clock before we had him fixed for towing on one quarter, the row boat towing on I lie other, bv which lime two hippos were snorting and blowing within a few yards of us, their curiosity much excited as to what was going on. The night was overcast: there were drenching rain squalls, and a rather heavy sea was running, and 1 did not get back to camp until after three. Next day the launch fetched in the rest of the hippo meat. From this camp we went into Xaivasha, On the line of the railway. In many places the road was beautiful, leading among the huge yellow trunks of giant thorn trees, the ground rising sheer on our left as we cantered along the edge of the lake. We passed impalla, tommies, zebra, and wart- hog: and in one place saw three watcrbui k cows feeding just outside the papyrus .it high noon. They belonged to a herd that lived in the papyrus and fed on the grassy llals outside: and their feeding in the open exactly at noon was another proof of the fact that the custom of feeding in the earlv morning and late evening is with tin  st game entirely artificial and the result of fear of man. Birds abounded. Parties of the dark-colored ant-eating wheatear sang sweetly from trees and bushes, and even from the roofs of the settlers  houses. The tri-colored starlings black, white, and chestnut sang in the air. as well as when perched on twigs. Stopping at the govern ment farm  which is most interesting: the results obtained in improving the native sheep, goals, and cattle by the use of ini - ported thoroughbred hulls and rams have been astonishingly successful  we saw the little long-tailed, red-billed, black and white why dabs flitting around the out-buildings as familiarly as sparrows. Water birds of all kinds thronged the meadows bordering the papyrus, and swam and waded among the water-lilies; sac red ibis, herons, beauti- ful white spoonbills, darters, cormorants, Fgvptian geese, ducks, coots, and water hens. I got up within rille range of a  lock of the queer ibis stork, black and while liirds with curved yellow bills, naked red faces, and wonderful purple tints on the edges and the insides of the wings; with the little Springfield I shot one on the ground and another on the wing, after the  lock had risen. That night Kermit and Dr. Mearns went out with lanterns and shot-guns, and each killed one of the springhaas, the jump- ing hares, which abounded in the neigh- borhood. These big, burrowing animals, which progress bv jumping like kangaroos, are strictly nocturnal, and their eyes shine in the glare of the lanterns. Next day I took the l ox gun, which had already on ducks, guinea fowl, and t'ran- colin, shown itself an exceptionally hard- hitting anil dose-shooting weapon, and col- lectcd various water birds for the natural- ists; among others, a couple of Egyptian geese. I also shot a white pelican with the Springfield rille; there was a beautiful rosy Hush on the breast. Here we again got news of the outside world. While on safari the only news paper which any of us ever saw was the  heego J"nnc , which Loring, in a fine spirit of neighborhood loyalty, always had sent to him in his mail. To the Doctor, bv the way, I had become knit in a bond of close intellectual sympathy ever since a chance allusion to  William Henry s Letters toHis Grandmother  had disclosed the fact that each of us, ever since the davsof his youth, had preserved the bound volumes of   Our Young Folks,  and moreover firmly be- lieved that there never had been its equal as a magazine, whether for old or young; even though the riaiu us of our golden consul- ship was the not wholly happy Andrew Johnson. TIIH INCREASED COST OF LIVING By J. Laurence Laughlin i HI' price of any article is a statement of its relation to some standard like gold. Therefore, prices may vary for causes affecting either gold or the articles com- pared with gold. The whole price problem has thus two distinct sides:  i  a study of the influences directly touching the demand and supply of gold itself, and  2  the influ- ences directly touching the demand and supply of goods, and their expenses of pro- duction. It would be one-sided and inade- quate to reason that prices have risen solely from the new supply of gold, without taking into account the new demand for gold; and it would be still more inadequate to reason solely from influences affecting gold, and disregard the many potent influences work- ing directly on the conditions under which goods are produced and marketed. It will be our purpose, then, to study the causes af- fecting the recent rise in prices, by first pre- senting the forces working directly on gold, and by later unfolding the forces operating on the goods themselves. When Orpheus was leading Eurydice back to earth, although forbidden he looked back at her, and she was lost to him forever. In order to shield the taritf, politicians and men high in office have already determined to assign the cause of our high prices to the abundance of gold. If, however, they dare to look back to the period from 1873 to iSqo, they will find their favorite theory ruthlessly snatched away from them. In- exorable logic and the facts are against them, as well as against those theorists who have not studied all of the case. To get light on our problem, let us contrast the period of 1875-1890 with the later period of 1890-1908, the facts of which in regard to prices and the production of gold are pre- sented in Diagram I. Before doing so, attention should be called to the fact that some writers carelessly reason directly from the recent large annual production of gold to the recent contem- I orary rise of   trices. This is an oh 1 fallacy. The new supply should be compared with the total stock of gold in existence. The total available stock is not as it is, for in- stance, in the case of wheat the annual supply, but the total product in all past years, less the amount lost by accident, abrasion, or destruction in the arts. Ow- ing to its durability the total stock is con- stantly increasing, and as we approach the present time the annual production, even though large, bears a constantly smaller ratio to the total supply. Then, to change the value of the whole stock, the new supply must be large not absolutely, but in re- lation to the total world's supply. A great rainfall in France may disastrously raise the level of the Seine; but it will not percep- tibly raise the level of the Atlantic Ocean. It takes a long time, moreover, for an in- creasing supply of gold to make its influ- ence felt on the value of the total stock. It may be months after heavy rains in Abyssinia before the water rises in the lower Nile in Egypt. That is, changes in prices due to changes in the value of the total stock of gold in the world, under the influence of new production, must neces- sarily be slow and gradual. Serious and rapid changes of prices, therefore, must be due to other causes than gold that is, to causes directly affecting the commodities themselves. Keeping this point in mind, we may now proceed to contrast the two periods.  1  To 1850, the total production of gold was S,v 158,000.000, from which we should deduct for destruction in the arts and in other ways enough to reduce the total sup- ply to not more than $2,500,000,000. In the years 1851-1875 the supply of gold was more than doubled; but the demands for it 5,i9 540 The Increased Cost of Living also increased. Yet it is probable that the new gold, being very large relatively to the total stock, may have helped in the rise of prices to 1873. But, if to the total stock of $5,674,000,000 in 1875  $2,500.000,000  $3,174.000,000  be added the new prod- uct from 1876 to 1895, or $2,467,000,000, it will be seen from Diagram 1 that this ad- dition of 43 per cent, to the total supply was attended by steadily falling prices. Gold prices fell from 138.28 in 1873  in Soet- beer s table  to 108.13  n 1890; or from 122.0 in 1873  in the Aldrich table for the United States  to 92.3 in 1890; or, if we make comparison with the prices of 1895, the fall was still greater. In this period, when the new production was greater rela- tively to the total stock than in recent years, we heard nothing about the great new sup- ply, Imt everything about the great new demand for gold. In this period a new production greater than that of to-day rela- tively to the total stock has been attended by a prolonged fall of prices. It is obvious, then, that other things than the supply of gold have a dominating influence on the prices of goods.  2  In the later period, 1890-1908, we have also had a great new production of gold. In the ten years 1895-1905 it was $2,899,000,000. But the total stock in 1895  assuming a stock of $2,500,000,000 in 1850 and no losses whatever since 1850  was within $8,141,000,000. Thus the new gold in this period was 35 per cent, of the existing stock; while in 1876-1895 it was 43 per cent. Yet in this later period prices rose from 112.9 in 1890, or from 93.6 in 1895, to 115.9 in 1905, or to 122.8 in 1908  in the Bureau of Labor tables . With a greater relative supply of gold in the earlier than in the later period, we had falling prices in the former, and rising prices in the latter. In this later period we hear every- thing about the new supply, but nothing about the new demands  so much empha- sized before . To reason from the abun- dance of gold in recent years directly to the rise of prices is unscientific and one-sided: it tails to take into account the new de- DIAGRAM I The Increased Cost of Living 541 mands for gold as well as die factors in the problem touching the goods themselves independently of gold. In these days of increasing wealth and great extravagance the consumption of gold in the arts, for decoration, and for jewelry, is no less than when Soetbeer estimated it at S6o,000,000 or more annually. Although this figure is only a guess, we may use it as a rough means of computing the world s consumption of gold in the arts for 1895  1905 at about $600,000,000. Moreover, in the years 1805-1907, according to the re- ports of our Mint,  about 8700.000,000 of silver have been displaced in the currencies of the world and supplanted I y gold. That is, just as in the earlier period, 187,3  1890, so in the later one, about in proportion to the new supply of gold various coun- tries found it possible to change or to im- prove their monetary systems by taking on gold. Besides Japan, there are most of the South American countries, the developing populations of Africa, and especially silver- producing Mexico that have adopted the gold standard. From all the available data at hand, it seems probable that the new pro- duction of gold since 1895 has not been much more than enough to equal the new demands in the arts and in the currencies of the world. If so, the forces working on gold alone have probably equalized each other, and its value for causes affecting itself -cannot be said to have been materi- ally changed. In odier words, the recent rise of prices cannot be accounted for by causes originating with gold. These, moreover, are not the only objec- tions to ascribing the rise of prices to the abundance of new gold. No doubt many persons have been led to assign the chief role to gold under the impression that the rise of prices lias been general throughout the world, that all commodities have been affected, and that this must have been due to a single universal cause like gold. First, let us look at the facts in England. Strangely enough, two inadequate tables of English prices have been recently quoted as if they were decisive the main reason being that, though deficient, they were ac- cessible to date. The index numbers of the London Economist  for only 22 series  show a figure of 2,236 in 1890, of 2,136 in   Report "f the Director of the Mint, 1896, pp. 46 7: iqcH. pp. IS-y. 1905, and of 2,197 'n T9 9- On this show- ing there has been no rise at all. In Sauer- beck s table  chiefly extractive products  the index number for 1890 and 1891 was 72, for 1905, 72, and for T908 only 73. And yet Sauerbeck's figures have been quoted by high officials in Washington as evidence that gold has fallen in value. Obviously these facts do not prove that the rise of prices has been general in all countries. Even in the United States the rise in wholesale prices is not as great as is gen- erally supposed. Bradstrcct's index num- ber for January 1, 1892, is 8.1382; for January r, 1905, 8.0S27; and for January 1, 1909, 8.2631. The table of the United States Bureau of Labor  Bulletin 81  shows a number for 1890 of 112.9; for 1905 of 115.9; and for 1908 of 122.8. That is, an average rise of 9 per cent, between 1890 and 1908 for 203 articles. But neither has the rise of prices been uniform a point used to prove a single common cause like gold. The Bureau of Labor uses as a base number of 100 the average prices of the years 1890-1899 with which the prices of other years are com- pared. A study of these tables discloses the remarkable fact that out of 203 com- modities, 36 actually fell in price by 1908, and 2 remained unchanged. These 36 were: hops, sugar  granulated , mutton  dressed , soda crackers, apples  evapo- rated  , pepper, prunes  California , tea  Formosa , mackerel, Rio coffee, soda  bi- carbonate , covert cloth, ginghams, sheet- ings, chinchilla overcoatings, candles, matches, lead-pipe, shovels, nails  wire , wood screws, silver, puttv, quinine, alcohol  wood , white granite cups and saucers, nappies  glass , tumblers  glass , carving knives, knives and forks, manila rope, ma- nila wrapping paper, and wood paper for newspapers. Then, too, while the average rise of all the 203 commodities from 1890 to 1908 was only 9 per cent., there was no uniformity of movement in the various groups within the whole list. For instance, farm products rose from 110.o to 133.1; fuel and lighting from 104.7 to 130.8; while drugs and chem- icals show little or no rise at all. More- over, there arc wide variations in the prices of the same goods within any one year, which show how important other causes than gold must be; for these great changes The Increased Cost of Living cannot possibly be assigned to gold. A few instances of changes of wholesale prices entirely within the vear 1908 will suffice: Cattle . . Fresh lieef Ili.les . . Milk . . Butter . . Bacon . Hams . Lard . Mutton Cotton Calico . Cotton flannels   inghams . Print cloths . 110.5- 117.0- 100.7 88.2- 102.5- 106.4- 07- 115.4 87.5- 11S.7- 00.6- icu.6- 00. 1 142.0 142..; 1 70..S 1 56.Q 141.8 161.2 l. i.S 1 50.0 1 50.0 150.4 1 ;.;-7 128.0 115-3 14 5   Those who believe that the rise of prices is due to an abundance of new gold find a difficulty in showing by what direct eco- nomic processes the new gold affects prices. Theoretically, it is assumed that the in- creased gold must be offered against goods and thus declines in value. Such a theory, however, is too detached from the facts to receive credence, quite apart from the fact that, in the United States, even though gold is our standard of prices, we practically do not use gold as a medium of exchange. With the better thinkers, however, it is urged that the new gold flows into the bank reserves, makes possible larger loans, in- creases the credit offered against goods, and consequently raises general prices. Now, let us appeal to banking practice. Be- cause there is more gold in the world, do banks in the United States expand their loans  Certainly not. First a bank de- cides whether the loan is safe or not; then, if the loan is made, and a credit in a deposit account is given, the bank may need more reserves. An increasing number of those who have goods, in warehouse or in transit, may wish loans. Speaking generally, the more goods produced and exchanged, the more loans arc wanted. Then, first having the demand for legitimate loans, the bank as a consequence arranges to supply the re- serves required by law or experience. In banking common-sense, the increase of loans is the cause of increased reserves; it is not the presence of gold in the country which is the cause of increased loans. If increased loans are wanted, the ease in get- ting gold makes the process easier: but, no matter how plentiful gold may be, if the bank has not the means to offer for the cold. how can it increase its reserves  No matter how abundant gold is, a bank can meet the demand for increased loans only by the capital or deposits in its possession. Is it not an absurd theory that an abundance of new gold would allow a bank of $100,000 capital to lend indefinitely, say, to $100,000,- 000  A large bank carries a large sum of loans, not because gold is abundant, but be- cause its funds are large; it uses out of its large funds only that sum which is neces- sary to get the gold or money reserves which experience shows are necessary for its discounting business. To say that the presence of abundant gold is the cause of increased loans is to put the cart before the horse. It would be like saying that the cause of the excavation of dirt in the Panama Canal was the existence of steam shovels. The shovels make the excavation easier, but the cause is the hundreds of millions of dollars voted by the United States. The banks lend capital, nut money; and cash reserves are only a tool, or a part of the banking machinery necessary in banking operations. Indeed millions of loans may be made and repaid by checks without the use of a cent of money. And, no matter how abundant gold is, a bank supplies not a dollar more of inert, non-earning reserves than is necessary for carrying the sum of loans consistent with its present resources. It may be said, however, that if much new gold has gone into the currencies of the world in the past ten years, that is precisely the way by which it can be offered against goods, and thus increase prices. But in prci isely the same way one might say that the new crops of the United States, new wealth created in one season from the soil to the amount of  6.000,000,000, is new' purchasing power to its owners, as well as the new gold; that it is offered for other goods, and ought to raise prices. But, more than this, if the new' gold has in- creased prices by entering the currencies of the w orld, how does it happen that prices have risen most in the United States in which gold, although the standard of prices, is almost never used in the actual purchase of goods  It will certainly be startling to those who have declared themselves with- out going into the facts to discover as shown in Diagram 1 that, although the stock of gold has been quadrupled since 1850  being in 1905 about $11,000,000,000 , The Increased Cost of Living prices in gold on the average are no higher in 1908 than they were in i860, and less than they were in 1850. Ill On the other hand, no one in this coun- try doubts that there has been a rise of prices greatly increasing the cost of living. In proceeding to the second general division of our field, it will be found that the causes of this upward movement are to be found in the forces affecting not the value of gold, but the expenses of producing and distributing the goods themselves. That is, if the gold standard in which the prices are expressed has not varied much for causes affecting itself, the prices of goods may have varied greatly for causes directly affecting the value of goods relatively to gold. It is as if a mountain peak had not changed its elevation above the sea; yet men may have gone up or down its side and thus have changed their position relatively to the top. If, then, we can explain these forces which have been increasing the expenses of living, the reader can see for himself whether they are permanent or not, and whether they are capable of control or abolition. The moment we pass from considerations touching gold, or the standard of prices, to those touching the expenses of production, or the demand and supply of goods, we find at once a large group of commodities which have risen in price for reasons which can in no possible sense be ascribed to the cheap- ened gold. Farm and food products have changed in price for obvious causes pecul- iar to these articles themselves. Moreover, it is in connection with these products  especially meat that we have heard most in the recent discussion about the high cost of living. Averages of many commodities have little practical significance to the mass of people. The social importance in changes of prices resides in those which affect the articles entering into the budgets of the plain people. When food rises in price it is serious; but when furs and silks rise it is not serious. First, what are the facts as to the rise of prices  Taking the basis of 1896-1900 as 100, according to the Secretary of Agricult- ure, the 14 farm products  hay, cotton, hogs, flaxseed, cattle, barley, wheat, rye, corn, hides, oats, etc.  have risen most. As 543 compared with an average of 126.4 for all the groups combined, the farm products have risen in 1908 to 141.9, as compared with 128.7 f r f   d products  47 articles ; 132.8 for lumber; 121.9 for clothing; 125.3 for fuel and lighting; 124.9 f r metals; 119.5 for house furnishings; and 106 for drugs. But averages of wholesale prices for groups of articles have very little interest for the housekeeper. Food products as a group have risen to 128.7 'n 1908; but how as to specific articles  Taking 1896-1900 as a base of too, the following table will show how much such articles of every-day consumption have risen:   Milk  N. Y.  .........129.8 Kggs............205.1 Creamery butter........151.7 Factory chcesc.........145-3 Mackerel...........108.2 Codfish...........153.1 Beans............t6.V4 Peas............146.8 Potatoes...........152.2 Apples............190.8 Wool  Ohio ..........137-.  Hides  native .........l  7-9 Burley tobacco.........177-5 Here is an increase of from 30 to 100 per cent, in articles of food; while other groups, such as clothing and house furnishings, have risen some 20 per cent. Such being the facts, what are the causes of the increase in the prices of farm and food products  As regards those articles con- sumed in every family, rich or poor such as milk, eggs, butter, cheese, beans, peas, potatoes, apples, and the like the answer is not far to seek. In the main it is an in- crease of demand out of proportion to the available supply. The movement of popu- lation from the farm to the city has been going on for decades, as every one knows. The less enterprising, the less active, the less educated have been left on the farms; the bad roads, the remoteness of farm- houses, have made social life less attractive in the country. The great prizes of success in the professions and in industry, the eager, busy life of the towns and the cities, the glamour and lure of the varied excitements in the town, and the desire to escape phys ical exertion and hardship, have drawn the   Report of the Secretary of Agriculture, No. qi, iqoq, p. 26. The Increased Cost of Living youth away from the land, and made agri- cultural labor scarce and inefficient. The labor-economy of agricultural machinery cannot fill the gap; for the operations of agriculture are not continuous and uniform, as in the factory. Therefore, the actual practices of dairy-farming, crop-growing, and treatment of the soil have deteriorated, with the loss of brains and labor only to be checked  but not yet by any means reversed  by the splendid teaching of ex- periment stations and the Department of Agriculture. To-day, much of our land does not begin to yield what it is capable of. Our methods are bad and wasteful and the supply of food for the urban demand is not coming forward in the proportion of the new demand. Moreover, in the older States farm land has enormously increased in value. The farmers who have accumulated a compe- tence and retired to the towns, for instance in Illinois, have not grown rich primarily by the sale of their crops, but chiefly by the rising value of the land. The farmer who now buys land at $80 to $150 an acre, and who pays wages high enough to draw labor away from the city, must get higher prices for his products than in the past, in order to cover his higher expenses of production. Including the greater cost of the land, the higher prices of labor, the phenomenal rise in the prices of lumber and building materials, it is but natural that the ex- penses of producing foodstuffs should have gone up, and should stay up permanently, unless there is to be a great national reaction in favor of country life. From this time on we must expect to see the effects of an in- creasing pressure on the land. Dry farm- ing and irrigation are taking up lands hitherto unoccupied; but, in truth, our only real recourse is in improved methods of cultivating the land now under tillage. How much, in particular, has meat risen   Unfed beef at the farm is not much higher than it was nine to fourteen years ago. The price of beef, however, is affected by four processes before it gets to the con- sumer:  1  feeding;  2  slaughtering;  3  wholesaling; and  4  retailing. As against 100 in 1896-1900, steers at Chicago have risen in 1909 to 126-136; dressed carcasses to 123.7-129.7; retail prices of roasts to 132.3; and of steaks to 133.7. That is, beef has risen by about one-third of its price as compared with the average of 1896- 1900. Hogs have risen in price at the farm in about the proportional rise in price of other things. Hogs have risen to 147.3  n 1909; wholesale carcasses to 180.5; the re- tail prices of fresh pork to about 142  1907 ; and bacon to about 164  1907 . But how as to live-stock  Live-stock and farm crops have shown a special in- crease in price, at the farm, as follows:  100  average of 1896-1900.

J86.9 There is      not much     difficulty in finding the special causes of the high prices of beef. The free range has disappeared; govern- ment lands can no longer be fenced by cattle rangers; the old ranges have been taken up and cultivated as farms; and the future supply of cattle must come from the stock produced in connection with general farming. The old sources of supply of cattle can no longer be counted on. More- over, in 1906 there was a rush to market cattle, and a general decrease in the exist- ing supply in that year is still felt. In ad- dition, the doubling of the price of corn and oats, the high prices of alfalfa and hay, have very greatly raised the cost of feeding cattle before they are sent to slaughter. To-day, the price of fed cattle is the highest on record. If so, the wholesale and retail prices must rise in proportion. The recent somewhat hysterical boycott of meat cannot change the underlying cause of the high prices of farm products, including meat. By refraining from eating high-priced meats a consumer can lower his expenses, but not the general level of meat prices. It is pos- sible, however, for him to buy cheaper cuts, and learn how to prepare nutritious food by more skilful cooking. In the choice of our The Increased Cost of Living 54.3 dietary there is certainly a wide margin for saving without loss or even with a gain  in nutriment. IV One universal element in the expense of producing goods of any kind, manufactur- ing or agricultural, is the wages of labor. In the United States money wages per hour, expressed in gold, have risen between 1890 and 1907 by about 28 per ccnt. These facts may be seen in the following table: Year     Wages per  Year   Wages per hour              hour 1890 . . . . IC0.3  1899 . . . 102.0 1891 . . . . 100.3  1900 .     105.5 1S92 . . . .

ICO. 2 1907 . . . 128.8 Nor is the higher range of wages confined to the United States; it is that part of an in- creased expense of produc tion which is un- doubtedly common to many countries, and which, by making the phenomena of higher prices widespread, probably gives occasion for the belief that the higher prices, being world-wide, must be due to some one gen- eral cause like gold. But it certainly is true in other lands that there is little com- plaint of higher prices where wages have not risen. In England, for instance, cost of living has not increased as much as with us even as regards dairy products and meat. But English wages are much less than ours, as a few examples will show:   United States Bricklayers . Carpenters . Plumbers . Plasterers . England and Walts per 48 hours week . SQ.12-S9.85 . 8.80- 9.57 . 8.60- 9.67 . 8.88-10.14 $28.80-833.60 14.40- 28.80 19.20- 28.8c 24.OO- 33.6c Certainly, cost of living also in France has not yet risen as much as it has with us. Since 1905 wages have risen about 5  per cent., or about the same as food. It is important to remember, also, that a rise of wages once made is not easy to reduce; and that it is likely to remain as a permanent cause of higher prices in the future. More- over, in so far as the rise of wages is general, it will work for a general rise of prices.   Computed from data in Bureau of Labor Bulletin, 77. V Another cause of the higher cost of liv- ing one which is especially operative in the United States and the Continental coun- tries of Europe is the increasing rates of customs tariffs, and of taxation due to mili- tarism. It is impossible to attribute the generally higher prices due to the heavy load of taxation laid upon the consumer to a general cause like the cheapening of gold. In the United States the enormous sums spent by our national government on harbors and rivers, on pensions, on the army, and especially on the new navy, must be paid for by somebody; and that somebody is the consumer of the taxed goods. On an average imported dutiable goods are increased in price to the American consumer by over 40 per cent. But, to the extent that importations are impeded, not all of this tax of over 40 per cent, goes to the government, but much of it goes to the protected interests. The duties are so high as not to be revenue duties, and our treasury gets only about 8300,000,000 of this tax, or less than half of its annual expenditure. The truth is just coming home to the mass of people that our extremely high protective duties have raised the expenses of produc- ing many goods, raised prices, and raised the cost of living to every family through- out the length and breadth of the land. This is one reason why industrial activity to-day spells  hard times  for the unor- ganized consumer. Some of our public men are not dealing fairly with the people when they direct at- tention solely to the Payne-Aldrich Act of 1909, and assert that it has in some respects lowered duties. Suppose that it had done so, as compared with the Dinglev Act of 1897. Then, that only transfers the cause of offending to the duties fixed by the Ding- Icy Act, which were, on the whole, the highest in our list of high-tariff enactments. It is no comfort to a drowning man in forty feet of water to be told that just back of him the water was forty-one feet dee  . It is no comfort to the consumer submerged by im- port duties of forty, or a hundred, or several hundred per cent., to be told that a micro- scope will discover a fractional change of a per cent, here and there when in fact ho- siery, gloves, and clothing bear increased duties. It is not ingenuous to harp on the The Increased Cost of Living insignificant changes in the act of 1909, when the real burden was made heavy in 1897, and only continued in 1909. It is not fair, of course, to charge the in- crease in the prices of all goods to the tariff. The most pernicious and the most direct effect of our high protective tariff is to be found in the duties upon raw materials, where the taxes on materials unduly raise the prices of finished goods. For instance, if foreign wools  required in various mix- tures of clothing fabrics  be taxed 40 per cent., then, if the woollen manufacturers were to receive an additional protection of 40 per cent, on their finished goods, it would lie 40 per cent, on an outlay increased by the tax on their materials. Thus by com- plicated compensatory duties, the consumer pays Oo or 80 per cent, more, in cases where he should pay on woollen goods only 40 per cent., provided raw materials were free. An illustration of the heavy burden thus laid upon all of us by the tariff may be found in the case of wool and woollen goods. W ool was made free in the W ilson Act of 1S94; and taking the average prices of 1890-189S as too, the comparison be- tween the prices of wool and woollen goods in 1896, before the Dingley Act, and 190S may be seen in the following table: PRICES, 1S96-IQ0S        1890-98   100 Articli s                         iSi        oS Wool.....                       . 70. 1  IIS..S Blankets  wool  .

In order to show the actual rise of prices fairly chargeable to the protection of the extremely high tariffs since 1897, besides wool and woollens, a few other articles have been added to this table, especially under the cotton schedules  where the increase cannot be charged to the duty on raw' cotton . An increase of 25 to 35 per cent, is not infrequent. And in the metals schedule  where we also have our own raw materials  the rise is also affected by the duties on the fin- ished goods. The unprejudiced student will certainly be struck by the precipitous climb of prices of articles affected by the tariff after the passage of the Dingley Act in 1S97, as shown in Diagram II. These lines dis- close the movement of wholesale prices from 1890-1908, by groups of commodities. Of course, the changes in individual articles are still more striking, since their extremes are not hidden in the general group aver- age. For my personal enlightenment I have had over a hundred of these prices charted, and their connection with the act of 1897 is often unmistakable. This more detailed presentation of prices from 1890 to 1908 in Diagram II should be studied in connection with the movement of the average of prices from 1850 to 1890, in Diagram I. It may be said that as far back as 1898 no one grumbled about the high cost of living, since we had as high a tariff then as now; hence, it may be said, the present high prices could not be ascribed to the tariff. The true comparison, however, should be made between the period from 1S04-1897, and the period from 1897 to the present. The former was a time of low prices, aggra- vated to be sure by the panic of 1893 ; while the latter was a period of rapidly rising prices throughout. The panic of 1893, however, was due ultimately to over-ex- pansion, and immediately to the fear of a silver standard; but not at all to the absurd reason sometimes set forth that it was t aused by the W ilson Act, or the fear of its passage an act passed after the panic, in 1894. Moreover, although it is said that the act of 1909 made inconsiderable changes in duties, it is very significant that, in antici- pation of, and following, the act of August, 1909, Bradstrcet's index number should The Increased Cost of Living .347 have shown such a marked upward tend- ency, as follows: January I, 1909 February 1 March 1 .

In exam- ining the forces affecting the market price to the consumer, it is obvious to every one that the seller is constantly trying to get "all that the traffic will bear.  The buyers are a loose, unorganized mass, while the producers and sellers are better organized than we realize, but more than mere com- pact organization if the producers and sellers can continue to control the supply of the article, and create even a quasi- monopoly, then the unorganized consumers arc at their mercy. Here we have a cause DIAGRAM II J.V.IU 1.VJ1 1893 1S93 1894 1SSKV 1IWS 1897 I   8 ISSI'J l'JOO 1901 1MB 11KB 11J04 111 15 HHKi 1807 11H 8 United States; and the tendency to higher protective duties in Europe, and the phe- nomenally heavy taxes required by military and naval establishments, all help to explain whatever there may be of a general cause behind the movement of prices to a higher level in all countries. The extravagance of States and municipalities in public works, the waste of city funds in official corruption in our land, is all being paid for by the individual consumer; and in many cases it appears in a higher expense of produc- tion, and consequently in a higher level of prices. which can directly raise the prices of goods whose expenses of production have not been increased. That is, combinations, which are the characteristic industrial phenomena of to-day, can raise prices by a greater or less control of the market. And in cutting off competition from foreign countries the protective tariffs materially assist the com- binations in controlling the home market, to the serious disadvantage of the con- sumer. In the discussion of protectionism, it has been argued that tariffs do not raise the prices of protected goods to the home con- The Increased Cost of Living sumer, tiecause competition between the home producers will always prevent more than ordinary gains, and keep prices at a normal level. But when combinations succeed in controlling the price this is no longer true. Thus, the maintenance of monopoly prices becomes possible to the full extent of protecting duties, provided imports are prev ented from competing with the monopolized products at home. An illustration in point appears in the duty on wood pulp and paper, which has allowed the combination to control the price of printing paper to the American newspapers. And there are many similar cases. The influence of the tariffs and of com- binations in recent years is closely con- nected. The passage of the Dingley Act in 1897 'vas followed directly by the remark- able creation of combinations, beginning in 1S9S-1900 such as those in tin-plate, wire, steel, copper, and a long list of others. Tariffs and combinations affecting raw materials have a pervasive and sinuous influence upon the prices of related and finished goods. Combinations, or under- standings, to control the supply price of coal, tar, hides, zinc, lead, copper, and other metals; tin-plate, turpentine, cotton, dyes  and a great number of other commodi- ties used in further manufacture tend to increase the expenses of production of a wide range of articles. In some cases, of course, the larger the scale of production, the cheaper each unit of product can be marketed; but the economics are some- times offset by the higher cost of raw materials, the higher range of wages, and other items entering into expenses of pro- duction. As every one knows, combination is the order of the day, and it has affected nearly every article of general consumption, among which may be mentioned anthracite coal, turpentine, jute, augers, axes, planes, files, hammers, door-knobs, mortise-locks, chisels, building materials, linseed oil, furniture, tobacco, wire nails, petroleum, cottonseed oil, lard, tallow, codfish, her- ring, crac kers, glucose, barbed wire, mo- lasses, salt, and pig-iron. The rise in the prices of these articles after the Dingley Act of 1897, and during the period of the great- est activity in the formation of trusts, is certainly very significant. VII Finally, we must remember that the above conclusions have been based on an examination of wholesale prices. Yet the family buys at retail; and the forces bear- ing on the level of retail prices have in effect much to do with the actual cost of living. If the truth must be told, there are no re- liable retail prices. They vary with the buyer s social position, the quarter of the citv, the season, very often with the under- w   1 standings and agreements between the wholesale and retail dealers, and those be- tween the retail dealers themselves. In fact, the strongest hold the so-called trusts have upon prices is to be found in the agreements with the retailers to sell at a fixed price. Even the evolution of the cold- storage warehouses like the use of certifi- cates for wheat in elevators has come to allow of speculation, agreements, and the control of the supply of eggs, poultry, fish, apples, and the like. There can be little doubt that the retail organization by which goods go from the wholesaler to the consumer is unnecessarily wasteful and expensive. There are twenty butcher-shops and groceries in every neigh- borhood where only one is needed. Each must spend much in advertising, in show- windows, in rents, in costly fixtures, in tele- phones, in wages, in horses and delivery wagons, which are not essential to the total result. Five or six wagons, with salaried drivers, distribute trilling quantities of goods to houses in the same street. The consumer pays for this waste in the margin of retail over wholesale prices. From 1890 to 1908, on an average, wholesale prices have increased 9 per cent., while retail prices have increased 18 per cent. The difference between wholesale and retail prices, in particular cases, varies from 10-25 per cent, to 100-150 per cent. If one stops to analyze the process of re- tail buying, it will be realized that it is the seller only who practically sets the price. There is no true retail market price. Busy or ignorant people pay what is charged them without the patience or the power to select. In these days we pay for the addi- tional costs of dainty and attractive pack- ages for cereals, crackers, figs, and the like. Indeed, under the cover of special tins, an amount of an article is sold at a price which The Increased Cost of Living .',40 makes a pound cost two or three times as much as formerly. The psychology of the retail market is itself a study of no mean in- terest. Habit, fancy, caprice, rumor, emu- lation, gregarious action of a set, may play a part. Once a man gets established with a clientele, he puts up his prices. He charges all he can get; and the confiding customer goes on paying the bills until there rises a general cry of high cost of living, like that of the present day. There are different retail prices for each half-mile as one passes from the centre of a city to its outskirts. Yet some persons think it demeaning to bargain or seek for lower prices. To spend reck- lessly is an evidence of what some regard as belonging to social position. VIII In the margin of the retail over the whole- sale price, in a community not well shaken down into form, there is an opportunity for serious changes in the cost of living. Out of this margin, the catalogue houses, the wholesale grocery houses, the tea and coffee houses, have accumulated great fortunes  at the expense of the helpless consumer. Then, what is the remedy  Obviously, the creation in every neighborhood of co- operative societies for the distribution of goods directly from the producer to the con- sumer at actual cost obviating the waste of advertising, high rents, and useless dupli- cation of service. It calls for social organ- ization: a thing, of course, which is always slow of development because the Almighty made every man an individualist, who wishes each thing done to suit his individual tastes, and at the time and place to suit his pleasure. If co-operation succeeds, how- ever, it will remove the wide margin of differential gains, which, lying above the actual expenses of production, afford an opportunity for combination and for manip- ulation to control prices. It may be said that the manufacturers and producers will refuse to sell to the co-operative societies under threats from the present large body of retailers; but in the long run producers will arise wherever there is a sustained de- mand. And the success of distributive co- operation in England, where the societies buy largely from outside producers, is one of the reasons for the lower expenses of living in England than in America apart from the fact that good, warm woollen clothing is there no more than one-half what it is here. IX In conclusion, we may summarize our results. The great recent production of gold great as it is is not as large in pro- portion to the total stock in 1895, as was the new gold from 1875-1895 to the total stock in 1875. Yet in the earlier period there were falling prices, and in the later rising prices. It is said, of course, that new gold increased bank reserves, made pos- sible enlarged credits, and so worked for higher prices; but this influence must have been as active in the earlier as in the later period. Therefore, even if we should ad- mit that the llood of new gold has finally begun to lift somewhat the level of prices, it could not be the cause of the changes which have to-day so thoroughly aroused public attention. The rise of prices now most discussed, such as those of farm and food products, is due to special causes, and not to gold. Part of the sudden rise of prices since 1896 is obviously due to the reaction from a time of depression; but the period since 1897 is one in which business organization has in the main taken on new form, and in which prices have been under powerful control. Moreover, special causes, such as high tariffs, agricultural readjustment, higher wages, and increas- ing expenditures of the rich have operated to raise prices. The resultant seems to be the outcome of special forces on the goods side of the price-ratio working to raise the prices of goods, more than inventions and progress in the arts have been able to de- press them. In this respect the later differs from the earlier period. Lastly, it must be admitted that, aside from the higher prices of many staple articles, our standard of living has changed with the growing wealth of the country. Each family now wishes more expensive food, better clothes, more costly millinery, more pictures and books and those of a higher price, more bicycles and automobiles, more horseback riding, more travelling, stays at higher-priced hotels, passage on more expensive steamers, than formerly  all to keep up in the procession with the successful rich, who are increasing enormously in numbers. Every one ex- 550 The Anachronism pects, as a matter of course, to buy fruits anti vegetables out of season such as a very short time ago were considered within the reach of only the largest purses. Our kitchen economy is quite too wasteful; we throw away fats and buy lard to take their place. May it not be the psycho- logical hour to call for the creation of a new aristocracy of the simple life, of those who care for the realitv and not for the shadow, for the true inward pleasures of the mind rather than for the external, evanescent show  May it not be high time to create a free-masonry of those who do not ask how much one has, nor how much one knows, but what one is  Gold, in the sense of riches, may be the root of all evil: but gold, in the sense of a standard of prices, cannot be the sole root of the evil in our increased cost of living. THE ANACHRONISM By Donal Hamilton Haines Illustrations by George Wrigut ONEY, second lieutenant the Tenth Cavalry, sat oss-legged at the feet of s patient horse, while a ittle passed over his head cijnost unnoticed. Hisnaked sabre lay across the knees of his olive-green uniform, and a blade of grass moved back and forth between his firm teeth. Now and then he cast glances of approval at the troopers and horses scattered behind him  six companies of the Tenth, dismounted and idle in a wide glade which sheltered them as completely from the sweep of the hostile fire as though theyhad beenadozen milesawav. A corporal, scarcely younger or less griz- zled than Maloney, caught the lieutenant s eye and read its expression with accuracy.   Kind o  slow, ain t it   he inquired with a cheerful grin. Maloney nodded several times vigorously, and the corporal, thus emboldened, crept closer, keeping hold of his horse s bridle.  An  I suppose we ll have to lay here all day, too,  he continued.   I suppose st ,  agreed Maloney, to whom speech came slowly. The corporal looked at Maloney keenly. He knew his story like every other man in B company, for Maloney had become a fix- ture, an institution, a personality, so thor- oughly at one with the thought of second lieutenants that the terms had grown to be almost synonymous. It was known in B company that Maloney had come from West Point just in time to witness the last thin edge of Indian-fighting, that he was probably the best second lieutenant in the cavalry but that he would never be anything else. He had witnessed whole batches of younger officers sent above him, and if the situation rankled him, he never showed it.  Maloney s way behind the times   his superiors were wont to say of him, but they were equally ready to admit that he could handle a company better than most captains, and even colonels were very readyin answering Maloney s careful salute.  Well, anyhow,  persisted the corporal with obvious intent,   this is better n guard- in  wagon-trains.   I don t know that it is,  returned the lieutenant slowly.  There s a chance for action with the commissariat; there doesn t seem to be any here.   Oh, well,  argued the corporal,  what can ye do with cavalry in a country that s set on end   Maloney glanced at the sheer, bare hill that rose in front of them, and then at the legs of his horse.   I ve sent Billyup worse things than that, and you ve followed me, Hogan,  he said.   1 know, I know,  admitted Hogan readily, a glint of pride in his eyes,  but them days are gone. They couldn t shoot three miles then, an  we didn t have a fight- in  front twenty-five miles long.  Maloney gave no sign of having heard. He chewed almost savagely on the blade of The Anachronism grass, and the tanned hand which grasped the worn hilt of the sabre tightened until the cords stood out sharply. Hogan watched him and kept silence; he knew Maloney s hobby, and knew that he would ride it in time.   You re right, corporal,  he said finally.  They don t win battles with charges any more; they win them with higher mathe- matics. When I put on straps for the first time, we had an army of infantry, cavalry, and artillery. Now we have one of infan- try and artillery, with a few mounted men who make a good appearance on parade. That s all we re good for, Hogan.  A shell, fired at high angle by the enemv, dropped a hundred yards to the rear of the horsemen and exploded with a roar. Hogan and the lieutenant cast disapproving glances toward it, and turned away their heads.  It's been so long,  Maloney went on,  since there was any use for cavalry, that there aren t many field officers would know what to do with us. The colleges are teach- ing that good infantry is worth more than any sort of cavalry, and there you are.    Maloney, you ought not to be preaching your heresies to your men,  said a voice be- hind them. Hogan and Maloney scrambled to their feet and saluted, Maloney rather red but unabashed. Colonel Hunt regarded them critically.  Can t you let Hogan be modem   he asked.   Why, no, sir, not if he starts me talk- ing,  confessed Maloney. Hunt laughed with much good nature, for lie knew the worth of the two before him.  I m going up this hill,  he said,  and work a little farther forward to try and make out just what s going on on the other side. You come with me, Maloney, and I'll teach you why we re lying here idle.  Maloney saluted and walked away be- hind the tall, lank figure of the colonel. Above their heads as they walked droned an occasional bullet, while now and then a puff of smoke, high in the air above the crest of a hill, or farther away on somedistant slope, marked the bursting of a shell. In their ears, so deadened now to it that their hear- ing of it was almost subconscious, was the roar of a great battle a steady thunder of gun-fire which had pulsed for hours. Silently they trudged up the slope, dotted here and there with small clumps of bushes, but for the most part clear and covered only with sere, brown grass. With a smile, Hunt noticed that Maloney carried the naked sabre in his hand.   If you were a staff officer, Maloney,  he panted as they neared the crest,   I wouldn t have to explain anything. You d know what is going on.    I do,  answered Maloney shortly.  Well, then,  continued Hunt,  you'll have a chance to see how it looks.  Above them they could see three guns, carefully screened from sight by brush, and snugly set down in gun-pits, around which the artillerymen were busy. Twenty-five feet in front of the guns, whose shells ripped through the air a few feet above their heads, a supporting company of infantry lay in the bottom of a curving trench, as perfect in construction as a railroad embankment. Hunt turned aside slightly, and led the way to a point twenty feet or so above the level of the battery. Behind the crest, daring the chances of battle in its exposed position, was a little cluster of men about one of the poles from which were strung the wires of the field telephone. Hunt threw himself onto the ground and pulled out his binocu- lars. Maloney followed suit.  Now,  said Hunt,  look your fill   Maloney looked off across an endless se- ries of hills, some larger, some smaller than that on which he lay, their many-shaped peaks rising in ever ' direction, outlined against the background of a chain of moun- tains, misty along the horizon. In front of him was a treeless valley, and yet in the scant cover beneath, his glass picked out the men of half a dozen infantry companies, and other companies showed against the brown of the treeless slope beyond. On a far-off crest, fully four miles distant, he saw the shells from the battery at his side bursting, and soon made out the puffs of smoke which marked the position of the hostile guns. Of moving troops he could see almost nothing; of the enemy nothing at all save the hazy puffs of smoke which marked the far-off batter ' positions.  Well,  said the colonel,  where would you take your cavalry, lieutenant   Maloney turned a stiff, unconvinced countenance toward his superior.  I d find a place to use them,  he said stubbornly. The Anachronism   You re loyal to the horse,  said Hunt, not displeased with Maloney s stubbornness. The remark was enough to give Maloney his tongue.  Colonel,  he asked,  can I help it  It s thirty years now since 1 went into the army and not a day of those thirty years that I haven't put leg over a saddle. That old gray of mine down there is fifteen years old; and he s the son of a horse that pulled me out of many a tight place. I ve fought on horseback until I d be helpless as a babe on foot. 1 know that doesn t look like cavalry ground  and he swept his hand over the barren, seemingly unpeopled land- scape-  but I m too old to learn the new ways. Yes, sir, I d find use for them.  Behind them they could hear the voice of one of the men at the field telephone, eon- versing with a staff officer half a dozen miles to the right, and then relaying his informa- tion toward a hill a dozen miles in the other direction, where head-quarters lay.  I know how you feel,  admitted Hunt.   It was hard for me to make way for the new order. I love the cavalry as much as you do; I'd give a good deal to be able to lead the Tenth, boot to boot, against any- thing in the world but that s all past and gone, Maloney. Why, look   He swept his hand about the horizon.   Here are two armies, three hundred thousand men altogether, scattered over thirty miles of territory. We ve been beat- en once, and now they re hammering at us again, both wings and the centre. And yet you can t see it from here; you wouldn t dream there was such an engagement but for the noise. Where would you drop half a dozen companies of horse in such a wilder- ness   Again Maloney shook his head and an- swered, without taking his eye from his binoculars:   I d find a place.  Hunt shook his head in despair. A staff officer came up from the telephone and dropped onto the ground at Hunt s side. Maloney listened and watt hed them with interest.  I wish something would happen," the staff officer confessed.   They ve been ham- mering away at us now for eight hours, and we ve hammered back, and nothing s hap- pened. Why don t they develop their attack and be done with it   Hunt shrugged his shoulders.  They re not pressing us here,  he said.   That one battery keeps hammering away, and there seem to be infantry moving for- ward in front of it, but they come slowly.   The main attack,  said the staff officer s superior knowledge,  is coming  way off to the left. They ve been pushing up troops and guns in that direction all the morning.  Both paused and studied the throbbing, roaring pulse of battle. A company of in- fantry, plodding with long steps under the weight of full equipment, deployed behind the crest and moved down the slope.   There s something queer about this lull in front of us,  said the staff officer with a note of nervousness in his voice,  we can t have checked them here it hasn t been hot enough.  Both officers swung their field-glasses across the hill-tops in silence. A perspiring officer from the battery climbed the slope to their side and levelled his own glass.   Those chaps over there seem to be quit- ting,  he said, pointing toward the slope on which the distant guns had been thumping.   We must have been  linking  em pretty steady      I can t get used to it,  Hunt admitted to the staff officer,   this knowing things are going on all right and not being able to see them.  There was a buzz of excitement around the field telephone behind them. The little group turned around. The battery had al- most entirely ceased firing, the gunners standing easily by their pieces, the officers using their glasses. Steady driblets of in- fantry poured through gaps in the ridges, and wriggled their way down into the next valley. A tall man, wearing shiny riding-boots in- stead   if the usual   m ttecs, suddenly a      eared near the telephone. The group parted, sa- luting. Maloney watched this new-comer, his practised eye quickly noting the stars on the shoulder-straps. An instant later the group seemed to fly apart, and the general came striding up the slope; a diminutive staff officer almost trotted at his side.  They wouldn t dare do it it s not safe,  he expostulated breathlessly.   Dare, sir " sniffed the general,   that's just what they have done.  He glared back over his shoulder at an aide who had turned from the telephone. The Anachronism 553  Well   lit- demanded,  what did you find out     Some of the enemy s troops have made their appearance on the extreme left,  the aide reported, saluting.  Sounds of artil- lery tiring have been heard well toward the rear of General Warren's position.  Maloney was on his feet in an instant, his lips open to speak, the hare blade swinging from his w rist, but discipline held him, and he looked at Hunt.   There are six companies of the Tenth in the dip behind this ridge, General,  Hunt said quietly. " Kind     slow, ain't it   he inquired with a cheerful grill. Page 550 The general slapped his leg with his gauntlets.   Gentlemen,  he said to the group about him,   this inactivity before us is explained. The enemy has deliberately thrown a wing into the air. left his flank unprotected, and already is threatening our own extreme flank. The thing has been done before our very eyes.  The group stared at him in open-mouthed astonishment.   I would give all my batteries,  said the general fiercely,  for a few regiments of cavalry    Vol. XI.YII. 57 The general wheeled and stared at him fixedly.  It's sheer madness,  he said, more to himself than to Hunt. "This isn t 1850.  Hunt was silent, but Maloney broke over the bounds of discipline. He strode for- ward, stopped at the regulation distance, and saluted. The general eyed his sturdy figure and grizzled face in surprise.  Well " he demanded.  It isn't 1850, General,  Maloney said hoarselv,  and it isn t scientific, but we can do it  ' 554 The Anachronism The group stared at him in astonishment, too surprised to silence him.   For God s sake let us go, sir,  Maloney went on, tumbling the words out in his eagerness.  'There s six hundred horses down there that would make nothing of these hills, and six hundred men that haven t seen real service since the war began. Aren't we good for something besides convoying baggage trains     That will do, Maloney,  snapped Hunt, and Maloney fell back, his face red. The general gnawed his mustache. Suddenly he turned to Hunt, his eye hav- ing caught something of Maloney s fire.   Colonel Hunt,  he said in cool, even tones,  you will take your six companies of cavalry, pass through the gap and into the main Thornville road. You will proceed as far along that road as you deem neces- sary to take you well into the enemy s lines, then wheel to the left and parallel the line of the enemy s front, attacking any bodies of troops you may encounter." For an instant Hunt looked at him almost uncomprehendingly, then there sprang to his cheeks an answering flush, he saluted and went down the hill with Maloney at his heels. The general sat down on the ground and lighted a cigar. His staff and the artil- lery officers looked at him as one demented.   When those cavalryare out of sight,  he snapped to the aide,  you needn t bother with that instrument. I don't want to hear about it   In the hollow behind the ridge there rang out the sudden clamor of cavalry trumpets, and the clatter of mounting men.  Maloney,  said Hunt, as the lieutenant started for his own company,  you ride at my side   Around the base of the ridge on which the general sat puffing at his cigar like a wild man, six companies of cavalry moved at the trot. A company of blacks, two of sorrels, and three of bays, and at their head, a horse s length behind his colonel, rode Second Lieutenant Maloney, his drawn sabre gripped in his hand, his hat off, and the wind snapping through his whitening hair.   Gentlemen,  said the general gravely,  there rides a splendid anachronism   Past plodding columns of infantry, past sweating batteries, streamed the cavalry. Gunners halted with the shells half raised to the smoking breeches of their guns, looked, and then stopped to shout. Infan- try moved to one side, and yelled themselves hoarse as the roaring column went past. Straight into the broad road, for whose pos- session a month s campaigning had been spent, went the drumming hoofs. A few bullets commenced to whistle overhead.  It s true,  Hunt yelled back to the white-haired man behind him,  they ve jerked an army out from in front of us, and thrown it at our tlank   Maloney nodded grimly, and looked back once at the big horses behind him. Then he smiled. From a ridge far off to the right, a bat- tery began reaching for this long, flying col- umn with shrapnel, and the wicked charges commenced humming and screaming over the tops of the trees. A little knot of infan- try, clad in the bluish fatigue uniforms of the enemy, halted in the road before them, fired a few harmless shots, and melted into the underbrush. A moment later a whole com- pany commenced deploying before them. With hardly a pause, the first company   f the flying column uncoiled into a long line. The fire of magazine rifles spit at them, but they rode through. On the other side of the wreck of the infantry, Hunt caught sight of Maloney,still riding adozen lengths in front of the foremost trooper. The old man was sitting his horse like a rock, and the bright blade of his sabre was red. A belated battery of the enemy s artillery, trotting securely along under cover of a wooded road, tried frantically to wheel into position, only to be ridden down by two companies of the cavalry without firing a shot. Through the tangled mass of men and guns, the six companies streamed without pause. Hunt raised himself in the stirrups at the end of the long line, waving his sahre, and the orderly bugler at his side blew him- self black in the face. The six companies wheeled to the left and left the road. From hill-tops far back in the heart of the enemy s lines heliographs commenced to flicker, and strange tidings clicked over the wires of the field telegraph. The six com- panies had ridden eight miles, and their path could be traced byotherthan theirowndead. For an hour the general sat silent on the top of his crest, watching without interest the progress of the long-range fight before him, then he whirled on his aide. Drawn by George Wright. Maloney sabred the gunner who had struck Hunt down  Page 556. 556 The Anachronism  Heat those wires red-hot,  lie shouted,  until you find out if anybody's seen any- thing of a wild, white-haired Irishman and what s left of six companies of horse      ne of the enemy's batteries, far from the ridge on which the tall general was lighting his third i igar, had been planted in the  hel- ter of a corn-field.    nto its unprotected flank, brushing aside a fringe of riflemen like a morning mist, swept a mad, wild-eyed crowd of hatless. howling cavalry. The batten- crumpled up, but one of the gunners found time and chance to send his short sword through the tunic of a talloffu er rid ing at the head of the cloud of troopers. Maloney sabred the gunner who had struck Hunt down, and looked back for the lieutenant-colonel. There was not an offi- cer in sight, and Maloney's long-delayed promotions fell upon his shoulders at once.  Come on, boys.  he yelled, whirling about in his saddle.  We re going dean through and out the other side   There came a check in the enemy s brill- iant flanking movement For three hours the great, five-mile gap in the centre of his lines had gone unnoticed, and his daring flanking niameuvre had progressed with oily smoothness. But now, strangely per- sistent rumors of something gone wrongin the great hole shot from tip to tip of the great host. A thin wedge had been thrust through the opening, and the army paused, even though the greater part of it had not felt the shock. I he general stood over the aide, watch- ing him like a cat. The youth s ear was fast to the receiver of the instrument, and he waved the impatient general aside with un- conscious temerity.

"We re bombarding the air   the gen- eral chuckled to an officer at lii  side,   but it makes no difference. We ll break  em in three pieces   Maloney put his gasping horse over a hedge and looked behind him as he landed. The remnants of six companies were scat tered across the landscape in a whirling crowd, black, brown, and sorrel horses mingled together. But he could see officers driving the flying mass into lines. He had no conception of how far he had ridden, how many men had fallen, or how many lines of scared, madlv tiring infantry he had passed through. His empty revolver he had thrown away, and the empty cartridge- pouch flapped noisily at his side. Three inches of his sabre was missing; he had broken the blade when a savage slash missed a gunner's head and struck the shin- ing barrel of a three-inch field-gun. He pushed his staggering horse through a corn-field, and rode out into the very muzzles of a field battery. Back of them he could see long lines of infantry, wheeled about in- to line to meet the charge of the cavalry.   It s the end,  he panted, " but what an end, my God, what an end   He heard the crash of the troopers behind him as the horses thundered into the com, and then the batten- before him swept the charging horsemen with shrapnel. Ma- loney felt the horse stagger, and something weighing a thousand pounds struck him in the shoulder. Once more, however, he whirled about in his saddle, and his hoarse,   racked voice roared out: " Come on, boys,there sa few of em left    The general mounted hishorseand looked toward the west, where the setting sun glinted on the white ribbon of the Thornville road.

Dimly he resented the act. He was perfectly comfortable as he was: there was no feeling in the leg anyway.   Don t,  he muttered thickly.  Let me alone.

T. H. Halsey WARD GREF.XE MAL- iONE. America s greatest winter of portraits on ivorv, ras born at Newport, R. 1., ti August, 1777, anti died at Javannah,  ia., May 7,1S07. Malbone was peculiarly fortunate in liv- ing his short professional life at the very inception of the nineteenth century. The country had fullv recovered from the disas- trous effects of the W ar of the Revolution. The adoption of the constitution, and the subsidence of the mutual jealousies long existing between the separate colonies had developed a strong national spirit and an enthusiasm for things American, with its encouragement for native craftsmen sadlv lacking to-dav. Pride in past achieve- ments walked hand in hand with the stern realization of the duty of building for the future. A desire for education and the finer things of life was springing up. The patronage given to home manufacturers was extended to those working in science, literature, and art; an encouragement which made possible the achievements notably of Eulton in science, of Cooper, Irving, Paul- ding, and later Poe and Hawthorne in litera- ture, ami Stuart, Morse, Vanderlvn, and others in art. Social conditions in the earlv history of the colonies tended in no way to the build- ing up of a school of American painting. The intensity of the struggle for existence, the simplicity of life anti thought attendant thereto, anti the absence of sentiment left little place in the social structure for the en- joyment of things merely beautiful in them- selves anti purely decorative in conception. Evidence, however, that the artistic sense was here existent in a highlv developed -tate along useful lines i  demonstrated by a study of the splendid work of our numerous native born silversmiths, early communion vessels, beakers and tankards, heautitul in design and workmanship, and reminders of the days when no business transaction was consummated, marriage ceremony performed, or funeral service held without a copious pouring of liquor. Malbone anti His Miniatures The attitude of the Puritan mind toward portrait painting as a profession was     m- cisely expressed in the following extract from the  Records of the Selectmen of the Town of Boston   under date of August 25, 1701, wherein it is stated that  Lawrence Mrown, a Limner, asks udmittant e to l ean inhabitant of this Towne wli 1 is granted    n condition that he gives Security t   Save the Town harmless.  As the eighteenth century progressed the magnificent trade which the colonies had developed with the West Indies and Span- ish America brought wealth, and with it a gradual increase in the luxury of living. Certain foreign painters, notably Smibert, were al  le to eke out a meagre existence in vagrant portrait paint- ing. Their austere and painfully labored por- traits, however, cannot be accepted as satisfac- tory representations of the mentality of the men who were laying the foundations of our re- public. The second half of the century brought Copley, native born and almost self-taught. In his early portraits we find the beginnings of the school in which the distinctly American type of face and char- acter are delineated as by one possessing a thorough understanding of the character of American men and women. Much of his portraiture is accessoried by a wealth of color and gorgeousness of surroundings sug- gestive of the colonial aristocracy among whom Copley lived and worked. The spirit of political unrest and the hardships of the War of the Revolution effectually stilled the budding interest in things aesthetic, and it was not until the re- turn of Gilbert Stuart in 1702 that art in America obtained its needed stimulus. The carefully drawn canvasesof Peale and Trum- bull must be accepted as interesting records of the personages living at the beginning of the new nation, rather than as works of men whose art was highly developed. Malbone s ancestry was thoroughly American. His great grandfather, Peter Malbone, was born February 10, 1667, and died at Norfolk, Va., May 26, 17 ;S, in the vicinity of whit h his son   iodlrey was bom January 18. i6q;. Godfrey Malbone, as was the case with his distinguished grand- son, matured early in life and settled in .Newport, R. I., where, in 1718, in the deed in whit h he took title to a piece of land on Thames Street for his "Mansion House,  he is styled   'apt. Godfrey Malbone, Mariner.  He was one of New England s princely merchant navigators, and earlv acquired a fortune in the then eminently respei table trade of im- porting rum from the W est Indies and slaves from Africa, and later turned many an honest and patriotic dollar in fitting out his ships to act as privateersmen dur- ing the wars with France. His house on Mianto- nomoh Hill was notable among the finest dwell- ings in the colonies forits sumptuous furnishings and lavish use of ma- hogany in its door and circular stairway leading dimen- sions were sixty-four by fifty-two feet, and it was topped bv a double pit  hed roof with dor- mer window s and surrounded by elaborate gardens. In 17iq Godfrey Malbone married Cath- arine Scott, by whom he had ten children, the eighth of whom, John, born August 21, 1735, was the father of Edward Greene Malbone, the subject of this sketch. For a proper understanding of the dis- advantages under which Malbone labored and eventually won hi- position in society and in the art world, it must be stated that he was an illegitimate son, and in earlv life bore the name of Edward Greene, given him by his mother. The live children of the alliance, however, were legitimatized and allowed to take the name of Malbone by Act of Legislature, after Malbone s per- sonality and brush had won recognition among his fellow-townsmen. All that we know of Malbone s childhood is obtained from the long letter written bv his sister, Mrs. W'hitehome, published in 500 Malbone ancl His Miniatures Dunlap s  History of the Rise and Prog- ress of the Arts of Design in the United States.    1834.  This period of his life must he dismissed with the bare statement that from early childhood Malbone evi- denced great interest in the study of prints. The family were living in seclusion. Mal- bone spent much of his playtime alone in his room, drawing and painting in colors of his own manufacture. His devotion to art and it  kindred subjects was discouraged at  Providence, Oct. 11th, 1794.  Honored Sire-   Pardon me for leaving Newport so abruptly without informing you of my in- tention to stay at Providence, nor would I have you think me so bigoted to ingratitude as not to wish to repay with future services the many favours I have received from you, as 1 thought it was highly necessary for me to do something I chuse this for my first at- tempt which is like to prove successful as I "The Little Scotch Girl." home as his father believed it would inter- fere with success in the profession chosen for him. At the age of fifteen his drawings of heads gave him a local reputation, which two vears later was added toby the voluntary painting of scenes for the local theatre a field far removed from that in which he made his reputation. It was at this period that he began his lifelong friendship with Wash- ington Allston, then at school at Newport. In 1704 Malbone disappeared from his home and went to Providence, R. I ., where he established himself as a miniature painter, which fact some weeks later he announced to his father in the following letter: have hitherto been fortunate enough to give general satisfaction and have met with pub- lick approbation. I hope I may never be guilty of an action that may merit your dis- pleasure   sincerely wish that I may soon be able to render the family those services which cannot yet be expected; it shall be my fervent prayer that I may be qualified to succeed you  in that respect  before you make your exit. I must conclude with mak- ing use of that name which I shall study never to dishonour.   Your dutiful son,  Edward G. Malbone.   John Malbone, Esq.  Mrs. William ttlacklock.  Malbone and His Miniatures In this letter we see that the seventeen- year-old Malbone showeda stern realization of the step which he had taken, and a sense i f responsibility to sisters and beloved mother, a sense of responsibility that re- peatedly obliged him to forego opportunities for study abroad offered him by friends who recognized his talent. It foreshadowed also his devotion to the material needs of his family and the resulting overwork which laid his system open to the pulmonary trouble which caused his early death. In adopting the name of his father he merely added it to the name of Edward Greene, given him by his mother. W hile at Providence Malbone painted in 'Cpia the miniature reproduced on page 559, which remained in his possession until his death. This has been long thought to have been an original composition until search in the print department of the British Mu- seum revealed it to be a copy of an en- graving bv Bartolozzi after a painting by Angelica Kauffman, entitled  The Birth of Shakespeare,  and published in London in 17S2. The composition of the original is per- fectly preserved and the drawing is strong. W ith the aid of a magnifying glass minute- ness of detail is disclosed undiscoverable by the naked eye, The card which backed the ivory bears Malbone s signature and date, 1795. On the back of the gold case are scratched in Malbone s boyish hand the following lines from  The Enthusiast,  by Wharton Dodslev, which accompanied the original engraving: Sliakspear Whom on the 'winding Avon's   willowed bunks fair Fancy found , And bore the Smiling babe to a   close cavern Here as with honey   gathered from the rock She fed the   little prattler and 7i.'itli songs oft   soothed his wondering ears    With deef  delight on her soft tap   he sat and caught the sounds  In 1796 Malbone moved to Boston, where he was successful in obtaining many sitters, and while there was able to renew his friendship with Washington Allston, then a student at Harvard. The miniature reproduced facing page 562 was painted at this time, and shows us the twentv-year-old Malbone s conception of himself. The drawing is as powerful as in his portrait work of later years. Strength and tenderness are strongly defined in the Vol. XLVI 1.-58 mouth, and the eyes show that fixedness of purpose which made Malbone s life a con- tinued success. Another side of his char- acter is emphasized by the treatment of the hair in the style worn only by the exquis- ites of the dav, the artificiality of the color- ing of which is shown by the powder fallen on the shoulders. The same characteristics are found in the self-portrait in oil which hangs on the walls of the Smithsonian at Washington. The larger portrait, however, was painted some years later and shows marked traces of the disease which ended his life. The background of the minia- ture is crude and allows the conjecture that it was done at odd hours and never com- pleted, being laid aside when remunerative employment presented itself. The minia- ture bears the signature upon its face, and the card on the back in his own handwriting: Edv1 G. Malbone Miniature painter  797- Few if anv of Malbone s later portraits were signed. On some of his early work is found his initials, or .1 fiilbone firmly inscribed. During the next three years Malbone was eagerly sought as a painter in New York, Philadelphia, and Newport. In the late summer of 1S00 his failing health made it advisable that he avoid the vigor of the northern winters and he went to Charles- ton, where shortly he was joined bv Wash- ington Allston. Orders poured in to his studio and the peculiar hospitality for which this southern city has always been famed opened up to him the homes of its people. It was accentuated by the endearing quali- ties of the young northern painter. Much of his leisure time was spent in the company of Charles Fraser, then a law student, and later a miniaturist, whose work is second only to Malbone s in this country. In May, 1S01, the profits from his brush allowed Malbone to accompany Allston on a long looked-for trip abroad. His recep- tion by Benjamin West is thus recorded by Charles Fraser, when writing of his friend:  When in England he was introduced to the president of the Royal Academy, who, conceiving a high opinion of his talents, gave hinu free access to his study, and showed him those marked and friendly at- Malbone and His Miniatures tentions which were more flattering than empty praises to the mind of his young countryman. He even encouraged him to remain in England, assuring him that lie had nothing to fear from professional com- petition. But lie preferred his own coun- try, and returned to Charleston in the winter of 1801.  Malbone s own impressions of the work then being done in England are found in a letter to Charles Fraser:   Mr. West is decidedly the greatest paint- er amongst them for history. Mr. Lawrence is the best portrait painter. Mr. Fuseli, from whom we expected so much, I was disappointed in. After Lawrence, I think Sir William Beechv the next in portrait painting, and then Mr. Hopner. Some of Mr. Copley s historical pieces I think very tine. So are Mr. Trumbull s, but I do not admire his portraits. Amongst miniature painters, I think Mr. Shelley and Mr. Cos- way the best. Mr. West has complimented Mr. Allston and myself, and tells us we shall excel in the art. Yesterday was the first time he has seen a picture cl my painting; to-day he condescended tc walk a mile to pay me a visit, and told me that I must not look forward to anything short of the highest excellence. He was surprised to see how far I had advanced without in- struction.  For a short time Malbone drew at the Roval Academy. The necessity of providing for those at home cut short his stav abroad, and obliged him to return to Charleston in December, i8ot. During the next two years he filled many engagements in the cities along the seaboard. His charm and personality made him more than welcome everywhere. H owever, he allowed nothing to interfere with the eight hours a day set aside for his profession. The confinement to his studio wore on his constitution, and in 1805 lie was obliged to give up work and seek to re-establish his health. The next year he went to Jamaica where he failed to secure the hoped-for benefit. In December he returned to the United States and landed at Savannah where he died on the 7th of May, 1807, at the home of his cousin Robert Mackay.

Sno v l  i Marshall, 1 desire to express my obligation f  r the information as to Malhone's family history, and the  xTmissi  n to rt pr  duce the miniature  The Birth of Shakespeare.  Page 559. Malbone s clientele was largely among the aristocracy of the period, and almost all of his portraits have added interest on account of the personality of the subjects. None of his miniatures show more forcible handling than his portrait of Captain George Izard, reproduced facing page 562. The drawing is powerful and the technic fault- less. It possesses the unusual combination of strong modelling without heavy shad- ows. The composition is well conceived. The dark blue of the coat is in striking con- trast to the fleecy sky of the background and light brown hair and warm complexion of the subject. The brilliant scarlet neck- erchief adds life to the portrait and is only kept subordinate to the features by the free use of vermilion in all the shadows of the face. The face has intensity and sin- ceritv of feeling and lacks all forced and theatrical effects. The eyes are strong and commanding. The portrait possesses the quality of bigness so lacking in the work of other miniaturists of the period. For a proper appreciation of Malbone s power of delineating character as here shown, a brief sketch of Izard's previous career is necessary. He had passed twenty- seven eventful and character-making years and had opportunities for acquiring an ed- ucation and culture such as fall to the lot of few. He was of aristocratic lineage, be- ing the son of Ralph Izard, of Westover, S. C., and Alice Delancev, of New York, both of Huguenot ancestry, and both from families long prominent in the social and political upbuilding of their respective col- onies. George Izard was born in Richmond, England, October 21, 1776, shortly after Copley had painted the portrait of his parents, now hanging on the walls of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. His early days were spent in Paris, where his father was in the diplomatic service of the United States. In 1780 the family returned to South Carolina. In 1789 Ralph Izard took up his resi- dence in New York and represented his State in the newly formed Senate of the United States; at the same time George entered Columbia College. The removal of the Federal Capital to Philadelphia caused the Izard family to follow it, and in 1791 George entered the Junior class of the University of Pennsylvania, and grad- Edward Greene Malbone.  Malbone and His Miniatures 503 uated the next year while still in his six- teenth year. A military career was chosen for him. In order to complete his education he was sent abroad in the care of Thomas Pinckney, the newly appointed American minister at the Court of St. James. He entered the military school at Ken- sington from whence he went to Edinburgh where Angelo taught himridingand fencing. He then spent two years at the military school at Marburg, and an equal time at the French engineering school at Metz. In 1794, while still abroad, he was ap- pointed lieutenant of the United States Ar- tillery. On his return to America in 1797 he was ordered to Charleston as engineer in charge of the fortification of Castle Pinckney. In 1799 he obtained his cap- taincy. The war with France seemed im- minent, and he was ordered to New York as aid to General Alexander Hamilton. When the war clouds dispersed he went to Portugal as secretary to his brother-in-law, William L. Smith, our charge there, which position he resigned in 1801 and leisurely visited England and Paris. On his return he was given the command of Fort Miffin, and later of the military post at West Point. In 1803, just before his marriage, he left the army and visited his former home, when undoubtedly the miniature was painted.  In his miniature of Joel R. Poinsett  facing page 560  Malbone gives us the portrait in the flush of early manhood of another aristo- cratic young South Carolinian, whose later services to his country demand that his name, now almost forgotten, be ever pre- served high on her roll of diplomats and statesmen. Poinsett, as we see him in the miniature, belonged to that interesting group of Americans sent abroad to secure the ad- vantages in education which our own insti- tutions were unable to supply. The   were provided with leisure and abundant means for travel, and in their journeyings on the continent, for their personal charm and intellectuality were welcomed in royal and official circles on terms of intimacy unat- tainable by others of later years. Joel R. Poinsett was born in Charles- ton, March 2, 1778. He received his early  George Izard s tastes were largely intellectual and scien- tific. He became an active member of the American Philo- sophical Society of Philadelphia. His patriotism caused him to volunteer his services in the War of 1812, when he rose to the rank of Major-General. He died at Little Rock, in 1828, while acting as Governor of Arkansas Territory, under appointment from President Monr    schooling in Charleston, and had spent two years at the School at Greenfield, Conn., under Dr. Timothy Dwight, when failing health obliged him to return home. In 1796 he entered St. Paul s School, London, where he added to his knowledge of the classics. He was a natural linguist and soon acquired a good knowledge of the French, German, Italian, and Spanish lan- guages. He then went to Edinburgh and took up the study of medicine. Again his health broke down. A trip to Portugal was most beneficial; on his return to England he decided to lit himself for the army and placed himself under the care of Marquois, a former professor of the Military School at Woolwich. The decision was a happy one, for Poinsett acquired a thorough practical knowledge of military affairs, which later on equipped him for the position of Secre- tary of War, to which he was appointed by President Van Buren in 1837. Of greater value still was the building up of his health through the out-of-door life he was obliged to lead. He returned home, and, at the wish of his father, entered upon the study of law an occupation which soon proved uncongenial and wasabandoned for another trip to Europe. The winter of 1801-02 was spent in Paris, where he lived in a circle of interesting people attracted thither to watch Napoleon s efforts to efface the prin- ciples of the French Revolution from the minds of the people and bring order out of chaos. 'I'he study of political economvbe- came a passion, and he made a visit to Italy for the purpose of viewing at short range the causes of political unrest there. Thence he travelled to Switzerland, then in the tur- moils of her struggles for Cantonnal inde- pendence. He visited the camp of Aloys Reding, the insurgent leader, and by him was induced to enter his army. The cam- paign, which at first bid fair to be suc- cessful, was ended by the crushing defeat of the patriots. Through an introduction from Edward Livingston, our minister to France, Poinsett metNecker and his daugh- ter, Madame de Stael, then living in exile in Coppet, on Lake Geneva. With them he passed several months of intimate com- panionship, and acquired from the veteran statesman and his talented daughter knowl- edge of much of the unwritten diplomatic history of Europe and America. Poinsett then went to Vienna where he Malbone and 1 Iis Miniatures was fortunate enough to gain the interest of the Prince de Ligne, the foremost w arrior of Southern Kurope, and at whose salons Ik- had the opportunity ot meeting the elite of the gav Austrian capital. News of the death of his father and illness of his sister  portrait facing page 560  cut short his stay there and made necessary his return to CharlesU m.  At this period the portrait was painted. In it we find a decidedly different treatment from that of the Izard, and a well-defined example of Malbone s sympathetic hand- ling of his sitter s mood. The occasion allowed no use of the brilliant colors Mal- bone delighted in. The black mourning coat, clear brown complexion, grayish brown eves, black hair, formed a combination diffi- cult to handle artistically without the use of the heavy shadows, absent in all of Mal- bone s portraiture. The face is tinged with sadness and is less boldly painted than that of many of his other portraits, vet has the same sincereness of understanding so char- acteristic of Malbone s work. The gloom of the color scheme is largely dispelled by the use of a background suggestive of the sky after the breaking of an April shower. The portrait of Miss Poinsett is a good example of Malbone's power of meeting a difficult situation. His subject had just recovered from a serious illness. II owever, by the ingenious use of a handkerchief as a head-band to conceal the shortened locks, a certain picturesqueness was given to the portrait. Artistic license undoubtedly was taken in the coloring of the face. The eves, however, are those of a woman who had been through a long illness. The treat- ment of the dress left little to be desired. The miniature of Mrs. William lilack- lockf is one of the largest portraits Malbone executed on ivory, and shows the influence of Gainsborough in composition and back- ground. The subject is of the Huguenot type still seen in Charleston to-day. Re- finement and affection, not beauty of fea- tures, are the predominate notes. The face is tender with maternal love, and there is a strong characterization in the lips and cor- Poinsett s subsequent ranvr in flu  service of his counlrv xv.is wi n more interesting ami isdestribi .1 .it length in The l.ift-V rviu s of J..el k.   .tinsel    l y   has.

The hair is skilfully done, and the delicate flesh tones and modelling indicate aristocracy of breeding. The face of the two-year-old boy might be described as oldish, a characteristic of the children s portraiture of the times. The feeling of affection shown in the mother s face is supplemented by the clinging posi- tion of the child, and the little arm clutch- ing the lock of his mother s hair. The background of brilliant crimson cur- tains and chair with its ormolu trimmings, and Gainsborough sky is in strong contrast, yet subordinate to the pearly gray satin and white of the dresses. The green and rose of the sashes are low in value, and complete the full color scheme  facing page 560 . Malbone was easily at his best in por- traiture. His famous composition  The Hours,  now owned by the Athemeum at Providence, is remarkable for its brilliancy and harmony of coloring and execution, yet lacks the vigor and closeness to nature so characteristic of his portrait work. It was painted in Malbone s short stay in the studios of London, and showed a desire to imitate the tendency of the English School, a desire which lack of technical training made impossible, and which, fortunately, Malbone soon put behind him. of this same period is the miniature long known in Savannah as  The Little Scotch Girl   page 560 , and which it is believed was also painted on this trip to London. This miniature unmistakably shows the impression made upon Malbone by a study of the canvases of Hoppner, and along with  The Hours  must be considered a concession to a tradition which sacrifices truth to pictorial beauty. In the idealiza- tion of the features there is evidence of a lack of the sincerity so prominent in his portrait work. The head is too large for the body. The size of the eves and small- ness of the mouth are artificial. Strength and character, Malbone s best assets, are sacrificed for prettiness. The dark blue eyes, rich chestnut hair, golden girdle, clear complexion, blue shad- ows in the white draperv, and blue land- scape setting make the color scheme a rich one, and the lighting of the hair, face, and draperies is all that can be desired. The background, atmosphere, and perspective are worthy of Malbone s best efforts, and involuntarily cause regret that Malbone did Malbone and His Miniatures not leave behind him more evidences of his skill in landscape painting. Malbone s reputation rests on the cor- rect drawing and acute discernment of char- acter, always present in his portraits, coup- led with harmony and truth in coloring. His portraits show the absence of forced and theatrical effects. Practically all his work was done when reiving upon inspira- tion derived from within. Occasionally, as in the case of the miniatures of  Mrs. Blacklock  and the  Little Scotch Girl,   when his inspiration was gained from with- out, he failed to secure the frankness and honesty so predominant in the work done under the influence of his own intuition. The English School of painters alone made any impression upon him. When viewing together with him in London the examples of Titian, Veronese, Rembrandt, and others on exhibition, Washington All- ston recorded his horror at Malbone's point- ing to a portrait by Sir Thomas Lawrence and saying that he would rather possess it than all the other pictures of the collection. Malbone s work showed great saneness and wasnot affected by mannerisms. He painted portraits, not types, in which he differed from his great English contemporaries, Coswav and Shelley. All his pictures  how his ability to adapt himself to his sitter s moods. He was not self-centred: his work was even; and he never sacrifu ed character t   prettiness. It is unfortunate that our art museums afford almost no opportunity of studying the work of the American who ranks among the world s great miniaturists. The Boston Museum possesses his portrait of Washing- ton Allston, and the Metropolitan his ivorv, sadly faded, of Mrs. Greene. Fortunately, many examples of his work still exist, treasured heirlooms in the old mahogany families of the cities where Malbone painted over a century ago. Charleston, which took the young northern painter to her arms, where his happiest days were spent, and which claims him as her own, is a particu- larly rich field for the studv of his portraiture. It is difficult to close tiii  sketch of Mal- bone, without giving expression to the hope that now that our art museums have awak- ened to an appreciation of American art, a complete loan exhibition of Malbone's work be held, and a catalogue nihonne be made therefrom. Its pages would pre- serve to future generations a long series of remarkable portraits of our eighteenth cen- tury men and women, painted by one of our own people, with an American's power to differentiate between American and Eng- lish character. COMRADES By G. E. Woodberry Where are the friends that I knew in my Maying, In the days of my youth, in the first of my roaming  We were dear; we were leal; O, far we went straying; Now never a heart to my heart conies homing   Where is he now, the dark boy slender Who taught me bare-back, stirrup and reins  I loved him; he loved me; my beautiful, tender Tamer of horses on grass-grown plains. Where is he now whose eyes swam brighter, Softer than love, in his turbulent charms; Who taught me to strike, and to fall, dear fighter, And gathered me up in his boyhood arms; Taught me the rifle, and with me went riding, Suppled my limbs to the horseman s war; Where is he now, for whom my heart s biding. Biding, biding but he rides far  0 love that passes the love of woman  Who that hath felt it shall ever forget, When the breath of life with a throb turns human, And a lad s heart is to a lad s heart set  Ever, forever, lover and rover  They shall cling, nor each from other shall part Till the reign of the stars in the heavens be over, And life is dust in each faithful heart   They are dead, the American grasses under; There is no one now who presses my side; By the African chotts I am riding asunder, And with great joy ride I the last great ride. 1 am fey; I am fain of sudden dying; Thousands of miles there is no one near; And my heart all the night it is crying, crying In the bosoms of dead lads clarling-dear. Hearts of my music them dark earth covers; Comrades to die, and to die for, were they; In the width of the world there were no such rovers  Back to back, breast to breast, it was ours to stay; And the highest on earth was the vow that we cherished. To spur forth from the crowd and come back never more. And to ride in the track of great souls perished Till the nests of the lark shall roof us o er. Yet lingers a horseman on Altai highlands, Who hath joy of me, riding the Tartar glissade; And one, far faring o er orient islands Whose blood yet glints with my blade s accolade; North, west, east, I fling you my last hallooing, Last love to the breasts where my own has bled; Through the reach of the desert my soul leaps pursuing My star where it rises a Star of the Dead. PEACE MANOEUVRES By Richard 1 larding Davis scout stood where three roads cut three green tunnels in the pine woods, and met at his feet. Above his head an aged sign-post pointed impartially to East Carver, South Carver, and Carver Centre, and left the choice to him. The scout scowled and bit nervously at his gauntlet. The choice was difficult, and there was no one with whom he could take counsel. The three sun-shot roads lay empty, and the other scouts, who, with him, had left the main column at sunrise, he had ordered back. They were to report that on the right flank, so far, at least, as Mid- dleboro, there was no sign of the enemy. What lay beyond, it now was his duty to discover. The three empty roads spread before him like a picture puzzle, smiling at his predicament. Whichever one he followed left two unguarded. Should he creep upon for choice Carver Centre, the enemy, masked by a mile of fir trees, might advance from Carver or South Carver, and obviously he could not follow three roads at the same time. He considered the bet- ter strategy would be to wait where he was, where the three roads met, and allow the enemy himself to disclose his position. To the scout this course was most distaste- ful. He assured himself that this was so because, while it were the safer course, it wasted time and lacked initiative. But in his heart he knew that was not the reason, and to his heart his head answered that when one s country is at war, when fields and firesides are trampled by the iron heels of the invader, a scout should not act ac- cording to the dictates of his heart, but in the service of his native land. In the case of this particular patriot, the man and scout were at odds. As one of the Bi- cycle Squad of the Boston Corps of Cadets, the scout knew what, at this momentous crisis in her history, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts demanded of him. It was that he sit tight and wait for the hated foreigners from New York City, New Jersey, and Connecticut to show them- selves. But the man knew, and had known for several years, that on the road to Car- ver Centre was the summer home of one Beatrice Farrar. As Private Lathrop it was no part of his duty to know that. As a man and a lover, and a rejected lover at that, he could not think of anything else. Strug- gling between love and duty, the scout basely decided to leave the momentous question to chance. In the front tire of his bicycle was a puncture, temporarily effaced by a plug. Laying the bicycle on the ground, Lathrop spun the front wheel swiftly.  If,  he decided,  the wheel stops with the puncture pointing at Carver Centre, I ll advance upon Carver Centre. Should it point to either of the two other villages, I ll stop here.  It s a two to one shot against me, any way,  he growled. Kneeling in the road he spun the wheel, and as intently as at Monte Carlo and Palm Beach he had waited for other wheels to de- termine his fortune, he watched it come to rest. It stopped with the plug pointing back to Middleboro. The scout told himself he was entitled to another trial. Again he spun the wheel. Again the spokes flashed in the sun. Again the puncture rested on the road to Middle- boro.  If it does that once more,  thought the scout,  it's a warning that there is trouble ahead for me at Carver, and all the little Carvers.  For the third time the wheel flashed, but as he waited for the impetus to die, the sound of galloping hoofs broke sharply on the silence. The scout threw himself and his bicycle over the nearest stone wall, and, unlimbering his rifle, pointed it down the road. He saw approaching a small boy, in a white apron, seated in a white wagon, on which was painted, "Pies and Pastry. East Wareham.  The boy dragged his horse to an abrupt halt.  Don t point that at me   shouted the boy. 567 Peace Manoeuvres   Where do you come from " demanded the scout.  Wareham,  said the baker.  Are you carrying any one concealed in that wagon   As though to make sure the baker s boy glanced apprehensively into the depths of his cart, and then answered that in the wagon he carried nothing hut fresh-baked bread. To the trained nostrils of the scout this already was evident. Before sunrise lie had breakfasted on hard tack and muddy coffee, and the odor of crullers and mince pie, still warm, assailed him cruelly. He assumed a fierce and terrible aspect.   Where are you going   he challenged.  To Carver Centre,  said the boy. To chance Lathrop had left the decision. He believed the fates had answered. Dragging his bicycle over the stone wall, he fell into the road. "Go on,  he commanded.  I ll r e your cart for a screen. I ll creep behind the enemy before he sees me.  The baker s boy frowned unhappily.  But supposing," he argued,  they see you first, will they shoot   The scout waved his hand carelessly.  Of course,  he cried.    Then,  said the baker,  my horse will run away    What of it   demanded the scout.  Are Middleboro, South Middleboro, Rock, Brockton, and Boston to fall  Are they to be captured because you re afraid of your own horse  They won t shoot red bullets  This is not a real war. Don't you know that   The baker s boy llushed with indigna- tion.  Sure, I know that,  he protested;  but my horse he don t know that   Lathrop slung his ritle over his shoulder and his leg over his bicycle.  If the Reds catch you,  he warned, in parting,  they ll take everything you've got.    The Blues have took most of it already,  wailed the boy.  And just as they were paving me the battle begun, and this horse run away, and 1 couldn t get him to come back for my money.    War,  exclaimed Lathrop morosely,  is always cruel to the innocent.  He sped toward Carver Centre. In his motor car, he had travelled the road many times, and as always his goal had been the home of Miss Beatrice Farrar, he had covered it at a speed unrecognized by law. But now he advanced with stealth and caution. In every clump of bushes he saw an ambush. Behind each rock he beheld the enemy. In a clearing was a group of Portuguese cranberry pickers, dressed as though for a holiday. When they saw the man in uni- form, one of the women hailed him anxiously.   Is the parade coming     she called.  Have you seen any of the Reds   Lathrop returned.  No,  complained the woman.  And we been waiting all morning. When will the parade come     It s not a parade,  said Lathrop, se- verely.  It s a war   The summer home of Miss Farrar stood close to the road. It had been so placed by the farmer who built it, in order that the women folk might sit at the window and watch thepassing of the stage-coach and the pedler. Great elms hung over it, and a white fence separated the road from the narrow' lawTn. At a distance of a hundred yards a turn brought the house into view, and at this turn, as had been his manoeuvre at every other possible ambush, Lathrop dismounted and advanced on foot. Up to this moment the road had been empty, but now, in front of the Farrar cottage, it was blocked by a touring-car and a station wagon. In the occupants of the car he recognized all the members of the Farrar family, except Miss Farrar. In the station wagon were all of the Farrar servants. Miss Farrar herself w'as leaning upon the gate ami waving them a farewell. The touring-car moved off down the road; the station wagon followed; Miss Farrar was alone. Lathrop scorched toward her, and when he was opposite the gate, dug his toes in the dust and halted. When he lifted his broad-brimmed campaign hat, Miss Farrar exclaimed both with surprise and dis- pleasure. Drawing back from the gate she held herself erect. Her attitude was that of one prepared for instant retreat. When she spoke it was in tones of extreme disapproval.  You promised,  said the girl,  you would not come to see me.  Lathrop, straddling his bicycle, peered anxiouslv down the road. Peace Manoeuvres 569   This is not a social call,  he said.   I m on duty. Have you seen any of the Reds    His tone was brisk and alert, his manner preoccupied. The ungraciousness of his reception did not seem in the least to dis- concert him. But Miss Farrar was not deceived. She knew him, not only as a persistent and irre- pressible lover, but as one full of guile, adroit in tricks, fertile in expedients. He was one who could not take  No  for an answer at least not from her. When she repulsed him she seemed to grow in his eyes only the more attractive.   It is not the lover who comes to woo,  he was constantly explaining,  but the lover s way of wooing.  Miss Farrar had assured him she did not like his way. She objected to being re- garded and treated as a castle that could be taken only by assault. Whether she wished time to consider, or whether he and his proposal were really obnoxious to her, he could not find out. His policy of cam- paign was that she, also, should not have time to find out. Again and again she had promised to see him only on the condition that he would not make love to her. He had promised again and again, and had failed to keep that promise. Only a week before he had been banished from her presence, to remain an exile until she gave him permission to see her at her home in New York. It was not her purpose to re- turn there for two weeks, and yet here he was, a beggar at her gate. It might be that he was there, as he said,  on duty,  but her knowledge of him and of the doctrine of chances caused her to doubt it.  Mr. Lathrop   she began, severely. As though to see to whom she had spoken Lathrop glanced anxiously over his shoul- der. Apparently pained and surprised to find that it was to him she had addressed herself, he regarded her with deep re- proach. His eyes were very beautiful. It was a fact which had often caused Miss Farrar extreme annoyance. He shook his head sadly.   Mr. Lathrop    he protested.  You know that to you I am always  Charles    Charles the Bold,  because I am bold to love you; but never   Mr. Lathrop,  unless,  he went on, briskly,  you are referring to a future state, when, as Mrs. Lathrop, you will make me-  Miss Farrar had turned her back on him, and was walking rapidly up the path.  Beatrice,  he called.  I am coming after you   Miss Farrar instantly returned and placed both hands firmly upon the gate.  I cannot understand you   she said.  Don t you see that when you act as you do now, I can't even respect you   How do you think I could ever care, when you offend me so  You jest at what you pre- tend is the most serious thing in your life. You play with it laugh at it    The young man interrupted her sharply.   It s like this,  he said.   When I am with you I am so happy 1 can t be serious. When I am not with you, it is so serious that I am utterly and completely wretched. You say my love offends you, bores you  1 am sorry, but what, in Heaven s name, do you think you re not loving me is doing to me  I am a wreck  I am a skeleton  Look at me   He let his bicycle fall, and stood with his hands open at his sides, as though inviting her to gaze upon the ruin she had caused. Four days of sun and rain, astride of a bicycle, without food or sleep, had drawn his face into fine, hard lines, had bronzed it with a healthy tan. His uniform, made by the same tailor that fitted him with polo breeches, clung to him like a jersey. The spectacle he presented was that of an extremely picturesque, handsome, manlv youth, and of that fact no one was better aware than himself.  Look at me,  he begged, sadly. Miss Farrar was entirely unimpressed.   1 am   she returned, coldly.  I never saw you looking so well and you know it." She gave a gasp of comprehension.   You came here because you knew your uniform was becoming   Lathrop regarded himself complacently.   Yes. isn t it     he assented.   I brought on this war in order to wear it. If you don t mind,  he added,   I think I'll accept your invitation and come inside. I ve had nothing to eat in four days.  Miss Farrar's eyes flashed indignantly.  You're not coming inside,  she de dared;  but if you ll only promise to go away at once, I ll bring you everything in the house.    In that house,  exclaimed Lathrop, dramatically,  there s only one thing that 570 Peace Manoeuvres I desire, and I want that so badly, that  life holds no charm without you.   Miss Farrar regarded him steadily.   Do you intend to drive me away from my own door, or will you go   Lathrop picked his wheel out of the dust.  Good-by,  he said. "I ll come back when you have made up your mind.  In vexation Miss Farrar stamped her foot upon the path.  I have made up my mind   she pro- tested.   Then,  returned Lathrop,  I ll come back when you have changed it.  He made a movement as though to ride away, but much to Miss Farrar s dismay, hastily dismounted.  On.second thoughts,  he said,  it isn t right for me to leave you. The woods are full of tramps and hangers- on of the army. You re not safe. I can watch this road from here as well as from anywhere else, and at the same time I can guard you.  To the consternation of Miss Farrar he placed his bicycle against the fence, and, as though preparing for a visit, leaned his elbows upon it.  I do not wish to be rude,  said Miss Farrar,  but you are annoying me. I have spent fifteen summers in Massachusetts, and I have never seen a tramp. I need no one to guard me.    If not you,  said Lathrop, easily,   then the family silver. And think of your jewels, and your mother's jewels. Think of your- self in a house tilled with jewels, and entirely surrounded by hostile armies  My duty is to remain with you.  Miss Farrar wras so long in answering, that Lathrop lifted his head and turned to look. He found her frowning and gazing intently into the shadow of the woods, across the road. When she felt his eyes upon her she turned her own guiltily upon him. Her cheeks were flushed and her face glowed with some unusual excitement.  I wish,  she exclaimed, breathlessly   I wish,  she repeated,  the Reds would take you prisoner    Take me where   asked Lathrop.  Take you anywhere   cried Miss Far- rar.   You should be ashamed to talk to me when you should be looking for the enemy    I am wailing for him,  explained Lathrop.  It s the same thing.  Miss Farrar smiled vindictively. Her eyes shone.  You need not wait long,  she said. There was the crash of a falling stone wall, and of parting bushes, but not in time to give Lathrop warning. As though from the branches of the trees opposite two soldiers fell into the road; around his hat each wore the red band of the invader; each pointed his rifle at Lathrop.  Hands up   shouted one.  You re my prisoner   cried the other. Mechanically Lathrop raised his hands, but his eyes turned to Miss Farrar.  Did you know   he asked.  I have been watching them,  she said,  creeping up on you for the last ten minutes.  Lathrop turned to the two soldiers, and made an effort to smile.  That was very clever,  he said,  but I have twenty men up the road, and behind them a regiment. You had belter get away while you can.  The two Reds laughed derisively. One, who wore the stripes of a sergeant, an- swered:  That won t do  We been a mile up the road, and you and us are the only soldiers on it. Gimme the gun   Lathrop knewr he had no right to refuse. He had been fairly surprised, but he hesi- tated. When Miss Farrar was not in his mind his amateur soldiering was to him a most serious proposition. The war game was a serious proposition, and that, through his failure for ten minutes to regard it seri- ously, he had been made a prisoner, morti- fied him keenly. That his humiliation had taken place in the presence of Beatrice Farrar did not lessen his discomfort, nor did the explanation he must later make to his captain afford him any satisfaction. Already he saw himself playing the star part in a court-martial. He shrugged his shoulders and surrendered his gun. As he did so he gloomily scrutinized the insignia of his captors.  Who took me   he asked.   II c took you,  exclaimed the sergeant.  What regiment   demanded Lathrop, sharply.  I have to report who took me; and you prc .ably don t know it, but your collar ornaments are upside down.  With genuine exasperation he turned to Miss Farrar.  Lord   he exclaimed,  isn t it bad i uace manoeuvres enough to he taken prisoner, without being taken by raw recruits that can t put on their uniforms   The Reds Hushed, and the younger, a sandy-haired, rat-faced youth, retorted an- grily:   Mebbe we ain t strong on uniforms, beau,  he snarled,  but you ve got nothing on us vet, that 1 can see. You look pretty with your hands in the air, don t you "  Shut up,  commanded the other Red. He was the older man, heavily built, with a strong, hard mouth and chin, on which latter s  matted a three days  iron-gray beard.  Don't you sec he s an officer  Officers don t like being took by two-spot privates.  Lathrop gave a sudden start.   Why,  he laughed, incredulously,  don t you know   He stopped, and his eyes glanced quickly up and down the road.  Don t we know what   demanded the older Red, suspiciously.  I forgot,  said Lathrop.  I I must not give information to the enemy-  For an instant there was a pause, while the two Reds stood irresolute. Then the older nodded the other to the side of the road, and in whispers they consulted eagerly. Miss Farrar laughed, and Lathrop moved toward her. " I deserve worse than being laughed at,  he said.  I made a strategic mistake. 1 should not have tried to capture you and an army corps at the same time.   You,  she taunted,  who were always so keen on soldiering, to be taken prisoner,  she lowered her voice,  and by men like that  Aren t they funny   she whispered,  and East Side and Tenderloin  It made me homesick to hear them  I think when not in uniform the little one drives a taxi- cab, and the big one is a guard on the Elevated.   They' certainly are very  New York,   assented Lathrop,  and very tough.   I thought,  whispered Miss Farrar,  those from New York with the Red Army were  ticked men.   What does it matter   exclaimed La- throp   It s just as humiliating to be capt- ured by a hall-room boy as by a mere millionaire  I can't insist on the invading army being entirely recruited from Harvard graduates.  The two Reds either had reached a de- cision, or agreed that they could not agree, for they ceased whispering, and crossed to where Lathrop stood.  We been talking over your case,  ex- plained the sergeant,  and we see we are in wrong. We see we made a mistake in tak- ing you prisoner. We had ought to shot you dead. So now we re going to shoot you dead.   You can t   objected Lathrop.  It's too late. You should have thought of that sooner.   I know,  admitted the sergeant,  but a prisoner is a hell of a nuisance. If you got a prisoner to look after, you can t do your own work; you got to keep tabs on him. And there ain t nothing in it for the prisoner, neither. If we take you, you ll have to tramp all the way to our army, and all the way back. But, if you re dead, how different  You ain t no bother to anybody. You got a half holiday all to yourself, and you can loaf around the camp, so dead that they can t make you work, but not so dead you can t smoke or eat.  The sergeant smiled ingratiatingly. In a tempting man- ner he exhibited his rifle.   Better be dead,  he urged.  I'd like to oblige you,  said Lathrop,   but it s against the rules. You can't shoot a prisoner.  The rat-faced soldier uttered an angry exclamation.  To hell with the rules " he cried.   We can't waste time on him. Turn him loose   The older man rounded on the little one savagely. The tone in which he addressed him was cold, menacing, sinister. His words were simple, but his eyes anti face were heavy with warning.  Who is running this   he asked. The little soldier muttered, and shuffled away. From under the brim of his cam- paign hat, his eyes cast furtive glances up and down the road. As though anxious to wipe out the effect of his comrade s words, the sergeant addressed Lathrop suavely and in a tone of conciliation. "You see,  he explained,  him and me arc scouts. We re not supposed to waste time taking prisoners. So, we ll set you free.  He waved his hand invitingly to- ward the bicycle.  You can go   he said. To Miss Farrar s indignation Lathrop, instead of accepting his freedom, remained motionless.   I can t   he said.   I m on post. My Peace Manoeuvres captain ordered me to stay in front of this house until 1 was relieved.  Miss Farrar, amazed at such duplicity, exclaimed aloud. " He is not on post   she protested.   He s a scout  He wants to stop here, because  because he's hungry. 1 wouldn t have let you make him prisoner, if 1 had not thought you would take him away with you.  She appealed to the sergeant.   Please take him away,  she begged. The sergeant turned sharply upon his prisoner.  Why don t you do what the lady wants   lie demanded.  Because I've got to do what my cap- tain wants,  returned Lathrop,  and he put me on sentry-go, in front of this house.  W ith the back of his hand, the sergeant fretfully scraped the three days  growth on his chin.  There s nothing to it   he ex- claimed,  but for to take him with us. When we meet some more Reds we ll turn him over. Fall in    he commanded.  Xo   protested Lathrop. "I don't want to be turned over. I ve got a much better plan. You don t want to be bothered with a prisoner.   don t want to be a prisoner. As you say, 1 am better dead. You can't shoot a prisoner, but if he tries to escape, you can. I ll try to escape. You shoot me. Then I return to my own army, and report myself dead. That ends your difficulty and saves me from a court-mar- tial. They can't court-martial a corpse.  The face of the sergeant flashed with re lief and satisfaction. In his anxiety to rid himself of his prisoner, he lifted the bicyc le into the road and held it in readiness.  You re all right   he said, heartily. "You can make your getaway as quick as you like.  But to the conspiracy Miss Farrar re- fused to lend herself.  How do you know,  she demanded, "that he will keep his promise  He may not go back to his own army. He can be just as dead on my lawn as anywhere else   Lathrop shook his head at her sadly.  How you wrong me   he protested.  How dare you doubt the promise of a dying man  These are really my last words, and 1 wish I could think of some- thing to say suited to the occasion, but the presence of strangers prevents.  He mounted his bicycle.   If I had a thousand lives to give,   he quoted with fervor,   I d give them all to he hesi- tated. and smiled mournfully on Miss Far- rar. Seeing her flushed and indignant countenance, he added, with haste,  to the Commonwealth of Massachusetts   As he started his wheel slowly down the path, he turned to the sergeant.  I m escaping,  he explained. The Reds, with an enthusiasm undoubtedly genuine, raised their rifles, and the calm of the Indian summer was shattered by two sharp reports. Lathrop, looking back over his shoulder, waved one hand reassuringly.   Death was instantaneous,  he called. He bent his body over the handle-bar, and they watched him disappear rapidly around the turn in the road. Miss Farrar sighed with relief.  Thank vou, very much,  she said. As though signifying that to oblige a woman he would shoot any number of prisoners, the sergeant raised his hat.  Don t mention it, lady,  he said.  I seen he was annoying you, and that s why 1 got rid of him. Some of them amateur soldiers, as soon as they get into uniform, arc too fresh. He took advantage of you because your folks were away from home. But don t you worry about that. I ll guard this house until your folks get back.  Miss Farrar protested warmly.   Really   she exclaimed; " I need no one to guard me.  But the soldier was obdurate. He mo- tioned his comrade down the road.  Watch at the turn,  he ordered;  he may come back or send some of the Blues to take us. I ll stav here and protect the lady.  Again Miss Farrar protested, but the ser- geant in a benign and fatherly manner smiled reprovingly. Seating himself on the grass outside the fence, he leaned his back against the gate-post, apparently settling himself for conversation.  Now, how long might it have been,   he asked,  before we showed up, that you seen us    I saw you," Miss Farrar said,  when Mr. when that bicvde scout Was talking to me. 1 saw the red bands on your hats among the bushes.  The sergeant appeared interested.  But why didn't you let on to him   Miss Farrar laughed, evasively. Peace Manoeuvres   Maybe because I am from New York, too,  she said. "Perhaps 1 wanted to see soldiers from my city take a prisoner.  They were interrupted by the sudden appearance of the smaller soldier.    n liis rat-like countenance was written deep con- cern.   When I got to the turn,  he began, breathlessly,  '1 couldn t see him.

He sprang to his feet, his under jaw protruding tru  - ulently, his eyes Hashing with anger.  Get back,  he snarled.   Do what 1 told you   Under his breath he muttered words that, to Miss Farrar, were unintelligible. The little rat-like man nodded, and ran from them down the road. The sergeant made an awkward gesture of apology.  Excuse me. lady,  he begged, "but it makes me hot when them rookies won t obey orders. You see,  he ran on glibly,  I'm a reg lar; served three years in the Philippines, anti 1 can t get used to not having my men do what 1 say.  Miss Farrar nodded, and started toward the house. The sergeant sprang quickly across the road.  Have you ever been in the Philippines, Miss   he called.   It s a great country.  Miss Farrar halted, and shook her head. She was considering how far politeness re- quired of her to entertain unshaven militia- men, who insisted on making sentries of themselves at her front gate. The sergeant had plunged garrulously into a confusing description of the Far Fast. He was clasping the pickets of the fence with his hands, and his eyes were fastened on hers. He lacked neither confidence nor vocabulary, and not for an instant did his tongue hesitate or his eyes wander, and yet in his manner there was nothing at which she could take offence. He appeared only amiably vain that he had seen much of the world, and anxious to impress that fact upon another. Miss Farrar was bored, but the man gave her no opportunity to escape. In consequence she was relieved when the noisy approach of an automobile brought him to an abrupt pause. Coming rapidly down the road was a large touring-car, filled with men in khaki. The sergeant gave one glance at it, and leaped across the road, taking cover behind the stone wall. Instantly lie raised his head above it and shook his fist at Miss Farrar.   Don t tell." he commanded.  They re Blues in that t ar  Don't tell   Again he sank from sight. Miss Farrar now was .liore than bored, slu- was annoyed. Why grown men should play at war so seriously she could not un- derstand. It was absurd  She no longer would remain a party to it; and, lest the men in the car might involve her still fur ther, she retreated hastily toward the house. As she opened the door the car halted at the gate, and voices called to her, but she pretended not to hear them, and continued up the stairs. Behind her the car passed noisily on its way. She mounted the stairs, and crossing a landing, moved down a long hall, at the further end of which was her bedroom. The hall was uncarpeted, but the tennis shoes she wore made no sound, nor did the door of her bet I room when she pushed it open. On the threshold Miss Farrar stood quite still. A swift, sinking nausea held her in a vice. Her instinc t was to scream and run, but her throat had tightened and gone dry, and her limbs trembled. Opposite the door was her dressing-table, and reflected in its mirror were the features and figure of the rat-like soldier. Ilis batk was toward her. With one hand he swept the dressing-table. The other, hanging at his side, held a re- volver. Tn a moment the panic into which Miss Farrar had been thrown passed. Her breath and blood returned, and, intent only on  light, she softly turned. On the instant the rat-faced one raised his eyes, saw her reflected in the mirror, and with an oath, swung toward her. He drew the revolver close to his cheek, and looked at her down the barrel.  Don't move   he whispered;  don t scream  Where arc the jewels   Miss Farrar was not afraid of the re- volver or of the man. She did not believe either would do her harm. The idea of both the present e of the man in her room, and that any one should dare to threaten her was what filled her with repugnance. As the warm blood flowed again through her body her spirit returned. She was no longer afraid. She was, instead, indig- nant, furious. 574 Peace Manoeuvres With one step she was in the room, leaving the road to the door open.   jet out of here,  she commanded. The little man snarled, and stamped the floor. He shoved the gun nearer to her.  The jewels, damn you   he whispered.   Do you want me to blow your fool head off  Where art the jewels    Jewels   repeated Miss Farrar.  1 have no jewels     You lie   shrieked the little man.  He said the house was full of jewels. We heard him. He said he would stay to guard the jewels.  Miss Farrar recognized his error. She remembered Lathrop s jest, and that it had been made while the two men were within hearing, behind the stone wall.  It was a joke   she cried.  Leave at once   She backed swiftly toward the open window that looked upon the road.  Or I ll call your sergeant     If you go near that window or scream,  whispered the rat-like one,  I ll shoot   A heavy voice, speaking suddenly from the doorway, shook Miss Farrar s jangled nerves into fresh panic.  She won t scream,  said the voice. In the door Miss Farrar saw the bulky form of the sergeant, blocking her escape. Without shifting his eyes from Miss Farrar, the man with the gun cursed breathlessly at the other.  Why didn t you keep her away   he panted.  An automobile stopped in front of the gate,  explained the sergeant.  Have you got them   he demanded.  No   returned the other.  Nothing  She won t tell where they are.  The older man laughed.  Oh, yes, she'll tell,  he whispered. His voice was still low and suave, but it carried with it the weight of a threat, and the threat, although unspoken, filled Miss Farrar with alarm. Her eyes, wide with concern, turned fear- fully from one man to the other. The sergeant stretched his hands toward her, the lingers working and making  latches in the air. The look in his eyes was i uite terrifying.   If you don t tell,  he said, slowly,  I'll choke it out of you   If his intention was to frighten the girl, he succeeded admirably. With her hands clasped to her throat. Miss Farrar sank against the wall. She saw no chance of escape. The way to the door was barred, and should she drop to the garden below, from the window, before she could reach the road the men would overtake her. Even should she reach the road, the house nearest was a half mile distant. The sergeant camc close, his fingers opening and closing in front of her eyes. He raised his voice to a harsh, bellowing roar.  I m going to make you tell   he shouted.  I m going to choke it out of you   Although she was alone in the house, al- though on every side the pine woods en- compassed her, Miss Farrar threw all her strength into one long, piercing cry for help. And upon the instant it was answered. From the hall came the swift rush of feet. The rat-like one swung toward it. From his revolver camc a report that shook the room, a flash and a burst of smoke, and through it Miss Farrar saw Lathrop hurl himself. He dived at the rat-like one, and as on the foot-ball field he had been taught to stop a runner, flung his arms around the other's knees. The legs of the man shot from under him, his body cut a half circle through the air, and the part of his anatomy to first touch the floor was his head. The floor was of oak, and the impact gave forth a crash like the smash of a base-ball bat, when it drives the ball to centre field. The man did not move. He did not even groan. In his relaxed fingers the revolver lav, within reach of Lathrop s hands. He fell upon it and, still on his knees, shoved it toward the sergeant.  You re my prisoner, now   he shouted, cheerfully.  Hands up   The man raised his arms slowly, as if he were lifting heavy dumb-bells.  The lady called for help,  he said. I came to help her.  "No  No   protested the girl.  He did not help me  He said he would choke me if I didn t-   He said he would what   bellowed Lathrop. lie leaped to his feet, and sent the gun spinning through the window. He stepped toward the man gingerly, on the balls of his feet, like one walking on ice. I he man seemed to know what that form of approach threatened, for he threw his arms into a position of defence. ou bully   whispered Lathrop.  You coward   ou choke women, do you   Peace Manoeuvres He shifted from one foot to the other, his body balancing forward, his arms swinging limply in front of him. With his eyes, he seemed to undress the man, as though choosing a place to strike.   I made the same mistake you did,  he taunted.   I should have killed you first. Now, I m going to do it   He sprang at the man, his chin still sunk on his chest, but with his arms swinging like the spokes of a wheel. Ilis opponent struck back heavily, violently, but each move of his arm seemed only to open up some vulnerable spot. Blows beat upon his chin, upon his nose, his eyes; blows jabbed him in the ribs, drove his breath from his stomach, ground his teeth to- gether, cut the flesh from his cheeks. He sank to his knees, with his arms clasping his head.   Get up   roared Lathrop.  Stand up to it, you coward   But the man had no idea of standing up to it. Howling with pain, he scrambled toward the door, and fled staggering down the hall. At the same moment the automobile that a few minutes before had passed up the road came limping to the gate, and a half dozen men in uniform sprang out of it. From the window Lathrop saw them spread across the lawn and surround the house.  They ve got him   hesaid. Hepointed to the prostrate figure on the floor.  He and the other one,  he explained, breath- lessly,  are New York crooks  They have been looting in the wake of the Reds, dis- guised as soldiers. I knew they weren t even amateur soldiers by the mistakes in their make-up, and I made that bluff of riding away so as to give them time to show what the game was. Then, that provost guard in the motor car stopped me, and when they said who they were after, I or- dered them back here. But they had a flat tire, and my bicycle beat them.  In his excitement he did not notice that the girl was not listening, that she was very pale, that she was breathing quickly, and trembling.  I'll go tell them,  he added,  that the other one they want is up here.  Miss Farrar s strength instantly returned. With a look of terror at the now groaning figure on the floor, she sprang toward La- throp, with both her hands clutching him by his sleeves.   You will not " she commanded.   You will not leave me alone   Appealingly she raised her face to his startled countenance. With a burst of tears she threw herself into his arms.  I m afraid   she sobbed.  Don t leave me. l lease, no matter what I say, don t ever leave me again   Between bewilderment and joy, the face of Lathrop was unrecognizable. As her words reached him, as he felt the touch of her body in his arms and her warm, wet cheek against his own, he drew a deep sigh of content, an 1 then, fearfully and tenderly, held her close. After a pause, in which peace came to all the world, he raised his head.  Don t worry   he said.  You can ltd I won t leave you   HE CALL OF THE HEART Bv Madison Cawein J Oit, my heart is on the moorland, On the old land, on the poor land, Where it hears the heather calling And the gorse shake with the bee  Oh, it s there I would be lying, With the clouds above me flying, And blue beyond the black-thorn tops A peep of purple sea.

They were impor tant because they were on Andover Road. But in other moods, the charm of the un- known road, the invitation to explore, is the more alluring. To know where a road goes too often accompanies a masterful and ex- clusive desire to get there. Not to know where a road goes and still to take it. means that you are in that blissful state of non- chalance and wonder, so characteristic of the child and so provocative of shy surprises, quiet enjoyments, intimate touch with Nat- ure and her beauties. A country boyhood filled my memory with a background of winding roads, of gray barns and wayside wells, of dark stretches under the pines where the feet crunched softly on brown needles and last week s rain lay in puddles, of cross-way sign-boards and dusty rasp- berries. So, to me, as I explore summer after summer the soft New England coun- tryside t in foot there is a stir of old mem- ory with every new surprise, every present beauty; and the unknown road calls me ir- resistibly, therefor. 1 now have been to Andover  and did not make even the second eleven  . But d  wn the next uncharted by- way may lurk the perfect view of Moosi- lauke, or there may be that not impossible abandoned farm which fills the contradic- tory requirements of the entire family, or only a winding ribbon of dust over a hill which will look like Huckleberry Hill. And just why that will give me so much pleasure 1 cannot tell you: but it will bring me peace, and thoughts of my grandfather, and the re membered fragrance of fresh milk with the dark berries bobbing about in it. Shall we have no pleasure of the road after we have been to Carcasonne   As life advances, the little mysteries loom larger. Perhaps Shakespeare, after he retired to Stratford, ti  ok his greatest interest in his roses, and his morning walk down the garden path was his Great Adventure. The pleasures of the unknown road are many and varied. First among them, of course, is the pleasure of the curve. I have 579 k There is pen around to the mar- zi leepy,  fum' t it on loot, you pause.

And alwavs from Juneto August along unfrequented ways in the Roads 581 north, especially in Franconia, there lurks the possibility of a hermit thrush. Once Stella and I climbed Mt. Agamen- ticus, and as we tumbled down the trail through the woods Stella pealed out the Val- kyries  call, Ho-jo-to-ho  the augmented fifth ringing clear and wild in the stillness of the uplands. Just as we reached the road and she paused for breath, there came an answer from the thicket, sweet and true and without a hint of the Valkyries  wild- ness, yet just now curiously defiant. We laughed, and Stella pealed again. Once more the thrush answered, with his fresh and exquisitely controlled voice. Where have I heard his song likened to an accor- dion going by in the air  This song was not like that. This thrush went up the oc- tave scattering triplets with the measured precision of formal melody written for wood- wind, yet with supreme joy of the grace and spontaneity of the perform- ance Mozart defying Wag- ner.  I give up   cried Stella, and we left the bird trium- phant in his thicket. The unknown road, as it winds along, is a perpetual garden, wild roses, asters, golden-rod, lambkill, Joe-pi- weed, wild raspberry, filling the summer through, not to mention the berries which you eat as well as look at; and now and again in some melancholy cellar hole at the base of a charred brick chim- ney, the llaming fire weed which blooms in the path of desolation. Indeed, a cata- logue of roadsids flowers, even in New England alone, would fill pages. Do you know toad-flax and golden ragweed  not the kind that gives hay-fever     And gold- thread, quaintest of little growing things, and lion s- foot, and wild lettuce  And of climbing things along the way there is always clematis and hemp weed, and often bedstraw, that, overcome with the humbleness of its name perhaps, leans heavily upon other stalks, bearing its white, sdcky, faintly fragrant masses of bloom. But best of all are the red bunch- berries where the pines are near, and the fringed gentians on the up- lands, bits of sky come down to earth. Who needs a garden when he can tramp the roads   And the line of the road, too, is a per- petual revelation of beauty. From a high hill-top it dips with the grace of the curve at the crest of a waterfall, into the woods, and is lost to view. It seems to How away from under your feet. You look out over the trees to a valley, checkered with green past- black spires pointing to the stars. Page 584 ures anti brown squares of ploughed land, with here and there a white house, and sud- denly a mile away you spy your road again, emerging from the woods anti beckoning you up over the next slope. Down in the valley it takes on another aspect. It is the line that carries the eye out of the picture. Shut in by the hill , there would be some- thing a little oppressive about this quiet green bowl but for the friendly mad. That climbs steadily over the slope, laving down its white ribbon between the pastures, and, letting out the eye. lets out the imagination, tells of things beyond. So long as it  grace- ful line breaks over the t rest, you are     n- tent to abide here for a spell, to eat your lunch and chat with the small boy who comes out of the big red bam.

Then it leads us past a square, substantial farm- house. past another and vet another, and suddenly grows narrow, while the tell-tale gra-vs appears between the whccl-ruts. But  ti 11 we hopefully keep tin, up the hill, till without warning the road runs casually into the lmnt door of a farm-house and disap- pears. We go round the house and look for it again, but it is not there; nothing there but chickens, raspberries, and dishwater.  What have you done with the road   we demand of the hoy who comes peering from the wood shed. Fora moment he hesitates. Then a grin breaks over his face.

So we go back, but without anger at the Runaway Road.    ne is never angry at a road. If one takes the wrong road when he really wants to reach a definite place, it is his fault for not asking the way or earning a map. Going back, the roadside vistas are different, seen from the reverse; even the coloring in the foliage, the shadows on the fields, take on a different aspect. Rut the way seems shorter. Landmarks art- familiar, and the eye jumps ahead from one to the other with certainty of the distance. Then, too, the sense of curiosity, the tense mood of expectation, is at rest. So, if the legs are not weary, the ten miles home are always less than the ten miles out. Be- sides, you have made friends with the road, and the walk with a friend is always shorter. I admit that I greet a new road with almost as much pleasure as a new person, and usuallv part from it with rather more regret. The friendly road  Two pictures come back to me, one out of childhood, one out of yesterday. It was night, the deep, starlit, hushed night of the mountain intenales. And I, a little boy, stole aw ay from the buzz of talk on the veranda and scurried up the road, so familiar by day. so sandy, but now curiously smooth and hard under my feet, i Later in life I used to notice that a road the bicycler cursed by day, picking his. path, seemed smooth enough as he bow led along in the dark; which thing Ls a parable.  The black wall of mountains to the left grew 5 3 terribly like a great wave as I ran along, a great wave that seemed I" l e rushing upon me. But I climbed up the hill, comforting myself with a bravado whistle. At the top of the hill the road swept past sentinel cedars,like 1  la  k s nres  ant- ing to the stars, and ran into the woods, so that it soon showed but a ghostly white patch ahead of me. 1 slowed down to a timid walk, my nerves aquiver. Suddenly there was a terrific noise in the darkness side of me. I turned and ran. It was only the stamping of horses in a stable tliat I realized the next day: indeed, I almost knew it then with my head. But my head was not in con- trol. I ran in foolish, un- reasoned terror. I remember how that white, ghostly patch of road gleamed ever ahead of me, with friendly help and comfort. At the sentinel ce- dars 1 again saw the ridge of the mountains. The moon was just coming up behind them, and the firs on their summits were shot with sil- ver, like the foam on a wave--   rest. The illusion of a great breaker curling over upon our valley was    verp nvering. For an instant I stood paralyzed with terror, conquered by my own imagination. Then I saw my friendly white road stretching down to the dis- tant lights of the house. And, with a little crv, I raced madly down it. back to the buzz of talk. The next day the road looked as common- place as before, but ever after it has held a warm spot in my affections, like a human thing. The picture of yesterday is framed by the branches of an apple-tree. There came first a complaint about skirts, wherein our apple-tree differed from the first anil most famous  But once up in the spreading boughs, we gave ourselves over to lazv, happy contemplation of the view, while the lazv afternoons drifted bv. The apple-tree stood in a pasture. East was a stone wall, half hidden in golden-rod and wild-rose bushes. Then the white road swept curving across the picture, from be- hind a little grove to the right, back behind - A mm     -i    vcred ru;id in winter lies through tlie ba  a little hill t   the left. Beyond the road the coast ledges rolled away, covered with bay and huckleberry bushes and scrub pines, till they br  ke against the sky. Only, in the centre, there was a depression filled in by the blue sea. its horizon line laid down with a ruler. Always a speck of white sail moved across that patch of blue, and always at sunset time the sail took lire. Meanwhile traffic flowed around the white ribbon by the wall automobiles with guttural honks, Roads blackboards freighted with boarders, pedes- trians, Indians with packs of sweet-,grass baskets, and finally, as the sail was taking fire, always an old man driving two black cows. Ail this we saw from our apple-tree. trees lovely with the blue shadows of their trunks. while the salt air blew sweetly about us. And when the old man had driven his cows around the hill, we stepped into the white road and it led us cheerfully home to sup- per. How simple it sounds to tell  Vet that road touched our picture as with a gen- tle hand, a hand which held the green and blue beauties of the landscape closely to our human kin and led us home to supper. We loved it like a friend. It is curious, indeed, how closely roads are linked with humanitv. how warmly com- panionable they are, and vet how little they ever mar the beauty, even the wildness, of a picture. That I suppose, is because tliev are made of the earth and follow its con- tours, catch the rhythm and How of nature. A snow- covered road in winter lies through the bare trees lovely with the blue shadows of their trunks, and throws into exquisite relief the straight, slender horizontals of the second-growth saplings, the columnar aisles of the hem- locks. Catch the road in the early morning after a new fall of snow, when the sun is bright above a dazzling world and the chickadees sing and you will find, perhaps the tracks of a single  pung,  blue as the shadows of the tree-trunks. These blue tracks say to you that some fellow has been along ahead, up before you were into the white, frosty world, with the jingle of sleigh-bells. He has left all this beauty of slender horizontals, of columnar hemlocks, of blue shadows on the white carpet, but he has left, too, thanks to the road, a blue trail which jogs you pleasantly to remember your human kin, which keeps Nature linked with Man. After all, lie is rather a mo- rose and stingy lover of nat- ure who would have it other- wise, who would banish roads from his landscape. It was a theorj in the old days that a good road, like a straight line, was the shortest distance between two points. So the    ld Ports- mouth Road goes up Sewall s Hill from York Harbor, and the former road from Rowe to Charlemont in the northern Berk- shires is now but a logging-trail over Mount Adams, where the fringed gentians bloom in the wheel-ruts. Newer roads follow  the lay of the land,  and if you want to tramp in comfort, get a government sur- vey map, find the roads that go straightest It flows with its beautiful line  checkered with shadow, into the woods.

The garden gate is a gap in the stone wall under an apple-tree, and the path lets into a j.....I under a bowlder, a tangle of ferns, and then the blaze of hollyhocks, cosmos, gladioli, and other old-fashioned blooms. The house is deep-brown stucco w ith an Italian roof. Trumpet-vines climb 5S6 over it, and two deep orange awnings shade the door and the ample window of the living- room. Set on a hill, you see over the tree- tops to the new road, the river, and thefar- 1 iff    i lint where t heci ittages face the sea, back yard tou  hing back yard, huddled without privacy together.

Others more fitted have told of that. But has a paper ever been written on roads in literature  Certainly the word  road  would fill pages in a concordance of popu- lar quotations. From the strait and nar- row road of hortatory scripture to that which climbs in Christina Rossetti s  I    Hill,  roads run through what the Race has written, almost always with allegorical pur- pose, a symbol of the eternal restlessness of man, the flow and flight of human aspira- tion, the steady plod of time. Simple, primitive, unmistakable, roads are among the enduring things, and si   wind their way through enduring literature, one of the ulti- mate metaphors. How lull of roads is Bun van s book  And how full of roads, in these latter days, arc the novels and poems of Thomas Hardy. In the open Wessex country they are apparent from afar, and in the novels vmi never lose sight of them, till thev become charged with significance.

In the poems the poet's own quaint illustrations show his preoccupation with roads. Ever they are vanishing over hills, reappearing in distant valleys, ribbon- ing the pastures. He would call them, no doubt, the trail of Man over the face of the earth. Perhaps, then, our joy of the trail depends on our fondness for him who made it. and the road is beautiful, lead it to Car- casonne or Athol, Mass.,in proportion as we are willing to share it, are glad that others have blazed it on ahead, and will follow after.

I  O 0 K III INTERLUDE OF THE RECLUSE PHILOSOPHER 1 NOTABLE difference be- tween the sexes is this, that a man will thrive for years  that is, his better part - upon love denied, and wom- an upon love fulfilled. So Senhouse starved and did well; dreams nourished him in what passes in F.nglantl for solitude. From the gray of the morn- ings to the violet-lidded dusk his silence was rarely broken; and yet the music in his heart was continuous; his routine marched to a rhythm. The real presence of Sanchia was always with him, to intensify, accentu- ate, and make reasonable the perceptions of his quickened senses. Sense blended with sense -as when the sharp fragrance of the thyme which his feet crushed gave him the vision of her immortal beauty, or when, in the ripple of the wind-swept grasses, he had a consciousness of her thrilled heart beating near by. All nature, in fact, was vocal of Sanchia byday; and at night, presently.she stole white-footed down the slant rays of the moon and fed his soul upon exhalations of her own. Idle as he might have appeared to one who did not know the man for be- yond the routine of his handiwork he did nothing visible he was really intensely busy. Out of the stores reaped and gar- nered in those meditative years was to come the substance of his after life. But no man in England may live three years in a grass-valley unreported; his fame will spread abroad, scattered as birds sow seeds. Discreetly as he lived and little as he fared, he was at first a thing of doubt and suspicion, and won respect by slow degrees. Was he a coiner, stirring alloys over his night-fires  Was lie Antichrist blasphem- Voi.. XLVII. 60 ing the Trinityat daybreak   lie was talked of by gaitered farmers at sheep-fairs, by teamsters at cross-roads, by maidens and their sweethearts on Sundays. The shep- herds, it was thought, might have told more than they did. It was understood that they had caught him athissecretstimeandagain. But the shepherds had little to say of him but that he was a mellow man, knowing sheep and weather, and not imparting all that he knew. Similarly the gypsies, who alone travel the Race-plain in these days, and mostly by night, were believed to know him well; but they, too, kept their lore with- in the limits of their own shifty realm. Rarely, indeed, he was seen. Sunday lovers, strolling hand in hand up the valley, came to a point where they went tiptoe and peered about for him. lie might be de- scried motionless, folded in his white robe, midway between ridge and hollow; or a gleam of him Hashed between the trees would perhaps be all that they would get for an hour of watching. The brows would on such days be lined with patient onlook- ers; all eyes would be up the narrow valley to its head under Hirlebury, where, below the little wood, his gray hut could be seen, deep-eaved, mysterious, blankly holding its secrets behind empty windows. None ever ventured to explore at close quarters; and if the tenant had appeared, a thousand to one they would all have looked the other way. The Wiltshire peasant is a gentle- man from the heart outwards. So, too, carters, ploughmen, reapers in the vales would sometimes see his gaunt figure mon- strous on the skv-line, cowled and with up- lifted arms, adoring  it was supposed  the sun, or leaning on his staff, motionless and rapt, meditating death and mutability. He lost nothing by such chance apparitions; on 589 Rest 11 arrow the contrary, he gained the name of a wise man who had powers of divination and heal- ing. In the cottage whither he went once a week for bread, a child had been sick of a burning fever. His hands, averred the mother, had cured it. Groping and mak- ing passes over its stomach, rubbing in oils, relief had come, then quiet sleep and a cool forehead. After this, an old man, crippled with rheumatics, had hobbled up to the very edge of his dominion, and had waited shaking there upon his staff until he could get speech with the white stranger. He, too, had had the reward of his belief. If he was not made sound again, he was relieved and heartened. He had said that, if he was spared, he could stretch to his height again, which had been six feet all butaninch. The stranger, said he, had put him in the way of new life, and whatever he meant whether that he were a Salvationist or a quack doc- tor he would say no more. After that, a young woman went to him to get him to name the father of her child, and returned, and was modest for a month, and a good mother when the time came. And true it was that her   hap came forward and saw the vicar about it, and they were asked in   hun h. Out of such things as these his fame grew. The hunt struck upon him now and again when the hounds in full cry streamed down his steep escarpments and threatened panic t   his browsing goats. At such times he would rise up, white-robed and calm, and stay with a quiet gesture the scattering beasts. The whips would cap him. andthe master with his held find themselves in com- pany of an equal. For his ease of manner never left him, nor that persuasive smile which made you think that the sun was come out. He had none of the airs of a mystagogue, but talked to men, as he did to beasts, in the spcei Ii which was habitual to them. The lagging fox understood him when,grinning his fear and fatigue, hedrew himself painfully through the furze. So did the hounds, athirst for his blood. Buck- skinned gentlemen, no less, found him affable and full of information about any- thing and everything in the world except the line of the hunted fox.  Oh, come,  he said on  e,  don t ask me to give him awav. You re fifty to one. to start with; and the fact is 1 passed him my word that I wouldn t. I ll tell you what, though. You shall offer me a cigarette. I haven't smoked for six months.  Which was done. His powers with children, his charm for them, liis influence and fascination, which in course of time made him famous beyond these shores, arose out of a chance encoun- ter not far from his hut. Three boys, breaking school in the nesting season, came suddenly upon him, and paled, and stood rooted.  Come on,  he said,  I ll show you a thing or two that you ve never seen before.  He led them to places of marvel, which his speech made to glimmer with the hues of romance: the fresh-grubbed earth where a badger had been routing, the quiet glade where, that morning, a polecat had washed her face. He brought them up to a vixen and her cubs, and got them all play- ing together. He let them hold leverets in their arms, milk his goats, as the kids milk them for their need: and showed them so much of the ways of birds that they forgot, while they were under the spell of him, to take any of their eggs. Crowning wonder of all when a peewit, waiting on the down, dipped and circled about his head for a while and finally perched   n his shoulder while he stood looking down upon her eggs in the bents  Such deeds as these flv broad- cast over the villages, and on Saturdays he would be attended by a score of urchins, boys and girls. To a gamekeeper who came out after his lad, sapling-ash in hand, he had that to say which convinced the man of his authority.    A says to me,   There s a covey of ten in thickv holler,  where you could see neither land nor bird.  I allow  tis ten,  lie says,  but we won t be partickler to a chick.  There was nine, if you credit me, that rose out of a kind of a dimple in the down, that you couldn t see, and no man could see.  Lord love you,  I said,  Mr. John, how ever did you see  em    He looks at me. and he says, very quiet,  I never saw the birds, nor knew they was there. 1 saw the air. There s wav es in this air,  lie says,' wrinkled waves; and they birds stirred  em, like stones flung into a pond. Tom, he says, to my Pom,  if you look as close as I do,  he says,  you ll see what I see.  And young Tom looks up at him, as a dog might, kind ol faithful, and he says,  I  low I will,sir, please, sir.  1 says to him,   Can a man be taught the like o  that    No,  says he,   but a boy can.    What more could  thick Rest Harrow r 91 boy learn   I says, and lie says,  To under- stand his betters, and get great words, and do without a sight of things  for the more you do without,  he says,   the more you have to deal with.   Such things as what, now, would he do without   1 wants to know. He looks at me.  Food,  he says, kind of sharp;  food when he s hungry, and   loth- ing, and a bed; and money, and the respect of them that don t know anything, and other men s learning, and things he don't make for himself.  Heard anv man ever the like o  that  But just you bide till I ve done.  Can a boy learn to do without drink   1 wants to know for beer's been my downfall.  He can,  says thick man.  And love   I says; and  No,  says he straight,4 he cannot. But he cun learn the way of it; and that  nil teach him to do wi out lust.   Tis a wise thought, the like of that, 1 allow.  The gamekeeper paused for the mur- murs of his auditory to circle about the tap- room, swell and subside, and then brought out his conclusion. There was book-learn- ing to be faced. How about sc holarship    I'd give him none,  says the man. ' Swal- lerin  comes by nature, and through more than the mouth. I d open his eyes and ears, his fingers and toes, and the very hairs on the back of his hands, and they ll all swal- ler in time, like the parts of the beastes do.' Now, that s a learned man, I allow. My boy must go to the Council School, it does appear; but thick man will give him more teaching in a week than school- master in a year and there he goes o  Saturdays and wants no driving, more- over.  He returned to his beer, thoughtful- eyed. The gamekeeper s son was twelve years old, and was the nucleus round which grew the Senhusian school of a later day, where neither reading nor writing could be had until the pupil was fifteen years old. But this is anticipatory, for the school was a matter of long gestation and tentative birth. II Oxe September midnight, as he stirred a late supper over a small wood-fire. he was hailed by a cry from above,   Ho, you  1 ask shelter,  he was adjured. The quarter- moon showed him a slim figure dark against the sky. " Come dow n, and you shall have it,  lie answered, and continued to skim his broth. The descent was painfully made, and it was long before the traveller stood blinking by his lire a gaunt and hollow-eyed lad. Senhouse took him in at a glance, stained, out-at-elbows with the world, nursing a grudge, footsore and heartsore. He had a gypsy look,and yet had not a gypsy serenity. That is a race that is never angry at random, and never bitter at large. A gypsy will want a man s life; but if the man is not be- fore him, w ill be content to w ait until he is. But this wanderer seemed to have a quarrel with time and place, that they held not his enemy by the gullet.   You travel late, my friend,  said Sen- house briskly. " I travel by night," said the stranger, "lest I should be seen by men or the sun.  Senhouse laughed. '     giriwi imus noctu, non ul consitmhnur igiti.' They used to say that of the devils once upon a time.  "My devil rides on my back,  said the stranger,   and t arries with him the fire that roasts me.  He was at once bitter and sententious. Senhouse put dow n his hurts to bruises of the self-esteem. " I hope that you dropped him upabove,  he said cheerfully, "or that you will let me exorcise him. I've tried my hand with most kinds of devil. Are you a Roman     Half,  he was told, and, guessing w hich half, asked no more questions.   You are pretty well done, I can see,  he said.  You want more than food. You want warm water, and a bed, and a dress- ing for voiir feet. You ve been on the road too long.  The stranger was huddled by the tire, probing his wounded feet.  I'm cut to pieces,  he said.   I ve been over stubbles and flint. This is a cruel country.    It's the sweetest in the world,  Senhouse told him,  when you know your way about it. W hen you have the hang of it you need not touch the roads. You smell out the hedgerows, and every hill-pasture leads you out on to the grass. But I'll own that there are thistles. I wear sandals myself. Now,  he continued, ladling out of his pot with a wooden spoon,  here s your porridge, and there are bread and salt; and here water, and here goats  milk. Afterwards you shall have a pipe of tobacco and some tea. Best Rest 11 arrow begin while all s hut and while you eat 1 11 look to voiir wounds. Finally, you shall be washed and clothed.  He went away, returning presently with water and a napkin. Kneeling, he bathed his guest's feet, wiped them, anointed, then wrapped them up in the napkin. Thedis-   onsolate one, meantime, was supping like a wolf. He gulped at his porridge with quick snaps, tore his bread with his teeth. Senhouse gave him time, quietly eating his own supper, watching the red gleam die down in the poor wretch s eyes. Being himself a spare feeder, he w as soon done, and at further business of hospitality. He set a great pipkin of water to heat, brought out a clean robe of w hite wool, a jclab like his own, and made some tea. The stranger, then, being filled, cleansed, and in warm raiment, stretched himself be- fore the tire, and broke silence. He was 'till surly, but the grudge was not audible in his voice.  1 took your tire for a gypsy camp, and was glad enough of it. I ve come by the hills from Winterslow since dusk. You were right, though: 1 was done. I couldn t have dragged another furlong.  Senhouse nodded.  I thought not. Been long on the road    Two months.    From the north, I think   From York- shire    The stranger grunted his replies. Ilis host judged that lie had reasons for his reti- cence. There was a pause.  You sup late   was then observed. Senhouse replied:  I generally do.   take two meals a day the lirst at noon, the second at midnight; but I believe that 1 could do without one of them. 1 never w as much of an eater -and I need very little sleep. Somehow, although 1 am out at sun- rise most mornings. I rarely sleep till two or thereabouts. Four hours are enough for me and in the summer much less. Some- times, when the lit is on me. 1 roam all night long, and come luu k and do my routine  and then sleep where 1 am, or mav be. Precisians would grow mad at such a life  and yet I m awfully healthy.  The stranger watched him.  You live here, then and so   "I have lived here," said Senhouse,  for three years or more; but I ve lived so for over twenty. I ve wandered for most of that time, and know England from end to end; but now I seem to have got into a backwater, and I find that I travel further, and see more, than 1 did when I was hardly for a week together in the same place. But that s reasonable enough, if you think of it. If you can do w ithout time, space goes with it. If it don t matter when you are, it don t matter where.  The stranger lent this reasoning his gloomy meditation, w hich turned it inward to himself and his rueful history.   I don t follow you, 1 believe,  he said,  for verj good reason. 1 hope you w ill never learn as 1 have that it does matter where you are.  He .stopped, then added, as if the admission waswrung out of him,   I ve been in prison.   So have I,  said Senhouse,  and in Si- beria at that. I was there for more than a year, though not all that time within walls. They let me loose when they found that I could be trusted, and I learned botany, and caught a marsh fever which nearly finished me. They wouldn t have me in after that, being quite content that I should rot in the open. I was succoured by a woman, one of th ose noble creatures who are made to give themselves. She gave me what blood she had left. God bless her: she blessed me.   It was a woman," said the stranger,  that sent me to prison.  Senhouse, after looking him over, calmly replied: "I don t believe you. You mean, I think, that there was a woman, and you W ent to prison. You confuse her and your feelings about her. It is natural, but not very line-mannered. No woman would have put the thing as you have put it to me.  The stranger shifted two or three times under his host s quiet regard; presently he said:  This is the tale in a nutshell. She w as beautiful, and kind to me; she was in a hateful place, and I loved her and she knew it. There was a man with claims  rights he had none preposterous claims, made infamous by his acts. The position was impossible, intolerable. She knew it, but did nothing. Women are like that  endlessly enduring; but men are not. I dragged him off a horse and thrashed him. He had me to gaol, and she went her ways, leaving a note for me, hoping 1 should do well. Dowell  Much she cares what I do. Much tare I.  He ended with a sob which was like the cough of a wolf at night, and then turned his face away.

If she was to be degraded, as you c all it, bv whom was she degraded  But you talk there a language which 1 don t understand.

You can t claw her soul, or blac ken the edges of that.   ou c an t sell that into pros titution or worse.

The young man now turned his trapped and wretched face to the speaker. " You little know   he began, then for weakness stopped.  I can t quarrel with you; wait till I ve had a night s rest.     You shall have it, and welcome,  said Senhouse.  But you ll never quarrel with me. I believe that I ve got beyond that way of enforcing arguments, which I fear may be unsound. I doubt if 1 have quar- relled with anybody for tw enty years."  There are some things which no man can stand,  said the other,  and that was one. Your talk of the soul is very line; but do you say  that you don't love a woman's body as well as her soul  " Senhouse was silent for a while; then he said: " No I can t sav that. You have me there. I ought to, but I can t. And I think I owe you an apology for my heat, lor the fact is that I ve been in much of your position myself. There' was a man once upon a time that 1 felt like thrashing for much of your reason. But I didn t do it  for what seemed to me unanswerable rea- son. I did precisely the opposite I  1 i  1 everything I could to ensure a miserable marriage for the being I loved best in all the world. I loathed the man, 1 loathed the bondage: but that's what I did. Now mark what follows. 1 didn t I couldn t  degrade her; but I saw myself dragging like a worm in the mud while she soared out of my reach. And there I ve been of the slime slimy ever since.    here she is now I don t know, but I think in heaven. Heaven lay in her eyes and w henever I look at the sky at night I see her there.    You are talking above my head,  said the stranger, "or above your own. Hither 1 am a fool, or you a madman. You love a woman, and give her to another man. You love her, and secure her in slavery. You love her, and don t want her "   It is I that am the fool, not you,  said Senhouse. " I do want her. I want nothing else in earth or heaven. And vet I know that I have her forever. Our souls have touched each other. She is mine and I am hers.  nd yet I want her.

She was like ivory under the moon. She laughed rarely, but her voice was low and thrilled.  " Her breath," Senhouse continued,   was like the scent of bean-flowers. She sweet- ened the earth. Ii is true that she laughed seldom, but when she did the sun shone from behind a cloud. When she was silent you could hear her heart beat. She was deliberate, measured, in all that she did  yet her spirit w as as swift as the south-west wind. She did nothing that was not lovely, and never faltered in what she purposed. When first I came to know her and see the workings of her noble mind, I was so happy in the mere thought of her that I sang all dav as I worked or walked. It never en- tered me for one minute that I could desire anything but the knowledge of her.    I wanted my mistress altogether," the other broke in,  from the first moment to the last  fool, and wicked fool, as you may think me. I could see her bosom stir her gown I could see the lines of her as she walked. She was kind to me, I tell you, and there were times w hen alone with her   in her melting mood in the wildness of my passion but no  something held me: I never dared touch her..... nd then he -the other came back; he, with his  claims  and  rights ; and the thought of Rest Harrow him. and what he could do and did do  made me blind. You tell me that I sinned against her-  "1 don t,  said Senhouse. "I tell you that you sinned against love. You don t know what love is.     You sav so. Maybe you know nothing about it. If you have reduced yourself to be contented with the soul of a woman, 1 have n  t. What have I to do with the soul     Evidently nothing,  said Senhouse. "How, prav, do you undertake to appre- hend body's beauty unless you discern the soul in it -on which it shapes its beauty.-'  "1 know,  the other replied,  that she has a lovely body, and gracious, free-mov- ing ways; and I could have inferred her soul from them. I'll engage that you did the same thing. How are you to judge of the soul but by the hints which the body affords you    Senhouse made no answer, but remained musing. W hen he spoke it was as if lie was resuming a tale half told. . . . "She was in white white as a cloud  and in a wood. Her hair reflected gold of the sun. She pinned her skirls about her waist, and put her bare foot into a pool of black water. She sank in it to the knee. She did not falter; her eyes were steady upon what she did." The stranger took him up where he stopped, and continued the tale. "She could never falter in her purpose. She bared herself to the thighs. She went into the pool thigh-deep. W hiter than the lilies which she went to save, she raked the weed from them you helping her.    She did,  said Senhouse, his eves search- ing the lire.

In the same breath with which I spurned myself for having a mo- ment s fear for her, I thanked God for hav- ing let me witness her action.  The rebuke was accepted, not because it was felt to be justified; but rather, ii passed unheeded. The stranger had questions to I_    Knowing her. loving her loveworthy as she was how could vou leave her    1 beg your pardon,  said Senhouse,  I have never left her.  But in the next breath he had to qualify his paradox. He spoke vehemently.   I had of her all that I dared have. That has never left me' I had all that she could give me she that was self-sufficing, not to be imparted. She did not love me, as you could understand love: 1 don t think she could love anybody. But I only could read her thoughts and grasp her troubles for her. She was at case with me, let me write to her, was glad to see me when I came, but perfectly able to do without me. She was, of course, not human; she inhabited elsewhere. Her ' soul was like a star and dwelt apart.  She remembered things as they had been, yet not as affecting her to pleasure or pain; she remembered them as a tale that is told, as things witnessed. So she remembered me -and so she still does. If I was there.with her, she was glad; if 1 was not there, she wasn t sorry. I was nothing to her but a momentary solace and I knew it and taught nivself to be contented. 1 believe that she was the spirit of immortal youth fleeting over the world. I called her Hym- nia.

Bless you  if I had never lived, she would have acted as she did, because she was incapable ol seeing evil, incapable of at ting against her heart. Well  and the thing was done and I had to face it.

My answer to you is simple. I have all of her of which 1 am capable. 1 have never left her because she has never left me. . . .   I wrote out my heart in my first years   f knowing her; but since then I have gone under the harrow of this world, where there can be no singing. Now that I am at peace my voice has come back. I listen to what she tells me, and note it. Like Dante, vo signifirando, 1 am a drain pipe for her spirit. She was Ilymnia to me once, and I sang of Open Country; now she is Despoina.

I must lie folded in that immensity, drown and sink in it, till it and I arc one. I must be rc- sumed into the divine energy whose appear ante is but a broken hint of it.

Her form, her glow, her eager, lovely breath, are her soul put into speech for us to read. You might say that her nobility was that of the Jungfrau on a night of stars. So her body s beauty is but a poem written by God about her soul." Glyde sat up and looketl at him at ross the fire.  I know you. There is but tine man who has loved her as you do. You are her poet. You are Senhouse.  Senhouse nodded.  That is my name. You know her, then   His face glowed darkly.  You have known her you "  I saw her four months ago. i was in servitude in a house where she too was made a servant. For her sake, 1 tell you again, I downed Ingram." Senhouse said sharply:  Ii was for your own. You aren t fit to talk about her. You have urn lean lips. You don't hurt her. for you cannot. You hurt yourself infinitely.    hy. a dog would do as vou did, and pos- sibly be right; but you, not being a dog, have broken vour own rules. You have trodden on your own honor, and, like the dull fool that you are, come out wrapped in your silly self-esteem as if it was a flag. I w ish that you could see yourself as I sec you   or rather, I hope that you never raav: for il you did, you would see no reason to live." The words, frozen with scorn, cut like hail- stones. The guest cowered, with the whip about his face. Senhouse rose. " Follow me," he said. Glyde also rose to his feet, and. as if he was giddy, looketl blankly about him. He groaned,      God, what have I done     God, what am I   He dashed his hand over his eyes. " 1 can t see, I suppose I never could.   He turned upon Senhouse. " You  Why do vou harbor such a rat as I    Senhouse gav e him pitiful eyes. " If you think yourself rat, you are in the Way to be more. Come, we ll be friends yet. You re near the end of your tether. 1 think. Let me tuck you into a blanket.  Ill In the morning   llyde, in a humble mood, drank quantities of small beer. In other words, he told his story of Sanchia, of In- gram, anti of Mrs. Wilmot. He was so steered by questions from Senhouse that lie came, towards the end, to see that if anyone had driven his mistress into a life of bondage to Ingram it was himself and his presump- tuous arm.   You must have offended her beyond ex- pression.  he was told. "First, her fine esteem in her own spotless robe, which you have smeared with beastly blood and heat; next, her sense of reason clear as day: next, and worst, her logical faculty by which she sees it to be a law of the earth that nothing can be bought without a price.    h, you precious young donkey  And who the mis- chief arc you. prav, to meddle in the affairs of high ladies you, who can t manage your 59b Rest Harrow- own better than to do with your foolish muscles what is the work of a man s heart   Love  You don t know how to spell the word.

I mean whom I say your mistress and mine. You are not fit to name her by any other name.   No, no I know it,  said the youth    but her name is so beautiful.   Everything about her is beautiful,  said Senhouse,  therefore see that you go to her cleansed and sweetened. Now. when you have found her you shall beg her pardon on your knees-   ' Never    said  Hyde, grittilv in his teeth.   On your heart s knees, you fool,  cried Senhouse, with a roar which rolled about the hills.  On the knees of your rat's heart. You shall beg her pardon on your knees for your beastly interference, presumption, mulishness, and graceless manhood; and then you shall leave her immediately, and thank God for the breath of her forgiveness. This also is important. You are not to name me who have sent you.  His eyes shone with the gleam of tears.  Never name me to her. young Clyde, for I ll tell you now that for every stripe I ve dusted your jacket with you owe me forty and you can lay on when you please.  For I,  he continued, after a pause for breath, while  Jlyde stared fearfully upon him,  for I, too, have betrayed her.  They said no more at that time, but all day Glyde followed Senhouse about like a dog. In the evening of what to the undrilled youth was a hard-spent day, Senhouse un- folded his heart and talked long and elo- quently of love and other mysteries of our immortal life.   The attainment of our desires,  he said,   appears to every one of us to be a Law of Nature, and so, no doubt, it is. But that is equally valid which says,  To every man that which he is lit to enjoy.  The task of men is to reconcile the two. That once done, you are whole nay, you are holy.  I believe that 1 am in the way of that salvation, look you, for I know now that there is hardly a thing upon the earth which 1 c annot do without. That being so, and all things of equal value, or of no value, I have them all. They are at the disposal of that part of myself which enters no markets and c annot be c haltered away. Wind, rain, and sun have bleached me; dinners of herbs have reduced my tlesh to obedience; incessant toil, with meditation under the stars, has driven my thoughts along chan- nels graved deep by patient plodding of the field. 1 am become one with Nature. I have watched the wheeling of the seasons until, to escape vertigo, I picture myself as a fixed point, and see the spheres in their courses revolve about me.  Mystic sayings, aphorisms, oozed from him like resin from a pine.   It is error to suppose that discomfort is holy. I Ioliness is harmony. Men have lost sight of the sanctity of the body. Rightly considered, indigestion is a great sin.  Passion, which is a state of becoming, is not holy, for holiness is a state of being. Hut it is noble, because it is a straining after appeasement which is a harmony.   Man is an ape, or a god, but certainly a god in this, that he can make himself either. It is by no means certain, however, that this potentiality is not also possessed by the ape.   Appeasement of passion is fulfilment of our being, which out of ferment makes wine, through riot seeks rest.  He was not always so transcendental. Here we have him closer to the matter.  A woman when she loves is a seraph winged. When she does not, she is a chrys- alis, a husk, ora shell. In love, she follows the man, but appears to fly him, as a shep- herd goes before the sheep he is really driv- ing.   Hit of it, she is an empty vase, to be revered by us for the sacred wine which she may hold, as a priest handles fearfully the chalice.   She has but one law, the law of her love, which says to her,   live, give, give. See here how she differs from the man, to whom love is but one of many healthy appetites  not a divine mission. Love, hunger, hunt- ing, or a taste tor picture-dealing, says to him,  Take, take.    et it is no wonder that the sexes go in fear of each other, each a mystery to each. For my part, I have never been close to a ""man without a desire to cover my eves.  Rest 1  arrow 5  17 And here lie gut level with her, and showed her radiant beside him.  A young woman with shining eyes, blown-back hair, and face on fire, holding out her heart from the threshold, stretching it out at arms  length, crying,  Who will take this  To whom may I give it    A vision here of Heaven s core of light. I have seen it. I, Senhouse, have seen the Holy Grail.  She stood with me upon the threshold of the world, just so, with blown-back hair and shining eyes. Blessed one, blessed prodigal  She poured out her heart like water for a dog to lap. He was dog- headed, full in the eye, a rich feeder. She decked him with the fair garlands of her thoughts, she made him glisten with her holy oils. She crowned him with starry beams from her eyes, she sweetened him with the breath of her pure prayers. She tobed him in white and scarlet, for Ik- was wrapped in her soul and sprinkled with her passion. And she said:  1 love a Divine Person. 1 am ready to die for him. Make haste. Pile the tire, sharpen the knife; bind me with cords, and drive deep. I die that he may live.  O Gods, and Sanchia gave herself for Nevile Ingram   On a later day he read a poem to his guest which he called  The Song of Gaia.  Bv this name, it seems, he also fig- ured Sanchia, whose synonyms threatened to be as many as those of Artemis or the V irgin Mary. From poring for signs of her in the face of earth he was come to see little else, if the west wind was her breath and the hills were her breasts, it needed a mys- tic to see them so; and he was become a mystic. A glorified and non-natural San- chia pervaded the poem, which, for the form, was a barbaric, rough-hewn chant, stuffed with words and great phrases which had the effect rather of making music in the hearer than of containing it in themselves. It was poetry by hints, perpetually moving, initiating lyrical phrases, then breaking off and leaving you with a melody in your ears which your brain could not render. Either the poet was inchoate or the subtlest musi- cian of our day. He said of himself that he was a drain pipe for the Spirit a dark say- ing to Glyde, who was himself, we have heard, something of a poet, of the Bvronii tradition. The youth was extremely inter ested, though seldom moved. He was for- ever on the point to drink, and had the cup snatched away. Senhouse tormented you with possibilities of bliss where sight merges in sound, and both lift together into a triumphant sweep of motion whirled you, as it were, to the gates of dawn, showed you the amber glories of preparation, thrilled you with the throb of suspense; then, be- hold  coursing vapors and gathering clouds blot out the miracle and you end in the clash of thunder-storms and dissonances. Something of this the listener had to urge. Senhouse admitted it, but he said:  You know that the splendor is enacting behind  You guess the opening of the Rose.    ne  talks this earth agog for miracles. It is full of hints you catch a moment for Hashed instants you are God. Then the mist wraps you, and you blunder forward, two-legged man swaying for a balance. Translate the oracle as you will with your paint-pans, with your words we get broken lights, half-phrases. But we guess the rest - and so we strain and grow. Who are you or I, that we should know her   He stuffed the pages into the breast of his jelab, and sat brooding over the paling fire for a while; then, by an abrupt transition, lie said: " A fatal inclination for instructing the young was, perhaps, my undoings 1 believe that I am a prig to the very fibres of me. If I had kept my didactics for my own sex, all might have gone well: 1 have never doubted but that I had things to teach mv generation which it would be the happier of knowing. But it s a dangerous power to put into a man's hands that he shall in- struct his betters. I was tempted by that deadliest llattery of all. and i fell. Des- poina heard me, smiled at me, and went her way regardlessly; but my poor Mary was a victim. She heard me, and took it seriouslv. She thought me a man of God. I failed ab- solutely, and so badly that by rights I ought never to have held up my head again. But she is happy, dear little soul, after her own peculiar fashion which she never could have been with me. She writes to me now and then. The man is her master, but not a bad one. She knows it, and glories in him. Isn t that extraordinary     Not at all,  Glyde said, who knew noth ing of Mary.   It s a law of Nature. The woman follows the man. 1 suppose vou treated her as an equal     598 Rest Harrow  No, as a superior, which she plainly was,  said Senhouse.  Then,  Glyde said, looking at him,   then you made her so. If you fly against Nature, you must get the worst of it.  He waited, then asked,  It s against your principles to marry a woman, no doubt.   Quite,  Senhouse said.  It seems to me an insult to propose it to her.    Your Mary didn t think so.   She did at first; but she couldn t get used to it.   She felt naked without the ring  And ashamed     God help me,  said Senhouse,  that s true. The moment I realized what had happened, I gave in.   And then she refused     She neither accepted nor refused. She lived apart. We were in Germany at the time. I was naturalizing plants for the Grand Duke of Baden tilling the rocks and glades in the Black Forest. She went into a hotel in Donaueschingen, and I went to see her every day. We were friends. Then we went to England, to London. She held to that way of life, and 1 did the best I could for myself. At any moment I would have taken her. I considered myself bound in every way. I could have been happy with her. She had great charm for me  great physical charm, I mean and sweet, affectionate ways. I could have made her a wife and a mother.   I intended her the highest honor I could show to a woman. To make her your property by legal process and the sanction of custom seems to me like sacrilege. But, however  One day she told me that a former lover of hers wanted to marry her, anil left it for me to judge. She wouldn t say whether she wished it herself or not; but 1 knew that she did, for when I advised her to accept him, she got up and put her arms round my neck and kissed both my cheeks. I was her elder brother, I perceived, and said so. She laughed, and owned to it. And yet she had loved me, you know. She had refused that same man for me. She was afraid of him, and gave me her hand be- fore his face.    That to me,  Glyde said,   is proof posi- tive that she loved him. Of course she feared him. It is obvious. My poor master    Senhouse serenely replied:   She s happy, and I ve done her no harm at all. But it s impossible for me to treat any living creat- ure otherwise than as my better.   I believe you,  said Glyde,  and so it may be in a rarer world than this. In this world, however, a man is the most cunning animal, and in that both are flesh he is the stronger of the sexes. In this world the law is that the woman follows the man.  He thought before he spoke, then added,  That applies all this world over. You will marry Sanchia.  Senhouse would not look up. He sat, nursing one leg. He bent his brows, and a hot flush made his skin shine in the firelight. IV Thf. poet and his disciple continued their partnership through the sogging rains of Christmas, well into the chill opening of the new year. Then came the snow to till up the valley in which stood the hut, and blur the outlines of the folded hills. Poetry and Sanchia drew together a pair who could have little in common. But Glyde became the slave of the strange man who blended austerity with charitable judgment, and appeased his passion by blood from his heart. He was not himself a mystic, but a sensitive youth whom the world s rubs had taught the uses of a thick hide. Either you have that by nature, or you earn it by practice. Glyde had found out that the less you say to your maltreaters the less, in time, you have to say about it to yourself. He was conscious of his parts and all too ready to be arrogant. Senhouse s goddess had been kind to him, and he had presumed upon that. Senhousc s own method was to alternate extreme friendli- ness with torrential contempt. He knocked Glyde down and picked him up again with the same hand. He treated him as his equal whenever he was not considering him a worm. There is no better way of gaining the confidence of a youth of his sort. At the end of a fortnight there was nothing  Hyde would not have told him; at the end of six months he would have crossed Europe barefoot to serve him. He was nothing of a mystic, and there- fore had his own ideas of what seemed to afford his master so much satisfaction ; he was enough of a poet to be sure that Sen- house's romantic raptures were only a Rest 11 arrow 5  10 makeshift at best. To his mind here was a man aching for a woman. He thought that the poet sang to ease his bleeding heart. He came to picture the mating of these two  Sanehia the salient, beautiful woman and his master of the clear, long-enduring, searching eyes, and that strange look of second-sight upon him which those only have who live apart from men, under the sky. It is a look you can never mistake. Sailors have it, and shepherds, and dwellers in the desert. The eye sees through you  into you, and beyond you. It is almost im- possible for any person to be either so ar- resting in himself or possessed of such utter- ance as will cause the weathered eye to check its scanning of distance and concen- trate upon an immediate presence. To such an eye, communing with infinite and eternal things, no creature of time and space can interpose solidly. Each must be vain ard clear as bubbles of air. Behind it float spirits invisible to other men essential forms, of whose company the seer into dis tance really is. He will neither heed you nor hear you: his conversation is otherwhere. And what would Senhouse do confronted with Sanehia  Would lie look beyond her, at some horizon where she could never stand  Or would he not see in her blue eyes the goal of all his searching the con- tent of his own   What would he say but   You   and take her  What she blit sigh her content to be taken   Appeasement is holiness, says Senhouse. And what of their holy life thereafter, breast to breast, fronting the dawn   Glyde s heart, purged of his dishonesty, beat at the thought. He turned all his erotic over to the more gener- ous emotion, and faced with glowing blood the picture of the woman he had coveted in the arms of the master he avowed. When February began to show a hint of spring, in pairing plovers and breaking eglantine, Senhouse, in a temporary dejec- tion, ceased work upon his poem, and  dvde said that he must know the news. All through the winter they had had little com- munication with the world beyond their gates. A shepherd homing from the folds, a sodden tinker and his drab, whom he touchingly cherished, a party of rabbit- shooters beating the furze-bushes, had been all their hold upon a life where men meet and hoodwink each other. Once in a week one of them ploughed through the drifts to the cottage at the foot of the third valley, and got as he needed flour and candles, soap or matches. It had not yet occurred to either of them to Senhouse it never did occur to beg the sight of a newspaper. But St. Valentine's call stirred the deeps of Glyde, who now said that he must have news. He departed for Sarum and stayed away until March was in. He returned with certain information, ab- sorbed by Senhouse with far-sighted, patient eyes and in silence. The only indication he afforded was inscrutable. His cheek-bones twitched, flickeringly, like summer light- ning about the hills. Sanehia, Glyde said, was well and in London. She was living in a street off Berkeley Square, with an old lady who wore side-curls and shawls and drove out every afternoon in a barouche, with two stout horses and two lean men-servants. San- cliia sometimes accompanied her, stiff and pliant at once, bright-eyed and faintly col- ored. She was taken about to parties also, and to the opera and very often there were parties at the old lady s house: carriage- company, and gentlemen in furred coats, who came in hansom cabs. He thought that she had suitors. There was a tall, thin man who came very often in the afternoons. He was sallow and melancholy, and wore a silk muffler day and night. Glyde thought that he was a foreigner, perhaps a Hun- garian or Pole. He had seen Sanehia often, but she could not have caught a glimpse of him. He ad- mitted that he had haunted the house, had seen her come out and go in, knew when she dressed for dinner and when she went to bed. Long practice had acquainted him with the significance of light and darkness seen through chinks in shutters.   I know her room,  he said,  and the times of her lights. She looks out over the streets towards the park twice every night. Once when she is dressed, and once before she goes to bed. It is as if she is saying her prayers. She looks long to the West, very seriously. T think her lips move. I believe that she always does it.-  Senhouse, who may have been listening, bowed his head to his knees, below his clasped hands.  Twice she looked full at me without knowing me. Why should she know me now  Her pale and serious face, master, wras as beautiful as the winter moon, as How Annandale Went Out remote from us and our little affairs. No words of mine can express to you the out- ward splendor of her neck and bosom. She was uncovered fora party at the house. In the morning she came out to walk. You know her way, how she glides rather than seems to m  ve her feet: the oaring, even m   - tion of a sea-bird. She walked across the park, and I followed, praising God whose image she is.    n the further hill the Pole met her in his furs, and she walked with him for an hour in the sun. She had no wrap- page to hide her blissful shape. Close- lit ted, erect, free-moving, gracious as a young birch-tree. Master, she is the Holy One.    You played Peeping Tom, my ingenu- ous young friend,  said Senhouse, who was fastidious in such matters. But Glyde cried out:   God forbid  Are you prying when you look at the sun  Master, you need not grudge the Pole. He is nothing.  1 grudge no man anything he can get of her,  said Senhouse.  He will get pre- cisely what lies within his scope.    He has the eyes of a rat,"  Hyde said. Senhouse answered:   Rats and men alike seek their meat of the earth. And the rats get rat-food. and the men man's food. Gaia s breasts are very large." He turned to his poem, folded his jelab about his middle, and went out over the downs. Glyde saw him no more that day, nor, in- deed, till the next morning, when he found him squatted over the pipkin simmering on a lire. The year went on its course, and windy March broke into a wet, warm April. Glyde sat at the knees of his master and im- bibed learning and fundamental morality. But now and then he absented himself fora day at a time, and was understood to get news from Salisbury market. He came bat k one day with a newspaper. Senhouse read without falter or comment:   A marriage is arranged, and will take place in July, between Nevile Ingram of Wan I ess Hall, l elsboro , Yorks, anil Sanchia-Josepha, youngest daughter of Thomas Welbore Percival, of-Great Cumberland Place, W., and The Poultry, K. C.  In the night, or very early in the morning, Glyde disappeared without word or sign left behind him.  Tu be contit.uet'.

CITY BUILDING IN GERMANY Bv Frederic C. I owe KNOW of no cities in the modern world which com- pare with those which have arisen in Germany during the past twenty vears. There are none in Great Britain, from which country official delegations are constantly crossing the North Sea to study the achievements of the German city. There are none in France, in which country the building of cities has made but little progress since the achievements of Baron Haussman made Paris the beautiful city that it is. There have been three great periods in which the building of cities inspired the thoughts and dreams of men. In the age of the Antonines the Roman people gave themselves with enthusiasm to the em- bellishment of their cities. The great pub- lic structures, the temples, amphitheatres, and palaces then erected have withstood the ravages of time and still remain the Vol. XLVII. 61 wonder of subsequent centuries. During the Middle Ages the cities of Italy, France,  iermanv. and the Netherlands erected sim- ilar monuments expressive of the love and pride awakened by their newly obtained freedom. Now again in the twentieth cen- tury the German people are expressing their pride in the fatherland and the imperial aspirations of Germany in monuments of the same permanent i haracter and artistic splendor. Capital cities like Berlin, Mu- nich and Dresden, as well as more com- mercial cities like Diisseldorf, Mannheim, Frankfort, Cologne, Wiesbaden and Stutt- gart. are vying with one another in the beautiful, the orderly, and the serviceable. Important as is the honesty and the efficiency of the German city, it is the big- ness of vision, boldness of execution, and far-sighted outlook on the future that are most amazing. Germany is building her cities as Bismarck perfected the army be- fore Sadowa and Sedan; as the Empire is 601 602 City Building in Germany building its war-ships and merchant men; as she develops her waterways and educa- tional systems. In city building, as in other matters, all science is the hand- maiden of politics. The engineer and the architect, the artist and the expert in hy- giene are alike called upon to contribute to the city's making. The German cities are OlTn c building   f flit   irrman Siwl Crust, I ussel  i rf man factories burrowing their way into the ports of the world, he sees as well that his people are being drawn from the country- side and into the cities. Already lorty-ninc per cent, of the people are living in towns, while the percentage living in cities of over one hundred thousand has increased fifty per cent, in ten years' time. Further than this, the reports of his ministers disclose to him that poverty has come in with the city; that something like eighty per cent, of the population of the larger towns are living in cellars, slums, and under un- sanitary surroundings. And far-sighted statesman that he is, the Kaiser sees that his regiments and his battle ships, no less than the mills and the factories, must be manned by strong and well- i eparcmc.it  t  rc in l iir ekl rr thinking of to-morrow as well as of to-dav, of the generations to follow as well as the generation that is now upon the stage,  ierniany alone sees the citv as the centre of the civilization of the future, and Ger- many alone is building her   ities so as to make them contribute to the happiness, health, and well-being of the people. This seems to be the primary consideration. And it is unique in the modern world. Far-sightedness characterizes Germany in all things. The Kaiser seems to see the eagle of the Hohenzollerns not only at the head of his battalions and living at the mast-head of his dreadnoughts, lie sees not only his merchant marine t hallenging the supremacy of Great Britain and the   cr- edit cated men. And these the city is im- perilling. It is sapping the life of the people. And the Kaiser and his ministers are studying the city as they do their engines of warfare; they are thinking of human beings as well as of ritles, of pro- ducing men as well as of destroying them. Alone among the nations of the earth, Germany is treating the new behemoth of civilization as a creature to be controlled, and made to serve rather than to impair or destroy humanity. The German city, like our own, is the product of the last generation. Only its location, its traditions, its royal palaces and gardens are old. Diisseldorf had but 70,000 people in 1S71. It now has 300,000. C ity Building in Germany Frankfort has grown from 80,000 in 1871 to 335.000 in 1905. Berlin was a capital city of but 800.000 in 1870; to-day it contains 2,oqq.ooo peo- ple. There are thirty- three cities in Germany with a population in ex- cess of one hundred thou- sand people. They con- tain 12.000,000 people, or twenty per cent, of the population, while the total urban population equals forty-nine per cent, of the total. The railway and the factory have created the  ierman city as they have our own. But Germany oversees her growing cities as an architect does a structure. The liberty of the individual is not permitted to become license to the detriment of the community. In city building, as in other things,  ier- manv calls in her experts. If they do not already exist she creates them. Town planning has become a science, just as much a science as the building of engines. And it is treated as such. A school has recently been opened in Berlin devoted to the sub- ject. Exhibition of things municipal and congresses of various kinds are promoted. An exhibition of town planning and city building is to be held in Berlin this vear, from May to July. There has grown up a substantial literature 011 city building. There are experts like Stiibben, Fisher, Gurlett, and Baumeister, who go from city Old moat beautified.

The get- rich-speculator and the jerry-builder are subordinated to the will of the community acting through its permanent and expert body of city officials. And the   ierman city begins at the bot- tom and builds up. In city building, as in the construction of a battle ship, the keel is laid lirst. We recognize the necessities of a stable foundation when we erect a fortv- story sky-scraper. We recognize it even in a house. But we ignore it when we build a city. There are volumes of laws and libraries of literature on the charters and the machinery for the governing of men. but there is little legislation and less literature on that which is in finitely more important, and that is the relation of the city to its physical foun- dations which control all else. The problems of transportation, of light, power, heat, and water are all funda- mental to city life. These services are the life blood of the com- munity. They control its area, the density of population, the homes, the health, the morals, and, in a large sense, the industrial life of the community. We leave them to the license of the gambler and the r.uiMinu plan   f suburban allotment, Dusselilorf.

But the German cities very generally own these undertakings and make them serve the people. But down below' these agencies, controlling them as every- thing else, is the land, which, like the foun- dations of the structure, control its size, its appearance, its streets, its open places, its parks, its boulevards, its docks, its harbors, its homes, and its submerged tenement dwellers. The land is the controlling in- fluence on city life. And the German city controls the land. It does it through ownership, through taxa- tion, and through regulation. The Amer- ican city is impotent before the owner and the builder, the sky-scraper and the tene- ment owner. It can take but little thought of the morrow. It cannot subordinate the private to the public, elevate the beautiful above the ugly, or give a thought beyond the immediate necessities of to-day. Not until some calamity or urgent necessity strikes horror or death to the community 604 does the State permit the city to deal with the abuses which imperil the life of the community. This paramountcy of private property does not exist in Germany. Humanity is first. The city enjoys some of the sover- eignty of the Empire. It can promote the beautiful. It can destroy the ugly. It can protect its poor. It can educate as it wills. It can  dan for the future. It can have c ity dreams. And the German city has dreams, dreams whic Ii are fast being visu- alized. The German burgomeisters are laying the foundations of the city of to- morrow as an architect lays the founda- tions of a forty-story sky-scraper or the designer of a World s Fair plans his play- city far in advance of its excavation. German architects saw the obvious. I hey saw that the city would grow as it had in the past. So they enlarged the boundaries. They annexed suburban land. The present area of Diisseldorf, with its City Building in Germany  105 300,000 people, is 29,000ai res; of Cologne with a population of 428,700, is 2 S,Soo; of Frankfort, with a population of 33:5,000, is 23,203.  Having enlarged its area the city was in a jx sition to control its develop- ment, to plan for its building. It called in its architects and its engineers or it sent to a neighboring university for an expert. A plan is made of the surrounding territory, of the topography of the land, the natural advantages, the proximity to the railways. school houses are laid out far in advance of the city s growth  Maps of wide streti lies of open country, still used as past- ure land, may be seen i.i the City Hall, upon which are indicated the streets, parks, and building sites all far Ix-yond the city limits.

The prevailing winds are studied, and factories are only permitted to locate in certain prescribed areas. In some cities they are excluded from the busi- ness and residence sections altogether. If the neighborhood is suited for manufactur- ing, it is dedicated to industrial uses. If it is a working-class quarter, the- streets and parking are adjusted to working-men s homes. If it is suited for homes of a more expensive sort, the plan is upon a more- elaborate scale. The foresight of the city does not end here. Streets, boulevards, parks, open spaces and sites for public buildings and  TheGerman city is far more 'pa  i"tis than the Viierican city in spilt  "I mir ambition.- expansion t  i tin  -.ike nun population.

There can   e no wild cat specula- tion. no   heap and narrow streets, no jerry- building. Everything must be done as the city wills. By this means the slums and the tenement are to be exterminated. In Cologne, for instance, twenty-live per cent, of the land must be left vacant in the busi- ness section, while the building must not exceed four stories in height. In the next outer area thirty-five per cent, of the land must be unoccupied. In the third building area tiftv per cent, of the land must be free and onlv two-story buildings erected, while in the outskirts of the city sixty per cent, must be left unoccupied. Similar restric- tions are imposed in other cities. Health, beauty, and comfort stand higher than do the rights of the land speculator. But the city does not injure the land- owner. It really protects him, even aside Municipal docks in Hamburg. Showing hunting devices, railway yard, and harbor arrangement from the value which the growth and de- velopment of the city create. It saves a neighborhood from tawdry building. It protects all owners from mean streets, from bad pavements, and inadequate sewers. It insures men against the greed, ignorance, or indifference of the speculator. Even the open spaces and broad thoroughfares, taken without compensation from the owner up to thirty or forty per cent, of the area, make the land which remains that much more valuable. And the city protects it- self as well from the necessity of rebuilding streets, sewers, and sidewalks which have been put in by a get-rich-quick speculator. If the owner refuses to dedicate the land required, or the building plan is not accept- able to him, legal proceedings are open to determine whether the plans are reasonable. As a matter of practice, however, real-estate owners co-operate with the city. They have found it to their interest to do so. The planning of new territory is in har- mony with the bigness and permanence of the city. The rectangular arrangement of streets, which prevails in most American cities, has been generally abandoned. So has the modification of it, by the addition of radial avenues, of which Washington is 606 such a conspicuous example. Irregularity has been substituted for regularity, al- though there is no hard and fast rule about it. Streets are laid out in sweeping curves or parabolas, as in parks or private estates. By this means recurring vistas of parking anil houses are secured, as well as the maxi- mum of light, air, and open spaces. Even in the poorer quarters this plan is pursued. This has completely revolutionized the ap- pearance of the city. Open spaces for parks and playgrounds are reserved at intervals within easy walk- ing distance of almost every home. These are so numerous that one is impelled to believe they are looked upon as a necessary part of city building, as necessary as school- houses or police stations. These open spaces are very varied. Some arc round, others are square; some are sunken gar- dens, others suggest an Italian villa. In order that they may not obstruct traffic, the open spaces are often to one side of the street. The imagination of the artist has been allowed free play in the designing of these neighborhood parks. Many of the cities of Germany received valuable heritages in the walls, moats, and sites of the fortifications which surrounded 1 ype "f street cun  truclioii, Frankf jrt-  n-Muin. Showing L ro;ul parking with ornamental fountains .tin  new style of domestic architecture. the old medieval towns. These have been acquired from the nation and converted into parkways or Ring Strassen, which run through the city and separate the old from the new. These splendid park-like ring streets are the commanding features in the beauty of Cologne, Diisseldorf, Bremen. Frankfort, Dresden, and other cities. Vien- na is the- most eminent example. Cologne has two such boulevards, indii ating various periods of the city's fortifications. The inner Ring Street was purchased from the nation for 82,950,000. Ii is laid out in a broad parkway. In many of the cities the old moat has been preserved, while the sites of the fortifications are adorned with gardens and flowering plants, with public structures and statuary. In addition to the ring streets, the new areas which have been added have broad avenues from one hundred to two hundred feet in width, which form the main arteries of the section. The sidewalks are of am- ple width. Then comes an asphalt or mac- adam drivewav. Then a sodded space is reserved for street-railway tra  ks on one side and for a bridle-path on the other. In the centre is a broad mall for pedestrians. The mall is bordered with trees and flowers. There are chairs and benches. These park- ways are resting-places or play-grounds for the neighborhood. At intervals there are formal flower gardens and statuary, foun- tains and shelters. Radiating out from these boulevards and main arteries are smaller streets which are planned on a less elaborate scale. But even these are broad and shaded and intersected with occasional parkings. This same far-sighted wisdom, which plans boulevards, streets, and open spaces far in advance of the city's needs, charac- terizes the workmanship of the streets as well. A large area is undertaken at once. The city is not made to conform to the grade of the district. The district is made to conform to the grade of the city. I have seen great areas of from one-half to a mile square in which a lill was required of from eight to fifteen feet. Tracks are laid from the neighboring railway to make the fill, and the streets are constructed high in the air. Sewers are not of the temporary crock type. They are adequate fora century to come.  las, water, telephone, and electric mains are laid at the same time and con- nections made to the curb. The sewer is in the centre of the street, City Hall, Munich. Style dating from Middle Ages. but the gas, water, electric light, telephone, and other conduits are usually placed under the sidewalks close up to the building line. It is not necessary to block the streets and tear up the pavement in order to get access to them. Once completed, the streets need never be disturbed. All this work is done by the city. The owner may not develop the territory as he sees tit. Xor can war- ring companies tear up the street for the installation of pipes or conduits. When the houses have been built the street is faced with asphalt, macadam, or stone, as may be required by the locality. All this is financed in a sensible way. No individual could pay for the develop- ment of such a large area. So the city advances the cost for the entire develop- ment at a low rate of interest, and carries the cost as a lien until the land has been built upon. Then the frontage cost, to- gether with the interest charges, is assessed against the lot owner who pays at a time when it is most convenient for him to do so. By such comprehensive development great economies are effected in construc- tion, in the carrying charges, as well as in the subsequent repair and reconstruction work of the city. This outlook on the future characterizes 608 other matters as well. The city buys land for school-houses, police and tire stations, and playgrounds far in advance of its needs. The city buildings are so located as to har- monize with the surroundings and where possible developed into a city centre. There is nothing temporary and illogical. Parks, boulevards,   mblic structures, school-houses, docks, and pleasure resorts all lit into one another like the granite blocks of a public building, quarried possibly in Vermont but laid in place, without the touch of a chisel, a thousand miles away. The German city is being built as the kings of an earlier age or the rich burghers of mediaeval Italy embellished their capital cities. It measures its wealth by its popu- lation and its tax duplicate. And it homes itself accordingly. It groups its public structures about a central plan so as to secure the maximum of architectural effect. It calls upon the architects of the country  to compete with plans. It razes whole areas if necessary to secure proper vistas or a line outlook. It adjusts the architect- ure to the traditions or style of the town. In Berlin there is the Lustgarten, about which are grouped the Royal Palaces, the Cathedral, the Art Gallery, the National Library, the University, the Opera House, City Building in Germany and the Museum. Out from this centre the spacious I nter den Linden extends to the Brandenlmrger   late, surmounted with the Quadriga of charioted horses taken from Paris. About the new Reichstag building is another wonderful group of buildings, with the Bismarck Denkmal, the statue of Moltke, and the Sieges Saule, at the head of the magnificent Sieges Alice, which trav- erses the Tiergarten and is flanked on either side with statues of all of the Brandenburg rulers. At the entrance to Charlottenburg is the wonderful new  "harlottenburg bridge, while within the city are various open spaces adorned with splendid memorials of war and of peace. Every large city has one or more such show places, many of them heritages of an earlier day, many of them very mod ern. There is the Briihl Terrace in l res den,  the Balcony of Europe,  with its boulevard prospect far above the River Elbe. There is also the  winger, with the Art Gallery, the Opera House, and the Royal Palaces. In Dusseldorf there is the Kiinig s Allee, in Frankfort the Goethe Plata and Romerberg, about the old City Ilall. There are the wonderful vistas of Munich, which greet one at every turn, and the magnificent Ring Strasse of Vienna with its group of public structures. The railway stations open into spacious plazas, adorned with flower beds and flanked with hotels and public buildings which conform to a uniform style. The City of Frankfort purchased a number of old buildings surrounding the City Hall and dating from mediaeval times, and re- stored them to their original style in order to preserve the harmony of the surround- ings. In Copenhagen the city gives a sub- stantial prize each year to the architect who produces the most beautiful structure and harmonizes it most perfectly with the old. Dusseldorf either erected or aided in the erection of monumental structures for the German Steel Trust and the de- partment store of Tietz. These business structures, built according to city designs, are ornamented with sculpture, paintings, and mosaics, and suggest great modern palaces rather than business premises. In Frankfort the city has just completed a great exposition hall capable of holding fifteen thousand people, where industrial, art. and other exhibitions can be held, where great conventions can assemble and monster concerts be given. The cost of the building ran into millions of dollars, but the city will realize a return in the business whii h it brings to the city, no less than in the happiness and pleasure of the people. Munich has a similar permanent exposi- tion group containing a new theatre, an auditorium, a great hall for exhibits, and a summer garden for concerts.

City Building in Germany The German citv is being built   n a sc ale of generosity whic h halts at no expense. Its public-school buildings riv al in splendor the best modern buildings of our great universities. And the equipment is of the same order. I know of no public schools, even in New York or Boston, that seem as costly in their construction or more complete in every detail than those ot a half-dozen German cities. They contain assembly rooms and vestibules ot the most ness signs are of an inoffensive sort. There are no telegraph or telephone wires over- head. There are no obtruding street-rail- way tracks under foot. All tracks are of girder groove pattern and so close to the pavement that they offer no obstruction to traffic. The pavements are as smooth as a floor and the tracks are kept in perfect repair.

And when we consider the relative poverty of the German people and the burdens of taxa- tion for war and armaments, the attitude of our own cities toward these matters seems positively parsimonious and nig- gardly. Beauty is promoted in small things as well as in great. Private interests are not permitted to disfigure the city or incon- venience 'the public. Bill-boards are pro- hibited or limited to the outskirts. Busi- one may not enter or alight at any other place. Similar signs point out the destina- tion, while the cars themselves carry num- ber' which indicate their routes. At regu- lar intervals there are waiting-rooms for passengers, while many cities have erected artistic clock towers in conspicuous places in the city. There is art in everything. Not only art but foresight, intelligenc e, and common- sense. The German city assumes that those who use the streets have a right to be protec ted Irom the ugly as muc h as from any other nuisance.

About it the busi- ness as well as the pleasure ot" the city moves. The cities of Bremen and Diisscl- dorf have parked the moats, which sur- rounded the old portions of these cities; They are the chief features of the city's beauty. The prescience of the German city is seen in the harbor and canal development which has taken place in recent years. There is keen competition among the Rhine towns. And their phenomenal growth is largely due to the intelligent way in whit h they have enc ouraged business I y the devel- opment of water transportation. Thought in America is obsessed with the idea that the laws of commerce are like the law.-, ol nature. We assume that they cannot be contnilled   rai le  1 i yman. Trans   irtaii  n must be left to private control. There i- no such assumption in Germany. The reverse is true.  lermany takes it as a mat ter of course that manv things must be done by the state in order to protect its life and develop industrv. The highways of commerce, both by rail and by water. are the best assets of the nation. Through their intelligent administration trade and commerce have been stimulated. The lities, too, have demonstrated that com- merce is ruled by convenient e and cheap- ness. Berlin i- inier-ei led by canals, in the face of the fact that the nation owns the rail wavs and makes them as serviceable as possible for industry. Hamburg and Bremen are free ports of entry into whi  h the men handise of all the world i- shipped in bulk. Here it wpermitLed to lie without tax or dutv awaiting export or entry into the country. Frankfort. Cologne, Duis- burg, iMisseldorf. and other Rhine towns have become metropolitan cities by the development of their water fronts, by the building of docks and wharves, hydraulii device- and machinery lor the economical and expeditious handling of water freight. Duisburg is one of the centres ot the coal and lumber trade. Its population has grown from .ji.ooo. in iSSo, to io;.ooo. in 1005, through the great dot ks whit h it built. It is one of the centres of the Lower Rhine trade and the great industrial region of the Rhine provinces. Dltsseldorl owns the river bank for three or four miles. l p to a few years ago the river frontage was but little used. Mu- h of it was marsh land. This the city re- claimed. Here its architects laid out a broad esplanade and parkway. It i- flanked with an Art Exposition building and public 611 City Building in Germany buildings. Upon the water front are land ins; stages for passenger boats, rowing i lubs. and light summer i raft. The whole work is designed to permit the use of river for traffic as well as for pleasure. In America water fronts are dedicated to one thing or the other. II they are used for business purposes they have no value for pleasure. Beauty is ignored. This is valors, and storehouses, all connected with one another by rail. Thedocksof a German city are great terminal systems equipjted with every convenience foreventhe smallest shipper. By virtue of these works the trade of Diisseldorf increased three hundred per cent, in ten years  time. And within a very short time the improvement will yield a profit from out the rentals of the enterprise. Spacious  treet    h truct wn. Chat lot tell bur  not true in Germany. Business is made to adjust itself to art, pleasure, recreation, and use by the whole community. The harbor proper in Diisseldorf is more than a mile in length. It is divided into great basins for various kinds of freight. There is one for coal, another for lumber, another for grain, another for petroleum, another for general merchandise. There is no con- fusion and no dirt. Tracks are laid along the embankments in connection with the railways and the street-railway systems. There are hoisting devices, equipped with the latest electrical and hvdrauli  machin- ery, for the expeditious handling of every kind of freight. This is all done by the i ity and owned by it. It is all as complete and symmetrical as a machine, and the cost of transshipment is reduced to a mini- mum. Here are ere  ted warehouses, ele- The harbor development of Frankfort is even more wonderful. The city lies upon the River Main, which was not navigable for Rhine traffic. But this consideration did not deter the city. It borrowed S i S,000,000. It proceeded to deepen the River Main for several miles, so that large boats could come to its doors. It erected docks and handling devices. Its harbor traffic increased one thousand two hundred per cent, in nine years  time. The first harbor became inadequate and a far more elaborate programme has been entered on.    ne thousand one hundred and eighty acres of land were purchased. One-fourth of this was laid out in streets, railways, and embankments. Water basins of no acres are being excavated. The navi- gable shores are nine miles in length. They are connected with thirty-five miles City Building in Germany of railway tracks built by the state and the city. The cost of the land alone was $6,ooo,ooo. The construction cost was Si2,ooo,ooo more. But Frankfort expects to reimburse itself for the outlay by the resale of the surplus land acquired. Seven hundred and twenty acres have been re- tained for sale or lease for factory sites. Here is to be the industrial centre of the city, with mills, factories, and warehouses, all connected with railway sidings, so that the smallest producer will have the cheap- est sort of service. But industry involves workmen, and workmen must have homes. And if they are efficient they must have good homes. So the city, which owns its tram lines, has extended them into the suburbs. It will carry the working-men by fast and cheap surburban service into the surrounding villages where land and rents are cheap. Upon a large tract of land owned by the city municipal dwellings will be erected to be rented at a moderate cost. In another section of the region five hundred and titty dwellings, to accommodate from two to four families each, will be built. And in close proximity to this new harbor a great work- ing-man s park is being laid out with oppor- tunity for every sort of recreation. Thus these cities build. Frankfort is one of the most wonderful of the German cities. But its far-sighted and comprehen- sive vision is but typical of others. For the German city controls its physical foun- dations; it is not controlled by them. It subordinates property to humanity; it permits the freest possible play of indi- vidual initiative so long as the individual does not interfere with the common weal. At the same time it reserves to itself the right to determine where the freedom of the individual must end and the activity of the city begin; and when the city does make an investment it keeps for itself as large a portion of the speculator s protit as it can. It pays for its parks and its boule vards, its docks and its wharves from out the resale of surplus land which it acquires in excess of its needs. And now Prussia has adopted the same principle in canal construction. An inland water-way is to be constructed from Hanover to the Rhine for the purpose of opening up this region to industry. For half a mile on either side of the right of way the land is to be taken Vol. XLVII  62 by the state and held until the canal is completed. I hen it is to be sold or leased for business or dwelling purposes and the cost of the undertaking paid for as near as possible out of the profits. At the same time manufactures will lie supplied with cheap sites and the population of the great l ilies will be given an opportunity to re- house itself under hygienic and state super- vised surroundings. German cities recognize the controlling influence of the land on the life of the community. And they have become great landlords. Frankfort with a population of less than four hundred thousand owns 12,800 acres of land within its boundaries and 3,800 acres without. Within the past ten years the city has expended $50,000,000 in the purchase of land alone. The land which it owns is almost exactly equal to the area occupied by the cities of Pittsburg or Baltimore, each of which has a consider- ably greater population. Cologne owns fifteen and a half square miles, exclusive of many open spaces. The town of Breslau, with a population about the size of Cleve- land, Ohio, owns twenty square miles of land or 12,800 acres. But Berlin is the greatest landlord of them all. That citv owns 30,000 acres, mostly outside of the city, while Munich owns 13,600 acres and Strasburg 12,000 acres. German cities also possess great forests. They are constantly adding to their possessions. There are, in fact, 1,500 smaller towns and villages in Germany which derive so much revenue from the lands which they own that they are free from all local taxes. Five hundred of these communities are not only free from all local taxes, but are able to declare a dividend of from S25 to S100 a year to each citizen as his share of the surplus earnings of the common lands. The motive of all this beauty, harmony, business enterprise, and foresight is so obvious to the German that he cannot comprehend why it should be questioned.  Why docs a merchant erect a fine store- room or build himself a mansion   he asks. The German city thinks as an indi- vidual thinks about his business and his home. A finished city attracts people. It brings manufactures and business. People choose a beautiful city as a place of resi- dence. V isitors make pilgrimages to it. Well-educated children make better citi- The Candid Friend zcns, better artisans. The street railways, gas works, docks, and other enterprises pay their way. They even make money. But more than this, they are a necessary part of the city, and of course they should lie owned by it. If it lie suggested that all this is socialistic, the German business man shrugs his shoulders and says:  It may be, but it is good business.  It is much better than good business; it is good states- manship. A people lake on the color of their city as a chameleon takes on the color of its habitat. People are in a large meas- ure what the city makes them. This is obvious to the stranger. 1 f any one doubts the psychological influence of city environ- ment, he need only spend a few days in the dirt-begrimed cities of the Elber- feld-Barmen-Essen district, the centre of the great industrial region of Germany, and then visit the clean, thoroughly ar- tistic  Garden City  of Dusseldorf, but an hour s journey away, to be convinced that all this pays. It pays not only in the current coin of commerce, but in the re- finement, the cheerfulness, the happiness, and the outlook on life of the poorest citizen. THE CANDID FRIEND By Alice Duer Miller I L 1.1'STR Al 1 ON S BY F. GRAHAM C'OOTKS IMMONS never went into the writing-room of the club; the association was too painful. But to-night, with the courage born of an approaching crisis, he came and stood a moment in the doorway, and looked at the corner writing-table. There, two years ago, with the help of that spotless blotting-paper, with those clean gray pens, looking out over these same housetops from the windows of this quiet upper room, he had committed one of those blunders which are a- unexpected, as illogical, and as irre- trievable as death. He had written two letters:   My dear Mark: You are quite' wrong in thinking me such a narrow-minded bach- elor that I cannot see that for some men with the right sort of woman, marriage is the best sort of life. I hope it may be so for you. L. S.  And then, drawing a larger sheet to him, he had written:  Dear Wjcki s: If a fellow wrote to tell you that lie was the victim of a slow dis- ease, now in it  incipient stages, which would eventually blind him and deafen him, and keep him confined to one small, ill-furnished room, no one would expect you to write him a letter of congratulation. Yet this is what I have just had to do. The best friend I have in the world is going to be married, and, ye gods  to such a woman  If 1 saw her now for the first time I should probably think her a perfect mate, and envy my friend his future; for she is young, beautiful, virtuous, rich, well-born. But unhappily she happens to be my cous- in. I have watched her grow up, and I know that those clear blue eves of hers see only one thing, and that is on which side the lovely Gertrude s bread is buttered; that her ears hear nothing but what it pleases her to hear. I know one might as well try to roll water into a ball as to influ- ence her sweet docility to do anything it does not want to do. She can be generous, but she cannot admit an obligation. She can be kind, but the world must hear of it. 1 have known her sit up all night to nurse a sick servant; and a few days after, because the woman was not sufficiently grateful, give her a reference that would keep her out of work for the rest of her life. My friend will prosper. He will soon be- gin to find himself knowing the people it will be of advantage to him to know, aid, even more important, strange impalpable The Candid Friend obstacles will intervene between him and those of us who are of no use. Perhaps you will say that this woman must at least have brains. You will l e wrong. This is somc- . thing more effective and dangerous than brains; it is egotism. No mind could con ceivc such subtle plans as the egotist in- stinctively and almost unconsciously car- ries out. Xo intelligent villain would dare to stoop as low as the successful self-de- ceiver. There never was such a protection against having anything brought home to you as to be perfectly sell'-deprecatorv in speech, and perfectly self-righteous at heart.  Within a few vears one of two things will happen. F.ither my friend will learn to understand her and loathe her in his good, honest soul; or else he will adopt her point of view and speak her language. He will justify her, a  men do who marry liars, by saving that we must not expect so high a standard of honor from women as we do from men. He will say, as men do who have deliberately chosen fools, that the last thing in the world he desires in a wife is intellectual companionship; and he will tell me that woman is an ideal being living in a mist on a mountain-top, as all men do who dare not subject the women they love to the simplest tests of reality. Some men, of course, can live in a cloud too, but I don t think this one can. With an unusually considerate and affectionate nature, he combines an excessively keen and relentless judgment. He never went in much for the analysis of character, but 1 used to notice, even when we were at col- lege, that in a critical moment he under- stood men more wisely and more precisely than we, who thought we were more psy- chological.  Oh, W ii kes, only the blind can say it makes no difference whom a man marries. Does it make no difference in the first place whom he chooses  And after that, the question is merely whether he repudiates his debts or ruin' himself in pay ing them.  I never was glad before that you had settled ten thousand miles away, but it is almost like writing to the dead. Good- night, Lewis Simmons.  Having written without pausing, he tir-t hesitated whether to send the letter at all, and then, in contempt of all hesitation, he gathered them both up, folded, directed, and posted them, and realized an hour afterward that he had interchanged the envelopes He was in the smoking-room when his memory gave him back the pict- ure of his mistake, and a minute later he heard Mark's voice at his elbow, saving pleasantly:  I thought I might llnd you here.  Simmons managed to look up, and to sav with the deliberateness of a man roused from profound thought:   And how do you happen to be off duty at five o'clock in the afternoon    The other laughed.  So you have read my letter. Well, it is characteristic of voii to see matrimony even in prospect as a new form of bondage; and yet, as a matter of fact, I am more my own man than 1 ever was before.  Simmons did not answer at once. For the first time in his life lvc had fell that lie would rather sec any one in the world than his friend. The next instant he realized that this accidental interview was in truth a priceless boon. He wits speaking to Mark perhaps for the last time; il was like a death bed parting to him, rendered all the more solemn by Mark's complete un- consciousness. He felt the restless desire, which most of us experience only alter death has cut u  off, to tell his friend how dear he was to him. It was a tone, how- ever, which he knew he could not take, and he talked resolutely on other topics, suc- ceeding so well that Mark lingered on and on, obviously enjoying himself. When at length he rose, Simmons rose too.  Mark,  he said,  I have just written you a letter.  The other looked up.  Xothing very unusual in that, is there     Yes,  answered Simmons,  for I sent il to a fellow in Manila, whereas 1 have just posted to your address a letter 1 did not intend for you.    Well,  said Mark,  1 11 send it back.   That was niv first idea when you came in here, to ask you to return it unread to impress on your mind that I did not want you to read it. But as I sat here 1 under- stood that such a promise, such a situation between vou and me, would be as much of a barrier as anything could be. Xow 1 have a different solution. 1 want you to promise me to read it, but not to read it m The Candid Friend for two years. Let us say two years from to-night. This is the eleventh of February, i n t it  We shall meet here I don t mean we sha n t meet in the mean time just as usual but two years from to-night we shall meet to discuss my letter, or else not at all.    Mark looked at him gravely.  This is all very mysterious to me,  he said,  but of course, I will do anything you want, and as for this letter, I'll put it in the tire just as soon as I get it if you prefer.   On the contrary,  said Simmons,  I prefer, on the whole, that you should read it two years from to-night. Put it away, and enter a note in your engagement-book to that effect.  Mark took out his pocket-book obedi- ently, but as he put it back, he could not suppress a smile.  Of course, I know what it is,  he said.  A philippic against matrimony. Don t you think you take your pen a trifle seriously     You can tell me in two vear .  Yet after he was alone, Simmons had asked himself whether in taking such great risk' as he was taking he would not have done better to ask for a five-year reprieve. In five years Mark would either have be- come so entirely the creature of Gertrude as to be thoroughly implacable; or else he would have found her out. Two years was a  hort time for love to change into knowl- edge, or for a man to lay down his indi- viduality. Yet the idea of his own suffering had warned him to make the period as short as possible. As a matter of fact he had not found the time so very painful. He had continued to see Mark, if not as often, at least in just about the same way, though rarely at Mark s own house. Simmons could never be .sure whether this were by Mark s own wish, or because Gertrude, with the won- derful protective instinct of the egotist, recognized him as a hostile force. She was always cordial to him, and even in public- made play with the men s friendship.   It is a dreadful thing,  she had once i ibscrved t    a group of pe      le standing about after dinner,   it is a dreadful thing to marrv your cousin s best friend you feel they know so much when they talk you over.   My dear Gertrude,  Simmons had an- swered,  I don t suppose Mark and lever talked you over in our lives.   No,  said Mark;  for. strange as it may seem, a man does not discuss his wife.  Simmons s heart sank. There it was, Mark and Gertrude were not two indi- viduals; thev were now that mysterious entity, man and wife. One did not cer- tainly criticise one s wife; one did not stand up for her; one simply did not dis- cuss her. And it was this standard of matrimonial honor which Simmons, an irretrievable bachelor, saw he had left out of his calcu- lation when he had insisted on his solution of the incident. He had been right enough in thinking that Mark could forgive him for criticising the woman he loved if he had come to see the justice of the criticism, or even possibly if he had not. But there was another element: the conventional demands of the situation. On a desert island their friendship might have gone on unbroken, but in the midst of a civilization in which matrimony was still an institution Mark could not go on in intimacy with the man who had written that letter. And whenever Simmons saw Gertrude  saw her light-blue eyes, clear as little crys- tal bubbles, when he noted how feminine was her charm, how appealing every curve of her soft, slim figure, he saw that she was completely armed against anv attack. Again, sometimes when she got more than usually on his nerves, when her high motives for small deeds were more than usually emphasized, or when her ability to squeeze a topic dry of the last drop of flattery to her own personality was more than usually conspicuous, Simmons would think with a sort of fierce joy of that un- opened letter. Throughout those two years he had watched Mark with the anxious, unobtru- sive attention one gives to an invalid, to see which way the crisis will turn; and, to do Simmons justice, he was not sure which way he wanted the crisis to turn. To have seen Gertrude in anything like the colors in which Simmons saw her would have been t  a man like Mark the complete wreck of his happiness.    n the other hand, how could he go on being blind and retain his own integrity of judgment  For Mark had the wisdom that comes not so much from intellect as from perception. He had had the courage ever since he was a boy to take without the alleviations of self-deception   Vy.

Vol. XLVII. 63 The Candid Friend whatever suffering his own actions had brought him. Simmons hud spoken of the egotist s instinct for self-protection. Mark was entirely without this instinct. His reward was the singular clearness of his vision. For two years Simmons had watched his friend and had seen little to lead him to either hypothesis. Of one thing only he was sure: whatever Gertrude might have accomplished in other ways, she had not lessened the friendship between the two men.    nee, when a shooting-trip they had arranged was abandoned at the last mo- ment, on account of a mysterious illness ot Gertrude s from which she recovered as soon as all the arrangements had been un- made, Simmons had suspected that Mark had had a Hash of comprehension. He himself had felt uncertain about Ger- trude from the beginning. She had been far loo enthusiastic when the plan was lirst suggested, and had uttered one terribly alarming sentence about Mark's feeling perfectly free to come and go just as he had before he was married. So when Sim- mons stopped at the house in the afternoon before they were to start, he was not sur- prised to find Mark unstrapping his guns. He was looking very serious.   I've been trying to telephone you, Lewis,  he said.  I can t go. Gertrude s ill.   Not dangerously, I hope."  No, I don't think so She has some trouble with her ear which seems to be frightfullv painful. 1 did not see the doc- tor myself, but she tells me he says that it is very unlikely that any operation will be necessary. She urges me to go.   1 see,  said Simmons, and dropped the time-tables slowly into the lire. He yielded instantly because he knew Gertrude. Her methods were rarely active. She was not often forced to oppose the march of events, for things she disapproved of seldom came anywhere near happening. If she had been driven to anything so overt as an ear- ache, she was in a formidable mood. But he wondered a little at Mark s unquestion- ing obedience. It might, of course, be affection, but then again it might be mere weariness of the spirit a realization as acute as his own that one opposed Ger- trude only when prepared to tight to the death. While they were speaking Gertrude her- self came in, looking like an angel.   I hope vou are telling him that he must   o,  she said brightly, "for I shall be quite well to-morrow. I have made up mv mind to that; it is all arranged. And if, after all, there should have to be a little operation, those kind doctor men will take just as good care of me as it Mark were at home, and I do so want him to go away and enjov himself tor a little while.   If Mark had been a mere acquaintance, Simmons would have studied his expression during this speech with a good deal of in- terest; but, as it was, mere decency made him turn his eyes away, and after a pause he observed:  Well, I'll telegraph and give up our places. And I hope you will be better to- me  rr  w, Gertrude.  She protested that she would be entirely well, or at least out of intense pain; and, indeed, the next day when he came to ask after her, he found her recovered. It was then too late to take advantage of the holiday.  I shall never forgive you, Lewis,  she said, "for not having made Mark go. Now he has missed his trip for nothing. I told you 1 should be well to-dav.  If that letter had not been hanging over his head, Simmons would, perhaps, have suggested that to gain a knowledge of so peculiar a constitution as Gertrude s it was well worth losing a shooting-trip; but as it was, he was discreetly silent, and it was Mark who answered:   It wasn't a question for Lewis to decide. It was impossible for me to go from the moment you told me you were suffering.  And to Simmons s overstrained ear even this speech suggested a complete under- standing. W hen thev were alone he allowed him- self to throw out one feeler. "I wish,  he said,  that by some telepathic suggestion 1 could have cured Gertrude twelve hours earlier.   Yes,  said Mark,  but I don't think this was a case where telepathv would have worked.  Simmons glanced at him quickly, but his face said nothing more than his words. Several times in the course of the next few days Simmons heard Gertrude tell how Mark had given up his trip just be- J r tWlt i'y     Ami Simmons recognized in that yiraiylit. l-"l l. -t  a-'y jlan ;  . ti.I-    k    ' a man wh i   yiu- - l'm e   o The Mazarin Bible cause she had a little l it of a pain in her ear. There was hut little variety in the replies she received. Would any one go who had the privilege of staying.-' Kach time the point of view seemed to strike Gertrude with a new surprise. Each time Mark, plaving his part in the background, smiled his sweet, vague smile, which to the casual always seemed to say whatever it was called on to say; but to Simmons, who had observed it for fifteen years, it seemed to conceal, as it had always concealed even belter than language, the depths of Mark s thoughts. Not once in the course of these two y ears had the eleventh of February been men- tioned, vet  in that night Simmons went to the club with the most perfect confidence that Mark would keep his appointment. Nine, ten, eleven struck, however, and his confidence waned. The strain of un- certainty changed to the depression of de- spair. After all, Mark's failing to come would be the niost complete of answers, and perhaps the least painful. Simmons saw how characteristic it was of hi- friend s nature to spare him a personal explanation. At a quarter to twelve he rose to go, three hours of waiting making the hour seem later than it was, and on the stairs met Mark. He was resplendent in evening dress and whistling softly to himself.   I ve just seen the most perfect perform- ance of  Tristan,   was his greeting. Simmons, with his heart in his mouth, stood on the stairs and discussed music, until he reached the limit of his self-control. He interrupted a long sentence ruthlesslv.   You did not remember that you had an appointment here with me  Mark looked at him inquiringly, and he pursued:  You have not read my letter    A letter  When did you write to me        Two years ago.  Mark's face lit up.   Of course, my deai fellow, 1 am so sorry. I meant to tell you before. The other day I was destroying a lot of old papers, and somehow or other this portentous letter of yours got burnt with the rest. Was it very important     Was it burnt unread    asked Simmons Mark had been looking at the floor, and after this question continued to do so for a second. Then looking his friend in the eye, he answered:  Yes, unread.  And Simmons recognized in that straight, bold, steady glance the look of a man who is lying.

K. 1 11 IKS N the Clinch family, for many generations, the men have written C. E. after their names; and since our spe- cializing days, not only C. F., but M E., E. M., or E. E., Ch. E., or Met. E. or even El. Met. But after all, it was given to the shrewd- est old C. E. in the family, Colonel Dabney Clinch whose degree was made in France, and whose colonelcy dates from the Civil War to conceive that forceful idea which has made all Clinches of whatever engineer- ing branch closely interdependent, and has unified a widely scattered family. It was twenty-live years ago that this wise head of his house recognized the com- mercial value of the family inclination, and loving brothers and cousins, their sons and his own, second only to his profession, had formed the Clinch Engineering and Con- tracting Company its head-quarters in the big Southern city with which the family had always been identified.  The great Cinch Company,  his young- est brother's son, Dabney 2d, had re- marked gleefully, as he wandered home from Tech one year, when jobs for youth- ful graduates were few, and had presented himself to his President. His uncle had smiled, but had sent him in August down to Cienfuegos, where he stood on a dock, under a corrugated iron roof, and checked shipments of castings for a light railway the Company was building into some sugar plantations. Yet, if the practical old gentleman had any favorites in his family which he would have denied he was especially tender tow- ard those who bore his name. They were his fourth son, Dabney Junior, whose work was tunnelling, and who was now piercing the mountains of a neighbor- ing State for the South Western s cut-off; Dabney 2d, w hose Cienfuegos experience, followed by many others equally corrosive, had long since taught reverence for the Company s name, and Dabney Junior s Vol. XLVII. 64 son, Dabney 3d, who wras now five feet ten, and had just completed his course at his preparatory school. Long before those salad days ended for each young Clinch, the c hoice of his tech- nical college became a subject for the Com- pany s solicitude. But thus far the third Dabney had evaded all attempts to deter- mine his preferences, and, on the question of his future, had maintained a provoking silence. Particularly since the absence of the boy s father, the grandfather had been drawn more closely to this youthful name- sake. When his Own boys were young, he had been too busy scratching a living out of a reconstructed South to enjoy their com- panionship; but now that there was money to spare and leisure enough, with his grand- son he made fresh entry into the charmed country of youthful enthusiasms, the more seductive because, since grandmother Clinch s death, the old man had begun to realize the tenuity of his own hold. He liked, too, to watch in this boy the develop- ment of the Clinch characteristics, for there was more than a mere physical resem- blance between the two the old man and the younger: each had the same pride of race, the same dignity of bearing, the same directness of speech. But, notwithstanding their intimate mo- ments. vainly had the Colonel tried to elicit some response to the subject nearest his heart this boy s future. Vainly had the father, detained by the vicissitudes of his enterprise, written his advice. Vainly had his masters urged a superior preparation, the demands of technical schools being various. Vainly had the younger cousins  holding briefs for Stevens or Sheffield, Lawrence or Lehigh, Tech or Cornell  argued and admonished. The boy would not commit himself. Now the women of the family were whis- pering,  Such latitude had never been per- mittee  their boys,  and the younger men said openly:  Little Dab would have all 621 Stubbs s Principal sorts of a time dotting off no preliminaries and taking all of his entrance somewhere in the fall.  Finally, on the evening of the hoy s birthday the family having assembled at Grandfather Clinch s for the customary celebration he carried his perplexity to the lad s mother, who had been in the mountains with her husband for some weeks, but was home now for this festive occasion. Pretty little Sallie Clinch was the one daughter-in-law in the family who had not assumed the protective coloration ol the Clinches, She was not only Dabney Jun- ior s wife, and the mother of Dabney , d, but she was the sole surviving child of her father-in-law s dear friend, the late Admiral Ednev, U. S. X. The Colonel had great confidence in her quick judgment, for she possessed that bird wit. alert and intuitive, which is often the attribute of so many small women.   Yes, Sallie, our boy s eighteen,  he said to her, as she entered the dining-room on his arm, stifling a sigh over the encroaching years, and their inevitable separations.  He should be thinking of his career.  He drew out the seat of honor Grand- mother Clinch s high-backed chair at the great mahogany table.   You may be sure he is thinking, father, a great deal more than any one gives him credit for," she reassured him. Sallie sat down and felt with one tinv slippered foot for the cushion under the table. The Colonel s tall figure bent interroga- tively.  Perhaps he has confided in you, rav dear     Xot a syllable.   Nor in me and I've given him every chance.  Little Mrs. Sallie flinched, for she dearly loved her father in-law, but her faith in her handsome son never wavered. She looked up brightly into the Colonel s face:  Why is every one forcing him, father  You Clinches tell, when you make up your minds.  Grandfather Clinch turned away. Sallie had been disappointingly impractical. He recalled the same trait now in her father. As if any Clinch of eighteen couldn't make up his mind  Then, too, the other relatives who were trooping in, in gay disorder, yet awaited his disposal. He had old-fashioned ideas about anni- versaries, especially the birthdays, collect- ing as many of the family as he could, to celebrate them in his old-fashioned way. The women might wince, but always there was enshrined in the centre of his table a decorated birthday cake with its halo of tell-tale lights; and, after supper was over, when conversation flagged and the candles flared low, one by one they were extin- guished, with a birthday wish. It had never seemed to the Colonel a gentler custom than on this particular evening, as he looked benignly down the two long rows of joyous faces faces, many of them, the counterparts of those look- ing down from the walls whose smiles were reflected in the shining old glass and quaintly patterned silver. What a family it had been  What a familv it was  From the youngest Dabney who was devoting himself with boyish frankness to his Uncle Dabney s pretty step-daughter, Marcia Screven on to the elders of his own generation. Sallie it was who had pointed out to them all, at the very beginning, that there were more relatives than candles, so the speech- makers, with the exception of grandfather, must be determined by lot, and the draw- ings had caused much merriment. Now, as the Colonel listened to the ora- tory of his brothers, the prudent Pulaski and the impulsive Pleasants, the flowery tribute of his complacent old sister, Miss Georgiana, the incisive compliments of his nephew Dabney and his cousin s son, Telfair, and the frivolous felicitations from the members of Dabney s set or younger,  the thought came to him that it was to the Company the family owed these happy events. It filled him with pardonable pride. Otherwise all these Clinches might be scattered to the earth s far ends, instead of handing on from father to son the power of a business tradition.  It is your turn, father,  Sallie sud- denly reminded him. I he Colonel roused himself. He had for- gotten her earlier warning, absorbed now in the importance lo the Company of Ins last grandson s preference. He reached lor the eighteenth candle.  To your career, my boy,  he said, with a fond smile,  and may your choice bring the Clinch Company its great', st successes.   ' l    yur career, He punctuated it with a great puli' at the candle, squared his spare soldierly shoul- ders, and stood erect, expectant. Sallic Clinch'sswift glance darted around thetable. All the relatives even thevoung sters had grown serious, and had assumed a receptive attitude, while a look of deter- mination the look so like the Colonel s own swept the gayetv from her son s fa  e.   Thank you, every one and especially you, grandfather,  he rose gracefully enough to say; then after a moment s hesi tation,   but I shall never enter the Com pany. I am going to be a naval officer.  Disparaging scowls from his elders, dis- mayed glances from the younger relatives, surcharged the ensuing silence. In grim bewilderment the Colonel still held the smouldering candle, and stood inv b  y.  Pace 6; 2. staring at his grandson, whose whole de- meanor betokened a steadfast purpose. Only Sallie Clinch, from far down the table, smiled mistily on her boy; then she remembered to push back her chair, and the others, grateful for the signal, began to talk trivially, and the party somehow ended.  It was terrible terrible  " shuddered Miss  ieorgiana to the Dabney Clinches, as she sank back on her carriage cushions, and they rolled home behind her fat old horses. Her nephew sat opposite, his arm en- circling his young step-daughter. He had no children of his own, and was partial to his nephew.  Well, by Jove, Aunt  ieorgie. I m inclined to think the Com- pany will be the loser in this.  C.J4 Stubbs s Principal  My dear Dabney, the Company is not usually a loser," his aunt roused herself to answer with spirit. He shrugged good-humoredly.  But lit- tle Dab certainly has inherited the Colo- nel's decision-   And the Admiral s inclination," his wife interposed. "Oh, la, Bettina. do you mean to imply this is Sallie's doings    No, aunt. It s a subconscious revcr sal to type" Mrs. Dalmey was head of the child study department of the Woman s Club.  Sallie, like all Eastern shore girls, danced her slippers olT at the old Academy, and. you yourself know, if brother Dab hadn t carried her off just when he did, l.ieut-"  Do, Bettina.  nudged Miss Octavia, scandalized,  remember Marcia." II Of course they wrote about it all of them to Dabney Junior. He lit a strong black cigar, and giving himself up to rev- ery, found his boy much like his own tun nets. The metaphor interested him.  The outside    information,  he said to himself,  has led us to certain conclusions; but one is always liable to find concealed springs,   onsiderahle thermal a  tivity, or a geologic fault." The problem of Dabney s future seemed to him to include all three. When he had talked himself into a good humor, he wrote a long, cheery letter to his wife, a short one to his son, and wired his father. The telegram, after a conference with Pulaski, sent the Colonel to see his old friend Senator Effingham, who was de lained in Washington, talking the tariff on lumber. I'pon his return he telephoned his grandson to come to the office. The President and Vice-President of the Clinch Company had decided not to consult Nal lie again until everything was salisfactor ily adjusted. I'or. as Pulaski cautiously pointed out, the Admiral s memory was  till green enough to flower into an appoint- ment for his grandson, if the Clinc hes could not keep it in the shade. Sallie, poor girl, was in an embarrassing position. But al though the Colonel had come home in his most optimistic mood, he had no desire to confront that set boyish face without the conc rete backing of the Company. So when young Dabney arrived in their midst, his grandfather gave an interesting account of his interview with Effingham, who had offered him his next appointment  a safe two years away.  And by that time, my lad,  he enlarged conclusively,  you ll have come to your senses. You will see it with our eyes. Why, my dear grandson, you re just throwing yourself away " Pulaski Clinch stroked his white imperial and nodded his approval.  That s about what il amounts to,  he added. Young Dabney, who had listened in re- spectful silence, threw bac k his fine head in protest.   But there s a vacancy next year in our own district. Noonan s man has bilged.  'Flic Colonel looked a trifle annoyed, not only at the glibness with which the naval slang slipped out, but because he had en- tirely overlooked any possibility of a con- gressional appointment. In a general way he knew that a growing Republican oppo- sition, looming in their distric t, had kept Noonan racing back from Washington to look after his interests before the fall elec- tion. He cast a swift glance at Telfair Clinch who had charge of the Company s political interests which told him plainly to look into this, for any obstacle to young Dabney s eventually entering the Company must be removed.   Besides, another year s an awfully long time,  the boy objected, after a moment s pause.  You see,  he turned to include them all.  it makes such a difference with your numbers.   Numbers  It s lucky for you, young man, the Company has made you indepen- dent of numbers " exploded Great-Unde Pleasants. I nde Dabney smiled.  You re right, l ather. Dab won t have to hunt for a girl who c an pay her own mess bill.  There was no answering gleam from the boy s eye. He now sat twirling his hat slowly around in his hand, feeling toward himself and them a growing irritation: with them for n  it understanding, with himself be- cause he could not make them understand, how vital it all was to him.  My dear boy,  expounded the second Dabney further,  every one knows the navy isn t what it was in your Grandfather Ednev s day.   Every time I've been i:i town since, he s turned up at my house.  Page  But it will be,  he interrupted.  See what they all promise.   Promise,  derided his uncle.  Look in this morning's paper, my old friend, Withely, every expectation of being made chief of his bureau, and over him now they ve put some young squib---   Then why shouldn t I be one of them  the squibs, I mean     demanded his nephew. Grandfather Clinch was the first to rec- ognize the deadlock, and now wished he had talked things over again with his daughter-in-law. The two years  reprieve he had brought back with him so blithely began to look like two years of hard labor with a nature as firm as his own. But he loved the boy, and he made a final con- cession.  If it s marine construction, Dab, or naval architecture-   Grandfather,  young Clinch blurted out, rising to make an end of it all,  it isn t in me. I don't want to plan battle- ships, nor cruisers, nor submarines. I want to be a naval officer, and learn how to make the blamed things go,  then, ashamed of his sudden vehemence, he flung himself out of the room. As the door slammed shut after him, the President of the Clinch Company dryly re- marked, " It looks as though Uncle Sam had us outbid.   Submit another set of plans,  was the Vice-President s suggestion.  That young un s worth keeping with us.   Let him go  Let him go his own gait. In a few years he'll be begging to be taken into the Company,  said Pleasants testily. Colonel Clinch scarcelyheard his brother. He was thinking now what it meant to turn the course of a career. lie had come back from the Ecole Polylechnique expecting to alter the face of his country. He had helped to alter it, but it was in another way. The memory of the old bitter years mas- tered him for a moment. When it was over he looked toward Telfair, and idly inquired when Noonan would be down.   1 believe he's expected the end of this week, Cousin Dabney.  The President turned to the baskets on his desk, where a pile of papers awaited his signature.   I reckon you d better see what you can do, Telfair,  he recommended over one shoulder. By the week s end, however, not only Telfair, but each individual Clinch who had been present at the interview, decided to see what he could do,and,one after another, 625 Stubbs s Principal mounted the steps of their congressman s dingy law office.   A Clinch may go so far as to spurn the Company, but 1 reckon the Company will never cold shoulder the family,  thought the Colonel as he saw them all there before him, and heard Pleasants loudly urging his great grand-nephew s case to Noonan.  I didn t know you Clinches were such beggars,  laughed the congressman, rising to give his chair to the Company's Presi- dent.   Every one of you, too,  he went on, leaning against his old flat-topped desk, with his thumbs thrust into his waistcoat, and looking around at the Clinches, who had all the office chairs  everyone, down to the youngster himself  Why, his applica- tion was the first I received after my young man failed, and every time Eve been in town since, he s turned up at my house.  The Colonel bowed silently, but his ten- der heart surrendered to his grandson's cause. As it was never the Company s policy to talk, if the other man would, Noonan continued without interruption:  I have been some time committin  my- self so many ah deserving applicants. But frankly, Eve about promised it to Stubbs s friends for his boy. You all re- member Stubbs, the engineer, who was killed on the South Western, when the Grays went on to the Inauguration   Telfair gave a sympathetic nod for the Company. Then he said casually,  I understand the Brotherhood is finding it difficult to fill his place. He was quite a local power here.  Noonan was a bit disconcerted. As he talked he had been wondering whether the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and the Grays or the Clinch Company would be better worth while.  Well, gentlemen, he said,after an awk- ward silence,   I can t quite go back on Stubbs s boy, but Em willin  to do this: Ell make the appointment competitive. The State University can manage it and then there s no kick cornin  from any- body.  Ill Pretty little Mrs. Clinch was inclined to agree with Mr. Noonan s epitome, as she sat the following June in the Naval Acade- my grounds, listening to the Marine Band discourse sweet airs to a perfect morning, and allowed her thoughts to flit hither and yon on the sprightly melody. Happy phan- toms of the past swarmed over the pebbled path of old Lover s Lane to meet still happier visions which she saw hovering over her boy. She had returned to the life of her girlhood, and had found a place re- served Tor her in that charmed circle which is as wide as all the world. So while Sallie Edney properly appreci- ated the present happiness of Sallie Clinch, she could not resist, as her eyes swept over the systematic orderliness of the yard  almost deserted now that the upper class men were cruising, and the June entrance for candidates was on a faint feeling of complacency that her own thinned family line had dominated her son s choice, not- withstanding the overwhelming influence against it on his father s side. It was pleasant to have the big powerful kinship to lean upon, but it was also pleasant to renew, through her boy, her old ties with the navy. Mrs. Clinch was in a mood to forget the disadvantages of the life and the changes about her changes that the under throb of machinery somewhere across the clipj ed greensward before her served as a reminder of work still in progress. She could even forgive the architecture of the massive new buildings and forget that their situa- tion cut off the breeze keenly sensitive this morning to the beauty of the water glimpses framed by the great tree boles bushy with ivy and the columns of the stately colonnade beyond. During this whole eventful year, which she had spent near her husband s work, nothing had given her more satisfaction than the Company s interest in young Dab- ney s winning the competitive for he had won, with Stubbs as first alternate, and a youth from one of the county towns as second. An interest, too, which had fol- lowed the boy s preliminary physical test, and had made necessary frequent  busi- ness  trips to Washington to watch over his course at a navy preparatory school. Sallie s heart warmed to all her dear in- laws,grateful even for old Aunt Georgiana's meddlesome insistence on heavier under- wear to meet the rigors of a Washington winter  which had brought her pages of protest from young Dabney , and for the extra pocket money his grandfather and He was sitting at his tabic with his bo  ks   pen before him  Page   j   grcat-undes had thought nec essary to sup- port the credit of the family, and about which he had said nothing. There was comfort, too, in the boy s own certainty. She had come to Annap- olis to see that he was  started right.  Only that morning, feeling a last poor scru- ple for the Clinch bias, she had asked,  Dabbie, is it worth it all all this    This,  in Sallie s summary, meaning the constant grind to absorb and exude facts which apparently could have no bearing on his career. And he had answered, "Is it  Why, when I see the lucky dogs who took the April and are safe, 1 can hardly wait till CLINCH is stencilled across a work blouse and I m inside it.  Sallie had rather expected he would take the April examinations; but he had  wanted to be so sure,  he had written his father  and after all, she had no nervous tremors over her son s success. All her life she had been accustomed to disciplined men who won out, not only because they did things, but because they realized their own limi- tations. The music ceased and eight bells jangled on the ships oil shore, followed quickly bv the more sonorous answer from the tower of the Academic building, where Dabney s morning grilling would soon be over. A sudden activity, accompanying the noon hour, took possession of the peaceful yard. Mrs. Clinch turned to watch for her boy. How provoking it was that so flimsy an excuse as summer gowns, and a long-prom- ised week-end at a friend's country house, should take her off to Baltimore in the morning. But she would be hack by Tues- day, when the names of lucky candidates might be posted. She saw them now coming out in lonely unsuccess or in animated groups discussing 627 02,s Stubbs s Principal and comparing the morning s work. It had been oik- of her pleasures, during these  juiet days, to note the " all-sortsness,  as she called it, of the American boy: to watch the easy unaffected comradeship and the refreshing generosity that prevailed be- tween principal and alternate. Sallie heard Dabney s whistle now the jovous one and responded by an answer- ing dip of her white parasol. She had meant to join him for a stroll in the yard, but saw that a tall, awkward boy, with a great shock of white hair,had accosted him, so she walked slowly on toward the Com- mandant s where she was due shortly for luncheon.   You re Clinch, ain t you   the boy had asked Dabney, offering a large freckled hand.  I m Stubbs, your alternate.  " Why, of course. 1 remember now see- ing you last summer at our competitive,  Dabney said cordially. "Been propping here    A little, but mostly I ve worked down home in the car shops and gone to night school. I couldn t afford to come here sooner, just on an alternate s chance.   Still, if an alternate passes, vou know he can enter with only a physical if there s another chance.  "But there isn't. I m over age in Aug- ust unless   Stubbs smiled, "you should fail." "We Clinches aren t that sort," Dabnev retorted, then something made him hold out his hand again. " Here s luck, anvhow, Stubbs  Perhaps we ll both get in." The poor little joke seemed to bring them closer.  Of course, the competitive was fairer, only  Stubbs paused and grew very red. "Only what " Dabney prompted.  You see, Clinch, 1 thought I d the ap pointment cold till Mr. Nooonan, for some reason, suddenly threw it open."   It s quite usual-   Oh, certainly it is. I've been trvin  for years to get a whack at one. It seems," he said wistfully, "as though pa had to die for me to get this far. But ain t it hard when there s some here grouchin  an  go ing in and everything looks so grand to me-  He saw Dabney smile, and looked a little shy. Then he laid his hand on Dabney s shoulder. "I m afraid, Clinch, vou can t understand. Why, I   vc never seen as much in all my life as I have since I left home a month ago  I have seen it all anyhow '1 he broke off with sudden fierceness and laughed. "But, oh you car shops.  Dabney laughed too then he said seri- ously. " 1 do understand though, Stubbs, because the appointment means everything to me   The boy looked relieved.  Then I'm glad, glad you re goin  in. You ll do the job more credit  n I could,  he said with a timid glance of admiration as he moved awkwardly away. Dabney stood for a moment and looked after his alternate, who had begun to whistle cheerily. But after he had reached his hotel, and in the early afternoon had started studying for the next day s examinations, it was not of the cheery whistle that he thought. He felt again the weight of Stubbs s earnest hand.   I ve never seen so much in all my life   Dabney, to use his own expression,  chucked it   for he could not study, and wandered down ancient King George Street to the other end of the yard. He liked the old parade grounds flanked on two sides by the officers  neat brick quarters at that hour in the afternoon when the youths he envied tumbled out in their work clothesfor a game of ball; when to the stirring meas- ures of the afternoon concert little children danced and capered, and the women s frocks made a bright patch of color on the weather-worn bleachers. But to-day he extracted no inspiration from the sight. Sterile breezes wafted from the water, the sky was less blue, the music blatant. He seemed to his mother very quiet, too, that evening the last they were to spend together for a few days and just before they separated for the night he asked sud- denly, "Mother, did the Clinch Company have anything to do with my appoint- ment      Why, you won a competitive examina- tion, dearie.    But was it made competitive because the Company asked for it    he persisted.  Well, of course, they all saw Mr. Noo- nan, Dab. That's what a congressman is for. Why    Oh, nothing.  He brushed her cheek hastily with his lips.  Good night, mother. I ve got to do a lot of work to-night.  Stubbs's Principal Mrs. Clinch fell asleep thinking of him, " Dab, dear." she tried  crossing to give hut some hours later awakened with the him a tender shake, - you must go to bed. startled feeling that something must he You'll he worth nothing to-morrow.

She slipped on her dressing gown, and crossing her sitting room, tapped on his bedroom door. There was no answer. She turned the knob softly and peeped in.

So had she seen his father look that year when an unexpected cave in in one of his tunnels had devoured the work of months. awake. Mumsey.    h. I ve fixed my alarm, and mv cold tub will set me up.  He was drawing her to the threshold.  Don t try to breakfast with me,  lie said authorita- tively, and gentlv   losed the door upon her. Sallie went back to bed. but not to sleep. She had known more than one boy "all in  from nervous strain :il the i lose ol these ex- aminations: but Dabnev was not nervous, only different. Perhaps that time had come to her when the thild exa  ts a firmer faith and obedience than motherhood ever demands. Sallie lay awake till dawn dis- Stubbs s Principal traught, puzzling. The sun was high when she awoke the second time, and Dabney had gone for the day s test. She was obliged to content herself with a note cau- tioning him about his hours, exercise, and fresh air, and went off to Baltimore with many misgivings. There, over anil over again during the dreary interval until Tuesday, she wished she had not left him. The separation brought her face to face with the dull fact that the days were all too few when he would be hers. Her plan was to linger on in Annapolis until he was called for his physical and then well, then of course, she would bring Marcia and the other girls on for the hops, and there was the second year s leave, but when he entered that ended it for mothers. The ride back from Baltimore had never seemed more tedious. Sallie had been stay- ing in Annapolis at an hotel whose beauti- ful eighteenth-century front faces a quiet street, while its brisk twentieth-century addition sprawls back to greet the noisy electrics as they rumble into town. As she alighted from the car and handed her bag to a porter she could not resist tripping around it was such a bit of a way  to the old gate to see Dabney s name posted. Sallie went on gayly, all her absurd qualms dissipated, pushing the future from her, thinking only of this dear present, happy in her boy s happiness glad for his gladness. Suddenly she passed two white faced boys. Her generous sympathy over- flowed to them.  Not posted, she thought.  Poor fellows   Inside the old gate she could see an un- feeling marine, pacing back and forth across the open entrance, unmindful of an eager group peering over each other s shoulders at the list of successful candidates put upon the guard house. Sallie slipped to the front of the crowd to see. And now that she was there, it occurred to her that James Stubbs s name seemed very promi- nent much more prominent  Well, she must begin now methodically. She heard a boyish chuckle.  I say, old Stubbsy s passed.   He did   Where   Well, he s no show anyhow Clinch-   Where the deuce is Clinch    Sh-h    I say, Clinch-   Oh, shut up, can t you   Sallie heard it all vaguely, vaguely knew that some rough boyish chivalry was aroused to her forlorn needs; but it was her unbe- lieving eyes eyes that read up and down, down and up, always seeking, but never seeing any other name than James Stubbs. She never knew how she got away, nor how she stumbled swiftly through the hot glare on up Maryland Avenue, taking the long way round to the hotel, past the dear old door-ways and half-hidden gardens  where she and Dabney had lingered  irrelevantly now murmuring over and over to herself the witticism of the Academy bard:  There s lots of things we ain t, Hut then you know we re quaint.  It did not surprise her to see the Colonel  was he not also   quaint     sitting out in front of the hotel, fanning himself leisurely with his Panama hat, but the sight of his strong, tranquil presence calmed her.  1 had to come to Washington on busi- ness, my dear,  he explained,   and couldn t resist shaking our boy s hand though Ef- fingham gives me a dinner at the Metro- politan Club, and I mustn t stay long   Sallie was choking. She could only force a smile.  How slow they are with this posting business  Dab s name wasn t up an hour ago. I reckon I ll step 'round there again-   Oh, don t, father, don t  she half sobbed, the whole sickening disappoint- ment overwhelming her anew. She mo- tioned him to follow her into the house.  Don t  Don t what   he whispered anxiously, hurrying after her. She turned to him miserably in the grate- ful coolness of a lonely corridor.  Father, they ore all posted,  she said in a shaky voice.  It means he hasn t passed " The Colonel drew her little trembling hand within his arm, and together they silently reached her sitting-room. Once there Sallie hurried from him through Dab- ney s doorway, the Colonel following. The boy was down on his knees throwing his belongings into a trunk. The whole room was in disorder.  Howdy, mother, grandfather   he called out, but he did not come to greet them, and although the     '-it arc the l rst  -f us to fall down in mathematics   voice was gay, the eyes that met theirs were hollowed and encircled by dark rings. All Sallie s baffled alarms returned.  What are you doing, Dabney   she faltered.  Packing up "  Packing  Packing   was grandfa- ther s measured query, as lie sat on the edge of the nearest chair piled high with books and clothing. The mother took a step or two toward her boy.   Oh, Dabney   she tried im- pulsively,  what does it all mean, dear "  I'm busted, Mumsey. Busted Friday in geometry,  he went on steadily, his eyes falling to gala neckties he was folding with great precision into a leather case.   I would have cleared out that night, but there was another exam Saturday which I pulled off. Besides,  he smiled ironically,  I waited for your congratulations.  Sallie gasped,  You Jailed  I thought maybe you were ill      You are the first of us to fall down in mathematics the first of us,  Grandfa- ther Clinch interrupted coldly.   How will you explain to your father all these wasted weeks of preparation     The boy shrugged.  Oh, I failed all right  You see, grandfather, it was the stiffest math any board has ever handed out-    But Janies Stubbs passed,  Sallie could not help saying, for she was ashamed of his unaccountable flippancy.  I saw his name.   Yes, and though lie s not much to look at, he's sure of his physical,  The boy bent low over his trunk.  Yes, Mumsey, Stubbs is sure in." There was a little quaver in his voice, which Sallie caught, as he said the last words. It contrasted oddly with his uh- seemlv bravado of the moment before. She leaped to it. Her eyes filled. He was her boy once more, just her little boy. She crossed to where he knelt and drew his head against her.  I won t think you couldn t, Dabney  You re keeping some- thing back  Surely I have the right-  He struggled from her and rose to his feet.  We all have the right, son," said his grandfather, gravely.  We are a united family, and the joy or sorrow of one of us is the jov or sorrow of us all.  631 In Memoriam  No one ought to know,  answered the boy sullenly.   I meant never to tell not even Marcia    Marcia  Already   thought Sallie.   Poor baby   But she only edged close up to him and said coaxingly,   Do say you could, Dabbie.   He smiled his assent down upon her up- turned face, all the old boyish love welling in his weary eyes.  But, Mumsev, it I had-   Stubbs   she queried.   Oh, Dabbie, dear "  1 don t seem to catch the drill,  began grandfather, hut his voice was husky. Dabney unwound his mother s arms, and strode over the littered lloor to the Colonel s side. His voice was eager, manly.   Stubbs had Noonan s promise, grandfather, till the Company interfered. But until 1 met him Thursday well, I didn t know it could mean so much.  Sallie had dried her eyes and was down before the trunk packing. Grandfather shook his head, but his face shone with a line enthusiasm.  You see, sir, I have the Company.   No, sir, I see a Clinch the Company can t use.  The old man mused a moment.

THE POINT OF VIEW- THE Duke of Wellington complained that he had been much afflicted with au- thors, and many a man could tell a moving tale of being sorely beset I  y reformers. Their high motives are not always a guarantee of good judgment or of agreeable companion- ship. 7eal too often consumes both them and their tact. One of their frequent ways of ap- proaching people whom they would enlist or convert is the assumption of a pitying compas- sion for those who are not altogether such as they are. They stoop to the ignorance and the moral failings of their unhappy victims. In their condescension to the infirmities On i Certain 0f men am  women who cannot see Condescension in . , . 111 Reformers eye to eye with themselves, they have an indefinable air of saying:  Were it not for your blindness, your timidity, your callousness, we should have pulled the world much further along by this time.  W ith Mil- ton they reproach the perversity and stubborn- ness but for which  the glory of reforming all our neighbors had been completely ours.  This condescending attitude of reformers often takes the form of deluging others with a flood of information usually statistical - about subjects in regard to which full knowl- edge is common propertv. They cannot be- lieve that you know what they know, else you would be as aflame and spasmodically ener- getic as they. Hence they bow their heads to your reluctant ear and pour into it without any of Mark Antony's rhetorical artifice that which you all do know.  Are you aware that two thousand seven hundred and sixty-five persons died in 1906 from heart failure caused by ex- cessive tea-drinking  Have you duly weighed the fact that three-sixteenths of the children of immigrants from Bessarabia have never had their teeth inspected   Do you know that only ninety-seven farm-houses in Oklahoma have a bath-room   The first inclination of one sud- denly assaulted with such chunks of fact is to say,   Yea, I know it, hold ye your peace   But one cannot be rude to a reformer. Besides, he could not be rebuffed in that way. If you shook off the dust of one set of his figures, lie would instantly tlee with you to another. He believes you ignorant, yet he believes you ductile; and persuaded that people are destroyed for lack ol knowledge, he proceeds to drop statistics upon them from his lofty mountain height. This is hard to endure, but harder is the re- former s superior way of supposing you torpid in sentiment anti sluggish in moral fervor. I5e- cause you Cannot, any more than Cordelia could, heave your heart into vour mouth, you are treated as if you hail no heart at all. Won- dering questions are put to you:  Have you no sympathy with the strugglcrs  Can you sit still while men and women anti children are held in the galling chains of poverty   Are you able to be cool anti articulate when discussing what to do for the victims of tlisease, the suffer- ers from crime, the waifs and strays of human- ity  Do not all our problems  fill you with a choking desire to do something to solve them    This moral condescension, it must be confessed, provokes a feeling of resentment, even in the best poised. Impetuous reformers ought to have some wise and firm friend to take them aside and tell them that the deepest sym- pathy i  not incompatible with cautious inquiry and a careful looking before anti after. Many a man, like Lowell, is conscious of the most in- tense yearning over his unfortunate fellow-men, yet is kept 011 principle from letting his feelings run away with his judgment. He cannot ac- cept the glib formulas or allow himself to be swept away by the gush of sentiment of the headlong. That they surpass him in human sympathy, he is ready indignantly to deny; he only insists that reason, experience, a study of causes and consequences, must be permitted tn  .reside over a rush of emotions. But the fevered and condescending reformer knows nothing of this. He .starts out with the as- sumption that tortured sensibilities are in themselves a virtue and a necessary part of re- form; and has nothing but mingled pity and scorn for those who cannot drink up Esel anti eat crocodiles. This certain condescension in reformers ranges freely over the whole field of practical operation. They would have you join every one of their societies without winking, and sub- scribe to all of their charities without a single inquiry about ways and means and results. That an organization exists, that an end is aimed at, ought to be enough for you; anti you 63j The Point of View put yourself al once in a lower order of human beings if you do not go with them enthusiasti- cally. Such an attitude as that of Huxley, making a scientific analysis of the organization and the work of the Salvation Armv, before ad- vising that it be heavily endowed, would seem to the kind of reformer under consideration both cruel and contemptible. If he is satisfied, it is pure effrontery in others to demur. If he can point you to hundreds of  good men  who go with him all the way, who arc you that you should hesitate   He would be angry with you if he was not overmastered with pity for you. Soon he will be forming a Society for the Com- pulsory Acceptance of Condescension. P ARODY is a genre frowned upon by your professors of literature. It shares some- thing of the contumely of melodrama and the dime novel; though these last literary forms seem nowadays to be  looking up.  And yet it is a gentle art. Even 1 have practised it, in youth. To be sure, it is only on condition of its seizing upon the sense and the temper - above all the temper of its original, that Parody is endurable. It is when the parodist seems to have got under the skin of his victim, like a midsummer harvest- Of Parody bug, that he achieves results worthy of all his pains. And it is because it is much easier to parody vocabulary merely, or jingle, that so few parodies attain to rial dis- tinction. Anyone can do his little best to cheapen the  Rubaivat  in imitating the swing of it; anyone can hit off Kipling at his most artificial or his least respectable. Any- one can write parodies of Walt Whitman in which the humor of the performance lies in lines as long as Mannahatta and as cacophonic as a locomotive in winter. But it is not everyone who can parody Whitman when lie thinks that he is writing original verse of his own. .Not everyone is equal to writing such lines as re- cently appeared in a magazine under the title  Saturday Night : trailing after too slavishly. The same sort of free adaptation is to be found in some of Mr. W. B. Yeats s less Celtic verses, where he lias more or less unwittingly parodied good William Wordsworth.  The Ballad of Moll Magee  is a case in point. Greatest among all the parodists, for the amusement they give us, are the parodists sans Ic savoir. Isn't there some candidate for the doctorate of philosophy who would consent to writing his dissertation on  Some Parodists of Themselves and Others   For it goes without saying that some have parodied themselves. Wordsworth and Ten- nyson both did this in blissful, egoistic uncon- sciousness; Swinburne did it with his eves open. Thackeray slyly parodied his own prose; George Bernard Shaw has thought it worth his while to parody his own plays or whatever you call those books of his. Hut Parody is essentially a critical exercise, and criticism of self is not often very happily car- ried off. It is to Calverley in the  Fly-leaves  that we turn for the best parodies in the Eng- lish language; and Calverley did not parody himself. Calverley s are the best, I say; and yet some of Lewis Carroll s are so good that most readers delight in their nonsense without ever guessing that they are admiring mere paro- dies.   Parody,  says Miss Carolyn Wells,  is a tribute to popularity, and consequently to merit of one sort or another, and in the hands of the initiate maybe considered a touchstone that proves true worth.  Perhaps that is why one entertains a much kinder feeling for paro- dists, even when they lay their sacrilegious hands upon a favorite poet, than for those persons who have put Malory into words of two syllables, and revised Sir Thomas More's  Utopia   for grown-ups, giving it a newer title. Here is another class of parodists sans Ic savoir; and a more hateful. Deliver us from the modern book-makers who, when they are not thus engaged in taking the bloom off good literature, are cutting it up into two-for- five sizes, and labelling the product the Wit and Wisdom of some immortal or other Wit and Wisdom, God save the mark  This ten- dency of little minds has more than once been glanced at by writers producing not for the world alone, nor solely for their bank-account. There is a petulantly humorous suggestion in one of the letters of Thomas Bailey Aldrich, whose letters are all so far as we yet know them touched with the charm of person- ality. It was Aldrich s idea that the poets  fame be drastically refreshed from time to time Tin  leather of the shoes In the brilliant casement sheet  a lustre over the heart; The high-heaped fruit in the flaring basement glows with the tints of Turner's art. . . . Thi  drab w.ish-woman dazed and breathless, rav- chi celled in the golden stream, I  a magic statue standing deathless her tub and soap-suds touched with dream. . . . Like all really excellent parodies, this set of verses is faithful in spirit to its original without 1 he Point of View by their translation into modern dialect. It was his conceit to turn the   Kve of St. Agnes  into Kiplingese.  Wouldn t it be delicious   "St. Hagnes Hcve  ow bloomin' chill it  v;is  The Howl, for .ill bis liulsti-r. was a-told. The 'are limped tremblin' through the blarsted grass,  Etc., etc.  I think, it might make Keats popular again,  the poet adds;  pour Keats, who didn t know any better than to write pure English." Professor Walter Raleigh has written that Parody is, for the most part, a weak and ding- ing tribute to the force of its original. Such a statement may be true of most of the prose parodies especially to sustained efforts- but I cannot assent to it as a generalization. Parody is, at its best, an example of both inter- pretative criticism and of appreciation. It i  creative as criticism, then, and as verse. Mr. Chesterton finds the proof that Bret Harte had the instinct of reverence in the fact that he was a consummate parodist. Whatever you may think of this remarkable dictum, it remains true enough that mere derision, mere contempt, never produced or can pro- duce a parody worth a rereading. This subtler sort of humor stands miles higher than the humor we ordinarily denominate American. "Parody,  says Mr. Chesterton and this time, at least, one may agree with him;  Paro- dy is the worshipper's half-holiday.  THE Dreamer leaned back in his easy chair and pointed across the valley at the slope of Stony Mountain, where late sunlight was turning to blazing gold the young birches that fringe the highest back pasture.  There,  he said,  there is Golconda, Arcady, The Land of Hearts  Desire  What might not one fairly expect to meet beyond that hedge of saplings  All the Court of Fairy Land, Ghost of Emperor and Crusader, souls of beautiful dead ladies, and those dearer spirits that are not dead because they lived not on earth but only in the mind of the master writer.

And, his musical voice quavered to a note of pensive sadness,  and, life is like that. Happiness, Beauty, they are phantoms of the dream world. Dreams are, in fact, the truest reality. It is only the actual that is unreal.  I le is always emittingsuch fioresccnt periods, is the Dreamer, but the rainbow-tinted fancies evaporate before he makes them permanent with pen and ink. Perhaps he plans it so, perhaps he shrinks from having the children of his fancy torn from their native ether to be vulgarized for the public. His mind is a curi- ous development as if he formed il chiefly on Shelley and Matthew Arnold part elegiac melancholy, part hectic aspiration for the upper air. I le yearns but he does not wish to grasp, lesi even Ill's loving hands should destroy the bloom of charm. 1 le prizes what is untouched, rare, remote, elusive. Love, for him, is a thing of hints and intuitions, of shy, guarded glances, of reverent distance: contact is prof- anation. 1 like to listen to the Dreamer and ruminate over his strange views. They arc in great measure the outcome of his way of life, of too much pondering with too little action, of long sedentary empty hours without appointed task. I cannot deny that many of his doctrines are drawn front the most ethereal of poets. I dare not argue with him, for he could overwhelm me with quotations, yet for the life of me I cannot manage to see the world as he does. To me lull knowledge seems necessary for perfect love, nor do I understand how intimacy can tarnish affection unless the object is unworthy or the affection insincere. I, too, love those woods at which lie gazes, longing yet aloof, but I love them because I know them. I have summered them and wintered them. I have lain in their shade when the valley was parched in midsummer, 1 have huddled close to a fire of their dead branches, my back to a driving sleet storm. I have walked every foot of them from the line chased portal of white birch, through aisles of beech and oak, to the solemn spruce wood  the crowning choir at the sum- mit. I know them alien and forbidding when a silent cloud darkens the sun and the heart of Nature stops beating in a primeval hush, but I know them too well to fancy this their only mood. I know them best as I find them most often good companions and I peel birch- bark for kindling and cut spruce branches for mv camp bed with the confident matter-of- fact feeling with which I would borrow half a dollar from a close friend. I imagine the Dreamer wincing with pain at such a confession, yet I cannot believe 1 alto- gether deserve the  beef-stuffed materialist  The Point of View of his scornful epithet. He cannot keep 'I'itian all to himself; he must share Beetho- ven with me; my ear, like his, is tuned to hear the throbbing 'cello notes in Milton s sym- phony; I, too, have caught mv breath before the lofty majesty of Antwerp s tower; I, too, have exulted in the frozen sea-foam of Rouen, l or beauty itself, 1 reverence as fervently as he; it is his attitude toward beauty which I do not share. I dissent from the doctrine that one must not have too much of what is lovely: 1 would still worship the Winged Victory if 1 were an attendant in the Louvre, and I have eyes for beauty in its humblest, most every- day manifestations. The unpainted picket fence of the side-road cottage, the sagging gate, the chip-strewn path, the naively plotted flower bed, even that uncompromising packing-box, the house itself; all this has a homely sort of beauty that tugs at my heart as strongly as the swaying colonnade on Stonv Mountain. The Dreamer for his part dissents just as forcibly from my view. He will not approach what he loves, and disdains what is close to him. He calls the world about him garish and vulgar, and supposes that I must be too dull to perceive the liner transcending shades that alone seem to him to deserve the name of beauty. It may be this is so, nevertheless I would not change places with him. 1 would rather do without the  unsubstantial pageant of his vision" than lose my own sure conviction that this kind earth is home. But the more I come to know him, the less I incline to accept this explanation. He ad- vances it, as he has adopted the rest of his lesthetk philosophy, because it harmonizes with his temperament. The truth seems rather to be that the Dreamer himself has stood so much on his dignity with the world that in spite of all his cultivation he has never contrived to see beneath the surface aspect of beauty. If be would only once throw open his soul, give up the aloofness that has its root in pride, cease to prefer his brain-spun fancies to the v ital life about him, he would lose none of his delicate appreciation, he would gain the empire of the real world in which the common is beautiful and beauty is warm and human. He would learn that our lean sardonic farmers have a charm and a picturesque value even though they wear overalls instead of sashes and wooden shoes, that under their shell of Indian stoicism they have the passions of any fiery Andalusian. He would see in a sudden flash that an Italian peasant is more than a color harmony; that he also is a man for all the world like the men at home. He would learn that even a factory town is not a desert. He would never again feel himself an outsider anywhere. In the remotest countries he would stand upon the same old earth. Until at last lie would understand that beauty does not dwell far off among the rocks but is in everything waiting for the seeing eye, just as for the open heart not only every man but every thing is a blood relation. There is an intimate feeling to the morning air. Trees along the road shake hands with the wayfarer, meditating cows wish him good- morning. rejoicing brooks set him thrilling with the pulse of the world, the very boulders silently brooding in the sunlight claim with him a cousinship distant but traceable. Nature's manners are not, after all, unlike those of men. For her lovers she has a kiss; for her friends a warm handshake; and for unrepentant Dream- ers a formal bow across the width of the valley.  THE FIELD OF A RT H - SOA P COX 7- .W 'I'A .IA   VO   V ; Il M.I A   SCl LPTOKS CERTAIN manifestations and tenden- cies of any contemporary art at any given period force themselves on the perception not only of the general reviewer hut even of the individ- ual artist. The lat- ter, however, is apt to be absorbed in his own particular ideals  orabsenceof them , and to be keenly in- terested in those of his fellows only when they interfere too ag- gressively with his own particular wel- fare. Thus, in the present state of the art of sculpture in these United States  a truly flourishing art , there may be said to be at least two of these nota- ble facts the great number of foreign names among the men, and the surprising number of young women who have attained eminence. Even when too much importance is not attached to the old-fashioned conceptions of social relations this latter fact is interesting; the sculptor's concern with pure form  speaking broadly  rather than with the suaver, subtler, more luxurious presentation, the peculiar beauty and suggestiveness of color and tone and  en- velope" attainable in painting and even in embroidery, his comparatively unpleasant, it not ungrateful, material to work in, even the not altogether unimportant effects of his man- ual labor  "I have looked at my husband's hands at a dinner party with deep concern," said the wife of one of the foremost sculp- tors,  and I knew he had spent unlimited scrubbing upon them" , all these might be con- sidered as affecting the choice of this arduous profession. For, after all, as one of our most distinguished educators recently said, in sum- Vol. XLVII  65 ming up a learned debate on the Problem:  A man is still a man, and a woman, a woman.  In proof of whic h there may apparently be found some distinguishing traits in the work of these talented ladies, fur the comfort of those who hold in abhorrence that confounding of sexes now threatened in some quarters. To begin, it is asserted  at least by the men  that very few of them manifest a real ap- titude for big and monumental out-of- doors work; it is even said that none of them has ever been able to produce a masculine figure that looked like a real male man. Mr. Lorado Taft, in his history of American sculpture which may be accepted as the present standard work, makes a par- tial exception to this sweeping assertion in the case of Mrs. Theodora Ruggles Kitson s statue of "The Volunteer,  erected as a sol- diers  monument at Wwburyport, Mass., in i  02 "If not a powerful man, the Volunteer is at least a most satisfactory representation of adolescent youth.  In the matter of mascu- line portrait busts it is admitted that several pairs of feminine hands have excelled per- haps all the more in that they have been in- spired bv a most subtle and truth-finding femi- nine sympathy and instinct. Of the general artistic qualities there is one not so common as it should be in which several of them excel: that of rendering with real delicacy and charm the nude female figure. In still another im- portant detail which also was, perhaps, to be looked for they have justified their sex: their  keen appreciation of the sensuously beauti- ful  very seldom leads them to ignore consid- erations of artistic good taste. If at times they fall into the must heinous of artistic sins, the 637 The Field of Art commonplace, so  lo, at times, very nearly all the artists that ever were Korn. W ith that verv decided change in the con- ception and appreciation of sculpture which has liccn manifest within the last thirty years, they have been apparently in full sym- pathy Nn one is farther away from those line old movements, the  classic" and the  romantic.  It i  surprising how little they have to do even with the sweetlv sentimental.   Mi the other hand, they have widely extended the range of their art any theme,or no theme, w ill alford them opportunity for a little figure or group in which will be revealed to the sympathetic something al- most impalpable, but mov- ing This reliance upon the quick svmpat' v and intelli- gence of the audience is one of the modern developments in art: and is encouraging. No longer is it necessary t   have recourse to the old academic and literary subjects to awake a responsive chord, nor to any demonstration by mere bulk, or obtrusive- ness of technical detail and finish.   scrap of bronze or plaster, not too big for a paper- weight, will reveal these excellences, in th _  work of several of the living American sculp tors, men and women.

A w ider field is covered by the work of some of the others Miss Abastenia St. Leger Kberle, Mrs. Kdith Wood- man Burroughs, Miss Janet Seudder, Mrs. Gail Sherman     irlictt, NI rs. Theodora Rug- gles Kitson, Mrs. Caroline Peddle Ball, Mrs. Carrol Brooks MacNeil, Miss Eve- lyn B. Longman, Miss Helen Farnsworth Mears.

The rendering of motion especially appeals to her, the appreciation of mass and form, with but little concern for the merely picturesque.  If I were a painter,  she says, "1 would be an Impressionist."  t the great exhibition of the National Sculpture Society in the armory in Baltimore in April, moS, Mrs. Burroughs exhibited a little bronze o  a nude young girl Iving on a din overlooking I he  Summer Sea," and the sum- mer sea, which of course was not represented at all, was suggested by something in the grace and pose of the figure. At the Academy ex- hibition in this city last year  1900 , she pre- sented a marble bust,   Scvlla," which was dis- quieting and mysterious; and at another ex- hibition a little "Leda" sealed on the ground, The Field of Art E -L V T1 I Hiet-tM HARM SA F A Mi  j  EWORTH Portrait  .f my nn-tlicr 1   Mi - llelcn I Mi ll' which was charming. In all these productions the fine quality of what we mav call the Ivric subjectivism is noticeable because of its fine- ness, its delicacy; modern plastic art at its very best has seldom any big, robustious passion to express, and seeks other methods to give vent to its emotions than by vulgar grimaces of delight, or Primitive or Gothic grimaces of s irrow or woe with st lid tears on the cheek. Perhaps it is a development of that quicker interest in psychic communications which is thought to be slowly overcoming a sceptical and materialistic age  In the larger, decorative, work for interiors, court-yards, etc , sev- eral of these ladies have shown great technical skill and a very pretty invention. Miss Janet Scud- der, two of whose medallion por- traits are in the Luxembourg, has one of the best of her cherubic bronze fountain figures in the Met- ropolitan Museum, a dancing Water Baby. The most important of Miss Scudder s monumental work is probably the figure of Jap- anese Art, recently mounted among the first thirty statues on the cor- nice of the Brooklyn Institute of Arts and Sciences- she being the only woman among the contribut- ing sculptors. Mrs. Caroline Ped- dle Ball sometimes carries out large architectural and monumental work, as the nursery chimney- piece, with old satyrs for carya- tides, which she has just com- pleted; the four corbels for a Brooklyn church; the figure of a maid with a basket of fruit, for a garden gate, exhibited two years ago, etc.; but she also does little groups and relie s, occasitmall v in iv   rv,   if nrt. it hers, or mothers and children, some- times decorative and imagina- tive, and sometimes individual portraits; and she prefers, dis- tinctly, not to be known as "a specialist.  In the rendering of verv young infants, babies and such, there are so many who have achieved reputation that the list is too long for our spac  . In portraiture there occasion- ally appears a work of surpris- ing excellence, as Mis. Burroughs s bust of John I.a l arge, his fingers on his cheek, seen at the New York and Pennsylvania Acad- emies' exhibitions in I ;og. Miss l.berle has recently completed a   ortrait bust, to be car- ried out in marble, in which she seems t   have given not only the actress in the leading role, but something like the soul of ill   tragedy itself; Miss Mears. a bronze luist of I  r.

Said one of the By Miss Ai..wteni.i leading sculptors lately:  If we men do not look out, we may be pushed from our stools by the women   All the more, perhaps, in that many of the latter have executed important monumental work. The commission for the bronze doors of the chapel of the Naval Academy at Annapolis, set in place in the summer of iqog, was awarded to Miss Longman, at a public competition held three years before; Mrs. Sallie James Fam- ham is just completing an elaborate sculptured frieze for the new building of the Bureau of American Re- publics in Washington; the memorial statue of Frances E. Willard, by Miss Mears, for the Capitol at Wash- ington, will be the first statue of a woman, by a woman, to be placed in that building; of the two seated figures at the base of the I lamilton S. White Memorial in Syracuse, N. Y., by Mrs. Corbett, that of the Fireman will seem to many to go far to lay M r. Taft s doubts as to the   real man   from a wom- an's hands. An extensive movement has been set on foot in the South t    erect in every State a monu- ment to Southern Woman- hood, and the model of Miss Belle Kinney, formerly of Nashville, Tenn., but now of Chicago, has been adopted by several of the common- wealths. Pittsburg proudly st i t-cr i-i'cric. records the decorative and portrait work of Miss Sue E. Watson, aged eighteen. In the study of ani- mals there have not been many competitors; Miss Anna Vaughn Hyatt was one of the earliest and most distinguished; Miss Grace Mott Johnson has shown some small but accurate and spirited pieces at recent ex- hibitions, as has Miss Leila Audubon Wheel- ock, like Miss Watson still in her  teens. In a field in which the workers are, as yet, but few, but in which the harvest is ready that of giving an artistic value to the domestic utensils and minor household furnish- ings several of these la- dies, as Mrs. MacNeil and Miss Lucy F. Perkins, have earned our gratitude. William Walton.

The whole Bell System is on duty 1440 minutes a day and if any of these minutes are not used, their earning power is irrevocably lost. Like the Police Force or the Fire Department, the telephone is not always working but it is always on duty and always costing money. But you would not be satisfied with the fire department if your burning house had to take its turn; nor with the police force if you had to wait in line to receive protection. You want service at once. That is exactly what the Bell System endeavors to give you immediate attention, instantaneous service. It strives to be always ready to receive your call at any point, and connect you with any other point without postponement or delay. It would be much cheaper if tele- phone customers would be content to stand in line, or if their commun- ications could be piled up to be sent during slack hours; or if the demand was so distributed as to keep the whole system comfortably busy for 1440 consecutive minutes a day.

ANTONIUS STRADIVARIUS made a better violin because he knew the violin. Melville Clark knows the player piano. In the music trades his personal supremacy in the field of pneumatics is un- questioned. Recently the entire player piano industry paid a remarkable tribute to his genius in adopting the 88-note  complete keyboard  principle, which for eight years was exclusively an Apollo feature. Other Apollo features  invented and pat- ented by Melville Clark  are: Apollo Human Touch The pneumatic fingers of the Apollo 88-Note Player Piano strike Down on Top of the keys, just as the human fingers do in manual playing. Other players strike UP on the sticker of the action, or Under the keys at the back. Both of these methods are unnatural and are the cause of the unnatural, mechanical music produced by other player pianos. Apollo Self-acting Motor A patented motor that runs the music roll and rewinds it without pumping or electricity. Other players are equipped with air motors which necessitate tiresome pedaling. The Apollo s self-acting motor costs five times as much to manufacture as the old style leather-and-wood air motor. Solo-Apollo Accenting Device   The latest triumph of Melville Clark and the climax in the development of the Apollo Player Piano toward an ideal. The Solo-Apollo actually em- phasizes the melody as a virile idea of the com- poser, and as he intended it to be emphasized. More Apollos In Use Notwithstanding the Apollo costs $25 to $50 more than ordin- ary player pianos, there are more 88-note Apollo Player Pianos and Piano Players in use than all other similar instruments combined. There are only three player pianos made that can even lay claim to being artistic. Write for descriptive literature and a simple, sure method by which you can decide the player piano question.

Two in- teresting points are emphasized by this incident: 1st Superior Construction 2nd Universal Leadership  This is ihe interior of Australia," writes our Australian manager,  and their temperatures in summer run up as high as 120 degrees in the shade, and 170 and 1S0 degrees in the sun. We have several instruments in such localities, some having been there fur the past seven or eight years.   During that time we have never had a complaint and the instru- ments have never given any trouble whatever. I can assure you that if the construction of the PIANOLA was in the slightest degree defective, we would not be able to cairy on business in a country such as this, for it would be literally impossible to keep these instruments in order.  It  '.   significant that in Australia the PIANOLA practically has the field to itself. I11 ex cry country of the w orld in South America, in Europe, in the Far hast ihe PIANOLA completely dominates the Piano-player field. There has never been an article of American manufacture which has more conspicuously held its leadership. In some countries there is a prejudice against goods of foreign man- ufacture. Also, some Players made in European countries are sold at less than halj the PIANOLA S price.

Many exam- ples of Sheraton s own workmanship have been continuously in use since they left his master hand late in the 18th Century. These illustrations of Mayhew Furniture in the designs of Sheraton are suggestive of the artistic cliarru of the furniture. Through two generations the Mayhews have insisted upon absolute fidelity to good designs and equally upon the strictest integrity in manufacture. The result is the general acceptance of Alay- hew Furniture as a standard. Dealers in all important cities will gladly show you these and nianyother examples in a way to demonstrate the difference between Mayhew furniture and ordinary commercial reproductions.

Paint made of these two standard materials has the exclusive peculiarity of "flowing to- gether," and such paint gives a durable, beautiful surface, free from brush marks. To be sure of purity and quality in white lead, look for the  Dutch Boy Painter" trade-mark on the side of the steel keg.

But you may have found that it does not like you. What s the trouble  Two troubles coffee chaff, and coffee dust. Chaff is seen in any common ground coffee fine, white flakes. It is weedy, astringent, much like oak leaves, and will actually tan leather. Not good fur the coffee flavor, or the human system. Dust is the result of grinding or crushing the coffee beans in a mill. Brewing brings the extreme bitter- ness and tannin out of these fine particles before the larger grains are fully brewed. And the indigestible dust floats and passes into the stomach. Barringtoirtlall Coffee The chaff is removed from Baker-ized Coffee. Look at it and sec. Steel-cutting is done by sharp knives not crushing the coffee beans, but dividing them into granules of uniform size with no dust. The result is greater wholesomeness and economy. Wholesomeness, because you can brew these uniform granules to the exai t strength desired, without over- steeping any of them. Economy, because you get the full strength of each granule no large grains to waste by under-drawing. A pound of Baker-ized Coffee will make 15 lo 20 cups more than a pound of mill-ground coffee.

It is a notable production a veritable text-book on farm lien securities. Ask us to send your copy just from the press. Drainage and Irrigation Bonds have attained a high place with a well-informed class   f investors. We have thousands of customers who consider them the most desirable bonds that we handle. They are secured by first liens on good farm land sometimes a thousand farms. And the liens rarely exceed one-fourth the land   value. They are additionally secured by a first mortgage on all the property in which the proceeds of the bonds are invested. Thus they combine corporate management and responsibility with farm lien security. The bonds are for Sioo, S500 and Si.000, so they appeal to small investors ami large. The maturi- ties run from one to twenty years, so one may in- vest for any time that he chooses. The interest rate is six per cent a desirable rale in these days of high prices. A knowledge of the facts regarding these ideal securities is important to every investor. A Wide Choice Reclamation Bonds indude Drainage anil Irri- gation, and they offer a wide choice in each. Some are based on the rich Delta Lands of the South, and some on the most productive lands in the West. Some are Corporation Bonds secured by first liens on land where one crop will often pav the whole debt. Some are Municipal issues which form, as do School Bonds, a tax lien on an organised di.-trii t. Some are  Carev Act  Bonds, where the State supervises the project. AH are serial bonds, part of which are paid annually, so the security constantly increases. As the farmer controls his own water supply, the land is not subject to crop failures. They who know the facts, as told in our book, will find it hard to conceive of any better security. How Selected Our book also explains our extreme care in se- lecting the Reclamation Bonds that we buy. It names engineers and attorneys of national fame whom we employ to investigate projects. It tells how water supply, rainfall and drainage area are determined by Government records. Al-o how soils are analyzed so we may know their exai t fertility. It tells how we keep Ln touch with the best of these projects. How an officer of our Company al- most constantly travels in sections where land is re- claimed. And how we are thus able to select for our customers the cream of these securities. Wide Experience In the past 16 years we have bought and sold 78 separate pieces of Drainage and Irrigation Bonds. This l ook names them all. No investor has lost a dollar through default in interest or principal. We are very large purchasers of Reclamation Bonds, so we are naturally in touch with every phase of this subject. Our wide experience and accurate knowledge make our book of decided interest. And every in- vestor owes to himself a knowledge of these facts. Cut out this coupon as a reminder to ask us to mail this book. ofrewfridge First National Bank Building, Chicago Also New York.

Safety of Principal and Interest is the chief consideration in the purchase of securities. Interest yield is the second. Assurance of safety depends largely upon the responsibility of the investment house  and this feature cannot be too strongly em- phasized. In all its years of business in the sale of sound securities, this house has never sold a bond upon which the payment of either principal or interest has ever been delayed a single day. One feature of the unusual safety which characterizes all of the investments handled by this house municipal, public utility, irrigation and water works bonds is the fact that many of the two latter classes are doubly secured  First by the usual customary and ample liens, and second by the guarantee of the American Water Works   Guarantee Com- pany, the capital and surplus of which is four and a half million dollars. This com- pany is an operating, owning and controlling organization which has been in business over a quarter of a century.

At all times and under all con- ditions it is noiseless, absolutely free from vibration, smokeless and odorless. It is easiest on tires. It has unequalled hill-climbing ability. The engine can never be  stalled.  It is by far the easiest car to control and it is, therefore, the safest car for passengers as well as for other users of the highway. Either kerosene or gasoline may be used as fuel. The development of the White Steam Car the perfection of details, simplification of parts, etc. has gone on steadily from year to year. As a result, the 1910 W hite Steamer represents as great an advance over the steam car of a few years ago, as does the 1910 White Gaso- line Car compared with gasoline cars designed several years ago. During the last ten months from July 1st to date more W hite Steamers have been made and delivered to customers than in the corresponding period of any previous year. Are you familiar with the many desirable features of the 1910 White Steam Car   A postal to us brings a copy of our catalog.

And, reverse- ly, that any car at a lower price is not quite so good. When a buyer thinks that he does himself the worse injus- tice. Because he  pays too much for his whistle.        Price never makes quality. To be sure, you can t get $3000 quality for $735. The proposi- tion is deeper than that.       We have proved that a six- cylinder car of ample power and of first quality in every respect can be marketed at $3000. And still return us a reasonable profit.       Yet this price is from $1000 to $2000 lower than is asked for cars of similar power and size, made by other accredited mak- ers. The inference is, sometimes  when the buyer doesn t know the facts , that the quality of the Winton Six isn t quite all we claim and that the car must lack something, else we would ask as much as other makers do.       But the actual fact is that these other makers would be only too glad to reduce their prices to  e Winton Six figure of $3000, tfthey could. Because we have a tremen- dous selling advantage in our price.       When a prospect once knows what the Winton Six isand what it does, there isn t the slightest chance for a competitor to sell him another car at a higher price.       But these other makers can t equal our quality at our price. Because we have advantages which they lack. TheWinton Company has had years more experience than any other maker. Has been making sixes exclusively longer than any other maker. The only high-grade house whose presi- dent is its manufacturing head. The only high-grade company owning its own plant and equip- ment scot free from debt and heavy interest charges. A com- pany that cuts out racing, tour- ing and  stunt  expenses, and has no water in its stock. A company that avoids marble- front expenses on automobile row. That avoids waste and red tape in its factory. That buys for cash and takes the cash discount. These are Winton advan- tages, and Winton Six buyers get the benefit.       When you buy other makes at higher prices, you pay for ex- travagances and extraordinary expenses that do not help the quality of such cars a single par- ticle. Consequently, when you pay more than $3000 for a car of power and size similar to the 48 H. P. Winton Six, don t imagine that you are getting that much better car. For you can prove that idea false by putting the Winton Six to the test alongside this higher- priced car.       On the contrary, you can fig- ure the difference in price, and say:  I am paying this difference of, say, $1500 additional to the Blank Company for its extrava- gant practices, its bonded in- debtedness, and its handicaps.  An empty satisfaction to which the buyer is fully entitled when he pays 50 per cent more than the car itself is worth.

It is not surprising, therefore, that the man in search of a good oil becomes confused and takes the first thing that comes to hand. Here is the whole thing in a nutshell. A cylinder oil is required to do two things  lubricate, and bum up cleanly. All first- class oils will lubricate very few will burn up cleanly they contain too much carbon. Carbon is removed from oil by filtration. The more completely an oil has been filtered, the cleaner it will bum. Filtered oils can readily be distinguished by their lighter and clearer colors. HAVOLINE OIL is the most highly filtered oil made in this country. You can see this for yourself by simply looking at it. It contains less free carbon than any other, and its use will result in cleaner cylinders and spark plugs, and less trouble all around. Many automobile manufacturers use and recommend Havoline Oils. Most of the owners of high-class cars will use nothing else. Try it on your own car it costs no more than other oils, and gives infinitely better results.  It Makes a Difference  If your dealer does not handle Havoline Oil, write to us at any of our branches.

The Overland was designed after time had proved what devices were best and what mode of construction in every part of a car. But a new engine was made an engine more simple, more trouble-proof, more automatic than any before devised. And that faithful engine has done more than all else to bring    verland curs to the top. The number of parts in the car were immensely reduced. One part now used in the    verland alone lakes the place of 47. Then the pedal control was devised. To go back- ward or forward, fast or slow, one simply pushes pedals. The hands have nothing to do but steer. As a result, a child can master the car in ten minutes. And the car almost cares for itself. 25 h. p. $1,000 The Overland is made by the latest automatic machinery just like the finest watches. Thus we get exactness to the ten thousandth part of an inch. And the cost is immensely reduced under old methods. Our multiplied production now 140 cars daily has cut our making cost 20 per cent within the past year alone. Thus the Overland gives a great deal more than any other car for the money. The 25-horsepower Overland, with a 102-inch wheel base, sells for 81, KM . It is the first real automobile ever made at that price. A 40-horsepower Overland, with 112-inch wheel base, sells for s 1,2 50. And the sl.oOO Overland has many advantages over cars costing twice the price. The Popular Car The Overland one of the newest creations has come to outsell the oldest cars on the market.
