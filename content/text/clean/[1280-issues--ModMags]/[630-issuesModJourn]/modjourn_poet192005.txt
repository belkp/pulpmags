fete day of San Domingo The saint s wooden image having been venerated in the church of the pueblo the procession now emerges carrying it into the plaza  DANCE Domingo dance Give him a leaf of corn in his hand Rub him with blue corn juice His legs his hands his arms  The black horse and the ochre horse Were prancing on the front wall Of the little mission The dark red boy sat upon the roof Waiting for the first gunshot  To strike the hammer on the bell   With ribbons they brought together The new brides and bridegrooms of the year  Fantastically they rose from the kiva The koshare with cornhusks on their heads Cornhusks of the year that is gone  Rabbit s fur for girdles Orange corn for necklaces Turtle shells sea shells and ox toes Made music like juvenile zylophones  In the wind Their bodies were naked but for the breech cloth  Dance Domingo dance Give him a leaf of corn in his hand Rub him with blue corn juice his legs His hands his arms  They came with the shot of the gun  From the church bearing Domingo  Under a blue calico canopy  Priests in robes acolytes in overalls  Little red acolytes with bluebottle hair  From the kiva side the drums began to beat  Men of the chorus were gathering  They sang in unison resembling old choir boys  In the organ loft of the mountain tops  One by one the youths of the Domingos   Came up out of the kiva s mouth Beautiful as young girls at maypole time Their hair combed and oiled with bear s oil All the way to their waists  Jet with the reflection Of eagles eyes upon it Jet with morning blisses reflected Black rivers of young hair striped with rows of blue corn  A girl a boy a girl a boy a girl A man a boy a man a boy a man Long lines of wondrous dark flesh Turning toward the ash gold dancing place  Pom pom pom pom pom pom pom  The rawhide drum was muttering as the macaw Feathers of the ceremonial rod waved  In the summer wind Crimson macaw tails and a coyote s skin Were trembling to the aria of the young corn  They sat him down the still Domingo Of the wooden soul and the stove pipe halo Gilded with store bronze  Give him a leaf of corn in his hand Let him dance Dance Domingo dance Jesus won t care For a little while   Up the long plaza step by step with red man syncopations  In their ears their red feet trod the way coercing The adolescent corn They want the young corn breasts to fill with young milk They want the ear to hang heavy with orange and blue milk  It is you they are singing for young corn It is for you they are dancing the red young bodies flushing with an old flame of the sunset The red of the west is coming up out of their loins up out of their boyish and girlish breast flanks Red sparks are falling from their carved lips  Dance Domingo dance  Rock the young Jesus to sleep  Lay him down under a candle  He ll drowse and fall to dreams with the thud thud  Of the beautiful red feet on an ash gold earth  Green corn leaves evergreen leaves ox toes turtle shells sea shells and young bells ringing at their knees There s the pagan hymn for the ragged Christ child  Mary is picking field flowers on the edge of her blue robe behind the adobe wall of the church Domingo sits under his calico canopy waiting for oblations You lovely red boy pick the paint from his cheeks and let the old smile through to the sun The sun will crush his lips Domingo wants to dance children of the flaming west  Domingo opens his wooden eyes   Beat of the tom tom in my ears Thud thud of multitudinous red feet on my solar plexus Red fire burning my very eyelids with young red heats The last saps of the red man are pouring down my thighs and arms The young red blood is dripping from the flanks of laughing red bodies aching with the sensuousness of the passing pagan hour  The blue milk is rising in the cornfields Can t you hear it rising like new fountains from the old mother breast Can t you see the little trees of blue milk spreading their branches on the sunlit air  Sky blue and corn blue are mingling  Their kisses like the rainbow edges  Of a whirling spectroscope  Blue prisms dangling from red bodies  Blue corn juice dripping drop by drop  Over the edge of luscious young red lips  The mother is granting her favors The father is blessing his corn children with celestial fermentations Blue milk is rising from the ground pouring up through the cornstalk fountains dripping from young corn leaves Red lips are spreading trumpet flowers ready to catch the corn juice as it falls  Statures are increasing The red man boy is growing an inch taller before my eyes Something is coming up out of his ruddy breast and thighs and arms   Something is reaching out over him It is the blue coin juice His mother is pouring over him Soon there will be ribbons of new Marriages stretched in front of the altar rail  The old choristers are singing In the organ loft of the mountain tops All the valleys are in unison with the thud thud Of multitudinous red feet  The Jesus child is smiling under the candle At the feet of Domingo of the wooden cheeks  1 saw you dance Domingo I saw them rub blue corn juice on your legs and hands and feet I saw you step down from out the candle branches I saw your heavy feet grow light when the red boy smiled you away from your calico canopy  Dream little Jesus child The sunlight from little candles helps the pagan dream The red boy laughs your grief away with his young luscious body The fountain is filled with the blue juice of the corn  Domingo nods with heaviness again Straighten my stovepipe halo once more Take up the posts of my calico canopy Carry me to the altar again Back to the Nottingham lace curtains And the blue robes of Mary   The Jesus child is waking Stick the old pap in his mouth The pap with the milk that is grey  ESPAÑOL  See him pass Señoritas  In his eyes are crisp shadows Of doorways from the Alhambra Clipped with sunlight  Habaneras come from Lillas Pastia s Tavern as he saunters by From Pastia s window in the moonlight  I have seen the bull ring in the pupils Of his eyes Calm cool crowds women arranging their mantillas Throwing kisses to their beloved matador Over the ring side  I have seen thunder storms on the hills of Toledo Lightning striking the Escorial I have seen the fandango when he smiled  These are all for you Señoritas   GIRL WITH THE CAMELIA SMILE  Eyes  Little vanity mirrors From Damascus Her hair  Is a packet of love letters Burned to a crisp on the Sunday Morning of a sad young man Gowned one way a maple leaf Bitten with frost lips Whisked from the last boughs  Of October The last wild leaf fierce with autumnal ecstasies  He was one wind who danced with her The sad young Sunday morning man He had seen her gathering  Shell flowers On a brown sea s edge Before the moon had withered  THE TOPAZ OF THE SIXTIES  In the little tired spring Weary with the years of bubbling Deep down to where the gold sand comes to light Again   I see wreaths and wreaths of smiles L amour quand même The gold bird in the cage exclaims L amour quand même reiterates the lark To the dahlias and the petunia buds  In the garden L amour quand même  Sings the nightingale in the plum boughs Where the clematis shuts the window in With fragrant fringe  Once it was a precious stone  Long long ago  THE ASSES OUT HOUSE  Three flies lay sleeping  In a cobweb shroud  Dreaming of molasses of jam  And of heaps of offal  The fourth swung by his ear  He was a withering fokker  On its last tail spin  His body was bluebottle His wings were grey   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  As his cobweb shroud Stitched with prism hues  He was dreaming of old bones On which to rear his young  TO C  I  If a clear delight visits you Of an uncertain afternoon When you thought the time For new delights was over for that day Say to yourself who rule many a lost Moment in this shadowy domain Saving it from its dusty grey perdition Say to yourself that is a flash Of lightning from a so affectionate west Where the clear sky that you know resides The rainbow has crossed the desert once again Í took the blade of bliss and notched it In a roseate place It shed a crimson stream That was our flush of joy  II  They will come In the way they always come   Marsden Hartley  Swinging gilded fancies round your head So it is with surfaces  They will walk around you Adoringly Strip branches of their blooms for you Young carpets for young ways  With me it is different  Stars when they strike Edge to edge Make fierce resplendent fire I have lived with bright stone Burned like carnelian in the sun Myself Myself seen branches wither  Carbon is a diamond It cuts the very crystal from the globe  You are so beautiful To listen  SATURDAY  You yellow climber You whom I have the honor to address Amorously at the high noon of my morning   The Sunday of a new caress is over me Just there a little to the left of your cheek Sitting upon the needlepoint Of an unfeathered plum tree So high it is where he sits The hills graze his eyelids and his mouth A mockingbird amorously inveigling If you think he is mocking you yellow one Do not trouble He is nevertheless Singing  With fan shaped petals of cerise The ground is covered this morning The ladies must have dropped Their modesties here last night In passing  It is of them too the mockingbird sings Toward the morning  Marsden Hartley   A primitive people of Northwestern Africa  SONG OF MOCKING FOR AN OLD WOMAN  She is old Her breasts are withered Nobody will give cows for her  When she goes to carry water The shining black young men Big laughing lazily They mock at her Although she carries them water and food at noon She is old they say Old and withered like the dead mangrove That once had red blossoms They do not know Red blossoms are in her heart still For her breasts are withered  She is old None would give cows for her  SONG FOR SHREDDING BARK  If you will shred the bark Little daughter You shall have a hundred cows You shall have a dozen lovers   You shall have food all day long Your father will boast of you Little daughter Swifter to work than any of his wives If you will shred the bark Little daughter You shall be sold to a great chief Head of twenty kraals If you will shred the bark Little daughter  SONG OF A WOMAN WITH TWINS  Ou Ou Ou When I was young and little And thought only of the mealies and the sun And the wet whispering river water How could I tell what would befall me How could I know what should come to me  Why did the demons come Why did they make me bear Two bodies at one birth Ah they were not like demons They were like little helpless man children Little and hungry with curling hands and feet Like the son I hoped to bear  All the night I screamed And all the night I bore them    Why did the witch man s drum beating by my head   Why did the witch man s charms smelling strong with en   chantment Why did they not keep the demons From being born to me My father gave him cowries Cowries and a gun Taken from a white man That he killed a year ago Slowly slowly For good and lasting magic That the gun should shoot straight None had such a gun And yet the demons came At my right breast a demon At my left breast a demon Sucking sucking  Oh the little hungry mouths  Oh the little curling hands  That they will drown tonight  Ou Ou Ou  When I was little and young  Tumbling laughing in the sunshine  How should I know what would come to me  How should I know what would befall me  Ou Ou Ou  Myrtle Eberstein   THE BEAN STALK  Ho Giant This is I I have built me a bean stalk into your sky La but it s lovely up so high  This is how I came I put There my knee here my foot Up and up from shoot to shoot And the blessed bean stalk thinning Like the mischief all the time Till it took me rocking spinning In a dizzy sunny circle Making angles with the root Far and out above the cackle Of the city I was born in Till the little dirty city In the light so sheer and sunny Shone as dazzling bright and pretty As the money that you find In a dream of finding money What a wind what a morning Till the tiny shiny city When I shot a glance below Shaken with a giddy laughter Sick and blissfully afraid Was a dew drop on a blade And a pair of moments after   Was the whirling guess I made And the wind was like a whip Cracking past my icy ears And my hair stood out behind And my eyes were full of tears Wide open and cold More tears than they could hold The wind was blowing so And my teeth were in a row Dry and grinning And I felt my foot slip And I scratched the wind and whined And I clutched the stalk and jabbered With my eyes shut blind What a wind what a wind  Your broad sky Giant Is the shelf of a cupboard I make bean stalks I m A builder like yourself But bean stalks is my trade I couldn t make a shelf Don t know how they re made Now a bean stalk is more pliant La what a climb  Edna St Vincent Millay   RODOMONTADES  THE BRIMMING CUP  1 do not drink in sorrow but in the purest joy Man in holy melancholy sits alone with grief Only in glorious madness am I the drunken boy Pouring green flasks of liquid sun and dancing like a leaf  1 leap in zenith revelry 1 spit upon my past My thundering heels strike ringing sparks from cobblestones Like little stars to nick off the minutes flying fast Ah I am only drunken when joy laughs in my bones  COMPENSATIONS  You came with Judith s flashing eye And artlessness grown art Oh most notorious perfidy You took both head and heart  Yet Time bore compensations sweet My age upon your youth Is warm as Father Boaz feet Upon the breasts of Ruth   THE UNTAMED  Out of my dream Í wrought you and your mouth Was scarlet the young body straight and fine Your soft eyes like full midnight of the south And every curve and flexure wholly mine  But at my kiss you stirred the deeps awoke And pushed me strongly backward Oh the new The virginal untamed one whom no yoke Could bind nor make you to yourself untrue  THE GREEN DOOR  Here in the May we danced on violets And blew off golden bubbles Ah my love How shall I name the sorrows and regrets I pluck and the black drink I press thereof  Now you dream deeply wise in death s great lore I lean above you where the crickets sing And fumble the dumb latch of the green door You of the Maytime lovely wantoning  THE MOURNERS  Thus I first saw her brooding secretly Framed like a maid within a trysting gate   Of shadows like a hidden memory Which knows its power to hurt and thus can wait A golden melancholy brushed her face As she tore petals from an old regret Of some long withered blossom Oh the chase Of time had left her somehow in his debt Like a tired traveller I stopped to ask Her charity but slowly leaf by leaf She stripped her flower Hers was the woman s task To sit in mourning mine to fly from grief  LADY OF AUTUMN  Lady of Autumn in your cold repose Dreaming among the brown leaved empty vines With sable robe drawn close the night wind blows And Winter with his icy hand prefines Your lease on this bright garden of wild youth Soon you will nod by the dry sticks of age Lady of Autumn do I speak the truth Put on red shoes make Love a pilgrimage  THE HOUSE OF LAURELS  Gray in eternal twilight are its hills The country where my house is hidden away And melancholy with blind whippoorwills That cannot fly to hunt their vanished day   Low sombre woods of crimson mulberries Beckon the desperate traveller to drain A skin of their rich juice Oh here is peace For restlessness for sorrow and for pain  The houses are of solid marble stone And only large enough for one to sleep Hence fathers from their children live alone Lovers are parted as by hatred deep  I pass the quiet porches of my friends The eyeless walls give me no greeting sign One more turn to the left and the road ends The house with laurels at the door is mine  Carlyle F Mclntyre   TWO POEMS  AGAINST THE SUN  Darkness utter and absolute of the night Hides from me the face and eyes Of one who loved me in the light  Obscures the violent leap of mind to mind Into a stranger world Passion that seemed to bind  Hides from me utterly what I have known The unquiet soul of one Who captured joy with inward moan  A ghost against the sun A shiver in the grass Dead memories that drift And pass and pass  COOTHAM LANE  Twilight has encircled The flowers in the garden And the sky is dim and faint The flowers are as cold as alabaster And luminous like paint Of an old Venetian master   In the church across the fields They are asking pardon  And in twilight Comes the echo Of an ancient door that closes And the echo of their voices For now they go the villagers Along the road they go again Under the unrepentant stars Across the fields and through the lane  Helen Dudley  THE ROOF GARDEN  Since I lost my ancient wealth These are they that have nourished my life In this grotesque grey desert of the town The leaping up of flame The widening of the sky at the corner of the street The soft renewals of steam at the funnel s lip Rising coiling dissolving White flowers of the roofs That in unfolding vanish  Mabel Barker Huddleston   THE BULL  Now day like a great white Bull Shambles among the dewy corn Massive limbed and broad and full Two curves of the sun for horn Winged Bull Assyrian Twain blue wings that heaven span  Woody plains and rivers slow  That with reeded whisper go Down the nave of green willow Through the poplar s portico  There the Bull of Day shall pass Parting osiers rustling grass  Sherard Vines  MOONDOWN  Moonlight and foam of the sea  When I shall tire of singing  Your solemn witchery  And Beauty shall fail in bringing  Its poignancy  Dead may I be  Paul Tanaquil   PEACE  GRASSES AND SAND  1 saw blown grasses and white sand today On either hand blown grasses rain freshen d And underneath the samite peace of sand  God seemed no further than my hand might reach And I who long had trod my city ways Came face to face with the passion of grass and sand  The passion of all of the laboring years at last The stable earth with its miracled leaf and bloom And its syllabled speech to me Hold fast hope hard  THE ADVENTURER  Let us know he hath gone adventuring And the farthest reach of the day explored Let the heart bowed down find peace in this The imperial night and her stars bring word He hath seen and heard  Alfred Battle Bealle   VOICES  YOU AND I  A Wife speaks  We were wild birds soaring To reach the sky The gray wind lifted you like a feather I ceased to fly  We were fast streams flowing To find the sea The brown earth carved for you a channel But none for me  We were young plants growing To brave the cold The gold sun kissed you all the winter I am old  QUERY  A Musician Speaks  How can one sky hold night and day Sun and snow How can one heart hold love and passion Friend and foe  How can one rose hold flower and thorn Bloom and death   STRANGERS  A Father speaks You are a bough and I am the tree Why are you reaching over the wall What do you see  You are a fawn and I the deer Why do you bound to that farthest hill What do you hear  You are a glacier and I am the snow Why do you move across the broad land Where do you go  Edna Wahlert McCourt  WHAT GRIEF  How can so much joy find rest In a tiny feathered breast Or what grief can a bird heart know That it speaks to my sorrow so  Mabel Cornelia Matson   HILL SONGS  I MET THREE LOVERS  I met three lovers  In a crowd  One was free  And one was bowed  And the third one spoke  Too loud  To each of them I spoke just this Walk to the hill tops If you would kiss For to me it has always Seemed amiss To lend my lips In a valley  Up my first lover  Went with me  My stalwart lover  Who was free  He saw the sadness  In my eyes  And left me  Laughingly  For lover two The way was long   But as we went His step grew strong He saw the laughter On my lips And only kissed My finger tips  Then he who was last Went up with me His voice grew soft In humility So on the hills I gave my kiss And spent my life In the valley  ONE SPRING  One spring I lost completely Giving it to you Only myself Who died Knew  One spring I lost completely Now each spring is two The wild sweet spring I lost And the new   FROM A PROMONTORY  Out on the far most ledge of rock I stand and I am almost free Breathe on me wind that I may be Blown like a brown bird out to sea  INDIAN PRAYER  One sunset hour Wrapped in sacrificial fire Then I shall enter Thee Spirit of all sands And Thy night Will cool my small desire To be among my kinsmen  STRENGTH  God says to the sea Again and again Come back to the shore And again and again to the moon Once more Slip over the dune And with each night done Rise again To the sun He makes every daisy Separately   Eda Lou Walton  For each bird s song more Claps an encore From his balcony floor Can it be God alone has strength to exult In monotony  MORNING AND NIGHT  When through the curtain s flutter the sun slips in Streaks yellow on the floor and flecks the face of you I awake to think of dusting off the red plush chairs And of drying steaming dishes a long white hour through  I shall sweep light leaves from the wide strong pillared  porch Brush out the feathered dirt with my stiff new broom I shall press vine tendril patterns from wet linen I shall  ruffle The fresh starched hangings for the sunny sitting room  All these rushing hurried moments of the morning through I do not love you there is too much to do  But when the poplar s shadow by the lake grows tall And the fire gleams gold on the tea cup by your plate Then the whole room listens with the wonder of it all With a still impatience for your whistle at the gate  Eda Lou Walton    COMMENT  TOURING AMERICA ON PEGASUS  TOURING America is very easy now a days All you have to do is to hitch Pegasus to the locomotive Poetry will carry you and yours anywhere you care to go Being a man of means would inevitably defeat such a desire Such a man cannot leave his means for more than a weekend We met one at the recent POETRY dinner to William Butler Yeats He announced with a doleful accent that he has been trying to take a week off for a year past He asked Mrs Kreymborg How do you do it She answered I married a poet She might have added You re entirely too rich sir you have too many belongings to look after and to look after you We have only each other and Pegasus  Our belongings are easily inventoried Those we couldn t take along when we left New York for Chicago we left behind or gave away The rest we packed into a trunk a suitcase and a hand bag inside of two hours Even two hours are over long to devote to belongings Indians gypsies and the other nomadic peoples require less than an hour Birds ask less than a minute Folk who live a circus life need a week or two Millionaires lead such a life minus the joys of owning a menagerie When my partner and I left Chicago we dropped some more belongings One should be able to leave any place on earth at a moment s notice We come into and go out of life in a wink it s like opening and   shutting a door Isn t Nature worth imitating There is no more pathetic sight than watching people tied to belongings They should be as easy to remove as our hats or shoes Belongings are a temporary protection most of us make them permanent and our dependence a form of slavery  The railroad fare That s easy Put everything you have which distinguishes you from the rest of mankind be it ever so little into some poems and you ll sell enough of them to pull a straight face at the ticket agent By way of varying the method of hoodwinkery lest your audience grow accustomed to your perpetrations add some music on an instrument you can carry in a small case with a handle and some plays you can perform with puppets likewise to be carried in a small case with a handle and Pegasus and his trappings are complete In our own cases all we had to do was to open the mail the morning before our departure and find checks covering requests to perform one of our so called poem mimes plays in Connecticut Minnesota and Texas the play yclept Lima Beans and we had the fare to Chicago That tiny tragedy has tided over many a cloudy period  In this connection it must be noted that America is a huge country with a huge audience But you ve got to go out and find it You can t expect anything so immense to come to you not yet Large bodies move slowly In other words we must shed the notion of the average New Yorker or Chicagoan that America is bounded by the Hudson River or Lake Michigan or that the hospitality of America is   bounded by anything whatsoever There is no richer hospitality than the invitation of California although you have to cross the Rockies to reach it And you don t have to come from England for your American audience the door is open to the native as well It is still a little slower in opening to the native in some instances an imported butler asks you for your credentials But there are many houses now where an artist born in America may knock and the door will open instantaneously There are many such houses in Chicago New York is a laggard but that is doubtless because I was born there  There are always people to listen to you and to pay a little at the gate These things don t happen at once They aren t related to miracles But if you believe in yourself somehow if you have it in you to believe in yourself through a long tireless period firmly tenaciously silently without protest or controversy and if you are anxious as well as willing to move along without belongings the audience represented by the food clothing lodging and railroad fare will come to you as naturally as breathing If you keep on giving you re on your way to getting you have to breathe out to breathe in Personally I ve gone without luxury ever since I was born So has the Missus People are kind enough to say or hint that they envy us our funds if they knew what they were envying most of them would hesitate They belong to belongings Most folk don t crave even a scraping acquaintance with freedom You have to give away everything to be free Yes you have   to eat and keep warm to be free but as I say there are plenty of people who need poets as well as grocers and plumbers and undertakers Providing you bring them something or they imagine you do or like a barker or advertising solicitor you can inveigle them into the belief they ll reimburse you under the good old fashioned social machine of give and take  What you bring your audience need not affect the price of wheat or oats It doesn t bring breakfast or dinner to the table or buy a new frock for Genevieve or a sweater for Jonathan What you bring is merely a matter of ephemeral sounds or of movement or of pigments or clay things to lead the mind astray from belongings and materialism They represent the necessity of forgetting belongings Even John D finds this necessity urgent He takes it out in hitting a golf ball And he pays for that nirvana  The apprenticeship to Pegasus is severe to be sure At one time I spent ten substantial years in a New York garret rented at six dollars a month and sat down to most of my meals in an Eighth Avenue bakery but I ll never regret that garret and bakery They did more for me than a university course they trained me in the curriculum of freedom I had a table a cot a chair and a few small accessories They were sufficient I have had more since but I have never needed more From my single window I could view the whole of lower New York The sun was my most constant visitor Before I entered that apprenticeship I was the gloomy Gus of the town The only smiles   or grins I knew were those I beheld Before that ten year term closed I was one of the chipmunks of the town I ve degenerated still further since Not long ago Miss Lowell dubbed me the buffoon of poetry I m happy she didn t dub me the king Kingship was destined for William and the job of supervising the material universe for Woodrow Consider how glum those gentlemen are  We are saving money by going west Rubbers umbrellas overcoats sweaters and the like are not needed in California The money we save will pay part of the fare the balance we eke out of making sounds We ll send you a thought from the Pacific The water s fine from April on and it doesn t come from the sky With the Sierra snows a last reminder of winter and winter thinking we ll be down among the oranges And we send you a sunny invitation to drop your belongings and join us  Alfred Kreymborg  ENGLISH AND AMERICAN  Some discussion has occurred recently in London on the subject of pure English The occasion was the publication of a book on English Homophones by the poet laureate and of a book on Spoken and Written English by Doctor Bradley Only an expert philologist is competent to criticize these two books minutely but words are to a poet what colors and sounds are to a painter and musician his language can scarcely be a matter of indifference even to the successful professional poet   What is pure English And supposing this were discovered would the American writer of today desire to use it We in England do not find it easy to say exactly what constitutes pure English since different pronunciations and usages exist in the various sections of our people as well as dialects in remote country places in Wales Ireland and Scotland Even if these differences are ignored we have only a sort of class prejudice to determine what constitutes pure English The pure English of the bourgeoisie may for all I know be rank Cockney to the ear of sensitive Americans yet if English people of that sort ever think about their language at all it is certain that the majority are convinced that theirs is the right and only pure usage Literary men are not much better they have only their instinct as a criterion and that is fallible  And American English There are few American books especially those written by American professors of English which do not immediately announce the country of their origin by their use of our common tongue The problem is briefly this Are Americans to write the language they speak which is slowly but inevitably separating itself from the language of England or are they to write a devitalized idiom learned painfully from books or from a discreet frequentation of London literary cliques The answer may seem obvious but the difficulty is complicated by a fact which I can make most plain from a personal experience The only young man I know who satisfies me that he speaks and writes pure English the ideal pure English of England   is an American There is no indication in his speech or his writings that he has lived most of his life in the United States nor has he a trace of the Cockney or of that unspeakably offensive Oxford manner which mar the speech of most Englishmen Unless I assume that this man is an unique exception which seems absurd I can only conclude that the purest English is that of a rather rare type of cultivated American  Language is made by the people it is only fixed by writers and orators When language especially that of poetry is too far removed from that of the people it becomes conventional and hieratic like church Latin or languid and degenerate like modern official French poetry When language is conventionally used by writers it becomes burdened with clichés and dead phrases If American soldiers newspapers and popular novels are evidence it is clear that the American people is evolving a new language full of vigorous and racy expressions In spite of the phenomenon of the pure English American mentioned above I am compelled to believe that the majority of his countrymen use an idiom which differs considerably from that which he employs and from that to which I am accustomed Whitman wrote a language which is intelligible to all Englishmen far more so than that of James but it seems to us inaccurate harsh and crude for all its vigor and occasional rare beauty The language of the American people judging from a comparison between newspapers of the Civil War and of today has altered considerably in fifty years   so that a modern Whitman would write a language almost needing a glossary for Englishmen Contemporary American poets use this popular language merely for comic effect or for purposes of sentimentality most of them since they are cultivated and rather literary are careful to use a speech which is as well understood here as in America Yet even in their writings there is a conception of the language which differs from ours Almost all the American poets in The New Poetry anthology seem to have a feeling for words which differs from that of the English In the works of Miss Lowell for example there are few usages which an Englishman would not be prepared to defend yet there is an Americanism in her language indefinable but unmistakable Miss Lowell will I think recognize this as one of the excellencies of her work she is however too well versed in classic English literature to have any  but a faint trace of the quality I am trying to describe It is more marked in Mr Carl Sandburg and still more marked in American prose for even American literary criticism is a little difficult to understand and new novels are bewildering with vigorous but incomprehensible expressions  Englishmen of letters and literary journalists may publish their exhortations and practice their refinements in vain a vast and increasingly articulate part of the English speaking and English writing world will ignore them Another century may see English broken into a number of dialects or even different languages spoken in Canada   Australia South Africa the United States and England The result may eventually be similar to the break up of Latin The triumph of any one of these languages will be partly a matter of commercial and military supremacy and partly a matter of literary supremacy Even when that literary supremacy is unreservedly conceded to Sidney Ottawa or Chicago a knowledge of the idioms of Shakespeare and Henry James will I like to feel still be considered necessary for all good writers Richard Aldington  Postcript The last number of Les Marges a French literary fortnightly edited by M Eugène Montfort which reached me a few days after this note was written contains an interesting article by M Jean Catel La Poésie américaine d aujourd hui He mentions the excellent work which has been done by POETRY and comments on the writings of Whitman Miss Lowell Mr Sandburg Mr Lindsay Mr Frost Mr Masters and H D whom he calls la plus parfaite artiste de tous His article contains a long discussion of the very subject which I have touched on here and I find that several of his conclusions are identical with mine He is convinced that within a reasonable time a new vigorous language will be developed in America as the medium of expression for its literature R A  ART AND EIFFEL TOWERS  The refined American tourist and even the ordinary one in Paris believes it distinguished to confound the Eiffel   Tower by a sarcastic appreciation when leaving the Louvre galleries through the Tuileries he discovers at a distance piercing the twilight clouds that thousand foot high monument of French engineering In this way he agrees with the traditional European intellectual whose admiration dies away as soon as any structure does not look to him like a church or a royal palace does not suggest something like gothic or renascence  Yet whatever is produced in a country by its natives cannot considered from a purely artistic standpoint be in discord with the local atmosphere and in this way spoil the landscape the skyline or the surroundings That is the reason why for instance a city like Chicago on the border of its immense lake with its edifices twenty stories high its wide and endless avenues its numberless factories and warehouses shall one day appear as a thing of beauty to everybody A healthy thinker can therefore say from today on that Chicago is beautiful because it exists and can easily prevision a Chicago style Beauty is not a conception a priori but a result  What we call a style is only an ensemble of material and sentimental details brought together by temporary circumstances on one spot of the globe Chinese pottery Japanese lacquer work the shape of oceanic shells Greek mythology and the rose color preferred by a Dubarry here are some elements of what we call rococo Who can make me believe that at some future day New York manner or Wil sonian style will not just as officially and as seriously mean   past fashions of vases hats mansions or pianos just as do the names of Queen Anne or Louis XIII A cathedral while in construction represented a long and expensive attempt of geometers melters masons carpenters wood and stone carvers blacksmiths glassmakers and so on to terminate a work worthy of its purpose the adoration of a Supreme Being It happened not until long afterward that such a Christian temple became a worldly example of architectural perfection  In our days people seem to believe that its execution is due to a convention between a tyrant of good taste and his obedient subjects and also that God houses like those of Chartres London Reims Canterbury or Nurnberg were always old  The truth is that an original popular monument of any period of human history whatever can have been the reasons for its conception changes as necessarily as insensibly into an accomplished type of a catalogued mode of aesthetic Think of the Pyramids with their funereal purpose or of the Roman Coliseum with its sport object a circus  A modern structure like the Eiffel Tower belongs as naturally to its growing metropolis as a tree to a forest Having been finished in a rather limited amount of time which seems in favor of the harmonious unity of the whole it is in its right and permanent place and will every future day be more so inasmuch as its direct neighborhood has the benefit of its graceful solid predominating lines and mass At the end of the Middle Ages Notre Dame an achievement   which took not less than seventy years acted not differently on the crowd and on its habits of building  Let us hurry wrote the most striking of all contemporary French poets Guillaume Apollinaire who died during the war Let us hurry to love the little train with its blinking engine running through the valley If tomorrow it shall be ancient everybody will be able to admire it What strange power prohibits us from discovering an incontestable right to beauty among the creations of our time Do we imagine this century to be as mediocre as often we are ourselves Fritz R Vanderpyl  REVIEWS  CELESTIAL JAZZ  The Golden Whales of California and Other Rhymes in the  American Language by Vachel Lindsay Macmillan Co  The carpers mutter in their throats that Lindsay is finished and then he answers with a book like this A book dripping with dew and honey and musical with bells honey of Sangamon of California of Hymettus if you will silver bells golden bells jazz bells cow bells church bells all the bells that jingle and jangle and chime across our plains and lakes and mountains from Plymouth to San Diego  The book speaks with more authority than most of us are aware for it lifts history from fact to fiction gives it a glamour And from the days of Homer nay long before until now history has followed the glamour and poets have   registered in men s hearts a truth deeper than events and statistics It may well be that in such poems as The Golden Whales and Bryan Bryan Lindsay is even today writing the epic of our multicolored swiftly marching race The campaign of 96 is like to go down to posterity as he pictures it in spite of all future efforts of level prosers to weigh and balance and set things straight It is doubtful if lean rat Platt and bull dog Hanna and  Mark Hanna s McKinley His slave his echo his suit of clothes will ever recover from the blow dealt them in this wildly marching banner waving poem of a sixteen year old youth grown up to virile strength and purpose And in spite of thin spread Chautauquas and grape juice dilutions and any future meddling with his destiny Boy Bryan may find his immortality as it is here decreed thus and not otherwise Underneath the fervor and humor and jazzy music of this book is a thinking mind and a poet s vision I would not say that any single poem in it is finer than The Congo or The Chinese Nightingale or Booth yet the book as a whole gives an impression of growth and a suggestion of future height and depth and amplitude It has an effect of covering the continent and of lifting our national ragtime from the stamp of feet to the beat of wings Its nonsense has a jewel of truth at the heart of it and its deafening blare carries daringly a folk tune motive Again and again Lindsay takes up a vague intuition in the heart of the American people and makes it articulate in a rollicking tune   Celestial Jazz  Take for example his short poem on that darling old absurdity The Statue of Old Andrew Jackson the equestrian miracle balancing on its horse s hind legs in front of the White House Does not this poem put the essential stamp of love and pride and loyal laughter on that early provincial America of the 1840 s and on that slam bang democratic general who sat straight up and held his course  He licked the British at Noo Orleans  Beat them out of their elegant jeans  He piled the cotton bales twenty feet high  And he snorted freedom and it flashed from his eye  And now old Andrew Jackson fights  To set the sad big world to rights  His hobby horse will gallop on  Till all the infernal Huns are gone  Even so is the boastful flamboyance of The Golden W hales typical of California and even so its fun is of the good old American kind rough but good natured even loving  One might pause to remark on this poet s happy phrasing a concise and trenchant vividness which seems to slip from his tongue before he is aware There is no appeal from it Bryan is a deacon desperado for good and all and forever Daniel s tender sweetheart is  Gliding and lovely as a ship on the sea W e believe him and go along with him whether he is laughing as in The Blacksmith s Serenade or dreaming as in The Lame Boy and the Fairy or suppressing tears as in A Kind of Scorn a poem of proud renunciation and immeasurable sadness   You do not know my pride Or the storm of scorn I ride  I am too proud to kiss and leave you Without wonders Spreading round you like flame I am too proud to leave you Without love Haunting your very name Until you bear the Grail Above your head in splendor O child dear and pale  The Last Song of Lucifer is a more metaphysical expression of divine despair the despair of the poet who would know and capture the whole who would make himself God and who wins angels and demons to his quest singing the song of the Sons of the Morning in hell  Till it leaped as a flame to the forests on high And the tears of the demons were fire in the sky  And just for a breath he conquered and reigned For one quick pulse of time he stood By flame was crowned where Cod had stood  Himself the Word sublime  Until he encounters The Punishment  Beneath where the Gulfs of Silence end Where never sighs nor songs descend Never a hell Hare in his eyes  Alone alone afar he lies And his memories of music Are rare as desert rain  There is sweetness and light in this book and there is also suffering Mr Lindsay s songs are no longer songs of youth but we need not fear that he will have no more to sing H M   MISS CROMWELL S POEMS  Poems by Gladys Cromwell Macmillan Co  I hese poems have the austerity of sculpture they are severely cut in marble In them the zeal and beauty of an impassioned life is composed and patterned and held in level planes even as in a firm and tautly designed bas relief There is no facility no light playing with the emotion it must be strong and deep enough to endure thought and to command hard reluctant materials  Thus the poems are tense and sure Making no display of rapture they are yet sensitive to every wind of joy that blows through the walled garden of a sheltered life without parade of suffering they yet express that tragedy of inadequacy which haunted this woman s mind and caused her too early death We have in these expressive poems the confession of inexpressiveness Here is avowal a fine generous gift of the spirit from one who in the common barter of human intercourse could not give herself away She says  A bond Of thought subdues me rather am I fond Of quietness of safeties which enthrall Of self enshrining loneliness I fail To make the gesture Life awaits  It is a commoner tragedy and a sadder one than the world preoccupied with louder cries more dramatic confessions can stop to realize This failure to make the gesture is the special danger of sensitive and protected souls to whom leisure brings not fulfilment but a baffling incompleteness not companionship but solitude   Unto what mould Of wonted pain must you comply Oh tell me are you bound as I With links of your own failure  Again  I lose the whole in shreds The sombre days unroll And I must spend my dole Of time untwisting ravelled threads  Or this from The Quest  So you think I ve been filled to be sure And you ve never guessed how poor  My leisured safety is How I slake my thirst with song To urge and lure me along  How I look for your melodies  Piteously heroic was the effort of these twin sisters to escape from their walled garden and minister to a world at war They did it but the contrast was too cataclysmic and their ministration too feeble against the immense catastrophe In that bloody chaos when everybody failed their own sense of failure became a personal reproach deepening into an abysmal despair which crushed them like rose petals under the weight of the world s agony If their health had not wavered the experience might have enriched and illumined their hitherto cloistered lives But they worked too hard and too long the strain was too severe  Miss Cromwell s later poems show such an advance over her youthful book The Gates of Utterance that one must grieve the more over her untimely death She had from the first an artist s feeling for form but as her life matured   her touch gained in precision and her art in shapeliness The title of one of her finest poems Folded Power is descriptive of her art and her mind as well one feels concentrated power in her power not wild but controlled not fitful but firm not chaotic but folded into formal beauty The sonnet Experience presents a kind of spiritual exaltation hitherto associated with masculine rather than feminine sages  There is no need for you to cheer or nerve My spirit forward for the days advise The years have counselled me I recognize  No change from joy to sadness I observe  No variation Like the simple curve Earth follows meeting spring and winter skies My life is one experience implies  Continuous truth When it appears to swerve To mount from sadness into joy or sink To sadness with a wayward cruelty Tis only so to you who watch You think That Ì must feel contrasting moods You name Them joy and pain You have not skill to see That where I stand all beauty is the same  Perhaps one may fitly end with this lofty poem even  though others in the book may have a more immediate appeal  Mr Colum s brief introduction and Miss Dunn s biograph  ical note should both be commended for the unerring taste  which guides their keen appreciation and the former s choice  of the more beautiful poems most of which our readers will  remember is hardly to be questioned He says  There is exquisite achievement in The Mould Folded Power Autumn Communion Star Song Definition Dominion The Crowning Gift These are fine lyrics indeed indubitably among the best that have been written in our day  And unquestionably they will be remembered H M   KING GEORGE S POETS  Georgian Poetry 1918 1919 edited by E M The Poetry Bookshop London  A Miscellany of British Poetry 1919 edited by W Kean Seymour with decorations by Doris Palmer Harcourt Brace amp Howe New York  Wheels 1919 Fourth Cycle edited by Edith Sitwell  B H Blackwell Oxford England Reading these three anthologies one is reminded of the difference between the whole tone and temper of present day English poetry and our own The Irish poets are more akin to us but they are not represented here and collections which omit Hueffer Aldington Flint and even Masefield and include only one poem by D H Lawrence can hardly be regarded as presenting the English case quite adequately But taking them as they are as a manifestation of certain phases at least of English taste we have to admit that in poetry as in painting and sculpture the erstwhile British colonies are drifting away from the mother country its practices and ideals We feel cribbed cabined and confined in these volumes only now and then are we reminded of ties of blood and oftenest in the most radical of the three the one which represents the youngest group The Georgians live in the twentieth century no doubt but their subjects ideals and methods follow the old stand  ards of English song Except for a few war poems by Siegfried Sassoon and D H Lawrence s quite as unbear   able poem of love and Harold Monro s praise of the law of Gravity almost nothing in the book reminds us of the age we live in there is little which might not have been written during some other period than ours sometimes with an authentic beauty which might have commanded a hearing among the earlier singers but more often with a muffled and distant delicacy as of an echo repeating from far away Indeed certain of Tennyson s lyrics sound more modern than most of these and among them Shelley would sing like an anarchist  England with its prim and patterned landscapes its daisies and daffodils its nightingales and thrushes these poets praise her even as Chaucer and Wordsworth did though not quite so freshly as the one or so keenly as the other until one longs for a wild wind from the Rocky Mountains to blow barbarous music through this close lush atmosphere these soft and over studied harmonies Even when J C Squire calls up the Volga and the Amazon among his Rivers he is merely dreaming on the banks of the Thames and fitting those mighty names into his quiet revery  And when love is the subject as it so frequently is the women whom these poets celebrate are neither stenographers nor suffragettes nor debutantes nor cocottes nor any other feminine individuals to be met in common streets or rooms They are either the dainty empty ladies of past romance whom English poets of all periods have worshipped and looked down upon or they are of a kind rarer in English song but quite as unreal phantom evocations of the ewig weibliche   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  a type of purely physical sensuality summoned by the poet s imagination as Marlowe s Faustus summoned Helen of Troy to satisfy a longing beyond the reach of any mortal woman John Freeman s Muse Divine is of the former kind in spite of her divinity and D H Lawrence s Seven Seals is a fearsome revelation of the latter a poem as rank and noisome as its author s novel The Rainbow but like that a masterpiece of its sodden and grewsome kind  Most of these Georgian poets seem to be enthralled by the tradition of magic as Louis Untermeyer called it in reviewing Walter de la Mare It is a dangerous tradition for magic is not to be had for the seeking and even the great name of Keats will not suffice to conjure with Nor may it be masked by a liberal use of words like meet and haply thou and thee instead of the familiar you and the archaic eth form of the verb In this volume one finds few of the fairy footprints though some of the poems attain a soft and limpid grace of quiet feeling and movement The most magical in my opinion is one of the simplest The Linnet by Walter de la Mare  Upon this leafy bush  With thorns and roses in it  Flutters a thing of light  A twittering linnet  And all the throbbing world  Of dew and sun and air  By this small parcel of life  Is made more fair  As if each bramble spray  And mounded gold wreathed furze  Harebell and little thyme  Were only hers   King George s Poets  As if this beauty and grace Did to one bird belong And at a flutter of a wing Might vanish in song  Mr Abercrombie writes more austerely than usual and his dialogue Witchcraft New Style is an interesting study of a case of hypnosis put into practicable blank verse but descriptive rather than dramatic Mr Monro is ingeniously engaging as usual especially in Dog Mr Bottomley in Lìttleholme as in all of his work gives the impression of a strong spirit in chains one wonders whether he will ever work free William H Davies is distinctly not at his best this time nor Mr Gibson nor Mr Drinkwater nor Mr Nichols and hardly the most vivid of Mr Sassoon s war  poems have been chosen from Counter attack Of the newer poets most of them have ghost minds Indeed W J Turner says  I move among their tall grey forms A thin moon glimmering wandering ghost Who takes his lantern through the world In search of life that he has lost  And another Fredegond Shove sings  The wandering shepherd star Is not more distant gazing from afar On the unreapèd pastures of the sea Than I am from the world the world from me  Tw o more conspicuous figures among the younger Englishmen J C Squire and Edward Shanks are descriptive and meditative in this volume but not quite convincing that is their poems although pretty well made are yet made they don t seem a spontaneous and unforced creation   a sincere lyric utterance Mr Squire is now editing the new London Mercury and Mr Shanks was widely advertised last summer by being honored with the first annual award of the Hawthornden Prize of one hundred pounds for his book The Queen of China and Other Poems the judges being Laurence Binyon J C Squire and Edward Marsh editor of the Georgian anthologies  The second of these anthologies the Miscellany presents half again as many poets as the Georgian one but on the whole reinforces the impression of that It does not gain distinction by such entries as Laurence Housman Gerald Gould Laurence Binyon or that vociferous balladist G K Chesterton who comes galloping in on a steed as ancient as Don Quixote s and about as fit for its job One or two women s voices arrest one Edith Sitwell whose Lady with the Sewing machine and Solo for Ear trumpet have a grim sarcastic humor and Muriel Stuart whose brief narrative The Father is drawn tense and keen to its bitter climax  Some of the young poets in Wheels seem more akin to us than the elder Georgians Aldous Huxley especially whose stark humor and bluff headlong style might almost come from Kansas Sacheverell Sitwell too has a light inconsequent touch more effective and less deliberate than his elder brother s Sherard Vines sardonic sincerity is arresting and the startling war poems of Wilfred Owen who a week before the Armistice  Put on  Death s appalling chastity prove once more the waste of war   King George s Poets  On the whole the more one reads modern English poetry the more one appreciates the vitality and variety of our own  H M  A GOOD TEXT BOOK  The Writing and Reading of Verse by Lieutenant C E  Andrews U S A Assistant Professor of English in Ohio  State University D Appleton amp Co  Our first approach to the study of verse should be scientific is a significant sentence in the opening chapter of this carefully prepared and excellent work Accepting the affirmation provided one does accept it this officer professor proves an unusually good guide in the study of verse forms for most rhetorics and other text books in this subject are not only incorrect but destructive to the point of blasphemy  The author gives us a large number of illustrative quotations with able comment and a calm and would be fair chapter on Free Verse  It becomes a matter of wonder how so many books about poetry can be written and read Of them all one alone seems to hold something of the joy and delight the unexplained enchantment of poetry Max Eastman s Enjoyment of Poetry I fancy he would not admit that our first approach to the study of verse should be scientific It s a solemn way to study magic though perhaps necessary for the production of magic that will hold its spell Mary Aldis  POETRY A Magazine of Verse  CORRESPONDENCE  A WORD FROM JOHN BURROUGHS  Dear Miss Monroe I just happened to see in the December number of POETRY the unfavorable notice of the poems of John Russell McCarthy by E C  Mr McCarthy s poems came to my hand a year ago at Christmas That night after reading them I was so astonished and thrilled that I could not sleep I had almost despaired of anything fine coming from our present day poets 1 thought so well of his verses that I wanted to know him and asked him to visit me which he did in the Catskills last summer And on knowing him 1 liked him so well that I asked him to go with me this winter to California as my guest I wanted to show him the great Southwest He came and was with us a few weeks It made a great impression on him One result of his trip here is a poem Sea Gulls which will appear in Scribner s Magazine  I look upon his two little volumes as the most valuable contribution to American poetic literature that this century has seen His work is bound to take rank with the best nature poetry in our literature not excepting Emerson s  I think Wild Asters which you print in the same number with that flippant and impotent review of his books is a little gem  John Burroughs  NOTES  Only four of

as follows in regard to her Woman songs of the Hereto They are partly genuine African material and partly remodeled by me They have been quite literally translated and are probably partly traditional and partly improvisations the natives could not or would not say which African songs are usually sung to the casual accompaniment of a beaten drum and there is always repetition more than I have given These and other woman songs are chanted by the women at their daily tasks   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Among the Herero and many other native tribes in various parts of the world a woman bearing
