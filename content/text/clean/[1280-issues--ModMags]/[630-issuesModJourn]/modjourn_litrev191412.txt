MITCHELL KENNERLEYPUBLISHERNEW YORKTHE LITTLE REVIEW VolI DECEMBER1914 No9 Poems RICHARD ALDINGTON On a Motor Bus at NightOxford StreetThe hard rain drops beat like wet pellets On my nose and right cheek As we jerk and slither through the trafficThere is a great beating of wheels a rumble of ugly machines The west bound buses are full of men In grey clothes and hard hatsHolding up umbrellas Over their sallow faces As they return to the suburban rabbit holesThe women clerks Try to be brightly dressed Now the wind makes their five shilling hats jump And the hat pins pull their hairWhen one is quite freeand curiousare fascinating to look atdevils of a sober hell The shop lamps and the street lamps Send steady rayed floods of yellow and red light So that Oxford street is paved with copper and chalcedony2 Church WalkKensingtonSunday MorningThe cripples are going to churchcrutches beat upon the stonesthey have clumsy iron boots Their clothes are blacktheir faces peaked and mean legs are withered dried bean pods Their eyes are as stupid as frogsAnd the godSeptemberpaused for a moment here with crimson leavesheld a branch of fruited oaksmiled like Hermes the beautiful in marbleA Great Pilgrim Pagan GEORGE SOULE SHAKESPEARE in red morocco seems always wan and patheticI see him looking gloomily out of his unread respectabilitybored with his scholarly canonization and his unromantic ownersHow he longs for the irresponsible days when he was loved or ignored for his own sake Now he is forever imprisoned in marble busts and tortured in Histories of English LiteratureThere is no more tragic fate in the annals of imaginationTerrible is the vengeance taken by institutional culture on those who are great enough to command its admirationThereforea genius who has not been tagged unduly by the pundits inspires me with a profound delicacyin a sense akin to the reverence for a beautiful childHere is a virtue which the world needsOne would like to proclaim it from the housetopsYet there are the rabbleready with their election night enthusiasmand the scholarswith their pompous nichesIf one could only find all those whom the man himself would have selected as friends and whisper the right word in their ears Butafter allwe must speak in publicremembering that even misunderstanding is the birthright of the geniusIt is better that power should be expressed in devious and unforeseen channels than not at allThe Little Review 3 A flippant friend once told me that he had never had the courage to read William Vaughn Moody because the poet had such a dark brown nameThat is important because of its trivialityI have no doubt that if the gospel hymns had never been writtenand if we had never on gloomy Sunday evenings seen those pale books with the scroll work Moody and Sankey coversbringing all their dismal train of musical and religious doggerelwe should have been spared many misgivings about the evangelist s vicarious namesakeLet it be firmly understoodthereforethat there is nothing dark brownor evangelisticor stupidly sober serious about the new poet of the Fire BringerMay he never go into a household classics edition But there is a tinge of New England about himjust the sameOnly one who has in his blood the solemn possibilities of religious emotion can react against orthodox narrowness without becoming trivialIt is the fashion to blame all modern ills on puritan traditionsWe should be wise if in order to fight our evils we should invoke a little of the Pilgrim FathersheroismToo many of us take up the patter of radicalism with as little genuine sincerity as a spearmint ribbon clerk repeats the latest Sunday comic slangIf you have ever walked over a New England countryside the endless miles of stone walls may have set you thinkingEvery one of those millions of stones has been laboriously picked out of the fields and there are still many thereBefore that the trees had to be cleared awayand the Indians foughtand the ocean crossed without chart or government buoyFor over two centuries our ancestors grimly created our country for uswith an incessant summerand winter courage that seems the attribute of giantsWhat wonder if they were hard and narrowWe scoff at their terminal morraine but we should be more deserving of their gift if we should emulate their stout hearts in clearing away the remaining debris from the economical and spiritual fieldsIn spite of injurious puritan traditions there is something inalienably American and truly great about old New EnglandIt is the same unafraid stoutness of heart that is at the bottom of Moody s personalityIt gives him power it gives him unconscious dignityYet Moody was indeed a rebel against the religious and social muddle in which he found himselfSomething red and pagan poured into his veins the instinct of defiance to a jealous god and to pale customsThe best of the Greek was hisinstinctively he turned at last to Greek drama for his form and to Greek mythology for his figuresThere was in him that sponde w hich Aristotle believed essential for the poet a quality so rare among us that the literal translation high seriousness conveys little hint of its warmthits nobility and splendorHe believed in the body as in the souland his conception of the godly was rounded and not inhumanDionysus was every bit as real to him as the man of sorrowsIs not this the new spirit of America which we wish to nourishAnd is there not a peculiar virtue in the poet who with the strong arm of the pilgrim and the consecration of the puritan fought for the kingdom of joy among usIn The Masque of Judgment he pictures a group of heroic unrepentant rebels against divine grace who have not yet fallen under the sword of the destroying angelOf them onea youthsings Better with

can be And raise his curseand set his children free The Little Review But quotations crowd upon meMost of Moody s best work bears witness to his glorification of man s possible personality in rebellion against man s restrictive conception of society and godWe have had many such rebels the peculiar significance of Moody lies in the fact that he lacks utterly the triviality of the little radicaland that his is a power which springs from the most heroic in American qualityOf course all this would be worth nothing unless Moody had the authentic utterance of the poetHis fulness of inspirationcombined with his sensitive editinghas left us scarcely a line which should have gone to oblivionAs an example of his magic take three lines from I Am the Womanin which the woman is walking with her lover But I was mute with passionate prophecies heart went veiled and faint in the golden weatheruniverse drifted by after still universe Or the woman s response to Pandora s singing in The Fire Bringer Harkharkthe pouring music Never yet pools below the waterfallsthy poolsdark poolsO my heart Fragmentarymysticunrelated with the context yet who that has heard perfect music can fail to understand that cryIt is indeed this mystic richnessthese depths below depthsthat make a large part of Moody s individual fascinationHe rarely has the limpid clarity or the soaring simplicity which make the popular lyricist such as ShelleyThere is too much grasp of the mind in his work for the large publiconly those who have in some degree discovered the beauty of the wide ranges can feel at home in himOne breathes with the strength of great virility an able and demanding bodya mind which conquers the heightsand those infinitely subtle and vibrating reaches of spirit which belong especially to the poetTo me the thought of Moody is satisfying not only because he typifies those qualities which I like to think we ought to find in American literaturebut because he exemplifies my ideal of a poetThere have been many insane geniusesmen whose glory has shone sometimes fitfully through bodily or mental infirmitySome of us are accustomed to the idea that genius is in fact insanity or is akin to itCertainly the wordswholesomeandhealthyhave been applied so many times to mediocre productions that we are wary of themBut is not the insanity of genius after all merely the abnormal greatness and preponderance of a single quality in a manIf by some miracle his other qualities could have been equally greatwould he not have been a still nobler artistTo me the Greek impulse of proportionate development has an irresistible appealTo be sanenot by the denial of a disproportionate inspirationbut by the lifting of all the faculties to its The Little Review level that is a dream worthy of the god in manTo be an artist not by the denial of competing facultiesbut by the fullest development of all faculties under an inexorable will which unites them in a common purposethat is a rich conception of personalityThe perfect poet should be the perfect manHe should be not insanebut saner than the rest of usMoody not only expressed this ideal in his lifebut in his workHe was strong and soundphysicallymentallyspirituallyNo one who has read his letters can miss the golden roundness of his humorhis humanityhis manlinessYet never for a moment did he make a comfortable denial of the will to soarIn his poem The Death of Eve he has burningly expressed the development of personalityEvean aged womanhas not succumbed to the view that she committed an unforgivable sin in disobeying God to taste the appleTaking old Cain with hershe fearlessly enters the garden again to show herself to God before she diesIn her mystic song she sings Beholdagainst thy willagainst thy wordthe wrath and

is the most flamingWhoso denyeth aughtlet him depart from here This is not the balance of a personality that denies itself Like NietzscheMoody is shaken with the conviction that the most deadly sin is not disobediencebut smallnessThere is a striking similarity between the religious attitude of Moody and that of NietzscheMoody mentions Zarathustra only once in his published lettersCertainly he was not obsessed by the Germanor a confessed followerNor did Moody elaborate any social philosophybeyond a general radicalism quite different from Nietzsche s condemnation of socialismButlike NietzscheMoody was in reaction against a false and narrow cultureAnd like himMoody found in Hellenic ideals a blood stirring inspirationHe found not the external grace of the Greek which Keats

temptation to quote is one that should not be resistedAnd I can think of no better way to send readers to Moody in the present world crisis than to quote the song of Pandora Of wounds and sore defeat

Maeterlinck DoddMead and CompanyNew York Was Dostoevsky a mysticUndoubtedly sobut not exclusively soFar from being a monomaniache applied his genius to various aspects of life and wistfully absorbed the realistic manifestations of his fellow beings as well as the inner struggles of their soulsDostoevsky is the Cézanne of the novelWith the same eagerness that Cézanne puts into his endeavor to produce thetreenessof a treebrushing aside irrelevant detailsdoes Dostoevsky strive to present thesoulnessof a soulstripping it of its veils and demonstrating its throbbing nudeness before our terrified eyesWe fear himfor he is cruel and takes great pleasure in torturing usin bringing us to the verge of hysteria we fear himfor we feel uneasy when we are shown a nude soulPerhaps he owed his wonderful clairvoyancy to his ill healtha feature that reminds us of his great discipleNietzscheI do not know which is more awesome in Raskolnikovhis physicalrealistic torturesor his mysterious dreams

Little Review On Poetry Aesthetics and Common Sense LLEWELLYN JONES POETRYwe are often toldcannot be defined but by way of consolation can always be recognizedUnfortunately the latter half of that statement seems no longer trueespecially of latter day poetryFraticidal strife between makers of vers libre and formalists goes on merrilywhile the people whose contribution to poetry is their appreciation of it and purchase of it are not unnaturally playing safe and buying Longfellow in padded oozeI always thought I could recognize authentic poetry on most themes and even flattered myself that I had some little understanding of the psychology of its productionLatterly two voices have come to meone affirming that I was right in my prejudice that all durable verse should have content as well as formshould have meaning as well as sound though in closest union with the soundthatin shortthe poet should be a thinker as well as a craftsmanan emotional thinkerof courseif that term be permittedbut not a mere clairaudient wielder of wordsAnd then I heard a voice which bid me forget all that and list to Long breathsin a green and yellow dinHastening to give credit where it is duelet me remind the readers of THE LITTLE REVIEW that this is the last line of a poem by Maxwell Bodenheim in the last number of that periodicalI trust that MrBodenheim will forgive me for using him to point a moral and adorn a critical articleespecially as I shall have to compare him with Wordsworth before I get throughand shall have to ask him whether he is not carrying the Wordsworthian tradition just a little too far into the region of the individual and subjectiveinto the unknown territory of the most isolated thing in the world the human mind in those regions of it which have not been socially disciplined into the categories which make communication possible between mind and mindThe other voice which I have mentioned is that of Professor SBGassof the University of Nebraskawho writes on Literature as a Fine Art in The Mid West Quarterly for JulyProfessor Gass takes the very sane position that words are the socially created tools arbitrary symbolshe calls them to give usnot the thing itselfbut something about the thing some relationshipsome classificationsome generalizationsome causesome effectsome attributesomething that goes on wholly in the mind and is not sensuously present in the thing itself And that workhe continuesis thoughtand it proceeds by statementBut undoubtedly words have sensuous sounds and sensuous denotations and connotationsProfessor Gass admits thisbut regards their sensuous properties and especiallyI imagine he would insisttheir sensuous sounds based on physiological accident as secondaryHenceto himImagism would be a use of words for purely secondary resultsAnd that is decadenceDecadence arises out of the primary pursuit of secondary functions Now Wordsworth and the romantic school generally used words in this wayand sologically enoughProfessor Gass classifies Wordsworth as a decadentIn doing so we fear he exhibits an intellect too prone to dichrotomizeHe cuts human psychology up into too many and too water tight compartmentsWhen he quotes Wordsworth s I saw a crowdA host of golden daffodilsBeside the lakebeneath the treesFluttering and dancing in the breezehe seems to forget that there is more in that poem than its imagism as we would call it now that it is record of a personal experiencethat is not only a trespass on the domain of the painterto speak as if we agreed with our criticbut that it is a personal reaction to the picture painted in those wordsthat it tells us something that no mere picture could doThe poemin factis a picture plus a story of the effect of the picture upon a human soulBut the point in which I agree with Professor Gass is that whatever the ultimate purpose of literatureincluding the lyricwhetheras he saysit isa reflection of human natureintellectual in its modecritical in its spiritand moral in its functionor whether it is legitimate to regard its rhythms in words andsecondaryconnotations and associations of words as materials for an art rather than for a criticism of life the point beyond all this that I think fundamental is that literature does what it does informenlightenor transport by understandable statementCertainly all appreciation of literature that dares to voice itself that is all criticism must proceed on this suppositionand it is just this supposition that is flouted by some of MrBodenheim s poemsTake the followingfor instanceTO You are a broadgrowing sieveMen and women come to you to loosen your supple frameAnd weave another slim square into youOr perhaps a blue oblonga saffron circlePeople fling their powdered souls at youYou seem to lose thembut retain The shifting shadow of a stain on your rigid linesThe Little Review 17 Now obviously there is no sense in this in the ordinary intellectualiste meaning of the word senseUnlike most poetryit cannot be analyzed into a content which we might say was expressed suitably or unsuitably in a formIfthenit be a good poemwe must look elsewhere for its excellenceI would hesitate to find that excellence in the mere sound of the wordsIs it then in their associations Arthur Ransomethe English criticaccounts for the peculiar effect of poetry by its use of what he calls potential language of words which by long association have come to mean more than they saythat have not only a denotation like scientific wordsbut a sometimes definitesometimes hazyconnotationan emotional content over and above what is intellectually given in their purely etymological contentDoes this help us hereI am afraid notPersonally I have always associated sieves with ashes and garden earththere is also a little triangular sieve that fits into kitchen sinks Blue oblongs and saffron circles remind me of advertising posters and futurist pictures while I admit a certain poetic quality of a sort here powdered souls remind me of Aubrey Beards leyButperhapsthe ultimate objection to this poem as it stands is the fact that I have an uneasy suspicion that some printer may have transposed some of these expressionsFor would it not really have made better sense if the poem had spoken of a saffron oblong and a blue squareCertainly if I choose to think that that is what it must have been originally no other readeron the face of the mattercould convince me otherwiseWhileif another reader told me that MrBodenheim had once studied geometry and therefore could not possibly have written about aslim square I would be quite unable to convince him otherwiseBut it will be objected it is quite unfair to any poem to analyze it word by wordIt spoils its beautyI challenge the assertionand even assert the oppositeAs a matter of factit is only by analysis that we can tell good poetry from bad poetryFor instance Crown him with many crowns The lamb upon his throneAnalyze that and it straightway appears the nonsense that it really isButon the other handtake this poem of Francis Thompson sI quote only a partDoes the fish soar to find the oceanThe eagle plunge to find the airThat we

to place us in an attitude towardto give us a feeling forrealitywhich is different fromand nobler thanthose of the man who has either never read this poemnever read the same message in other poetic languageor what is more to the point never managed to get for himself the same experience which dictated that poemForafter allif I were to agree with Professor Gass that poetryas a part of literatureis not a fine artit would be because I think it more than a fine artBecause I think the function of poetry is not merely to be a verbal picture art or a verbal music artbut to be an organon of reconciliation between art and lifeThe best poemsI thinkwill be found to be those which alter our consciousness in such a way that our inwardand even our outwardlives are alteredThe poet sees the world as we do not see itConsequentlyhe can put a new complexion on it for usThe world is pluralisticand so are weIntellectually we may be of the twentieth centurybut emotionally we may be born out of our due seasonThen let the poet of that due season mediate to us the emotional life that we needLiving in Americawe maythrough himreach Greece or IndiaBy his aid we may conquer the real worldby his aid we may flee from it if it threatens to conquer usBy his aid alone we may get outside of our own skins and into the very heart of the worldWhatthenshall we saywhen poetry offers to conduct us into

MrMeredith who is popularly supposed to be obscureThe Little Review 19 In Defense of Vers Libre ARTHUR DAVISON FICKEA reply toSpiritual Dangers of Writing Vers Libreby Eunice Tietjens in the November issue of The Little Reviewproperly qualified judge of poetry can have no doubts about vers libreif he doubts ithe is no judgeHe belongs to that class of hide bound conservatives who are unwilling to discard the old merely because it is oldHe does not yet understand that the newest is always the bestWorst of allhe does not appreciate the value of FreedomFreedom is the greatest of boons to the artistThe soul of the artist must not be hampered by unnecessary constraintsThe old fixed verse forms such as the sonnetblank verseand all the other familiar metreswere exactly as cramping to the free creating spirit of the poet as the peculiar spaces and arches of the Sistine Chapel were to the designing instinct of Michael AngeloLamentable misfortune that his Sibyls had to occupy those awkward cornersHow much would they not have gained in grandeur could they have had all outdoors to expand in All outdoors is just what vers libre affords the poet of todayHe is no longer under the necessity of moulding his thought into an artificial patterncompressing it to a predetermined form it can remain fluentunsubjugatedformlesslike a spontaneous emotional cryNo longer need he accept such fatal and stereotyped bondage as that under which Milton labored when the iron mechanics of blank verse forced him to standardizeto conventionalizehis emotion in such lines asO dark dark dark amid the blaze of noonIrrecoverably darktotal eclipse Without all hope of dayTo be honestwe must admit that there was something sickly and soul destroying about the earlier verse formsThe too honeyed sweetness and metrical constraint of Paradise Lost has always secretly repelled the true judge of poetry and Shakespeare s Sonnets have never been thoroughly satisfactory just because of the fatal necessity under which the author workedof rhyming his lines in conformity with a fixed orderHow could spiritual originality survive such an ordealIt would be unwisehoweverto condemn the whole body of past poets for certain of the earlier practitioners didin their rudimentary waysee the lightMilton in Sampson Agonistesin the midst of passages of the old fashioned regular blank verseintroduced several choruses in vers libreand these could perhaps hardly be surpassed by any English or American poet now livingAs everyone knowsWalt Whitmansee The Poets of 20 The Little Review Barbarism by George Santayanaused Vers libre profuselyIn factthere extends backward from us an unbroken chain of distinguished vers libre traditionthrough WhitmanMatthew ArnoldSoutheyShelleyMiltonand many othersthe chain ends only with that firstprobably arborealsinger just antedating the first discoverer of regular rhythmVers libre is as old as the hillsand we shall always have it with usThe one defect of the earlier practitioners of vers libre was that they did not have the wit to erect it into a cultThey used the free form only when it seemed to them essentially appropriate to the matter that is to saythey used is sporadicallydesultorilyToday we know betterToday we know that the free form must be used ever and alwaysIn hoc signo vincesAs a modern poet admirably says Those envious outworn souls Whose flaccid accademic pulses Beat to no rythms of more Dionysiac scope Then metronomes Or dollar twenty five alarm clocks They will forever Cavail at noveltyat beautyat freshnessButhell Buta thousand devils ButHenri Quatre and the Pont Neuf W e of the new agewho leap upon the mountains like goats upon the heaps of tin cans in the vacant lotsand butt the stars We know they are liarsAnd that we are what we areCould that be expressed in a sonnetI think notAt leastit could not be expressed so vigorouslyso wiselyso wellThere ishoweverone obvious peril against which the enthusiast must guard himselfVers libre is not of itself a complete warranty of success because a poem is in this formit is not necessarily fine poetry Love is enough says William Morrishe would not have said the same about vers libreA certain power of conceptionbeyond the brilliant and original idea involved in the very employing of the free verse formis requisite for real importance in the finished productNor is the statement of the poet s own unique and terrifying importance a sufficient theme to constitute the burden of all his workSeveral of our most immortal living vers librists have fallen into such an errorThisego ùber allesconceptthough profound and of a startling originalitylacks variety if it be indefinitely repeatedShould the poethoweverfeel deep in his soul that there is nothing else worth saying except thislet him at least take care to beautify his idea by the use of every artificeAfter sayingI am Iand great let him not forget to add variety and contrast to the picture by means of the complementary ideaYouO worldare youThe Little Review 21 and contemptible In such minglings of light and shade lies poetry s special and proper beautyVers libre has one incontestable advantage over all those more artificial vehicles in which the poets of the past have essayed to ride into immortalityThis newly popular verse form can be used perfectly well when the poet is drunkLet no one of temperate habits underestimate this advantagelet him think of othersByron was drunk most of the timehad he been able to employ a form like thishow many volumes could he perhaps have added to the mere seventeen that now constitute his work Shelley seldom alcoholicly affectedI believewas always intoxicated with ideas heequipped solely with the new instrumentcould have written many more epics like Queen Maband would probably have felt less need of concentrating his work into the narrow limits of such formalistic poems as The West WindLet it be understood that all the principles suggested in this monograph are intended only for the true devotee of vers libreOne can have nothing but contempt for the poet whousing generally the old fashioned metresturns sometimes to vers libre as a mediumand carries over into it all those faults of restrained expression and patterned thought which were the curse of the old formsSuch a writer is beyond hopebeyond counselWe can forgive Matthew Arnoldbut not a contemporaryCertain devoted American friends of poetry have been trying for some time to encourage poetry in this country and I think they are on the right track when they go about it by way of encouraging vers libreNo other method could so swiftly and surely multiply the number of our verse writersFor the new medium presents no difficulties to anyone even the tired business man will find himself tempted to record his evening woes in singless songTruenot everyone will be able at first trial to produce vers libre of the quality that appears in the choruses of Sampson AgonistesThisthis is hesoftly a whileLet us not break in upon himO change beyond reportthoughtor beliefSee how he lies at randomcarelessly diffusedWith languished head unproptAs one past hopeabandonedAnd by himself given overIn slavish habitill fitted weeds O er worn and soiledOr do my eyes misrepresentCan this be heThat heroicthat renownedIrresistible SampsonwhomunarmedNo strength of manor fiercest wild beastcould withstandWhich first shall I bewailThy bondage or lost sightPrison within prison Inseparably dark22 The Little Review That is indeed admirableand not so easy to write as it looksBut some kind of vers litre can be turned out by anyoneand to encourage the use of this medium will be to encourage and vastly increase that multitudinous body of humble and industrious versifyers who are at present the most conspicuous ornament of American literatureThe Decorative Straight JacketRhymed Verse MAXWELL BODENHEIM E clamping of the inevitable strait jacketrhymed verseupon the shrinking form of poetry has been the pastime of centuriesThose who would free poetry from the outworn metal bands and let her stretch her cramped limbs are labeled decadentslothfuland futileHow easy it is to paste disagreeable labels upon the things one happens to dislikeI admit that poetry freed from the bonds she has so long worn may become vulgar and over demonstrativeA convict who has just been released from a penitentiary is perhaps inclined to caper down the roadand split the air with good red shoutsBut after his first excesses he walks slowlythinking of the way before himWith some poets free verse is still the boisterous convictwith others it is already the soberdetermined individualBut I rather like even the laughing convictlooking back and flinging huge shouts at his imposing but petty prisonSuppose I were a Bluebeard who had enticed a young girl into my dim chamber of poetic thoughtSuppose I took the little knife of rhyme and cooly sliced off one of her earstwo or three of her fingersand finished by clawing out a generous handful of her shimmeringmyriad tinted hairwith the hands of meterI might afterwards display her to the worldsaying LookIs she not still beautifulstill almost perfect But would that excuse my butchery The lesson is perhaps fairly clearRhymed verse mutilates and cramps poetryIt is impossible for even the greatest poet completely to rise above its limitationsHe may succeed in a measurebut that is due to his strength and not to the useless fetters he wearsButsay the defenders of the fettersrhyme and meter are excellent disciplinesDoes Poetry or does the Poet need to be disciplinedAre they cringing slaves who cannot be trusted to walk alone and unboundThese are obvious thingsbut one must sometimes he obvious when speaking to those who still possess a childish beliefPoetry is not determined by the monotonous form in which it is usually clothedbut by the strength or weakness of its voiceThe Little Review 23 Because men have foolishly placed this voice in the mouth of a childwearing a dress with so many checks on itand a hat the blackness of which matches the ebony of its ugly shoesit does not necessarily follow that the voice becomes miraculously changed when placed in some other mouthwhose owner wears a different garbThen there is the rhythm difficultyIf the little childRhyme and Meterdoes not swing his foot in time to what he is sayingadding rhythmhis wordsaccording to somechange from poetry to proseWhat delightful superstitions Poets can undoubtedly rise to great heightsin spite of the fact that they must replace stronger words with weaker onesbecausepassiondoes not rhyme withabove butlovedoesBut how much higher could they rise if they were freeI do not say that to eliminate rhymemeterand rhythm is to make the way absolutely clearThe Poet must still be a Poet to climbNor do I say that if the Poet finds that rhymerhythmand meter happen almost to fit his poetic thoughtshe must not use themI only say that the poet who finds that the usual forms of poetry confine and mar his poetic thoughts should be able to discard them without receiving the usual chorus of sneersand that if he does he is not miraculously changed from a poet to a writer of proseHarriet Monroe s Poetry EUNICE TIETJENS You and Iby Harriet Monroe The Macmillan CompanyNew York Right here in Chicagounder our very nosesthere is dwelling personified a Real ForceIt is done up in a neat and compact little packageas most real forces are that are not of the Krupp varietyand it works with so little fuss and fury that it takes some discernment to recognize it for a force at allNevertheless it is a power which is felt throughout the length and breadth of the countryin Californiain Floridain Canadaand in EnglandAnd wherever it is felt it is a liberating forcea force that ruthlessly shatters the outworn conventions of the art in which it operatesthat tears away the tinsel trappings and bids art and beauty spring forth clean and untrammeledto forge for themselves new forms that shall be fitting for the urge of todayThe name by which this force is known in every day parlance is Miss Harriet Monroeand its manifestations are twofold as poet and as editorAs editor she has created and kept alive the courageous little magazine PoetryA Magasine of Versewhich might almostso far as Chicago is concernedbe called the spiritual older sister of TH E LITTLE REVIEWIttooin its own fieldstands for the revolt of today against the hide bound spirit of yesterdayand ittoois a thorn in the side of the PhilistinesThe most recent manifestation of Miss Monroe s influence ishoweverin her character as poetShe has collected together a large number of poemsmost of which have already appeared in the leading magazines and have been widely copiedand has brought them out under the title You and ISeeing them so collectedone is much better able to get a perspective on the poems themselvesand on the very interesting personality behind themAnd they bulk largeUnquestionably this is one of the most important of the recent books of poetryYou and I is essentially modern in spirit and in treatmentMiss Monroe has the power of looking with the eyes of the imagination at many of our modern institutionsThe HotelThe TurbineThe Panama CanalThe Ocean Liner these are some of the subjects she treats with a real understanding and a sweep of vision that quite transfigures these work a day objectsAnd she is equally at home when writing of the great emotional complexity of State Street at Night or the simpler but more profound poignancy of the Elegy for a ChildIndeedone of the noticeable things about the book is the unusually large range of themes treatedThere is also in this book the primalbut unfortunately raregift of wonderThis is one of the essential qualities of true poetryand it furnishes Miss Monroe with the key note of the bookan open eyedcourageous facing of fateand an unshakable belief in the redeeming power of beautyThis little lyric may serve as an introduction to the spirit of the book THE WONDER OF IT How wildhow witch like weird that life should beThat the insensate rock dared dream of meAnd take to bursting out and burgeoningOhlong ago yo ho And wearing green How stark and strange a thing That life should be Oh mystic mada rigadoon of gleeThat dust

honor of contributing sounded a rather curious note inasmuch as it was a piece of pure criticism in a magazine deliberately given over to exuberanceWellit is now my turn to stand up for exuberance as against a contributorAM who gives the poetry of T Sturge Moore criticism onlyandin my humble opinioncriticism as unfair as would be a description of Notre Dame rendered altogether in terms of gargoyles and their relative positionsWould it not be more in the spirit of TH E LITTLE REVIEW to point out in the title poem of MrMoore s bookThe Sea is Kindsuch passages as the two followingEucritosThou knowestMenalcasI built my hut not sheltered but exposedRound not right angledA separate window like a mouth to breatheNo matter whence the breeze might blow A separate window like an eye to watch From off the headland lawn that prompting wink Of Ocean musingWhy wherever he May glimpse me at some pitiable taskLong sea arms reach behind meand small hills Have waded half

call her workFor she demonstrates that it is something new that it is a clear eyed workmanship which belongs distinctly to this keener age of oursMiss Lowell s technical debt to the Frenchto the so called Parnassian school has been paid in a poetical production that will put to shame our hackneyed and slovenlyacceptedpoetsMost of the poems in her book are written in vers libreand this is the way Miss Lowell analyzes themThey are built uponorganic rhythm or the rhythm of the speaking voice with its necessity for breathingrather than upon a strict metrical systemThey differ from ordinary prose rhythms by being more curved and containing more stressThe stressand exceedingly marked curveof any regular metre is easily perceivedThese poemsbuilt upon cadenceare more subtlebut the laws they follow are not less fixedMerely chopping prose lines into lengths does not produce cadenceit is constructed upon mathematical and absolute laws of balance and timeIn the preface to his PoemsHenley speaks ofthose unrhyming rythms in which I had tried to quintessentializeasI believeone scarce can do in rhyme The desire toquintessentialize to head up an emotion until it burns white hotseems to be

century there were no peoplesonly dynastiescourtsAll life revolved around these courtsOn the crumbs that fell from royal tablespeoples livedFor the sake of these crumbspeoples crawled and crouched and cringedThen came the Corsican He trod under foot all these gracious sovereignsThe greater selfishness of the giant swallowed up the selfishness of the pygmiesGermany was still but an historical memoryEurope seemed to have but one willthe will of NapoleonIn the collapse of dynastiespeoples began to consider themselvesPreachers of repentance arose who interpreted the sufferings of the people in a way that could be understoodThe Napoleonic thunder awoke them from the sleep of centuriesThere came the prophet Fichte with his ever memorable Reden an die deutsche NationA living divine breath blew over the dead bones of the Fatherland until they became alive againAnd as the people considered and reflected upon themselvesand showed the astonished world that they were still therethe judgment that was executed against the royal courts was turned against their executorThe German phoenix arose from its ashesthe people revealed their unwithering powertheir eternal lifeA rebirth of the people

unfreedismemberedunsettledAnd all the bestfreestnoblest spirits went about the work with a will to renew the folk life in head and heart and handDid this work succeedWas even an auspicious beginning madeOrwas a false path taken from the very startConfessedly opinions deviate most widely as to all thisBut among those who consider this work as abortive and bunglingno one has aired his displeasure if notindeedhis disgust and distemper so energetically as Friedrich NietzscheThe Germans grew proud of their folk schoolswhere every one could learn to read and writeif nothing moreBut Nietzsche ragedEverybody can learn to read and write todaywhich in the long run ruins not only the writingbut the thinking as wellThe Germans founded librariesbuilt reading hallsand art institutesthat the spiritual treasures of humanity might be as widely available as possibleBut Nietzsche scoffedOnce there was the Spirit of Godnow through its introduction into the masses it has become Pöbelthe vulgar plebeian mobHe even called the whole German culture pöbelhaftvulgarcoarseplebeian German mannersunlike The Little Review 41 Frenchinelegant and unrefined ochlocracy or mobocracythe democratic instinct of modern civilization to Nietzschethe grave of all genuine human lifeIn the tendency of the times there is undoubtedly the danger of leveling menof uniformizing their cultureconsequently of externalizing their cultureNietzsche s aversion to this tendency is understandableand is well worth laying to heartFor examplereligion ecclesiasticized is dispiritualized morals conventionalized are degraded so is art so is even scienceas is seen in thescience made easycults and coursesNietzsche made it the special business of his life to dam back this current in the affairs of our modern worldTo himthe preaching of the equality of all men was the most dangerous lie of the last centuryThereforehe preached the inequality of all menrequired of men that they should not be ironed out to the same smoothnessthat they should not all be hand and glove with each otherbut on the contrarythat they should be aware of their manifold inequalitieskeep their distancesand that thus great and small might be clear as to their real differencesNot libertyequalityfraternitybut the Eigenheitthe peculiaritythe uniquenessthe own ness of the human personalitythe right of man to his Eigenheitthe pleasure in its unfolding and formation this was to be the watchword of the new cultureThis was what Nietzsche requiredHe based his requirement upon the fact that every man is an unrepeatable miracleHe never was beforehe never will be againexcept in his own selfThis fact is almost self evidentIt must be kept in mind especially when we place a man into relation with his surroundingsA man cannot possibly be explained merely as a result of his environmentNo man can be so explainedleast of all a superior individual who has awakened to a self conscious lifeof distinctive personalityand who is inwardly aware of the mystery of his own personHere scientific inquirywith its descriptions and explanationshaltsAt this point science ceases and we must resort to intuition and interpretation of life s deepest mysteriesNietzsche was right in his requirementMan is an unrepeatable miracleBut may we not go even further than Nietzsche didAll life is peculiar and singular and uniqueBehold the billowy field of grain Countless stalks bend to the breezeThe whole seems to be but a great homogeneous massBut take any two of these stalks and consider them more minutelycompare them with each otherEach is something specialsomething with an individual life of its ownPluck an ear from the stalkOne grain is side by side with anotherone looks for all the world just like anotherButin factno one is just like anotherAnd from each grain a special stalk growsso special that the like of it was never in the world beforeOryou wander along the beachInnumerable are the grains of sand on the shore of the seaThe multitude of grains form indeed a uniform massso uniform that its very uniformity wearies and pains the eyeif it is looked at for longBut look sharplyconsider any two of these grains of sandEach is something for itselfIn the whole illimitable massyou find no second grain just like the firstWhat is true of the little grains of sand is true of every drop in the wide and deep sea true of every mote in the airof every least particle in vast shoreless cosmic spacesThentoothere are the stars one star differs from another star in gloryas Paul saw and said long agoAll this I call the wealth of naturethe wealthif you willof GodIn this eternal lifenothing is ever repeated or duplicatedThis I call infinite creative powerNever and nowhere does the weaving and waxing world deal wih copiesEverywhere and everywhen the world creates an original fontal life of its very ownThen should not man be awakened to such a life man in whose eyes and soul all this singular and peculiar life is mirroredShould it be man s lot alone to be excluded from all this superabounding fulness of original lifeShould he be offended at what is a blessing to all other creaturesfear their fulnessfind the true task of his life in the renunciation of this fulnessTo be surethe centripetalsolidaric forces of life do indeed awaken in manWith the breadth of his spirit man spans the greatest and the leastcompares the likest and the unlikestcombines the nearest and the farthestButfor all thathe would sin against lifehe would commit spiritual suicidewere he to use this systematic power of thought to over paint gray in gray the variegated world with its colorful magnificenceto make everything in his own world so similarso uniform and so unicoloredeverything that was divinely destined and created for an existence of its ownFrom everything that was repeated or duplicated in the world would ascend an accusation to God in whose life all human life was rootedWe who would thus be only a repetition of another would have the feeling that we were so much too muchthat we were superfluous in the world For the proof that we are not superfluous in life is to be found in the fact that no one else can be put into our placecan be confounded with usthat there is a gap in lifein the heartinto which no one else can fitand that if ever another does occupy our place in lifethe gap abidessurviving as the only trace of our existence in the human heartcorresponding to our image and our natureTo be superfluous in the worldto fill therein no place of one s ownto drift and drag about with this feeling the feeling of all this is alone the real damnation of lifethe worst hell that there is in this or in any other worldBut the feelingeven with the minimum capital of lifewhich yet we may call our own the feeling that one makes a necessaryorganicirreplaceable contribution to the possessions of humanitythis is life indeedwho has this lifeand keeps it aliveknows more joy and bliss than any other heaven can guaranteeA life of one s own that shall yet serve the life of all there is the consummation devoutly to be wished In these days we hear much about The Little Review decadence and the decadentWhat does that meanAt bottomthe decadent seeks to escape the diremption of the modern man between the individual and the socialby affirming the former and negating the latterThe individualthe social celldetaches itself from the whole organizationfrom the social bodywithout considering that he thereby dooms himself to deathThe cell can just as little exist without the organismas the organism without the cellDecadence is the last word which anti social individualism has to say to our timeThe history of this individualism is the judgment of this individualismThe man who fundamentally detaches himself from society cuts the arteries of lifeStill the man must be his own manand not anothereven that he may give a service of his own to societyas a cell must be its own cell and not another if it is to construct and constitute the organism of which it is so small a partBesidesman is not entirely like a cellHe is in an important sense a supersocial beingas the cell is not super organicSo we may as well go on with our discussion of the Nietzschean uniqueness and own ness of personalityPersonality is both super individual and supersocialWe have its truth in value judgment and not simply in existence judgmentSomewhere in the old forgotten gospels there is a grim stirring word Enter by the narrow gatefor the gate is broad and the road is wide that leads to destructionand many enter that wayBut the road that leads to life is both narrow and closeand there are few who find itYesindeed It is a narrowa very narrow gate through which men enter into lifea smalla very small path that leads to this narrow gateThere is room for only one man at a time only one There is one precaution with which man must sharpen all his witsif he is to have regard for the wayso that he may at no moment lose sight of the way or if his feet are not to lose their hold and slipif he is not to grow dizzy and plunge into the abyssThis is not every man s thingit costs stress and strain and tension it needs sharp eyescool headfirm and brave heartIt is much easier to stroll along the broad waywhere one keeps step with anotherwhere many wander along togetherand if there but be one that is the guide of allthen of course all follow that one step by stepOn this broad way no one need take upon himself any responsibility for the right wayShould the leader mislead his blind followersthe latter would disbelieve their own eyes rather than their leaderwouldconfessthat the false broad way was nevertheless the right wayrather than condemn their own blindness and indolenceThese are the Herdenmenschenthe herd men who cannot understand that there is a strength which only the man feels who stands aloneThese are the men who have no stay in themselves and seek their staythereforein dependence upon otherspossess no supplies of their ownand ever therefore only consume the capital which others amassFriedrich Nietzsche summoned men out and away from this herdFriedrich Nietzsche warned men of the broad way and guided their minds to the solitary paths which are difficult and perilous indeedbut along which the true life is to be livedThese small pathsthese are the paths of the creativeWhere man becomes a new forceand a new lawa wheel rolling of itselfand a first mover There every force of his being becomes a living creative forceNo thought is repeatedno feelingno decisionis a copy of something which was beforeThis is a new faith in manHe does not need to live by borrowingThere is a stratum in his own soulin whose hidden depths veins of gold are concealedgold that he needs but to mine in order to have a worth of his owna wealth of his ownThis is a new love to the man who conceals undreamt of riches underneath his poor shelldivine living seedcorn preserved with germinating power underneath all the burden of the dead that overlay himHere Nietzschethe godless onechimes with the godly Gallet who values the error which man of himself finds more highly than the truth he learns by roteTo be sureman possesses this that is his very ownthis power of the creatorin his soulnot in his coatnot in his mannersnot in life s forms of social intercourseThe man is still far from having everything his very ownif he be only different from othersif he only saysnoto what others sayyes There are people enough whom one might call reverse HerdenmenschenThey esteem themselves original because they actthinkspeak differently from what they see everybody else doingand yet they are only the counterpart of othersthey receive the impulse of their lifenot from what is living in their ownselvesbut from opposition to what they themselves are notWhat they call beautiful is not beautiful to them because it grips their soulsfills their hearts with the free joy of visionbut because others cannot endure itand call it uglyThe good for which they strive is not good because they have themselves thereby become strongergreaterbetterand will always become strongergreaterbetter therebybut a caprice which they followmaking it a law to themselvesbecause others may not do soAs if anyone could live on negationor create by digging mole tracks in the fields and meadows of men Even the small path is pathand every path has a goaland the goal of every path is ayesand not anoThereforeFriedrich NietzscheContemner of Pdbclof the plebeian masswould count all as Pöbel who held themselves aloof from the broad way purely because they saw how many there were that trod itHe would also call the most select and sought after exclusivists H erdenmenschen were they to derive the reason of their action and passion merely from the mania and disease to be different from the herdPlainindeedthenis Nietzsche s great requirementLet every man honor and safeguard his unrepeatable miracleand be something on his own accountThis cultural requirement is supplementation and development of the moral ideal of the great German prophet at the beginning of The Little Review 45 the nineteenth centuryspeaking as he did out of the blackest night of a people s lifeFichtetoowould create a folkno PöbelTo be folkall that is Pöbel must be

his neighborPöbel signifiesthereforenot a human classnot a social layer of the populationbut a dispositionEverywhere there are aristocratic Pöbelwherever men pride themselves on reciprocally surpassing each other in flunkey like ways of thinkingThere is a politicala partisan Pöbel which counts it human duty to help increase the great pride that runs after a leader on the broad way of the herdThere are Pöbel in science and in artwherever men do not dare to ally themselves with a causea principlea workuntil someauthorityhas pronounced judgment in the matterThere are pious Pöbel who cock

knowing what it does and blasphemes every body who does not shout with itTo what shall I compare this generationIt is like children sitting in the marketplacewho call to their playmates We piped to

been smuggled through into this country we learn about the great resurrection that is taking place in the land of extremesThe war has shaken the dormant giantand life is pulsating with tremendous vigorThe abolition of liquor trade has had an unbelievable effect on the population the fact that this reform was promulgated by the government which has thereby lost nearly a billion yearly revenueis of inestimable significanceThe Czar and his counsellors have finally awakened to recognize the impossibility of reigning over a country without citizensand liberal reforms on a wide scope are being announcedNationalities and parties are united under a new sloganDown with Nationalism Long live PatriotismEven the reactionary organs have abandoned their chauvinistic toneand they preach equality and freedom and the abolition of the bureaucratic régime which they ascribe to Germanistic influencesThe revolutionary partieshoweverare not intoxicated with the momentary upheaval they have had too many bitter experiences to be lulled by promises from the throneOf all the warring nations the Russian socialists were the only party to take an openly antagonistic attitude towards their governmentThey were demonstratively absent from the Douma when the war manifesto was announcedand later they gave out a declaration in which they expressed their condemnation of the government and its policyRecently an official communication stated a discovered conspiracy among the radical members of the DoumaIt is clear that the revolutionists intend to forge the iron while it is hot this time affords them a

in Decemberthe ideal night for a journeyBehind meChicagonoisejanglerushand dirt great crowds of people a hall room of agonizing uglinesswith walks of a green tone that produces a sort of savage mental biliousness and furniture of striped oak that makes you pray for destruction by fire frayed rugs the color of cold dishwater and painted woodwork that peels off like a healing sore smells of impromptu laundry workand dust that sticks like a hopeful creditor an outlook of bare brick wallsand air through the window that should have been put through a sieve before enteringAll these and one thing more which makes them as nothingthe huge glory of accomplishmentBefore me It was snowing hard as we steamed inThere came a clanging of brakesa cold blast of snowy air through the opened doorsa rush of expectant people and thenshining in the glow of a flickering station lightone of the loveliest faces I ve ever seen my sister sand one of the noblest myDad s Then a whirring taxia luxurious adjustment to comfort in its dark depthsa confusion ofSo glad you re here andMother s waiting at homea surging of all my appreciation at the beauty of young Bettywith her rich furs and stunningly simple hat and exquisitely untouched face a long dash through familiar streets until we reached the more open spaces the Country Club district where there are only a few homes and a great expanse of park and treesand finally a snorting and jerking as we drew up before a white house from which lights were shiningNow this little house is all whitewith green shutters and shingleswith a small formal entrance porchlike a Wallace Nutting printin frontand a large white pillaredglass enclosed living porch on one sideA red brick walk of the New England type leads up to itand great trees stand like sentinels at the backOn a winter nightwhen the red walk and the terrace are covered with soft snowwhen the little cedar trees massed around the entrance sparkle with icy frostwhen the warm light from the windows touches the whiteness with an amethyst radiance wellit s the kind of house that all good dreamers sometimes have the reward of dreaming aboutAnd when Mother opened the doorletting out another stream of light and showing her there against the warm red background of the hallI was convinced that getting home was like being invited to paradiseOf course we talked and laughed for an hourand underneath it all I was consciousabove everythingof the red and white room in which we sat of the roaringsinging fire of the shadows it threw on the luxurious rugs and old mahogany of the book lined walls of the scattered magazines on the long table of the chiming grandfather s clock of the soft lights and more than all of the vase of white roses against the red wall But you must hear the new Victrola recordsMother criedAnd so I lay back in a deep chair with my face to the fireand listened listened with my soulI thinkto some of the world s great musicSembrich and Melba and Homer and Gluck Paderewski and Pachmannorchestrasoperasand oldold songsand finally my favorites the violin onesThere was Kreislerwith his perfect artplaying old Vienna waltzeshaunting Provence folk songsquaint seventeenth century gavottes and dances Maud Powell putting new beauty into the Schubert Ave Mariaand that exquisite tone picture of Saint Saëns called The Swanand last of all Mischa El manwith his deeppassionate singing of Bach s Air for the G String and Tschaikowsky s Ye Who Have Yearned AloneThere s a beauty about those last ones that is almost terribleso close is it to the heart of human sorrow Well said Dada little later I don t know about the rest of youbut I m going to bedAnd first I mean to have some milk and a piece of pumpkin pieDoes that attract a city girl It did to the extent of three glasses of milkbesides the pie You ll not sleep warned Mother but I retorted that I didn t care I was too happy to sleepanyhowAndbesidesthe kitchenin its immaculate gray and whitenesswas so refreshing that I wanted to stay there awhileLarge baskets of grape fruits and oranges and red apples stood on the pantry shelves the stove was polished until it looked like a Sapolio advertisement and a clockticking loudlygave the room that curious sense of loneliness that a kitchen needsI can conceive of a library without booksor a fireplace without a firebut never of a kitchen without a loud ticking clockAfter while we all trooped up to bed up the white staircase with the mahogany railand into fresh white bedrooms in such perfect harmony with the snow outside This house is positively sensuousI told Mother It s an emotional adventure just to come into it I climbed into a big mahogany four poster but not to sleep oh no I sat bolt upright with the silk comfortletoh luxury of luxuries around my kneesand gazed out the windows for from both of them I saw a fairylandIt was all white all except the amethyst shimmerings of boulevard lights and white flakes dropped one by one through the amethystAway in the distance on both sides were faint outlines of woods barebrown woods now covered warmly with snowAnd over it all a complete and abThe Little Review 53 solute stillnessJust as in spring I used to feel fairies leaping from every separate violet and tulip and hyacinth for their twilight dance on the wet grassso now I felt a great company of snow fairies dancing in the faint rays of amethyst that darted into the woods dancing and singing and glittering in their silver frostinessAnd then a slow quiet wind would sound far off in the branches of the oak trees and gradually the fairy carnival ceased and I went ecstatically to sleepThe next morningafter breakfast in a dining room of old blue and white and mahoganyI stated my ideas of what one ought to do in such a house I don t want to go anyplace or see anyone or do anythingDon t plan luncheons or teas or other thingsIt will take a week to store up all the impressions I want toSo please just let me stay here quietly and absorb the atmosphere And so my precious week beganIn the mornings I d put on bootsfor the snow was deep by this time and take long tramps through the woodsThen each afternoon had its distinct adventure sometimes it would be a mere wandering about from room to room standing before a specially loved picture or buried in a favorite old bookAnd what an enchanting thing it is to read in such a settingto look up from your book knowing that wherever your eyes fall they will be rested to feel your imagination sinking into the soft depths of a reality that is almost dream stuff Sometimes the afternoon would have its hard fought game of cards between Dad and me with the table drawn close to the fireand Bertha running in from the kitchen with a hearty offering of cider and hot doughnuts Bertha always seemed to sense the exact moment when we declaredwith groansthat to wait another hour for dinner would be a physical impossibility Sometimes at four o clock I d conceal myself in a mass of cushions in the big swing on the porchand wait for the darkness to come onloving every change of tone in the grayness until the boulevard lights blossomed like flowers and made another fairylandAnd always we d have tea by candle light on the porch in deep wicker chairsor before the leaping fireSometimes after tea I d take a two mile tramp down townstopping at the post officebecause a post office in a small town is a place worth seeing at five o clock in the eveningand trying deliberately to get cold and tired before reaching home againso that the warmth and comfort would come as a fresh shock and joyAnd then a quite wonderful thing would happen namelythe miracle of a superlatively good dinnerI shall never forget those dinners Not the mere physical pleasure of thembut their settingMother feeling a little gossipyand talking cozily of the day s small happenings Dad in a mood of tolerant amusement at our chatter and Bettyusually in whitelooking so adorable that even the roses on the table couldn t rival herBut most perfect of all were the long evenings First we d read aloud 54 The Little Review a little Paterjust for the ravishing music of his languageand then Betty would singI don t know any lovelier singing than Betty s it s so young and fresh and wistfulAnd when she d finish with the Brahms Lullaby I could have cried with the beauty of it allLaterwhen everyone had gone to bedI would creep downstairs again to lie by the fire and have the obliging MrMischa Elman play me another concertYe Who Have Yearned Alone was the thing he d play most oftenfor it has a surging sadness that keeps one humble in the midst of happinessEverything of yearning is in it the agonies of countless tragic loves the sadsad strivings for joy and comprehension the world old miseries ofburied liveshopes and fears and faiths and crucifixions ecstacies dying out like flames utter weariness of living and utter striving to liveOhyou people who have homes Why don t you realize what they might yield youWhen you find yourself uneagerstupified with contentmentashamed of your vicious comfort why not share your homes Back in ChicagoI have a vision strong and soothinglike a poppy seed that brings sleepI close my eyes at night and suddenly my bare walls are lined with books soft lights are lighted in a great fireplace burns a crackling fire that has in it sometimes soft sounds like bird singingand out of the rumble of elevated trainsdrowning the roar of traffic and bringing a deep stillnesscome the singing tones of a violinrising and falling over an immortal melody Ye Who Have

29thENOUGH of war poetryAn industrious statistician has calculated that three thousand pieces have been printed since the beginning of AugustWhen our poets are unanimous in the choice of a subjecttheir unanimity is horribleWe have had lyrical outrages from railway portersdairymenpostmenroad scavengersand what notwith their names and professions duly appendedin the delectable fashion set some time ago by The English ReviewMeanwhilein Franceyoung poets are killing one anotherWe must arrange a balance sheet of gains and losses when the war is doneMCharles Péguy is gone alreadythat is a loss which makes one fear for Jules Romains and the rest who must be at the front in one army or the otherThe French and German casualty lists are not published in the English papers when the smoke clears off again the arts of the continent will show a different complexionMeanwhile we are beginning to askprematurely of coursewhat effect the war will have indirectly on our own artsThe war of70 caused an epoch of literary ferment in Germany and was at the back of much good poetryTo that war we owe Detter von LiliencronRichard Dehmeland Gerhardt Hauptmannwho isI freely admita great dramatistthough I cannot abide himIn France it produced the tired subtleties of KahnRégnierand the other SymbolistsIn Austriaa century of humiliationwhich has become almost a national habithas evolved the tired elegance of Hofmannsthal and the weary tenderness of Schnitzler who is so obviously so sorry for all his characters as almost to make the reader weep with himIf we win this warwhat may we expectWe can be certain that the English arts will react to the strain the reaction will not necessarily be a good oneunless the efforts of those who sit about at home and vulgarize war are neutralized or ignoredThe tone of our newspapers and these mould our mindswhether we like it or not is now most insufferably uglyAnd as a result of victoryI fear a blatant hollow tone of exultation in our poetry that from a literary and social standpoint is almost worse than the languors of defeatIt will be well if we achieve victory when every person in the country has been made to feel the cost of itThree days knee deep in flooded trenches our arts must draw strength from that dreadful experienceIt is true perhaps that we do wish to feel the costWe are supposed to live in fear of a Zeppelin raidIn my opinionhalf the inhabitants of London constantly though secretly hope itWe feel that with a bomb or two tumbling about our heads we shall bein it To read the newspapers is 56 The Little Review like having a surfeit of the kind of book which is calledThe Great War of 19I have read dozens of them and they move my imagination almost as much as the reports some of themsuch as are well writtenlike MrWells s War in the Aireven moreThe result that we must pray for is a greater concreteness and reality in our writingWe have developed an inhuman literary point of view which is fundamentally insincere and which is never more ugly or less convincing than when our poets try to bemodern Such poets as Emile Verhaerennow a refugee in London treat factories and so forththe typical productsthey thinkof modern lifepurely as romantic apparitionsmuch as the romantic writers treated mountains and desertsexcuses for rhetoric and flamboyant descriptionThey have never felt the reality of thembecause modern life in its rapidity has outdistanced the poet s mind in his attempt to conceive itI hold no brief formodern poetryin that sort of sense I do not hold it necessary to write about these thingsBut if you will compose upon a factory or a railway stationyou must feel what factories and railway stations really are you must not take refuge in a romantic description of lights and roaring machineryThe perpetually breaking high note of the Futurists is merely a rather useless attempt to deal with a difficulty that we all knowPerhaps the war will bring us rather suddenly and jarringly in touch with realityIt is certain that the young men of the class from which literature chiefly comeshave now in their minds a fixed and permanent thought which from time to time comes up onto the surface of consciousnessThis thought is the thought of violent deathWe have grown physically and morally soft in securitybutas I writeaffairs are reaching a crisis in Francefresh regiments are being sent abroadWe each of us wonder which may be the next to goThis honest and undisguised fear a man is wonderfully insensitive if he does not feel it and a braggart if he will not admit it has a powerful and purifying effect on the spiritIts spiritual action is comparable to that of violent and maintained physical exerciseThe flabby weight of our emotions is being reduced and hardened we have sweated away a great many sick fancies and superfluous notionsThe severe pressure of training for war induces in us a love of reasona taste for hard thinking and exactitude and a capacity for disciplineThe art of war is fortunately an art that allows itself to be definitely judgedEither you win your battles or you lose themIt is of no use to say that Warmser was a great general whose subtle and esoteric methods of making war have never been appreciated by a numskulled publicNapoleon thrashed him and there is an end of argumentA soldier cannot resignedly appeal from the fortunes of the field to the arbitrament of the futureThe consideration of these facts leads us to wish that poetry were in the The Little Review 57 same case and we are beginning to feel both that poetry may become a more active factor in normal life than hitherto and that a careful criticism may remove it from the desert space of assertion and undefended preference which it now inhabitsPossibly the war may help to cure us of our ancient English muddle headednessWe have awakened with surprise to find our army an admirable and workmanlike machineThe South African war rid usin military affairsof the incompetent amateur and the obstructive officialVague rumors of what the army had learnt there even reached other departments of activity possibly this war will infect us all with a new energy and a new sense of realityWe may learn how to reach our ends by taking thought and by cherishing ideas instead of plunging on in a sublimely obstinate and indisciplined muddleAs for our war poetry I must

business ethicsIf the play really is badlet the public find it out graduallyThey may never find it out at allIf it is goodwe really don t need the critics for publicityThe article was ingenuous and

few precarious weeksJust now The Catholic Theatre Movement has created a diversion by issuing theirWhite Listof plays and threatening to prosecute by law the producers ofuncleandramaThey take occasion to compliment the newspaper critics for abandoning to some extent artistic standards of criticism and substituting moral standardsThe movement will undoubtedly tell against much undesirable filthbut

MrsMax Eastman and Charles and Albert BoniIt will be supported principally by its own subscribers at a very moderate expenseand will be as far as possible from a philanthropic attempt toelevate the

thing cannot avoid being at least a healthy experimentPavlowa opened in the Metropolitan a week after Genée had given a Red Cross benefit in a vaudeville theatreThe conjunction was a striking example of the marked inferiority of a romantic form to a classic unless the romantic vehicle is done honestly and supremely wellGenée gave in ten minutes more genuine aesthetic pleasure by her perfection of line than Pavlowa in a whole evening of half done workPavlowa has proved often enough that she can be one of the goddesses of the danceLast year she had with her Ceccetiher ballet masterand practiced with him constantlyOnly by such external vigilance can perfection be maintainedThis yearpresumably for reasons of economyCecceti is not presentThe company is much weakened by the absence of the principal character dancersThe opening ballet was a second rate concoction with almost no real dancing in itAnd to top off the insulta third of the program was devoted to ordinary ball room danceswhich any number of cabaret pre formers in the United States can do better than trained ballet peopleIt was the usual tragedy of the artist who tries to popularize his workAn enthusiast sitting

TheaterHE most interesting thing about Shaw s Philanderer as it was put on at The Little Theater the latter part of Novemberwas the new treatment it received at the hands of the scenic artists of that precious institutionOne is tempted to use the trite but pretty figure and say that it was an instance of an old gem in a new settingonly modifying it by the statement that The Philanderer is merely a fake gemThe luster it may have had in the eighteen nineties is now almost entirely worn awayIn shortits fun is pointlessIbsenthanks largely to MrShaw s active propagandais a household petIbsen clubs are as obsolete as Browning clubs while thenewwoman as embodied in her present day sisterthe feministis too familiar and too permanent a figure to be the subject of effective satireThat the play still has appeal for a modern audience is due wholly to its charactersand yet these stage people are not realThey are no more than caricatureseach effectively distorted and exaggerated in the drawingeach effectively touched off in monochromeTo use another overworked phrasethey are typically Shavian in that they are not characters but traits of characterThey are not real peoplethey are perambulating states of mindas are almost all of Shaw s creationsand the more emotionalrather than intellectualthe state of mindthe wider its appealBut neither Shaw nor the play is the thing in this discussionThe setting of the playsubordinateno doubtin intentionbut predominating because of its noveltyis what interested most the eyes of the layman brought up for years on the familiar conventions of the ordinary sized theaterThe action demands interior settingsbut instead of the realistically painted canvas walls and wooden doorsThe Little Theater gives us tinted backgrounds with rectangular openings for entrances and exitsThe first act is done in graythe second and third in blueand the fourth The Little Review in a soft greenThe effect of peopleparticularly of womenmoving against such plain unrelieved tints is pictorial in the extremeEach successive movementeach new position is a new pictureThe curtains parting on the last actshowing the copper tint of a samovara vase of delicate pink flowersa white tableclotha handsome dark woman pouring teaall against a soft glowing greengave one the feeling of seeing an artfully composedskillfully colored canvas at a picture galleryAnd it suggestedmore successfully than any other setting I have ever seenthe home of a person of refinement and restraintLess successful was the setting for the second and third actsThe use of indigo in representing an Ibsen club may be satirical and it may be subtlebut its effect on the spectator after an hour or so is depressingand in the general atmospheric gloom that increases as the act goes on the sparkle of some of the brightest dialogue is lostOn the wholethe workings out of this new idea in scenery is suggestive in its effect and lovely in its pictorial qualitybut until the novelty wears off it obtrudes itself upon the interest that belongs rightly to the playIts cheapness should ingratiate it to the professional producerNaturallythe effect of one unrelieved tint in the settings of a theater of ordinary size would be deadly in its monotonybut the idea suggests of itself endless variation and improvementsAfter leaving The Philandererwith its obvious limitationswith its unevenat times amateurish actingone cannot help wishing that our every night plays had half the thoughthalf the tastehalf the imagination in their production that The Little Theater plays seem to haveSAMUEL KAPLANMusic The Kneisel Quartet and Hofmannized Chopin And in the meantime war went on beyond the oceanStrangebut this absurd thought accompanied me as a shrill dissonance throughout the concertI could not help conjecturing what would be the resultif all the warriors were brought together to listen to the Kneisel Quartet Would they not become ennobledharmonizedpacifiedhumanized Could they go on with their dull work for modern war gives no thrills for the individual fighter after Mozart s Quartet in E Flat Majorwhich has the soothing effect of a transparent vaseThey might have found Brahms s Quintet suffering from this artist s usual weakness lack of sense of measurebut the Scherzo would certainly have elated the most avowed anti GermanThe four instruments performed their work so artistically that one forgot their existence and heardjust music The only number that could have aroused international complications was the insincere grotesque of Zoltan Kodalywho succeeded in misusing an excellent sourceDanuvian motives But this is Modern I was shrapnelledWellcall me a conservativebut if this is modern musicthenin the name of Mozart and BeethovenPereatStill imagining a Marsian audience I was not dismayed even by the appearance of the effeminate ChopinFor Josef Hofmann took the artistic liberty of interpreting the gentle Pole in his own wayand the Scherzo in B Flat

Minor ValseKHofman s Concert The spoiled child of the world s pianism Josef Hofmann played Schumann s A Minor piano concerto with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra at two concerts during the first week in NovemberBoth performances were masterly and splendid in musical valuesSince he left his cradleHofmann has had the world sitting at his pianistic feet and fingers so that he has come to take the most vigorous and sincere homage as a matter of fact andperhaps for this reasonhe occasionally fails to merit itHe is insolent to his worshippers and furious with his criticsLong and copious praise has gone to his headHis insolence is less poetic and far less handsome than Paderewski sand Hofmann s playing needs to reach magnificent proportions before one is able to forget his bad boyish dispositionBut one does forgetFor his musicianship and key wizardry are things of great beautyDespite the fact that his scorn sometimes leads him to abuse the pianoin the way of crude smashing blowsthere isin the Schumann workfor instancewhich displays him at his bestnever a moment in which he loses a rythmic grasp that is deeply satisfyingAnd when he choosesand doesn t lose his temperhe
