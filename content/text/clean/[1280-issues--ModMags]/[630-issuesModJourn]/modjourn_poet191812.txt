to its Fund The magazine began under a five year endowment which expired Sept 30th 1917 and although the endowment has been partly resub scribed for another period this Fund is insufficient and expenses are constantly increasing The art of poetry requires if it is to advance not only special sympathy from a discriminating public but also endowment similar to that readily granted to the other arts All who believe in the general purpose and policy of this magazine and recognize the need and value of such an organ of the art are invited to assist thus in maintaining it  VOL XIII NO III  DECEMBER 1918  PEACE SUDDENLY bells and flags Suddenly door to door Tidings Can we believe We who were used to war  Yet we have dreamed her face Knowing her light must be Knowing that she must come Look she comes it is she  Tattered her raiment floats Blood is upon her wings Ah but her eyes are clear Ah but her voice outrings  Look she is here she lives Beauty has died for her Soon where the shrapnel fell Petals shall wake and stir  Agnes Lee   THE HARP  Strike strike Already the strings of me quiver  Vibrate  With the imagining of your fingers Strike set free these aching sounds Strike harshly wildly loud  O strong beautiful  Till the strings cry out  Till the strings are torn with the fierceness of your hands  delight With the agony of their own music With the agony of their releasing  Broken Still  I HAVE FOUND MY BELOVED  I have found my beloved in the time of apple blossoms O pink blossoms white blossoms fragrance of love I have found my beloved in the time of apple blossoms O beauty and fragrance Soon will the apples push out their green sides Soon will they round into happy red The boughs of the trees will bend and be weighed down  with that ripe burden   Helen Hoyt  STATURE  I must stand on tiptoe to reach your lips I must stand on tiptoe in my soul to reach you To reach the height of my own love It is what I want to have you tall  NAME  My name is beautiful to me when you say it A new name No one ever had this name before Your voice changes it It is a new name Sacred Never till now spoken or any touch laid on it  DIFFERENCE  I say so many things I cannot understand your silence I give so much I cannot undertsand your always taking I change myself so willingly to please you I cannot understand that you have never thought of chang  ing   UNITY  Your love is terrible Oh do not love me so much Sometimes there are moments Fear comes to me because of our love That it is a prison about me That it owns me Owns the separateness of me  Oh let us be two again We who have been so intricately one  Let us be two  For finally there is never one And unity is but annihilation  Dissolve me from this closeness Give me back to myself  Myself to my own self again Oh let us be two Two  Beloved  HAPPINESS BETRAYS ME  Happiness betrays me  Happiness slays me  Sorrow was kind and loneliness was my sweet companion Denial gave me good gifts Now freedom is a bondage upon me   Helen Hoyt  And smoothness slackens my feet I will find my way back to the thorns I will find my way back again to the good thorns and steep  ness  Happiness betrays me Happiness slays me  TRIUMPH  O Triumph dear Triumph Splendor of self delight and exaltation I have felt you in little moments Moments of nothingness More than in great times of applause I am alone walking or dancing Suddenly you come And lift up my hands as if they would reach the stars I could shake the stars and the world for sheer merriment of  power I will run laughing and shouting with you through all the streets of the world  INTERLUDE  I will dance and wrap myself with drooping veils about me Turquoise blue and green and blowing amber How their pale their weightless touch Will be delight upon me Their dusky colors melting and returning   I will raise them before me I will let them fall from me Every swaying movement Sways them and curves them Every swaying movement Sways them and folds them Dropping about me Down from my shoulders over my fingers Laying their touch over my fingers Over my feet drooping and dropping with grace upon me  Flowing of color flowing of shadow flowing of motion Flowing upon me flowing from me O sliding shadow sliding color veils of motion  AT THE MUSEUM  At last we let each other go And I left you Left the demand and the desire of you And all our windings in and out and bickerings of love And I was wandering Through corridors and rooms of pictures Waiting for my mind to sharpen again Out of its blur  Now was stern air to breathe High rational Clear of you and me   Helen Hoyt  The medals in their ordered cases Round and clean edged Cooled me The tossing and tumbling of my body Drew itself into form Into poise Looking at their fine symmetry of being  MEMORY  I can remember our sorrow I can remember our laughter I know that surely we kissed and cried and ate together I remember our places and games and plans we had The little house and how all came to naught Remember well But I cannot remember our love I cannot remember our love  OH WE SHALL MEET  Oh we shall meet But how shall be that meeting Oh we shall meet But there is no repeating The look the word the laugh that used to be There is no meeting now for you and me We shall be there in the room together near But the old delight that made old meetings dear   Will not return the leaping of will to will Only a husky word a trembling that tries to be still And we shall look at each other then unbelieving the past Knowing that even our sorrow could not last  ASCENSION  Our love died and went into the grave We piled stones upon it Both of us piled stones upon it We did not dream that it would ever rise again  Now it has come forth With new life not as its old life With radiance about its head Lifted apart from us beyond the unhappy clay  THE ROOT  Love faded in my heart I thought it was dead Now new flowers start Fresh leaves outspread Why do these flowers upstart And again the leaves spread Oh when will it be dead This root that tears my heart  Helen Hoyt   VOLUNTEERS  TEARS IDLE TEARS  Tom Shelley Virginia  I was born in Ireland I ve been in every country of the world I am an American citizen seventeen years I m only thirty nine years old And yet in spite of all that The army won t enlist me as a soldier For the great war  I ve been a sailor over twelve years And can tell about the building of ships Ever since the first one was made Of the hollow of a tree And still they won t take me in This war is hard on me  I can teach how to cut a dug out canoe Or stretch one of skins I ve sailed in a reed raft off Australia And in the surf boats of Madras I can help to build ships And explain how the keel of a vessel Is only the old log minus the dugout Ask me why the fo castle of old Egyptian ships Was shaped up into a neck like thing   And finished off into the figure of a bird Or a beast It was religion that s what it was I can tell all that And yet they won t enlist me  I can talk about paddle propulsion galley oars Sail steam and oil And there s not a splice eye splice chain splice Or rigging shroud that I don t know I ve a union card too And yet I can t make a hit  I ve been wrecked off the Brazilian coast Where the bay of the Amazon looks like another ocean And off the east coast of Ireland too Almost in sight of the rocks of Holyhead I know what sea power is and that no man or nation Will ever command the waves for sea power Is not from guns but from winds I know everything I ve said And yet I can t get a show  They take these young fellows Why can t I enlist too I can do more and I know more And I can stand more and fight more In a day than any of them   Arthur D Rees  CARES THAT INFEST THE DAY  Frank Maine Maine  Two months ago I left railroading And from that hour leisure and peace Yesterday I came here from New York On a tour to the West But I listened to the tap of a drum and enlisted  My coming here was only a step In my usual path in drifting westward To the wheat fields for the harvest I follow the growth of the grasses First to Texas where the wheat ripens early Then with the prairie people And the southern harvesters From field to field I go Northward up the Missouri and Red rivers Until I reach the wheat bonanzas of the Dakotas And then northward still Beyond the blue stems of Minnesota And up to Manitoba Where the harvesting ends for the wheat Can not grow when Winter shrivels the grass  Then southward I would turn To the orange groves and fruit fields Of California drifting perhaps to Mexico And the oil fields for the winter   And after that begin the round again And wander to Texas for spring ploughing And later northward once more With summer returning for its harvest It s a good life but beyond me now  LONGINGS FOR HOME  Charles Hastings Delaware  My home is in Laurel But they speak my name there no more Yet the place is still green in my memory And I m only twenty five I may be forgiven  But tell this to my people there for me And put it in their paper That I ve wandered many miles from home Since the dark night when I ran away And now I ve enlisted for the war My path is too winding and hidden For them ever to find clues of me But I d like my people to know that I understand now How a weary life and destroyed ways Take many a man away from home  I know too the selfishness of the stony cities now For in them my Buddy and I Once threw dice for the only job to be had And I took to the road and its taunts   Arthur D Rees  And he took the job But both of us had known together The cold glitter of the stars over us all night When the heart sides of us thumped hard And were sad  But I want my people to know nothing of that Tell them only that after seven years wandering My heart is growing peaceful again And my face bright with looking toward my home And that the army is my refuge Where I m happy and content  Tell them too that on my first furlough  I ll be returning to them in the old house  Returning returning  There s in that word something beautiful  To me now  But my young laughter is returning in silence And my fierce waywardness is returning in sorrow Tenderly to the mother who thought She would see her son no more  UNSEEING THE SEEN  Joseph Quinn Carney s Point  I was a chemical worker in a powder factory  Sometimes even cutting the powder myself  In preparation for other people to shoot it   But now I ve enlisted for the army Wanting to do my duty I suppose And shoot it myself  And then I ll tell you I want to forget a few things about women But haven t yet discovered the formula The harder I hunt the more I remember And the more I pretend indifference The crazier is my madness  When I told the recruiting officers I was not married I meant it in the sight of God For I knew they couldn t see as God sees I m not living with my wife at any rate Another fellow is and I m going to war  How well I remember the long kiss in the dark That made her mine Something I would and wouldn t forget Oh well it s easy to be chaste when you re old And to say what you think s best to be done But virgins won t go to virgins for advice And so we all live and learn And agree at last it may be With the scrupulosity of the passionless  Yet after all why should I care It s only that I can t help caring that s all   Arthur Ù Rees  The finest moments of life anyway Are moments of some intoxication And each mouth must drink from its own goblet Be it even the cup of wrath  All battles are for the beauty of women Falling into love flying into passion This invaded Belgium And nuptial fires kindled the flames of Louvain  THE MELANCHOLY PLAINT OF THE RUSSIAN SONG  Ilya Vladimir Pennsylvania  I was born in Russia but I am fighting for this land Because I make my living here Yet saving none of it In my merry moods my motto is Keep money coming and going Then you ll always have some Many people s money is mouldy  But in other moods I forget about that For I m always looking across the seas To the Russian plains and longing For the broad flood of the Mother Volga river And the gloomy forests of Smolensk I can see the lynxes fighting With the falcons there   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  And even hear the ravens croaking at night As they divide the dead  My mother I left there and my sister My mother weeping as a river runs For that s how we sing it in our old songs And my sister weeping as a streamlet flows Their tears falling like the tender dew Upon the willow bushes and the moss  They don t know where I am now Yet I can almost hear them singing of me As in our ancient poem Thou bringst O Sun thy warmth and joy to ail Where doth thy burning beam on Ilya fall And hast thou in the desert dried his bow With sorrow sealed his quiver and with woe And I can almost see them wandering everywhere for grief Into the forests of dark oak Where Sorrow cuts them like an axe Into the fields where it mows them like a scythe And into a damp earth grave That Sorrow like a spade has dug for them Among the weeds the beggars and the blind  I hope none of this is true But I don t know  Arthur D Rees   AMERICA  She is young and beautiful my country Mother of many children Years ago A slim girl running on sea sand She heard Niagara shouting the message of mountains And the great lakes singing softly Of prairies that swing in the wind How could she stay keeping soft and white her rich and  powerful hands She rose and walked like the sun into the west Sowing reaping felling the forests Digging out coal and iron and gold from the hills Onward outward Past rivers like a sea And mountains that snowily secretly kiss the moon Out to shining Arizona athirst in the sun And Oregon shaggy with firs by her northern ocean Whom the silver Sierras link together forever  And she gathered the children of many races into her arms And said Hate dies here be brothers She lifted the humble to the high place And the proud she rebuked with a laugh  At ease in her strength she lay dreaming When the heat of the day was done But suddenly far away   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Out of the thick black night out of the past Came the terrible booming of guns The tramp of armies marching over fallen towers Over cottages collapsing into dust And through the iron clamor she heard agony calling The bitter cries of children starved and driven Of young girls ravished Of boys ripped open on the trench strung field And the dull groans of the old Prodded from the flaming door  Once more the incredible thing The tyrant gorged and ruthless Spitting red war in the face of the world Once more Freedom at bay threatened defiant Calling her chosen Lifting her rainbow colored flags to the sun  My country Beautiful and strong Startled slowly arising Hearing at last the insult Feeling the crimson mist in her eyes My country stood up tall to the height of the world Straight and tall From the blue Caribbean at her feet To her coronal of islands Strung from the Arctic sea And she summoned her states   Harriet Monroe  And breathed in their ears the iron vow of war War to the end to the death war to the life War of the free for the free till the world is freed  She gathered her armies Her millions of sons And loosed them like flakes of snow to the storm Bidding them cover and smother and put out forever The abysmal abominable fires In massive drifts she hurled them Over land and sea and through blue trails of air Crystal souls of youth That seized the sun in a flash And flung it to whatever eye would see Spending giving their light lest it be put out in the wind She bade them move innumerably mass on mass To smother and quench forever the infernal fires And nourish the new spring The flower fringed hope of the world  O my country Seeker of freedom How shall she pause in the ways of peace or war On her long march toward the far off invisible goal The city of white towers The city of love Where the nations of the earth shall meet in joy together And the souls of men shall be free  Harriet Monroe   LA NEIGE A POUGHKEEPSIE  Lorsque la tourmente eut vêtu  Chaque toit d un glaçon pointu  Couvert chaque route de neige  Poughkeepsie avait hier comme par sortilège  Transformé sa grisaille en de fraîches clartés La neige est couleur de gaîté Le ciel est gris la terre est blanche Sous l avalanche  L endroit dont je veux vous parler  N est point bâti pour s exiler  L ennui s y trouve en étalage  C est plus froid qu une ville et moins beau qu un village Mais sous les fleurs d hiver Poughkeepsie a souri La neige avait partout fleuri Le ciel est gris la terre est blanche Sous l avalanche  Quittant son air morne et banal  Poughkeepsie en costume hivernal  Prend la grace d une bourgeoise  En sa robe de mariée Elle apprivoise Le voyageur qui passe et sur ses froids chemins La neige a tracé des jardins Le ciel est gris la terre est blanche Sous l avalanche   Lysiane Bernhardt  Le champ se confond aux chemins Et chaque plaine sans confins Est une steppe en robe claire  On n entend plus marcher les vivants sur la terre  Souffle un mort à son frère il doit neiger là haut La neige a donné son assaut Le ciel est gris la terre est blanche  Sous l avalanche  Décembre est triste à ce qu on dit Mais quand la neige resplendit Et changeant les pierres en marbre  û une maison fait un palais et quand chaque arbre  Porte une floraison riez gosses et gens La neige est un autre printemps Le ciel est gris la terre est blanche  Sous l avalanche  Lysiane Bernhardt   THE GARDEN OF THE WEST  The Jackal is the only animal that ventures into the Desert The ancient Egyptians believed that every person had a soul in the form of some animal a creature within the creature At death the soul was released and was escorted across the Desert by the Jackal lo a mysterious Heaven called the Garden of the West  A Butterfly We leave the yellow palms behind The yellow green date palms that stand At the borders of the land There are no talking leaves out here The desert way is blind to me Will the white sand be kind to me What is it that I fear As I leave the palms behind  The Jackal The sand is neither cruel nor kind I count the toll I count the toll Here a soul and there a soul Day and night night and day Over the white silent way To and fro I go Without rest From the Fountain of the Nile To the Garden of the West  The Butterfly I played with flowers yesterday Are there no flowers by the way Is the Desert never stained   Louise Driscoll  With pomegranate petals rained  To the sand by some light wind  Sweet with peach or tamerind  We leave the singing boys behind  Their songs were kind Jackal Jackal what shall I find  The Jackal There was singing yesterday And tomorrow boys will sing But today you and I Will not hear anything There is lotus by the Nile Stranger flowers in the West But the way between is not Adorned for any guest You will find no songs nor flowers nor rest  The Butterfly Jackal Jackal when we reach The Garden s lovely gate Will there be one to welcome us  With honey delicate With flower wine and pollen dew Who will wait for me and you  The Jackal First there is the scent of it Faint sweet far There s a little wind that tells  Where the lemons are Birds that crossed the sand with me Sing in a high silver tree   The Butterfly Jackal Jackal yesterday I was a girl Last night I felt my wings Suddenly unfurl Last night a butterfly Saw a little girl die  The Jackal Over this white silent way Day and night night and day Souls are led by such as I All surprised that bodies die Every soul stirred to surprise When its body dies  The Butterfly Jackal I was round and sweet I had small swift hands and feet And a high silver voice Fit for little tinkling words Sweet as honey on fresh curds I was made to rejoice I was made for love men said Brown of skin and eyes with red Parted lips and I was fed With love words that singing boys Thought about me in their hearts I was skilled in those girl arts That are piercing sweet I had  All that makes boy glad The Jackal Day and night night and day Over this white silent way   Louise Driscoll  Such as you and such as I Still go by still go by Milk child and beard of white Power and glory faith and might Little love girl such as you Trailing wings of gold and blue All go the way I know Sad glad eager distressed From the Fountain of the Nile T o the Garden of the West  The Butterfly Jackal Jackal he sang to me He touched me tenderly He brought me lilies wet with rain White lilies without any stain Of color on their loveliness Their perfume a caress The singing boys seemed far away That day I did not hear the birds nor see The people go by me I only knew A mist of tears with his face Shining through  The Jackal Day by day and year by year Tales like this I hear T o every soul its bitterness Seems like loneliness To every soul love is shown   Standing alone Every love seems to be Unlike love s great company Never was love like mine they say Day and night night and day The Butterfly Jackal I was slim and straight With little round breasts delicate Throat curved like a crescent moon Bud that would be flower soon Warm and quick pulses were mine I was like a draught of wine Lifted to his thirsty mouth Like a soft wind from the South Touching him caressingly Wrapping him about when he Saw a singing boy go by Silently With his lute unstrung at rest And a lily on his breast The Jackal The days go by the days go by The same sun crosses the same blue sky The same stars shine in the depth above And men still dream of undying love The Butterfly Jackal it was a little thing The boy said he could no longer sing He showed me his lute unstrung at rest And I gave him a lily to wear at his breast    Louise Driscoll  The Jackal The days go by the days go by And still there are gardens sweet with bloom Lovers vow and lovers die Tomorrow s lovers stir in the womb  The Butterfly Jackal Jackal I saw his face It was strange to me Then I saw a shining knife Flash suddenly I felt my wings of blue and gold Unfold unfold  The Jackal First there is the scent of it Camphor and myrrh Cinnamon and cedar And heavy juniper Then there is the sound of it Flute and canzonet They who reach the Garden Soon forget  The Butterfly Jackal Jackal how do you know That souls forget You come and go at the Garden s gate But have you entered yet  The Jackal A soul less thing am I That cannot die The gate is shut to me Eternally   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  But there is a bird that sings In the silver tree A red bird like a jewel set In a filagree Of little shining leaves And he sings to me  Come with your souls for here await All garden joys primordinate The wind comes over a deep blue pool It is never too warm it is never too cool The roses are never open wide And no one knows that he has died  He who comes through the garden s gate  Is never afraid or desolate On little paths and wind and wind  He shall unwearied pleasures find  He shall know beauty s last secret  And he shall forget he shall forget  Come with your souls there is no fate That death shall not alleviate I am the Voice that calls to men  Deep in their hearts they hear me when  I sit and sing in the silver tree You were not and you shall not he  The Butterfly Jackal Jackal I would not go I would remember I would know   Louise Driscoll  When he comes over the still white way That you and I have come today Jackal Jackal let me wait And watch for him at the Garden s gate  The Jackal Day by day and year by year Prayers like this I hear Every soul would wait to say Some last word about yesterday Every soul if it could  Would be better understood The Butterfly Jackal what is the scent that comes Breath of flowers and fragrant gums Jackal what is the song I hear So piercing high and clear Jackal Jackal I see A shining silver tree The Jackal Your wings are trembling Gold and blue thing They flutter and unfold Blue and gold You saw a girl die Butterfly I may not rest In the Garden of the West The way across the Desert I have shown Now I go back alone  Louise Driscoll  COMMENT  CHRISTMAS INDEED  HE signs swing high for a Christmas of deeper joy than this country has known since the abolition of slavery or than the elder world has known since the Marseillaise was first sung in Paris It will be a joy sanctified by the sorrows of sacrifice and deepened by a hope which must persist through whatever disorders delay its fruition  For looking back over the mortal hazards of the past four years one can find no earlier moment so indulgent to the world s hope of a new era an era of freedom and fulfilment for the oppressed peoples of the earth The mediaeval craft of feudalism with its autocrat commanders its crew of super slaves its guns of force and murder its camouflage of pseudo scientific efficiency has been rammed smashed to scrap and splinters by that trim slim powerful modern destroyer the armed will to freedom of the democratic nations At no earlier moment of these sanguinary four years and four months could the end of the war have brought such confidence that this deed had been completely done  Wars have a way of deciding things said a wise friend in the chaos of the first upheaval when war seemed to most of us nothing but obliteration and destruction an impossible absurdity an anachronism If this war decides that kings must go that weak peoples whether formed into states or not shall be protected and encouraged instead of   Christmas Indeed  coerced that the nations shall gather together in closer brotherhood and rule their intercourse by the moral law then it will be worth all it has cost in precious lives and heaped up treasure in ruin and agony and desolation If its flaming night lead us to such a dawn we must rejoice on Christmas day lift our hearts high above their sorrows  Rejoice but not forget Rejoice but not relax The spiritual discipline which has brought the world to a point of high resolve has but begun if the new purposes are to be achieved Great leaders are needed as never before for the huge international task and powerful crowds to follow them and achieve it It may be that the hardest fight is before us for now the foe is not armed and uniformed set out in battle array with noisy guns and grenades but secret silent insidious in our own ranks even in our own hearts  We have need of all the constructive forces for the remaking of the world And foremost of the constructive forces especially the getting together forces are the arts The arts even the language arts are universal they unite the peoples of the earth If there is to be either actually or spiritually a league of nations the arts of the different nations must be developed and encouraged toward expressiveness and mutual understanding  In this country peopled by all the races of the earth we have the greatest opportunity for international sympathies ever offered to a powerful nation We were all deeply moved last month when the Czecho Slovaks met in Inde   pendence Hall and signed their declaration of independence on the table sacred to our own But unless we feel the meaning of this symbol unless we comprehend the ideals of these resurrected states now struggling each for its place and flag we shall lose the affection and gratitude which they accord us now From these races should come deep enrichment to American intellectual and artistic life but rather if we accept what they bring us if we encourage their separate racial individualities than if we try to make them over to the prevailing Anglo Saxon pattern  This magazine s experience may serve as a hint and prophecy of that enrichment Last month two of our three prizes went to immigrants from Syria and Italy and during the past six years of our history many races have been represented in POETRY either by poems written in English by citizens or residents of foreign birth or by translations adaptations interpretations from their literature and folklore Not only France Italy and Belgium have been brought nearer to us in this way but also nations more remote Russia Serbia the Ukraine Roumania Syria Armenia China Japan Bengal as well as a few nearer home Peru Nicaragua and certain of our own aboriginal tribes All this beauty and racial sincerity should be preserved not destroyed loved and cherished not ignored We of these United States possess the nucleus of an enlightened internationalism  On that vivid and romantic Thursday the seventh of November when the cosmopolite crowds of our cities took   Christmas Indeed  in their own hands prematurely but with spontaneous rapture the celebration of the end of the war one truth was borne in upon me through the paper snow storm the gaudy improvised processions the chorus of laughter and tooting and yells the flicker and flutter of ten million flags of the many allied nations all that wild irresistible drama of joy the truth that we e pluribus unum are already a union of many races that we have slipped far away from the Puritan tradition from the Anglo Saxon genealogical tree and that there is no reason why we should not become as freely and multitudinously expressive as a forest of many kinds of trees shaking their innumerable leaves in the wind  H M  TRIBUTE TO JOYCE KILMER  As friend of an earlier time  If my tribute is tardy at least my friendliness is not I am informed of Joyce Kilmer s virtues by at least an intimacy of probably ten years earlier knowledge of his charms I hold him among the quiet lovers of the earth for Joyce without love would not be Joyce No term could have fitted him then better than dear Joyce and I see no reason for the change even though I did not see him for several years before his sudden departure Joyce was dear to anyone who had the qualities of endearment and the understanding He had the quiet way of being genuine His fervors as I knew him were chiefly for   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  poetry then and if I am not wrong he enlarged them to include the larger to him at least aspects of religion I shall want to believe in his then rumored conversion to the catholic faith after a reading of The Hound of Heaven because as I have said he had the heart to adore and the will to worship He was naturally there in his convictions and that poem by so great and so genuine a poet would certainly have moved him strongly on the way as it is certain to move anyone who has the gift for getting poetry even without the ecstatic uplift the frantical pursuit involved in the theme The bravery of Joyce was not and could not have been boisterous it was strong in its simplicity and its reality He had the faith in beauty which showed him the way to his heroisms He was not sham ever Setting aside the whether or no of his greatness as an artist in poetry it is safe to assume that he is entirely worthy of association among the poets who have died for the cause at hand as well as the many of the good ones among the living who are at least devoted however silently however openly to the idealism inherent in it Some may speak and some may act and some may wish to speak and act Joyce was a simple actor without affectation without histrionic gesture His acting would be just the doing his death proves that He did what he could in an unoffending way He had intelligence of a fine order to contribute and he and I do not see how he could have changed from the sure indications of our esthetic youth and his younger manhood had only the wish to fulfil the   Tribute to Joyce Kilmer  mission of beauty conferred upon him through talent and it may be real genius which was the business of heroism His sense of command could only have been equal to his quality to obey He obeyed the laws of poetry so well in their significance that he must splendidly have shown his gifts as soldier for the laws he so ardently wished to serve  I speak across the years in his behalf as almost boy for though I was then a little older we were on very common terms of friendship with a very special interest in things poetic He loved the simplest things then because he was himself among them perhaps the simplest so easy to understand for his unmistakable humanisms both as poet and as man It was the period of The Summer of Love first book I think and full of first book s ardors and preferences I never thought of Joyce as bright in the cheap sense of sophistication in books I never even thought of him as so clubby as the list of names of the societies to which he belonged now indicates I never thought anything about him really because there was enough to think of him a warm gentleness insuperable boyish faith in things worthy of faith and a gift for the quieter intimacies of two or several loving the same thing which was more apt then to be poetry than any other special thing Being the more unobtrusive radical in my esthetic tastes I never really knew just how much we got together in matters of art for I seldom have that kind of factitious relationships with anyone In the sense of association of differences of   tastes I was something essentially on the outside with Joyce Kilmer We respected each other in the manner of friends for these probable differences I never came together in the same sets as an ambitious person I saw him out of hours so to speak If I did not care so much for his poetic company it was so slight a difference that I never considered it important I am not of Joyce s camp now poetically speaking and yet I know the quality to be genuine in him and will leave assertion to those who want to stretch claims for dead men It is for me a sadness the wish to overstate one s case in the hour of sympathy I myself would never say great about anyone or anything until I could be sure of it but it is easy to say genuine because it is true  Joyce Kilmer is I think just as good as Brooke and Seeger one way or the other These men will live not by the wondrous achievement that is claimed for them but by the fixed ardor that was in them for the ideals of poetry It is best to set aside affectations even in the presence of personal privation And if you knew Joyce Kilmer you would surely say something is missing from our so obvious earth If there is a sure state of heaven and a certainty of continuity in that place I am willing to believe that Joyce is there just for the cleanliness and the sincerity of him If he prayed I am sure he prayed as when he smiled or confided there was no mistaking these attitudes in him He had a fine fund of laughter in his eyes alone and made your moment rich with an affluence   Tribute to Joyce Kilmer  of genuine warmth He looked at you his qualities My addresses to him in person though they shall never reach him in the ways we think we may reach those who are endeared to us and who by strange evidences are not here will somehow strike their note I am quite on the outer circle of this eternal event geographically speaking but it does not prevent me from raising an old time voice in praise of the first years of knowing Joyce Kilmer and I say dear Joyce now to him as I have frequently written it to him from the Maine woods where then the Summer of Love came as sentimental tribute to a something that made us glad to know each other And so it is and shall remain forever dear Joyce for me not Joyce as the latest among heroes not Joyce as the least or the greatest among poets but simply Joyce a fine thing living in a fine quiet way  Dear Joyce I salute you with a faithful heart You have always held the old place in my perhaps seemingly so vague and some might even say so vagrant esteem I do not ever lose or discard essences Joyce I retain the flavors of those entities that were ever rich to my sense and you are most certainly among them How fine must be the faith in renewals and recoveries What a brightness it would lend to the swift going of such as you who made us somehow fond of them who knew the deeper shades of friendship The beauties of death and heroism are not for the conspicuous alone they are not merely for men with a name W e must confer them upon the multitudes of the   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  nameless if only that they are men or boys with a strange and certain feeling in them of an intangible something sublime in the pursuance of the office or charge entrusted them The singer may sing of such beauties but the voiceless leave no clue excepting the very certainty of their humanisms and the somehow inevitable pride in sacrifice They are among the many who smiled the smile that is in itself among the deathless victories Joyce was one who smiled for the world unstintedly he literally had the heart for smiling It was the cherished inevitability of him as a person fine and distinguished in this fineness It is best to remember what we have and not what we lose If you had Joyce however slightly or however intimately as friend you had a something genuine and it did not fail of its sure yet simple confidence and you had his presence to remember  I want to remember you ardently at this hour dear Joyce A pretty piece of symbolism that you should have belonged to the Rainbow Division surely you should be at home in that company with all your ardors and faiths to pour You are I am certain captain in it now  Marsden Hartley   Carl Sandburg s New Book  REVIEWS  CARL SANDBURG S NEW BOOK  Cornhuskers by Carl Sandburg Henry Holt amp Co  Recently I overheard two stenographers attack the meaning of the line My country tis of thee offspring of God Save the King They couldn t arrive at the sense if any of the phrase tis of thee until one of the girls settled dispute and eavesdropper by concluding It s poetry and poetry always sounds wrong  Cornhuskers never sounds wrong It s true of the man and to the man who set it down Every man who does this is contributing a new form to art Such a man is a maker deserving of the rare name poet I can t imagine Sandburg deliberately sitting down in studio apparel subjecting a mood to a traditional form inventing nice even lines and capping them with nice even rhymes I can imagine him hiking along down a smelly old alley suddenly smitten with a mood like a blow between the eyes I can see him sticking a Pittsburg stogie into his mouth fire and smoke in a corner of his head a stub in one hand moth eaten note book in the other his heart haunted eyes haunted hands haunted all of him haunted by the mood and all of him concentrated into trying to get the pesky thing down lest the pesky thing get him down Then he slinks home tries it in the crucible of self criticism or tailors it a little sews on the buttons surveys himself in it and it in himself and mood and form as like as twins   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  descends upon his family and then into the open outside world And along the Loop at the Chin chin chow Club up and down the Michigan Bull the cry runs not Unto us a poem is born but Unto us a Sandburg I can t imagine Sandburg sitting down to a theory The theory comes after as it did with Whitman To recall an old axiom There is no ought in art and to revise it somewhat none except the ought which is enslaved by and enslaves the particular mood adventure tale of the individual per se who is himself and not any other individual in the world that is was or will be Sandburg is such a fellow  There are influences yes Something of the Whitman who loved to catalogue people and places something of that imagism which has reduced expression to an irreducible minimum something of the O Henry who loved the colloquial America or the American language as distinguished from the English something of the homely outlook and gesture of that other Illinoisian Lincoln But below and above and around these influences and above and below and around the major Sandburg apart from them life Something of himself something of the self outside of the particular imagination embodying the particular adventuring something of those other selves the other fellow mountains plains cities civilization barbarism something of passion love observation humor irony something of hate the weapon of love Each plays its phrase in the tune that is Sandburg   Carl Sandburg s New Book  The book is divided into five groups Cornhuskers Persons Half Known heather Leggings Haunts and Shenandoah Prairie the long opening poem is composed of glorious patches and irreconcilable bits of journalese I feel the same enthusiasm and doubt in connection with the other long poems The Four Brothers and Potato blossom Songs and Jigs Sandburg is essentially a lyrist and the lyricism of these three chants is sporadically interrupted Of this however the poet himself is conscious when he says in Potato blossom  The story lags  The story has no connections  The story is nothing but a lot of plinka planka plunks  And in the final line Let Romance stutter to the western stars Excuse me Otherwise what a coon song and dance it is I d like to hear Bert Williams chant it and Walker alas if he were only alive cake walk it with his wife Ada Walker Maybe they ll do it in nigger heaven where it belongs  River Roads introduces Sandburg s varied use of the device of repetition Prairie Waters by Night his unfailing and precise marriage of sensations of eye and ear Early Moon his immense devotion to mysticism in a translation of the past into terms of the future a phase re echoed in Falltime Is there something finished And some new beginning on the way and again in the wonder breathing chant Caboose Thoughts with its colloquial opening It s going to come out all right do you know marching erect all the way to the colloquial close They get along   and we ll get along The Sandburg heaven is nothing but the common street seen upside down It s a place where the Lord isn t even a president but a sort of composite of his own kin of earth folk and earth things The imagistic poem Loam concentrates this thought in three memorable stanzas or should I say paragraphs  Wilderness is a remarkable presentation of many sided selfhood with a zoo as symbol Sandburg s self confessed animals being wolf fox hog fish baboon eagle and mocking bird Folk who grow soft with horror in the presence of egoism won t find this blast nice Individualists will frame it over their beds lest they forget the refrain I came from the wilderness and its visionary twin I am a pal of the world In immediate contrast comes Chicago Poet I saluted a nobody I saw him in a looking glass An egoist knows himself so heartily and well that he and no other like him has your true humility with its appreciation of his proportionately small stature in the measurement of distances between earth and sky Further persons half known include Nancy Hanks Inez Milholland Adelaide Crapsey Don Magregor Bilbea Southern Pacific Huntington and Southern Pacific Blithery a washerwoman some bull frogs Buffalo Bill Jazbo the singing nigger and finally Child Janet and Child Margaret the two Sandburgians to whom the book is dedicated The songs hobnob with a rogue s gallery of moods in which the poet himself is one of the jail bird cronies In Chicago Poet he steps out of his cell for a sunny morning with his kind   Carl Sandburg s New Book  and in Jazbo he goes back to his cell to the tune of I went away asking where I came from  Leather Leggings shows man in his multifarious mad activity making the ball of earth a small thing It is the history of science reduced to a poem The same adventure arises out of Prayers of Steel from Lay me on an anvil O God up to Let me be the great nail holding a skyscraper through blue nights into white stars The first group is the America of open spaces this third group the America of cities It is felt by an American partly a Swede and expressed in the American language partly English such is the inference and effort as told in Jabberers I rise out of the depths with my language Interior is after the manner of William Carlos Williams so Sandburg delights in confessing It s a manner worth examining The title Psalm of Those who Go Forth before Daylight explains itself There are slants at many towns Keokuk Buffalo the Springfield of Lincoln and Lindsay Joliet Natchez New Orleans Testament reminiscent of Robert Carlton Brown closes the group It is cheerily addressed to undertakers the nanny and billy goats the blue smoke of flowers and the dirty fisted children who ll have the disposal of Sandburg s remains in their keeping  The fourth group Haunts is quietly and mellifluously a love group The tone of the series is epitomized in the line To day let me be mono syllabic a crony of old men who wash sunlight in their fingers and enjoy slow  pacing clocks Mammy Hums concerning the right   shoulder of a strong man I lean on with the underlying motive throughout Then the face of sleep must be the one face you were looking for is as beautiful a thing as free verse has ever contributed to poetry unless you prefer Handfuls a cameo of baby red gamblers drifting on to gray gamblers handfuls again The war group Shenandoah doesn t stand up to the other group It is permeated for the most part with propaganda for propaganda s sake a fault with Sandburg much more prominent in Chicago Poems than in Cornhuskers However Old Timers and the brutal Gargoyle are authentic as art And the last speech in Grass I am the grass let me work unconsciously prophesies the Sandburg song coming up through the soil of the future when average poets and poetic controversy are laid away and Carl Sandburg is laid away  There are certain well intentioned mortals who as soon as they hear the mere name poetry quake at the knees crumple up grovel and then indulge in a whole category of spasms to the tune of that monstrosity idol worship There s nothing that I personally detest more than such eye sores They are priest and congregation of every institution and gathering where Art and Uplift are synonymous Fellows like Sandburg there are a number of them over here now don t belong to such devotional conclaves Sandburg lives on the level If he has dealings with poetry he has them on the ground common to both as to trees rocks and streams Whether it s a slugging or wrestling match they engage in an old fashioned foot race or whimsi   Carl Sandburg s New Book  cai dance you ll find their four arms in a clinch Any lofty lady like pirouetting on her part any silk hat doffing on his are strictly taboo Such customs belong to the limbo of lies and hypocrisy Whitman kicked the first of them thither fellows like Sandburg are gradually booting the remainder I advise anybody who is disturbed by this non pretty theory to attend a prize fight That s the game something more than a boxing contest a man undertakes with art  Not long ago I was hunting about an obscure Massachusetts village in search of the lair of a certain reputable man poet There was no postoffice to guide me not even a general store Fine haven for a recluse I thought Sundry small boys stray cats and dogs couldn t direct me to him A battered looking old gentleman of the New England of yesterday finally volunteered You ask them men a huskin corn they ll tell you where he lives And they did Well the first thing I saw on the table of this man poet Robert Frost by the way was a copy of Sandburg s Cornhuskers Does the coincidence require commentary  Alfred Kreymborg  STEPHENS AS ELEGIST AND ANTHOLOGIST  Green Branches and Reincarnations by James Stephens  Macmillan Co  When Mr Stephens is writing as an Englishman writes  is it not true that one misses what is perhaps most distinc  tive James Stephens His threnodies The Autumn in   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Ireland 1915 and The Spring in Ireland 1916 although very lovely with a familiar loveliness of phrase and texture something that no one who cares for the classic tradition of English verse can fail to appreciate yet do not out Lyc idas Lycidas One wishes somehow that Mr Stephens had given his grief expression in his own words or in what one would imagine might have been his own words if he had not accepted the solace of this high lineaged English elegiac mode This is not said for the sake of being captious or because one is incapable of appreciating classic values or because one wishes a poet to fiddle forever on one string It is simply that one wonders what Mr Stephens would have written if he had not perhaps felt that he must write something to stack up with Lycidas Adonais Thyrsus or The Scholar Gypsy If Mr Stephens wanted a model would not Clann Cartie from Reincarnations have been a  better one  O Wave of Cliona cease thy bellowing  And let mine ears forget a while to ring  At thy long lamentable misery  The great are dead indeed the great are dead  And I in little time will stoop my head  And put it under and will be forgot  With them and be with them and thus be not  Ease thee cease thy long keening cry no more  End is and here is end and end is sore  This passage is the beginning of The Autumn in Ireland  1915  It may be on a quiet mountain top  Or in a valley folded among hills  You take your path and often you will stop   Stephens as Elegist and Anthologist  To hear the pleasant charter of the rills The piping of a wind in branches green The murmuring of widely lifted spray As long boughs swing And hear the twittering Of drowsy birds when the great sun is seen Climbing the steep horizon to the day  Reincarnations is a book of translations or rather adaptations from Irish writers of from one hundred to three hundred years ago Keating O Bruadair O Rahilly Raftery and others The poems number about thirty and in them the poets sing chiefly of such eternal themes as love the beauty of woman old times gone and the poet s poverty very much indeed of the poet s poverty Apropos of the fact that poetry is now classed as an essential industry although nothing is said of a minimum wage for poets it is perhaps pertinent to quote this from The Apology  Often enough I trudge by hedge and wall Too often there s no money in my purse Nor malice in my mind ever at all And for my songs no person is the worse But I who give all of my store to all  If busybody spoke to you of it  Say kindly man if kindly man do live  The poet only takes his sup and bit  And say It is no great return to give  For his unstinted gift of verse and wit  Mr Stephens says in his Note which is really a preface although inconspicuously placed at the back of the book an undemagogical proceeding which one wishes more poets would follow They all sing of their poverty Keating as a fact to be recorded among other facts O Rahilly in a   very stately and bitter complaint and Raftery as in the familiar Behold me now with my back to the wall playing music to empty pockets but O Bruadair lets out of him an unending rebellious bawl which would be the most desolating utterance ever made by man if it was not also the most gleeful  Here is O Bruadair s Righteous Anger  The lanky hank of a she in the inn over there Nearly killed me for asking the loan of a glass of beer May the devil grip the whey faced slut by the hair And beat bad manners out of her skin for a year  That parboiled imp with hardest jaw you will see On virtue s path and a voice that would rasp the dead Came roaring and raging the minute she looked at me And threw me out of the house on the back of my head  If I asked her master he d give me a cask a day But she with the beer at hand not a gill would arrange May she marry a ghost and bear him a kitten and may The High King of Glory permit her to get the mange  This has an eloquence that ought to console any poet for the lack of a more cumbersome endorsement of this world s goods At least the poet has what others have not he has his vision and if he is twice blessed as these Irish poets are he has his wit And certainly James Stephens is twice blessed in this respect Reincarnations is a book for poets There is much in it that they will most appreciate One would like to quote some of the poems in praise of women Nancy Walsh or Mary Hynes from Raftery and Sean O Cosgair is a remarkable little poem about a young man who was drowned But the best thing after all is to own the small book for oneself A C H   in the Irish Mode  IN THE IRISH MODE  My Ireland Songs and Simple Rhymes by Francis Carlin  Henry Holt amp Co  If about half of the poems in this book were omitted the  reading would be more of a pleasure the task of searching for the really excellent poems should not be imposed upon the reader Mr Carlin has a natural facility for rhymed verse or rather for rhymed song Much of his work is good much only passable and a small number of the poems are exceptional Among the latter may be mentioned  The Little House The Virgin s Slumber Song Unknown My Neighbor The Scotstown Visitor The Three Songs Keimaneigh Maureen Oge The Field of the Fort the ballads MacSweeney the Rhymer The Ballad of the Mother s Revenge the brief epigrams The Cuckoo Wine Reflection and Sleep  Of course as the title indicates the poems are chiefly of Ireland and will therefore appeal especially to the little clan of those who are also of Ireland or devoted to the glamour of Celtic verse But it must not be supposed that this is verse of the pseudo Celtic school It is as I think genuinely Irish and in what Thomas MacDonagh called the Irish mode The ballads have the genuine folk or bardic quality and only occasionally does one feel that the inspiration has not kept time with the beat of the song as in Gleann na smol which Burns would have done better or in The Dead Nun which makes one think regretfully of Wordsworth perhaps all the more so because it is about   Lucy However there is enough intrinsic beauty in the book to give Mr Carlin a passport to a wider audience if but this wider audience had been considered in the arrangement In poems such as The Little House there is a delightful simplicity all the more welcome after the undue emphasis placed upon the bizarre image by many young ultra modern writers  Bathing birds beneath a spout Of mountain water screened about With supple ferns and tufts of grass Are on the highway I would pass  And little bows of colored foam Arching mountain streams that roam Beneath a bridge of stone and moss Are in the meadow I would cross  But the little house where I would call Has a ruined roof and a tumbled wall Beyond that streamy meadow s grass On the road that I shall never pass  The last stanza of Maureen Oge has this simple expressive touch  O Maureen Oge beyond the sea I wait not only with the rose For in the house where you should be  The walls are lonesome for your clothes  One would like to quote more from the book if there were space A C H   First Books of Verse  FIRST BOOKS OF VERSE  Renascence and Other Poems by Edna St Vincent Millay  Mitchell Kennerley  Here is a very exceptional first book a book which is achievement rather than promise One would have to go back a long way in literary history to find a young lyric poet singing so freely and musically in such a big world Almost we hear a thrush at dawn discovering the ever renewing splendor of the morning  Renascence gave me the only thrill I received from Mr Kennerley s 1912 anthology The Lyric Year It was so much the best poem in that collection that probably it s no wonder it didn t receive any one of the three prizes Reading it once more after six years discipline in modern poetry I am thrilled again The surprise of youth over the universe the emotion of youth at encountering inexplicable infinities that is expressed in this poem and it is a big thing to express Moreover it is expressed with a certain triumphant joy the very mood of exultant youth and the poet gets a certain freshness and variety into a measure often stilted The poem is too compact for quotation it should be read entire Possibly its spiritual motive is summed up in the couplet  God I can push the grass apart And lay my finger on Thy heart  This poem is much the biggest thing in the book indeed one almost sighs with fear lest life closing in on this poet as on so many others may narrow her scope and vision   It requires a rare spiritual integrity to keep one s sense of infinity against the persistent daily intrusions of the world the flesh and the devil but only the poet who keeps it through the years can sing his grandest song  But even without Renascence the book would be exceptional Not so much for Interim though its emotion is poignantly sincere and expressed without affectation as for some of the briefer lyrics Such songs as Kin to Sorrow Tavern The Shroud are perfect of their very simple and delicate kind and one or two of the sonnets are admirable Time does not Bring Relief and Bluebeard A few of the best songs were first printed in POETRY though we find no acknowledgment of this fact in the book which by the way let me heap coals of fire on the publisher s head is beautifully designed and printed Among the poems unfamiliar to our readers perhaps God s World is typical of the poet s mood and manner  O world I can not hold thee close enough Thy winds thy wide grey skies Thy mists that roll and rise  Thy woods this autumn day that ache and sag And all but cry with color That gaunt crag To crush To lift the lean of that black bluff World World I cannot hold thee close enough  Long have I known a glory in it all But never knew I this Here such a passion is  As stretcheth me apart Lord I do fear Thou st made the world too beautiful this year My soul is all but out of me let fall No burning leaf prithee let no bird call  H M   First Books of Verse  Green Leaves by Florence Ripley Mastin James T White  amp Co  This book is a slight but delicate offering A grave sincerity and a technique simple at its best to the point of austerity distinguish the revelation of penetrating intimate feeling The poet is not yet sure of herself or her method One finds old fashioned poetic artificialities words like lethed yea perchance give pause with But oh and Quoth he lines and over wrought figures especially in the latter half of the book In the better poems however the emotion is carried without strain  The first section called Indoors presents The Teacher and brief portraits of her grade school pupils Our readers will remember a few of the latter especially the one of David who failed ending  You will always fail You are too big to succeed In the swift years before death  From the Outdoors section a number of brief poems might be quoted if we had room A Manhattan Yard Were One Wish Mine Touch A Girl s Thought or this The Reporter  In the March stillness  I heard a woodpecker  Up the hill  Near the blue painted sky  He had captured all my news  Tap tap went his type writer The third section Remembrance seems to come mostly from an earlier or poorer vintage Ditto the fourth a   group of war poems called Bare Branches in most of which the poignant emotion of the moment gets poetized away On the whole however this is a promising first book  H M  Etchings by Robert Earl Barclay Privately printed Cam  bridge Mass  Here is a tiny book of tiny poems in free verse poems which earn their title because they are well and simply drawn without loose or straggling or unnecessary lines The author is still under twenty a boy student in the U S N Radio School of Harvard But though he is in the war his subjects are far from warlike like the style they are of an extreme simplicity So simple indeed are these little poems that it requires a second glance to discover that they have texture The light shines through them and does not disdain to show their pattern to reveal a certain quiet distinction of style Here is one for example called Spires  From the hill  I saw the spires of many churches  But in the valley  I found them empty  With here and there  A beggar  Resting on their porches  One night over a year ago a young lad from Grand Rapids stalked over to see me through the snow and read some promising but much too expansive poems He had worked his way up from nothing in his native town it was an exciting child epic of studying and going to school while he earned money at paper routing lawn mowing any old   First Books of Verse  way toiling and moiling all day long and half the night And now he was working his way through the University of Chicago and never for a moment doubting his goal  Can there be any connection between that boy and this young radio sailor poet between those poems so over expansive and these so sharply drawn H M CORRESPONDENCE  THE DAY OF VICTORY  The following letter to the editor seems such a vivid picture of the mood of city crowds on that wonderful Monday the eleventh of November that we risk the author s wrath by publishing it  Oh why can t I just cry in the streets I am so small and impotent and the emotion is so big a great suffocating sweetness There are millions of paper doves fluttering down from the  tremendously hugely happy skyscrapers The sun is in a frenzy to stretch its rays hot silver a little further than on the usual days  New York is born New York is wedding her people Here are flags for a marriage dress here are thousands of paper doves for rice  Soon the crowds will forget that they were all poets today They will cover it with the pall of misery in their houses But we shall be here to make them remember  This day is pay day This day is millennium Beauty shall never Die into nothingness It is a joy forever   Down here you would not see one ugly face They are all beautiful They look at the children in the middle of the street and laugh  The people are all doing crazy things they are all loving loving loving  It s not drunkenness it s not Someone is crying someone is crying The misery is not forgotten but it is being requited and those who cry are thanking God  If I were not so mad so insane with my happiness with the sense of our tremendous power I d believe in God now E C  A WORD OF PROTEST  W e are in receipt of the following explanation from one of the editors of The Chicago Anthology  Dear Editors Referring for Mr Blanden and myself to your recent review of The Chicago Anthology I would remind A C H that her two poems contained in our book were selected from copies of POETRY furnished by H M in A C H s absence Since the latter in furnishing us similarly with her own poems assured us they represented some of her best work we inferred that the same judgment applied to those by A C H It would seem unfortunate that the worst poem she ever wrote appeared in a magazine of which she was and is associate editor  It has never been decided whether poets are trustworthy judges of their own work However practically all our selections were made in the case of living writers from poems submitted by the poets themselves as representing their best work The greater or lesser significance of certain poems is of course also a matter of individual taste If A C H will name those major poets which she implies are unrepresented in our book we shall be glad to hear of them The unwillingness of Mr Masters to be included was a matter of regret to us The reasons given were simple and frankly commercial  If Mr Jones in his introduction adopts a semi apologetic tone  anent the conservative principles of selection he also defends  H M against the charge of ultra modernism in her conduct of POETRY If the compilers of The Chicago Anthology confess that   A Word of Protest  to them the tares as yet outweigh the wheat in modernist verse they need scarcely accept the stigma of old fogeyism That more rigid principles of selection were applied to the new forms than to the old we do not deny but the chronological scope of our work explains this Minna Mathison
