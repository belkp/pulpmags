Back to the bridges, always the bridges. I'll talk forever. I'm damned if I'll sing. Don't you see that mine is not a singing people. We're just a lot of muddy things caught up by the stream. You can't fool us.   Don't we know ourselves? Here we are, out here in Chicago. You think we're not humble? You're a liar. We are like the sewage of our town, swept up stream by a kind of mechanical triumph—that's what we are. ## ## ## On the bridges. On the bridges. Wagons and motors, horses and men—not flying—just tearing along and swearing. ## ## ## By God we'll love each other or die trying. We'll get to understanding, too. In some grim way our own song shall work through. ## ## ## We'll stay down in the muddy depths of our stream. We will. There can't any poet come out here and sit on the shaky rail of our ugly bridges and sing us into paradise. ## 4 SHERWOOD  ANDERSON We're finding out. That's what I want to say. We'll get at our own thing out here or die for it. We're going down, numberless thousands of us, into ugly oblivion.   We know that. ## ## ## But say, bards, you keep off our bridges. Keep out of our dreams, dreamers. We want to give this democracy thing they talk so big about a whirl. We want to see if we are any good out here—we Americans from all over hell. That's what we want. SANG LONG AFTER Was that all you could do, Mary? Loving and giving—that's all right. ## ## ## You went pretty far.   I admire you for that. Do you remember the night in the upper room when I cried.   I wanted you then.   God knows I wanted you then. Down below the others were waiting, Judas and Peter and John—old men, pretty wise.   I was crucified for them. At night when the stars came I went out alone— long after that. ## ##       ## How did you know what you did know, Mary? That puzzled me.   How could you go that far and stop? ## SHERWOOD  ANDERSON                               5 Was that all you could do, Mary? Loving and giving—that's all right. THE CORNFIELDS I am pregnant with song. My body aches, but do not betray me. I will sing songs and hide them away. I will tear them into bits and throw them in the street. The streets of my city are full of dark holes. I will hide my songs in the holes of the streets. ## ## ## In the darkness of the night I awoke and the bands that held me were broken. I was determined to bring old things into the land of the new. A sacred vessel I found and ran with it into the cornfields, into the long fields where the corn rustles. ## ## ## All of the people of my time were bound with chains. They had forgotten the long fields and the standing com.  They had forgotten the west winds. ## ##  ## Into the cities my people had gathered. They had become dizzy with words. Words had choked them. They could not breathe. ## 6 SHERWOOD  ANDERSON On my knees I crawled before my people. I debased myself. The excretions of their bodies I took for my food. Into the ground I went and my body died. I emerged in the corn, in the long cornfields. My head arose and was touched by the west wind. The light of old things, of beautiful old things, awoke in me. In the cornfields the sacred vessel is set up. I will renew in my people the worship of Gods. I will set up for a king before them. A king shall arise before my people. The sacred vessel shall be filled with the sweet oil of the corn. The flesh of my body is become good. With your white teeth you may bite me. My arm that was withered has become strong. In the quiet night streets of my city old things are awake. ## ## ## I awoke and the bands that held me were broken. I was determined to bring love into the hearts of my people. The sacred vessel was put into my hands and I ran with it into the fields. In the long-cornfields the sacred vessel is set up. ## MARY  ALDIS                                     7 c. s. I cry out I am one of the people, I belong to the masses, I live with them, sweat with them, Eat their bread and share their hunger, Bear on my back their burdens And in my soul their grief: Then— I write And write and write and write For you to listen, Listen and falter: I sing of their quick-snatched joys Of the abundant life,— Living and loving, giving birth and dying, That goes on in the east side, And you in your swivel chair You turn sick with envy! I proclaim I am one with the people— And all the while I know I am a thousand million miles Beyond you and the people. ## 8 MARY  ALDIS WHERE IS GOD? I went into the forest seeking God. I looked up at the trees, Tall, straight, aspiring, Not needing God. I went down to the sea And watched the waves Rolling relentlessly, Indifferent to God. I saw two wrens love-making, Twittering and chirping shrilly in the sun, Not bothering about God. A woman's arms were around me, Upon her breast I slept And forgot I wanted God: She gave me—a little, But—where is God?## MITCHELL DAWSON 9 NORMA LEE: A LUSTRUM Dark eyes of Father Joseph, You taught her The luminous escape From the intricacies Which Sister Laurenta Had looped about her.   .   .   . Would she with the midges Hover out of copses Through the lanes and gardens? Would she with the midges Flitter moons and midnights In profligate succession?  .  .  . The panels drawn by her Had but revealed The dearth of what she sought: There was darkness and no glow. And as she turned within her thoughts She saw the gropings of her year Like green mice Hopping trepidant On crimson rugs.   .   .   . Somewhere in the cellar of the night She had left The burnt-out perfumed tapers She had lit for him, And the songs that danced about them ## 10 MITCHELL  DAWSON Had perished With their spent fragrance. Groaning She stumbled With heavy feet Up the huge steps of morning.  .  .  . He was forever—this other— He was forever taking fishes On air adventures; He was forever wondering At their gaspings. But now The meshed rings of her laughter Caught him Dangling Quivering to her pleasure, And his strength Could not cut The silver of it. —How happiness stroked her! PEBBLE Like a frog on a lily pad Was his love, Puffing and popping its eyes; The deadly pebble of her laugh Ended its green antics. Droll are the quivering muscles Of a stricken love. ## MITCHELL DAWSON 11 AT CETARA One April morning On the beach at Cetara He read : "I am waiting at Salerno, Come-" And his love rose like a slender cone Piercing into heaven (Far above the brown-legged men and women Dragging at long nets Of writhing silver fishes) So that he spun Like a dizzy top On the apex of his love. SMOKE The last touch of your hand Creeping into my hand Was like the blue savor of burning leaves, Whispering of bare branches And moon-cold nights. ## 12 ALFRED  MACARTHUR NOCTURN (Adaptation from inscription on a Hiroshige print) In the days of the gods men walked on air. And now this bridge is as beautiful as though its piers were clouds. ## MAX MICHELSON 13 MY CITY An Autumn Memory The full moon glides in its own smouldering wings of light Or cuts through or under mouse-colored clouds. Your face is an upright lily in the night's concave. Your lips taste cold at first.   In you Your heart is restive With gentle resentment at itself. Your body and your clothes melt and you become . A faintly-luminous goddess—moved and compelled By yourself and by other gods. And overhead—is it the footstep of your mother In her four yards of space?   No,— It is a heart Trembling in rhythm with ours. PORTRAIT OF MY FATHER An oak tree with a somewhat short trunk But whose branches reach up high Is moving.   It is moving slowly and rhythmically Under the sky which always closes it in anew, And feeling this sky as a gently moved log feels perhaps The water and the wind which carry it. Night and day which it encounters are Like rain and the dust; and the sky Soothes the worm-wounds, And they slowly draw up. "PRETTY BABY" Like the trembling luminous edge of a thick humid cloud Is the curve of your face near the chin; ## 14 MAX  MICHELSON When you smile, light and shadow flit around Bewildered and happy. Your thoughts are like a wreath Of city smoke at sunset: Delicate, air-bright, yet also a little blackish and murky. The flesh and bones of your body Are tender, giving Like the flesh and bones of a young chicken; And you hold it out like a glass of wine: Feeling it trickle down the throat, and the little gurgles With the pleasure of pure charity. THE JOURNEY Dog-like you accepted caresses But your body and your soul lay curled Waiting   .   .   . Then with your frail torso, With your soft flesh, With your feet less strong than iron You set out on your journeys— Your eyes of gleaming gold And the smile about your mouth Like white foam. I admired you. But when I caught a glimpse Of the hand behind you— The big ruthless hand, I did not know whether to admire Or to pity you. I almost blamed you Like other folk. ## MAX  MICHELSON                                  15 EXPECTATION Some morning on opening the door of my office I shall find a baby in old green onyx : Its torso will be heavy about the lower part And somewhat contorted; The feet in a whimsical strained position But   with   no   arms—just   rounded   off   at   the shoulders ; Its lips and eyes will be frozen in a tantalizing and almost obscene grin. On its back will be painted in beautiful colors but In a hieroglyphics which no one ever saw A message which will be quite plain to me. KATE, SIXTEEN, READS POLLYANNA Pollyanna, that's I, though I Am a little different. I live behind the rainbow On the air—for I am light. My cheeks are made of gold, And my nose is a lily with its stem Split lengthways. My mouth is made of four roses— Two up and two down. It's my chin that laughs—my little chin Is still of flesh and my eyes are the same. Some distance away but not too far Is HE dressed in a summer suit. (I know it's snowing elsewhere.) His face is of flesh but his body and head Are airier. He looks at me but can not come. Perhaps some day there will be A cloud-storm, and—. ## 16 CARL  SANDBURG INTERCESSIONS OF CERTAIN FAT MEN AT   THE BLACKSTONE God of the Swag Belly: Listen to the prayer of the fat, fierce men who are hungry. Women we buy kick high heels and sing for us and sleep with us And always our muscles ask for new women and younger flesh to hold And the call is for redder lips than we sucked last night. Come across, O God of the Swag Belly, And give us lobsters and sea food we never tasted before, New stuff with strange names picked up in far off places, Let us hear a coon song that will tickle us into wanting a dance, Ragtime out of the slums and the underworld reckless with kisses, Let us have a softer plush to sit on And bring fresh peaches and wild chicken before us. JINX I am the jinx of love, an old iron billiken Close by all kissers in the dark and huggers. I remember Sappho.   She broke her little fists Beating my head when a man who had a date with her never came And she wrote songs looking at my iron grin.## CARL  SANDBURG 17 Thousands know me every night. There was a laundry girl—maybe you read a piece in the paper about her this morning— She turned on the gas and left a note nobody loved her. I was in the room when she fixed the jet and lay down murmuring, "Good-by everybody." They sing for me and die. I am the jinx of love, an old iron billiken. COOL TOMBS When Abraham Lincoln was shovelled into the tombs, he forgot the copperheads and the assassin  ... in the dust, in the cool tombs. And Ulysses Grant lost all thought of con men and Wall Street, cash and collateral turned ashes .   .   .   In the dust, in the cool tombs. Pocahontas' body, lovely as a poplar, sweet as a red haw in November or a paw-paw in May, did she wonder? does she remember? ... in the dust, in the cool tombs? Take any streetful of people buying clothes and groceries, cheering a hero or throwing confetti and blowing tin horns . . . tell me if the lovers are losers . . . tell me if any get more than the lovers ... in the dust ... in the cool tombs. ## 18 WILLIAM  SAPHIER (Machine Shop Notes) THE GEAR CUTTER This master is a slave to three greedy gear cutters. They shape arms and legs on solid bronze disks and blow stray chips on his garment, beard and face, the face of the Man who was born on the road to Egypt. He heeds not the winged chips nor the dirt laden drops of oil. He walks on brown velvet clouds, anoints the machines with oil and the disks are faces of children. THE PLANER Grey iron casting is rocked on a planer like a baby in a cradle and a sharp edge removes layers, like time, days, from this sleeping weight. The bent machinist is also rocked on the bed of the planer. It adds days to his life. AT THE ANVIL Dan never spoke a word in his life. His eyes are blooming, black roses. His arms are oak trees in winter. He shapes a woman's dream with a sledge out of a bar of red-hot steel on his anvil. ## WILLIAM  SAPHIER 19 A DREAM (Near the tempering furnace) The intense little furnace is his life. the cold-rolled steel tool in it his heart, the chunk of cyanide in his hand the world and he is God. A gay move brings the cyanide to his open mouth, he bites and the world is dead. AT THE LATHE The lathe twirls a steel shaft that will roll out gold. The boulder-shouldered man over it shoves the tiny hard tool deeper into the heart of the steel and smiles at the moaning shaft. There is a new baby in his home. THE OLD OILER The swift shafting chants of the hardships of a hot road. The old oiler shakes a can over the thirsty bearing, with the same gesture as his daughter shakes a toy before her crying first babe. His own road is hard and hot but the smiles of his hard muscles keeps it clear. ## 20 WILLIAM  SAPHIER AT THE BENCH He rides on a chisel through sheet tool-steel, his hammer is the whip and he swings it to the beat of his heart. He loves his chisel, hammer and sheet tool-steel, this Hun with a harem woman's eyes. And every fresh gash is an added charm to the ones he loves. AT THE VICE A bastard file cuts his days while he is held tight like the piece of copper in his vice. And he is swayed over it with a file in his two hands to shape it for another life. He has long ago passed the scratch that means stop and he moves on as if blind. There is a silk gowned worm gnawing at his heart. ## MARJORIE  ALLEN  SEIFFERT 21 FROM THE MADISON STREET POLICE STATION I, John Shepherd, vagrant, Petition the Park Commissioners For wider benches. My soul Has long been reconciled To the prick of gunny-sack, (Oh well remembered fleeces!) And to rustling vests Of newspaper, And to the chill of rubbers on unshod feet,— But to the wasteful burning of dry leaves, God's shepherd's mattress, Never ! Descendant of ancient ones Who tended flocks and watched the midnight sky, My forebears saw the Eastern Star appear Over Judaean hills. Where do your flocks graze, gentlemen? Are there no sheep or shepherds any more? All day long I sought the flocks, And came by night to a wide grassy place, And in the morning someone brought me here. THE PEDDLER Hark, people, to the cry Of this curious young magician-peddler Seeking a golden bowl. He wanders through the city And offers useful tin-ware ## 22 MARJORIE ALLEN  SEIFFERT For all the ancient metal You have left to rust In the dim, dusty attic Or mouldy cellar Of your soul. He refuses nothing— Rusty nails, Which may have played their part In a crucifixion— For ten of these he will give A new tin spoon. The andirons Once guarding hearth-fires of content, Now dusty and forgotten In an obscure corner— He will give for these A new tin tea-kettle With a wooden handle. And for this antique bowl Fashioned to hold Roses or wine? The eyes of the peddler glisten. Oh woman, If acid reveal Gold beneath the tarnished surface He will gladly give you His hands, his eyes, his soul, His young, white body— If not, A mocking laugh And a bright tin sieve To hold your wine And roses. ## MARJORIE ALLEN  SEIFFERT 23 PORTRAIT OF A GENTLEMAN Tower of stone Rugged and lonely- My thoughts, like ivy Embrace my memory of you, Climbing riotously, wantonly, Till the harsh walls Are clothed in tender green. Tower of stone— Stark walls and a narrow door Which speak: "You who are not for me Are against me— If you are mine, Enter!"  .... But who would be prisoned In unknown darkness ! Tower of stone Rugged and lonely, I dared not enter and I would not go Till clasping you My arms were bruised and torn. ## 24 EUNICE TEITJENS THE CITY WALL About the city where I dwell, guarding it close, runs an embattled wall. It was not new I think when Arthur was a king, and plumed knights before a British wall made brave clangor of trumpets, that Launcelot came forth. It was not new I think,—and now not it but chivalry is old. Without, the wall is brick, with slots for firing, and it drops straightway into the evil moat, where offal floats and nameless things are thrown. Within, the wall is earth; it slants more gently down, covered with grass and stubbly with cut weeds. Below it in straw lairs the beggars herd, patiently whining, stretching out their sores. And on the top a path runs. As I walk, lifted above the squalor and the dirt, the timeless miracle of sunset mantles in the west, Dusk spreads her purple wings And beauty moves immortal through the land. And I walk quickly, praying in my heart that beauty will defend me, will heal up the too great wounds of China. I will not look—to-night I will not look—where at my feet the little coffins are, The boxes where the beggar children lie, unburied and unwatched.## EUNICE TIETJENS 25 I will not look again, for once I saw how one was broken, torn by the sharp teeth of dogs. A little tattered dress was there, and some crunched bones   .   .   . I need not look.  What can it help to look? Ah, I am past! And still the sunset glows. The tall pagoda, like a velvet flower, blossoms against the sky; the Sacred Mountain fades, and in the town a child laughs suddenly. I will hold fast to beauty! Who am I, that I should die for these? I will go down. I am too sorely hurt, here on the city wall. MY SERVANT The feet of my servant thump on the floor. THUMP they go, and THUMP—dully, deformedly. My servant has shown me her feet. The instep has been broken upward into a bony cushion. The big toe is pointed as an awl. The small toes are folded under the cushioned instep.   Only the heel is untouched. The thing is white and bloodless with the pallor of dead flesh. But my servant is quite contented. She smiles toothlessly and shows me how small are her feet, her "golden lilies." THUMP, they go, and THUMP! ## 26 EUNICE  TIETJENS THE DANDY He swaggers in green silk and his two coats are lined with fur. Above his velvet shoes his trim, bound ankles twinkle pleasantly. His nails are of the longest. Quite the glass of fashion is Mr. Chu ! In one slim hand—the ultimate punctilio—dangles a bamboo cage, wherein a small brown bird sits with a face of perpetual surprise. Mr. Chu smiles the benevolent smile of one who satisfies both fashion and a tender heart. Does not a bird need an airing? CHINESE NEW YEAR Mrs. Sung has a new kitchen-god. The old one—he who has presided over the household this twelvemonth—has returned to the Celestial Regions to make his report. Before she burned him Mrs. Sung smeared his mouth with sugar; so that doubtless the report will be favorable. Now she has a new god. As she paid ten coppers for him he is handsomely painted and should be highly efficacious. So there is rejoicing in the house of Mrs. Sung. ## EUNICE  TIETJENS 27 THE LADY OF EASY VIRTUE; AN AMERICAN LOTUS, So they called your name. Yet the green swelling pod, the fruit-like seeds and heavy flower, are nothing like to you. Rather, like a pitcher plant you are, for hope and all young wings are drowned in you. Your slim body, here in the cafe, moves brightly in and out. Green satin, and a dance, white wine and gleaming laughter, with two nodding earrings—these are Lotus. And in the painted eyes cold steel, and on the lips a vulgar jest; Hands that fly ever to the coat lapels, familiar to the wrists and to the hair of men. These too are Lotus. And what more—God knows ! You too perhaps were stranded here, like these poor homesick boys, in this great catch-all where the white race ends, this grim Shanghai that like a sieve hangs over filth and loneliness. You were caught here like these, and who could live, young and so slender—in Shanghai? Green satin, and a gleaming throat, and painted eyes of steel, Hunter or hunted, Peace be with you, LOTUS! ## 28 MARK  TURBYFILL LAST SEASON We two Storm-sheathed buds Slept Upon the wild plum bough. Oh, once in April, late, When the slow bee pushed Through the sweet, thick air, And the oval slug Lurked at the roots of grass— Oh, once in April, late, We sprang—white— Into bloom and light: You loved the yellow of my throat, And I went mad with the honey of your lips ! Now Keen days Have flung our slightness To the ground; No brown bee swings by, And bare the bough Where our swift life Once clung. SLOTH In the sun A date-palm sways, And one brown girl Struts copiously. O days! Pass thus over me. REALITY Low-burnt light In the waning night In the brown, broken station: These ## MARK TURBYFILL 29 The present things, Far off And little felt. But pressing close The too uncertain thought of you, O Greatly Wished, And the feel of dear love upon my throat. Clattering into the brown, broken station, In the waning night In the low-burnt light; Falling across my thighs, And cursing me With liquor-stinking breath— These were the ways Of three tired whores. One shivered Beneath a draggled coat; One leered From under a broad-brimmed hat; One had grey eyes, And a tinge of light about her hair. At last the train, And we went creaking on a while, Until the door opened like a mouth Vexed and sick And belched them out, A vomit on the night. One had grey eyes, And a tinge of light about her hair. These The present things, Far off, And little felt. But pressing close The too uncertain thought of you, O Greatly Wished, And the memory of dear love upon my throat ! ## 30 ALFRED   KREYMBORG HEN BEING Being cooped in a crate, cooped in a crate, as one is cooped in crates on West South Water Street of the filthy, stinking Chicago River— being cooped in a crate with more hens than a crate can hold, is not an existence, even for hens, but it gives one a sense of safety, monotony, warmth and interest I don't deplore. What I deplore is this being yanked by the neck, yanked by the neck, yanked by the neck, and being flung, crammed and damned by a common, filthy, stinking West South Water Street poultryman of the filthy, stinking Chicago River, from one crate to another, one crate to another, one crate to another. It's enough to make an old hen squawk, and I'm an old hen, if you please, a roosterless, eggless, chickenless hen! There is ever the hope in a hen like me that the next crate will be one's last ## ALFRED   KREYMBORG 31 so this being slammed from one crate to another, one crate to another, one crate to another, will reach a cadence. I'm an old hen, if you please, a roosterless, eggless, chickenless, and I can endure filthy, stinking West South Water Street of the filthy, stinking Chicago River of the filthy, stinking Loop of Chicago, Illinois, but wring my neck ere my time if I don't squawk truth for all hens when I affirm this one crate to another, one crate to another, one crate to another, is no hop forward but a hop backward from being cooped in a crate, cooped in a crate. Being cooped in a crate, a hen might find something to scratch, though it's only one's neighbor, and one is sans claws, sans even a feather, to scratch her with! Oh Poultry Man: You are truly the God of hens! ## "Others" will continue publication at 200 West South Water Street, Chicago.
