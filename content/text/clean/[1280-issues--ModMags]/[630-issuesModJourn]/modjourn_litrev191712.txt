A LETTER FROM REMY DE GOURMONT Ezra Pound AT A TIME when most of our now vocal and prominent American bellifists were still determined that the United States should take no part in saving civilizationI desired to found a magazine which should establish some sort of communication between New YorkLondon and ParisTo that end I asked the assistance of MrYeatswho is without question the greatest living poet of these islandsof Ford Madox Huefferfounder of The English Reviewand in no way connected with the present management of that periodical and of Remy de GourmontNone of these men refusedOther complications delayed the projectThe present arrangement with The Little Review is the ultimate result of the schemeIf De Gourmont had lived he would now be among our contributorsHis last letter concerning the project is therefore of personal interest to our well wishersIt is of far wider interstin so much as there are few amiable and dispassionate critics of Americaand that De Gourmont s few words on the subject are not without some enlightenmentCher MonsieurJ ai lu avec plaisir votre longue lettrequi m expose si clairement la nécessité d une revue unissant les efforts des Américainsdes Anglaiset des FrançaisPour celaje vous servirai autant qu il sera en mon pouvoirJe ne crois pas que je puisse beaucoupJ ai une mauvaise santé et je suis extrêmement fatiguéje ne pourrai vous donner que des choses très courtesdes indications d idées plutôt que des pages accompliesmais je ferai de mon mieuxJ espère que vous réussirez à mettre debout cette petite affaire littéraire et que vous trouverez parmi nous des concours utilesEvidement si nous pourions amener les Américains à mieux sentir la vraie littérature française et surtout à ne pas la confondre avec tant d oeuvres courantes si médiocrescela serait un résultat très heureuxSont ils capables d assez de liberté d esprit pour liresans être choquésmes livres par exampleelle est biendouteux et il faudrait pour cela un long travail de préparationMais pourquoi ne pas l entreprendreEn tous les paysil y a un noyau de bons espritsd esprits libresil faut leur donner quelque chose qui les change de la fadeur des magazinesquelque chose qui leur donne confiance en eux mêmes et leur soit un point d appuiComme Vous le ditesil faudra pour commencer les amener à respecter l individualisme françaisele sens de la liberté que quelques uns d entre nous possèdent à un si haut pointIls comprennent cela en théologiePourquoi ne le comprendraient ils pas en arten poésieen littératureen philosophieIl faut leur faire voir s ils ne le voient pas déjà que l individualisme français peutquand il 1e fautse plier aux plus dures disciplinesConquérir l Américain n est pas sans doute votre seul butLe but du Mercure a été de permettre à ceux qui en valent la peine d écrire franchement ce qu il penseseul plaisir d un écrivainCela doit aussi être le vôtreVotre bien dévoué Remy de Gourmont The aim of the Mercure has been to permit any manwho is worth itto write down his thought franklythis is a writer s sole pleasureAnd this aim should be yoursAre they capable of enough mental liberty to read my booksfor examplewithout being horrifiedI think this very doubtfuland it will need long preparationBut why not try itThere are in all countries knots of intelligent peopleopen mindedone must give something to relieve them from the staleness of magazinessomething which will give them confidence in themselves and serve as a rallying pointAs you sayone must begin by getting them to respect French individualismthe sense of liberty which some of us have in so great degreeThey understand this in theologywhy should they not understand it in artpoetryliterature If only my great correspondent could have seen letters I received about this time from English alleged intellectualsThe incredible stupiditythe ingrained refusal of thoughtOf which more anonif I can bring myself to itOr let it passLet us say simply that DeGourmont s words form an interesting contrast with the methods employed by the British literary episcopacy to keep one from writing what one thinksor to punish onefinanciallyfor having done soPerhaps as a warning to young writers who can not afford the lossone would be justified in printing the followingThe Little Review 7 50aAlbermarle StreetLondon W23 October 14 Dear MrPoundMany thanks for your letter of the other dayI am afraid I must say frankly that I do not think I can open the columns of the QRat any rate at present to anyone associated publicly with such a publication as BlastIt stamps a man too disadvantageouslyYours trulyGWProtheroOf coursehaving accepted your paper on the NohI could not refrain from publishing itBut other things would be in a different categoryI need scarcely say that The Quarterly Review is one of the most profitable periodicals in Englandand one of one s bestconnections or sources of incomeIt hasof coursea tradition It is not that MrKeatsif that be his real namefor we almost doubt that any man in his senses would put his real name to such a rhapsodywrote their Gifford of KeatsEndymionMy only comment is that the Quarterly has done it againTheir MrAWaugh is a lineal descendent of Giffordby way of mentalityA century has not taught them mannersIn the eighteen fourties they were still defending the review of KeatsAnd more recently Waugh has lifted up his senile slobber against MrEliotIt is indeed time that the functions of both English and American literature were taken over by younger and better menAs for their laying the birch on my pocketI compute that my support of Lewis and Brzeska has cost me at the lowest estimate about20 per yearfrom one source alone since that regrettable occurencesince I dared to discern a great sculptor and a great painter in the midst of England s artistic desolationEuropean and Asiatic papers please copyYoung mendesirous of finding before all things smooth berths and elderly consolationsare cautioned to behave more circumspectlyThe Little Review It is a far cry from these schoolmaster tactics to Remy deGourmontand of course no Englishman or American would write as DeGourmont has writtenNor does the generation that preceded us care much whether we understand French individualismor the difference between the good and bad in French literatureNor is it conceivable that any of them would write to a foreigner indications of ideasrather than work accomplishedbut I will send you my best To the phraseIls comprennent cela en théologieI may takelaterexceptionMy present comment was intended solely to show De Gourmont s attitude toward our endeavour to publish an enlightened periodical in EnglishConcerningconcours utilesfrom ParisI hope to make definite and interesting announcements before much more time has elapsed PRUFROCKAND OTHER OBSERVATIONSA CRITICISM May Sinclair SO FAR I have seen two and only two reviews of MrEliot s poemsone by Ezra Pound in The Egoistone by an anonymous writer in The New StatesmanI learn from MrPound s review that there is a thirdby MrArthur Waughin the QuarterlyTo MrEzra Pound MrEliot is a poet with genius as incontestable as the genius of BrowningTo the anonymous one he is an insignificant phenomenon that may be appropriately disposed of among theShorter Notices To MrWaughquoted by MrPoundhe is adrunken Helot Ï do not know what MrPound would say to the anonymous onebut Ï can imagineAnyhowto him the Quarterly reviewer isthe silly old Waugh And that is enough for MrPoundIt ought to be enough for meOf course I know that genius does inevitably provoke these outbursts of sillinessI know that MrWaugh is simply keeping up the good old manly traditions of the Quarterly so savage and tartarly with its war cry Ere sa strangerlet seavearf a brick atim And though the behaviour of The New Statesman puzzles mesince it has an editor who sometimes knows betterand really ought to have known The Little Review 9 better this timestill The New Statesman also can plead precedent But when MrWaugh calls MrEliota drunken Helot it is clear that he thinks he is on the track of a tendency and is making apublic example of MrEliotAnd when the anonymous one with every appearance of deliberation picks out hisBoston Evening Transcriptthe one insignificantthe one neglible and trivial thing in a very serious volumeand assures us that it represents MrEliot at his finest and his bestit is equally clear that we have to do with something more than mere journalistic misadventureAnd I think it is something more than MrEliot s genius that has terrified The Quarterly into exposing him in the full glare of publicity and The New Statesman into shoving him and his masterpieces away out of the public sightForThe Love Song of JAlfred Prufrock and thePortrait of a Ladyare masterpieces in the same sense and in the same degree as Browning sRomancesandMen and Women thePreludesandRhapsody on a Windy Morningare masterpieces in a profounder sense and a greater degree than Henley sLondon VoluntariesLa Figlia Che Piangeis a masterpiece in its own sense and in its own degreeIt is a unique masterpieceBut MrEliot is dangerousMrEliot is associated with an unpopular movement and with unpopular peopleHisPreludesand hisRhapsodyappeared in BlastThey stood out from the experimental violences of Blast with an air of tranquil and triumphant achievementbutno matterit was in Blast that they appearedThat circumstance alone was disturbing to the comfortable respectability of MrWaugh and The New StatesmanAnd apart from this purely extraneous happeningMrEliot s genius is in itself disturbingIt is elusiveit is difficultit demands a distinct effort of attentionComfortable and respectable people could seein the first moment after dinnerwhat MrHenley and MrRobert Louis Stevenson and MrRudyard Kipling would be atfor the genius of these three travelledcomfortably and fairly respectablyalong the great high roadsThey could evenwith a little boostingfollow Francis Thompson s flight in mid airpartly because it was signalled to them by the sound and shining of his wingspartly because Thompson had hitched himself securely to some well known starry teamHe was in the poetic tradition all rightPeople knew where they were with himjust as they know now where they are with MrDavies and his fields and flowers and birdsBut MrEliot is not in any tradition at allnot even in Browning s and Henley s traditionHis resemblances to Browning and Henley are superficialHis difference is twofolda difference of method and techniquea difference of sight and aimHe does not see anything between him and realityand he makes straight for the reality he seeshe cuts all his corners and his curvesand this directness of method is startling and upsetting to comfortablerespectable people accustomed to going superfluously in and out of corners and carefully round curvesUnless you are prepared to follow with the same nimbleness and straightness you will never arrive with MrEliot at his meaningTherefore the only comfortable thing is to sit down and pretendeither that MrEliot is aHelottoo drunk to have any meaningor that hisBoston Evening Transcriptwhich you do understand is greater than hisLove Song of Prufrockwhich you do not understandIn both instances you have successfully obscured the issueAgainthe comfortable and respectable mind loves conventional beautyand some of the realities that MrEliot sees are not beautifulHe insists on your seeing very vividlyas he sees themthe streets of hisPreludesandRhapsody He insists on your smelling them Regard that woman Who hesitates towards you in the light of the door Which opens on her like a grinYou see the border of her dress Is torn and stained with sandAnd you see the corner of her eye Twists like a crooked pinRemark the cat which flattens itself in the gutterSlips out its tongue And devours a morsel of rancid butter He isaware of the damp souls of housemaids Sprouting despondently at area gates And these things are uglyThe comfortable mind turns away from them in disgustIt identifies MrEliot with a moderntendencyit labels him securelyStark Realist so that lovers oftrue poetrymay bewareThe Little ReviewIt is nothing to the comfortable mind that MrEliot ismoved by fancies that are curled Around these imagesand clingThe notion of some infinitely gentle Infinitely suffering thing It is nothing to it that the emotion he disengages from his ugliest image is unbearably poignantHis poignancy is as unpleasant as his uglinessdisturbing to comfortWe are to observe that MrEliot sObservationsareugly and unpleasant and obscureNow there is no earthly reason why MrEliot should not be ugly and unpleasant if he pleasesno reason why he should not do in words what Hogarth did in paintingprovided he does it well enoughOnlythe comfortable mind that prefers So and So and So and So to MrEliot ought to prefer Hogarth sPaul Before Felixto hisHarlot s Progress Obscurityif he were really obscurewould be another matterBut there was a time when the transparent Tennyson was judged obscurewhen people wondered what under heaven the young man was afterthey couldn t tell for the life of them whether it was hisdreary gleamsor hiscurlewsthat were flying over Locksley HallObscurity may come from defective syntaxfrom a bad stylefrom confusion of ideasfrom involved thinkingfrom irrelevant associationfrom sheer piling on of ornamentMrEliot is not obscure in any of these sensesThere is also an obscurity of remote or unusual objectsor of familiar objects moving very rapidlyAnd MrEliot s trick of cutting his corners and his curves makes him seem obscure where he is clear as daylightHis thoughts move very rapidly and by astounding cutsThey move not by logical stages and majestic roundings of the full literary curvebut as live thoughts move in live brainsThusLa Figlia Che PiangeStand on the highest pavement of the stair Lean on a garden urn Weaveweave the sunlight in your hair Clasp your flowers to you with a pained surpriseFling them to the ground and turn With a fugitive resentment in your eyesBut weaveweave the sunlight in your hair 12 The Little Review So I would have had him leaveSo would have had her stand and grieveSo he would have left As the soul leaves the body torn and bruisedAs the mind deserts the body it has usedI should find Some way incomparably light and deftSome way we both should understandSimple and faithless as a smile or a shake of the handShe turned awaybut with the autumn weather Compelled my imagination many daysMany days and many hoursHer hair over her arms and her arms full of flowersAnd I wonder how they should have been togetherI should have lost a gesture and a poseSometimes these cogitations still amaze The troubled midnight and the moon s repose I suppose there are minds so comfortable that they would rather not be disturbed by new beauty and by new magic like thisI do not know how much MrEliot s beauty and magic is due to sheer imaginationhow much to dexterity of techniquehow much to stern and sacred attention to realitybut I do know that without such technique and such attention the finest imagination is futileand that if MrEliot had written nothing but that one poem he would rank as a poet by right of its perfectionBut MrEliot is not a poet of one poemand if there is anything more astounding and more assured than his performance it is his promiseHe knows what he is afterRealitystripped naked of all rhetoricof all ornamentof all confusing and obscuring associationis what he is afterHis reality may be a modern street or a modern drawing roomit may be an ordinary human mind suddenly and fatally aware of what is happening to itMrEliot is careful to present his street and his drawing room as they areand Prufrock s thoughts as they arelive thoughtskickingrunning about and jumpingnervilyin a live brainPrufrock stung by a longing for realityescapes from respectability into the street and the October fog The yellow fog that rubs its back upon the window panesThe yellow smoke that rubs its muzzle on the window panesThe Little Review Licked its tongue into the corners of the eveningLingered upon the pools that stand in drainsLet fall upon its back the soot that falls from chimneysSlipped by the terracemade a sudden leapAnd seeing that it was a soft October nightCurled once about the house and fell asleep Prufrock has conceived the desperate idea of disturbing the universeHe wondersDo I dare Disturb the universeIn a minute there is time For decisions and revisions which a minute will reverseFor I have known them all alreadyknown them allHave known the eveningsmorningsafternoonsI have measured out my life with coffee spoonsI know the voices dying with a dying fall Beneath the music from a farther roomSo how should I presume Prufrock realises that it is too lateHe is middle agedThe horrible drawing room life he has entered has got him And the afternoonthe eveningsleeps so peacefullySmoothed by long fingersAsleeptiredor it malingersStretched on the floorhere between you and meShould Iafter tea and cakes and icesHave the strength to force the moment to its crisisBut though I have wept and fastedwept and prayedThough I have seen my headgrown slightly baldbrought in upon a platterI am no prophet and here s no great matterI have seen the moment of my greatness flickerAnd I have seen the eternal Footman hold my coat and snickerAndin shortI was afraid His soul can only assert itself in protests and memoriesHe would have had more chance in the primeval slimeThe Little ReviewI should have been a pair of rugged claws Scuttling across the floors of silent seas As he goes downstairs he is aware of his futilityaware that the noticeable thing about him is thebald spot in the middle of my hair He has an ideaan idea that he can put into actionI shall wear the bottoms of my trousers rolled He is incapablehe knows that he is incapable of any action more momentousmore disturbingAnd yet and yetI have heard the mermaids singingeach to eachI have seen them riding seaward on the waves Combing the white hair of the waves blown back When the wind blows the water white and blackWe have lingered in the chambers of the seaBy sea girls wreathed with seaweed red and brown Till human voices wake us and we drown Observe the methodInstead of writing round and round about Prufrockexplaining that his tragedy is the tragedy of submerged passionMrEliot simply removes the covering from Prufrock s mindPrufrock s mindjumping quickly from actuality to memory and back againlike an animalhuntedtormentedterribly and poignantly aliveThe Love Song of Prufrock is a song that Balzac might have sung if he had been as great a poet as he was a novelistIt is nothing to the Quarterly and to the New Statesman that MrEliot should have done this thingBut it is a great deal to the few people who care for poetry and insist that it should concern itself with realityWith ideasif you likebut ideas that are realities and not abstractionsThe Little Review NOTES ON BOOKS AND PLAYS jhTHE CRITICS hereare like country doctors who carry on their entire business with proprietary or patent medicinesThey have no scent which will lead them to discover for themselves work of exception and creationandwhen bad stuff is put before them with the goodno principles from which they may strongly declare or damnThey are merely practising reviewers who write carefully gleaned comments upon two kinds of thingsthings that come from Europe heralded and stamped with the approval of some well known critic over thereor things in this country recommended by MrsAtherton or Colonel RooseveltWhen I am offended or amused by some exceeding stupidity or sentimentality I feel a momentary impulse to do something about itbutI am a man who does not kill mosquitos I could never be a useful critic because I can never see myself taking any interest in anything beyond the work of art itselfIt is of no interest to me whether the public comes to it early or late or neverIf it were I should not try to lure or lead or goad or shame them to accept itBut to prevent my suffering I should entrench me in some creed of reincarnation and restknowing that they will have to comeI have no militant opinions of the offensive kindI have formed a few principles out of some intelligence that I contained at birth and I have kept them in spite of so called education and trainingI am quite conscious of their operating independently of my thoughtsI cannot understand Ezra Pound and Margaret Anderson when they become impatient with the American public because it won t take ArtI believe if you leave the right kind of food out the right kind of animals will get it if they are hungryIt is never a matter of impatience to me when people fail to use their brainsbut I am sometimes puzzled when they give no sign of instincts or emotionsI should never be very angry or surprised at an automobile if it refused to go if the gasoline tank were found to be emptybut I would be slightly dashed if the gasoline16 The Little Review properly ignitedgave no actionWater in the gasoline would be the obvious answer to thatI supposeand Puritanism in the blood the obvious answer to the life in AmericaThis last seems to me more of a question than an answerIt goes back to the kind of people who could adopt a religion so opposed to lifeno matter against what they were revoltingSome fundamental lack chose the religion and then chose a place to flourishSome seeds are blown upon the rocks and are forced to take root therethey soon diestarved or burned outOthers choose the rock because it is all they needIt is cheap and sentimental to talk about the nation being so youngSavages have and are producing significant and permanent ArtAmericans always talk and act as if all individualityall nationality and race consciousness were inevitably washed awayin the Atlanticfrom everyone who dared to come to AmericaIf there is to be Art in Americano fearArt will have its wayThe appaling and unholy thing is a nation that is satisfied and thinks it can exist without ArtIt has no precedentno parallel in historyAmy Lowell s Loose Criticism Miss Lowell showed a nice touch in naming her latest book Tendencies in Modern American PoetryI flared up for just a second on opening it not to find Eliot or Pound includedBut when I did not find Amy either I calmed down and discovered the reasonPound is a forcenot a tendencyEliot sprang full fledged perhapsand Amy Lowell has answered for herself in her workIt s a little hard on HDto put her in such company I am not going into a discussion of the bookMy ideas of life and art are so opposed to those expressed by Miss Lowell that to do the thing properly I should have to write another book perhaps longer than hersThe first sentence in the preface I think has been proved untrue by many artists by whom I think we can judge valuesYeats has not known there was a warJean de Bosscherea Belgian of whom I shall write laterhas created well without mentioning the warI should say from where I stand that Art and the war have only this relationthe war is only a disturbancea distant dust raised in the road by a mighty PassingArt preceeded the passingMiss Lowell believes she can understand and criticise these poets better because she knows them personallyMiss Lowell believes in friends and enemies in ArtI thought we were so far beyond the personal life criticism of a man s work that all the The Little people who ever did it were long deadOur only concern is with the poetryThe poetryif it be artcontains the ultimately diffenentiating stamp of the manMiss Lowell has become the guidephilosopher and friend of her contemporariesIn one place in the book she gently warns them againstseeing life through the medium of sex In a recent article TSEliot also took a rap atthose American poets who study Freud Why warn them or jeer them about FreudIf it has taken all the men of science all the ages to discover something of what the first poet knewwhy fear for the poetsI believe these scientists have depended entirely upon Art for their researchesLife is so short to live at allBut to live one s life and one s immortality at once is what the artist must doTo be an artist one must be born containing an intense vision of the spirit of lifehe must grip the fundamental qualities in the work of the past and in the little space of a life master a method or form of presenting himselfIf American writers have to study Freud to discover the spirit of lifein other wordsif they have to make themselves poets before they can begin to make poetryit isn t warnings and jeerings they needit s pityLife is so shortBut if reading Freud will influence any one in this country to believe that the force which produced him regulates his whole lifeif anything can make the rawness in the general attitude toward sex a little less rawboil the whole nation in FreudMiss Lowell s book is a book of loose thinkingof what I might call cliché phychologyWhen she compares poets to painters or dilates on the effects of environement she is as indiscriminate as a clubwomanJean de Bosschére A case in illustration of my talk about the critics is Jean de Bosschere s The Closed DoorJohn LaneNew York translated into English by MrFSFlintIn August 1916 we printedUlysse Fait son Lit and in January 1917L Offre de Plebs both poems now included in the bookAt the time they appeared in The Little Review not a single criticpoetry expertorFriday Supplement editor gave a sign of recognitionBut now that the poems come in a booktranslated î8 The Little Review into the one language in their reportorywith a preface by May Sinclairthis chorus of safety first in criticism bursts into praisetaking the two poems above as special examples of De Bosschers sanarchism of soul asdeep and beautiful and terrible poemsThis might be a compliment to May Sinclairbut What interests me is Jean de BosschereI can t understand why this man must be called mysticsymbolistor Catholic by anyoneEven May Sinclair discusses hismysticism If I should teil an intelligent but unread man that I had seen the sun shining at midnight in Norway I should think him a fool if he took me for a mystic and thought that I was referring symbolically to the spiritual state of the NorwegiansMy interest in telling of this aspect of nature may not have been in the fact that the sun shone at midnightbut in a more or less diverting mental game of seeing opposites as the same thing in aspectand in this way getting the most intense contrast of the two things in spiritJean de BosschereI am speaking only of the poems in The Closed Doorwrites of the aspects of lifeHe does not explainhe does not commentHe leaves you to make the emotional and intellectual connection with the spirit of lifeHe has made it for himself in silenceThere is something akin to the Norsk in the way Jean de Bosscherethe sophisticated manthe intellectualsees lifeThe Norwegians are often called mysticsAgain the intense similarity of oppositesThere is an immense simplicity of vision in the people of the North which gives them the power to see the thing as it isnot all disorganized by hopes and fears and doubts that it may beotherwiseThey too are called austereunemotionaluncompromisingYou can be emotional about life and its detailsbut you can not be emotional about the naked eternal spirit of lifenor about ArtThey exist outside of emotionsJean de Bosschere builds his poems in the same proudcleanglad way in which he has Ulysse build his house There is hardly need for him to add a tablea chestan altar This book will show you something that you would not find for yourselfI have found something in it that is my own Peter IbbetsonAmong intelligent people everywhere in the country there is a dissatisfaction with the theatreIt is expressed and dissapated by the public in little theatre movements and drama league revival The Little Review 19 meetingsby actors and playwrights in ravings at the theatrical trustsOnce in a season there may come a play like Peter Ibbctsonover which even the intelligent theatre goer takes hope and talks ofa beautiful playhere at least is something with a different qualitya play the young must be taken to see to develop a taste for the good things in the theatre etcPeter Ibbetson is the worst kind of thing from the standpoint of Drama that the stage has to offerPeter Ibbetsonmade from the book Nothing has been madeno dramaIt comes on the stage a cut down acting version of the bookand is called a playReality is forced upon the audience at every turnReality is substituted for imagination even in the dreamsIt is a wearing thing this constant frustration of the imaginationThe personality of the actors is so intrusive that in one of theintensestmoments some one in the audience whispered Oh now he looks just like Ethel I believe it would have done something for the play if Ethel had taken the part of the Lady of TowersThe concentrated Barrymore charm could have perhaps produced some kind of emotionI have never seen a Barrymore who seemed to know an emotion except as such as a human emotionAn art emotion is beyond themAs it was given the play was a kind of grown upuninspiredmetaphysical Alice in WonderlandIt dripped sentimentalityI myself had that reflex action of sentimentality called tearsBut an onion too makes me weepThe most beautiful and weepy scene is the lastin which the Lady of Towers returns from the dead to encourage the dying PeterI don t know what the book has her say about the state afterdeathbut in the play she says Peterwhere I am it is all eye and all earit is seeinghearingfeeling and smelling all in one This is indeed something to fever and struggle and die to attainIt is the state of an oysterBut the play isbeautifulThe Washington Square Players The most popular attempt to establish something better than the Broadway production in the theatre is the Washington Square PlayersAnd they are the most futileI have never seen them when they were able to create even a feeling of the theatreThe Drama must exist in its own worldnot in oursThat world is the theatreThe Drama is a creation of artthe theatre a creation of science and artThis world must be createdThe last time I saw themin a little piece of propagandaThe Family Exitthey created no more than a disturbance in publicThe Little Review There was no dividing line between the audience and the stageOne scene is a family rowBeing let in on a family row in this way is as annoying as it ever is in lifeand no differentThe Greenwich Village Theatre The Greenwich Village Theatrewhich opened last month in Sheridan Squareproved in its first bill that it was no reaction against the tiresomeness and conventions of the uptown theatresIt is no fresh start for the dramait is a Broadway theatre slightly converted to the beliefs of the little theatresa new playhouse designed and built by a real estate architect in a fascinating locationThe first playan inconsequential thing in versewas overloaded and overpowered by an extravagantly gorgeous settingdecorative and period costumesand bad actorsSidney Carlyle as the melancholy Pierrot saved it from complete futilityHe at least played with distinction and as if he had heard of a theatre beforeI think it was some other idea than his that made him play the part with so much stress and vimHis perfect resemblance to the statue of the young Augustus gave to his Pierrot a subtle ironyFania Marinoffthe Columbinecould not be borneThe second playEfficiencyillegitimately depended on the wartime feeling in the audience for its entire supportIn The Feast of Bacchus MrConroy did the best work of the companyI find the little psychological and intellectual stunts of Schnitzler just as interesting to read as to see actedThey are not dramabut if they are put on the stage they must be done by people of some intelligenceFania Marinoff s conception of the sophisticated wife and comrade of a distinguished dramatist was a brainless thinga third rate actress off stage and not an interesting oneHer voice and manners were recht ordinairein other wordsshe was crassThe Provincetown Players Where there is nothing there may still be hopeI don t exactly mean that about the hope The Provincetown Players in their bleak room in MacDougal Streetwith their home made plays and their wobbly sceneryhave a set purposeto give American plays to promote the art of the drama in AmericaThat spirit about the arts will block any one or anything from getting on and upBut in all this welter of theatres they alone have an actressIda RauhHere is a woman who contains the qualities of an actressShe is akin to the great onesBernhardltDuse and Rejanein that The Little fundamental quality and force of beingIt is such an undeniable force that even the spectator without imaginationvisionbecomes aware of it and is heldThere is an absolute lack of scientific training or direction in the Provincetown TheatreIt seems to be an art theatre of thenaturalkindMany of the players will never develop into amateursfew of them will ever recognize the difference between Ida Rauh and themselvesWith a ban on everything but American plays there is little possibility of finding a role with enough resistance in it for this kind of actressNo dramatist has shown himself of enough intensity and sophisticationThere is no reason why such an actress should be sacrificed to the commercial theatreThe only thing left for her is to create through and over and beyond weak playsas Duse didThe Drama as Art It is uselessto go on talking about the theatre as it isThe theatre as a place of Art is deadSome of us who recognize this and have not reached a state in our development where we can suavely and unselfishly permit the dead to remain with uscry out crudelyLife is for the alivethe theatre is deadbury it or resurrect it AliveBut the drama is one of the great ArtsIt can neither be killed nor buried aliveIn all the other arts the modern artist has cut away tradition and conventionstripped down to the very souland given a chance for a new intense lifeOnly the dramatist lies inerthelplessburied under the theatreliteraturethe systemand the publicThere is nothing else to believe but that in time Drama will extricate it self from all the systems that have fastened upon itThere is some interest in trying to hasten this timefor our own sakeI should like to make clear a simple suggestionwithout getting into a treatise on the DramaFor years men in Europe have been working to establish the drama as an artbut in America the whole idea seems to have been to make it a branch of Social Service WorkAs one of the Arts it is almost unrecognized in the theatreIn its place we have literature and very much not literaturenovels illustrated with voicegesturecostume and scenery of endless varietieswe have propagandamoralsocialpoliticalreligiousThe little theatres in their protest have expended all their energies upon the externalsscenery and lightingThey have weakly 22 The Little Review discarded the technique in voice and acting which they had never acquiredButtalk the real curse of the theatre todaythey hug to themselvesand as so much else is lackingseem to be the exponents of thetalkdiscussion anddomestic relations plays Drama is emotion expressed in motionaction Words are not needed to evoke the emotion or to explain the actionWords belong to literatureOnly a setting is needed which shall stay a setting and not become a paintinginterior decorationor natureAnd actors with enough personality to impersonally transmit the emotionSeveral months ago we printed some experiments by John Rodker called the Theatre MuetI should like to see them tried out in one of our theatresIn scultpure we have had the design simplified and intensified for its own sake rather than for the sake of expressionIn painting we have gone to the extreme of throwing down all representation and presenting the abstractPoetry and music have had their revolutionsWhen the emotions that are eternal have been rescued from the confusion of our brutally taxing physical life and the emptines of our psychologywhich deals too much with the details and too little with the spirit of lifewe will have a new dramaI do not think that it will be the theatre muetany more than I believe that this painting will Remain abstract foreverRepresentation will return to paintingThe artist will be consciously or subconsciously influenced in a world of representationsI do not mean representation as imitation or illustrationbut as an interpretation of the inner relation of things to lifeWe will have our theatre staging emotions in action with dialogue that is not conversation but rather an accompanimentThat Boston Paper Again London OfficeOne of the younger Irish essayists has just been in with yet another prize tale of The Atlantic

listened to their strange discussion of itand I have sat alone and wondered how such a wierd and sterile race of beings ever happened to be produced in the worldFirst of allNew York will go into raptures over Galli CurciI say this now before New York has heard herbecause I am already suffering over the things I will have to listen to about herThe critics will call her a great artist and the public will rave in the same keyAnd the only true thing that can be said of Galli Curci is that she has a remarkable vocal organ which any intelligent being will listen to with the same type of interest he has for a tight rope performanceAny one grown enough to classify his emotions will know this at onceTo say that she has a marvelous voice is not to say that she has an artthat she is capable of artthat she has anything more to do with Art than a toadstool hasThe fact is that she was not born an artistthat she will never become oneyou can tof course and that she probably hasn t enough knowledge of what the word means even to wish to become oneI heard her debut last year in ChicagoShe did her stunts with the facility of a birdand so there was a great clamourI can imagine how Campanini rushed to sign contracts with herhow he suddenly discovered that he had been concealing a jewel from the publichow the legend of her greatness was the easiest thing in the world to createetcetcThis is a country where everyone believes that a stunt superbly done is an artThey don t exactly call baseball playing one of the artsbut anything comparable to theformneeded to pitch a ball properly becomes art when they recognize it in a voiceon a piano or a vilonIn literature they can t yet recognize when a stunt has been properly accomplishedso any one who writes at all is regarded as anartist he may do the worst poetry or novel writing of his generationbut the mere fact of his being engaged in writing is enough to include him in the cultBut Annette Kellerman is not an artistdespite the grace and dexterity of her divingand Theodore Dreiser is not an artistdespite the interesting books he has writtenand Mrs Fiske is not an artist even if she has mastered the technique of the stageand Barrie s plays are not Art even if they do contain a complete and exquisite knowledge of human natureand Isadora Duncan is not an artist even if she does move many people profundlyand Rudolf Ganz is not an artist even if he does play the piano with utter and absolute and delightful virtuosityAnd Paderewski and Kreisler and Bauer and Bernhardt and Mary Garden are artists because they were born with creative imaginationAnd Galli Curci is not an artistby virture of that lackThese home truthsI regret to sayare still unrecognizedGalli Curci is a very unattractive little person without presencepersonalitycharmbrainstastespiritor looksShe is awkward and silly on the stagesimpering and excessively saccharineuntrained in any of the beautiful uses of the bodyShe has one of two gestureslike Melbafor all kinds of emotionand uses them continuouslywith an awful coynesswithout regard to what is going on in the music or in the dramaAll the most stupid affectations of the old opera ideals are in her performancesI believe she is supposed to have said that she likes singing with Caruso and dislikes singing with MuratoreWhether she said it or not it would have to be trueShe and Caruso are on about the same intellectual levelwhat Muratore conceives as the art of opera belongs to an air which they cannot breatheI am not trying to disparage the gift of voice which Galli Curci hasI am merely objecting to the riot of idiocy through the country which calls that voice artAnd I am trying to express my contempt for the New York audiences that will go into ecstacies over this woman next month and refuse to understand the great art which Mary Garden has to give themThe musical sensation of the year is Jascha HeifetzBefore I heard him I was told that he played the violin more beautifully than Kreislerthat he was the most wonderful phenomenon that has ever come to these shoresetc etcWhen I went to his concert I heard thisa triumph of virtuosityas definitely and forever removed from comparison with Kreisler as Godowsky is from Harold BauerHeifetz plays with more ease than any violinist I have ever seenHe is very youngvery graceful and charming and appealingand the chief characteristic of his music is flawlessnessOne enthusiast told me she loved his playing because he did such unexpected thingsyou could never tell what he was going to do nextetcBut he does no unexpected thingsHis playing is perfectionHe hasn t even a touch of thatexaggeration a proposwhich is the gauge of personal qualityand without which a man cannot put the stamp of himself upon his workSuch playing is not the playing of a master but of a perfect pupilHeifetz is like thatthe essence of all the things that can be taught seem to have come together in himHe has not discarded any values handed on to him and replaced them with his ownHe has not outstripped his teachersHe gives no indication of the thing which cannot be taughtHe is the perfect artistand as such he won this tribute from one critic Heifetz does not intrude himself upon the music ExactlyThat is the troubleI had looked for some of the richness of the Slav in HeifetzThey say he has a weary faceI was not close enough to seebut certainly his music has no wearinessIt is not interesting enough for thatMy informants may be quite mistaken about his lookHe may have merely a sad faceCertainly in bis pictures he hasn tthelookIt is really quite too naive of the newspaper critics to have compared him with KreislerOne of the more conservative remarks carefully I cannot agree with those whoon the inspiration of the momentinstantly sweep away all the favorites of the dayKreisler still remains my ideal of violinists Good heavensthis is all but pitiable Kreisler s quality is that of the trained human beinga nervous concentration of imagination and intellect and passion turned upon a finely conscious ideaHeifet s quality is that of the un selfconsciousunaware human beingdedicated to the beautiful playing of music as some one else has conceived it But Kreisler is mature and Heifetz is so youngWait a bit etc etcThis is banalityI am talking of the quality each man had at birthand of absolutely nothing elseThere was more art in Kreisler s playing of his arrangement of Paderewski s minuet than in Heifetz s whole programDavid Hochstein s playing is more nearly like Heifetz s than that of any one else in this countryBut David Hochstein plays with more interest in the quality of his feelingHe hasn t such a range of virtuositybut why does New York care more for virtuosity than for anything elseNoHeifetz is not the great new violinistAnd another thingwhenever a great new violinist does appear his audiences will be startled by one difference at leastwhatever else they are able to perceiveThey will discover a quite different kind of acompianist at the pianoand a quite different kind of sound coming from that instrumentNo great musician of the future could stand the strain of the horrible sounds made by the hack pianists that serve today as the best accompanistsThe things they do to the piano are fearfulI always have a nightmare afterward of their

representative for this journeyThe comedy I took part in was a Spanish onethenat once piquant and elementalBut a Frenchman filled the principle rôleWhen I add that this Frenchman was convinced the greater part of the time that he was taking part in a tragedyand was perpetually on the point of transplanting my adventure bodily into that other categoryand that although his actions drew their vehemence from the virgin source of a racial hatredyet it was not as a Frenchman or a Spaniard that he actedthen you will conceive what extremely complex and unmanageable forces were about to be set

the samebut to keep up a show of will and discrimination I chose the secondnot the firstI advanced along a narrow passage way and found myself suddenly in the heart of the Fonda del MundoOn my left lay the dining roomin which sat two travellersI was standing in the kitchena large courtyard round which the rest of the hotel and a house or two at the back were builtBut it had a glass roof on a

and apt answers coming to one s questions were startlingThe air of dull resentment meant nothing except that I was indifferent to herHad I not been so this habitual expression would not have been

my fatesome connected with my supperthe others with further phases of my sojourn in her houseThey fell in the crowd of leisurely workers without causing a rippleBut they gradually reached their

awakened eyescoldlyjudiciallyfixedlyBut he considered he had crushed me enoughand began talking about Parisas he had done before in FrenchHe spoke English incorrectlybutlike many foreignersthe one thing linguistically he had brought away from the United States intact was an American accent of the most startling and uncompromising perfectionWhatever word or phrase he knewin however mutilated a formhad this stamp of colloquialism and air of being the real thingHe spoke English with a careless impudence at which I was not surprisedbut I had the sensation besides that the vague but powerful consciousness of the authentic nature of his accentmade him still more insolently heedless of the faults of his speechHis was evidently to the full the American or Anglo Saxon Americanstate of minda colossal disdain for everything that does not possess in one way or another an American accentIt It seemed almost that my Englishgrammatically regular though it waslacking the American accent was but a poor vehicle for thought compared with his most blundering sentenceBefore going further I must make quite clear that I have no more predjudice against the American way of accenting English The Little Review than I have against the Irish or EnglishThe Irish brogue is prettier than Englishdespite Irishmen s alternate disparagement and exploiting of it and American possesses an indolent vigour and dryness which is a most cunning arm when it snarls out ironiesThe American accent is the language of Mark Twainand is the tongueat once naive and cynicalof a thousand inimitable humouristsI remember at the three or four schools I successively went tothat at all a curious and significant belief prevailedI always understoodup to my seventeenth yearthat an Englishman could reckonwithout undue vanity and as a matter of scientific facton overcoming in battle seven FrenchmanThat he need feel by no maens uneasy if threatened by twentyor fiftyfor that matterbut that the sort of official and universally acknowledged standard was one Englishman corresponding to seven FrenchmenI remember also a conversation I had in Paris with a young EnglishmanWe were both nineteenand very tall and lankyHe was a slowawkward and rather timid youthWe were discussing nocturnal aggressionsand he said quietly that these Paris roughswouldn t ever tackle an EnglishmanThey knew better This same young man also was very conscious of the difference of his walk from that of FrenchmenHe referred to it quite seriously asthe walk of the conquering race I could never see any difference myselfexcept that his legs were disproportionately longand he seemed a rather incompetent pedestrianNow I have met nowhere else in Europe with this excellent illusion of national superiorityA Frenchman knows he will have to use his utmost cunning to circumvent and eventually exterminate or main one single GermanThe German reflects he will have to eat a great deal of Leberwurst and Sauerkraut to be able to crush with his superior weight the nimble Frenchman The God s Own Countryattitude of some Americans is more Anglo Saxon than their bloodI can now proceed without fear of misinterpretation on the part of my American friendsI had before this met Americans from OdessaBuda Pesth and PekinAlmost always the air of the United Stateswhich they breathed for a month or twohad proved too much for themThey were never any good for anything afterwardsbecame wastrels in their own countriespoets and dreamersThis man at once resembled and was different from themThe case of this diffence became apparent when he informed me that he was a United States citizenI believed him unreservedly and on 40 The Little Review the spotSome air of security in him that only such a ratification can giveconvinced meHe did not tell me at onceBetween his commencing to speak in English and his announcing his citizenship came an indetermined neutral phase in our relationsIn the same order as in our conversation in Frenchwe progressed from the weather topica delicate subject with usto ParisOur acquaintance had matured wonderfully quicklyI already felt instinctively that certain subjects of conversation were to be avoidedthat certain shades of facial expression would cause suspicionhatred or perplexity in his soulHefor his partevidently with the intention of eschewing a subject fraught with dangersdid not once speak of EnglandIt was as though England were a subject that no one could expect him to keep his temper aboutand that if a man did indeed come from England he would naturally resent being reminded of itas though he might feel that the other was seeking to take an undue advantage of himHe was in fact indulgently pretending for the moment that I was an American Guess yougointo Spain he said

plunged into this obscure swirl of words with a story to tellThe story was drowned in thembut I gathered it told of howtravelling in a motor carhe could find no petrol anywhere in a town of some importanceHe was so interested in the telling of the storythat I became rather off my guardand once or twice showed that I did not quite follow himdid not quite understand his EnglishHe finished his story rather abruptly and there was a silenceIt was after this silence that he divulged the fact of his American citizenshipAnd now things took on a very gloomy aspectWith the revelation of this mighty fact he seemed to consider it incumbent upon him to adopt an air of increased arroganceThe Little Review He was now the representative of the United StatesThere was no more question of my being an AmericanAll compromiseall courteous resolve to ignore painful factswas pastThings must stand out in their true coloursand men tooAs a result of this heightened attitudehe appeared to doubt the sincerity or exactitude of everything I saidHis beard bristled round his drawling mouthhis thumbs sought his arm pitshis feet stood up erect and aggressive on his heelsat the delicate angle of a drawing by PascinAn insidious attempt on my part to induct the conversation back into Frenchunhappily detectedcaused in him a sombre indignationI was curious to see the change that would occur in my companion on feeling on his lips once more and in his throatthe humbler tongueThe treachery of my intention gradually dawned upon himHe seemed taken abackwas silent and very quiet for a few minutesas though stunnedThe subtletiesthe Ironiesto which he was exposed Ouic est vrai I went onwith frowningserious airover palpably absorbed in the subject we were discussingand overlooking the fact that I

terribleHe saw through it allAnd now I was flatteringwas flattering Americansand above allpraising their way of dressingThe guile of this was too much for himHe burst out vehementlyalmost wildlyin the language of his adopted landYessirr and that s more n see durn English do He was a typical product of the French midiButno doubtin his perfect Americanism and at this ticklish momenthis impeccable accent threatened by an unscrupulous foewho was attempting to stifle it temporarily a definite analogy arose in his mindThe red skin and his wilesthe hereditary and cunning foe of the American citizenno doubt came vividly to his mind and he recognizedin its evoking this imagethe dastardliness of my attackYeswiles of that familiar sort were being used against himSioux likeBlackfeet like maneouvresHe must meet them as the American citizen had always met themHe had at length overcome the Sioux and MohicanHe turned on me a look as though I had been unmaskedand his accent became more accentuatedrasping and arrogantI might say that his accent became venemousAll the elemental movements of his soul were always acutely 42 The Little Review manifest in his American accentthe principal vesselas it wereof his vitalityAfter another significant pause he brusquely chose a subject of conversation that he was convinced we could not agree upon He took a long draught of the powerful fluid served to each dinerI disagreed with him at first out of politenessBut as he seemed resolved to work himself up slowly into a national passionI changed round and agreed with himHe glared at me for a momentHe felt at bay before this dreadful subtlety of mineThen he warily changed his position in the argumenttaking up the point of view he had begun by attackingWe changed about alternately for a littleAt one timein taking my new standand asserting somethingeither I had changed too quicklyor he had not quite quickly enoughAt all eventswhen he began speakinghe found himself agreeing with meThis was a terrible momentIt was very close quartersI felt as one does at a showstanding on the same chair with some uncertain tempered personI was compelled rapidly to disagree with him and just saved the situationA moment moreand we should have fallen on each otheror ratherhe on meHe buried his face once more in the sinister poiton in front of himand consumed the last vestiges of the fearful aliment at his elbowI felt the situation had become perfetcly blood curdlingWe had not been once interrupted during these happeningsA dark mana SpaniardI thoughthad passed into the kitchen along the passageThe sound of bustle came to us uninterruptedly from withinHe now with a snarling drawl engaged in a new discussion on another and still more delicate subjectI renewed my tacticshe hisSubject after subject was chosenand his voltes facehis change of attitude in the argumentbecame less and less leisurely and more and more precipitateuntil at length whatever I said he said the opposite brutally and at onceBut still my cunning was too great for himAt lastpushing his chair back with a frightful grating soundand thrusting both his hands in his pocketsat this supreme moment the sort of large blank look came back to his face againhe said slowlyWaalzat may be so you say so waalBut what say you to EnglandhaEnglandEnglandEngland At last it had comeHe repeatedEnglandas though that word

possibility of having this question put to himHe might at any moment be silenced with it Englandl haEnglandEngland he repeated as though hypnotised by this wordas though pressing me harder and harder and finallychawing me upwith the mere utterance of it Whymon vieux I said suddenlygetting up how about the South of Francefor that matter the South of Francethe South of France If I had saidAmericahe would have responded at onceno doubtButthe south of France A look of unutterable vagueness came into his faceThe south of FranceThis was at once without meaningdispiritinghumiliatingparalysinga cold douchea stab in the backan unfair blowI seemed to have drawn a chilly pall suddenly over the whole of his mindI had fully expected to be forced to fight my way out of the salle à mangerand was wondering whether his pugilistic methods would be those of Alabama or Toulouse whether he would skip round me with his fists working like piston rodsor whether he would plunge his head in the pit of my stomachkick me on the chin and follow up with thecoup de la fourchette which consists in doubling up one s fistbut allowing the index and little finger to protrudeso that they may enter the eyes on either side of the bridge of the noseBut he was quite incapable of dealing adequately with this new situationAs I made for the doorhe sat first quite stillThenslowlyslightly writhing on his chairhis face half turned after meThe fact of my leaving the room seemed to find him still more unpreparedto dumfound him even morethan my answer to his final apostropheIt never had occured to him apparentlythat I should perhaps get up and leave the roomSounds came from himwords too hybrid syllables lost on the borderland between French and Englishwhich appeared to signify protestpure astonishmentalarmed questionI got safely out of the kitchenIn the act of lighting my candle I heard a nasal roar behind meI mounted the stairs three steps at a timewith the hotel boy at my heelsandushered into my roomhastily locked and bolted the door44 The Little Review I knew perfectly well that I had not treated the little Frenchman at all wellTo drag in France in that waythe south of Francewas brutalising to this tender flower of the Prairies of the WestBut to leave the room at that point of our conversationat that point in our relationshipwas still more unpardonableMy room was at the backThe window looked on to the kitchenit was just over the stairs leading the bedroomsFrom that naturally unfresh and depressing port hole above the cauldronsI could observe my opponent in the murky half courthalf kitchenbeneathHe looked very differentinspected from this height anddistanceI had not till then seen him on his feetHis Yankee clothesevidently cut beneath his direction by a Gascon tailormade him look as broad as he was longHis violently animated leanness imparted a precarious and toppling appearance to his architectureHe was performing a war dance in this soft national armour just at present beneath the sodden eyes of the ProprietressIt had shuffling cake walk elementsand cacaphonic gesticulations of the GaulIt did not seem the same man I had been talking to beforeHe evidentlyin this enchanted hotelpossessed a variety of incarnationsOr it was as though somebody else had leapt into his clotheswhich hardly fitted the newcomerand was carrying on his quarrelThe original and more imposing man had disappearedand this little fellow had taken up his disorganised and overwrought life at that precise moment and placeat exactly the same pitch of passiononly with fresher nervesand identically the same racial sentiments as the man he had succeededHe was talking to the proprietress in Spanish much more correct than his EnglishShe listened with her leaden eyes crawling swiftly over his personwith an air of angrily and lazily making an inventoryIn his fiery attack on the adamantine depths of langour behind which her spirit livedhe would occasionally turn and appeal to one of the nearest of the servantsas though seeking corroboration of somethingWhat was he accusing me ofI muttered rapid prayers to the effect that that mock tropical reserve might prove unassailableFor I might otherwise be cast bodily out of the Fonda del Mundoand in my present worn out stateand with a dyspeptic storm brewing in this first contact with primitive foodhave to seek another and distant roofI knew that I was the object of his discourseWhat effectively could be said about me on so short an acquaintanceHe wouldthoughcertainly affirm thatwas an extremely suspicious characterunscrupulousresourcefulslip The Little Review perydiabolically coolsuch a person as no respectable hotel would consent to harbouror if it didwould do so at its perilThen

abominationOhout with it before I die at your feet from over heating and plegm This way of putting itthe personal waymight be more effectiveI went to bed with a feeling of extreme insecurityI thought thatif nothing else happenedhe might set fire to the hotelI slept quite soundly in spite of the dangers obviously infesting this establishment for meIn the morning breakfast passed off without incidentI concluded that the complete American was part of the night time aspect of the Fonda del Mundo and had no part in its more normal day lifeThe square was full of peasantsthe men wearing dark blouse and beret connected with PelotaSeveral groups were sitting near me in the salle à mangerA complicated arrangement of chairs and tableslike man traps in their intricate convolutionslay outside the hotelextending a little distance into the squareFrom time to time one or more peasants would appear to become stuckget somehow caughtin these iron contrivancesThey would thenwith becoming fatalismseeing they could not escapesit down and call for a drinkSuch was the impression at least that their gauche and embarrassed movements in choosing a seat gave oneA train would shortly leave for the frontierI bade farewell to the Patronaand asked her if she could recommend me a hotel in Burgos or in PontaisandraWhen I mentioned Pontaisandrashe said at onceYou are going to Pontaisandra She turned with a sluggish ghost of a smile to a loitering servant and then said Yesyou can go to the Burgaleza at PontaisandraThat is a good hotel I had told her the night before that my destination was Pontaisandraand she had looked at me steadfastly and resentfullyas though I had said that my destination was Heavenand that I intended to occupy the seat reserved for herI regarded the episode of the supper roomthe night beforeas an emanation of that placeThe Fonda del Mundo was a very 46 The Little Review mysterious hoteldespite its more usual aspect in the day timeI imagined it inhabited by solitary and hallucinated beingslike my friend of the night beforeor such as I myself might have becomeThe large kitchen staff was occupied far into the night in preparing a strange and excessive table d hoteFor the explanation of this afforded me in the morning by the sight of the crowding peasants did not efface my impression of midnightThe dreams caused by its lunchesthe visions conjured up by its suppershaunted the placeThis is the spirit in which I remember my over night affairWhen I eventually started for the frontierhoping by the inhalation of a Picadura to dispose my tongue to the coining of fair SpanishI did not realise that the American adventure was the propenitor of other adventuresnor that the dreams of the Fonda del Mundo were to go with me into the heart of Spain To be continued JUDICIAL OPINIONOur Suppressed October IssueMargaret Anderson AS EXPLAINED in the last issueour October number has been held up by the Postoffice because of a story by Wyndham LewiscalledCantleman s Spring Mate which the Postoffice solicitor judged to be obsceneWe took the case to courtwhere it was brilliantly andbecause of the irony of the situationhomourouly defendedBut much to our surprise a decision was rendered against usI quote from the opinion of Judge Augustus NHandThis is a motion to restrain the Postmaster of New York from denying the use of the mails to the October issue of The Little ReviewThis publication was supressed upon the advice of the solicitor of the Post Office Department on the ground that it was nonmailable under Section 211 of the United States Criminal Code which providesThe Little ReviewEvery obsencelewdor lasciviousand every filthy bookpamphlet writing or other publication of an indecent character is hereby declared to be non mailable matter and shall not be conveyed in the mails or delivered from any post office or by any letter carrier The publication which is particularly objected to by the Postal Authorities is a short story about a soldier in the British Army who reflects upon the topsy turvy condition of the world and feels that gigantic forceswhich he is pleased to call those of natureare arrayed against the individual forces that in most cases will overpower himHe regards his own destruction in the present European conflict as more than likelyand under all these conditions feels at war with the worldWith satirical satisfaction he seduces a young girl and disregards her appeals when she becomes a motherIn his revolt at the confusion and injustice of the war he feels justification at having wreaked his will and obtained his satisfactionthusas he saysoutwitting natureIt may be urged that this story points various moralsOne may say it shows the wickedness of selfishness and indulgenceAnother may argue that it shows the degradation of camp life and the demoralizing character of warIt naturally causes a reflecting mind to balance the heroism and self abnegation that always shines forth in warwith the demoralization that also inevitably accompanies itThe very old question suggests itself as to the ultimate values of warBut no outline of the story conveys its full importThe young girl and the relations of the man with her are described with a degree of detail that does not appear necessary to teach the desired lessonwhatever it may beor to tell a story which would possess artistic merit or arouse any worthy emotionOn the contrary it is at least reasonably arguableI thinkthat the details of the sex relations are set forth to attract readers to the story because of their salacious characterI am of course aware that mere description of irregular things in relation to sex may not fall with the StatuteThe whole subject involved in this case is beset with difficulties and the duty of the Postmaster General in administering the Act is a most delicate oneFew wouldI supposedoubt that some prevention of the mailing of lewd publications is desirableand yet no field of administration requires better judgment or more circumspection to avoid interference with a justifiable freedom of expression and literary developmentI have little doubt that numerous really great writings would come under the ban if tests that are frequently 48 The Little Review current were appliedand these approved publications doutbless at times escape only because they come within the termclassics which means for the purpose of the application of the statutethat they are ordinarily immune from interferencebecause they have the sanction of age and fame and usually appeal to a comparatively limited number of readersIt is very easy by a narrow and prudish construction of the Statute to suppress literature of permanent merit These considerations of administrationhoweverare not for the courts except in cases where the judgment of the Postmaster General has been wholly arbitrary and without fundationWhile it has been urged with unusual ingenuity and ability that nothing under consideration can have the tendency denounced by the StatuteI do not think the complainant has made out a case for interfering with the discretion lodged in the Postmaster General whosedecision must be regarded as conclusive by the courts unless it appears that it was clearly wrong Masses vPattenNYLow JournalNov51917Smith vHitchcock226 US58The motion is deniedAugustus NHandIt would be ridiculous for me to conceal my complete disagreement with Judge Hand and the PostofficeI disagree even with the best arguments that could be presented in a contemporary court room about the merits of such a storyThe Little Review was founded in direct opposition to the prevalent art values in AmericaIt would have no function or reason for being if it did not continually conflict with those valuesIn the first placeCantleman s Spring Mateis a piece of literatureover and beyond being merely a good storybecause its author knows the difference between writing a story and making a piece of proseThe latter means that he is master of the mysterious laws by which words are made into patterns or rhythmsso that you read them for the spirit contained in the rhythmwhich is the only way of getting at the contextwhich in fact is a thing of distinct and separate entityexisting above and beyond the contextMany fairly good writers and critics do not understand these lawsIt is not surprising that the Postoffice department does not understand themFor instanceto say thatCantleman walked in the strenuous fieldssteam rising from them as from an exertionis prosebut to say thatCantleman took a walk in the fields from which steam was risingas if the ground had been exerting itself in a strenuous strugglewould have no relation to proseTo sayand sit forever in a formal and gentle elationis proseorto see this face constantly was like hearing perpetually a cheap and foolish music orsince he was forced backby his logic and bodyamong the madness of natural things orand gaze bravelylike a minute insectup at the immense and melancholy nightwith all its mad nightingales and misty useless watchmen these things come within the laws which separate what is good from what is bad Goodandbadin literature have no other connotation than thisAs for the content of the storythat is not separable from its formonce you grant it to a piece of ArtBut if we must strip the meaning from the formI could argue for several days with any one who had enough interest to listen to meThe only intelligible things that can be said today in a court roomarguments carefully calculated to meet the intellectual capacity of those who are trying to prove immoral something they cannot even understandis that the story is a brutal one containing a lesson and a terrible warningand therefore salutary in its effectIf one still thought about life in terms of destruction or salvationit would be perfectly legitimate to say that the influence of this story would begoodrather thanbad But one doesn t think in such terms any moreScientists have never thought in such termsneither have philosophersThere is no law by which the Postoffice department of any country can force scientists or philosophers or artists to think in such termsSome childrenmany parentsreligious peopleclub ladiesrouésetcthink this wayBut we cannot do itI hope our foreign subscribers will forgive me the boredom and obviousness of these argumentsIt is necessary in AmericaOur Postoffice is the supreme authority on all matters of intellectual interestI can see nothing brutal inCantleman s Spring Mate I can see no warning or lesson in itIt is a story of two people who answer the call of sexThe woman does it quite instinctivelybeing a creature of instinctsthe man does it with certain intellectual reservationsbeing a civilized productBoth are in the situation merely because they want to be thereNo force except that of nature compelled them to be thereNature cannot be called either moral or immoralThe popular mind argues that the girl s life is destroyedBut nothing candestroylifeAny life that is capable of being destroyedin the popular sense of the termshould he destroyedIt might then take on that tragic significance which would make it material for ArtThat these arguments may still be regarded as childish or immoral by the majority of the world is the supreme human jokeThat I could be called aniconoclastfor making them is a measure of contemporary fatuityThe Little Review IN SHADOW Hart Crane Out in the late amber afternoonConfused among chrysanthemumsHer parasola pale balloonLike a waiting moonin shadow

noteIn our September number we published Wyndham Lewis sInferior Religions It is not extravagant to speak of this essay as one of the most profound of our timeBut if there were ten people in the United States who realized this fact they have not mentioned it to meSome several hundred have written to say that they can find so sense or interest in it that it is quite unintelligibleI thereupon asked MrSolonone of the possible ten who appreciated the essayto write a digest of it for the puzzled readerHe replied That is hardly possiblesince MrLewis has himself condensed his thought to the

review being stored in the British Museumthe data will continue availableThere will be no faking the recordsThe Little Review is now the first effort to do comparitively what The EnglishReview did during its first year and a halfthat isto maintain the rights and position of literatureI do not say in contempt of the publicbut in spite of the curious system of trade and traders which has grown up with the purpose or result of interposing itself between literature and the publicWe act in spite of the public s utter impotence to get good literature for itselfand in despite of the efforts of thetradeto satiate the public with a substituteto still their appetite for literature by providing themat a cheaper rate and more convenientlywith a swallowable substituteWhereanent a very successful journalist has said to meWe iewe journalistsare like mediumsPeople go to a spiritist séance and hear what they want to hearIt is the same with a leading articlewe write so that the reader will find what he wants to findThat is the root of the matterthere is good journalism and bad journalismand journalism thatlookslikeliteratureand literature etc But the root of the difference is that in journalism the reader finds what he is looking forwhat hethe reader wantswhereas The Little Review in literature he must find at least a part of what the author intendedThat is whythe first impression of a work of geniusisnearly always disagreeable at least to theaverage man The public loathe the violence done to their self conceit whenever an author conveys to them an idea that is hisnot their ownThis difference is lasting and profoundEven in the vaguest of poetryor the vaguest musicwhere in a sense the receiver mayor mustmake half the beauty he is to receivethere is always something of the author or composer which must be transmittedIn journalismor thebad artwhich is but journalism thinly disguisedthere is no such strain on the publicTHE READER CRITIC Longfellow sBirthplaceis in the act
