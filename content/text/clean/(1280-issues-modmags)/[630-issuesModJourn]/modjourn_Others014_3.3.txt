"Art is surely sexless. There isn't man's poetry and woman's poetry. A poem must satisfy the same canons whether it happens to have been written by a man or by a woman." These contentions are true, but everyone grants the convenience and justice of such categories as French Poetry, Spanish Poetry—Greek, German, Hindu Poetry— and is there not as great difference, in physical make-up, in psychology, custom and history, between the people called Men and the people called Women?   Yes, alas. At present most of what we know, or think we know, of women has been found out by men. We have yet to hear what woman will tell of herself, and where can she tell more intimately, more immediately, than in poetry? If only she is able to be sincere enough; and rather brave! H. H. In other words, it is time woman played troubadour! A. K. Copyright, 1916 by Alfred Kreymborg ##harriet monroe 55 AT NOON (The World's Columbian Exposition—1893) Oh, the Midway! the long bright flaunting Midway! the nations thronging in the sun ! Like a dancer it spins and reels! like a dark-eyed dancer it bows to the flute, it sparkles in scarlet and golden chains. The straw-fringed African stares wide and leaps for joy. The Hindoo smiles out of his shadowed past; winding his yellow turban, flashing his shell-white teeth. The soft little daughter of Java flaps her green ribbon and flutters her flower-sweet fingers. The camel stalks out from his sleep-bound sands, and dips his bedizened head. The steed of the Bedouin streaks over the black earth like the copper flash of a flaming fuse. Oh, the crowd! ever moving and moving! back and forth, east and west, with chatter and laughter and giddy joy! looping over the great wheel that slowly circles, its glassy cars saluting the high-throned sun as they silently rise and fall! ##56 HARRIET MONROE Hark to the drums and the bells! Hark to the tuneless monotonous music, the babel of beckoning voices, ever calling and calling from shores and isles of the big round world ! Where shall I go? I know not. What shall I do? Nay, ye bearers of strange banners, let me sit on a bench and dream in the sun ! ##h.   d. 57 PEAR TREE Silver dust lifted from the earth, higher than my arms reach, you have mounted, O silver, higher than my arms reach you front us with great mass ; no flower ever opened so staunch a white leaf, no flower ever parted silver from such rare silver; O white pear, your flower-tufts thick on the branch bring summer and ripe fruits in their purple hearts. ##58 h.  d. EVENING The light passes from ridge to ridge, from flower to flower— the hypaticas, wide-spread under the light grow faint— the petals reach inward, the blue tips bend toward the bluer heart and the flowers are lost. The cornel-buds are still white, but shadows dart from the cornel-roots— black creeps from root to root, each leaf cuts another leaf on the grass, shadow seeks shadow, then both leaf and leaf-shadow are lost.##    CONSTANCE LINDSAY SKINNER 59 SONG OF BASKET-WEAVING Kulsagh, Kulsagh, my Mother, I sit at thy knee Weaving my basket of grasses, Weaving for my harvest of berries when the Ripe Days come. Thy fingers gently touch my hair with fragrance, Thy mouth drips a song, for the wind has kissed it— (Love sings in thy mouth!) The soil listens and answers ; I feel a stirring beneath me and hear buds opening, The river chants thy song, and the clouds dance to it, To-night  the  stars   will   float   upon   thy   singing breath, Gleaming like slanting flocks above the sea...... All the Earth sings: and its voices are one song ! I alone am silent:   I alone, a maid waiting him, the Fate, The Stirring One, The Planter of the Harvest, The Basket-Filler. Kulsagh, Kulsagh, Mother ! See how beautiful, how liberal, is my basket, How tightly woven for the waters of love, How soft for the treading of children's feet, ##60 CONSTANCY  LINDSAY  SKINNER How strong to bear them up ! Kulsagh, Kulsagh, Mother, remember me Ere the Sunset and the Dropping Leaf! Kulsagh; Cedar-Tree. Considered the source of Life as it supplies all the necessities of life, even food in fish famine.   British Columbia Coast Indians. ##MIRIAM ALLEN DEFORD 61 HINDU LOVE CHANTS There is a silver web called silence; It hangs between us, soft and blinding; Break it, my love, and let me hear your voice; But break it only with a sound as beautiful. I feel your breath upon my heart; I know, through seven lakes and mountains, that you smile: I need no words to say you love me; If your love went from me, the truth would fall upon my heart and crush it. ##62 MARGUERITE WILKINSON AN INCANTATION O great sun of Heaven, harm not my love, Sear him not with your heat, nor blind him with your beauty, Shine for his pleasure ! 0 grey rains of Heaven, harm not my love, Drown not in your torrent the song of his heart, Lave and caress him ! O swift winds of Heaven, harm not my love, Bruise not, nor buffet him in your rough humor, Sing you his prowess ! O mighty triad, strong ones of Heaven, Sun, rain, and wind, be gentle I charge you, Or send on me the storm of your anger, But spare him, my love, most proud and most dear, O sun, rain, and wind, strong ones of Heaven! ##ELLEN HARRINGTON 63 MATRIX I stretch my hands out toward you; And by all the ways that are surer than seeing I see that they are filled with gifts of your giving; A coronet tipped with leaves and star dust, And little slippers of gold with wings upon them. And a glowing girdle of crimson, And coin of royal mintage. I hold my hands up to you ; And by all the ways that one knows without knowing I know that you know I have filled them with gifts for your taking; A cloak of eider as softly warm as satisfied desire, And a clasp of living emerald to hold it, And tingling wine in a jeweled goblet, And a rare red rose to grace it. But the cruel resolvent of actuality Is fallen upon them: And I stand and gaze at my upturned hands; And they are only full Of wistfulness. ##64 MUNA LEE I You love As the wind loves a bed of blue larkspur, But I As a yellow poppy Loves starlight in the pool. II Since I smile when you offer me Pearls and roses You never guess my hunger for Circlets of moonstone, Jade anklets, Chrysoprase, jacinth, and amaranth, Flag-flowers, Saffron, And the bitter brown blossoms Of the calycanthus. III My life is a smooth green vase To hold the purple thistles Of your passion. ##MUNA LEE 65 IV You who hear only the words That say I love you Know of my love What a tree dashed with white foam Knows of salt bitterness of the sea. V No, I do not love you. A hundred times I have choked my love of you, And left it dead a hundred times. ##66 FLORENCE KI PER  FRANK VISITATION You came to me again last night, And today you are as a mood upon me. You!   You!   You!   I can think of nothing else but your meaning, And the darkness of your eyes, and the way your hair grows away from your forehead, And what you have said to me and what you would say and the touch of your hands upon my body, And all that was unresolved and did not quite come to an issue between us. Yet they buried you in the ground ten years ago— and now I am most happily married; And it isn't quite fair of you, is it, to come to me, so, in the darkness !## JEANNE D'ORGE                                          67 THE INTRUDER Not flesh I fear, But spirit. Spirit that comes in the midst of joys, Comes even into the marriage bed And lies down between husband and wife Saying "Lo, I am here—look upon Me." And one hears, One sees, One obeys...... It is not flesh I fear. ##68 JEANNE D'ORGE THE CHAMELEON What happened yesterday? What terror drove me here to hide away Grey Under a stone? My lizard soul needs warmth, Light, color. It brightens into beauty in the sun. I will go out again to the dappled earth, To the gold, to the blue, to the green— Never mind tomorrow's Or yesterday's dim sorrow That drove me here to hide alone Grey under a stone. ##MARJORIE ALLEN SEIFFERT 69 SPECTRUM There was a glory of heaven, Forgotten, And a glory of earth, Forgotten, And a glory of myself, Forgotten, too. You who have not found Heaven, or earth, or self Glorious, Am I at last Like you? ##70 ELIZABETH  GUNN RETRIBUTION I want to hurt you ! For once—not long ago—someone hurt me. I know the way to madden you And gladden you And leave you with smirched pride, Trembling between love and hate, Yes, I know that hell! For not so long ago I felt my heart twist With hard pain, And tried to smile, But something moved again, so that I only wept, And all my sweetness slipped into the dark...... That is why I want to hurt you. ##KATE BUSS 71 TEA ROOM Old women Nod bien coiffé heads Over Orange Pekoe And the bitter green Of English breakfast brew ; Young girls come in To gaze at men And bewilder them with their bodies. It is not tea they drink; Tea is a sophisticated taste— Only old women know this. CURVES I do not hurry after my friend and my friend returns to say Is it me you love or yourself, and I answer neither yea nor nay. ##72 KATE BUSS ARABELLE I dislike men. Dislike them for the strain They put on women. If I didn't have to earn a living I'd snap my fingers at this fading hair of mine And let the colour in my cheeks Begin to go. I'd sit down to it And rock my age in comfort by the fire. Forty-four and poor— If you're single— Is the devil of a combination for a woman. Every time a married one Comes in to buy a box of rouge I'd like to tell her she's a fool to do it When she's not obliged to look young. Once I said as much And the woman answered I guess you're not married Or you'd know the reason...... I dislike men For the strain they put on women. ##HELEN HOYT 73 TO A PREGNANT WOMAN This is possession! To own so surely, so completely; So absolutely to command, To serve, to keep. Knowing you hold the beating life of the beloved In the depths of your life ; Breathing through your breath, Enfolded in your strength for its sustainment "I am my beloved's And he is mine" You cried once to your lover: But who is able to own another. Or be owned by another? Only now may love truly possess : The beloved is yours. ##74 ANONYMOUS THE PASSING Red drop by drop with breath devouring pain I give to death what but till now in me Was love alive.   Oh those cruel unknown powers That take from my body what was wrought In threads of gold, out of the stars. It is a soul that flows from me Through the dark channel of my pain Into the depthless ocean wastes of death. He was to me as one already living; When love sought love and struck to life a flame, I knew his presence, and full of joy I sang Loud to the skies a new magnificat, And day by day held sweet communion. More than when fruit trees stretch their brawny arms Into the summer air and pray for sun And rain to give rich abundant yield My body yearned over this seed, this bud To nourish it into the perfect flower and growth.... Slowly now the tide of drops that would have been Baby eyes and lips and hands and feet...... The half-formed petals drop upon the night And I, the stem, stand empty of all bloom, Life's beauty and its perfume fled from me. My soul which was a garden is a tomb.## JEAN DAVIS 75 OUR CAMILLA Today we had a funeral for Camilla, All along Spring Street past the candy-store. The street looks different when you're in a carriage, You notice things you never saw before, And feel so strange— And all the other children stop and stare. I used to stare, too, once, and want to ride— I wore my new black coat, and mama cried. The day it snowed Camilla had no carfare, We never had a horse until today: We had two for Camilla, trimmed with jet; We left her out in Brooklyn— She ain't home yet. ##76 LAURA BENET THE PENNY A penny, a penny smooth, a penny round! Why do you bend your eyes upon the ground? Magical things that leap and frisk Are conjured up by that copper disk. Toss it into the green lagoon— It rises in the round yellow moon. Fling it into the cleft yew-tree— The woodcutter finds a treasury. Spin it on an oak table top— Gray waving lines of rabbits hop. Roll it under the coach of the bride— Luck goes over the countryside. Ring it that children's hearts may sing Round barrel organs capering. Cheaper than silver, dearer than gold, Thistledown light, yet hard to hold ! A penny, a penny round, a penny gay— Why do you turn your dancing eyes away? ##MARION KEEP PATTON 77 WHITE TREMOR Tiny ghost-tree, flickering in the rain, Pale, pale, Why do you tremble there at the turning, High at the rim of the road Against the parapet of dark trees, And they against nothing but rain,— You, so wan, so shaken? Why are you quivering in my heart like a secret, Like a sick tale that cannot be told, Or a spring anemone too frail to be plucked? It is many years since I saw you— I have forgotten how many— The spring was still so close to winter that you shivered and blanched; I was on my way upward from the valleys— I know not whither, Nor who were my companions ; Only there was the driver, thin, young, swaying beside me, Within a lurching shelter from the weather, Pulled up the steep road, And there at the acrid-sweet turning Suddenly you, And a tremor of white joy shook through me. "What is that?"   I cried. ##78 MARION   KEEP  PATTON "Oh that?   That's a beech sapling with the old leaves still clinging in the spring, Just a beech sapling." That spring, what was shooting through my veins in the dawn and back to my heart in the twilight? I was young! Did not that pilgrimage bring me some new portion of life Which is a part of me now, Fused with me in a moment That melted my soul And set my young blood seething? Gone, gone, utterly vanished—I remember nothing— Only I see you, ghost-tree, in your timid beauty, Little beech sapling. ##MARY  ALDIS 79 BEANS Today I saw a lunatic sorting beans. Long, loose, unkempt, with toes turned in, He sat upon a bench by a brick wall And worked and worked. His shifting eyes Concealed his mighty plan ; His lips murmured ahead ; His white and narrow hand Seized prettily each separate bean From off the pile And hurried it to place. I watched him for an hour, Maybe two. Finally, the last bean on, He set his pattern in the sun ; And with a little touch now here, now there, He stole away and hid. Soon other lunatics came wandering by, Jostling to look. One stared, one laughed, One peered again; One said that he could do A darned sight better out of smoke ; ##80 MARY   ALDIS One thrust a kick And all the beans went scattering about. But one came back And looked down gravely On the worker picking up his beans. "Brother!" he said, And fell to helping him. ######
