PRICE, 25 CENTS A NUMBER; $3.00 A YEAR SCKIBNEIPS MAGAZINE A DVERTJSER THE HOWARD WATCH here will be no more Howards as low as $37.50, except the limited number now in the dealers  hands. The increasing demand for our better watches compels us to stop making this grade and concentrate on the finer movements. On February 1 st, of this year, we had to discontinue the $35.00 Howard as we announced at that time, and on June 15 th we made the last of the $37.50 quality. These are both excellent watches. The $35.00 watch sold out so fast that many people were disappointed. They didn t see the jeweler soon enough. It will be the same with the $37.50 if those who desire them do not act quickly. See your jeweler at once, there will never be another Howard made at $37.50 This watch is 17-jewel single roller escapement, tested in its case at the factory adjusted to three positions, temperature and isochronism in hunting case only. We wish it clearly understood that this is not a raise in price of Howard watches. It means that we have to increase our pro- duction of the finer watches and we can't do that by hurrying the work. In 65 years of watch making history a Howard has never been slighted. Every year there are more men who want to own a Howard  never quite enough to go around. The price of each watch is fixed at the factory and a printed ticket attached. Not every jeweler can sell you a Howard watch. No jeweler can charge you more than the printed ticket calls for and the Howard is always worth that price.  11- Talk to the Howard jeweler in your town he is a good man to know. E.

The background is, therefore, very different from the Canadian background in   Korthern Lights.  but the stories show the same dramatic impulse, the same keen sense oi the tragedy and comedy of human lives characteristic Parker stories. All have the indescribable atmosphere of a tropic land, and the broad spirit of humanity that is born whenever the savage and the civilized are found living their lives side by side.

In this new novel Zanc Grey reveals a strange, wild life, half patriarchal, half savage, intense as the sunglow of the desert and as dramatic as the shadowy depths of the great cartons. The hero, saved from the desert and from  rustlers  by kindly Mormons, is taken to their oasis among the mountains and shares their patriarchal life. The life of the heroine, the beautiful Mescal, is disclosed in an atmosphere fragrant of mountain forests. But life is a fight. To avoid a hated marriage, the heroine ha  fled to the desert. The hero s quest for Mescal is a tireless journey through mirages and sandstorms and a descent into the depths of canons. In a series of swift, tense scenes the drama of the wilderness is fought to a thrilling close. With Frontispiece.

But the delicatc art of   The Masquerader" in interest and sympathy triumphs equally in  Max.  Here again the author has made won- derful use of a powerful situation. It is the story' of a beautiful young woman who first wins a man s affections while masquer- ading as a boy, and then wins his love while masquerading as the boy s sister. She is a Rus- sian princess, who has run away to escape a love- less marriage. The story of   Max   begins on the night express from Berlin to Paris. Among the passengers is a Russian boy, quccrly dressed and evidently poor. In the same compartment with him are three men, whose curiosity he seems anxious to avoid. Two of them set him down at once as an anarchist, but the third Edward Blake, a cosmopolitan Irishman is strangely drawn to him. When they arrive in Paris, Blake stops the boy and questions him. but is coolly repelled. Later chance throws them together again in the Place de la Concorde.

If lltere is a possibility that you cun do something you hare to do, with less effort, or to better effect, than you are doing it tune, find out about it. If by some new idea you might possibly sell more goods than you sell tioir, or could sell them at less cost, or in a better market find out about it. If anyone has something that he says will help you to boost your salary or beat a competitor, to cut costs or make more customers if he offers you anything to make yourself better off than you are now, the shrewd maws plan is to find out. On this page- is told how successful men found out the better methods, plans, opportunities or devices that en- abled them to increase dividends or earn bigger salaries or hare better clothes or furnish better homes often to go in business for themselves. DO you know lhat many big busi- ness firms do not stop to address the en- velopes in which they send oul mail  They learned how to save that operation and the sal- aries of many stenog- raphers from the ad- vertising in SYSTEM. Do you know that many bookkeepers and business men dip their pens in ink but once to write 600 words  A lit- tle time - saving secret learned from an adver- tisement in SYSTEM. Do you know that in hundreds of retail stores packages are now wrapped and fastened without twine at a third the former cost  The merchants who are enjoying this shrewd little advantage over compet- itors gained it bv reading the adver- tisements in SYSTEM. If in planning to run your business on the most economical, efficient lines, you visited all the most pro- gressive offices or stores or factories of the country, ol serving the devices and short-cuts they used, you would only learn what you could learn from the advertising section of SYSTEM. One day the chief statistician of one of Australia s greatest gold mines came into SYSTEM'S office. From his pocket he took four closely type- written sheets a list of articles which his firm needed.  I have made up this sheet,  he said,  largely from the advertising pages of SYSTEM, and I want to go to the factories where these devices are made, to study and buy them first-hand.  lie was on a trip around the world in search of better methods and belter equipment for his business, and most of the ideas he a  i uired he had found in the advertisements in SYSTEM.       Two manufacturers in the smok- ing compartment of a New York- Chicago flyer were discussing the in- stallation of factory sprinkler systems and the apparently unavoidable dan- ger of accidental breaking of the sprinklerhead. A third man looked up from his newspaper.  I have my sprinkler equipped with a patent de- vice that obviates lhat danger,  he said, and went on to explain. "I saw it advertised in SYS- TEM a few months ago. It has already saved me hundreds of dollars.  The president of a great soap manufactur- ing concern, while study- ing the advertisement of an office appliance in SYSTEM, found the suggestion that enabled him to perfect an enor- mous machine he had struggled vainly for two years to com plete a ma- chine that is now saving him thousands of dollars a year in his plant.       From advertisements in SYSTEM some firms have learned how to se- cure their monthly trial balances two days quicker than other firms with an equal volume of business and at half the cost. Thousands of men have secured increased salaries by usinj; just a simple little method "learned from the advertising section of SYS- TEM that enables them to do more work or bigger work. Many men in the last few years have quit salaried positions, and without capital built up big successful businesses of their own. They were shown the way and given the inspiration in the advertis- ing section of SYSTEM.  ou would understand the reasons lack of many a firm s dividends, or bai k of many a man's salarv, if you read the advertisements in SYSTEM In answering advertisements please mention SCRIBNER'S MAGAZINE scftiBXE rs u.tcAzixr. advertiser 21 as i loselv as they do. Anri you could use the same methods if you desired. You could know how it is some mcr. hants and manufacturers collect 80% more of their had debts than do their competitors; why it rosts some merchants 40' c less to deliver goods than it costs others; how some men who spend less than you do on clothes or house furnishings, have better quality. The president of one of Chicago s largest tailoring houses lakes two topics of SYSTEM bv the year. One he reads. In the other he studies the advertising and clips the adver- tisement of every device or proposition that might save money for his busi- ness or increase its efli- iency. Then he sends these clippings to the proper department heads with instructions to investigate furtherand buy if they think best. Foralmost every o  er- ation in business, there is one best method or one best device, and the use of these short -cuts :s all that makes some men or tirmsgrowprosperous. while others stand still or fail. In the advertising pages of SYSTEM are pictured and explained short-cuts for almost everything you do and moneysavers for almost everything you buy. A retail merchant in a Michigan town had almost signed the lease of a bigger store, when he saw an ad- vertisement in SYSTEM that told him how he could make the space in his smaller store just as efficient as the larger one. lie is saving $16 a month rent. And these arc hut bare hints of the many ways in which the advertis- ing section of SYSTKM can be made valuable to you. Wherever your keenest interest lies in methods to work by, in machines to use, in foods to eat, in clothes to wear, in paper to write on, or in business op- porluniiies you will lie directed to them in the advertising pages of SYSTEM. And they will prove as interesting to you from a news standpoint as your daily jtafier  they will give you a bet- ter insight into the pro- cesses of business, make you 1 icttcr fitted to talk interestingly about busi- ness, and better able to understand develop- ments in the modern business world.

I he novel opens at the gaming tables of Aix-les-Bains, where a yQung Englishman, the hero, then holds the bank. That night, in a villa near the town, a woman is murdered under most curious circumstances, deeply involving a young girl; against her. the heroine, all suspicions are directed. Then Hanaud, the great detective, yielding to the hero's urging, takes up the case; and from that point, in a chain of rapidly follow- ing incidents, runs the narrative to a con- clusion abrupt and startling. Mr. Mason is already well known for his novels- - The Four Feathers  and " The Broken Road."

No story-teller of our day better succeeds at the very outset in creating the atmosphere than F. Hopkinson Smith, whose   Fortunes of Oliver Horn  was so greatly admired when it appeared as a serial in the Magazine and whose new novel,   Kennedy Square,   begins in November. Mr. Smith always introduces his read- ers to a group of peo- ple that are worth knowing, and he has the faculty of put- ting them before us in a manner that at once piques curiosity and enlists the sym- pathies. The time of the new story is set back some years l efore the war, and it begins with a charming picture of the return of a South- ern gentleman from a hunting trip and with an incident that leads at once into the love story that the author knows so well how to deal with. There is an element of idealism, a cheer- ful and genial appre- ciation of character. a spirit of irradiating optimism pervading the story. No one- better understands the underlying tenderness that so often attached master and man, father and son, in the old South, or the pride of race and often wilful, blind selfishness that has been the cause of much unhappiness. In one of the late chapters there is a most remarkable and dramatic scene, in which appears one of the fa- mous literary heroes of that time and this. There is no lack of movement; the story goes on rap- idly and with constantly varied incident. General Funston s vivid account of the fighting before Cascorra is not without a tribute to the pluck and bravery of the Spanish troops who re- fused to surrender when so hard pressed, and it is certainly a picture of warfare with all the ele- ments of highly romantic fiction. The touches of humor here and there, the description of the effect upon the nerves of being under fire the author giving an amusing impression of how he yielded to the irresistible impulse to dodge give the narrative a delightfully personal quality. After the campaign before Cascorra, General Gomez joined forces with another famous Cu- ban leader, General Calixto Garcia,  a man of the most un- doubted personal courage, a courteous and kindly gentle- man.  With Gen- eral Garcia were a number of other American officers in command of the ar- tillery, among them Major Winchester Dana Osgood, once a famous Cornell foot ball   layer, who met a tragic death in the battle that re- sulted in  The Fall of Guaimaro,  about which General Fun- ston will write in No- vember. V  V Few men have had more adventurous lives or have made more of their opportunities than Herbert Ward, the only surviving officer of Stanley's last expedition. Since early boyhood he has made many journeys into strange parts of the world, and the story of his exj eriences makes stirring reading. That they should have developed a remarkable and interesting per- sonality was to be expected, but that this forceful explorer and executive should prove to be the possessor also of a delicate artistic talent is certainly something out of the com- mon order. Within recent years Mr. Ward has developed a real genius as a sculptor, and 45 K Hnpkiitaon Smith, Autliui     tike new   efUI.   KciiiicJ  Square.' 46 MAGAZINE NOTES his work ha  already placed him in the front rank. Illustrations from his own sculptures accom- pany his article in this number on   The Real African.  Ills works have attracted great at- tention in the exhibitions. After many other honors, in the rccent Salon he was awarded a second medal, the highest given hitherto to foreigners. The award was made for the figure of the Congo savage who sits with outstretched legs drawing in the sand. It appears as an illus- tration on page 453. Mr. Ward's sculptures are done by one who not only knows the technique of his art, but as well feels the spirit and the mystery that surround primitive man. That he models with sympathy is made very evident in the closing sentence of his article:  It has been my experience that the longer one lives with Africans, the more one grows to love them." V  V  The mystery ami the romance of the great West, the days when countless buffalo roamed the plains, when the still uncivilized Indian lived the life of the hunter and changed his home as the game moved from place to place, are no more, so far as the West is concerned. But even to-day few stories appeal with greater force to the imagination than those that tell of the old frontier. Kmest Thompson Seton well expresses the charm of the past in the fol- lowing paragraph from the introduction to his first article, in the November number, telling of his joumeyings in the rarely visited and little known regions of the Arctic Prairies.  What young man of our race would not gladly give a year of his life to roll backward the scroll of time for five decades, and live that year in the romantic by-gone days of the Wild West; to see the great Missouri while the buffalo pas- tured on its banks, while big game teemed in sight and the red man roamed and hunted, un- checked by the fence or hint of white man s rule; or, when that rule was represented only by scattered trading posts, hundreds of miles apart, and at best the traders could exchange the news by horse or canoe, and months of lonely travel   I, for one, would have rejoiced in tenfold payment for the privilege of this backward look in our age, and had reached middle life before I realized that, at a much less heavy cost, the miracle was possible to-day.  Away up in the North-west conditions are much the same to-day as they were   five decades " ago in our own Western land. Here are hundreds of miles of absolutely  unbroken forest and   rairie leagues,  and the Indian s only knowledge of the white man s ways and manner of life is that obtained on his occasional visits to the fur-trad- ing posts. The wild buffalo is still found there, aiid there is  hoofed game by the million.  It was the prospect of realizing in the present the glamour of the days of the old Wild West that   spurred me to a six months  journey by canoe.  V V Sir Arthur Conan Doyle has written a group of three highly imaginative episodes of the past which he calls  Through the Mists.  They are a departure from anything he has heretofore done and have in them qualities that will give him quite a new place in the minds of readers. The first one,   The Coming of the Huns," will appear in November. The chief figure of the sketch is an old hermit who has sought escapc from the constant strife between the various sects in a distant re- treat beyond what is now known as the river Dneister. Here for a time he meditates in peace until he discovers another hermit who had likewise fled in search of freedom of worship and a place for meditation. Even'in the wilder- ness, however, the two holy men split irreconcil- ably on a question of doctrinc. Simon Melas had been a soldier and a man of affairs before ever he forsook the world, and so when one morning from the misty hill-side he saw  the whole vast expanse  of the plain  covered with horsemen,  he remembered how the hordes of barbarians had pushed back the Eastern Empire. His one thought was to warn the unsuspecting Romans of their peril, and after a hazardous ride he came to the camp of the young centurion Caius Crassus to tell him of the oncoming hosts. It is a wonderfully impressive and dramatic picture of one of the great epochs in the world s history. The illustrations have been made by N. C. Wyeth, whose powerfully imaginative drawings both in black and white and color have always been notable. V  V Another selection of letters from the  Cor- respondence of Washington Irving and John Howard Payne  will appear in November, edited by Thatcher T. Payne Luqucr, grand-nephew of Payne, by the way, not of Irving, as was in- advertently written last month.

XLVIII OCTOBER, 1910 NO. 4 CASCORRA, THE FIRST CUBAN SIEGE BY FREDERICK FUNSTON IWigadier-Ocncral U. S. Ar.r.y Illustrations by F. C. Yohn some misgivings. A member of his staff, Major Miguel Tarafa, in times of peace a Matanzas hanker, acted as interpreter. The general began by expressing his ap- preciation of the spirit which had impelled us foreigners to leave our homes and cast our lot with a people struggling for inde- pendence, and then bluntly asked me what 1 knew about artillery. I toid him frankly that my accomplishments were limited, to which he replied by saying,  Well, you cannot know any less than another Ameri- can who came down here and said he knew it all.  He then stated that he would place me in charge of the gun brought down on the Dauntless, and also of another and smaller Hotchkiss, one of 1.65 inch calibre, that he had with him, and said further that I would have the status of an officer with the privileges pertaining thereto, but that I would not actually be commissioned until after I had  made good.  Then passing from weightier subjects, he asked me if I had ever eaten sugar-cane, and I had to confess that my acquaintance with the edible properties of that plant were about on a par with my knowledge of ar- tillery.  Well.  he said, with a grim smile,  you cannot be a real rebel until you know how to cat sugar-cane,  whereat he took one of several joints from the ground under his hammock, and with the fine Moorish scimctar which he carried in lieu of the omnipresent machete, showed me how to strip off the tough bark and get at the juicy pulp. He then had me try it Copyright, 1910, by Charles Scribncr's Suos. All rights reserved day after reporting at always shifting head- irters of Maximo Gomez   spent by the expedition- 's, as all recent arrivals n the United States were called, in resting after the trying march from the coast, and in accustoming them- selves to strange surroundings and to a manner of life entirely new even to those who had seen no little of rough life in the open. All day long there arrived trains of pack-animals laden with the cargo of the Dauntless, and before nightfall there was a stack of boxes and bundles that looked de- cidedly larger than the hull of that vessel. During the day I had an occasional glimpse of our chieftain, whom 1 had met the previous evening. He was seated in a canvas hammock swung between a couple of small trees and spent most of the day go- ing over his mail that we had brought with us from the New York Junta, the only means of communication with the outside world enjoyed by the insurgents in the field. He dictated a few letters to his secretary, and after the noonday meal took a nap. Upon awakening .he swore roundly about something, addressing his remarks to his asistente, or jjcrsonal servant. 1 did not at that time understand Spanish, but judged from his gestures and tone of voice that he was not complimenting that individual on his accomplishments. Shortly after this he sent for me, and having but recently wit- nessed his outburst, I approached with Voi.. XI.VIII37 3S6 Cascorra, the First Cuban Siege with my own machete, and was no little amused at my awkwardness. From that time he always took a great interest in me, and if we came in contact when there was an interpreter at hand he would inquire how I was getting on and how I liked being a   mambi,  the uncom- plimentary term by which the Spaniards usually referred to the insurgents. He al- ways called me  Capi,  an abbreviation of the Spanish word capitan, captain. He was a stern, hard-hearted man, with a violent temper, but had in his nature some streaks of human kindness, that shone luminously by contrast. He re- sembled exactly the many pictures of him that were published while he was in the pubtic eye. He was a thin, wiry man with snow-white mustache and goatee, and was of pure Spanish descent, having the swarthy complexion of most Latins. In looking over the force that General Gomez had with him, several surprises were in store for us Americans, the princi- pal one being that it was composed almost entirely of white men. This is explained by the fact that the province of Puerto Prin- cipe, now known as Camaguey, has in its population a smaller proportion of negroes than another portion of Cuba. Later we were to see insurgent forces, from near San- tiago de Cuba and Manzanillo, consisting almost entirely of black men. The officers of the force that we were now with were, as a rule, planters, cattle-raisers, farmers, or professional or business men from the towns, and were as a class the best men of the native Cuban population. Scores of them sjjoke English, having been educated in the United States or having lived there. At this period of the war they were well mounted, and were dressed neatly in white duck, which being the clothing of the coun- try, really constituted the uniform of the in- surgents, so far as they could be said to have any. All were provided with appro- priate insignia of rank, and wore on their hats the tri-colored Cuban badge. The rank and file consisted mainly of employees of the plantations and cattle-ranches, and scattered among them a good many small farmers and cattlemen, with also clerks, mechanics, and laborers from the towns. They were ragged, and some, though not many, barefooted. They were armed with Mauser and Remington rifles and had well- filled cartridge pouches. Their rifles were badly cared for, nearly all being not only rusty, but fouled from not having been cleaned after use. All mounted officers and men carried the long or cavalry ma- chete, with a blade about two and one-half feet in length. These were formidable weapons for hand-to-hand work, and had all been brought to the island on fili- bustering exj editions, having been espe- cially manufactured for military purposes by a firm in Providence, R. I. Dismounted troops carried in addition to their rifles, the short machete, used mainly in times of peace in cutting cane and brush. Earlier in the war, before the insurgents had been supplied with an adequate number of fire- arms, there had been a number of occa- sions when small Spanish detachments had been surprised and overwhelmed by su- perior forces of Cubans rushing them with the machete and cutting down all who did not surrender. The principal object of these attacks was to obtain the fine Mausers with which the Spanish troops were armed, but at the time of our arrival, the Cubans having been well supplied with rifles, and as the Spaniards were operating in larger columns and taking greater pre- cautions to prevent surprises on the march, the machete had fallen from its high estate as a weapon of war, and was relegated to such prosaic work as digging sweet pota- toes, chopping firewood, and cutting up beef. Every ofiicer and man carried a ham- mock made of canvas or gunny sacks, and immediately on going into camp swung it between a couple of trees, using it by day as a chair and by night as a bed. Nobody except newly arrived foreigners ever slept on the ground, and they only once, the various brands of ants and other insects that thrive in Cuba being particularly in- dustrious and j estiferous. 1 he second morning after our arrival, the whole force assembled at this place started on one of those aimless marches that were the chief weakness of the insur- gent leaders. 1 he cargo of the Dauntless, except some ammunition and medical stores that had been distributed, was left behind under guard, to be removed a few days later and stored under sheds con- structed for the purpose at a point more distant from the coast. Cascorra, the First Cuban Siege 3S7 Reveille sounded at three o clock, hours l efore daybreak, the few provided with coffee had some prepared, horses that had been grazing throughout the night tied to picket-pins were saddled, another bugle- call sounded through the darkness, we fell into column of twos, and the cavalcade started. We new arrivals, all of whom except General Cabrera had marched on foot from the coast, had been provided with mounts, and I drew the first of the nine- teen horses that I was to lose in one way or another. We were following a narrow country road leading in a southerly direc- tion. Daylight came in due time, and then flankers and scouts were thrown out from   the column. We foreigners were in ecsta- sies over the beautiful scenery, now that we had left behind the savannas and mangrove swamps of the coast, and were crossing the rolling uplands of the interior. A large part of the country was primeval forest, with here and there little clearings in which were grown corn, beans, sugar-cane, squashes, sweet potatoes, yucca or manioc, and other vegetables. There were also great polreros, or prairies, of thousands of acres of guinea grass from three to six feet high, on which grazed herds of fat, sleek cattle, at this period the principal source of the food-supply of the insurgents. In this motley band winding its way across country we of the Dauntless in our New York clothes seemed strangely out of place, and looked alx ut as ridiculous as we felt. At eleven o clock the bugles blew   halt,  and we scattered out along the mar- gin of a wood. Horses were unsaddled and picketed to graze, hammocks swung, and fires started. A detail of men rode out to the most convenient herd and drove in a number of beeves, which were killed and dressed and the meat distributed in less than an hour. During the forenoon, as we had passed the numerous houses with their little clearings, toll had been taken in the form of such vegetables as were to be had. Also, some men had ridden a mile or two out on the flanks of the line of march and had come in with their pack-animals laden with vegetables. The beef and vegetables were cut up and placed in small iron kettles to boil. These kettles, which would hold, as a rule, enough for four or five persons, were carried on the march on the backs of men or strapped onto saddles, to the great discomfort of the unfortunate beasts con- cerned. Those who had been unable to procure kettles roasted their food before fires. A negro had been assigned to attend to the wants of the five foreigners who had come on the Dauntless, so that we were spared the hardships that would have been our lot if we had been compelled to hustle for ourselves in the midst of such strange surroundings. At one o clock the first meal of the day was ready. We were fiercely hungry, and had no fault to find with the food set before us, it being very satisfying to healthy men with good apj e- tites. Some weeks later we began to make deprecatory remarks about this  aijacco,  Or everlasting stew of meat and vegetables, and to long for the wheaten bread and mut- ton chops of other days. Luckily for our j eace of mind, we could not look into the future and see the days when the whole country should have l ccn desolated by war. when the cattle were all gone and we had to live almost exclusively on fruits and vegetables, and mighty few of those. When the lean times came and we rode for days fairly faint from hunger, when a piece of meat of any kind was a luxury, we looked back longingly to those days of comparative plenty in Camagucy and wondered how we ever could have been dissatisfied. After the meal had been finished, all stretched out in their hammocks and slept for a couple of hours. Then the camp livened up, there were visits back and forth, card games, and some singing by those who had accomplishments in that line. The newspapers that we had brought down from New York were passed from hand to hand and read and reread until they were worn out. J list after dark came the second and last meal of the day, exactly like the first. Then groups gathered about camp- fires and talked until late at night. Then tattoo and taps, blown by a superb bugler, whose equal I have never heard in the United States Service, and we stretched out in our hammocks to sleep. Again at three o clock came reveille and the beginning of another day s march. This march and camp have been described somewhat in de- tail, as they were typical of those features of our life for the next two years. Unless chasing Spaniards or being chased by them, Cascorra, the First Cuban Siege the Cubans rarely made more than one march a day, and this l egan two hours be- fore daybreak and ended before noon. But there arose occasions when we tore through the country regardless of this custom. The first day s march of the column had been through a part of the country not yet touched by the war, but on the second day there was a decided contrast. As we ap- proached the great Camino Real or Royal Road leading eastward from Puerto Prin- cipe, we saw on all sides the ruins of burned houses, and barb-wire fences had been cut until there was but little of them left but the standing posts and tangled meshes of wire in the grass. Before the war was over Spaniards and insurgents had clashed on nearly every league of that road from Puerto Principe to historic Guaitnaro. a distance of seventy miles. We passed through die jjotrero of La Machuca, where a few weeks later we were to "mix it  with a column of the enemy under General Cas- tellanos, and marched through the ruins of the little town of Sibanicu, and had pointed out to us three miles to the eastward the church lower of Cascorra, that obscure vil- lage so soon to add to the glory of Spanish arms, every survivor of its heroic garrison to receive the coveted  Cross of San Fer- nando,  the Spanish equivalent of our Congressional Medal of Honor and of the Victoria Cross of Great Britain. At ten o clock we passed to the south- ward, and an hour later went into camp at the abandoned cattle-ranch known as La Yaya. The owner s house had not been burned, and General Gomez s staff estab- lished themselves in it, but the  Old Man,  as we had learned to call him behind his back, ordered his hammock swung from a couple of trees across the road. About two miles distant was the humble home of a very decent Cuban family, and soon there came an invitation for Hunting- ton, Potter, VVelsford, and myself to stay with them until we could be suitably out- fitted for life in the field. Walinski did not accompany us, having gone to the westward with General Cabrera, and we never saw him again. The invitation to visit this family was no doubt the result of an in- timation from some member of the gen- eral s staff, but nothing could have exceeded the kindness and courtesy with which we were treated during our stay. We chafed at the delav, but finally there arrived our outfits, white duck suits, heavy shoes, leg- gings, and Panama hats, and we were ready for war. While we were being rigged out, General Gomez had gone on one of his usual aimless marches and had returned to La Yaya. He sent for me, and through Major Tarafa stated that he was going to attack the town of Cascorra, but with small hope of success, as it was known that the commandant was a man of excep- tional resource and courage, and that the garrison, a part of the 1'ourth Battalion of Tarragona, was made up of Catalonians, those northern Spaniards famous for the desperate courage with which they usually defend any   ost entrusted to them. I.told the general frankly, that so far as the ar- tillery was concerned it could do no more than batter down the blockhouses anti forti- fied buildings with common shell, the only form of projectiles other than canister with which we were provided, and that without shrapnel but little damage could be done to the defenders after they had taken to their trenches, which would be as soon as we began to blow the buildings about their ears. The result of this observation was a round cursing of the Junta for having sent no shrapnel. General Javier Vega, Gomez s chief of staff, was present at this conversation. He was a silent sort of man, and apparently knew as little as did his chief regarding the limitations of the small guns that we were to use. After a few days we started on a long, roundabout march. I do not know where we went except that our course was gener- ally to the eastward. We passed around the town of Guaimaro and saw the Spanish  lag floating defiantly from the head quar- ters building, little dreaming that in a few short weeks it was to be lowered after des- iderate and prolonged fighting, and that the entire garrison would become our prisoners.    n this occasion, a group of us, including the general and his staff, sat on our horses on a ridge only eight hundred yards irom tlie nearest Spanish work. W ith us was the insurgent llag carried by head-quarters, so that our character was known to the gar- rison. but there was no exchange of shots. A well-directed volley at this time might have rid Spain of the fiery old guerilla, who through two wars had been a thorn in her flesh. After leaving Cluaimaro, the gen- Cascoria, the First Cuban Siege 3S9 eral concluded he would like to try out his two guns, the target being a rock in a past- ure, distant al out eight hundred yards. It was the first time I had ever had any- thing to do with firing a cannon, and my shooting was not good, hut the shells when they struck the ground hurst with a lively building strengthened l y bags of earth ex- tending to the loopholes, which were about five feet above the floor. In times of peace this building had done duty as a tavern. About five hundred yards to the south-east, and lying directly south of the centre of the village, was a strong stone church, which AU day long there arrived tr iirir-   f pack-animals laden with the cargo of the DautttUis. Page 385. bang and much smoke, and the onlookers were very much impressed. From here we marched back to La V'aya, passing north of Guaimaro. A day or two later the gen- eral announced that he was ready to try Cascorra. and sent General Vega and my- self to select positions for the artillery. We set out accompanied only by a few order- lies, and leaving these finally in charge of the horses, crawled on our hands and knees all about the town, a task that consumed the entire day. The town was a small one, having under normal conditions a popula- tion of only a couple of hundred, but there were now but very few non-combatants left, they having either lied to Puerto Prin- cipe for the protection of a larger garrison or taken to the field with the insurgents. The garrison consisted of one hundred and sixty men, all infantry, and having no ar- tillery. These troops occupied three de- fensive positions as follows: at the western or Puerto Principe side, at the point where the Camino Real enters the town, a brick Vol. XLVIII. 38 like the tavern was loopholed and strength- ened by bags of earth. Both the church and the tavern were surrounded by stand- ing trenches. On the east side of the town was a strong earthen redoubt defended by about half the garrison. This, as well as the fortified buildings, was surrounded by a maze of barb-wire entanglements, while the three works, which formed an almost equi- lateral triangle enclosing the town, were connected by closely built barb-wire fences. It was plain, even to a layman in the art of war, that we had a big job cut out for us. It would not be difficult quickly to render the church and the tavern untenable, but this would result only in driving their de- fenders to the trenches, where they would be in but little danger from shell lire, while the destruction of the small but substantial redoubt was a siege gun job. Artillery   ositions were hard to find. It must be remembered that this was before the day of indirect fire, and even if it had not been, there was among us no one who could have 390 Cascorra, the First Cuban Siege made use of it. We would have to he able to see our target. There was a low ridge fifteen hundred yards to the eastward of the redoubt, and 1 favored this position, know- ing that from it we could destroy the church and tavern, and that we could not seriously damage the redoubt at any distance. It was believed that with these buildings bat- tered down, the infantry could rush the trenches surrounding them, and then mijjht be able to work up closely enough under cover of the houses of the town to stand some chance of getting into the redoubt. In the opinion of General Vega, the posi- tion preferred by me was entirely too far from the two most vulnerable defences, which it was desired to attack first. We had crawled through the grass to within four hundred yards of the tavern, and at this point the general selected the first position for the artillery. I was horrified, but kept my views to myself. The inter- vening ground was level, and covered with a growth of bushes and of guinea grass about four feet high, with here and there a few scattered trees of good size. During the day spent in spying out the environs of Cascorra we had not seen a Spaniard, but had heard the soldiers laughing and sing- ing. I.ittle they foresaw the storm that was soon to break upon them. We returned to La Yaya late that night, and then things began to happen more rapidly. The next day Gomez and his eight hundred men marched over to the town and went into camp in several posi- tions completely surrounding it. That night a detail of men under the engineer officer attached to head-quarters con- structed a typical Cuban trinrhera, a sort of parapet, at the position selected for the artillery. As we were to make use of this type of defence on many subsequent occasions, this one merits a brief descrip- tion. Two rows of stakes about six feet high and three feet apart were driven into the ground, ami the space between them filled in with tightly tamped earth, which was held in place by a revetment of poles and fence rails, laid one on top of the other inside the two rows of stakes as the earth was filled in. A gap about the size of an ordinary door was left for the gun to be fired through. There was thus protection for a few of the infantry support and for the ammunition and the men handling it, but those actually loading and aiming the piece would be completely exposed. We Ameri- cans watched the work for a while and then walked over to camp in no particularly hilarious frame of mind. While a detail of Cubans had been provided to attend to the transportation of the guns and their ammu- nition and do other heavy work, we were expected to do the actual loading, aiming, and tiring, and realized that wc were up against it good and hard. We lay down in our hammocks, but I for one could not sleep a wink. At four o clock we rose and walked over to the position. The parapet was practically completed, and soon the in- fantry support of alxiut a hundred men arrived. A few of these found cover lie- hind the parapet, but the majority were deployed on its flanks and lay down fiat on their faces. The insurgents had sur- rounded the town so quietly the day be- fore that it is doubtful if the Spaniards had suspected their presence. It must be taken into consideration that it was impossible for so small a garrison to send out patrols, as they would quickly have been cut up by the ever-watchful Cubans. The noise made in building the parapet must have been heard, however, although it was no doubt difficult to estimate the distance from their position. As a matter of fact, if a hot fire had been opened and maintained, keeping the bullets well down to the ground, the work would have been mate- rially interfered with. The two hours re- maining until daylight dragged heavily. It had l een resolved not to use the smaller gun at this time, but the Hotchkiss twelve-pounder, that had begun its warlike career over the Third Avenue saloon, was placed in position, the wheel rojies, sight, and other paraphernalia put on, a number of boxes of shells were brought up, and we sat down and waited for daylight to lift the curtain. It was to be the baptism of fire for four of Pagluchi s wards, and a sizzling red-hot one. Except for the calls of the sentries and occasional howl of a dog, the little town was as quiet as death itself. At last the suspense was over, the dark- ness began to give way, and we could make out the upper part of the tavern, the view of the lower part and of the surrounding trenches being obstructed by the brush and grass. It had been left for me to decide when to o  cn fire, and now I gave the word. Drawn Ay F. C. Ytthu. A well-directed valley at this time might have rid Spain of the fiery old guerilla-  Page 388.

In a few seconds I was satisfied, gave the screw a turn to lower the muzzle, and stepping from the piece climbed on top of the parapet to the windward of the gun in order to observe the shot, yelled  Fire  to Pennie, and the ball had begun. I had forgotten to place my hands over my ears and was almost deafened by the crash within a few feet of my head. A fraction of a second later I saw a burst of tlame and smoke from the upper part of the building 392 and saw the bricks come tumbling, down. Jumping down at once from my exjx sed position. I landed on the back of a Cuban patriot who was lying behind the para  et anrl put him out of that battle, the first casualty in the siege of Cascorra. My shot had been a bit higher than was in- tended, but had done its work. As the gun had roared out and the smoke was seen pouring from the building, the Cubans all about the town raised a great veil of   Cuba Libre   We rushed to the gun and soon stint in another, a centre shot that blew a lot of earth-filled hags to smithereens and made a tine hole. We had begun to won- der whether there was to Ik  a fight or not, as not a shot had been fired in reply, but now the storm broke, and a fine blizzard it was. The air was suddenly full of those peculiar   opping noises that we were soon to know so well, leaves dropjied from the trees, there were odd movements in the grass, a patter against the opposite side of Cascorra, the First Cuban Siege 393 our shelter was distinctly audible, and a bullet struck the lire of one of the gun- whecls with a sound like a blow from a hammer. The nervousness of waiting was over, the lighting blood in us mounted quickly, and with yells and cheers and amid the enthusiastic  Bravos   of the near-by Cubans, we sprang to the gun and for a short lime loaded and tired so rapidly that the barrel of the piece became badly heated. The parapet afforded excellent protection for those who were behind it,but the exact position of the gun was indicated by its smoke, so that an uncomfortable number of bullets came through the gap left for it. We could see only the roof of the church, and could not easily bring to bear on it on account of its angle from the parapet, but the men in the trenches around it made out our exact location from the smoke and soon began to take an inter- est in the proceedings. We were partially protected from their tire by the right wing of the parapet, though the ground all about us was made exceedingly dangerous. I ess than a minute after the enemy had opened fire, a Cuban infantryman standing near us had his attention called to blood trickling down his once white trousers, and sank to the ground, calling on most of the saints in the calendar. The man had received a flesh wound, being shot through the thigh, but was so excited that he did not know ii, thinking that some one had accidentally struck him. 1 have known of several simi- lar cases. As I was aiming the gun for about the twelfth shot, I fell a hard blow on the sole of my left foot and made a fall that afterward cost me no end of chaffing and inquiries as to whether or not 1 had at some time l een one of the ornaments of the theatrical profession. A bullet had split the sole of my left shoe and knocked off the heel, but had inflicted no more severe injury than a considerable bruise. Occa- sionally a man was hit and carried away, but despite all the uproar there were but few casualties. And so this strange little battle went on for an hour, now fast and furious for a few moments and now almost dying out for a like time. So far it had been a contest between about eighty Span- ish infantrymen and a handful of men with a cannon. The Cuban infantry had not yet opened tire, as there was no satisfac- tory target for them and there was danger of hitting their comrades scattered around the town, and the Spaniards in the re- doubt could do nothing but listen to the sound and fury, as the tavern was in a di- rect line between them and our position. The building which had at first been our target had been almost reduced to rubbish, and we were firing low in order to make hits on the trenches around it, but it was unsatisfactory work, as there was no way to ascertain the effects of our shots owing to the intervening grass. Several times we dragged the gun from behind the parapet and took shots at the church, with no other effect than to damage the building some- what and to draw an increased fire from its defenders. We had accomplished all wc could from our present  M sition, so I walked over to General Gomez s head-quarters, distant about four hundred yards, and suggested that we keep up a slow fire during the re- mainder of the day and that at night a new parapet bearing on the church be built. This was agreed to, and I started on my return to the gun. On the way I walked over to where our ammunition-mules were standing to see how they were getting on. A couple of them had been slightly wounded, and while I was looking them over, one big fellow received a Mauser bul- let through the nose. He was cropping grass at the time, and for a few seconds shook his head vigorously and then went on eating. We Americans took a great inter- est in those mules, having been told by the Cubans that they were  countrymen  of ours, as they had been taken from a sugar plantation the owner of which had bought them in the United States. The gun had become so heated by a rapid spurt of firing toward the last, that the breech-block had expanded to such an extent that it could not be worked. The mechanism was taken apart and thoroughly oiled, but we finally had to resort to pour- ing water on the affected parts, a very slow process, as the supply had to be brought from some distance, and naturally was not cool. The Spanish fire had died down to an occasional volley, and our  battle  was beginning to drag. We sat around behind the parapet discussing the incidents of the day, and about every half-hour sent in a shell just to let our friends the enemy know that we were still on the job. 394 Cascorra, the First Cuban Siege At dark we returned to our camp near head quarters and I had a long talk with the general, who expressed his keen appre- ciation of the way we had done our work. He was apparently in doubt as to the next step to take. I took the liberty of telling him that he would never take the town unless he was willing to throw in his infan- try just so soon as we had destroyed the church. It must have seemed abominably cheeky for a man just out of his first tight to be giving advice on military matters to a man who had been under fire before he was born, but no offence was taken. The gen- eral explained that while his men had capt- ured some small towns by surprising and rushing the garrisons, they had never yet made an assault on men on the alert in good trenches, protected by entanglements, and he feared that they were not equal to it. A repulse, he said, would badly demoralize them. He felt that they could take the church and tavern positions, but with the redoubt bearing on both still in the hands of the enemy, no advantage would be gained. His men could not successfully assault this, the real key to the position. It was evident that the promised parapet bearing on the church would not be built that night. The second day was a rc-  etition of the afternoon of the first, a shot about ever ' half-hour at either the tavern or the church and an occasional volley from the trenches in reply. That evening we Americans talked the matter over, and Jones and I were delegated to say to the general that if he would have a good jiosition constructed that night from which we might effectively shell the church, and give us an hour in the morning in which to destroy that building, we would gladly lead an assault on that and the tavern positions, fixing two hun- dred as the numlx-r of men required for the enterprise. It was our theory that if we made the dash the Cubans would follow us, and that once in the shelter of the trenches, we could not be driven out by lire from the redoubt, and if the eighty men in the latter made a sortie against us, which was unlikely, their work would quickly be occupied by a force kept in hand for the purpose, in view of the successful as- saults made subsequently by the Cubans at Guaimaro and Las Tunas, I have not the slightest doubt that we would have suc- ceeded. though at heavy cost. Several Cu- ban officers, hearing of our proposal, vol- unteered to assist in leading the attack. At one time the general came near yielding, but finally came out with an abrupt  No,  telling us that we were madmen. He gave us the cheering information, however, that he was going to order the construction of another parapet for the gun, much nearer to the trenches around the ruins of the tavern, where our view would be unob- structed by grass and brush, and that he expected us from this new position literally to blow the dons out of the ground. Jones and I maintained a discreet silence until out of earshot, and then made a few un- printable remarks about the turn affairs had taken. Among the officers serving with the in- surgents was General Avelino Rosa, a Co- lombian, exiled for j olitical reasons from his own land. He was a man brave almost to rashness, but exceedingly unpractical. General Rosa was in direct command of the force of infantry and dismounted cav- alry surrounding the town, and had worked some of his men nearer and nearer to the tavern position by taking advantage of inequalities of the ground, and during the second day of the bombardment had livened matters by exchanging shots at short range with its defenders. He had reported to General Gomez that by taking advantage of the cover afforded by a ra- vine we could obtain a position within two hundred yards of the tavern, where we would be in full view of the trenches and could undoubtedly destroy them. He was ordered to construct the necessary parapet that night. This in itself was an ex- tremely ticklish operation, but the material was prepared at a distance and placed in position as quietly as possible. The work had to be carried on intermittingly, as at the slightest noise the Spaniards opened up with volleys. The parapet was com- pleted just before dawn, having cost the lives of several men. It was very short, extending only about eight feet on each side of the opening left for the gun. The upper part had I non built across the top of the o H.-ning with a hoj e of affording some pro- tection to those actually handling the piece. Before daylight a detail dragged the much- abused Hotchkiss quietly into the ravine  396 Cascorra, the First Cuban Siege and along it until we were directly opposite the new position, when it was hoisted out. the unavoidable noise drawing a fire that killed one man. I felt morally certain that we could never serve the gun from here, but it was agreed among us that whatever might occur, we were not to show the white feather or ask to be allowed to get out. Months afterward Pennie and I, visiting the ruins of Cascorra, paced the dis- tance from our parapet to the trenches and found it to be two hundred and sixteen yards. Here we were protected from the fire of the church by interv ening buildings, but, to the dismay of all concerned, it was found after it was too late to remedy the de- fect that we were exjiosed to fire from one corner of the redoubt. So far. the smaller gun, the two-pounder Hotchkiss, had not been used, but on this same night a position was constructed for it about two hundred yards to our left rear, and placed under charge of Jones. We waited in our new posts until it was thoroughly light before opening fire, but not so with the enemy. With the breaking of day the Spaniards made out the exact loca- tion of the little parapet, the construction of which had drawn their tire during the night, and opened on us holly, but without result, as we were in the ravine a few yards to the rear of the gun, where also was a strong infantry support under General Rosa. When it was thoroughly light we crawled out of the ravine on all fours, and sent in a shell that landed squarely on the low line of earth-filled bags that capfied the low parapet of the Spanish trench, exploding with a bang that sounded almost as loud to us as the rejiort of the piece itself. The men at the two-pounder were awaiting the cue, and almost immediately we heard its sharp crack, and a shell whistled past us. We had fastened a rope to the trail of our gun, and immediately dragged it behind shelter to be reloaded. Again it was pushed up to the gap and fired. The Spaniards were replying furiously, and the worst of it was that their bullets were all coming close down to the ground, and were aimed at the gaping porthole which they could so plainly see. It has fallen to me to participate in a good many fights in Cuba and the Philippines, but never anywhere have I seen the equal of what was poured into us during the hour that we held this position. The air was fairly alive with the sound of bullets, and their patter against the side of the parapet was so incessant that it would have been impossible to count them. The bark on near-by trees was cut to ribbons, and small bushes on our front were destroyed. After a few shots from our gun, the head cover connecting the tops of the two wings of the parapet was blown to pieces, a result that should have been foreseen, as the barrel of the piece was not sufficiently long for the muzzle to clear the parapet. Under such circumstances, aiming the gun, the oniy part of its service which was required to be done while it was exposed, was enough to try the nerves of any but a wooden man. Fortunately this was the work of but a couple of seconds, the target being so plain and so close at hand. In an attempt to keep down the Spanish fire, our infantry supports opened vigorously and added to the racket and confusion, but under the circumstances could not be ex  ected to accomplish much, the enemy being too well sheltered. We were in a bad box, and I am sure all hoped to lie ordered out of it soon. We were tearing up the tops of the Spaniards  trenches, but their fire was not diminishing, and they were constantly repairing the damage by filling bags of earth in the trenches and placing them in  x sition without exposing themselves. The fight had lasted about three-quarters of an hour when I noticed some thirty Spanish soldiers, the first I had ever actu- ally seen, leave the redoubt and dash for the tavern trenches. They covered the ground by short rushes, throwing them- selves prone about every sixty yards. At first it was thought that they were going to attempt to rush our position, improbable as such an enterprise seemed, but it was merely a reinforcement for the worn-out men who were making such a gallant fight against us. I attempted to take a shot at them, but the gun missed fire. I was aiming the fifteenth shell when a bullet struck one of the trunnions almost at my nose. My nerves had ljeen getting pretty shaky from several narrow escapes in sighting preceding shots, and I must confess that I threw myself flat on the ground and rolled to cover. Joyce jumj ed over me, quickly sighted the piece, and sprang from the gun. The imperturbable I ennie, lying on the ground and smoking Taking the trail-rope, wc made a quick run. a cigarette, jerked the lanyard ami tired the last shot from this terrible death-trap. General Gomez had delegated to General Rosa the necessary authority to discon- tinue tiring from this position whenever he thought best, and the latter, who was near at hand, ordered us to take cover in the ravine, abandoning the gun for the time being, although it was in no danger of capture, owing to the proximity of strong supports. Now that they had put the gun out of action, the Spaniards concentrated their lire on the Cuban infantry and in- flicted several casualties. It was necessary to recover the gun, so in about halt an hour three of us crawled stealthily out of the ra . ine and wriggled our way to it Taking the trail-rope, we made a quick run, and despite a hot tire reached the ravine and tumbled down the bank with little cere- mony, pulling the gun after us with such haste that it landed up side down in the bottom. The twoqjounder, being in a less exposed i osition, continued to tire at 397 Cascorra, the First Cuban Siege intervals during the day. but with prac- tically no effect, owing to the small size of its projectiles. I rejiorted to our chief, and half expected a wigging because we had been unable to slaughter all the Spaniards in the trenches, but on the contrary was very kindly re- was momentarily expected. There had been about twenty casualties so far, all except one from shell lire, whereupon we amateur artillerymen patted ourselves on the back at the first opportunity. The first shell of the fight, taking them by sur- prise. had killed three men in the tavern. We vaw twu officers leave the redoubt and proceed on fool to meet the bearer Page 399. reived. General Rosa having made a some- what glowing report of what we had done. That night two Cuban non-combatants, despite the vigilance of the Spaniards, suc- ceeded in escaping from the town and came to our camp and were brought l efore the general, who abused them roundly for hav- ing remained under the protection of the enemy while their countrymen were under- going the dangers and privations of the field. They were a very abject pair, and told all they knew about conditions in the town, and some l esides. The garrison were badly worn out by the constant vigi- lance imposed, but apparently were well supplied with provisions and ammunition, and were improving their defences every night. They also stated that an assault Early the next morning, the fourth day of the siege, the general sent me with Gen- eral Vega to look for a position from which we could fire on both the redoubt and the church. For the time being he was through with fighting his artillery at long pistol-range, anil quickly approved when informed that we had chosen the low ridge east of the town, this being about fifteen hundred yards from the redoubt, and eighteen hundred from the church. It had the further advantage that a shell clearing the redoubt would almost certainly land in the much-battered tavern position. I he two-pounder was left where it was to amuse our friends in the tavern trenches, and I was ordered to take the larger gun around the town to the ridge. The dis- Cascorra, the First Cuban Siege 399 tance was so great that it was not consid- ered accessary to construct cover. About noon wc opened, landing Lhe first shell squarely in the centre of the work, and until dark fired slowly, as our ammunition was now running low. Occasionally, just to vary the proceedings, we paid our re- spects to the church, though I managed to miss it a couple of times, the end instead of the sides being toward us. The Spaniards were not inclined to expend much ammuni- tion on us at this distance, and kept up a slow fire, evidently using their best shots for the purpose, as their shooting was fairly accurate. We suffered no casualties here during the two days that the ridge was oc- cupied, though the gun was struck once. Our infantry support, w'hich had had the unhappy faculty of catching bullets meant for us, was some distance to the rear and flank, and consequently out of danger. A portion of the Cuban infantry still held onto the ravine near our old artillery posi- tion, and kept up a useless fusillade. The next day, for the first time, the gen- eral visited the gun while it was in action. On one occasion, just as it had lieen laid, he looked through the sights and jokingly re- marked that we must be trying to shoot over the target, and said he would try his luck. He gave the screw a sharp turn, low- ering the muzzle, and then himself pulled the lanyard. The shell ripped up some of the scenery about three hundred yards short of the redoubt, but the reader can rest as- sured that nobody thought of laughing. I relieved the strain by assuring the general that the cartridge must have l een defective. About the middle of the afternoon he came again, accompanied by his entire staff, and we realized from the looks on the faces of all that something was about to take place. The general, sitting on the ground a few paces from us, dictated a letter to his secretary , and after it had been copied, signed it; a Porto Rican major in the Cuban service, a gallant fellow whose name I cannot now recall, mounted his horse, and holding aloft a white flag, trotted toward the redoubt. Some time previously instructions had been sent to all the Cuban detachments to cease fire. The appearance of the Porto Rican in the open was the signal for a hot fusillade directed at him, despite the flag of truce. For a time it seemed inevitable that he must be hit, but he never faltered. We had about con- cluded that the enemy would not recognize the flag, when his fire died out, and we saw two officers leave the redoubt and proceed on foot to meet the bearer. They met al out four hundred yards from the Spanish works; the plucky officer delivered his letter, and was compelled to sit on his horse with his back to the enemy s position until a reply from the Spanish major could be delivered, when he galloped toward us. That night a member of the general s staff showed us the correspondence. General Gomez s letter was a brief and courteous communication complimenting the com- mander of the garrison on his heroic defence against such great odds, and suggesting that he had done all that duty demanded of him in that respect, and ended by demanding his surrender, assuring him that he and his officers and men would be as well treated as the limited resources of the Cubans would permit. The Spaniard s reply was equally courteous, but stated that he would defend his post to the last extremity. A short time later firing was resumed, but this sort of fighting had l ecomc pretty monoto- nous to all concerned, and not much spirit was shown on either side. One of the bits of information brought to us by the two non-combatants who had escaped from the town, was that the gar- rison of the church position, with the ex- ception of those actually on duty in the trenches, slept in the building at night, taking it for granted that wc could not then use our artillery. The result was an order for me to sight the gun at the church very carefully before nightfall, station a guard over it, and have the piece fired at ten o clock. I did not exactly like this task, as it savored somewhat of assassination, but carried out my instructions. It was subsequently learned that this shell killed and wounded four men. The siege had now lasted five days, and practically nothing had been accomplished except to kill some Spaniards, damage their works considerably, and all but wear out the garrison. There were only about thirty shells left for the twelve-pounder, and a hundred shell and canister for the smaller gun. A supply for both guns had l een sent for to a dcposito far away in the woods of Santiago province, but could not arrive for some days. 400 Cascorra, the First Cuban Siege The next four days the artillery was out of it, but the infantry kept the town closely invested, and denied sleep and rest to the harassed defenders. During this time one of the few Cubans remaining in Cascorra was caught trying to sneak through the in surgent lines at night. The next day he was tried and condemned. As the trem- bling wretch was led through our camp to die it made us sick at heart, as did many an event of like nature afterward. But any American who will read of the cheerful manner in which his ancestors hanged each other during the lighting between patriots anti Tories in the Carolinas and Georgia in our Revolution can throw mighty few stones at the Cubans or any one else. Another tragic incident was the trial and execution of an insurgent officer. We could never get the straight of this, as our comrades were very loth to discuss the matter with foreign- ers. but it was rumored that he was found to have been in correspondence with the Spanish authorities in Puerto Principe. In the early days of the investment, with- out our knowledge, the Spanish commander had sent a sergeant through our lines at night, and this man by the greatest resource and courage, travelling by night and hiding in the woods by day, had succeeded in reaching the railway line north of Nuevitas, whence the news that Cascorra was under- going siege was telegraphed to General Castellanos, the commander of the district of Puerto Principe in the city of that name. The result was that one day a mounted messenger dashed into our camp and brought the news that a large column was en-route from Puerto Principe, and was being observed and harassed by a small force of cavalry. During the siege various organizations had joined us from near-by parts of the island, and the general now had about fifteen hundred men. He or- dered us to expend at once all the remaining artillery ammunition on the town, not with any hope of taking it, but todoas much dam- age as possible before its impending relief. We l eggcd that we be allowed to save what little we had left and use it in the fight with the advancing column, but he would have none of it. So that night a parapet, the best we had yet had. was constructed at the astonishingly short distance of one hundred ami eighty three yards from the tavern trenches. The brief light there the next day until we could expend our thirty shells was in a milder way a repetition of the third day. The Spanish fire was hot, but not so well directed. Nevertheless, at such short range it was serious work. Three men were killed behind our short para  et, and toward the last I heard a bullet strike Joyce, and turned around just in time to hear him say with the utmost self-posses- sion: "Well, this reminds me of a little The infantry followed and attacked their rear-ward repeatedly._Page 401. Cascorra, the First Cuban Siege 401 story.  A man who can make such an off- hand remark as a bullet tears a big hole in his thigh probably deserves the palm for self-possession. We had a hard time carry- ing him out under fire. He was sent to one of the lonely hospitals in the bush, and so missed our great victory at Guaimaro, but was back to duty long before Jiguani. A few more shots and the twelve-pounder was through. That night the rain poured in torrents, the Cubans were drawn from about the town and concentrated a mile to the westward, all except a small escort for the two-pounder, which enlivened the night by fighting until its last cartridge was gone. The next day we remained in a sodden camp. The siege of Cascorra was over, but every hour couriers raced madly into camp with news of the whereabouts of the column of two thousand five hundred men with ten guns under General Castellanos. The next day was an eventful one, but is not a part of this story. The guns were sent away under escort, but we artillery- men at our request were allowed for the lime being to join the cavalry as volun- teers, and were provided with carbines. Couriers came in faster and faster, and finally we heard the crackle of rifle-fire to the westward as the Spanish column came on, brushing aside the tormentors hanging on its flanks. Then came the clash, the battle of La Machuca. There was no hope of preventing the relief of the town, but the general was determined to make the Span- iards know that they had had a fight, and he certainly accomplished that purpose. The day was a perfect one and the enter- tainment of the best. For three hours the Spanish volleys and the rattling irregular fire of the Cubans made a pandemonium, added to by the booming of the Spanish batteries. A thin film of smoke drifted alx vc the tree-tops, and all was cxcitcment and noise. But the Spaniards broke through and entered the town. Certainly visitors were never more welcome. They camped there that night, and the Cubans fired on them incessantly. It is a safe guess that not one of them had a wink of sleep. The garrison was increased, the ammuni- tion supply replenished, and the defences improved, and on the evening of the next day the column issued from the town on its return, and the Cubans were promptly up- on them. They made a few miles before nightfall and bivouacked, peppered all night by their tormentors. The next morn- ing about three o'clock they resumed the march. The whole fifteen hundred of us were drawn up on both sides of the Camino Real to give them another fight, but the col- umn turned to the north-westward, passed our left flank l efore our dispositions could be changed, and headed for the railroad between Las Minas and Nuevitas. The infantry followed and attacked their rear- guard rejjcatedly, while five hundred of us mounted men, under the general himself, hung onto their left flank. It was a lively and exciting day. A few shots would grow into a heavy roll of fire, to die out in a few moments, and begin again in another quarter. And so we swept along all of a beautiful day. Just after dark, as they were going into bivouac, the last clash with the rear-guard occurred. The next morning the mounted men made a savage attack on the advance-guard, and a lively scrimmage ensued in which we had three killed and sixteen wounded. Poor Potter, one of Fagluchi s wards, had both legs shattered and had his horse killed under him, and spent the next year on his back in one of the lonely hospitals. He never re- turned from Cuba, but became a resident of Puerto Principe, where he lives to-day. The Spaniards reached the railroad on this forenoon, and we marched eastward to meet General Calixto Garcia, and in combination with his force to more than wipe out the failure of Cascorra.

Vol. XLVIII. 39 AN IMPRESSION OF THE KINGS FUNERAL By Mary King Waddington London , Tuesday, May '7  J9,CI- E arrived Sunday night, hay- ing ha l a long crossing in   spite of the smooth sea and blue sky. Almost as soon as we left Calais we got into a fog most curious a belt of low-lying thick white mist and bright sun overhead. It grew thicker as we got near the English coast. Our fog whistle sounded all the time and whenever it stopped we heard others near us most disagreeably near and we just crept along and got to Victoria two hours late. Elsa was waiting for us, but had not been there since five o'clock, as they telephoned the station-master, who said the boat was late owing to the fog, and he would let them know as soon as the train left Do- ver. Hilda s most hospitable house was fill- ing. Her son arrived about an hour after us, having also had a thick fog, and her brother, Maurice, British Ambassador in Spain, was twelve hours late. He was, of course, obliged to come for King Edward s funeral. I found various letters and despatches from the Earl Marshall s office and the French Embassy, saying I would certainly receive an invitation for the funeral service at Windsor, but there seemed to be a doubt for C. s. We started out early Monday morning to walk across the park to the Har- courts , in Berkeley Square, to see if they had been able to do anything about the invitations. Wc found them both just ar- riving from Nuneham, where they had gone to spend a quiet Sunday. He looked tired, as if he had been doing too much. He has a great deal on his shoulders, as all the details of the procession and lying in state pass through his office, and the con- stant changing of plans, inevitable when so many people and so many sovereigns have to be provided for, must be most worry- ing. I wanted very much to see the lying in state at Buckingham Palace. I thought it would say more to me than the official func- 402 tion at Westminster Hall. Besides, I was afraid of the crowd at Westminster. There were to l e no privileges of any kind. Every one must pass in the file dukes and coster- mongers walking side by side. May H. advised me to write to Sir Charles Freder- icks, Master of the Household, and to take the letter myself to the palace. I wrote it at once in her boudoir. They called me a taxi  which are fast replacing the time- honored hansoms  and C. and I drove to the palace. It was Whit-Monday, bank holiday, and there were people everywhere, almost all in black or purple. Scarcely a color to be seen. A silent, respectful crowd was stand- ing around the palace. We first wrote ourselves down for Queen Alexandra, the Empress of Russia, and Queen of Norway, then drove around to the equerries  entrance; found there an old servant who knew me. He said Sir Charles was there  he would take the note up at once. Wc waited a few minutes; many jieople were coming and going. Then the servant re- appeared; said Sir Charles was upstairs and took us up. As we passed through all the rooms and corridors I knew so well and where I had so lately seen King Edward receiving his guests with his charming, courteous manner it seems impossible to realize that that chapter was closed and that we should never see him again. Sir Charles was waiting for us in the gal- lery with one or two English friends, mem- bers of the Household, and took us at once to the Throne Room. The coffin, slightly raised, was standing at one end of the room; an altar behind it with two silver candlesticks; a cross and vases and wreaths of flowers. There were no flowers on the coffin, two wreaths, one on each side, rest- ing against it. The coffin was covered with a white pall, which had been used for Queen Victoria's funeral and had been em- broidered by the ladies of the Royal School of Art of OKI Kensington. It was almost hidden by the Royal Standard draped over it. On the top was the iron crown  the An Impression of the King s Funeral 403 crown of England  from the Tower. On a cushion, lower down, was the King s royal diamond crown garter, sceptre, and orb. The flag of his company of the Grenadier Guard at the foot. At each corner of the coffin stood a Grenadier in full uniform, facing outward. Sir Charles told us it was an old English custom: the soldiers were supposed to guard the coffin from any attack or desecration. They stood pcrfccdy motionless their heads bowed over their muskets as if in silent prayer. Two officers, also in full uniform, stood on , each side of the room at a little distance from the coffin. They are relieved every half-hour; -they began by standing an hour but could not continue it. I can't imagine how they could stand even for half an hour. They are so perfectly still, like statues. It was a wonderful sight the simplic- ity of it so beautiful. No decoration, no black draperies, nor silver stars, nor tapers, nor masses of flowers nothing but the coffin with its flags and crowns. The great King lying there peacefully in his last sleep, guarded by his faithful Grena- diers. It was very quiet; no one but our- selves, one or two English, and an Indian prince. The corps diplomatique had de- filed before the coffin earlier in the day. As we came out we met the relieving squad coming in, marching slowly, their arms reversed and with that peculiar heavy tread of the English slow march. We met more people, all in deep mourning, coming up the stairs and across the court, going, evidently, to have a last look at their King. We went to Marlborough House before we came home to write our names. It is the only house in England to-day where a flag flics top-mast. There were soldiers and royal carriages going in and out. Many people, some foreigners suites probably of the royalties who are arriving every day  were also writing their names. A royal carriage drove out, as we were standing there, with Mr. Roosevelt inside. He only arrived this morning had already been to Buckingham Palace with the corps diplomatique, and had just been received by the King and Queen. We went back to the palacc this  Tues- day  morning to see the procession start for Westminster Hall. We were told to be there before ten o clock, as it would be impossible to cross the lines of troops later. There were people everywhere long black lines perfectly grave and silent; many more were dressed in black, anti all the cab drivers had crape bows on their whips. Wc drove into the court, where a stout policeman immediately stopped us, but the sight of our pass from the Master of the Household made everything right. Troops were already assembling in the court. We were shown at once upstairs, where we found Sir Charles in the gallery. He was in full uniform and was much too busy to attend to us. He gave us in charge of a page  the English royal page always amuses me, as he is usually a stout, bald-headed, middle-aged gentleman , who took us up- stairs to a charming room on the front of the palace, directly over the great gate-way. We heard afterward that it was the sitting- room of King Manuel of Portugal s apart- ment. It was full of heavy, handsome fur- niture  we found some of the chairs diffi- cult to move , and was most carefully ar- ranged, particularly the writing-table with paper, pens, cards, telegraph forms, and pencils of every description. We had some time to wait, but did not mind it. Wc were so interested in seeing the troops pass. All down the mall as far as we could see the road was lined on both sides with Grenadiers. It looked like a long stretch of red walls. Every now and then staff officers in brilliant uniforms and waving white plumes would gallop along betAveen the lines. Sometimes a squad of policemen would cross sometimes a royal carriage and always behind the red wall a dense black crowd surging and wavering when the soldiers backed in U x n them. After wc had been there some little time one of Queen Alexandra s Maids of Honor whom we know very well came in and she showed us a great many people; also bor- rowed a newspaper from one of the pages so that we might see the order of the pro- cession. She was in very deep mourning  a crape veil down to the hem of her dress behind and a long one of chiffon in front and no white anywhere. Our black was perhaps too light plain black cloth but we had understood w e need only wear crape at St. George s Chapel. C., who had only been once before in London, for three days in August, was much interested in every- thing. The Life Guards looked splendid on their big black horses  black devils, as the 404 An Impression of the King s Funeral Egyptians called them when the regiment went to Egypt and the enormous leasts were landed from the steamer . The High- landers and Beefeaters from the Tower made a fine patch of color. A detachment of sailors, in straw hats, drawn up in front of the big gates, looked almost like boys in the midst of the bearskins and helmets of the soldiers. We saw the royal carriages  all scarlet and gold drive in, and one felt the emotion of the crowd when the empty gun-carriage came in and disap- peared inside the gate-way. About eleven o clock a company of Gren- adiers, who had been drawn up just in front of the central gateway, moved for- ward a little and one of the officers came in front holding the colors, which looked very heavy, with both hands straight out in front of him. It is the youngest subaltern in the regiment who has the honor of carrying the flag. He stood motionless for nearly half an hour, and exactly as the clock struck half-past eleven he lowered it in salute, the flag lying on the ground at his feet, and at that moment the gun-car- riage with the coffin and royal emblems and drawn by artillery horses moved slowly out of the big door. It was the same car- riage that had taken Queen Victoria to Windsor. The minute-guns began, the famous bell,  Big Ben,  of Westminster, tolled, and the muflled drums and bag- pipes added their mournful notes. King George, in full admiral's uniform, walked directly behind the coffin between his two oldest sons; a little behind, the Duke of Connaught, looking very handsome and soldierly, with his son, Prince Arthur; then came the King of Denmark and a Russian grand-duke and other foreign princes who had already arrived. After the kings and princes came a brilliant group of equerries, aides-de-camp, and genllemen of the house- hold, all in uniform with decorations. The Grenadier officer who had raised his flag as the gun-carriage passed out of the great gates of the court-yard, lowered it again in salute, and Queen Alexandra s carriage appeared. A splendid equipage, rather like the fairy coach of our childhood, all scarlet and gold, with glass sides and four footmen standing behind. It passed out very slowly. We saw the Queen quite distinctly. She was dressed entirely in crape with the white widow s cap, and we saw her face very well through the veil, which seemed of a lighter crape than the long one behind. She was perfectly com- posed very pale her face looked like a mask, as if she had braced herself for a supreme effort. The Dowager Empress of Russia, Princess Royal  Duchess of Fife , and Princess Victoria were with her. In the second carriage was Queen Mary with two of her children and the Queen of Norway. Then followed five or six state carriages with the other princesses. We waited till the whole procession moved off, hearing the strains of the funeral march in the distance, and as we came downstairs we crossed many people in deep mourning who had evidently been seeing the procession from different rooms in the palace. I felt as if I were in a dream every window was shut one did not hear a sound; and all these black-robed figures moving noiselessly about in the galleries, which I had always seen full of light and flowers and a happy brilliant crowd, seemed unreal. It was a most mel- ancholy impression. Maurice told us the arrival at West- minster Hall was very striking. The great doors opened wide, the Archbishop of Can- terbury, Primate of England, and all the officers of stale waiting to receive the cof- fin. He saw Queen Alexandra quite well; said she looked beautiful as she passed into the hall. I wrent for a drive with Hilda in the after- noon the streets w'ere interesting. All the shop-windows black and stands covered with purple being put up all along the route where the cortege will pass on Fri- day. Black and white and purple draperies hanging everywhere. Royal carriages with red liveries constantly passing as kings and princes are arriving every hour almost. Hyde Park looked like an enormous camp. They are putting up quantities of tents in the park as there is not sufficient accom- modation in London for the immense body of troops that will be assembled the day of the funeral. We dropped C. at a cousin s for tea and wrere glad to go home. C. came in at seven quite pleased, hav- ing  assisted,  as we say in France, at the arrival of the King of Spain. Maurice came in to tea with his sister Marie where C. was, and suggested that they should both come with him to the station where he was An Impression of the King s Funeral 405 obliged to go to receive the King of Spain. They all took themselves off to Victoria where a crowd was waiting outside, the royal carriages and purple carpet on the platform showing that a sovereign was ex- pected. Maurice passed in at once but the young ladies were left in the crowd, when happily a Spanish secretary, who Marie knew, appeared and insisted on their coming inside and taking their stand on the purple carpet. There were only three other ladies the ambassadress and two secretaries  wives I fancy the young man thought it would be a good thing to have a few more people to await his King. In a few moments King George in civilian dress, with his oldest son, the Duke of Corn- wall a little sailor apjjeared on the plat- form; then followed in rapid succession the Duke of Connaught, Princess Henry of Battenberg  mother-in-law of the Span- ish King , and the English gentlemen who are attached to his suite. C. thought King George looked very well and the little sailor quite sweet a round-faced shy English boy but the King told Maurice he was tired  these sad days were also very busy ones there were so many things to be thought of.  The royal train arrived very punctually. The two kings embraced, King Alfonso kissed his mother-in-law's hand, who em- braced him on both cheeks. There was a few minutes  talk and some introductions on the platform and the party drove off  King Alfonso to Kensington Palace where he is staying with Princess Henry of Bat- tenberg. The royal equipages are very smart and well turned out. And the red liveries with the band of crape on the sleev makes a great effect. Thursday, 1 gth May. It is still divine summer weather. Such a blessing for the  jeople who are standing hours in the line to see the public lying-in- state in Westminster Hall. We hear won- derful experiences from some of our friends who waited three or four hours in the crowd, advancing an inch at a time. No one josded, no one was impatient, no one spoke. They say it was an extraordinary sight the line was three miles long. Our young cousins went at six this morning and saw very well. They got back at half- past nine. We could not make up our minds to at- tempt such a fatiguing performance, much as wc wanted to see it, and had given up the idea, when a message came from  Lulu  Harcourt, saying he would take us in by the parliamentary entrance  at the last moment they decided to allow members of Parliament to take in two jxirsons at a time , if we could be at Berkeley Square by half-past ten. We went, of course, and he took us down in his carriage, which passed everywhere. Circulation anywhere near Westminster for private individuals was almost impossible. It was a mag- nificent sight. The doors wide open the catafalque in the middle of the line old hall, which dated from William Rufus, almost over the place where Charles the First heard his death sentence. It is the first time for many years that a British monarch has laid in state publicly, and it was a splendid frame for such a pageant. The catafalque, with the coffin raised much higher than in Buckingham Palace, was a gorgeous bit of color. The high candle- sticks threw down rays of light on the flags, jewelled crown, and royal emblems. All around stood officers in full uniform, their white plumes and scarlet tunics standing out well from the gray walls only one fig- ure quite black in face and uniform, an Indian officer, standing motionless. What was, however, more striking than the coffin, with its brave show of royal pomp and power, was the silent black mass of humanity that flowed into the hall from the upjjcr door dividing as they came near the catafalque into two lines, which framed it in a living wall of mourning. There were all sorts and kinds in the crowd, some quite old men and women, work- ing people, and some cjuite of the upper classes. Some of the women were crying; one or two knelt but were not allowed to remain long by the policc, who gently but firmly urged people on. One quite old woman was holding up a big boy seven or eight years old one saw her  x or thin arms shaking with the burden. The whole floor was carpeted so there was no noise and the impression was extraordinary. I think C. s appreciation was right.  She thought it a wonderful sight and a splen- didly arranged function, but to her there was nothing religious in the scenc. She would never have felt like kneeling and An Impression of the King s Funeral making a prayer whereas, at Buckingham Palace you felt the majesty of death. It was impossible not to kneel before what remained of King Edward. While wc were lingering a moment some one shook hands with me. It was Mon- sieur Camlion, our ambassador, who was piloting the French mission, which had just arrived I couldn't see M. Pichon, but I made out General Dalstein, Military Gov- ernor of Paris a fine, martial figure stand- ing out tall and erect in the crowd. We waited some little time outside  as Harcourt had people to see  and met vari- ous friends. We saw some curious details. A young officer in full uniform, evidently going to replace another on duty, drove up in a brougham. He was bareheaded when he got out of the carriage and was followed by a servant carrying his helmet, which he could not put onin the carriage the plumes are so high. We also heard a nice-looking old couple, from the country, earnestly be- seeching the policeman to let them pass. They had arrived at four in the morning, had had no breakfast, and were exhausted. The man replied that he had not had any breakfast either, but that he could not make any exceptions. We drove about again all the afternoon. The streets are full stands in every di- rection. We inquired at St. George s hos- pital the price of one scat, as we wanted one for our French maid, who is very small and couldn t possibly see anything from the sidewalk. A standing place, not in front, was live guineas, and she would have to be there at seven in the morning, which, of course, was impossible, as she had to dress us both for Windsor. We heard of a balcony at Rumpelmeyers  in St. James Street, where there were places for six peo- ple, for which was paid two hundred guin- eas. I am sure places were to be found easily and quite reasonably on the other side of the park near Paddington, but the difficulty would be to get over. There is one touching popular demon- stration all along the route that the cortege will take to-morrow. Thousands of laurel wreaths made by poor people and sent from all parts of England arc hung on the masts that are on each side of the road straight away to Paddington. One or two ladies have taken charge of the distribution. The wreaths are sent to them and they will see that all arrive. Some have bows of black or purple ribbon; some a little paper tied on evidently an inscription of some kind but we couldn t see from the carriage. We made a final turn in Hyde Park. There are two or three different sets of lents and everybody busy putting up tables, sheds, etc., for kitchens and washing. Wc walked about a little the afternoon was lovely, the red hawthorn in Kensington Garden quite beautiful. We ended at Kensington Palace, as we wanted to write ourselves down for Princess Louise, Duchess of Argylc, and Princess Henry of Battenberg. Royal carriages were standing in the court, sen- tinels at the gate, and three or four enor- mous footmen in very handsome red-and- gold liveries in the hall of Princess Henry s apartment, evidently the King of Spain s servants. We were rather anxious alx ut our cards for St. George s Chapel. Nothing had ar- rived. Mine and Francis s had gone to Paris, and though I had explained it all at the Embassy there was so much confusion at the Earl Marshall s office that mistakes might very well be made. Wc were much pleased when we came in to dinner to find all the cards for the special train at 11.50  seats in St. George s Chapel and invitation to lunch at the Castle in St. George s Hall after the ceremony. Maurice dined with us. He had seen lots of people, including the Emperor of Germany, in the distance. Harcourt told us rather an interesting thing when we saw him just before dinner. They sent him word from the Earl Mar- shall s office this morning that the Ger- man Emperor wished to go to the lying-in- state at Westminster Hall and that they would like him to have the file stopped for an hour, from three to four, so that his Majesty could make his visit quietly and without being crowded. He said he would give no such order that it had always been said that the lying-in-state at West- minster was for the people that every- one must take chance alike. It was the last day. thousands of people were waiting patiently, and he couldn t add another hour t   their weary wait, but that he would ar- range that the German Emperor should make his visits quite easily. The Em- peror understood the situation and wouldn t hear of the file being stopjied, and word was sent to Harcourt that King George and the An Impression of the King s Funeral 407 Emperor would come about three o clock. He met them at the parliamentary entrance and to jk them at once into the hall, a small space there being railed off for the members and their families. The two sovereigns stood a few minutes in the en- closure looking at the streams of people w ho were coming all the time and passing silently and reverently around the cata- falque. Then King George said they would like to go nearer. Harcourt let down the rope and lifted his hand. Instantly the crowd stood still and waited while the two monarchs knelt before the coffin. He said it was most interesting to see the people who were already in the hall. They didn t know' which to look at the dead King ly- ing there in the midst of his people or the two living ones making a last prayer for the one who had  gone before,  having fin- ished his work in this w'orld. When the two came back to the enclosure Harcourt again lifted his hand and the steady, noise- less march past went on. London, Friday, May 20, 1910. Nothing can be imagined more lovely than to-day. Even in the narrow city streets the glimpses of bright blue summer sky, with scarcely a light flake of cloud, tells us that King Edward has his own weather for his last journey to Windsor. The house- hold was early astir. H. and her party arc going to see the procession from the terrace of the German Embassy, and as they have to go some distance round to avoid the troops, they are leaving at seven o clock. C. and I and our ambassador can take it much more easily as the official train leaves Paddington at 11.20. In ordinary circumstances it is only a twenty-minute drive to the station, but to-day, with the vast accumulation of people and soldiers, there may be some difficulty in getting through the lines even with our pass. As we were quite ready we decided to start a little before ten. M. looked splendid in his uniform and grand cordon. It is a pity that collars are suppressed for to-day. He has one beau- tiful one which would have made a great effect. C. and I wore long black cloth dresses; had bands of craj e on the body, crape veils down to the hem of the dress behind and long chiffon veils edged with crape over our faces. We had no difficulty in getting to the sta- tion. Officers and soldiers and big omni- buses filled with soldiers were going the same way. The tents in Hyde Park glis- tened in th: sunlight, and we passed through black walls of people all most grave and quiet. They had certainly been standing there for hours. All the stands along the route were full every one in black. Wre arrived at the station about 10.30 and thought it would be better to take the first train that started. It would always be in- teresting at Windsor. We met Lady Har- court, dressed also in deep mourning, and all went down together. We were not quite sure if our cards would do for an or- dinary train, but M. s tall figure and glit- tering garments smoothed all difficulties. The country looked lovely and all the wray down   cople were seated in the field. Children in clean white pinafores with black ribbons in their hair, or black bows on their straw' hats, were tumbling about on the banks among the daisies and buttercups, w'aiting to see the train pass. Windsor looked magnificent as we came near, w'ith its fine old towers standing up grim and gray against the deep-blue sky. There were many lx ats on the river one or two excursion steamboats filled with people. Evidently many had come down even be- fore us. There were foreign officers walk- ing about on the platform and a very foreign- looking group of twelve or fourteen men in high hats, dress coats, white ties, and tricolored scarfs. We found out that they were the deputation of the Municipal Coun- cil of Paris and Biarritz, who had come over to pay their last respects to the mon- arch they were ahvays so delighted to wel- come to France. Windsor was alive with troops and peo- ple all the windows and balconies filled  every one in black a long line of Grenadiers keeping the road and steep hill up to the castle clear behind them a compact mass of people peering through the very little space between the soldiers who stood al- most shoulder to shoulder. The police passed us through the line and we walked up the hill through the great archway into the court-yard, St. George s Chapel fac- ing us. Already quite a number of people were assembled. They had piled up wreaths and crosses of flowers outside hundreds 408 An Impression of the King s Funeral were sent, and they made a splendid effect of color between the smooth green grass and the old gray walls. Some of our party thought there was too much color, that it looked almost gaudy. I didn t. There was already so much color in the extraordi- nary blue sky and the young green of the trees and grass. It seemed all in keeping, as if Windsor was doing her best to wel- come her King. The chapel looked too beautiful no dec- oration of any kind nothing but the old gray walls and tiers of seats covered with purple velvet running up each side the big nave quite empty to leave room for the procession to pass. There were not many jjeople a few ushers and gentlemen of the household showing every one their seats. We found our places at once in the first section, close to the choir one of the young men of the household, a nephew of Prince Radolin, had charge of them. Wc told him we wanted to go out and walk about a little as we had a long wait, over two hours, and he promised he would keep them. I told him I would complain to his uncle, the ambassador, if he did not take care of us, but he remarked smilingly that the sea was between them he could not do him much harm. The sun was very hot when we went out, but we established our- selves in a shady corner near the entrance, from where we could sec every one who came in. There was a constant move- ment of troops and court carriages, black- robed figures, men in every uniform under the sun the judges a striking group with their black gowns, colored facings, and curly white wigs one jet-black gentleman, his face emerging from the stiff gold-em- broidered collar of his uniform, and people everywhere on the roof, on the grass be- hind the soldiers all quiet and perfectly well behaved. We saw all the diplomatists  heads of the missions  no young ones were invited  come, and then went back to our places about twelve o'clock. The chapel had filled up. Many women in deep mourning and men in uniform had taken their places. The side doors were open the sunlight streaming in over the tops of the trees, but there was no sound of life anywhere. We didn t hear any foot- steps on the thick carpet and the women all looked like phantoms gliding in some quite inside who had places in the choir  some clambering up to their seats her- alds in their gorgeous scarlet-and-gold gar- ments members of the household pages  ushers under masters of ceremonies  all in uniform, standing about seeing that everything was ready. A prominent figure was Sir Walter Parott, organist of St. George s Chapel and a   ersonal friend of King Edward. He dined one night at Windsor when I was staying there. He was dressed in his official robe as doctor of music a white moire gown with crimson facings and collar. W e saw various people we knew. The men in plain black clothes seemed almost conspicuous among all the uniforms. Mr. Picrpont Morgan and some of King Edward s French friends Prince Murat, M. de Bretcuil, Marquis du Lau, and one or two ecclesiastics, were the only ones. Exactly at one o clock the cannon began to fire every minute and the bells to toll. The long procession of the clergy, headed by the Archbishop of Canterbury end- ing with the choristers passed slowly down the nave to the great doors. Every one rose as they passed and the women put down their veils over their faces. Very soon we heard the distant strains of the funeral march coming gradually nearer. There was no other sound except the stamping of the horses  feet and the word of command to the soldiers. Suddenly it stopped there was the dull roll of the muffled drums and the long wailing note of the bagpipes and three or four sharp whistles. I did not understand but C. did, being an admiral s daughter. She said that means the marines arc lifting the coffin from the gun-carriage  their work was done. Then the proces- sion moved up a great number of heralds, gentlemen at arms, officers, and members of the household, some stopping in the aisle and making a wall of color through which the white-robed figures passed, the choristers singing the beautiful words of the burial service,   I am the Resurrection and the Life.  There was no organ nothing but the voices Sir Walter Parott standing in the gallery beating time the tears running down his cheeks. Just in front of the coffin came the Lord Chamberlain and Steward Lord Althorpe and Beauchamp walking backward with their white staves of office in their hands then the coffin, An Impression of the King's Funeral 409 carried by the Grenadiers, the white pall anti the Royal Standard covering it the crown, sceptre, and orb were carried on a cushion behind. Directly after the coffin came King George in full uniform, leading Queen Alexandra by the hand a slight, graceful figure, veiled in crape, her face just visible through the veil, the blue rib- bon of the garter gleaming through the black draperies. Then followed the Ger- man Emperor an erect, soldierly figure, also in uniform leading the dowager Em- press of Russia, looking very like her sis- ter, Queen Alexandra, only not quite so tall. She, loo, was covered with crape and the blue ribbon of the garter. They were the only ladies in the procession. Queen Mary and her children were seated in the royal pew in the choir or inner chapel. Then followed all the kings a stately procession. Some of them, the kings of Denmark, Greece, and Norway, very tall. The two Southern monarchs, Alfonso of Spain and Manuel of Portugal, interesting  one always wonders what their future will be. The King of Portugal looks so young a round child s face a big boy that his mother might still spoil as in a school-room. It was impossible to dis- tinguish all the archdukes and princes w'ho passed and the special envoys. Mr. Roosevelt I sawr quite well in his plain black, but only the head of M. Pichon, our sj ecial envoy. There was not room in the choir for half the procession. The aisle was filled with officers and envoys in every variety of uniform the Chinese in light blue embroidered garments, and a very tall dark man with a long beard and high  X inted cap who looked like an Armenean bishop. I never saw such a splendid effect of color. All the aisle as far as one could see wras a mass of gold and scarlet and light blue ribbons of every bright color  swords and epaulettes shining in the sun- light. It was quite wonderful. We were so near the choir that wre heard every word of the service. What impressed me more than anything else was just at the end after the coffin had been lowered into the vault  and I can t exactly understand why, as I am not English  the Garter King at Arms ad- vanced a few steps and read very slowly and distinctly the proclamation announcing the death of  His most High most Mighty monarch, King Edw'ard VII by the Grace of God  then a pause and he read a second proclamation announcing the ac- cession of King George in the same old- fashioned terms. There was a longer pause. He advanced a few steps saying in a loud clear voice like a clarion   God save the King   the wrords rang through the little chapel and one or two old officers near me were crying quite frankly and wiping awray the big tears. One felt that the people would have liked to respond but they could not the words fell on an open tomb. As soon as the royalties had left the choir we went in. It looked very dark and mysterious, lighted by candles, and black- robed figures still in the stalls, the banners of the knights of St. George hanging over each stall. A silent procession wras passing out past the open vault where the coffin wras. It had been lowered about six feet. I saw it quite plainly nothing on it but the Royal Standard the crown and sceptre  all the emblems of royally taken away. Every one bowed and courtesied as they passed all that was left of their dead King who had done so much for his country dur- ing his short reign not quite ten years. We lingered a few minutes in the side chapel where Prince Eddie is buried. It was filled with flowers as was a tent put up in one of the court-yards. The air was heavy with the scent. We followed the crowd to the castle, going up the big stair- case where Queen Victoria s statute stands and into St. George s and Waterloo Halls, where luncheon had l een prepared for all who had l een invited to the ceremony. Very handsome, with quantities of ser- vants, and everything one could possibly w'ant to eat or drink. The sovereigns, princes, and special envoys were lunching with King George. Of course one saw a great many people. All looked as if they had lost a personal friend. I talked with one or twro of King Edward s special equerries whom one had always seen with him in Paris or Marienbad, and all said the same thing, that his death was sudden and a surprise to every one; also that he met it like a man and so pluckily making a good fight till his breath and heart failed  feeling he had still so much to do. We found our ambassador surrounded by various friends and colleagues. I was glad to see the Duke of Norfolk  Earl Mar- 410 An Impression of the King s Funeral shall  who looked very well in his uniform. I thanked him for all the trouble he had taken about our invitations. He said he was very glad we had received them as they were so overworked at his office it was not possible that some mistakes should not be made. After a short time there was a general departure. The great quadrangle was filled with carriages to take the guests to the station, where special trains were wait- ing which started as soon as all the places were taken. People were still sitting in their places on the stands outside to see the kings and queens start for London. Already there was a difference less ten- sion people were walking about, talking in their ordinary tones quiet always, but not standing in the hush of expectancy, waiting to see their King pass up the hill through the great gates of the castle for the last time. Paris, May 28. I never saw such a magnificent tribute of loyalty as the whole nation paid to their King. For fifteen days he filled the heart and mind of every one. There was no dis- tinction of politics. All were Englishmen and all mourned their great loss. I found a very genuine sympathy when I got back to Paris. At a large dinner I was at  all French  two or three days after I returned there was but one opinion as to his great qualities and of all he had done for his country. And one man, an ambassador, said,  Not only England but the whole world was the better for his reign. His death is an immense loss to France.  He knew the country and the people well and was so wise in his way of dealing with them. Of course his friends were in the Faubourg St. Germain and the clubs, but he knew all the leading men and politicians of the Republican party, appreciated their clever- ness, and always wanted to meet them when he came to France. He knew i er- fectly well that Paris salons and clubs did not represent the opinion of France, and though one could not expect him, as King, to have much sympathy with a republic, he was sympathetic and helpful as a friend, as he knew quite well it was for the in- terests of both countries to be on good terms and to work together. He loved France and all the people loved him and were delighted whenever he came. I always thought he reminded them of their beloved Henri IV. To me, personally, it is a real sorrow. He was a steady friend to me lor forty years never failed me and always did what I asked him when it was possible. So many times I have had some- thing to say to him when he was busy or preoccupied. I had only to say,  May I speak to you, sir, for five minutes,  and in- stantly he gave me his attention and did what he could. One of his great qualities was the courteous, interested way in which he received   eople. Any one at all promi- nent in politics or literature or anything of any class or nationality could always have access to him. He put them at their ease at once and made it not only j ossible but a pleasure to them both. Some people, especially his own subjects, were very frightened of him were too shy to speak or express an opinion. I remem- ber seeing him one evening talking to a lady of high position who was half par- alyzed with shyness. When he moved off he said to me:   I did my best, but I can t make conversation entirely alone when I never get an answer the subject must naturally drop.  I could tell a hundred instances of his kindness and desire to give pleasure. One night at the Foreign Office in London, at a very large, crowded party, I was asked if I could present an American girl to the Prince  as he was then . I did not think it would be easy. The Prince was not well  he had hurt his knee and walked with a cane, and looked tired. He was sitting with a group of royalties and ambassadors, and it did not seem a propitious moment for an introduction. However, I was will- ing to try, particularly as the young lady was a goddaughter of President Lincoln. I said to the United States Minister:  Show me your young lady tell her to stand a little forward and I will see what I can do.  I went back to my placc near the royal group and asked one of the English ladies what she thought. I must say she was most discouraging, but while wc were talking Princess Christian heard a little of what we were saying and asked me what I wanted. I stated my case and said I could not make up my mind to ask the Prince as he looked tired.   I will see what I can do,  she said, and a few minutes later she left her place and went to speak to the An Impression of the King s Funeral 411 Prince. Almost instantly he got up, walk- ing with his cane, and came over to me. ' What do you want me to do, Madame Waddington  Who is your protegde    Not mine, sir. A godchild of President Lincoln, who is in London for a day or two, and whose great desire is to see the Prince of Wales.   Pray, bring her to me.  I made a little sign to the young lady, who was standing on the outskirts of the  circle  notin the least shy. She came forward. I named her, saying she was the godchild of Mr. Lincoln. The Prince shook hands with her talked a few min- utes said she ought to be proud of her godfather, and then added:  Now that you are here you ought to walk about a little and see some of the rooms and the people.   Thank you, very much,  she replied,-looking straight at him with her big blue eyes;   but I don t want to see any- thing else. I only wanted to see the Prince of Wales, and now that I have seen you and talked to you I don t want anything more.  He was much amused and she was quite satisfied. The corps diplomatique were quite aghast at such an unconventional proceeding, and two or three of the col- leagues asked me who the young lady was who had been signalled out for such an honor. The last time I saw King Edward was here just two months ago, when he did me the honor of breakfasting with me on his way through Paris to Biarritz. We were a small party of friends, and my two little grandsons, aged five and three and a half, were of course much excited by the pros- pect of seeing a king. The eldest one is called William after his grandfather, who was for ten years French ambassador at the Court of St. J ames. They were dressed in their white sailor suits and were stand- ing on the wood-box in the anteroom when the King came in. He noticed them at once, asked Willy what his name was and said it was a very honorable name to bear and shook hands with them both. The baby was a little shy and did not speak, but Willy remarked casually,   I take a cold bath now every morning.   Quite right, my boy,  said the King.  You could not do a better thing.  I said:  We have a very good English nurse, sir, who brings them up very hardily and don t let them cry when they arc hurt.  He turned at once to Nanna, who was standing behind her boys, and shook hands with her, saying:  You are quite right, nurse; that is the way to make men of them.  It was one of those spontaneous, kindly things he did that made people love him. He was charm- ing that day; gay, easy, and did not seem preoccupied with the state of politics in England. I took leave of him at the head of the stairs, thanking him for the great pleasure he had given us, and his last words were:  I shall write to the Queen and tell her I have seen you and perhaps you will write to her.  I certainly did not think I should never see him again; and even now. with the sound of the funeral march still in my ears, I can scarcely believe it is true. WHO FOLLOW THE FLAG THE PHI BETA KAPPA POEM, HARVARD, JUNE 30, 1910 BY HENRY VAN DYKE I All day long in the city s canyoncd street, Through a forest of watching folk on either side, I saw a river of marching men, like a tide Flowing after the flag: and the rhythmic heat Of the drums, and the bugles  resonant blare Metred the tramp, tramp, tramp of a myriad feet, While the red-white-and-blue was fluttering everywhere, And the heart of the crowd kept time to a martial air:   O brave fiag, O bright flag, O flag to lead the free  The glory of thy silver stars. Engrailed in blue above the bars Of red for courage, white for truth, Shall bring the world a second youth And draw a countless human host to follow after thee. II Old Cambridge saw thee first unfurled, By Washington s far-reaching hand, To greet, in Seventy-six, the wintry morn Of a new year, and herald to the world Glad tidings from a Western land,  A people and a hoj e new-born. The double cross then filled thine azure field, In token of a spirit loath to yield The breaking ties that lwund thee- to a throne. But not for long thine oriflamme could bear That symbol of an outworn trust in kings. The wind that bore thee out on widening wings Called for a greater sign and all thine own,  A new device that s  oke of heavenly laws And steadfast lights to guide the people s cause. Oh. greatly did they hope, and greatly dare, Who hade the stars in heaven light for them. And set upon their battle-flag a fair, New constellation as a diadem  Along the blood-stained banks of Brandywine The tattered regiments were rallied to this sign; On Saratoga s plain it fluttered bright And jubilant to hail the hard-won fight; O er Yorktown s glorious scene Of victory it flew serene; And when Manhattan saw Who Follow the Flag 413 The last invaders  line of scarlet coats Move down the street, and fill their waiting boats And sullenly withdraw, The Hag that proudly flew' Above the rattling drums anti shrilling pipes, Heading the battered line of buff and blue Along the winding highroad of Broadway, Was this that leads the great parade to-day,  The glorious ensign of the stars and stripes. First of the flags of earth to dare A heraldry so high; First of the flags of earth to bear The blazons of the sky; Long may thy constellation glow. Foretelling happy fate; Wider thy starry circle grow,  And every star a state I III Pass on, pass on, ye Hashing files Of men who march in militant array; Ye thrilling bugles, throbbing drums, Ring out, roll on, and die away; And fade, ye crowds, with the fading day  Around the city s lofty piles Of steel anti stone The lilac veil of dusk is thrown, Entangled full of sparks of fairy light; And the never-silent heart of the city hums To a homeward-turning tune before the night. But far above, on the sky-line s broken height, From all the towrers and dorties outlined In gray and gold along the city s crest, I see the rippling flag still take the wind With a promise of good to come for all mankind. IV O banner of the west. No proud and brief parade, That glorifies a nation s holiday With passing show of troops for warfare dressed, Can rightly measure or display The mighty army thou hast made Loyal to guard thy more than royal sway Of law -defended liberty. Millions have come across the ocean-foam To find beneath thy shelter room to grow, A place to labor and a home; Millions w'ere born beneath thy folds, and know No other flag but thee; Anti other, darker millions bore the yoke Of bondage in thy borders till the voice Of Lincoln spoke, 414 Who Follow the Flag And sent thee forth to set the bondmen free. Rejoice, dear flag, rejoice  Since thou hast proved and passed that bitter strife, Richer thy red with blood of heroes wet, Purer thy white through sacrificial life, Brighter thy loyal blue wherein new stars are set. Thou art become a sign, . Revealed in heaven to speak of things divine: A sign of Truth that dares To slay the lie it sheltered unawares; Of Courage fearless in the fight, Yet ever quick its foemen to forgive; Of Conscience earnest to maintain its right And gladly grant the same to all who live. Thy staff is deeply planted in the fact That nothing can ennoble man Save his own act, And naught can make him worthy to l e free But practice in the school of liberty. The cords that hold thee firm on high Are faith in God supremely wise and just, The only sovereign of the earth and sky; And never-failing trust In human nature, full of faults and flaws, Yet ever-answering to the inward call That bids it set the  ought  above the  'must ; In all its errors wiser than it seems, In all its failures full of generous dreams. Through strife and struggle   rising without pause To self-dominion, charactered in laws That pledge fair-play alike to great and small. And guard the rights of each beneath the rule of all. These are thy halyards, banner bold. And while these hold. Thy brightness from the heavens shall never fall. Thy broadening empire never know decrease,  Thy strength is union and thy glory peace. Look forth across thy widespread lands, Let all thy stars to-night be eyes To see the visionary hosts Of men and women grateful to be thine, That joyfully arise From all thy borders and thy coasts. And follow after thee in endless line  They lift to thee a forest of saluting hands; They hail thee with a far-off ocean roar Of cheers: and as the echo dies. There comes a sweet and moving song Of treble voices from the childish throng That runs to thee from every school-house door. Behold thine army  Here thy power lies. Dear llag: the men whom freedom has made strong. And bound to worship her by willing vows; The women greatened by the joys Of motherhood to rule a happy house; The vigorous girls and boys, Who Follow the Flag 415 Whose eager faces and unclouded brows Foretell the future of a noble race, Rich in the wealth of wisdom and true worth  While millions such as these to thee belong, W'hat foe can do thee wrong, What jealous rival rob thee of thy place Foremost of all the flags of earth  V My vision darkens as the night descends; And through the mystic atmosphere I feel the creeping coldness that portends A change of spirit in my glowing dream. The multitude that moved with song and cheer Has vanished, yet a living stream Flows on and follows still the flag: But silent now, with leaden feet that lag And falter in the deepening gloom,  A weird battalion bringing up the rear. Ah, who are those on whom the vital bloom Of life has withered to the dust of doom; These little pilgrims prematurely worn And l ent as if they l ore the weight of years; These childish faces, pallid and forlorn, Too dull for laughter and too hard for tears  Is this the ghost of that insane crusade That led ten thousand children long ago, A flock of innocents, deceived, betrayed, Yet pressing on through want and woe To meet their fate, faithful and unafraid  Nay, for a million children now Arc marching in the long pathctic line, W'ith weary step and early wrinkled brow; And at their head appears no holy sign Of hope in heaven; For unto them is given No cross to carry, but a cross to drag. Before their strength is ripe their shoulders bear The load of labor, toiling underground In dangerous mines, and breathing heavy air Of crowded shops; their tender lives are bound To service of the whirling, clattering wheels That fill the factories with dust and noise. They are not girls and boys, But little  hands  who blindly, dumbly feed With their own blood the hungry god of Greed. Robbed of their natural joys, And wounded with a scar that never heals, They stumble on with heavy-laden soul, And fall by thousands on the highway lined With little graves, or reach at last their goal Of stunted manhood and embittered age, To brood awhile with dark and troubled mind, Beside the smouldering fire of sullen rage, On Life s unfruitful work and niggard wage. 416 Who Follow the Flag Are these the regiments that Freedom rears And trains to serve her cause in future years   Nay, every life that Avarice doth maim And beggar in the helpless days of youth. Shall surely claim A just revenge, and take it without ruth; And every soul denied the right to grow Beneath the flag, shall be its secret foe. Bow down, dear land, in penitence and shame  Recall thine ancient oath, so nobly sworn, To guard an equal lot For every child within thy borders born: These are thy children whom thou hast forgot  They have the bitter right to live, but not The blessed right to look for happiness. O lift thy liberating hand once more. To loose thy little ones from dark duress; The vital gladness to their hearts restore In healthful lessons and in happy play; And set them free to climb the upward way That leads to self-reliant nobleness. Speak out, beloved country, speak at last. With simple words that all must comprehend, As thou hast s  oken in the past. And clearly say: My power shall defend The coming race on whom my hopes depend: No Moloch of the Market shall despoil Their youth of promise: on my sacred soil No child shall bear the crushing yoke of toil.

Beyond us the great masses of the Cumber- land lay in majestic sleep, and the land agent  H inted to one sweeping depression in its outline:  That s the gap where the Red Fox lived.  Somewhere out there, too, was the Lonesome Pine for as many birth- places, apparently, as Homer had that Lonesome Pine. Many men, engineers, land agents, prospectors, casual travellers,  coming in from the hills had told me where it has stood since a little girl, named June, with hair like the bronze of a wild turkey s wing sat at the base of it, and for the first time looked on the limitless blue waves of moun- tains that she thought must run on and on under the sun to the very end of that world for which she longed. This man had seen it on the crest of the Cumberland, in Dickinson, or wild Buchanan, that man in the lawless Pound; this one at the head of this creek, and that one again in the Crab Orchard on top of The Little Black or lower- ing on the very summit of the Natural Tunnel that was driven through a ridge of lofty cliffs by a little stream of water so that only the track- layer s hand was Vol. XLVIM. 40 needed to build the railroad that runs through. I understand, moreover, that the stranger coming up from Cumberland Gap has that pine pointed out to him through the car window; but as for myself I had heard of it so long ago that I had forgot- ten from whom, and about it I had only a A little jprJ, named June, - . . sat at the base of it Where John Hale was wont lo turn toward Hlark Mountain. vague memory that it lifted itself, if still alive, somewhere in the wilds north-west of the Big Gap that cuts through the Cum- berland here in the south-west corner of Virginia. I had gone down the tortuous rocky way of Hell-fer-Sartain; I had gone up to the very source of Kingdom Come; now 1 was on the trail of the Lonesome Pine. II March was opening gently, and so 1 should see it, as the story puts it,  giving place with sombre dignity to the passing burst of spring.  Past June's boarding- house and John Hale s office my way had led, close to the old shingled school-house where the little girl went to school, and on almost under the shadow of the big beech where was her little play-house. Then into the mouth of the great gap which was bleak, gray, and suffused with misty blue, and on past Calaban s moonshine cabin to a clangv little town whose houses clung like swallow s nests to steep hill- 418 sides where John Hale was wont to turn toward Black Mountain and the pine of dreams. Looking for the real pine, I kept on to another little town where Talt Hall  alias Rufe Tolliver   killed him a police- man." There I swerved to the left of the county seat, where Rufe paid the death penalty for that killing and the Red Fox swung from the same scaffold and turned toward the wilderness of the Pound. A land agent was with me as companion and guide a tall, broad-shouldered fel- low, whose voice was slow and whose face was smooth-shaven and creased with tiny wrinkles of humor that meant a kindly heart. Where, in years gone bv, we had ploughed through mud knee-deep between this town and the county seat, the agent and I ambled comfortably along a mac- adamized road built by the government as an educatory suggestion but only for a few miles; for soon we turned up a lit- tle stream that is called Guest s River, and the road of ages was again ours. Up that sluggish, steep-banked, narrow little On the Trail of the Lonesome Pine 419 stream, past mines and smoking coke-ovens and through cleared bottom-lands to the first sign that it was Saturday afternoon  and the first sign of the chief occupation up that way three men squatted on the roadside, their faces flushed, their eyes stu- pid, and their heads wagging foolishly  moonshine  At the next house the agent stop  ed and rode to the rear of it and back to me again.

To the left of the road two women sat on the porch of a little cabin.   Where's shouted the agent, and one of them cried back cheer- fully:  Oh, up the river thar a-sue kin a bottle as hard as he can suck.  Afcwrodson wc met several boys afoot   all flushed.  They ve been after it" said the agent, who seemed to know everybody personally, though, of course, everybody in the moun- tains says  how-dye-do  to every passer-by. "Don t mind if I give you away   lie asked presently. I knew what he meant, for the mountain community, like all oth- ers, resents being pointed out in print as unusual, or peculiar, and I had already had my troubles.  Not at all.   Well, if you get into trouble, I ll do your lighting for you." I knew he would and on that trip I knew he would have to, for I had long ago given up carrying a pistol: it is useless for the stranger against the odds, one is less apt to get into trouble, and more inclined, as the mountaineers say,  to talk the other fellow out of it.  The agent, too, was unarmed.   I got tired of carrying a gun. No need for it anyhow. I ve always treated these fellows right. I gave them to understand there was to be no trespassing and so forth and they knew I meant it.  From the house on the right a slouch-hatted, middle- aged man showed a rcd-splotched face in the door.  Hello, Sam " It was the l otlle-sucker the woman charac- terized down the road.  Heard you were a little out of humor.  An old woman and two girls appeared and the girls began to giggle.  I reckon I m a-drinkin  myself to death,  said Sam cheerily but weakly. "Can t you do anything with him    No.  said the old woman in a matter- of-fact tone.  He ain t got no sense.   I want to buy that  x plar timber,   the old man wen ton, "ef one o  you men can sell it to me.   Well,'  said the agent,  if you don t stop drinking, you won't need but just enough of it for a coffin.   Now that's the truth,  said the old woman whose face was tolerant, patient, but genuinely concerned, while the girls giggled again the condition of allairs seemed to strike them simply as funny and that was all.  Why, he s been drunk since Christ- mas,  said the agent as we rode on.  And he's full of other poisons than al- cohol. The acid of the beer on the worms makes verdigris; the stuff s not clean and it s new. You can t tell how some of it will affect you." Now I had supposed that moonshining in the mountains was on the wane, and so it is generally: but in that region where local option had cut out competition and the opening of mines had made a flush 420 On the Trail of the Lonesome Pine market the trade seemed to flourish and the trail I followed was slippery with the stuff.  What about the revenue officers   I asked.  Oh, these mountain fellows are too sharp for them. They keep spies out all the time men, women and boys who give signals by hollering, shooting off a gun, or with a horn.  Soon the river separated into three forks, Critical Fork, Devil Fork, and up the third Bear Pen Fork we went through dense dark undergrowth and through thick woods toward Fox Gap in the Big Black Mountains.  A hunter had a fight with a bear up on that spur,  the agent went on, explain- ing the name of the fork.  He was on a scaffold waiting for it. The bear climbed up and got him off and both were found dead the bear shot and pecked up with a tomahawk and the man torn to pieces. He was buried up there and two oaks have grown together over his grave.  Ahead of us were two boys, a big one and a little one, in the road each of them whittling with a wickedly curved knife.  Got any moonshine, Caje   Caje hesitated with a badly concealed glance at me, while the little fellow wormed one bare toe into the dirt.  Oh, he s all right,  said the agent.  I could go back and git it,  said Caje slowly.  Take about twenty minutes.  The agent nodded toward the little fel- low.  The revenue officers got hold of him and his little brother not long ago to keep them from warning the moonshiners; and that little fellow slipped off to one side and let off both barrels of his shot- gun and the still was gone when the rev- enues went up the hollow.  The little rhap looked conscious and we left him still modestly worming his toe in the mud  Caje striding along on foot beside us. By anti by he pulled a very small bottle from his hip-pocket, thinking evidently that we were hard pressed.   I got a little here, sweetened, fer my own use  he said and passed it up. A wet tongue was enough for me. At the bend of the road the young mountaineer turned down a ravine and I reck.,.. I'm a-dnnlciu' myself t  dcaih," said Sam cheerily bui weakly. Page On the Trail of the Lonesome Pine 421 in fifteen minutes we saw him coming back with something under his coat.  What are you going to give him   I asked.  Seventy-five cents,  said the agent decisively.  Oh, give him a dollar anyhow. He walked two miles."  That s nothing-to him.   He'll have to go for more,  I urged.  That s nothing  time and dis- tance mean noth- ing to these fel- lows.  The young fellow pulled a quart lx ttlc from his coat that seemed to be filled with water, and the following formula was now gone through:  If you were over in Kentucky now," said the agent,  and wanted a quart of liquor, how much would you give for it     The moonshiner answered with perfect serious- ness:  This ain t a full quart, but ef it was, I d leave sev- enty-five cents.  The agent drew three quarters from his pocket.  Well, I ain t givin  you anything. I m just goin  to play crack-a-loo with that wag- on track : and forthwith he slowly and skilfully tossed the coins at the rut in the road, the mountainecrwatchinghim without a smile. We left him there standing by the quarters, and once I started to look back.  No use,  said the agent,  he won t pick  em up till we arc out of sight. He can t swear wre gave him the money, we can t swear that he took it and there you are.  On upward we w'ent climbing toilsome- ly and in half an hour we were in Fox Gap, fronting those great still masses of the Cumberland and-the sweeping dip where the Red Fox preacher,  yarb- doctor,  and murderer had housed him- self and planned the deviltries that had removed him to a permanent but doubt- ful home. Ill A castellated bush-covered pile loomed up to our right.   There s a piece of masonry for you,  said the agent, and around it we went and down into the dark- ening cove, amphi- theatrical in shape, densely wooded and steep, with the roll- ing green of a farm far, far down at its feet. From every   ointof the heavens clouds were shoul- dering to thezenith, lightning flashed, and there was a growl of thunder. Blackness capped the cove, rain-drops tapped the leaves, and the horses of their own accord began to hurry.  Did you ever notice that horses travel better just before a storm   I asked.  I have.   Electrical dis- turbance    I reckon not,  drawled the agent.  I reckon you and I would do the same if we were on foot to get something to eat and get out of this storm.  That storm was coming and w'c had no sooner slightly fortified ourselves against it with the moonshine than it burst just as we crossed the North Fork of the Pound. The thunder crashed from as many jKiints as the cannon at Balaklava and the light- ning flashed the world into sight every minute, it seemed, or zigzagged bewilder- ingly above us as though Lucifer was again assailing the celestial heights. The horses got frightened now and in the gloom in front of me the agent s horse went up a bank and down a bank and into a wire fence nearly tearing his rider s slicker 422 On the Trail of the Lonesome Pine from him.  I believe my horse is blind,  he shouted cheerfully, and so I went ahead with but better luck. Literally for an hour we travelled by the Hashes of light-   You ve gol to keep us all night.  The family was just finishing supper, host, hostess, their two small boys and two girls one dark-haired, peach-bloom "That little fellow clipped   tl to one  de and let off both barrels of his shot-gun '  Page 42a ning, going as far as we rould see bv one flash, stopping to wait for another one, and then going ahead again. Meanwhile as a trivial detail the rain was  K uring and the wind swished it this way and that as though cackling witches were slinging wa- ter at us with wet brooms. In time a light glowed far down to the left and no ship- wrecked mariner ever saw a more welcome gleam. At the agent's imperious "hello,  a door opened. in complexion, and comely of figure. The girls were, the hostess said:   My sister s children. Their daddy hung hisself,  she added calmly and aloud. In a moment she was getting our supper ready  corn-bread. fried pork, eggs, and hominy.  Would you mind not turning over one of those eggs   I asked. She looked sur- prised but she did it, and looked at the re- sult critically.  Well, now, they do look better that He slowly acid skilfully tossed the coins ar the nit in the rood Page 431 way.  The host had been ill with fever all spring but he insisted on going out to take care of our horses. Two visitors came  to learn doubtless even in that storm who we were. We sat down to supper and the hostess alone talked, for the girl was demure, shy, helpful, and silent, and what the hostess said chiefly was:  Eat all you can eat all you can.  Not a soul had even heard of the Lonesome Pine. After supper 1 took another dram of the moonshine to help dry out my clothes and the agent was right; nobody could tell just what the stuff would do to him. Ten minutes later I stepped out of the house with the agent and reeled into his arms, deathly sick, and I went at once to bed. I was up at daylight all right again, to the same breakfast and the same hospitable cry  eat all you can. eat all you can.  Formality had passed and anybody who pleased said his say. Even the dark, demure one stolidly told her story:  I found him a-hangin  to a rafter  bout eight year ago. He got a ro  e one day and we seed him always a-stretchin  it. One mornin  he told us to go on with breakfast an  he d be back in a minute. I went out to look for him an  he d climbed up on a rafter an  jumped off.   Deranged,  said the hostess, and I wondered how often the girl had told the story, for she seemed to take a placid, grewsome satisfaction in the importance with which the incident had clothed her. There was no sadness that forbade a change of subject.  Any amusements around here   I asked.  Might  nigh none.  said the hostess.  The boys gits drunk an  the gals git married too early.   How early    Fifteen, fourteen, thirteen.   My sister married at seventeen,  said the demure one.  How old are you    Seventeen."   How did you escape     Her first smile came.   Reckon I had better sense.   I tell her not to marry at all,  broke in the hostess.  If a gal s got a good home an  can stay there an  be a good gal, she s better off. She don t know 423 424 On the Trail of the Lonesome Pine what trouble an  worries she gits into, black-haired mountaineer, ever heard of gittin  married.  And there you are  it, but he had known the Red Fox well even out in the wilderness of the Pound and had helped him dig into the Indian is the familiar out-in-the-world view. chief's grave in the little gap abo e is "He could see a rtv a  n x  ihc valley thar wtlh that  lass.   Page 425.   She doesn t care when she falls in love,  I said, which I had heard somewhere be- fore, and the girl flushed faintly.  That s so,  she said. Soon we were in the saddle again going up Phillip s Creek over a ridge and down a steep mountain toward Indian Grave Gap, one of the fabled homes of the Lone- some Pine. There was a lonesome cove down there and a lonesome cabin, but there was no towering pine anywhere, nor had the occupant of that cabin, a typical cabin. With him leading the way and his three boys following we were soon sitting on the heap of stones that mark the rest- ing-place of the dead brave.   The Red Fox seed visions you know.  said the mountaineer,  an  he tol  me that the s ierit of a Injun stepped from behind that tree thar an  tol  him thar was a peck o  gold down in that thar grave. He said he d guarantee it an  I shorely believed the gold was thar: an  I went to diggin , the Red Fox chiefly a-watchin  me. I found On the Trail of the Lonesome Pine 425 a pipe a pcace-makin  pipe, the Red Fox callcd it: and ihen I come to a big flat rock that I couldn't budge, so I stopped an  the Red Fox didn t go on. That was thirty year ago, an  I al'ays meant to git under that rock an  I ll do it yit when I git the time.  The agent winked, for if there was one commodity that was drugging that mountaineer s mar- ket it was time. Now. as a member of a volun- teer police guard over at the Gap 1 had had the dubious pleasure of assisting at the last obse- quies of the Red Fox on a  raised platform over which a noose dangled, and this talk was of in- terest. "Yes, I know d him mighty well. I used to go  round with him an  his big spy-glass a good deal. He could see a fly across the valley thar with that glass. Why, alter he killed them par- ties you fellers hung him fer, he tol' me he was a-settin  up on the moun- tain watchin' the folks a-layin   em out an  a-countin  the bullet-holes he had put through  em. I nuver heerd him say nothin  about no Lonesome Pine, hut ef thar s anybody who knows whar it is, hit s Uncle Hosey Bowlin.  The agent looked up interested, and it developed that Uncle Hosea was an old man of whom I had often heard who, up in the nineties in age, yet walked to and fro fifteen miles to his county court and would hold a horseman in a jog-trot to keep up with him.  Uncle Hosey was a-runnin  a ole feller fer the grave a long while ago. This ole feller dug his own coffin from a poplar log and kept hit in his house for four years. Wien anybody come in to see him, he would git in, fold his hands, and close his eyes:   How d I look   he says.   All right,  I says  fits fine.  Atter four years he went under in that thar coffin and left Uncle Hosey above ground.  The agent broke in suddenly:  When was your boy killed    Three year ago.  The mountaineer s face showed no surprise at the question  no emotion whatever.  Who killed him   There was a glint in the eye now, a tightening of the lips, and two of his boys moved slightly.  Vanover.   What for    Don t know. Jus  got hit inter his head an  follered him up till he done it He lived right thar in that house with me fer two year and I thought him an  my boy was  as good friends as could be. I chased him toward Jackson an  passed him in the night.  Trying to arrest him   I asked.  Alive or dead,  said the agent.  Ruther dead,  said the mountaineer.  I meant to open on  em both t other feller was helpin  him git away. They was two to one but I didn t figger on that. I d as soon git t other feller as Vanover fer helpin  him git away. Both left the country but I hear he s back here now an  then. But I know hit s a blind to keep me from knowin  jus  whar he is.  So this mountaineer had his tragedy and the seeds of a feud were right there ready to sprout, for his boys were drinking in a spirit of revenge which showed in all, apparently strange to say without a sign of heat.  The Red Fox was a peaceable citizen for a long while,  the mountaineer said as we were leaving,  but he got to totin  a gun an  keepin  bad company.  And as we rode away:  I hear as how Uncle Hosey is ailin  some.  The agent nodded back over his shoulder:  He pays five dollars a year for the rent of a thousand acres, and I ve collected three dollars in four years, but it s a good thing to have a tenant here even for noth- ing it keeps people from cutting timber and trespassing.  " I just stepped home.   Page 4 426 On the Trail of the Lonesome Pine On the way the agent halted to make S  icech with a patriarch whom he tailed Uncle Tommie and who was languidly hanging over a fence. Uncle Tommie, too. had never heard of the Lonesome Pine.  'I ell us about that light,  said the agent. Uncle Tommie looked sheepish, but in spite of the agent s wink to me he started bravely:   Well, I went up to Bill s to git some leggin s. I tuk a dram or two and Bill said somethin  an  I up and knocked him down with a c hair." Uncle Tommie stopped and, catching the drift of the agent's wink, I asked:  What did he do    Got his gun hut i tuk it away from him. I'd V emptied it into him if it had been loaded.   Did nobody else interfere    Oh. yes, In's boy stabbed me in the wrist with a jack knife.   What did you do to him    Nothin  didn t pay no attention to him. I just stepped home.  We rode on -theagent laughing silently, and presendy he turned in his saddle: " Uncle Tommie came back from that fight and said he had left his leggin s. I said 1 would go for them, and Uncle Tom- mie jwked his head out of the door and veiled after me:  I left ray hat thar too.  An' he just stepped home  He will be telling that story that way as long as he lives.  Winding up a creek for an hour, we came u M n a log-house drowsing under apple-boughs, and there on the    rch was seated Uncle Hosea with his son, his grandson, a handsome chap, and a neigh- bor. From all we got a hearty welcome. Uncle Hosey's head was bald on top But long white locks hung down on either side. His eyes were bright blue, his face was mobile and smooth shaven, and he was per- fectly toothless. lie was spirited and hu- morous. His brow was broad, he had a better accent and used better language than the average mountaineer, and he knew what was going on in the world. He was the It wa-. un txji of the niotniiaiii."

His father had settled near there in 1795, and he himself had killed deer, panther, bear, wild-cat and had trapped beaver. He had never used tobacco but he drank   all he could git.  Uncle Hosea admitted this, he said, to a tem  erance advocate once:   The temperance feller said,  Yes,   quoted Uncle Hosea,    an  if you hadn t  a  drunk nothin , you would have had to be shot on Judgment Day.    Thereupon the agent pulled a pint of moonshine and Uncle Hosea s eyes sparkled. Having no teeth he put his tongue into the neck of the bottle and withdrew it, guiding the liquor down his throat. Then how his our ages at the same time then an  he was only four years older than me then, an  I reckon 1 been agin  as fast as him since." Then his grave-faced son took up the cud- gels:   I seen that old man four different times an  each time he jumped his age from six to ten years."  An  I tell you,  chimed in Uncle Ho- sea,  hundred-yearlings are skase.  I approached the issue now with gen- uine concern had Uncle Hosea ever heard of the Lonesome Pine  The old man s brow wrinkled doubtfully and my heart fell and rose as the brow grew smooth again. 428 On the Trail of the Lonesome Pine  I nuvcr heerd o  no Lonesome Pine, hut I knowed a tree that old hunters usen to call the Lone Pine sixty year ago.  That was close enough for me I had run that pine to earth at last. It was on top of the mountain, Uncle Hosea said, at the head of a little branch, and stood at the foot of some great cliffs right on the State line. Uncle Hosea had once been hunting with his father and their ilog had trailed a bear to a cave near the foot of the pine.    Take holt o' that dog,  pap said,  an  I ketched him by the scruff of the neck. Pap put his gun into the hole an  whistled. The ole bear riz up and pap shot her through the head. We dragged her out an' she had a cub not much big- ger n a gray squirrel. We toted it home and mother put the little feller to her breast an' nussed it. Mother had nussed wolves an  fawns an  most everything, an  she said that little cub put his paws on her breast an  nussed gentler than wolf, fawn, or any baby she d ever had.  It was good to know that the trail of the pine led hack to pioneer days and it was almost uncanny to be talking with a man who had lived them. Sud- denly his son turned his keen eyes full on me.   Didn t I see you guardin  Talt Hall     Hall was the Rufe Tolliver of the story  and at his last obsequies, too, I had as- sisted.  I was there,  I said a little uneasily.  I remcmljer ye. Talt wasn t half as bad as he was painted.  I let it go at that and put no further shadow on the memory of the deceased.   I was at the county seat once when you fellers was guardin  Talt,  he went on.  an  some dogs chased a cat into the jail. The guards thought the Kaintuck- ians was cornin' an  they was skeered to death. I seed the Red Fox go plumb un- der a bed.  That incident I did not recall but I expressed no doubt of the truth of it and went back to the Lonesome Pine. I would never be able to find it alone, said Uncle Hosea. I wouldn t know it if I saw it, and nobody but Uncle Hosea knew where it was. It was too bad but we had to give up the search then and there; for as the mountaineer who had dug for the bones of the Ind- ian chief said:  Uncle Hosey was ailin .  IV Two months later I took that weary trail again and the artist who draws these pict- ures was with me himself bound also for Hell-fer-Sar- tain and Kingdom Come. We started early one May morn- ing and went miles through snowy dog-wood. For dinner we pulled up at a cabin that had an atmosphere of its own. There were pansy beds and other non-mountain flowers in the yard. The porch was clean, the floor through the open door showed freshly scrubbed, everything was neat as a pin and no company was expected. Then a girl ap- peared  and it was June  She wasn't quite as pretty, of course, and her hair hadn t exactly the bronze on a wild turkey's wing, but she was as keen, alert, and intelligent and she showed such a disturbing conception of her   oint of view and of my own that I could not make out which she thought was the more humorous. Dinner was ready and, as we were taking j ot-luck. she was apologetic:  I m afraid this is the kind of a dinner you describe in your book.  she said de- murely, anil I almost gasped. But it wasn t that kind of a dinner and the girl knew it, and for Hale s sake I hope that June turned out even half so good a cook. Our young hostess had never been out in the world, she said, but she seemed to know it pretty well through her lx oks which she had read with profit not only to her mind but to her speech which was clean-cut and at times startlingly ixtlysvllabic. After din- ner the artist took snap-shots of her with his camera, and when he wanted to take her The old farmer complained that hi  breeches were rasped. l age 429. Revelation 429 father as well, the old farmer complained that his breeches were ragged and that he wasn't  fixed.   Oh, go  long   said the girl,  that s just the way they want you.  The artist was distinctly impressed:  I thought you were drawing the long how about June in that book,  he said, as he rode away.   I had no idea that so near the real thing could be alive.  It was curious, but all the way, on the previous trip, I had met scores of men and boys in the road and now we scarcely saw one. There was another reason for the apparent depopulation than the fact that it was not Saturday afternoon. The reve- nue officers had made a raid up that way since I had travelled it, had destroyed half a dozen moonshine stills, and had captured a dozen prisoners, so that perhaps the good- natured moonshine friend with whom the land agent had played crack-a-loo in the road was now playing the same game with a comrade in a prison cell but I hope not. One would never have known that there was a drop of moonshine or a moonshiner in the world on that trip, and while we saw no moonshiners we were doubtless seen and watched by many from the bushes. Late in the afternoon we found Uncle Hosea under his apple-boughs, comfortable, well-cared-for, but still ailing and genu- inely distressed that he was yet unable to take us where we w'anted to go. Once more, then, I had to turn back on the trail of the Lonesome Pine. I am still waiting for Uncle Hosea to improve, and if he ever gets strong enough, I shall strike that trail again. It may be, however, that the pine which lives only in the memory of that one old man will, as far as any man can know, die with him. But though no mortal eye may see and know it again, may it still stand,  catching the last light of sunset, clean-cut against the afterglow, and guarding the pass under the moon  green among dying autumn leaves, green in the gray of winter trees, and still green in its shroud of snow a changeless prom- ise that the earth must wake to life again.

In its centre a large figure, built up in red clay on a rude framework of timber, rose toward the dingy skylight. About this figure swarmed a number of young people in bedraggled blouses; and in front of it the genius of the place, also in a blouse, worked a bit of wet earth be- tween thumb and forefinger as he explained his conception to a little knot of visitors. "It will stand in a niche, perhaps. Or within a doorway. Or lietween a pair of Doric columns. Miss FreHnghuysen, won t you please take that last cloth off the fore- head   And, Simcox, you might put another handful of clay on that wooden elbow.   43  A large, stout girl ran up a short step- ladder, stripped off a soaked brown cloth, and dropped it upon a pile of others that already stained the floor. At the same time a lithe young man perched for an instant, Mercury-wise, on a comer of the castered platform and clapped a pound or two of red clay over the only part of the framework that still protruded.  There; that s better,  declared the sculptor. And the figure, with the last of its beauties unveiled and the worst of its defects temporarily corrected, stood forth for the consideration of the callers.   Kolos-sal   exclaimed one of the party, clasping his hands and drawing in his breath. He was blond, ingenuous, foreign- looking a young German baron who had landed only the day before and who had been hurried at once to view the newest prodigies in American art.  Overwhelming   murmured the lady   Silence   431 who had brought him. working her ample bosom and quieting down a tendency to wave a black lace parasol.   Pyrami-dal lM pronounced a bohemian confrere from the floor below, a leisured painter who had led up the matron and her party from his own quarters. He threw his slight figure into a stiff pose, placed his forearm across his mouth and nose, and looked out, with an effect of stern sad- ness, at this first large rough presentation of hisfriend sidea. The figure itself was in the same posture and promised to speak the last word in the  sim- plified.  It was en- veloped from crown to heels in a single large and seamless piece of drapery. Brow, breast, arms, feet all save the heavily shadowed and inscrutable eyes  were wrapped as in a solemn winding- sheet.   Qa ira ; oh, most decidedly   cried the painter, with vivacity.   Vincent, my dear fellow, I con- gratulate you    Ach   said the young German,  I  Pyramidali see those columns; he is withdrawing through them to the tomb.   Hail und farewell   he says, before leaving us for   that undiscovered country toward whose bourne toward whose bourne    He turned for help to a young woman in a black-plumed hat a hat like a catafalque.  Toward whose bourne each mortal must depart,  breathed the young woman with rhythmical obsequiousness.  Bravo   cried th'c guide, dropping his pose, clapping his lean hands, and giving the improvisatricc a sudden smile. The sculptor shuffled his feet.  At present,  he said,  we offer you little more than life-size. Whether we ever reach the really heroic or the colossal de- pends, of course, on-  There was a sudden sharp jingle behind a green burlap curtain.   Miss Foster, won t you see what the telephone wants  Depends, of course,  he resumed,  on fortune and cir- cumstance. Well       It s the Girls  In- dustrial Club, over in Passaic,  reported Miss Foster, remov- ing a smear from the receiver.  If they can choose between  Modern French Sculpture  and1 Don- atello s Contempo- raries, they ll take the French Sculpture.    Very well. Will someone please make a note of it  Satur- day, at eight-fifteen. Simcox, you ll see about the slides   The young German still stood entranced.   He pauses for a mo- ment within that dark doorway a yawning portal which is soon to schwallow him op. And l efore he yields this pleasing, anxious being to to decay  he he-    Leaves the warm pre- cincts of this cheer- ful shop And casts a longing, lin- gering look our way,  completed the painter, with a triumphant glance at his rival in the poetical art. The outer door opened suddenly, and a shabby boy in an official cap entered with little ceremony.   Vincent    he called, ex- tending a thumb-marked envelope.   Here,  said the sculptor.   Put it on my desk, Miss Frelinghuysen. I suppose it s about that special meeting of the Art Commission I believe I am to speak.  He returned to the figure.   Columns and a doorway yes, I think I favor that idea, myself. Really, I need the help of your imagination. To ask you to judge of my design without accessories, without space pronounccd a bohemiam confrere. 432   Silence   and perspective, and from an undersized, half-finished sketch I'm not sure I ought to have let you see it at all   he declared, with a sudden frank compunction.  If this is only an undersized sketch    cried the painter.   I jumped straight from that,  said the other, indicating a tiny figure, scarcely more than afoot high.   I have full faith in the idea,  he added gravely.   Yes, you have your idea, and you have your sketch. But  drawing a step nearer his friend    have you your  your  patron    Vincent shrugged  an eloquent, depre- catory No.  Ah  waiting for the right man to die     the other went on incorrigibly. Miss Frelinghuysen per- formed a compli- cated grimace. It contrived to convey reproof.   He must be some one who was good und great und dis- tinguished,  began the young German, with a serious elo- quence.   Some one who has noply ended a nople career-   Thank you,  said the sculptor grate- fully.   Yes,  chimed in the painter,   we must have some one who was fully worthy; some one who appreciated art and was fired with a high ambition to have his name and fame handsomely perpetuated in enduring mar- ble-    Or granite,  said the elder lady.   Or bronze,  suggested the younger.   Or gold and ivory,  amended the paint- er, suddenly veering from his earlier notion.   Marple, marple,  said the German baron seriously. "Bronze   insisted the younger lady, setting aside her deference and bobbing her catafalque:   the dark mystery of the great Beyond.   Granite   insisted the elder, again struggling to control her parasol:  the utter inexorableness of Fate.   Gold and ivory   began the paint- er, throwing out his arms to compass a chryselephantine hugeness. But he saw his friend s face, and stopped. There came a knock at the door. Vincent was glad to answer it in person.  I m sorry to trouble you,  said a penetrating female voice,  but I won- der if Bertie Foster would lend me her alcohol lamp. I m trying to have a tea, and the janitor s wife has cleaned me up till I can t find a thing-  Meanwhile the young students con- tinued to swarm about the figure. One filled in the du- bious area around its feet; another tooled some technique into the robe; a third fid- dled over the thumb. None but the master himself might touch the eyes, the forehead, the great fold of drapery above it for here resided, poten- tially, all the mystery and solemnity tow- ard which the whole collective endeavor moved. Vincent, returned from his needy neighbor, sent a homing glance toward that most significant passage in his creation.   Going or returning,  he said, with a smile,   our friend will speak no word.   So stark  So mute   intoned the ma- tron, embroiling her gloves over the handle of her parasol.   So much to be told us   murmured the young lady of the plumes.   Yet not one word of warning, of consolation     Silence " 433  He is in inhibited,  pronounced the young German scientifically.   But that he is forbid, he could a-   Indeed he could   cried the painter, with a mock shudder. Another knock at the door, an address that was humble yet urgent. Miss Foster, who opened this time, gave the visitors a glimpse of a tangle of black hair above an anxious, middle-aged face.  Can we use the  Count  to-mor- row   she asked Vincent, in behalf of a dependent who pos- sessed nothing in the world besides an in- valid wife, four chil- dren, and an admi- rable torso.  No; some time next week,  replied Vincent. But the anxious face refused to retire, and the voice persisted in a broken jargon vibrant with entreaty: the need of an   advance   was in the air.   You ll find a dollar in the third left-hand drawer,  murmured the sculp- tor to his assistant. Before the door could be finally closed, a soprano voice, some distance down the corridor, rushed through a rapid chatter of words, to the accompaniment of a vigorous galopade on a piano, toward an  effective  finale:   'Adieu done pour loujours, adieu done pour toujours .... Pour- oh-jours       Miss Foster shut out at once the forlorn model and a smart patter of-obligatory ap- plause. Now came a little volley of obser- vations from the painter s small party all in that general tone of rdsume which her- alds a departure.  So deep    So mysterious    So sublime and so cruel   A second volley the scattering fusillade of courtesy.   That nymph is charming.   That bust really possesses character.   That group is most ably, admirably composed.  A third volley   taps.   We have enjoyed these few moments so much.   This has indeed been a precious priv- ilege.   Wc have already encroached too long on your valuable time.  The party moved toward the door. One backward glance, by way of parting trib- ute, toward the new work which had brought them there.  It is a grand thought. It is worthy of a fine title. How   their guide s hand was almost on the door-knob   how do you intend to call it   The artist smiled wanly.  Its name,  he said,  is   Silence.   II Horatio Vincent, at the age of thirty- five, was just coming into his own. He had passed through the period of portrait busts and park fountains and soldiers  monuments to expand in the larger and fairer realm of the ideal. All his more recent subjects exacted the homage of capital letters. His attention went to such big concerns as Fate, Humanity, the Soul; and the latest of his doings dealt, as has been seen, with the Mystery of Death and Futurity. In most cases labor had been its own reward; but once or twice some con- ception of his, not having been too utterly lofty and vague, had produced  practical  results. And he was hoping that this  Si- lence  might do the same.  Here s a column of w ... about somebody who has just died of apoplexy at the Ho- tel Gotham.   Page 434. 434   Silence   Gertrude Plant was hoping along with him. No, Gertrude was not the young woman under the catafalque; that bird of passage had never appeared before and never appeared again. Gertrude did not at all run to ostrich plumes. She habited her- self in a compromise between  dress re- form   and   art nouveau,  and went in for cool grays and sad browns and exotic em- broideries. Miss Frelinghuysen and Miss Foster and the other girls would look her over covertly yet carefully whenever she came in which was twice or thrice a month to see how the Great Ideas were getting along. Sometimes they quizzed, and sometimes they copied. But they all understood that Gertrude s hopes were paramount to her clothes, and that the clinching of a single big commission would bring to fruition the fondest hopes of two faithful hearts. Let but the Silence be broken by the scratching of a pen. busy over a big check, and Felicity would turn her face toward both. Yes. they were all waiting, as happy-go- lucky Templeton had so bluntly intimated, for the right man to die. Miss Frelinghuysen kept the death- masks and read the obituaries. During the past fortnight she had been reading assidu- ously, for the  Silence  had been cast in plaster and was now not only ready to look at but was also ready for the bronze-founder or the marble-cutter. She was running over the moming paper when Gertrude Plant dropped in to view the figure in its latest stage.  Faugh   exclaimed Miss Frelinghuy- sen;  how the rich cling to life   She turned the leaf.  Here s a column or so, however, about somebody who has just died of apoplexy at the Hotel Gotham. He s from Kentucky.  Reuben H. Mc- Entee, of Lexington, the well-known stock- breeder and turfman. . . . Owner of Leonie K., 2.03J. . . . Prominent on the Eastern circuit. . . .  Well  with a dep- recatory glance toward her chief  this is hardly work.  Miss Frelinghuysen de- scended from her stepladder, threw away her Times, and luml ered over to a  This- tledown   which represented a private spec- ulation of her own. While Alicia Frelinghuysen went on with her problem of communicating an airy elfin abandon to so many pounds of plastina, Vincent and Gertrude, standing side by side, were taking a long look together at their  Silence.  They saw it, greatly en- larged, dominating a long stately avenue of tombs and funereal cypresses. A band played a dirge; a multitude bowed in hushed and reverent awe; and an im- passioned orator recalled the gifts, graces, and services of some great j ersonage who had lafely passed into the Shadow. Nor were the gifts and graces of the artist ig- nored as they so frequently are.   In this magnificent statue,  our pair heard the orator shout,   we have the very incarna- tion of the mystery of life and death. Rich in honors and achievements, our dear friend and leader has passed into the be- yond. To-day he knows but may not speak. . . . Ah, would that those lips might be unsealed, that those eyes, dark with mysterious Knowledge .... But the dread reign of silence remains unbroken. ...     Neither of the pair gave one thought to Reuben H. McEntee; yet a month later the executors of Reuben H. McEntee stood in Vincent s studio. The one was a banker; the other was a prosperous tobacco-grower. Miss Freling- huysen found the first lank, and the second pudgy; neither, as she muttered disdain- fully, was at all   sculpturesque.  Nor did either know anything about art; and each took a jovial satisfaction in the fact that the other was as ignorant as himself. The will of their dead friend had devoted toward the fit monumental marking of his grave a sum that might amount to some twenty thou- sand dollars; and the responsible spenders of so considerable a fund might well recon- cile themselves to their ignorance of graven images. Vincent set his jaw and went to work on them. He would have preferred to im- mortalize a different kind of eminence. He blew up his figure to all sizes; he provided it with all sorts of backgrounds and acces- sories; he hinted at the co-operation of architects and of landscape-gardeners; in indignant declaration, he worked his hands, his smile, his shoulders, his whole vibrating aura. But all to small purpose: these two hard-headed business men cast over every- thing the pall of a jocular doubt. The figure l efore them seemed singularly bald and bleak. W'here was its anatomy  all wrapped up in a big blanket. Where were   Silence " 435 the folds of this blanket   absent, though surely the funds at their disposal ought to sccurc a fair number of creases and ridges. Was any one statue enough  Might they not be expccted to provide something with a statue on each comer  They began to hint about a granite contractor, in I,ouis- whom this glorious creation was to be ded- icated. They saw a long, lean figure in black broadcloth and a slouch hat; he wore a goatee, and had a cigar stuck offensively in one comer of his mouth. Stop-watch in hand, he stood high up, with others of his kind, in a gaudy little pavilion. Th  one was a banker: the other was a prosperous tobacco-ijrower Page 4 4. villc, who would do them a fair-sized tem- ple, with several effigies of suitable charac- ter, for eight thousand dollars or so. Vin- cent s intimation that he might expect twelve or fifteen came to them with a dis- tinct shock. He had stood up to them less from a desire for their distinguished patronage than from a determination to defend his precious Idea.   I don t much care,  he said to Gertrude Plant, in describing this first interview,  'whether they take it or not. I almost hope they won t. In fact, if it wasn t for you, dear girl ...  Just as they had contemplated together the unveiling of the   Silence   itself, so now they co-operated in a vision of the man to the master of hippie revels. Then they took off his long coat though they left him the cigar and sent him flying round the track in his shirt-sleeves, behind some two-year-old harnessed to a  sulky  . . .  Odious   exclaimed Gertrude Plant.  Thank heaven, wc have never had to have him here     If we had never had to have those others, either   returned Vincent. He waved off the Kentuckians with a gesture of tragic protest. How could they be expected to appreciate such a triumph of severe selection, of studied simplifica- tion   How could they understand that, by very virtue of this simplified severity, his tomb would detach itself from all other 436   Silence   tombs, would infallibly focus upon itself the attention of ever   spectator, learned or simple  As was she of Melos among Venuses, so would be this monument among monuments. But those barbarians had gone on in a loud, off-hand way, and they had gone out in a loud, off-hand way. They would think it over; they would take coun- sel; they would enlist the services of some competent critic, if one, by good chance, were found. . . .   Oh, I have had  competent critics    Vincent declared to his Gertrude.   They come from stone-yards; they do notices for   art journals  you never heard of in all your life; they-  u Hush, dear   said Gertrude. What in- dignity, what humiliation he was undergo- ing and all for her sake  And now the ground being cleared for her own activities  she launched out upon a comprehensive review of the multiplied crudities and in- eptitudes and downright asininities with which her long haunting of this and other studios had stocked her memory. Vincent glowed; and together they condemned Mr. Bird Hascomb, of the Stockbreeders  Na- tional Bank, to the lowest circle of art s inferno. But Mr. Hascomb saved himself for a time, at least. It occurred to him to carry his problem to the vice-president of the metropolitan bank with which his own bank was in correspondence, and this per- son, by some happy chance, was also a director of the Art Museum. Well, Alonzo Wetherington Wrygant ac- companied Hascomb and his coadjutor to the studio. The  Silence  now stood before a provisional background which suggested more or less successfully the architectural possibilities of the scheme. Wygant was immediately and eloquently in Vincent s favor. He was in the artistic swim; he always joined joyfully in the dernier cri; he was ever ready to take the last excesses of any contemporary art move- ment without blinking an eyelash.  Why, Hascomb  Why, Prickett   he cried, llouncing his bushy side-whiskers and twirling his evc-glasses,  this is the very thing you want  Seize it at once  What has delayed you   What have you been thinking of   Nymphs with each curl accounted for  Angels with every feather numbered and certified  Faiths and Hopes with polished bracelets and undercut lin- gerie  I trust not  I trust not, indeed  Why, this grand, noble, simple, self-ex- planatory thing would reflect the greatest c redit on your dead friend and on your own artistic taste. Here we have a clear and direct and straightforward presentation of one of the great rock-resting fundamentals of human existence. Nothing frivolous; nothing superfluous; all bespeaks a grim majesty that no word of mine ...  Despite the ncedlessness of his own words, Mr. Wygant went on improvising with charming fluency for ten minutes more. The two visitors from Kentucky were impressed, and almost convinced. Wygant, on leaving, whispered a word in Vincent s ear.  Make it fifteen, at least; people respect only what they pay for." W vgant dealt habitually in large figures  for him twice fifteen would have been a bagatelle. Vincent resolved to summon all his force and to compel his halting tongue to name Wygant s figure. A week later, the figure had been named, and the executors, though with some mis- givings, had tentatively accepted the artist s idea. Ill A month passed and the matter still re- mained more or less open. An architect had been called in and had proved himself fluent. A landscape-gardener had been summoned and had shown himself elo- quent. Each had his idea. The architect wished to subordinate the figure to an ex- tensive monument; and the landscape-gar- dener desired to engulf the monument in a vast park. They had to be reminded that even the most extensive cemetery-lot is not boundless. It was Mrs. Shurtleff who told them so. Mrs. Shurtleff came from Kentucky. She was a firm-faced woman of fifty-five. For years she had been Mr. McEntee's housekee  er, and she was down in his will for a good big sum a disproportionate one, as others of the heirs felt. She had done much to lift the burden of loneliness that had afflicted her employer s last years; and now and again her housewifely arts had agreeably made good the shortcomings of Saratoga and Sheepshead Bay. If there was to be a monument, she must have something to say about it.   Silence " 137 She had come a long way, and she had not come to remain silent. Her cue was that of a high expressiveness. She felt, in fact, the cloaked presence of Dubiety. She had no idea of presenting a simple front through whose few rectangular doors and windows any one might gaze into the privacies lie- hind: no, hers the task of rearing a vast and compli- cated facade whose ornamental intri- cacies none should penetrate. Action, motion, flutter, glit- ter thus was the average eye to be dazzled and de- feated. Though she talked much and well, as she sat there in rich and mournful black, certain lacuna- still persisted. No wid- ow developed; no children. But the studio refrained from inquiry; the less it positively knew, the better it was satisfied. Y'et Miss Foster, who admired statesmen, would have wel- comed a term in the State legislat ure; and Miss Fre- linghuysen, who was warm-hearted, would have given glad acclaim to the faithful support of some struggling college or asylum. But no such credentials were forthcoming. Reuben H. McEntee gained little as the soft, bright, glancing words piled up. In the end he remained hut the well-known turfman and the dear friend of Clarissa ShurtlefT. Mrs. ShurtlefT had formed a lofty and elaborate ideal. It called for all the florid definiteness of a bridal trousseau. It de- manded the interlocked pomp of panels, urns, carvings, balustrades. Not a single big idea, but a mass of little ones; and it was on this basis, productive of verbal op- portunity, that she did her talking. The young ladies, despite the brilliant, l ediz- ened loquacity of her discourse, soon seized her essential qual- ity. They declared among themselves that she had no real right to say any- thing in the matter, and unobtrusively turned their backs upon her; and Gertrude Plant, coming one day to the studio door and hearing within the soft, rapid, even flow of the woman s speech, refused to enter and took refuge, for half an hour, with a minia- turist farther down the hall. If she scorned Reuben H. McEntee as a de- tached figure, she detested him in the light of his social and domestic rela- tions. And as for the creature who had come in to un- settle a matter al- ready settled well, silence indeed were best, if it were pos- sible.  Be patient; be civil   Vincent had begged her.  It sall for you, dearest. It s disagreeable, I know; but can we let things fall through, now   One morning, a week or two later, there was a noisy rat-tat-tat on the studio door. Before any one could answer it, the door opened and a young man strode in. He was a wild-eyed, slapdash specimen, and he announced, in a tone not wholly devoid of truculence, that he was Gerald McEntee, of Cincinnati, and that he wished to know about the monument. It soon became apparent that the press, on both sides of the Ohio River, had been 438   Silence   busying itself with the demise of Reuben H. McEntee, with the manner in which he had bestowed his considerable fortune of three million dollars, and with the advent- ures of his executors in the art circles of the East.   Reuben H. McEntee was my father,  declared the young man fiercely.   I shall have something to say in this affair  and so will my mother and sisters    Young McEntee s eye swept hawklike over the room.   So that s the thing, is it    He pointed at the shrinking figure with a brown, sinewy finger: it was impossible that any one should pronounce the word   thing  with a more stridently contemptu- ous emphasis, or that any finger should shake with a more passionate and incredu- lous disgust. Then he turned his sharp, fierce eye on the artist; Vincent felt that he was viewed as little better than a conspira- tor he had combined with certain flagrant and rascally persons to rob a son of his rights. He, in turn, saw this young man as one of the contentious brood of a  com- mon-law  wife. Gerald McEntee would have his say, it was easy to foresee, about the role played by Clarissa Shurtleff, and about the integrity of Messrs. Hascomb and Prickett. He himself should not be the only rascal to be pilloried. McEntee continued to glare about the place. He seemed almost too outraged for coherent sj ecch; and he may have been a bit embarrassed by his novel environment. But Vincent, with an inner ear now attuned to finer things than mere speech, heard everything he thought.  Such a sum for such a work as that   Are you a madman   Are you a thief   Do you think I shall stand calmly by and let such creatures as you and Hascomb work your will   Can you believe that my mother and her children, after years of disgraceful neglect, will submit to such further injury as this   Glance and gesture made much of this internal dis- course as plain to Vincent s assistants as to himself. Miss Foster frowned; Miss Fre- linghuysen began to titter. Simcox, who was sprinkling a bunch of clay nymphs out of a big watering-pot, looked loyally at the master, set down the implement on the muddy floor, and gave his shirt-sleeves a further roll.  I can do it,  his look said. Vincent made a gesture of dissent. He was occupied with a vision of Gerald Mc- Entee s mother, and as the picture was founded upon the only data available at the moment those furnished by her son it was not flattering. The room was enriched by the presence of a woman whose dark iron-bound visage flamed with a vulgar determination. She was there to urge, to clamor, to contend, to expostulate. She made the room ring; and she might be relied upon to make other rooms ring. His ears tingled; his head swam. . . .   But why am I wasting words on you    cried the son of Reuben H. McEntee. If his stress on the word  thing  had been contemptuous, his stress on the word  you  was abysmally insulting.  I ll do my talking in Kentucky  I ll do my talking in the courts of Kentucky  That will dispose in short order of Hascombs and Shurtleffs and lumpy plaster images  You will leam mighty soon and mighty plain that-    Yes, yes, do your talking in Kentucky,  said Vincent, motioning him toward the door. The violent young man, with one rabid glance, threw himself out, and Vin- cent dropped into the nearest chair. He put his hands up to his ears. He had pre- sumed to evoke Silence; and Silence had produced, for her first-bom, Clamor; and Clamor, as something told him, had but begun its lusty career. Yet he only said:  Simcox, why did you set down the sprinkling-pot   Was it to turn on the fire- plug   Simcox grinned, but grinned speechless- ly; enough had been said. IV Tex or twelve days later another young man presented himself at the studio a trim, alert, self-confident chap who lost no time in naming the newspaper he served. Vincent often entertained the angels of the press, and one more or less of these celestial visitants mattered little. He gave them news paragraphs, synopses of his art talks, photographs for reproduction: they had space to fill and he had reputation to  make  one hand washed the other. But though he knew most of the people who   did   art, he was unable to place this particular youth. Indeed, the new-comer confessed himself the reverse of informed, and threw himself ingenuously on the artist s mercy.   incent always preferred modest ignorance to bumptious ignorance; it also pleased   Silence   439 him to find this particular newspaper dis- posed to give a little more attention to mat- ters of art. It was a sheet which treated news with a rich violence for the populace; it industriously turned the happenings of the current day into a certain crude sort of fiction. Now, happily, it was welcoming art in another form. Vincent, who was nothing if not a bom evangelist and propa-   Ah, yes; yes.

Page 440 gandist, welcomed with generous enthusi- asm so fine an opportunity to widen the field of his influence. His eagerness was militant in many places besides Passaic.  Tell me what it is, and all about it   said the young man, with engaging direct- ness, as he stood before the figure.   We re not always  wise  to everything we have to handle too many sorts of things for that.  Vincent warmed over again the phrases which he had employed, during many Sat- urday afternoon receptions, with various earnest women, old and young, and with occasional painstaking elderly gentlemen, handsomely dowered with leisure.   I see,  said the visitor, nodding eagerly.  And it commemorates Mr.-    Mr. McEntee, of Kentucky.  his domestic concerns, and about his exec- utors, and about the new tribe crying aloud for justice from Cincinnati, and about-   Oh, how could I have talked so much'   poor Vincent was moaning in self-accusa- tion, twenty-four hours later. "You didn t,  declared Miss Freling- huysen stoutly.   He knew three-quarters of it l efore he came. We have just put in the  heart-throbs  and the  human in- terest.   "Heart-throbs won t help us with Has- comb and Prickett,  moaned Vincent. "Perhaps they won t,  admitted his as- sistant soberly. For there had been much in that news- paper report to sober themostlight-hearted. 440   Silence   Three columns it ran   three sickening columns of inflated, repetitious verbiage, and nearly three-quarters of it all had been put direct into the mouth of Ho- ratio Vincent. It was he who, in proprid persond, told the shabby, hapless tale. Oh, the maddening reiteration of those quota- tion-marks as, brace after brace, they opened a new paragraph  And the two- column cut of his admirable photograph of the figure in candid, clear-cut plaster had come out as a mere black amorphous smudge    No, it won t help with Hascomb and Prickett,  Vincent had declared. He was right. It didn t. The afternoon papers took up the theme. Friends quizzed; visitors smiled; rivals sniggered. Vane Templeton let loose a girandole of airy impudence. The amount of printed chatter became prodigious. Vin- cent sighed for a hermitage in some lim- itless desert. His own  Silence  had become profaned and hateful; only the merciful silence of Nature could poultice his wounds. Much of this miscellaneous gossip and comment must have reached the executors. Their joint letter, when it came, was in Hascomb s hand. In civil paraphrase    Oh, can t he say it and have done    cried poor Y'incent it explained that legal and financial considerations made a final deci- sion at present impossible. The letter ram- bled on, with a touch, here and there, of the oratorical classicism still dear to the South; but it gave plain hints that somebody had talked too much, and it ended with an intimation that if the opportunity were presently seen to turn the work to other account, that opportunity had best be em- braced.   They re glad to get out of it,  Vincent declared that evening to Gertrude Plant.  They ve never felt sure of themselves, anyway.    1 am glad to have them out of it,  she replied bravely. Vincent thanked her, but he felt disap- pointed and resentful. He had thought to raise a chaste and severe temple to Silence, and this lovely structure had been over- whelmed by an avalanche of mere talk. And that talk was far from over. Indeed, it was scarcely begun. Booming reverber- ations from Kentucky were already in his ears. He heard the jargoning of lawyers, the jangling of court machinery: a flood of charges, appeals, demurrers, exceptions, perorations, as the tribe from Cincinnati fought for its rights under Reuben H. Mc- Entee s will or outside of it. Presently he heard his own voice mingling with the others. The attorney for young Gerald was toying with him just as he himself had often toyed with a handful of clay.   Please state the precise circumstances underwhich     Or,   Kindly repeat the exact words that were employed when-  Thus spoke the smiling, teasing lips, while he, a man of peace, a devotee of the quiet life, flushed, fidgeted, stammered, and felt him- self ridiculous. The face changed; another inquisitor, aflame with professional ire, hectored him on behalf of Clarissa Pamela ShurtlefT.   Can you be perfectly sure that any such thing was said   Or,  Are you ready to swear under oath that such an incident actually took place   He felt himself sinking into bottomless mortifica- tion as the whole court united in regard- ing him for the paltriest fellow in the world. His next Saturday reception brought a crowd, a jam. Half the world happened in to drop a part of speech the more upon the verbal cairn under which the  Silence  now lay buried. The studio put on its most gallant front. Defeat; defeat; but the little garrison would march out with arms and colors. Vincent wore his best frock-coat; Miss Frelinghuysen set forth tea and vanilla wafers; and Gertrude Plant, along with her mother, faced things till the end. Among the callers who crowded the narrow room was Alonzo Wetherington Wygant. Mr. Wygant felt himself a much-injured man. The Southerners had wounded him in his tenderest point his connoisseur- ship. He pronounced their course to be both indelicate and ungrateful. He aired his grievance to many, and more than one listener felt, with him, that he had been abused. But Mr. Wygant possessed a good deal of resiliency, and he could easily bound from one thing to another. He had not come alone; he had brought with him an art-loving friend one inclined to purchase, if purchase would but render the purchaser conspicuous. Wygant transferred his al-   Silence   441 legiance from the  Silence  to that group of nymphs which had been living for some weeks under wet rags and the watering- pot, but which had recently emerged into plaster.   George,  observed Wygant genially,   how would those young persons, done in marble, look on your lawn at Greenwich  None too bad, say I.  And he added that once the sculptor s name were mentioned to week-end guests, not a soul among them would fail to recognize it.   A   Vincent,'   said Wygant, with simple warmth. Then he gave the artist his elbow and de- clared beamingly that mere words had never downed a good man yet quite the contrary. Then, in a whisper, he added:  Have your nerve     George  was magnificently liberal, and fully  up,  on the instant, to a showy stroke. In the thinning throng he ex- changed a dozen words with Vincent, and he harassed the last of the lingerers with the complacent boasts of possession.  It will make you a marked man, George,  said Wygant, retiring, arm in arm, with his friend.   Never mind the tea things,  said Vin- cent to Miss Frelinghuysen;  go.   Never mind about me and dinner,  said Gertrude to her mother;  go.  The two remained alone together in the darkening studio, before the great, mournful, mysterious figure which had been the centre of so many hopes. Fortune had come, finally, if obliquely. They were too happy to speak. Silence, so long deferred, had been reached at last. WITH WHAT MEASURE YE METE THE CAMPAIGN FOR AN HONEST STANDARD By Francis E. Leupp ROM power-sites to pint- mcasures seems a far cry, yet in pursuit of its con- servation policy the govern- ment of the United States is concerning itself with both subjects. Before any great question can be intelligently considered, its stu- dents must lie equipped with terms of pre- cision. While, therefore, one committee of Congress is devoting its attention to mam- moth coal dejiosits and priceless water sources, another has before it a bill to fix the size of a berry basket. This contrast simply illustrates two extremes of the same principle; for the policy of conservation, broadly interpreted, means the avoidance of waste, whether in large or in little things; it covers not only the husbanding of the undeveloped natural resources to which posterity must look for its means of subsistence, but a more reasonable cost of living for our own generation. On Poor Richard s theory that the jienny saved is the penny earned, the conservation of hu- man energy by minimizing its wanton ex- penditure is as important in a way as the protection of a mineral bed or a spring-fed lake; and when we learn that every straw- berry sent from Florida to Massachusetts must be repacked before it is offered for sale because the   ottle in which it travels north may lie of any size the shipper pre- fers, whereas the statutes of the Bay State prescribe the size of the lx x or basket in which it shall be exposed in the markets there wc can understand why Congress takes cognizance of so apparently petty a business. To learn that the law demands that a certain receptacle shall hold an honest quart or some specified fraction thereof does not help us much unless we know what a quart is, and for a definition we turn to the Office of Weights and Measures in Washington, in the old times, this office occupied a small space in the build- 442 ing rented for the Coast Survey, where the metallic standards were kept under lock and key and the correspondence regarding them was carried on. Its chief benefici- aries were the custom-houses and mints. To-day it forms an important part of the national Bureau of Standards, which has a home of its own on a picturesque wooded knoll a little way outside of the city. The bureau is lodged in a group of buildings not only adapted for the preservation of our recognized standards of length, cubic con- tents, and weight, but equipped with labo- ratories and machinery for ascertaining new and exact units of force, resistance, conductivity, tensile strength, elasticity  in short, of substantially every quality of matter which, in scientific research and the practice of the useful arts, calls for accurate definition. Its director, who worked out and set going the present organization, is Dr. Samuel W. Stratton, formerly a professor of physics in the University of Chicago. Besides a record of scientific attainment and a conspicuous talent for administration, he has a happy gift for gathering about him a corps of young in- vestigators as well charged with rational enthusiasm as he is. Until alxnit ten years ago. the United States had the unenviable distinction of being the only great nation without such a bureau. As a result, American manufact- urers of scientific apparatus were obliged, in order to compete with their foreign ri- vals, to send their products abroad to be tested and certified. It was probably such galling admissions of inferiority which did most to spur Congress into providing an independent establishment for this country. Our Navy Department is no longer com- pelled, in order to insure itself against deception in the candle-power of the in- candescent lights it buys, to send them to Germany for standardization. In the single matter of the purchases of paper for the public printing, which amount to a million With What Measure Ye Mete 443 dollars a year, the bureau has already saved the government hundreds of thou- sands, by changes it has effected in the specifications on which bids are invited, and afterward frustrating attempts by con- tractors to furnish something inferior to the standard fixed. It is rendering like aid to all the purchasing agencies of the government, and, for a fair condensation, to private business concerns. Whoever has seen anything of sick- rooms knows the indispensable part played there by the clinical thermometer. One of the first steps the bureau took was to invite thermometer-makers everywhere to send in specimens of their wares for com- parison, and a strange condition of things was disclosed. So wide a diversity of stan- dards obtained within the industry that it would have been possible for a fatal dis- agreement to occur between three or four physicians called into consultation on a delicate case, if they carried thermometers made at different factories. The discovery wrought a revolution, and now most Amer- ican makers of clinical thermometers send them to Washington for test, accepting as their common standard that fixed by the government; while the prudent retail pur- chaser demands with his thermometer a certificate issued by the bureau either ap- proving the accuracy of the instrument or stating the amount of correction necessary in reading it. The most progressive man- ufacturers, indeed, have been steadily im- proving their machinery under the guid- ance of the bureau, so as to turn out a higher average product. Not only clinical thermometers, but many of other kinds, are sent to the bureau for test and correction. The importance of this privilege to the business world may be guessed from the case of a thermometer submitted by a New York concern, where an error of one-sixteenth of a degree made a difference of fifteen thousand dollars paid in one year for coal purchased on the basis of its calorific value. In such lines of manufacture as steel, glass, and porcelain, there are processes where one vital factor is a ternj eralure too high to be gauged by any mechanical ther- mometer. To miss this pivotal point by never so slight a fraction of lack or excess may completely transform the character of the fused material. That means waste through spoiling, a heavy aggregate in- crease of running expenses for the factory, possible delays of months in the comple- tion of the work, and an added cost to the consumer for the finally perfected article, bccause it has to be sold for enough to pay for the many failures as well as for the one success. A few years ago, the decision when the desired temperature had been reached was a matter of shrewd guesswork, or at best of cultivated instinct; and operatives who could  read the fire  commanded high salaries. All this uncertainty is dis- appearing before the bureau s exj eriments in optical pyrometry, which are now mak- ing it possible to measure the heat of the fire by the quality of the light it sends forth. Among other undertakings of popular interest has been the research required in providing for the utmost precision of the volumetric apparatus used in administer- ing minute quantities of high-potent drugs like antitoxins; for the correction of pho- tographic lenses to insure their greater fidelity of reproduction; for ascertaining the trustworthiness of gas and water me- ters of various types, the strength of cloths, leathers, and twines, and the durability of building materials. These are but a few of many, but they will convey some idea of the latitude of this department of the bureau s work. Returning to our ordinary weights and measures: most of those employed in the United States were brought bodily from England. There, in the earlier days, they differed even in the several counties; but by degrees, as intercourse between all parts of the kingdom grew more intimate, it became necessary to find some units which could be nation-wide in their use, and rooted in governmental authority. In- to the American colonies had been intro- duced many of the local standards, so that, when our present Union was formed, each State had its own system, and in the coun- try at large there was chaos. All the wiser heads among the fathers recognized the importance of bringing about some orderly plan, and Washington, Adams, and Jefferson repeatedly called the attention of Congress to the power con- ferred upon it by the Constitution to  fix the standards of weights and measures.  But the jealousy with which the States were guarding their individuality would 444 With What Measure Ye Mete have made it politically embarrassing for any law-maker to press a programme which might force upon one State the surrender of its own standards in favor of those of some sister State. So ii was not till 1830 that Congress, having had its notice sharply drawn to inequalities in the methods pursued at different custom- houses, investigated the whole subject and enacted a law prescribing for the use of the Treasury Department the avoirdupois pound, the English yard, the wine gallon, and the Winchester bushel familiar to our generation. Six years later, it directed the Secretary of the Treasury to deliver to the governor of each State a complete set of these standards. The States so generally responded that the pound, yard, gallon, and bushel are now for the most part uniform throughout the country, but the exceptions are too serious to be ignored. In some States, for instance, the gallon of certain materials is defined in pounds: twelve pounds of honey being a legal gallon in Nebraska, six and one-half pounds of kerosene in Kansas, seven and one-half pounds of lin- seed oil in Ohio, and eleven pounds of sorghum molasses in Indiana. These weights do not agree with the gallon fixed by Congress at two hundred and thirty-one cubic inches. In other cases the old ale gallon of two hundred and eighty-two cubic inches is legalized, while in a few States the old ale or milk gallon is the legal dry gallon, though about five  jer cent, larger than the corresponding unit derived from the Winchester bushel. The bushel itself still varies widely in the measurement of particular commodi- ties. Thus, a coal bushel ranges through six States all the way from 2,419$ cubic inches to 2,748 a difference of more than one-eighth and like variations are found in the lime, coal, and coke bushels. Coal is sold in some States by the ton of 2,000 pounds, and in others by the ton of 2,240 pounds; but the greatest vagaries appear in the liquid barrel, which swings from twenty-nine gallons in New York to forty- two gallons in Texas. It is plain, there- fore, that there is room yet for some reforms which will enable the purchaser in one Stale to know what he is buying in another without an elaborate calculation in deci- mals. Nor are the existing standards traceable to an origin so stable that they could be verified promptly by a scientific process. How many women, buying a yard of rib- bon, know that they are measuring the length of the arm of King Henry I of England, who established that standard in 1120  The inch, from which most of us construct the yard, was not invented till nearly two centuries later, a statute of the reign of Edward II defining its length as that of  three barley-corns, round and dry.  As the English had by that time become absorbed in agriculture, or com- merce in its products, this industry' fur- nished another unit in the reign of Henry III, when, though the penny was made the common basis of weight, its own stability was insured by the requirement that it should weigh the same as thirty-two wheat- corns taken from the midst of the ear  The eccentric pedigrees of our inherited standards will account for die welcome ac- corded to the French plan for measuring off a quarter of one of the earth s meridians, dividing this into ten million equal parts, and adopting one such part as the unit of length, under the name of the metre; the idea being that, even if all the concrete official standards in the world were simul- taneously destroyed by some cataclysm, the scientists who survived the disaster could measure off the quadrant again and re-establish the metre with accuracy. Con- fidence in this forecast was somewhat shaken, however, by the discovery, when geodetic science had reached a higher stage of precision, that the first measure of the quadrant was so far at fault as to affect the length of the metre by the thickness of a sheet of the paper on which this magazine is printed. Trifling as the error seemed to the popu- lar eye, it was enough to set the physicists searching once more for an unvarying natural standard. The swing of a pendu- lum, and a number of other constant media, were considered, but the inquirers appear to have settled finally upon the length of a wave of light, which by general consent offers an ideal solution of the difficulty. 1 he metre, in spite of its slight shortcom- ing, is so well intrenched that probably no attempt will be made to dislodge it as the unit in daily use through most of the civil- ized world; but, since the proportional With What Measure Ye Mete 445 relation between the standard metre and the wave-length has been definitely de- termined, the metre can be described in wave-length terms and reconstructed at will; and from the metre can always be worked out the necessary units of bulk and gravity. Having decided what shall be the stan- dards of size and weight and volume, it remains to enforce a proper respect for these in the daily transactions of life; and here, in spite of all the clamor about the cost of living, it is strange how little the complainants seem disposed to do for their own protection. To stir them to action, the bureau has set afoot an unostentatious but effective campaign of education. Mrs. Housewife, having ordered a bill of groceries amounting to four dollars and eighty-three cents, tenders a five-dollar banknote in payment. Her change she scrutinizes to make sure that she gets her full seventeen cents, and in honest money; but it does not seem to occur to her to make equally sure that she has received sixteen ounces in every ostensible pound of butter, a whole peck of potatoes, or a full gallon of syrup. She fails to notice whether the package of Eatemup Grits she bought to-day is as large as the package she bought a month ago, or to compare the price of Brightfire s Breakfast Bacon, put up in those dainty little jars, with that of the bacon she used to get by the jxmnd. And when, at the close of the semester, she is footing up her domestic expenses and sighing over their continued increase, she lays all the blame upon the apparenUy moderate advance in the price-list, instead of charging part of it to her own confusion of prices with values, gross with net weights, and trade with standard measures. Doubtless she would be shocked to learn that every barrel of flour she buys lacks four pounds of its professed weight; yet that very fact has developed in the District of Columbia, whose people, consuming three hundred thousand barrels every year, spend forty-two thousand dollars for flour which they never receive  Investigations made or inspired by the Bureau of Standards show that the manu- facturers of a certain breakfast food who, before the enactment of the pure food law, used to stamp each package with its puta- tive weight, have quietly ceased to do this. Vol. XLV1II. 42 Not one purchaser in a hundred suspects, till his attention is called to the change, that he is not buying in a package as many ounces as of old; yet as a matter of fact there has been a shrinkage of more than thirty per cent in its weight, and an in- crease of fifty per cent in its pound price. Indeed, the package used to-day can be set down bodily inside of the package used two years ago, with plenty of room to spare. The other day a housekeeper who had paid a dollar for a sealed and labelled pail of lard, took the empty pail to market and had it refilled by weight at a cost of only fifty-six cents. One brand of bacon is sold in packages for forty per cent, more than the cost of the same grade open on a butcher s stall; the corresponding disparity in dried codfish sometimes amounts to more than sixty-two per cent.; and there are varieties of crackers which, bought by the box or in bulk, show a differ- ence in cost of one hundred per cent. 'I his is no disparagement of package edibles as such. A great deal is to lie said for them in spile of any degree of compara- tive expensiveness. In point of selected excellence, appetizing appearance, cleanli- ness, economy of space, and convenience of pantry storage, they are far superior to the carelessly kept and roughly handled goods dug out of a barrel with a scoop, or chopped off with a cleaver, or poured from a box into not-too-well-kept scales. Ten- ants of apartments appreciate their con- densed form and their readiness for im- mediate use; and most of us who have become fastidious in our tastes will con- tinue to buy the more costly articles in defiance of the economists. The prime consideration is that every one should know what he is buying and how much he is paying for it. The reform movement, after several years of effort, is still sporadic; but all big reforms begin with germinations in separ- ated spots, the growths gradually expanding till they merge and cover the whole ground. We see such a process now under way in New England, where the ceaseless activity of Massachusetts is making itself uncom- fortably but wholesomely felt in neighbor States hitherto apathetic. In 1891, for ex- ample, the Massachusetts legislature en- acted a law proscribing milk jarsand bottles which fall short of their pretended meas- 446 With What Measure Ye Mete urc. The first year s inspection showed that nearly half the receptacles then in use were deficient What happened   As soon as a batch were condemned, they were taught by the junkmen and shipjted into Connecticut or Rhode Island, where there was no statutory bar to their use. One hun- dred thousand short bottles thus found their way into Rhode Island alone. When the people of that State awoke to the imposi- tion, they procured from their legislature a law to stop it, and all the short bottles were promptly dumped into Connecticut, a small surplus continuing their westward travels till they invaded New York. It took Rhode Island fifteen years to become indignant enough to act for its own relief: conmunities are large bodies and move slowly. Yet they are, after all, only aggregations of individuals; and every mail brings to the Bureau of Standards evidence that individuals here and there are beginning to appreciate the need not only of definite laws on the subject of weights and measures and a vigorous ad- ministration of them, but of such uniformity in both laws and administration that false standards driven out of one State shall not find refuge in another. A physician complains that he recently ordered several gross of one-ounce round prescription bottles of a glass factor  , and received bottles holding six drachms, not eight. Three-ounce botdcs of medicine he found to contain only two and one-half ounces. He has discovered that in the sale of crystalline medicines, what passes over the apothecary s counter for an ounce is really only four hundred and thirty-two grains, not four hundred and eighty; also, that the pint bottles in which beer and malt liquors arc sold contain as a rule twelve ounces instead of sixteen, while the quart bottles show an even worse shortage. A Maine woman who raises squabs in order to keep her invalid husband supplied with what he needs, carries the birds to market herself, weighing them before starting. The weight the marketman places upon them governs, however, and, as it is always short of hers, she goes home every time with less money than she is entitled to. A dealer in oil and olives, doing busi- ness in Philadelphia, has to pay for his goods on hogshead measurement gauged in New York, where the importations are entered. When he sells them again, it is by his own measurement in broken quan- tities, and the sum of his sales never equals what he is charged for in New York. The fruit merchants of Massachusetts, who are behind the movement for a federal definition of a berry basket in inter-State commerce, are not the only representatives of their trade who are anxious for compul- sory uniformity in the measures of fruit packages. An enormous business is done in Western apples for Eastern markets; a reduction of the number of apples in a box from fifty to forty-eight means a saving of four per cent, to the producer; hence the shipping interests are resisting the ef- forts of the retailing interests to have the inside dimensions of an apple-box regu- lated by law. In the paper industry, leading manufact- urers and dealers are seeking a satisfactory basis for the measurement of their com- modity, so as to reconcile trade phraseology with fact in any transaction. One dealer, speaking for a large association, complains that the manufacturers, in handling most grades of their product, wrap the article sold in a coarser grade of paper, often so heavy that the wrapping alone makes two or three per cent of the total weight of the package.  A customer,  he says,   buying a bundle of fifty-pound paper, may receive forty-eight pounds of the paper he has purchased and two pounds of the coars- er grade, but he is billed and pays for fifty pounds.  This is a trade custom, so en- cysted that it may require a great deal of time and effort to pry it out; but the sig- nificant point is that the desire to get rid of it is now active within the trade itself. One branch of the bureau s educational campaign is carried on through a national conference on weights and measures which meets yearly in Washington under its aus- pices. Facts brought out in the discussions there, if they can be accepted as typical, indicate a deplorable laxity in the petty trade of the people, if nothing worse. The delegates who cite them are men charged in their own communities with the custody of the local weights and measures and with the execution of the laws relating thereto. Even in the States where regu- lation is most stringent, it apjjears that confiscations include, to this day, spring With What Measure Ye Mete 447 balances with sliding fronts, dry and wet measures with false sides or movable bot- toms,   five-pound   Iwxes of creamery but- ter which hold only four pounds and eleven ounces,   ten-pound   pails of lard which contain only eight pounds and three-quar- ters, and the like. Some States make elaborate provision for the legal measurement of the great natural products which arc piling up fort- unes for a few   ersons, while leaving the hand-to-mouth clement no defence against the hucksters who sell them their daily sup- plies. Several communities in which elec- trical power is in common use for domestic purjjoscs are without laws for its measure- ment. A few cities have far cclipscd most of the States, in adopting ordinances to for- bid the sale of small fruits and groceries by the  cup,   can,   bag,  or other in- definite measure liable to mislead igno- rant customers, and placing fines uj n the sale of vegetables and fruits in boxes or baskets faced with a quality of goods de- ceitfully superior to those found in the lower layers. More ingenuity is expended on counter- feit weights and measures than on coun- terfeit money, it is safe to say; and a great deal more than, applied to an honest pur- pose, would make the fortunes of the in- ventors. The driver of a wagon delivering kerosene oil to retail customers was caught reducing the capacity of a five-gallon can which he used for a measure and which had been officially inspected and marked on the outside as of full capacity by set- ting up inside of it two blocks of wood as large as building bricks, and bracing these against opposite sides, where they would be hidden by the shoulders of the can, by forcing a slender stiff stick lengthwise between them. Coal has always been a favorite medium for the practice of fraud. The variance between the 2,000-pound ton which is legal in most of the States, and the 2,240-pound ton which is legal in others, is confusing, and the difficulty of weighing so bulky a commodity is prohibitive for the ordinary householder, whose only protec- tion lies in dealing with merchants of es- tablished reputation. One shrewd fellow in Washington, D. C., carried on a thriving business for a long time by soliciting small orders from his friends at less than the cus- tomary price and delivering 1,000 pounds as a half-ton, instead of the 1,120 to which his customers were entitled under the local law. In some cities the street pcdlers use a balance of German manufacture. In Ger- many it is forbidden because it is recog- nized as so iwtcntially iniquitous an imple- ment, and it is made for export to those countries where, as in ours, the standard laws arc uncertain or lax. One of our American lalxtr-saving devices, however, is quite as bad. This is a cheap  comput- ing scale  used by many a small trades- man on the pretext that, as it tells him not only the weight of the goods he is selling but what he must charge for them at so much a pound, it spares him thus much mental calculation; but as the instrument is incxact enough to leave always a trilling margin of uncertainty, he feels justified in giving himself, and not his customer, the liencfit of that. Another scale, outwardly of the conventional pattern, is so construct- ed that the weights will weigh true or false according to the  x sition in which they arc set on their plate; and one, specially designed for use in a hardware store, is connected with a magnet concealed under the counter, and so placed as to exert its influence on the pan in which nails and similar metal goods arc weighed. Even the best of scales can be used by an unscrupulous dealer for bad purposes. He may apj ear annoyed by the rattling of the pan against ift iron holder, and slip an innocent-looking wad of pa  er under it; or, if he keeps a small and not over-nice butchcr-shop, he may leave the pan un- scoured, so that, by successive weighings of fat meats, it accumulates on its inner surface a thick smear of grease. For this smear, as well as for the folded paper, the customer pays for an extra ounce or so at the rate charged for his groceries or his meat. And what do these trifles signify  In a city where the inspectors have to visit ten thousand shops annually, it has been estimated that half of them contain at least one scale which is short-wcight by an ounce, and that a reasonable aver- age use of such scale would be forty times a day. Counting three hundred business days to the year, the loss to the purchas- ing public in that period would amount to three million seven hundred and fifty thousand pounds; and the larger part would 448 With What Measure Ye Mete fall upon the class of small purchasers least fitted to stand it. The growth of the conferences in at- tendance anti interest shows a marked im- provement in public sentiment everywhere on this question of the honest measure. States which had lost or mislaid the stan- dards presented to them by the Federal Government have hunted these up; some which kept theirs in out-of-the-way places have provided for their more convenient storage; others which had left theirs to suffer damage by exposure and neglect have had them readjusted and brought into regular use. Co-operation for a com- mon end which means a pecuniary benefit to all the people has brought alxmt a neighborly feeling between State officers who once stood aloof; and their nightmare bogy of   centralization  has been exor- cised by the discovery that the authorities at Washington are making no effort to usurp tyrannically the police powers of the States, but rather trying to aid the States in making those powers effective for good. The final result of the agitation will, of course, be complete uniformity all through the country in matters affecting weights and measures. Whether it will take the shape of a general remodelling of State laws and methods to conform to some scheme pro- nounced by the conferences to be most feasible, or whether the whole business will be voluntarily turned over by the States to the Federal Government, remains to be seen. Possibly a middle ground may be preferred, Congress prescribing in pos- itive statutory terms a system of standards and units which must prevail in all trans- actions, and providing for the prosecution of offenders engaged in inter-State com- merce, but leaving each State free to pun- ish malfeasance committed within its own exclusive jurisdiction. The one great es- sential is to have an accurate and un- changeable basis for all business involving questions of quantity, and a terminology which shall mean just the same thing in Arizona that it means in Vermont. Nor is the ideal of uniformity merely national. The interest long felt through- out the civilized world in the establishment of a universal system of standards is evi- denced by the meeting, in 1870, of an international conference at Paris to con- sider certain phases of the subject. The Franco-Prussian War had a depressing effect on the attendance that year, but at later gatherings the business made such progress that the French Government, on whose initiative it had been started, set apart a plot of ground about two acres in area, in the Park of St. Cloud, just out- side of Paris, declared it neutral territory, and dedicated it to the uses of an Inter- national Bureau of Weights and Meas- ures. A universal metre and kilogramme were adopted by the conference of 1889, and stored in a subterranean vault on the premises, where they are accessible only when three independent officers with dif- ferent keys come together. Exact dupli- cates of these standards were distributed among the governments represented at the meeting. The neutralized head-quarters of the International Bureau stand on the same footing as the High Court of Arbitration at The Hague and the office of the Uni- versal Postal Union at Berne; and the movement which culminated in its founda- tion was as spontaneous, and grew as naturally out of the needs of the world in our generation, as these other great monu- ments of advanced civilization. Nay, back of its economic phases, notable as these may be, lies one yet broader and more im- portant. Standardization on a world-wide scale points to the symmetrical union of industries all over the earth; greater facil- ity of commercial intercourse, and hence more of it; the elimination of a thousand misunderstandings, once the most fruitful source of controversy; and the cultivation of closer ties, based on better acquaintance, between the people of the chief producing nations. In brief, it may, under the right direction, become a powerful factor in the establishment of universal peace. An Aniimi Type. A Congo lk y. A Congo GirL THE REAL AFRICAN By Herbert Ward 1 1. HI S T R All II X s l'KKM SCl'LPTURKS II v Mr. W Alt It ENTRAL AFRICA is a land of strange and fatal enchant- ment. There is an inexpressible charm in picking one s way through localities that have never before been visited by a white man; seeing strange types anti hearing new lan- guages. To l e alone in the very centre of the African continent, where nature and human nature are alike in a crude state; to be far away in the midst of a primitive people whose nature is wild and uncultivated people who are simple, sav- age in ignorance, timid and ever fearing for their lives; to l e the one delegate, as it were, of the modern world in the midst of countless thousands of human beings whose minds are the minds of primitive mankind; to live free from all the petty conventional- ities and ramifications of civilization; to be able to foregt  all the artificial necessities of our modern home life; to give free play to that strong, inward craving for true natural liberty, these are some of the subtle at- tractions that inoculate every man of Afri- can experience; these are the charms which cast their spell upon all African travellers, Vol. X LVI11. 43 and which have held so many of them fas- cinated for long years. It has been my good fortune to have passed five years of my life among the savage inhabitants of Central Africa. En- tering Africa in the year 1884 under the auspices of Stanley, I served two and a half years in pioneer work connected with the newly formed Congo State. Whilst still in Africa, Stanley arrived with his exjiedi- tion for the relief of Emin Pasha, and I was enrolled, in 1886, as a volunteer officcr of that expedition anti faced once more the far interior.  I took to Africans from the first. They appealed strongly to my sympathy by rea- son of their directness, their lack of schem- ing, and by the spontaneity of everything they tlid. My confidence ripened as time went on and I found myself imbued with a profound sympathy for African human nature. Of all the aboriginal races with which I have come in contact during my travels in New Zealand, Australia, Borneo, and the Far East, the African appeals to me as being the most transparently human.   Works by Herbert Ward: " Five Yean with tlir Conao Cannibal ,"   My I.ifc with Stanley's Rear Guard. " 449 450 The Real African Among the native tribes of the Congo region of Central Africa there exists no form of history. There is no written lan- guage. They have no signs or characters; no traditions and no memorials of the past. It is as though an opaque curtain hung behind the living generation, concealing every- thing that passed before their time. It is considered a bad omen to al- lude to any one who is dead. Such an allusion is only made by accident, and is immedi- ately redeemed by a snapping of the fingers. No record is kept of dates. Consequently na- tives are ignorant of their age. The only epochs that remain marked in their minds are associated with such events as the occasion of a tri- bal fight or the killing of an ele- phant. 'Ilieir lives are as wild and un- checked as the tangled growth of their primeval for- est homes. There is nothing to oc- cupy or to stimulate the mind, which lives, thinks, and acts for the moment. They possess a faculty of indifference, the ob- vious outcome of the precariousness of their lives. When not fighting for bare existence, their minds are focussed U   n methods of satisfying their animal wants. Despite the present condition of these forest tribes, there yet remain signs of a former condition of superiority. A world of human nature lies hidden lieneath their dark, forbidding exteriors. Upon many occasions I have had revealed to me evidences of humane and tender feelings. The eyes of the Congo forest dwellers are never refreshed by a distant view, and there is no bright sunshine in their country to gladden their hearts, for the sun s rays seldom or never penetrate the eternal forest gloom in which they spend their lives. With danger lurking behind the trunk of every tree, and with an ever-present fear of capture and death, they live their days and years; they pass through periods of modified joys and sorrows, knowing nothing of the out- side world, living without hope and without regrets. Nothing is last- ing in their lives; the keenest heart- ache, the bitterest grief is soon for- gotten. They live only for the pres- ent, without pros- pect or retrosj ect. In view of the growth of modern tendencies in re- lation to questions of socialism and equality, much that is instructive may be gathered from a study of the existing con- ditions of the life of the African savage. In Central Africa we have a complete ob- ject lesson l efore us of the ultimate re- sults of life under conditions of equality. It would seem that the social state of equality which is observed by primitive mankind is now the aim and ambition of the most highly civilized communities. Social equality appears to be the first and last ambition in the history of man- kind. L  Chef de Tnbtt. The Real African 451 Throughout Central Africa the spirit of enterprise among the people is restrained, not to say crushed, from the fear of ex- citing the envy and cupidity of their fel- lows. As an instance: One who builds a bet- ter house than his neigh- l or s will have his house pulled down forthwith. Should a man exert himself to amass native riches, he courts the en- mity of all his fellows and becomes doomed to an early death. Ambi- tion to excel, which is such a natural attribute of human nature, re- ceives no encouragement in Central Africa. Coin- ciding with this state of life, we find the jjeople living in a state of an- archy and ignorance, without a constitution, without a his ton-, and even without definitely established habitations. They lack even the am- bition of conquest, and they are content to pass their lives in a state of mental atrophy. The extraordinary vi- rility of all the Central African races may be ascribed to the follow- ing principal reasons: Firstly, to the plurality of women, for, generally speaking, one finds the number of women is grcady in excess of the male population, the rea- son for this being that men are so frequently killed in their incessant intertribal battles. It necessarily follows that the strongest and most enterprising of the men is generally the owner of the most wives, and conse- quently the fittest male becomes the father of the most children. Their children are like ours. The pleas- ures of the African child are the pleas- ures of all children. Their mothers coo to them and use flowery and endearing terms. Whilst still mere babies, after being bathed and laid out in the sun to dry, they toddle about helping to catch small fish or to snare birds, and they play at cooking food in the burning embers of their mothers  fire. Little boys make miniature bows and ar- rows; they paddle mini- ature canoes and am- bitiously imitate all the pursuits of grown-up people. They have no guiding voice to correct or to curb their natural animal instincts. They are the offspring of par- ents whose union was merely transitory. Home life does not exist. Huts are gener- ally built in long rows. Women and very young children dwell together, but the men lead a prim- itive club life of their own. They have no ar- tificial appliances for comfort. There is prac- tically no reserve or pri- vacy in their lives. There would appear to be solid foundation in support of the fol- lowing theory which ac- counts for the apparent arrest of the intellectual faculties at an early age. Certain it is that Cen- tral African children are exceedingly intelligent and quick-witted. The subsequent arrest of the intellectual faculties has been attributed to the premature closing and subsequent ossification of the sutures of the skull, thus arresting the normal expansion of the brain. The Congo languages may l e described as onomatopteic, a word which may be defined as representing a system of coining words from sounds. For example, in the same manner that our children say  Puff- puff  to indicate a train, so the African savages will use the words   Watamba tam- ba  to describe men who march in large l odies. in imitation of the sound of their Defiance 452 The Real African footsteps.    Watuku tuku    was also coined l y them to designate white men, because they associated them with the sound of the engines of their river steamers. 1 he first syllable  Wa  in each case repre- sents the plural prefix denoting people. Their languages are rich and liquid, and contain a preponderance of vowels. 'I he A Congo   ii  beauty and plastic form of these languages are noticeable, suggesting the softness of Italian, the grace of French, and the pre- cision of Fnglish. The most natural peculiarity of the lan- guage is the prevailing use of prefixes in place of suffixes, and an alliteration which amounts almost to rhyme. It is interesting to remember that this euphonious pecul- iarity is also found in early English. Soft, pliant, and musical, the language is governed by an alliterative concord. There are but few consonants, of which, in the Lower Congo language, the letter  F  is the most frequently met with. In fact, the missionaries, in setting up type to print their translations of the Scriptures into Kikongo, had to send home an order for an extra stock of vowels and F s. It is a fact worthy of remark that the first sound a Central African baby utters, like our own babies, is the word "Mam- ma." This same word "Mamma  I have heard uttered on more than one occasion by wounded Africans as a last dying ar- ticulation. Central African natives are naturally eloquent and ready speakers. They are adepts in the use of metaphor. They reason well and they are ready debaters. The sono- rous effect of their specch is greatly aided by the soft inflections and the moist eu- phony of their language. The best illustration of the naivete of Central African character occurred to me at a place called Manyanga, sit- uated in the cataract region of the Lower Congo. It was during the hottest part of the day. and I was sitting on the veranda of my grass-thatched hut gazing ujx n the troubled waters of the cataracts, think- ing of the particularly tragic incident which ended the life of Frank l ocock, perhaps the most tragic circumstance connected with Stanley s memorable travel across Africa in the year 1877. From where I sat, I could see the troubled waters swirling and foam- ing below the huge rocks against which the   oor brave fellow had been dashed to death. A party of natives returning from a mar- ket wended their way toward me, and the sjjokesman, by every persuasive power of speech, endeavored to sell me a skinny goat for treble its value. The interview ended abruptly, and a few minutes later I was watching the little party embarking in a canoe, paddling their way up-stream, keeping close to the shore, until they at- tained a point at which it was customary, but at all times hazardous, to steer the A COttgQ Savage A uulivr  tm-nring   frih in the ttMui. fraiJ round-bottomed dug-out across to the north bank, a distance of some five hundred yards, through violent and ever-changing whirlpools. About half a mile below this point the water churned itself into foam as it swept over a succession of enormous rocks, and represented a threatening dan- ger to those who crossed the river. Listlessly,at first, I watched the little par- ty in their wabbling canoe until they had reached the critical part of their journey, the point at which they had to manoeuvre their canoe so as to escape the vortex of a powerful whirljjool. My apathy soon gave way to a feeling of keen apprehension ns I observed the frail canoe being carried away, broadside on, in the swiftest part of the channel. The paddlers had evidently lost control, and the occupants of the canoe appeared to be overcome by a sense of impending disas- ter, for they l egan to sway the canoe from side to side in their endeavors to aid the paddlers. By the time I reached the river's bank all was lost, for the canoe had sunk, and in its place were now merely a few black specks bobbing here anti there, with occa- sionally an arm thrown up in wild despair. In a few minutes all was ended, and the poor fellows who had been drowned were swept away by the terrific force of the stream. To my amazement, I perceived one individual who still kept atloat and who swam bravely back toward the south shore. Running along the river bank I kept pace with him as he drifted, and the tension of watching the poor man s efforts became acute. At the time, it seemed mi- raculous that the man should have power enough to reach the shore, but he did. My surprise can be imagined when I found that a child, a chubby little boy of tour or five years of age, was still clinging around the man s neck. Overcome by excitement and by admi- ration for the man s prowess, I aided him to land, and took the two survivors to my hut, where I collected everything I could lay my hands upon likely to be con- sidered valuable in the eyes of a native. At the same time, as I presented the man with modest gifts, 1 told him that he had that day performed a deed which would greatly please white men. I told him that he was a plucky fellow for having saved a helpless child from imminent death. He replied: 453 454 The Real African   Yes, he is saved. I tried many limes to shake him off, but he clung too tight   In order to relieve the monotony of my station life. I endeavored to institute an athletic meeting among the natives of I he surrounding villages. Such a thing was an entire novelty in the country, where, in- deed, the advent of the white man dated but a few months back. The chiefs with whom I discussed the matter readily agreed to bring their most powerful young men on the day appointed. They assented to my suggestions with so little surprise as to make it difficult for me to realize that I was introducing to them an entertain- ment of quite a strange character. Early on the day fixed for the sports I was startled by gun firing. Volleys were fired at regular in- tervals: indeed, the firing lasted until al out ten o clock, by which time I found my station crowded by be- tween five and six hundred natives. To provide re- freshments for the party I had three large pigs roasted whole, and, in addition to a limited quantity of palm wine, which was scarce at that time, I had my two zinc: baths filled with water so as to save my guests the trouble of going down-hill to the stream, which was some three hun- dred yards away. I soon discovered that the unanimous wish of the people was to begin proceed- ings by partaking of refreshments, and al- though to my idea this was quite contrary to the usual custom followed at athletic meetings, I gave way. By noon provisions were exhausted, and there remained at the bottom of the two baths only a little greasy water where the natives had stooped down to drink after eating their fill of fat pork. The first item on the programme was a hundred yards race in which every one seemed eager to en- ter. It was in vain that I tried to per- suade them to relin- quish their spears and shields; they ex- plained to me that they could run just as well with them as without them. The starting of this race was a most laborious business; handicapping was out of the question, and the line, when they all stood ready to go, extended for some distance. I had arranged to start them with a pistol shot. After numberless false starts and a good deal of angry wran- gling, wherein one- half of the company appeared to lose their tempers and the other half to be- come sulky, I at length succeeded in getting them off. Immediately all was chaos. The na- tive idea seemed to be to win by disabling one s adversaries, and the race resolved itself into one wild struggle, in which most of those engaged found themselves on the'ground. The winning post was passed by about fifty men cn masse. I at last realized the difficulty of the situa- tion. It was perfectly hopeless to explain matters. Every man who started in the race came to me clamoring for a prize, each one arguing that as he entered for the event he was justly entitled to reward  Angry words were soon followed by blows, and during the remainder of the The Real African 455 afternoon I found myself in the midst of a The savage shrugged his shoulders, and violent, turbulent mob of people who were with a scornful toss of his head he replied: apparently bereft of all reason.

It was late that night before my station resumed its normal quiet, and as I stretched my- self out for the night, it was with the full conviction that the time for in- troducing sporting events in that part of the country was not yet ri  c. One day, whilst strolling through a native village, my attention was at- tracted by the pite- ous moaning of a woman. I found her lying upon a heap of refuse  banana peelings, sweepings, fish- bones, and rubbish, all seething in the hot sun. The poor creature appeared to be in great distress. Her body was smeared with blood and filth, and the flesh was literally torn from either side of her face, leaving her temples bare and raw. In her agony she had clawed and torn her flesh with her finger nails. Her despair was indeed pitiful to behold, and I sought to soothe her, but all in vain. Turning to a native who was standing by I inquired in the native language:  What ails this woman   What manner of malady is this  Quickly tell me words to explain this.  have moved a heart of stone. There at my feet was a rev- elation of savage feeling, of love and grief, of the deep emotions that can be enjoyed and suf- fered by one even of a cruel, cannibal race. As a mother, this woman had cherished and loved her child; as a sav- age, ignorant of faith and forlorn, she mourned her infant s death. The following in- cident impressed me as being typical of African vanity: It was in a mar- ket place, and the inhabitants of all the count ry-side were there, buying, selling, haggling; each individual talking incessantly, and quite indiffer- ent as to whether any one listened. Presently I de- tected the sound of angry voices. Said the Chief of Fumba to the Chief of Lu- tete:   How poor are your   eople  A chief of people so poor is scarcely a chief at all. Do you not suffer from hunger  Are you not cold at night because you have no cloth  And your dead, is it not hard to place them in the ground without any cloth around their bodies  Your children, too why, our slaves at Fumba own more wealth than your people of Lutete." In the course of a heated reply I heard the Chief of Lutete allude to the forthcom- ing market of Nkandu. Said he: Lei Fuxitifs. 456 The Real African  Your words arc the words of envy. At the Nkandu market we will show you that you lie. that your words are not true words. Wait, O Chief  Wait for the next market day.  This little dispute interested me, and I made a point of attending the next market. Everything went on as usual until noon. Suddenly I heard excla- mations of aston- i s h m e n t and wonder. Hands were placed over open mouths in token of surprise as the people gazed upon a long procession which slowly wended its way upthehill. These were the people of Luiete, and they had come to answer the taunts of the Chief of Fumba by a pa- rade of their wealth and pos- sessions. There were probably two hundred men and women, and the chief, who led them in person, was most gor- geously attired. Hecarried a scar- let parasol, encir- cled with gold lace. Upon his head he wore an English lifeguardsman's helmet; around his neck he had the wooden circlet of a tam- bourine with its little brass cymbals jin- gling, and he wore next to his naked Ixxly the scarlet tunic of a militia uniform, which, together with some yards of multi-colored cotton doth wrapped round his waist, with the ends trailing in the dusty ground be- hind him, completed his dress. The cos- tumes of his followers were no less amazing in their incongruity, anti the whole formed a collection of so varied a nature as would have aroused the interest of a Iloundsditch clothier. The parasols of all shades and descriptions; the yards of cloth and cotton goods; the rows upon rows of glass beads which adorned the bodies of the women; the jingling of the bells; the brave show of old tlint-lock guns; the queer uses to which some of the garments had been put, all made a picture not easily to lie forgotten. Without a word being said the cavalcade en- tered the market place and in a most dignified manner they marched through the throng of admiring and dumfounded spectators, only to retire in the same order as they had come, still without ut- tering a word, whilst we all stood gazing in astonish men t and silence as they followed the narrow serpen- tine path which led them back to their village in the valley below. A touching in- cident, illustrat- ing the sentiment of gratitude, fol- lowed my efforts to give relief to a suffering baby. Some months later, I was surprised in the middle of the night by seeing a dark shadow cast upon the entrance of my tent. A woman s voice, hushed in tone, said to me;   Here, O white man. take thisegg  Many moons ago my baby suffered. You gave it medicine and it is well. I am a poor woman; 1 have nothing. But O take this egg   Mui h touched by her words I arose from my bed, accepted the egg, and placed it in one of my lx ots for safe-keeping. The following morning, whilst my cara- van was getting ready for the day s march, 1 gave the egg to my cook, instructing him to poach it for my breakfast. A few min- Le Sorcier. The Idol utes later he returned to me, holding in his hand a broken egg-shell, saying:  Master, that egg was a bad one   As a contrary illustration, I must cite the instance of a man who suffered from a form of skin disease. By dint of simple remedies I succeeded in purifying the man s blood, and, in fact, the patient proved so amena- ble to my treatment that at the end of a month I told him that he was perfectly cured and might go home.  Yes, O white man " he replied.  But Maker. what will you pay me  I have been with you many days, a whole moon has passed, what will you pay me for all that time   As an amusing instance of African hu- man nature I recall a native who visited me in my tent at dawn. He told me that he knew of the whereabouts of elephants. He led the way. After travelling several limes the distance he had previously indi- cated, 1 e. - x stulated with him for lying, and refused to go further. It was the early part of the afternoon. He replied: 457 458 The Real African  Oh, you had better comc on now  It is further for you to go back to your camp than it is to go where the elephants actually are.  An interesting friend ot mine was Lu- emba, living in the Cataract region of the Lower Congo; he once said philosophi- cally: '   I have worked for white men and have had much hardship. I have been flogged for making mistakes. I have had my pay stopped, anil 1 have seen much trouble.

What use is it for me to work  No  I will sleep.  In 1886, when proceeding to take com- mand of the Station of Bangala, a populous district of the Congo Independent State, one thousand miles in the interior, I trav- elled up the Upper Congo on board the sternwheel steamer Le Stanley, my compan- ions l eing Captain Deane, and Dr. Oscar Lentz, a well-known German scientist. Arriving late in the evening at a village called Lulungu, situated on the south bank, we applied to the people for provisions, for we had on board some four hundred native followers, a portion of whom were Houssa soldiers, these latter being attached to Cap- tain Deane, who was on his ill-fated jour- ney to take command of Stanley Falls Sta- tion. The Chief of Lulungu informed us that his people were in great trouble. They were at war with a neighboring village, and daily they had sustained heavy losses; in fact many of their people had been already captured and eaten, and they feared that they would very shortly be overpowered by the superior number of their adversaries. We held a palaver, and it was agreed that we should enter into the matter at sunrise. The following morning endeavors were made to parley with the chief of the hostile village. Spears were hurled at us, and our overtures were treated with derisive yells. Dividing the two villages a stockade had been formed about twelve feet high, com- posed of the sides of old canoes which had l een split lengthways. The Houssas fired a volley through the stockade, and Deane gave the word to rush forward. Clambering over the stockade, we fell on the opposite side in a confused mass, during which time the natives continued hurling spears at us, and firing occasional shots from their one or two llint-lock guns. For several minutes the scene was one of indescribable confusion, and the noise of shouting, shrieking savages had a peculiar awesome effect upon the nerves. After making two or three plucky stands, the warriors incontinently bolted to seek cover in the high grass of the neighboring swamp. In retiring they set fire to their village, and as a strong wind was blowing, the grass huts crackled and blazed until we found ourselves enveloped in sheets of flame. Stilled by the smoke, singed by the fire, and half-blinded, we suffered consider- able discomfort. A few minutes sufficed to convert the village into a mass of charred, smouldering sticks and poles. The Lulungu people immediately rushed toward the river, calling us to follow. There, attached to stakes, immersed to their chins in the water, we found four Lu- lungu captives in a pitiable plight. Follow- ing the habit of the country, their captors had subjected these j oor captives to a proress of soaking preparatory to their being killed and eaten. Throughout Central Africa one finds a remarkable system of communication be- tween villages by means of drum tapping. It is evidently of very ancient origin, and has been referred to as the forerunner of writing. Travelling through Africa, one s arrival is always anticipated by this means. The drum that is most commonly used for this purpose consists ot the segment of a hard red-wood tree, some six feet long and about two feet in diameter, the inside of which has been hollowed out by means of a small adze-shaped tool. This is a work which occupies much time and considera- ble patience. One side being left thicker than the other gives the means of produ- cing two distinct tones. I hey first  call  the town by a series of taps. They can argue, and they are able even in war time to communicate with their enemies and make terms. This ap- plies more particularly to the riverine tribes who, finding that sound travels better over water, are in the habit of taking their drums to the water s edge. Their signals are re- peated from one village to another. Lcs Cantus Seeing, they  cc not:  w1 hetrfng. they henr iwif, neither      they uiwJersraotL The drum is liealen by two wooden sticks capped by balls of rubber, and the system consists of irregular taps upon the two notes. In spite of all my efforts I was never able to acquire any practical infor- mation concerning their methods. But I can personally vouch for the wonderful ac- curacy with which they conveyed tidings and doings. By way of testing their powers I once asked for the despatch of a canoe manned by four men, to l e sent from a village on a distant shore. They duly shoved off, and after a few minutes I asked them to tele- graph that the canoe was too small, that they were to return, and that what I re- quired was a larger one with an increased number of men. Instantly the canoe re- turned to the shore, and a larger one set out more fully manned, my order being prompt- ly and perfectly executed. The natives frequently send word to each other by means of drum tapping, as to the whereabouts of elephants, hippopotami, or buffalo, and calling all hands to go and hunt them. They give the description of the place, so that all can meet together at a given spot and join the hunt. The natives become greatly excited by the booming of a drum; and it is a curious fact related by natives that chimpanzees in the forest have been noticed to have been af- fected by the rhythmical beating of a drum. On my passage home from Africa I travelled on board a Portuguese steamer. When within al out twelve hours  steam of the island of San Thome, which lies on the 459 400 The Real African equator, off Gaboon, we sighted a cap- sized boat. The weather had been rough, and a heavy sea was still running. We lowered a boat, which proceeded with diffi- culty toward the derelict. Our astonish- ment was great when we found that two Africans were clinging to the overturned boat. Soon we had them on l oard, two for- lorn men. who were quite exhausted. After a little rest and nourishment we succeeded in obtaining their story. They were both slaves, belonging to a cocoa plantation. Three days before they had attempted to esca  e from their cruel bondage in an oj en boat. Having no knowledge what- ever of their bearings they merely rowed, with true African unreasoning confidence, in the direction of the rising sun. They were caught by the storm, their boat was capsized, and they had passed three days clinging to the bottom of the boat without food of any description. Their survival was the more remarkable from the fact that the ocean in the vicinity of San Thome is one of the most shark- infested portions of the coast. We naturally felt great pity for them, and they were the recipients of various presents, including a very handsome clasp-knife. That same night there was a disturbance between these two men. It was discovered that the man who had received the clasp- knife was deliberately attempting to kill his comrade, and had already inflicted some- deep flesh wounds. The trouble arose from a spirit of envy. One man had been allotted a blue blanket and the other a red blanket, and the man with the clasp-knife was envious of his companion s blanket, which he preferred to his own. It was a deadly quarrel over a mere question of color. Living as we do, generation after gen- eration, in a condition of continuous pro- gression, surrounded by so much that is complicated and artificial in our lives, it is difficult for us to really understand what life means to the African savage who dwells in harmony with wild and unrestricted nature. With reference to the native s disregard for human life, it must be remembered that the motive does not always proceed from mere malignity of nature. Sometimes it is due to superstition, sometimes to fear. The people arc sometimes over-ready lo attack through dread of being attacked. They kill lest they should be killed. It is very true lhat a slight motive is often enough for taking human life, but that does not prevent them even the worst cannibal tribes from having a disposition that is in some respects amiable and very easily conciliated and amused. Human nature is always the same; it does not change. We all know' that there are ccrtain qualities indigenous to the hu- man mind. These identical qualities which we share with Africans should surely be re- garded, more than they are at present, as bonds of sympathy and conciliation in uni- ting men s affection for one another. That  untaught nature has no princi- ples  is a familiar axiom. In the case of the African savages, one is often too ready to estimate them as beings of nature, un- taught, a degraded race, without con- science or even scruples. True it is that so they appear, for they have none of those finer feelings or sentiments which are known to us as mercy or charity; but the result of intercourse with even the lowest types affords abundant testimony of their l eing in possession of an instinctive con- science. It is also true that they are nat- urally cruel, that they rob and murder and even eat the bodies of their fellow-men; but the fact must not be forgotten that they are not conscious of wrong in so doing. An African savage seldom does that which he feels intuitively to be wrong. The natives of Central Africa possess a clear intelligence within the limits of their own experience. Under the influence of good example they will surely relinquish their evil customs, tor their natures arc capable of belter things. It is as sure lhat they will improve under good guidance as it is unfortunately sure that Europeans of an inferior moral and intellectual standard, prompted by greed, who have been thrown among them have, in too many cases, as- similated a double measure of the native s lower qualities. T here must be hope for the future of a   eople who are so amen- able to kind and judicious treatment. We should always bear in mind that the sav- age of to-day serves to indicate to us how far we ourselves have advanced from a similarly primitive condition. It has been my experience that the longer one lives with Africans, the more one grows to love them. John Howard Payne  Va hington trving. CORRESPONDENCE OF WASHINGTON IRVING AND JOHN HOWARD PAYNE  1821-1828  Edited by Payne s Grandnephew, Thatcher T. Payne Luquer FIRST PAPER INTRODUCTION gjl  F- following letters are pub- lished for the first time. In preparing them for publication I have elimi- nated uninteresting por- tions, and have introduced only a few explanatory notes, leaving the let- ters, so far as possible, to tell their own tale. The letters from Irving to Payne came to me from my mother, who was a niece of John Howard Payne, being the only child of Payne s youngest brother, Thatcher. The letters from Payne to Irving are from letter copybooks which I secured sev- eral years ago at an auction sale in Phila- delphia of some of Payne s pajters. It was John Howard Payne s habit to preserve all letters he received and to re- tain copies, either written or impressed in social books, of all letters that he wrote, so that when he died in Tunis, in 1852, he left an accumulation of letters besides other manuscripts, which if they could have been preserved intact would have been now of great value and interest. Of Payne s numerous brothers and sis- ters only his oldest sister Lucy, the widow of Dr. John Cheever Osborn, and his young- 461 xSi7- Drury Lane Theatie cst brother, my grandfather, Thatcher T. Payne, survived him. The latter was an invalid, and was therefore obliged to attend to the settle- ment of his brother s estate by correspond- ence. The result was, his requests for information and his directions as to set- tlement were ignored, anti instead of the furniture anti library being sold to satisfy the claims against the estate, everything, including valuable paintings and all papers 462 and manuscripts, was sold or other- wise disposed of. and no accounting ever rendered. In 1S64, after the death of both Mrs. Osborn and my grandfather, my mother, who four years before had married my father. Rev. Lea Luquer, began a correspon- dence with Mr. Amos Perry of Rhode Island, then Consul at Tunis, who thor- oughly investigated the whole matter and advised her that the testimony of witnesses then living proved that, although the fur- niture, library, pictures, etc., had been sold, no manuscripts or letters had been offered at either of the sales, and that although most of the pa K rs had disappeared, he had discovered several boxes of them which had evidently been rejected as valueless. At my mother s request these boxes were for- M Talma a  Hamlet From a  uuuiiii  by 1. LoivxUlc, warded to her, and were the only effects she ever recovered from her uncle s estate. In one of these boxes were the Irving letters which form the basis of this article, besides fragments of diaries and other papers. Early in 1906 a sale of manuscripts, for- merly the proj erty of John Howard Payne, was advertised to take place in Philadelphia. Upon investigation I found the collection consisted of some remnants of Payne's most valuable scrap-books, manuscripts, and letters which had been so mysteriously- dispersed in Tunis, and that until quite recently they had been in the possession of the late Wm. Penn Chandler, the Con- sul at Tunis who succeeded Pavne. Be- cause of the many years elapsing since these papers had disappeared, it was not possible to recover them by process of law, so I attended the sale and bought such of the letter-books, scrap-books, etc., as I cared for. In the letter-books I found copies of Payne s replies to many of Irving's R. W. KUiiton.  ini  uiaua vi of the Lhuiy 1-ane IbcAirc- Charles Kemble. letters, as well as cop- ies of letters to others on the same subjects, which, taken together form a nearly com- plete narrative. I have also introduced a few other letters which help to illus- trate the trials and tribulations of play production, about which the correspon- dence centres. The translating and adapting of plays for the English stage was taken up experimen- tally by Irving, but was followed for some years by Payne as a profession, and their association in this work as revealed in this correspondence is an in- teresting feature of their friendship. This friendship probably began in 1806, when Irving was a young man of twenty-three and Payne a precocious boy of fifteen. Irving had been abroad for two years travelling in search of health, and returned to New York early in that year to resume his place in the coterie of youthful writers and young men about town, of which he was a brilliant member, and which included his brother Peter and his brother-in-law Paulding. 463 Correspondence of Irving and Payne l ayne had come to New V ork from Boston the previous year to take a position in his late brother William's business office, which his father s financial difficulties made necessary. Unfitted though he was for business pursuits, his precocious literary and social talents attracted the attention of several men prominent intellectually and John Howard Payne. From   vr4tof  ol ir       kr i  socially, and resulted in his introduction into the literary society of the day at an un- usually youthful age. It was undoubtedly at one of these   Bohemian  gatherings that he first met Irving. Payne in his dedi- cation of   Richelieu,  the play whose vicissitudes are so fully descril ed in these letters, and which was finally produced and published in 1826, mentions their friend- ship as of twenty years' standing. However, it is not probable that their friendship progressed much beyond the bounds of acquaintance for some years, for in June, 1806, Payne was sent to Union College, and remained there until 1808, when his father s business failure compelled him to leave and do something for the fam- ily support. His talents and inclination in- dicated probable success in a stage career, and having secured an engagement, he made his debut at the Park Theatre in New York, in February, 1 Sog. As the   Americ an Ros- cius  he had great success, and notes in his diarv, on the first anniversary of his debut, that  his profits for the year had been Si0.000, which had enabled him to relieve his father s financial difficulties, and at the same time provide himself with a good equipment for his professional career. His jjopularity, however, did not increase, and although his career was reasonably John Howard Payne. 1'nittiol on bury by  Vo xl successful, he determined in 1812 totryfresh fields, and sailed for Fngland to seek his fort- une in the London theatres. During the three years of Payne s life as an actor in America, he undoubtedly re- newed and cultivated his friendship with Irving and his brother Peter, for both had a liking for actors and the stage, and it is evident from a letter or two I have from Peter Irving to Payne, just after Payne ar- rived in London, that their acquaintance at that time was one of cordial intimacy, although Irving had been in Kngland for a year or two. Payne s career on the English stage was a repetition of his career on the American stage, his popularity not increasing with passing time, for as he grew older he lost something of his lx yish beauty, and his talent as a man was not so unusual and ap- pealing as the same talent in a youth. His diminishing fortune as an actor, therefore, inclined him to other pursuits, Correspondence of Irving and Payne and in 1815, on the advice of a friend, he translated and adapted a French play which was successfully produced at Drury Lane, under the title of  The Maid and the Magpie.  For the next fifteen years, until his re- turn to America, he devoted himself mostly to this kind of work, dividing his time be- tween London and Paris, according to the varied necessities of producing and market- ing his wares, and the state of bis pocket- book. In 1819-20 he attempted the manage- ment of Sadler s Wells Theatre, and failing disastrously was, in accordance with the illogical system of the time, imprisoned in the debtors  section of the Fleet, until a successful adaptation of a French play  Therfcse,  produced at Drury Lane, pro- vided funds for his release. In 1823 while in Paris under contract to supply operas and plays to Covent Garden, he wrote the libretto for an operetta,  Clari,  the music being furnished by Sir Henry Bishop. A song 1 icing later re- quired for one scene in the opera, he wrote  Home Sweet Home,  and suggested the music which Bishop so well fitted to the words. So much briefly as to Payne s career up to the time of these letters. Irving during the same period also passed through many trials and experi- ences. He had made his reputation as an author by the  Knickerbocker History of New York,  published in 1809. which so pleased his brothers that in order to pro- vide means for Washington to fully develop his literary talents, they organized a com- pany with Washington as a sort of sleeping partner, arranging for him to share in the earnings without having to devote much time to business. The company s affairs prospered at first, but were so badly affected by the War of 1812 that Washington Irving was compelled to go over after peace was declared in 1815 to try to help Peter save the company from disaster. This he was unable to accomplish, and they were obliged in 181S to go into bankruptcy. These mat- ters had taken so much of his attention that for some years Washington Irving had not had time for writing, but when relieved from his business worries, he went back to his literary work with renewed energy, and speedily enhanced his reputation and re- Vol. XLVIII. 44 plenished his coffers by the publication of the  Sketch Book  and "Bracebridge Hall,  the latter soon after this corre- spondence begins. That these two men should have drifted into close friendship is not strange, for they were fellow-countrymen in a foreign land, had mutual friends, similar tastes, and were both striving to make their living by the  x:n. The first letter is not dated and there is no clew as to the period when it was written other than that it was at a time when Irving and Payne were both in London, and one of Payne s plays was soon to have its first production. It is written on a piece of paper torn from a letter to Payne from James O Leary, which Irving found at Payne s lodgings. The next three letters were written before Irving began his attempts at play writing, but show his keen interest in Payne s affairs, and his friendly efforts to help the latter on in his literary career. Payne had gone over to Paris in 1821, as soon as he had compounded with his credi- tors and had been released from the Fleet. Irving was in Paris also that year until the 11th of July, returning to London for the coronation of George IV. Irving in his diary mentions Payne as at this time occupying  the first floor of a small house in a garden,  and goes with him to call on Talma. He also notes that  Payne is full of dramatic projects, and some that are very feasible.  Thatcher T. Payne Luquer.

My dear Payne: I rec 1 your letter of 16th July about the 23d or 24th but have been looking out in vain for the parcel containing the dramatic piece.1 It has not as yet come to hand. I had intended before this to have gone to my sisters, in the country but have remained in town in daily expectation of the arrival of the parcel. I wish you would enquire after it, and forward it without delay, to the above address. I called on Hazlitt2 a day or two after my arrival.

Though of course they would not want above half a sheet, say 8 pages from one author per month, as they like to have a variety of styles and authors. He told me he would either call on me or write to me after he had seen Taylor   Hessey. I have heard nothing from him as yet. As to your wish respecting Mr. Rush  I do not know whether I shall ever have an opportunity of talking freely enough with him to make the suggestion.

My dear Payne: I have rec   your letter of Aug. 12th. Your piece   The Borrower   came to hand the day after I last wrote to you; having been lying at the office where the Ambassador s Bag is opened, the packet being considered too large to send by the twopenny post. I am sorry to say that I have not been able to do any thing with it. I saw EUiston the morning after I received it. He read the piece that same day, and got George Lamb1 to read it. I saw him by appointment the same evening behind the scenes; but he said it would not do. It would be considered an imitation of Diddler.2 He regretted the thing extreme- ly, as he wished to serve you, and he was particularly in want of a small piece, just at that time, to precede his coronation spec- tacle. The latter I know to be the case, as to the former you are the best judge. He was extremely civil and put me on his free list. I find by his talk that he has an agent in Paris at a weekly salary. I forget his name. I then got Miller  to offer the piece at the Haymarket  the covent garden theatre being closed . I should have offered it myself in person but Terry  has never had the civility to respond to some ad- vances I once made to his acquaintance. I told Miller however to use my name as sending and recommending the piece. I heard nothing further until last evening, 1 George Lamb  1784-18.54 , politician an l dramatic critic.

Last evening I recd the piece with a note from Little Miller who says:   I received the Farce from Mr. Terr - yesterday. He had previously writ- ten to me to say that he had read it very carefully, but that his opinion was that it would not be successful on representation. He regretted this, because they want one act pieces at the Haymarket theatre, and I re- gret it because I should have been glad to have been serviceable to the author.  I know, from other sources, that they are much in want of attractive novelties at the Haymarket. Hazlitt has gone out of town without letting me hear from him on the subject of the Magazine; though he had frequently promised to do so. I feel extremely chagrined at not being able to give you more profitable reports; but I hope that the pieces which you have sent to Mrs. Glover  may be more success- ful. Should she be out of town, and the pieces be sent to me I will try to do some- thing with them. I intend leaving town myself however, in the course of four or five days, as I am anxious to see my sister2 and her family. When I return to town I will let you know; and I hope I may then be able to render you more effectual service. I am terribly hampered and tied up at pres- ent; being anxious to get something ready for the press, but not being able to com- mand my time and my mind sufficiently to do anything. I am therefore in that uncom- fortable state of being neither able to em- ploy my time for myself, nor to spare it for others. Staying home to write, but not lieing able to get my thoughts home enough for the purpose. You suggested in your first letter that I should write something about N.

My dkar Irvin'g: If I could convey to you any idea of the pleasure it gave me to find you still remem- bered there was such a being, it would, I am sure, be some recompence for the trouble of which I have unknowingly been the cause. I am so isolated, and my feel- ings are l ecomc so distempered by annoy- ance, that these electrical thrills of early and national association, are at times the only things that can revive the consciousness that I belong to a world and have my friends and my relations and my coun- try, like other people.  I am unused to any sudden touch of joy and it o er-comes me.  I only got your letter at noon this day. There is a gentleman going ofT tomorrow morning at six, and I have only just seen him;  8 in the evening  so, as 1 must be at his Hotel with my letters at eleven, T must be brief, for which, no doubt, you will feel not a little grateful. First, with regard to the magazines. I send a M.S.S. which I chanced to have by me. It is a free translation but make no ceremony about it, if you think it wont do. If it will, you can take anything you can get for it, no matter how little. I will write an article on the Theatres and try and send it to you in a few days, as Kenny talks of go- ing over in a week, or so. I think a regu- lar number to be called  The Story Tel- ler,  or some name of that sort, might be  kept up in a Magazine, making an intro- duction, and giving a monthly portion to the extent of what I now send. The little Talcs I have mentioned would be very easily done. You will be able, from the M.S.S. to tell me how much of such writing would make a sheet; and that will be a guide as to measure. I think the little scraps of jeu d csprit and anecdote, of which every magazine and paper here has at least half a column, if judiciously se- lected, and thrown into one focus, would make another excellent  H. rmanent and spirituelle contribution, to be headed "Flashes  or  Sparkles  or anything you like. The analyses will be more difficult and expensive, as I must first buy the books and then read them, two important opera- tions; and what may lie yet more difficult in many cases, I must understand them too, which is more than their writers can, some- times; but this I will try as soon as 1 can get a little before hand in money matters. You know the history of my correspond- ence last summer with Klliston. He tried to fool me. 1 saw his scheme; I insisted on his being explicit, then he bccamc silent. My wants forced me to overlook one or two indignities; and I sent him two pieces which happened to meet his wants at the moment. He took them on his own terms. He was to pay me for a week s work and then employed me three months without pay into the bargain. I gave  Love in Humble Life  for  a promise of   20down, and  Adeline  for  30 the copyright and  15 every third night, till it should reach joo guineas. I ho  c you will excuse me for asking you to call on Klliston for me, and to endeavour to impress upon him the necessity of letdng me have my money. I enclose a draft, which, if he makes any difficulty, it would Correspondence of Irving and Payne 409 be well to get him to accept, and perhaps Miller might get it discounted.

Faubourg St. Germain, Paris. London June 8   182 . My dear Payne: I have suffered an enormous time to elapse without writing to you; but in truth I am behindhand with all my friends and have suffered such an amount of epistolary debts to accumulate that I am almost in despair of paying even the interest. Miller has no doubt told you long since of the suc- cess or rather want of success with Klliston. I called on him twicc without seeing him, and being unwell   lame at the time I had to commit the matter to Miller. Klliston did not pretend to dispute your claims but plead  K verty and incapacity to pay. The last time I saw him he told me he had been paying you off in weekly sums to Mrs. Glover, so I suppose the debt is liquidated before this. He appeared to be rather sore at your having dunned him through others;   thought it was rather exposing the naked- ness of the Land. I do not think it worth your while to deal with him hereafter. As Covent Garden is in new hands you might be able to get your pieces brought out there;   Charles Kemble who is at the head of the management is a gentleman and a man to be depended upon. The manuscript you sent me I could not get any thing for at the London Magazines to which I applied. They thought the stories had not sufficient interest   point   would prefer something not so merely translation. Hesscy one of the proprietors of the Lon- don Mag: would like to have something from you entirely original   would then judge how much he could afford to give per sheet. I could do nothing with the plan you proposed about republishing litho- graphic plates of Bonapartcs history with accompanying details. There has been so much published about Bonaparte that the public is rather sated with the subject;   the expense of the prints  c. would not be paid, by the additional sale. I had hoped to have received from ycu the theatrical essay which you promised to send by Kenney1; but Kenney has never arrived and whether or no the manuscript is sleeping in his pocket at Paris I cannot say. I should think you might do some- thing very good in that line. I want to see you swimming without corks throwing by translations and reconstructions and writ- ing something from your own brain. A set of essays, tales  c. taken from your own dramatic experience   invention would be more likely to succeed than any thing you could translate. I have published a couple of volumes1 lately, which seem to be well received. The getting them ready for the press has been a grievous task for me, as I have been out of health ever since my return to Kng- land. The confinement of body   task- ing of mind necessary for composition have retarded my recovery and I am still sub- ject to lameness   to inflammation in my legs. I shall leave London in the course of a week or two, for a watering place on the continent probably Aix La Chapelle, and shall see you in Paris towards the latter part of the autumn. Before I go out of town I will have a talk with Charles Kemble about you, as I am on very good terms with him, and I will en- deavour to secure a favourable reception for any thing you may send to his theatre.

His success in disposing of  Clari  and two plays,  Ali Pacha  and  The Two   alley Slaves,  to Covent Garden in March encouraged him to rent a cottage at Versailles, where he could work undis- turbed, using the apartment in the Palais Royal as an office. The cottage had a large garden and the rent was fifty dollars for nine months. Later he gave up his Versailles cottage, and rented apartments in the rue Richelieu No. 89, which he sub- let to Irving except for one room which he reserved for his own use when in Paris. .1 ddrcsscd' Monsieur Howard Payne, Palais Royal No. 156, a Paris Havre, Sept. 2  h 1825.

My dear Mr. Payne I would willingly lend you the sum you stand in need of, if I possessed it; but I am sorry to say, a poorer man lives not in Eng- land than myself which you will easily conceive when I tell you that I have four children whose education drains me of every penny I can scrape together. I have applied to my Co-partners to advance the money; but their answer is they have it not: and this I know to be true also; for our Houses in spite of all the expense we have been at, this Summer, are very in- different, and it is but sorry consolation to know that the receipts of Drury have been infinitely worse than ours. If we should improve, which I trust we shall shortly, I will make another application to   The Committee  and I will hope with better success, if your Farce be ready, dont you think it will be better to send it, than wait for Azendai or Richelieu  if   The Com- mittee  like it, I am of opinion, that it stands a chance of being brought out at no distant period. I saw Poole the other day; but he did not say that he was employed about anything for the Theatres. Kenney did not take ill my not seeing him while I was in Paris, I hope pray excuse me to him on the score of the shortness of my visit and remember me most kindly to Talma.

About the first of November, Payne goes over to London to try and dispose of the plays in hand, but is obliged to conceal his identity under the assumed name of J. Hayward to avoid his creditors.

My dear Payne: I rec l your unhappy letter from Dieppe   deeply commiserate your situation but hope by this time you are safe over the channel and over your troubles. Nothing new has happened here of any consequence. Your Lamp case was ably argued before the Justice by Marianne, and compromised for 20 francs so I think both you and the Lampist got very well out of the affair. I hope you will not get another lamp mania, unless you have a chance of getting hold of the Lamp of Alladin. Your dog dirtied himself out of all toleration so I have sent him into exile. Marianne told me you were to give 15 francs a month to some Dog Landlord on the Pont neuf to take him en pension which was paying enough to sup- port a Christian soul and fifteen francs more than the dog was worth luckily the scoun- drel who had the impudence to make such a demand was not at home when Marianne called, so you are saved this piece of imj osi- tion. . . . The chimneys smoked and have all been bedevilled by the fumiste, so that I suppose they will smoke worse than ever; being what the French term perfectiones. Your room has been painted and papered under the directions of the indefatigable Marianne  : thus your household mat- ters all go on in good train. I expect my brother in town tomorrow to pass the winter   am turning the Salle a Manger into a bed room for him.

My dear Payne: Your letter of the 7    relieved me from the most painful anxiety on your account for the long time that had elapsed without hearing from you, and the terrible storms that had taken place in the interim made me fear that some misfortune had happened to you in crossing the channel. I shall now look forward with a less pain- ful interest to your next letters, to know the fate of the dramatic experiments. Let me know, if Azendai is approved, about what time it will be wanted I shall write songs for it as soon as 1 can get in the rhyming vein again. I believe I told you that I had rewritten Henry V tho  somewhat hastily. It will now I think make a very pleasing drama, with the assistance of a few songs  to make it a complete opera would be very difficult.

I 1 eg leave to re- 473 474 Correspondence of Irving and Payne turn my best thanks for the offer it conveys respecting the Trag- edy submitted to their decision.

The value of a production to such an establishment in pounds, shillings and pence, ap  ears to me the only   oint admis sible in such discus- sions. The quality of literary desert is for another tribunal. Still, could 1 afford to sacrifice the work in question for so very much under the allow- Jaincs Kenney a nee established by the law of theatrical custom. I should do so with peculiar pleasure to the Man- agement of Co vent Garden Theatre, equally through grat- itude for recent po- liteness and because the character of Rich- elieu has been mould- ed with distinct refer- ence to Mr. Charles Kemble, whose talent would give it a value it might no where else obtain. But this sacrifice my circum- stances forbid: and I am sorry to add that it will be entirely out of my power to leave the work in question upon any other terms than those which Mr. OL.  i__      '   - r  r 9 - S --- - -  .    ..

Don t cry out before you re hurt, nor send conjectural bad news, for want of real all seems to be going very well Kemble has ac- cepted Richelieu in as short a time as could Mrs. Glover  Infrared by T.

On second thoughts this morning I have cut down Azendai to two acts. They arc long ones, but I think the dialogue and incident will carry them off cheerfully. I shall not add any songs I cannot bestow any more labour on the piece particularly as it is now a two act piece. I would not have touched it again but that I wish to have a chance of trying whether I really have dra- matic talent. The piece can be embel- lished with marches and melodramatic music. If you have time copy it and offer it at which ever theatre you think it would fare best at or be most likely to be readily and handsomely received. I think you are unreasonably piqued with Elliston a thousand circumstances might have happened to have hurried him suddenly out of town, without recollecting his engagement with you recollect what a hurried being a manager is and what a har- ried head Elliston has. If you do not like to present any thing to him let Miller pre- sent it. Do not mention to Elliston  should it be presented to him that I am the author of Azendai. There is no need of his knowing it say it is from a friend. I hope vou will be able to raise funds on some one or other of the pieces to enable you to hold out for better terms for Riche- iieu but at any rate do exactly with re- spect to that play as you may feel inclined. If you see Newton tell him should Mr. 47S Correspondence of Irving and Payne Murray' deliver to him the parcel I wrote about I would thank him to forward it to me by coach unless you are coming off immediately   will bring it with you.

My dkar Payne: 1 recd some days since your play by Mr. Sinnett. It has the materials within it to make a most beautiful   attractive piece   one that will do you great credit. 1 have been at work at it   have, as you will think, slashed away unsparingly, but it is excessively redundant and requires to be pruned in language, scenes   plot. I have cut many things out of it that are good in themselves   may be put by for future use; . but which overcharge the dialogue and em- barrass the action. It will take me yet two or three days to put it in order   then I trust it will be a thing that will take at once with the managers. It varies so much from the original that you may lay claims to absolute authorship in it, and as you need not fear being jostled in this piece by rival adapters, I hoj e you will take care to make a good bargain. I cannot tell you how much satisfaction I feel in seeing you turn such a good piece of work out of your hands. . . . I have paid the rent of the apartments for the current term: that is to say till the end of march; but absolutely I shall have to give them up at the end of that time as I shall take apartments before the close of the term in the country. I wish you would think what s to be done with them as I see no prospect of your return. I have kept on from term to term, because I did not like to abandon the apartment and leave it vacant, but in many respects it does not suit me; and its position in the midst of dirty streets prevents my taking the exercise in winter that is necessary to my health. If I re- mained in Paris I should like to be near the Tuilleries. When you finish Perkin Warbeck let me see it I may do you some good in correct- ing it. I am happy to find you are so well employed; but let me again and again press on you the importance of management in your ex  enses: that you may make your industry available. You have it in your power to make twice three times as much as you need to spend; but through a little mismanagement you are continually toiling to make up foregone   needless expenses. I trust you will arrange your affairs better in future   getting yourself once out of the mire will jog on your way comfortably and   reditably. I may bore you a little by the iteration of this topic, but I trust you will properly understand the motive which dic- tates it not a love of finding fault or a desire to wound your feelings, but a sincere and earnest wish for your welfare. Mr. Sinnett is Waiting for the letter so 1 must conclude. Yours very truly, m j Paris Jan. 17, 1824. In Irving s biography it is stated that on January 27, 1824, Payne wrote to Irving that he had sold  Charles II  and Riche- lieu to Covent Garden Theatre for two hun- dred guineas, and that as Irving s letters were missing, it was not known whether the price was satisfactory to Irving or not. The missing letter follows and indicates that the profits from the venture did not encour- age Irving to continue his dramatic work. Addressed: J. H.

Rue Richelieu No. So My dear Payne: I wrote to you yesterday inclosing a letter from Marianne. Since then I have ret 1 your letter inclosing a Bank note of 5o   which shall be disposed of according to your wishes. I am perfectly satisfied that you have done your best as to the Mss: I only re- gret that you did not find more liberality on the part of those you dealt with. Still I 480 Correspondence of Irving and Payne am convinced the operation will turn out very beneficial for you if you manage mat- ters properly. . . . Richelieu   Rochester if tolerably performed will do you credit   operate favorably for you in future dealings. You must not hesitate to claim them as your productions; though to satisfy scruple   obviate cavilling you may say they have been revised   occasionally touched up by a literary friend I wish however, my name to be kept completely out of sight. I am sorry to say I cannot afford to write any more for the theatres. The experi- ment has satisfied me that I never should in any wise be compensated for my time and trouble. I speak not with any refer- ence to my talents; but to the market price my productions will command in other de- partments of literature. If, however, the experiment should produce any material benefit to you 1 shall feel highly satisfied at having made it. Of the German pieces only one has ar- rived called Partey-Wulh  or Party Rage  The scene in England in 1651, during the time of the covenanters. I saw it acted at Prague   was very much struck with it  on reading it over I am still more pleased  u. very striking and spirited play might be made from it; with strongly marked char- acters. There is a coldblooded, crafty, mea- gre, hypocritical, merciless Judge with his coadjutor, a gorbellied, bullying, swash buckler colonel of the covenanters, that make two prominent, half comic, half fear- ful characters in the piece. Had I been encouraged by the success of Richelieu I could have made a powerful piece of this  but, as it is, I cannot afford to touch it.

My dear Payne: I have not heard from you for a long long time, and have been looking every week either  or a letter, or for your arrival. I hope you arc turning your lime to account in l ondon. I see by one of the papers lhat a piece was playing at the Adelphi under the title of Waggeries at Wapping. I hope they have not   een pirating your Mss. and playing a theatrical trick upon you. Everything goes on here as usual. I have been occupicd in scribbling   have just made an engagement with the Gal- ignanis   Didot to edit a series of British Literature, from Chaucer to the present day, which I hope will bring me in some funds of which I begin to be in want. I think of coming to Ixindon shortly. Do you wish for any thing from here any thing that is not bulky as I shall probably travel in the mail post that j ermits but little luggage. I shall look out if there are any novelties at the theatres that may be uf service to you. Correspondence of Irving and Payne 481 Before I leave paris I shall settle with Mons.

Addressed: Mr. Hayward, Lancaster Court, Burton Crescent. Paris, March a8'  182.4. My dear Payne: I have just rec1  your two letters. I am sorry to find you writing in dumpiest mood; but dont let yourself be cast down. Gad man, you ve made a little lump of money since last autumn; and if it has been rather sopped up by old debts what s to prevent your making more. When the plays come to be acted you will make something more by the copy right, and I m convinced they ll propose better terms for your next pieces. As to the German piece I think if you do not offer it until Richelieu has been acted you will get a good offer for it. I ll give it a look over before you hand it to managers   perhaps I may be able to improve it in some points for you. Not that I mean lo participate in the profits. I cannot afford to work for the theatre with sufficient zeal to entitle me to any reward, but I may help you to an occasional hint or a coup dc plume. There is a melodrama lately come out, which seems to have a run called Mel- j'tonin, the lesser and manager of Uic Haymarket neairc, lUao-jj. His sister Clara married George Coiman. moth the wanderer, founded I believe on M- s novel. I ll get it for you   one or two other things. When I get to Lon- don I may be able some time or other, to get some employment for you from the booksellers. In the meantime live pru- dently   dont give way to doubts   fears. I shall not be able to come to London quite so soon as 1 anticipated. I have two or three other things that require my atten- tion here, and some writing that 1 must pre- pare here, before I venture into the hurried whirl of London. If you get the money for me from the theatre 1 wish you to remit it, as it will as- sist me toward my travelling expenses, for my purse is running low. Of course you take your proportion first. I do not know whether Morris is in Paris or not but 1 believe not. I have not told any thing to Kenney about the pieces. You recollect you mentioned to him my having revised and I believe retouched Rochester. He knows nothing more than you have told him.

My dear Payne. I have put off from time to lime my visit to Kngland, having been variously engaged. I shall leave here, however, in about six days, but shall not come immediately to London. 1 go by the way of Havre   Southampton   shall pass two or three weeks with a friend in new Hampshire, not far from Southampton. I am glad they intend bringing out Rochester as it will enable you to get it into print and make something by the copy right. And if il succeeds as I hope it will, it will lie of great service to you in respect lo your other theatrical merchandize. I hope you will not dispose of   Parlcgcn Wulir till I have seen it, as I may suggest alterations that may be of service to it. I 482 At the Fourth Flag shall bring over with me any new pieces lhat I may think will be of service to you. I have not seen Kenney for a long time: he is still at Versailles. I do not know whether to condole with, or to congratulate you upon missing the management. I look upon all employ- ments of the kind as full of perplexity and vexation, and am sure that with a little economy   management of your own con- cerns you can live independently   com- fortably by the exercise of your pen. So long as I could make bread and cheese in my own way. I would not bother my mind with the miseries of a theatrical man- agement even though it should enable me to eat truffles   ortolans. After receiving this letter you need not write to me at Paris, as a letter will not find me there. I leave my Brother in the apart- ments. When 1 get to England you shall hear further from me and when I get to Lon- don I will find you out in your hermitage. Yours ever W. I.

Down him and risk your neck ixrside  Win hut one Rodham Steeplechase  A. Fosihck, " Rodham Rhymes." I HEN, after some months of absence, Cantyre reap- peared at the club, all Rod- ham talked. When he entered his name for the. annual steeplechase, there were rejoicings, and it became speedily and generally accepted that he had come to the philosophic conclusion that there were good fish in the sea as e er came out of it, and was on the high road to recovery from his recent jilting. True, he all but cut poor Basely, his successful rival; and at the club, on the entry of Rose Gallard on one oc- casion, stopped short in the middle of a sentence and walked brusquely from the room.   Fact is,   declared old Murray,    it s the first time in his life that Gus Cantyre was ever an  also ran.  When a fellow gets to be eight-and-twenty without ever missing a thing he wants, and then wants some- thing more than ever he did before in his life, and closes his fist on it to find it gone, he cuts up rough. Naturally   He needn't have cold-shouldered Base- ly as he did, all the same,  protested Fos- dick, Ix-neath whose habitual laughter and fondness for good clothes lay a very genu- ine sense of justice.   I don't say that out of fondness for Basely, either, but because 1 like Cantyre.  "Humph   ejaculated Murray, strad- dling before the empty fireplace.  Trou- ble is, Gus has a queer way with him, once and again. You boys don t remember her, but his mother was like that before him. 1 remember five-and-twenty years back  she fell in a rage at some perfectly harmless remark of Handrevel s at a dance. Grew white as a sheet, sir, and took leave of her hostess on the spot. Called her carriage, and sulked for half the season. Old Can- tyre told Handrevel he was doosed sorry: pretty rough on him. As for madamc la reine, she never spoke to him again not once  Humph   On all that related to hunting, to horses, to the intricacies of social life, Tennant Murray, M.F.H., delivered his opinions with a readiness and a conviction which the younger set at Rodham Country Club open- ly derided, and secretly admired.   I ll bet you saints to devils,  cried Hailey,  that Gus Cantyre wins the race. Tarven's staying with him, and he told me that Gus had Masliatlafi at timber every At the Fourth Flag 483 day for two weeks past. It would be a jolly'good thing if Basely s Seminole should run him out. Gus is always winning things.   Seminole is good stuff,  Fosdick re- marked.  Humph   And as he spoke again Murray s manner was more judicial, and his neatly booted legs were straddled more widely than ever.  It s not horses that win steeplechases; it s horses and men. Cantyre s got the best seat and the l esi hands of any man-jack in this club. Doose take it, he rides better n  do   The snort of amazement with which the veteran em- phasized this last statement was drowned in a shout of laughter from his hearers. Upon the spot, they began to wrangle cheer- fully upon the technicalities of  'horse.  II Two men, the collars of their cover- coats turned up against the spring shower that was visiting the countryside, were trotting together over the level bottom of a wide pasture to where, planted on a boundary wall of loose stones, stood a soaked red flag. One of the riders was mounted on a smart bay pony, whose white forelegs were plashed with clay. The horseman was a young man, very blonde, very' red-faced, and well wetted about the knees and shoulders. The brim of his gray felt hat was turned down all around, and the rain dripped from it at each stride. His companion, a taller man riding a large gray, was of a type altogether different. Of loose build, there was yet about him an air of strength and of physical adroitness which went well with his easy and sympathetic horsemanship. Under the shadow of his glistening  Burberv  one saw a striking face: a face thin and brown, with a hawk-like nose, fierce, humorous eyes of dark blue, high cheek-bones, and a sensitive, mobile chin. The close-trimmed black mustache did not conceal the wide and full-lipped mouth. The whole face was at once predatory and good-naturedly wilful. Just now, beneath the eyes which stared fixedly ahead, were dark circles, and the mouth was slightly  drawn. " I say, Gus,  suddenly exclaimed he of the pony,  those flags are too far down the wall. What the deuce  The ditch must be a good twelve foot on the other side of the wall there, and about eight feet deep  Why hasn't the Committee flagged a jump at the corner, where it s narrower   He turned toward his companion with a ques- tioning look.   Give it up   answered the other, staring at the flag.  Some of old Murray s rot- ten nonsense, I dare say. I must admit, though, the other obstacles on this course are tame enough.  The riders pulled up by the wall. They had trotted from one point to another of the course in preparation for the coming steeplechase, and but for this flag the fourth had already examined each obsta- cle. As they drew rein beside the wall, they looked with interest and some surprise at the jump. On the other side of the fence itself about four feet high was a deep trench cut in the stiff clay. Although at its upper end, where the flat ground be- gan to rise, the cutting was narrow, yet at the flagged point it was four yards wide, and the nearer edge was another yard from the wall. Its banks were steep and slippery; into the thin sheet of yellow water at the bot- tom the big rain drops splashed steadily.  Something s going to get smashed here-away,  remarked the last speaker,   sure as your name s Dicky Tarven, the Man-without-Hands.  He gazed across the wall into the ditch, regarding the situation with a smile of grim humor. Mr. Dicky Tarven, after due consideration, acknowledged the justice of his friend s allusion to his  hard  hands by letting his remark go without challenge.   Beastly jump this  his expression was doleful  it s all well enough for you, Cantyre. es-que.; but I likes my fencing and 1 likes my leppin , and I likes  em sep rit and individlc  This yere flag needs a cross between buzzard and kangaroo to get over it.   Bad for little horses and little hind- legs,  admitted Cantyre, slatting the water from his hat.   I wish I had a tape,  grumbled Tarven, turning his  K ny s head, and casting a last glance of disgust at the jump.  Some- body ll get smashed up there; you ll see. Myself, like as not     Quite so,  said Cantyre with a queer smile.  Made your will   484 At the Fourth Flag  Get on   shouted his indignant friend, cutting the other s mount with his crop.  Will be damned   Ill It was one o clock in the night after he had ridden over the course with Tarvcn that Cantyre gave up trying to sleep. For two hours he had lain in the dark, trying to empty his head of tumultuous thoughts. Time after time he had relaxed every mus- cle, and closed his eyes, only to realize after a few moments that he was lying in bed with hands tight clenched, ter.se as a wrestler. At length, filled with disgust, he rose. For the past three months he had had, he thought wretchedly, quite his share of this. He was to-night vividly conscious of his own unhappiness, and with a wave of bitterness indulged himself in a feeling of self-pity which hitherto he had been able to repress. He had no faith at that hour in his doctor s prescription, given him a fort- night back in reply to his somewhat savage statement that he could not sleep.   Ride, and ride hard   had been the order.  You re used to it, and can t afford to give it up especially to spend your days in brooding.  The advice had been followed; it was on the strength of it that he had gone back to the club, and entered Mashallah for the steeplechase. But the charm would not work, or at best worked intermittently. He lit the brace of reading candles by his liedside, and then, having blown out the match, stood for a minute in his pajamas, delil erating. His eye fell on a copy of  Jorrock s Jaunts and Jollities ; but the doings of Mr. Jorrook are after all not so very jolly when one is keeping unwilling vigil with an old and galling worry for company. Cantyre went to the round table in the middle of the room, and coming back with a solitaire board and a pack of cards, propped himself up on his pillows and began to play. In the middle of the game, however, he perceived that some four or five plays back he had mistaken a card and spoiled his play. He took the accident with the air of one welcoming a new griev- ance, throwing the cards together and re- shuffling them with a grunt of irritation, lie began again: ' Knave on the queen, and red ten on the knave Would she have given him up, he wondered, if she had really understood   Turn up ace of clubs; sjx three  But how the deuce could she know when he himself had not realized the depth of his own feeling  Two on the three  No, confound it  both were black  Did any one ever s  e such a run of cards   Basely  Basely hadn't known her more than a year     With a feeling of mixed pain and satisfaction at his own fairness, Cantyre admitted lhat   Basely was a very decent sort; but could Basely possibly care as much as he did  How much sleep would he be losing if Rose Gallard should throw him overboard in his turn  No fear of that, though seven, six, five, and the four of hearts wanted. The beastly in. justicc of it weren t there enough women to go round, or what   Here Cantyre observed that two cards which, when he played them, had certainly been the ten of spades and the nine of diamonds had wil- fully become the six and seven of hearts. He gave up his game in a rage. Getting up, he took a cigarette from a box on the table, lit it at the candle, and began to walk up and down the room. The bitter feeling of defeat and loss which he had insensibly allowed to grow up within him during the past few weeks so mastered him as to blind him to the fact that in reality his love was overborne by his anger at failing to obtain a thing he wanted. Circumstance and temperament alike made him look upon Rose Gallard s preference of another as a gigantic injury done upon himself. From time to time his sense of humor protested feebly against his unreason, but to no purpose. As he finished his cigarette, he was startled by a knock on the door of his chamber.  Who s there   he asked. He had for- gotten his guest from the moment he bade him good-night.  What's wrong, Gus   asked Tarven. putting his head in at the door by way of answer.  What fetched you out of bed, Dicky    Heard you walking up and down,  Tarven replied.   Felt you thinking through the wall. Did you know you were almost running up and down  I thought you d gone bunchy or started on a rat hunt  Don t look at me like that, old man take a big, deep breath, and tell me all about it.  Dicky Tarven s ways, as old Murray had once said with more than ordinary empha  Cantyre. on the entry of Ro e GaUard on one occasion, walked brusquely frum the roura Page iSj sis. were those of a school-boy. His speech and aspect were permanently sophomoric. But there were half a dozen men with whom this manner went for nothing, once they had seen the simple, sympathetic manliness of heart that underlay it. Can- tyre was by way of liking Tarven; but he was a man of rare confidences, and not of the half-dozen: yet he felt the comfort of his guest's presence, and even while a x lo- gizing for having roused him. begged him to go to his room for a dressing-gown, and return for a cigarette. Tarven was gone and back in a moment, and soon smoking comfortably on a lounge.  It s rather nonsense, you'll think,  re- marked Cantyre,  but the fact is that I'm so abominably off my feed lately that I'm sleeping rottenly.   So I had supposed,  Tarven replied coolly.  You had  Why     Because you ve been coming down to breakfast each mornin  with an after-the- Vol. XLVIII  47 night-before look for days; because, if you settle into a chair after lunch, you re half asleep; because you re afraid o  your coffee after dinner because of lots of things   answered the guest. Then, in a cool and abrupt tone:  Is it money   "Eh   ejaculated Cantyre.  Oh, no; it s not money  I jolly well wish it were.   Then there is something really at the bottom of it, Gus  I thought so. Much better think o  Rodham Steeplechase than  than anything. Do you know. I came near not sleepin  myself to-night  You know Polaris, and you know me. How- ever am I to get him over llag four  I've been thinkin  of it.  Artful Dicky  From this simple ljegin- ning a beginning so simple as to disarm suspicion he beguiled Cantyre till close up to three in the morning with cheerful talk of horse, runs, and races old and new. Tarven indulged his curious humor in saving good-night. 485 Oraunt by  iiwj,v J rslitu. Suddenly he saw Barely look toward the   : r.d The Mup;i fe.iinrrs were instantly irradiated by a swilc- -Pil8 : At the Fourth Flag -JS7  Sleep well, Gus,  he said, moving toward the door.  You've cheered me up no end I ve some hope of gettin' Polaris in ahead of Maihallah yet, thanks to your advice.  Soothed and comforted, Cantyre again got to bed, and was this time soon asleep. He dreamed. It seemed to him that ha was standing on a lawn by a grass court, where strange people were playing tennis. Whenever one of the players missed a jwint, one of the on-lookers would say briskly:  I think I ll have a go at it, if you don t mind;   and forthwith proceed to play. Cantyre looked about to discover if among these people were any that he knew, and presently he recognized old Murray standing near the net. He made his way to the M.F.H., and came up just as one of the players made a  let.   Netsought to be made of tin,  cried old Murray in his most judge-of-the-course manner. "Always were when I was a boy: then you could hear the balls every time they struck.  A murmur of admiration and assent greeted this interesting statement.  Hello, Murray,  said Cantyre in his dream;  what s all this about   Murray turned on him with great sur- prise.  This is my birthday, and you know it is,  he said sternly.  These friends of mine have made me a present; they have got up this game expressly for me to judge it. And I am going to judge the steeple- chase, too; and you ll be late if you don t hump yourself.  Followed a confused dream interval, at the end of which Cantyre found himself on Mashallah, in the rank with six or seven of the tennis players on various odd-looking hacks and screws. Murray started the field, and there was a mad rush through a strange and colorless country, across which one could sight the flags of the course set out with the regularity of tele- graph poles. Cantyre swept on down a long slope, leading the field a glance behind showed him pigmy horses, their riders gesticulating, against the sky-line. As he turned again to look forward, in a flash the country liecame suddenly real, and his dream intensely vivid; he was on the Rodham course, and nearing the fourth flag. 1 he ground was still wet with rain; the wall was not a hundred yards ahead. A small gang of people well to the right of the course were standing on the far side of the wall; a field judge, a groom, and  it seemed as if at the sight of her his heart turned over within him Rose Gallard, straight and indifferent, beside bird-like little Belrose, the doctor. All in one stride, a terrible thought came to Cantyre as he rode; there was strength in the very novelty of it, in its devilish finality.  Somebody'll get. smashed up here,  he seemed to hear Tarven saying. Was she waiting to see it   Had she come to this flag, of all others, in the hope of watching with her hard gray eyes some wreck of man or horse  Let her see it, then a sight to remember till her dying day  In a blind fury, he shouted to Mashallah at the take-off, and let in the spurs. The horse rose, and the instant he was in full flight Cantyre hauled suddenly on the off curb, and changed his seat. By some dream trickery, he felt, without see- ing them, the gray eyes widen with terror, and he had a pang of bitter pleasure in it. The yellow clay of the wall of the ditch leajxKl up to bar his flight; horse and man crashed stunningly against it. and together they rolled to the I Kit tom of the trench. Oh, glorious revenge  Cantyre sat up on the floor, in a snarl of bedclothes, rub- bing the top of his head, and quite dazed in the morning sunshine. IV It lacked but a few minutes to three on a sunny afternoon a week later when Can- tyre brought .Mashallah to the starting line for the Rodham Steeplechase. Amid the chatter and laughter of the on-lookers, the repressed excitement of the backers and takers, and the nervous hilarity of the riders, he was noticeably gloomy. For a week he had been living in a state of ner- vous tension which had robbed him of much of his sleep and of all rest. Again and again, since the night of that wretched dream, had risen before his eyes the picture of a man lying crumpled up in the bottom of a clay trench, with a horse a-top of him. The" idea had become, in his over-wrought condition, an obsession. At first, hardly realizing by what impulse he had been led to do so, he had gone down 4S8 At the Fourth Flag to the fourtli Hag, to look over the ground once more. Arrived on the spot, instead of studying the take-off, flight, and landing with the eye of one wishful of clearing the obstacle to the best advantage, he had suddenly found himself, not without a shock, following an entirely different line of thought. In a flash, he had seen how easily, with his skill in horsemanship, he could bring about a realization of his dream. The idea, so utterly foreign to one of his self-control under ordinary cir- cumstances, had held him strongly in bis nervous and morbid state. He had gazed fascinated at the leap here the irregular wall was at its highest: there, just to the left of the flag, was a slippery patch of clay showing through the scant grass; there, across the ditch, the turf made a lip over the edge of the incline. . . . To an expert rider it would be a very easy matter to bring about one more "regrettable trag- edy,  which would l e almost certainly fatal in its effect. It had been at this   oint in his speculations that Cantyre had pulled himself together; he had gone hot with disgust at the realization of what he had been contemplating; but ever since the secret knowledge of the possibilities of flag tour had been with him. At the beginning he had thrust aside the recurring vision of the crushed rider in the ditch with almost the same fierceness of self-contempt as when it had first presented itself to his mind on the s  ot: but, by degrees, the frequency with which the thought came back to him had blunted the strength of reaction to it and recoil from it. He yielded so far as to play with the idea: and from that moment the idea mastered him. It was in vain that he made occasional efforts to put himself into a mood in which he could see this nightmare in its fitting perspective in the pcrs jective in which the cheerfully egotistic Cantyre of a year ago would have seen it. Each such effort had been followed by a relapse into a closer Ivnnrlage to the sinister possibility. Twice, in the small hours of the night. Cantyre, his feverish head full of his sense of loss, of weariness with his lot, and dis- gust of life, had determined to make an end  a picturesque and gentlemanly end to the whole business. In the morning he had recanted; but. having no near kin and no one dependent on him, he never for one minute admitted that he was not at liberty to choose whether he would or would not yield to his temptation. He now sat his horse in his place between Hailey and Tarven; to each direction of the starting judges he obeyed mechanical- ly; in another moment the signal would be given; yet, for his soul, he could not clear his confused wits enough to say to himself  I will  or   I will not.   Cheer up, Gus,  said Tarven at his elbow.  If you keep frowning like that you ll put me in a funk  Keep that nag of yours in his own melon patch, can t you " Sorry   Cantyre answered,and brought Mas halt ah to his bearings with an absent- minded air. Happening to glance past his friend, he lost the look of abstraction from his face Tarven s other neighbor was Basely on Seminole. Basely  He was sit- ting his horse as steadily as a dragoon, not a trace of  nerves  about him, his square jaw set, and a look of dogged determination on his handsome, stupid face. Very big and resolute he looked, wearing his black and yellow colors like a knight in the field. It swept over Cantyre that it would l e a fine thing to beat him in the race. What would Basely care if there were an  acci- dent   at the fourth flag   At that thought Cantyre felt stirring within him a resolve to bring Masha lah in first of the field.  Ready   cried a sharp voice from the stand on the right. Cantyre s eyes were still fixed on his rival s face. Suddenly he saw Basely look toward the stand. The stupid features were instantly irradiated by a smile. Basely gave a cheerful nod; Cantyre s eyes followed his, with a sicken- ing certainty of what he should see. There she was Rose Gallard, standing near the starters with her mother, an answering smile lighting the proud, delicate face, and in the gray eyes a tenderness and solicitude which Cantyre had never dreamed them capable of. He shivered in his saddle; his resolve to win dropped dead within him; and his soul, in forlorn desj eration, rushed to accept the chance of escape with which it had played.  Settled   he said aloud.  Clang   went the starting bell. Off the green from which the race was started, and where it was to finish, nine riders l ore together toward the easy brush and timber hurdle of the first flag. Can- Dt.vtvn Ay Geerge Brckm.

The ground flew by, a green blur  he was seeing the last of it  The wind whistled in his ears a dirge-like farewell  Flag two: timlK-r. Vaguely, Cantyre heard a ripping crash as he landed clear, and an oath from Hailey. He galloped in a world of his own, a world already strange and unfamiliar, over the long stretch of course to the third flag. As Mashallah gathered himself to leap the sluggish stream, a bay horse, with the rush of a whirlwind, shot suddenly by on the left, and gained the other bank a length ahead. It was instinctively that Cantyre put his horse to go; but the instant that he did so the reality of the earth and sky that he knew came for a moment back upon him as by some optical trick; the rider ahead was wearing black and yellow  Basely on Seminole   "Let him go the idiot   thought Can- tyre, and again the world was altered, as if the sun had hidden behind a cloud. Yet he did not, possibly through mere habit, restrain his horse, and he and Basely drew near the fourth flag, his rival leading him by a length. Here they were now for it  What happened in the next ten seconds is the most vivid thing in Cantyre's life. Once or twice a year, though now habitu- ally a sound sleeper, he dreams about it, and awakes trembling. Basely led to the wall, rose to it, and flew over. Almost at the same moment, at a point five or six feet to the right, Can- tyre followed. As he leaned forward in the saddle, tense to bring his nightmare to a finish, what was below flashed through his daze: Seminole rolling to the bottom of the ditch, and Basely lying on the far- ther edge of it, oddly awry, and almost in front of Mashallah. Very pleasant is it to prattle of "civiliza- tion" and of  the subjugation of instinct to reason : but the ease with which we understand our savage lapses, and the ner- vous haste with which we cry them down, show what the talk is worth. For one tick of the watch, Augustus Cantyre, gen- tleman, had sheer savage murder in his heart. It was as if, at the sight of his rival prone and helpless before his horse, some- thing exploded in his brain. Every feeling, every familiar sentiment was obliterated in one wild wave of frenzy. There lay the source of all his ills, prostrate before him. Even in his fall. Basely had succeeded in robbing him of his right to destroy himself. In those few seconds, Cantyre reached the acme of brute rage. One sharp twist of the left curb, and the shod hoofs of Mashallah must, willy-nilly, come pashing down upon that helpless form and  accident  a terrible "accident   Cantyre gave a wild cry, almost of phys- ical pain; for, flashing up almost in the same ins'tant with his fury, all that tradi- tion, natural generosity, and environment had bred in him, rose and battled with the savage instinct to kill. "Off " He wrenched madly at his curb the right. At the same time he threw his weight back and out to the off side, shaking himself clear of his stirrup-irons. The next moment, he was rolling on the turf, still clinging to the reins. Unhurt. He sprang to his feet, blinking the clay from his eyes. For one dazed second he gazed back. He saw with something like a sob of relief that he had landed clear. One of the judges-of-course was standing over Basely, his arms held up as a warning to the field. A rider cleared the wall and thundered past: red and blue Hailey on Believer. Mashallah stood on bis legs, and reared as Hailey flew by. Cantyre saw in a glance that the saddle had not shifted and that the horse was seemingly unin- jured. A wild desire to get away from the scene of the temptation he had somehow overcome swept over him. He sprang into the saddle just as two riders cleared the flag neck and neck. He sank in his spurs and fled. Of the eight horsemen left, seven were riding to reach the post; but Cantyre only kept to the course instinctive- ly. lie was not riding for any goal, but in full flight from the devil he had seen and heard within him at the fourth flag. V Cantyre brought Mashallah in first at the post. It was rather by chance that he did so, for Hailey had the field all the way to the very last jump. There, however, Believer three times refused a brush hurdle which, as in tones of blended pathos and Indignation his rider was in the habit of I be dinner had been sucn us i make ihc iiiuunli hi something iui re titan a piciurcM i;c feature. declaring afterward,  a cow would have taken at a walk.  It was when dressing for the chase din ner that Cantyre became his normal self again. Ever since the race he had been seeing things with clearer eyes. He had felt, on hearing of Basely s broken ribs and arm, that life had that day bestowed on him a gift truly royal in giving him strength to master a furious impulse. As he was mak- ing his tie at his dressing-table he looked ruefully at his scraped face.  By Jove,  he said aloud,  I sha n t be able to shave for a week.  The thought of that terrible moment at the fourth flag returned to him for the hundredth time.  By Jove,  he said, taking for the second time the name of a deity with whom, judg- ing by his speech, he was on intimate terms,  I wonder what put that rotten idea into my head anyway   Suppose I had done it, . . . and killed the poor devil under the notion that I cared tremendously about Rose. . . .

After the dinner, Cantyre and Tarven drove home together in the moonlight. Without l eing indiscreet, we may remark that the dinner had been such as to make the moonlight something more than a pict- uresque feature. Cantyre, to the relief of his friends, had made a speech quite in his old-time, good-natured manner. With no trace of ill-feeling he had alluded to the day s one accident, and proj osed a health to Basely. He felt himself joyous and healthily tired. He was again at peace with a very jolly world.   Near thing, that fourth tlag," remarked Tarven, as they turned in at the home avenue.  Gad, Gus, my heart was in my boots as I took it.   So was mine,  said Cantyre. We encountered but few vehicles up and down this i ad.  I'ajje 494. THE KING'S HIGHWAY OF CALIFORNIA  El Ca mi no Real  Bv Ernest C. Peixotto J I 1.1. V STRA T 1 0 N S BY I Hr. AVTIIOR is not a highway in Spain -this Camino Real that I lean to follow, hut a high- way in our own land. Span- ill as any in Iberia, a road f infinite variety, long enough lo traverse that peninsula, and running, as it would there, from the des- ert wastes of mountain plateaus to the orange groves and palmettos of soft lands of sunshine. While our patriot fathers were struggling for their liberty along our Eastern seaboard, an old padre   el in aligahle operario Je la Vifia del Sefior   as his friend and com- panion t ails him was establishing his mis- sions along our Western coast. His chain of churches, when completed, was linked by this road, known to the Spaniard as El 492 Camino Real, the King s Highway the only road marked by Duflot de Maufrason his map of Upper California, published in Paris just two years before the American occupation. It still remains the lonely high- way that it always was, the only road con- necting the old missions a mere long scratch upon the bare brown hills that skirt the sea. The sole part of California that the Span- ish exploited was the portion included in these Coast Rangemountains,de Maufrason his map marking the great interior valleys only with the generic legend:   This country is even more beautiful than the inhabited portion of California; its climate is milder, it offers fertile fields, superb forests for lum- ber, and vast prairies where graze herds of deer, antelope, and wild horses.  The King s Highway of California 403 The coming of the gringo changed all this. Mining, agriculture, lumbering, in- terested him far more than stockraising and the breeding of fine horses on the hill-slopes by the sea. Consequently the trend of travel moved inland, down the fertile river valleys. The Camino Real, since so little travelled and so little known, has thus re- tained its Spanish character more, I think, than any other portion of the State. Its towns, rivers, and valleys still l car their tuneful Spanish appellations. Many an old adobe house is to be encountered along its dusty roadway, and nearly every face that one meets upon it is that of a half breed, a Mexican, or a Spaniard. I have been both up and down this road. The old way to follow it would naturally be from Mexico northward, for that was the route of the padres, but the logical way nowadays would seem to be from the Bay counties southward. I might have chosen the springtime to describe it, when the fields are lush and green, and the live- oaks and sycamores shine with the recent rains, but for the purpose of this article I prefer the country in the summer when the hills are brown as a friar s cassock and the short yellow tarweed glistens like the tawny skin of some wild beast; when the dust from the highway has powdered the oak leaves with gold and the rivers run almost dry in their broad rocky beds. For then is this country a Latin state in- deed, parched and sun-baked to be sure, yet cool and breezy as the broad plateaus of Old Castile, or the north coast of the Asturias. It is not until one leaves behind the rich orchards of the Bay counties, and has passed San Jose, that this Old World asj ect of the landscape becomes apparent. About fifty miles to the southward, on a rounded hillock set amid seed-farms, lies San Juan Bautista. The railroad has left it in seclu- sion, lazily sleeping year in and year out, and when I say lies San Juan, I seem to ex- press the mental attitude of the place. Along its lanes  for streets they can scarcely be called  adobe houses stand smothered in jasmine and passion-vine, hedged in by cedars or spiny fences of prickly pear,while down the vistas the long, gaunt fingers of cypresses cut fantastic silhouettes against the sky, and pale olives shimmer in the sun- light.   Vol. XLV11I. 48 The plaza up the hill is to-day weed- grown and lonely, but not deserted. Two of its sides are occupied by the long ar- cade of the mission and by its garden, the third side by a dignified old house with tall French windows giving on broad piazzas, and the fourth side by the Plaza Hotel and an adjoining adobe, said to have l een the home of General Castro of baleful memory. The old hotel is full of character and quite justifies the quaint legend printed at the top of its note-paper; "A relic of the dis- tant past, when men played billiards on horseback and the trees bore human fruit.  Had they been so minded, vaqucros could surely have ridden into the barroom and up to the bar, and 1 prefer to believe, as the host does, that they really did so. With its long overhanging porches still painted in the national colors, red and yellow, and its rickety stairs leading up to bedrooms over- looking pottery roofs, it is a perfect type of the roadside posada. The mission across the way is still in- habited by a lonely priest, and its three gar- dens are kept up to a certain extent. One, a riot of blooms and flowering cacti, is in- cluded within its patio. A second, just out- side the main west door, is a square, formal affair, planted with topped cedars, clipped smooth as columns, its centre marked by a tree larger than its fellows and trimmed in unique fashion to contain a wooden cross. The third garden is a wild tangle lving out- side the cemetery door once the grave- yard, though now unmarked by any tomb- stone, yet nearly four thousand people arc said to lie buried within it. From it the land falls rapidly into the broad reaches of the San Benito valley lying far below, pale and evanescent as the Vega viewed from the towers of the Alhambra. After a good dinner served in the musty dining-room of the hotel, we climbed the San Juan grade, as it is called, over the Gabilan Mountains a stiff pull indeed, the road turning and twisting to such an extent that often we could scarcely see more than a dozen feet ahead. Yet each turn varied the view now westward toward the setting sun and the sea, with the filmy fog creeping landward, swallowing one by one the dis- tant hills; now eastward toward the valley lands bathed in the horizontal sunlight, pale- lemon and turquoise, iridescent as a dream- land. A last stiff grade, a last puff from the 494 The King s Highway of California straining motor, and wc crossed the divide to the Salinas valley, and literally dove oft' toward the sea. The engine was silent, the brakes held fast. Wc glided ever down- ward over the rough roadbed, furrowed and undermined by last winter s rain. The  many-fingered  fog crept closer, thread- ing the gullies, engulfing hill after bill. Still down wc sped to the stubble-fields once more, and in the waning light a last sun-ray lit the distant mountains with a wonderful coral hue, then all went gray and ashen as we struck the level road. Wc spent the night in Salinas, and early in the morning were up and off ascending a broad river valley through a rich agricult- ural country, still for the most part farmed under the old Spanish grants, by a tenantry of Portuguese and Chinese. But soon the fields grew poorer. The valley expanded, confined only on the one hand by distant wooded mountains, on the other by far-off rusty hills, sun-baked as adobe bricks and quite devoid of vegetation. The road ran like a long white ribbon between, seeming, as we sped along, to wind itself upon a spool underneath our living car. What a sense of exhilaration in the free pure air, in the rapid motion what light, what color  The low horizon lends a wonderful im- mensity to the sky, stretching like some giant dome across the valley, clear, limpid, and of that indescribable intensity of color known only to true lovers of our Western solitudes. The Creator seems to have fashioned these hills of California with a great gesture smoothing their ridges and angles into the broadest sweeps and, like some great sculptor, eliminating every un- necessary detail from their contours. Now, as the grade rises and wc pass Gon- zales and Soledad, where Our Lady of the Solitudes crumbles to dust, the distant hills fade yet farther below the horizon and we cross a broad plateau, almost a desert, dry and parched as the arid wastes of Old Castile. Vast herds of cattle, grazing in these scant pastures or huddled in the shade of the few oaks that follow the river s re- freshing waters, count as mere specks in the landscape. How small, how utterly in  significant,a human habitation  Kven King City, a considerable town lying across the river, makes but a small dark blur in the immensity of the picture. We encountered but few vehicles up and down this road, and these could be dis- tinguished from afar, heralded as they were by great clouds of dust. As they passed, tlicir sole occupants were sure to be dark, swarthy men wearing broad sombreros, or women all in black, scarcely distinguishable in the dense shade of the buggy-top. Once in a while where water has been found, an oasis relieves these yellow wastes of tanveed, and there we found alfalfa and fields of pale cschscholtzia. But even these became rarer as we progressed, and signs of life fewer still. Occasionally hawks and turkey-buzzards hung atilt in the air. Often the roadsides were honeycombed by squirrels that scampered in wild affright at the sound of the siren, tumbling over them- selves in their mad haste to reach home and safety. Once a coyote, scarcely distin- guishable from the field wherein he stood, stolidly held his ground and watchcd us as wc sj ed by. We followed along the river for some distance a roaring flood in spring-time, but now in the July drought but a thread of water in a waste of sand and pebbles. And now, sixty miles   r more from Sali- nas, wc struck for the hills. The road led up one of those wild little canyons so character- istic of California, shut in by tawny hill-sides clothed with short dry grass and dotted with stunted oaks telling dark and sharp against the enamelled sky. Down along the stream that trickled through its deepest furrows, the oaks grew denser and wore beards of moss that bespoke the fogs and the near- ness of the sea. Here and there in this Quienceo valley an old adobe or little cem- etery cresting a knoll told its tale of other days. One last look backward at the Salinas valley, and we crossed the ridge and coasted downward to Jolon. Here we drew up at a roadside inn, a structure almost a century old. How refreshing the coolness of its rooms, protected from the heat by their thick earthen walls, after the glare of the open road  A spreading grapevine, ancicnt as the house itself, the main stem big as a iree- tnmk, shaded the broad veranda, and in a enrner we spied a Spanish oja, and made a dash for the fresh, cool water that we knew we should find within it a freshness and a coolness that brought in a flash the recol- The King s Highway of California 495 lection of just such a drink, after a hot ride, in the court of a Segovian posada.

So, after the midday meal, served by a mahogany-colored Mexican woman in a room whose only other occupants were greasers, Portuguese and Mexicans in buck- skins and flannel shirts with big kerchiefs tied round their necks, we all jumped into the motor, and with our kindly guide,struck off the main road for a few miles toward the coast. This by-way led in and out under mighty oaks toward a line of high blue mountains, the Santa Lucias, the last stout barrier that shuts out the encroachments of the sea. And there at their foot, in a meadow studded with pale immortelles, stands the old Mission of San Antonio de Padua, desolate, decaying, and only saved from absolute destruction by the almost superhuman effort of the enthusiast who sat in the motor beside us. With the toil of his own hands, and the aid of a few workmen, he has cleared out the interior and rebuilt the walls shaken down by the earthquake a few years ago. any railroad, and visited by perhaps a score of tourists annually. As we entered the gloom of its interior from the glare of out-of-doors, a dozen squirrels, with tails atilt, scampered off into their holes, while a big white owl, goggle- eyed, rising heavily from a rafter, tlew out through a rent in the ceiling. The nave is quite denuded. In it, how- ever, we descried, standing in a dark comer, the huge community pot of cast-iron, capa- ble of holding more than a hundred gallons of pottage the mammoth that was used to feed all the unmarried people of the mis- sion, for the married folk, who were given uncooked food, had to cook it for them- selves. We noticed, too, within the chancel rail, the burial-place of the first four mission- aries, and near by remarked a rude table decorated with fading boughs, and asked our friend what it was. He told us that the only Indian family still dwelling in the neighborhood  and they live down the San Antonio River, eighteen miles away , on the 49G The King s Highway of California last anniversary of the foundation of the mission, had trudged afoot all the way to church. They had built this rude altar, and decorated it as best they could with boughs and flowers, and then had held a memorial service all by themselves without leader or minister. When their mass was finished, they trudged home again. So per- sists the faith implanted by the zealous mission fathers. In the ruined sacristy we were told of thefts of vestments and plate, and of   bar- barians with a needle who dug up the floor searching for buried treasure.  Then we wandered out into the hot sunlight of what had once been the patio the court for the unmarried women under the very walls of the church, and closest to its protection. Here were woven those beautiful rebozos, or silken shawls, that de Maufras saw made under the direction of old Father Martinez, as late as 1832. The boundaries of this court of the weavers can still be traced, and two or three of its pomegranate-trees, aglow with scarlet blossoms, still flame in the sunilght. We sat down on a broken plough in the shade of one of these trees to listen to stories of the Indians, and of the old times that our friend remembers. One story that I still recall seems worth the telling, for it plainly shows that, despite the faith alluded to above, many of the old Indian superstitions still persist, and always will prevail. Our friend was engaged with some In- dians a few years ago in tearing down an old ado  e hut that had fallen to decay. Sud- denly, without warning, one of the Indians leaped back and, with a startled cry, called out to him:  Don t touch it don t touch it. It ll kill you.  Thinking of course of a rattlesnake coiled in a comer, the Spaniard drew back, but on looking closely about, saw no snake, but only a little stick carefully laid in a crevice of the wall. Again the Indian warned him, but with the retort,   It may kill an Indian, but it won t kill me,  our friend took the stick out and examined it.   And, talk of pyrography,  he said in telling the story,   that stick was covered with the most beautiful and extraordinary tracery you ever saw, fine and delicate as the finest lace. And then, with infinite art, it was wrapped round and round with a woman's hair.  He asked the Indian what it meant, but could get no answer beyond a mumbled  Ask the old woman, my mother she knows.  But she too shrank back at the very sight of this bit of wood with its human wrapping, muttering always,   It will kill you.  Finally, however, and only after much persuasion, she consented to tell its story. There was, it seems, a certain man in the community who was known to be a hechi- eero, or sorcerer, called by the Indians  takan,  and he had fallen in love with a woman who did not return his affection, so, in revenge and through treachery, he pro- cured a lock of her hair and wrapped it around this   devil-stick,  and hid it away. And the woman died. Suspicion fell upon him and he was subsequently driven from the community, and all his belongings taken to a desolate hillside and there burned, and a cross planted over the ashes. Despite these precautions, the  devil- stick  remained walled up in its chink, and continued to exert its baleful influence, for ill luck attended the house and all its occu- pants. Finally, the hut remained unten- anted so long that it fell to decay and had to be pulled down, when the  devil-stick,  as we have seen, again beheld the light of day. After taking our friend back to Jolon, wc struck southward once more toward the up- per Salinas valley, where wc forded the river near San Ando, finally reaching San Miguel. Here we stopped a few moments to refresh ourmemor - of its mission church, still in excellent preservation, and still deco- rated with the glaring stencils executed by the Indians long ago. Nine miles beyond, we put up for the night at the big hotel of El Paso de Robles the Pass of the Oaks. Next morning we learned the reason for the name, for the King s Highway led us on through a beautiful park-like country, whose rolling pastures are dotted with giant oaks that send their spreading branches far aloft to fall again earthward in longpendent boughs. Through these shaded fields we climbed higher than we knew, and found ourselves at last at the brink of a steep descent, the Cuesta Grade, fuil of sharp turns and twists, winding downward rapid- ly to the valley where San Luis Obispo lies baking in a circle of gaunt mountains. This I hi  by-way umltr mighty toward ibc Santa l.ucirts.  Pa 'c 495. old place has now grown into a consider- able town, but as it was Sunday morning its streets were almost deserted. We en joyed, however, a glimpse of the interior of the mission churc h with its gleaming walls, its saints in niches, and its praying women with swarthy skins. The garden, too. running riot with gladiolas and fuchsias, makes a pretty picture with its formal pat tern still preserved and shaded by tall fan- palms and pomegranates loaded with ver- milion blooms. It was getting on toward noon as we left San Luis, and the road was hot. Every now and then we met couples in buggies headed, as we were, southward. The high- way engaged itself in a labyrinth of shade less hills, dovetailing into each other, stilling the breeze and radiating heat. The noon- day air grew more and more oppressive. Suddenly, without a warning, we topped a ridge and there, not a mile away, lay the sea, lazy, blue, and crested with white caps. Oh Vol. XLVIil. 49 the joy of it. and the smell of it  And the coolness of the fresh trade wind  To the southward stretched the long bright cres- cent of the sands, white and glittering to the far cliffs lieyond El Pizmo, scarred, sheer, and topped with verdure. The road follows this delectable shore for a dozen miles or more, then turns inland again to the valley, where nestles the old town of Arroyo Grande smothered in seed- farms- acres of sweet peas and nasturtiums unbelievable except in California. The principal church was just pouring forth its congregation as we passed Latins for the most part, men in sombreros and women with bright bands of velvet sewed round their skirts and gaudy kerchiefs knotted round their necks among them two sisters in black that we mistook for a moment for women in mantillas. Leaving Arroyo behind, we crosscd a low range to the valley of the Santa Maria, then sped through the prosperous town of that 497 The Mission ui San Antonio tie Padua. name, beyond which we lunched in the dense shade of a group of eucalypti. These picnics by the wayside proved most attrac- tive features of the trip, better far than the usual pick-up meals that one gets at the roadside inns. Up the Santa Maria valley, we found a sandy desert again the most desolate re- gion we had yet encountered. No wonder the early expeditions were dismayed as they traversed these dreary solitudes. Not a house and scarcely a tree in miles. So when at last, after many a league, we finally spied a ranch and a sign that told us it was a post-office as well, with the euphonious name of Sisquoc, we pul in for water to cool our motor, which had become over- heated in the heavy sand. We met there a loquacious old Swiss who had lived thirty years in the valley, and who, I am sure, was glad enough of our intrusion, for he went off into stories like an engine letting off steam, then sank into a calmer mood as soon as his little fund of information was exhausted. The road now led us on up La Zaca Creek, and at the top of the grade we were treated to a line sight, for perched 49$ upon a iree sat a great black eagle which, at our approach, rose lazily and sailed off over the valley. Farther on a more horrid pict- ure met our eyes a scene from Dore's   Infernoa tlock of vultures settled on the dead limbs of an old oak, taking no note of us whatever, but hideously intent u  on a gully where some carrion lay rotting. An hour or so more through a desolate region brought us at length to the village of Los Olivos, and we drew up for the night before its roadside hostelry a comfortable little place kept by a good Italian, under whose care we enjoyed a delicate and well- chosen dinner, including the freshest of mountain trout from the Santa Inez River, and some genuine white Chianti. We found, next morning, that we had left the wilderness behind for good and all. We had gone but a few miles when, at a turn of the road, an unlooked-for vision met our eyes. Were we truly in California or in some secluded valley along the Tagus   In a vast amphitheatre of radiant moun- tains, overlooking the reaches of a broad river valley, stood the old Mission of Santa Inez, quite as the Spaniard left it, facing the morning sun, its white arcades gleam- The King's Highway of California 499 ing; its bronze bells ringing in its cam- panarios; its pottery roofs harmonizing to perfection with the ruddy grasses of its vassal fields. Not a house in sight marred the picture. And a visit to the interi   r even enhanced the Old World flavor of the spot. We r -   were taken about by a priest, its sole occupant, who is the zealous guar- dian of its relics of the past and they are many  and who has brought order out of chaos in the sacristy, where he has rear- ranged the beautiful old vestments, the altar ser- vices, the fine old Mexican linens and lawns and laces, and other possessions of the padres. There were two articles among all these that especially caught my fancy. One was a large silk umbrella, lemon yellow in color, and edged with Chi- nese blue, which the fathers used to carry to shelter them as they walked the weary miles from mission across these shadeless soli- tudes, or to visit their neo- phyte Indian families. For, once the missions were established, no brother was permitted to ride, but was compelled, in his humility, tOiproceed everywhere afoot per pede aposlo- brum. The other object was a rude catafalque raised on steps, and the priest ex- plained to me that one, two, or three steps were used according to the social status of the Indian that was to be buried, and that still, when an Indian died and the bier had been arranged with one step, the fam- ily or comrades of the deceased would strongly object, saying,w Non it no, pcro dos; era ttn muygrande Indian   So went the humility of the padre with the pride Of the Indian  Tucked away in the recesses of these beautiful Santa Inez Mountains, clothed in their royal purple mantles, are several old haciendas still kept up in Spanish style.

P;igc   r. ascending the beautiful little canyon that bears the name of the well-known family we were to visit, fording its creek a dozen times as the gulch grew narrower and wilder. A short steep hill, a gate, and we found our- selves on a little plateau, with a low house snugly sheltered at the far end under a group of giant oaks. The big bams and outhouses quite a settlement lay to the left. As we drew up before the gate, a fig- ure all in white, the daughter of the house, came forward to greet us. followed im- 500 The King s Highway of California mediately by her father, a tall, fine-looking Castilian whose courtly manner harmonized perfectly with the old-world seclusion of this patrician abode. And it certainly had a patrician air, this low hacienda full of repose, with its broad porches and comfortable chairs and ham- mocks, its shady vine arbor almost a cen- tion to a great copper community pot, such as we had seen at San Antonio, and which he had brought from the now deserted Mis- sion of La Purissima Concepcion off near the coast. In the patio, too, were hung the bridles and the high conical Mexican hats ornamented with carved leather, the Indian baskets, and the blankets, and the girls  tury old. and its whitened adobe walls toned by age and weather. The interior, too, had the same old-world quality, being quite de- void of halls or passageways, the rooms merely communicating with each other by means of arches; the master s room to the right beyond the big living-room, the din- ing-room to the left, and through the latter you entered the patio, surrounded by the guests  and children s rooms. Little had been added to the furniture since the olden days. Old-fashioned gilt mirrors still hang gleaming upon the walls, and Spanish wedding-chests, decorated with those Chinese designs that recall the days of Spain s close contact with the Or- ient, still stand in shadowy comers. On a table in the living-room I spied an original edition of Palou s   Life rtf   unipero Serra,  and in the patio our host called our atten- riatas made of horsehair prized posses- sions these, for it is well-nigh impossible to find any one who can make them nowa- days. We lingered upon the veranda for some time to hear how the timbers of the house had been dragged along the ground by oxen up the narrow valley through which we had come, and how the shingles had been brought strapjjed to the oxen s horns. And then, after a friendly glass of port, and a warm invitation in true southern fashion for more extended hospitality, we bade our friends good-by and were off again south- ward. Our path now lay toward the moun- tains the Santa Inez range, whose steep Hanks, clothed in thick brush, afford shelter for about the only large bears to be found in southern California. We climbed the wind-  The King's Highway of California ing grades of tin- Gaviota Pass by a rough with the Pacific  or to be more exact, the road that wound up under the shadow of Santa Barbara C hannel  on the one hand, giant oaks and sycamores.

Midway we halted for avoid the use of the word riviera, for these On flic Gaviota Caw luncheon beside a stream, then, in the motor again, coasted the remainder of the grade. This time we smelt the sea before we saw it, so it came not as a surprise as it had back at San Luis Obispo. We had, too, been pre- pared for it by the very name of the pass through which we had come gaviota, the sea-gull. But when at the last turning we finally beheld its broad expanse, cool, blue, pacific, our pleasure was indeed keen. It was heightened, too, as we rounded the point and turned eastward along the riviera shores with their gray furrowed mountains standing above verdant foot-hills, their azure expanses of sea. their islands floating like mirages on the far horizon Anacaper, Santa Cruz, and San Bernardo where Ca- brillo ended his discoveries by his death  possess the same rare beauty as the south coast of France, or the far-away Riviera of the Seven Castles on the highway to Tratt. In a cove along the beach, a schooner lay aground, her tall masts sticking high above the hay-tields, lying upon so calm a day as The Kings Highway of California 503 at the will of man rather than by the caprice of that lazy ocean of so deep a blue that the hay-stacks, standing in relief against it, glowed like wrought gold against some ce- rulean background enamelled by Nardon Penieaud. The road along this coast is one long suc- cession of barrancas, each with a rocky creek-bed worn by the winter torrent at the bottom a rough road indeed. As the blue- serrated mountains behind Santa Barbara come into sight, however, clean-cut as the sure line of some Durer etching, it levels out, and we enter a very Eden of delight. The air comes laden with the perfume of orange and lemon blossoms, and of straw- berries lying cool under their shiny leaves. Avenues of pepper-trees alternate with Ion" alamedas of palmettos and gum-trees. The bougainvillea smothers the little cottages in its gorgeous purple bloom. Villas over- grown with roses, and pretty surburban homes, now begin to adjoin each other; an old mission church with twin towers gleams against the dark mountains, and we enter the streets of Santa Barbara. We pre- ferred to spend the night in the quiet groves of San Ysidro, so left the old Span- ish town behind and climbed the slopes of the Sierras overlooking the sea. Wc had now reached the land of Anda- lusia after the bleak wastes of Estramadura, the Vega after the arid mountain-world. Wc might, by continuing  along the   amino Real, visit the remainder of Fray Junipero s churches, but in the rich and luscious country that lies beyond Santa Bar- bara, the orchardist and vineyardist have come; the gringo has set his seal upon the land and the remains of the Spanish occu- pation must l e sought for in the rush of modem improvement. We preferred there- fore to keep our impressions intact anti re- member only the land we had just traversed. In its lonely mountains we had seen the Spaniard still tending his flocks and herds; heard its valleys still echoing the angelus at eventide, and found its sparse villages still sheltering their populations of swarthy Iberians. We had found a true bit of Old Spain still lingering in this untraveiled strip of California. A nt San Miguel.

Do they mean to compliment us or do they not   Are they, perhaps, hinting that the Roman re- public met its fate, and that we are headed in the same direction  Whatever may be the thought in the back of the heads of these ob- servers, they at least admit that we have come into our own, and that our own, whatever the future may hold, is for the moment worth having. The two things which seem to impress them most, and which most frequently cause their minds to hark back to our ancient prototype, are our love of pleasure and the cheerful optimism which accompanies luxury on every hand. Ferrero, who may be accepted as the most noteworthy of these visiting foreigners, finds in this country a  delightful elation of feeling  which he assumes to be the temper of , the people in which climatc and to- pography assist. This optimism and cheerfulness he contrasts with the  universal note of sadness in Europe due to its numerous frontier lines.  Gayety in America is universal, he says, and notes in evi- dence the music he encounters wherever he goes. One suspects he is referring to the restaurants, for he had just been making a tour of the Great White Way, under which picturesque phrase Broadway after dark is known. The spectacle of numbers of people eating expensive dishes at midnight and in public to the sounds of what make for the lute and the lyre leads him to his favorite compari- son, while admitting our modern improvements in the way of electric lighting and transporta- tion. He visits the Hippodrome, and after ex- pressing his enthusiasm at the beauty and magnificence of the entertainment in a manner that must have delighted the management, he goes on to describe how it would have pleased the old Romans, who delighted in such great spectacles. Now this is very interesting. Whatever may be our national sins, and wc are told on all sides that they are many, we are cheerful sinners, it seems. If we love luxury, we love it in its social aspect rather than as individuals. Vol. XLVITI. 50 It is not beyond the memory of man when we had the reputation of taking our pleasures sadly when we did take them. The man of the United States was so busy piling up dol- lars that he had no lime for amusing himself. I hat was left for his butterfly mate, whose time was spent in adorning herself and displaying herself adorned. This new point of view that of a happy, ex- hilarated people with even a  greed for pleas- ure  thus Ferrero sums it up, robust and hearty, like that of the Romans, even if with a  lack of intelligent imagination,  is sufficiently alluring to make us want to stand aside and see ourselves bc avin  so joyously that we at- tract attention. That there is a constant pressure to add to our holidays, and a notable increase in theatres and other places of amuse- ment, occurs to every one. We have the spec- tacle of thousands of judges, bankers, lawyers, clerks leaving their offices to go to games of foot-ball and base-ball accompanied by every stratum of the population, impartially col- lected under the name of  fans.  One of those public-spirited men who promote electric roads in inland towns for the convenience of the public and their own profit, says that the guarantee of his own satisfactory share in the undertaking is to organize an amusement park at some terminal. If need be he digs a pond, puts in it some boats, sets up a mechanical organ in a dancing pavilion, with opportunities for soft drinks and tables for picnickers, and his end is assured. Hither during the afternoons his road is occupied transporting mothers and children, and in the evening young people and wage-workers, all of whom are almost clear gain for his coffers. In one town in the far West he carried his road seventeen miles to a little lake which, electricity being the thing he has most of, he fringed with colored electric bulbs, and with music, dancing, and light keeps his road busy and his receipts heavy. It is these large corporate views of amuse- ment as an asset that arc most conclusive of our state. We must have amusement; we are in circumstances to gratify it; it is profitable to supply it. Our joyousness is organized, ac- cording to the temper of the times. In this age of vast projects, it is freely admitted that SOS The Point of View these cannot lx- carried on without providing for the recreation of the workers. In building the government roafl to lienguiet, a brass band had to be brought up to play behind the Fili- pino laborers, who would work to music when they wouldn't work without. The workmen in this country are not so exacting; they work when they work and play when they play. But whether it is the Ashokan dam, which is to supply the increasing thirst of New Yorkers for water, or the great irrigating projects of the far West, the amusements for I "he leisure hours of the work men must as certainly be considered as the specifications. While the women must have their schools and churches, the more friv- olous males must have sports and bands. When the government was building the forty miles of road over an almost inaccessible coun- try preparatory to undertaking the great Roose- velt dam it was found impossible to get white laborers, because it was impossible to supply them with opportunities for gayly spending their money. The engineers consequently were obliged to hire Apaches, whose ideas of fun were of another sort, and not so insistent. Along the length of the Panama Canal music, dancing, and sports have their appointed times, even as have the dredges and shovels. Colon plays Ancon; Corazal challenges Gatun; Em- pire gives a dance to Gorgona. Even the gov- ernment turned impresario and sent down four young women who fiddled to the workers all along the line.  Panemet Circenses  is the legend over every great undertaking in this country, as it was of our old friends the Romans. Thus far the professors have ob- served us correctly. Good wages and plenty of fun, and we will follow the steam shovel wherever it goes. A RECENT character sketch by Katha- rine Tynan concerns a delightful old lady of eighty with the heart and eyes of eighteen; who lived in a beautiful old house colored by the centuries and surrounded by a garden dim, rich, and ordered. Her predomi- nant qualities were a passionate kindness and a winning modesty. Yet at limes she launched out in self-laudation, waved her tlag of leader- ship, and reduced the blatantly ob- streperous to decency. A cargo of Londoners, celebrating Bank Holiday, had crossed to Ireland, anti six or eight men, with a sprinkling of women and children, settled themselves in a one-horse cart to Ik- drawn up an all but perpendicular hill.  Tell them,  the indignant old lady ordered the wagoner,  tell them that the I ady of the Manor al- ways walks up.  Overawed by the high- sounding tide, the cockney tourists clambered out of the cart and did walk up. I delight in this tale of assertiveness, as the eye when it sees scarlet luxuriates in the thought of green; for my own pet rampant pride is hu- mility, that so-called virtue which, coming easi- est, had loomed for me into a besetting sin. Possibly with others, as with me, it is not an attribute of Christian character, but, as Sam Weller has it,  werry rewerse to the contrary." There are those, like Cowper, to whom a pub- lic exhibition of Uiemsclves on any occasion is mortal poison; yet Dr. Johnson was justly angry at Thrale for sitting at Oglethorpe s table without shaking, censuring him for degrading himself to a nonentity. Lord Strafford once took down to dinner a lady whose name he did not catch. Talk turned upon mathematics, and he tried to explain it to his companion, who listened with polite attention. Up-stairshe found it was Mrs. Somerville. I fear that in her place I should have weakly done the same thing. A modest silence would have been so much simpler than tactfully to disclose my identity. As a result, however, Lord Strafford must have cursed his officiousness, and the ra- tional conversation with which the two might have whiled away the dinner hour was obvi- ously imposible. Unintentionally, but never- theless, the great mathematician s modesty smacked no less of pride than did Rousseau s.  The new picce has fallen flat,  he cried at the door of the cafe;  it has wearied me to death. It is by Rousseau of Geneva, and I am that very Rousseau." Such humility is egotism standing on its head. The adage that children should be seen and not heard deprived the first half of the nine- teenth century of much goodly conversation and noble bearing, and was the direct ancestor of that stultifying hallucination that anything, though ever so little, which a man speaks of himself is still too much. Observance of that dictum would hourly rob conversation of its snap and sparkle, of its root and tendril and flower. Charlotte Bronte, whose youthful genius was kept unseen and unheard, had to nerve herself to meet Thackeray and other not- able contemporaries by demanding of herself:   Who but a coward would pass his whole live in hamlets   Without the vanity that loves ap- plause, few of us, as Bagchot shrewdly guesses, The Point of View 507 fired up:  How could I tell how I sang il  I stood at the man s right hand and the fiend at his left, and all I could think of was howto save him.'' It is so easy tu be humble when all the world knows there is a foundation for pride underneath; but it requires heroism for the shy to assume a social fearlessness. In brief, self- eulogy using eulogy in its old Greek sense of speaking well  has its uses fruitful as well as sterile; and true modesty while it walks up the hills unostentatiously a hundred times will, that hundred and first time, proclaim its own exalted rank and extol its own practice, that the unqualitied and the misqualified may be led to imitate its virtue. would cultivate the tact which gains applause. If we can do without the world, the world can make shift to do without us. Ask and it shall be given to you is a rule and sequence of divine origin. Who of us shy ones, skilled in sclf-cfTacement, has not realized that the best things on the table of life have gone untasted because we failed to serve ourselves thereto   You young fellows will not take responsibility,  said a great colonial governor, when questioned why others in the service dirl not rise. It is a question if a man with every qualification for a responsible olficc has the right to refuse the office. The modesty which leaves duties to inferiors needs some justifica- tion. People so habitually take us at our own valuation that when in mistaken modesty we set our influence too low it is literally lowered.  O to be nothing, nothing   is as pernicious a petition as the calling oneself a worm in the dust is derogatory to one s Creator. David de- fined a gentleman as one who is lowly in his own eyes; but Jesus approved the guest who, after taking a low seal at table, joyfully ac- cepted the host s invitation to come up higher. It is so easy to insist on sitting low, monoto- nously recounting one s unworthiness for the seat perilous, becoming thereby a bore even to one s neighbors below the salt.  Oh, well, I am not going to urge you,  brutally said a young male relative, when I met his invitation for some great treat by suggesting he might prefer to take some other girl. Then and there I learned the invaluable social lesson to accept promptly and heartily, and make myself good enough company to be asked again. Plutarch says that Pedaretus, being left out of the elec- tion of the three hundred, went home merry, saying it did him good to see there were three hundred found better in the city than himself. Say not better, Pedaretus, but more active;  tis the way of politics ever. Johnson s self-com- placency was more profoundly modest:  In writing my dictionary I knew very well what I was undertaking, and very well how to do it, and I have done it very well.  Nor did he scruplc to atcept the praise of his sovereign.  When the king has said it,  he remarked,  it was to be so.  Culture teaches us our modest place in the whole scheme, but to shrink so small as to leave that place half empty is retiring into notice.  My poor humble sell  was often on the lips of Jenny Lind, but she never cringed or lost dignity. When asked how she executed her part in  Roberto il Diavolo," her genius O you object to talk about inns   asks Thackeray of the readers of his  Roundabout Papers.   It always seems to me to be very good talk. Walter Scott is full of inns. In  Don Quix- ote  and  Gil Bias  there is plenty of inn talk.  All, but who reads Cervantes and Walter Scott and Le Sage in these days  Such authors as they are no crite- rion. And if inns are tolerated at all,    a OUI Inn it is only because they run garages for our motor-cars. As for Literature, what concern has Literature with inns that stand less than thirty stories high with a frontage on the Avenue  And yet those old times of the inn and the stage-coach were good times. I like Henry Fielding s metaphor by which his readers are represented to be passengers in a stage-coach   and he the genial stage-coach driver. Field- ing s novels teem with coaches and inns. The rioet Gray, who preferred Richardsun, allowed Richardson s rival a finer understanding of these important matters. It should be no re- proach, at least; and in our own generation Kipling has hymned the ship engineer and the locomotive driver. But Dickens was the last of the novelists to tell us much about inn- keepers and the tribe of stage-drivers, a genus as extinct nowadays as the dodo itself. Where are the Wellers of Yester-year  Not with Dickens alone, but with his eigh- teenth-century forbears Fielding and Smol- lett and Sterne inns and their keepers were a long suit. Who has forgotten Dessein s in the  Sentimental Journey   Thackeray, in one of those same admirable  Roundabout Papers,  has taken us back to Dessein's, ad- mirable hostelry lhat it was  He knew the The Point of View Calais  Hotel of old  as one of the cleanest, one of the dearest, one of the most comfort- able,  in all Europe. Certainly Desscin s must have been very dear. Oliver Wendell Holmes, writing a letter from Paris in the year 1834, states that wine there cost  just three times as much as at the Palais Royal,   and the Palais Royal was never inexpensive. Thackeray's  Roundabout  gives him the cue for one of those most winning personal confessions in which his essays and his novels arc all of them so rich.  I remember,  he says,  a certain little Paris excursion about which my benighted parents never knew any- thing.  When he had recrossed the Channel, and had tasted a whiting and a beefsteak and a glass of negus at the  Ship  at Dover, there was left over but half-a-crown for the guard and coachman on the road to London. Thack- eray  had gone without leave. What a long, drear  , guilty, forty hours  journey it was from Paris to Calais, I remember  How did I come to think of this escapade, which occurred in the Easter vacation of the year 1830  I always think of it when I am crossing to Calais. Guilt, sir, guilt remains stamped on the memory, and I feel easier in my mind now that it is liberated of this old peccadillo.  The college mate whom Thackeray visited in Paris, when he made this sub rosa journey thither in his youth  and breakfasted, belike, at Desscin s- if he did not dine there  was  Edward FitzGerald  This was in the years before the Laird of Little-Orange took up for good the vegetative life. What a thing it was to have been young a hundred years ago, in those days when it took forty hours to travel from Paris to Calais  There were no turbine steamers on the Channel then, and travel was a luxury. A book very recently published has for its title:  The Journal of John Mayne During a Tour on the Continent upon its Reopening upon the Fall of Napoleon, 1814.  The first entry in the  Journal" is dated  Calais, Au- gust, 1814.  After a tedious crossing, the young traveller had alighted "at the Hdtel d Angleterre, formerly Dessein s, now kept by Quillacy  Quillac  and Duplessis.  It was here that Lady Hamilton stayed for a part of the same eventful summer. Dcsscin s was then "the greatest establishment in Europe.   There were between seventy and eighty beds there and fifty for servants: just ponder that fact, ye who are content with the modem caravansaries of London and Paris and New York  Yet there were  as young John Mayne informs us   many deficiencies  that  instantly attracted the notice of an English gentleman.  For instance, though the rooms were  large and airy,  the beds they contained, being set in rccesscs, were occupied somewhat indis- criminately by male and female guests. Judge the importance, then, of the  posts and cur- tains,  forming  a little appartment  screened off from the room proper. These are the days of hostelries with  lifts  innumerable and with  garages ; yet I re- gret, in spite of myself, those olden times of inns and coaches and postillions. It is only in my library that I can travel post and stop at Dessein s and seat myself in the diso- bligea tlc:    Once mure upon the diligent ; oncc more The horses jog before me like a flock That knows no loader."

But if you look closely, with all the acuteness of    sight that you can command, and ex- amine the inmost secrets of that won- drous art, you will discover such subtile, such fine and closely wrought lines, twisted and interwoven in such intricate knots, and adorned with such fresh and brilliant colors, that you will readily ac- knowledge the whole to be the result of angelic rather than human skill. The more numerous the beauties I discover in it, the more I am lost in renewed admiration of it. Neither could Apelles himself execute the like; and indeed they seem to have been formed and painted by a hand not mortal." Already in the day of Henry II and Prince John it was nearly as unfashionable as in Eliza- beth s to praise anything in Ireland. And one cannot help reflecting that Giraldus Cambren- Vol. XLVI1I. 51 4 ftui  pm Jr. fMHO First page of the Genealogy Si. I.ukc s C o pel. III.

No small part of this achievement and its tremendous effects upon the history of civiliza- tion may fairly be traced to the passion for books of the saint who was poet, scril e, and an Irish prince of the O Donnells.

St. Longarad, when Co- lumba visited him, refused even to show his very ancient  I-Vlfre  of AngustheCuldee; and the scribe of the "losses of the  Felire " attributes the subsequent illegibility of the l  oks to the retort of the imperious prince and effective saint: May your books be of no use after you, since you have exercised inhospitality about them.  Again, in the middle of his life Columba s zeal for copying, in the case of the famous  Battel Book of ihc O Donnells,  led to an extraordi- nary series of events, melancholy for him, since they made him the first and forever typical Irish exile, but significant to the entire world.

The remark- able style of illumination which had arisen and developed in Ireland at a time when classic art was practically extinct and mediocrity in all the arts prevailed in Europe, reached in the  Book of Kells" a  standard of excellence never before attained nor since surpassed.  In Ire- land the style lasted pure from the fifth cen- tury for six hundred years, but its influence ex- tended, interlaced ornament predominating in the so-called Charlemagne style of the next two centuries in France and continuing upon the gold grounds of the thirteenth and in the beau- tiful Italian borders of the fifteenth centuries. In the great Irish monasteries of that happy day all  he arts developed together, and the scribe, if he were not himself a craftsman, worked side by side with the fathers of the artists who made such masterpieces as the  Cross of Cong  and the "Tara Brooch."

But it is Kells that in Ireland still s  eaks most eloquently of the greatest saint of the entire Celtic race. At Kells, Columba had lived, up to the moment of his exile, in a house onc-tcnth cell, nine-tenths oratory, that still stands, a remarkable and   erfect example of the ancient Irish stone- roofed structure. In Kells, famous for metal work, was made the splen - did can edcumdach, or cover, of the   Battle Book of the O'Donnells,  which, with the  Battler  itself, the  Annalsof the Four Masters,  the  Book of the Dun Cow,  the  Speckled Book,  and thousands of ancient Irish manuscripts, poems, or sagas with charming names, may now be seen in the archives of the Rova  Irish Acad- emy. And it was from Kells, In- come at last the recognized head of all the Columban foundations in Ireland, that the Great Gospel of Columcille.  chief relic of the Western World,  embodying with the gos- pels certain eleventh-century charters relating to Kells and known for centuries as the  Book of Kells,  was stolen in 1106. It was found  after twenty nights and two months,  the Four Masters tell us,  with the gold  of its cumdach  stolen off and a sod over it.  So dull have we been at learning our Ireland, that few, even of such tourists as linger de- lightedly in the Manuscript Room of the British Museum, ever think of climbing the stairs of Trinity College in Dublin to see. in the excel- lent company of the venerable "Books of Dur- row and Armagh,  and the Irish harp of Brian Boru that gem of all books, the   Book of Kells,   the most lieautiful book in the world.  Its superiority to the two other finest illu- minated manuscripts of the Irish School, the sixth -century    Rook of I  uitow   and the   Book of Lindisfame,   of which the date is fixed as between 687and 731,has finally madeclcar that   rnkof,a cr ' 0  Umlis amc in England, where the one  of Linrlisfarm .  a treasure   f the- British Museum, wa  written in honor nf St. Cuthhcrt, w;   founded by Irish lix m Si. Columba   school at 512 The Field of Art The art of cloisonne enamel, which wasa pecul- iar gift of the Celtic race, undoubtedly sug- gested, by its application of twisted wire to metal surfaces, many of the mosaic patterns of the illuminator, as well as the use of colors, the paint being often applied in varying degrees of thickness to produce jewelled effects. Metal work, which had been cultivated in Ireland a thousand years before St. Columba, suggested dots, whorls, spirals, disks, and fretted designs: while the textile arts suggested patterns of ribbon work which the Celtic artist applied to the treatment of birds, reptiles, dogs the extinct Irish wolf-hound  dragons, and even men, in the most ama .ing and delightfully effective fash- ion. Whereas in earlier and contemporary conti- nental manuscripts all letters are of uniform size, the first few lines being simply written in red, in even the earliest Irish illuminated manu- scripts entire pages are given to gigantic decorated initials or to the first few words of main divisions of the text; while all initials throughout the text are elabo- rately ornamented. Figure drawing appears first in the  Book of Kells,  where, as on the Irish High Crosses, it is always crude, designed not to repre- sent, but simply to decorate. The quaint figures of the Evangelists in their robes so symmetrically folded suggest the ecclesiastical vestments of the Celtic Church in the eighth century; and the nimbus alx ut each reverend head, like the geometrical divisions that enframe each figure, is filled with the exquisite tracery' and mosaic that will always be the wonder and discouragement of would-be copyists. The same accomplished English artist who declared that in delicacy of handling and mi- nute but faultless execution the whole range of palaeography offers nothing to be compared with the early Irish manuscripts, confesses that once, in Dublin, he attempted to copy a few of the ornaments of   the most marvellous of them all,  the  Book of Kells,   but broke down in despair.  A page like the famous  Mono- gram page  upon which, in and about the three letters XFI, standing for Christi, every variety of design known to Celtic art has been lavished, the most astounding combinations of elongated human and reptile forms, infinitely small, interlaced to form an exquisite web  produces a broad effect, of a beauty that the superlatives of more than one language have l een taxed to describe in centuries when su- perlatives were not so cheap as undiscriminat- ing  criticism  has made them in our own  The richness of the color effects is the more remarkable for being accomplished without the aid of the gold or the parchment stain employed in Continental illumination. As, in the quiet of that lofty, grave old library, one studies whatever page has been reverently turned for that particular day, one cannot help wondering whether Giraldus and the numbers of people after him, down to the Dublin photographer of our own gener- ation who refused on reverential grounds to reproduce the ftages of the   Book of Kells,  may not have been right in attributing to  no human hand  the marvel of that unbelievable draw- ing, in colors dear, but softened like old paint upon old canvas. Professor Westwood, of Oxford, said that he had ex- amined the drawings with a lens without ever detecting a false line or irregular in- terlacement;  and when it is considered that many of these details consist of spiral lines and are so minute as to be impossible to have been exe- cuted without compasses, it really seems a prob- lem not only with what eyes, but also with what instruments, they could have been executed.'' At the National Industrial Exhibition in Dublin two years ago, one s eye was caught by case after case of foreign pottery whose pres- ence was explained, with unconscious patho3, by some such label as this:  This clay Ireland has; this pottery Ireland could make.  Those of us who know the old glory of Ireland and her later sorrows- no longer only  Three   could only return to the old library to gaze at a book made eleven centuries ago without instru- ments and without  capital,  saying to our- selves:  This Ireland has, this Ireland made; and it is a wonder of the world.

HAVE come to see about making an exchange of my- player-piano for a PIANOLA Piano. It isn t pleasant to own up to an error in business judgment, and yet that is just what my errand here represents. It came about this way:   In my line of manufacturing, there are half a dozen different brands on the market, all good, all selling well and hardly any difference between them. I thought it was probably very much the same way with player-pianos, and so when I found I could buy another make for one hundred dollars less than the PIANOLA Piano, I figured that as so much clear saving.  My business training is all in the direction of buying in the cheapest market. Every hundred dollars saved I am accustomed to figure as one hundred dollars made.  Yes, I was familiar with the Aeolian Company s statements as to the superiority of the PIANOLA Piano, its exclusive features, and so forth, but I discounted them as the natural enthusiasm of a manu- facturer for his own goods.   It wasn t until I had owned the other instrument for some three months that I began to realize there was something more than claims in your statements.  After I had mastered the work- ing of my instrument I found myself continually balked in trying to obtain certain effects which my ear told me were desirable. In the first place, I wasn t enough of a musician to know how to produce these effects, and then again, I found the instrument wasn t capable of them In answering advertisements please mention SCRIBNER S  TAGAZINE SCRIBNER'S MAGAZINE .11 I ERTISER 53 THE WEBER PIANOLA PIANO Stvle 46P  Playing hoth 6  and SB-nole musk rolk  Price  1150  cl. With Mctrostyle and ThcmortiM Piano by a Business Man even if I had known how to secure them. For instance, I had heard Victor Herbert s band play his Badinage, with great effect due to sudden pauses, alternated with unexpected bursts of speed, pleasing accents, etc. Now my playing of that composition was a very different matter.  One day I heard a friend of mine play the  Badinage  on his PIANOLA Piano as I knew it ought to be played. I saw how the Metrostyle guided him in expression, how the Themodist brought out the melody, and when I tried it myself I was amazed to see how much more responsive the action of the PIANOLA Piano is to that of my instrument.  These litde things that I supposed originally were non  a essentials make all the difference in the world in die satisfaction and pleasure obtained from the playing.  I have come to depend so much upon music for my home enter- tainment that I now feel I must have the advantage of the best device of its kind.  So that one hundred dollars wasn t saved after all, and I hope you will not make me lose too much on the exchange. There is nothing at all the matter with my instrument, except that as I have become educated in this means of producing music, I find I am not going to be satisfied with any instrument but the best there is.  11 jon want die PIANOLA Piim'i efficiency, yon matt have  he PIANOLA Piaao itself  not u imitation.

Lots and lots of experience is crowded into those eleven years. For there has been greater development in the advertising world during this period than during the quarter-century preceding. No more important advance has been made than in the improved relation between the advertising agent and his customer. Years back we created quite a sensation when we set out to co-operate with our customers and help them get results from the space used through us. Out of this grew our Data-built campaigns our conference idea and our sales development efforts,  a service so complete and comprehensive that our customers say it is as good as service can be. To give a concrete example u to how Mahin Service is regarded by our customer , let us quote the letter recently sent us by the Dain Manufacturing Company, makers of the Great Dain Line of Hay Tools. We established relations with them three years ago. " Dear Sir: The writer it greatly pleased to note from your letter of the 14th that you have secured the account of the Velie Automobile Company. The Mahin Adver- tising Company is certainly forcing to the front when they secure the clientele sueh as you have been gathering in liuly. Considering the incomparable services you have in store for  he Velie Automobile Company, coupled with the aggressiveness of Mr. W. L.

It's speedy because, being reloaded by the recoil of the fired cartridge, it can be shot as last as the trigger can be pulled. It's powerful because it handles a cartridge of the most modem type one that strikes a blow of 2038 foot pounds. The knock-down, shocking power of this cartridge, with its heavy bullet of large diameter, driven with high velocity, is tremendous; and the combination of such power with the rapidity of fire which this rifle is capable of, makes it unusually desirable for hunting the biggest of big game.

The original idea came from Julius Caesar, and was suggested by the uncertainty of human life. It was an insurance against the dissolution of a project in case of death. The intent was to provide for the continuance and perpetuity of enterprises which probably no man could carry out during his lifetime. The first application of the corporation was for building water-systems and laying out roadways. The corporation provided against stoppage of tfie work in case of the death of any man connected with it. ,3  But the corporate life of a great business is not secure against shock, unless the lives of its managers are insured for the benefit of the corporation. Hence we find the big men  the men of initiative and enterprise allowing their lives to be insured at the ex- pense of the corporation which they serve, for the corporation s benefit.  S To guard  gainst the blow of the business blizzard when an able leader dies, The Equitable Life Assurance Society now issues a Corporate Policy. The proceeds are made payable to the Corporation, which is both Applicant and Beneficiary. Thus is the Commercial Craft ballasted and made snug and secure when comes the storm. 3K The Equitable Life Assurance Society will exist when every eye that reads this page is closed forever; when every heart that now throbs is still; when every brain through whose winding bastions thought roams free, has turned to dust. 3X The Equitable will live on, a body without death, a mind without decline. 3S  Only safe, superior and competent men can secure life-insurance nowadays. Life-insurance adds poise, power and purpose to able men. If you are helping to carry the burdens of the world and making this earth a better place because you are here, perhaps you had better write for further information.

Wilcox   White, of Meriden, Conn., began manufacturing an interior attachment, and in February, 1897, built their first  ANGELUS,  a cabinet piano-player. This instrument, the invention of E. H. White, may be regarded as the Pioneer of the Various Similar Attachments which have since been placed upon the market.   CL In a purely commercial sense there have developed strong competitors of the ANGELUS.  Their enormous expenditures for advertising and selling campaigns for years past have doubdess influenced many people to the extent of purchasing without proper consideration of the question of merit   . We do not decry such competition. It has served and is serving to more clearly illuminate the ANGELUS prestige, for the greater the number of people who become interested in player-pianos, the greater the number that must discover, soon or late, that the ANGELUS alone is capable of the finest artistic results. CL. It is the artistic superiority of the ANGELUS which has maintained the ANGELUS in commercial supremacy. Cl. Compare the ANGELUS and its competitors by personal investiga- tion. Let your artistic sense determine your choice. G, If the Melodant were the only exclusive feature of the ANGELUS, this single device would place the AN- GELUS far beyond any other instrument in artistic worth.

Accompanying harmonies are not. They are necessary, but only in the sense that they add to the beauty of a composition. It is therefore most important, if the music is to be artistically rendered, that the melody be em- phasized and everything else subordinated. The Melodant in a wonderful way accomplishes this. No attention from the performer is necessary. To produce a device to do what the Melodant does, has been, and is as much as ever the despair and hope of the imitators. But the Melodant is not all. In addition the following essential features are parts of the ANGELUS only: The PHRASING LEVER  which gives absolute mastery of tempo from slowest to fastest, through every intermedi- ate gradation. This remarkable device has been aptly termed the   Heart of the Angelus.'  for it enables the performer to put his whole personality into everything played to express feeling inspired as the piece progresses. The MELODY BUTTONS  which perfectly control the tonal volume, enabling a change from the loud fortissimo to the delicate pianissimo instantly or gradually so that none of the beauty or artistic effect of the composition is lost. The MELODY BUTTONS also put the accentuation of the melody under the personal control of the performer. The DIAPHRAGM PNEUMATICS give to the playing of any composition that  human touch" which is the life of all real music. The tubes which run from the tracker-board to these pneumatics arc of metal not perish- able rubber, always insuring action true to every requirement. Moreover, the Diaphragm Pneumatics are made without corners or folds, thus insuring long life. In fact, wc have never known one to burst or wear out since we commenced using them twenty years ago. The ARTISTYLE MUSIC ROLLS have in one single expression line the simplest and clearest indications for artistic expression, showing what notes to emphasize, where to subdue, what phrases to accelerate, where to retard. Even the novice soon becomes so proficient that the most difficult music is rendered as easily and well as the most simple. The repertoire of the user of the ANGELUS is un- limited because the ARTISTYLE MUSIC ROLLS provide music to suit every fancy   classical, sacred, operatic, popular, dance. The ANGELUS and the ANGELUS alone permits anyone to play the piano with artistic personal expression.
