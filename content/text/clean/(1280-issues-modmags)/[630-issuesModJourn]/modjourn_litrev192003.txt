principleThe pure windThe bright moonThe clear and thoughtful heart Drawing by HGaudier Brzeska The Wise Man by William Saphier SIX weeks before I was bornmy mothersitting at the windowwatched the sun set behind a small village cemeteryThe cemetery was on a western mountainplaced there by the people to remind them that the end of each day brought them nearer to their own endOne eveningwhen the sun was about to wake the stars and spread a dark blue linen over a quiet sky for them to play onshe heard the cry of a childIt was a soft but distinct soundIt continuedit grewNo one was in the houseNo one was nearHer amazed black eyes grew largerShe knew the cry came from her own bodyfrom under her own heartShe decided to go to her mother in lawmy grandmotherSlowlyas if carrying something she did not wish to spillshe started down to the valleyShe found grandmothera little grey haired lady with eyes of funlikewise watching the sinking sunGrandmother did not believe the storyShe scolded mother for staying alone so much and made her promise to come every evening before sunset and wait for father to return from workThe next eveningjust as the sun kissed the top of some young birches near a clear mountain streammy mother went to my grandmother and began planning for the ceremonies of my arrivalSoon they heard the crying of a childGrandmother ran all over the housesearching inside and outbut soon had to admit that it was the unborn child cryingShe was frightenedand being superstitious took my mother to the rabbi of the villageThe old manwhose thin long beard reminded one of a sneezelistened while his eyes followed two swallowsHe shook his headHe knew littlehe was a poor man in this mountain nestPerhaps the young pregnant woman had heard merely the echo of a shofer on Mount SinaiOr was it the beginning of a prayer to be finished in King Solomon s templesoon to rebuilt in the promised landHe knew notGrandmother sighed and she too shook her headThe rabbi said if she really wanted to know he would give her the address of a great mana rabbi a hundred years oldwho lived somewhere in PolandHe knew everythingHe would surely answer every questionGrandmother took the addressshe was not satisfied with the old man s explanationShe revered and loved the old rabbibut there was something queer about himas every one in town knewOf course she would not believe some of the wildest tales she had heard about himlike the story Long Mary s oldest son toldonceafter sunrisehe had seen the rabbi dance with ashikse a gooseherder with bare feetnear the brook This she could not believebut she knew the old man ate no meat and drank no wine except at religious functionsNo one knew how old he wasand he played many hours with beetles and oak leavesHe was a great scholarGreat men came from distant places and stayed with him many hoursHe had written many books in Hebrewsome saidbut for practical human purposes he was little goodGrandmother insisted that mother go to the great wise rabbi who knew everythingMotherbeing far away from her own folkand father being a good sonthey obeyedFour days after this fatherdressed in his best clothes and mother in a dress made for this one purposeI thinkof red silk and a black lace shawl on her headwere waiting for grandmotherA big green fan father had given her a few weeks before they were married kept mother busyGrandmother soon arriveda purple silk dress with tiny green roses and stiff red birch leavesa lemon yellow and black square patterned shawl and a flaming red handbag completed her beingFather took grandfather s best horsestwo fastmountain cats and his own droshka painted pale blue with old rose panelsHe was continuously brushing his clothes while the women were getting into the vehicleSoon with his orange red beard waving in the windhe started for the nearest large town with a railroad stationThe women went onhe remained behind to his workAfter a few days and in many ways they reached the town in Poland I forget the nameno one except its inhabitants can pronounce itand came to the great rabbiThe old man was very wise and important and it cost considerable to be admitted to his presenceThe house seemed surrounded by beggars in ragsbut with ruddy facesHe listened to my grandmother s taleshe acted as spokesmanThe old man did not even look at my mother who was blushing all the timemaking her red dress appear paleand her big black eyes wandered on the floor and the objects near itShe could not remember his face but remembered his black velvet shoes embroidered with big red roses and the fine green stool under themHe wore a long black silk coatwhite stockings and knee breechesa compromise in color made up the restHe too shook his headhe could not believe itHe wanted to hear it with his own earsWho has ever heard an unborn baby cryToward evening they came again and the rabbi had invited a few of his friends and pupilsstudents of the talmudAll eyes were on motherHer big black eyes again looked to the floor for relief and all the shoes appeared like a lot of big black June bugs moving back and forthA few whispered and the old man in his huge armchair coughed a few times and looked around him like a king on his throneand my mother felt guilty of some horrible crimePresently the cry camefirst very faintthen louder and louderThe setting sun silhouetted stiff heads with curling beards on the clean white calcomined wallAll present held their breathA few of the window panes trembled and the cry grew louder than everIt seemed a protest from the child against these intrudersMother could not longer stand the atmosphereshe ran out of the room cryingThe wise man asked three days to think it overOn the appointed day grandmother came alone to the wise old manHe asked her many irrelevant questions and as if pronouncing sentence said He is not overanxious to come into this worldIt is not good enough for himGo homegood womanand peace be with you She did and slept

streets of a city and over plains into a forest that fringes a riverMy notion is one of escapeI can no longer bear the life led in my father s houseI am a child and cannot escape out of my childhoodThere is a door through which I cannot entera wall I cannot climbThe idea of escape long ago attacked the seat of my reason a quaint fancy as well enough I know that such a thing as reason cannot existIn the streets of a cityafter I had wralked out at the window of a tall buildinga man came to walk with meHe held a small stick in his hand and twirled it over his fingerHe said God would forgive me my transgressions if I would go in at the door of God s house and cease walking up and downGod lies on the ground in the forest with his head at the base of a treeThe fingers of God flutter like the wings of a gnatA little leaf in the foresttouched by the finger of Godwhirls and twists in an agony of delightI have bathed in a stream and walked up and down on prairiesI have been lying at full length in IllinoisI have put my hands into Iowainto Kentuckyinto IndianaKansasOhioNebraskathe DakotasMy mind is the mind of a little man with thin legs who sells cigars in a storeMy mind is the mind of a cripple who died in an alleyway at ClevelandOhioMy mind is the mind of a child who fell into a wellthe mind of one who cleans the streets of a cityof an actor who walks up and down on a stageI double my fists and strike the ground a sharp blowRidges of land squirt out through my fingersI have remade the land of my fathersI have come out of my house to remake the landI have made a flat place with the palms of my handsVII Trains go out of the city of Chicago and into her sisters cities of the valley but the minds of men do not goThe minds of men do not run out over the flat prairiesThe minds of my brothers stay in their housesThe fancies of men are bound with iron bandsThey sleep in a prisonThe flesh of women is no longer sweetWomen are laid in bedsThey have not walked where the wind isTheir legs have not been caressed by winds that blow lowleaping alongscampering over the groundWomen weave laces with their fingers and open their breasts to the eyes of the windows but they do not open their eyes to the morning lightVIII The notion of becoming a Jeremiah pleases my childish fancyI shall be a Jeremiah in the mood that comes over God when he amuses himself by tickling a solitary leaf in a forestI shall walk a long way and sit down in the grassWhen night comes I shall weepThe hot tears that run out of my eyes shall make a little stream in which fishes shall liveMy tears shall be many and shall make a broad river over which birds shall fly in the light of a morningMy tears shall maturea stalk of corn that shall feed a little mouse that shall nibble forever at the foundations of buildings within which the fancies of men have decayedIX You have grey eyes very large and roundYour eyes are like moons rising out of a swamp in NovemberYour eyes are like the eyes of little foxesYour eyes are greyTomorrow they shall be red with weepingas red as a sumac growing beside a dusty road in OhioThe feet of many people are running over the grey of your eyesIt is my passion to run like a frightened little animal over the grey of your eyesMy own story is curiousLong ago I emerged from a hole in the valley where a stream of water runs down over rocksI crept out through the hole to a flat black rock and lay sprawlingI stared at the sunOn all sides of me lay the forestsI went back into the hole naked and came out again on all fours with long hair on my bodyIt was ordained I could not live among menBecause I was naked and ashamed I started to crawl away into the NorthThe hunger that has never been appeased lay deep in meIt is because of my hunger that I have learned to walk standing upthat I have learned to walk up and downIt is because of my hunger I am standing on a yellow place making marks in the sand at the edge of a streamMy place for sand writing is narrow and I write with a dull stick that makes the words crudelyThere are many words I do not knowI have missed many sweet wordsI am a young man in the flush of my passionsI am an old grey man with brittle bonesI am on yellow sand by a stream at dawnThe hair is worn from my body because I have been crawling on my belly through townsIf my sand place were large and long I should be able to tell you a wonderful taleThe water will arise in the stream and wash my story awayThe hair is worn from my body from crawling though townsI am a dumb man crept out of a hole in the hillsI have no wordsThe stick with which I write is dullI have no wordsMy stick is worn awayI wonder why your grey eyes did not come with the dawn and teach me the wordsI was for a long time alone and dumbThere was no word for the whispering windThere was no word for the groaning of treesThere was no word for the false dawn that looked over tht tops of the treesThe light of the true dawn made music among the treesWhy were you not thereWhy did you not give me the wordsYou were in the towns when I crept on my belly like a beastYou had made the towns and they lay on broad plains between hillsOn the street of a town there was a women with black hairShe did not have grey eyesWas she your sisterShe was clothed in a black garment and ran screaming through streetsMany men were tied to posts beneath the eaves of the housesIcicles made from the tears of children hung from the housesThe icicles clung to the eaves of the housesIt was night when I crept into the townsAs I went forwardcreeping like a cat on my bellythe men trembled like leaves in a forest God has touched with his fingersSomething occuredA warm wave of feeling ran up through the menIt ascended to the eaves of the housesDrops of icy cold water fell on the heads of the menThe men were very coldThe woman with black hairclad in a black garmentran past me through the streetsShe screamedI did not learn any new sweet word in the town but I learned to scream like a women in pain to be continued Interim by Dorothy Richardson Chapter EightcontinuedMIRIAM flung down Tansley Street telling her newsHer conflict with the June dust and heat of

blaze of window lightthe Chinese lantern hanging from the hook in the ceilingthe little Madras muslin curtains at either end of the endmost lattices made a picture and set the room free from the challenge of the house accumulating as Miriam had come up through it and preventing the effect she had sought when she put out the green teapot on the sunlit tableShe was receiving MrsBailey as a guestbacked up by the summery little window roomShe stood back in the gloomdropping back into the green lamplit stillness of the farm house gardenThe Song of Hiawatha sounded on and on amongst the

thinking behind her voiceWhen she had gone the silent effect would be theremore stronglyPerhaps she had some new suggestion to make about Sissie Wellyoung ladyI want to talk to you MrsBailey propped one elbow on the mantlepiece and brushed at her shirtMiriam waitedwatching her impatientlyThe Tansley Street life was fading into the glow of the on coming holiday seasonRain was cooling the July

Miriam moved impatiently about the roomBut she could not let herself look at her thoughts with MrsBailey there Wellyoung lady murmured MrsBailey dolorously at last I felt I couldn t do less than come upfor my own satisfaction She thinks I have made a scandalwithout consulting herher mind flewflamingover the gossiping householdover MrsBailey s thoughts as she pondered the evidenceWrenching away

all got to settle in lifesooner or later That was all it was for MrsBaileyShe rallied woefully in the thought that MrsBailey knew she could have settled in life if she had chosenFlickering faintly far away was something to be found behind all thissome silent thing she would find by herself if only MrsBailey would goFascinatedHow did they find the word It was trueand falseThis was the way people

mile away from itIt begins at the corner where the grey purple sweating Hartford Lunch isFrom Broadway into the street the air becomes denserthe facades are more resolutely draba sagging of the Broadway mood makes my heart faint in an indefinite sorrowThis little tragedy happens everydayeach time I am on the way to my houseI walk onwestwardAmsterdam Avenue is low and broadits face is sullen and without a foreheadFood storeslike men that are too fatcigar stores like little bigot spinsters dressed in clothes not dirty but brittle for oldnessBroken and old is the Avenue s bed and adorned only by the car lineThenfurther WestwardI march into open miseryusual red facadesor sick yellow onesriddled full of black windowsRagslike flags of povertydangle from windowsgrey paneswhere misery writes with dust and rain things that the tenants are too dismal to want to cancelOpposite there tower the obese gas tanksdolorous with rustsick with blotches of grey paintgrotesquely solemnAlong this block human beings prefer the street to the homeso they are all outsidethe children playingthe women gossipingthe men loafingBurnt out coal and ashes spilled from the over flowing ash cans are strewn over the bulging and rippled and cracked sidewalkI turn at the corner where the necessary wooden faced saloon isAnd there is West End AvenueWhitish and greenish the housesthe colors of the wives of the poor wopsHere is a valley formed by two smooth asphalt hillsidesAnd here is my houseThe door of it is as dirty and drivelling as the mouth of a very old manwho chews tobaccoWay upstairs are my roomsI enterI open the windowsDamn itwhy does she close them She says that they might get in from the fire escapeI would like to meet the desperado who d be so desperate as to come around these quarters to stealA wave of dank smell has lapped me aroundI have taken a chair and sat downNow I m in my own home2 The rooms face NorthTill ten o clock in the morning we have the sunThe rest of the day it s on the house oppositeIn front of my window there is a straight windowless white walljaggedover its edgewith the chimneysThe chimneys are poised gently against the sky which today is very blueCraning my neck out I can see the riverand the freight railroad station with its asthmatic locomotivesThere was a stretch of bare ground between the railroad and my houseIt was a meeting place for cats and dogs without a homeand at night a fine big hall for their orchestraThat s where they came to dietooor where they threw their corpsesThey went there to fumble in the rubbish for foodA single shoe hereand a pair of shoes down therehalf a disha sauce pan camouflaged by the rusta smashed boxthe brim of a derby and rags hardened with dirta battlefield after the battlewith the lonely corpse of a cat and the lonely corpse of a dogone by the fencethe other in a big crater in the middleThere came children to reconstruewith their fiery imaginationsthe battle of the cats and dogsBut they didn t stay long because it smelled badSometimes after a rain as a great big puddle gathered there you would see them running all around what they called its shoreromancing with little paper boats and seeking the ever new sensation of throwing a stone into the waterNowin that spacethey are building another houseA house like this I supposeIt will be so near the railroad and the asthma of the locomotives is so nastyso soreespecially at nightthat the tenants of the future house won t be able to sleep not until they all become deafAnother poor houseand there are thousands and thousands it s preparednessto build a house to shelter the poorLike making guns and gas masks for the next warAnd the city is totally grey and they re making another grey houseHouses that are born poor and oldor uglyas in the middle class or rich quartersIn Italy I saw houses born white and beautifuland when they were old and miserable they wore their misery like a soldier his uniform that bullets have

the roofit is nearer the skyLet s begin from the roofI breathe better up here than in my room or in the streetIt is sunset timeThe burning clouds breathe the rosy air that caresses me they give me this air the way my wife gives me perfume out of her clothesThis air throws itselfelasticupon the dusty body of that block of houseslover of an old manyoung loverAnd the dust clings still on the housesIt passes through my fingers in ribbons and its silver finger nails open my skull and pluck the stale misery out Of a sudden a great pool of melted thin gold is dropped over the roofI am in itburning crisp like a piece of paperIt is the gold of the sunsetmixed Math the black dust of the night to comeUnder me the great space of bare ground I have mentioned fills slowly with darknessit is an enormous vaserimmed with a blue band of river waterIf I were good my mind would fill slowly with darkness and there would be a play of silent shadows in my mind that and that onlyLife is a beautiful thingif my lungs are goodBut I stretch my arms and my crooked fingers would grasp something more than airNo one knows how young I amDo they want me to become a cheatThere are lots of cheats that want to force you to acknowledge their youththeir beautytheir vigorI am young and aloneIf I were old I would be satisfied being alone and I would sit still and let the darkness swaddle meNightand

go down to my rooms any moreI don t want to see her anymoreI want the earth to stop running around like a damn fooland I want him to listen to a thing I have to sayI want the Earth to stop going and I want him to watch me dieI could touch this intangible air if I sent my body whirling through itin a spider s danceto break over the flagstonesI would give a hundred persons at least the thrill of their livesI want the setting sun to steal my eyes and carry them along with himunder the earthBut I reckon I shall walk down again to my apartmentAnd everyday that cranes its grey face toward me will have my offering of a few wordsI reckon I shall walk down to my apartment and open the door with a yale keyjust like everybodyAnd they will not say that I have gone away from them to find the truthThey will not say I did not love them and they will admit that I am the most American of the AmericansI might at least force them to see my hatredTo see that I hate them more than their husbands domore than their wivesmore than they who feed them and than they who gather their leavingsmore than the waiters and the doctorsAlways my great sadness looms beyond my world and theirsjust as the sun lies beyond all weathersWords do not make me gladand I am not an artistFrightful words uttered by a thousand in a thousand ways are all comprehensible to meas my own word is more frightful than anyThe

REVIEW EditorMargaret Anderson Foreign EditorsJohn Rodker Jules Romains AdvisoryBoardjh Discussion Point Blank WHAT is New YorkWe know that Boston and Chicago and Kansas City are American citiesSo are NewarkNew Jerseyand DenverColoradoAmerican citiesBut just what is New YorkIt would not get us anywhere if we asked a New YorkerIf he understood us at allwhich is not likelyhe would only be bewildered by our questionAs well ask him what the earth isTo Americans at any distanceNew York is a foreign countryLike Cairo and Bucharest and ConstantinopleAmericans travel to New York in the same psychic temper as they would to an Eastern MetropolisThey behave in New York as they would never behave in Boston or Chicago or Kansas City or DenverNew York never becomes quite real to themnotwithstanding its enormous substantialityNew York is always an Eastern CityRatherNew York is the illustration of a fableThe marvel is that such thing can beBut if a New Yorker can not tell us anything about New Yorkhe can tell us everything about AmericaWere you to ask a New Yorker what America ishe would take your question with the solid seriousness of a crossing policemanOnly much more soAsk a New Yorker what America is and he tells you with the greatest gusto and the most naive self assurance that America is a New York state of mindHe will write you a booktelling you all about Americaif you will only wait a momentHe may write you a book about America even if you do not wait for itHe has already done itThe New Yorker is led to believe that America is what he thinks it is by the same psychic mechanism that leads an infant to believe that its cries and grimaces produce its own motherThe infant swallows the not selfthe outer worldthe New Yorker swallows AmericaAnd just as the infant is enabled to maintain its fantastic assumptions by repeated verificationsits cries and grimaces actually bringing the wished for motherjust so are the New Yorker s fantastic assumptions about America being repeatedly verifiedFrenchmen and Englishmen tell him that he has achieved the marvel of the agesA modern miracleA mystery of AmericaA drama and a spilling of revelationAnd as long as this ululation continues there is no likelihood that the New Yorker will find out that he does not know and never can know America as long as he does not get out of New YorkAs long as the New Yorker s fantastic assumptions produce substantial resultsthe New Yorker is not likely to learn that to be in Chicago and Kansas City and Denver he must get out of New YorkHe must get out of New York to get into America in the same sense that a man must get out of his coat to get into his shirtsleevesHe must shed his intellectual baggage and introspectionJust as the infant must abandon the belief in the omnipotence of its magic cries and grimaces before it can learn the reality of the outer worldjust so must the New Yorker abandon the belief in the magic power of his insight before he can learn the reality of AmericaThe merits of these booksin so far as they are not merits of description and explanation of Americaare all beside the pointI have just finished reading Willa Sibert Cather sMy Antonia As a serious work of literary fiction the book has little enough meritIt were childish to compare it with such a work asTelle the Conqueror for instanceBut as a recordas a description and explanation of a large part of Americaits merits are quite considerableReading itI could not keep from wondering what the effect would have been on Waldo Frank sOur Americaif he had readMy Antoniaand understood its essential verityFor MrsCather s description of Our America of the prairies is as authentic as any of Waldo Frank s descriptions of his state of mindFor all their differenceIt is beside the point to say that Waldo Frank has produced a more meritorious piece of work than MrsCatherMrsCather s painful sentimental ism is also American terribly Americanif you willAnd it is also American in the sense that Waldo Frank s language and style are not yet AmericanAnd now comes MrJames Oppenheimin the February Dialand tells us again that America is a state of mindThe state of mind of ourintelligentsia this timeIt is a mean opinion of Americaor else an infantile self absorbtionthat would represent Americaand represent it trulyby the little handful of oursemi lyricalpoetsFor the entire output of oursemi lyricalpoets could be thrown inlost and smothered in the work of a single Irish poetThe fact that MrJames Oppenheimlike Waldo Franktalks the language of theunconsciousonly proves that one may talk quite as much nonsense in the language of the unconscious as one ever could in the language of the consciousMrJames Oppenheim makes a distinction between hereditary factors and environmental factorsthat we may not be fooled by themhe saysHe then goes on to say thatthe startling sameness in American exteriors argues that there is a corresponding diversity in the unconscious Just what does MrJames Oppenheim mean by the statement of our startling samenessDoes he mean that you could not tell apart Sherwood Anderson and Theodore Dreiser and Floyd Dell and William Hard and James Oppenheim and Waldo FrankThere is no such distinction between heredity and environment as MrJames Oppenheim seems to believe existsOur environment is also inherited and imposed upon us by our forebears andtyranny of tyranniesit is imposed upon us at a time when we are least able to resent the impositionBut such it isWe need not even go so far as the implication of the pragmatic statement permits usForif a thing is what it is known asit must also be where it is known asIndeedthe pragmatists make no distinction between cow and pastureA cow without a pasturethey sayis the sister of the economic manBut let heredity and environment he what they mayLet MrJames Oppenheim defend the proposition that sameness of exteriorwhether it exists or notargues a diversity in the unconsciousIt cannot be done successfullyTheunconsciousis another name for the infantile mindand if we add to it the intra uterine mind we are sure to have the whole businessIt is in utra and in our infancy that we are most alikeand only as we grow up do we show such differences as we haveIf it was not MrJames Oppenheim s intention to sayAmericathat is I then he has given himself all that trouble to an undesirable endBut it was not my intention merely to discover the limits of MrJames Oppenheim s capacity for self infatuationWhen he tells us that we may not judge America by a given number of heroeshe tells us what we all know to be soA merchant is pretty generally forced to buy his merchandise upon his judgment of the drummer s samplesand the farmer frequently has to purchase his supplies from the representations of pictures and text of a catalogBut in the endwhat the merchant and farmer both pay for is the goods deliveredAnd here the analogy stopsFor the merchant and the farmer are not defrauded when the goods delivered is above what they had been led to expectIt is not so with a literary productionA literary representation becomes a false representation the instant it ceases to be a true representationExaltation and degradation are alike fraudulentBut MrJames Oppenheim asks us toimagine Wood row Wilson or Billy Sunday or TRas the hero of a novelHow quickly each would become wooden and unconvincing Welllet us oblige MrJames OppenheimLet us imagine Woodrow Wilson or Billy Sunday or TRas heroes of novelsI haveI find that they do not grow wooden and unconvincingThey grow alive and most convincingLet me carry this a bit furtherLet us imagine Abe Lincoln born and brought up in Massachusetts or New YorkLet us imagine Abe Lincoln born and brought up in the Illinois of todayLet us imagine Abraham Lincoln as born and brought up where and when he was but without Stephen DouglasNow let us imagine the eloquent facts as we know them to have been at a given time and placeLet us imagine Abraham Lincoln as he actually wasthrown among the politicians and learned superiors at the very moment when he delivered the Gettysburg AddressAnd when we have done that we know that MrJames Oppenheim is lacking in many thingsamong which is the knowledge of the simple enough facts that Abraham Lincoln was not asportin the Illinois of his dayAnd now let us imagine TRand Woodrow Wilsontogetheras the heroes of a novelas I have imagined themTR Set out to be a leaderDid not care whether he led forward of back or up in the airFell down in an attempt at the latterEnter Woodrow WilsonLooks neither forward nor backnor would he be helped by the sight of objective facts nor subjective possibilitiesbecause of the rigidity of mind that follows upon a violent repudiation of certain infantile attractionsFollows pertinacious temperament doggedlyKept within definable bounds by a meddling sentimental friendSubstantial gentlemen who must have fixed points of departure very much disturbedPermit slow emergence of TRTRemerges behind smoke screenRises to the position of chief heckler of Woodrow Wilson and cheer leader for substantial gentlemen who want fixed point of departureKnows the mean nature of his leadershipresents it and the company he is inbut is not strong enough to break away and go it alone forward or backWoodrow Wilson still without a policyworriedbut cannot break with his temperamentForced to keep in front but always in sight of TRIn desperationgoes abroadhopes to be able to accomplish abroad what he is unable to do at homeTRdiesWoodrow Wilson left without an enemy to guide himBreaks with his temperamentFinds he has broken himselfThat this novel may never be written argues nothing against it in the limited sense in which I used itIt might be writtenand that alone is quite sufficient to disprove MrJames Oppenheim s assertionISRAEL SOLONThe Last Word THE Little Review allows me to accept the work of the Baroness von Freytag Loringhoven as artbut objects to analytical comment Making no compromise with the public tasteis now easily interpreted as the line inscribed over the door of the temple by the hand of the priestfor it is the priest who demands an audience that appreciates at the expense of the critical facultiesIt is strange that MrIsrael Solonhimself objecting to what he seems to consider the presumption of a definite and individual viewpointshould accuse me of guardingourliterary traditionI said that I saw in the author ofThe Cast iron Lovera strange and beautiful obliviousness to all but the dominating emotionandafter some analysis of the psychology involved in producing this effectincluded her ecstasy among the properties of artThis is thehecklingcriticism which is the excuse of the heckling MrSolon for trying to saddle me with a defense ofourlegendWhose I wonderAnd what of an interpreter of modern art to whom psychology is an esoteric scienceI call the Baroness a naked oriental in the sex dance of her religionbut I indicate a conviction that as such she expresses a limited realityIn return MrSolon gives us a diatribe about cellars and combed airCriticism after all is in a sense the process for those who desire to preserve through the welcome confusion of living the continuity necessary for an individualized outlookIf I took my poetic airwashedby MrSolonas my mentor seems to thinkI would not call forth his disapprovalAs it happens I do my own washing and combing and thus invite his censoriousnessAs for his horrible jibe to the effect that I have a sophisticated mindI should say to this un sophisticated person that sophistication is another requisite for the critic as he desires for the time being to distinguish himself from the creatorfor analysis and classification take for granted previous experiences which will afford comparisons and a certain amount of detachment from personal prejudice which is only possible to the keenly self awareCertainly I found The Cast Iron Lover crude and vulgarbut I should like MrSolon to quote literally any utterance of mine which would indicate that I consider crudity and vulgarity elements to bar out a poetic spiritAgainwhen I hold an opinion I naturally assume it to be correctHow otherwise can one think at allIf when I make an assertion I at the same time admit its contradictionI simply refuse to assume any responsibility whateverBut doubtless MrSolon is defending his own blithe method which seems to lie in a very irresponsible type of attackfor he does not hesitate to condemn one in advance for a point of view to which one has never committed oneself when two such different minds meet there is not even the possibility of a common understanding of word valuesword values come from personal values saysjh For purposes of artistic creationyesand in all cases of course the selection of one s vocabulary gives a personal flavour to one s speechbut ifjhbelieved what she says she would have attempted no rebuttal of my previous statementsHoweverthis remark does not astonish me as the whole tenor of her counter comment isin the traditional sensesurprisingly feminine The Baroness von Freytag to quotejhfurther will think us feeble minded Ifjhhad not printed below some remarks from the lady I might be more awed by the threatbut I can not believeafter reading this semi intelligible prosethat the mental processes of the Baroness ever achieve that completion of their cycle which results in thoughtShe alas appears to suffer from temperamental disabilitiesShe is farfar too inspired to think I never thought to proceed with these excerpts fromjhof discussing those psychological peculiarities in the artist which are beyond the reach of the willHaven t those things been recognized and summed up even by the layman inartists are born not madeHasjhany particular objection to the introduction of a fresh viewpoint so that she requires all opinion to be delivered from the angle of her preconceptionAs to her last observationI should say that until all artists are born the same no amount of recognition and summing up could be considered final Consciousness she continues does not mean the sum of ungovernable dispersed facultiesConsciousness means complete being In one placejhrefers to consciousness ascomplete being whereas in a previous paragraph she bars from a consideration of consciousness these psychological peculiarities which lie beyond the reach of the willHow can that be complete from which there is so much arbitrarily excludedI wonder thatjh who only admits to that part of the mechanism of consciousness which is under the control of the willhas persuaded herself to print MrJoyce sUlysseswhich reveals so wonderfully the irresponsibility of subjective life jhtells us that madness is not diseaseDisease is a deflection from the normal order of practical survival and in this category is undoubtedly madnessI am quite willing where possiblehoweverto accept revelations from a diseased mindin spite of the presuppositions of MrSolon who imagines that to describe a quality in terms which convention considers condemnatory is to refuse its valuesA person with a workable imagination may call a man a thief in a profoundly complimentary senseso when I discover disease in the Baroness it is notfrom the artistic standpointan assertion of unqualified disfavor There can be no legitimate standard for valuing the order of sanity higher than the order of madnessexcept a moral onejhdeclaresforgetting that even art has its necessitiesThere areafter allpractical values for the artist as for everyone elseand surely his primary need is for the conditionwithin and withoutwhich will allow him to createHowever luridly intense the vision of immanent madnessthe culmination of insanity is the death of creationThat will which tojhincludes everything in the reproductive act of the artistdisintegratesand even if this Avere not true it is impossible to pass on to others the intimacies of disorder for which no medium exists If one has the power to evoke he has more power than the evokedjhgives us this dictumbut in what manner is this a contradiction of my statement that evocation implies in him who commands not an absolute but a limited ascendance But if the artist wishes to show other men he has had this experiencefirst he willsintends unconditionallythen he must not choose with his mind but with his consciousness the subject matter which will best communicate his experienceand then by deliberate and intense activity of his consciousness he must produce the formscolorsrhythm of his invention He chooseshe saysnot with his mind but with his consciousnessIs not this suggestion of faculties involvedwhich lie beyond the domain of orderable intelligencea confession thatjh toobelieves that ungovernable elements give the quality to inspiration The power of willed selection only inheres in mindIn beginning her discussion she eliminates all that lies outside of mind and in this latter paragraph the order of her argument is inverted the will is so powerful that it creates the being the state of consciousness it desires Buthow jhIs she not delving again into the realm of the subconsciousness which she voted to ignoreSurely this profound desire which stirs the darkness brings forth shapes which reflect those psychological peculiarities of the artist that our critic refuses to consider Unless I had tried to begin my discussion far beyond the cause which may be pathological and the effect which is not beyond the support of knowledge and academic definition I should feel that I had offered an affront and an insult to Else von Freytag Loringhoven I am not interested in guarding the hypersensitive feelings of the Baronessbut in appraising an artistic effectand to do so honestly I consider it necessary to begin at the beginningand the beginning of every work of artor of every attempted work of art is in the soul or consciousness of him who created it All that she says is truejhconcedes me but it does not make sense because it does not fit this discussionjhis in a position of vantage as she can exercise the editorial perogative of the last wordShe can refuse to publish my retortbut once admitting me to her pages she can notI should thinkrule out my statements simply because they do not

of this eventthe last man of four hundred million had been annihilated and resurrected in aesthetic graceRed Dragon left and travelled west to see what could be done with EuropeAmong us he found not a tigerbut his rampant relationcoloured greenRed Dragon recognized himand then began that great sporting event called by the mediaevalists Hunting the Green LionRed Dragon is a trinityOf the Triune pack the Father of the Virtuesthe Son of the Sciences hunt Green Lion yetRed DragonSpirit of the Artsis on a wider casta little behindand off the open leadHis operation is a chase till the green beast is run downwhen he bites off his headwhich was the exact fate of the TigerIn deference to man s immortality and what appear to be the facts of the caseGreen Lion rises from that bite no longer a lionbut his own pursuera New Creatureanotherbut the identical celestial Red DragonThis is a mystey and would have been better recognized in the classical age than thisOur trinity may catch its lion hereand after successful operation in Europe may fly the Atlantic when wisdom and the hour are agreedAnyhow the result of their labours is the rebirth of John and Mary Smith from the stuffy womb of egocentric nonsense to the creative energies of saintsmagicians and artistsOn the subject of the review it may be said that none of the three dragon rebirths seems to have shot out straight in the person of MrThomas VaughanHe is not an initiated saintcomplete magicianand by magician one means the immortal scientistthe hermetic philosopher or the artist whose approach to reality is through pure formThe last is a pity for he could write wellHe is suggestivetiresomedevotedcuriouseruditecharming and involvedBut there is no fusionthe word is never quite made fleshThree dragons after him at once it is clear were too much for himEach had a biteIt is a pity not one of them snapped off his headMARY BUTTSEva Gauthier THE interesting thing about hearing Eva Gauthier sing her modern songs is that she proves definitely how slowly the art of singing developsEven in those special singersto whom has come the need of singing the modernsthe idea of how to sing them lies deadEva Gauthier has all the things necessary to distinguish her from the singing proletariatPonselleSundeliusand the rest Eva Gauthier s needs are interestingbut she cannot prove it because she has never thought of inventing an instrument to suit her needsShe is truly one of the first of the great army of singers to realize what has happened and is happening to musicIt is a genuine tragedy that she cannot tell of her experience in a manner worthy of such a special thingWhen composers like Stravinsky and Ravel make orchestrations they find it necessary to invent many new sounds or ratherthe new sounds find them jhsays old fashioned painters aren t born anymore I would add that old fashioned composers are not born any more eitherUnfortunatelymusic does not stop at its creationIt must be performed re created and when a Latin finds he has aclearvoice that isfree from obtrusive tonsils he affects agal lantreand begins to singThis was all very well for the recent sterile Italian composers who considered it an aesthetic achievement to be able to write a lot of scales and runs and cadenzas forfloridvoicesandflowing melodiesfor smooth velvety voices which could perform tricks like sustaining a note for a minute or more while the audience held its breathwaiting for the customary explosion of applauseetc etcAny intelligent person will agree that this period in music is dead and always was deadalso that music in Italy never existed on the basis of conception performance has always been the intention Paganini and his tricksTherefore it seems to mewith music progressing almost as rapidly as the other artsthat singing alone stays and is content to stay where it was a hundred years agoTeachers talk ofbel canto as a foundationbut still they admit that there aren t any voices now as there were inthe old days Why does it never occur to them that sounds have their evolution as well as other thingsBut still they harp atbel canto How can a fresh emotion come to Life through a medium as threadbare as thatA new intention of singing must existnew sounds exist in the orchestraand two or three artists have found them on the pianoAnyone with the slightest feeling of evolution would agree with meWhy doesn t some singer carry on what Mary Garden has startedand study the sounds she makes with her voice when she is Melisandefor instanceShe has come nearer to making what I callthe new soundsthan anyoneEverywhere I go I find professional singers who have spent years training their voicesand critics who have a line on musical historyetc saying Mary has no voice This ignorance is incomprehensible to meEven a higher grade of human beingto whom has come the appreciation of her arthas little to say of her voiceThis is still more discouragingI do not intend writing a Mary Garden essaybut I should like to tell why I think the human voice the most interesting of instrumentspossessing the greatest possibility for variety of soundsMiss Garden has proved thisI cannot think of more interesting sounds than the sounds of her voiceNaturallythe emotonal quality intensifies and aside from that it is the richest thing I knowThat no one realizes that she isn t trying to sing like Muzio or Raisa is a pityfor they miss the beginning of the most interesting era in the art of singngIf a man who had never heard anything but a violincellowere to hear an oboe he would say it plays the music correctlythat is it gets bybut it hasn t any beauty of tone If he were not going in for new things he would not realize that the oboe possessed a subtlety thecello did notMary Garden knows the value of these various soundsWhen she sits in the tower window as Melisandeand sings an ancient sounding balladhow much she sounds like an oboeIt is inevitable thathad Debussy written Melisande s song in the orchestra he would have made the oboe sing in that scenethe oboe possessing that distantlonelyancient feelingSo Gardeninstead of seeing howclearorevenher voice can beproceeds to paint a design you can never forget Beauty of tonein the conventional sense means no more to Mary Garden thancomplementary colorsin the conventional sense means to Boris Anisfeld or than sing song rhythm means to poetryTherefore the method of study for singers must changeModern singers cannot afford to waste their time learning to sing the old way to be able to sing the newModern composers don t study to write like Beethovenmodern sculptors don t study as Michel Angelo didWhy is singing the lowest type of all artistic activityThe method of development of a modern singer is that of singingthinkinglisteningand to hell withhead resonancechest tones passage of the voice and all those wonderful things the horrible looking Italian bravo tenors possess they who remind one of a wagonload of manure who take so many years off our livesThere is no hope for them but surely the modern type of singer who has even the faintest power of conception can advance singing so that it may still have a chance amongs the artsOne is disappointed in Gauthier because one expects more from a singer who has a head that looks like hersThe really exciting thing about her recital was her choice of songsBut they need to be sung with a new technicotherwise they are as worthless as Mischa Lev itzki playing at ScriabineEBTolstoi and May Sinclair THE opening paragraph ofjh sreview ofThe Power of Darknessputs me in mind of the caged canary who said to its feathered neighbor in the peroquet Don t strut about like thatyou silly birdEven if you have more colors on your back than Iyou should know that yellow is the most beautiful color in the worldAnd besidesyou needn t plume yourself so haughtily because you can ape the gibble gabble of those poor humansIf you really knew what the words meant you wouldn t be so ready to repeat themI shouldn t have to remind you that my life is fuller than yoursI can singBut you don t know what you re singing about replied the peroquet And what is moreyou re pigmy in size for a birdAhthat s just it said the canarygleefully My universe is larger than yoursjust because I am smallI have more room to fly about in Let me say at the outset that I am perhaps a trifle old fashionedthat isnot entirely sensorial when it comes to talking about booksstatues and picturesI don t say this because I exchange cards withjh in the continental sensefor the vindication of TolstoiAs for Romain Rollandanother sensitive membrane with meI believe the man who wroteJean Christopheand some of the best music and art criticism of our time can well handle the foils on his ownMy naive unmodernityif such indeed it iscan be best illustrated by the broad generalization thatlike Bertrand RusselI start by admitting the palpable facts of present day societylife with all its known gradations of sensitive feeling and thoughtI include in my visionmoreoverthe evolution of what is sometimes flatteringly called civilizationThat isI can see the operation of the teleological in lifethe conscious motivation of actionas well as the subconsciousI do not overstress the consciousknowing full well that it is limited and thatin a great number of casesit is merely a wordThis brings me to Edna Kenton s definition of May Sinclair s method inMary Olivierasthe subconscious approach to the representation of life The implicationpsychologically speakingis absurdThe subconscious undoubtedly functions in Mary Olivieras in everybody elseBut when Mary Olivier or May Sinclairto be exactputs down her sensationsemotions and thoughtsas we assume she does within the novelist s conventionthe artistic upshot is but remotely controlled or conditioned by the aboriginal Mary Olivier s subconscious selfBoth the conscious or conativeas well as the censorwhich is a subtle fusion of conscious and unconscious impulsesstain or bias the nude material in the course of the processThere is always a certain amount of will in everything one doeswill being merely a slower response to immedite stimuli and a keener dependence on the dynamic impulse alembricated by memoryassociation and image formingAt this pointalthough I seem to have wandered for a pastureI find myself in complete agreement withjhwhen she says in another place If a man s an artist everything he produces is a blood relation to himselfhe creates in his own image his boobs do not remain boobs Literallyif one has the cluein his own imageAnd the boobs do not remain boobs unless the author himself happens to be a boobIn other words if I may put it utility wise jh whether she knows it or notis pending for conscious or intellectual control in creative effortfor organizationfor harmony and counterpoint in artHow else are many good artists to escape boobery What about the booby moments which even the genius may haveIs an artist always in high fettleAnd if we concede that consciousnessso calledis just as much impulse in the broad sense as subconsciousnessthen we must also admit that will power is creativeSubconsciousnesshoweverwithout the aid of will or directioncannot be creative for the reason that it is composed of the most primitive impulsesimpulses allied in character to those which make a baby cry or want to test things out by bringing them to its mouthThese impulses will never be able to write a book likeMary Olivier It s the whole mental and aesthetic organism of May Sinclair that produced the bookIn briefit is sophisticated expressionwhich art largely isTakefor examplethe chapters that deal with Mary at the age of nine and compare them with the thoughts and utterances of the heroine ofThe Young Visiters It is evident that the artist must use a conventionwhich implies direction or mental controlAny half skilled dialectitianif he were so mindedcould easily overthrow your theory of insanity in art growing out of the case of Else von FreytagWe have no quarrel with the artist if he is insane in the domestic circleor in the sanitoriumbut if his insanity implies lack of direction in art we may have a new phenomenonabsorbing and curiousbut is it necessary to abuse still further a word which has been stretched to the point of absurdityRemember I am speak ing only of directionThere is no difference in the emotivityfor in this regard sane and insane are alikeI have perhaps drifted a little beyond my depthI wanted to say a word about TolstoiTolstoi s mental control or directionif we agree so to name itwas often misplacedIt was too vehemently reformist in tendencyBut I wouldn t damn him outright for this reasonFordespite his essay on arthe was a great artist as you may see from innumerable passages in his booksIndividual scenes inThe Power of Darknessasfor examplethe one between the hired man and the little girl on the stoveprove itHis vision was not the vision of the Little ReviewBut even if you do not approve of his viewpointhis method was the method of a great artist At timesas inAnna Kareninaand inThe Death of Ivan Illyitchhe broke his traces TrulyI am not disposed to splinter a lance withjhaboutThe Power of Darknessbecause in the main I agree with herThe first paragraph of her reviewhoweveris too devastating to be anything but shortsighted and two dimensionalIn criticism there is no excuse for astigmatism or muddleheadnessPIERRE LOVING jhto the readers of the Little Review GreetingsBe it hereby known for the hundredth time that I make no attempt to write criticismThe offerings above my name may be called notesarticlesopinionseditorialscomplimentsattacksmurderbut MrLoving should recognize criticism if he is going to define criticismI can but briefly take up one point in MrLoving s article Conscious or intellectual controlorganizationetcare the obvious essentials in creative efforttechniquewhich simply should mean

Joyceish as it goes onand then some ofjh sbitter and biting critiquesShe attacksMary Olivier which I enjoyed To be continuedThe Reader Critic The Good Old Days everything she criticises is scathingly and contemptuously dismissed as beneath her noticeHowever I thoroughly enjoyed her description of the poseurs who inhabit the Villageso true and so graphically expressedeven if that is contemptuous it is just and amusingWhen she writes about concrete things I think she is very interestingbut when she analyzes abstract ones she is vague and often antagnoizes meFor instancesuch an expression of

mindcouldn t be very familiarsincereto the publicHere she is not vague of coursebut quite clearHowever great artists of other times have conveyed beautiful ideassimplyand reached even the most naive mindsWhy not nowOnly because modern artists are madwrithing and grotesquely posturingdrugged with neurotic and oblique feelingTo read and see and feel such art leaves one with the same sick nausea and distaste as when one has become a party to some shameful orgySherwood Anderson I don t understandbut somehow I respect him and feel his bigness and fitnessMCAs criticisms on music are to me as the word of GodThese I can feel and appreciate even if I can t always follow themThere is no barbed wire shaft in such writingbut only concentratedintense convictionRight or wrong she is not trying to be brillant and originalOf course I know that this is an outburst of what you would call the reactions of the obvious mind I often think we should get out a pamphlet on Art that could be used as a dictionary by the laymanA sort of questions and Answers affairOn the left hand pages we could print all the stock platitudesfor instance AVhy don t modern artists convey beautiful ideas simplyto reach even the most naive mindsetc and on the right hand pages the answersfor instancethe very obvious fact that the conditions surrounding the artist in any given age have been substantially those of any other age and probably always will be etc etcPeople could memorize all the answers factshistoryetc and conversation could progressI really don t know what to say tp all these denunciations these neurotic excesses that we are so generally accused ofThe Dobree story was a bit of cause and effect that should worry no oneIf every one knew something about these matters we should all be protected

human beings wrorking at a situation more interestingly than you will ever find them doing it in lifethis alone is one of the chief properties of Art Dorothy Richardson is so unlike Joyce that I can t even begin to argue that with you though I m sure there are some five thousand people who will agree with you because Richardson and Joyce have the great soul bond of unconventional punctuationAs to shame people who feel shame about anything they do weren t led into their actions by any needs great enough to countShame is only a very patent mark of the incompletely bornOan you imagine ShakespeareNapoleonCleopatra covered with shameCan you imagine James Joyce ashamed of what he writesWhy on earth this great antagonism toward the artist s expressionYou are probably the kind of person who allows every one you know to express himself as he likesno matter how he may bore you or how futile and ordinary you may know him to be Ah you will say lie can t help ithe s that wayas he ruins your life with his stupidityWhy do you never saythe artist can t help ithe s that way Nothingness is excused on every handUnrestrained mediocrity is encouragedAny manifestation of life that goes a bit beyond these states leaves every one who meets it uncomfortablevaguely antagonizedNaturallysince it is a challenge to his incompletionArt is a challenge to lifeEvery one can save himself all this

as powerless to change him as wou be any efforts to produce himMCA Literal Israel SolotiNew YorkI meant to comment onjii sremarks aboutThe Power of Darknessin the January numberThere is no doubt at all in my mind that there is something congenitally incompatible in the Norsk and Russian charactersIbsen hated TolstoyBut into this I dare not venturesince it is one of my pet bugsBut there is no doubt that Tolstoy did not write the play he thought he didnor did he write the play that I had thought he didand that everybody seems still to think he didI read the play when I was a boyand was profoundly moved by itIt was badly conceived by the present company and badly cast and badly actedButall that asideto my astonishmentI found that the power of darkness was mostly in Tolstoy s own head so far as this particular play is concernedNot another inch will I go with youThe Power of Darkness I have foundis nothing other than our old friend Don Juanbetraying his father repeatedlythen driven to commit suicidevicariouslyin the true Christian fashion and finally compelled to confess the betrayal of his father to the betrayedby that means aiming toand succeeding intempering the power of his wrathThis final confession with which the play closes must have had a terrifying inner meaning to TolstoyBut to us who are grown up about all such matters the confession looks pretty much like an excuse for crowding the stage at the fall of the final curtainWhen you say that James Joyce is defying all the boobs in Dublin it meant to meif I were to judge you solely by that statementoras The
