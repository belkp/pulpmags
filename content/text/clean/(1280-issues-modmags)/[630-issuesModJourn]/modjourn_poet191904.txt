wind Draws where the quaken asps were yellow and white And the leaves spun and spun like money spinning We poured them onto the trail and rode for town  Men in the fields leaned forward in the wind Stood in the stubble and watched the cattle passing The wind bowed all the stubble shook like a shirt We threw the reins by the yellow and black fields and rode And came riding together into the town Which is by the gray bridge where the alders are   The white barked alder trees dropping big leaves Yellow and black into the cold black water Children little cold boys watched after us The freezing wind flapped their clothes like windmill paddles Down the flat frosty road we crowded the herd High stepped the horses for us proud riders in autumn  RUNNING VINES IN A FIELD  Look up you loose haired women in the field From work and thoughtless picking at the ground Cease for a little pay me a little heed  It is early the red leaves of the blackberry vines Are hoar with frosty dew the ground s still wet There is vapor over toward the summer fallow And you three make a garden being put by Since you are too old for love you make a garden  It is love with me and not these dark red frosty leaves The vines of which you root for garden space You will be concerned you three used up and set by I could speak of the red vines of pastures of young trees And you would dibble at love as you do the vine roots  It is early but before your backs be warmed And before all this dew be cleared and shed I shall be half among your hearts with speech Love and my sorrow the disastrous passages   H L Davis  So that you ll cease all gardening dangle dark red Vines in your hands not knowing it and whisper  They forget me for a little pride of old time  A FIELD BY THE RIVER  I see a white river bird and I see the women Among the weeds the light of their dresses between Quick willow leaves and I see that there the wind Comes like a bird from the river and blows their dresses Today their pleasure s among willows and high cold weeds Where the flood bred pale snapdragons in the shade  I lie in the high grass by the spring at their door And hear them across the white stubble of their own field s Edge along the willows in the sand where the reaper Has never been driven they go It was the flood margin At the flood margin which they feared their pleasure is Their white dresses fly where the water felt at the young  grain  It seems they are silent looking at the white bird Does it follow us here And one looking to the sky No There is nothing now till spring to be anxious for They are through reaping the grain is gone and two seasons Are to come before spring comes so enjoy the day They come pleasantly through high weeds old foam in the  branches   IN THE FIELD  The young grass burnt up so hot the air was And I was lying by her knee near the cool low Spring branch in sight of the green shining meadow How red her mouth was how fine her hair and so cool Her hair was cool as the ground I thought how red Her mouth was and wondered at her white wrists Another would have meddled not have let me lie Another would have laughed when I put in items her beauty But she was still like any scene or the sky  Her red mouth her wrists so white This is cool blood And it is deep since it colors your mouth only I wonder and wonder at you do you seem best Playing with your hand in the dirt like any dumb person For then you are like a black river bird at rest Or like a poet sitting on the stairs among The people like yours and talking familiarly with them I wonder at you moreover because of your people Whose daughters should not seem sweet yet you seem to me Pleasanter to touch than are the light breast feathers Of a bird and your heart plays lowers more like wind It is pleasure to lie by your knee here in the fields  I say yet the white alders and the willows switching And the weaving of thin graceful weeds pleased me more Than to own pastures because of her beauty But say Nothing like Come away because her people   H L Davis  Work with her now where about cold low springs the smoke From waters at morning stains the cold air all day  THE GYPSY GIRL  One cherry tree beside the house in this low field Is yellow and bright colored now Several weeds Are full of brown seed and the ground is drying out hard What is not picked now in the garden will never be picked In this fall by this garden of gray stems and seeds I sit in what dusty grass is left and words Come in groups like floss upon the pale green water They concern the gypsy girl fat with child and sickly Complexioned who I think made me offers  Her long black hair And yellow face above the pale green water at nightfall  The gypsy girl was sallow as if with nightfall Paler looking because of the necklace of red beads And because of her rings and bracelets of heavy silver There was a silk scarf green and yellow upon her hair Her most dark and heavy hair bound at the back in small Silver bands all heavy and light colored and green silk Was her bright dress which was stretched with her young  one So that its pattern shaped into big ungodly flowers She came through the short willows she came beside me Smiling as if a crowd were watching her from the weeds   What is not picked now in the garden will never be picked I say before this garden  I felt her child s heart beating And for thinking of that heart and of her lover The Come there is some good place near and the feel of  her hand I would not answer This which might have dispersed The many girls who have appeared to me sleeping I would not consent to  It was that I say to the sand Nevertheless as if to one person Dear love departed Can some season not freshen us I am disheartened Are there many like the dark girl are there many like me  But what is not picked now in the garden will never be picked  THE SPIRIT  In the early spring the fattening young weeds Appear all green their veins stretched amongst their dead And every sand hill with its bundle of willow And young green riding the sand is my pleasant walk The river every rock there and the wind Molding cold waves have seen a spirit by day Which I would see and now that my heart s a poor hired  one Which owns no favor or love but did awhile   H L Davis  I walk my pleasant walks Where the new dark red Willows feather in sand against the sky I make out a spirit sitting by the new grass The sun shines yellow on the hair and a wind blows That would melt snow but her face calls it on And her hands are quiet in her red sleeves all day All my pleasure begins when you come to this place I am sorry for it spirit yet I most wished it Has my heart commanding shamed me to your eyes Never in life shall these eyes see you shamed I half live like a stalk but no girl orders me  MY STEP GRANDFATHER  My step grandfather sat during the noon spell Against the wild crabapple tree by the vines Flies about the high hot fern played or fell To his beard or upon the big vein of his hand With their playing he seemed helpless and old in a land Where new stumps piles of green brush fresh burnt pines Were young and stubborn He mentioned the old times As if he thought of this I have marched and run Over the old hills old plowed land with my gun Bumping furrows oh years old But in this new place There is nothing I know I ride a strange colt  You know old times and have seen some big man s face Out of the old times what do you remember most   General Lee Once they called us out in a cold Plowed field to parade for him He was old with frost I remember our style of dress my dead friends last long I would have thought longer and there were peaked  women Who watched us march and joked with us as they were  trimming The green shoots of wild roses to eat But these with me Lack what the other has they are not so strong And lost battles I would be prouder starving in rain And beaten and running every day with General Lee Than fat and warm winning under another man  Alone presently I laid myself face down To avoid seeing the field and thought of how the book Describes Esther and imagined how that queen might look Preferred for beauty in her old fields red and brown I am like my step grandfather I thought and could Follow whatever I love blind and bold Or go hungry and in great shame and for a cause be  proud And I came to work sad to see him so old  OAKLAND PIER 1918  I had a bench in the shadow back from the arc light Which burnt in the engine smoke like a coal and colored   H L Davis  The men s faces red so they seemed inflamed with excite  ment Sometimes all the engines would charge near me with a noise Which shook the orange stand there moved the piles of dark  red oranges  I was sleepy with the cold of the winter and the past mid  night Half asleep I heard the water of the bay and a man s voice I remember in China when this army was there Eighteen years ago a Captain Abel was worse He did not die either but went home as you are going  And the young soldier What did I say kill  The sergeant seemed not to hear him talked on as an old man will On some subject he has thought about I was no recruit  then I have soldiered for twenty nine years in every country That is longer than you are old You ll go home and be like That man with the oranges Marry buy land do well And I say nothing but do not tell me of soldiering Talk of hog killing farmer I am old now And still quicker than your people  Yes you are a sergeant You have better treatment It is all officers with you You have soldiered twenty nine years they consider you  more   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  What do you know of my people They are quick too What is this to talk about now You are too old And I shall be home in two days as good as any officer  As the men were silent I heard the gulls following a ferryboat Or flying in the dark somewhere and when they ceased cry  ing and turned Back into the bay their wings sounded like leaves Blowing from poplar trees down a road  I thought Only gulls There are the engines the red faced men this is Oakland  Pier I am tired now shall I ever be sorry of the quietness Of the roads in light snow the thin grass covered and cold  TH E OLD ARE SLEEPY  A slow spring between two wheat fields High on the hill In the straight weeds the men walk sizing the wheat Sweating through dry soft ground where wild sunflowers are The wind blows dust in the faces of these old men And dust is all over their faces as they ride down As they ride toward the poplars about the distant house  Do I not know They will watch the green willows between These very fields rest a day or two mend roads Against the harvesting of this high grain and sleep   H L Davis  The old men have seen it and are content with it Content among the women and all content Women who lie uneasy at night against them  I know of this and of the mouth of music which said A small spring between the wheat fields I know the low  hair And the beauty in which music is as slow rain Is in the willows when they dip over like hands I know her of whom you are proud that before their sleep They also behold her proudly a distant spring s beauty  Is this the distant spring s beauty For in the rain It shall all be changed and the willows about it be darkened The old men have put the hills in foal yet past Sundown and until the morning the headed wheat Finds me and I feel her mouth and low hair Cry for their pride in her when you lie by them at night  FLAGS  In the wind the flags which here are called irises Snap and blow ragged all along the street They are of three colors yellow and white and blue At this I am pleased as a man who sees strange ships For the reason that in the country I recall We had not heard of any but white flags   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  There the white flags grew in a damp level place Where jonquils were and daffodils and lilacs And small cool roses and hands of locust blossoms And heavy headed peonies and a red flower The women called red hot poker loud as a bull rag These flowers growing together in tall strong grass  Sometimes the swallows flying sometimes rain Came over the tall grass and the small red rose  Its flowers as yet watched for shed off the dust Sometimes it was windy and the flags blew out Or hot and the jonquils under the lilac bush  Built out in beauty like a clear warm river  My pleasant thoughts build in colors and graceful shadows For this flower garden flags the color of far waters White locust flowers in the rain young flowers in the grass Play up a tune sing loud and handsome O soul The garden abides it is not like love nor the song Where some lost girl brings honey in the horn  THE VALLEY HARVEST  Honey in the horn I brought my horse from the water  And from the white grove of tall alders over the spring  And brought him past a row of high hollyhocks  Which flew and tore their flowers thin as his mane   H L Davis  And women there watched with hair blown over their mouths Yet in watching the oat field they were quiet as the spring  Are the hollyhocks full bloomed It is harvest then The hay falls like sand falling in a high wind When the weeds blow and fly but steady the sand falls It is harvest harvest and honey in the horn I would like to go out in a few days through the stubble  field And to all the springs yours too we have known for years And to the bearing vines and clean the berries from them  Call women why do you stand if not for your pride s sake  But the women would neither call to me nor speak Nor to any man not mowing during their harvest They watched with their hair blowing near the stalks In the row of red hollyhocks  Quiet as the spring What is by the spring A bird and a few old leaves  H L Davis   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  THE WORLD S DESIRE  At Philae in the temple of Isis The fruitful and terrible goddess Under a running panel of the sacred ibis Is pictured the dead body of Osiris Waiting the resurrection morn And a priest is pouring water blue as iris Out of a pitcher on the stalk of corn That from the body of the god is growing Before the rising tides of the Nile are flowing And over the pictured body is this inscription In the temple of Isis the Egyptian  This is the nameless one whom Isis decrees Not to be named the god of life and yearning Osiris of the mysteries Who springs from the waters ever returning  At the gate of the Lord s house Ezekiel the prophet beheld the abomination of Babylon Women with sorrow on their brows In lamentation weeping For the bereavement of Ishtar and for Tammuz sleeping And for the summer gone Tammuz has passed below To the house of darkness and woe Where dust lies on the bolt and on the floor Behind the winter s iron door And Ishtar has followed him   Edgar Lee Masters  Leaving the meadows gray the orchards dim With driving rain and mist And winds that mourn Ishtar has vanished and all life has ceased No flower blossoms and no child is born  But not as Mary Magdalen came to the tomb The women in the gardens of Adonis Crying The winter sun is yet upon us Planted in baskets seeds of various bloom Which sprouted like frail hopes then wilted down For the baskets shallow soil Then for a beauty dead a futile toil For leaves that withered yellow and brown From the gardens of Adonis into the sea They cast the baskets of their hope away A ritual of the things that cease to be Brief loveliness and swift decay  And O ye holy women there at Delphi Rousing from sleep the cradled Dionysus Who with an April eye Looked up at them Before the adorable god the infant Jesus Was found at Bethlehem  For at Bethlehem the groaning world s desire For spring that burned from Egypt up to Tyre And from Tyre to Athens beheld an epiphany of fire   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  The flesh fade flower like while the soul kept breath Beyond the body s death Even as nature which revives In consummation of the faith That Tammuz the Soul survives And is not sacrificed In the darkness where the dust Lies on the bolt and on the floor And passes not behind the iron door Save it be followed by the lover Christ The Ishtar of the faithful trust Who knocks and says This soul which winter knew In life in death at last Finds spring through me and waters fresh and blue For lo the winter is past The rain is over and gone I open It is dawn  Edgar Lee Masters   TO A DEAD MOUSE IN A TRAP  We are born short of sight but some of us Some who are human grow to presbyopes And set lack lustre eyes on distant stars And infinite impersonals the children Who worship gilt and sugar break their gods  Breaking their hearts with every bitter blow And pin their faith to others till at last Finding this life a plated thing they turn To Heaven to a listless second choice  Happy the scattered joyous polytheists Who loving God and gossip prayers and gold Float smoothly here and yonder like the bee Who finding that bloom dry falls into this one And failing of such versatility I have been tempted now and then to call Happy a young lieutenant I have known Who held both arms out to the Long desired And clasped the bloody earth with those two arms  Yes as I drop you on the garbage heap Tiny crushed glutton I half envy you  Roy Temple House   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  PROUD NEW YORK  Fragment from a long poem America 1918  By proud New York and its man piled Matterhorns The hard blue sky overhead and the west wind blowing Steam plumes waving from sun glittering pinnacles And deep streets shaking to the million river  Manhattan zoned with ships the cruel Youngest of all the world s great towns Thy bodice bright with many a jewel Imperially crowned with crowns   Who that has known thee but shall burn  In exile till he come again To do thy bitter will O stern Moon of the tides of men  John Reed   FIFTH AVENUE SKY SCRAPERS  We are the phantoms of mortar and brick Slapped against patches of sky Stretching our taut slender bodies Into the clouds  Under us endless masses of people endlessly walking Somewhere nowhere Endlessly swallowed by us Who house them feed them clothe them Followed by masses of others endlessly walking  We do not walk We have mounted the pace of men s minds that have made  us Made us the thing that we are The sphinx of a world that is new yet blind as the old  They do not see us the sphinx The soul of themselves  For they are aimlessly walking Anywhere nowhere Walking to deaden the hour Walking toward life Walking toward death  Somewhere    POETRY A Magazine of Verse  VAGABONDS  I  When you flashed Like the sudden sun On my blinking eyes Frightened little words Scampered to my throat And tumbled from my lips Strange vagabonds  II  They envy me When they call him mine My soul envies My lips and my arms  m  You kissed me once But if you kiss me again Because you kissed me once I will kill you  Alice D Lippman   THE GIFT OF DEATH  I cannot lose you dear let come what may For you are with me as a melody And have been through the ages I can see No time in all times that within me stay When you were not the worth of every day The names I called you by have passed from me The forms I loved you in perhaps will be Again sweet woman forms of loveliest clay And then perhaps you may be as a breath Of rosy flame along the narrowing west  For even now in all that I love best  Your name starts as a music and the hue  Of beauty trembles through me Dear in death  I ll find not immortality but you  Roger L Sergei   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  EPISODES  THE THING  I see it in the sorry gleam That lights the far and forlorn dream It s in the glorious sacrifice Made for the wry inglorious prize It s there to see I cannot choose When men take honor to the Jews And in the satyr s hoofs that rave Down the still cathedral nave In slender lips that twist and sing And curved eyes quick with revelling And every gesture of delight Caught in the blue mirage of night  It will I seize and hold some day But for it I must throw away And for it I must leave behind   By God I wish that I were blind  EPITAPH ON A MADMAN S GRAVE  The time had come to kill himself he said Because at night he couldn t run and dive Into a pool of sleep heels over head The way he used to do when he was five   Morris Gilbert  WHY HE CORNERED THE MARKET  There was a candy shop in Samarcand And all the other kids would come and stand Outside the window noses in a row Pressed white against the glass to see him go And stretch up to the counter while he chose A copper s worth of these and two of those  DISILLUSION  You came and stood there in the failing light A sorceress who told her mysteries At that there grew behind my eyes a sight More beautiful than any woman is  And to my blood a lifting joy came in And warmed me as of old I flashed to try Swiftly what that swift thing might be and then I saw that there was only you and I  In that small room whose fire was almost dead Of course there were the chairs a book or so And tea set out I got my hat and said That it was really time for me to go  Morris Gilbert   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  OLD FOLK SONGS OF UKRAINA  THE RETURN OF DREBENUCHA  Oi to war rode Drebenucha with the nobles to battle In the castle left he Katerina its whole charge in her keeping  Then rose up his old mother tore her hair wrote a letter Thy great palace of brick is all ruined all ruined thy stables  Thy bay horses are loose and they wander thy goats they are scattered Thy wine cellars lie now all open thy proud household s in riot  Then the youthful Drebenucha tore his hair in his trouble Saddled he his bay horse quickly and homeward he galloped  Oi came then Drebenucha to his strong lordly castle Came to meet him Katerina fair lovely as ever  But the young man Drebenucha paid no heed to her beauty Swift he drew out his sharp broadsword her fair head fell riven  His walled castle was not ruined twas as stately as ever His brick stables were not fallen they were better were stronger   Florence Randal Livesay  In the stables his horses his goats in the courtyard His proud household was still haughty no disgrace had befallen  And his old mother seated was holding his youngest Drebenitko his baby in her arms he was lying  If I feared not my mother God s wrath from His heaven I would draw my sharp broadsword thy head should be severed  Oi then rode Drebenucha all up a steep mountain And he slew first his good steed then fell on his broadsword  O thou flinty mountain thou hast taken my father Katerina is dead take the young Drebenucha  SONG OF THE DROWNING COSSACK  Go my horse along the road through the new gates And my old mother will come out to meet you But tell her not little steed that I was drowned Tell her my little horse that I have married Oi my friends at the wedding are maples drooping over  water My marriage brokers are carpenters in the water My groomsmen are of the drift wood My kinsmen are the pike in the river And my bride the still waters   MARUSENKA S WEDDING  The little Marusenka for water to the stone well has gone Ere she stooped for the water strange sounds in the dis  tance She drops her pails smites her little hands And to her home hastens  Oi my father dear soul The great raid is coming They will fight they will rob us They will take me with them The little one the young one Like a red cherry  Marusenka daughter mine Hide thyself in thy chamber Among the fair maidens  And there they will know me By my head by my hair By my light colored tresses The other girls braids Are wreathed all with rue But mine are unplaited And with periwinkle crowned   Florence Randal Livesay  PARTING  I shall die my love I shall surely die Then make for me my love a coffin of cedar  cannot make thee sweet one a coffin of cedar Thou must lie Mila O my dear in one made of fir  Bury me dear one in a grave deep in the cherry orchard Plant by my head a little creeping berry  And when the one who parts us takes thee by the arm As thou walkest through the cherry orchard The one who parts us walking with thee Thou shalt summon me from my grave  Oi arise my dear rise up look around See thy cattle wandering through the wide world  Oh let them go and if ever they assemble again They shall nevermore see the mistress they knew  Oi arise my love arise look round about Thy children already are scattered and gone to work  Oh let them go and if ever again they meet Their mother indeed and indeed they shall never see  Oi arise my love my Milasenka arise For thee thy youngest child cries for thee she weeps   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Oh let her cry she will soon cease Whosoever once dies does not rise from the grave  Oi arise my love my Chornobriva arise Lo the flower I planted has bloomed at thy head  Oh let it bloom let it bloom let it bloom in full flower Whosoever once dies lo she rests in the grave  TH E BATTLEFIELD  Black oh black was once the plowing hai hai The black plowland they re re plowing And the sowing is of bullets Harrowed by the white white body hai hai Washed with blood now is the plowing  On a hillock lies a warrior hai hai Lies the warrior on a hillock Red kitaika on his eyelids Red how red A silken kerchief hai hai Blinds his eyes the red kitaika  Here s no coffin here s no grave hole hai hai Here s no coffin here s no grave dug Here s no father and no mother No one to set bells a tolling hai hai Ne er a one to ring the death knell   Florence Randal Livesay  Only hoofs of horses ringing hai hai Only hoofs of horses ringing With the jingling spurs of comrades Only horse s hoof a ringing hai hai Only jingling spur of comrade  From a strange land swift a crow flies hai hai From a strange land swift a crow flies On the grave hill it is sitting Drinking of dead eyes it sits there hai hai Of the dead eyes it is drinking  And a mother walks and calls there hai hai Calling crying roams the mother For her dead son ever looking Oi I know thy son thy dear son hai hai For on him I have been feasting  Wilt thou tell me of thy kindness hai hai Little crow I pray thee tell me If my dear son be yet living Are his eyes as gray as ever hai hai Are his lips red as kalina  Blue and cold now are his red lips hai hai Blue already are the red lips Black with death his hair is lying On his face I have been perching hai hai And his eyes I have been drinking  Translated by Florence Randal Livesay  COMMENT  TH E GLITTERING METROPOLIS  EW YORK in this season of extraordinary grace dazzles one s imagination like a futurist picture dancing skyscrapers shooting automobiles theorizing poets trotting Pekinese dogs peering windowfuls of spring hats all these criss cross in lines of black crimson and silver across a sky of blue and gold Motion perpetual motion prisms all aflare the riches of the earth and the glory thereof heaped up in formidable towers long prancing avenues declaiming to heaven is there any other place on earth so loud and proud Powerful doubt it and you are beaten over the head Magnificent what ghost from Rome or Babylon or jewel encrusted Moscow of the Tzars shall challenge this stuffed and grandiose autocrat of all the rushers  It was a study in contrasts on Saturday the birthday of George Washington to go in the morning to the Lowell Centenary and in the evening to Alfred Kreymborg s party of the poets of Others and others It was a dramatization of the stately past and the impertinent future the former solemn oratorical affirmative richly set forth at the Ritz Carlton the latter merry quizzical argumentative challenging the world from a sky parlor studio in the region whither the Village has adjourned  The Lowell party may have lacked fire but it was the ultimate of dignity The semi circle of sages on the platform needed only the robes of office to look as omniscient as the   The Glittering Metropolis  Supreme Court of the United States and there was no questioning the eulogies of the day s hero which one by one they came down stage to deliver They did their best for the suave and brilliant Lowell Lowell the professor diplomat man of the world wit essayist orator even poet Prof William Milligan Sloane of Columbia led the procession by bowing gracefully before him Prof Barrett Wendell carried his best Harvard accent for a solid hour in a loyal effort to prove him an immortal That popular gentleman of letters Prof Stephen Butler Leacock of Toronto delivered Canada s cheerful tribute and the ever lyric Alfred Noyes tunefully representing England digressed from the subject to celebrate the entente cordiale in a ballad of flags along Fifth Avenue Edgar Lee Masters was the only orator who emphasized the prevailing harmony by even the slightest discord for his smooth quatrains of rhymed eloquence led up to Whitman s name instead of Lowell s and called upon the assembled frock coated wise men to set about abolishing poverty And at last that modern Addisonian Samuel Mc Chord Crothers rounded up the Centenary by striking the final major chord Lowell he said represented that later stage of American idealism when the idealist was withdrawing from rougher contacts The Cathedral embodied his conception of America and the Commemoration Ode was his noblest utterance  And so the great occasion was over and we proceeded to size up its hero more informally at luncheon theorizing as to whether a noblest utterance may also be a poem and   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  whether bard philosopher or even mere unillumined man may withdraw from rougher contacts and yet save his soul and sing his song One or two iconoclasts thought the poet in Lowell was defeated by professional blandnesses and ambassadorial elegancies Another thought that there wasn t much poet in Lowell that the aforesaid blandnesses and elegancies were his proper fare A few referred to time s revenges à propos of Lowell s obliteration of Poe And quite a number wondered whether Walt Whitman s Manahatta having paid her tribute to the Bostonian would also devote two or three days to honoring the greater bard s now so imminent centenary  Yes this grave and reverend assemblage was a sharp contrast to the Others party One stepped suddenly from the nineteenth century into the post war twentieth and from a tufted Victorian drawing room into a bare but hospitable futuristic attic If the former was comfortable and soothing the latter was stimulating even irritating The day s illustrious centenarian was not mentioned but Tom Dick and Harry of the muse s new era were knocked about from pillar to post of bantering praise or blame  Dr Carlos Williams argued for fluidity of technique an ever changeful and episodic rhythm as the only possible expression of an age of cataclysmic change How absurd is a fixed poetic method he insisted when all the world is dashing to pieces around us We can t finish a poem in the mood we began it with every sentence every choicest phrase is imperiled by the eruption The poet should yield like a river   The Glittering Metropolis  to changing banks rocks precipices should yield swiftly easily in mid sentence if need be taking gladly the new form the new motion Poetry must be a series of continually shifting experiments a thing of changing contours dancing lights fluid rhythms if it is to be true to this age of perpetual motion in which we live  And Emanuel Carnevali took up the challenge asserted the muse s humanism Poetry was not a thing of changing surfaces its currents ran deeper The perpetual shift and sparkle of changing moods fluid technique were not poetry any more than reflected lights and floating driftwood were the river Poetry was the heart of the race moving in mass rather than in ripples carrying lightly its reflections experiments essentially changeless in spite of the great variety of forms from calm pools to torrential cataracts in which it might express itself  And so on with much and varied opinionating for various opinions were there Lola Ridge on the eve of departure for her readings in Chicago came in with a tiny plant and a pretty story some anonymous reader had sent the plant also a note containing fifty dollars to her door as an expression of gratitude for her poems Why are not such incidents common I reflected Why do not more readers thus bestow a golden laurel leaf upon some poet whom they admire Alfred Kreymborg and his bride did the honors with the aid of Michael and Daphne Carr whose studio received us And William and Marguerite Zorach close partners in poetry as in painting brought a suggestion of brown Russian   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  plains And Muna Lee her dark eyes shining threw a round word into the discussion now and then And Edna St Vincent Millay her little head like a flaming lily on a slender stalk flitted lightly in and out of it Florence Mastín was there and Louis Grudin and Babette Deutsch and Padraic Colum and the cryptic Marianne Moore who seemed less cryptic than her poetry And others  Another contrast but that came the next week was a meeting of the Poetry Society of America at which according to numerous informants it happened that the worst poems of the year were read including a Salome narrative by Lewis Worthington Smith as quaintly and pompously old fashioned as the pin back over skirts of the seventies The usual diversion of selecting by vote the two best poems of the evening starred two of a quality which served to emphasize this editor s protest against making such child splay the basis of the society s annual award of prizes  Poetry is a shy episode in proud New York indeed in all the resounding modern towns What else may be mentioned chiefly a memorable talk with Wallace Stevens as he passed through from Hartford to somewhere further west When informed of many inquiries as to when his first book would appear this reticent poet said he was not interested so his admirers may be warned that there is little hope And plays A pretty one acter by Mary Carolyn Davies was poorly given by the Drama Forum after an interminable harangue in broken English by an irrepressible lady from Denmark Dear Brutus with Gillette in it was charm   The Glittering Metropolis  ingly Barriesque Redemption the much over praised seemed to me poor Tolstoy poorly acted with preternatural solemnity by Jack Barrymore Maeterlinck s Betrothal was sweetly pretty yes sickly sweet a long way downward from Pelléas and Mélisande or even from the whimsical Bluebird Walter Hampden s once a week Hamlet I did not see  The one memorable even glorious theatrical experience of a too brief New York visit was the Stuart Walker company s presentation of The Book of Job I had feared to risk so prodigious a venture but the reward was magnificent beyond words Never a slip never a false note marred the sublime simplicity of the greatest drama ever written and the Job of George Gaul was a triumph of the loftiest dramatic art Strange that it should require an actual stage presentation to remind us that Job is not a narrative poem but a drama its highly colored dialogue embodying action as intense as a charge from trench to trench action of the spirit expressed in flaming words of beauty And it is an example of perfect structure Job and his three friends all grandly drawn and individualized their dialogue leading to that haughty utterance The words of Job are ended which falls like the tolling of a great bell then the interlude protest of the Young Man immortal youth against self revering age interrupted by the intolerably moving Voice in the Whirlwind that Voice so difficult for mere humanity to express and finally Job s humility beneath it  The restoration described by the two narrators in their   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  admirably statuesque niches to right and left was soothing and beautiful but its mood so much lighter than the main tragedy made one almost wish that the actors would follow the mandates of modern higher criticism which ascribes the final chapter of Job to a later and cheaper poet and thereby decrees its omission  From the ever shifting ever glittering kaleidoscope of the brilliant ultra modern metropolis these few patterns of many colored life are offered as a whispered hint a casual suggestion H M  THE UKRAINE AND ITS SONG  In looking upon the plight of the new old republic of Ukraina for centuries ago it was a republic always even when but a name it meant heart home to men who loved a good fight and freedom one thinks of the powerful lines of the national folk poet Shevchenko in the days of his serfdom addressed to the Ukraine  No father to his son shall say  Kneel down and fold your hands and pray  He died for our Ukraina  I care no longer if the child  Shall pray for me or pass me by  One only thing I cannot bear  To know my land that was beguiled  Into a death trap with a lie  Trampled and ruined and defiled  Ah but I care dear God I care  His death trap refers to a treaty made with Muscovy Many have thought that the Ukraine betrayed her allies in 1917 but not those who have made the closest study of her   The Ukraine and Its Song  problem her situation and history She had no love for Russia which had banned her own tongue and oppressed her own people she owed no allegiance to Austria which yet held within her confines the Ruthenians the Hutzuls of the Carpathians the Bukovinians and Galicians In her dream the giant enslaved was to drop his shackles and the world was to know the Ukraina of song and story as an entity and not as a forgotten kingdom  It is hard to discuss what Kolessa calls the national Bible or store house of folk song without stopping for many explanations for until recently the Ukraine was only a name written on the hearts of thirty five millions of people the French literateurs being about the only ones interested in her artistic expression if we except clever German and Austrian propagandists What blood is to the body their language is to the Southern or Little Russian the Bukovinian Hutzul the Ruthenian of Galicia What will prevent the Ruthenian of the Dniester from speaking the same language as his brother of the Dnieper asked Kolessa in 1905  One may not plow the depths of the sea One cannot bind the live spirit of the living word How proud should the Ukrainian race not be of this rich treasure of song he cries Bodenstedt who translated the Ruthenian folk songs into German calls its medium the most melodious of all Slav languages And the Serbian Lukshich says It approaches Great Russian the most nearly but is easily understood by all other Slavs It is recognized as the most harmonious and most easily learned of these it is specially well adapted to music and song The melody   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  is an inseparable part If among a thousand airs a Ruthenian can recognize his own it contains something that others have not These folk melodies were known centuries back long before the present Western European music was composed Kolessa says also that it differs from Eastern European song both in structure and rhythm that many of the songs had their origin in those of ancient Greece The writer of The Expedition of Ihor compares a battle ground to the plowed field of death the Ukrainian heroes to the marriage brokers at a wedding feast drinking the wine of blood And in another old song a drowning Cossack addresses his horse in nationally characteristic fashion  It was in the eighteenth century that a learned Englishman Macpherson called the attention of his own people to the fascination and educational possibilities of their folksong After him came the German Herder and then the Slavs In the first half of the nineteenth century large collections of Serbian folk songs appeared then Bohemian later the Ukrainian In 1819 Prince Sertelew published a collection of Ukrainian historical songs and poems and he was followed by many now well known collectors such as Dra homanov Lysenko Kolessa and Franko The Ukrainians possess the greatest volume of folk literature next to the Serbians  Perhaps readers of POETRY may be especially interested in an odd and more modern form of Ukrainian folk song The Kolomeyka These bits of impromptu verse mostly consist of themes dealing with love or family customs They differ   The Ukraine and Its Sons  from others in their shorter form in fourteen syllable couplets they embody a complete thought This is the latest born of the Ukrainian folk songs and is about the only branch of the national literature still in process of creation enriched by every generation In Galicia it has become a very popular form slowly crowding out others In one village Dr Ivan Kolessa noted down more than two thousand Kolomeyki In these are embraced the bright and dark sides of life from the most foolish trifles to the most important events A large proportion are conceived in comic vein  Oh no more I ll stay unwedded weary of my life Oi I have a silver coin I will take a wife There is a certain technique an art which is very satisfying in some of the best of the Kolomeyki The first line gives a picture of nature the second portrays the state of the  individual soul Oi the blooming deep blue blossoms so blue they all blue they There is no one I am loving save that Vasylenko  There is a close analogy between these two lines As the Vasiliki bloom blue so in her heart grows the love for her sweetheart The sweet basil is here chosen it is often planted by a maiden to ensure a lover s coming  As the Cuckoo mournfully calls at the cross roads so the maiden yearns for her lost lover Oi Zazula it was cooing where the cross roads met  Me thou hast forgot my lover thee I cannot forget  And to give other examples  Oi I may not shut the gates that bar the grove so high Him I loved well him I m loving till the day I die   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  By the mill there stands an ash tree mill turned by the wind You ve clung to me my own dear one around my heart you ve  twined  By the mill there grows an ash tree the maple bows t will break If I can t have the one I love now no other love I ll take The Maple bending down is a symbol of a Cossack suffering or dying In some more ambitious verses a close parallel and antithe  sis is carried out  Every green leaf from tree falling rots lo it is gone  Every young unfaithful lover when he falls lives on  First and foremost the Kolomeyka is a dance song In it the dancer after each turn sings a couplet in some parts of Galicia and Bukovina youths and sometimes women also sing the couplets in the swift reversals of the dance and in most cases these are composed on the spur of the moment It should be remarked that the Lowland Kolomeyka is more lively and boisterous than in the Carpathians where it is monotonous and slow In some countries it is not sung unless the dance is in progress while in others the people sing it in the fields and pastures  Maidens and shepherds are the chief composers of the songs Corydon and Phyllis singing their catches and roundelays When a youth is jealous the blizzardy refrain will serve his turn  Go not where I m bound for now a wooing my sweet maid  Else in cedar coffin thou surely shalt be laid  Florence Randal Livesay   REVIEWS  POETRY OF THE NORTH AMERICAN INDIAN  The Path on the Rainbow An Anthology of Songs and  Chants from the Indians of North America Edited by  George W Cronyn with Introduction by Mary Austin  Boni and Liveright  The publication of this book is an event since here for the first time the subject of Indian poetry is presented to us squarely on its own merits Before this if one wanted to know anything of Indian verse one had to search through the scientific and often non literary treatises in the publications of the Bureau of Ethnology or be content with the sort of intermittent treatment of the subject found in books devoted to a more general consideration of Indian life But in this book Indian poetry is presented to us as an art rather than as an ethnological curiosity This does not mean of course that the ethnologists have not performed a very great service in preserving these authentic Indian poems for us but only that their point of view is not that of the artist or poet and that it has remained and still remains for the artist and poet to interpret adequately many phases of Indian expression The way in which this book has eventually crystallized so to speak is in itself indicative of a growing perception on our part of the literary and artistic value of Indian motives Many minds working separately almost in the dark as it were and along individual paths have here come together to present what is a genuine contribution to contemporary literature   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  And contemporary the book is in every sense of the word Not only is the American Indian a contemporary of ours a fact too often lost sight of through the use of such terms as the vanishing race or that other colorless and far distantsounding word aboriginal but his poetry is very much of our time Whether it is the spirit of the land reacting upon our poets to make them like the earliest owners of the soil and sky or whether it is due to some other cause certain it is that these Indian poems are very similar in spirit and method to the poetry of our most modern American poets Stephen Crane would have qualified as an Indian poet and in the Mid American Chants of Sherwood Anderson one finds almost precisely the mood of the songs accompanying the green corn dances of the pueblo Indians  Another thing that gives the book its amazing freshness and contemporary feeling is the fact that many of the translators have not been literary in the pseudo sense and have not attempted to gloss the poems with poetic phrasing invariably trite The result often enough is far more effective for just this reason Paradoxically the ethnologist who usually is not interested in the literary quality of the Indian s mind as such has because of the very literalness of his reaction preserved the spirit of the original as one less disinterested in this respect could hardly have done The translations of the Chippewa songs by Miss Frances Densmore for instance are notably excellent and Miss Densmore as a musician primarily interested in the music was content to set down the bare image given her by   Poetry of the North American Indian  the Indian The result is authentic to a degree not often achieved Also Dr Washington Matthews renditions of the Navajo Mountain Chant impress us with the same feeling of essential authenticity and one could mention the work of other translators in which the same faculty of direct transcription is evident  One chief danger of translation of course is the tendency to Europeanize the original and against this the translator must be continuously on guard Another danger as noted above is in the form given to the fluid content furnished by the Indian When an Indian song is translated to read like an Elizabethan poem or Spenserian stanza one instinctively feels that the essence of the original has somehow escaped or been smothered by the translator Of course all translation is interpretive to a certain extent and it is only with the most scrupulous care that the translator can keep from imposing upon the song some shade of meaning not inherent in the original Again translation to be vital must be abreast of the best contemporary expression and translations which include the many awkward inversions and trite poetic phaseology of pseudo poetic expression of which the Indian himself is not guilty fall notably short in this respect The great advantage afforded by this volume and this has never been furnished before is the opportunity to compare the respective merits of the translators as well as the originals and to determine for oneself just how far each has succeeded in capturing the essence of Indian thought and inspiration  Fortunately for one s further illumination in this direction Mrs Austin s introduction to the book is in itself a   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  contribution as important as the contents One might have despaired of wishing for anything so adequately understanding of so much in Indian poetry that seemingly defies analysis but the secret of Mrs Austin s success is that she approaches the subject with the sensitive feeling of the poet combined with the lack of preconceived bias characteristic of the best scientific thought Fortunately too she is not sentimental about the Indian This is another danger which seems to assail the interpreter of Indian art It is perhaps a natural reaction to the other extreme in this country the attitude of the vast majority of our middle class barbarians including Indian agents Indian commissioners and the like who regard the Indian as a savage without culture and his art a curiosity at best and unrefined and uncivilized at worst to be suppressed at all hazard It is indeed hard for one who knows anything at all of the Indian s inside thought to speak without heat on this subject or escape the stigma of sentimentality in regard to the Indian When one meets Comstock in the desert the inclination to exalt the Indian by contrast is irresistible Mrs Austin s work however is characterized by moderation as well as discrimination and she claims for the Indian only what he is The key note of her point of view may be found in a phrase from another article in which she says There is no such thing as primitive mind there is only mind in a state of primitive limitation I don t know just what state of limitation the mind of our Comstockian Indian officials may be in but it is certainly not sufficiently innocent or beautiful to be called primitive   If I have touched only upon the outskirts of this book and given nothing of the heart of it of the Indian poems themselves it is only that from a mass so rich it is impossible to quote with any satisfaction A review which would do justice to the subject would be a thesis in itself Indian poetry has never reached an artificial stage and when one says this one realizes something of the pristine freshness of this great fund of material Mr Cronyn has grouped his poems by regional divisions and this is exceedingly wise for the poems of the woodlands differ from the poems of the desert the first are more lyrical the latter more rhapsodic Again the Plains Indians and the Indians of the Northwest coast have a touch of keen humor and satire and incisive philosophy The Indians of the Southeast the Cherokees have many magic formulae recalling the voodoo of the southern Negroes Perhaps these tendencies may be significant Of the poetry in general one may say that it is of a very high order exhibiting many varieties of inspiration often symbolic to a high degree but always vital and always human Cut deeply into any Indian poem Mrs Austin says and it yields that profound and palpitant humanism without which no literary art can endure  The appreciative interpretation of the poetry of another race is largely one must believe a gift The whole art character of the Indian is of course more Oriental than European Perhaps that is why we have so long failed to appreciate it It is possible that Indian poetry may be more closely allied to Chinese poetry than to that of any other   race it has the same realism the same concrete simplicity and acceptance of the commonplace experience as well as the exceptional as the material of poetry There are also many points of similarity with Japanese verse in spirit no less than in the brevity of many songs And Mrs Austin points out the pure Greek mode of a poem from the tribe of Tenasa on the shore of the Missi sippu So the American Indian stands revealed as a poet of no mean order  One thing is sure whatever else may be accomplished by this book we must discard our nursery period Fenimore Cooper Hiawatha cigar store Indian impression of the Indian He is not a bit like our naïve conception of him He is much more interesting and his personality more richly varied As for his art one gets some inkling of it in this book but not the whole story His theatrical art of which many of these songs are a component part is the finest thing we have in this country without exception the most consummate primal art And our government can think of nothing better to do than to try to suppress it But for those who know this art in its fulness with all its rich color and poetry and amazing symbolism this book is correspondingly richer  As an epilogue to the poems Miss Constance Lindsay Skinner furnishes a brief essay on The Indian as Poet of which the most outstanding feature is her picture of an old Indian  The Indian water song is poetry to me because of a memory an old chief his hair grayed and his broad brown face deepened by a hundred and ten years his sightless eyes almost hidden under   Poetry of the North American Indian  sagging crinkled lids raised to the wet air He sat in his doorway a low oval entrance in the trunk of his totem pole which towered with its grotesque carvings of finny and winged beasts thirty feet into the fine misty rain that dropped silent and opaque on the earthen cliff the sightless sea and the blind eyelids of the old chief He seemed to have been sitting there since the day when the first rain fell and the gray sea first flapped her wings on the shore as her weird brood fluttered from under them to roost on the totem pole  In addition to the direct translations composing the body of the book Mr Cronyn has included a section of interpretations by Constance Lindsay Skinner Mary Austin Frank Gordon Alice Corbin and Pauline Johnson One wishes that he had included also the Cherokee poems of John Gould Fletcher The translators include such well known names as Natalie Curtis Alice Fletcher Franz Boaz Washington Matthews John Peabody Harrington Jeremiah Curtin and many others And greatest of all of course are the unnamed Indian poets whose work speaks for them in these pages  Incidentally it is a matter of some pride to the editors of POETRY that the immediate inspiration for the volume came as Mr Cronyn says in his preface from the Indian number of the magazine published February 1917  A C H  JEAN UNTERMEYER S BOOK  Growing Pains by Jean Starr Untermeyer B W Huebsch  What the reviewers delight to call the New Poetic Renaissance is barely six years old and already it contains not only matter for reflection but food for melancholy Ap   parently a number of young and enthusiastic souls have believed themselves capable of doing something striking now that the old restrictions of metrical verse have been removed But alas it takes more than the mere abolishing of this or that standard to make a poet and the man who would never have had the force nor the industry nor the originality to write interesting poetry in quatrains is just as uninteresting as unoriginal and as lazy in vers libre The only difference is that we are not quite so sick of the modern conventions as we were of the old ones yet For unfortunately our movement young as it is has already developed conventions In taking up most of these new volumes one can  see at a glance into which of the usual modern categories they fall And after all it is largely as echoes of this or that leader that they achieve even a measure of success Perhaps we are unreasonable to expect more really remarkable poets to be alive at one time for we are far enough on the road now to realize that the movement to rate it no higher has done pretty well But those of us who are concerned with poetry are always on the lookout for more We read poem after poem and book after book starting each with high expectations which are seldom fulfilled Tastes differ naturally but for me I must confess that only twice lately have I felt like flying a flag over a book by a practically unknown author and shouting to the populace that here is a valuable thing and a poet to be most thankful for The first of these books was Profiles from China by Eunice Tietjens the second is Growing Pains by Jean Starr   Jean Untermeyer s Book  Untermeyer No two people could be more unlike in themselves or their work than Mrs Tietjens and Mrs Untermeyer but the point is that each is indubitably herself It is not that they dare express themselves because everybody so dares to day it has become a very easy thing to do it is that they each have something very special to express Which is merely to say that they are poets not only because they have the faculty of expression but because they have personalities which are peculiar and interesting When one is young and learning how to fit words together one thinks that it is the way one writes it that makes a poem when one is old or at least elderly and words leap to one s bidding one learns that it is really what one is that does the business It is not so difficult to learn how to write if one cares for it  which implies a measure of taste and will work hard but there is the Biblical remark about adding a cubit to one s stature and the cubit is quite as refractory when it comes to mental altitude  Jean Starr Untermeyer is a poet by the grace of God Which is not to imply that her poetry is not as happily contrived as good poetry always must be but that the poetry behind the putting of it down is of the finest  This is an exceedingly modest volume of only sixty four pages which means that there is no padding As a matter of fact there are only thirty four poems in the book and they are all very nearly on a level The first poem which gives the book its title is the key note to the whole  From the bloodless battle From wrestling with memories those athletic ghosts   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  From an aching reach for Beauty  Speech has burst forth  Not for Art s sake  But to rid me of an ancient sorrow  Not mine alone and yet so wholly mine  I have left no songs for an idle lute  No pretty tunes of coddled ills  But the bare chart of my growing pains  All of Mrs Untermeyer s work springs from an aching reach for beauty and most certainly there are no pretty tunes but the bare chart is really a rare austerity of expression I think austere describes this verse better than any other word As I said some time ago the poems  are full of a strong and almost stern sentiment Here is no sentimentality but a great power of emotion The poet says  I would rather work in stubborn rock All the years of my life And make one strong thing And set it in a high clean place  It is a strong thing this poetry and all through the book the reader has the feeling of being himself set in a high clean place The subjects are simple love birth death misunderstandings poems to father mother and child This is subjective poetry and it does not reflect any wide knowledge of men or places such things are outside of the author s experience But the simple things are also the elemental things and once again is evidenced the odd truth that nothing is too old to be new if only there is a kink of personality behind the presentation She speaks of her love clothing her husband in a shining and terrible garment She looks at her life and determines to   Jean Untermeyer s Book  Cast aside my longing for romantic rôles And accept my destiny with a wry pride She rejects the luke warm poultices of praise These expressions have the simple completeness of originality Not seldom there is an ironic touch as in Clothes and sometimes in Church Sociable for instance the irony is touched with wistfulness But usually Mrs Untermeyer is too strong too passionate in either her joy or her sorrow for such half lights as wistfulness She is no lover of tinted attitudes and she scorns the queasy and careful of the world  Sometimes when I hear people mouth the word toleration  I am moved by a fury and a kind of pity too  Always she prefers the slow and rigorous pursuit of truth  I wish I had space to quote Autumn with its delightful catalogue of fruits and its vivid picture of the old yard and the catsup kettle bubbling in the middle of it Verhaeren s Flemish genre pictures are no better  As I have said these poems maintain a singularly high level extraordinarily so for a first book although perhaps the few objective pieces are not quite so fine as the others  Let us admit that this is an art of short range it is deep but not wide Possibly one cannot publish many volumes of so concentrated a texture But who wants many volumes Keats made his reputation with but three The point is that here we have a poetry of absolutely direct speech but direct speech so suffused and heightened that it attains a high distinction is poetry almost by accident the accident of sincere emotion and a keen and stark perception of beauty  Amy Lowell  POETRY A Magazine of Verse  CORRESPONDENCE  PEGASUS IMPOUNDED  Dear Madam Editor A Latinist must naturally be interested when a modern poet translates a Latin poet Hence my concern in Mr Pound s experiment with Propertius in POETRY for March I offer certain impressions  Mr Pound is often undignified or flippant which Propertius never is For example I shall have my dog s day I shall have doubtless a boom after my funeral There will be a crowd of young women doing homage to my palaver There is no hurry about it Such renderings pervert the flavor of a consciously artistic almost academic original And what if Mr Pound is aiming at the colloquial is the justification of his stilted Her hands have no kindness me ward  Mr Pound often drags because he pads Thus the second line is pure addition and pure delay in Though my house is not propped up by Taenarian columns From Laconia associated with Nepture and Cerberus  These three Baedekeresque explanations seem to have been gathered with a modicum of labor from Harper s Latin Lexicon under the word Taenarus  Mr Pound is incredibly ignorant of Latin He has of course a perfect right to be but not if he translates from it The result of his ignorance is that much of what he makes his author say is unintelligible I select a few out of about three score errors   Pegasus Impounded  In II of the translations Propertius makes Calliope bid him to refrain from writing epic poetry and to sing only of love Mr Pound mistakes the verb canes thou shalt sing for the noun canes in the nominative plural masculine and translates by dogs Looking around then for something to tack this to he fixes upon nocturnae genitive singular feminine and gives us night dogs I allow myself an exclamation point For sheer magnificence of blundering this is unsurpassable But other blunders are not without interest  Where Propertius speaks of the purple beaks punica rostra of the doves of Venus Mr Pound renders by the nonsensical phrase their Punic faces as if one were to translate crockery by China He confuses the two Latin words fugantes and fugientes and so represents the tutelary gods of Rome as fleeing from Hannibal instead of putting him to flight Where Propertius says I dreamed I lay on Helicon he makes him say I had been seen recumbent on Helicon Where Propertius says The Muses are my companions and my songs are dear to the reader Mr Pound translates Yet the companions of the Muses will keep their collective nose in my books Where Propertius says The trophies of kings borne in the bark of Aemilius the Roman conqueror Mr Pound makes him say Royal Aemilia drawn on the memorial raft Raft is the school boy stock translation of ratis a general word corresponding to our craft As for royal Aemilia had there ever been such a lady Propertius could not have   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  meant her since the two Latin words are in different cases These little differences have significance in an inflected language  Twice Mr Pound blunders over the word rigat moistens or sprinkles evidently connecting it with English rigid instead of with English irrigation Thus where Propertius says Calliope moistened my lips with water from the spring of Philetas a poet who influenced him Mr Pound gives us the monstrous rendering Stiffened our face with the backwash of Philetas In another passage Propertius says I have no artificial grottoes watered from the Marcian flow Marcius liquor The Marcian aqueduct was Rome s best water supply recently renovated by Agrippa Mr Pound seems to have taken liquor as spirituous He must then have thought of age as appropriate and so have interpreted Marcius as referring to the legendary King Ancus Marcius after which it was easy to add another legendary King Numa Pompilius The result is three lines all wrong and the last two pure padding Nor are my caverns stuffed stiff with a Marcian vintage  my cellar does not date from Numa Pompilius Nor bristle with wine jars Of one peculiarly unpleasant passage in Mr Pound s translation there is no suggestion in the original Mr Pound writes And in the meantime my songs will travel And the devirginated young ladies will enjoy them when they have got over the strangeness What Propertius says is Meanwhile let me resume the   Pegasus Impounded  wonted round of my singing let my lady touched by my words find pleasure in the familiar music That is all Gaudeat in solito tacta puella sono Just possibly though not probably Propertius meant young ladies rather than my lady But there is no hint of the decadent meaning which Mr Pound read into the passage by misunderstanding tacta and taking the preposition in as if it were a negativing part of an adjective insolito His own context should have shown him the absurdity of his version  If Mr Pound were a professor of Latin there would be nothing left for him but suicide I do not counsel this But I beg him to lay aside the mask of erudition And if he must deal with Latin I suggest that he paraphrase some accurate translation and then employ some respectable student of the language to save him from blunders which might still be possible If he does not owe this to himself he owes it to his author of whose fate otherwise one must think in Browning s words from Sordello as that of  Some captured creature in a pound Whose artless wonder quite precludes distress  Wm Gardner Hale  MR WALEY ON THE T AO CH IEN POEM  Dear Editor May I suggest two small emendations to Mrs Ayscough s interesting collection of Chinese poems in POETRY for February  First the last two lines of the T ao Ch ien poem mean   not  Does the Yellow Emperor regard these things  Because it is the fashion to do so  Among people of importance  but  It must not be left to Superior People to prize it  For it was valued by our Yellow Emperor  The Superior
