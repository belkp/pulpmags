dead Ended license lust and play Why do you iron the night away Your big clock speaks with a deadly sound  With a tick and a wail till dawn comes round While the monster shadows glower and creep What can be better for man than sleep  I will tell you a secret Chang replied My breast with vision is satisfied And I see green trees and fluttering wings And my deathless bird from Shanghai sings   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Then he lit five fire crackers in a pan Pop pop said the fire crackers cra cra crack He lit a joss stick long and black Then the proud gray joss in the corner stirred On his wrist appeared a gray small bird And this was the song of the gray small bird  Where is the princess loved forever Who made Chang first of the kings of men  And the joss in the corner stirred again And the carved dog curled in his arms awoke Barked forth a smoke cloud that whirled and broke It piled in a maze round the ironing place And there on the snowy table wide Stood a Chinese lady of high degree With a scornful witching tea rose face Yet she put away all form and pride And laid her glimmering veil aside With a childlike smile for Chang and for me  The walls fell back night was aflower The table gleamed in a moonlit bower While Chang with a countenance carved of stone Ironed and ironed all alone And thus she sang to the busy man Chang   The Chinese Nightingale  Have you forgotten Deep in the ages long long ago I was your sweetheart there on the sand Storm worn beach of the Chinese land We sold our grain in the peacock town Built on the edge of the sea sands brown Built on the edge of the sea sands brown   When all the world was drinking blood From the skulls of men and bulls And all the world had swords and clubs of stone We drank our tea in China beneath the sacred spice trees And heard the curled waves of the harbor moan And this gray bird in Love s first spring With a bright bronze breast and a bronze brown wing Captured the world with his carolling Do you remember ages after At last the world we were born to own You were the heir of the yellow throne The world was the field of the Chinese man And we were the pride of the sons of Han We copied deep books and we carved in jade And wove white silks in the mulberry shade   I remember I remember That Spring came on forever That Spring came on forever Said the Chinese nightingale   My heart was filled with marvel and dream Though I saw the western street lamps gleam Though dawn was bringing the western day Though Chang was a laundryman ironing away Mingled there with the streets and alleys The railroad yard and the clock tower bright Demon clouds crossed ancient valleys Across wide lotos ponds of light I marked a giant firefly s flight  And the lady rosy red Opened her fan closed her fan Stretched her hand toward Chang and said Do you remember Ages after Our palace of heart red stone Do you remember The little doll faced children With their lanterns full of moon fire That came from all the empire Honoring the throne The loveliest fÃªte and carnival Our world had ever known The sages sat about us With their heads bowed in their beards With proper meditation on the sight Confucius was not born We lived in those great days   The Chinese Nightingale  Confucius later said were lived aright And this gray bird on that day of spring With a bright bronze breast and a bronze brown wing Captured the world with his carolling Late at night his tune was spent Peasants Sages Children Homeward went And then the bronze bird sang for you and me We walked alone our hearts were high and free I had a silvery name I had a silvery name I had a silvery name do you remember The name you cried beside the tumbling sea  Chang turned not to the lady slim He bent to his work ironing away But she was arch and knowing and glowing And the bird on his shoulder spoke for him  Darling darling darling darling Said the Chinese nightingale  The great gray joss on a rustic shelf Rakish and shrewd with his collar awry Sang impolitely as though by himself Drowning with his bellowing the nightingale s cry   Back through a hundred hundred years Hear the waves as they climb the piers Hear the howl of the silver seas Hear the thunder Hear the gongs of holy China How the waves and tunes combine In a rhythmic clashing wonder Incantation old and fine  Dragons dragons Chinese dragons Red fire crackers and green fire crackers And dragons dragons Chinese dragons  Then the lady rosy red Turned to her lover Chang and said Dare you forget that turquoise dawn When we stood on our mist hung velvet lawn And worked a spell this great joss taught Till a God of the Dragons was charmed and caught From the flag high over our palace home He flew to our feet in rainbow foam A king of beauty and tempest and thunder Panting to tear our sorrows asunder A dragon of fair adventure and wonder We mounted the back of that royal slave With thoughts of desire that were noble and grave We swam down the shore to the dragon mountains We whirled to the peaks and the fiery fountains To our secret ivory house we were borne   The Chinese Nightingale  We looked down the wonderful wing filled regions Where the dragons darted in glimmering legions Right by my breast the nightingale sang The old rhymes rang in the sunlit mist That we this hour regain Song fire for the brain When my hands and my hair and my feet you kissed When you cried for your heart s new pain What was my name in the dragon mist In the rings of rainbowed rain  Sorrow and love glory and love Said the Chinese nightingale Sorrow and love glory and love Said the Chinese nightingale  And now the joss broke in with his song Dying ember bird of Chang Soul of Chang do you remember Ere you returned to the shining harbor There were pirates by ten thousand Descended on the town In vessels mountain high and red and brown Moon ships that climbed the storms and cut the skies On their prows were painted terrible bright eyes But I was then a wizard and a scholar and a priest I stood upon the sand With lifted hand I looked upon them   And sunk their vessels with my wizard eyes And the stately lacquer gate made safe again Deep deep below the bay the sea weed and the spray Embalmed in amber every pirate lies Embalmed in amber every pirate lies  Then this did the noble lady say Bird do you dream of our home coming day When you flew like a courier on before From the dragon peak to our palace door And we drove the steed in your singing path The ramping dragon of laughter and wrath And found our city all aglow And knighted this joss that decked it so There were golden fishes in the purple river And silver fishes and rainbow fishes There were golden junks in the laughing river And silver junks and rainbow junks There were golden lilies by the bay and river And silver lilies and tiger lilies And tinkling wind bells in the gardens of the town By the black lacquer gate Where walked in state The kind king Chang And his sweet heart mate With his flag born dragon And his crown of pearl and jade And his nightingale reigning in the mulberry shade   The Chinese Nightingale  And sailors and soldiers on the sea sands brown And priests who bowed them down to your song By the city called Han the peacock town By the city called Han the nightingale town The nightingale town Then sang the bird so strangely gay Fluttering fluttering ghostly and gray A vague unravelling answering tune Like a long unwinding silk cocoon Sang as though for the soul of him Who ironed away in that bower dim  I have forgotten Your dragons great Merry and mad and friendly and bold Dim is your proud lost palace gate I vaguely know There were heroes of old Troubles more than the heart could hold There were wolves in the woods Yet lambs in the fold Nests in the top of the almond tree The evergreen tree and the mulberry tree Life and hurry and joy forgotten Years on years I but half remember Man is a torch then ashes soon May and June then dead December Dead December then again June   Who shall end my dream s confusion Life is a loom weaving illusion I remember I remember There were ghostly veils and laces In the shadowy bowery places With lovers ardent faces Bending to one another Speaking each his part They infinitely echo In the red cave of my heart Sweetheart sweetheart sweetheart They said to one another They spoke I think of perils past They spoke I think of peace at last One thing I remember Spring came on forever Spring came on forever Said the Chinese nightingale  Vachel Lindsay   SILENCE  I have known the silence of the stars and of the sea And the silence of the city when it pauses And the silence of a man and a maid And the silence of the sick When their eyes roam about the room And I ask For the depths Of what use is language A beast of the field moans a few times When death takes its young And we are voiceless in the presence of realities We cannot speak  A curious boy asks an old soldier Sitting in front of the grocery store How did you lose your leg And the old soldier is struck with silence Or his mind flies away Because he cannot concentrate it on Gettysburg It comes back jocosely And he says A bear bit it off And the boy wonders while the old soldier Dumbly feebly lives over The flashes of guns the thunder of cannon The shrieks of the slain And himself lying on the ground   And the hospital surgeons the knives And the long days in bed But if he could describe it all He would be an artist But if he were an artist there would be deeper wounds Which he could not describe  There is the silence of a great hatred And the silence of a great love And the silence of an embittered friendship There is the silence of a spiritual crisis Through which your soul exquisitely tortured Comes with visions not to be uttered Into a realm of higher life There is the silence of defeat There is the silence of those unjustly punished And the silence of the dying whose hand Suddenly grips yours There is the silence between father and son When the father cannot explain his life Even though he be misunderstood for it  There is the silence that comes between husband and wife There is the silence of those who have failed And the vast silence that covers Broken nations and vanquished leaders There is the silence of Lincoln Thinking of the poverty of his youth   Silence  And the silence of Napoleon After Waterloo And the silence of Jeanne d Arc Saying amid the flames Blessed Jesus Revealing in two words all sorrow all hope And there is the silence of age Too full of wisdom for the tongue to utter it In words intelligible to those who have not lived The great range of life  And there is the silence of the dead If we who are in life cannot speak Of profound experiences Why do you marvel that the dead Do not tell you of death Their silence shall be interpreted As we approach them  Edgar Lee Masters   THE IDLER  When he passed him by Where the maids were spinning They would drop their work and sigh  Deem him worth the winning Where he wandered they would follow Where the river reeds were hollow  Dancing to his tabor But the old dames laughed at him Gibed at him and scoffed at him  Called him idle neighbor And the maids they blamed them all Mocked them all and shamed them all  Bade them get to labor  When he roamed along Where the lads were sheaving They would heed his happy song  And their sickles leaving Follow him the mad eyed rover Through the daisies and the clover  Where the bees were lurking But the farmers hated him Bruised and mauled and baited him  Damned him for his shirking   The Idler  And the lads they flouted them Cursed and cuffed and clouted them Drove them to their working  Now he lieth low Where the trees are waving And the breezes softest blow  There he hath his graving All the maidens sob and sorrow For their love who knows no morrow  And the lads are grieving All the birds sing sad of him The old folk are glad of him  Curse his sweet deceiving Cry Well rid of him God wot But their eyes grow dim God wot  Harvesting and weaving  THE POET  He sings of loves and tears to him denied Of aspirations that he never knew He is earth s mountebank and prophet too  And of men s sorrows he is crucified  Victor Starbuck   TH E FISHER LAD  The sky is all of a change now and over the sea there is red And swift as the wind the darkness has taken to wings and fled To the far side of the round world where lovers are gladly waiting For the soft breath of the night time to wander away to the mating  The sky is all of a change now in amber and red and gold And a clean fresh day is dawning for all of the fisher fold And the white sail of my small ship is alive to the wind s  wild pleading And the soft lap of the stirred sea is a sound in my heart song breeding  The sky is all of a change now and out on the tossing sea I ll lay my course for the vineyard God made for the likes of me And the soft breath of the night time will find me treasure laden With a light step and a clean hand and a song for a fisher maiden  Francis Buzzell    VOICES OF WOMEN  A LOST FRIEND  I wish there could have been Strong loyal innocent But one hour long ago The you I thought to be  High watch on things unseen Grave honor pure intent The soul I thought to know Gave all these things to me  I could have made a grave For that immortal hour For that immortal friend Still through my whole life mine  Purple and gold would wave Thought flower passion flower Above it to the end Comforting place and shrine  But where your image stood Oh there was never you My heart whence it is gone Feels a tired empty pain  You were a dream a mood Dim wavering untrue A ghost that passed at dawn And will not come again   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  THE NET  The strangers children laugh along the street They know not or forget The sweeping of the net  Flung to ensnare such little careless feet  And we we smile and watch them pass along With those who walk beside Soft smiling cruel eyed  We guard our own not ours to right the wrong  We do not care we shall not heed or mark Till we shall hear one day Too late to strive or pray  Our daughters voices crying from the dark  THE SINGER AT THE GATE  Must I always sing at the gate to hearten the men who fight For causes changeful as wind and as brief as the summer night  Must I always herald the wisdom of Man who is blind blind led Of kings who rule for an hour and die when the hour is dead   The Singer at the Gate  Of right that is wrong tomorrow of truths that were last year s lies Of little strifes and upbuildings that die when a nation dies  For all Assyria s captains are dead with the dead they made Dust of the gyve and anklet with dust of the casque and blade  But wonderful dreams blow still in the swirl of a smoke new gone As they blew from a fire at dusk for my brother in Ascalon  And Rome is withered and Hellas but leaves in the wind bow still As they bowed for my brother s dreaming who sang by some dead god s hill  For all of the mighty walls men have built to sweep down again Are shadows of visions spun by some poet far from men  I am tired of praising the deeds that are brief as a wind may be That change with the mocking turn of a year or a century  I go to spin dreams in dark that shall last until men are hurled Out into the space of the Timeless with ash of a burning world   THE LAST SONG OF BILITIS  Under dusky laurel leaf Scarlet leaf of rose I lie prone who have known All a woman knows  Love and grief and motherhood Fame and mirth and scorn These are all shall befall Any woman born  Jewel laden are my hands Tall my stone above Do not weep that I sleep Who was wise in love  Where I walk a shadow gray Through gray asphodel I am glad who have had All that life can tell  Margaret Widdemer   A CALL IN HELL  I have my best clothes on  A card case in my hand  And pain in my heart  Some one before I started Out from the happy home Kissed me On the unhappy eyes with his unhappy mouth And said Go out have cheer and see your friends The world goes on although we burn in hell  Across the rutty roads that lie in ridges Striped and barred like the back of a beaten woman Past windows blinded with lace So one shall not look in On five ten or a dozen covert lives Like his like mine like ours For all we do the best we can Under the complicated curse  Past blighted corners of streets Where the winds of loneliness take me and twist me Like a rag sodden with tears Forcing me to the shelter of strong houses Where at least a door will open if I ring   I hope no one will be in For if they are kind to me I shall cry  The door opens on Chinoiseries The mild white maid with many frills  Stands expectant  There are curtains at her back  Hot and red no gray  It is the East in Cromwell Road  The East where man is polygamous  And without reproach  They were in and not too kind   The kettle hissed and I drank  Then a parrot shrieked and I fled  And I am back in the street Stranded There are miles and miles of paving stones Rectangular with round bosses for the coal cellars They converge to a vanishing point Before they turn and hit me There is a cab and home Home What home The streets are kinder  Violet Hunt   DANCERS  PALACE MUSIC HALL Les Sylphides  To Nijinsky  The little white lambs frisk And flirt their woolen panties In meek and sleek sweet patterns They group about their shepherd  Hola An elegant shepherd  He trips like a young princess He has curls like a real Madonna And there he goes prancing And dancing and entrancing A little pastoral lady  But perhaps he is really a Panisk Running through tall white flowers After a white mademoiselle butterfly  He does not do it for money As they other here have done  He likes to jump and feel his legs  And after all I think he is a fairy prince And the dance means that he has lost his kingdom But that he will marry a king s daughter   INTERLUDE  Blow your tin squeals On your reedy whistle  How they come dancing White girls  lithe girls In linked dance From Attica Gay girls dancing  in the frozen street Hair streaming and white raiment Flying Red lips that first were Red in Ephesus  Gone You red nose piping by the Red Lion You You brought them Here take my pennies  Mon semblable mon frÃ¨re Richard Aldington   SISTER OF THE ROSE  When I love thee O Beloved it is with joy And laughter and song and sun And when I leave thee O Beloved Thou art not away For I am gathering cherries in the tree tops of thy meditation  Thou art always with me O Beloved in terror and peace For thou sweepest through me like a great wind And thou leavest no dust behind nor anything foreign But pathways pathways That thy thoughts have followed  I care not whether it be up or down the way I go with thee For always it has a flower in the grass And a tree overhead And the stream of thy laughter flows ever along Oh the slope of thy bosom is covered with clover in the  morning  Give me thy great flowers O Beloved That open boldly to the moon And the strong sweep of the flood Thou hidest in the ravines of thy sleep  Thou art a daughter of the lightning And a sister of the rose Thy kisses are as keen as the grass at midnight And thy tenderness a bowl of new milk   THE RAIN  My heart is a thread of silver in the rain And I am dissolved upon the roads My heart is a rock upon a hill And I glimmer like white boards  The stars are waiting in a hedge And upon the grass are shining sentinels And the dusk that follows the rain is as a mother to her  children  Who weareth smooth the scars with her caresses And to her moderation subdues the sharp speech  The hills have risen in a colored coat And the oak split to its root laughs at Heaven The fields are dimpled like a young infant And the brass bowl of the sun drips honey The fields are open like a flaming poppy And the sun blooms like a rose  Feet sound upon the road Oh the good sound of feet upon  the roads O my heart Have you drunk your fill of the rain for nothing   From age to age the spirits wage Their endless strife with God The spirits that are brave and strong And will not stoop nor plod  From age to age the spirits lose For God lifts high his Hell And strikes their struggling hands to earth And scatters them pelimeli  Men have but two hands and a brain And wills that often veer God stands upon the topmost plain And wields the sword of fear  God owns the cops and mighty shops And drives the motor cars But hungry men still mock his power As deserts mock the stars  From age to age do stricken men Who yet shirk not to be Withstand the onslaughts of their God As rocks withstand the sea   THE HAUNT  When night comes I fold my wings I must sleep When night comes I do not wake And do not weep  I drop down like dust that falls By the roads Where with green irreverent feet Pass the toads  When night comes the phantoms rise Fear and Lust Over me they pass like toads In the dust  When night comes I call no bride To my bed Fearful lest I give men life Who are dead  Orrick Johns  COMMENTS AND REVIEWS  THE RENAISSANCE  All criticism is an attempt to define the classic  I THE PALETTE No one wants the native American poet to be au courant with the literary affairs of Paris and London in order that he may make imitations of Paris and London models but precisely in order that he shall not waste his lifetime making unconscious or semi conscious imitations of French and English models thirty or forty or an hundred years old Chaucer is better than Crestien de Troyes and the Elizabethan playwrights are more interesting than the PlÃ©iade because they went beyond their models The value of a capital or metropolis is that if a man in a capital cribs quotes or imitates someone else immediately lets the cat out of the bag and says what he is cribbing quoting or imitating America has as yet no capital The study of comparative literature received that label about eighty years ago It has existed for at least two thousand years The best Latin poets knew Greek The troubadours knew several jargons Dante wrote in Italian Latin and ProvenÃ§al and knew presumably other tongues including a possible smattering of Hebrew I once met a very ancient Oxford head and in the middle of dinner he turned to me saying Ah urn ah poet Ah some one showed me a new poem the other day the ah the Hownd of Heaven   I said Well what did you think of it and he answered Couldn t be bothered to stop for every adjective That enlightened opinion was based on a form of com  parative literature called the classic education  The first step of a renaissance or awakening is the importation of models for painting sculpture or writing We have had many movements movements stimulated by comparison Flaminius and Amaltheus and the latinists of the quattrocentro and cinquecento began a movement for enrichment which culminated in the Elizabethan stage and which produced the French PlÃ©iade There was wastage and servile imitation The first effect of the Greek learning was possibly bad There was a deal of verbalism We find the decadence of this movement in Tasso and Ariosto and Milton  The romantic awakening dates from the production of Ossian The last century rediscovered the middle ages It is possible that this century may find a new Greece in China In the meantime we have come upon a new table of values I can only compare this endeavor of criticism to the contemporary search for pure color in painting We have come to some recognition of the fact that poets like Villon Sappho and Catullus differ from poets like Milton Tasso and Camo ens and that size is no more a criterion of writing than it is of painting  I suppose no two men will agree absolutely respecting pure color or good color but the modern painter recognizes the importance of the palette One can but make out one s own spectrum or table Let us choose Homer Sappho   The Renaissance  Ibycus Theocritus idyl of the woman spinning with charmed wheel Catullus especially the Collis O Heliconii Not Virgil especially not the AEneid where he has no story worth telling no sense of personality His hero is a stick who would have contributed to The New Statesman He has a nice verbalism Dante was right to respect him for Dante had no Greek and the AEneid would have stood out nobly against such literature as was available in the year 1300  I should wish for myself at least a few sirventes of BertrÃ¡n de Born and a few strophes of Arnaut Daniel though one might learn from Dante himself all that one could learn from Arnaut precision of statement particular ization Still there is no tongue like the ProvenÃ§al wherein to study the subsidiary arts of rhyme and rhyme blending  I should want also some further mediaeval song book containing a few more troubadour poems especially one or two by Vidal and Marueil six poems of Guido s German songs out of Will Vesper s song book and especially some by Walter von der Vogelweide  I should want Dante of course and the Poema del Cid and the Sea farer and one passage out of The Wanderer In fact some knowledge of the Anglo Saxon fragments not particularly the Beowulf would prevent a man s sinking into contentment with a lot of wish wash that passes for classic or standard poetry  So far as the palette of sheer color is concerned one could at a pinch do without nearly all the French poets save   Villon If a man knew Villon and the Sea farer and Dante and that one scrap of Ibycus he would I think never be able to be content with a sort of pretentious and decorated verse which receives praise from those who have been instructed to like it or with a certain sort of formal verbalism which is supposed to be good writing by those who have never read any French prose  What one learns from other French poets one might as readily learn from Voltaire and Stendhal and Flaubert One is a fool of course if one forego the pleasure of Gautier and CorbiÃ¨re and the PlÃ©iade but whether reading them will more discontent you with bad writing than would the reading of MÃ©rimÃ©e I do not know  A sound poetic training is nothing more than the science of being discontented  After Villon the next poet for an absolutely clear palette is Heine It takes only a small amount of reading to disgust one not with English poets but with English standards I can not make it too clear that this is not a destructive article Let anyone drink any sort of liqueur that suits him Let him enjoy the aroma as a unity let him forget all that he has heard of technic but let him not confuse enjoyment with criticism constructive criticism or preparation for writing There is nothing like futurist abolition of past glories in this brief article It does not preclude an enjoyment of Charles d Orleans or Mark Alexander Boyd Fra bank to bank fra wood to wood I rin  Since Lamb and his contemporary critics everything has been based and absurdly based on the Elizabethans who are   The Renaissance  a pastiche They are neither very intense nor very accomplished I leave Shakespeare out of this discussion and also the Greek dramatists Or let us say that Keats very probably made the last profitable rehash of Elizabethanism Or let us query the use of a twentieth century poet s trying to dig up what Sidney himself called Petrarch s long deceased woes  Chaucer should be on every man s shelf Milton is the worst sort of poison He is a thorough going decadent in the worst sense of the term If he had stopped after writing the short poems one might respect him The definite contribution in his later work consists in his developing the sonority of the English blank verse paragraph If poetry consisted in derivation from the Greek anthology one could not much improve on Drummond of Hawthornden s Phoebus Arise Milton is certainly no better than Drummond He makes his pastiche out of more people He is bombast of perhaps a very high order but he is the worst possible food for a growing poet save possibly Francis Thompson and Tasso  Goethe is perhaps the only one of the poets who tried to be colossi unsuccessfully who does not breed noxious contentments His lyrics are so fine so unapproachable I mean they are as good as Heine s and Von der Vogelweide s but outside his lyrics he never comes off his perch We are tired of men upon perches  Virgil is a man on a perch All these writers of pseudo Ã©popÃ©e are people on perches Homer and the author of the Poema del Cid are keen on their stories Milton and Virgil   are concerned with decorations and trappings and they muck about with a moral Dante is concerned with a senso morale which is a totally different matter He breeds discontentments Milton does not breed discontentments he only sets the neophyte trying to pile up noise and adjectives as in these lines  Thus th ichthyosaurus was dubbed combative   Captive he led with him Geography   Whom to encompass in th exiguous bonds   There is no end to this leonine ramping  It is possible that only Cavalcanti and Leopardi can lift rhetoric into the realm of poetry With them one never knows the border line In Leopardi there is such sincerity such fire of sombre pessimism that one can not carp or much question his manner I do not mean that one should copy the great poets whom I have named above one does not copy colors on a palette There is a difference between what one enjoys and what one takes as proof color  I dare say it is in this century inexplicable how or why a man should try to hold up a standard of excellence to which he himself can not constantly attain An acquaintance of mine deliberately says that mediocre poetry is worth writing If mediocrities want immortality they must of course keep up some sort of cult of mediocrity they must develop the habit of preserving Lewis Morris and Co  The same crime is perpetrated in American schools by courses in American literature You might as well give   The Renaissance  courses in American chemistry neglecting all foreign discoveries This is not patriotism  No American poetry is of any use for the palette Whitman is the best of it but he never pretended to have reached the goal He knew himself and proclaimed himself a start in the right direction He never said American poetry is to stay where I left it he said it was to go on from where he started it  The cult of Poe is an exotic introduced via MallarmÃ© and Arthur Symons Poe s glory as an inventor of macabre subjects has been shifted into a reputation for verse The absurdity of the cult is well gauged by MallarmÃ© s French translation Et le corbeau dit jamais plus  A care for American letters does not consist in breeding a contentment with what has been produced but in setting a standard for ambition A decent artist weeps over a failure a rotten artist tries to palm it off as a masterpiece  To be continued  NOTE I have not in this paper set out to give a whole history of poetry I have tried in a way to set forth a color sense I have said as it were Such poets are pure red pure green Knowledge of them is of as much use to a poet as the finding of good color is to a painter  Undoubtedly pure color is to be found in Chinese poetry when we begin to know enough about it indeed a shadow of this perfection is already at hand in translations Liu Ch e Chu Yuan Chia I and the great vers libre writers before the Petrarchan age of Li Po are a treasury to which the next century may look for as great a stimulus as the renaissance had from the Greeks  Ezra Pound   NOTE by the Editor Probably every poet may without ceasing to be selective exercise a certain liberty of taste in choosing the pure color for his palette Indeed Mr Pound implies this A symposium on the subject would be interesting Most English writing poets would probably find pure color in Poe not in The Raven which was after all a kind of stunt but in Helen thy beauty is to me and one or two other bits And are there not gleams of clarity in Kubla Khan in La Belle Dame sans Merci even in Lycidas  But certain Shakespearean songs and sonnets would be the basis of my palette  H M  MODERN GERMAN POETRY  II  Over and above the main body of poets who have succumbed to the equivocal position of the poet in modern German society one or two men stand out who have overcome their difficulties  First comes Hugo von Hofmannsthal unequal chary of production but surely a fine poet He is touched with neurosis has he not written Elektra but the disease has not destroyed him He has inherited the best strain of the German tradition its deeper and more significant melancholy and by the force of his personality he succeeds in escaping the sentimental I think the Ballade des ausseren Lebens among the best of his shorter poems  Und Kinder wachsen auf mit tiefen Augen Die von nichts wissen wachsen auf und sterben Und alle Menschen gehen ihrer Wege Und sÃ¼sse FrÃ¼chte werden aus den berbÃ©n Und fallen nachts wie tote Vogel nieder Und liegen wenig Tage und verderben   Modem German Poetry  Und immer weht der Wind und immer wieder  Vernehmen wir und reden viele Worte  Und spiiren Lust und Miidigkeit der Glieder  Und Strassen laufen durch das Gras und Orte Sind da und dort voli Fackeln BaÃ¼men Teichen Und drohende und totenhaft verdorrte   Wozu sind diese aufgebaut und gleichen  Einander nie und sind unzÃ hlig viele  Was wechselt Lachen Weinen und Erbleichen  Was frommt das ailes uns und diese Spiele  Die wir doch gross und ewig einsam sind  Und wandernd immer suchen irgend Ziele  Was frommts desgleichen viel gesehen haben  Und dennoch sagt der viel der Abend sagt  Ein Wort daraus Tiefsinn und Trauer rinnt  Wie schwerer Honig aus den hohlen Waben  Hofmannsthal is a link between classical German poetry and the modern European spirit His poems are brimful of content Compare with them the following two poems by Richard Schaukal  PERSEPOLIS  Im blauen Mondlicht  baden weisse hohe breitausladende Treppen SÃ ulenschatten schweigen auf den marmornen Stufen Leise auf weichen Tatzen schleichen LÃ²wen lustern suchend uber die Stiegen   GEFAHR  Durch ragendes Schilf zum gelben Strom Unter den breiten PalmenfÃ¡chern Schleicht mit gruÃ±en gierigen Augen der Tiger Ersclireckt verslummen die jauchsenden VÃ²gel Nur das Knistern und Rascheln der GrÃ ser und Stauden   Heiss und mude zum Bade rÃ¼stet ein Hindumadchen Spielend senkt sie die schmalen Fusse In die raschen schmeichelnden kiihlen Fluten Plotzlich lauscht sie neigt die Stirne Die Augen horchen ins bange Schweigen Die Arme stemmi sie auf zittert Hinter ihr steht und stockt mit dampfendem Atem der Tiger Sein glÃ¼hender Haucli fliegt Ã¼ber die glÃ nzende Schulter Nur das Gurgeln der Uferwellen Und einer Seele Ã¢ngstliches FlÃ¼gelschlagen   Schaukal s reputation is at least equal to that of Hofmannsthal Indeed his In der Heimat is for some mysterious reason one of the best known modern poems in Germany Perhaps because it is easy to memorize Most of Schaukal s poems are not in spite of their slightness Hofmannsthal s best poems are charged with intense feeling Schaukal is always cold and correct He avoids however both the sentimental and the vulgar and for this reason he surpasses most of his contemporaries He has studied Heine intelligently and realized one of the secrets of his art Heine escaped the sentimental by the perfection of his artistry The form of his poems is so crystalized so complete and satisfying that it invariably gives us an artistic pleasure Schaukal lacks humor and strong feeling but he has made himself a very skilful craftsman and he has imagination albeit of a somewhat   Modem German Poetry  theatrical character He has a sense of grace rare in German and he loves rococo parties and Venetian gondolas He is popular because the Germans wallow in the picturesque In a word Schaukal has nothing to say but gives us the impression that he would say it charmingly if he had And this is perhaps better than talking nonsense Moreover he can as we see in the poems quoted above call up a picture which remains upon the mind after the fashion of a successful stage scene On these grounds he justifies the claims of his admirers who invariably term him distinguished  But the poet in Germany who has triumphed most completely over his milieu and whose thought is most closely in touch with modern thought in other countries is Rainer Maria Rilke Born in 1875 one year after Hofmannsthal he is the first German poet of his epoch He has the artistry of Schaukal and imbues his work with an emotional quality more rich more subtle and more sensitive than Hofmannsthal He too is much influenced by Heine  INITIALE  Aus unendlichen SehnsÃ¼chten steigen endliche Taten wie schwache FontÃ¢nen die sich zeitig und zitternd neigen Aber die sich uns sonst verschweigen unsere frÃ²hlichen KrÃ fte zeigen sich in diesen tanzenden Trunen  Here we have an obvious echo But the bitter springs in Heine s temperament are absent Rilke s spirit is gentler instinct with a great faith and a strong hopefulness tinged with mysticism I know nothing in Heine quite so moving in its gentle simplicity as   DIE ERBLINDENDE  Sie sass so wie die anderen beim Tee Mir war zuerst als ob sie ihre Tasse eine wenig anders als die andern fasse Sie lÃ chelt einmal Es tat fast weh  Und als man schliesslich sich erhob und sprach und langsam und wie es der Zufall brachte durch viele Zimmer ging man sprach und lachte da sah ich sie Sie ging den andern nach  verhalten so wie eine welche gleich wird singen mÃ¼ssen und vor vielen Leuten auf ihren hellen Augen die sich freuten war Licht von aussen wie auf einem Teich  Sie folgte langsam und sie brauchte lang als ware etwas noch nicht iiberstiegen Und doch als ob nach einem Ãbergang sie nicht mehr gehen wiirde sondern fliegen  Rilke has sly humor too Witness the Titelblatt to Die Stimmen or Voices of the Under men  Die Reichen und GlÃ¼cklichen haben gut schweigen niemand will wissen was sie sind Aber die DÃ¼rftigen mÃ¼ssen sich zeigen mÃ¼ssen sagen ich bin blind oder ich bin im BegrifT es zu werden oder es geht mir nicht gut auf Erden oder ich habe ein krankes Kind oder da bin ich zusammengefÃ¼gt Und vielleicht dass das gar nicht genÃ¼gt  Und weil alle sonst wie an Dingen an ihnen vorbeigehn mÃ¼ssen sie singen  Und da hurt man noch guten Gesang   Modem German Poetry  It is just this attitude of Rilke s towards the under man free minded but not sentimental that places him in touch with modern thought He realizes the place of the gentle and ineffectual in the scheme of things and he neither rhapsodizes nor prates He has no doctrines only eyes that see and ears that hear and deep feeling and hope that life will conquer in the end I should have liked to quote in full his poems entitled Jus einer Sturmnacht I can only quote extracts but you will see the combination of power and sensibility that makes Rilke s poems so strangely moving After the Titelblatt he plunges forward  In solchen NÃ¡chten kannst du in den Gassen Zukiinftigen begegnen schmalen blassen Gesichtern die dich nicht erkennen und dich schweigend vorÃ¼berlassen Aber wenn sie zu reden begannen wÃ rst du ein Langevergangener wie du da stehst langeverwest Doch sie bleiben itti Schweigen wie Tote obwohl sie die Kommenden sind Zukunft beginnt noch nicht Sie halten nur ihr Gesicht in die Zeit und kÃ´nnen wie unter Wasser nicht schauen und ertragen sie s doch eine Weile sehn sie wie unter den Wellen die Eile Von Fischen und das Tauchen von Tauen In solchen NÃ chten gehn die GefÃ ngnisse auf Und durch die bÃ²sen TrÃ ume der WÃ chter gehn mit leisem GelÃ chter die VerÃ chter ihrer Gewalt Wald Sie kommen zu dir um in dir zu schlafen Mit ihren langen Strafen behangen Wald   In solchen NÃ¢chten wÃ¡chst mein Schwesterlein  das vor mir war und vor mir starb ganz klein  Viel solche NÃ chte waren schon seither  Sie muss schon schÃ²n sein Bald wird irgendwer  sie frein  In addition to these poets of the major pretension Germany has others who content themselves with less ambitious aims They imitate Heine for the most part Sometimes they are incredibly poor and lifeless as for example the lyrics of the well known Ricarda Huch sometimes their work is charming light and neatly phrased Otto Julius Bierbaum who died recently was perhaps the most successful of these and his collection of twenty years work lrrgarten Der Liebe Verliebte launenhafte moralische und andere Gedichte is one of the most attractive productions among the minor  lights Reginald H Wilenski  REVIEWS  Satires of Circumstance Lyrics and Reveries with Miscellaneous Pieces by Thomas Hardy Macmillan  The irony of fate which has been the persistent subject of Mr Hardy s art is illustrated by his own destiny We say sing paint carve build only what we are This poet recording in many novels the pitiful play of men and women against the sardonic indifference of nature voicing the cruel humor of life which maliciously thwarts its own joy is an old man before he recognizes his deepest vocation and turns to the muse s altar   Reviews  It is useless to wonder what we have missed through this tardy call to song So many poets gave us their all in youth Shelley Keats Coleridge Arnold many another that dawn seems the time for singing and it is difficult to understand this twilight voice of the sage Yet in this case the inversion seems something more than a mere mischance the irony covers a deeper meaning for those not satisfied with surface vision  For Mr Hardy s life has rounded slowly into shape wrung out its essence tardily into music He is as one who wanders long through stark bare country up and down over sharp rocks and comes at last not to a mountain top commanding great spaces not to the Grand Canyon proud with glory but to an eminence whence the country he has traveled loses its piecemeal littleness to gather together into a grave unity There is no glamour no splendor the sky and the world are veiled with gray and heavy clouds overhang the dim spaces beyond him But there is a round earth to stand on a sphered sky to breathe in and a stern and solemn song to sing  The indifference of nature becomes almost malice to this poet In the brake Cimmerian through which we grope we may catch a fleeting futile moment of joy But even joy s  large luminous living eyes Regard me in fixed inquiring wise As those of a soul that weighed Scarce consciously The eternal question of what Life was   And why we were there and by whose strange laws That which mattered most could not be  The poet makes God complain to man thus  When you slowly emerged from the den of Time And gained percipience as you grew And fleshed you fair out of shapeless slime Wherefore O Man did there come to you The unhappy need of creating me A form like your own for praying to  He emphasizes the ironic austerities of destiny with fifteen little incidents of common life satires of circumstance Perhaps the last of these the talk of a man at his wife s grave is the most profoundly tragic  O lonely workman standing there In a dream why do you stare and stare At her grave as no other grave there were  If your great gaunt eyes so importune Her soul by the shine of this corpse cold moon Maybe you ll raise her phantom soon  Why fool it is what I would rather see Than all the living folk there be But alas there is no such joy for me  Ah she was one you loved no doubt Through good and evil through rain and drought And when she passed all your sun went out  Nay she was the woman I did not love Whom all the others were ranked above Whom during her life I thought nothing of  In one or two poems we catch an echo of the epic theme of The Dynasts the destructive futility of war Channel Firing in which dead soldiers of ancient wars sit up in their   Reviews  coffins at the sound of guns and find  All nations striving strong to make Red war yet redder  this might have been written last August instead of last April And it more truly expresses the poet s feeling about war than the final war poem which repeats the conventional confidence that victory crowns the just  Mr Hardy has been reproached often enough for harsh diction such phrasing as frilled by the numb of the morning fulth of numbers cold currents thrid etc But somehow the style suits the man and his subject belongs to the bleak country he is travelling in One must take him or leave him as he is in all his austere sincerity this poet who in the teeth of the chill gray wind utters the truth of life as he feels it in music whose discords make a bitter tune  H M Open Water by Arthur Stringer John Lane Co  Mr Stringer has the over heated enthusiasm of the convert Having used rhyme and the usual metrical conventions since the days of The Woman in the Rain he now in an eloquent foreword to his latest book discards them as mediaeval apparel The poet he says must still don mail to face Mausers and wear chain armor against machine guns Rhyme has been imposed upon him it is one of the immuring traditions with which time and the prosodian have surrounded him Rhyme and meter have compelled him to sacrifice content for form have left him incapable of what may be called abandonment   This has a familiar ring Milton himself was hardly more emphatic when he denounced rhyme as the invention of a barbarous age to set off wretched matter and lame metre To him in the seventeenth century as to Mr Stringer and others today it was a troublesome and modern bondage of no true musical delight imposed on the art by mediaeval jinglers against the authority of the learned ancients  As POETRY has been a voice crying in the wilderness for freedom from trammels and conventions urging the public to give rein to the poet s individuality and accord him his own gait whether it be rhyme or vers libre it would be unbecoming to complain of the presence of this Saul among the prophets But one may reasonably note that he does not wear the prophet s robes as though to the manner born Mr Stringer is not yet at home with free verse which has its own boundaries and austerities Poetry is no easier to achieve without rhyme and iambs than with them  Many of these new poems seem too easily written In none of them does one find such rhythmic beauty as Mr Stringer attained in the blank verse of The Woman at Dusk or such adroit and accomplished art as he revealed in that poignant narrative in quatrains The Girl Who Went to Ailey It may be that he will evolve a style in the new medium but he does not yet convince us even by such resolute heroics as these  God knows that I ve tinkled and jingled and strummed That I ve piped it and jigged it until I m fair sick of the game   Reviews  But now I want to slough off the bitterness born of it all I want to throw off the shackles and chains of time Yea I will arise and go forth I have said To the uplands of truth to be free as the wind Rough and unruly and open and turbulent throated 1 Yea I will go forth and fling from my soul The shackles and chains of song  Alas one can t fling them away those shackles Th e finest poems in this new book are those in which Mr Stringer has clung closest to the old measures Sappho s Tomb has a delicate trochaic movement which seems to follow the light steps of the searchers At Charing Cross is persistently iambic in its solemn march And the beautiful wistful Protestations is as regular in form and movement as if it rhymed Its closing lines perhaps outrank anything else in the book  Yet the end of all is written And nothing O rose leaf woman You ever may dream or do Henceforth can bring me anguish Or crown my days with joy Three tears O stately woman You said could float your soul So little a thing it seemed Yet all that s left of life I d give to know your love I d give to show my love And feel your kiss again  Even this however is not so memorable as certain earlier poems by Mr Stringer Thus it is with some doubt that one wishes him a bon voyage on his new road May he find masterpieces along the way H M   OUR CONTEMPORARIES  It is with deep regret that we record the suspension of Poetry and Drama the interesting quarterly which has been spokesman for the art in England as POETRY is in America Under the able editorship of Mr Harold Monro with the co operation of the group of poets centering at the Poetry Bookshop this magazine was winning its way to a permanent place and established authority when the war broke over the world and made any such venture precarious or impossible Mr Monro hopes to resume publication early in 1916 provided the war is over  The last number is a particularly good one containing new poetry by M Emile Verhaeren the Belgian Messrs Robert Frost and Ezra Pound Americans and eighteen English poets including Messrs Lawrence Flint Aldington and Davies Mr Hueffer completes his study of Impressionism and M de Gourmont has an article on French Literature and the War  Perhaps it is not too late to call our readers attention to the wholly admirable article on Prosody by the Laureate in the September number of the same periodical This subject is usually so befogged by all who write about it that an intelligent nay an illuminating word is more than welcome H M   NOTES  Mr Vachel Lindsay of Springfield Illinois needs no introduction to readers of POETRY except for his revision of his name His two books General Booth Kennerley and The Congo Macmillan are aiding us to make his work familiar  Mr Lindsay wrote The Chinese Nightingale in Springfield and New York between May and October 1914 while his father and mother were in China visiting their son in law and daughter who are medical missionaries at Lu Chow Fu The poet who has never seen China himself says of the poem  The intention of the piece is to combine such elements of Chinese decoration and whim as are to be found by the superficial observer in the curio store the chop suey restaurant the laundry the Chinese theatre To these are to be added such general ideas of China as may be acquired in any brief

month was published last spring in the International through a mistake of one of the editors of that monthly to whom it had been sent for private perusal The poet from whom we had previously accepted it forgot to inform us at the time and we who usually read Mr Viereck s cleverly ardent paper apparently missed that issue  The other error is more serious The printer s devil is no fabulous creature of myth but a real monster of sin and   Notes  malice From our January issue he dropped the first line of The Musicmaker s Child by Miss Miriam Allen de Ford thereby doing his utmost to make the poem unintelligible The first quatrain should read  Long time my mother lived in Culm  A maiden waiting for a man to take her  Then for the love of his blue eyes  She wandered after Weir the musicmaker
