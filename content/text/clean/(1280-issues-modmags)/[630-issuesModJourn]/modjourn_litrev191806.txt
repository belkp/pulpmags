couBut no queen comes In slipper greenPROSE ABOUT LOVE William Carlos Williams I LOVE youIt lays everything flat before it and scatters its own roses and palm branchesIt is as it were some fabulous sword which will not be gainsaidBut it is a weapon of appalling difficulty to the human handNaturally each imagines himselfthe one to wield itso that the phrase has inevitably become tangled in a snarl of vain excusesWhole libraries are built of nonsensical twaddle explaining lovea blade encrusted with historic stupiditiesThe justice which gives life to Boccaccio s tales is the all per vading power of loveThe modern tolerance of The DecameronMacy s1 45is partly Protestant spite and partly the corrupmorality which ascribes to the tales a satiric attack upon the corruption of the clergyPure nonsenseLove lives everywheresays 6 The Little Review Boccaccioand proceeds to the celebrationBut perhaps it would be as well to talk of matters of style and not quote from the tale of Spinelloccio Tanena and Zeppo di MinoBoccaccio lived in a time when love was at the noonTodayIn JohannisjeuerSudermann takes as a theme the proposition that passion has come too lateit is merely a pagan survivala StJohn s bonfirea dying flash from an outworn flameSudermann is frankly pessimisticIn his environment and time one could not logically be otherwiseA poet would have gone insaneNietzsche went insaneIn this same environment Richard Wagnerafter a brave burst of passion extending over nearly his whole lifecame at last to KundryParsivalthe Christian myth and forgivnessOr witness Lope de Vega Carpio s life as set down by James Fitzmau rice Kellyedited by Edmund Gosse Lope lived a life of gallantryand troubled his wife s last years by his intrigue with Maria de LujanA relapsingcarnal sinner Lope was more weak than badhis rare intellectual giftsled him into temptation Those who wish to study the abasement of an august spirit may do so in the Ultimos Amores de Lope de Vega Carpio etcHere is the authentic and disgusting mixture of pity and pious censure which I seek to brand as the modern attitude toward loveIbsen is a swelter of ignorance on this pointthe most illuminating example of the perverse possibilities for inverted power in the phraseI love you that can be foundand for the reason that Ibsen truly knew lovefelt its powerbut succumbed to its difficultiesGod rest the ashes of a kingNils LykkeYes perhapsbut the sureness of touch that created Odyssius beside Circe and left Penelope waiting noOnly in the morose and abnormal mind of a Hedda Gabbler can Ibsen safely spread his wings and then he must kill the lady to escape his audience and keep his play upon the boardsThe sillymodernplays about illicit love affairs after marriage end either happily in a burst of laughter or sordidly with the discharge of a pistolThe explosions of the gunpowder or laughter I suppose are to cover the fact that the plays are without intellectual climax whateverThey end and the audience has been insulted and likes itShaw s Candida goes along rather amusingly in the spirit of a The Little Review childishthough falseas it turns out laterdemocracy of thoughtaping the puzzled romanticism of IbsenWe are given a few nice Dickensesque caricatures of English middle class lifebut in addition the feeling is of an actual love tussel going on under this inconsequential surfaceBut thenhaving got his situation rather well in hand love on the high road to satisfaction the author shies at the last barrier and conceeds to his audience that he has been after all merely manipulating his effigies for a melodramatic concession tothe playby which a false logic is forced into Candida s mouthmaking a conventional finisWhat really has happened is that Shaw looses his nerveCandida is the beginning and the end of all attempt made by Shavian thought to cope with this difficult phraseI love youAfter this first play there is never again an attempt to meet the situation face to face but there goes on a cheap tomfooleryalways stopping short of the denoument which might have ended Candida brilliantlybut distastefully to the thought of the dayI love youEvery approach is that of complete evasionOne remembers the fuss kicked up by The Second MrsTanguerayone thinks of papal bulls on the subjectone remembers that the Russian Church allows of no divorceone remembers what he himself wrote an early ageNo careful young man or woman should neglect to be both rejected and accepted in lovethat for a startHalf an imagination is all that is necessary for either and it is far more important to a manthis matter of lovethan a business or college educationwhich by the way exist by and for love onlyyou jackassesThe only comment I have to make istreasure your chastityThe man of spirit is chaste up to the beginning of the child bearing period if he value the integrity of his very fragile mind as it is during those yearsLater the conditions are obviously changedHaving attained to this happy state of complete native experience ie having been both rejected and accepted at this point the art of love may be said to beginI take note of none whose love once given has not so broken him to its uses that he is forever bent like a tree at the sea shoreBy this I infer that no matter how often love take a manthe object of that love will be forever saored and especially to be protectedTwo special warningsPlatonic love is that stage of affection The Little Review just preceeding mental enlightenmentIt does not do to linger here on pain of a subtle castration or a stupidnearly accidental accomplishmentPreceeding marriage a man s freedom is often seriously compromised by the fear of procreationAll one can say to this is that without an inborn spiritual clear sightedness one may make a fool of himself by a stupid choice of partnerAim higher than you expect to reach and be thankful if you have aimed high enoughBut marriageridiculouslyis the great stumbling block of all commentators on loveThey seem to think that one is in some way related to the otherno more so than a bird to the tree where it perchesThe thing is simplicity itselfThe Churchgood Godis old enough to be listened toMarriage is permanentAnd we know of course that love is changingFreedom must end herequothaWhywithout an affection that has led to marriage it is impossible to continue ably in the art of loveMarriage is a stigma of virulencethe without which none of a free lifeBut the ferreting habit is hard to breakso they go onthese commentatorsevery man or womantop and bottomrotten with hopeThe characteristic of marriage is its earthinessits stabilityIt argues a certain firmfootedness of the spiritA wife is chosen or a husband by reason of certain attractions of more or less importancedepending on the power of foresight in the individual to accord his life with a spiritual aimThe western habit of monogamy is closely bound up with the inability to marry at allthat isto co ordinate effort with the dirtThe western habit of one wife and any number of illicit sweethearts desirable is the only habit consistent with good senseTo a man of early power and power must come early to be effective the sense for a wife is strong I thinkTo have failed to pick a good wifeto have failed in the initial move of spiritual construction implies a weak spiritperhaps a weak mindDante chose Beatrice who with all due allowance for mediaeval tenor of thought was his wife in exactly the sense I meanTo a man of spirit the loss of his chosen wife will be a spiritual catastrophy of such magnitude that he cannot envision it without experiencing at the same time a sense of insecurity extending down The Little Review to the foundation of his personal consciousnessDivorce is an abomination as repulsive as the face of an idiot and for exactly the same reasonDivorce is either a lamentable confession of stupidity or it is ineffectiveShelley made a profound mistake in sharing the popular confusion as to what marriage is and is notBy making the fuss he did he merely advertised the incapacity of his own pateIt would be a base stupidity to leave the art of love to bachellors and maidensOnly the married know lovefor they only are the ones who have approached the question simply enough to have planted themselves firmly in its wayand not those who so little consider the earth as to have made of it a kind of mental froth which thereupon turns about and solves their riddlesince one becomes what he has erroniously imagined just as one becomes what he has correctly imaginedImagination has as much to do with dirt as with whatever other fiberFrancesca was marriedGuinevere was marriedYsoldt was marriedMellisande was marriedDeirdre was marriedHelen was marriedBeatrice was married and of course Odyssius was married but men are more secretive about these things than women areat least they do not let themselves get put into literatureThe heart has springtimes every yearSo it has its winters and so a man should separate from his wife at the time of some foreign love longing on either partThe wife is then in the winter of his affection or he in hers and is soice bound and unresponsivejust as when ice holds a hitherto lively streamThere are too the rare pleasures of benevolencerare because seldom enjoyedSeparation removes the necessity for idle pretenses but by no means alters the conjugal attachment of husband and wifeA popular and idle pastimeso cleverly drawn by Molierewho knew a thing or two about married lifehaving learnt them first handpurposely is for lovers to deride the husband as one who has been fooledThis is not only bad taste but may be as often as not inaccurate observationBut to deride a wife who is disarmed because of her affection is the pastime of a numbskullOne s ability to remain attached to his wife hinges upon the accuracy with which his own life has been conceivedMoliere wanted to write a certain kind of play so he married a certain kind of wife She worked for him properly and wellLove does not seek to calumnise anyone nor to injure anyIt io The Little Review has solely to do with itselfAll the stupidities of which plays are made and books writtenThe ignorant tattle of the so called triangle and the wise squabbling with the Divine ChurchThe jejune crusade for free loveit is all infantileweak brainedThe cryafter free love is like a man running from house to house ringing the door bells and telling folk that it is daylightConcupiscence is the imbecile side of love attractionsFully roused men in every age have had all the lovers they wantedbut usually one wife imagined or realBut all plain or simple truth comes slowly into its ownEvery aristocracy has known what I have set down herebut what they have not known is lhat to keep knowledge the secret of a class means death to itTo all truth lifeScience died in alchemyreligion died in papacyetcAll knowledge must be infused with the ether of complete dispersion or it diesStrong men have had their concubines perhaps oneperhaps manywomen likewise and will continue to have thembut by keeping this a secretholding it from public viewweaklings are given a chance to ape their betters in perfect security until the whole system is brought into disrepute and decay sets inHamy good simple peopleyou are fooled by your betters who keep you confused for their profitBut the truth isI don t know which of you is the more muddle headedHere truth s set downDon t be puffed upThis isn t the flattery of a sermon but a scientific treatisefor love s sakeWe are most of us a stingy lotwe want all for ourselveswe want to imagine that for a moment at least we have become cannibals and have eaten our sweetheart body and soulat the very least to the exclusion of a thievish fellowOf course when one is in love the concentration is such that this reaction is humanly naturalbut the good of the thing is not in that but in that intense vision which love is for its little momentChoke back the follythe purtian folly that forbids you to sayI love youSay itif you canOf love s humility and its gentleness no prose can speak in fit terms no didactic prose at any rateOne should not forget of course that manners are not nearly ona level with artIt is pure stupidity to act as if they were which of course salts all I have said The Little Review 11 LOVE SONG William Carlos Williams HE You have come between me and the terrifying presence of the moonthe starsthe sun and the earth with all its crooked outgrowthsThe desolation of life has been darkened by your shadowbut toward me your face has been a lightyour hands have been a soft rainthe voice from between your lips a thing that carries me as the air carries a birdI have spread my arms out with wide feeling you about me and looked up and taken a deep breathDeepdeepan April in every finger tipSHE From your eyesfrom among what you saytangled like a singing bird in a green treeyou have entered and spread down through me all so that I treasure my youth again and wish it never to go from me for it is not mine but yours that I shall hold warmlysafely within me forever after a pauseSHE Your love song halts and repeatsHE Your song is glibThe Little Review DREAMS IN WAR TIME Amy Lowell I I wandered through a house of many roomsIt grew darker and darkerUntilat lastI could only find my way By passing my fingers along the wallSuddenly my hand shot through an open windowAnd the thorn of a rose I could not see Pricked it so sharply That I cried aloudII I dug a grave under an oak treeWith infinite careI stamped my spade Into the heavy grassThe sod sucked itAnd I drew it out with effortWatching the steel run liquid in the moonlight As it came clearI stoopedand dugand never turnedFor behind meOn the dried leavesMy own face lay like a white pebbleWaitingIll I gambled with a silver moneyThe dried seed vessels ofhonestyWere stacked in front of meDrywhite years slipping through my fingers One by oneOne by onegathered by the Croupier Faites vos jeuxMessieurs The Little Review 13 I staked on the redAnd the black wonDry yearsDead yearsBut I had a systemI always staked on the redIV I painted the leaves of bushes red And shouted FireFire But the neighbors only laughed We cannot warm our hands at them they saidThen they cut down my bushesAnd made a bonfireAnd danced about itBut I covered my face and weptFor ashes are not beautiful Even in the dawnV I followed a procession of singing girls Who danced to the glitter of tambourinesWhere the street turned at a lighted cornerI caught the purple dress of one of the dancersButas I grasped itit toreAnd the purple dye ran from it Like blood Upon the groundVI I wished to post a letterBut although I paid muchStill the letter was overweight What is in this package said the clerk It is very heavyYes I said And yet it is only a dried fruit 14 The Little Review VII I had made a kiteOn it I had pasted golden starsAnd white torchesAnd the tail was spotted scarlet like a tiger lilyAnd very longI flew my kiteAnd my soul was contented Watching it flash against the concave of the skyMy friends pointed at the cloudsThey begged me to take in my kiteBut I was happy Seeing the mirror shock of it Against the black cloudsThen the lightning came And struck the kiteIt puffed blazed fellBut still I walked onIn the drowning rainSlowly winding up the string LUST Ben Hecht I USED to frequent the Blue Inn to hear Pippa playShe was a strange fragile creature with a curious gnome like face that seemed to have been colored by the moonHer body in its invariable lavender dress was like a little round column of vanishing smokeOn the performersplatform in the Blue Inn Pippa played the violin between six o clock and ninethe hours during which the greedy half dead put fuel into their belliesNow that Pippa is dead I sometimes return to the Blue Inn and behind a bottle of wine sit and think of her with a proper sadnessOn the performersplatform a muscular woman plays the violinShe is dressed like a woman about to dance in a ball roomAnd while the greedy half dead stuff fuel into their bellies she plays for The Little Review is them saccharine meditations and toilet water balladsI remember as I look at the amorous grease on this woman s face how I met Pippa and why she diedAlasPippa was so easy to kill there is perhaps no moralno point to these memories of mineThe yellow wine in my glass twinkles like an eye of topazOutside is the citythe Ophelia of stone that shrieks and babbles between the movements of the sunAlways in the back of my brain there is present the cityan elephantine grimacea wilderness of anglesa swarm of gestures that caress my thought like a dream unbornFrom her place on the performersplatform Pippa played the violinShe wore a lavander dress and in her dark eyesthis was the first time I saw herwere strange vibrations of yellow lightThe Inn was filled with peopleelaborately dressed women and shiningly groomed menThey sat grouped about white linened and silver laden tablesan ornamental and grimacing little multitudeThe men and women who came to the Blue Inn came as to some grave riteThey moved to their tables with an unctious nonchalanceThe women were dressed in effulgent silkstheir flesh gleaming among the spaces of exotic plumage and flaires of luxurious and satin distortionsThey were like a company of erotic puppetsthese womenwhose bold bodies lived in a secret worldTheir clothes formed a separate company that gestured and grimaced with the grotesque charm and passion of lustful marionettesFrom the secret world which they inhabited their bodiesmoist and earth skinnedbeckoned with a luscious and perversedenial of artificeOn the walls of the Blue Inn which were lost in shadows were painted nymphs and satyrs sprawling over tapestried landscapesThe insistently naked bodies of the nymphs lay like newly bathed housemaids under the trees and amid the stiff park sceneryViewed through the shadow they seemed miracles of photographic lecherya leering profusion of creatures from the secret worldwho had removed their beauty with their clothesThe people who were eating occasionally looked at the walls and their decorationsThe men sometimes studied the naked figures with a profound interesteyeing the women near them shrewdly as they turned awayThe women sometimes gazed with serious unconcentrated eyes at the paintingsgrowing tender and quiet towards their escortsIn the center of the great room was the motif of the placea 16 The Little Review fountain surmounted by a marble nude who knelt upon a rocky pinnacleThe figure crouched in a posture of surprise and gazed into the water of the large tiled basin belowThe fountain gushed up around her in an endless spray of twisted gauzesveiling her as it felland filling the air with an odorless spiceBlue electric lights hidden in the crevices of the structure cast an amorous glowa sort of artificial moonlight upon the tables that surrounded itBeneath the cobalt water of the fountain basin moved colored fish gliding under the surface like a weaving procession of little fat MandarinsThe remainder of the room was illumined with blue shaded lights and the air was heavy with the uncoiling lavender wreaths of tobacco smokeA luxurious suppression as that about some priapic altarproduced here by the artificial shadowsthe painted lights and the forlorn ripplings of the fountainsat grotesquely upon the placeThe faces of the diners were bathed in the warm tones of the lights which tinted their cheeks with mildly sinister glints and dropped whimsical shadows across their mouthsIt was here the gestures detached from the common larva of the streets came to dinea curious aristocracy crowned with a fulgurating complacencyHuddled together in the lugubrious painted twilight they sat in a gluttinous and mysterious comradarieperpetually eating and murmuringThe waiters in shining beetle backed black coats with gold buttoned red vests moved continuously aboutbringing food upon huge sliver platters or wheeling it in on little enamelled wagons from which aroseas from sacrificial pyresblue and violet jets of flameThrough the air slipped the sounds of laughterthe cacophony of knives and forksthe melodious and fugitive tinkle of glass ware and the spurting gutterals of human voices bursting in an endless muffled obligatoPippa came foward to play upon her violinI raised my eyes and saw her for the first timeIn this room of rutelian artifice she seemed a creature of neurotic simplicityHer elfin proportionsthe color of her face and arms so reminiscent of moonlightthe monotone of her dress and bodyappeared for the moment like some ultimate study in roccocoThen I perceived that Pippa who played the violin might sit as she was beside a river in a sunlit wood with her feet dangling above the dark silver of the water and belong thereThe music of the violin accompanied by harp and piano fell soothingly upon the airThe noises abatedThe serious jingle of the cutlery alone persisted and the multitude seemed lost The Little Review 17 in a sweet innocuous contemplation that was relieved only by the ceaseless grimacings of its distended jaws and throatsAs the music grew sweetermore saccharinely eloquentthe smear of faces became less animatedThe eating continuedhoweveras if under the sudden necessity of secrecyLips remained engaged in detached and obscene gesticulationsnoses dilating and twitchingtongues twisting and washing in an invisible frenzyIn the quiet which had fallen the abandonement of the eaters continued to reflect itself in the continuous spasms which contorted their facesOf such things I had not been aware beforebut now the smokelike frality of Pippa seemed to carry me out of the scene and it was with her dark eyes tipped with wraiths of yellow that I stared aboutI had glimpsed in these curious eyes of hers and in the nudity of her manner a creature through whose viens disgust and nausea moved like heavy poisonsSpitted against the grey curtain like some rare lavender moth upon an exhibitor s boardPippa playedand the insistent mewing of her violin with its dolorous mockery became for me the crying of her body rather than the sounds of a little wooden instrument Phantasy I thought and looked with a smile into the topaz wineBut my imagination whispered to me it had not liedI watched Pippa and observed that the moonlight color of her face was in realty a frown which spread its dark beam from her eyes and bathed her featuresAnd more than before I drew close to the anguish that beckoned to me out of the little violin playerWhen I again looked about me a certain curious detachment had come into my eyes and the scene appeared to have popped into some new and glaring focus for meI saw the foreheads of the diners glistening with a fine sweat that was reproduced on the backs of the women s necksupon their chinsunder their raised armsand gleamed again upon the cool intervals of breasts staring white and bulbous out of a secret worldThe music from the platform grew livlierleaving the wailing adagio for a scherzo movementThe quick incompleted flourishes of arms and handsthe syncopated bobbing of headsbecame more intenseThe boom and jerk of human voices sounded once moreFrom mouths opening and shutting in a swollen and delicious discomfort appeared glimpses of salavic meat and breadThe wriggling of bodies in a growing satiety of tepid luststhe glassiness of 18 The Little Review eyes lighted for instants by visions of bloody meatsthe smackinggaspingfaintly growling sounds which accompanied the contorted animations of facestransformed the multitude into a confusion of toilet like sensualityTo this scene Pippa playedher eyes gleaming like avenging birds over the drab erotic of the restaurantFor a moment she encountered me and her gaze remained fixed and I felt that she was speaking to meThen her eyes wandered and I knew that she was cricling the faces at the tablesmen s faces smilinggloweringbeseeching as they peered at womenfaces blue emptythick green faces filled with slovenly languishIt was the and apoplecticroundredwhitepointedchubbymalformed and faces of the women that Pippa watched mostThe shining coiffeurs alive with garnet and russet gleamsthe glowing beady eyes gave her a sense of so many masks carefully cut behind which things hidThis I knew then as I sipped at the topaz in my glassAnd I knew also that this smoke like creature had been looking down into the simmering vat of faces until a curious mania had darkened her ownAs she played a fury possessed herI watched her swayThe thoughts which came into my head I called her thoughtsand I watched the steaming gelatinous dishes and the bathed trim faces above them become as onecarcass devouring carcassA delicate necropheliaa hideous rhythmic convulsion appeared to Pippain my thoughtto have taken possession of us who sat before herAnd now and thenstill with her thoughtI could distinguish sharply a woman eating wtih perverse daintinessworking her features with piquant deliberationsmilingprimpingswallowing her food as one oblivious to a vulgar indescretionAnother toying gently with the contents of her plateattitudinizing as grotesquely as some Dido in a bathroomeating with an ennui which stamped her as an Uranian of gourmondsAnd under the tables Pippa saw their feetthe cunningly shod feet of the women emerging from the secret worldthe awkward stretch of the silkened bird like legs which like a lifeless mechanism lay in disjointed collapse above the floorThese feet of the men and women seemed a company of their own under the tableslavishly scrolled and attiredslothful debauches that moved imperceptiblyembracedentwinedkissed and staredHere was unconsciousness of wrinkles and folds of flesh and continually devouring jawshere a silent stoical intimacyAnd yet to Pippa the shining leatherthe The Little Review 19 gleaming arches above the shoesthe faintly glowing stockingsand the creeping tenacious movement of these feet were like the phlegmatic shadows of some terrible nakednessLater I met PippaIt was in the city walking along the avenue which faces the lake and lies like a large yellow cat purring in the sunIn this light and even under the menacing walls of the buildingsthere was about Pippa s body as she moved a curious uncorseted rhythm such as trees have when they bend in the windWe walked together and talked and I knew that the things I had thought watching her in the Blue Inn had not been chimeras from the topaz in my glassHer face as she talked had the gleam of a frightened nymphWe hurried along the bottoms of great buildingsShe had few words and spoke hurriedly so that her sentences died amid the racket of the trafficI told her what I had imagined listening to her play and she answered in matter of fact words Yes she said I can t endure itEverything is lustThe dirty lust of the citythe lust of the restaurant and the streetsAnd the womenthey keep parading in my head when I try to fall asleepThere is something terrible and unclean about lifeI can t make out what it isBut it keeps choking me and making me dark insideAt night I have horrible dreams and the city becomes an animal with its tongue hanging outrunning back and forth as if it were blindand steaming at the mouthI know it s foolish to think such thingsBut in the restaurant it comes to me so strong that I play only mechanically and almostalmost die There were other times that I saw Pippaand my philosophy ripened upon her agonized wordsThe thing which is always in the back of my headthe elephantine grimace of the citybecame when I was with her something close and almost with outlineThrough the nauseous mania of her soul I looked as through some rare lens into the streetsinto the places where the little greedy half dead swarmDuring the day surrounded by the din and grime of the city I thought of Pippa who at nightspitted against the grey curtain of the perfromersplatformwould play the violin Is it ugliness I asked her one time much laterShe said No Her eyes had grown darker and wilderWe walked on hurridely in the afternoon picking our way through the rush of people and traffic I don t know what anymore she said It keeps close to me20 The Little Review Oh I hatehateI keep feeling the breath of an animal on my neckon the back of my neck It was summerand when Pippa told me that she was to have a rest of three weeks I selected for her a place beyond the cityAt the edge of a great wood I had once found a little houseand thither Pippa wentShe smiled from the train window at me and Ithinking of the promise that I would come in four dayswaved my handWhen I came to see Pippa it was evening and the world about the wood was as silent as the skyThe people who lived in the house told me Pippa had gone away in the morning into the wood and had not returnedI waited until the darkness had settled into the deep impenetrable mist of night that swims through wooded placesAnd then the old man of the house and I went out to look for PippaThe odor of the wood stirred the darkness and the little rustling symphony of the wood hung like a lace of sound upon the silenceHere and there the moon lay in spectral hexagons among the thick black treesWe walked until we came to a river and on its bank we sat downWe had been sitting thus for long minutes in silence when floating gently upon the black water I saw the white body of a girlIt was Pippa nakedShe moved in a slowaimless manner toward usHer hairloosenedplayed across her breasts in little black moonbeamsHer lips were opened and the water frolicked in little silver bursts upon her teethHer eyes like flakes of snow twinkled under the black mirror of the river HAUNTS Carl Sandburg There are places I go when I am strongOne is a marsh pool where I used to go with a long ear hound dogOne is a wild crabapple treeI was there a moonlight night with a girlThe dog is gonethe girl is goneI go to these places when there is no other place to goThe Little

he was absorbed in his duties as agent of the Standard Oil Company Hern s Grocery will be getting low on coal oilI ll see themhe mutteredhurrying along the street and bowing politely to the right and left at the people walking pastWhen George Willard went to work for the Winesburg Eagle he was besieged by Joe WellingJoe envied the boyIt seemed to him that he himself was meant by nature to be a reporter on a newspaper It is what I should be doingthere is no doubt of thathe declaredstopping George Willard on the sidewalk before Daugherty s Feed StoreHis eyes began to glisten and his forefinger to tremble Of course I make more money with the Standard Oil Company and I m only telling youhe added I ve got nothing against you but I should have your placeI could do the work at odd momentsHere and there I should run finding out things you will never see Becoming more excited Joe Welling crowded the young reporter against the front of the feed storeHe appeared to be lost in

awayWhen he had taken several steps he stopped and looked back I m going to stick to youhe said I m going to make you a regular hummerI should start a newspaper myselfthat s what I should doI would be a marvelEverybody knows that When George Willard had been for a year on the Winesburg Eaglefour things happened to Joe WellingHis mother diedhe went to live at the New Willard Househe became involved in a love affair and he organized the Winesburg baseball clubJoe organized the baseball club because he wanted to be coach and in that position he began to win the respect of his townsmen He is a wonderthey declaredafter Joe s team had whipped the team from Medinah County He gets everybody working togetherYou just watch him Upon the baseball field Joe Welling stood by first basehis whole body quivering with excitementIn spite of themselves all the players watched him closelyThe opposing pitcher became confused NowNowNow shouted the excited man Watch meWatch meWatch my fingersWatch my handsWatch my feetWatch my eyesLet s work together hereWatch meIn me you see all the movements of the gameWork with meWork with meWatch meWatch meWatch me With runners of the Winesburg team on bases Joe Welling became as one inspiredBefore they know what had come over them the base runners were watching the manedging off the basesadvancingretreatingheld as by invisible cordsThe players of the opposing team also watched JoeThey were fascinatedFor a moment they watched and thenas though trying to break a spell that hung over themthey began hurling the ball wildly about and amid a series of fierce animal like cries from the coach the runners of the Winesburg team scampered homeJoe Welling s love affair set the town of Winesburg on edgeWhen it began everyone whispered and shook their headsWhen they tried to laugh the laughter was forced and unnaturalJoe fell in love with Sarah Kinga lean sad looking woman who lived with her father and brother in a brick house that stood opposite the gate leading to the Winesburg CemeteryThe Little Review The two KingsEdward the fatherand Tom the sonwere not popular in WinesburgThey were called proud and dangerousThey had come to Winesburg from some place in the south and ran a cider mill on the Trunnion PikeTom King was reported to have killed a man before he came to WinesburgHe was twenty seven years old and rode about town on a grey ponyAlso he had a long yellow moustache that drooped down over his teeth and he always carried a heavywicked looking walking stick in his handOnce he killed a dog with the stickThe dog belonged to Win Pawseythe shoe merchantand stood on the sidewalk wagging its tailTom King killed it with one blowHe was arrested and paid a fine of ten dollarsOld Edward King was small of stature and when he passed people in the street laughed a queer unmirthful laughWhen he laughed he scratched his left elbow with his right handThe sleeve of his coat was almost worn through from the habitAs he walked along the streetlooking nervously about and laughinghe seemed more dangerous than his silent fierce looking sonWhen Sarah King began walking in the evening with Joe Welling people shook their heads in alarmShe was tall and pale and had dark rings under her eyesThe couple looked ridiculous togetherUnder the trees they walked and Joe talkedHis passionate eager protestations of loveheard coming out of the darkness by the cemetery wall or from the deep shadows of the trees on the hill that ran up to the Fair Ground from Waterworks pondwere repeated in the storesMen stood by the bar in the New Willard House laughing and talking of Joe s courtshipAfter the laughter came silenceThe Winesburg baseball teamunder his managementwas winning game after game and the town had begun to respect himSensing a tragedy they waitedlaughing nervouslyLate on a Saturday afternoon the meeting between Joe Welling and the two Kingsthe anticipation of which had set the town on edgetook place in Joe Welling s room in the New Willard HouseGeorge Willard was a witness to the meetingIt came about in this wayWhen the young reporter went to his room after the evening meal he saw Tom King and his father sitting in the half darkness in Joe s roomThe son had the heavy walking stick in his hand and sat near the doorOld Edward King walked nervously aboutThe Little Review 27 scratching his left elbow with his right handThe hallways were empty and silentGeorge Willard went to his own room and sat down at his deskHe began trying to writebut his hand trembled so that he could not hold the penHe also walked nervously up and downLike the rest of the town of Winesburg he was perplexed and knew not what to doIt was seven thirty and fast growing dark when Joe Welling came along the depot platform toward the New Willard HouseIn his arms he held a bundle of weeds and grassesIn spite of the terror that made his body shake George Willard was amused at the sight of the small spry figure holding the grasses and half running along the platformShaking with fright and anxiety the young reporter lurked in the hallway outside the door of the room in which Joe Welling talked to the two KingsThere had been an oaththe nervous giggle of old Edward King and then silenceNow the voice of Joe Wellingsharp and clearbroke forthGeorge Willard began to laughHe understoodAs he had swept all men before himso now Joe Welling was carrying the two men in the room off their feet with a tidal wave of wordsThe listener in the hall walked up and down lost in amazementInside the room Joe Welling had paid no attention to the grumbled threat of Tom KingAbsorbed in an idea he closed the door andlighting a lampspread the handful of weeds and grasses upon the floor I ve got something herehe announced solemnly I was going to tell George Willard about itlet him make a piece out of it for the paper I am glad you are hereI wish Sarah were here alsoI been going to come to your house and tell you of some of my ideasThey are interestingSarah wouldn t let meShe said we would quarrelThat s foolish Running up and down before the two perplexed men Joe Welling began to explain Don t you make a mistake now he cried This is something big His voice was shrill with excitement You just follow meYou will be interestedI know you willSuppose thissuppose all of the wheatthe cornthe oatsthe peasthe potatoes were all by some

destroyednothing left but these wild thingsthese grassesWould we be done forI ask you thatWould we be done for Again Tom King Growled and for a moment there was silence in the roomThen again Joe plunged into the exposition of his idea Things would go hard for a timeI admit thatI ve got to admit thatNo getting around itWe would be hard put to itMore than one fat stomach would cave inBut they couldn t down usI should say not Tom King laughed good naturedly and the shivery nervous laugh of Edward King rang through the houseJoe Welling hurried on We would begindo you s eeto breed up new vegetables and fruitsSoon we would regain all we had lostMind I don t say the new things would be the same as the OldThey wouldn tMaybe they would be bettermaybe not so goodThat s interestingehYou can

want to tell her of this There was a scraping of chairs in the roomIt was then George Willard retreated to his own roomLeaning out at the window he saw Joe Welling going along the street with the two KingsTom King was forced to take extraordinary long strides to keep pace with the little manAs he strode along he leaned over listeningabsorbedfascinatedJoe Welling again talked excitedly Take milk

hero and villain sharp enoughhe went on to explainwith the result that the victory of the good was not decisive enoughand the defeat of the evil not sufficiently crushing and finalAside from his failing to understand my work and my intentionsI find myself compelled to insist that his ideals are wrongheadedand his understanding of life falseLife is always and everywhere inconclusiveNothing in

lifeshould I attempt to follow a good to the endI should as surely find myself following all of lifeAll distinctionsdemarcations and articulations are conventional and arbitrary and ephemeralWhich is the good and which the evilWhich the victor and which the victimTo answer these is no part of the writer s jobIt is no part of my jobMy job is where my interest lies in the confluence of all lifeAn illustration will help to make my meaning clearThe reader will recall thatsome time backa Western surgeon condemned a certain child to deathbecausein the opinion of this surgeonthe child s eventual career harbored a social menaceSeen from the artist s outlook upon lifethis surgeon s conduct was reprehensibleHad a mob of his fellow citizens gathered outside this surgeon s windowclamoring that he let the child diehis reply should have beenLadies and gentlemenI am neither judgejurynor executionerThe social consequences of this child s subsequent behavior lie outside the narrow field of my limited activitiesI am a surgeonThis child s case is surgicalI shall treat it to the best of my abilityGood day Consider The Saturday Evening Post the other editor wrote me You may say what you like about the ideas which are acceptable to the millionsor the ideas which the editors think are acceptable to the millionsIt is you who know and they who are ignorantBut where art is concerned the millions speak with authority The millions make only one demand of the artist and that is impactforcegustoAnd in doing so they make the primarythe fundamentalthe essential demandWhen you stop to think of it you know they are right This is the religion of democracysomewhat rhapsodically statedand we of the Occident are of course committed to democracytoday more so than ever beforeBut we are under no compulsion to agree thatwhere art is concerned the millions speak with authority The simple truth is that where art is concerned the millions do not speak at all unless it is to jeer at the artistor to cry that he be jailed for failing to conform to some social fiction The millions make only one demand of the artist and that 34 The Little Review is impactforcegusto That is to saythe millions demand onlypunch That is certainly trueand that is precisely itfor that is all they do demandBut the meagerness of their demands is their besetting sinIt is not their virtueWhy do the millions demand so littleLet no one misunderstand meI am not here finding fault with the stories now being publishedI speak for the stories now being rejectedI deny equally Ezra Pound s insistence on literacy and Bernard Shaw s cry for journalismI do not say that all writers should know the classicsI do not ask that all stories should be literatureAll I ask is that our editors should not insist on all stories being journalismForaside from all other objectionsthere is still this to be said against journalismjournalism exaggerates the significance of current eventsjournalism attributes fantastic consequences to our behaviorOur worst possible conduct is not nearly so different frOm our best possible conduct as our journalism would lead us to believeThe belief that we should all turn perfect devils but for the Thou shalt nots of our own making is sheer grosspreposterous flattery of ourselvesWere all our prohibitions wiped out tomorrow the practical difference of our behavior would not be noticible a month henceNor do I speak in the name of TruthThe craving for truth is a sign of intellectual poverty or parsimonyat best it is a desire for social efficiency and in all cases it signifies a shrinking from having to make living adjustments to a living environmentI ask for nothing radical at allI do not hold forth against giving the millions what they wantI speak for the numerous intermediate reading publicsAll I ask is that while the millions are being so plentifully served that the thousands be not neglectedIndeedthe millions are being too plentifully servedThey have long since passed the point of saturationThe number of our magazines being published at a loss in giving the millions what they want is the best proof of thisDo I mean that our editors do not know their businessYesfar too many of themFar too many of our editors are either lame imitators of Henry Jamesor terribly capable fabricators of peppunch and push advertising copyeither disappointed novelists or successful advertising menIn either case they are incapable of appreciating American intellectual life without prejudiceThink of itthere is not a single magazine in this country The Little Review 35 making any consistent effort to reach the thousands who read the translationsOur editors do not even know that America is not one but manyThey are not even aware that America today is the one country without a

help to remove from the mind of the reading public Whitman s great audience some of the superstition of its importance to the writersome of its superstition of being able to put any compulsion upon an artistAll compulsion exists within the artistIt would take too long to discuss this fully hereThe only concern of the artist is to try in one short lifetime to meet these inner compulsionsHe has no concern with audiences and their demandsjhj Missed Opportunities XYZ New YorkI haven t seen the Little Review lately but am of course hopefulalwaysSomehow you folks had the opportunity missed by

the universeThe Little Review could stand a little Catholicism This is a very typical letterIt comes from all kinds of peoplefrom men like the writer who is anxious about American artand from the plain man cherishing his vices of provincialismOn the other hand there have been enough people of educaton and vigour of mind to back our The Little Review faith in an aim to establish some sort of intellectual communication between AmericaEngland and FranceWe have had no dream as yet of spanning the universeOur interest and intent the past year has been to span the Atlanticto end America s intellectual isolationWe published the Little Review for three yearsgiving almost all our space to more or less interesting experiments by American writers and to some achievementsOur books show the same balance of support and criticism as for the present concernIt is a slow and wearing processtrying to establish a magazine of the arts in AmericaOthers have failed even when heavily endowedWe have tried to do a double task on faith and with spiritWe have given over almost the entire space for one year to our foreign contributorsWe think we have established some sort of audience for contemporary British and French workOur correspondent says we had the opportunity missed by the New Republicthe Dialthe Seven Artset alWe are not aware that these journals have had the opportunity to do what we

splendid periodical should be allowed to so deteriorateLiterary Circle Elizabeth Longfellow SiddonsCassvilleNew YorkI have wanted for a long time to congratulate you on the great work your magazine is doing for the cause of real art in AmericaAs Secretary of the Ocumseh Literary Circle I have been commissioned by the membersupon unanimous vote at the last meetingto tell you that of all the magazines which have been gone through by our reading circle in the past year the Little Review has been deemed the most worthy of praise and commendation for the very high merit of its content and also for the excellent work it is doingIn our reading circle which meets every week we have discussed the most advanced literary magazines regularly and had papers presented on them by each memberSyracuse now has a large bookstore where we can get the very latest thing in literature when we go to townThe sentiment of the circle has been unanimously throughout that the Little Review is unqualifiedly right in saying that America needs a great artistic awakeningThough we are only a small part of this great countrywe have felt the dead weight of ignorance of the fine and beautiful things in life and especially the lack of some medium to convey to us some of the deeper things that the great artists and writers of Europe are doingProbably not one person in threepossibly not one in fourout here knows anything at all of the work of Romain Rollandundoubtedly one of the greatest writers of this century in The Little Review 61 FranceAnd what a long way we have yet to go from him to the greater masters with whom you are beginning to make us acquainted every month inyour Little ReviewWe have had this brought home to usoh so forciblyby the brilliant things MrPound has said about the reading public in this countryI cannot tell youthough I would like tohow much we enjoy the things MrPound has so cleverly said about artistic America in the Little ReviewWe are grateful to him and to the Little Review About Newsstand Sales The Little Review is not for sale on all the newsstandsNewsdealers are not particularly interested in displaying a magazine which makes no bids for popularityand our means in distribution to casual readers are therefore somewhat limitedMany readers have placed standing orders with their newsagentsin order to insure as many copies as they may want every monthThis is the next thing to subscribing62 The Little Review NOTES This is called an American number not because its contributors are Americansmost of them are not but because they are all at present living and working in AmericaIt is offered as a resume of the current work of a represenative groupbut to be fully representative it should include also such poets as Robert FrostMina LoyMarianna MooreOwing to various delays in the postetc these may appear in another numberI I am responsible for this issueIt was made with no compromise to Margaret Anderson and Ezra PoundIt is not a revolt against ourforeign all star cast It is not areturn to our former ways It is not a jury free experimentIt is not an effort to find more ArtIt is simply a review of work being done in America by writers who are called artistsWe have been attacked since the beginning for ourpersonal judgments My belief in personal judgments is unimpairedI am not discrediting them by presenting an issue free from such judgmentsThe contributions in this issue are those selected by their writers to represent themArt is its own freedomThere can always be argument as to whether a work of art is of first or second degreebut none as to whether or not it is ArtComments are solicitedjhII If a man writes me that he encloses a poem which he thinks I will find worth printingif only as a study in blank versebecausefor various reasonshe has written very good blank verseetc etc I am practically sure that his poeqwill not beinteresting By this I mean that it will not have a first interestas contrasted with what I call the second interest that attaches to allniceworkall excellent workall that iswell done etc etcFor instanceon page 38 there is a poem with the lineher round eyes become wet and protrude like an overfull inkstand This is excellentBut the poem does not stand as a thing of first interestIt is this very definite dividing line that serves me with my definition of the artistIt is because I believe intensely in it that Alfred Kremborg thinks I am a bad editorIt is for this reason that I think I am a good oneI believe the world offers sufficient boredomsI see no reasonwhile I retain consciousnessto assist in the process of multiplying themThis is merely to voice my protest against the present number which in several instancesto mefalls tosecond interests or belowMCAThe
