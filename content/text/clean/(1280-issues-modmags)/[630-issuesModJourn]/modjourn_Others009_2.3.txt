With faint dry sound, Like steps of passing ghosts, The leaves, frost-crisp'd, break from the trees And fall. Release With swift Great sweep of her Magnificent arm my pain Clanged back the doors that shut my soul From life. Triad These be three silent things: The falling snow.   .   the hour Before the dawn.   .   the mouth of one Just dead. Trapped Well and If day on day Follows, and weary year On year.       and ever days and years.   . Well? ##168 ADELAIDE   CRAPSEY Moon-shadows Still as On windless nights The moon-cast shadows are, So still will be my heart when I Am dead. Susanna And The Elders "Why do You thus devise Evil against her?"   "For that She is beautiful, delicate; Therefore." Youth But me They cannot touch, Old age and death.   .   the strange And ignominious end of old Dead folk! The Guarded Wound If it Were lighter touch Than petal of flower resting On grass, oh still too heavy it were, Too heavy! Winter The cold With steely clutch ##ADELAIDE   CRAPSEY 169 Grips all the land.   .   alack, The little people in the hills Will die ! Night Winds The old Old winds that blew When chaos was, what do They tell the clattered trees that I Should weep? Amaze I know Not these my hands And yet I think there was A woman like me once had hands Like these. The Warning Just now, Out of the strange Still dusk.   .   as strange, as still. A white moth flew.   .   Why am I grown So cold? Fate Defied As it Were tissue of silver I'll wear, O fate, thy grey, And go mistily radiant, clad Like the moon. ##170 LELIA MILLER PEARCE MACHINE MADE I am the woman at the loom— Throwing the merry shuttles back and forth Flat-bosomed, I am moulded for the Task Gaunt and unwomanly— The great wheels mutter, snarl, and jeer— Others ill shapen as I, strive persistently— Slope focused down, a vista with no end, Grey and unlovely— From what drab beginnings did we spring?— Tossers of bobbins in a mad hemisphere?— Work-soddened, we are fathered by the Task— Sweat of factories— These are our forbears—these—the looms— Fathers and mothers of dull, wan, humanity— Soul-starved, we are breeders of our Kind— PVuit of clamorings— Dusk frees the woman from the loom— Hobbles the shuttles for the night, jarringly— Wheel-weaned, the loom-daughter dreads the Dawn's Call of nativity—##        WALLACE  STEVENS 171 DOMINATION OF BLACK At night, by the fire, The colors of the bushes And of the fallen leaves, Repeating themselves, Turned in the room, Like the leaves themselves Turning in the wind. Yes: but the color of the heavy hemlocks Came striding— And I remembered the cry of the peacocks. The colors of their tails Were like the leaves themselves Turning in the wind, In the twilight wind. They swept over the room, Just as they flew from the boughs of the hemlocks Down to the ground. I heard them cry—the peacocks. Was it a cry against the twilight Or against the leaves themselves Turning in the wind, Turning as the flames Turned in the fire, Turning as the tails of the peacocks Turned in the loud fire, Loud as the hemlocks Full of the cry of the peacocks? ##172 WALLACE  STEVENS Or was it a cry against the hemlocks? Out of the window, I saw how the planets gathered Like the leaves themselves Turning in the wind. I saw how the night came, Came striding like the color of the heavy hemlocks. I felt afraid— And I remembered the cry of the peacocks. TATTOO The light is like a spider. It crawls over the water. It crawls over the edges of the snow. It crawls under your eyelids And spreads its webs there— Its two webs. The webs of your eyes Are fastened To the fiesh and bones of you As to rafters or grass. There are filaments of your eyes On the surface of the water And in the edges of the snow. ##WALLACE  STEVENS 175 THE FLORIST WEARS KNEE-BREECHES My flowers are reflected In your mind As you are reflected in your glass. When you look at them, There is nothing in your mind Except the reflections Of my flowers. But when I look at them I see only the reflections In your mind, And not my flowers. It is my desire To bring roses, And place them before you In a white dish. SONG There are great things doing In the world, Little rabbit. There is a damsel, Sweeter than the sound of the willow, Dearer than shallow water Flowing over pebbles. Of a Sunday, She wears a long coat, With twelve buttons on it. Tell that to your mother. ##174 WALLACE  STEVENS SIX SIGNIFICANT LANDSCAPES I An old man sits In the shadow of a pine tree In China. He sees larkspur, Blue and white, At the edge of the shadow, Move in the wind. His beard moves in the wind. The pine tree moves in the wind. Thus water flows Over weeds. II The night is of the color Of a woman's arm: Night, the female, Obscure, Fragrant and supple, Conceals herself, A pool shines, Like a bracelet Shaken in a dance. ##WALLACE   STEVENS 175 III I measure myself Against a tall tree. I find that I am much taller, For I reach right up to the sun, With my eye; And I reach to the shore of the sea With my ear. Nevertheless, I dislike The way the ants crawl In and out of my shadow. IV When my dream was near the moon, The white folds of its gown Filled with yellow light. The soles of its feet Grew red. Its hair rilled With certain blue crystallizations From stars, Not far off. V Not all the knives of the lamp-posts. Nor the chisels of the long streets, Nor the mallets of the domes And high towers, ##176 WALLACE  STEVENS Can carve What one star can carve, Shining through the grape-leaves. VI Rationalists, wearing square hats, Think, in square rooms, Looking at the floor, Looking at the ceiling. They confine themselves To right-angled triangles. If they tried rhomboids, Cones, waving lines, ellipses— As, for example, the ellipse of the half-moon— Rationalists would wear sombreros. INSCRIPTION FOR A MONUMENT To the imagined lives Evoked by music, Creatures of horns, flutes, drums, Violins, bassoons, cymbals— Nude porters that glistened in Burma Defiling from sight; Island philosophers spent ##WALLACE  STEVENS 177 By long thought beside fountains; Big-bellied ogres curled up in the sunlight, Stuttering dreams. BOWL For what emperor Was this bowl of Earth designed? Here are more things Than on any bowl of the Sungs, Even the rarest— Vines that take The various obscurities of the moon, Approaching rain And leaves that would be loose upon the wind, Pears on pointed trees, The dresses of women, Oxen.   .   . I never tire To think of this. ##178 ARTHUR  DAVISON   FICKE THE  DANCER They were godly people, all of them, With whom I dined In the cafe that night— Substantial citizens With their virtuous wives And a stray daughter or two. And when I spoke my admiration of your dancing,— You, the little half-clothed painted cabaret performer Who was pirouetting before us,— I received a curious answer.— It was only as the absurd voicing Of a preposterous fancy That one of the virtuous wives said to me— "Why don't you go over and dance with her yourself!" Her voice stung me,—it was so sure That to dance  with  you would be  a  shameful and unpleasant thing. So I answered crossly—    "For a nickel I would." And one of the daughters, Who doubtless suffered later for her evil act, Handed me the   nickel...... And that was how it came to be That you and I Before  the  gaping  herd  of  my  respectable   fellow-townsmen## arthur davison  ficke 179 Forgot the world. Light was the pressure of your hand And your body was as answering to my touch As is a little willow to the wind. I could not see your painted face against my shoulder; I forgot that you were clad in veils to lure the lustful crowd ; The tawdry glitter of the hour faded and died As you and I soared up Upon the music. O soul of a bird ! O cooling wind from the mountains of wild laurel! O dreamer of a pattern of whirling stars Down which we moved In dizzy orbits ! Perfumes of Arabia were around us ; Tremulous melody heard by none other Out of some distant garden poured in wild song. And there were lights in the air; And there were memories Of forgotten Thracian hillsides, And madness, and oblivion, And a fierce white peace. Then the dance ended..... And you were once more a little painted harlot In an ugly cafe Before a vulgar audience. ##180                arthur  davison   ficke So I led you back to your table And thanked you conventionally, And turned to go.—   But a sudden impulse Swept me.— And in the sight of all the gaping respectabilities I turned to you again And kissed you In recognition and farewell To that winged spirit which you late had been. ##carl  sandburg 181 CHILD The young child, Christ, is straight and wise And asks questions of the old men, questions Found under running water for all children And found under shadows thrown on still waters By tall trees looking downward, old and gnarled, Found to the eyes of children alone, untold, Singing a low song in the loneliness. And the young child, Christ, goes on asking And the old men answer nothing and only know love For the young child, Christ, straight and wise. STATISTICS Napoleon shifted Restless in the old sarcophagus And murmured to a watchguard: "Who goes there?" "Twenty-one million men, Soldiers, armies, guns, Twenty-one million Afoot, horseback, In the air, Under the sea." And Napoleon turned to his sleep: "It is not my world answering; ##182 carl  sandburg It is some dreamer who knows not The world I marched in From Calais to Moscow." And he slept on In the old sarcophagus While the aeroplanes Droned their motors Between Napoleon's mausoleum And the cool night stars. LOUIS MAYER'S ICE PICTURES "Icy Shores" Why has the sea hurled itself on the land Now that summer is gone And winter is the big player? Neither is the winner. Both strugglers, sea and land, Are locked in a standstill. Only the ice is a victim. It happened to be caught between. So the ledges are crumpled . . broken playthings. They are equal to a toy town of blocks Kicked over by children Who are gone away. ##carl  sandburg 183 "Walrus Bay" High banks with a hard feel to them Stand up from a slow plash of gray waves. Humped rocks too And looking twice at the humped rocks We see they are not walrus playing tag As we guessed at first. No life of blood, throat and nostril Runs under them; they are granite Heaved up years ago to companion the sea. "Solitude" I can have this cool loneliness And you can take along what you want Here of this cool loneliness. It is not like prairie land Nor a single crag Nor a level of ocean. Little hills around it Keep off winter, The big rough player. A disc of cool loneliness, I always ask it: What are you waiting for? It seems so sure somebody is coming. ##184 kenneth  burke ADAM'S SONG, AND MINE You pass me merrily. Your hair dashes back like the spray under a racing bowsprit. Your eyes are alight. You beckon me. You dare to beckon me Because you do not understand The baby rabbits at your feet. Virgin ! You do not understand my quivering. Your legs are bare.  I am ashamed ! Yes, I am coming. I am coming to scramble with you Through the angry bushes. I shall race with you over the wet sand, And I shall bear with your innocence Until You feel how warm my breath is,— Virgin ! ##edward ramos 185 CHANSON TRISTE My heart is sorrowful and my dreams are broken, The light of the sun shines not upon my house. I went into the forest Treading the dry leaves And I saw two gleaming black eyes. I thought it was a tiger And my bones cried out in terror. I thought it was a snake And my soul writhed in anguish. I tumbled on a wet tree-root And fell fainting into the morass, The green toads croaked at me The mud oozed round my belly .... I turned and saw Two black gleaming eyes .... My heart is sorrowful and my dreams are broken, The light of the sun shines not upon my house. ##186 edward ramos L'ARBRE MYSTIQUE The slender tree Has leaves that droop like little folds of silk; Their delicate green Melts into the blackness of the night. Passing beneath I seem to feel soft touches on my cheek As though invisible wings Or the stretching hands of some body-searching spirit Brushed past me. My soul Disintegrates ; Like a wave driven by the wind It bursts. Each spark Flies up To find a body in the silent leaves. RAPIERE A DEUX POINTS (To G. K.) Your eyes are like two flames dancing on the carved surface of a gem.## ROBERT ALDEN  SANBORN 187 THE DESERTED BALLROOM I The dancers all have gone, Leaving their souls behind them ; Pallid and frail their souls, With not a fleeting foot to mind them; Their souls are not their own. Wearing their fleshly wraps, They have returned to the prose Of the sandy shore, Robed in the rags of dancers long before. And still, But never still, The lyric water of the ballroom floor Laps the firm prose of the sand, And ever laps. The sea is still; Only the rhythm of the waltz, Sprinkled in waves upon the starlit space, Lingers like dropped petals of the dancers' grace The sea is mirror of the will To paint the laugh of pleasure Forever on the face. ##188 ROBERT  ALDEN  SANBORN II My breath faints upon my lips. For forth from the untenanted night One cometh wandering in a dream. Holding aloft a taper whose wan flame skips On the faded rhythm of the ballroom floor; Some sated dancer in a plight Of loss, spreading a ghostly gleam. There is no tide of music, is it to dance once more She brings her light? The sea, how still. The moon, how very pale. Is it without avail Her beams drip from the eaten candle, spill Gouts of warm gold upon the sable floor? Who passed in sobbing haste from prose of sand To descend upon the sea that echoes with the dance? A splash of welcome in the glance Of feeble rays descending; And a clasp of mortal hand With spirit, in a hope unending. The waxen moon confers a lure that glozes The prose of sandy shore, and closes The reaching gap from satiate dancer to his soul. ##ROBERT  ALDEN  SANBORN 189 She comes with pity of forbidden light In which to find again his loosened aureole. III There is a lustral peace abiding In the moon upon the sea; There is no lost soul hiding In hope bereft of Thee, O august Beauty ! Dropped cadences on the water mutter, And hush like fragrances in a deserted hall Where the last dancer closed the door. No more tonight does the candle gutter, And stain the ballroom floor. In the blue moon's sleep forgotten souls are gathered to the shore, Its prose melted in the rhythmic fall Of crescending light. Ended in dream the wasted dancer's plight. And yet I hesitate to sleep; For does not the revealing Goddess keep ##190 ROBERT ALDEN SANBORN The sanctity of pleasure And Artemis in her might Bestow the boon of Beauty on our fevered measure? In the blinding nakedness of silence Over Poseidon's floor, On this sea of failed emotion, Is there not more The freed spirit of the dance When spent is the last forlorn devotion? Grey prose of sand and shore Is to blue magic dedicated; And when, the fever of the quest abated, The body shakes its tattered clothes Upon the floor, Do we not pass from beauty simulated To the one Beauty that is more? ######MUSHROOMS A BOOK OF RHYTHMS BY ALFRED KREYMBORG READY EARLY IN APRIL PRICE $1.25 JOHN MARSHALL Publisher 331 Fourth Avenue NEW YORK The Subscription to OTHERS for one year is      $ 1.50 OTHERS is published monthly at 331 Fourth Avenue, New York.
