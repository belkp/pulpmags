youngest that alights and takes her white hand Princess come with me on the back of my steed away To Paris we shall go in a mansion we shall stay  As soon as they were come the hostess turns to her Oh tell me lovely maid give me the truth to hear Is it willing you have come and have you shed no tear  And maiden to the hostess Innocent am I From my father s castle away king s folk have ravished me They ve carried me to horse to this beautiful hostelry  She d finished with her plaint returned the man at arms Eat and drink my sweet with a goodly appetite Tis with a man at arms you ll pass a pleasant night  They are seated at the feast then dead the maiden falls Ring oh ring the bells let drum a dirge for her My mistress she is dead had come to her fifteenth year  182  Edward Sapir  Where shall we bury her this beautiful princess In the garden of her father under an apple tree With God in paradise we pray her spirit be  Three days she buried lay her father is passing by Open open the grave my father and rescue me I ve played the dead three days for the sake of purity  THE DUMB SHEPHERDESS  Hark ye to the complaint  Grown and little Of a dumb shepherdess Who in her fields  Did guard her little sheep Along the mead Twas Jesus out of goodness Made her speak  One day the holy Maid To her appeared Good day sweet shepherdess Big Isabeau And would you give to me One of the lambs  Ah no indeed she said They are not mine  183  POETRY A Magazine of Verse  To father to my mother I ll speak of it To father to my mother I ll tell of it  She came back to her home Straightaway My father there s a lady In my flock O God she asks of me One of the lambs  Her father mother too They were amazed To hear the speechless maiden Speaking thus To God they made a prayer Giving thanks  Go tell her shepherdess In thy flock That they are at her pleasure Big and little That all are for her pleasing Even the best  The shepherdess was dead Before three days  184  Edward Sapir  A letter she was holding In her hand Writ by the sovereign master Mighty God  Her father mother too They could not read It had to be the bishop  Came to them To speak to the dumb maid Big Isabeau  Open shepherdess Open thy hand For the sake of the sovereign master Mighty God And well he read the letter And understood  Whoever sings on Friday This complaint Is freed of sinful taint Gains Paradise  Translated by Edward Sapir  185  POETRY A Magazine of Verse  THE THREE CHILDREN  From the Old French  Once there were three small children Who went into the fields to glean They came at night to a butcher s house Butcher have you beds for us Come little children come in come in Assuredly there s room within  Hardly had they passed the wall  Than the butcher killed them all  He cut them up and put each bit  Like pork into the salting pit  Seven years later Saint Nicholas  He happened in that place to pass  Betook himself to the butchery  Butcher have you a bed for me  Come in come in Saint Nicholas There s room there is no lack of space Hardly had he entered there Than he asked for his supper  Is it a piece of ham you would I don t want any it isn t good Would you like a piece of veal I don t want any it doesn t look well  186  Albert Edmund Trombly  I d like to have some little meat That s seven years in the salting pit When the butcher heard this said He bolted from his door and fled  Butcher butcher don t run away God will forgive you if you pray Saint Nicholas did three fingers rub On the edge of the salting tub  The first child said I slept very well And so did I the second tells The third child spoke up in this wise I thought I was in Paradise  Translated by Albert Edmund Trombly  187  POETRY A Magazine of Verse  HERE FOR A TIME  With the lone hills of sheep Stone scarred and gray And the lone bleat With the brown old sleeping meres that meet The storm s sweep The sun s sway And the stars and all the seasons with unaltering face With the moor mists swifting As they have swifted Down the slow dayfall since the ancient days With the sound of the last curlew drifting As it has drifted To the nestward beat Of tired innumerable wings  With these most solitary things These pitilessly aloof In their harsh loneliness These pitifully weak Against the stress Of the eternal rebuff Here for a little span On their illimitable bleak Abides the warm memory Of man  188  Thomas Moult  Here for a time a breath of time he brings Faiths groping past the hills and visionings Faiths and visionings great and sure As the calm of the moor With feeble scratchings has he made his mark On the hill s steep For a day and a dark They endure By a dark they outlast his laughter and tears His song The feeble scratchings he has traced along By the hill s feet Fainter as they uplight to the farmost crest And the cloud veils Outliving by a dark The faiths and fears Of his breast And the visionings By these he has made his mark  With the lone hills of sheep Overspreading his eyes and on his ears The lone bleat He sinks into sleep Deep As the deep of dales Is his sleep More deep  189  POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Than the brown old sleep of meres that meet The storm s sweep The sun s sway And the stars and all the seasons with unaltering face  He dreams in his dream he passes not away He endures even as they These most solitary things These pitilessly aloof In their harsh loneliness These pitifully weak Against the stress Of the eternal rebuff The lone hills stone scarred and gray The storm s sweep The stars and the sun s sway The moor mists swifting As they have swifted Down the slow dayfall since the ancient days The sound of the last curlew drifting As it has drifted To the nestward beat of tired innumerable wings  Thomas Moult  190   THE MOUNTAIN WOMAN  Among the sullen peaks she stood at bay And paid life s hard account from her small store Knowing the code of mountain wives she bore The burden of the days without a sigh And sharp against the somber winter sky  I saw her drive her steers afield each day  Hers was the hand that sunk the furrows deep Across the rocky grudging southern slope At first youth left her face and later hope Yet through each mocking spring and barren fall She reared her lusty brood and gave them all That gladder wives and mothers love to keep  And when the sheriff shot her eldest son  Beside his still so well she knew her part  She gave no healing tears to ease her heart But took the blow upstanding with her eyes As drear and bitter as the winter skies  Seeing her then I thought that she had won  But yesterday her man returned too soon And found her tending with a reverent touch One scarlet bloom and having drunk too much He snatched its flame and quenched it in the dirt Then like a creature with a mortal hurt She fell and wept away the afternoon  DuBose Heyward  191  POETRY A Magazine of Verse  THREE SUMMER POEMS  THE SQUALL  It swoops gray winged across the obliterated hills And the startled lake seems to run before it From the wood comes a clamor of leaves Tugging at the twigs Pouring from the branches And suddenly the birds are silent  Thunder crumples the sky Lightning tears at it  And now the rain The rain thudding implacable The wind revelling in the confusion of great pines  And a silver sifting of light A coolness A sense of summer anger passing Of summer gentleness creeping nearer Penitent tearful Forgiven  TH E LOCUST  Your hot voice sizzles from some cool tree near by You seem to burn your way through the air Like a small pointed flame of sound Sharpened on the ecstatic edge of sun beams  192  Leonora Speyer  CRICKETS AT DAWN  All night the crickets chirp Like little stars of twinkling sound In the dark silence  They sparkle through the summer stillness With a crisp rhythm They lift the shadows on their tiny voices  But at the shining note of birds that wake Flashing from tree to tree till all the wood is lit O golden coloratura of dawn The cricket stars fade softly One by one Leonora Speyer  SWEETPEAS  All flowers in my garden Are free Except the wayward sweetpeas And they Out of love and gratitude Have forged tiny green chains And chained themselves To my lattice And to my heart  Margaret McKenny  193  POETRY A Magazine of Verse  ENVYINGS  I  When I am warmly bathed And rubbed a rosy red Cold creamed to sleek and sweet Brushed braided gone to bed With soft sheets cool And soft warm wool Gentle and kind like fur I wish that I could purr It seems a gracious thing to do Expressive exquisite Thank you Thrilling the body through and through  II  As one grows old And understands much folly Especially the joke of being wise And all things are revealed In humorous melancholy To seeing and discerning eyes There is desire to flap the wings  And toot A cynical and mocking bleak Hoot Hoot  194  Katherine Wisner McCluskey  III  X  I wish that I could murmur in my throat  With a rich gurgling deep contented note  Like the pigeon coo That yodling colorful tune Of burnished tone warmer than words can say  Might tell the way I feel when loved by you  A HEAT WAVE  All day a great sun stared Obsessed with heat and light Thought panted for shelter On to the dark of night But when the sun went down Soaked in the lukewarm sea I turned and saw a white hot moon Pallid peering at me And my soul cried aloud Mad for some privacy  Katherine Wisner McCluskey  195  POETRY A Magazine of Verse  TWO SONNETS  SUMMER  From what lost centuries that were sweet before Comes this long wave of Summer bursting white In shivered apple blossoms on the shore That is our homeland for a day and night A wide hushed spirit floats above the foam A sweetness that was ancient flower and face When wine red poppies stained the walls of Rome And daisies starred those summer fields of Thrace  Something survives and haunts the leafy shade  Some fragrance that was petals once and lips And whispered brief avowals that they made Borne hither now in vague invisible ships Whose weightless cargoes poured upon the air Are flowers forgot and faces that were fair  SYMBOLS  Beautiful words like butterflies blow by With what swift colors on their fragile wings Some that are less articulate than a sigh Some that were names of ancient lovely things What delicate careerings of escape When they would pass beyond the baffled reach To leave a haunting shadow and a shape Eluding still the careful traps of speech  196  David Morton  And I who watch and listen lie in wait Seeing the cloudy cavalcades blow past Happy if some bright vagrant soon or late May venture near the snares of sound at last Most fortunate captor if from time to time One may be taken trembling in a rhyme  David Morton  NIGHT ON THE RIVER  This is our world a dark stream murmuring Sly hordes of shadows out of every brake Sky fallen gold fish stars that float or shake  In mirrored nets these wizard maples fling  My oars that dip like some light swallow s wing Fire flies like sparks that the wind fans awake And moments like the bubbles that we make  Like the frail foam that marks our voyaging  Love let us drift what matter when or where Are not the stars the dusk the whispering stream Far whippoorwills our boat and we a dream  In some mad mind And do not all streams bear Themselves and all they hold to one vast sea The waste wan waters of Eternity  E Merrill Root  197  POETRY A Magazine of Verse  SUGARING  A man may think wild things under the moon In March when there is a tapping in the pails Hung breast high on the maples Though you sink To boot tops only in the uncrusted snow And feel last autumn s leaves a short foot down There will be one among the men you meet To say the snow lies six feet level there Not here you say and he says In the woods Implying woods that he knows where to find Well such a moon may be miraculous And if it has the power to make one man Believe a common February snow The great storm wonder he would talk about For years if once he saw it there may be In the same shimmering sickle over the hill Vision of other things for other men  The moon again Playing tonight with vapors that go up And out into the silver The brown sap works Its foamy bulk over the great log fire Colors of flame light up a man who kneels With sticks upon his arm and in his face A grimace of resistance to the glow All that is burning is not under here Boiling the early sap I wonder why  198  Raymond Holden  It is as calm as a dream of paradise Out there among the trees where runnels make The only music heard above the sway Of branches fingering the leaning moon And yet a man must go when the sap has thickened Up and away to sleep a tired sleep And dream of dripping from a rotting roof Back into sap that once was rid of him I wonder why I wonder why I wonder   Close the iron doors and let the fire die And the faint night wind blow through the broken walls The sugar thickens and the moon is gone And frost threads up the singing rivulets I am going up the mountain toward the stars But I should like to lie near earth tonight Earth that has borne the furious grip of winter And given a kind of birth to beauty at last Look the old breath thrills through her once again And there will be passion soon shaking her veins And driving her spirit upward till the buds Burst overhead and swallows find the eaves Of the sugar house untroubled by the talk Of men gone off with teams to mend the roads I think I shall throw myself down here in the snow So to be very near her when she stirs  Raymond Holden  199  POETRY A Magazine of Verse  POEMS BY A CHILD  I know how poems come They have wings When you are not thinking of it  I suddenly say  Mother a poem  Somehow I hear it  Rustling  Poems come like boats  With sails for wings Crossing the sky swiftly They slip under tall bridges Of cloud  MOON IN OCTOBER  The moon is at her crystal window Spinning and weaving The moon looks out of her window of crystal She has no lights excepting stars That hang on threads unknown From her sky ceiling her walls Their twinkling is like the twittering of many birds In the early morning The moon sits by her crystal window She sings to herself and spins Spins the pale blue silken thread  That holds earth dangling  Over deep light  Now this is what the moon sings  Spin spinning wheel  Day and night too  I keep it going all the time  To weave my robe of dew I make it from the fields of blue  And the robin s breast  The sun gives me ray9  From the yellow west  It shall be touched with evening  200  Hilda Conkling  And with mellowy dew And send a separate shining Down the sky to you My woven gown of sun rays My silken gown of blue  WISHES  I want three things They are wishes Bright and happy You cannot know my dreams The wishes that stay in my heart I want three things  Unknown to any one Tell me oh tell me What are the wishes In your heart  I cannot tell you It is a secret thing  MY MIND AND I  We are friends My mind and I Yet sometimes we cannot understand each other  As though a cloud had gone over the sun Or the pool all blind with trees Had forgotten the sky  LILACS  After lilacs come out The air loves to flow about them The way water in wood streams Flows and loves and wanders I think the wind has a sadness Lifting other leaves other sprays I think the wind is a little selfish About lilacs when they flower  20l  POETRY A Magazine of Verse  ORCHID LADY  Tan and green orchid Are you a little lady Holding up your skirts Above wet grass Do you wear a feather Where that white is showing Is there any color Shut inside your heart I could be an orchid I could be a lady I could wear a feather I could step like you There is just the difference Of your way of bowing And your tilted bonnet And your satin shoe  TO A BLACK PANSY  Little Prince Why do you stray about Like a firefly who has lost his lantern Why do you sob Small gypsy in the dark Do you think maybe the world Will end tonight  BARE BUTTER NUT TREE  A tree stands old and worn The North has blown away its leaves When I see it that way I wish Spring would return How can I wait so long O butter nut tree Why didn t God give you speech And you without your green leaves Why can t you sing small songs Against the wind For comfort  202  Hilda Conkling  LEAVES  In my apple orchard In the oldest tree Fall has hidden gold leaves  I looked into the hollow And saw no apples Only leaves with frost on them Like marble tilings Like jeweled tables  Yet there was no gold no marble   Only leaves covered with frost That sparkled the way my thought told me  RIVER  Something wanders among the mountains Something ripples along forget me not fields Something cries when birds go south Something curves its golden sand bar Like the handle of a purple sword If I speak strangely Do not wonder Something is looking for a castle Made of seaweed shells and coral Where the sea curls Under the sunrise  THE CELLAR  I love my queer cellar with its dusty smell  Its misty smell like smoke fringes  From clouds blowing past  With its shelves of jam and goodies  With its boxes barrels  Woodpiles here and there  There is a passageway  To an unknown room  Where bins hold carrots and things  There are glass doors that bang  And cobweb windows  I love the quietness of my cellar  203  POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Thinking in the dark  My cellar has apples in its breath  Potatoes even  That smell of earth  JAPANESE PICTURE  Trees on a marble island Birds with little brown backs  Is this Paradise  Mountain of my heart With pink and purple coloring Little houses on the river bank Houses made of maple sugar Distant tree Boats with blue sails Japanese people in silk Hidden in the brown sugar houses Yellow sky pearl colored ground River ripples like the ripples in silk Or a windy corn field Hills of pink opal And dewy seas  Did you answer my question  About Paradise  TO A MOTHER  To a mother with hazel eyes and brownish hair And fingers quick as stars That twinkle in night cold air  Hair wound like a web of lacy sea weed Blue robes floating like the spring wind The wind in a shadowy forest  When the sun shines on the dew My mother has a heart that loves me And sings like a music  Hilda Conkling nine years old  204  COMMENT  DR CHUBB ON THE PLATFORM  R PAUL SHOREY head professor of Greek at the University of Chicago doesn t like the new poetry in fact he has said so more than once in public places Wishing to know the worst I listened on May 15th to his lecture on Modern Poetry and the Teaching of English which was given at Fullerton Hall before an audience of Chicago teachers as one of the series endowed for their benefit by their late fellow educator Elizabeth Kirkland The lecture was not an extempore discourse but a paper carefully prepared and read because as the learned doctor explained he had something to say and wished to take no chances of inexactness in saying it  I went prepared to take notes alas that I didn t requisition a stenographer Dr Shorey began with harmless generalities quoted Poe s Poetic Principle told us poetry was a soil kindling art not a soul anodyne presented the advantage that classic poetry associations give to the Taormina view over that of San Francisco equally beautiful though the latter is discussed the illusion and delusion of science and deplored the general American way of abandoning the arts at maturity with other follies of youth insisted upon training in reading poetry aloud in poetic diction and in mythology as necessities neglected by modern educators etc etc  At last the lecturer got down to brass tacks or as he  205  1  POETRY A Magazine of Verse  jocularly expressed it began to show the cloven hoof with some criticism of Whitman the first offender because he advised American poets to make no mention or allusion to or of the past Incidentally we were reminded that Whitman was much indebted to Emerson tor his Leaves And the next minute the athletic classicist was hitting out from the shoulder at the self advertising and self quoting modernists whose Germanized attitude of mind is being imposed on us all  This nefarious Germanized attitude of mind seemed to consist in the doctrine of simplicity preached by the heralds of the new poetry a new and luminous interpretation of the Hun s psychology And Riley Oppenheim and Sandburg were quaintly lassoed together in a series of charges too subtly surprising for my slow pencil and astonished intellect to catch up with  When I came to again the lecturer was saying The new poetry lacks morality harmony distinction and idea of beauty Students who read it are doomed as is proved by the heart sickening shallowness and vulgarity of soul shamelessly exhibited in the poems published in college magazines The imitator of Carl Sandburg is blighted forever and here there were further remarks about C S which my agitated pencil failed to catch The lecturer continued at some length on the failure of the moral sense in the new poetry indeed the new poetry preaches immorality and he proved it by reading Oppenheim s only one god you poem which however he partly excused as  206  Dr Chubb on the Platform  being really a paraphrase of Emerson Poor Emerson s mantle was stretched to cover a multitude of sins Gio vanitti also was invoked to prove that this modern Russianized not Prussian this time literature considers man only an animal  By this time the phrases of anathema were falling so thick and fast that none but a stenographer could capture them so I leaned back with the happy thought of borrowing Dr Shorey s manuscript in order to avoid inexactness Miss Lowell was now under arraignment and by way of emphasizing her special treachery the lecturer read an original poem which purported to express James Russell Lowell s opinion of his recalcitrant cousin  The peroration which soon got well under way was a warning against the crimes and offences of the new poetry its sins against taste law morals beauty intelligence etc its wicked digressions from the straight and narrow path of academic tradition Of all these outrageous derelictions Carl Sandburg was pointed to as the chief exemplar Having no memory for phrases I cannot set down the burning words that exploded over his devoted head a withering blast which would have seared his eye balls if he had been there to hear  Throughout the lecture I listened in vain for any discrimination between grades of good or bad in the new poetry for any recognition of differences in the motives and methods whether technical or ethical of the numerous very individual men and women who practice it for any ac  207  POETRY A Magazine of Verse  knowledgment of qualities of possible beauty in any of its experiments in rhythms and other sound values or of possible dignity and truth in any of its interpretations of life No the poets were lashed together with one tarred rope and lowered from Ezra Pound to Oppenheim into the nether abyss  When I asked to borrow the paper Dr Shorey declined saying that he had no copy and intended to give the lecture elsewhere As I turned to go two of the audience were pleading for his Lowell poem and I heard him call Here is Miss Monroe I challenge her to print it in POETRY At once and most eagerly I accepted the challenge hoping to make it the climax of this article  But the ladies who heard this challenge and my promise and our readers as well are doomed to disappointment for the next day instead of the poem the following letter arrived  Dear Miss Monroe On reflection I think it would be a mistake to publish my squib and so do not send it to you It was not intended as an argument and was not so taken by the audience It merely served as a part of the comic relief that is almost indispensable to break the monotony of an hour of lecturing I cannot of course object if you wish to take my lecture as the text of an editorial But the lecture was not written for publication in its present form and I don t think that you ought to use quotation marks unless you are quite sure that you caught my very words I also hope that you will not attribute to me blank denial of the theory or entire insensibility to the occasional successes of the so called new poetry That is not in fact my position My main protest was against what I believe to be the practical effect of recent over estimates of it namely the destruction of the taste and capacity in young readers and students for the appreciation of the older heritage which I naturally value more Paul Shorey  208  Dr Chubb on the Platform  If Dr Shorey s lecture expressed anything other than this blank denial and insensibility he is at liberty to prove it from his manuscript Beyond a deprecatory and indefinite phrase or two I remember no such reservations And I assure my readers that such quotations as I have used are exact  The arraignment was perhaps too absurd in its sweeping denunciations to be worthy of notice Except for the following facts  First Dr Shorey is one of the foremost Greek scholars of our time and an educator of high distinction and authority  Second He was addressing an audience of teachers a sympathetic audience apparently who receiving his remarks as from Mount Sinai will be fortified in their opposition to all modern expression in poetry  Third The kind of talk of which this lecture is an extreme and almost ridiculous example is only too common in our schools and colleges As The New Republic says  The truth is to American professors good literature is literature safely dead and good taste is protective coloration Our schools began timid they continued timid and they remain timid  The fight is against heavy odds and strong intrenchments but it must be carried on this fight for the creative imagination of our youth for the vitality and integrity of the arts in our schools Dr Shorey s argument has been met point by point in so many of POETRY S editorials that we do not need to discuss it further But we might parenthet  209  POETRY A Magazine of Verse  ically ask him two or three questions for example If the new poetry is immoral what about the morality of the old poetry of Greek poetry for instance  If Taormina gets an added value because of the rich words of so many poets how is San Francisco ever to catch up with it unless the poets separate themselves from Taormina and get busy with San Francisco  Is the virginal freshness of a country not yet written over or built on or drawn on a conceivable excellence as a subject for art a conceivable stimulus to a creative and imaginative mind Might it not conceivably have a superior value to such a mind over the now much poetized regions which were virginal and uncelebrated to Homer and Aeschylus  If the imitator of Carl Sandburg is blighted forever is the imitator of Tennyson or Theocritus or Sappho in any happier case But between you and me aren t students imitations whether of Sandburg Riley or the Book of Job mere harmless exercises rather than a blight forever  But we weary of Dr Shorey The secret is out he must be that righteous fellow citizen and guardian of public morals Elmer Chubb LL D Ph D who has been enlightening the world of late through Reedy s Mirror H M  NOTE ON FRENCH CANADIAN FOLK SONGS  It is doubtful if the old treasury of French folk lore is anywhere so well preserved as in the Province of Quebec  210  Note on French Canadian Folk songs  The great currents of modern civilization have until recent days left practically unaffected this colony of old France where the folk still observe customs use implements recite tales and sing songs that take us right back to the sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries Indeed many of the songs may be shown by their wide diffusion on the continent of Europe or by internal evidence to go back to a much greater antiquity than that Some of them have a definitely mediaeval cast Mr C M Barbeau who has gone exhaustively into all aspects of French Canadian folk research and has within the last few years made himself incomparably its greatest authority finds that fully ninety five per cent of the four thousand songs and song versions that he and his collaborators have gathered are clearly of old world origin Relatively little in the way of folk literature originated in  Canada  This vast mass of folk song material and it is being constantly added to has been recorded both in text form and for the most part on the phonograph Many transcriptions have already been made by Mr Barbeau himself some of which have appeared with full texts in a recent number of the Journal of American Folk lore More are to follow from time to time  No one who cares to acquaint himself even superficially with these folk songs can doubt their historic and aesthetic value The music without which they can hardly be adequately understood or appreciated itself constitutes an illuminating chapter in the European history of the art  211  POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Modes and rhythms but scantily recognized in the straight highroad of art music here flourish luxuriantly The songs have been collected from all parts of the province from the remote fisherman of Gaspé the little farming villages along the St Lawrence the French sections of Montreal They embrace a bewildering variety of metrical forms and of functional types Some of these types are drinking songs lyrical and narrative love songs pastoral songs the maumariés of unhappy married couples the cocus jocular songs of deceived husbands round dances and other types of dance songs satires not infrequently on religious themes festival songs working songs of strongly marked rhythm fuller s paddling marching and others little vaudevilles or duets for two singers ballads complaintes or complaints a more solemn or tragic type of ballad but the term is employed rather loosely randonnées or rigmaroles cradle songs shanty songs  Readers of the four folk songs included in this number of POETRY will probably welcome a few specific indications which I owe to Mr Barbeau The Dumb Shepherdess is a religious complainte and is known in the lower St Lawrence region both north and south shores The King of Spain s Daughter is a work ballad especially used as a paddling song and is based on versions from Temiscouata and Gaspé counties The Prince of Orange is another paddling song collected at Tadousac one of the oldest French settlements in Canada on the lower St Lawrence White as the Snow is a good example of the genuine ballad it is  212  Note on French Canadian Folk songs  one of the best known folk songs of Quebec having been recorded in no less than twelve versions All of these songs have old country analogues White as the Snow and The King of Spain s Daughter have an especially wide diffusion in France The Dumb Shepherdess is probably the oldest of the group it is not unlikely that the French text as recorded in Canada goes back to the fifteenth century The Prince of Orange of course of much later date is one of a category of well known French songs that mock the House of Orange  In the English versions of which these are a selection I have adhered as closely to the original rhythms and stanzaic structure as the prosodic differences of the two languages would permit Pedantic literalness was not always possible yet there are no serious deviations least of all from the spirit of the songs as I have conceived it Not all the originals it may be noted make use of strict rhymes assonances are often used instead In The Dumb Shepherdess I preferred to do without rhyme aside from the very end of the poem so fearful was I of spoiling its peculiar charm Edward Sapir  REVIEWS  A BOOK FOR LITERARY PHILOSOPHERS  Quia Pauper Amavi by Ezra Pound The Egoist London There is no modern poet more difficult to criticize justly than Ezra Pound Those who have suffered from his sharp  213  POETRY A Magazine of Verse  wit and idiosyncrasies are prejudiced against him those who have enjoyed the privilege of a real intimacy with him who know his genuine goodness and profound love of literature are more than prejudiced in his favor those who do not know him at all are over willing to listen to his enemies to whom unhappily he has given only too many opportunities for calumny He is like a man who goes hunting hedgehogs with bare feet and finds his prey all prickles to vary and mix the metaphor he sits on his little hill in Kensington as if it were Olympus casting forth winged words which like boomerangs are returned unto him an hundredfold In the mêlée his work is disloyally attacked his least errors are exposed with a malignant triumph his sensitiveness which hides under a cover of bluster is denounced as conceit his fineness of perception is misunderstood as triviality His scholarship with its rather overwhelming pretention is suspect his polemics verge on hysteria His fault is that he is an anachronism With the enthusiasm of a Renaissance scholar one of those whose fine devotion but faulty learning revealed to the fifteenth century world the civilization of Greece he lives in an age which looks at literature as a hobby a freak a branch of education but never as a life study a burning passion His profound error is to love literature above everything in an age of commerce to prize his art beyond reputation friends money tranquillity It is hard to be uncompromising even if one is right it is doubly hard when one is frequently wrong  Ezra Pound s poetry is American in that it is versatile  214  A Book for Literary Philosophers  superficial generous It is European in that it is literary subtle full of delicate nuances elliptic It is more French than English It is almost a new genre the poetry of esthetic nuance His flair for good literature is incredibly keen considering his philological deficiencies From his multitudinous and brief admirations he has evolved a poetry of his own derived in every case from some earlier writer but so altered so stamped with his own personality that he has made it something new He fails most when he tries to be modern in subject as well as in manner he is happiest when interpreting his own emotions in the mask of a  dead poet  Quia Pauper Amavi is a book for literary philosophers  for those who appreciate the odor of the past carefully en  closed in new hybrid flowers for those who are not repelled  by involved and unnecessarily crabbed diction and who will  look for what is good in a book not for what is bad  Langue d Oc the first section is Provençal gives us the  feeling that no other interpreter has ever given that what  was written in Provence was poetry Descant on a Theme  by Cerclamon has some fine lines particularly those be  ginning Good is it to me if she flout down to The man  whom love had and has ever  Three Cantos the third section which POETRY printed in  1917 is perhaps the most important work in the book an  essay in the manner of Sordello The writing is so elliptic  the thought so carefully hidden that I cannot imagine what  the poem is about but it has delightful lines  215  POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Ghosts move about me patched with histories  See the small cobbles flare with poppy spoil  Home to sweet rest and to the waves deep laughter  Spirits Not dark and shadow wet ghosts but ancient living Wood white smooth as the inner bark and firm of aspect  clothed like the poppies wearing golden greaves Light in the air  Silk tatters still in the frame Gonzaga s splendor Where do we come upon the ancient people  The goddess Light in the foam breathed on by Zephyrs And air tending hours mirthful with golden Girdles and breast bands thou with dark eyelids Bearing the golden bough of Argicida  Any of those lines would give another man an enviable reputation because the writer is Ezra Pound they are wilfully ignored Longer passages of Three Cantos which I find beautiful are the description of Sirmio Canto I the lines on Catullus those on Camoens and the Japanese women Canto 11 the paraphrase of the Renaissance Homer Canto III a subject which is thrilling to the lover of old literature  I shall leave Propertius alone not because I do not like it but because I want several pages to talk about it The reader must look upon it not as a translation but as an inspired paraphrase a mistranslation of genius where lines and paragraphs of extraordinary beauty are embedded in others of doubtful value R A  216  A New Light on Lancelot  A NEW LIGHT ON LANCELOT  Lancelot by Edwin Arlington Robinson Thomas Seltzer  New York  The chief distinction of Edwin Arlington Robinson chief that is among the many astonishments of his genius is his mingling of two strains a Puritan austerity and a discerning tenderness He was ever one to see a light behind the stars and yet he is too keen a psychologist to measure men s worth by the distances between their intuitions and his own lucid vision  An avowed traditionalist it is perhaps natural that at a time when men grope for refuge from a broken world Robinson should find his in a retreat to the dim Arthurian fields But it is equally characteristic that his retreat has in it no shadow of surrender Rather he recreates the disillusion the desolation and the pain of our own period in the tragedy of this half forgotten legend Lancelot is finer than Merlin by as much as it is closer to Robinson For what he has done in this latest work is to dramatize the griefs of Guenevere and of Arthur of Gawain and of Lancelot in such a way as to make them our contemporaries and with such a fervor of insight as to body forth the very breathings and heartbeats the very fire and dolorous rains of an age wherein men wronged each other and helplessly hurt each other in ways no different from our own Throughout the poem shines undimmed the light that burned for the poet before he touched the story of the Grail and therewith the old divining pity  217  POETRY A Magazine of Verse  So one hears Guenevere Knowing the world you know How surely and indifferently that Light Shall burn through many a war that is to be To which this war were no more than a smear On circumstance And later Lancelot The Vision shattered a man s love of living Becomes at last a trap and a sad habit The reiterated chord of bitterness reverberates in the lines There was a madness feeding on us all As we fed on the world When the world sees The world will have in turn another madness And so as I ve a glimpse ad infinitum What strikes one most forcibly perhaps is indeed the sharpness of the poem s reality This is largely due to the strength of the dialogue Guenevere was not the first nor will she be the last woman to cry out If I were strong enough to make you vanish And have you back again with yesterday There is also the eternal magic whereby Robinson s unique images gleam out of the sterner structure of the poem as saints might gleam out of the simple aspiring architraves of some noble cathedral So he speaks of The fading out of his three visitors Into the cold and swallowing wall of storm So he shows Joyous Gard as A shaken hive of legend heavy wonder So Lancelot asks Would you cajole Your reason with a weary picturing  218  A New Light on Lancelot  On walls or on vain air of what your fancy Like firelight makes of nothing but itself The piercing imagery of the leave taking is typical as it is arresting  He crushed her cold white hands and saw them falling  Away from him like flowers into a grave  It is idle praise to crown a poet with premature immortality But it is certain that any contemporary would be proud to have made this poem and it is written that none but Edwin Arlington Robinson could have endued this ancient theme with so passionate a warmth and so kindling a light Babette Deutsch  COMEDY OVER TRAGEDY  A Woman of Thirty by Marjorie Allen Seiffert Alfred  A Knopf  Marjorie Allen Seiffert has more than a bowing acquaintance with the comedy spirit and if for no other reason may be safely considered by the hypothetical third person of criticism an acquisition to the new poetry One poises the claim a little apologetically for one still has to excuse the intrusion more than once of comedy into what most of us still consider a solemn sacrosanct demesne And yet a goodly percentage of the better contributions of the men and women who have put America on the art map has come from the mask of drollery to the full face of laughter in the shapes and sounds of poems by Messrs Sandburg Lindsay Frost Pound Williams Johns Eliot and Stevens  219  POETRY A Magazine of Verse  and of Mesdames Moore D Orge Tietjens and Millay the list is not restricted Obviously we think as well as feel not alone by way of dragging in Horace Walpole s He who feels sees life a tragedy he who thinks a comedy but because there are inevitable moments when we are complete beings when comedy acts as an impersonal commentary aloof and perhaps superior to the intense and personal tragedy of the solitary Comedy is the touch which leads tragedy into contact with the world and sets off the personal against the background of the impersonal And so Mr Elijah Hay Mrs Seiffert s contribution to the Spectric Hoax and The Old Woman her morality comedy which was awarded a POETRY prize are refreshing events By asking for more of these one doesn t necessarily ask for less of her efforts in minor keys  One suspects that effort had to force the production of a considerable number of her more serious poems while the less serious created themselves Carrying this hypothesis to the various laboratories of ismism one postulates further that the serious poems fall under categories and conventions whether of so called traditional or so called modern versification Many of the free poems are an avowal of the poetic gospel according to the denomination of imagism In such formalism has been adhered to form has not evolved A method which was natural to H D becomes a disguise with Mrs Seiffert In her imagistic studies the latter is only an expert craftsman whereas as Elijah Hay and in The Old Woman and her Japanese and Italian De  220  Comedy over Tragedy  signs she has discarded tools fashioned by others She has been compelled to do so because the moods which actuated these poems were stronger than she Poetry has been forced on her she has not sought it These things wrote her she didn t write them The sensitive eye and ear which she brought to the expression of lyrics in the older or the newer formalism they are admirable they are necessary to the service of apprenticeship  Fortunately however for the poet and poetry mere training is a matter of the past Fortunately too criticism is the most erratic instrument in the cosmos Having ventured a certain dictum of a negative character one is caught unawares in an admiration for lines and poems which as a theorist and a consistent human mechanism one should not admire Having accused Mrs Seiffert of a frequent devotion at the shrine of imagism having committed oneself to what one swears to as truth speaking one is led astray by some of the imagistic poems and is forced to confess himself a liar and to consign himself his efforts at criticism and all critics and criticism to the busiest devil in the Christian curriculum One knows one shouldn t like what one has definitely decried and yet one betrays oneself to ridicule by more than liking some of the imagistic sequences in which certain adventures are housed in simple dramatic lyrics of a poignant and musical quality One refers to A Temple Portrait of a Lady in Bed Mountain Trails White Valley The Pathway of Black Leaves and Sequence Comedy over tragedy form over formalism individuality over ismism this  221  POETRY A Magazine of Verse  way or that way truth vendor or prevaricator one is forced to doff one s conceit to Grey grasses drown In thin brown water Wound like a chain on the valley s Sunken breast As a theorist one looks askance but as a person with ambitions as a poet one blinks with sly envy on The peaks even today show finger prints Where God last touched the earth Before he set it joyously in space Finding it good  Being as perverse as all other human folk one yearns for perfection in oneself to the exclusion of course of all other fellow creatures and in approaching these latter from the negative angle one hopes that they betray one s own faults says they do so states the case as a critic and then unconsciously finding these faults closely related to one s own admires them and enters the ideal domain of consistency One awakes slaps oneself on the back shouts gleefully Why Mrs Seiffert is a poet And so she is A K  TWO CHILD POETS  Poems by a Little Girl by Hilda Conkling Fred A Stokes Co  White Silences by Katherine Bull The Touchstone Publishing Co New York It is an extraordinary coincidence that two child poets of  this quality should have been alive on earth at the same  222  Two Child poets  moment and should be presented between bookcovers in the same year One is compelled to review them together because they offer with equally amazing expressiveness such a contrast of temperaments because one is the normal happy child raised to the n th power of imaginative sensibility while the other is the super normal child raised to the n th power of spiritual insight The younger of the two Hilda who is not yet ten years old may hope to fulfil and complete her genius through all the rich experience of a woman s life The elder Katherine lived too intensely too sublimely for mortal flesh to endure the strain so at fifteen she slipped away with no struggle no anticipation just a sudden  flitting like a bird let out of its cage  Our readers have marvelled at Hilda Conkling every July since 1916 when she made her bow to the world with eight four and five year old songs of which the first was  Rosy plum tree think of me When Spring comes down the world And the present number carries a sheaf of her latest poems written since her book went through the press poems more mature but no less sincere and spontaneous perhaps no less beautiful than that first shining drop of dew This yearly appearance in extenso says more for the editor s opinion than any praise of the wonder child can say today yet a few words should be said perhaps to emphasize phases of the miracle even though Miss Lowell s admirable preface gives exactly the right emphasis to most of these phases and their implications  223  POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Mrs Conkling has been accused of inducing or influencing her daughter s poems as she writes them down The sufficient answer is their adorable childishness Who but a child would think  And fireflies are counting the leaves Or of a Little Snail He wagged his head this way that way Like a clown in a circus And this The world turns softly Not to spill its lakes and rivers And this poem Weather Weather is the answer When I can t go out into flowery places Weather is my wonder About the kind of morning Hidden behind the hills of sky  Et cetera one might quote many more But the reader should go instead to the book to be convinced that these exhalations of the eternal child spirit are really as Miss Lowell says the stuff and essence of poetry done in subtle cadences which are a delight to those who can hear them  We may well inquire how far Hilda is typical how much of the natural poetry of childhood in her case so happily expressed is usually lost or destroyed No nurse maid would have encouraged a child to tell these poems and few mothers would have been wise enough to refrain from instruction or emendation in writing them down In other words few children are permitted to be freely and spontaneously expressive in any of the arts false education ridi  224  Two Child poets  cule and other impositions of laws and precepts tend to suppress the natural childish impulses toward the creation of beauty Are there mute inglorious Hildas hidden behind apron strings and text books  Katherine Bull had a more solitary and searching mind Less observant of the actual than Hilda she was a rapt diviner of spiritual beauty she had strength of wing for icy heights She was not so sure a craftsman as Hilda her rhythms are less individual and there are fewer flashing phrases though now and then a singularly poignant one clutches the heart as when she says of the song sparrow  I heard you little soul singer In the sweet pause of the rising morning you wounded me to life  No the art of these poems may not be always adequate  indeed sometimes it may fail utterly and give us a homily  instead of a poem as in If You have Saved a Friend s Life  but the amazing thing is that living so precociously in a  white flame of spiritual passion she should have made art  serve her often so well express so keenly the inexpressible  beauty and ardor of her struggle Sometimes indeed the  art is almost adequate to carry the revelation in certain  brief poems like Silences Song Sparrow A Tiny Red Spider  White Mirrors and occasionally in a longer one such as  Heat which burns through a headlong series of exclamatory  notes like flames notes of white sun heat black languid  heat fever death glare of great walls the deep city  gone mad with a terrible mania up to the following climax  of rapture  225  POETRY A Magazine of Verse  O wonderful world heat Heat of the universe and all that is Drawn out from the center of things by Unknown Power Whom do I worship but thee Where a God an All supreme save thee  Mad essence of all and source in the eyes of the world destroy  ing and beyond eyes creating Scorch thou my body if need be consume it in flame For I will dissolve my identity in pain world pain heat  pain And glory in a new creation In another hour of mystical exaltation the rapt child  achieved this poem as exalted as a Saint Teresa rhapsody  I accept you whoever whatever you are it makes no difference  I go with you on endless journeys  I pass with you through endless dyings  I accept you simply and naturally  And I believe you utterly  I cannot lose you whoever whatever you are it makes no dif  ference  Perhaps you go we must all go but inevitably you must return  And you cannot but stay with me forever  I do not desire you  I am not anxious lest you should not come to me  And behold through the ages thou art running wings spread  as eagles  And casting away all arms I have caught thee in eternal em  brace  I do not fear you I am not anxious lest you should come to me And behold Thou my deliverer running with heart outspread I know thee and Thou art my God  Perhaps enough has been said and quoted to show the quality of this flaming spirit which burned itself out in a dozen or so brief years of worship to show also how far  226  Two Child poets  she was able to draw the curtain from before her vision of infinite beauty and so reveal it to the world The brief dialogue Death is a tremendous reach for a child s hand and soul a veritable cup of trembling uplifted to the Infinite that called her No wonder that they found when she died as her mother so exquisitely says She was one for whom you could not mourn  Two children like Hilda and Katherine singing in the same tongue at the same hour is there in this miracle a richer promise for the new age than may be read in treaties and decrees H M  CORRESPONDENCE  WORDS FROM A DEPARTING POET  To the Editor The May issue of POETRY contained the message of a poet on his way to California Perhaps POETRY may care to follow this message with the more serious words of a poet about to leave for England  I confess a certain measure of envy for Mr Kreymborg s tenacious optimism and persistent whimsicalities Sometimes if you brightly tell your potential audience how pleasantly accommodating it is its heart becomes deeply flattered and murmurs Listen to this nice chap praising our attention and good will It would really be a shame to disappoint him I do not charge Mr Kreymborg with having used this trick but I hope that he did Otherwise his words become a mere contented effervescence  227  POETRY A Magazine of Verse  The poetic boom in this country has always reminded me of a floridly persuasive circus barker shouting or crooning to passers by but now and then wearily turning his back to look at the empty seats showing through the circus entrance Poets lecture to colleges and clubs publish hosts of books hold controversies in magazines and newspapers attend large poetry banquets and are even commented upon by clergymen and village newspapers But inside of the tent has the nation s appreciation of poetry increased more than an inch The layman does not usually know that almost a majority of poets in America must pay the expenses of their books while the publisher merely loans the imprint of his firm There has also been no noticeable heightening of poetry s role in American magazines it still disconsolately squeezes into the tiny space left at the bottom of articles and short stories while long poems are almost always rejected In addition American poets praised from Delaware to Santa Barbara still find that their limelight does not blend into the attainment of a morning s breakfast their loudly proclaimed books sell to the tune of two or three paltry thousand Sometimes in spite of a storm of discriminating praise they even fail to sell out their first editions  The well known painter secures hundreds often thousands of dollars for his painting but the equally recognized poet is lucky if he receives twenty or thirty dollars for his long poem An age old injustice Yes but one that is still on ill terms with the great interest in poetry that one  228  Words from a Departing Poet  hears forever mentioned in this country If poetry could be hung on walls and viewed by admiring visitors or loaned to art exhibits as paintings are its benefactors would be more numerous and a curious American passion for advertised possession would respond But the poet s small black lines delivered to anyone over a counter or by the mailman do not merge into America s love of the large the concrete the exclusively owned and the ostentatious Between blares of announcing trumpets handfuls of pennies are thrown to this poet and that and everybody smiles as though a great task had been substantially commenced  These are only a few of the reasons why Ezra Pound  T S Eliot John Gould Fletcher H D and others migrated to England In England at least they make few grandiloquent pretences They do not seek the comforting phantoms of great audiences and huge rewards they are content to create with inward rather than outward compensations Radical poets and critics in England know that poetry at its best outside of the folk song will never be appreciated by more than a tiny fraction of the population until the millenium arrives Carl Sandburg writes sweep ingly vividly simply and understandingly about the average person and common longings but how many average inhabitants of this country read him His book sales like those of any other American or English poet tell an irrefutable story Maxwell Bodenheim  POETRY A Magazine of Verse  MR JOHNS RISES TO PROTEST  Dear Miss Monroe The charge of imitation is much easier to make than to refute and perhaps an attempt at refutation is not only useless but may indicate guilt itself I take the chance and make the attempt with reference to Marion Strobel s otherwise appreciative and generous review of Black Branches She says of one section in the book Hedone that the pieces are imitative of T S Eliot  The facts about Hedone are these  I They were written before I saw a rhymed quatrain by  T S Eliot I have been familiar with his work for years but not with his rhymed quatrains until recently  II The first that I ever saw were published I believe a little over a year ago in the Little Review But at that time I was just finishing the series called Hedone which had been in course of composition for six months  The whole subject may be nothing to write home about as the sales girl said but a charge of conscious imitation is no joke it rankles most intolerably in the mind of the pure and innocent object and as the charge has twice appeared in print I hereby have my say about it for once If the reader will but consider for a moment he will see of course that the spirit and purpose sustained throughout in my Hedone series could not possibly be the result of imitation That sort of thing might occur in the case of a few lines or a single idea but so distinct an experiment would have to spring from its own root and energy Orrick Johns  230  A Keats Memorial  A KEATS MEMORIAL  The following letter from a representative committee in England is forwarded to POETRY by Miss Amy Lowell who urges upon American lovers of Keats liberal support of a project which should appeal to all who speak the English language  On the eve of the centenary of the death of Keats the house near Hampstead Heath in which he resided during the most active portion of his literary career is about to be thrown into the property market as an eligible building site and a representative committee has been formed with the object of saving this great literary shrine from destruction and of securing it for the benefit of the public in perpetuity  The house now called Lawn Bank but originally known as Wentworth Place situate in Keats Grove Hampstead is that to which the poet came in December 1818 and which was his home during the remainder of his life in England Within its walls or under the shelter of the venerable trees which still grace its extensive old world garden much of his finest work was produced  An exclusive right to purchase the property has been established for a short period to afford an opportunity of procuring the necessary funds It is estimated that for the acquisition of the freehold for restoration and repairs for adaptation as a Keats Memorial House and for permanent maintenance a sum not less than ten thousand pounds will be required  At the Hempstead Public Library is deposited the important Dilke collection of Keats relics It is confidently anticipated that these will be available for the Memorial House and that valua  ble additions will be made from time to time  A prominent Chicago poet heads the western list of con  tributors with a check for ten dollars We feel that poets  will be especially interested and that many of our other  subscribers will wish to contribute according to their means  to this permanent memorial of a great poet whose fame  231  POETRY A Magazine of Verse  reached out to the four corners of the earth from that little house in Hampstead Checks may be sent to POETRY or to Miss Amy Lowell Brookline Mass
