with an Idiot 4SPRING SONGNIGHT on the FIELDS THE low reaches of sand and gray clay vanish in mist and distance on every sideand they are piled to the clouds with silence that seems continually disturbed by long rumbling echoesBeyond the sands lie shallow watersOnce it was bright day on the sandsIt was a day just after winter when a weak new life is discovered in the worldand is being anointedfondledand fosteredIn winter these plains shrink downcontractand hardenthey become imbued through and through with filthbut in the beginning of spring they seem to be seized roughly and washed as if they must either be washed clean or be destroyedthey are washed so that everything is left palewitheredand weakand there seems to be no color except wrung white and grayIf left to dryit seemsall objects and substances would become in a moment thin gray and white film and be blown awayWhen the cold comes at night there is a slight dryingand then the sandclayand pebbles are bleacheddrainedand smoothedthey become whiteand everything is sadBut there is seldom a long dryingAfter the washinsteadthe whole earth is floodedas a burn with oilwith new soft clear watermoving or stilland earth and sky together are flooded with new cold air that moves in soft glassy windsflooded too with a pale strange sunlightOut of this flooding with waterairand lightthe young new disgusting life is begunand by the soft cold wateramid the shining ice and gilded snowand by the light and the windthis life is nurtured and sustainedThis dayI mentionwas soft and lightand the wind was blowingit was a bright dayIt was springtimevastgentleand coldOne examined the pale wild skylighted by that mild pervasive busy light of springtimethe old used dirty sky now virgin and uncontaminate againwith its mild colorsits blue and yellowand with a little of the pink of springtime in the depth of the silvery hazeblue and yellow overheadmilky tan in the eastwhere stood two small cloudsnarrow and indistinctof 5 palest roseIn the westwhere the sun stoodwere large white clouds of indefinite shapemore like illuminated mist than cloudsclouds tall enough however to cover the sun and so to be lighted through like all else aroundyet not too dazzlinglythough one could not look at themThe western cloudsand the whole sky besideswere stilldespite the large cold wind that blew steadily across the earthpressing its glassy breast to the left cheek of one walking northward and fingering that cheek and keeping it coldtouching the whole of that side of the body and keeping it different from the rightAnd it was as if the rolling active light could be felt upon the body besides the windthe wind that made a constant confusing noise in the earIf one went westward out from the town toward certain places where there were fields and hollows of bare mudthe wind made a noise in both earsBut the skythough stillseemed just free of being wantonly and riotously stirred and tumbledfiercely drivena tumult which it lovedAnd the mild light filling all spacemade visible and startling what was far offlong distances were to the end as clear and as full of softly shining light as spaces close bylight faintly gilded the washed and freshened white snowand made objects that were opaque glow warm and beautifulwalls and walks of gray tan stone within the scattered townold dampened brick masonry that had been painted red glowed in the lightas did the rotting wooden work about itwhich was often painted greenOne saw far off the fine gray treesAnd in one dark place near dim shaded shops with open doors that asked one to come peering and searching inthe misty light came through and over a high gray hoardingcame through its slits in raysMuch snow still lay about within the townespecially where it had been plowed from the shiny trams of the streets and windrowed in the guttersor scraped from the slanted footwalks and piled asideThis snowsoft and shining now within its hollows had upon it a lace of threads of adhesive ice left after some melting and sinking downin many places the threads were darkened by fine black filthbut in otherswhere the snow was especially freshened and was purely whitethey were of undimmed crystalIn one short dark court closed in by houses 6 and protected by treesonly a few wagon wheels had cut the snowand it remained almost as thick as it had ever beenbut it was grayish and wet even thereand the intersecting wheel ruts were full of waterElsewhere the snow was white and shiningBut most gladdening of all was the water which fell from every steaming eave and gable of every light or dark drabpainted square thin walled wooden housedown upon the wooden steps or walks beneathin heavy every renewed showersin rows of drops like closely woven rattling curtainsLarge and roundthe dropswith their points turned up as those of small silvery glass onions would have beenfell in a hail and beat the wet boards with a fierce pattering and threw up and kept in the air a crystal spray all along the boardsThese were showers which swelled the waters that lay off in the fields and everywherethe new waters of spring in wide sheetssubmerging the earth and soaking deep into iteven into that beneath the houses and the poor thin pavementsThe waters that came down from the low mounds about the houses moved over the walks in decimeter widths and formed at the lower edges broad still wedge shaped poolsdeeper at the outsidepools of clear brown water whereinwhen one looked downhe saw in dainty black pictures of the trees with their bare interlacing branchesthe housesand all the crooked wooden poles with wires strung to their yardsThen the waters poured themselves into the brimming guttersin which stood the white shining snowOut through the fields there were some wide sunken passages containing streets paved and walledone with a willow tree above it on a railway embankmentand down the broad brown pavements of these streetsover the pale brown stonesgracefully and inaudibly flowed a wide deep floodAnd the water flowed so pleasantlyAnd none was ever like itthe waters of winter and of summer were not like itso gayrefreshingclearand brightstanding over the earth to warm itor moving fast and merrily onwardas if with a purpose or in fulfillment of a promise that made it joyfulOff in the wet fieldswhere the great joined jagged edged pools laythe sunlight struck the water and made itout to lefta dazzling cream color and silverbut out to rightover the flat 7 fells of sodthe sunlight gave the water the soft blue of the skyAnd in one partly sunlit but still shadowy poolwithin a noisy outer quarter of the townwhere broken trolley cars ranat a wide sunken corner where there were broken wall of tan stone and a poor pavement of worn red bricksa sheet of bloody crimson hung below the surface of the syrupy waterand the lighter red of a bar upon a perpendicular poster a step or two offand some light green from the poster too were reflectedAnd in the hollows of the fields the short old olive colored and brown grass stood up through the waterinvigoratedswimming gentlyand shining to its white rootsand the short olive grass round the wooden houses was like frosty forest moss for the wetThe long thick shaggy sod on the rough outer fields showed threads of cream and silver in the lightAll was rising from the shrunkenness and rigour of the wintereven the small trees were wet through and were alive and showed green in their blackAnd one coming from a distance over the round earth to some large treeswhere they grew in a great sparse grovesaw them rise tall and slender in the light of the skyhigh gently supple tubes of delicate pearllofty trees bending at their topsthe dark elms bent into the eternal Gothic arches of the forestthe oaks were full in their curves of kinks only a meter or two apartThe finer branches of the trees were gray hangings in the mild extensive scenea gray veil of fine branches floated over and through the trees along the roadways to far offThe ground under the trees of the grove was covered with wet iceA mild mild sceneand no sound but the wind syet it seemed to be a tumultuous scenea scene where there was something rushingsomething greata giganticglowingand silvery scene with mighty invisible actionOne thought then of poor friends in prisonAnd coming home across the wetted openone saw the big white moon pale and round in the southin the blue and cream sky that was growing mistyAt home a warm light from the warmed west came in at the windowand there were white and purple hyacinthspale jonquilsand sprays of white narcissusThe sparrows noisly pecked the dust mixed with horse dung in the drying centers of the plowed streetsand the warmth had dis8 tilled a little dust even from the damp filth that packed the angles of many wallsBut night comes cold and dingyThe cold is not winter s coldand is in solution with a shabby gray bluenesswhich is not mistThen the drying and bleachings are doneAnd overheadas through a hole in the bluenessa few dim lonely stars begin to shinethose of Cancer mild and faintCapellaand the TwinsJupiter hanging large and glaring below the rest as if it were greater than the starsUp there where the stars move rank beyond rank so thatas they sayit would be full of light if the eyes were strong enough to seeup there where sometimes there is a night skytranslucenttransparent evenand almost daylita clear bright blue night sky with wet white clouds and the fresh starsup there it is now shabby and dimAnd the moonthat has been high in the dayhas not remained long to light the nightThe dingy town lies beneath in silencewith its scattered houses and larger buildingssome made of wood and some of faded red brickssome of stoneThe buildings stand in rows along the bare and sunken roadways on the sandsThey lie upon the withering cold washed sands and clayAnd in one place in the town a man is beaten to deathIn a room of a public drinking place close to the center of the townthree members of the joyless strong willed race that lives upon the sands encounter one anotherand one is a tall fat cream colored man with a fat throat hanging beneath his chinwith small hard hazel eyesand a short hooked nosea huge man of address and cunningactive and lithe notwithstanding his sizea master and leader of a certain kindbut soft spoken tooeven with something of daintiness and grace in his airThe second is a small grim withered manstartingly reddened by the sunwith uncommunicativeglittering pale blue eyesa queer manand alertnewly shaved and very cleanHe is dressed in something of the best style for certain workmen of this placein dark blue woolen jacket and trousers to the heelsa white cotton shirt and a new blue capThe third is the victima tall bony youth with a gray skin marked with pimples and livid blotchesa loudroughand 9 disgusting fellowHe has sought to be fashionablebut misunderstanding the fashions has succeeded only in being dowdy and offensiveA gross vain boastful foolbound to be abhorrentespecially in defianceto such as this fat manwhom he has defiedThe fat mansmoking the wet stump of a cigarentered the large bar room late in the eveningjust short of midnightwhen the place was almost emptyhe entered from the street swiftlylike one busy and preoccupiedthe skirts of his long gray shabby woolen topcoat flyingHe seemed to encounter the youth by accident and with surprisebut he immediately asked him whether he would come to the rear for a momentThe youth stared at him a momentsmiled insolentlyglanced aroundand thenswaggering leisurelyfollowed him back through several deserted roomsThe fat man walked swiftly on aheadand no doors were closed behind them except the last oneBut this is the door of a small bare damp room adjacent to a kitchen and is lighted only by the weak reddish glow of a single glass bulb hanging from the ceiling by a short cordThe room contains nothing but a table of dark wood and two chairswhich have been pushed against the wallAnd as the two enter the door is shut by the small withered manwho has stood behind itThe fat man immediately laid his cigar stump on the edge of the tableand began to draw off together his topcoat and the jacket of worn thin gray cloth that he had onIn trousers and waistcoat with crumpled white shirt sleeves he appeared huge and menacingHe kept his high crowned hat upon his headThe youth understood at once what was to be done and glared about furiouslyBut he stopped in the midst of a boastful half savage halffrightened sentence that he had begun to utterfor the small withered man struck him over the head from behind with a long black club and knocked him down upon his face among the shadows on the dirty damp floorBefore his moan could rise to a scream the fat man leaped forwardseized the cluband began to beat him pitilesslyThe body soon grew limpand writhed and turned only by the force of the blowswhich was tremendousthough the fat man s 10 height and strength made the blows seem easily dealtThere was silence except for the panting of the beaterthe shuffling of his feethis grunted half sentencesand the enervating noise of the blowsThe little man stepped about at first to toss in with his foot the limbs that sprawled under the blowsbut at last he stood back and only watched with his lips drawn slightly from his teeth and his face a little paleOnce one of the keepers of the bar looked in hurriedlydressed in his white apron and coatand glancing askance at the blood that was staining the floorhe muttered something disapproving and withdrewto be heard closing doors behind him as he returned to his placeThe fat man s pale face was excited nowalbeit controlledminute drops of sweat glistened on itand his small hazel eyes shown wildlyHis implacability seemed inexhaustibleBut at length he dealt a concluding half dozen blows upon the shoulders and back of the now bloody headkicked the body twice and then the headonce at the side and once from beneathand handed the club to his companionBestriding the bodyhe lifted it by the shouldersturned it over and looked for a moment at the face mutilated by the kickIt was almost unrecognizable except as an object of horrorThe upper mouth and nose were broken and swollen almost to burstingsticky blood from the torn scalp was rubbed into the whole faceeven into the eyebrowsthe eyes were closedand as the head with its disordered hair hung backward it was like a sop of bloodThe fat man emitted a breath sharplypushed the body away so that it fell heavily in a twisted postureand still pantingthough he was becoming calm againhe resumed his jacketlong coatand cigar stumpThe small manwho was apparently quite in possession of his witswent outThe other wiped his forehead and looked at the body as it lay in the pools of blood that widened on the dim floorIn the shadows the blood looked darkof the colour of liverand it seemed three centimeters deep at the edges of the poolsThe youth s expensive but meanlooking clothes were filthy with itand with the dust and damp grit in which they had been rubbedThe long ugly feet in 11 white stockings and red boots lay like two loggatsthe tight trouser legs were twisted and pulled upand the jacket and greatcoat had been worked to the shouldersAfter some minutes the wheels of a motor cab were to be heard in the passage back of the roomand the small man came in again and instantly obeyed a sign which the other made himHe took the ankles of the bodyand the otherhaving first jammed upon the breast the wide green felt hat smeared with dust that had lain on the floorgathered up the shouldersThey carried the body out at the doorwhich the little man got open with one hand and elbowgrasping again for his hold upon the bodyAs they came to the orange enamelled cab with its curtains drawnits motor goingand its lights dimmedwhich could just be seen in the dense gloom between the dirty brick walls of the passage among the bent garbage pails and ash and dust barrels and boxesthe cab driver did not stir in his seat except to reach back to open the door for themBut as he did that and saw what they carriedhe uttered a sudden hysterical exclamationand then the red manwho had got backward into the cab dragging the bodystumbledshuffledand exclaimed sharply in his own turnThe big man bent forwardpushing so cruelly at the body that it was doubled in twoand the red mancrouching under the low roofand pushing at something within the cabexclaimed againBoth bearers then looked inquiringly toward the driverwho was just visible in the faint light of a small lamp at the side of the cabbut he sat still and only besought them to hurry for Christ s sakeThey pulled and pushed the body in upon the red manthe fat man jammed himself after and closed the doorand then they moved swiftly up the dark passage and out into the somewhat silvery dimness of the lighted streetsThere the water and snow had frozen into sheets of thin icewhich broke and crackled between the wheels and the rough brick pavementWith the large cab lights half aglow they passed at great speed out over the rough pavement of the center of the town between black buildingsand struck into more remote streets of little dingy separate housesSoon they went past a large railway station lighted below but dark on its many upper floors12 that stood on a waste among low iron bridgesand from here they followed an endless poor street of business where some small eating houses and dim tobacco and confectionery shops were still lightedthen they entered a farther expanse of little housesthrough which lay a lighted esplanadeBut after a considerable time the houses became fewerthere were great empty placesand thensilent railway trackage with solitary coloured oil lights burning among multitudes of shadowy motionless goods carsBeyond this trackage a pavement without lights or footwalks reached on into the fieldsand upon it they began to go out into the great blackness of empty country under the skyThey had come to the open land beyond the townto those bare muddy places which were without snow and were fairly dryThe large lamps of the cab were entirely extinguishedand only the one small side light and the tiny red one by the metal plate and extra tire behind continued to glowHere islands of gloom floated off above the earth on every side and the distant horizon was distinguishable in a black void only by pale narrow mists just above itNone but the few stars directly at the zenith could be seen through the gloom and mist overheadAn immenselonelyand desolate placeThe barking of a dog at a distance could just be heardUnder the gloomafter a timea vague undefined zone of pale tarnished mist seemed to appearit was similar to that along the horizonand in it one saw a little of the gray brown fields nearest him with their mud endlessly indented as it had been dumped there by cartloads to raise and fill the low groundScattered on the mud were pieces of waste brickstoneand woodrusted tinskitchen potsand wiresand in some of the hollows clods of turf had taken rootFar off on the town side one saw the fields extending up to the long vague mound of shadow with little lights low down along it like pale balls apartupon a threadOn the other side the fields seemed real for only a little waybeyond that they dissolved into the shadowed emptiness of the distance and the skyIn one directionfar off from the paved roadwaywere two or three cottageseach facing a different quarterand in one a dim light was burning as if very high in the airIn two other places the water of deep ponds glistenedSome ice and 13 a little snow lay in the hollows of the groundthe surface of which was frozen and seemed tough and rubbery when one stepped on itThe great empty place was dark and coldThe cab stopped after a timeand the driver got the door open hastily and then stepped downThe other men stumbled out quickly and straightened themselvesand now they too seemed anxiousfor they turned at once and brought out the boy s bodywhich rubbed the door frame hard and bumped its feet upon the steps as it cameThey began to carry it out into the dark over the frozen mudnearly doubled between themits seat hanging almost to the groundand the wagging head sunk on the chestThey walked almost abreastclose togetherswiftlystumbling a littleWhen they were gone the driverall alone and sweating and pale like a man distracteddragged out what else was in the cabanother bodybut a stiffening corpseand began to take it after themIn that just penetrable tarnished gloom the corpse appeared to be a poor workman ssixty years oldwith a pale fixed facea yellow bald head with some gray fuzz upon itand a long thin mustache that hung downa poor mantidybut with no jacketwaistcoator hata man with a slight body knotted by work and hands gnarled and strongHe was dressed in one of the dusty black cotton shirts with thin white stripes commonly worn by such as hea black scarf made to seemed knottedand trousers of dark gray cotton striped to resemble worstedHeavy braces of wide black elastic tape and tan leather held the trouserswhich were so large at the top that in them as they hung by the bracesthe body was like a small postIt had been shot or stabbed in the left sidefor that side of the shirt and trousers and that sleeve were lush with bloodthough at the edges the blood was drying and growing stiffThe cab driverbent backward and walking backwardmuttered and looked over his shoulder to see the wayholding the body by a hand in each armpit and dragging it over the mud face upthe helpless feet in stiff shoes bumping now both to the rightnow both to the leftnow one to the right and one to the left as they rode over the rough groundThe driver slippedtuggedbreathed audiblyand tried frantically to runAt last the fat man hurried up through the gloom and took 14 the corpse s feetand then they went faster and came to the little manwho stood by the boy s bodywhich had been thrown upon a mound of the earthAs the two bearers were about to put down the workman s corpsethe fat man suddenly objected and began to carry it nearer to the boythey put it down close to him with its head in the direction of his headThen the fat man hurried off searching and came back hastily with a length of wirewhich he was disentangling from a tin and dragging along the groundHis small companion looked onbut the driver went hurriedly back to the cabBending down and moving this way and that as if for lightthe fat manwith his coat tails dropping into his way and his attitude making him gasp for breathtightly fastened together with a tether of half a meter s lengththe thin tough wrist of the old corpse and the wrist of the still living youthThen the two men hurried back to the cabwhere the driver sat in his seat as one exhausted or asleepGray and brown clay and water had soiled the legs and feet of all threeand some was daubed on the cab step by the red man as he got inHe noticed thisand the cab driver started up suddenly to say that there was blood on the seat within and that he must clean everythingThe fat manwho had remained outside trying to scrape his boots on the curbingbegan to speakbut the cab driver suddenly cried to him with hysterical fury to get inand he did so at onceThe cab went on fast for a long way over the night fieldsthen turned onto another pavement and rushed along in the wind raised by its own paceAt length it crossed the end of a street of business with occasional lonely tram carsand soon it turned eassward and ran back into the townAnd time passed without incident on the mud of the fields till some hours before dawnwhen the wind began to blow slightly and the boy began to moanHe began to grind the back of his beaten head feebly on the hard earth and to raise his body between head and heelscrying out faintly and distorting his faceBut his cries were scarcely audibleand there was no one to hear themAfter some time he even began to move along the groundand the slightstiff corpse followed himthough it was a heavy weightHe began to cry louder in the darkwith a new noteand once he paused and seemed to know 15 that something held himfor he tried to push the fetter from his wristBut his beaten face was never far off the groundand he continually plunged forward on one elbowthe opposite arm pulled out and back by the weight of the corpsewhich with its stiff arm swung out and above its head with its hand bent at an anglescraped along half sidewise in the gloom over the mud hummocksthe pieces of rubbishthe short brittle weedsand the icePresently the boy stopped altogetherrose upbedaubed with mud and waterand then threw himself backward with a gurgling cryto lie face up beside the muddy corpsewhose fuzzy bruised head was hanging off a small mud humpOnce more the boy started upbut he merely remained upon his kneesswayingmoaningand beating the ground aimlessly with one arm and one flapping handSometimes the hand touched the corpse and seemed to be fondling and stroking itto be playing with itOnce more the boy started upand this time got quite to his feethis bloody broken blind face turned aloft into the darkbut he began almost at once to swayand then he sank down beside the corpse on his facearmsand kneesFinally he fell over on his side in the dark and the freezing mudand he remained so until he died in the gloom and chill sometime before morningFrom one of the cottageswhere Polish peasants livedan old man dressed in clothes made of patches and pushing a cart made of a box upon two wheelscame out into the cold dim foggy dawn to gather up wood here and there on the mudThis old man found the two dead mud soaked blood stained slightly frozen bodies fastened togetherHe saw them first rather suddenly from a distance in the pale lightand he began to approach them slowly over the broken ground pushing his cart before him as if for protection and looking toward themWhen he had got nearer he left the cart and moved on more and more slowly and cautiouslyas if circlingnervously holding forward his head on its thin wrinkled neckand snuffling through his cold wet noseThen he went to the heaptouched it with one footturned backtook hold of his cartand ran rapidly away pushing the cart and mutteringAfterward a number of people assembledWCGJitro 16BY JOHN STORRS BY JOHN STORRS BY JOHN STORRS BY JOHN STORRSCOMMENTS THE RUSSOMANIA MOSCOW ART THEATRENow that the Moscow Art Theatre has moved on it may be possible to meet some of the hysterical praise on the part of its fans with a little calm rejectionwithout being roared and shrieked into silenceMrGest provided the necessary advertising for its successit was boomed to be the test and measure of culture for America this seasonThere was really no necessity for all the noiseAnd here is an example of loud and overwhelming endorsement by a man who is a director of anarttheatre My Godwhat s the matter with you they re greatthey re wonderful I ve met them at tea at tea and they re amazing peopleI knowmy dearI ve met them all they re wonderful such nice people I went to the performances and tried to avoid the surges of hysteriaMy grey matter is grey enough to get thatit s not acting you re seeingit s life the dream of every director is to put Life on the stageand to discover that the company is made up of civilized peoplenot especially actors who have worked together under the same direction until they play together like an orchestra it s the last word in the theatre How can any one go agains thatBut here I goNo one will deny that the Moscow Art Theatre is the last word in representationbut haven t we had too much representation in every branch of art and discarded it years agoThelast wordshould have been said and the echo died down long before the war They put life upon the stagewhere is the logic and dignity in spending years of devotion and discipline in the doing of a thing that Life can do even betterThere is no more significance in life on the stage than in life off the stageIf life is the standard then the plays become a series of traveloguesLife has its satisfactions Art has its satisfactionsThe theatre must be theatric a show and everything must be sacrificed to 17 its ArtThe theatreas much as any of the artsmust attest the existence of a superior order from the order of nature and the evidence of humanityThe reproductionno matter how minutely or religiouslyof the few poor galvanized words and movements of civilized mankind galvanized by reasonan economic tooland by the environment of his consciousness attest nothing but a lack of consciousnesslack of movementlack of ecstasyMary Garden alone on our stage today is theatricShe alone summarizesenforces the designcreates a new aspectindicates and leads into the infinite from the concrete by form and movementCHALIAPIN IN BORISI went again to Boristo the last performanceto see if I could sleuth out the great excitement in the hearts of the public over ChaliapinIt is very easy to say that the public likes what it is told to like but liking is not an emotional outburstHis voice is not exceptionalbut he uses it more intelligently and more beautifully than is the goal in operathis is a pleasure but not an excitementIt is evidently the acting and the costumes that produce the state of exalté in his admirersHe is a trained actor who has eliminated all the chi chi of the grand opera italian french schoolsBut the things that he does that are his very own no audience has ever seen done by any one quite so gorgeous or so giganticHis school of gestures might be classed under secondary feminine traitsThere is thegraceof the handsbut it is the feet that are the most distinctive thing about the manwalking from the knee with short stepsthe narrow baseconstantly shifting and turning on the heelsproducing an effect of complete harmlessnessIn the death scene the feet lie like a dead canary sThe American audienceeven an opera audiencefalls for the weak turned he man and the giant shown helplessSafety firstRussia is a feminine nationTHE TIDINGS BROUGHT TO MARYBy ClaudelThe production of this play gave me a distinct experienceThe combination of play and organization back of it was so perfect that as 18 I endured I somehow came to a full realization of the true nature of the casabathe persimmonthe paw pawand all non resisting fruitsPEER GYNTBy IbsenYeats once said that the younger men of his group went to hear Ibsen not because they had the same friends as Ibsen but because they had the same enemiesAfter seeing the latest Peer Gynt at the GarrickIbsen becomes one of the enemiesSchildkraut s supernatural satisfaction with himself deserves applauseI have no better way of knowing than the Theare Guildbut I don t believe Ibsen was trying to do a Norwegian Peck s Bad Blue birdI have always protested that Ibsen was not very much NorwegianThere are no Bluebirds in NorwayThe mental climate is too drasticIf my analogy between Peer Gynt and the Blue bird seems incorrect or vague it is perhaps because I am judging only from the performanceEvenartproducers should use a little control Peer Gyntis not for the stageI don t want to go into a discussion of the school of Stage craft used in the settingsBut here was one chance where the advanced producer could free himself from nature without one effortNature is not natural in NorwaySimonson employs a series of moving skies of intense colours to suggest the NorthBut it happens that the sky is rather pale in Norway in the summerit is the sea and earth that changecolours as intense and violent and some less known than those used in any theatreThe impression of night is not darkness but rather an exaggeration of the day s effort at colourNorway is a perpendicular countrywould it have been contrary to the ideals of democracy to suggest itAll this is not an admonition towards geographical exactness but merely the indication of an opportunityHAMLETJohn BarrymoreROMEO AND JULIETEthel BarrymoreLove s Labour was not

where it seems to be holding on in spite of all the jeers of the pressThe production has more interest than most of BroadwayI don t know anything about John Lawson I don t know whether he was trying to do an American expressionistic playbut he has made a promising and interesting experimentIts only fault seems to be that it is not entirely conceived and executedThe story is the not too obvious or convincing struggle of the variant with the social patternThe acting is lyricalrealisticanything at allTHE INTERNATIONAL COMPOSERSGUILD has finished its season of three subscription programmes at the

will composers hold on to the octave one of the very oldest of musical conceptions20INDEPENDENTSETCHAVE you seen the Independents I asked the Baroness von Freytag It is entirely soshe shoutedThere is an increasing impossibility about these Exhibitions that is hilariousMost of the good men have withdrawn and formed a society almost equally bad called the Modern Artists of AmericaThe descendents of those great ones of a generation ago who painted beautiful winter scenes encrusted in silver glitter upon fire shovelswooden spoons and bowlsnow revel almost alone in an orgy of Express Yourself in PaintFlorine Stettheimer exposed a portrait of Carl Van Vechten which deserved better attention than I could give it in my ribald tour of the showI am sure Apollinaire would have added her to his list of women who are contributing toward a feminine artStuart Davis showed twoabstractionsand there were signs here and there among the hundreds of pictures that news of the modern movementat least twenty years oldis beginning to leak outThe value of these exhibitions is an old argumentbut a rabble of painters is as futile as any other kind of rabbleThere are no unknown geniusesthe artist is always known to other artiststhe population of the earth couldn t elect a man rejected by the mastersAn artist who is not of his epoch is ineffectual and boringNothis doesn t mean that he must paint or write about enjineswireless towersor waste landsOnly a few in each age are aliveThis is also true of artistsThe works of the artists of the highest energies are the spiritual measure of that age there are also artists for each degree of death21 The american artist is in a bad wayHe has never established his social function in the minds of the publicIn Europe groups of artists have revolted against the existing state of consciousnessthey have ceased to act as the medium and have become masters of the spiritual situationMany artists in this countrypleasant improvisors and gentle reproducerswhine about the terrors of themechanistic age What belief in the power and function of artto be terrorized by the power of plumbing systems and enginesThey fear that the present society will destroy the artistA passing social order takes with it its by productsthe velvet jacket Murger type of artist has disappearedbut that is just that and has no bearing and never had on the position of the creative artistThe creative artist is becoming more and more masterfulhe is turning his organizing and creative faculties upon the sternest activities of the dayHe will create a new significance for lifePainting as furnituredrawing room sculptureetc are things of the pastThis doesn t mean that the arts are passingIt means that they are organizing and reestablishing their livesThe artists themselves must establish their social functionThe modern artist must understand group forcehe cannot advance without it in a democracyThis is something very different from clubssocieties and unionsHe must affiliate with the creative artist in the other arts and with the constructive men of his epochengineersscientistsetcUntil this is established a great spiritual waste is going on through the dispersedunrecognized or unattained energy of the true artistThe Little Review has long been working on a plan to promote this ideaand to bring the artist into personal contact with the consumer and the appreciatorSOCIETE ANONYME19 West 47th StreetNew YorkThe Société was organized in the spring of 1920 to provide a place where the work of the creative men in the latest movements could be seen and studiedUp to the present the Société has had four22 teen exhibitions of modern artrepresenting ten countriesThe current exhibition is a showing of the recent work of KandinskyOne might thoughtlessly think that these galleries would be a hunting ground for the art student who cannot afford to go to Europebut art students always study models in schoolsRELIGIOUS FREEDOMIndian Commissioner Burke in

ANDERSON 25THE ART PERSONALITY IGNORING the divine American principle of Publicity FirstGeorgette Leblanc gave a series of unadvertised soirées in times in her own theatrewith modern settings by John Storrs and Joseph Stellaand chiefly modern programsMusically they interested me more than anything else in New York this winterexcept the playing of PaderewskiKreislerand Harold BauerTo most of my generation these personalities are not supposed to countThere are moments when I find my generation very stupidAn artist may work well in the stuff of his epoch and be as uncreative as MilhaudOr refuse to touch the good stuff of his epoch and be as creative as BernhardtI don t call Kreisler a business man because he plays what his audiences wantI don t call Paderewski a bad pianist because he wants to be king of Polandor because he doesn t play the piano as well as it can be played todayor because he never plays anything beyond ChopinHe makes other pianists look undecorative and invites you to suspect that there are no more great men in the worldI hate the people who say that Harold Bauer is intellectual but without fireHe makes the younger pianists look so uninteresting that you can t give them the attention of your mind for five consecutive minutesI don t care whether Mary Garden singsMy Little Grey Home in the Weston 365 consecutive programsI have never been at such a low ebb that I thought it was the subject matter that made the artI don t care whether Georgette Leblanc sings Reynaldo Hahn or PoulencI can so easily afford the sentimentality of HahnI don t burst into hysterics at allAnd her singing of the moderns is not merely an affair ofeducation NoI am not talking of thegreat interpreters Nothing has ever seemed more confused to me than the accepted distinction 26 between the creative and the interpretative artistNo one is necessarily creative because he composes music or paints pictures or writes poetryThere are lots of Edna StVincent MillaysThe interpreterCortotplays all kinds of music just as it should be playedThe creatorDoes anything as he alone can do it I am not talking of tennis or tight roping or cookingetc etc If the great art

meBut he said that Christ not being dead yvonne george29 one god should be sufficient for meHe then confessed that he would scorn America less if the Mormons were the only inhabitants and if with

to show his Olympian scorn for the virtue of Christian womenOne would have said ace of spades How can one get a better idea of the capacity of a glass than by overturning itIt gives you the idea of putting it right side up again with the necessary assurance He was in the habit of considering the stupidity of people as a personal injurya point of view that made him particularly dangerousI have seen fools rush out and throw themselves under the metro or under a vehicle simply because of having seen him and thought him madI didn t know anything as fearful as Picabia s large carriage or the attack of the gothas which put the section of Passy in rut and sweatFinally that day I saw the church of StGermain des Prés as the highest summit of faith in this anthillIn order to soothe them we ate striped ice cream and drank boiling teaIt seemed to me that never had the despair of my life attained a more pathetic simplicityMy prominent nose had always prevented me from ogling the worldTherefore I used to wear big smoked glasses with large tortoise shell frames which enabled me to look boldly out at the world without being seenI paid violent court to all the pretty women along the boulevard who caught my eye from behind this shelterMy collarwhich was too tightmade me feel faintBeing unrecognizable it was 30 clear that I frightened peoplethe memoirs of Cardinal de Retz which I had read on

had danced the shimmy the fourteenth of July and that he was furiously in loveBut would you have believed that he would have become so violent Just think of the scandal of the elopementThe fault was Cocteau sThe bride was too beautifulI found Crotti and his wife at Picabia s How are you feeling they asked me with such solicitude that I would have thought myself illPound was there playing chessAnd Miss BeeI realized perfectly well all the unforseen events which made the little dramaImpatiently in a state of indescribable nerves I waited for the pistol shots which were to close the dramaI implored Ezra not to push me to extremesMiss Bee started for England yesterdayShe was reading James Joyce and was wellI was so completely reassured that I couldn t stop laughingFrancis who was playing opposite Pound sometimes smiled seriously His game is very queerThe chess board isn t round because it is square EvidentlyI began to thinkthe glasses of Pound s spectacles are not round How are you addressing Picabia our friendPoundwas particularly affected a little while ago upon hearing that you were not wellThe most frightful drama of this time has occurred and if he is still one of us and if I am one of us it is because fate alone is immovable and inoffensiveComing back from such a distance I find you all completely indifferentIt is perfectly true said Picabia Pilhaon Thibaon will turn up

in the BoisWhat delicacy there is in this love of play and perfect hygieneI saw that my friend was radiantwittier than he usually wasalthough he was an extremely brilliant manHe was transformed and rejuvenatedHe seemed irresistible and exciting to meHis first words to me were words of pity and optimistic adviceHe thought first that I had not eaten or that I had slept 33 badly or that I had

VON FREYTAG LORINGHOVEN BY GROSZFRANCIS PICABIA ONE doesn t praise Francis Picabianot because he has no need of it but because any commentary on his work would seem superfluous and would lay one open to the charge of misunderstanding himEvery activity of Picabia is intensely opposed to any kind of praiseTo correct oneselfto repeat oneselfdoesn t this in reality ruin the only chance that one has to surviveYou have not stopped running and whatever distance you think you have put between you and youyou still leave behind you new statues of saltOf all mankind are you the only one whose heart has failed himAnd let no one object that Picabia may die some dayit is enough that for the moment this seems to me senselessI am young enough to be astonished and must I add that I am pleased at my astonishment not to find Picabia at the head of an officialinternational missionendowed with limitless powerwhose aimdifficult enough to defineoutstrips that of poetry and paintingMore and more we are the prey of ennui and if we don t take carethis delicate monster will soon make us lose all interest in anythingwill deprive us of all reason for livingThe example of Picabia is here of very rare assistance to usSomeone told me that in New York among the people who crowd into the picture galleries on the opening days of exhibitions there are always some who only glance at the wallsso intent are they to find the name of the next exhibitorIf such a one appeared during an exhibition of PicabiaI should like simply to say to himFrancis PicabiaSo true is it that in this sort of thing one can only improve by changeand the man who changes the most from Picabia is PicabiaIt takes all our eyes to comprehend this immense landscape anddoing itthe emotion of never having seen leaves us scarcely time to breatheThe calculated impulse in the act of its breaking up and in the fore knowledge of new impulsesa thought responding to no other known necessity than to the faith in its own exceptionthis perpetual security in insecurity 41 which confers upon it the dangerous element without which it would in its turn risk becoming didacticthe humourinaccessible to womenwhich beyond poetry itselfis the thing which can best oppose mobilisationmilitary or artisticas well as the mobilisation ofdada amusing as it is the humour and scandal which arise from it all these gifts together with the secret of using them without any particular delight like luck at playlove over and above alltireless love from which these booksCinquante deux MiroirsPoésie Ron Ronborrow the language even and take over the charming plots all these make us feel that every morning upon awakening we should like to consult Picabia like a marvellous barometer upon the atmospheric changes decided upon during the nightFor many this night is complete and I do not expect that the following anecdote will make any sensationBut I have it from Picabia and it may help to drive my point homeOne of Picabia s friends went one day to an exhibition of pictures at Lausanne with a MSS a young Persian noblemanThis young manfortunately a stranger to ourculturesaid to him Really all these artists are only beginnersthey are still copying applesmelonspots of jam To the observation that they were well paintedhe answered Beauty is painting something newthis gentlemanCezanneas you call himhas the brain of a grocer The truth is that we seek in vain for a reason for these exercisesIt is as easy to make a good picture as a good dishsimply by using certain recipesA recent experiment has shown that a gifted individual in a state of hypnosisis capable of excelling in the most difficult branch provided he has had his attention fixed upon this particular thing previouslyThe famous maxim To understand a thing is to be equal to itmust then be taken in its strongest senseThe day has gone by for seeking the causes of success in such and such an artistic formulathe origin of which was never anything but a conventionIt has been the habit to legitimatize this convention by the need of harmonyThe word harmony is absolutely denuded of significance and shows only the desire to express after the thing is donein a manner totally insufficientthat we feel only reason42 able emotionswhich isof courseof no importanceFrom this springs the old predilection for fixed forms in literature and the dogma ofcompositionin paintingIt is only by constant renewalnotably of his techniquethat an artist can avoid becoming the prisoner of a style which he has or has not createdIf one likes the water colours which Picabia exhibited in November 1922the oldest of which was done only a few months beforewould one not be justified in speaking of harmony or of appealing to some other mystic hypothesisIf these laws existedI think that they would not be applicable to sight and that no production would be under their jurisdiction at every pointAs a matter of fact the value of a piece of work no longer lies in the assembling of more or less happy coloursin a play of line which approaches reality more or less closelyNo longer is there a resemblanceeven a faint oneThe interpretation jest has lasted too longThe grace of known contourswhich Picabia has so often painted in his pictures of beautiful Spanish womenthe romance of tones to which he has given a tragic turnthe blue earth and the red skywhich he was the first to paintall these have given way to compositions in which the plastic valuesinnocent of every representative or symbolic intentionplay perhaps no more important role than the signature and the titleOne remembers that it is Picabia who not long ago had the idea of calling circlesPriests Ecclésiastiquesa straight lineA Dancing Star Danseuse étoile this to my way of thinking is to be regrettednot only because it concerns some of the most beautiful painting I know but also because it too systematically takes into account the astonishment of the spectator always ready to believe that he is being made fun ofHere this objection ceasesneither title evoking an image nor being a useless repetitionIt is impossible to see in it anything but the necessary complement of the rest of the pictureFrom the point of view of the spirit in which it has been conceived and after having insisted upon the faculty that Picabia possesses in the highest degree of breaking with the images which another would be content to leave aloneis it necessary to observe that it would be wrong to believe in the connection of these last works with hisépoque mécanique 43 There would be a veritable confusion and I don t need to struggle against a judgment so superficialWhat objections there will beAnother painterto whom together with Picabia and Duchamp we owe the mostPicassotold me the other day that in the presence of one of his pictures in which he had left some parts of the canvas not coveredfeeling the absence of colour was a colour in itselfhis friends were unanimous in deploring the unfinished pictureHe was obliged to tell them that the white of the canvas was painted by his own handHow can one expect that those who form judgments upon the water colours of Picabia will not find fault with the distribution of the colourthis moving appearance of chemical separation which certain of them have and which up to this time we have considered contrary to the arrangement of a pictureAnd how would the majority of people perceive that for the first time a painting has become the source of mysteryafter having been for so long a time only a speculation about mystery and that with this art without a modelneither decorative nor symbolicPicabia has without doubt reached the top rung of the ladder of creationandré breton translated by Florence ReynoldsTHE READER CRITIC JT WashingtonDCEVER since

MEDITATIONSON PAINTING THE CUBIST PAINTERS Second Series Continued JUAN GRIS HERE is the man who has meditated upon all that is modernhere is the painter who desires to conceive only new ensembleswhose aim it is to draw and paint only forms materially pureHis drolleries were sentimentalHe wept as they weep in romancesinstead of laughing as in bacchic songsHe still ignores the fact that colour is a form of the realAnd here he isdiscovering the minutiae of thoughtHe discovers themone masterpiecesGradually the little genii of painting assembleThe pale hills are peopledThe bluish flames of gas stovesthe skies with falling forms like weeping willows or damp leavesHe gives to his pictures the damp appearance of freshly painted facades on the walls of a rooma high hatthe disorder of advertisements on a fenceAll this might well serve to animate a pictureor to give the painter a limit of that which he proposes to paintGreat forms thus acquire a sensibilityThey are no longer tiresomeThis art of adornment strives desperately to cherish piously and reanimate the lost vestiges of classic artsuch as the drawings of Ingres and the portraits of DavidHe attains style as did Seurat without having anything of its theoretic noveltyJuan Gris is certainly searching in this directionHis painting deviates from musicthat is to say that it aims first of allA11 rights reserved for all countriesincluding SwedenNorway and Russiaby Létz CourbiéreTranslated by MrsCharles Knoblauchfor the Société Anonyme49 at a scentific realityJuan Gris has drawn from the studies which attach him to his only masterPicassoa design which at first appeared to be geometric and which he so characterized that it became a styleThis artif it progresses in the direction in which it has startedmay endnot in a scientific abstractionbut in an aesthetic arrangement which mayafter allbe considered as the highest form of scientific artMore forms suggested by the skillfulness of the paintermore colourstoowhich are also suggested formsObjects could be utilised whose capricious arrangement would have an undeniable aesthetic meaningAt the same timethe impossibility that exists of putting on canvas a man in flesh and bonesa wardrobe with a mirroror the Eiffel Towerwould force a painter either to come back to the ordinary process of paintingor to limit his talents to the minor art of the show window there are today show windows admirably arranged or even that of the upholsterer or the landscape gardenerThe latter two arts are not without their bearing on the painterThat of the show window would have an analogous influenceIt would do no harm to the art of paintingbecause it could not be used as a substitute for painting in the representation of perishable objectsJuan Gris is too much of a painter to renounce paintingPerhaps we shall see him attempt the great art of surpriseHis intellectualism and his attentive study of nature will furnish him with the unexpected elements from which a style will disengage itself as it does today from the metallic constructions of engineersdepartment storesgaragesrailroad tracksaeroplanesIt is only proper that arthaving today but a very limited social role to fillshould assume the disinterested task of studying scientificallyand that even without any aesthetic designthe immense extent of its domainThe art of Juan Gris is too rigorous and too poor an expression of scientific cubismissuing from that of Picassoit is a 50 profoundly intellectual art where colour has only a symbolic significanceAnd yetwhile the art of Picasso is conceived in the lightimpressionism that of Juan Gris contents itself with clearnessscientifically conceivedThe conceptions of Juan Gris are always clear cutand this clearnessno doubtwill one day throw out parallelsFERNAND LEGER FERNAND LÉGER is one of the well endowed artists of his generationHe did not tarry long in the post impressionist schoolwhich dates only from yesterdaybut already seems to us so remoteI have seen some of Léger s first attempts in art Night Baths a horizontal seathe heads already just scattered in after the manner of the difficult compositions which no one but Henri Matisse has attemptedAnd thenafter entirely new drawingsLéger desired to devote himself to pure paintingThe wood cutters bore upon their persons signs of the blows which their hatchets had left upon the treesand the general color partook of that lightgreenish and profoundwhich filters through the foliageAfter that Léger s work was a fairyland wherein the personages smiled drowned in perfumeIndolent personsmemories of Norman shepherds voluptuously transforming the light of the city in multiple and delicate shadowsAll the colours boilThen a vapour arisesandwhen it has dissipatedbehold the chosen coloursA sort of masterpiece was born of this fireit is calledThe Smoker There is in Léger a desire to extract from a composition all the aesthetic emotion it can giveHere he is bringing a landscape to the most elevated heights of plasticityHe discards everything which does not give to his conception the agreeable aspect of a happy simplicity51 He was one of the firstwhoresisting the ancient instinct of the speciesof the racegave themselves joyfully to the instinct of the civilization in which he livedThis is an instinct resisted by many more than one would supposeWith some it became a grotesque frenzythe frenzy of ignoranceWith others it consisted in getting as much as possible out of what comes to us through our five sensesWhen I see a picture by LégerI am contentIt is not a stupid transposition executed with skillful forgeryIt is not a question either of a work whose author has done what everyone wishes to do todayThere are so many who wish to remake for themselves a soul or a profession of the 15th or 14th Centurythere are others more skillful yet who forge a soul of the age of Augustus or Periclesin less time than it takes a child to learn to readNoLéger is not one of those men who believe that the humanity of one age is different from that of anotheror who confound God with a costumer until they confound their costume with their soulIt is the question neither more nor less of an artist like unto those of the 14th and 15th Centurylike unto those of the time of Augustus or of Periclesand for the glory of masterpiecesheaven will help the painter who helps himselfOncewhen he was in sore straitsthe sculptor Manolo went to a picture dealerwho had at that time the reputation of being willing to help unknown talentsManolo had the intention of selling this man some drawingsand had himself announcedThe dealer sent back word to Manolo that he did not know him Go tell Monsieur the Expertthat I am Phidias replied ManoloBut the dealer again answered that he did not know that name Then tell him that is Praxiteles whom he did not care to receive And the sculptor leftm m m To be surePhidiasPraxiteles or Manolo might have been 52 therebut the soul of a Phidias cannot be remadeAnd most men disguise themselvesTherefore it can be very well understood why there are always so few modern artistsThe most of them are disguisedThe Salons contain little but the accessories of the carnivalI like authentic works of artThose which have been conceived by souls which have not been remadeHere you areyou beautiesshadeslight coloursand

happiness for himif he ignore his missionignore his suffering and also the fact that he is always in danger here belowBut Fernand Légeris not a mystiche is a paintera simple painter and I rejoice as much in his simplicity as in the solidity of his judgmentI love his art because it is not disdainfulbecause it does nothing servileand because it does not reasonI love your légèresO Fernand LégerYour fancy does not exalt you to fairylandbut secures for you nevertheless all your joysHere the joy is in the design as well as in the executionHe will find other effervesencesThe same orchards will supply even more delicate colorationsOther families will scatter themselves like drops from a water spout and the rainbow will appear to sumptuously attire the tiny dancers of the corps de balletThe wedding party dissimulate themselves the one behind the otherJust another little effort to get rid of perspectiveof the 53 miserable trick of perspectivethis fourth dimension turned backward through which all things inevitably shrinkBut this painting is liquidthe seabloodriversraina glass of watereven our tearsthe humidity of kisses and the sweat of great efforts and long fatigueMEMBER of the Impressionist SchoolFrancis Picabiawith the majority of contemporary paintershadwith the Fauvestransposed light in coloursIt is thus that he has arrived at an entirely new art where colour is no longer merely colouringnor even a luminous transpositionwhere it has no longer a symbolic significance because it is itself the form and the light of that which it representsIn this way he approaches an art in whichas in the case of Robert Delaunaycolour is the ideal dimensionIt has consequently all the other dimensionsNevertheless with Picabia the form is still symbolic when the colour must be formala perfectly legitimate art and one which can be considered extremely elevatedColour in this art is saturated with energy and its extremes are continued in spaceReality is here material itselfColour no longer depends on the three known dimensionsIt is colour which creates themThis art has as much relationship with music as it can have with an art which is its contraryIt might very well be said that the art of Picabia wants to be to old fashioned painting what music is to literaturebut it cannot be said that it is musicIn realitymusic proceeds by suggestionhere on the contrary we are presented with colours which must not impress us as symbols but as concrete formsAt the same timewithout using new methodsan artist like Picabia here deprives himself of one of the principal elements of universal paintingthat is conceptionIn order that the artist mayin appearanceso deprive himself colour must be formalsubstance and dimensionthe measure Let us add that the indication of a title is notwith Picabiaan intellectual element foreign to the art to which it is conseFRANCIS PICABIA 54 cratedThis indication should play the part of an inner framesuch as actual objectsand inscriptions exactly copiedplay in the pictures of PicassoIt should avoid the intellectualism of decadence and conjure the danger which artists always run of becoming litterateursFor Picabia s written titlefor the actual objectsthe letters and moulded ciphers in the pictures of Picasso and Braquewe find the picturesque equivalent in the pictures of MlleLaurencin in the shape of arabesques in profundityIn the pictures of Albert Gleizes it appears in the form of right angles which retain the lightin the pictures of Fernand Léger as bubblesin the works of Metzinger in the form of vertical linesparallel to the sides of the frame and cut by occasional stepsThe equivalent will be found in the works of all the great paintersIt is destined to give picturesque intensity to a paintingand this role sufficiently signifies its legitimacyIt is thus that one guards himself from becoming a literary painterit is thus that Picabia has tried to give himself up entirely to colourwithout ever daringin approaching his subjectto give it a personal existence Let us observe that to indicate a title does not signify that an artist has approached a subject Pictures likeLe PaysageLa SourceDanse a la Sourceare indeed paintingcolours which unite or contrastwhich take a direction in spacewhich decrease or augment in intensity to provoke aesthetic emotionThis is not a case of abstractionfor the pleasure which these works give is directSurprise plays an important role in itWould one say that the flavour of a peach was an abstractionEach picture of Picabia s has its proper existence limited by the title which he has given itThese pictures are so little abstracta priorithat the painter could tell you the history of each one of themTheDancè à la Sourceis only the realisation of a natural plastic emotion experienced in the environs of NaplesIf this art was pure the possibilities of aesthetic emotions it contains would be immensePicabia could take for his own the axiom of Poussin s Painting has no other end than the pleasure and joy of the eyes Picabiawho seems to long for a mobile artmight now aban55 don static painting for other means of expressionas Loie Fuller didButas a painter of picturesI advise him to frankly attack the subjectpoetrywhich is the essence of the plastic artsMARCEL DUCHAMP THE pictures of Marcel Duchamp are not yet sufficiently numerousand they differ too much from one anotherfor us to be able to draw any conclusion which would furnish us a judgment as to the real talents of their authorMarcel Duchamplike the majority of the new paintersno longer has the cult of appearances It seems as if it had been Gauguin who was the first to renounce that which was so long the religion of painters In the beginning Marcel Duchamp was influenced by Braque pictures exhibited in the Autumn Salon 1911and the Gallery of the rue Tronchet 1911and byLa Tourof DelauneyA Melancholic Young Man in a Train To free his art from all perceptions which might become notionsDuchamp writes upon his picture the title which he bestows upon itThus literature which so few painters have foreborne disappears from his artbut not poetryHe then makes use of forms and colours not to render appearances but to penetrate the very nature of these forms and formal colours which drive painters to such despair that they try to avoid andwhenever possibledo without themTo the concrete composition of his pictures Marcel Duchamp opposes a title intellectual in the extremeIn this direction he goes as far as possiblenor does he fear the reproach of making a painting esotericif not abstruseAll menevery being who has passed near ushave left marks upon our memoryand these traces of life have a realitythe details of which may be scrutinized and copiedThese traces thus acquireall of them togethera personality whose plastic 56JUAN GRIS FRANCIS PICABIA MARCEL DUCHAMP RDUCHAMP VILLON FERNAND LÉGERcharacter may be indicated by a purely intellectual operationThere are traces of these beings in the pictures of Marcel DuchampAllow me to makejust herean observation which has its importanceDuchamp is the only painter of the modern school who today concerns himself with the nudeautumn 1912Le Roi Et La Reine Entourés des nus vitesnu descendant un eslalier This art while it forces itself to aestheticize the very musical interpretation of natureinterdicts to itself the caprice and the unexpressive arabesques of musicAn art which aims at drawing from naturenot intellectual generalizations but collective forms and coloursthe perception of which has not yet become knowledgeis very conceivableand it seems that a painter like Marcel Duchamp is likely to realise itIt is possible that these unknown aspects of natureprofound and suddenly grandiosehave no need of being aestheticized to be moving this would explain the grumblingssometimes tender and again firmly accentedthe flame shaped appearance of coloursand the compositions in the form of an NThese conceptions are not determined by aestheticsbut by the energy of a small number of linesforms or colours This art can produce works of a force of which no one has any ideaIt may even play a social roleJust as a picture by Cimabue was paraded through the streetsour Century has seen a Bleriot aeroplane all charged with the efforts of a thousand years of humanity triumphantly escorted to theAcademyof Arts and SciencesIt will perhaps be reserved for an artist as detached from aesthetic pre occupationsas preoccupied with energy as Marcel Duchamp to reconcile art and the peopleAPPENDIX DUCHAMP VILLON AS soon as sculpture departs from natureit becomes architectureThe study of nature is more necessary for sculptors than for paintersas one can perfectly well imagine a 57 painting entirely free from natureIn factthe new painters even if they study nature with zealeven if they copy herare entirely detached from the cult of her appearancesIt is even only through the conventions benevolently accepted by the spectator that it has been possible to establish the relation between such and such a paintingand such and such an actual objectThe new painters have rejected these conventions and some of themrather than return to the observation of these conventionshave deliberately introduced into their pictures elements foreign to paintingand perfectly authenticNature is for themas for the writera pure fountainhead from which one may drink without fear of being poisonedShe is their safeguard against the intellectualism of decadencewhich is the greatest enemy of artSculptorson the contrarycan reproduce the appearances of natureand many of them have done so By colouringthey can give us almost the appearance of lifeAt the same time they can demand from nature more than these immediate appearancesand can even imagineenlargeor diminishas did the AssyrianEgyptianNegro and océanien sculptorsforms endowed with a powerful aesthetic lifebut whose justification must always be found in natureIt is the observation of this condition essential to sculpture which justifies the work of Duchamp Villonand when he wished to get away from itit was to take up architecture itselfFrom the moment when the elements which compose a structure no longer find their justification in naturethat art becomes architecturePure sculpture is subject to a singular necessityit must have a practical endwhereas one can perfectly conceive of an architectural work as disinterested as music iteself music being the art which it most resemblesThe Tower of Babelthe Colossus of Rhodesthe Statue of Memnonthe Sphinxthe PyramidsMausoleumsLabyrinthsthe Sculptured Blocks of MexicoObelisksMenhirsetcTriumphal or Commemorative ColumnsArcs de TriompheEiffel Towerthe entire world is covered with uselessor almost useless monumentsor at leastof monuments whose proportions excede the end it was 58 desired to attainIndeedthe Mausoleumthe Pyramids are too large for tombs and are consequently uselessColumnseven if they are like that of Trojan or the Vendome Columndestined to commemorate eventsare equally uselessfor the details can never be followed up to the very top of the historic scenes featured thereIs there anything more useless than a Triumphal ArchAnd the utility of the Eiffel Tower was born after its disinterested constructionNevertheless the architectural sense has been lost to such a point that the uselessness of a monument appears today to be an unusual thing and almost a monstrosityOn the contraryit is easily admitted that a sculptor produces a useless thing and yet when sculpture is disinterested it is ridiculousSculpture has for its practical end the representation of simulacrumsthe statue of a heroor of a sacred animaland this artistic necessity has been understood in all timesit is the cause of the anthropromorphism of divinitiesbecause the human form is that which most easily finds its natural justification and also allows freer play to the fancy of the artistFrom the moment that sculpture leaves the portraitit is nothing more than a decorative technique destined to give intensity to architecture lamp postsallegorical statues for gardensbalustradesetc The utilitarian end aimed at by most of the contemporary architects is the cause which keeps architecture considerably behind the other artsThe architectthe engineer should build with sublime intentionsto erect the highest towerto prepare for time and the ivya ruin more beautiful than any otherto throw over a harbour or a river an arch more audacious than the rainbowto compose above all a persistent harmony the most audacious that man has ever knownDuchamp Villon has this titanic conception of architectureA 59 sculptor and an

modern museums highly efficient organizationsstrictly sanitarysometimes remind me of a visit I once paid to the Morgue in ParisThere in a refrigerated glass one saw those things which were once alivewere part of that bigger thing called lifetorn away by the accidents or tragedies of living to be exposed to the vulgar eye laid out carefully on ice to keep in them a semblance of lifeA fifteenth century sculpture torn from the facade of some French cathedral and richly exposed in the Metropolitan has lost 75of its lifeits raison d etrelike a head without its body but a fragment of a wholeWhat is the now faded beauty of a golden cup by Cellinibelabeled and carefully guardedcompared to that supreme time centuries ago when filled with sparkling Burgundy it decorated the tables of the Kings of FranceFor things of the past museums have a valuebut the practice of painting easel pictures and making bits of sculpture to beor with the hope that they will berushed off into some museum or private collection is a most unhealthy and unnatural practiceThe museums and self styled collectors are putting a pressure on the artist which keeps him down while they speculate and wait for him to dieYou organizers and builders of all this tremendous force and energy which is America have you no confidence in what you are buildingno confidence in the part the artist should play in
