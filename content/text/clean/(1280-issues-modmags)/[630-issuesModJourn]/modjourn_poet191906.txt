wife All things as well about his daughter touching Her growth and home life if the coroner Would hear him privately except those things Strictly relating to the inquest went To Coroner Merival s office and thus spoke  I was born here some sixty years ago Was nurtured in these common schools too poor T o satisfy my longing for a college Felt myself gifted with some gifts of mind Some fineness of perception thought began  See Note on page 174   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  By twenty years to gather books and read Some history philosophy and science Had vague ambitions analyzed perhaps To learn be wise  Now if you study me Look at my face you ll see some trace of her My brow is hers my mouth is hers my eyes Of lighter color are yet hers this way I have of laughing as I saw inside The matter deeper cause for laughter hers And my jaw hers betokening a will Hers too the chin that mitigates the will Shading to softness as hers did  Our minds Had something too in common first this will Which tempted fate to bend it break it too I know not why in her case or in mine But when my will is bent I grow morose And when its s broken I become a scourge To all around me Yes I ve visited A life time s wrath upon my wife This daughter When finding will subdued did not give up But took the will for something else went on By ways more prosperous but as for myself I hold on when defeated and lie down Where I am beaten lie and ruminate Upon my failure think of nothing else But truth to tell while we two were opposed   This daughter and myself while our temperaments Kept us at swords points while I saw in her Traits of myself I liked not also traits Of the child s mother which I loathe because They have undone me helped to yet no less I saw this child as better than myself And better than her mother so admired Yet I could never trust her as a child She would rush in relating lying wonders She feigned emotions purposes and moods She was a little actress from the first And all her high resolves from first to last Seemed but a robe with flowing sleeves in which Her hands could hide some theft some secret spoil When she was fourteen I could see in her The passionate nature of her mother well You know a father s feelings when he sees His daughter sensed by youths and lusty men As one of the kind for capture It s a theme A father cannot talk of with his daughter He may say Have a care or I forbid Your strolling riding with these boys at night But if the daughter stands and eyes the father As she did me with flaming eyes then goes Her way in secret lies about her ways The father can but wonder watch or brood Or switch her maybe for I switched her once And found it did no good I needed then   Her mother s aid but no her mother saw Herself in the girl and said she knew the girl That I was too suspicious out of touch With a young girl s life desire for happiness But when this Alma Bell affair came up And the school principal took pains to say My daughter was too reckless of her name In strolling and in riding then my wife Howled at me like a tigress Whip that man And as my daughter cried and my wife screeched And called me coward if I let him go I rushed out to the street and finding him Beat up his face though almost dropping dead From my exertion Well the aftermath Was worse for me not only by the talk But in my mind who saw no gratitude In daughter or in mother for my deed The daughter from that day took up a course More secret from my eyes more variant From any wish I had We stood apart And grew apart thereafter And from that day My wife grew worse in temper worse in nerves And though the people say she is my slave That I alone of all who live have conquered Her spirit still what despotism works Free of reprisals or of breakings forth When hands are here not there  But to return   Edgar Lee Masters  One takes up something for a livelihood And dreams he ll leave it later when in time His plans mature and as he earns and lives With some time for his plans hopes for the day When he may step forth from his olden life Into a new life made thus gradually I hoped to be a lawyer but to live I started as a drug clerk Look to day I own that little drug store here I am With drugs my years through drugged myself at last And as a clerk I met my wife went mad About her and I see in Eleanor Her mother s gift for making fools of men Why I can scarce explain it it s the flesh But then it s spirit too such flaming up As came from flames like ours but more of hers Burned in the children Yet it might be well For theorists in heredity to think About the matter  Well but how about The flames that make the children For this woman Too surely ruined me and sapped my life You hear much of the vampire but what wife Has not more chance for eating up a man She has him daily has him fast for years A man can shake a vampire off but how To shake a wife off when the children come And you must leave your place your livelihood   To shake her off And if you shake her off Where do you go what do you do and how You see twas love that caught me yet even so I had resisted love had I not seen A chance to rise through marriage It was this You know of course my wife was Eleanor Fouche Daughter of Arthur thought to be so rich And I had hopes to patch my fortunes up In this alliance and become a lawyer What happened Why they helped me not at all The children came and I was chained to work To clothe and feed a family All the while My soul contested with this aspiration And my good nature went to ashes dampened By secret tears which filtered through as lye Then finally when my wife s father died After our marriage twenty years or so His fortune came to nothing all she got Went to that little house we live in now It needs paint now the porch has rotten boards And I was forced to see these children learn What public schools could teach and even as I Left school half taught and never went to college So did these children saving Eleanor Who saw two years of college earned herself By teaching  I choke up just wait a minute What depths of failure may a man come to   As father who can think of this and be Quiet about his heart His heart will hurt Move as it were as a worm does with its pain And these days now when trembling hands and head Foretell decline or worse and make one think As face to face with God most earnestly Most eager for the truth I wonder much If I misjudged this daughter canvass her Myself to see if I had power to do A better part by her That is the way This daughter has got in my soul At first She incubates in me as force unknown A spirit strange yet kindred in my life And we are hostile and yet drawn together But when we re drawn together see and feel These oppositions Next she s in my life The second stage of the fever as dislike Repugnance and I wish her out of sight Out of my life Then come these ugly things Like Alma Bell and rumors from away Where she is teaching and I put her out Of life and thought the more and wonder why I fathered such a nature whence it came Well then the fever goes and I am weak Repentant it may be delirious visions That haunted me in fever plague me yet Even while I think them visions nothing else So I grow pitiful and blame myself   For any part I had in her mistakes Sorrows and struggles and I curse myself That I was powerless to help her more Thus is she like a fever in my life  Well then the child grows up But as a child She dances laughs and sings at three years springs For minutes and for minutes on her toes Like skipping rope clapping her hands the while Her blue eyes twinkling and her milk white teeth Glistening as she gurgles shouts and laughs There never was such vital strength I give The pictures as my memory took them Next I see her looking side ways at me as if She studied me avoided me The child Is now ten years of age and now I know She smelled the rats that made the family hearth A place for scampering the horrors of our home She thought I brought the rats and kept them there These rats of bickering anger strife at home I knew she blamed me for her mother s moods Who dragged about the kitchen day by day Sad faced and silent So the up shot was I had two enemies in the house where once I had but one her mother This made worse The state for both and worse the state for me And so it goes Then next there s Alma Bell The following year my daughter finishes The High School and we sit my wife and I   To see the exercises And that summer Eleanor Now eighteen and a woman goes about I don t know what she does sometimes I see Some young man with her walking But at home When I come in the mother and the daughter Put pedals on their talk or change the theme I am shut out  And in the fall I learn From some outsider that she s teaching school And later people laugh and talk to me About her feat of conquering certain Czechs Who broke her discipline in school  Well then Two years go on that have no memory Just like sick days in bed when you lie there And wake and sleep and wait But finally Her mother says To night our Eleanor Leaves for Los Angeles And then the mother To hide a sob coughs nervously and leaves The room where I am for the kitchen I Sit with the evening paper let it fall Then hold it up to read again and try To tell myself All right what if she goes The evening meal goes hard for Eleanor Shines forth in kindness for me talks and laughs I choke again She says to me if God Had meant her for a better youth then God Had given her a better youth she thanks me   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  For making High School possible to her And says all will be well she will earn money To go to college and she will gain strength By helping self Just think my friend to hear Such words which in their kindness proved my failure When I had hoped aspired when I had given My very soul whether I liked this daughter Or liked her not out of a generous hand Large hearted in its carelessness to give A daughter of such mind a place in life And schooling for the place  The meal was over We stood there silent then her face grew wet With tears as wet as blossoms soaked with rain She took my hand and took her mother s hand And put our hands together then she said Be friends be friends and hurried from the room Her mother following I stepped out doors And stood what seemed a minute entered again Walked to the front room from the window saw Eleanor and her mother in the street The girl was gone How could I follow them They had not asked me So I stood and saw The canvas telescope her mother carried They disappeared I went back to my store Came home at nine o clock lighted a match And saw my wife in bed cloths on her eyes She turned her face to the wall and didn t speak   Next morning at the breakfast table she Complaining of a stiff arm said That satchel Was weighted down with books my arm is stiff Eleanor took French books to study French When she can pay a teacher she will learn How to pronounce the words but by herself She ll learn the grammar how to read She knew How words like that would hurt  I merely said A happy home is better than knowing French And went off to my store  But Coroner Search for the men in her life When she came Back from the West after three years I knew By look of her eyes that some one filled her life Had taken her life and body What if I Had failed as father in the way I failed And what if our home was not home to her She could have married why not If a girl Can fascinate the men I know she could She can have marriage if she wants to marry Unless she runs to men already married And if she does so don t you make her out As loose and bad  Well what is more to tell She learned French seemed to know the ways of the world Knew books knew how to dress gave evidence Of contact with refinements Letters came   When she was here at intervals inscribed In writing of élite ones gifted maybe And she was filial and kind to me Most kind toward her mother gave us things At Christmas time But still her way was such That I as well had been familiar with her As with some formal lady visiting She came back here before she went to France Stayed two days with us Once upon the porch She turned to me and said I wish to honor Mother and you by serving in the war You must rejoice that I can serve you must But most I wish to honor America This land of promise of fulfilment too Which proves to all the world that men and women Are born alike of God at least the rich And classes formed in pride have neither hearts Nor minds above the souls of those who work This land that reared me is my dearest love I go to serve the country  Pardon me A man of my age in an hour like this Must cry a little Wait till I can say The last words that she said to me  She put Her arms about me then she said to me I am so glad my life and place in life Were such that I was forced to rise or sink   To strive or fail God has been good to me Who gifted me with spirit to aspire  I go back to my store now In these days Last days of course I try to be a husband Try to be kinder to the mother of Eleanor Life is too deep we break at last we say O Will whatever you are we bow to you We must submit  AT FAIRBANKS  Bill look here Here s the Times you see this picture Read if you like a little later You never Heard how I came to Fairbanks chanced to stay It s eight years now You see in nineteen eleven I lived in Hammond Indiana thought I d take a trip see mountains see Alaska Perhaps find fortune or a woman well You know from your experience how it is It was July and from the train I saw The Canadian Rockies stopped at Banff a day At Lake Louise and so forth At Vancouver Found travelers feasting Englishmen in drink Flirtations budding coming into flower And eager spirits waiting for the boat Up to this time I hadn t made a friend Stalked silently about along the streets Drank Scotch like all the rest and much besides   Well then we took the steamship Princess Alice And started up the Inland Channel great Got on our cheeks the breezes from the crystal Cradles of the North and so began at once To find the mystery silence see clear stars The whites and blacks and greens along the shore And still I had no friend was quite alone Just as I came on deck I saw a face Looked stared perhaps Her eyes went over me Would not look at me At the dinner table She sat far down from me I could not see her But made a point to rise when she arose Did all I could to catch her eye no use So things went and I gave up still I wondered Why she had no companion Was she married Was husband waiting her at Skagway maybe I fancied something of the sort at last And as I said gave up  But on a morning I rose to see the sun rise all the sky First as a giant pansy petals flung In violet toward the zenith streaked with fire The silver of the snows changed under light Mottled with shadows of the mountain tops Like leaves that shadow flutter on a lawn At last the topaz splendors shoot to heaven The sun just peeks and gilds the porcelain Of snow with purest gold and in the valleys   Darkness remains Orician ebony Is not more black You ve seen this too I know And recognize my picture There I stood Believed I was alone then heard a voice Is it not beautiful and looked around And saw my girl who had avoided me Would not make friends before This is her picture Name Eleanor Murray So the matter started I had my seat at table changed and sat Next to my girl to talk with her We walked The deck together Then she said to me Her home was in Chicago so it is Travelers abroad discover they are neighbors When they re at home She had been teaching school And saved her money for this trip had planned To go as far as Fairbanks As for me I thought I d stop with Skagway Oh this life Your hat blows off you chase it bump a woman Then beg her pardon laugh and get acquainted And marry later  As we steamed along She was the happiest spirit on the deck The Wrangel Narrows almost drove her wild There where the mountains are like circus tents Big show menagerie and all the rest But white as cotton with perennial snow W e swam past aisles of pine trees where a stream Rushed down in terraces of hoary foam   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  The nights were glorious we drank and ate And danced when there was dancing  Well at first She seemed a little school ma am quaint demure Meticulous and puritanical And then she seemed a school ma am out to have A time so far away where none would know And like a woman who had heard of life And had a teasing interest in its wonder Too long caged up At last my vision blurred I did not know her lost my first impressions Amid succeeding phases which she showed  But when we came to Skagway then I saw Another Eleanor Murray How she danced And tripped from place to place such energy She almost wore me out with seeing sights And now behold the White Pass she must see Upon the principle of missing nothing But oh the grave of Soapy Smith the outlaw The gambler and the heeler that for her We went four miles and found the cemetery The grave of Soapy Smith came back to town Where she would see the buildings where they played Stud poker keno in the riotous days  Time came for her to go She looked at me And said Come on to Fairbanks As for that I d had enough was ready to return   Edgar Lee Masters  But sensed an honorarium so I said You might induce me with a pregnant tone That moment we were walking cross the street She stopped a moment shook from head to heels And said No man has talked to me that way I dropped the matter She renewed it said Why do you hurry back what calls you back Come on to Fairbanks see the gardens there That tag the blizzards with their rosy hands And romp amid the snows She smiled at me Well then I thought why not And smiled her back And on we went to Fairbanks where my hat Blows off as I shall tell you  For a day We did the town together and that night I thought to win her First we dined together Had many drinks my little school ma am drank Of everything I ordered had a place For more than I could drink And truth to tell At bed time I was woozy ten o clock We had not registered and so I said I m Mr Kelly and you re Mrs Kelly She shook her head And so to make an end I could not win her signed my name in full She did the same we said good night and parted  Next morning when I woke felt none too good Got up at last and met her down at breakfast   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Tried eggs and toast could only drink some coffee Got worse in short she saw it put her hand Upon my head and said Your head is hot You have a fever Well I lolled around And tried to fight it off till noon no good By this time I was sick lay down to rest By night I could not lift my head in short I lay there for a month and all the time She cared for me just like a mother would They moved me to a suite she took the room That opened into mine by night and day She nursed me cheered me read to me At last When I sat up was soon to be about She said to me I m going on to Nome St Michael first They tell me that you cross The Arctic Circle going to St Michael And I must cross the Arctic Circle think To come this far and miss it I must see The Indian villages And there again I saw but clearer than before the spirit Adventurous and restless what you call The heart American I said to her I m not too well I m lonely yes and more I m fond of you you have been good to me Stay with me here She darted in and out The room where I was lying doing things And broke my pleadings just like icicles You shoot against a wall   But here she was A month in Fairbanks living at expense Said I m short of money lend me some I ll go to Nome return to you and then We ll ship together for the States  You see I really owed her money for her care Her loss in staying then I loved the girl Had played all cards but one I played it now Come back and marry me Her eyes looked down I will be fair with you she said I think Away from you I can make up my mind If I have love enough to marry you I gave her money and she went away And for some weeks I had a splendid hell Of loneliness and longing you might know A stranger in Alaska here in Fairbanks In love besides and mulling in my mind Our days and nights upon the Steamer Alice Our ramblings in the Northland  Weeks went by No letter and no girl I found my health Was vigorous again One morning walking I kicked a twenty dollar gold piece up Right on the side walk Picked it up and said An omen of good luck a letter soon Perhaps this town has something for me Well I thought I d get a job to pass the time   While waiting for my girl I got the job And here I am today I ve flourished here Worked to the top in Fairbanks in eight years And thus my hat blew off  What of the girl Six weeks or more a letter came from her She crossed the Arctic Circle went to Nome Sailed back to Frisco where she wrote to me Sent all the money back I loaned to her And thanked me for the honor I had done her In asking her in marriage but had thought The matter over could not marry me Thought in the circumstance it were not best To come to Fairbanks see me tell me so  Now Bill I m egotist enough to think This girl could do no better Now it seems She s dead and never married Why not me Why did she ditch me So I thought about it Was piqued of course concluded in the end There was another man A woman s No Means she has someone else or hopes to have More suited to her fancy Then one morning As I awoke with thoughts of her as usual Right in my mind there plumped an incident On shipboard when she asked me if I knew A certain man in Chicago At the time The question passed amid our running talk   And made no memory But you watch and see A woman when she asks you if you know A certain man the chances are the man Is something in her life So now I lay And thought there is a man and that s the man His name is stored away I ll dig it up Out of the cells subliminal So I thought But could not bring it back  I found at last The telephone directory of Chicago And searched and searched the names from A to Z Some mornings I d pronounce a name and think That is the name then throw the name away It did not fit the echo in my brain  But now at last look here Eight years are gone I m healed of Eleanor Murray married too I read about her death here in the Times And turn the pages over column five Chicago startled by a suicide Gregory Wenner kills himself Behold At last the name she spoke  GEORGE JOSLIN ON LA MENKEN  Here Coroner Merival look at this picture Whom does it look like Eyes too crystalline   A head like Byron s tender mouth and neck Slender and white a pathos as of smiles And tears kept back by courage Yes you know It looks like Eleanor Murray  Well you see I read each day about the inquest good Dig out the truth begin a system here Of making family records let us see If we can do for people when we know How best to do it what is done for stock So build up Illinois the nation too I read about you daily And last night When Eleanor Murray s picture in the Times Looked at me I began to think Good Lord Where have I seen that face before I thought Through more than fifty years departed sent My mind through Europe and America In all my travels meetings episodes I could not think At last I opened up A box of pamphlets photographs mementos Picked up since 1860 and behold I find this pamphlet of La Belle Menken Here is your Eleanor Murray born again As here might be your blackbird of this year With spots of red upon his wings the same As last year s blackbird or a pansy springing Out of the April of this year repeating The color form of one you saw last year   Edgar Lee Masters  Repeating and the same but not the same No two alike you know I ll come to that  Well then La Menken As a boy in Paris I saw La Menken I ll return to this But just as Eleanor Murray has her life Shadowed and symbolized by our Starved Rock And everyone has something in his life Which takes him makes him is the image too Of fate prefigured La Menken has Mazeppa Her notable first actress part for emblem Of spirit character and omen too Of years to come the thrill of life the end  Who is La Menken Symbol of America One phase of spirit She was venturesome Resourceful daring hopeful confident And as she wrote herself a vagabond A dweller in tents a reveler and a flame Aspiring but disruptive coming up With leaves that shamed her stalk could not be shed But stuck out heavy veined and muddy hued In time of blossom There are souls you know Who have shed shapeless immaturities Betrayals of the seed before the blossom Comes to proclaim a beauty a perfection Or risen with their stalk until such leaves Were hidden in the grass or soil Not she Nor even your Eleanor Murray as I read her   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  But being America and American these Bring good and bad together blossom and leaves With prodigal recklessness in vital health And unselective taste and vision mixed Of beauty and of truth  Who was La Menken She s born in Louisiana in thirty five Left fatherless at seven mother takes her And puts her in the ballet at New Orleans She dances then from Texas clear to Cuba Then gives up dancing studies tragedy And plays Bianca Fourteen years of age Weds Menken who s a Jew divorced from him Then falls in love with Heenan pugilist They quarrel and separate It s in this pamphlet Just as I tell you you can take it Coroner Now something happens nothing in her birth Or place of birth to prophesy her life Like Starved Rock to this Eleanor but instead When she is grown a hand darts from the curtain That hangs between to day to morrow sticks A symbol on her breast and whispers to her You re this my woman Well the thing was this She played Mazeppa Take your dummy off And lash me to the horse They were afraid But she prevailed was nearly killed the first night And after that succeeded was the rage And for her years remaining found herself   Lashed to the wild horse of ungoverned will Which ran and wandered till she knew herself With stronger will than vision passion stronger Than spirit to judge the richness of the world Love beauty living greater than her power And all the time she had the appetite To eat devour it all Grown sick at last She diagnosed her case wrote to a friend The soul and body do not fit each other A human spirit in a horse s flesh This is your Eleanor Murray in a way  But to return to pansies run your hand Over a bed of pansies here s a pansy With petals stunted here s another one All perfect but one petal here s another Too streaked or mottled all are pansies though And here is one full petaled strikes the eye With perfect color markings Eleanor Murray Has something of the color and the form Of this La Menken but is less a pansy And Sappho Rachel Bernhardt are the flowers La Menken strove to be and could not be Ended with being only of their kind And now there s pity for this Eleanor Murray And people wept when poor La Menken died Both lived and had their way I hate this pity It makes you overlook there are two hours   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  The hour of joy the hour of finding out Your joy was all mistake or led to pain We who inspect these lives behold the pain And see the error do not keep in mind The hour of rapture and the pride indeed With which your Eleanor Murrays and La Menkens Have lived that hour elation pride and scorn For any other way This is the life I hear them say  Well now I go along La Menken fills her purse with gold she sends Her pugilist away tries once again And weds a humorist an Orpheus Kerr And plays before the miners out in Frisco And Sacramento gathers in the eagles She goes to Europe then with husband No James Barkley is her fellow on the voyage She lands in London takes a gorgeous suite In London s grandest hostelry entertains Charles Dickens Prince Baerto and Charles Reade The Duke of Wellington and Swinburne Sand And Jenny Lind and has a liveried coachman And for a crest a horse s head surmounting Four aces if you please and plays Mazeppa And piles the money up  The next is Paris And there I saw her 1866 When Louis Napoleon the King of Greece   The Prince Imperial were in a box She wandered to Vienna there was ill Came back to Paris died A stranger s grave In Père Lachaise was given afterwards Exhumed was buried in Montparnasse and got A little stone with these words carved upon it Thou Knowest meaning God knew while herself Knew nothing of herself  But when in Paris They sold her picture taken with her arms Around Dumas gay photographs made up In postures ludicrous obscene as well Of her and great Dumas I have them home Can show you sometime well she loved Dumas Inscribed a book of poems to Charles Dickens By his permission mark you Don t you see Your Eleanor Murray here this Eleanor Murray A miniature imperfect of La Menken She loved sensation all her senses thrilled her A delicate soul too weighted by the flesh A coquette quick of wit intuitive Kind generous unaffected mystical Teased by the divine in life and melancholy Of deep emotion sometimes One has said She had a nature spiritual religious Which warred upon the flesh and fell in battle Just as your Eleanor Murray joined the church And did not keep the faith if truth be told   Look now here is a letter in this pamphlet La Menken writes a poet for she hunts For seers and for poets lofty souls And who does that a woman wholly bad Why no a woman to be given life Life for her spirit in another realm By God who will take notice I believe Now listen if you will I know your soul It has met mine somewhere in starry space And you must often meet me vagabond Of fancy without aim a dweller in tents Disreputable before the just Just think I am a linguist write some poems too Can paint a little model clay as well And yet for all these gropings of my soul I am a vagabond of little use My body and my soul are in a scramble And do not fit each other let them carve Those words upon my stone but also these Thou Knowest for God knows me knows I love Whatever is good and beautiful in life And that my soul has sought them without rest Farewell my friend my spirit is with you Vienna is too horrible but know Paris Then die content  Now Coroner Merival You re not the only man who wants to see Will work to make America a republic   Of splendors freedoms happiness success Though I am seventy six cannot do much But talk as I am talking now bring forth Proofs revelations from the years I ve lived I care not how you view the lives of people As pansy beds or what not lift your faith So high above the pansy bed it sees The streaked and stunted pansies filling in The pattern that the perfect pansies outline Therefore be smiling even indifferent To this poor pansy dying at the last Because it could not be the flower it wished My heart to Eleanor Murray and La Menken Goes out in sorrow even while I know They shook their leaves in April laughed and thrilled And either did not know or did not care The growing time was precious and if wasted Could never be regained Look at La Menken At seven years put in the ballet corps And look at Eleanor Murray getting smut Out of experience that made her wise  What shall we do about it let it go And say there is no help or say a republic Set up a hundred years ago which raised to power Of rulership as president a list Of men more able than the emperors Kings rulers of the world and statesmen too   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  The equal of the greatest money makers And domineers of finance and economics Phenomenal in time Say I repeat A country like this one must let its children Waste as they wasted in the darker years Of Europe Shall we let these trivial minds Who see salvation in the soul s restraint Pre empt the field of moulding human life Or shall we take a hand and put our minds Upon the task as recently we built An army for the war equipped and fed it An army better than all other armies More powerful more apt of hand and brain Of thin tall youths who did not stop but said Like poor La Menken Strap me to the horse I ll do it if I die so giving to peace The skill and genius which we use in war Though it cost twenty billions And why not Why every dollar every drop of blood For war like this to guard democracy And not so much or more to build the land Improve our blood make individual America and her race First to destroy Poverty and disease give youth its chance And therapeutic guidance Soldier boys Have huts for recreation chaplains too And is it less worth while to furnish hands Intimate hearts intimate for the use   Of your La Menkens Eleanor Murrays youths Who feel such vigor in their restless wings They tumble out of crowded nests and fly To fall in thickets dash themselves against Walls trees  I have a vision Coroner Of a new Republic brighter than the sun A new race loftier faith this land of ours Made over for its people boys and girls Conserved like forests water power or mines Watched tested put to best use keen economies Practiced on spirits waste of human life Hope aspiration talent virtues powers Avoided by a science science of life Of spirit what you will Enough of war And billions for the flag all well enough Some billions now to make democracy Democracy in truth with us and life Not helter skelter hitting as it may And missing much as this La Menken did I m not convinced we must have stunted pansies That have no use but just to piece the pattern Let s try and if we try and fail why then Our human duty ends the God in us Will have it just this way no other way And then we may accept so poor a world A republic so unfinished  Edgar Lee Masters  POETRY A Magazine of Verse  COMMENT  STEPHEN CRANE  E have all heard the persistent utterance of this name the persistent assertion that this fiery spirit of the nineties forestalled and outdid the vers librists of these days The inquiry therefore becomes pertinent how far was Stephen Crane a pioneer Does he belong among the new poets and if so what place should be given him in their ranks May we not try to dissociate his work from the glamour of his gallant youth and early death and judge it as he would have wished impersonally candidly  Thus approached Crane would seem to strike higher as a novelist than a poet For stern uncompromising realism presenting without sentimentality the heart breaking pathos of a poor little beaten and broken life his brief novel Maggie is a masterpiece surely not to be forgotten in our literary annals It is a grim story straightly told never swerving from the immediate tragic drama and presenting that drama of darkness with a sombre vividness worthy of the great Russians  And The Red Badge of Courage has the same vividness of realistic detail artistically concentrated upon the presentation of a character and a situation Following a single young soldier through his first day in action never swerving from his personal experience and conquest of the red sickness of battle it reminds one of Conrad s Typhoon in penetrating descriptive power presenting intensively a single   Stephen Crane  cataclysmic experience of a human soul struggling against sublime obstacles  In passing from Crane s brief novels to his books of free verse one is conscious of a strain His attack upon the new art was less simple and direct he was more tempted to orate to become cosmic and important to utter large truths in chanting tones with the official robes of the vates on so to speak caught to a certain degree even this radical by the Victorian fashion And although his touch is surer in his second book than his first the attitude is not justified by either an impassioned originality in his message or an instructive and personal poetic rhythm The following much quoted poem typical of most in The Black Riders illustrates these points  Supposing that I should have the courage To let a red sword of virtue Plunge into my heart Letting to the weeds of the ground My sinful blood What can you offer me A gardened castle A flowery kingdom What a hope Then hence with your red sword of virtue  Now is not this poem in the last analysis a bit sententious and platitudinous And while its free verse rhythmic movement is doubtless as good as that of many poets whose work passes current today has it that special and personal magic which would compel us to give its author pride of place as a pioneer in the modern procession such a position as one readily accords to Emily Dickinson who through   POETRY A Magazine of V erse  decades of the later nineteenth century was confiding to her private journals poems of intensely personal emotion which achieved without much respect for the accepted prosodic rules a closely woven form of subtle rhythmic beauty  The Black Riders is full of the wisdom of yester year startling utterances which somehow cease to startle after twenty years so swiftly do the radicalisms of today become the commonplaces of tomorrow The Red Sword above quoted which is perhaps the best poem in the book is one example of such high sounding easy wisdom numbers IX to XIII XVIII to XXIII and many others might also be quoted including this one XXXIV  I stood upon a highway And behold there came Many strange peddlers To me each one made gestures Holding forth little images saying This is my pattern of God Now this is the God I prefer But I said Hence Leave me with mine own And take you yours away I can t buy of your patterns of God The little gods you may rightly prefer  Somehow this sort of thing seems as old fashioned as Bob Ingersoll s fiery denunciations of idols powerful in his time but now thanks partly to his energy dethroned and shattered Crane s lessons have been learned the truths with which he jarred his world  There is perhaps less of the cosmic in War is Kind In  this later book of free verse the ironies are less platitudinous   Stephen Crane  and more of the poems record simple personal experiences The first irony of course is expressed in the title which has often been taken too literally at its face value The grim poem which ends the book is perhaps the best Crane ever wrote so we quote it entire  WAR IS KIND Do not weep maiden for war is kind Because your lover threw wild hands toward the sky And the affrighted steed ran on alone Do not weep War is kind Hoarse booming drums of the regiment Little souls who thirst for fight These men were born to drill and die The unexplained glory flies above them Great is the battle god great and his kingdom A field where a thousand corpses lie Do not weep babe for war is kind Because your father tumbled in the yellow trenches Raged at his breast gulped and died Do not weep War is kind Swift blazing flag of the regiment Eagle with crest of red and gold These men were born to drill and die Point for them the virtue of slaughter Make plain to them the excellence of killing And a field where a thousand corpses lie Mother whose heart hung humble as a button On the bright splendid shroud of your son Do not weep War is kind  Other poems in this book deserve quotation especially two details of love on pages 81 and 89 But perhaps we   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  may better quote this detail of death in deep regret that so fine a spirit should have passed so swiftly  Thou art my love And thou art death Aye thou art death Black and yet black But I love thee I love thee Woe welcome woe to me  Of course Crane was something of an innovator in his poetic experiments His free verse was different from Whitman s his use of the short line especially was a presage and it may have influenced some of the poets the Imagists for example who are now trying out its tunes Ezra Pound indeed has somewhere spoken of him appreciatively But if he rebelled against the older verse forms and took up a new instrument he never quite became a master at it He struck a few slight strains and then passed it on And it is for his work in prose that he will be longest remembered  H M  REVIEWS  COUNTERPOINT AND IMPLICATION  The Charnel Rose by Conrad Aiken Four Seas Co  By inviting me to review my own book for POETRY Miss Monroe puts me in an awkward position I suspect that a part of her reason for doing this is that she fancies the author can be severer with himself or shall I say more accurately severe than anyone else can be She puts me   in a sense on my honor to defeat myself But one tires of shadow boxing there is no joy in it for one s antagonist cannot retaliate So I am going to be for once my own apologist I do not mean by this that I am going to praise myself any more at least than the artist who paints a self portrait praises himself which he does in some degree by the serious act of self portraiture What I do mean is that since apart from any question of accomplishment my aims in the writing of poetry interest me extraordinarily and since I would like naturally to see them more generally espoused I shall discuss them naively and with candor  Suppose I begin with one statement with which everyone will agree that it is the aim of every work of art to evoke or to suggest There is no quarrel here What artists will disagree on is as to how this shall be done Some think it should be accomplished by methods mainly denotative or realistic they argue that the best way to imply is in the correct degree to state Others believe the method should be mainly connotative they argue that the best way to state is in the correct degree to imply Both elements of course enter into every work of art and the only real difference at the bottom is quantitative yet it is sufficient to account for such wide areas as lie between the work of Masters let us say on the one hand and that of Bodenheim on the other The one is solid the other diaphanous and the difference in tactile quality may be followed even into the choice of language itself for we see Masters pre   ferring the precise and as it were the square and Bodenheim preferring the tenuous and the abstract Masters employing the object or thing and Bodenheim the quality of the thing This is simple enough But the affair becomes more complex when we observe that any individual artist is not to be confined to one region in this regard but continually wanders up and down this gamut striking now at the denotative and now at the connotative chords never perfectly certain in fact which method is the more truly effective and of course obeying not merely a theory but quite as often the dictates of compulsions more unconscious It is going only a step further to note that the larger the medium in which a poet works the wider and more frequent will be his rangings of this gamut  It was to make more possible this delicious and somewhat irresponsible ranging of the gamut that I evolved the symphonic form used in The Jig of Forslin The Charnel Rose and Senlin I will not pretend that this was at the outset entirely conscious or clear Theory always comes second in these cases It was partly a natural enough ambition for more room partly the working of some complex which has always given me a strong bias towards an architectural structure in poetry analogous to that of music In the three parts of Earth Triumphant anyone who cares to wade through fifteen hundred more or less impeccable octosyllabic couplets will find already a groping towards symphonic arrangement though it is exceedingly rudimentary In Disenchantment which was given the sub title   A Tone Poem the idea of variation of form was developed though not far In The Charnel Rose it was first consciously elaborated though with errors in proportion And finally in Forslin and Senlin it achieved something like a logical outcome  What I had from the outset been somewhat doubtfully hankering for was some way of getting contrapuntal effects in poetry the effects of contrasting and conflicting tones and themes a kind of underlying simultaneity in dissimilarity It seemed to me that by using a large medium dividing it into several main parts and subdividing these parts into short movements in various veins and forms this was rendered possible I do not wish to press the musical analogies too closely I am aware that the word symphony as a musical term has a very definite meaning and I am aware that it is only with considerable license that I use the term for such poems as Senlin or Forslin which have three and five parts respectively and do not in any orthodox way develop their themes But the effect obtained is very roughly speaking that of the symphony or symphonic poem Granted that one has chosen a theme or been chosen by a theme which will permit rapid changes of tone which will not insist on a tone too static it will be seen that there is no limit to the variety of effects obtainable for not only can one use all the simpler poetic tones let us for convenience represent any five such simple poetic tones each composing one separate movement to be used in a symphony as a b c d e but since one is using them as parts of a   larger design one can also obtain novel effects by placing them in juxtaposition as consecutive movements such as ab ac cae For a it is clear if it is preceded by c and followed by e is not quite the same as a standing alone Something has happened to it A peculiar light has been cast across it which throws certain parts of it into stronger relief than others and a itself reacts on c retrospectively and a moment later on e In a sense therefore we have created a new poetic unit cae a unit of which the characteristic pleasure it affords us is really contrapuntal since it works upon us through our sense of contrast Each added movement further complicates the tone effect adds color to the hover of reverberations creates a new composite unit And we get finally a whole major section of the symphony so constructed of contrasts and harmonies which in turn if we are careful will differ clearly in general tone from the next major part And here the same principles apply Part II for example following Part I and preceding Part III is by no means the same affair from the point of view of tone effect as Part II transferred so as to be Part IV Thus Part IV of The Jig of Forslin which deals with Forslin s religious debauch owes much of its effect to its position following Part HI which deals with his caprices among lamias and vampires an effect which originally as Part II it did not obtain It was transferred for  that reason  All this I must emphasize is no less a matter of emotional tone than of form the two things cannot well be   separated For such symphonic effects one employs what one might term emotion mass with just as deliberate a regard for its position in the total design as one would employ a variation of form One should regard this or that emotional theme as a musical unit having such and such a tone quality and use it only when that particular tone quality is wanted Here I flatly give myself away as being in reality in quest of a sort of absolute poetry a poetry in which the intention is not so much to arouse an emotion merely or to persuade of a reality as to employ such emotion or sense of reality tangentially struck with the same cool detachment with which a composer employs notes or chords Not content to present emotions or things or sensations for their own sakes as is the case with most poetry this method takes only the most delicately evocative aspects of them makes of them a keyboard and plays upon them a music of which the chief characteristic is its elusiveness its fleetingness and its richness in the shimmering overtones of hint and suggestion Such a poetry in other words will not so much present an idea as use its resonance It is the apotheosis of the poetic method which we have called implication It is a prestidigitation in which the juggler s bottles or balls are a little too apt unfortunately to be alto  gether invisible  I have left myself little space for comment on The Charnel Rose of which this paper is supposed to be a review In the title poem the reader may observe if he wishes this method in process of ghostly evolution it is for example   working much more efficiently and consistently in the third and fourth parts than in the first and second which seem indeed by contrast a trifle mawkish and archaic Even so the variation of tone has not been carried far enough a little more statement and a little less implication would have been a good thing for it verges on the invertebrate If the poem is objected to for its decadence however it should be recalled that the decadence is as it happens implied in the conception and that the conception has merely been permitted and in my opinion rightly to divulge itself I should object to being called a decadent as one or two have already called me merely because of this poem or because of a few passages in Forslin equally compelled by the thesis In Senlin the other long poem in the volume the conception is not decadent and neither therefore is the treatment The tone is acid humorous ironic In general too I think the artistic problem has been a good deal better solved It lacks here and there the opulence and gleam of parts of The Charnel Rose but it makes up for it in precision sharpness and economy One always praises economy when one is running out of funds The theme is the problem of personal identity the struggle of the individual for an awareness of what it is that constitutes his consciousness an attempt to place himself to relate himself to the world of which he feels himself to be at once an observer and an integral part Reports that Senlin is or was a real person are erroneous Variations the remaining series of lyrics was an experiment in modula   Counterpoint and Implication  tion of emotion tone I do not feel that it was particularly successful A theory should not be practiced in cold blood and I am afraid that in this case the compulsion was not for all items sufficiently strong  It remains finally to point out the profound danger of the method I have been outlining the danger I mean that one s use of implication will go too far and that one will cheat the natural human appetite for something solid and palpable One cannot truly dine at least every evening on as Eliot would remark smells of steaks in passageways One must provide for one s symphony a sufficiently powerful and pervasive underlying idea and above all make it sufficiently apparent Whether the time will come when we shall be satisfied with implication for its own sake no one of course can guess In the meantime one must compromise to the extent that one hopes for success By which I m not sure that I mean I compromise  Conrad Aiken  ON THE MOVEMENT  The New Era in American Poetry by Louis Untermeyer Henry Holt amp Co  The Advance of English Poetry in the Twentieth Century  by William Lyon Phelps Dodd Mead amp Co Our Poets of Today by Howard Willard Cook with an  introduction by Percy MacKaye Moffat Yard amp Co  The New Movement in poetry is more than a name or a hope It has definitely arrived if one may judge by the   number of books of criticism on the subject beginning to be published Miss Lowell s Tendencies in Modern American Poetry was the first and now in addition to the three noted above we have two which will be reviewed soon John Livingston Lowe s Convention and Revolt in Poetry quite the best general criticism on the subject that has appeared and Marguerite Wilkinson s The New Voices a Critical Anthology momently expected from the press making six in all  Of course these books like most criticisms are after the fact they do not mark the beginning of the new movement and it may be hoped that they do not mark the end although it is significant that by the time criticism had caught up with the Irish literary movement that movement was practically dead or had considerably subsided One may note in passing however that nothing so good as Thomas MacDonagh s Literature in Ireland has yet been written of contemporary American poetry Perhaps the movement has not yet crystallized sufficiently or lacks a common aim  Of the three books noted above we may begin with the least important Mr Cook s Our Poets of Today This is little more than a bibliography of sixty eight poets with a brief commentary on each of small critical value Mr MacKaye contributes an introduction written one may say in blind faith for when he wrote it he had seen only the list of the poets represented one wonders if he had any misgivings after he saw the rest of the volume and   in this introduction he develops once more his well known hobby of civic drama and community poetry that abstract will o the wisp which has so led him astray as a poet For there is not and never has been any such thing as community poetry Whistler was right about it in his Ten O Clock Art and poetry are individualistic It is only in a secondary and non creative sense that they become communal  With so grandiloquent a title as The Advance of English Poetry in the Twentieth Century one should expect much from M r Phelps book but unfortunately the title marches better than the rest of it and the book might much more appropriately have been called Pot shots at the Poets  It should be apparent Mr Phelps says that I am not a sectarian in art but am thankful for poetry wherever I find it But one would like to know where he found it or who made the odd assortment for him for the poets are thrown together hodge podge and of any but the most accidental arrangement there is no evidence whatever Sectarian Mr Phelps certainly is not but he has many blind spots and he shies like a near sighted horse when certain poets come within his range of vision At other times he positively refuses to take the ditch as in the cases of Las celles Abercrombie and T S Eliot poets dissimilar enough to make one wonder at his complacent rejection of both As criticism the book is non existent It is a banal garrulous gossipy poetic scrap book and if one cares for that sort of an introduction to modern poetry this is the place to find it But for those of us who know something of the   subject it is impossible to take the book seriously Whether Mr Phelps sins of commission are worse than of omission it would be hard to say but the list of important poets whom he has left out is a serious indictment against the book I have made one but I am not going to publish it since it might furnish Mr Phelps the material for another book from which Heaven defend us  In Mr Untermeyer s volume the body of the book fails to substantiate the premises of his introduction Whether or not one agrees with him when he says of the New England group that not one of its exponents burned with a keen and racy originality the quality which of all American writers Walt Whitman alone possesses certain it is that his attempt to make Whitman inclusively responsible for the new poetic impulse does not hold water in the face of the evidence And the link by which he seeks to tie Robert Frost among others to Whitman is pretty slight It is he says the poetic feeling for ordinary life which is the bond that unites most of the younger poets of today But the poetic feeling for ordinary life did not come in with Whitman even in America nor is it indeed uniformly characteristic of our poets half of whom are Hellenists or romanticists or troubadours of quite another sort One may question if Robert Frost is not more akin to the bed rock Whittier or even Bryant stock than to Whitman and I am not sure but that the New England poets though less original were as racial in quality as Whitman Nor is it possible to say that the retreat to the ivory tower is   blocked on every side Mr Untermeyer should have stopped to count the ivory towers in his book for the poet is as free today as he always has been to create his ivory tower and he is still creating it and living in it since poetry is always the illusion of experience rather than experience itself and the illusion may be of Chicago streets or Manhattan Ferry quite as well as of the streets of Avalon or Troy  The trouble is that Mr Untermeyer writes as a journalist rather than as a critic and his large generalities which seem to mean much in connection with a single poet are thus often flatly contradicted by what he says of the next What he praises one poet for omitting he praises the next for committing In practice and in precept the poets belie his words continually In James Oppenheim for instance moralizing and preaching are a virtue in others an artistic sin Virtuosity in Amy Lowell is an accomplishment in Masters it is an offense and so on What one looks for is not a less catholic taste in Mr Untermeyer but a more certain poetic one At one time his standard is poetic at the next one finds it social or topical or something else Topical it very often is to an irritating degree Mr Untermeyer is always talking as if the poet s job were to express something outside himself the streets or the countryside or the social ferment rather than the man himself to whom these things are accidents of experience  The fault of the book is therefore a shifting point of view augmented by the lack of any clear analysis or even group   ing of the various poetic tendencies into which it would not be impossible to divide roughly the contemporary poetic movement His grouping not quite so accidental as Mr Phelps is nevertheless quite as insignificant and inconsequential To include poets so distinctive as Adelaide Crapsey or T S Eliot in the Others group merely because they were represented in the Others anthology is to imply a bond where there is none The best method would have been to seek out the natural bonds Mr Untermeyer has not tried to rate our contemporary poets in what might be considered the order of their importance but so as to bring out most effectively their contrasting qualities But this is far from being an illuminating procedure A chronological arrangement would have been far better and this precisely is what the volume needs chronological that is in the order of publication For even in the short space of ten or twenty years or even a year or two for that matter it is important to know which poets have established precedents which poets have been the true innovators and which the followers And by the order of publication I do not necessarily mean book publication It is important for instance to know that Miss Lowell is not so much the innovator as the adapter of others innovations that Robinson furnished models for Robert Frost and other younger men that Pound preceded Eliot as Eliot preceded Aiken Mr Untermeyer has indicated some of these things but not sufficiently And these things are interesting not as showing anything so petty as mere derivations but as illustrat   On The Movement  ing what we may call the growth of the poetic complex of the period the ebb and flow the borrowings and accretions the contemporary impulse viewed as an inter active play of individuals and forces and not as a string of isolated and unrelated instances In a word what a book like this needs is perspective and this precisely is what Mr Untermeyer has not given it And he was not unqualified to give it since his interest in contemporary verse has been steady and constant and not sporadic or spasmodic as one suspects Mr Phelps of being In no place is Mr Untermeyer s violation of the historic sense more evident than in his treatment of Imagism where he ignores the first statement of the Imagists with its precise definition of the Image so far removed from the current conception of the image as essentially allied to the visual or what is worse pictorial sense and quotes instead the introduction to the  1915 Imagist anthology which is far more propaganda than credo and not worth the time spent upon its discussion Knowing the facts as he does Mr Untermeyer either wilfully suppresses them or he lacks the critical discernment to distinguish between what is hard and clear and what is blurred and indefinite in an artistic creed  But leaving aside the question of larger issues and final values the chapters devoted to single poets are interestcing and for those not already familiar with the subject instructive and informative His chapter on Robert Frost is by far the best it is the least journalistic and the most discriminating in a poetic sense None of the others ap   proaches it Those on Sandburg Lindsay and Ezra Pound and most of the others are adequate although they do not go deep enough into the poetic medium to be as illuminating as the one on Frost When it comes to the chapter on Masters one feels that Mr Untermeyer has enjoyed landing on his later work with perhaps more passion than judgment Masters later work has had no just appraisal His faults are obvious but the lyric beauty of much of his later work has been obscured by these faults and by the overshadowing prestige of Spoon River If he had never written Spoon River he would yet stand high as an artist by virtue of the best that is in his three later books Masters perhaps more than any other contemporary poet deserves and has not yet received adequate criticism of his work as a whole  On the other hand when it comes to the chapter on Amy Lowell Mr Untermeyer deserts criticism for exposition Here he is completely the showman pulling aside the velvet curtains commenting on the frame the fine brush work the tactile values the virtuosity of the artist never on the spiritual poverty the manufactured stage passion the continuous external glitter with no depth beneath the monotony of style the free verse bombast the lack of real humor or the endless emphasis on a form external to that true form which develops from within I don t know how Miss Lowell does it but she obviously paralyzes the critical faculty or nerve And the absence of it in this chapter by Mr Untermeyer is the more disconcert   On The Movement  ing because in chapters like those on Ezra Pound or Vachel Lindsay or John Hall Wheelock he is quite capable of balancing faults and virtues he is not blind to either But unfortunately it is just this inequality in Mr Untermeyer s criticism that invalidates it Now he seems to see and now he doesn t Now he is writing in one mood and now another as the notion strikes him I remember that he once wrote a review of Mrs Livesay s translations of Ukrainian folk songs in which he found fault with the songs because they furnished no solution to the Ukrainian political problem  But in spite of all this Mr Untermeyer s book is interesting and provocative even if it too fails to furnish us with a solution of the present poetical situation It is wider in scope than Miss Lowell s Tendencies in Modern American Poetry devoting separate chapters to about a dozen poets in place of her half dozen and giving extended comment on at least as many more with more cursory mention of many others and so far it is the best book that has been written on the subject although it lacks the interesting biographical material which was the best feature of Miss Lowell s book However as I have said neither furnishes us with any sense of perspective this will have to be supplied by the completely competent critic of the new poetry when he arrives A C H   RILKE S POEMS  Poems by Rainer Maria Rilke translated by Jessie Lamont  with an Introduction by H T Tobias A Wright  Rainer Maria Rilke is the second of a Viennese group of poets whose work has been presented in English within  the last few months for quite lately Professor Stork published through the Yale University Press The Lyrical Poems of Hugo Von Hofmannsthal Von Hofmannsthal Rilke and Stefan George formed a group in Austria whose work in its remote imaginativeness stood as a protest against the realism and the externality of German literature as represented by the plays of Suderman and the poems of  Liliencron These three made it their creed that The poet in order to depict life as life really is must take no part in it Rilke is what Von Hofmannsthal has been accounted but hardly is a mystic poet Rilke is more abundant and more emotional more of a visionary and more of a human creature than Von Hofmannsthal shows himself to be in his lyrical poems And he has been surprisingly well translated into English I have not read Rilke in the original but I have read other translations of certain poems given in this volume and I can judge that the meaning of these particular poems has been rendered with a spontaneity so surprising that we lose the sense of translation  The bleak fields are asleep  My heart alone wakes  The evening in the harbor  Down his red sails takes   Night guardian of dreams Now wanders through the land The moon a lily white Blossoms within her hand  Rilke was born in the Bohemian capital and H T in his eloquent introduction suggests the influence this ancient haunted city had upon his early poems But the Prague of his description can hardly be glimpsed in the poems given in this volume We feel the influences of another mid European capital of that Vienna which Professor Stork speaks about in his introduction to Von Hof mannsthal s poems the Vienna wherein beautiful gardens Romanesque churches palaces contemporary with Versailles galleries rich in Italian masterpieces were the elements that surrounded the lives of young men There was perhaps no city twenty five years ago where a young man of means and birth could live a life more detached from that of his modern fellow men This detachment and this closeness to art are to be remembered when considering Rilke s poems  They are the poems of a recluse Rilke walks lonely amid the crowd He contemplates an archaic statue a blind beggar at the Pont du Carrousel maidens at confirmation a panther behind his bars with the same intensity But he does not look on them as the poet of the decadence looked upon such things merely for their line and color All these things are to him glimpses of a mysterious reality  Sections of the poems are named The Book of a Monk s Life The Book of Poverty and Death But if he is the   poet of lonely contemplation he is also the poet of lonely exultation as in Presaging The Boy Moonlight Night  One might quote with the certainty of awakening interest almost any of the poems The one that most appeals to me is Autumn In it the poet by the use of a few common images makes vivid the thought of the mystic of all time  The leaves fall fall as from far Like distant gardens withered in the heavens They fall with slow and lingering descent And in the nights the heavy Earth too falls  From out the stars into the Solitude  Thus all doth fall This hand of mine must fall And lo the other one it is the law But there is One who holds this falling Infinitely softly in His hands  If Rilke is a mystic he is a mystic who has chosen to be concrete and colored One of his volumes is named The Book of Pictures And how accomplished merely as pictures are his Kings in Legends his Spanish Dancer his Panther Padraic Colum CORRESPONDENCE  A REPLY TO A C H  Editor of POETRY The article of A C H entitled Mannerisms of Free Verse contains so many inaccuracies and blindly sweeping generalities that one hardly knows where to commence in pointing them out I have chosen to select   the most salient and typical sentences of her article and to answer them in numbered rotation  First However much it may be claimed that free verse is closer to natural speech to the natural breath cadence and pause than metrical poetry the reverse is actually true of the majority of examples published today Nor does the pattern even so resolve itself into music into any organic rhythm of any sort  Are the majority of examples of any art form existing today from cubism in painting to free verse in poetry worthy of the inherent possibilities which that art form contains Doesn t the situation always shape itself into a few men rising above the level of insincerity and inability And if so why single out free verse as the lone target in a general situation which has always obtained throughout the history of art and literature  The rhythmical pattern of most free verse written today lacks cohesion and fluidity just as the greater part of present day rhymed verse is devoid of escaping freshness and vitality and possesses an arbitrary musical flow which lures the emotions and thoughts of the poet into restricted areas of decorous triteness But why continually shout the obvious in an attempt to belittle any general form of expression Free verse of the last ten years has produced men of seeming largeness and permanence such as Carl Sandburg Edgar Lee Masters William Carlos Williams Wallace Stevens H D Richard Aldington John Gould Fletcher Amy Lowell and one or two others Compare the old school   poets of the present day with these above mentioned people and decide whether free verse has not justified its birth and scope  Second Formerly we used to think that something was supposed to happen in a poem but in these poems full as they are of movement and as restless as a jumping jack nothing really ever happens at all The Jack jumps up and down on the stick but beyond Jack and the stick there is nothing Yet it is hardly the nothingness of the mystic  The above quotation refers to poems written by Lola Ridge although the writer unfairly omitted any mention of her connection Lola Ridge s poetry has the sudden and incisive movement of a locomotive piston rod It does jerk at times to be sure but it jerks with a purpose and its cruel strength should not be attacked because it often lacks graceful balance Critics of poetry never seem to be able to keep things in their place and always demand that a locomotive contain the qualities of a flower garden or vice versa They rarely ever judge a thing merely on the ground of whether it has achieved that which it obviously set out to achieve They allow their prejudices to insist that a thing is inevitably inferior if it doesn t contain elements which they personally care most for  A C H claims that there is nothing behind the poetry of Lola Ridge But what is she looking for the pointing out of a moral some philosophical intent an emotional bias enticing the scene into false capers some mention of the obvious undercurrents which swept the scene into place and   form Lola Ridge s poetry contains none of these elements to any great extent although some of her lines fit into the above mentioned categories She merely attempts to reproduce the essence of the scene s reality to compress this essence into a terse suggestiveness and to hint at rather than emphasize the forces in control of her picture She prefers to speak of livid faces spilling out of the black pockets of alleys rather than to describe the eyes and clothes of these face possessors or the tiny errands which drive them forth In this way she reproduces the sordid mysteries and sly harshness of the scene far better than if she had used a long and detailed style She leaves something to the imagination of her reader and does not insult his intelligence  Unpardonable crime  Third Mediocrity in free verse like mediocrity in metrical verse will pass and be forgotten  If the above quotation is true why waste so much time and attention upon this futile mediocrity If one really believes that something is negligible and digging its own grave one becomes genuinely indifferent toward it Elaborate sarcasm and much attention are not apt to be symbols of indifferent disgust In this connection it is worthy of note that those who belabor mediocrity in free verse have only a passing mention for the triteness and futility of average rhymed and metrical poetry Why is all the emphasis placed upon one side of the question Maxwell Bodenheim  NOTE  Domesday Book by Edgar

amuse it is NOT written for tired and depressed people Its aim is rather to secure a fit audience and to render available to that audience contemporary literary work bearing the stamp of originality and permanence to present in the making those contemporary literary efforts which ultimately will constitute 20th century literature  The philosophical articles which THE EGOIST publishes by presenting the subject matter of metaphysics in a form which admits of logical treatment are promising a new era for philosophy The power of its fictional work is investing that commonest but laxest form the novel as written in English with a new destiny and meaning In poetry its pages are open to experiments which are transforming the whole conception of poetic form while among its writers appear leaders in pioneering methods radically affecting the allied arts  Obviously a journal of interest to virile readers only Such should write enclosing subscrip  tion to TH E EGOIS T 23 Adelphi
