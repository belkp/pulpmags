Narottam never deigns to step into your royal temple He is singing God s praise under the trees by the open road The temple is empty of all wor  shippers They flock round him like bees round the fragrant white lotus leaving the golden jar of honey unheeded  The King vexed at heart went to the spot where Narottam sat on the grass He asked him Father why leave my temple of the golden dome and sit on the dust outside to preach God s love  Because God is not there in your temple said Narottam The King frowned and said Do you know twenty millions of gold have been spent on that marvel of art   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  and the temple was duly consecrated to God with costly rites  Yes I know answered Narottam It was the dread year when thousands of your people lost their homes in fire and stood at your door for help in vain And God said The poor creature who can give no shelter to his brothers would aspire to build my house Thus he took his place with the shelterless under the trees by the road And that golden bubble is empty of all but hot vapor of pride  The King cried in anger Leave my land Calmly said the saint Yes banish me where you have banished my God  THE PRICE  Only one lotus braved the blast of winter and bloomed in the garden of Sudas the gardener He took it to sell to the King  A traveller said to him on the way I will buy this untimely flower and take it to my master Buddha Ask your price  The gardener asked one golden masha and the traveler readily agreed Just then the King came there I must take that lotus to Lord Buddha he said to the gardener What is your price   The gardener claimed two golden mashas The King was ready to buy it The traveler doubled the price and the King s offer ran still higher  The gardener thought in his greed he could get much more from the man for whom they were eagerly bidding  He hastened with his flower to the grove where Buddha sat silent Love shone in his eyes on his lips was wisdom beyond words  Sudas gazed at him and stood still Suddenly he fell on his knees placing the lotus at Buddha s feet Buddha smiled and asked What is your prayer my son Nothing my lord Sudas answered only a speck of the dust off your feet  UNION  Tulsidas the poet as was his custom was wandering deep in thought by the Ganges in that lonely spot where they burn their dead  He found a woman sitting at the feet of the corpse of her dead husband gaily dressed as for her wedding  She rose as she saw him bowed to him and said Permit me master with your blessings to follow my husband to heaven  Why such hurry my daughter asked Tulsi Is not this earth also his who made heaven   For heaven I do not hanker said the woman I  want my husband  Tulsi smiled and said to her Go back to your home  my child Bifore the month is over you will find your  husband  The woman went back with glad hope Tulsi came  to her every day and gave her high thoughts to think  and immortal truths for meditation till her heart was  filled to the brim with love divine  When the month was scarcely over came to her curious neighbors and enquired Woman have you found your husband  The widow smiled and said I have  Eagerly they asked Where is he  In my heart is my lord one with me said the woman  THE GIFT  Sanatan was telling his beads by the Ganges when a Brahmin in rags came to him and said Help me I am poor  My alms bowl is all that is my own said Sanatan I have given away everything I had But my lord Shiva came to me in my dreams said the Brahmin and counselled me to come to you When suddenly Sanatan remembered he had picked up a stone of priceless value from the pebbles on the   banks of the river and thinking that someone might need it had hid it in the sands He pointed out the spot to the Brahmin who dug up the stone and was surprised  The Brahmin sat on the earth and mused alone till the sun went down behind the trees and cowherds went home with their cattle  Then he rose and came slowly to Sanatan and said Master give me the least fraction of that wealth that disdains the wealth of all the world  And he threw away the gem into the water  THE TRYST  Upagupta the disciple of Buddha lay asleep on the dust by the wall of Mathura Lamps were all out doors were all shut in the town and stars were hidden in clouds in the murky sky of August  Whose feet were those tinkling with anklets touching his breast of a sudden He woke up starting and the rude light from the woman s lamp struck his forgiving eyes  It was the dancing girl drunk with the wine of youth starred with jewels and clouded with a pale blue mantle  She lowered her lamp and saw the young face where mercy shone in the eyes and purity beamed from the forehead   Forgive me young ascetic said the woman graciously come to my home This hard dusty earth is not a fit bed for you  The ascetic answered Go on your way fair woman When the time is ripe I will come and see you  Suddenly the dark black night showed its teeth in a flash of lightning The storm fiend growled in the sky and the woman trembled in fear    The New Year had not yet begun It was an evening of March The wind was wild The branches of the wayside trees were aching with blossoms  Gay notes of the flute came floating in the warm spring air from afar The citizens had gone to the woods to the festival of flowers From the mid sky smiled the full moon on the empty and silent town  The young ascetic was walking alone in the lonely city road The moon beam checquered with shadows fell on his path and sleepless Koels sang from the flowering mango branches  He passed through the city gates and stood at the base of the rampart What woman was it lying on the earth in the shadow of the wall at his feet  She was struck with the black pestilence her body was spotted with sores She was driven from the town with haste for the fear of her fatal touch   I he ascetic sat by her side gently took her head on his knees moistened her lips with water and smeared her body with balm  Who art thou kind angel of mercy asked the woman The time at last has arrived for me to visit you and I have come replied the young ascetic  Rabindra Nath Tagore  VISION  Mother I have come home to you Out of my sore distress Mother how beautiful you are In your dull working dress  Then if you see me so dear child I heard my mother say See too the beauty of the soul In her worn dress of clay  Alice Brown   OUR LADY OF IDLENESS  They in the darkness gather and ask  Her name the mistress of their endless task  The Toilers  Tinsel makers in factory gloom Miners in ethylene pits Divers and druggists mixing poisonous bloom  Huge hunters men of brawn Half naked creatures of the tropics Furred trappers stealing forth at Labrador dawn  Catchers of beetles sheep men in bleak sheds  Pearl fishers perched on Indian coasts  Children in stifling towers pulling threads  Dark bunchy women pricking intricate laces Myopic jewelers apprentices Arabs who chase the long legged birds in sandy places  They are her invisible slaves  The genii of her costly wishes  Climbing descending running under waves   They strip earth s dimmest cell They burn and drown and stifle To build her inconceivable and fragile shell  The Artist Artisans  They have painted a miracle shawl  Of cobwebs and whispering shadows  And trellised leaves that ripple on a wall  They have broidered a tissue of cost Spun foam of the sea And lilied imagery of the vanishing frost  Her floating skirts have run  Like iridescent marshes  Or like the tossed hair of a stormy sun  Her silver cloak has shone  Blue as a mummy s beads  Green as the ice glints of an Arctic zone  She is weary and has lain At last her body down What with her clothing s beauty they have slain   The Angel With the Sword  Come brothers let us lift Her pitiful body on high Her tight shut hands that take to heaven no gift  But ashes of costly things We seven archangels will Bear her in silence on our flame tipped wings  The Toilers  Lo she is thinner than fire  On a burned mill town s edge  And smaller than a young child s dead desire  Yea emptier than the wage Of a spent harlot crying for her beauty And grayer than the mumbling lips of age  A Lost Girl  White as a drowned one s feet Twined with the wet sea bracken And naked as a Sin driven from God s littlest street  Florence Wilkinson   IRRADIATIONS  I The iridescent vibrations of midsummer light Dancing dancing suddenly flickering and quivering Like little feet or the movement of quick hands clapping Or the rustle of furbelows or the clash of polished gems The sparkling mosaic of the mid day light Colliding sliding leaping and lingering Oh I could lie on my back all day And mark the mad ballet of the midsummer sky  II  Over the roof tops race the shadows of clouds Like horses the shadows of clouds charge down the street  Whirlpools of purple and gold Winds from the mountains of cinnabar Lacquered mandarin moments palanquins swaying and  balancing Amid the vermilion pavilions against the jade balus  trades Glint of the glittering wings of dragon flies in the light Silver filaments golden flakes settling downwards Rippling quivering flutters repulse and surrender The sun broidered upon the rain The rain rustling with the sun   Over the rooftops race the shadows of clouds Like horses the shadows of clouds charge down the street  III  The trees like great jade elephants Chained stamp and shake gainst the gadflies of the  breeze The trees lunge and plunge unruly elephants The clouds are as crimson howdah canopies The sunlight glints like the golden robe of a Shah Would I were tossed on the wrinkled backs of those trees  IV  O seeded grass you army of little men  Crawling up the low slopes with quivering quick blades of steel You who storm millions oí gravel tiny green tentacles  of earth Interlace your tangled webs tightly over my heart And do not let me go For I would lie here for ever and watch with one eye The pilgrimaging ants in your dull savage jungles While with the other I see the long lines of the slope Break in mid air a wave surprisingly arrested And above it wavering bodiless colorless unreal The long thin lazy fingers of the heat   Irradiations  V  The wind that drives the fine dry sand Over the strand The salt wind spinning arabesques With a wrinkled hand  Labyrinths of shifting sand The dancing dunes  I will run and catch at the flying sand And scatter it higher with my hand I will wriggle like a long yellow snake over the beaches I will lie curled up sleeping And the wind shall carry me Far inland  My breath is the music of the mad wind Shrill piping stamping of drunken feet The fluttering tattered broidery flung Over the dunes steep escarpments  The fine dry sand that whistles Down the long low beaches  VI  Not noisily but solemnly and pale In a meditative ecstasy you entered life   As for some strange rite to which you alone held the clue Child life did not give rude strength to you From the beginning you would seem to have thrown away As something cold and cumbersome that armor men use  against death You would perchance look on death face to face and from  him wrest the secret Whether his face wears oftenest a smile or no Strange old and silent being there is something Infinitely vast in your intense tininess I think you could point out with a smile some curious  star Far off in the heavens which no man has seen before  VII  The morning is clean and blue and the wind blows up the  clouds Now my thoughts gathered from afar Once again in their patched armor with rusty plumes and  blunted swords Move out to war  Smoking our morning pipes we shall ride two and two Through the woods For our old cause keeps us together And our hatred is so precious not death or defeat can  break it   God willing we shall this day meet that old enemy Who has given us so many a good beating Thank God we have a cause worth fighting for And a cause worth losing and a good song to sing  VIII Oh all you stars up yonder Do you hear me Beautiful sullen eyes I am tired of seeing you in the same old places Night after night in the sky I hoped you would dance but after twenty six years I find you are determined to stay as you are So I make it known to you stars clustered or solitary That I want you to fall into my lap tonight Come down little stars let me play with you I will string you like beads and shovel you together And wear you in my ears and scatter you over people And toss you back like apples as I choose  IX  As I wandered over the city through the night I saw many strange things But I have forgotten all Except one painted face Gaudy shameless night orchid Heavy flushed sticky with narcotic perfume There was something in you which made me prefer you Above all the feeble forget me nots of the world   POETRY A Magazine of Vers e  ou were neither burnt out nor pallid There was plain coarse vulgar meaning in every line  of you And no make believe You were at least alive When all the rest were but puppets of the night  X Slowly along the lamp emblazoned street Amid the last sad drifting crowds of midnight Like lost souls wandering Comes marching by solemnly As for some gem bedecked ritual of old A monotonous procession of black carts Full crowded with blood red blossom Scarlet geraniums  Unfolding their fiery globes upon the night These are the memories of day moulded in jagged flame Lust joy blood and death With crushed hands weary eyes and hoarse clamor We consecrate and acclaim them tumultuously Ere they pass contemptuous beyond the unpierced veil  of silence  XI The flag let loose for a day of festivity Free desperate symbol of battle and desire Leaping lunging tossing up the halliards Below it a tumult of music   Irraditions  Above it the streaming wastes of the sky Pinnacles of clouds pyres of dawn Infinite effort everlasting day The immense flag waving Aloft in glory Over seas and hilltops Transmitting its lightnings  John Gould Fletcher  THE FOUNDLING HOSPITAL  Strangely silent strangely bare Tiny faces everywhere Strangely old and gaunt and drawn In the dawn  Haunting piteous baby eyes Suffering mute vicarious lies Sacrifice for world old sin Deep therein  Man of pleasure you who lay In your mother s arms one day These upon their mother s breast May not rest   These your passions touched to blight Seed of sated appetite Starve upon a pauper s dole Body soul  That your pleasures play at ease Babes must battle with disease Heavy toll of your light way  They must pay  With the damp of anguished sweat  See these matted tresses wet  And these unkissed shrivelled hands Bear the brands  Christ have pity You were man  When your martyrdom began  For men s sins must the new born  Feel the thorn  Rosalie Jonas   THE MALAY TO HIS MASTER  The woman is mine O chief White chief whom the spirits fear The woman is mine I have bought her with blood My mark is upon her brow I swept like a shark the sea O lord of unbelief I swept with a trusty score to her isle And brought her home in my prau  She lay in her atap thatch Clad ah in her red sarong The cocoanut palms In the wind she heard But never my paddles near I seized her with mating arms O chief no moon is her match She cried to the hunting men of her tribe But lo I carried her clear  And tossed her across the surf O chief she is mine not yours I bore her away Though the pearls of her teeth Bit deep and her rage beat blind An hundred hissing darts   Each dipped in a venom s scurf Slid after us like swift asps of air But ever they sunk behind  And so she is mine twice mine For when in the jungle here I hid her O lord And sang to her heart And planted the rubber round And bought her your rings and silks And bracelets jewel fine And swept her with kisses like the sea At last was her long hate drowned  And so she is mine is mine White chief you must give her back I bought her with blood I will keep her with blood So chasten your heart of lust Or swift as you say the night Of Malaya falls at a sign My people led by the gods shall fall And make of your passion dust  Cale Young Rice   THE SHARING  Martin works in the garden Stephana comes from the cottage door Upon a bench under the eaves are ranged three very small wooden cages of the kind used by bird sellers for their stock in trade  Stephana At last we have our quiet holiday Come father take your leisure I fetched the birds to blink beyond the way And know a bit of pleasure  Martin Twelve sold within a week and that is well Stephana And these Martin Aside She never tires  Of birds and birds Aloud Whoever may foretell  Stephana Oh oh the silly buyers I keeping back the loveliest three and you Although you saw the hiding Making as if you never never knew  Martin You elf demurely gliding They laugh merrily Stephana Soberly No more shall come to buy and  that s my dream Martin The sun is on the hedges Stephana How all the little upward petals gleam Martin Look there along the ledges  Comes wandering a worn and meager man Look from the road he s turning   Stephana Perhaps a beggar from the caravan That kept me from my churning We cannot heed so many passing here  Marlin Now see him bend and falter And shuffle in his gait Yet coming near He seems to loom and alter He is even young  Stephana No no his hair is gray See now the stile he s over  Martin He has a word for us He walks our way Across the bed of clover Where do you come from melancholy guest  The Stranger Out of the dark of sorrow They said it was the east it was the west And there was no tomorrow  Stephana The birds are fluttering The Stranger The birds Stephana Oh look  The yellow bright canaries They light the dailiness of this dull nook They are my gentle fairies For father teaches at the village school And I m forlorn and lonely Except for these my heartlings beautiful All would be happy only When they begin to love me off they go  The Stranger The price the price for ever   Martin For all the price is all the hand may show We may be fools or clever It is the earthly cry of everyone  The Stranger Poor birds No songs embolden  Their little breasts Their eyes forget the sun Stephana But they are soft and golden The Stranger The narrow cells Stephana Yes narrow are their homes  But never knew they wider The Stranger His houses He has made with azure domes The bountiful Provider Stephana Aside Dread of my heart The sign is on his brow  Dread of my heart is calling He ll buy my darlings On the settle now His silver hoard is falling Martin Whispering to Stephana You ll have a bit of satin home to try The Stranger The birds are bonny bonny  Take you my all give me what it will buy Stephana Father Forego the money Martin Now leave me to my bargain child Stephana Ah me  Martin You ll have a rosy fillet Stephana Father Martin Good stranger they are yours all three   The Stranger Mine Nothing shall outwill it Stephana But oh whatever is your good of them The Stranger Why look you Blossom Lady  Come

darkness leavens But free at last I could not face the light Till I could share the heavens  Agnes Lee  POETRY A Magazine of Verse  EDITORIAL COMMENT RHYTHMS OF ENGLISH VERSE II Coleridge s Christabel is in the main iambic but it is richly varied by a tree use of tribrachs and rests It is in tetrameter lines three of which typical of all may be analyzed as follows  Trochaic verse is rare in English but Shelley handled the measure with exquisite delicacy in the beautiful song from Prometheus Unbound Strict accuracy would require perhaps a 6 8 measure for the notation of most trochaic verse its alternate stresses being stronger than the others  The Skylark is much less consistently trochaic though on the whole it may be so classed Longfellow s Hiawatha is a heavier example   Longfellow s Evangeline is another three time measure one still rarer in English which may account for the confusion of the commentators over this poem Even Prof Genung makes the usual mistake of saying that it is written in the dactylic hexameters of antiquity Apparently Longfellow tried to do this and fondly imagined that he succeeded But instead of the majestic four time combination of dactyls and spondees which produced the mighty thunder roll of Homer s verse he achieved only a light and lilting three time measure as follows  Nothing could be more misleading than to call this measure dactylic True dactyls are rare in English being so difficult of achievement as to be impossible for a long poem Mr Charles G D Roberts has written a few fine classic hexameters and George Meredith gives a hint of the true Homeric measure in his few fragments from the Iliad For example  For English hexameters these are very good though even our loose laws of quantity resent the poet s making   the first syllable of ever long The slow succession of long syllables in the second line produces an effect very rare in English verse Spondees were common in Greek and Latin but our poets have rarely used four time measures In our three time iambic measures spondees are often used to vary the rhythm but only by extending the length of one syllable into the next bar as in the following lines from The Tempest  Here loud winds and still clos are all long syllables and the poet gains his spondaic effect by shortening the syllables which follow them  George Meredith s Love in a Valley which has many true spondees is a charming experiment in four time of a movement much lighter than the classic hexameters  Four time measure of a still lighter movement with a swift succession of short syllables and many rests is much used nowadays in comic verse especially in the   librettos of comic operas A familiar example is Bun thorne s song in Gilbert and Sullivan s Patience  All the above examples of four time measures may be roughly called dactylic in type since the long syllable and the stress usually begin the bar But in English most four time verse is anapaestic in type with the long syllable and the stress at the end Usually English poets treat their anapaestic verses very freely not only using spondees which are allowed but often forcing short syllables to do the work of long ones an irregularity which is not however so offensive to the English ear as it would have been to the Greek Two masterpieces of English anapaestic verse Shelley s Cloud and Coleridge s Ancient Mariner show all possible variations Here are the first two lines of the former poem  The Ancient Mariner has been a puzzle to the analysts because usually they have tried to scan it as iambic   verse therefore in three time and so have quite missed the secret of its slow and pounding four time movement Many feet have only two syllables it is true but they are either spondees or else the first syllable has one beat of the bar and the second three Two famous lines for example read as follows and therefore they are not in the least iambic even though each bar has but two syllables  The Ancient Mariner has a magic music but its rhythm is perhaps the least bound by ancient rules of all familiar English poems A child feels it but few of the elders who sit in judgment have seemed to understand it In the first stanza the slow fall of the long syllables is very stately and beautiful And the poem holds this pace to the end   Thus the four time measure of this poem is richly varied its typical foot being of two syllables the second three times as long as the first The spondees are common the following line being entirely spondaic  The poem may be roughly called anapaestic if that term may be enlarged to include all four time measures which usually have the long syllable and the stress at the end of each bar The following line is all anapaestic  Swinburne of course has sung in anapaests more than any other poet and held with more regularity to   the type In certain poems of his the measure is perhaps too regular and the music therefore monotonous Atalanta in Calydon has a number of anapaestic songs for example  But the anapaestic is not Swinburne s only four time measure In the dainty Cradle Song the first bar of each   line will be read by most persons as four short syllables For this measure we have no name though it is more dactylic than anapaestic as the long syllable when there is one and the stress are at the beginning of the bar  Poe s Raven moves to a similar four time measure and therefore it is not in the least trochaic as it used to be classed  Shakespeare and one or two of his lyric contemporaries produced now and then a quite magical effect by a swift change of measure from three time to four time or the reverse as in every stanza of this song   Tennyson tries the same experiment in this song with a success somewhat less exquisite   These analyses cover almost all the variations usual in English verse Certain measures common in Greek and Latin alter their rhythms when English poets experiment with them A classic choriambic foot for example consists of four syllables a long two shorts and a long and counts six beats whereas in the hands of Swinburne and others it becomes a charming thing but very different Horace s choriambic lines run thus  In English the attempt to write such a line results as follows  The Latin measure is stately the English is a delicate dance time   Cette rose à ton corsage  Vers Libre whose rhythmic subtleties may be only at thc beginning of their development is a demand for greateri freedom of movement within the bar and the line In the following examples quoted by Charles Vildrac in his Notes sur la Technique Poétique the four bars or feet in each are of the same length while the number of syllables varies from two to six  Cette fleur rouge a ton col entr ouvert  André Salmon Oh elles existent elles attendent Ils n auraient qu à choisir ils n auraient qu à prendre Charles Vildrac  The above analysis is I repeat elementary and perhaps too conservative in attempting to adhere somewhat to the old classification My own feeling is that the familiar terms iambic anapaestic etc might better be thrown away and a system of musical notation observed more in accordance with musical laws But though the practice of centuries cannot be changed at once it may be subjected to question Poetic technique is still a mediaeval province unillumined by modern scientific research  The analysis of poetic rhythm on the basis of musical notation seems so obvious as to make it incredible that Sidney Lanier should have been the first to apply it to English verse Poets usually think too little about the elements and laws of that verse music which must be   an instinct with them A closer study would enrich their own rhythms and greater zeal in acquainting the public with the technique of poetry would increase the general understanding of the art More scientific knowledge of this subject is necessary in order to remove English poetry from the rack of accentual prosody and restore it to the great universal laws of rhythm to which all music and the poetry of all languages must consciously or unconsciously conform H M  PEALS OF IRON  Fire and Wine by John Gould Fletcher Grant Richards London The Dominant City by John Gould Fletcher Max Goschen London  Sing O ye poets sing on Of golden summer s gales Of patented magic casements And copyright nightingales  Thus Mr Fletcher in the earlier book while he still sat under the aegis of Verlaine Mr Fletcher has left that aegis He has left his native Arkansas It is five years since he took that step which would seem to be almost imperative for any American who has serious intentions toward poetry He left the virgin republic of the west as a duckling departs from a hen For five years he has kept an indifferent silence and now with an   equally indifferent bravura he puts forth five volumes at once some of them or at least some parts of them good and at least one of them important  And I did not rush To print my teething pains he says in an earlier work Whatever lines in these books may be classified under that title have been given out with deliberation Yet having been convinced by The Dominant City that this author is not wholly a fool one is heartened for the search of the other books And even these are not without their charm are not without touches of beauty of mockery and of grimness Here is an author set to portraying the real he is contemporary he has heard of the city of Paris and even if his book had been written in French it would not be called old fashioned I his would be bad enough in an Englishman but in an American in a compatriot of five thousand professors of literature who have never heard of any French author since Béranger it is wholly and simply appalling Mr Fletcher s English is not always good for he is trying to use the speech of his time which renders him inelegant and he does not escape all the prevalent faults of his continental contemporaries that is to say he falls into rhetoric and into using abstractions Yet he talks about a factory as if it were a factory and not a mytho  logical beast He can at his best be concrete and grim and specific He still likes to lump his griefs and    things of that sort into some general term and he still writes of life hope pleasure death lust and that sort of thing but so does the great Verhaeren At least Mr Fletcher has never mentioned  Le bondissant tocsin des vérités vivantes  As with Barzun s Hymne des Forces I have here come upon a work that moves me although my own canons suffer violence E P  NOTES  The great Oriental poet who has just
