robes of kings The low lying mountains sleep at the edge of the world The forests cover them like mantles Day and night Rise and fall over them like the wash of waves  Asleep they reign Silent they say all Hush me O slumbering mountains Send me dreams   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  WHITE  Purple mountains oh purple and blue Rippling under the sky And against them nearer and brighter The many colored trees  With tasseled boughs uplifted  And flowery young leases  And before me trailing down the slope  The dogwood like a snow nymph  Leads the filmy robed Spring  THE OAK  The old oak lets fall its crimson leaves  Tiny fuzzy leaves  Drooping shivering  Tender as a babe new born  The hard old oak  Brother of the wind  Friend of storms  Shakes out young leaves like a thin pale veil  Of rose and mauve  That shades the sun for him  And fluttering flickering  Softens the breeze   Harriet Monroe  Is it a new new world That rosy baby leaves So tender Should droop from the brown old oak A new new world  AZALEAS  Spread them wide Lovely ladies Spread your skirts wide Pink and white Oh fair and chaste  Flutter down the mountain Rest in the wood Gold and red fire Oh eager and warm  Gather in the hollows  Shine in the shade  Come in rings  Come in crowds  Storm the shy coverts And the gloomy glades The sun will fish for you  Through the pine tops  The rain will jewel you  As you dance in the wind   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  THE MOCKING BIRD  I hear a thousand thousand tremors Of clear water Falling lacily in the sun I hear one two seven shivers Of deep bells Ringing under the sea I hear a chiming oí soldiers in bright armor Riding up a hill Oh far away far away I hear sweet words silver words Musically dashing down From the tune locked lips of lovers Up in Heaven I hear  Is it you brown bird  THE FRINGE BUSH  Delicate white fringe bush blossom Drooping among pale leaves In the deepest wood Why do you hide your secret You are the ghost of a lilac Revisiting the world   Harriet Monroe  TH E LAUREL  The mountain laurel moves in rosy cloud drifts Over the wood s brown floor Cumulousi masses Rounded Tipped with crimson Foam up from the dark preen leaves More and more Like the sweep of bright spoil over the blue When the storm has gone They move over and under The sunshine and shadow Capturing the new blown Summer  As she walks in the wood  MY PORCH  My porch stands high And between the floor and the roof the apple tree Shoots in its green branches The blossoms are gone But silver sunlight dapples the leaves And little apples are rounding in the shadows Below me in the garden Young shoots make green lines in the tawny soil Little peach trees border it With three dark pines behind them   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  And beyond blue and green through the new washed air Curves upward the crest of a hill Against the pale blue sky  So sweet so still Hardly a breeze is blowing To rustle the shining leaves At peace is the round green world At peace Everywhere  THE MOUNTAINEER S WIFE  Twelve miles Twelve miles in the cool o th mornin But look such a tiny baby He s five weeks a ready she snuggled him close in her  arms But I couldn quite leave him with the othah children Others she looked so young Her milky brow and blue gentian eyes O cou se six an Co nelia an Jim ah lots o help Las wintah when they couldn go to school Couldn t go to school Coz twas too fah an they had no shoes See they made these nice little baskets Jus like my big ones   Harriet Monroe  Oh yes the baskets you came all these miles to sell them We jus had to have money t rent a plow Or else we won t have no co n It s plantin time  But your husband he sat there lumpish Her voice grew soft as the pink petalled wind In the apple blossoms He nevah c d sell no baskets Besides I couldn let him come alone  THE ROSE BUSH  Old Mammy Jones I came to see your rose bush Come right up sonny Why does your rose bush grow so taller and prouder Than any white people s roses Dunno sonny ask de good Lo d Look it has a thousand arms And they carry a million roses In their baskets of leaves Over your roof Mammy Jones Into your porch into your wood shed Pushing and crowding out everything From the ground to the sky As round as the world  It s to trim my ole cabin up sonny   gt  My mother has a garden Mammy Jones With nice little rose bushes in it That the gardener trimmed And this morning there were pink and yellow buds And lots of green ones But not roses and roses like yours Way up for God to smell em In the sky Why is it Mammy Jones  Dunno sonny praps de good Lo d like Mammy Jones Praps he give a bouquet to his gal  THE QUESTION  They were sauntering down the red road As I passed them The round lipped black woman and her child And the child was saying Why s white folks better n us Mammy What s white folks anyhow  THE MEETING  The ox team and the automobile Stood face to face on the long red road The long red road was narrow At the turn of the hill   Harriet Monroe  And below was the sun dancing river Afoam over the rocks  The mild mannered beasts stood pat chewing their cud The stubble bearded man from the mountains Rustier than his wagon Unmoving eyed the proud chauffeur The little ragged girl With sun bleached hair Sitting on a hard yellow powdery bag Looked across at the smart motor hats of the ladies And their chiffon scarfs That the light breeze fingered  The proud chauffeur blew his horn But nothing moved Except the foaming sun dancing river down below  Then he jerked his head And turned his wheel And slowly carefully The automobile moved back over the long red road  And the mild mannered beasts lifted their feet And the stubble bearded man flipped his rein And the ragged little girl looked ahead up the hill And the ox team lumbered and limped over the long red  road   APRIL NORTH CAROLINA  Would you not be in Tryon Now that the spring is here When mocking birds are praising The fresh the blossomy year  Look on the leafy carpet Woven of winter s browns Iris and pink azaleas Flutter their gaudy gowns  The dogwood spreads white meshes So white and light and high To catch the drifting sunlight Out of the cobalt sky  The pointed beech arid maple  The pines dark tufted tall Pattern with many colors The mountain s purple wall  Hark what a rushing torrent Of crystal song falls sheer Would you not be in Tryon Now that the spríng is here  Harriet Monroe   GAS LAMP GHOST  Out of the blue gray dusk  He comes  The ghostly one The gray one  Driving his ghostly wagon  Nearer he comes and nearer  Silent  Except for his singing flower  That burns a violet hole in the air That melts a violet hole in the snowy dusk  He comes with a flower of burning mist On the tip of a copper stalk He comes with a misty flower that sings And burns a violet hole In the blue gray dusk  He touches dark stems in a row He tips them with his hot mist flower Stem after stem And one by one They bloom and glow And have white flowers on them And burn pale blue holes green ghastly holes  In the silent air In the blue gray snowy dusk   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  SONG IN EARLY APRIL  The gray clouds weep on the brown grass The sun is bright upon one little hill The wind is bleak alas And the song sparrow still  A hawk screams from the gray sky A frog pipes one small note from the bare marsh I saw a sea gull like a ship sail by And his voice was wild and harsh  The hillsides are all streaked with little rills I saw a patch of ice beneath a ledge A snowbird on a bare twig trills And a robin in the hedge  I found a pink moth and his wings were numb I found some green buds under the dead grass I tried to sing a song but I was dumb The wind is bleak alas  Richard Hunt   WHEN SINGING APRIL CAME  When singing April came the land awoke And love of liberty perennial Pushed up its costly crimson through the sod In every sheltered garden April sang As ever matings of unnumbered birds And all the shy and sweet imaginings Of woods and fields the beauty and the hope Of the live world but piercing clear and sad In the swift wind and in the vibrant light Even in the throbbing notes of orioles She sang of death and rang a challenge out And the red flower flamed high beneath her words  Oh sorrow for the shining wind swept highways of the  sea They are made foul with blood Oh sorrow for the beauty of earth For glowing orchards and quivering fields For jeweled cities humming in the sun They are laid waste and desolate Oh sorrow for the beauty of young souls Hiding their vessels of fire beneath their cloaks The great wind has torn their mantles away And filled the heaven with burning And wrapped them in a winding sheet of flame  Isabel McKinney   BERKSHIRES IN APRIL  It is not spring not yet But at East Schaghticoke I saw an ivory birch Lifting a filmy red mantle of knotted buds Above the rain washed whiteness of her arms  It is not spring not yet But by Hoosick Falls I saw a robin strutting Thin still and fidgetty Not like the puffed complacent ball of feathers That dawdles over the cidery autumn loam  It is not spring not yet But up the stocky Pownal hills Some springy shrub a scarlet gash on the grayness Climbs flaming over the melting snows  It is not spring not yet But at Williamstown the willows are young and golden Their tall tips flinging the sun s rays back at him And as the sun drags over the Berkshire crests The willows glow the scarlet bushes burn The high hill birches shine like purple plumes A royal head dress for the brow of spring It is the doubtful unquiet end of winter And spring is pulsing out of the wakening soil  Clement Wood   SPRING NEW MEXICO  Spring crept over the purple hills Over the yellow sun baked sands  No wild music of April rills  But her hands Slim and wanton and softly white  Waved in the windy cloudless night  Spring danced over the cactus plains Vaguely tender in timid green Veiled in the sudden fleeting rain s Silver sheen No mad riot of buds and yet Wild red poppies and mignonette Flung from her floating garland gown Fluttered down  Spring fled out of the panting South Drooping eyelids and burning mouth Blown gold hair and a robe of mist Desert kissed  Rose Henderson   BLUE SQUILLS  How many million Aprils CUM Before I ever knew How white a cherry bough could be A bed of squills how blue  And many a light foot April When life is done with me Will lift the blue flame of the flower And the white flame of the tree  Oh burn me with your beauty then Oh hurt me tree and flower Lest in the end death try to take Even this glistening hour  O shaken flowers O shimmering trees O sunlit white and blue Wound me that I through endless sleep May bear the scar of you  Sara Teasdale   THREE POEMS  WHEN I AM OLD  I still shall love the spring when I am old The whisper of April rain Through grey green days upon my window pane Shall speak as now of mornings bright and fine The days of gold When sticky buds bursting with leafy wonder Turn every one into a gay cockade Worn tilted up or tilted under Those twisty April branches bare of shade  Though every April night is a green frame For lovers they but fit the old design Earth never has outworn And without envy I shall say Nodding my head It used to be the same In my own day  TO A CHILD  Beauty the dream that I have dreamed so much Comes true in your quick smile And on your cheek I see her touch And sometimes in your eyes awhile Immortal Beauty s fleeting image lies   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Dear child in whose veins beat The marching centuries of lovers feet All those brave ardent ghosts in you arise The souls who loving Beauty gave you birth With a chain of passion binding Beauty to earth A captured dream these souls breathe with your breath Living again in Beauty that knows no death  TO A POET  Strangely you say The uttermost life has for you In your own day Blossoms and dies there can ensue No further power Longing achievement or unrest Beyond the hour Earth takes your body to her breast  So you devise A diamond immortality And crystallize Your soul in metric jewellery Well let it shine Quaint relic of a past which lingers Children of mine May touch it with warm living fingers  Marjorie Allen Seiffert   THE SILVER MUSIC  In Chepstow stands a castle My love and I went there The foxgloves on the wall all heard Her footsteps on the stair  The sun was high in heaven And the perfume in the air Came from purple cat s valerian But her footsteps on the stair Made a sound like silver music Through the perfume in the air  Oh I m weary for the castle And I m weary for the Wye And the flowered walls are purple And the purple walls are high And above the cat s valerian The foxgloves brush the sky But I must plod along the road That leads to Germany  And another soldier fellow Shall come courting of my dear And it s I shall not be with her With my lips beside her ear For it s he shall walk beside her   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  In the perfume of the air To the silver silver music Of her footstep on the stair  THE SANCTUARY  Shadowed by your dear hair your dear kind eyes Look on wine purple seas whitened afar With marble foam where the dim islands are We sit forgetting For the great pines rise Above dark cypress to the dim white skies So clear and black and still to one great star The marble dryads and the veined white jar Gleam from the grove Glimmering the white owl flies In the dark shade   If ever life was harsh Here we forget or ever friends turned foes The sea cliffs beetle down above the marsh And through sea holly the black panther goes And in the shadows of this secret place Your kind dear eyes shine in your dear dear face  Ford Madox Hueffer   IS IT WORTH WHILE  Dear were you ever here It has all grown so faint Just reminders Like the squeak of a bat the chirp of a starling on the rim  of the chimney outside As I lie in bed of a morning The cry of a new born kitten Or the crawling of a beetle on a slate As I sit out in the warm summer evenings  Yet there are traces Less intangible There is the dear little amateur letter box You put in yourself for me The knots you made for me in the hammock cords The marks of your burnt cigarette ends That blemish the corners of tables and shelves  Well well One throws away garments one destroys photographs That remind one Is it worth while to give up a house Because of such slight aura As these  Violet Hunt   RUSSIA  To R N Linscott  I  62 A D Darkness broods over the east Over the plain the land of horses Darkness and wintry silence And death  The Northmen But a blue white light from the north  enter Russia  Suddenly flares up at midnight  And in the glare on the horizon  A horseman rides alone  He sits on his great white horse  A strong white bow is in his hands  Beneath his gold horned helmet  Thick braids of golden hair descend  He goes forth conquering and to conquer He goes forth seeking a golden crown From the frozen marshes of the north To where the rivers bend south eastward  Rurik Sineus A brood of lions follow him  and Truvor and their descendShaggy haired with broad golden manes  ants found great cities Eaters of sheep  Founders of cities  In the depths of the steppe   The cities contend with each other for the mastery  1224 A D  The Tatars  suddenly in  vade Russia  John Gould Fletcher  Upon the banks of broad

the dawn Red and fearful  From the south east Runs a red horse Foam drips from his bridle bits His hoof withers the grass   Dark is the man Who rides on him Clad in black armor Lean and yellow his lace  He carries a great black sword With which to smite the people He has power to take peace from the earth That men may kill each other  Under the yoke The princes pass They are his oxen He their

Noonday and a loud sound of bells Pealing and crying That the Third Rome is born  Out of the great red gates Of the Third Rome Rides a man in scarlet Mounted upon a black horse  A golden cross is on his breast A pair of scales is in his hand With which to measure and fit the earth With which to weigh the people s grain  A measure of wheat for a penny And three measures of barley for a penny See that thou hurt not oil or wine See that the land is tilled  But woe to thee city of Pskov Woe to thee Lord Novgorod The weight of the law of the Third Rome Shall break your liberty  Woe to thee people of Rus Who set at nought the scales of law North east south west you shall wander But never find a home   POETRY A  1603 A D The Troublous Times  Rise of the House of Romanov Peter the Great 1689 1725  Magazine of Verse  IV  Darkness broods over the east Over the plain that land of horses Darkness and wintry silence And death  Far away to the west Hangs a great crimson fire It is the sunlight departing Over the plain  Out of the west there rides The horseman of the twilight The great pale horseman Whose name is Death  And he carries in his hand A lash of thongs And he has power to slay With hunger  And the eagles of the west Pass after him Sea eagles unsated Fan with their dark wings his face  Darkness settles faster Upon the plain But the man on the gaunt grey horse Rides on   Founding of Petrograd the third capitalof Russia  Oppressive rule stirrings of revolt  John Gould Fletcher  On to the north Where a blue white light faintly glimmers Over the black pine forests Over the frozen seas  Two cities have long ago fallen But there is one city to found yet A city of dreary phantoms A city of death  At the edges of the north At the borders of the locked sea The pale horse rears And stands  Darkness total darkness And in the darkness Furiously from east to west The winds go forth to battle  v  But the souls of them that were slain  And buried beneath the granite  Rise up again at midnight And cry their final cry  How long how long the darkness How long wilt not avenge us  For here our blood is written On every inch of soil   POETRY  1917 A D  Revolution  A Magazine of Verse  For here our cause is crushed Under the hoofs of proud horsemen For here our cause is forgotten Dead in the utter darkness  So they cry all together And only the silence answers But the power of that silence Has given them power to live  And they go out to the streets of the city To speak to all hearts at midnight How the last seal will be loosened The final trumpet blown  VI  Dawn comes out of the east Dawn with a tumult of flying horses White clouds of springtime Careering galloping  Stallion on stallion charging Westward to the horizon But in the midst of them Rides Liberty unbound  Her tossing golden hair Is mingled with the sea of manes Her voice cries On you wild ones Stop not nor falter   Out of ten thousand trenches A million weary eyes Shall see her pass across the plains And cry Come faster  A million starving ones Shall smile at her Shall stretch out their cold hands to her Before they die  A million broken ones Shall make their bodies The pathway for her feet  A million eager ones Shall leap forth from their trenches To follow her command  Like a white flame that gathers force She shall fill all the land With song of victory  Like the great flame of noon She shall spread out her wings And grant us all we longed for could not find The peace surpassing human understanding  John Gould Fletcher  March 16 I917 1 15 p m  POETRY A Magazine of Verse  COMMENT  DR PATTERSON ON RHYTHM  RHYTHM the universality of the principle its scientific basis its application in the arts especially in the speech arts has always fascinated me Of course it is an element of unalterable law from the electron to the most enormous sun in space every object moves rhythmically in vibrations or pulsations or orbits hastened or retarded between incredible extremes of slow or swift All life is governed by heart beats and the arts are man s effort to respond to the universal impulse his effort to create movement in time or to mark off color rhythms and space rhythms in patterns which suggest that movement  From childhood I have groped among rhythms strongly felt but difficult to analyze Many of them are beyond the scope of this inquiry they would lead us far afield but among them I have speculated long and often on the rhythmic laws that govern verse prose and speech laws which these phenomena of human utterance can not escape It has seemed to me obvious that not verse alone is rhythmical but that prose also whether on the page or the tongue is bound to follow the universal law is set to a pattern of time intervals which it must unconsciously fulfil And it has seemed to me strange that whereas musical notation is in effect a scientific analysis a kind of picturing of the rhythms of music neither verse nor prose has been scientifically presented in any exact system of notation Science which has   Dr Patterson On Rhythm  been speculating during the past century in almost every other direction had apparently neglected to investigate language rhythms for of course the puerile systems of verse scansion inherited from our ancestors are as unscientific and out of date as pre Galileo astronomy  So it is like going home after a long journey to read The Rhythm of Prose by Dr William Morrison Patterson of the English department of Columbia University published by the university press a book which I would have read a year ago if some incorrigible borrower had not snatched it out of reach and mind So science has been invading at last my favorite field indeed she has been building up during the last twenty years quite a bibliography on the subject while I ignorant of the German language and of journals of psychology and philology have been groping along with only Lanier s Science of English Verse for a basis a book which began the discussion in 1880 Dr Patterson fully informed in all this literature possesses also a scientific mind and scientific instruments for making photographic and phonographic records of the human voice in its utterance of both verse and prose  I am quite out of sympathy with those sensitive poetic souls who resent this intrusion of science The truth can do no harm and in this case it must do incalculable good in the enrichment of our sense of rhythmic values The poet of the future discarding the wilful empiricism of the past and proceeding upon exact knowledge will greatly develop and enrich our language rhythms just as music rhythms are   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  being developed and enriched by composers fully educated in their art who add knowledge and training to that primal impulse of heart and mind which we call genius The poet hitherto has worked in the dark or at least in a shadow land illumined only by his own intuition Henceforth science will lend her lamp she will hand him the laws of rhythm just as she hands to the painter the laws of light and color or to the architect the laws of proportion and stress  Dr Patterson has the true scientific spirit without prejudice he is investigating and recording He writes  I laugh at the way that some of my readers continue to size me up I mean those who object to scientific investigation of our mental processes They seem to think I lack feeling all the time that I am bursting with it That s why I am trying to be slow and clear  He records his pleasure in finding at least one poet in sympathy with his quest and I am sure there are others  Indeed only the expense of journeys to New York has kept the present editor from direct co operation He writes  The vigorous and attractive personality of Miss Amy Lowell who has recently been to my laboratory where I made phonographic and photographic records of sections of her free verse readings has warmed me up to a desire more burning than ever to straighten out the psychological facts of vers libre What I am after is the truth and the proper data for establishing it Nothing is more encouraging in such a quest than to find Miss Lowell of her own initiative wishing to cooperate with me in this undertaking On the other hand nothing would be more depressing to me than to be considered out of sympathy with the spirit of the new poetry whatever may turn out to be the truth about its form In any case I insist on always being a champion of the contemporary and the vital at the expense of the effete After all my theory of rhythm is in many ways a radica one and what I have in the back of my head as the development of it is still more radical   Long life to these researches Dr Patterson has made a good beginning and I read his book with complete sympathy and accord except when he tries to draw with more or less definiteness a line between the rhythms of prose and verse calling the former syncopated and the latter coincident or as he puts it  Language is regarded as rhythmically prose so long as syncopation and substitution predominate over coincidence between the accented syllables and an under unit series of subjective time intervals When coincidence predominates language is rhythmically verse  This seems to me an effort to explain a difference which does not exist I wish he would throw all such distinctions into the scrap heap where the old metrical distinctions iambic trochaic dactyllic anapaestic etc must be thrown by every modern mind not because they are entirely false but because they are inexact and are moreover inextricably associated with false usage so that the subject of poetic rhythms requires a new notation and nomenclature  I find syncopated rhythms in verse metrical as well as free and coincident rhythms in prose and a somewhat prolonged and diversified study of the subject inclines me to say that no absolute line can be drawn between the rhythms of verse and prose They fade into each other by gradations so slight as to be indistinguishable If we confine our inquiry to English and begin let us say with the sharply defined iambics and systematized caesuras of Pope we glide unconsciously through numerous stages into the freer larger rhythms of Shakespearean or Miltonic blank verse From these it is but a step to the varied rhythms of the best   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  free verse from these but another step to the finest poetic prose the Gettysburg speech for example The next rhythmic step from this brings us to more conscious oratory Webster s reply to Hayne is an example and from this we could pass gradually toward the pitter patter rhythms of common journalese the tum te tum of cheap verse and before long complete the circle back to Pope again  The anapaests of Shelley and Swinburne the carefully weighed spondaic dactyllics of Meredith would fall into the circle as four time variations of a pattern usually three time in English verse but accepting four time more readily in prose And the various lyric forms are but the weaving of closer patterns  I maintain that each step in the above process marks a difference of degree merely The commonest talk or journalese falls inevitably as Sievers says into sprech takte or speech bars with a tendency to equal duration And in the greatest poetry ever written we have merely this same assembling of time units only they are more adroitly assembled and grouped with a more conscious measuring of syllables and weighing of stresses The underlying rhythmic principle is the same I repeat in both prose and verse  The rhythmic difference scientifically speaking between verse and prose is rather I should say in the grouping of time units let us call them by the musical term bars rather in the grouping of bars which is cadence than in syncopation or coincidence within the bar itself In verse and more or less in poetic prose the cadence tends to return   upon itself to effect what Miss Lowell calls a curve It is the sweep of this secondary rhythm which counts which makes the distinction between poetic and prose rhythms And this secondary rhythm is no more occult in good free verse than it is in good metrical verse  Dr Patterson talks a little wildly I think in his chapter headed Vers Libre Either vers libre has been badly read into his instruments which is all too probable or he accepts as vers libre some of its hopelessly prosy modern manifestations As editor of this magazine I sympathize with him hundreds of outpourings of chopped prose quite innocent of poetic cadence arrive at this office every month which if rhythmically analyzed would indeed give one the sensation of a jumping back and forth from one side of the fence to the other It is to be hoped that Miss Lowell will continue to help him in this detail both in selection and in the actual readings for his experiments indeed he admits that her co operation has been a valuable aid All poets should assist so far as possible for I cannot over emphasize the importance of these investigations  As a student of the rhythms of prose Prof Patterson is less hampered by precedent by out worn definitions and prei udices his thought moves more freely and is therefore more completely illuminating If he will only go a step further and cast aside all the old impedimenta of the empiric and discredited science of prosody he will start afresh in his study of rhythms with verse claiming no class but fighting for precedence on the same basis as prose   It is hardly necessary to say that Prof Patterson s book and the above remarks on the subject concern rhythms alone and none of the other elements emotion tone color sound quality etc which unite with rhythm to make up poetic beauty and to assert the distinction between poetry and prose H M  A NOTE ON T S ELIOT S BOOK  It might be advisable for Mr Eliot to publish a fangless edition of Prufrock and Other Observations for the gentle reader who likes his literature like breakfast coffee or grapefruit sweetened A mere change in the arrangement of the poems would help a little It might begin with La Figlia che Piange followed perhaps by the Portrait of a Lady for the gentle reader in his eagerness for the customary bit of sweets can be trusted to overlook the ungallantry the youthful cruelty of the substance of the Portrait It may as well be admitted that this hardened reviewer cursed the poet in his mind for this cruelty while reading the poem and just when he was ready to find extenuating circumstances the usual excuses about realism out came this drunken helot one can hardly blame the good English reviewer whom Ezra Pound quotes with that ending It is hard to get over this ending with a few moments of thought it wrenches a piece of life at the roots  As for the gentle reader this poem could be followed by the lighter ironies of Aunt Nancy the Boston Evening Transcript etc One would hardly know what to do with   A Note on T S Eliot s Book  the two London pieces Whistler in his post impressionistic English studies and these poems are not entirely unlike Whistler s studies had the advantage of his more static medium of a somewhat more romantic temperament and of the fact that the objects he painted half hid their ugliness under shadows and the haze of distance But Eliot deals with life with beings and things who live and move almost nakedly before his individual mind s eye in the darkness in the early sunlight and in the fog Whatever one may feel about sweetness in literature there is also the word honesty and this man is a faithful friend of the objects he portrays altogether unlike the sentimentalist who really stabs them treacherously in the back while pretending affection M M  SEND AMERICAN POETS  Why not send poets to the front Not to the trenches for active service where many of them now are but as official government agents to see and to record this war for future generations The newspaper correspondent has an official position there are official camera men official moving picture photographers why not poets in a similar capacity As a matter of fact Italy has D Annunzio at the front John Masefield and Rudyard Kipling have visited western and eastern fronts and published their impressions why not American poets It is true that both Masefield and Kipling have written their impressions in prose with the exception of their early restrained poems on the war the   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  poem on this war that will live can not be born save by slow gradual accumulative process But both men in their prose have exhibited a sensitiveness to impressions far exceeding that of the ordinary correspondent they have given us more than journalism  What big magazine will be progressive enough to send an American poet to the front as an accredited correspondent Mr Ring Lardner has been over for Collier s I wish Collier s would send Carl Sandburg or Edgar Lee Masters or Vachel Lindsay over  If we realized sufficiently the importance of our literary men our literature would be a more vital and intimate part of our lives and it would be increasingly virile It is worth noting that our poetry is now in closer touch with our lives than any other form of native art A C II  REVIEWS  TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN  Al Que Quiere by William Carlos Williams Four Seas Co  As preface to these poems the publishers have been I think foolish in dealing the gentle reader as they are pleased to call him a kind of blow over the head They advertise the book as brutally powerful and scornfully crude They intimidate one with the magnificent news that Mr Williams doesn t give a damn for your opinion and that his opinion of you is more important than your opinion of him They end by venturing to predict that the poets   of the future will dig here for material as the poets of today dig in Whitman s Leaves of Grass In passing what baseness these pretty publishers impute to the poets the depravity of the apache off to the battle field for all detachable property  It seems a pity that Mr Williams indifference should have extended quite to this introduction Just a slight remonstrative damn might have escaped him to save a delightful volume from a foreword that hangs too oppressively over it and deprives one of intrinsic pleasure in the poems Unavoidably they appear for judgment in the heavy light of this challenge which has the further fault of being misleading  One would expect to find in Al Que Quiere despite its brief number of pages a veritable tour de force a kind of poetic Woolworth Building massing magnificently on the horizon but to the closer eye perhaps inexpressive harsh from sheer neglect of detail One looks in vain however for enormous violent shapes and finds instead poetry of the sparer more meticulous sort at its best fibrous marvelously observant delicate haunting then at moments stilted confused obtuse Many of the poems concern themselves with pure sensation again they seem doctrinal in character truth in compact form often most deftly handled  Love is so precious my townspeople that if I were you I would have it under lock and key like the air or the Atlantic or like poetry   But at times more vulnerable sententious even  Meanwhile the old man who goes about gathering dog lime walks in the gutter without looking up and his tread is more majestic than that of the Episcopal minister approaching the pulpit of a Sunday  These things astonish me beyond words  Very charming but why this feigned astonishment when obviously rain and wind would contribute to majesty more than divinity schools One should however let that pass for usually Mr Williams is at great pains to be authentic He leans far out in fact to capture in some snare of words those more intricate sensations that nearly baffle expression and often he succeeds Trees for example save for too easy an adverb in the third line seems a feat of accuracy  And when he has failed in this quest for the precise thought the elusive difficult detail when his verse lacks content or suppleness it is rarely through semblance of carelessness He appears in fact to have the conscience of the great artist only as yet to lack the supreme ease His very failures contradict the qualities indicated in the foreword Not untrammelled enough to give any consecutive impression of power he is too punctilious to be thought of as brutal too scrupulous to be often crude His concern one feels has been at least to keep intact the complexion of the poem The most unwilling words have been brought to   To Whom it may Concern  gether and touched up with the cosmetics of style until often they possess that air of greater distinction which ugliness has over prettiness Only occasionally does he drop his devices as in the final section of January Morning or seem to relax as in Ballet Russe when one gets the shock of a bad nut among many more difficult to get at perhaps but palatable For the most part his reverence for tone is unremitting and his reward frequent Observe the lovely bloom of a poem like this  I know only the bare rocks of today In these lies my brown sea weed green quartz veins bent through the wet shale in these lie my pools left by the tide quiet forgetting waves on these stiffen white star fish on these I slip bare footed Whispers of the fishy air touch my body Sisters I say to them  Not many of the poems seek quite this fluid beauty Their virtue lies rather in the native weathered quality of the words like that of stones in untouched places and they have the same fragmentary strength They give at moments the effect of hardness of fine reality but when the thought becomes too bold too intricate or too emotional to manage prettily evidently rather than mar the surface of the poem Mr Williams has resorted to the obscure and the cryptic This refuge of course has just now the virtue or the vice as one looks at it of being distinctly the fashion Writers are doing it this season and Al Que Quiere doubtless will strengthen the inclination But no matter how sparse   or veiled certainly the design should never be broken or blurred and poems like M B and Keller Gegen Dom are I think insecurely elliptical Virtue possibly by the same token becomes confused and ill at ease though the first strophe is keen beyond most of the book  Sometimes perhaps Mr Williams suffers from the curse of self consciousness He allows one for example to fall under the spell of heavy fragrant music like this  None has dipped his hand in the black waters of the sky nor picked the yellow lilies that sway on their clear stems and no tree has waited long enough nor still enough to touch fingers with the moon  Then as if suddenly aware of too solemn a face he changes brusquely to a lighter key and the end is all too arch  I looked and there were little frogs with puffed out throats singing in the slime  Yet if these poems do not give the impression of titanic power or of consistent mastery they offer certainly a fine assortment There is hardly a poem that somewhere has not edge and poignancy and there are very few in which certain lines certain words do not graze one with the wings of reality More than a dozen one is tempted to quote as complete and without flaw One of these Chickory and Daisies seems to indicate the very task Mr Williams had set himself  Lift your flowers on bitter stems   To Whom it may Concern  chickory Lift them up out of the scorched ground Bear no foliage but give yourself wholly to that  Strain under them you bitter stems that no beast eats and scorn greyness Into the heat with them cool luxuriant sky blue The earth cracks and is shriveled up the wind moans piteously the sky goes out if you should fail  Whatever the intention Al Que Quiere does give the sense of a small garden induced to grow in unlikely surroundings on the whole so deep rooted that its bloom should last a long time so native that very likely meaner poets will come to pick what they can some of the blossoms rare and perfect others more like those bright hardy flowers that bloom in high places above timber line  One poem To a Solitary Disciple especially from its twelfth line onward has ease and elegance above the rest rearing itself on a tough tenuous stem to the single freedom  of the last lines  Observe the jasmine lightness of the moon  Dorothy Dudley   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  REFUGE FROM WAR  Reverie A Little Book of Poems for H D by Richard  Aldington The Clerk s Press Cleveland Ohio Lim  ited Edition  An American soldier now in France writes in acknowl  edging a copy of The New Poetry  Certain poems like the Choricos of Aldington have shuddered with me along night roads and through their bold beauty have saved me from terror at moments when one of the great shocks the explosion of an enemy shell the sudden presence of pain or awful agony the nearness of death fell without preface upon me  I remember once particularly in the drab light of a cloudy dawning when I saw near the edge of a road a poilu quietly lying I should have fainted I think from the sheer tragedy of the incident had I not heard singing in my head Aldington s invocation to death  Such a letter proves more sharply than any review the value of a poet s work No later lyric by Aldington can ever dim the Greek marble like beauty of Choricos but neither can that poem dim the more tender and human beauty of Reverie Th e contrast of moods in the two poems bridges the gulf between youth and manhood Choricos which was first printed over five years ago in the second number of POETRY was written while the poet was still in his teens It presents the feeling of adolescence that high and impersonal exaltation not uncommon when noble youth confronts the thought of death  Thou art the silence of beauty And we look no more for the morning We yearn no more for the sun Since with thy white hands   Refuge from War  Death Thou crownest us with the pallid chaplets The slim colorless poppies Which in thy garden alone Softly thou gatherest  Since writing it the poet has experienced love and war love at its highest war at its most terrible He has compassed life from extreme to extreme and after that there is no longer question of youth or age life moves in the larger rhythms of eternity  All men love for a flash a day As I love now But all men do not always love so long Nor find in love the excuse for life The sanction for the bitterness of death Not far away as I now write The guns are beating madly upon the still air With sudden rapid blows of sound And men die with the quiet sun above them And horror and pain and noise upon earth To morrow maybe I shall be one of them One in a vast field of dead men Unburied or buried hastily callously But for ever and for ever In the fair land I have built up Prom the dreams of my love We two are together she bending by the pale flower And I beside her We two together in a land of quiet Inviolable behind the walls of death  This tiny book of nine brief poems contains no murmur against Fate The poet accepts war as he might accept a cyclone in anguish and bitterness of spirit but without revolt He feels no élan no conviction of war s necessity or righteousness but he takes his place in the ranks and does   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  his part with a grim and resolute stoicism And out of his despair out of his hunger for beauty comes a lyric note clearer and richer than anything we have heard from him since those earliest poems and an exaltation of spirit as noble and impassioned as in that votive moment of his youth as noble and impassioned and perhaps more humane  We are of those that Dante saw Glad for love s sake among the flames of hell Outdaring with a kiss all powerful wrath For we have passed athwart a fiercer hell Through gloomier more desperate circles Than ever Dante dreamed And yet love kept up glad  H M  REFLECTED FOLK LORE  Old Christinas and Other Kentucky Tales in Verse by William Aspenwall Bradley Houghton Mifflin Co The Kentucky mountains rich as they are in folk lore  should be a happy hunting ground for poets Old Scotch English ballads persist there in such root forms as the Fuller sisters have not been able to find even in the remote parts of England and there persist also old world legends and traditions The people speak a quaint English fresher than that used in the slang ridden present day world an English often reminiscent of the Elizabethans And they still indulge in romantic blood feuds  Out of this material Mr Bradley has made a series of story poems dealing often with real people and incidents that have actually happened The task he has set himself   Reflected Folk lore  was difficult no doubt and many of his narratives arouse in the mind a protest They are too much modernized smoothed over and fitted to too hard a measure The indigenous quality the mountain flavor is dulled in the process the poems cease to be folk lore and don t quite attain to being modern poetry One longs to take the stuff straight or at least with a stronger flavor of its native wildness  But now and then the stark simplicity of his theme imposes its commands Poems like the last in the book At Parting and the Cumberland ballad Will Warner reduce life to their simplest mountain terms so to speak the former to terms of quiet beauty the latter to terms of primitive violence We quote part of the ballad  Shot in the back in the courthouse square By a dog of a Darrell skulking there Will Warner staggered and clutched the air  Near to his death and his heart grew gray Each of his brothers had passed this way He had paid their score who now would pay  Still as he pondered the unpaid score He saw his mother who stood in the door As she had stood there thrice before  Sombre and silent no word she said But drew the covers down on the bed That had held the living and held the dead  No word she said but on cat s feet crept Through the firelit room where her watch she kept O er her baby her least one who woke and slept  Woke then slept but to wake again Slept with the weakness woke with the pain And a bee that buzzed and boomed in his brain   And only once from his lips came a cry Aw Will quit that If ye ve got to die Die like a Warner with flashing eye  Flung his mother Ere night she had laid him straight And all on her shoulders had borne his weight Up the steep hillside to the grave house gate  She bore him up and she dug him deep And left him alone in the earth to sleep Then stumbled back to the shack to weep  One regrets such things as the o er and ere and all on which belong neither to modern speech nor to the pristine freshness and simplicity which the poet in his preface admires in the mountaineer s somewhat archaic diction Indeed we long throughout the book for more of the authentic racy flavor of their talk if not dialect which Mr Bradley has not attempted to render with any literalness then a certain quality inherited we are told from Elizabethan English But at least these ballads a few of them give us a sharp impression of the morale the life of those marooned groups whom the modern current has passed by  S W  JEAN DE BOSSCHÈRE S POEMS  The Closed Door by Jean de Bosschère Illustrated by the author With a Translation by F S Flint and an Introduction by May Sinclair John Lane London and New York This Frenchman like certain modern poets of our own  language sees the characteristics as of individual life which lurk in inanimate objects and even in situations as well as   in living beings He feels what might be called the soul of these This form of vision is perhaps mysticism but it is entirely apart from though not contradictory to theological mysticism T o one with a developed sensitiveness this form of individuality is a thing as real in this world of illusions as material appearances are Much of Harold Monro s poetry is on this theme and one may trace it in some poems of H D of Pound Eliot and others One can find a slight similarity between Amy Lowell and Jean de Bosschère in the exaggerated form of the expression of their vision though there is a heat and an artistic self abnegation in the French poet which Miss Lowell does not attain perhaps does not wish to attain  Homère Mare for example is a story poem about the attachment of the human soul to the souls of his surroundings and its estrangement from them It has the serene subdued beauty of a sunny pebbled road through a fair country  L Offre de Plebs is probably the most beautiful poem in the volume one can hardly over praise its peculiar beauty The subject is sympathetic with the poet s temperament and its gloom and playfulness express a depth of sensitiveness rarely reached It is the perfect image of a mood desire for solitude and in spite of wistfulness it has no trace of sentimentality  Je veux qu il ait un Dieu Et qu il brûle en sacrifices toutes ses amours Et ses maisons  Et que pour moi son esprit prenne   La robe des moines Close comme la peau des grenouilles Je veux qu il ait un Dieu Il faut que cela soit moi   And  Je ne veux pas d un coeur qui ait aimé  Je ne veux d un ami qui sera hérétique  Il y a la chair et le diable de l esprit  Il y a les arbres et aussi les parfums  Il y a des ombres des souvenirs  Il y a des images des rêves  Et il y a l espoir  Et la douleur  Ulysse Bâtit son Lit is the expression of an individual soul in a small or large village it might be in France Argentina or America for it is everywhere the same The poem is a perfect embodiment of the pettiness of the village spirit which in this case resented a man s way of building his bed God help these bed builders of France Argentina or America  The latter parts of the volume express more personal emotions and are less unlike the work of other poets The themes of Doutes Gridale Verger La Promesse du Merle have been treated in poetry in various forms Doutes and Gridale are in places rhetorical but always lit with a weird and sometimes quaint fire which is the poet s own Parts of them form complete poems like these about his father and mother from Doutes  Il fumait sa pipe avec intégrité On se collait près de lui Pour tirer par le nez son odeur d homme   Jean de Bosschère s Poems  Et la mère était le pain et le beurre La rosée froide de six heures et la cerise Les draps blancs au réséda Et le rond chaud des lèvres sur la joue  In La Promesse du Merle the sombreness is relieved by the lightness of touch Ce n est pas fier de finir Toujours à moitié  De jeter trois notes de feu Qui ouvrent le coeur fané Avec des ézardes de faim et de soif  In this poem as well as in some of the others the poetic height and depth of the emotion sometimes appear strained but that depends on the temperament and even on the mood of the reader  In the illustrations one can find the influence of Kandin sky s black and white haunting patterns often like spilled and partly dried water Also there may be a suggestion of Alfred Kubin compare for instance Kubin s illustrations to his romance with De Bosschère s at the end of Doutes He is trying to escape Beardsley and usually succeeds indeed he is on the whole self expressive One wishes that our American illustrators would give us as intimately as these men their own happy or sombre individualities  The translation is too servile and lacks charm especially toward the end of the book But printing the French and English versions on opposite pages is too severe a test for any translator M M   FRÒDING CLASSIC AND FUTURIST  Gustaf Froding Selected Poems translated from the Swed  ish with an Introduction by Charles Wharton Stork  Macmillan Co  It is the tragic fate of great poets of a small nation to remain strangers to the world outside their own country  On the other hand this tends to strengthen the intimate bond beween the poet writing in a little known language and his reader whose feeling of pride in the ownership of treasures open only to him is however mingled with regret that these can not be widely appraised at their true worth  T o a greater extent perhaps than with any other Swedish poet of rank this is the case of Gustaf Fròding A great universal genius a profound thinker and philosopher he has chosen for the expression of his personality a form which has immeasurably enriched the Swedish language in poetic beauty but to the world at large no interpretation worthy of the indescribable charm of his original art has as yet been given  Mr Charles Wharton Stork s effort to translate into English some of his more popular poems may be the result of very good intentions and a sincere appreciation of the poet but it does not give us Gustaf Frôding Any one of Robert Burns simple little masterpieces will better serve to give an idea of the singing rhythmic perfection in his youthful songs These are written in the dialect of his native prov   Fròding Classic and Futurist  ince Wàrmland whch has been the birthplace of so many of Sweden s most famous writers and holds a place in the hearts of the people like that of Normandie with the French  The close inter action between Fròding s tragic life and his poetry becomes more manifest as his creative development broadens Gloomy brooding foreboding the threatening spectre of insanity to which he at last wholly succumbed permeates the work of his later years  It seems a pity and shows lack of balanced judgment that Mr Stork among several comparatively harmless translations should have tried his hand at the magnificent poem A Dream of the Orient With such a task a born poet would be put to a crucial test Fròding always handles the subject of sex relation with absolute and open honesty but in none of his other poems is physical love pictured in such courageous defiance of all old hide and seek traditions So humanly appealing is the natural simplicity and grandeur of the poem s conception that its frankness does not even astound  There is more promise of an adequate translator in Professor Axel Johan Upvall of Clark College who tried his hand at Fròding in the Poetry Journal of February 1916  It may sound contradictory to assert that Fròding who died in 1911 and who already in his life time was accepted as a classic is an exceedingly modern poet And yet each re reading of his works brings to me the impression that I am receiving something fresh and new He played with rhyme and meter with rhythm and style   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  stamped new words neglected ancient and modern laws in poetry but his form of expression is that of the masters  Svea Bernhard  OUR CONTEMPORARIES  A MODERN FRENCH ANTHOLOGY  The Little Review with Ezra Pound as its spokesman has come to the conclusion that America can no longer conduct its intellectual affairs on a monolingual basis It proposes to print criticism of current French literature as well as English and for a starter devotes its February number to an anthology of modern that is post Gautier French poetry  It isn t often that one can get such an anthology at the price of a magazine nor for that matter at any price since the anthology fever has not hit the French publishers quite as it has the American And Mr Pound s selection is a little more than an anthology In compiling it he found that the poets and heirs who would have to be consulted for permission to reprint were so scattered by the war that he would save time by embedding the anthology in an article The result is a running commentary now facetious now important always contradictory as if to give the reader a number of opinions to choose from but not allowing him to leave any poem without one  The poems themselves make a substantial enough showing to tempt the reader into generalizations on the difference between modern poets here and in France The explorations   of the French poets seem less geographical less external more speculative Au Cabaret Vert of Rimbaud to be sure has local color  Depuis huit jours j avais déchiré mes bottines Aux cailloux des chemins  but even so the more characteristic explorations are found in such a poem as his Chercheuses de Poux a very daring very beautiful adventure into child psychology without the sentimentalization that usually accompanies any thought about children over here or in La Rapsode Foraine of Corbière which explores folk religion In general it seems as if poetry in French and English in spite of the gradual rapprochement of the three nations since Napoleon were never farther apart than now With Byron and Alfred de Musset they were still within shouting distance and so too though by direct importation with Swinburne and Gautier But here are poems which would never tempt the translator However as Mr Pound says he has intentionally chosen the things that would sound freshest to us omitting the Parnassians for instance of whom he says wc have plenty ourselves leaving Gautier Baudelaire Mallarmé Verlaine Samain Heredia to be read in volumes He includes Laforgue Corbière Rimbaud de Gourmont de Régnier Verhaeren Tailhade Jammes Moréas Spire Vildrac Romains a characteristically random list For though he has read other poets and would like very much their friendship the next time he goes to Paris he insists that there are bad poets in French as well as in English S W  POETRY A Magazine of Verse  CORRESPONDENCE  A CONFESSION  Dear Editor At last a guilty conscience brings me to my metaphorical knees I have a confession to make  Several years ago when I went West about the time of the publication of my first little book I was happy in the thought that you had spoken a kindly word or two about it But about that time owing to the fact that I was living through many personal sorrows and anxieties I ceased to write well and began to write very badly I didn t always know it Worse I sent the stuff to editors Still worse I sent it to you You wisely returned it I kept on that was worst of all After a while you probably thought when you did think about me that I would never again write anything worth printing But later partly as the result of a wonderful trip in Oregon with my husband which was a much needed rest and change I began to write again in a new vein poems that very few people would have recognized as mine I had had a new experience and it made new poems for me a series of them I wanted to send them to you and have you read them without any of the psychology of my several failures mixed into the consideration of them
