Exposed American imperialism in Haiti. 2.	 Defended since October, 1919, seventy-nine innocent colored men in Phillips County, Arkansas, gaining a great victory in December when it secured a second reversal by the Arkansas State Supreme Court of the death sentence of six men on constitutional grounds. This will probably result in a reprieve of the remaining six cases. 3.	 Launched a fight on disfranchisement in Congress through the presentation of evidence gained at great expense and effort. These are but a few of the things achieved in 1920. Within the next three months we are going to increase our membership to 250,000. A Quarter of a Million members, with one purpose and with efforts united, will enable us to surpass by far even the accomplishments of the past year.

No. 4 FEBRUARY, 1921 Whole No. 124 Opinion of W. E. B. DU BOIS "Not those who inflict most, but those who suffer most are the conquerors." TERRENCE MCSWINEY. REDUCED REPRESENTATION IN CONGRESS FRIENDS of Democracy and especially friends of over ten million disfranchised persons —white and black—in the South, are called upon today for clear thinking and a knowledge of the facts. This nation is putting a premium upon oligarchy and a -penalty upon democracy. The states can and do control the conditions under which a citizen may or may not vote. By the 15th and 19th Amendments there are only two checks on their power: They cannot legally disfranchise men for race or for sex. They cannot say that a Negro or a woman cannot vote. But—and this fact is often slurred or forgotten—the states can and legally do restrict the suffrage for other reasons, such as length of resi dence, previous registration, ability to read and write, possession of prop erty, etc. Moreover, states can easily disfranchise a whole group by choosing certain characteristics or disabilities of the group: Negroes as a mass are poor and ignorant; a property and literacy qualification will therefore disfranchise a large number, of them ; women are occupied in homes for the most part and not in the so-called "gainful occupations". A restriction of voting to those in such occupations would be undoubtedly legal and would disfranchise 75% of the women. Hitherto democracy in the United States has assumed that self interest would keep the number of voters as large as possible in the various states. This assumption has failed in two respects: It has kept women from voting for more than a century and it has kept Negroes in the South from voting during the better part of a generation. This in itself is bad enough, but the situation is worse when we consider that we have made it distinctly to the advantage of oligarchical rule to disfranchise just as many voters as possible and to do this by legal enactment or by force or public opinion, by economic pressure or by sneering at the efficacy of democratic government. How far this has gone an article in this number of TH E CRISIS shows. We have at present only one legal remedy and that lies in the Fourteenth Amendment. Many persons, and especially Negroes, assume that the enforcement of the section of the second section of the 14th Amendment would make the disfranchisement of Negroes legal. This is absolutely untrue. As long as the 15th Amendment stands, it is absolutely illegal to disfranchise a person because of "race, color or previous condition of servitude". But it is absolutely legal to disfranchise persons for any number of other reasons. Indeed a state might legally disfranchise a person for having red hair. But here the 14th Amendment steps in and says: "But when the right to vote at any election .. . is denied to any of the male inhabitants of such state (being 21 years of age and 149 citizens of the United States) or in any way abridged . . . the basis of representation therein shall be reduced in ... proportion ..." In other words, if for any legal reason a state disfranchises its citizens then the representation of that state in Congress must be proportionately reduced. The Constitution does not attempt to say that the state may not have perfectly good moral ground for such disfranchisement. In sheer self defense it may be proper, temporarily, for a state to disfranchise the ignorant. It might even defend itself, under a just economic system, in disfranchising the poor. But whatever its motives or justification a state can disfranchise its citizens for any reason except race and sex. But if it does it is liable to have its representation in Congress reduced, and indeed if it believes in democratic government it ought to be willing and eager for such reduction. By assenting to such reduction it simply says to its fellow citizens throughout the United States: "We, the voters of South Carolina, do not wish to wield any more political power, man for man, than you voters of North Dakota; and therefore because we have disfranchised most of our adult citizens on account of our wretched public school system and unjust industrial organization, we ask to have our political power curtailed until we can educate our citizens and make a more decent distribution of wealth." But if this assent is due from South Carolina, how much more is a demand called for from the disfranchised Negroes? They have simply to choose between two alternatives: to be tem porarily unrepresented, in Congress or to be perpetually represented by their active and militant enemies. If they are unrepresented, this lack of repre sentation is not and cannot be on ac count of their race and color so long as the 15th Amendment stands. It is simply on account of other qualifica tions or on account of the unfair administration of the law. If the other qualifications are reasonable it is only a matter of time when Negroes will meet them and have their representation restored automatically. If they are disfranchised by unreasonable qualifications or by the unfair administration of the law, they can continue to attack these in the courts and before the public opinion of the nation and the world, and during this fight their enemies will be disarmed of their undue political power and influence. In such case they cannot in the long run fail to triumph. There is absolutely no valid argument against this policy or cause for hesitation. The overwhelming political power of the South, whereby 10,000 voters in Mississippi wield as much political power as 97,000 voters in Indiana, must be changed. The legal remedy is at hand and involves no jot or tittle of surrender of any right or hope of the American Negro. To hesitate is to give to that section of the United States where mobs, lynching, ignorance and murder flourish, four times the political power exercised by the intelligence, thrift, and law-abiding devotion to democracy in the rest of the land. A QUESTION OF FACTS THE December number of TH E CRISIS said in regard to Mrs. Mary B. Talbert, delegate, and Dr. Mary F. Waring, alternate, attending the International Council of Women at Christiania: "At the American Y. W. C. A. in Paris, where the party arrived late in the morning after an all night ride, all the white delegates were welcomed and accommodated while the colored delegates were even refused breakfast." These facts have been denied. First, a sweeping denial was made by the National Office of the Y. W. C. A. in New York at a conference with colored women. Afterward a modification of this denial was furnished certain newspapers and correspondents, OPINION 161 stating that only a part of the delegation was accommodated at the Paris Y. W. C. A. and that hotel accommodation elsewhere was secured for the others including the colored delegates; that Mrs. Talbert's attitude was objectionable; that the other colored delegates were satisfied with their treatment; and that the colored women did not attend the social functions of the party. We have published the brief statement given us by Mrs. Talbert. We now adduce two further witnesses. Mrs. Talbert's party consisted of herself, her daughter, and Dr. Mary F. Waring, of Chicago. Dr. Waring, who looks like a white woman, was given her registration card to stop at the Y. W. C. A. and went into the dining-room. When Mrs. Talbert, who has a good brown face, started to follow, she was refused entrance. Dr. Waring, in a personal letter to Mrs. Talbert, continues the story as follows : "Thinking they were honest and truthful in their statement, 'arrangements have been made for you at another hotel,' you asked, 'Are we the only ones whom arrangements have been made for?' To which she, Miss Dunn, made an evasive answer. Mrs. Keelan (Mrs. Talbert's daughter) and I joined you, and a boy was called who took us across the street, two or three blocks further down. There we were told that they were full (this was a French hotel), and that the Y. W. C. A. had not even asked for any reservation,. nor had any agent for the American party. You asked the proprietor if we could be served coffee. It was near 11 A. M. and we had been riding all night, coming from Geneva, Switzerland, without even a drink of water; he replied that they were through serving until dinner. We returned to the Y . W. C. A., hungry, humiliated and tired, for it was very warm (August 30). We were then told by Miss Dunn again that we could not possibly be accommodated. You protested at such treatment from a Christian association, when we found out that every woman was taken care of there, except those who refused to stay by choice. Those of the party not accommodated included the 8 white men and 3 colored women. "Mrs. Moore and her daughter had been in Paris over a week. They had not wished to stop there. Mrs. Harris, the Vice-President, had also been in Paris for some time and she did not wish to stop there. Not one woman member of the party was turned away, except the 3 colored women. The Y. W. C. A. could shelter all but the men and these three. Miss Dunn was not inclined to compromise, but told us very plainly that we could not stop there. Mrs. Merriman [a white woman, Secretary of the National Council of Women] took her aside and talked very plainly to her and by this time you spoke of them even refusing you a cup of coffee. If they assert that anyone (even Mississippi and Kentucky were mute) objected to our eating, they tell an unmitigated lie. The Y. W. C. A. secretary told one of the members of our party that it was against the policy of the American Woman's Club to accommodate colored people. "You then went to the street and called Mr. Gray (the travelling agent), asking him where Mrs. Moore was stopping. You hired a taxi, and we were driven over there, to a superior hotel, the Avenida, where we received the most cordial treatment. We made our own arrangements with the proprietor. The treatment of the colored people by the Y. W. C. A. is exactly along the lines of their branches in America." Finally we conclude this testimony with the following letter: "Dear Miss Ovington: In answer to your inquiry concerning the reception and treatment accorded Mrs. Mary B. Talbert durin our recent trip abroad I am glad to make the following statement. "I was chairman of the party including the delegates and guests who toured Europe and attended the convention of the International Council of Women at Christiania, Norway, during 1920. In this capacity I was with the party every moment from the time we left the port of New York until we landed on our return voyage; therefore I am cognizant of all happenings and actions that might effect the party as a whole or groups thereof. "Upon our arrival in Paris the entire party was taken to the American Woman's Club, or Hotel Petrograd, which was opcrated by the Y. W. C. A. They had not room to accommodate the entire party so arrangements were made elsewhere for some of the officers and delegates which included the three Negro members. Before leaving for our other hotels we decided to have breakfast at the Petrograd as it was very late. When Mrs. Talbert. one of our delegates and the President of the National Federation of Colored Women's Clubs, started to pass with others through the door into the dining-room, the secretary placed her hand gently on Mrs. Talbert's shoulder and said: 'You cannot go in there.' Mrs. Talbert replied: 'I just want to get a cup of coffee.' The secretary still refused her admission. Mrs. Talbert turned to me with big tears rolling down her cheeks and asked me to tell the secretary that she was an accredited delegate THE CRISIS and entitled to admission. I did so and was informed that they could not allow colored women in the dining-room. Dr. Mary F. Waring, of Chicago, who was the alternate for Mrs. Talbert, was already in the dining-room eating. I drew the secretary's attention to this fact. Dr. Waring was so nearly white that they allowed her to pass, not recognizing that she belonged to the colored race. They then decided to allow Mrs. Talbert and her daughter to go in and have a cup of coffee. "I did not see or hear Mrs. Talbert at any time do or say anything rude or unladylike; on the contrary, her conduct throughout the entire period of three months was above reproach. Exclusive of this incident in Paris, Mrs. Talbert was shown every courtesy accorded any other officer or delegate by all the countries and peoples in Europe. She was one of the five American women chosen to speak to and present a resolution at the International Convention. She was invited to attend every social function that other delegates were invited to, with the exception of the 'Tea' at the Y. W. C. A. in Paris. At the formal state luncheon given by Lady Aberdeen at Haddo Castle, she sat by invitation at the right hand of Her Grace. Mrs. Talbert was present at the farewell banquet at the Hotel Commodore before the party sailed. As toast mistress of the evening I introduced her and she responded in behalf of her people and their work. She received an ovation at this time more pronounced than the majority of the speakers. Mrs. Talbert at all times proved herself a credit to her people and they may well be proud of her as their representative on a tour which was epochal in the history of womankind. "Trusting that this covers all the points mentioned in our conversation and that I may have the privilege of meeting you again, I am, Cordially, (Signed) MYRA VIRGINIA MERRIMAN, Corresponding Secretary, National Council of Women, Chairman of Tour." PHONOGRAPH RECORDS WE have good authority for stating that 65fo of the phonograph records made for the Southern trade by a well-known company are sold to colored people. Nevertheless, this company employs only one colored artist regularly and only occasionally a colored, orchestra or quartet. Al l these musicians are confined strictly to a certain class of music and on no account are they allowed to attempt anything else, no matter what their gifts or ability. This company, however, is much more liberal than most phonograph companies. They have thousands of white singers under contract and pay them hundreds of thousands of dollars annually, and yet no colored singer may apply even for their Negro music. Here is a tremendous field. We have some of the finest voices in the world right here in Negro America. Within the past few months one of the smaller, newer phonograph companies experimented by having a colored girl sing "Blues". The experiment was so successful and the demand for her records among colored folk so great that the company was not able to fill its orders. They have since signed her to sing for them for two years. Now several other concerns are looking for a colored "Blues" singer, but they make it particularly plain that no others need apply. Artists like Roland Hayes have gone in vain to the great phonograph companies. One of them offered to let him do "comic darky songs" but nothing else; while men with much inferior voices are allowed daily to sing the finest music and to debase and ridicule the Negro folk song. Under such discrimination there is but one solution. We have already throughout the land developed a Negro audience to appreciate and pay a dozen or more Negro artists. We have a commendable and growing National Association of Negro Musicians. We must now develop a business organization to preserve and record our best voices; we ought to have records of Burleigh, Hayes, Talbert, Anderson, Johnson, Harrison, Hagan, Dett, Diton and a dozen others to reveal the best music, not only of their own race but of all races and ages. We are pleased to learn that such a company is now forming with adequate capital and skilled management of guaranteed integrity. A PAGEANT OF PROGRESS T. J. CALLOWAY A SHOR T story writer makes one of his amiable characters conclude with the confession that in his efforts to dispense the milk of human kindness he had made it a policy to skim some real cream for his own breakfast. The Negroes of Washington City have been skimming some real cream in the last ten years, but particularly in the last two years since the World War.

C. 153 TH E CRISIS ly estimate that $3,000,000 of real estate has passed into the control of colored people within recent times. The World War was followed in Washington by an aftermath of race riots in 1918. These riots resulted from what appeared to be a conspiracy of the daily newspapers to charge the colored people with a wave of criminal assaults upon women. Flaring headlines telling of "Negro Brutes Assaulting White Women" finally came to the point where one daily actually announced that white men would gather at a certain stated rendezvous to take the law into their own hands. A t this signal white ruffians did gather and set out to invade the colored section. Then a miracle happened. Colored men came together with arms, machine-guns, rifles, pistols, every sort of weapon, and the white mob was met with its own species of lawlessness. Casualties were on both sides, but the Negro section was saved from what might have been a holocaust. The heroes were ex-service men and plain folks who had not been regarded as leaders. The lesson learned was that if Negroes are to survive, they must join hands. The results appear in the figures of property bought and the general spirit of cooperation. To visualize the foregoing generalizations, let us anticipate the completion of the Douglass Theatre, for which a beautiful site has been purchased comprising five properties, 1333 to 1341 U Street, N . W., the actual construction of which is to begin March 5 by the Dudley-Murray Corporation. Let us suppose that the program is a historical pageant representing ten years of business and commercial development in Washington City. The 1800 seats are filled from pit to galleries with an audience, a large proportion of whom are stockholder-patrons of the theatre. The first scene shows Washington inter ested mainly in social life, no confidence in race organization, due to the failure of a savings bank and a large beneficial organi zation. Into this scene walks John W. Lewis, a hod carrier, having actually tramped to Washington with "Coxey's Army". Lewis calls together fellow labor ers and persuades them to organize the Laborers' and Mechanics' Realty Company and to deposit in its treasury their weekly sav ings. They buy ground and with their own hands erect a four-apartment building on Eleventh Street near U Street, then the Hiawatha Theatre next door, and later the Industrial Savings Bank on the corner, and finally the Whitelaw Hotel two squares away. Leading actors in this scene are William A. Bowie, cashier of the bank, and Isaiah T. Hatton, architect and building supervisor. The second scene opens with Dr. W. L. Board's drug store on Fourteenth Street near U Street. The warm evening has brought patrons who are being politely served with their prescriptions and confections. Then follows a meeting of the Colored Druggists' Association, representing twenty-seven stores. The discussion of the evening is on how the small drug store can meet competition of the syndicate drug stores' advertising of cut rates. A plan is adopted to pool the purchasing power of the individual stores and get the savings of a combined buying power. The result is that the twenty-seven members have been able to meet competition and prosper. In scene three the real estate men appear in a hurdle race. Long time renters awake to find the homes they have paid for in rent receipts being sold to new owners who evict them. Landlords decide that the advanced prices in real estate offer propitious time to sell. Deans McKinley and Walker find the race contested by Holland who swung the Southern Aid and the Douglass Theatre deals, by Harris who came from the rear and put over a number of big deals, by DeVeille who made a record on small prop erties and by Scott, Cuney, Flagg, Clarke, Davidson, Mitchell and other dark horses. As the race rounds the third quarter, hun dreds of people are in homes bought at high prices but on which they have paid $500 to $1500 or more. Scene four is a conference of insurance men. Rutherford of the National Benefit Society, Bond of the Standard Life, Jordan of the Southern Aid, and Spaulding of the North Carolina Mutual compare notes and discover that Washington is woefully under- insured. The Southern Aid erects a fine four-story office building to include the Dunbar Theatre, the Standard Life writes many thousands of life insurance, the National Benefit greatly increases its busi ness, and the North Carolina Mutual grows in patronage. The payments of death poli cies provide capital for buying homes and investments in business enterprises. Scene five shows the boys returning from the army, inoculated with the French spirit A PAGNT OF PROGRESS JOHN W. LEWIS, of Equality, Liberty and Fraternity. To "make the world safe for democracy" is more than a fine phrase to these boys who no longer hold death as the worst of evils. Business men find them serious, ambitious and dependable. They enter business and apply to themselves the hard discipline of the army. Enterprises too numerous to catalogue here are opened and" made to succeed. The Hamilton Bros, open a printing office, the Cliffords organize a film company, Ratley and others organize a building and loan company, Curley opens a notion house, Howe runs a pool-room. Bake-shops, shoe-shine shops, taxi service, cafes, dyeing and cleaning shops, etc., are but examples of these men's vision to make their way to the first table in the great business exchange. The last scene represents the story of the Douglass Theatre. F. Morris Murray and his two brothers have entered Washington eighteen years ago as printers, with a little shop. In 1908 they with others opened a little 75-seat moving-picture house at 1217 U Street, N . W., because no moving-picture S. H. DUDLEY theatre conducted by white men would admit colored patrons. They struggle along and grow from that small beginning to the ownership of the Hiawatha, Foraker and Dunbar Theatres in which they are heartily supported. S. H . Dudley, who began his life as a showman when twelve years old and who has entertained audiences in every part of the country, finally settles in Washington where he acquires the S. H . Dudley and Mid-City Theatres and the Dudley Theatre in Petersburg, Va. Dudley and the Murrays discover the need for a first class theatre and decide to join hands and supply it. William A. Bowie, Isaiah T. Hatton and others join them and the Dudley-Murray United Theatre Corporation is incorporated for $500,000 and the stock is being sold to future patrons at $12.50 per share. Negro architects, mechanics and laborers construct the buildings 'and the curtain closes on the completed structure built by Negro capital, managed and owned by Negroes. Every man, woman and child who has witnessed this pageant leaves feeling the self-respect, the enthusiasm and pride of participating in the new era. THE ELECTION AND DEMOCRACY W. E. B.

THE CRISIS and a probable voting population of nearly thirteen million there were in 1920 less than two and a half million votes east. Less than 10 per cent, of the total population vote and of the men and women 21 years of age about 18 per cent. vote. We have the astonishing total of ten and one-third millions of possible voters disfranchised, or 82.4 per cent! Notwithstanding this the Southern portion df the Union will receive 104 representatives in the 67th Congress, thus requiring only 21.248 voters per representative. Between these two extremes there lie three other sections: the North West, the Border States and the East. The Border States and the North West, while less democratic than the Middle West, nevertheless have between sixty and seventy thousand voters per Congressional representative, and disfranchise about 40 per cent, of their population, voluntarily or involuntarily. As contrasted with the Middle West and South West democracies, we may call these republics. On the other hand, in New England and the Middle States we have at least the beginning of distinct aristocracies—probably plutocracies. From 44 to 50 per cent, of their voters are disfranchised and 55,000 voters suffice for a representative in Congress. Their preponderance of political power comes undoubtedly from their disfranchised foreign population and from that part of the native population which has lost faith and interest in voting. In the South we have an oligarchy ruling rotten boroughs, and a few calculations make this manifest: if the South with its 104 representatives is properly represented, then the Middle West ought to have 479 representatives instead of 139; the Pacific and Northwestern States ought to have 91 instead of 32; the South West ought to have 35 instead of 10; the Border States should have 197 instead of 62; the Middle States should have 265 instead of 101; and New England should have 89 instead of 35. Or, to put it another way, if the Middle West is properly represented, then the South instead of having 104 representatives ought to have 31. These figures are, of course, tentative and may be criticised because of the assumptions made in estimating the voting population and the disfranchised foreigners. Nevertheless on the whole they approximate a correct picture of the dangerous situation in this country. If democracy is to survive, action and vigorous action looking toward the enforcement of the 14th Amendment is absolutely necessary. THE LYNCHING INDUSTRY—1920 M. G.

The abolition of Jim Crow cars in interstate traffic 7.	 Treatment of colored men in the Navy;where once many ratings as non-commissioned officers were held by Negroes, now colored men can enlist only as mess boys, in other words, as servants S.	 Appointment of a National Inter-Racial Commission to make an earnest studyof race conditions and race relations in the United States 9.	 Appointment of colored assistant secretaries in the Labor and AgriculturalDepartments which would give the Negro	 official representation in the two phases of national life where he needs most and suffers most 10. Continuance of the fight in theArkansas cases This is our goal. We cannot accomplish all of it in one year. We can, however, accomplish more than would have been possible in any past year in the Association's history if we have with us a great, virile organization. We set our figure at a quarter of a million members with which to back our undertakings. The Rev. Robert W. Bagnall comes to us from Detroit to conduct our membership drive and become a permanent addition to our national staff. The March number will tell more of this. ARKANSAS JUSTICE READERS of TH E CRISIS know of the long legal right which the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People has been making to defend the 79 colored men who were accused of complicity in the alleged massacre of October, 1919, in Phillips County, Arkansas. For the purpose of giving the complete story, I am writing this brief chronological summary of the steps the Association has taken. Newspapers of October 2, 1919, told of the alleged uprising planned by colored men of Phillips County through an organization known as the Progressive Farmers' and Household Union of America for the purpose of killing all of the white citizens and seizing their land. The Assistant Secretary of the Association was immediately sent to Arkansas to secure the real facts. His investigation showed that the stories of an alleged massacre planned by Negroes were untrue; that the colored people of Phillips County, as well as other parts of the State of Arkansas and of other Southern States, had been for years subjected to vicious economic exploitation under the share-cropping system, and that they had formed an organization for the purpose of securing relief through the courts of the State. Based on the facts gained by this investigation, the National Board of Directors of the N. A. A. C. P. at a specially called meeting on November 24, 1919, authorized the employment of counsel headed by Colonel George W. Murphy of Little Rock to defend the 12 colored men who had been sentenced to death and 67 others who had been sentenced to prison terms. These convictions had occurred within five days, and these men were tried in Phillips County while the mob spirit was high, despite all our efforts to obtain a change of venue, and when there was little chance of acquittals regardless of the testimony. An appeal was first made for a re-trial in the Phillips County Circuit Court. This motion was denied. Habeas Corpus proceedings were then prepared and at the same 163 Lime an appeal was made to the Arkansas State Supreme Court for a review of the cases in that court. This motion applied to the 12 death sentences. On January 9, 1920, the appeal for a hearing was granted by the Arkansas State Supreme Court and the cases carried for review to that court. At this point in the case, Robert L. Hill was arrested in Kansas and fight was begun to prevent his return to Arkansas. The December issue of TH E CRISIS told of that part of the fight and the eventual freeing of Mr. Hill. The decision of the State Supreme Court was finally rendered on March 30, when the court affirmed the verdict of death in 6 of the 12 cases and reversed the verdict in the remaining 6 cases. The latter were sent back to the Phillips County Circuit Court for a new trial. The reversals were made upon the ground that the jury had rendered its verdicts improperly. In the first 6 cases, attorneys for the Association immediately applied for a writ of certiorari in the United States Supreme Court. This effort was made in order to carry the cases directly to the highest tribunal. In the meantime, the cases which had been sent back to the Phillips County Court had been re-tried after a change of venue had been applied for and denied. As was expected, the men were convicted a second time. Colonel Murphy was taken ill after the first day of the trial and the cases were carried on with exceptional ability by Attorney Scipio A. Jones, one of the associate counsel. On October 11, the United States Supreme Court refused to review the cases of the 6 colored men whose conviction had been afiirmed by the State Supreme Court. As a result of his illness, due, it was felt, in part to the strenuous work he had done in these cases, Colonel George W. Murphy died about the same time of day on October 11 that the United States Supreme Court was denying the writ of certiorari. This refusal by the Supreme Court to re view the cases acted as an automatic re sentencing of the 6 men to death. On November 8, the cases of the 6 men who had been re-tried and re-convicted by the Phillips County Court, were again appealed to the State Supreme Court of Arkansas. This appeal for a re-hearing was granted by the Supreme Court. While the cases were being reviewed a CRISIS second time, Governor Charles H . Brough of Arkansas, in direct contravention of all precedent, issued a long statement to the newspapers which appeared on November 16, giving reasons why he believed the men were guilty and declaring that if the State Supreme Court refused to grant the appeal of the condemned men, he as Governor would grant no clemency. In spite of these obviously unfair tactics on the part of the Governor in trying the cases in the newspapers, the State Supreme Court on December 6, reversed for a second time the verdict of death, on the ground that Negroes had been excluded from juries in Phillips County in direct contravention of the Fourteenth Amendment and the Civil Rights Act of 1875. The cases were again remanded to the Phillips County Court for re-trial. The decision in these cases will have a direct bearing upon the cases of the 6 men whose motions for a new trial were refused and who are now under sentence of death. A reprieve will probably be granted to these men pending a decision in other cases. It is impossible to tell how far the cases will eventually go. The decision of December 6 is the most important victory thus far, in that the reversal was upon Constitutional grounds. If justice is denied in the State Courts, it is hoped that the cases can be carried finally into the Federal Courts. The order of procedure in the Federal Courts will be, first, to the Federal Court of the Eastern District of Arkansas; second, the Circuit Court of Appeals of the Federal Court; and finally the United States Supreme Court. Al l of the testimony and evidence which have been secured since October, 1919, points conclusively to the fact that the men were not guilty of the crime charged and that they are imprisoned because of race prejudice in the State of Arkansas. The fight to free these men is not solely one effecting 79 individuals, but a fight to determine whether or not men shall be sent to death solely because they are colored. Another important determining factor is that this case may be the entering wedge in the struggle to end economic exploitation of colored men and women through the share-cropping system which is so widespread in Southern States. To date the Association has expended more than $8,000 in this fight and is obligated to pay its lawyers in Arkansas an N. A. A. C. P. 165 additional $5,000 within a very short time. If the cases are eventually carried to the United States Supreme Court, the cost will probably be in excess of $30,000. A n argent appeal is made to every reader of THE CRISIS to contribute as much as he or she can to aid in the gigantic task of saving these men, and exposing to the world the evils of the peonage system in the South. DISFRANCHISEMENT IN CONGRESS ON December 29 and 30, James Weldon Johnson, Walter F. White and William Pickens of the National Office, together with James A. Cobb, Archibald H. Grimke and other representatives of the District of Columbia Branch, and George H . Murray, an attorney of Washington, appeared before the Committee on the Census of the House of Representatives at a hearing on the House Reapportionment Bill. The testimony presented by the Association showing the vicious tactics used in Southern States to debar colored citizens from registering and voting by intimidation, terrorization and chicane aroused a storm of protest from the southern members of the committee. The representatives of the Association presented figures published in this number of THECRISIS, proving the disfranchisement of colored voters; the names, addresses and registration certificate numbers of 941 colored citizens of Jacksonville, Fla., who were deliberately prevented from voting on November 2; showed that the names of 3,000 additional persons who likewise were prevented from voting, were being secured; introduced as evidence photographs showing the long lines of colored citizens who stood before the polls on election day, but were not allowed to vote; told of the election riots in Orange County, Fla., where more than 30 Negroes were burned to death because one duly qualified colored voter attempted to exercise the right of franchise; and presented much evidence of similar nature showing the deliberate methods used to disfranchise colored men and women in Southern States. Representatives of t he Association directly charged the suppression of most of the colored vote in the South. They demanded, first, that a complete Congressional investigation be made of the elections of 1920 in Southern States; and, second, the full accordance of the right of franchise or a reduction of representation in the House of Representatives in proportion to the suppression of votes in those states where a Congressional investigation proved such •suppression. The tactics of Representatives Carlos Bee of Texas, W. W. Larsen of Georgia, and James H . Aswell of Louisiana, were most undignified in their efforts to heckle and harass the witnesses. Their attempts apparently were aimed to prevent, as far as possible, the inclusion of testimony in the records of the Committee. Their efforts finally became so flagrant that it was necessary for Chairman Isaac Siegel of New fork to call them to order so that the hearing might continue. At the end of the hearing on the second day, a newspaper photographer appeared in the Committee room to take a photograph of the Committee and witnesses. Representative Aswell of Louisiana left the room with the statement that he "wasn't going to have his picture taken with a bunch of niggers." Representative Larsen of Georgia, according to the New York Tribune of December 31, informed Chairman Siegel that he did not intend leaving the room, but would "raise hell" if a picture were made with the spectators on hand as a background. In order to avoid a row with the southern representatives, the Committee went into executive session, thus clearing the room and then the group picture was taken. THE DULUTH CASES SPLENDID work has been done in the defense of the colored men accused of assault upon a young girl, which led to the lynching in June in Duluth, Minn., of 3 colored men. Following the lynchings, 13 colored men were arrested, charged with criminal assault. Led by the Duluth Branch of the Association which, like the Fresno Branch, was only recently organized, and aided by the Minneapolis and St. Paul Branches, Attorneys F. L. Barnett of Chicago, R. C. McCullough of Duluth, and Charles Scrutchins of Bemidji, Minn., were employed to defend these men. The Duluth Branch raised more than $1,200 for the employment of lawyers, reporters and investigators and supplied the men who were friendless and penniless with clothes and meals while incarcerated in prison. As a result of these efforts, 12 men have been freed. One of these was freed by a jury and their verdict thoroughly discredit TH E CRISIS ed the stories which caused the death of the 3 men who were lynched. Five defendants were discharged by order of the court and on Friday, December 17, six other defendants were brought into court and at the request of the prosecuting attorney, were discharged from further prosecution. One defendant was convicted and his case is now being appealed to the State Supreme Court. CIVIL RIGHTS IN CALIFORNIA AN important decision has just been rendered in the District Court of Appeals at San Francisco in testing the validity of the California Civil Rights Act, when a decision was rendered in favor of Errol Jones against the Kinema Theatre of Fresno. On June 20, 1918, Mr. Jones, accompanied by a young woman, purchased tickets for the orchestra of the theatre. When he entered the theatre, he was accosted by the head usher who attempted to direct him and his companion to a remote part of the theatre near the right wall. The usher politely but firmly called his attention to a statement on the back of the ticket, "Admit one to such seat as may be assigned by management." The practice of segregating colored patrons had been practiced by this theatre for years and no attempt had been made to prevent such discrimination. When Mr. Jones insisted on sitting in the center aisle where there were vacant seats, he was told by the usher that because of orders from the management, Mr. Jones would not be allowed to sit in the center aisle. Mr. Jones thereupon left the theatre. Being a minor, suit was entered against the theatre by Edward Jones, father of Errol Jones, in the Superior Court of the State of California. The trial court awarded the complainant One Hundred Dollars, the minimum sum provided by the statute. The theatre immediately appealed and at this point the Fresno Branch of the N. A. A. C. P. entered the case. Mr. Jones was unable to bear the cost of litigation in the higher courts and turned over the entire matter to the Fresno Branch. This branch, although organized only a few months prior to that time, having a limited membership and treasury, immediately assumed the responsibility of conducting the appeal. It called upon the other branches of the state for financial assistance, which appeal was immediately answered. The Northern California Branch took the lead in raising funds for the defense, employing E. Burton Ceruti, a member of the National Board of Directors and Attorney for the Los Angeles Branch, to handle the case in the higher court. When the case was re-argued in the District Court of Appeals at San Francisco, by a unanimous decision of the court, the verdict of the lower court awarding damages to Mr. Jones was affirmed. In the words of Mr. Ceruti, "The kernel of this decision is the principle therein established and which enlarges upon the legal definition of discrimination. In effect, it says that enforced segregation is, per se, a discrimination which is in violation of Civil Rights Statutes." HOW ONE MAN AIDED THER E are a number of interested per sons who would aid in the work of the Association, but who, being unable to contribute large sums, hesitate to contribute small amounts. Many of these persons do not realize that the contributions of many individuals like themselves, joined together would form a huge fund to carry on the work which is so necessary. A n example of what one man has done and what others can do, is seen in a letter received at the National Office as a result of an appeal in the December issue of THE CRISIS for funds to carry on the Arkansas Defense cases. The letter reads: In reading your article in the Christmas issue of THE CRISIS, appealing to every reader of THE CRISIS who wishes to see justice done in the cases of the doomed men of our race, who are now in jail in Phillips County, Ark., B. Y. McPheeter and myself, who are subscribers to your wonderful magazine, decided to make a plea to every colored man of our little town for one dollar each to assist in seeing justice in the cases of the doomed men of Phillips County, Ark. And all the colored men in our town,—they are very few—gave one dollar each without being coaxed. Therefore, you will find enclosed a Post Office Money Order for $20.00 made payable to THE CRISIS. Please turn same over to the Arkansas Fund. Also, will you please give acknowledgement through THE CRISIS or mail me a receipt for same?remain, Very truly yours, (Signed) C L. STEWART, Tonopah, Nevada. The Looking Glass LITERATURE NATHAN ROSENBAUM inThe Liberator: I hear the sullen murmurs rising from the sea of human hearts— I hear the drums of Freedom rumbling in the darkness of the night— I see the lightning flash of Truth sink deep into the minds of Men— I see the waves of Revolution rise in their mighty strength, Breaking the chains of slavery, Sweeping away the debris of decayed plu tocracies, Lifting Man into Manhood, And freedom into its place in the sun. * * * Robert M . McBride and Company have published South of Suez, byWilliam Ashley Anderson, a highly enthralling survey of scenes and places in East Africa. There is an account of the Empress Zeoditou of Abyssinia in the midst of the revolution which placed her on the throne: Eyes were turned to the westward, and there, issuing from an opening in the woods, came the Empress and her followers. There was no cheering, no applause; everybody was silent with astonishment. Covered with a plain black silk cloak, with neck and face muffled in snowy linen, so that only her eyes showed, and upon her head a broad-brimmed felt hat, she seemed to have hit by instinct upon the nobility of simplicity. Close about her were several ladies-in-waiting, similarly dressed, and all mounted on mules. But surrounding her, and spreading far on either side, came such a multitude as I have rarely seen—a torrent of sandalled, white-clad humanity, mostly soldiers, armed with shields, rifles, bandoleers, and scimitars. And this wave bore her down upon us, deposited her at the entrance to her pavilion, and then broke and swirled in independent eddies about the course until driven back into position by horsemen charging boldly into the press. * * * Another book dealing with Africa is A . J. B. Desmore's With the 2nd Cape Corps Through Central Africa. Mr. Desmore speaks in his introduction of the long wait and hesitation which preceded the formation of the Cape Corps: The writer will endeavor to show how keen the men of this regiment were on soldiering under conditions oftimes adverse, though sometimes not unpleasant. He will depict their weary waiting in Nyasaland, where they did post duty, while undergoing at the same time strenuous courses of training. He will portray their pursuit of the enemy in the rainy season, where they daily experienced continuous down-falls of rain. He will follow them in that long and arduous chase, when they frequently brushed against the rear-guard of the enemy, and drove before them the whole of Von Lettow's force for almost two hundred miles of broken and bushy country, completing that stupendous task after six weeks in the slush and rain of a dreary winter. He will tell of their bitter disappointment at the miscarriage of the scheme to wedge in the enemy at the Lugenda, through the failure of Hawthorn's column to come up in time. And last, but by no means least, he will introduce to the reader the "Tenga Tenga," those fine black fellows who played so prominent a part in this campaign, that it came to be known as the "Tenga Tenga War." * * * The Lynching Bee and Other Poems by William Ellery Leonard (B. W. Huebsch, Inc., New York), gives a gruesome picture of the great American pastime. The Negro has been burned at the stake and then: A t last the stench, or glow of embers, brings The wolves, or wolf-like things . . . Such as on earthquake midnights prowl around Smoulder of fallen beams and littered ground, And tear from dead hands golden finger-rings. But though they crouch in slow two-legged stealth, Their hunt is not for wealth. They paw into the cinders, as with hooks . . . Snatch something out, With gloating, starveling looks . . . A bit of rib . . . or skull ... or crup . . . Hot ash and finger knuckle . . . They wrap them up, And putter round about . . . And chuckle . . . And foot it off and down the road. COMING EVENTS THE possibility of organization among Negroes to a degree which shall vie with that of white men has aroused a very real fear among the supporters of "white supremacy." The majority of whites see only a menace in what might easily be a natural evolution somewhat hastened by the 167 TH E CRISIS Great War. Frederick Cunliffe-Owen writes in the New York Globe: Even those Americans who,since they have been called upon to pay, in the form of extortionate taxes, the colossal expenditures incurred by the government in the great war, from which they insist they derived no tangible benefit, decline to interest themselves any longer in what goes on abroad, cannot afford to remain indifferent to this awakening of the Negro races into a great pan-African force. For although the blacks of the continental portion of the United States form but a tenth part of the entire population, yet by means of association they are becoming more and more of a factor in the economic situation. Furnishing as they do the bulk of the unskilled labor in the South, there are certain national industries, notably that of cotton, almost entirely dependent upon their willingness to work. Until the great war they were virtually excluded by union labor from all its skilled callings. But so powerful has the Negro element become by means of co-operation, that they have forced the American Federation of Labor to abandon its discrimination against them, and to receive them on a footing of perfect equality with the whites; while they are already hand in glove with the more advanced and extremist labor organizations, among them the I. W. W. When one recalls how violent was the opposition of all the great American labor organizations against the admission of any Negro to their ranks, their reluctant abandonment of this policy of exclusion can only be construed as a demonstration of the force which the blacks have been able to bring to bear upon them by means of cooperation. * * * One success leads to another and there is no telling what heights Negroes, filled with a new race-consciousness, may achieve. This author continues: The victory which they have thus achieved is naturally bound to encourage them to further ambitions, in the way of the removal of the economic, political, and social disabilities that now handicap their aspirations. They are thoroughly discontented with their lot, more so than ever since the great war, in which nearly 400,000 of them took an active part, and where those who fought abroad were treated by the French and by the other allied nations of Europe with a degree of consideration and cordiality that was withheld from them by their white American comrades and fellow citizens there and here. And since they are malcontents, are destined to become more so, and have now become conscious of their strength, as shown by their victory against the most powerful labor organization in this country, we may look toward their becoming in very short order a disturbing factor in the political and economic system of this country. Among the features of this Negro move ment which have attracted the attention of the authorities both here and in Great Britain, is the abundance of funds which its leaders seem to have at their disposal. Thus, ey have a number of daily newspaper;, weekly journals, and monthly magazines, some of them edited by Negroes who are graduates of Harvard and of other white universities, and which have a large circulation. * * * An attitude which must strike the Negro as laughable were it not so maddening is that taken by white men to the effect that the pan-African movement is a menace to Africa. When one considers Belgium and the Congo and the expropriation by England of the Mashona and Matabele lands, it is hard to imagine what worse fate can befall the natives at the hands of their own people. Mr. Cunliffe-Owen says: Al l the foremost authorities on the problems connected with the black races, such as Sir Arthur Lawley, who spent a number of years as governor in South Africa; Lord Milner, now secretary of state for the colonies; the late Frederick Courtenay Selous, lion hunter and writer upon questions relating to the Zulus and to the Kaffirs; Sir Harry Johnston; Dr. Charles Peters, German explorer; Archibald Colquhoun, and others who have studied the Negro question, regard the pan-African movement as the greatest danger by which the dark continent is confronted and are well nigh unanimous i ascribing an American origin thereto. Whereas here the whites are ten times as numerous as the blacks, in Africa the whites represent barely 1 per cent, of an average native population of 200 millions, all more or less united by a common sentiment of inherited resentment against the whites, and by an overwhelming desire to drive them out of the land of Ham. Sir Arthur Lawley. when he left South Africa to assume the governorship of Madras, uttered publicly his conviction that sooner or later a great rising of the Blacks against the Whites would take place throughout the length and breadth of the Dark Continent. These views were not those of an irresponsible alarmist and sensation-monger, but of a colonial administrator of extensive experience. and invested with one of the most important offices in the gift of the British crown. IT IS TO LAUGH THE high gods who know that all is well must be often faint with laughter over some aspects of this race muddle of ours! This gem appears in the Danville, Va.. Bee: No action will be taken by the authorities of the Medical College of Virginia in regard to remarks on the race question alleged to have been made before the junior class by Mrs. Margaret M. Haskins, newly THE LOOKING GLASS elected professor of histology and a Ph. D. of Yale University. The lecture was given several weeks ago, and is now regarded as a closed incident. "The remarks of Dr. Haskins seem to have been much exaggerated," said Dr. E. C. L. Miller, dean of the college, Friday morning. "She used an unfortunate illustration in the course of a purely academic lecture several weeks ago. Had she said what is now being quoted, or in any way advocated inter-marriage of the race, I am quite certain the students would have risen and left the room." Dr. Haskins came to the medical college this year from the University of Minnesota. Her father is an emeritus professor at Yale. In the lecture before the junior class, which has caused comment, she was making the point that from a physical and medical standpoint the individual should be considered and not the race, and is quoted by some of the students as having illustrated her point by saying that were the choice to be put up to her, she would prefer to marry an intelligent, cultivated and refined Negro rather than an ignorant, low, white man. The incident created much talk among the student body, but Dr. Miller said that no action had been taken or was contemplated either by the student or the faculty— the whole being regarded as a closed incident. "Dr. Haskins realizes," he said, "that the illustration was unfortunate, especially for one comine; from New England, to use in the South" * * * Who said Americans had a sense of humor? JAPAN VS. EUROPE IN CHINA EDITH H. BEARD, writing in the Boston, Mass., Post, shows succinctly the proportions of holdings in China by Japan as contrasted with those claimed by European nations. "Poor old China!" says Miss Beard, "how much has she left even for herself!" Square miles England has Tibet 533,000 Szechuen 218,000 Kwantung 86,000 Province of the Yangste Valley. . 362,000 Total 1,100.000 or 27.8% Russia—Outer Mongolia 1.000.000 Che-Kiang 1,548,000 Three-quarters of Manchuria.... 273,000 Total 1,821,000 or 42.3% France—Yunnan 146,700 or 3.4% Japan—Shantung 55,000 South Manchuria 90,000 Mongolia 50,000 Fukien 46,000 Total 243,000 or 5.6% Total under "foreign influence" 79%. Tibet, rich in minerals and vast unexplored a leas. Szechuein, China's richest agricultural province; Kwantung, with its wealthy, important sua port of Hong Kong. And the Yangste Provinces, China's chief lea-growing provinces. There is not a city in either China or Japan that has not had to give over its finest residential sections to the European, and in almost every case tax free. Just why is it seemingly the custom to continually speak of "Japanese aggression" and not one word about the huge holdings of these other nations? Why, when in 1916, October 19 to be exact,.when the French took 333 acres in the very heart of Tientsin, the port of Peking, an attack or grab led in person by the French charge d'affaires at the head of a band of French soldiers, when they seized and arrested all Chinese soldiers on. duty, and in the name of the French Republic annexed this land containing wharfage, streets, houses and shops, why were our papers perfectly silent about it? But the Chinese papers teemed with the outrage, and because of their just protest, France threatened to impose an indemnity. Why do we hear so much about Japan's 21 demands, and not one word about England's 12 demands, demands which Chinese officials term "cruel and unreasonable," demands which practically mean the annexation of Tibet by the British government. The world certainly seems to have a double standard of international justice, and it seems ouite time that the real aggressors ceased using Japan as a smoke screen. AT LAST. GEORGE BERNARD SHAW THE great English playwright, George Bernard Shaw, utters a strong word on "The New Terrorism." He writes in the New York American: Let us no longer deceive ourselves. Our statesmen are still in the dark ages, and the war that brought down the night has been ended in victory which has deepened the gloom to blackness and intensified the terror to nightmare Like a man broken on a wheel, who shrieked at the first stroke but laughed at the second, we have ceased to respond to the horrors around us. England blockading and starving Central Europe and laying Ireland to waste, Japan keeping her countenance in Korea, Holy Russia (for Bolshevist Russia is now either the real Holy Russia or the most wretched of imposters) combining with the Turks to crush Armenia, South Africa threatened 170 TH E CRISIS with secession in which white labor is irreconcilable with the millionfold of colored labor, holocausts of children in the heart of Europe, and, above all, the steady rise of food prices in the face of the yet unanswered question whether the allies in starving Central Europe have not also starved themselves—all this has so broken the spirits of the few who are capable of grasping it that they can only shrug their shoulders and say: "Let us eat and drink, for to-morrow we die," whilst the fools who have found that folly is at a premium in wartime, and the profiteers who have found that war makes profiteers rich, drive the sheep-like multitude in every direction where they can decry the chance for another war. For example, before the war there were horrible lynchings in America, but they were not advertised in England. I was sent a few furtive snapshots of lynchings that showed nothing distinctly and had evidently been taken at some risk to the photographer. But a few days ago I saw a photograph of a lynching which was handed around in a London drawing-room, and for this photograph the lynchers, including a group of women, had posed, eager, smirking and proud of themselves, in an orderly row, with a young man in the middle dragging the body of the victim half upright so as to exhibit it the better, without the least suspicion that he was exhibiting his country in its worst aspect to eastern rivals only too glad to be able to point to this horror and say, "Behold the fruits of democracy!" If such frightful photographs are accessible to me, they are accessible to the American police. If people pose for them, they are evidently as sure as the Black and Tans in Ireland that they have no reason to fear prosecution. ECHOES FROM THE ELECTION WE are constantly receiving accounts of methods employed in the recent election campaign to check or at least offset the Negro vote. A n especial effort was made to prevent colored women from voting, but in many places men were prevented too. Here is a typical dialogue from Lexington, N. C: Q. What can I do for you? A . I dame to register. Q. You came in to register? A . Yes, sir. Q. Didn't you know that I do not register colored people? A . No, sir. I thought that it was your duty to register any citizen who could read and write the Constitution. Q. Yes, but you are the first colored man ' that has applied for registration. A. Well what has that got to do with it? Q. If I register you the whole settlement of your people will be here to register. I would not mind registering you, but for that I simply will not register you. A. (Indignantly) Well—but is it not law that you give me a trial? Q. Yes (making as though to get his books was a great effort) but I warn you before hand that you will not be able to satisfy me. A. If I am eligible, will not that satisfy you? Q. No. A . Why? Q. Because you iare colored and I have been advised to register no colored people. A. Do you think that is fair to us? Have not colored people been instrumental in one way or another in making your business what it is? Q. Yes, but I do not want to be criticised and both parties will criticise me. A. Well, do you stand more in fear of criticism from man for doing right than you would in fear of God for doing wrong? Q. I do. A . Well, what do you think of the colored man's rights? Q. Well, I think he has not got any whatever that should be considered; that is my view, etc. * * * A letter from Florida speaks for itself: I am sure that you know something of the recent wholesale slaughter of colored people at Ocoee, Fla., but I am afraid that you don't know what a large number of people were burned in 25 houses. I know from good authority that there were three wagon loiads of bodies. Of course the Florida papers only told that one man was lynched and 5 or 6 killed, and the burning of 25 homes. Al l of the colored people who escaped are afraid to tell anything, but God knows it is terrible here and I do pray that you and your coworkers can have those murderers punished. I cannot sign my name as I am afraid, and later I'll try and tell you about the "Klans." * * * Colored people in the vicinity were all frightened, as they had received messages that they were going to burn all the colored houses as the man who was running for sheriff was defeated and they claim that had it not been for the colored votes he would not have been defeated. I do hope that you all will be able to have something done to protect the lives of our people down here * * * Often when reading about the conditions in the South I thought they were exaggerated, butfind that nothing has pictured the conditions as horribly as they are. I will write again signing. Don't say how this information was given, as I may not be as lucky to get away as others have. Yours, November. Men of the Month. "TH E EMPEROR JONES" CHARLES S. GILPIN, now playing in "The Emperor Jones," is that most remarkable being—a man who has seen his dream come true. As a little boy he longed for an opportunity to display his rich dramatic gift. But as one member of the Provincetown Players' Company puts it, "for years he has had within himself the power to mount to the top of the ladder and there has been no ladder." Gilpin in spite of learning early that such opportunities as came his way for acting, paid him but poorly, could not keep away from the stage. Thus we find him alternating between the theatre and other callings of a more practical nature. He has been printer, barber and porter, interspersing these activities with parts in variety shows and entertainments in churches and music halls. In 1896 he joined the Perkus and Davis Great Southern Minstrel Barn Storming Aggregation, but its insolvency was quickly shown. He retired then, as he thought, permanently, but in 1903 he yielded again to his ruling passion and joined the Gilmore Canadian Jubilee Singers for the season of 1903-1904. He enjoyed this experience greatly, for no one objected to his color. In 1905 he acted with the Williams and Walker Company. Thence he drifted to the Pekin Players in Chicago, where he had a chance at everything from the veriest slapstick acting to Grand Opera. This company consisted of some forty members of whom eleven were finally selected for playing serious drama—and Gilpin was one of them. But the death of the manager of the Pekin Players sent Gilpin back to vaudeville in the South. He could not find work among the New York managers, who saw only his dark skin, and back he went to the "road"—the railroad—as a Pullman porter. In 1919 he played the part of the faithful old slave in "Abraham Lincoln." But Gilpin was meant for something bigger than the portrayal of a purely racial part. His is a genius to interpret universal characteristics—the qualities which lie at heart in all men. Eugene O'Neill needed such an actor for the leading part in his "The Emperor Jones". For once Fortune was kind and brought together the man who had the part to give and the man who could act it. "The Emperor Jones" is a great play but it took Gilpin to show New York how wonderful it was, and incidentally how rich and subtle was his own interpretive genius. The critics for once all agreed. Heywood Broun writes in the New York Tribune: CHARLES S. GILPIN, IN "THE EMPEROR JONES." 171 TH E CRISIS The Emperor is played by a Negro actor named Charles S. Gilpin, who gives the most thrilling performance we have seen any place this season. He sustains the succession of scenes in monologue not only because his voice is cne of a gorgeous natural quality, but because he knows just what to do with it. Al l the notes are there and he has also an extraordinary facility for being in the right place at the right time. The New York Globe quotes Kenneth MacGowan: But without the fine playing of Charles S. Gilpin, the Negro actor, as Emperor Jones, the whole play would fall to the ground and the most striking of the silhouette scenes come to nothing. Gilpin's is a sustained and splendid piece of acting. The moment when he raises his naked body against the moonlit sky, beyond the edge of the jungle, and prays is such a dark lyric of the flesh, such a cry of the primitive being as I have never seen in the theatre. And Alexander Wcolcott tells us in the New York Times: They have acquired an actor, one who has it in him to invoke the pity and the terror and the indescribable foreboding which are part of the secret of "The Emperor Jones." Gilpin has transcended race and country. His playing- in "The Emperor Jones" is a universal appeal. THE late Rt. Rev. Charles Henry Phillips, of Nashville, Tenn., is known as the pioneer bishop of the Colored Methodist Episcopal Church, having established churches in Indiana, Ohio, Arizona, New Mexico and California.

Finally he was transferred to Pasadena, Cal., where he was minister to one of the most progressive and influential churches of the West. He was elected President of Morris Brown last summer when the former president became a bishop.

DuBois and Dill, Publishers 2 West 13th Street New York, N. Y. THE CRISIS ADVERTISER A GOOD NAME IS BETTER THAN RICHES The SOUTHERN AID SOCIETY OF VA., INC., has attained its front rank position in the esteem of the public by its SUPERIO R SERVIC E in providing continuous protection to its policyholders against sickness, accidents and death. Such exceptional service deserves public approval, hence we appreciate most highly the following editorial from the great Journal and Guide, of Norfolk, Va., one of the race's leading weeklies. "A MODEL RACE INSTITUTION" (From Norfolk JOURNAL &amp; GUIDE, Dec. 11, 1920) If those who were engaged in building an enduring economic foundation for the Afro-American people received from all race institutions the loyal co-operation that is characteristic of the Southern Aid Society of Virginia,, Inc., our problems would be greatly simplified, if nut solved. The Southern, Ai d Society of Virginia is an insurance corporation. It is&gt; a model of efficiency in its management and has been highly successful and prosperous. In its policy it has been exceedingly liberal to its policyholders, giving a little more for the money than others seem able oi disposed to give, yet it has enjoyed a degree of prosperity that may well be envied by other organizations of its class. The corporation is a liberal supporter of Afro-American business enterprises. Its stationery and requisites in the nature of office forms and literature are done on Afro-American printing presses; it has built business, properties in every important city in Virginia and in the District of Columbia and has liberally and almost exclusively used Afro-American architects and tradesmen in the building of them: id is a liberal patron of Afro-American newspapers and periodicals and it makes no apologies for having nine-tenths of its reserve funds deposited in Afro-American banks. It is strictly an Afro-American institution, and a shining example for a great many other alleged Afro-American institutions which we could name. It is not a loyal Afro-American because it does not luve and does not wish to be in harmony with, all mankind, neither does it envy any other race or wish to see any friction between Afro-Americans and any other race; but it is a loyal race institution as a matter of business and of principle. It is on the best of terms with institutions of the opposite race and enjoys their great respect and confidence. The Southern Aid Society of Virginia is doing now and has always done what all of our race institutions must do: give something in return for what they receive from the race. There are great Afro-American insurance companies that have the bulk of their funds deposited in bank- that are not controlled by Afro-Americans; there are great denominational institutions that receive every dollar they get from Afro-Americans that do not deposit one dollar in Afro-American banks; this i - true of probably the most ably financed religious organizations of the race. There are great fraternal, religious and business organizations of the race that have been the beneficiaries of the Afro-American press for years that do not contribute enough business to these papers in the course of a year to pay their telephone bills. But their number is growing less, we can happily observe. Institutions like the Southern Ai d Society and some others we will name in later articles are pointing the way. If the Southern Ai d Society can co-operate with Afro-American banks, newspapers, printing plants, merchants and tradesmen and live and grow big, others can do the same. The old stock excuse that race banks are too small will soon have no legs to stand upon. W e have now five banks that are either over or close around the million dollar mark. With the necessary co-operation they can render a great deal more effective service than they are now called upon to render. This is not a boast. It is rather a prophecy. We have nothing to boast of. But we do have grounds upon which to base an appeal for more effective co-operation. The Southern Aid Society of Virginia is a model business enterprise, richly deserving the Support of the race, for it really and truly serves the race. This editorial brings forcibly to our notice the fact that the public approves of our efforts to render a superior service to our own policyholders and at the same time extend a helping hand to all other race enterprises, Therefore in expressing to our policyholders and the public our sincere thanks for the best business during 1920 of any period in the history of the Society, we also pledge to excel during 1921 all efforts heretofore made to serve our policvholders in the time of sickness, accidents or death and to continue to co-operate with all worthy race enterprises in their efforts to open Doors of Opportunities to our people, SOUTHERN AID SOCIETY OF VA., INC.
