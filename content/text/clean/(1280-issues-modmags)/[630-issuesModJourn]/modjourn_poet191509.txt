SEPTEMBER 1915  CHALKS BLACK RED WHITE  LEAD SOLDIERS  THE nursery fire burns brightly crackling in cheerful little explosions and trails of sparks up the back of the chimney Miniature rockets peppering the black bricks with golden stars as though a gala flamed a night of victorious wars  The nodding mandarin on the bookcase moves his head forward and back slowly and looks into the air with his blue green eyes He stares into the air and nods forward and back The red rose in his hand is a crimson splash on his yellow coat Forward and back and his blue green eyes stare into the air and he nods nods  Tommy s soldiers march to battle Trumpets flare and snare drums rattle Bayonets flash and sabres glance   How the horses snort and prance  Cannon drawn up in a line  Glitter in the dizzy shine  Of the morning sunlight Flags  Ripple colors in great jags  Red blows out then blue then green  Then all three a weaving sheen  Of prismed patriotism March  Tommy s soldiers stiff and starch  Boldly stepping to the rattle  Of the drums they go to battle  Tommy lies on his stomach on the floor and directs his columns He puts his infantry in front and before them ambles a mounted band Their instruments make a strand of gold before the scarlet tunicked soldiers and they take very long steps on their little green platforms and from the ranks bursts the song of Tommy s soldiers marching to battle The song jolts a little as the green platforms stick on the thick carpet Tommy wheels his guns round the edge of a box of blocks and places a squad of cavalry on the commanding eminence of a footstool  The fire snaps pleasantly and the old Chinaman nods nods The fire makes the red rose in his hand glow and twist Hist That is a bold song Tommy s soldiers sing as they march along to battle  Crack Rattle The sparks fly up the chimney   Lead Soldiers  Tommy s army s off to war Not a soldier knows what for But he knows about his rifle How to shoot it and a trifle Of the proper thing to do When it s he who is shot through Like a cleverly trained flea He can follow instantly Orders and some quick commands Really make severe demands On a mind that s none too rapid Leaden brains tend to the vapid But how beautifully dressed Is this army How impressed Tommy is when at his heel All his baggage wagons wheel About the patterned carpet and Moving up his heavy guns He sees them glow with diamond suns Flashing all along each barrel And the gold and blue apparel Of his gunners is a joy Tommy is a lucky boy  Boom Boom Ta ra  The old mandarin nods under his purple umbrella The rose in his hand shoots its petals up in thin quills of crimson   Then they collapse and shrivel like red embers The fire sizzles  Tommy is galloping his cavalry two by two over the floor They must pass the open terror of the door and gain the enemy encamped under the wash stand The mounted band is very grand playing allegro and leading the infantry on at the double quick The tassel of the hearth rug has flung down the bass drum and he and his dapple gray horse lie overtipped slipped out of line with the little lead drumsticks glistening to the fire s shine  The fire burns and crackles and tickles the tripped bass drum with its sparkles  The marching army hitches its little green platforms valiantly and steadily approaches the door The overturned bass drummer lying on the hearth rug melting in the heat softens and sheds tears The song jeers at his impotence and flaunts the glory of the martial and still upstanding vaunting the deeds it will do For are not Tommy s soldiers all bright and new  Tommy s leaden soldiers we Glittering with efficiency Not a button s out of place Tons and tons of golden lace Wind about our officers Every manly bosom stirs At the thought of killing killing Tommy s dearest wish fulfilling   Lead Soldiers  We are gaudy savage strong And our loins so ripe we long First to kill then procreate Doubling so the laws of Fate On their women we have sworn To graft our sons And overborne They ll rear us younger soldiers so Shall our race endure and grow Waxing greater in the wombs Borrowed of them while damp tombs Rot their men O glorious War Goad us with your points Great Star  The china mandarin on the bookcase nods slowly forward and back forward and back and the red rose writhes and wriggles thrusting its flaming petals under and over one another like tortured snakes  The fire strokes them with its dartles and purrs at them and the old man nods  Tommy does not hear the song He only sees the beautiful new gaily colored lead soldiers They belong to him and he is very proud and happy He shouts his orders aloud and gallops his cavalry past the door to the washstand He creeps over the floor on his hands and knees to one battalion and another but he sees only the bright colors of his soldiers and the beautiful precision of their gestures He is a lucky boy to have such fine lead soldiers to enjoy   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Tommy catches his toe in the leg of the wash stand and jars the pitcher He snatches at it with his hands but it is too late The pitcher falls and as it goes he sees the white water flow over its lip It slips between his fingers and crashes to the floor But it is not water which oozes to the door The stain is glutinous and dark a spark from the firelight heads it to red In and out between the fine new soldiers licking over the carpet squirms the stream of blood lapping at the little green platforms and flapping itself against the painted uniforms  The nodding mandarin moves his head slowly forward and back The rose is broken and where it fell is black blood The old mandarin leers under his purple umbrella and nods forward and back staring into the air with blue green eyes Every time his head comes forward a rosebud pushes between his lips rushes into full bloom and drips to the ground with a splashing sound The pool of black blood grows and grows with each dropped rose and spreads out to join the stream from the wash stand The beautiful army of lead soldiers steps boldly forward but the little green platforms are covered in the rising stream of blood  The nursery fire burns brightly and flings fan bursts of stars up the chimney as though a gala flamed a night of victorious wars   Vernal Equinox  VERNAL EQUINOX  The scent of hyacinths like a pale mist lies between me and  my book And the South Wind washing through the room Makes the candles quiver My nerves sting at a spatter of rain on the shutter And I am uneasy with the thrusting of green shoots Outside in the night  Why are you not here to overpower me with your tense and urgent love  FENWAY PARK  Study in Orange and Silver  Through the spring thickened branches I see it floating An ivory dome Headed to gold by the dim sun  It hangs against a white misted sky And the swollen branches Open or cover it As they blow in the wet wind   MAY EVENING IN CENTRAL PARK  Lines of lamp light Splinter the black water And all through The dim park Are lamps Hanging among the trees But they are only like fire flies Pricking the darkness And I lean my body against it And spread out my fingers To let it drift through them I am a swimmer In the damp night Or a bird Floating over the sucking grasses I am a lover Tracking the silver foot prints Of the moon I am a young man In Central Park With Spring Bursting over me  The trees push out their young leaves Although this is not the country And I whisper beautiful hot words   May Evening in Central Park  Although I am alone And a few more steps Will bring me The glare and suffocation Of bright streets  ALIENS  The chatter of little people Breaks on my purpose Like the water drops which slowly wear the rocks to powder And while I laugh My spirit crumbles at their teasing touch  STRAIN  It is late And the clock is striking thin hours But sleep has become a terror to me Lest I wake in the night Bewildered And stretching out my arms to comfort myself with you Clasp instead the cold body of the darkness All night it will hunger over me And push and undulate against me Breathing into my mouth   And passing long fingers through my drifting hair Only the dawn can loose me from it And the gray streaks of morning melt it from my side Bring many candles Though they stab my tired brain And hurt it For I am afraid of the twining of the darkness And dare not sleep  THE PAINTER ON SILK  There was a man Who made his living By painting roses Upon silk  He sat in an upper chamber And painted And the noises of the street Meant nothing to him  When he heard bugles and fifes and drums He thought of red and yellow and white roses Bursting in the sunshine And smiled as he worked   The Painter on Silk  He thought only of roses And silk  When he could get no more silk He stopped painting And only thought Of roses  The day the conquerors Entered the city The old man Lay dying He heard the bugles and drums And wished he could paint the roses Bursting into sound  Amy Lowell   FATHERLAND  There is no sword in my hand Where I watch oversea Father s land mother s land What will you say of me Who am blood of your German blood Through and through  Yet would not if I could Slaughter for you What will you say of one Who has no heart  Even to cheer you on  No heavens part No guiding God appears To my strained eyes Athwart the fog of fears And hates and lies  I see no goal I mark No ringing message flying Only a brawl in the dark And death and the groans of the dying  For you your men of dreams And your strong men of deeds Crumble and die with screams And under hoofs like weeds Are trampled for you   Fatherland  In city and on hill Voices you knew And needed are still  And roundabout Harbor and shoal The lights of your soul  Go out To what end O Fatherland I see your legions sweep Like waves up the gray strand I hear your women weep And the sound is as the groaning Swish of the ebbing wave A nation s pitiful moaning Beside an open grave Ah Fatherland not all Who love you most Armed to triumph or fall March with your mighty host  Some there are yet as I Who stand apart And with aching heart  Ponder the Whither and Why Of the tragic story Asking with bated breath Which way lies glory And which way death  Hermann   Hagedorn  AGLAVAINE  Aglavaine came to the inn They gave him the foulest room He with a heart to win  Love like the rose for bloom Slept with the rustling straw for bed And cobwebbed rafters overhead  Aglavaine s red faced host Kept revel all night long The bar maid was their toast  The devil s flings their song Still through the noise he heard the leaves Tossed in the wind against the eaves  Aglavaine heard the choir Chant in the church unseen Then with a heart of fire  For beauty fine and clean Ate where a clown might loathe to dine While all his fellows reeled with wine  Aglavaine came to the inn Short was their speech and curt He of the tender chin  Lonely and worn and hurt Saw through his window round of sky God s pageantry of stars go by   Aglavaine  Aglavaine sang in the sun Taking the morning road His was the course begun  His but the firstling load They travel far and sup with sin Who find good quarters at an inn  DRIFTWOOD  Like driftwood burning in the grate  Salt with the boundless sea Glowing with all the changing fate That drove it far and held it late  Broken and beaten you may be But sad experience leaps and flies To light and color in your eyes  Like wreckage tossing with the tide  Borne from we know not where The wildness of the waves you ride However much your face may hide  Has left its mark of foul and fair And brave experience leaps and plays About my dreams of your dead days  Like love before a driftwood fire I watch the colors warm   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Paint on your cheeks each old desire Make you a thing I might aspire  To hold and shelter from the storm This is your lure to drift wind tossed Compass and soul and rudder lost  The firelight dies Our fancies part I with the world must shut my heart Poor wasted beauty It must be The changing tide sweeps out to sea  Lewis Worthington Smith  A POET T O HIS POEMS  You are born you are no more mine I have let you go forever Demoniac or divine You shall sail by sea and river  You shall walk by road and track You shall fly through wind and weather But nevermore come back That our hearts may laugh together  Elizabeth Gibson Cheyne   POEMS  THREE GUESTS  She whispered Love is dead She saw the raven hearse go down the street And closed her door  Then Passion rose and pled Even more wild even more fiery sweet Than Love before  And lingered in the room Out of an anguished moment to coerce Dreams that had been  Till forth into the gloom Passion went following the raven hearse And Peace came in  AT DAWN  They were all around me Soft as petals shaken Summer faces bound me In a balmy zone I find it strange to waken And be alone   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Outer sounds pierce coldly  Day begins her battle  Wheels come faintly boldly  Crunching through the ice  And the milk jars rattle  Like frozen dice  Let me turn a moment  One more dream to number  Seek the warm bestowment  Of the flowers that mass  Drain the dregs of slumber  Let the dawn pass  LONG DISTANCE LINE  More wonderful than all my joy of heart  To know the sudden nearness of his mood  That for a little moment we apart  Together stood  That same low voice across my garden aisles Might not have reached my ear for wind or bird But it has spoken across a thousand miles And I have heard  Agnes Lee   DISCORDANTS  I  Music I heard with you was more than music And bread I broke with you was more than bread Now that I am without you all is desolate All that was once so beautiful is dead  Your hands once touched this table and this silver And I have seen your fingers hold this glass These things do not remember you beloved And yet your touch upon them will not pass  For it was in my heart you moved among them And blessed them with your hands and with your eyes And in my heart they will remember always They knew you once O beautiful and wise  II  My heart has become as hard as a city street The horses trample upon it it sings like iron All day long and all night long they beat They ring like the hoofs of time  My heart has become as drab as a city park The grass is worn with the feet of shameless lovers   A match is struck there is kissing in the dark The moon comes pale with sleep  My heart is torn with the sound of raucous voices They shout from the slums from the streets from the  crowded places And tunes from a hurdy gurdy that coldly rejoices Shoot arrows into my heart   O my beloved sleeping so far from me Walking alone in sunlight or in blue moonlight Are you alive there far across that sea Or were you only a dream  III  Vermilioned mouth tired with many kisses Eyes that have lighted for so many eyes Are you not wearied yet with countless lovers Desirous now to take even me for prize  Draw not my glance nor set my sick heart beating Body so stripped for all your silks and lace Do not reach out pale hands to me seductive Nor slant sly eyes O subtly smiling face  For I am drawn to you like wind I follow Like a warm amorous wind though I desire   Discordants  Even in dream to keep one face before me One face like fire and holier than fire  I walk beneath these trees and in this darkness Muse beyond seas of her from whom I came While you with cat like step steal close beside me Spreading your perfume round me like soft flame  Ah should I once stoop face and forehead to you Into and through your sweetness a night like this In the lime blossomed darkness feel your bosom Warm and so soft and find your lips to kiss  And tear at your strange flesh with crazy fingers And drink with mouth gone mad your eyes wild wine And cleave to you body with breathless body Till bestial were exalted to divine  Would I again O lamia silked and scented Out of the slumberous magic of your eyes And your narcotic perfume soft and febrile Have the romantic hardihood to rise  And set my heart across great seas of distance With love unsullied for her from whom I came With cat like step you steal beside me past me Leaving your perfume round me like soft flame   IV  Dead Cleopatra lies in a crystal casket Wrapped and spiced by the cunningest of hands Around her neck they have put a golden necklace Her tatbebs it is said are worn with sands  Dead Cleopatra was once revered in Egypt Warm eyed she was this princess of the south Now she is very old and dry and faded With black bitumen they have sealed up her mouth  Grave robbers pulled the gold rings from her fingers Despite the holy symbols across her breast They scared the bats that quietly whirled above her Poor lady she would have been long since at rest  If she had not been wrapped and spiced so shrewdly Preserved obscene to mock black flights of years What would her lover have said had he foreseen it Had he been moved to ecstasy or tears  O sweet clean earth from whom the green blade cometh When we are dead my best beloved and I Close well above us that we may rest forever Sending up grass and blossoms to the sky   Discordants  V  In the noisy street Where the sifted sunlight yellows the pallid faces Sudden I close my eyes and on my eyelids Feel from the far off sea a cool faint spray  A breath on my cheek From the tumbling breakers and foam the hard sand shat  tered Gulls in the high wind whistling flashing waters Smoke from the flashing waters blown on rocks  And I know once more O dearly beloved that all these seas are between us Tumult and madness desolate save for the sea gulls You on the farther shore and I in this street  Conrad Aiken   BOKARDO  Well Bokardo here we are Make yourself at home Look around you haven t far  To look and why be dumb Not the place that used to be Not so many things to see But there s room for you and me  And you you ve come  Talk a little or if not Show me with a sign Why it was that you forgot  What was yours and mine Friends I gather are small things In an age when coins are kings Even at that one hardly flings  Friends before swine  Rather strong I knew as much For it made you speak No offense to swine as such  But why this hide and seek You have something on your side And you wish you might have died So you tell me And you tried  One night last week   You tried hard And even then Found a time to pause When you try as hard again  You ll have another cause When you find yourself at odds With all dreamers of all gods You may smite yourself with rods  But not the laws  Though they seem to show a spite Rather devilish They move on as with a might  Stronger than your wish Still however strong they be They bide man s authority Xerxes when he flogged the sea  May ve scared a fish  It s a comfort if you like To keep honor warm But as often as you strike  The laws you do no harm To the laws I mean To you That s another point of view One you may as well indue  With some alarm  Not the most heroic face To present I grant   A Magazine of Verse  Nor will you insure disgrace  By fearing what you want Freedom has a world of sides And if reason once derides Courage then your courage hides  A deal of cant  Learn a little to forget Life was once a feast You aren t fit for dying yet  So don t be a beast Few men with a mind will say Thinking twice that they can pay Half their debts of yesterday  Or be released  There s a debt now on your mind More than any gold And there s nothing you can find  Out there in the cold Only what s his name Remorse And Death riding on his horse Well be glad there s nothing worse  Than you have told  Leave Remorse to warm his hands Outside in the rain As for Death he understands And he will come again   Bokardo  Therefore till your wits are clear Flourish and be quiet here But a devil at each ear  Will be a strain  Past a doubt they will indeed More than you have earned I say that because you need  Ablution being burned Well if you must have it so Your last flight went rather low Better say you had to know  What you have learned  And that s over Here you are Battered by the past Time will have his little scar  But the wound won t last Nor shall harrowing surprise Find a world without its eyes If a star fades when the skies  Are overcast  God knows there are lives enough Crushed and too far gone Longer to make sermons of  And those we leave alone Others if they will may rend The worn patience of a friend   POETRY  A Magazine of Verse  Who though smiling sees the end With nothing done  But your fervor to be free Fled the faith it scorned Death demands a decency  Of you and you are warned But for all we give we get Mostly blows Don t be upset You Bokardo are not yet  Consumed or mourned  There ll be falling into view Much to rearrange And there ll he a time for you  To marvel at the change They that have the least to fear Question hardest what is here When long hidden skies are clear  The stars look strange  Edwin Arlington Robinson  COMMENTS AND REVIEWS  CHAUCER AND LANGLAND HEN the English language was in the making the English language which the Germans call the bastard tongue the insignificant pirate dialect in comparison with their own throaty and mouth filling speech when English was taking unto itself Saxon strength Norman splendor and a touch of the more southern Latin grace to become that powerful flexible and richly tuned organ which was to be heard around the world even in those half articulate and illiterate centuries the shaping influences were yet more or less conscious and more or less incarnate in human beings of differing minds The singers who wandered from castle to castle or from hamlet to hamlet ambassadors and newsmongers to the lords and the folk chanted their sagas and romances in forms derived from Norse Teutonic or French tradition and fought on English soil the war of kultur even then It was fitting and singularly dramatic that the final battle of this war should have been delivered over to two such sturdy champions as Chaucer and Langland The time was the militant and imaginative fourteenth century of Edward the Third of his knightly son the Black Prince and his work hating beauty loving grandson Richard the Second the fourteenth century of amazing contrasts extravagance and starvation beauty and loathsomeness jewelled em   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  broideries and vermivorous rags And the scene was mostly London London of the Norman court and the Saxon people of lords and starvelings castles and hovels pageants and pests little London already rising into glory out of the slime of the river Thames  Not that the two champions consciously faced each other in their intellectual lists Neither may have known of the other s existence or if they ever met in those narrow mud ways no doubt the courtly Chaucer smiled when surly Long Will refused to make way for him or take off his ragged cap to this retainer of kings Neither suspected probably that the future of England or at least of English lay between them that one or the other of them was molding a world encircling language and cutting the patterns of an immortal art  Of course all the odds were with Chaucer then as now he was irresistible Well born well reared learned in three or four languages a cosmopolite who had carried his king s messages to Italy Italy then mothering the Renaissance and withal one of the most engaging and sympathetic beings who ever took human shape it was no wonder that Chaucer had it all his own way and that English poets have done his will for centuries Reared in the Norman court chanting French romances from childhood he naturally preferred rhyme and the three time iambic measure to the alliterations and assonances and the harsh irregularities of the pounding four time measure derived from that Saxon tradition which was still dear to the hearts and sweet to the ears of the com   Chaucer and Langland  mon people Indeed it was a proof of Chaucer s broad sympathy of his strong mind and big heart that he did not abandon English altogether that he like Dante loved his dames tongue and insisted on writing his poems in it instead of in courtly French or learned Latin It was a fortunate day for us all when Chaucer said  Let clerks enditen in Latin for they have the property of science and the knowinge in that faculty and let Frenchmen in their French also endite their quaint terms for it is kindly to their mouths and let us show our fantasies in such words as we learneden of our dames tongue  So while Chaucer did not introduce the French forms into the new combination language it is not too much to say that he domesticated them He made rhyme and the iambic measure as much at home in English as they ever have been in the romance tongues and he opened the way for some of the greatest rhythmists who ever lived Shakespeare Spenser Milton Coleridge Shelley Swinburne and others whose verse structure however varied is almost entirely based upon the three time iambic foot or bar their four time experiments being comparatively slight and incidental  Thus Langland was left far behind Piers Plowman was forgotten except by scholars From his time until Shelley s four time measures were almost abandoned being found only in a few Elizabethan songs in parts of Dryden s two music praising odes and in a few other experiments The iambus reigned supreme usually in the five footed line which Chaucer s fine instinct had preferred to the French hexameter as better suited to the genius of the new language And   even when Coleridge in the Ancient Mariner and a few other poems Shelley in The Cloud The Skylark and others and Byron in There be none of beauty s daughters and one or two other songs began to vary the music of English verse with four time measures their experiments bore little relation to Langland or to the earlier Saxon bards And while Swinburne s varied rhythms wove with infinite delicacy new renaissance patterns they never went back to the stern old Gothic motive  The first great modern poet no doubt to put aside altogether the renaissance patterns was Whitman In doing so he did not consciously return to the music of the sagas the Gothic motive as it may be called yet his free verse is more allied to Langland than to Chaucer it has more in common with the old Anglo Saxon bards than with Shakespeare or Milton or Swinburne It does in short remind us once more of the older tradition older that is in English poetry though the reminder is far away and indefinite a matter of feeling and flavor and general rhythmic pace rather than of form or tune  But in the impetus toward free verse which Whitman led and which is evident in so much modern poetry French and Italian as well as English it is possible that Langland and his Old English predecessors will have increasing influence Indeed we have evidences of this in such modern presentations of mediaeval music as Mr Ezra Pound s truly wonderful paraphrase The Sea farer for example Those old poets will be studied not from the point of view of   Chaucer and Langland  academic scholarship but from that of immediate beauty and fecundity We shall have a new realization of their power of imagination and of the splendor and variety of their rhythms  And thus Langland after more than five centuries may come into his own at last The world may rediscover that modern socialist anarchist anti militarist who in the king ruled monk ridden war lorded fourteenth century lifted up his prophet s voice for the brotherhood of man and was called crazy for his pains Chaucer took his world as it was and left us a Holbein portrait gallery of the people he saw around him loving the processional pageantry of the life of lords and commons and ignoring the invisible and inarticulate miseries of the forgotten remnant the poor who froze and starved in hovels and died in battles and periodic plagues Langland on the contrary felt these miseries of the poor as the only fit subject for tragic passion a great democrat he made the crowd the subject of his epic a great seer he looked forward to the end of their miseries not through mythical compensations in heaven but through increase of justice on earth  The urbane Chaucer for five centuries has led the poets his successors in motive as well as technique they have been mostly of his mind accepting his aristocratic point of view his delight in the upper class pageant and almost entirely ignoring the burden bearing poor But perhaps Langland is like to bridge the centuries and clasp hands with the poets of the future the prophets of the new era toward which the   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  world is marching through blood and fire through faith and dreams H M  ITS INNER MEANING  Mr Conrad Aiken seems to be all het up over the Imagists In the New Republic in the Poetry Journal maybe elsewhere he accuses them of a dark and piratical conspiracy to revolutionize poetry and of nameless crimes like myopia synaethesia super refinement over civilization They are absurdly artificial singularly inhuman they are tea tasters they have no sense of tragedy they forbid word magic forsooth and forfend they don t know the difference between the denotative and the connotative they are guilty of a tremendous limitation which entirely annuls their declaration for absolute freedom in choice of materials In short they are prosers instead of poets and the sooner they are put firmly in their place and the lid screwed down over them the better it will be for all concerned  Why all this excitement Can it be possible that Mr Aiken has taken a culture from the imagistic poison and is feeling some discomfort until it gets into his system How otherwise may we account for the difference between the pseudo Masefieldian narratives of the earlier Aiken and the more athletic lyricism which the later Aiken may hope for if he keeps advancing in the direction of his offering to our readers in this issue Has he not gained in hardness and clarity in precision and concentration in a feel   Its Inner Meaning  ing for plain speech for tactile values for delicate detail in short for most of the qualities he accuses the imagists of fighting for And has his growth in these qualities interfered with his use of poetry to express human emotion has he not grown also in intensity of feeling or at least in the ability to give poetic form to his feeling  The truth is that none of our poets illustrates more precisely than Mr Aiken the need and the value of the kind of work the imagists are doing work which he not they so far as I remember calls revolutionary What is a revolution The word comes from re again back and volvere to roll and means according to the omniscient Webster return to a point before occupied Thus the term is exactly and most fortunately descriptive for the imagists says Mr Aiken take certain elemental or elementary laws of good writing and proclaim them as the well chosen principles of a new and difficult art As their critic would cry out to their discredit they have only taken what has been a characteristic of all the best Anglo Saxon poets and made it a principle By Anglo Saxon poets we infer that he means poets using the English language and he might have gone further and included the best poets of all languages  For the point which Mr Aiken criticizes is precisely the one he should praise that the imagists are trying to remind us of first principles If in this reminder he finds a note of defiance an air of doing something bold and outrageous and of doing it in the face of old and powerful enemies is   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  not that usually the way in any revolution small or great aesthetic or political in any effort to roll back to return to a point before occupied In these loud times especially one must shout in order to be heard  And there are old and powerful enemies in the shape of long established precedents and practices Certain metric forms and rhyme tunes have been followed by so many generations of English poets that the modern world has come to think them fundamental instead of incidental elemental instead of derived And these forms and tunes have been covered over with ornaments and excrescences the Victorian tradition especially has burdened them beyond endurance until we need to return to the point before occupied to go back to first principles and remind ourselves that the art of poetry existed before ever Shakespeare or Chaucer or even Homer was born and that it will exist when English is a dead language  Imagism is by no means the last word as Mr Pound or Mr Flint or Miss Lowell would be the first to acknowledge But in so far as it is a protest against narrowmindedness and provincialism against myopia in short it is a good word and a word that needs to be uttered In so far as it tries to break through barriers which for centuries have walled in the arts in the tight little island barriers which we colonials long accepted with sentimental loyalty it is a healthy and vigorous movement to be studied in its motives and principles and its highest achievements and not saddled with the weaknesses of its advocates or imitators   Its Inner Meaning  Mr Aiken complains in one breath that the imagists forbid word magic and in the next that they are so preoccupied with such delicate details as words as quite to omit passion If he finds no word magic in the best of these poems there is nothing to do about it for it is the fault of his instinct and ear And if he finds no passion one is moved to ask what he means by that much abused word We have passion ad nauseam in the illustrations of popular magazines showing the Gibson youth and maid in postures of ecstasy or agony Are some of our critics so dulled by that kind of thing that they can not feel passion in H D s Oread of Mr Fletcher s Blue Symphony If so again there is nothing to do about it  This is a cosmopolitan age in spite of separative and mediaeval wars Imagism is perhaps in the last analysis the beginning of a search for the Chinese magic and this search will probably go on as we dig deeper into that long hidden far away mine of jewels in spite of Mr Aiken and other belated and provincial Victorians More than half a century has passed since occidental painting and sculpture began to feel the subtly regenerative influence of oriental art The great art of poetry has been shut in more than these by narrow boundaries of race and language but like these it must come out in the open lift its voice over the seas and spread its wings to all the winds of the world H M   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  WHAT IS POETRY  Recently I looked into all the definitions of poetry I could find Macaulay Dr Johnson Coleridge Shelley Plato Watts Dunton and Poe besides many others essayed to define what poetry is Some of these substituted the poetical effect for the thing that produces it some seized upon indicia as the thing itself Some called poetry invention while it is clear that discovery better connotes the creative act which brings to light hidden thoughts and emotions But whether we call the creative act invention or discovery the definition of poetry as either does not distribute all the qualities and all the causes and effects of a poetical production Neither is poetry rhymed or rhythmical language as some of these thinkers believed Neither is it the rhythmical creation of beauty as Poe declared Dancing may be the rhythmical creation of beauty so is this true of music No definition of poetry has ever been made which would not exclude poems of confessed greatness and many of the definitions include compositions which do not make the poetical appeal In spite of this contrariety in analyzing the substance of poetry the judgment of generations of poets and others informed in the subject is united upon certain works Not only is this true but the average mind concurs in this judgment Hamlet and Othello will enthrall a crowd taken from the street The Psalms Ecclesiastes Isaiah Proverbs the Gospels Revelations and many other books of the Bible are of almost universal acceptance And they are poetry The songs of Burns   What Is Poe try  interest and inspire the common man The catalogue need not be extended to make the point It may require a cultivated taste to enjoy the choruses of Aeschylus or the dramatic works of Browning or the luxurious imagery and music of Swinburne but poetry is still a question of substance it is a question of form only so far as form is necessary to convey the idea in its entirety  The matter of substance as regards poetry is what the re actionaries of this day cannot see There may be revolutionists who are advocating a complete recasting of our inherited ideas of form futurists who are striving to encompass ideas hitherto escaping from the material of words vorticists whose emotions whirl without re action and without falling and rising But to my mind the complete artist must accept whatever forms are necessary to achieve the poetical effect I see no reason for neglecting the sonnet or the old French forms or the rhymed lyric if those forms best express the emotion and the idea And for like reason where the idea and the emotions will be mutilated by the use of any of these forms I favor free handling free verse After all those who contend for the regular forms exclusively are under the delusion that poetry means a sonnet or blank verse or some of the standard measures They do not see that poetry is the orientation of the soul to conditions in life and that like great waters it may murmur or ripple or roar If it ripples use a villanelle if it roars give us words so used that the roar is not lost And in addition to this these sticklers for the old ways forget that the old forms were   themselves innovations at one time What was before the dactylic hexameters of Homer and before the blank verse of Surrey And how does the free verse of Theocritus justify itself against Homer or the prose and verse mixed together in Shakespeare s plays justify itself against the classic verse of the French drama  A poem comes out of the vibrations of the soul the rhythmical vibration of the soul For all vibration is rhythmical And this is the vibration which by its dynamic comes up into words and effects subtle and inherent cadence even where no definite rhythm is attempted Out of this statement someone may construct a definition of poetry a definition that will include all poetry worth including and will exclude all writing which is only verse  Edgar Lee Masters  REVIEWS  The Shoes of Happiness and Other Poems by Edwin Mark  ham Doubleday Page amp Co  In certain of his poems Mr Markham s democracy bridges the gulf between rhymed eloquence and poetry In The Man with the Hoe especially the passion for social righteousness fuses into a white heat and is molded by the poet into a pure form of austere beauty Here as with Isaiah and Ezekial social righteousness becomes spiritual beauty and thus a lofty poetic motive  But when the muse jealous of other passions deserts  her over burdened votary the verse however noble in mo   Reviews  tive loses poetic magic This is the trouble with The Chant of the Vultures Love s Hero World The Jews Freedom  and other poems suggested by the great war or other problems of modern politics It is the trouble also with Lowell s Commemoration Ode which may stand as our most conspicuous American example of a noble poem manqué social passion not quite fused into a form of perfect art and achieving therefore merely rhymed eloquence instead of poetry  Two or three of Mr Markham s best quatrains in this manner may serve to emphasize the point The first is from  Freedom  Man is the conscript of an endless quest A long divine adventure without rest Each hard earned freedom withers to a bond Freedom forever is beyond beyond  The second is from The Fear for Thee My Country  I fear the vermin that shall undermine Senate and citadel and school and shrine The Worm of Greed the fatted Worm of Ease And all the crawling progeny of these  And here is the most eloquent quatrain from Virgilia which is in the same class with the others though its motive is personal rather than social passion  One thing shines clear in the heart s sweet reason One lightning over the chasm runs That to turn from love is the world s one treason That darkens all the suns The present volume contains many poems of this kind a kind not without honor even though the honor be not   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  the muse s own award The Six Stories are excellently told they move with a light swinging gait from a heart full of sympathy and humor The Shoes of Happiness is perhaps the best of these at least it is the gayest but in How Oswald Dined with God and How the Great Guest Came the motive of social righteousness is expressed in tales poignant and beautiful Mr Markham knows when to stop in telling a story all his tales end with a good climax  But the book has more magical moments poems or parts of poems which prove once more that Mr Markham is a poet At Friends with Life contains this fine stanza  There on the Hills of summer let me lie On the cool grass in friendship with the sky Let me lie there in love with earth and sun And wonder up at the light foot winds that run Stirring the delicate edges of the trees And shaking down a music of the seas  The brief poem San Francisco Falling is one of the best in the book its eighth line being especially beautiful  A groan of earth in labor pain Her ancient agony and strain A tremor of the granite floors A heave of seas a wrench of shores A crash of walls a moan of lips A terror on the towers and ships Blind streets where men and ghosts go by Whirled smoke mushrooming on the sky Roofs turrets domes with one acclaim Turned softly to a bloom of flame A thousand dreams of joy of power Gone in the splendor of an hour   Reviews  And in Wind and Lyre perhaps the finest of his lyrics Mr Markham gives us an impassioned and beautiful prayer song  Thou art the wind and I the lyre Strike O Wind on the sleeping strings Strike till the dead heart stirs and sings 1  I am the altar and thou the fire Burn O Fire to a snowy flame Burn me clean of the mortal blame  I am the night and thou the dream Touch me softly and thrill me deep When all is white on the hills of sleep  Thou art the moon and I the stream Shine to the trembling heart of me Light my soul to the mother sea  H M  The Poet in the Desert by Charles Erskine Scott Wood Privately printed Portland Oregon Mr Wood s special distinction is that he really enters  into the desert that his poetry really presents something of the color and glory the desolation and tragedy of this wonderland at our western gates Thus the best of this poem is its Prologue which is a desert rhapsody rather than its fifteen hundred lines more or less of dialogue between the Poet and Truth  I do not mean that such an arraignment of present day injustices and such ardor for true social democracy is beyond the range of poetic art but merely that this poet s mind as yet mingles too much propaganda with its motive Like Mr Markham he is in danger of alienating his muse by becoming an exhorter for social righteousness T o be sure there   are many fine lines and passages of true poetry mingled with the splendid and glowing eloquence of the dialogue Its motive is big and of a high nobility  I have pushed aside the curtains of the universe And looked in and there In a desolation never to be broken Brooded my soul in a great loneliness I said to myself I will carve godhood Out of manhood  Joy and Beauty are the breath of Creation and all life is to be fulfilled in them I know that the slow moving streams Which press through the streets of the cities Ought to sing their cantata of joy As well as the brooks which warble past The knees of the great fir trees  And toward that fulfilment of joy the crowds are marching  They are not going down into the pits They are not marching to the factories They are not going to the furnaces Nearer more near stronger louder more strong They come and the mutter of their lips is Revolution Revolution Revolution  T o a man thus afire for a cause poetry or the lack of it in his message may seem a matter of minor importance But it should be his immediate concern for the poetry of his message is its life and Mr Wood proves himself a poet not only by the sweep and power of his vision but by the rich imagery and rhythmic beauty of his free verse at its best On almost every page one finds fine lines like this of Nature  She holds the suns lightly between her fingers   Reviews  Or these  I shod my spirit with the winged slippers of the wind  The pools of evening Wherein the stars dance and along the border of which runs the liquid moon  Also these lines to Truth  Your face is pale like the earliest dawn before the birds have  awakened Your feet are like lilies by the rim of a pool And your wings the mist of a cataract wherein the sun plays Making a delicate glory fleeting iridescent  But in the Prologue no ardor for a Cause gets between the poet and his muse Therefore knowing and loving the desert he gives us something of its varied magnificence in vivid passages of more sustained poetic beauty His song of praise is a chant which needs amplitude we can hardly do justice to its impassioned beauty by brief extracts  Never have I found a place or a season without beauty Neither the sea where the white stallions champ their bits and  rear against their bridles Nor the Desert bride of the Sun which sits scornful apart Like an unwooed Princess careless indifferent She spreads her garments wonderful beyond estimation And embroiders continually her mantle She is a queen seated on a throne of gold In the Hall of Silence She insists upon meditation She insists that the soul be free She requires an answer She demands the final reply to thoughts which cannot be an  swered She lights the Sun for a torch And sets up the great cliffs as sentinels   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  The morning and the evening are curtains before her chambers She displays the stars as her coronet  The poet is as sensitive to the desert s delicacy as to its majesty He feels the incredible pathos of  The little delicate flowers of the desert Which catch at the hem of Spring and are gone  The flowers bloom in the Desert joyously They do not weary themselves with questioning They are careless whether they be seen or praised They blossom unto life perfectly and unto death perfectly leaving  nothing unsaid They spread a voluptuous carpet for the feet of the Wind And to the frolic breezes which overleap them they whisper Stay a moment brother plunder us of our passion Our day is short but our beauty is eternal  Perhaps this is enough to prove that the Far West has produced a poet who though somewhat over burdened with his message is capable of rapture a poet of large vision of profound sympathy and faith whose free verse sometimes attains orchestral richness H M   OUR CONTEMPORARIES  I  Mrs Blanche Shoemaker Wagstaff who has recently become one of the editors of the Boston Poetry Journal asks us to delete from our advertisements the phrase The only magazine devoted exclusively to this art  The suggestion is timely we shall try to remember to oblige her Indeed this field this wilderness in which we were so recently a lonely pioneer will soon be dotted with shacks perhaps even with palaces Almost from the first the Poetry Journal offered us the high honor of imitation indeed we had to hasten our first number in order to protect our title from the Bostonian invader For over two years the Journal s appearance was as fitful as the typical poet s inspiration but now under Mrs Wagstaff s influence no doubt it will become less temperamental and give us a steady job either as friend or enemy  Now also there are others or rather there is Others for Others is a small monthly magazine published in Grantwood New Jersey and devoted to the new in poetry If the Poetry Journal is more conservative than POETRY Others is perhaps more radical at least its young editor Mr Alfred Kreymborg proclaims himself a dyed in the wool radical by putting a yellow cover on his magazine  Others began in July and its first two numbers present six of POETRY S poets Miss Lowell Messrs Cannell   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Holley Johns Wallace Stevens and W C Williams Its other contributors thus far are Mesdames Davies and Loy Messrs Hartpence R C Brown and Kreymborg And we are promised not only Messrs Fletcher Eliot and Bodenheim but a number devoted entirely to John Rodker and the Choric School Thus far Peter Quince at the Clavier is the most exciting thing in Others for Mr Stevens has a sense of words of rhythm and color and better still of things underneath which these reveal Mr Orrick Johns epigrams labelled Olives might perhaps better be called Pickles And the love songs of Miss Nina Loy though caviare to such conservatives as we are no doubt the newest of the new  Then there is Rogue that light cigarette of literature which appears now and then with clever verse and drawings somewhat Beardsleyish And there are the Bruno Chapbooks edited by Guido Bruno in his garret on Washington Square And there is Two ninety one a periodic stroke of lightning dealt on a reeling world by that friendly anarchist in the arts Mr Alfred Steiglitz  Success to them all It is the little magazines which should be encouraged and subscribed for The great magazines are mostly engaged in the same game that of getting a million readers But each little magazine represents someone s enthusiasm for a cause or an art It represents self sacrifice courage some vital principle The Liberator beginning in a garret ended by freeing the slaves POETRY   Our Contemporaries  or one of these others beginning in a dream will end by freeing American literature H M  II  W e are indebted to the June number of the London Egoist for the following bit of history It appears as a letter to the editor of that paper which was the first to reprint Mr Upward s Scented Leaves from a Chinese Jar after their appearance in POETRY in September 1913  THE DISCARDED IMAGIST  O thou unborn historian of literature if you ever mention my  name spell it better than F S Flint please Do not believe a single word That others have written about me  In the year nineteen hundred a poet named Cranmer Byng brought to my attic in Whitehall Gardens a book of Chinese Gems by Professor Giles  Eastern butterflies coming into my attic there beside the Stygian Thames And read me one of them willows forsaken young wife spring  Immediately my soul kissed the soul of immemorial China I perceived that all we in the West were indeed barbarians and foreign devils And that we knew scarcely anything about poetry  I set to work and wrote little poems Some of which I read to a scientific friend Who said After all what do they prove  Then I hid them away for ten or twelve years Scented leaves in a Chinese jar While I went on composing the poem of life   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  I withstood the savages of the Niger with a revolver I withstood the savages of the Thames with a printing press Byng and I we set up as publishers in Fleet Street and pro  duced the Odes of Confucius and the Sayings  My own poems I did not produce They were sent back to me by the Spectator and the English Review  I secretly grudged them to the western devils  After many years I sent them to Chicago and they were printed by Harriet Monroe They also were printed in The Egoist  Thereupon Ezra Pound the generous rose up and called me an Imagist I had no idea what he meant And he included me in an anthology of Imagists  This was a very great honor But I was left out of the next anthology This was a very great shame  And now I have read in a history of Imagism That the movement was started in nineteen hundred and eight By Edward Storer and T E Hulme  Poetry the crystal of language Passion frozen by art Fallen in love with its likeness  Evil is the advice of Horace That poems should be given nine years to fix Evil in the day of swift movements for I hear that already  Imagism is out of date  O thou divine soul of China Brooding over millenniums of perfect art May you never be troubled by the impertinences of the West  And thou unborn literary historian if you ever mention my  name Write me down an imitator of Po Li and Shakespeare As well as of Edward Storer and T E Hulme  Allen Upward  CORRESPONDENCE  A WINGED WORD  Dear POETRY It is very delightful to read you Not only for the good poetry which I almost always find in the front of you but for the expert criticism which I always find in your back pages It is refreshing to one who like myself finds the present tendencies not only a little startling but even at times a little bewildering to come in contact with robust temperaments to whom all this newness is as bread and butter a familiar article understood to the full and capable of being rated with precision In contrast my own views must seem as you call them mercurial I confess to not knowing any more what poetry is going to be like after the bust I intended to write burst but let it go at that of imagism polyrhythm blastism etc has done its work than I know what the world is going to be like after this war Not that I think these things a comparable calamity or indeed a calamity at all But I strongly suspect that both poetry and the world will be much what they were before And meanwhile I cannot help liking beauty wherever I find it in imagism polyrythm blastism and conventional verse Whenever I find a poem that seems beautiful to me I want to quarrel with everybody who would deny its beauty either on the ground that it is not poetry or that it is too old fashioned And when I don t find beauty in the quarter where it has been heralded I want to   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  quarrel with those who would put it there by definition Thus my views must seem chaotic to those who know what beauty is by what laws it is produced who are in fact the entrepreneurs of the enterprise Now while the absence of beauty seems to me a thing easy to explain beauty always appears to me in the light of a miracle I dissemble my awe in descriptive phrases I make an attempt to relate this miracle to that miracle but I do not conceive my remarks to be in the nature of a chemical analysis of the product before me Thus I tried to convey what was really a deep admiration for the Spoon River Anthology of Edgar Lee Masters and I am sorry that it left you with the impression that I wanted him to do it over again Nor when I expressed the feeling that if this poet had had more of our American romanticism he might have given a completer representation of American life I did not mean that I wanted him to be another O Henry I merely meant that the ironic view of life is not the comedic view of life and that some aspects of our American scene retain more of their own color if presented comedically or so it seemed to me But you do me too much honor to take my statement so seriously It is merely true and probably not at all important Only let me subscribe myself to your own enthusiasm for I too have been one of the Anthology s admirers from the beginning Floyd Dell  NOTES  Of the

best and learn most from him if he remains himself So we think Mr Pound has chosen the right method in these translations and we do not mind that they often are not English The words are English and give us the sense and after all it is the business of a writer to mould language to new purposes not to say something new just as his forefathers said something old So it is the business of the reader not to be angry or surprised at a strange use of language if it is a use proper to the sense  Chinese poetry has a wonderful humanity like Chinese painting and it is very free from artistic nonsense The Chinese poet at least in the great age of Tang did not sit down to write poetry and lose his common sense in the process He wrote to say something that was worth saying and even in translation he interests us like a man of experience talking seriously and without parade  Mr Pound has kept the reality of the original because he keeps his language simple and sharp and precise London Times
