Dear Friend:—To whom else than to youcan I dedicate this little wreath of poems?Weeds or flowers, without you, they wouldnot have been. Your interest, your sympathy,your appreciation were the sunshine and rainthat brought them forth—to blossom for amoment or forever. NOTE.—All the poems in this volume were written in the year 1912-13.When asked in what sequence he would arrange his poems, Wolff threwthe manuscripts in the air, saying, "Let Fate decide." They now appearin the order in which they were picked up from the floor. This is trueof all except the proem and those comprising the group under the heading "To One Who Could Not Love," which appear towards the end ofthe volume. THE PROEM I sing and sigh and also curse,Thus only can I give expressionTo that which will not brook repression;I am alive, I have a voice,And so I sing and sigh and curse—All life doth sing and sigh and curse.The joy of love is in my song,I sigh for pleasures yet untasted—For things I dream—o'er moments wastedAnd sometimes interrupt my songWith clenched fist to curse a wrong—It is a joy to curse a wrong.And so I sing and sigh and curse—All life doth sing and sigh and curse. CAPTIVES I visited the Zoo one dreary day,And in the lion's house I watched a lion,A great Numidian lion in his cage,With eyes three-quarters closed, with haughty gait,Pace up and down the limits of his cage.Was he oblivious of the tyrant bars,The gaze of human eyes, his captive state,And did he blink but better thus to seeThe jungle's vast expanse?He suddenly stood still; and, face to face,We stood and stared into each other's eyes,And we each saw in one another's eyesA royal captive in a wretched cage. IF I WERE GOD If I were God—the first thing I would doWould be to make all women beautiful.—All women beautiful—and all men strong.Then I'd resign—and make myself a man.That's just what I would do—if I were God. OPTIMISM On that cold table, where shameless, without blushingThey spread their nakedness,I see what yesterday had been a living beautyAnd is to-day a corpse—A flimsy mass of tissues and of juices,The prey of autopsy to-day,To-morrow prey of worms and dissolution.And whilst the perfume of this lifeless flower,Concoction made of chemicals and death,Inflicts an outrage on my sense of odor,Does disenchantment fill me with disgust?Does Death's black wing engulf me in its shadow?And being face to face with life's fragilityAm I made sick of life?I am not sick of life.I prize life more knowing how brief it is,How insecure, how fragile and how fleeting.I love the eyes bright with the spark of life,I love them more knowing they'll soon be dimmed.I love the lips aglow with warmth of life,I love them more because they'll soon be cold.I love all flesh that palpitates with life,I love it more knowing it soon shall beAn inert, flimsy mass of fetid tissue.I love the voice that rings with sounds of life,I love it more knowing 'twill soon be silent.I love the mind pregnant with living thought,I love it more knowing that soon 'twill beThe tomb of thought.I therefore let the dead bury their dead,And like a buzzing bee in quest of flowersI seek the flowers of life that gladly yieldThe sap that love distills to joy—that joyThat is much sweeter than the sweetest honey. THE CLOUD There hovers over me a muddy cloud,Enveloping me in its gloomy shadow,That dims the native sunshine of my heart,That dulls the keen perception of the mind,That stunts the latent powers of the soul,That smothers all the rising flames of hope,That cowes the wings of genius that would soar.I am forever followed by this cloud,I can't escape, I cannot flee this cloud,This muddy, gloomy, hell-begotten cloud—The dollar sign is traced upon this cloud! QUESTIONINGS Is it because the sun caresses meAnd makes me warm with its delightful raysThat it is mine? That it is only mine?Is it because I frolic in the sea,The sea that hugs me with a thousand waves,That it is mine? That it is only mine?Is it because I hold you in my armsAnd madly kiss you, calling you my love,That you are mine? That you are only mine? THE LIBERTY I LOATHE I am at large, can go this way and that,Mo dungeon walls, no prison bars say halt,When roving fancies seize upon my feet.But am I free? Can Ibe truly freeWhen that which lives within me is repressed,When my true self in vain from deep withinDoth clamor for the right of self-expression?What hideous mockery of freedom this!Put me in jail, put me in jail for life.Let bread and water be my only fare,Make rats and spiders my associates.But have the light into my dungeon pourFrom overhead and give me clay,Oh, give me lots of clay—the tender flesh,The oily, tender flesh of mother earth.Responsive as a mistress to the touch,And I will have a feast no king e'er knew,And taste of pleasures that the gods would envyAnd I will make unto myself a world,A world of which myself would be the God,A world in which my every dream and thought,My every feeling and my every passionWould find embodiment in plastic form.Oh, for a prison where I could be free! ON SEEING THE GARMENT STRIKERSMARCH I see a hundred thousand marching by.I also see as many, many millionsThat are in spirit also marching by.And lo! methinks this is but a rehearsalFor the Exodus from the Land of Bondage—And I behold with my prophetic eyesGod's chosen people crossing the Red Sea;The workers of the world, God's chosen people,Are crossing the Red Sea of Revolution.And I behold the Industrial Commonwealth,The Promised Land of plenty and of peace,Where each one, under his own fig-tree seated,Shall sing his praises to the Lord of Life. THE TOILERS Crouching they cling like vermin to the earthAnd with their bleeding fingers scrape the earthBut for a little dust, their sustenance,A little dust mixed with the sweat of brow,The blood of fingers and the tears of pain.'Tis not for them the sun shines gloriously,The flowers bloom, the fruit hangs on the tree,'Tis not for them the birds and poets sing,Or lovely women smile.They have to crouch and cling and sweat and scrapeBut for a little dust—their sustenance. PANEROTICISM I love all women's smiling eyes,I love all women's tempting lips,I love all women's loving hearts,I love all women's tender skin,I love all women's glowing flesh,I love all women's weakness,I love all women's strength.I love! I love! I love! APHRODITE I've seen a Venus not of marble carvedBy some great sculptor's hand in ancient Greece,Unearthed in a mutilated stateBy archaeologists in quest of ruinsAnd pedestaled in temple of fine art.The Venus I have seen was made of flesh,Of ordinary, living, human flesh,More beautiful than statue e'er could be.She stands behind a counter in a storeFrom morning until night dispensing wares—A living Venus at five dollars per. THE TYRANNY OF RHYME Inane coquette, depart from me,Thou siren known as Muse of rhyme,Thou fain wouldst make thy slave of me,To give thee all my thought, my time,And all the love that's in my heart,I know thee well, depart! depart!I love a nobler Muse than thee,She's simple, free, intense, sublime,Her rhythm has sweeter melodyThan e'er could have thy wanton rhyme.I gave to Rhythm my soul, my heart,O Muse of Rhyme, depart! depart! LINES INSPIRED ON MEETING A LADY To A. L. I look at life as an astronomerLooks at the star-filled sky.Life seems a sky to me, all human beingsRotating in their orbits are as stars.Some are obscure and some are luminous,Some give the light and warmth to solar systems,Some shed on lovers' heads soft lunar light.Some, like the comets, cosmic vagabonds,Are ever tramping the sidereal roads,And others, myriad-massed in endless stretches,Compose the glory of the Milky Way.I look at life as an astrologerBelieving in the influence of stars,Their influences evil, beneficial.Perplexed I ponder o'er the laws mysteriousThat govern all the movements of the stars.And I am troubled in my inmost beingAt the appearance of a new-found starAs on the threshold of a mystery.There hove into my sphere a new-found starOf primal magnitude, magnificent,Whose magnetism most irrestistiblyAttracts me to itself.Am I to be the happy satelliteOf this fair human sun whose smile or frownCould make me be a fertile Earth or Moon,A fertile Earth or frozen, barren Moon?Oh, will it just continue in its course,Rotating in its orbit and recede,Recede, recede, and leave me far behindObscure and cold and sad and all alone? . . . OSCAR WILDE The work was done.The spirit-moulders of immortal soulsWiped from their brows the sweat and washed theirhands,And standing by, in full contentment gazedUpon their wondrous work.A i masterpiece! it was a masterpiece!A genius to be born unto the world,One more to swell that galaxy of starsThat makes the cosmic bosom swell with pride.Another inextinguishable starTo scintillate throughout eternity.The angels stood, heads bowed in reverenceBefore what was to be the poet Wilde,And as they stood, these proud progenitors,In blissful contemplation of their child,There fell upon them, as a shadow castBy purple clouds upon a limpid lake,A sadness that no human voice could tell.Forebodings of the suffering of WildeDepressed them so that, kneeling down, they wept.They wept over the dire humiliationAwaiting him who is the pride of God,And over man's stupidity they wept—The colossal stupidity of man. IMPERIALISM With one great gesture of my love-mad armsWould that I could embrace the entire world,The entire world of love-inspiring women.With one unending pressure of my lipsI wish that I could kiss the entire world,The entire world of love-inspiring women.With one great spasm of ecstacy supremeWould that I could possess the entire world,The entire world of love-inspiring women. THE CHILDREN OF THE POOR The children of the poor are little plantsThat grow in sandy soil midst rocks and weedsAnd rusty cans of tin, and other junkWithin the gloomy shadow of a wall,The gloomy shadow of a mildewed wall;Poor little plants! poor children of the poor. THE CALL OF SEX Know you that bottomless and boundless sea,Each heaving billow whereof is a woman?Oh, how my love-parched body craves to plungeInto the soothing substance of this sea! . . .(Oh, for the joy of absolute abandonTo the caressing furore of this sea;The frantic joy of breaking all restrictions,Of daring all the dangers of this sea!The ecstatic and the harrowing sensationOf rising, ever rising on a wave,A giant wave that rises, ever rises,And then to be replunged into the deep!The all-absorbing, all-inclusive deep.What if the mouth doth swallow liquid bitter;What if the heinous sharks men call diseaseSnap at my flesh, infecting me with poison,And even what if that mysterious mermaid,That moon-pale Undine claim me as her ownAnd seal our union with the kiss of death?What of it? Does not all life end in death?Give me the death of Tristan and Isolde:I die for life and love,—I fear not death. IMMORTALITY At dawn of day the stars die one by one.They only seem to die, but do not die.There is no death for humans, or for stars.What we call life and death is only rhythm.It is all cadence, measure, rest, inflection,The poetry, the music of the spheres.The universe is one stupendous poemWhereof the suns and stars are words and letters,And we frail humans, punctuation marks. TO LIVE OR NOT TO LIVE To be or not to be is not the question;The question is, to live or not to live.Alive or dead or only vegetating,One thing is sure, we cannot help but being.To live! to be alive; to live intensely!To live with every fibre of the frame,With every sinew, every nerve and muscle;To live like this, or not to live at all.But we are cowards, we are fools and misers,Afraid to live—afraid to pay the price—The price of youth,—the price of youth is ageThe price—the price of joy is pain.And disenchantment is the price of love.And Life—the price of Life is Death.Come, let us live, and let us live intensely.Life! Life! more Life! more Life at any cost. MY RICHES Behold in me one richer than a king,Richer than Croesus was or Solomon,Aye, richer even than a Rockefeller.And lo ! the gilded portals of my palaceAre thrown wide open, and the spacious vaults,Staked full of treasures even to o'erflowingRemain unguarded, and I welcome theeTo enter and partake of all my riches.My palace is my heart; my wealth, my treasureIs love, immeasurable, boundless love. DEPRIVATION The world is like a tapestry to me,Immense and wonderful, where interwovenWith art most consummate by masterhandI see a maze of beings and of things.I can but see a little at a time,My sight is limited, the view is vast,The picture disconcertingly complex.But often, here and there, a brilliant spot,A woman's figure in life's tapestryAttracts my gaze and holds me in its spell.And, like a child that's crying for the moon,My hands would grasp that which delights mine eye,To press it fondly to my happy heart.Alas, the world, as tapestry and tomb,Will not give up its own. A SPHINX I like to see a woman wearing furs,Long-haired and dark and vicious looking furs,Strong smelling, soft, exotic looking furs,Contrasting strongly with her brilliant flesh,Her tender, warm and angel-tinted flesh.I love the angel and the beast in women.That's why I like a woman wearing furs. EXCUSE ME, MUSE 'Tis not the hour to sing of pink-hued vaporsSo softly sailing under azure skies;Nor of the shadow warm and so mysteriousCast by the lashes of a woman's eyes.'Tis not the time for soft euphonious sighingAnd holding converse with pale lunar light.Tis not the hour for musing and for dreaming,Excuse me, Muse, I must go out and light.) ■And I will light as long as infants suckleIn vain at parched breasts devoid of milk;As long as my poor sisters sell their bodiesFor bread and rags, while parasites wear silk.As long as slave and master, thief and pauperRemain such terms as may to man apply,So long, I say, my lyre shall be a weapon,My song shall be the rebel's battle cry. NOEL Tormented Galilean who art LordOf those that crucify thee every dayAnd every hour and minute of the dayAnd every hour and minute of the night:With pious glee they celebrate the nightThat witnessed thine appearance upon earth,That night when angels chanted "peace on earth."They chanted "Peace on earth, good will to men,"And thou wert crowned with thorns by hands of menAnd thou wert spat upon by mouths of menAnd thou hast been betrayed by kiss of men;Condemned by men and crucified by men,Aye, crucified and deified by men.And every year for many centuries,On Christmas eve for many centuries,In churches and cathedrals Christians singTheir gladness of the coming of the Lord.The organ's thunder glorifies the Lord,The priests and ministers exalt the Lord,The infant Lord the virgin Mary bore;On Christmas eve it was in Bethlehem:And whilst they fete the babe of Bethlehem,Ten thousand babes on earth die painful deathsAnd millions live to live lives worse than deathAnd still the massacre of innocentsGoes on relentlessly. Poor innocents! LINES TO THE WOOLWORTHBUILDING Imposing pile of pale and polished stone,Cathedral-like in thy solemnity,Thy rectilinear grandeur awes my soul,And makes me shudder!Monstrous sacrilege, O when beforeHas thing so big been made for end so small?Unholy Temple of the priests of lucre,How most appropriate thy pallor is,So like in color to the tint of bones—Thy slender, upright lines so much like bones—So much like children's bones.How like unto the pyramids thou art;The tyrants' tombs, built by a million slaves.And like the pyramids, ere longThou'lt be the relic of an age gone by. THE ARTISTS They have been born to model and to mouldThe shapeless clay into expressive formEven as gods! to seize the fleeting shades,The subtle hues of things that pass or stayAnd make them live and glow intensely.They have been born to tell their wondrous dreamsIn rhythmic stanzas full of strength and grace,To plunge into the very depths of things,To seek the precious essence that is fitFor distillation to symphonic strain.Require them not to leave their sacred sphere,To mix with common vendors in the mart,To traffic their creations and to throwThe priceless pearls of genius to the swineFor but a bowl of vinegar and gall.O bring to them the litle bread and milkWhich they must have to live, and if you canRejoice to give them honey. Be to themWhat ravens were unto a prophet once.Does not the beauty they create or dreamAtone for all our ugly deeds or thoughts,Even as the saints who pray for those that sinSustain the equilibrium that must beIn order that the world may not be doomed?Eternal malediction fall on thoseWho mock or crucify these chosen onesAnd let them be thrice blessed who help to clearLife's rugged road of thorns for those who passAnd passing, leave this world more beautiful. CAIN REFORMED Am Imy brother's keeper? Yes, indeed,I keep him, aye, I keep him hard at work.I also keep the fruit of all his workAnd of his children's work I keep the fruit.And when he does not keep the laws I makeThat give me power to keep him hard at work,I am his keeper, keeping him in jail.Am Imy brother's keeper? Yes, indeed. GOLGOTHA On the Golgotha of mine inmost beingThere stands a crucifix,And in the deepest recess of my beingIn perpetuity Good Friday reigns.And always in the stillness of the night,The endless night within mine inmost being,I hear the moaning and the supplicationsOf him that's crucified within my being.I see the wounds of side and hands and feet,The wounds that glow like rubies in the night,That cast a lurid glare upon the night,Those mystic wounds in number like the senses.Four horrid wounds upon the hands and feet,One on the side, thus making five in all,just as the senses, making five in all.And in the endless night within my beingI hear the moaning and the supplications."Oh, tear me from my cross," entreats the Christ,"For I am Joy, thy God, the son of Life.Oh, tear me from my cross," entreats the Christ.That cursed instrument of agony,Is conscience; human conscience is the cross—The cross whereon our Joy is crucified.My Lord, I will redeem thee from thy cross,And give thee burial in mine aching heart,Whence thou shalt rise and henceforth ever reignOver the Kingdom of the blessed flesh. IDOLATRY I stood before a leg in the museum,A marble leg, a mutilated leg,Supported by a rod of polished bronze.This leg of some hermaphroditic godWas carved in Greece, when ancient Greece wasyoung.In deepest reverence I stood and gazedUpon this relic of an absent god.And as I stood I wondered if perchanceIdolatry is not this very act,That thus enshrines an ancient piece of stone,Whilst living sculptors are compelled to wasteIn fruitless idleness that precious powerWhich carves the Victories of Samothrace.Idolators, ye worship graven stonesBut are indifferent to the gods that carve them. TO ARTURO GIOVANNITTI Arturo Giovannitti, fellow workerIn song and in revolt, sing on! sing on!The battling warriors in the war of classesHave need of your inspired, inspiring voice,You are the rebel, leader, poet, prophet,You have already worn the martyr's crown.If there be in me just one spark of envy,It is that I was not like you in gaol.I envied you that most supreme distinctionOf living in the shadow of the crossWith all the sacred shades of martyred rebels,A fellow worker of departed Christs. NIGHTMARE I had a dream, I had a horrid dream.I dreamt that Byron travels for a houseThat handles wines from Portugal and Spain,That Shelley is a cashier of a bank,That Keats is valet to a wealthy Jew,That Oscar Wilde lays bricks, that Edgar PoeIs selling silks and satins on the road,And that Walt Whitman, he of noble height,Is manager of a department store.And I would have dreamed on, had not disgust,A flood of dire disgust, awakened me,And I myself was forced to rush downtownTo live the life I shudder at in dream. LINES WRITTEN ON SEEING HENRI'SPAINTING OFTHE LADY IN BLACK VELVET The Lady in black velvet is the night,The deep, uncanny, weird, mysterious night,The witching, troubling, awe-inspiring night,Serene and silent, sweet and subtle night,Tempestuous, tragic, black and feverish night.The Lady in black velvet is the night,Her robe of black as black as blackest night,Enfolds a world—a world of sleepless night,A world of sighs, of cravings and of crimes,Of maddening joys, of languors that consume,Of pains unbearable, of livid fears,Of nightmares and of dreams.Then there's the sombre gray of shifting cloudsWhose masses rent asunder now revealThe radiant luminary of the night,Her silv'ry, radiant face is Queen of night.The Lady in black velvet is the night. THE BABE Fruit of a moment of supremest bliss,A passionate embrace, a long drawn kiss,Soft, pink and warm and chubby little thing,Most helpless being, despotic as a king.Third cousin to the gold-fish, the kitten and the chick,As free from care as they are, as shame-free and asquickTo feel that life means living and living must be joy,That nothing is of value unless it be a toy. A SCENARIO Scene I. The time—a glorious summer afternoon.The place—somewhere along the Palisades.Rocks here and there; some trees and many bushes.A youthful artist, seated on a rock,With great strokes paints the sun-illumined Hudson.A fair young woman enters on the scene,Absorbed in picking many kinds of flowers.The youthful artist, catching sight of her,Stands up and drops his palette and his brushes.And when she sees the youth she drops the flowers.They stand in silence looking at each other.He then approaches her to raise her flowers—And then she smiles, and he says foolish things,Deliciously absurd and foolish things.The insects are abuzzing, and the leaves—The foliage of the bushes and the treesAre whispering—are gossiping in whispers.He takes her by the hand and kisses her,He kisses her and takes her in his arms,And carries her behind a clump of bushes. Scene II. The time and place and scene just as before.From left to right there enters on the sceneQuite simultaneously a man and woman.Each reads a book while walking, so absorbedThat they well-nigh collide with one another.He begs her pardon which, of course, she grantsHe asks her if they have not met before,Her face seems so familiar, and she says:Perhaps he saw her somewhere at a lecture.And so they start to talk about their books,About their lectures and about their books.They seat themselves upon a rock and talk,And talk and talk and talk and talk and talk.The insects are abuzzing and the leaves—-The foliage of the bushes and the treesAre whispering, are gossiping in whispers.And from behind the softly swaying bushesEscape the sounds of kisses and of sighs,The kisses and the sighs of youthful lovers.And all the time the woman and the manSit arguing, discussing and discussingPsychology, sociology and ethics.So different it is behind the bushes.And while some hug and kiss and others argue,A sudden gloom spreads over everything.The azure sky is now a sky of ink,The lightning flashes and the thunder claps,The shower is terrific'ly intense.Both couples find an overhanging rock,A scanty shelter 'gainst a raging storm.A blinding lightning flash, a thunder clap,All four lie dead.Is there a moral?Guess! THE TEMPLE Round, full and fertile is her abdomen,Even as Mother Earth.O! tree of life bearing the fruit of love,O! precious shell a precious pearl enclosing,O! wondrous instrument whereon love playsA fiery rhapsody,The echo whereof is a human life.O! blessed mother of the child of man.Ye fools, detach your gaze from godless heavens,God is right here if you would worship God,The mystery of life and love is God,And every pregnant woman is God's temple. SHELLEY Lucifer! dripping with celestial splendour,All aglow with cosmic rebellion,Thundering forth pious blasphemies,Chanting sacrilegious hymns,Thy voice is like unto the trumpet soundsOf the Archangels of the ApocalypseCalling the dead to life.Meteor fallen from the bosom of infinitudeInto the common clay,Strange visitant from another orb,Permeated with the music of the spheres,Replete and radiant with rarest gems,Perplexing, exciting, soothing, betwitching.Lucifer! Prometheus! Dionysos! Shelley! THE SCULPTOR AND THE CLAY The sculptor, man, in woman mostly seesThe clay of which to model gods of love.Some, cunning little cupids only are,The little rascal gods of light flirtation,Who like the fire-flies on a summer nightAre luminous a moment—and that's all.While others are the serious gods of love,Majestic and intense as life itself,Mysterious and perplexing as the Sphinx,Relentless as the furies or as death,As maddening as poison of the snake,As soothing as is balm upon a wound,And sweet as that which passeth understanding.As sweet as that and sometimes just as bitter.Such are the statues man, the sculptor, mouldsOf woman—clay.d&gt; CONTEMPT I spit upon the laws that thieves have madeTo give the crooked strength to rob the weak.I spit upon a country full of wealthWhere millions live in squalor and in want.I spit upon a flag that waves aboveA nation made of masters and of slaves.I spit upon religions that defendA hell on earth, and preach a life to come.I spit upon all morals that contendThat joy of life is not life's highest end.I spit upon the education thatMakes pygmies out of what might have been men.Upon this whole damned system do I spit,And while I spit—l weep. WILLIAM MORRIS Dreamer o£ dreams—dreamer of golden dreams,Explorer of the rainbow-lands of yore,Columbus of Arcadian Continents,Poetic founder of Utopian states.Dreamer of dreams? Dreamer of only dreams?A master worker with the mind and handWho made the beautiful and useful wed,An alchemist who turned all work to art.Dreamer of dreams? Maker of wondrous things?A knight in mortal combat for a cause,A sower of emancipation's seed,A master builder of a better world. DON JUAN'S SONG From maids yet in their spring-time teensTo full blown thirty summer queens,I love them all!From golden blondes and deep brunettesTo Titian-locked one ne'er forgets—I love them all!From fairies frail or plump or slenderTo women built with queenly splendor,I love them all!From damsels pale and melancholyTo matrons gay and widows jolly,I love them all!From maidens unsophisticatedTo syrens well initiated,I love them all! I love them all! EASTER ON FIFTH AVENUE Capital best qualifies the weatherThat Easter Sunday donned for the occasionAnd the parade was also capital,It was indeed a capital parade.The gorgeous gowns, the stunning Easter hatsWere capital and those hand-made complexionsDown to the escorts groomed with perfect styleDown to the sermons that the preachers preachedIn fashionable churches were most capital.Indeed the sight I saw that Easter mornAlong Fifth Avenue was capital,Upon the sidewalks silently and slowThe grand cortege of capital marched on.And whilst I was enjoying this grand sightThere rose before my mind another sight:I saw the street between the sidewalks filledIn compact mass with wan and worn spectatorsWho were in silence viewing the parade,It was a mob of children, men and womenWhose pallid faces and whose piteous ragsGave to the spectacle a capital contrast,'Twas Easter, Easter, lo! The Christ has risen!Upon the whole the show was capital. CONTEMPLATION I went into a house of many lofts,And in each loft I saw a thousand men,And women, too, and children, too, I saw.And all around arose a deaf'ning roar—The roaring of machines o'er which were bentThe toilers toiling at their tiresome task.And as I stood and gazed upon this sceneI wondered why it was—l wondered why....I went into a house of gilded halls,And in each hall there shone a thousand lights,And many men and women also shone.Delightful music mingled with perfume.Around luxurious tables, diners satEnjoying luscious viands, mellow wines.And as I stood and gazed upon this scene,I thought of toilers and I understood. CONFIDENCES I have to go to work to win my bread,When oft upon my way the Muse of song,Espying me from far approaches meAnd takes me by the hand as tenderlyAs would a sister take her little brother.She whispers words as sparkling as champagne,As warm as blood, as pure as morning dew,And so enchants me that I cannot helpBut yield unto the tempting muse of song.She takes me from the world's drear, dusty roadAnd leads me into that mysterious parkWhere lies the limpid lake of inspiration.The flowers of life and death grow in this park—Of love and hate, the flowers of joy and pain,Of smiles and sighs, of laughter and of tears,The blooms of hope and those of disillusion.All, all these flowers grow in this wondrous park.I drink some water from the Muse's palm,The water of the lake of inspiration.And then in silence do I wend my wayThrough rows of silent and mysterious flowers,Inhaling all the odors of the flowers,The sweet and bitter odors of the flowers.And like the bee, I also make some honey,Alas! my honey is not always sweet.Perhaps because the flowers of life are bitter.Then I am harshly driven from this EdenBy the compulsion of a god I hate,And I must go to work to win my bread.The honey of the poet has no market.Tempt me no more, dear Muse, or else I'll starve. IN THE LIBRARY As she sat facing me the other dayReading a book, while I was writing verses,Or rather trying to, for I could notDetach my gaze from her bewitching visage,Nor could my mind in rhythmic furrows flow,Pursuing thoughts to her all unrelated,When like the heaving billows that are yieldingTo the attracting powers of the moon,My every thought by her has been attracted.I thus bethought me: "Wherefore write I poems,When here, before me, breathes a living poem,Compared to whom, all poems are as dustBesides a sweetly smelling, blooming flower."So I lay down my pen and gazed at her. BYRON The thought of Byron wakens in my mindThe vision of a solitary treeTitanic and contorted on a cliffThat overhangs a wild abysmal sea.Its mighty root, a maze of tentacles,Has put a lasting clutch-hold on the rock,Much like the miser's fingers on his gold.Within its arteries the sap of life,The procreative juice in torrents flows,And gushes forth luxurious vegetation.The foliage-covered head is always raisedIn bold defiance of the elements.Undaunted by the tempest's fiendish rage,Calm under the concerted stare of stars,The fickle lover of a fickle moon.On balmy days or peaceful summer evesThe rendezvous of master-singer birds.Perennial, rich, melodious and sad,Passionate and desolate and wildAnd beautiful and always beautiful. CHIAROSCURO I met a plum-hued Venus late one night,Live specimen of pure Egyptian art.The regal amplitude of tropic zones,Their rich luxuriance breathed on her faceAnd radiated from her clothed form.Her eyes shone with that lustful brilliancyOf eyes of jungle prowlers who at nightA-snifHing and a-growling hunt for mates.Her mellow, soft and sing-song voice was whisp'ringEnticing promises of untold joysTo taste of in this paradise of jet.Alas! the curse of value, price and profitIndelibly was branded on her brow,The brow that ages past was of a savage.Oh! Thou hast conquered glorious Christian progress. DESPONDENCY I sadly watch the hours go by,The hours, the days, the months, the years,And what's called life shall soon go by,And helpless and with fruitless rageI watch the hours of life go by.And I must curse when I would bless,And I who am all love, must hate,And I who have been born to singMust spend myself in moans and tears.And must I perish on this rockA cruel God has bound me to?Will not some Hercules ere comeAnd make me free? IN MEMORIAM Within the mansion of my memoryThere is a sumptuous chapel, where at timesI kneel in deep devotion at the shrinesOf all the blessed women I have loved.I burn for them the incense of my thoughts;Before their sacred images I layThe flowers of my purest sentiments,And on their altars piously I lightThe pallid candles of my vain regrets.1 oft hold retrospective rendezvousWithin the chapel of the loves of yore. SPRING SONG I too shall sing thy glory, Spring,Oh, season in thyself a song;In every tongue thy name doth ringWith music we remember long.Fruehling! Primavera! Spring!Thy name to whisper is to sing. Why should I seek sweet melodyAnd softly sounding words to sayAll that the springtime means to me?Why should I make an effort, pray,When Fruehling! primavera! spring!To whisper only is to sing. TO A FRIEND You sigh because you are not loved.You only think you are not loved.I also sighed as you now sigh,Because I thought I was not loved.But I was loved—how I was loved!She lay awake at night and dreamedOf me, who thought I was not loved.Some loves like blooms that blush unseen,Remain unknown and unconfessed,And we oftimes are best belovedWhen loved with love in silence shrined.So be not sad, dear friend, nor sigh,But feel assured there is a heartIn this wide world that beats for you. I SAW THREE NUNS I saw three nuns go by the other day:Three upright coffins slowly gliding by. Funereal, black and chilling to behold,The ghastly shadows of a defunct past.The worms of ignorance and superstitionGive to these dead, the semblances of life.The past has not yet buried all its dead. I saw three nuns go by the other day:Three upright coffins slowly gliding by. A WOMAN LOVES ME A woman loves me!'Tis not of her I sing whose womb has beenThe primal cradle of my tender self;I mean not mother-love.A woman loves me!'Tis not of her I sing who also sprangFrom that same source whence also I have sprung;I mean not sister-love.A woman loves me!I sing of her who "from the mobs of life"Has chosen me as him to whom aloneShe will unlock her body and her soulTo welcome all my love. ELIZABETH GURLEY FLYNN(The Workers' Jeanne d'Arc) She too a vision had and voices heard:She heard the groans of slaving, starving workers:She had a vision of their liberation.She also mounted steed and armor donned.The soap-box or the platform is her steed.Her coat of mail defiance of the powers.She too to victory an army leads.Her army is the risen proletariat,In arms against their pitiless exploiters.She too is hated by the church and state.They'd burn her at the stake if they but dared,Condemned for witchcraft or some other crime.She too shall live an ever-shining glory,In human history, in human hearts—An even brighter glory than Jeanne d'Arc.The Maid of Orleans routed but the English,And to a worthless king restored a throne,To sway a sceptre o'er a land of serfs.Lead by Elizabeth we'll rout the mastersAnd to the workers of the world restoreThe earth itself and all its joys and riches.Let all men rally round her blood-red bannerWhich bears the motto of the revolution:"Death to all masters! Freedom to all slaves!" JEALOUSY As you peruse those heavy, dusty volumesWith tense attention hour after hour,Whilst totally indifferent to me,—To me, who sees in you the book of books,To whom the very cover of this book,Your outward aspect, is more interestingThan the contents of all books ever printed. Is it a wonder I would like to buildA mammoth pile of all the books there areAnd let the raging fire consume them all? MISERS I know of misers meaner than are thoseWho lay awake at night to guard their treasure,Which is in their possession only dust,A sordid, useless heap of gilded dustThat might have given peace and bread to many. The misers whom I mean are fair to see,Delightful to converse with and to kiss;They fascinate us with their wondrous eyesAs serpents fascinate the little birds.They draw us closer to them, ever closer,Then suddenly like serpents they coil upAnd put beyond our grasp their queenly treasures,Alas! in their possession to remain,But useless, vain and perishable thingsThat might have given ecstasy to many. SWINBURNE Algernon Swinburne, is there not in theeSomething akin to bells that ring at sea?In their sound so clearThere is little cheer,When their knell I hearI recoil with fear. Though thy voice be clear as the day's light,It is pregnant with mystery, death, and night. OUR LADY OF INFINITE MERCY I often think of a mysterious woman—There must be somewhere a mysterious woman,Mysterious and most marvelous of beauty,Most beautiful,—miraculously kind,Indeed a kindness passing understanding,So great a kindness that it seemeth madness.It seemeth madness, for she sallies forthAt dead of night into the dismal streets,Into the dismal and deserted streets,Monotously criss-crossing the city,The monstrous, lightless, heartless, sleeping city,Where prowling as the vermin shunning light,Or derelicts adrift on dreary seas,She seeks the disinherited of joyShe seeks the stunted, the disfigured children,The starved, diseased and the discouraged childrenOf stepmother society, seeks them out,Whom everybody shuns and no one loves.She seeks them out and gives herself to them,This queenly woman, marvelous of beauty,Entirely gives herself to those of whomThe thought alone makes shudder with disgust.She gives herself even as the twilight entersA fetid, vermin-ridden, mildewed dungeon,A whiff of heaven in a life of hell.Oh, have you, have you ever seen that woman,That beautiful, that kind, mysterious woman?She is our Lady of Infinite Mercy.Blessed be our Lady of Infinite Mercy! A PAGAN'S PRAYER I sought the shrine of Eros and I prayed:—O God omnipotent, O God supreme,O God of love who art the God of Gods,Behold thy worshipper upon his kneesProstrated in the dust.Let not my supplications rise in vainFrom depths iniquitous to heights sublime.0 grant me my request, good God of love.Unlock for me thy secret treasure houseAnd make me master of the arts of love.My heart conceives great symphonies of loveThat my poor body cannot execute.1 am a Beethoven, I am a Wagner,My orchestration needs a thousand pieces,But am restricted to a shepherd's reed.Reveal to me the secrets of the ancients,Instruct me in the art of love long lost;That love of time when Gods and humans mingled.In love I am a God, in love expressionI am alas! a frail, a weakling human.O Eros! Eros! Eros! God of love,Give me the power to love as Gods can love. NIETZSCHE A sombre silhouetteAgainst a sun-rise skyIn solemn solitude,The wanderer goes by.The shadow that he castsUpon the plains belowStrikes terror to the heartsOf those that do not know.O messenger sublimeWho hailest from that landWhere joy and beauty reign;If they could understand! . . .If they could understandThe message that you bring,They'd strew your path with palms;Hosannahs would they sing.Strength superceding faith,Joy superceding fear:The Super-Christ has come;The Superman is near. . . . TO A NEGRO BELLE You make me dream of distant tropic climes,Luxurious vegetation; nights sereneBy burning passion made tempestuous,The witching scent of rare exotic flowersThat sooth and render sweetly languorous,Of music soft and weird, whose savage rhythmCompels each fibre of the frame to dance.I see you as the princess of an isleWhose jungles are replete with beasts of prey,And whose vast forests ever are aliveWith cries and frolickings of birds and apes;Whose villages of bamboo huts are fullOf dusky-hued and happy naked people.iYour simple hearted subjects pay you homage;Prostrated in the dust, they weirdly chantThy praises, even as in my own way,I sing your praises, sweet, exotic princess.Oh, let me enter your enchanted realm,And make of me your happy, humble slave. WALT WHITMAN Mountain-like he towers, a MatterhornMidst many minor peaks;And like a mountain, mighty, vast and wild;A finger pointing into boundless space,A head raised high above the shifting clouds,A heart that beats in unison with all,An eye that first beholds the rising sunAnd is the last to see her parting glory,A clarion-call to freedom,A gesture of revolt,A world-encircling brotherhood embrace,An exaltation of the lowly,A vindication of the truth,A glorification of the human body,A declaration of the right of allTo live, to love, to dare and to do,A hymn to life, a rhapsody of joy! LIFE-LUST My mouth—the mouth of my whole being watersFor all the fruit upon the lap of Life;The luscious fruit of Life, (delicious fruit,All running over with the juice of joy.)Life seems a banquet and my gourmand sensesWould gorge themselves with all good things thereof.My taste, my touch, my smell, my sight, my hearingWould drink the seasoned vintages of Life,And relish all Life's rarest fruits and viands.Content to go whene'er the feast is overContent, the feast was not prepared in vain. ON A TALK OF SPINOZA Durant spoke of Spinoza yesterdayAnd I sat list'ning, feeling, meditating.And now and ever afterwards will feelAnd live and think more deeply than before,For having heard Durant speak of Spinoza.Spinoza! what a mighty, mighty name!All Alexanders, Caesars and Napoleons—Mere specks of dust upon a polished lense,Compared to that poor polisher of lenses.He polished lenses for myopic eyes,The world's myopic eyes hath need of them—And long will need them,—poor myopic world.My own sight seems improved since I have heardDurant speak of Spinoza yesterday. THE REVOLT OF THE RAGGED We who have but rags to wear,Let us go out on strikeAnd face the robber-master classIn all our naked might.Do they not hold that man is madeIn the image of his God?So we refuse to desecrateThe image of their God.No longer will we soil our limbs,These beautiful, these wondrous limbsWith filthy, fetid rags.Where is the beast so wild,The reptile or the worm so base in kind,Would not disdain the rags "creation's kings"Disgrace their bodies with?Oh be not shocked at our forced nakedness,Ye masters who refuse to clothe your slaves.Do you not steal the wool that we have shorn,The cloth we weave, the garments that we made?You stole our clothes, behold us naked now.Let us arise and from our bodies tearThe fetid uniform that brands us slaves.In countless masses let us rally forthAnd through each pore of our free body shoutOur right to life, to liberty, and joy. I'VE SEEN A PRINCESS I've read of princesses in fairy talesAnd I have sometimes dreamed of princessesBut not until to-day have I beheld,Beheld or ever spoken to a princess.Yes, I have seen and spoken to a princessIn body and in mind; in thought and gesture,Indeed, in every way a perfect princess.Since I am not some mighty potentateIn whom it would not seem as sheer presumptionTo lay his heart and domains at her feet,Would I at least could be a humble pageForever in attendance on his princess,To serve her and to worship her in silence,And be allowed as wages for his hireTo breathe within the shadow of her charms.But though my princess be reality,My hopes, my aspirations, my desires,Alas, are dreams, mere dreams, alas, mere dreams. THE GREAT DISCARD I see a mighty junk-heap rising high,Old bibles, crosses, crescents, six-point starsAnd other symbols, idol's fetiches—The bloody tools of greed and superstition,That have tormented man for centuries,Disfiguring his body and his mind.I see the flags of all the various nations,In whose defense men slaughtered one anotherUpon this junk-heap also ; and the booksWherein the laws are writ, that give to manThe power over man;And all the institutions that have helpedTo make of man an abject slave or tyrant,These, too, are on this junk-heap. THE SCULPTOR'S RHAPSODY I am a God!I am drunk with the joy of creating.At my touch form comes out of chaos.With a handful of clay I build monuments,Vaster than the pyramids,More mysterious than the Sphinx,As startling as the Colossus of Rhodes.My statues are austere as ancient cathedrals,Their silhouette effaces the sky,Their shadows engulf entire cities.I am a God!I am drunk with the joy of creating. ATAVISM O, have you ever heard the gutter's call?E'er felt the strange attraction of the sewer?Or ceded to the urge from underneath,To wallow in the mire, to plunge, to sinkInto the frightful abyss of perdition?Were you e'er tempted from some siren's lips,To cull the bliss, you know, is venomous?Or did you feel the satanic desire,To soil and mutilate the sacred imageOf that ideal you worshiped all your life?It is the atavistic voice that's waking,The dormant beast in you. Beware! Beware! TO ONE WHO COULD NOT LOVE I You told me that you love the water,The cascades' roaring, rushing water,The rivers' gently flowing water,The pools' mysterious silent water,The erring brooklets' whisp'ring water,The oceans' moaning, hissing water,The oceans' seething, sighing water,It's thundering, carressing water.My love for you is also as the water,The roaring, rushing, silent, whisp'ring water.The thundering, the seething, sighing water.Oh, love me, for my love is like the water,Did you not tell me that you love the water? II I've been a profligate till now,Have squandered of the treasures of my heartIn reckless fashion.Henceforth my beloved,Each precious scrap of love,Each feeling, thought or passion,Is yours alone.My very life is yours. III You sometime make me dream of fair Granada,Of olden days of Moorish reign and glory;At other times you make me feel the gloomOf Christian Spain, sepulchral and morose.You are as the Alhambra when you smile,Gold-tinted, graceful, radiating joy.But when you frown or are indifferent,Then like to the Escurial you are,Depressing, full of sombreness and chill. IV I strolled through lonely by-paths in the park,It was the hour, it was the mystic hour,When 'tis no longer day, nor yet is night.When o'er all nature hangs a solemn hush,And everything is peaceful and serene.And thus I strolled along and thought of her—And then I sat upon a rustic benchAnd thought of her,—and only thought of her.And o'ver all nature hung a solemn hush;And I was sad, and it was growing dark.And as I sat there on the rustic benchClose by to me I heard two voices speak.They spoke Italian. Softly did they speak,And there was sadness in their voices too.One spoke of Beatrice as angel mightHave spoken of the queen of all the heavens;The other spoke of Laura as a bardWould speak of her who might have been the queen,—The queen of every kingdom of the earth.I turned my head and seated by my sideI saw the sad, illustrious Tuscan bards,The requiem of whose unrequited loveReverberates throughout eternity.I did not rise and go, but kept my place.Is not my love as great as was their love?And is not she as beautiful, as cold,As hopelessly indifferent and cold,As ever Beatrice and Laura were?And so I also spoke about my love,Then we were silent sitting side by side.Upon that rustic bench in Central Park,Along a lonesome by-path in the park. It was the hour, it was that mystic hourWhen 'tis no longer day nor yet is night;And o'er all nature hangs a solemn hush,And everything is peaceful and serene.Then they both went away so quietlyThat I was unaware that they had goneUntil I turned my head and saw them not. V My heart is like a man condemned to death,Who in the corner of his gloomy cellHugs one last spark of hope.Bright as a diamond in the dark of night,And as a diamond difficult to crush,Is this last spark of hope. VI Since Orpheus with the magic of his music,Could charm the wildest beast, why could not IEnthrall you with the music of my love?Is not love's music magical enough,Or is your heart stone deaf?Even if so!I will perform a miracle and causeYour heart to hear love's music. VII And even if you loved me not,If you but knew the pain I feelWhen you but breathe a word that's harsh,When you betray the faintest frown;And when you mock me for my love,Or chide me for the least caress,If you but knew the pain I feel.Aye, even if you loved me not,You ne'er would frown at me or mockMy love for you, or harshly speak,Or bid me not to kiss your hand;Instead you'd treat me as a child,You'd treat me as a child that's sick,And patiently you would submitTo my caress; you would allowMy feverish hands to stroke your hair,My quivering lips to kiss your brow,My famished eyes to feast on you,And my delirious heart to spin:To spin a spider's web of love,To make your heart its captive fly.Aye, even if you loved me not,If you but knew the pain I feel,Whene'er I think you love me not,You'd treat me as a little child;You'd tell me love's sweet fairy tale,I will believe love's fairy tale.Please tell me love's sweet fairy tale,Aye, even if you love me not. VIII The sun is warm and bright,All nature sings;The song of love and life is in the air,The flowing waters and the rolling hills,The grass we tread upon, the birds that fly,'Hie humming insects, aye, all men, all beasts,All things are happy in the sun's caress.But in my heart, in my unhappy heart,The icy blast of winter still persists,And desolation reigns.Your frown obliterates the sun for me,And your indifference is worse than death.And in my heart, in my unhappy heart,Dire desolation reigns. IX This is the tale of an unhappy sculptor,A shaft of marble radiantly white,Whose adamantine substance would not yieldTo the impassioned efforts of the sculptor.The chisel struck the irresponsive rockAgain, again, again, but all in vainUntil at last discouraged and exhaustedHe sinks down at the foot of this cold stone.That might have been a living Galathea,But is alas the tombstone of Pygmalion. X It was a sepulchre I have been wooing:Fair to behold was she and seeming warm,But deep within as cold as death itself,And to love's fervent pleadings irresponsive;Aye, even as the tomb.Deaf to the voice of poetry and love,Alas! she's doubly deaf.It was a sepulchre I have been wooing.
