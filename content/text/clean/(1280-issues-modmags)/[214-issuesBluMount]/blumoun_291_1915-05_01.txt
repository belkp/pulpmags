M. de Zayas MATERNITY From Le Mot, Paris, March 6,1915. I wish to tell you something that borders on the sublime. Unable to hide her anxiety any longer, a chambermaid of Madame de F. con - fessed that she had had, twenty years ago, an illegitimate child and that that child was fighting in the Argonne. Then, as Madame F. reproached the girl for having remained silent so long and was consoling her by reminding her that her own son was also on the firing line. "Oh! madame," answered the maid, "it is not the same thing; my boy by his fine behaviour has given me back my honor!’’ Lasting remorse, humble pride, patient wait - ing. That is the real French woman. BEING HUMAN IN NEW YORK A company of Irish players — amateurs —have been giving performances at the Neighborhood Playhouse on Grand Street. When reaching the theater from the Third Avenue elevated one has to walk several blocks down this densely populated street. If you are walking—as is prob - able—at the gait of a man who has to catch a train or make an appointment you will feel annoyed at the leisurely pace of the people in the street. While you dodge in and out they are strolling slowly up and down or chatting on the door-steps. They are going nowhere. They are in the street for no purpose but to take a breath of air. Husbands and wives walk arm in arm. Such things are not done on Fifth Avenue. They impede speed—and besides one should not display affection in public. When the curtain falls at the end of the per - formance you notice that three plays—six acts in all—have been played in the same settings. — The plays violate the rules of dramatic construc - tion. The actors know little of the laws of acting. Yet they hold your attention and inter - est, and when you reach home you feel re - freshed. You have spent a few hours free from rules and conventions. You have had a glimpse at real human beings, who have retained the courage to be their simple selves. WATCH THEIR STEPS Apollinaire that profound observer of the superficial brought to artistic significance the squeaking of the "new shoes of the poet." Unhappily we have no poet in New York who could sing of the forms of the shoes that women For the first time the spirit of modern art has been genuinely manifested in this country. Women’s shoes reveal a new mentality at work. A BUNCH OF KEYS J. B. KERFOOT LE COQ GAULOIS STEICHEN to heed the yelping of the yellow journalists of all shades that have constantly hounded him, certain that those who cried out against him most were those who most needed his wisdom, he has gone on working, meeting all hindrances and difficulties, lastly, turning into the country's greatest good the present cataclysm that might so easily have been its ruin. If we wish to find the greatest imaginative powers of our country, do we think of our artists? The question is almost ludicrous when we com - pare the realized imaginations of the artistic and the business world. Where is our most effective, our most adventurous thought? Who creates and guides and supports our universities, our charitable and artistic and scientific en - deavors of every sort? In short who is the only man without whom we could not get along, politicians, social workers and college professors notwithstanding? Finally, if wrong has been done, who has been and will continue to be the only man with sufficient knowledge to remedy those wrongs? The answer to all these ques - tions is too obvious. Our social structure may be a machine that is clumsy, inefficient, anti - quated, but verily it hath its god. £9l —TWELVE NUMBERS A YEAR- Subscription price, regular edi - tion: — ONE DOLLAR.
