A 4=Minute Lesson in Personal Efficiency To Help You Discover the Biggest Ambition of Ycur Life and How to Achieve it Quickly By Edward Earle Purinton, the Famous Efficiency Expert RECENTLY I talked with the man who draws the highest salary in the world. 1 asked him how he had succeeded. He answered quietly, “I have not succeeded. No real man ever succeeds. There is always another goal ahead.” Although this man has outrun every rival, he has not reached the goal of his own satisfaction —any more than YOU have. But he is efficient. Are you efficient ? Efficiency will save you many years of grinding, discouraging, and expensive haphazard experience. Is it not much belter to learn and profit by the mistakes and false moves of others than to waste valuable days and years waiting for experience? Don't rely on the hope of doing better “next time." With the proper know- ledge you will save mistakes. It has been my privilege to act as teacher and counsellor to thousands of ambitious inen and women—from the heads of large companies to the most humble beginner in the ranks. And I have concluded that the average man engaged in a large enterprise who has not yet applied efficiency methods to his work has been losing from ,£200 to /20,cxx> a year— while the professional or industrial worker has probably been losing from £20 to £1,000 a year. For twenty years I have been studying at close range the exact reasons for these people's failure to get ahead. And into my new Practical Course in Personal Efficiency I have put, in compact form, the results of this study of individuals and business concerns. The Seven Lessons Give you the Essence of Efficient Living and Business Achievement. They teach you in a few pleasant evenings of study Mow to Measure Your Efficiency, How to Cet Ahead. How to Keep Well. How to Improve Your Finances. How to Organise Your Work, blow to be Efficient at Home- How to Plan Your Life. By showing you in my lessons what other men and women — just like yourself — have learned and done and been, I believe sincerely that I can save you about ten years of costly experiment, and, moreover, can show you how to use your strength, energy, and special abilities in a way which will certainly bhng you success. Efficiency is nothing less than the difference between wealth and poverty, fame and ob- scurity, power and weakness, health and disease, growth and death, hope and despair. The step from one of these extremes to the other i» a short and easy one—if you KNOW HOW. Take one of my pupils whom I shall call 3M Mr. X, because if I ever met an ‘'un^*]0n,e quantity,” he was one when he first can*® to me.	. * He has increased by about 500 per cen his daily output of work, his optimism ». will power, his health reserve, and his nnauc resources. How did he do it? First, he analysed himself. Have you ** done this—thoroughly ? If not, try doing now.	^ 1 can tell you I never saw such a cMW in a man.	_	I He changed his habits of living and >ncre*T^ his daily output of energy about 200 per cC“|efi He stopped being a pessimist and grU.,n ^ and became the most cheerful man ,n re whole organisation. Having grown .t\jSl friendly, he attracted a host of new fne . He prospered. He advanced. He bec*"*^ a leader. He developed courage.	^ But remember this: Mr. X was no- ^ exceptional man by any means. He # lust average to begin with. When I firs* * ^ him he was making £3 a week. is probably without a rival in his chosen —and his name if known throughou> ^ business world.

Medicines and drugs, diet treatments, exercise and "rest cures," have alike proved incapable of, or only partially and temporarily successful in, overcoming this condition. Small wonder, then, that the neurasthenic despairs of a cure—regards himself or herself as incurable. Neurasthenia arises from lack of Nerve Force. The only method of restoring lost Nerve Force i« to recharge the system with Electricity, the natural force secreted in the air we breathe, and which in itself is scarcely distinguishable from Nerve Force. For years the difficulty of the Scientist and the Physician has been to find a means, at once cheap, convenient, and comfortable to the jiaiient, of employing this treat vitalis- ing natural force.

To do so is not only futile, but is often very harmful, for in this connection the Nervous System requires Nourishment and Strength, not Stimulation. A little r- flection will convince the reader of the lo^c ai.d common sense of this statement. The primary trouble in all phases of Nerve Exhaustion is starvation or semi-starvation of the Nerve Cells, the reason being that the sufferer fails to extract from his daily food the preciou9 concentrated nutrient the Nerve Cells live and thrive upon.

His eyelids scarcely stirred. Then again there came a tapping, this time at the door. The frown re- turned to his face. He looked up. •• Well ? ” The door opened. A small, sharp- faced boy poked in his head. " A lady to see you, sir.” " What ? " said Field. His frown deepened. " I can’t see any one. 1 told you so.” " Says she won't go away till she’s seen you, sir,” returned the boy glibly. " Can’t get her to budge, sir.” " Oh, tell her-” said Field, and stoppedasif arrestedbya sudden thought. " \\Tio is it ? " he asked. A grin so brief that it might have been a mere twitch of the features passed over the boy's face. *' Wouldn’t give no name, sir. But she’s a nob of some sort.” he said. "Got a shiny satin dress on under her doak. ’* Field's eyes went for a moment to Ins 273 Hutchinson’s Story Magazine littered papers. Then lie picked up a newspaper from a chair and threw it over them. “ Show her in ! *’ he said briefly. He got up with the words, and stood with his back to the window, watching the half-open door. There came a slight rustle in the pas- sage outside. The small boy reappeared and threw the door wide with a flourish. A woman in a dark cloak and hat with a thick veil over her face entered. The door closed behind her. Field stood motionless. She advanced with slight hesitation. " I hope you will forgive me,” she said, " for intruding upon you." Her voice was rich and deep. It held a throb of nervousness. Field came deliberately forward. " I presume I can be of use to you," he said. His tone was dry. There was scant encouragement about him as he drew forward a chair. She hesitated momentarily before ac- cepting it, but finally sat down with a gesture that seemed to indicate physical weakness of some sort. “ Yes, I want your help,” she said. Field said nothing. His face was the face of the trained man of law. It ex- pressed naught beyond a steady, im- personal attention. He drew up another chair and seated himself facing her. She looked at him through her veil for several seconds in silence. Finally, with manifest effort, she spoke. "It was so good of you to admit me —especially not knowing who I was. You recognise me now, of course? I am Lady Violet Calcott.” *' I should recognise you more easily,” he said in his emotionless voice. ** if you would be good enough to put up your veil.” His tone was perfectly quiet and cour- tion.

" Yes, I recognise you, of course- And—you wanted to consult me ? * “ No ! ” She leaned forward in j*c| chair with white hands clasped. * 1 wanted to beg of you to tell rnc— you have refused to undertake Burleig Wentworth’s defence ! ” She spoke with a breathless intensity* Her wonderful eyes were lifted to his eyes that had dazzled half London, Field only looked down into them as h® might have regarded one of his leg** documents.

You would only enhance it," she said, speaking very rapidly as if some °Httruction to speech had very suddenly been removed. ** You are practically the top of the wave. You would •Bcceed where another man would fail. And indeed—oh, indeed he is innocent! He must be innocent ! Things look black against him. But he can be saved *°*nehow.

Ah, bow shall I persuade you of that ? ’* Her voice quivered upon a note of de- *Pair. “ Surely you are human ! There '’Just be some means of moving you. Vou can't want to see an innocent man 8° under ! ” The beautiful eyes were blurred with jtars as she looked at him. She caught ~*ek a piteous sob. The cloak had fallen about her shoulders. They gleamed an exquisite whiteness. The man’s look still rested upon her %>th unflickering directness. Again that Peculiar smile hovered about his grim Nath. Yes. I am human," he said, after a Nse. " I do not esteem myself as temptation. As you probably |yw, I am a self-made man, of very BBbary extraction. But—I do not feel ^***pted to lake upBurleigh Wentworth’s I am sorry if that fact should you any disappointment. I do why it should.

I f—if you couldn't get him acquitted, you could get him lenient treatment. You could save his life from utter ruin.” She clasped and unclasped her hands in nervous excitement. Her face was piteous in its strain and pathos. And still Field looked unmoved upon her distress. “ I am afraid I can't help you,** he said. " My eloquence would need a very strong incentive in such a case as this to balance my lack of sympathy.” '* What do you mean by—incentive ? " she said, her voice very low. " 1 will do anything—anything in my power— to induce you to change your mind. I never lost hope until—I heard you had refused to defend him. Surely—surely —there is some means of persuading you left ! ” For the first time his smile was openly cynical. “ Don’t offer me money, please ! ” he said. She flushed vividly, hotly. " Mr. Field ! I shouldn't dream of it!" '• No ? ” he said. ” But it was more than a dream with you when you first entered this room." She dropped her eyes from his. “ I—didn't—realise-” she said in confusion. He bent forward slightly. It was an attitude well known at the Law Courts. " Didn't realise-” he repeated in his quiet, insistent fashion. She met his look again—against her will. “ I didn't realise what sort of man I had to deal with,’’ she said. " Ah ! '* said Field. “ And now ? M She shrank a little. There was some- thing intolerably keen in his calm utter- ance. Hutchinson’s Story Magazine “ I didn’t do it,” she said rather breathlessly. " Please remember that! " " I do,” he said. But yet his look racked her. She threw out her hands with a sudden, des- perate gesture and rose. " Oh, are you quite without feeling ? Wliat can I appeal to ? Docs position mean a great deal to you ? If so, my brother is very influential, and I have influential friends. I will do anything— anything in nay power. Tell me what —incentive you want ! ” Field rose also. They stood face to face—the self-made man and the girl who could trace her descent from a Nor- man baron. He was broad-built, grim, determined. She was slender, pale, and proud. For a moment he did not speak. Then, as her eyes questioned him, he turned suddenly to a mirror over the mantelpiece behind him and showed her herself in her unveiled beauty. “ Lady Violet,” he said, and his speech had a steely, cutting quality, *' you came into this room to bribe me lo defend a man whom I believe to be a criminal from the consequences of his crime. And when you found I was not to be so easily bought as you imagined, you asked me if I were human. I re- plied to you that I was human, and not above temptation. Since then you have been trying—very hard—to find a means to tempt me. But—so far—you have over- looked the most obvious means of all. You have told me twice over that you will do anything in your power. Do you mean—literally— that ? ” He was addressing the face in the glass, and still his look was almost brutally emotionless. It seemed to measure, to appraise. She met it for a few seconds, and then in spite of herself she flinched. *' Will you tell me what you mean ? she said in a very low voice. He turned round to her again. " Why did you come here yourself? he said. “ And at night ? ” She was trembling. " I had to come myself—as soon as knew. I hoped to persuade you.” " You thought,” he said mercilessly- " that, however I might treat others, could never resist you.” “ I hoped—to persuade you,” she saJ again. " By—tempting—me ? ” he sa* slowly. She gave a great start. Field He put out a quiet hand, and lai*1 ll upon her bare arm. "Wait a moment,plca5C‘ For a momttw he did not speak.

His hand was still upon her arm. It closed with a slow, remorseless pressure as he made quiet reply to her previous question. " Yes. I am in earnest." She flinched at last from the gaze of those merciless eyes. Hutchinson’s Story Magazine “ You ask the impossible,” she said. “ Then it is all the simpler for you to refuse," he rejoined. Her eyes were upon the hand that held her. Did he know that its grasp had almost become a grip ? It was by that, and that alone, that she was made aware of something human—or was it something bestial—behind that legal mask ? Suddenly she straightened herself and faced him. It cost her all the strength she had. " Mr. Field,” she said, and though her voice shook she spoke with resolution, "if I were to consent to this—extra- ordinary suggestion ; if I married you— you would not ask—or expect—more than that ? ” . “If you consent to marry me,” he said, '* it will be without conditions.” *' Then I cannot consent,” she said. " Please let me go ! ” He released her instantly, and, turn- ing, picked up her cloak. But she moved away to the window and stood there with her back to him, gazing down upon the quiet river. Its pearly stillness was like a dream. The rush and roar of London's many wheels had died to a monotone. The man waited behind her in silence. She had released the blind-cord, and was plucking at it mechanically, with fingers that trembled. Suddenly the blast of a siren from a vessel in mid-stream shattered the still- ness. The girl at the window quivered from head to foot ar. if it had pierced her. And then with a sharp movement she turned. “ Mr. Field ! ” she said, and stopped. He waited with absolute composure. She made a small but desperate ges- ture—the gesture of a creature trapped and helpless. “ I—will do it ! ” she said in a voice that was barely audible. "But if- if you ever come—to repent—don't blame me ! ” “ I shall not repent,” he said. She passed on rapidly. “ And—you will do your best—to save—Burleigh Wentworth ? ” “ I will save him,” said Field. She paused a moment ; then moved towards him, as if compelled against he* will. He put the cloak around her shoul- ders, and then, as she fumbled with i* uncertainly, he fastened it himself. “ Your veil ? ” he said. She made a blind movement. self-control was nearly gone. With do- solute steadiness he drew it down over her face. ” H ave you a conveyance waiting • he asked. “ Yes,” she whispered. He turned to the door. He was *° the act of opening it when she stayed him- “ One moment ! " she said. He stopped at once, standing her with his level eyes looking straig*1 at her.

The wind was P*o*’ing in from the river in rising gusts. “eblind-tassel tapped and tapped, now 0cre, now there, like a trapped creature *^king frantically for escape.

A moment he held then pulled it to him and, taking a •^knife from the table, grimly, deliber- *teIy. he severed the cord. ^he tassel lay in his hand, a silken slightly frayed, as if convulsive i*8ers had torn it.

II kJhe trial of Burleigh Wentworth for 7*Scry was one of the sensations of the A fashionable crowd went day BPfcr day to the stifling Court to watch progress.

It had set all London talking. The evidence against him was far-reaching and overwhelming. After the first shock no one believed him innocent. The re- sult of the trial was looked upon before its commencement as a foregone con- clusion until it became known that Per- cival Field, the rising man of the'day, had undertaken his defence, and then like the swing of a weather-cock public opinion veered. If Field defended him, there must be some very strong point in his favour, men argued. Field was not the sort to touch anything of a doubtful nature. . The trial lasted for nearly a week. During that time Lady Violet went day after day to the Court and sat with her veil down all through the burning hours. People looked at her curiously, question- ing if there really had been any definite understanding between the two. Did she really care for the man, or was it mere curiosity that drew her ? No one knew with any certainty. She wrapped herself in her reserve like an all-envelop- ing garment, and even those who re- garded themselves as her nearest friends knew naught of what she carried in her soul. All through the trial she sat in utter immobility, sphinx-like, unapproach- able, yet listening with tense attention to all that passed. Field’s handling of the case was a marvel of legal ingenuity. There were many who were attracted to tiie trial by that alone. He had made his mark, and whatever he said carried weight. When he came at last to make his speech for the defence, men and women listened with bated breath. It was one of the greatest speeches that the Criminal Court had ever heard. He flung into it the whole weight of his personality. He grappled like a giant with the rooted obstacles that 2/9 Hutchinson’s Story Magazine strewed his path, flinging them hither and thither by sheer force of will. His scorching eloquence blasted every op- posing power, consumed every tangle of adverse evidence. It was as if he fought a pitched battle for himself alone. He wrestled for the mastery rather than appealed for sympathy. And he won his cause. His scathing attacks, his magnetism, his' ruthless in- sistence left an indelible mark upon the minds of the jury—such a mark as no subsequent comments from the judge could efface or even moderate. The ver- dict returned was unanimous in spite of a by no means favourable summing-up. The prisoner was Not Guilty. At the pronouncement of the verdiot there went up a shout of applause such as that Court had seldom heard. The prisoner, rather white but still affecting sublime self-assurance, accepted it with a smile as a tribute to himself. But it was not really directed towards him. It was for the man who had defended him, the man who sat at the table below the dock and turned over a sheaf of papers with a faint, cynical smile at thecorners of his thin lips. This man, they said, had done the impossible. He had dragged the prisoner out of his morass by sheer titanic effort. Obviously Pcrcival Field had believed firmly in the inno- cence of the man he had defended, or he had not thus triumphantly vindicated him. The crowd, staring at him, wondered how the victory affected him. It had certainly enhanced his reputation. It had drawn from him such a display of genius as had amazed even his colleagues. Did he feel elated at all over his success ? Was he spent by that stupendous effort? No one knew? Now that it was over, he look^ utterly indifferent. He had fought afljj conquered, but it seemed already as ” his attention were turning elsewhere. The crowd began to stream out Tb* day was hot and the crush had bee*1 very great.

Dell other again. There was antagonism in the atmosphere though it was not visible upon either man’s countenance, and each ignored it as it were instinctively. " Hullo ! ” said Wentworth, and offered his hand. "I’m pleased to meet you here” Field took the hand after a scarcely perceptible pause. His smile was openly cynical. “ Very kind of you,” he said. ” I am somewhat out of my element, I admit We are celebrating our engagement." He looked full at Wentworth as he said it with that direct, unflickerfng gaze of his. Wentworth did not meet the look quite so fully, but he faced the situation without a sign of discomfiture. " You are engaged to Lady Violet ? ” he said. ” I saw the announcement. I congratulate you." "Thanks," said Field. “ Rather sudden, isn’t it ?" said Wentworth, with a curious glance. Field's smile still lingered. " Oh, not really. We have kept it to ourselves, that's all. The wedding is fixed for the week after next—for the convenience of Lady Culverleigh, who wants to get out of town.” " By Jove ! It is quick work ! " said Wentworth. There were beads of perspiration on his forehead, but the night was warm. He held himself erect as one defying Fate. SO had he held himself through- out his trial; Field recognised the atti- tude. The song upstairs had ended. They heard the buzz of appreciation that suc- ceeded it. Field turned with the air of a man who had said his say. " I don’t believe in long engagements myself," he said. " They must be a weariness to the flesh.” He began to mount the stairs again, and Wentworth followed him in silence. 281 Hutchinson’s Story Magazine At the drawing-room door Field paused and they entered together. It was al- most Wentworth’s first appearance since his trial. There was a moment or two of dead silence as he sauntered forward with Field. Then, with a little laugh to cover an instant’s embarrassment. Lady Culverleigh came forward. She shook hands with Wentworth and asked where he had been in retreat. Violet came forward from the piano very pale but quite composed, and shook hands also. Several people pre- sent followed suit, and soon there was a little crowd gathered round him, and Burleigh Wentworth was again the popular centre of attraction. Percival Field kept in the background; it was not his way to assert himself in society. But he remained until Went- worth and the last guest had departed. And then very quietly but with indis- putable insistence he drew Lady Violet away into the conservatory. She was looking white and tired, but she held herself with a proud aloofness in his presence. While admitting his claim upon her, she yet did not volun- tarily yield him an inch. “ Did you wish to speak to me ? ” she asked.- He stood a moment or two in silence before replying ; then : “ Only to give you this,” he said, and held out to her a small packet wrapped in tissue paper on the palm of his hand. She took it unwillingly. “The badge of servitude ? ” she said. “ I should like to know if it fits,” said Field quietly, as if she had not spoken. She opened the packet and disclosed not the orthodox diamond ring she had expected, but a ring containing a single sapphire very deep in hue, exquisitely cut. She looked at him over it, her look a question. “ Will you put it on'? ” he said. She hesitated an instant, then with a tightening of the lips she slipped it on to her left hand. “ Is it too easy ? ” he said. She looked at him again. “No; it is not easy at all.” He took her hand and looked at it. His touch was cool and strong. He slipped the ring up and down upon her finger, testing it. It was as if he waited for something. She endured his action for a few seconds, then with a deliberate move- ment she took her hand away. “Thank you very much,” she said conventionally. " I wonder what made you think of a sapphire.” “ Yoti like sapphires ? ” he questioned. “ Of course,” she returned. Her tone was resolutely indifferent, yet some- thing in his look made her avert her eyes abruptly. She turned them upon the ring. “ Why did you choose a sapphire ? ” she said. If she expected some compliment in reply she was disappointed. He stood in silence. Half-startled she glanced at him. In the same moment he held out his hand to her with a formal gesture of leave- taking. " I will tell you another time/’ he said. " Good night ! ” She gave him her hand, but, he scarcely held it. The next instant, with a brief bow, he had turned and left her. See next month’s issue of “Hutchinson’s Story Magazine” for the completion of this great love romance by Ethel M. Dell. THE RETURN OF THE CONVICT By W. L. GEORGE Author of “A Tied of Roses ” ROBERT BARLOW stood outside the gaol. He was lonely, as the dis- coverer of a hew world first footing an alien shore. - Indeed, it was an undis- covered world, this old world long for- gotten. Through slow years it had mani- fested itself to him, but only as the second fiddle in an orchestra. Once, a little while after his imprisonment, he had heard a warder tell another that he was. going to vote Liberal this time. Thus Robert Barlow guessed that in the lost world an election was going on. Then, for years, there had been nothing except an extraor- dinary uniformity of daily life, meals that regulated time rather than were brought round by the clock, and a task without variation. A few rumours had come from the out- side, which spread hardly through word of mouth, but rather from spirit to spirit as in' an Eastern bazaar, by a whisper in the yard, some admission from the chaplain. The gaol heard some details of the Crippen •	case ; many thought that Stinie Morrison had been wrongly lagged ; of the war they were officially informed, and soon excite- ment spread through the prison when now and then a man disappeared before his time was up: it became known that he had volunteered, forsaken the buried world for a region of flame and death. And though a few chuckled behind their prison bars, told themselves they were well out of it, nearly all the young convicts volun- teered, Barlow among them. But he was just too old, and his offence too heavy to earn the right to hazard his life. Echoes of the war had floated in. And there had been the exquisite excitement of air raids, which terrified the convicts because they could not do what instinct bids men do : to take cover in any place other than the one in which they are. He remembered the daily hour of exer- cise, round and round in the yard, where Hutchinson’s Story Magazine the bricks in the walls had taken on in- dividuality. He thought: " There's a chip in the mortar of the ninth brick from the gate, seventh row from the bottom.” And already some sentimental memory of the past made him half regret that he would never see that brick again. It was gone. With the dead years. The ex-convict took two hurried steps forward, and wondered half-childishly at the lack of restraint. Here was nothing to stop his progress. And overhead the new blue sky, unlimited by walls. Sometimes in the light square of his window he had seen between the bars, for a moment, a bird hover. Now there rested on his head a sky devoid of boundaries, streaked with a flight of starlings. He thought: “ Why am I not happy ? ” and realised that within him some spirit, infinitely sagacious, did not believe that he was free, but whispered : “ It’s no good your trying to move again or running away. You aren’t out, not really. It's only like that time when they let you out for the day to give evidence when Jim killed the warder. They’ll have you in again in a minute. Black Maria's waiting just the other side of those trees.” A sideways glance told him that the warder at the gate was watch- ing him. He thought: ” Keeping an eye on me. Like a cat with a mouse.” Then he underwent some slight con- valescence. He remembered the hour-old scene, how he had come down to the office, stood at attention while they made out his discharge. He had seen his name in a big book, vaguely realised himself as somebody. Now they had closed the entry in the book. He had lost his uniform, his number, his place in the world. He was no longer Convict 1842, knowing what he was and what to do, but Robert Barlow, one of thousands of Barlows, tossed into a world not ready for him. He started. A man had touched him upon the arm, and the touch terrified him. Barlow's only thought was : " There you are ! Didn't I know ? They've got me again.” And the paralysis of his will was still such that he did not try to run away, to burst into that freedom which lay on the other side of the curtain of trees. Then !'9 realised that this man was not an offic,aj of the prison. He was very tall and lean. gentle blue eyes peered at him througjj spectacles.

Hanging about at the end of the road for her to slip out to him of evenings.” " Don't think about it any more.” " What else is there to think about ? ” asked Barlow, his handsome, clean-shaven mouth tightening. " Haven't I had her picture before my eyes, even when I kept them shut, for twenty years ? And she was a picture. She'd got blue eyes like that sky up there, but more shiny. And a dimple in each cheek : you could hide the tip of your finger in it when she laughed. And hair . . . oh, my God 1 ” His voice grew hoarse : “ Rolls and rolls of red gold . . . and one day when she let it down she trod on it and it tripped her up.” ” There, there,” said the missionary, patting his arm, ” don’t think of those twenty years. Think of the twenty years that are coming. You're forty-five, you say. Well, I'm sixty, and I’m not tired of life. There's lots more before you. Come with me.

No, I’m for the gay life. I wasn’t telling you the truth when I told you that for twenty years I thought of nothing but her. I thought ot lots of other things: having a damn good cigar. And drinking as much as I could hold. And putting a bit on a horse . . . though I’m afraid I’ll be had ; I haven't kept up my study of pedigrees. No more women except for fun. I can tell you that.

It was her mother did it. because I’d some money of my own. You may say I ought to have talked to her when I found out what was going on. and then I wouldn't have done it. I’d have been sorry for her, poor kid. having to marry the man she didn't want. She riled me, you know. She thought I was a muff; she called me a softy because I hated drowning kittens. And she said I had no determination, be- cause once I wanted to go to the seaside when she wanted to go to the country, and I gave in.” He laughed. " But I showed her. I showed her if I’d no determination. I was game enough to lay him out. And she knew it, too ! I can remember her eyes at the trial and how they stared at me ... as if blue lights had been hung in them. Ah ! she did hate me.” The missionary did not know what to say, when a figure detached itself from the curtain of trees and came towards them. It was a woman, and as she reached the two men she hesitated, staring at Barlow with a puzzled expression in her eyes. She was very slight and pale, and her brown coat and skirt were worn and ugly. Her eyelids looked very red round pale blue eyes in her white face. Her hands, gloved in black kid, clasped the handle of her sun- shade, a ridiculous ivory bird with green glass eyes. She stood, shifting a little from foot to foot, as if uncertain what to do. She was deprecating, as a dog that humbly seeks to make apology and goes, its tail ingratiatingly awag, to a certain beating and an uncertain forgiveness. Suddenly she set her teeth ; one could see her jaw square. She came close, laid on! y her finger- tips on Barlow's sleeve. The missionary turned and faced her. ” What do you want ? ” he asked. He was full of instinctive suspicion. Thus con- fronted with a creaturc born again into a world that did not welcome him. he felt paternal, tutelar ; it was as if he became responsible for this man whom he received, dulled rather than broken, infirm of will and bereft of desire. So he stared at tfie woman, who bad cast down her eyes She surprised him. for he was familiar enough with sordid adventuresses that await men for years nurtured in abstinence. and capable, on the recovery of freedom of ungovernable folly. She was neither young nor attractive, nor clad so as 10 please ; nor was there in her manner a®?* thing jaunty. No lure this, sent to **** ex-convict as the ambassador of a treacb** ous world. So he hesitated. He was pelled to cry out to her: " Go away. *** him alone. The man is mine. He m ,, be saved, yer. but he must be saved by So he said : " What have you to do with man ?

Still his wife, was something to him that no other whether young, or rich, or charming. be to him.

And so they passed the Governor's house and disappeared towards jhe town, which a train was just entering. v*ng grey cumuli of smoke in the radiant air. They did not speak in the train. Instinct the woman that her husband must fecapture life slowly, that he must re- 'Qcornpass it. Nor did he challenge her. ""kile her eyes rested steadfast upon him, anxious, half devoted, he looked out the country that unrolled, broad ^rtmoor, purple-spangled with heather, ^d silver-split with rivulets of white water, the hills rose and fell on the skyline, upon the light wind the birch leaves >uddered, Robert Barlow was incredulous amazed rather than glad.

The Nottingham lace curtains were belted with green satin. He didn’t like that. He remembered other curtains . . . what were they like ? . . . oh, yes, one of those art fabrics with messy designs that came out before the Boer War. All very long ago. A reminiscent pang over- came him. but the content of his body was too great as he nestled in the padded arm- chair. It felt queer after the wooden stool. Nice, though. And that old etching in the corner, " Harvest Home,” that was jolly good. Suddenly he looked at his wife, still clasping in her gloved hands the sunshade with the absurd bird’s head and the green glass eyes. Maisie 1 No doubt about it. He picked out one after the other her features, so altered, so familiar. Funny, he’d never realised she’d got that dry. pinkish skin. And her nose ... it had been such a short, impertinent little nose ; it didn't become it to have thinned. Then, as if with an effort, she looked at him and he grew more conscious of her tragedy, for he found in the blue eyes not a vestige of the old glow, nor in the hair, of which untidy strands cscaped from under the gaily-flowered hat. the old blaze, the old sheen of molten gold. For a moment they stared at each other as if gripped in a conflict of wills. He felt neither hate nor attraction, only surprise. She must have understood him, for she bit her lip, and, taking a step forward, whispered : '* Bob . . . don't Jook at me like that. Haven't you . . . can’t you ? . . Irrelevantly he replied : “It all seems so strange." Then, after a pause : *’ I never thought I’d see you again. Maisie." His voice was so cold that she stiffened with anger. " Perhaps you didn't want to. Perhaps you’re sorry I came to fetch you.” '* Oh. no." he &aid, after a moment ** I don’t mind." Her features twitched as tf she were •about to cry, and instinctively her hands went to her hair, patting it into order 207 Hutchinson’s Story Magazine Her femininity arrayed itself, and she thought: " What a fool I was not to wear my blue ! Only it’s so out of shape. Past ironing.” With a desperate air she came closer, leaning over him, her hands upon the table, and she stared at him, filled with intense desire to force into his eyes that ardent, tender gaze she had not seen for twenty years. As he remained passive, looking at her with unconcern, she realised at last things that the mirror had murmured in vain, because it had told its story so slowly, day by day. For a moment she did not see the man upon whom her eyes were fixed. She saw herself as she had been, white and round, heavy-crowned in radiant locks, and laughing. She remembered : he used to bury the tip of his little finger in the dimples which formed no more in the thinned cheeks. It was horrible. She thought: " I’m forty-two. I suppose I look forty- two. Oh, it's no use pretending ! " But she hated him then, hated him as she had not done when he roused her disdain, hated him more than when he slew her lover, be- cause then he had outraged only outside things, whereas now he placed upon her the culminating insult of resisting her attrac- tions. But at once her fury collapsed, and her hands fell helpless. What was to be done ? Nothing. So she said : " Let me get you something to eat." She left the room, but she did not at once go into the kitchen. She ran upstairs, hurriedly took off her brown coat and skirt, and, after a moment's hesitation, put on her blue skirt and a white blouse. She ordered her hair. It lay easily now and without spring, this hair which had once been so unruly. Then, after a long pause, she dabbed her face over with the powder- puff. She thought: " He used to hate face powder, but he’s so different now. Perhaps he's different even in that." Then, after a while, upon a tray she carried in a meal which she set out oo the ready white tablecloth. He watched her carelessly, as if separate from the scene. At last she said : " Come along, you must have something to eat." Obediently he came to the table- He liked the soup, thin vegetable soup; easV to get down. But when his wife cut a large slab of game pie, a delicious feeling of excitement arose in him. The exquislta scent of it rose like a prayer into W* II nostrils, and. greedily cutting off a , piece, he crammed it into his mouth. ^JF a moment he chewed it. But the disturbed him.

She shrank from telling him that once before she had seen his features so set. and that an hour later he had killed her lover. " What do you mean ? " said Barlow, speaking to the wall.	. “ Oh. you frighten me so. You look at me as if you thought you'd squash me like a beetle, just to get me out of the way.” She loosed her clasp. “ I'm frightened of you. I thought it'd be all right, but . . .” " Oh," 6aid Barlow, " I see what you mean. You're afraid I'll murder you. You needn’t be nervous. If I was to do that I'd have done it twenty years ago.” " But then,” she cried, “ if you feel like that, if you don't think wrr , of me, why have you treated me like this all these years ? " " I don't know what you mean.” ** My letters. You never answered my letters. Oh, don't say you couldn't,” she went on, her injury suddenly raising her anger. " You could write a letter a month. And I wrote you month after month. And you never answered.” “ You didn't stick it out to the end,” said Barlow, bitterly. " Well, what do you expect ? I wrote to you every month for five years and you never answered. What was the good ? " " What would you have done if I'd swung in a month instead of being re- prieved and getting out in twenty years ?

She's not what And be did not reproach himself r«*hsing that if after tlwsc tweuty years. by some miracle, there had come to meet him the Maisie he had last seen in the Old Bailey, such as she was, gold, lily, and rose . . . such a Maisie, even hostile, even guilty, he would have knelt to. while now he could only repel the new Maisie, even innocent, even loving. As he went along the road the suburb grew sparser. The rows of houses gave place to terraces of semi-detached villas, then to large houses in their own grounds. At last he met the wall of a country park, and for some time followed the Exe that flowed sleepy and shallow. The thunder had come closer as he went, and now a . sharp clap startled him. He slopped and felt with gratefulness the first drops of rain upon his head. It was exqaisite, and as the rain cc. s faster, in heavy drops that clattered separately upon the trees, making a sound like small beasts running, he felt cooler and more assured. Faster and heavier came the rain, and still he stood. Water was flowing down his face from his soaked hair, making his clothes sodden. He stood among the Wagnftriao sounds of the storm, re- verberating artillery of the heavens, sharp musketry and flame of the thunderbolts. A great pall of rain had swung across the hills, and the waters of the Exe were stippled with millions of holes as the spears of r^in pierced the grey glass of its waters. It lasted for a very long time, and so deafened, so blinded was he by the fury of the storm that he lost consciousness of time, and so stood, thrown by the rage of the elements into a state half comatcse, where he saw himself as lie had been, hold- ing close the Maisie that had died with the years. Some hours must have elapsed, for so entranced was he by his dream, so remote did he grow from the surrounding world in which he had found no heritage, that he realised with surprise that the storm was long done, that the sun of late afternoon was drying the road, and sinking swiftly into the western sky. He moved painfully in his clothes, which dung, heavy and wet, to his body. He thought: " I'm dripping," and this brought him back to the actual wucld. He thought: ** What's to be dnoe ? I 291 Hutchinson’s Story Magazine can’t stay here. I must do something." Instinctively he felt in his pocket for the few wet Treasury notes and coins which had been given him as fruit of his labour for twenty years. “ It isn't much, "he thought. I don’t suppose I can live on it more than a week or two. I suppose I must find some work." But an immense disgust of work, of association with his fellows in a workshop akin to the prison, oame over him. He did not want to chain himself np again. He wanted nothing prccise. Only to be alone and at rest. But mankind, he realised, would not lot him alone. It couldn't; there were too many of them- Coming along the road he saw a couple, arms locked about waists, walking slowly aud coming down towards the Exe. He stared at them calmly, rather than enviously. A workman and some girl out of a shop in Exeter, no doubt . . . holding hands and talking nonsense. They didn't know what they were in for and what life could do to them, very likely. But as t iey drew closer Barlow shrank away: he thought no more of them, but only of him- self. Those two, those kids, they didn't know. They didn't know who he was. He wondered what they'd say if he went up to them and said : "I've come out of Dartmoor this morning after twenty years. I killed a man.” He smiled as he thought of their frightened faces. But perhaps they wouldn't be frightened. Perhaps they’d just draw away because he was a convict, a disgraced man. He thought: " I'll run," but just then the couple climbed over a stile and disappeared across a field. Now he knew that the eyes of his fellow- men must frighten him, because they must judge him. Once a convict, always a convict. They could never think of him as one of them selves. He roust be horrible to them ... or wonderful. Maisi* thought him wonderful. “ I oan't bear it." he said aloud. “ I'll go abroad.” But he remembered how little money was in his pocket, and also that abroad he would be faced always by the curious eyes of men, meu who might find out what he was. For a moment he loo at the river. " I suppose one could drown oneself i» that if one got to the middle." Then, from down the road, ho saw ri above a ridge the helmets and torsces two county constables. He gazed hy tised at the silver glitter of those helmet*- They came along, talking, good-humo smoking pipes, and Barlow stiffened to s his manhood by waiting until they p him. But he couldn't do it.

It ,#,e to please you. Hutchinson’s Story Magazine morrow would be the second anniversary of the day during which, after a quarrel over something that he had completely forgotten, he had agreed with Rowena to give separation a trial. He and she were, in the pithy language of the lady with the far-reaching voice, " wealthy gutter-snipes." They had “ haunted the city, dissipating youth and freshness in the foul atmosphere of night clubs and dancing places in com- pany with people as careless and as futile as themselves.” His education had been washed, and he had " deliberately gone back on the traditions and good form of his ex- cellent family, and it was a good thing that his father and mother had not lived to undergo the pain and disappointment of seeing their only son go completely to the dogs.” These were strong words to apply to the youthful process that is universally kno%vn as sowing wild oats, he thought—the dra- matic exaggeration of a woman with a dangerous "gift of the gab.” And, as such, he endeavoured to dismiss them from his mind. He laughed at the term "wealthy gutter-snipe,” but in order to take the state of it out of his mind threw his eyes with a sense of keen refreshment over the beau- tiful gardens of his sister’s Southampton cottage, made magic by the moonlight. He was glad, he found, to be out of town, glad, he had to confess, to take a rest from the rather petnlant demands of Violet Orme and the all-night frivolous set in which she moved and had her being. It was good to breathe that clean, sweet air. and stand alone beneath the infinite meadows of Heaven in which all the forget-me-nots of the angels were in full blossom. It was good, by way of a change, to smell the sccnt of honeysuckle and syringa, and to hear the sound, coming through the dusky glimmer of the night, not of the msh of city traffic, but the chorus of Long Island frogs. He went along the Italian terrace. whose nymphs seemed to have paused in mid- motion to watch their shadows on the squares of stone, to the quiet pool, in which lay. as in a looking-glass, the reflection of the sky. The beauty, dignity, and sim- plicity of the place which, ordinarily, would have earned a mere brief recognition, stirred and touched him as he stood there that night. He was surprised at this, being the mood of a man who has been forced to stand outside himself and see what he looked like. He ought to have been bored and restless, and to have felt the irresistible call of the crowd and the bright lights and the lure of ragtime. He ought to have been a little sore at the impertinence o that talkative woman, and to have rankle® under the truth of her scathing indictment- The truth is always harsh. As it was. knew that this pause in his perpetual joy- ride was welcome, although he was aston- ished that it should be; and, being fund* mentally straight, he told himseli that the ugly words that he had been obliged overhear painted a pretty accurate picturC of his mode of life and point of view. And, as he stood out there in the m0°®* light alone and introspective, the men»on of boy's dreams came back to him l»l*e , almost forgotten song.

It appears that they had a breakdown a little way from here on their way to Easthampton, and decided not to worry about going on. As they want something to eat. I must go and look after them. It’s awfully sweet of you to take it like this, Chris.” And away she went, excited but disturbed. Take it like that ? How else was he to take it ? What right had he to say a word as to how Rowena ran her life ? It was true that she bore his name, but that was not much for her to be proud of. For the rest, she had refused to accept any share of his income, and had lived on her own money. But for the act of marriage, which counted for so little with these ultra- moderns, they had become mere acquaint- ances. Their only mutual interest was that they both played the fool. Whatever he did, to rescue the remainder of his own youth from dissipation, would have to be done alone. The girl whom lie had married, in a good and even beautiful spell of adolescent romance, was running in single harness, perfectly happy and care- less. One thing, however, he would cer- tainly achieve for the sake of old times. He would put the man who ought to have married Violet Qrme out of the running. He would make use of this opportunity to rid Mrs. Christopher Belmore of Merrill Shannon, cad and lady-killer, and then start out to sec what he could make of him- self. Everything that was decent in him, every shred of gratitude and love for the memory of his father and mother, urged him to prove the last part of Mre. Maple- ton’s summary untrue and undeserved, “ So help me. God," he said to the stars. That decided, he turned and marched back to the house. The French windows of the drawing-room were open. His brother-in-law was playing bridge at one table and his sister at another. Mrs Map]*ton and her confidante were sitting on a settee with their heads together. The white-haired lady with the black eyebrows and th* scintillating sequins had received 295 Hutchinson’s Story Magazine further fuel for her conversational powers by the sudden and unconventional arrival of two of the most famous members of the younger smart set. That was obvious. Two figures were standing together on the verandah with the moonlight upon them—one, slight and blond and as grace- ful as a narcissus; the other, tall and square-shouldered and dark. "Hello Rowcna ! " said Chris. “ Oh, heDo. Chris. What fun meeting you here.” The voice was as light as the petal of a rose. " Yes, I'm awfully glad. I shied at coming, but I see now why I came.” He bent over her perfectly cordial hand. “ But we had no intention of stopping here. We were on the way to Emory's at Eastliampton." “ Perhaps there was something occult about it,” he said, laughing. With even more of the consummate ease and equability that Chris remembered so well, this slip of a girl, this finished product of super-civilisation, this child who had been born to sophistication, half turned her fair head towards the man at her side. ” You know Merrill Shannon," she said. " No.” said Chris. " I low do you do ? " Murmuring an appropriate answer. Shannon conveyed, plainly enough, a de- sire to be left undisturbed as soon as pos- sible with some one to whom he had the exclusive right. And as Chris got it his back stiffened and his determination became as hard as rock. It was not his job to interfere with Rowena's choice of friends, but this one. this un- scrupulous bounder, should find himself very properly unhitched before a new day broke, if he knew anything about it. It was written on the new leaf that be had just turned over. He sat on the step at Rowena's feet with a cold shoulder towards her companion. " How do you go ? " he asked. '* No grumbles." she replied, with a little laugh. " I caught sight of you one day last week. Pretty, isn’t she ? " Yes, and very charming *’ " We’re talking about Mrs. Orme." Rowena, with one of her cliaracteristic touches of audacity. " Yes.” Shannon attempted to appear ' uninterested, but his eyes flicked a little at the mention of Violet's name. Chris deliberately ignored his existence-- j " Have you been to the house lately ? asked Rowena. casually. " I slept there about three weeks ago. but the camphor- balls chased me round to the club." " How’s that queer old housekeeper Mrs. Pipkin ? ” Chris laughed. ” She wept over She considers that we're both quite beyoo* redemption.” ” Does she ? Funny old thing. I should have thought she’d forgotten me by th»B time.” There was a pause, but not a silence. 1*1 the water nearby the frogs continued theiC ( rasping chorus, and from away in the dt9* 1 tance came the steady boom of the sea. Chris leaned forward. *’ May I be p**” sonal for a moment ? " lie asked. " I wondered how long you were goio8 1 to be before you said something nice aboU* my frock." She waited, with a flash 0*1 smile. " It's corking, but I was thinking w your face.” “ Ob, it's the same young face." “ Only prettier.”	. J " Dear me.” she said, " quite your form, Chris.

At tl»e door paused and turned her Konmcy-lik* over her shoulder. *' Would it bow 5 to come and watch us eat.

He dismissed at once the obvious idea of getting up a fracas with Shannon and ordering him off the place. It was not his place, and Shannon would have the right to say that Rowena could choose her friends. He dismissed also the equally obvious plan of going to Rowena and asking her to take up her life with him again. She would inevitably demand to know why she should be bracketed with Violet Orme. The maze in which all four of them had placed them- selves, easy as it had been to get into, was difficult to get out of. He believed that Rowena had done nothing more than amuse herself with Shannon. He clung to his boyish faith in her. How was he to prove that his relations with Violet Orme were only those of a man who had desired a companion in lunacy ? That was the point. Walking up and down, with his hands deep into .his pockets, he got as far as this and no farther. The way was blocked by the barrier of his own temperament and those of the other three. He feared the ridicule that he would ask for if he went frankly up to Rowena and Shannon and told them that he wanted to turn over a new leaf. His sense of civilisation rose up against a row with Shannon, and whem it came to Violet Orme he had to conicss tliat he had done much to add to the scandal which Shannon had attached to her name. She had to be considered too. Wild oats grew quickly and clung like burrs. Suddenly he remembered that Violet was a member of a week-end party at a house within a thousand yards of his sister's, and that he had promised to meet her at ten o'clock on tho hill that divided them, and then, at that instant, inspiration put a light into his befogged brain. Let them all four come together out under the stars, catch the beauty and sanity of the night, and, with the magic of the moon upon Uu-m. stumble into honesty ! Out he went, quivering with a strange excitement, believing, however mistakenly, that they were all three, like himself, in need only of a little help to emerge from 297 Hutchinson’s Story Magazine the high crop that entangled them. *' Give human nature a chance," he seemed to hear in his brain. “ It is fundamentally decent love, hope, fear, faith—these make humanity, and in every heart the Christ is born." He found Rowena lying back in a deck- chair, gazing at a star. He stepped quietly and caught her face in repose. He had been right. It was tired and wistful. Shannon was leaning against a pillar with his eyes on the ground. His cigarette in a bughokler had gone out. He seemed to be miles away. A clock in the house struck ten. Young Belmore knew that he must go warily. Shannon had not spoken to Violet since the divorce—no one knew why—and Rowena had not chosen to meet her. Vitriolic was the only word to use in at- tempting to describe Violet's language whenever she mentioned Shannon—which was not often. So that art was needed in the process of achieving this meeting, which might not last any longer than « flash of lightning. " A wonderful night," he said. “ I suppose it is," said Shannon. Rowena looked from one man to the other, and her eyes rested on Chris. What was it about him to-night that made her feel just a touch of pain in her heart ? Chris Btood over Rowena. " Como up on the hill and have a look at the sea.” he said. She took his hand and allowed herself to be drawn to her feet. “ Must I ? " she asked. But she wanted to go all the same His voice and the way he looked at her took her back two whole years, to that night on the yacht when he had proposed. What had they quarrelled about ? She couldn't remember. It was her fault, probably. She had been idiotically young then. She felt old to-night. Chris turned to Shannon. " Care to comc ? " he asked, casunlly. There was a brief hesitation. Shannon had no use for the sea. ihen he nodded and re-lit his cigarettc and fell in step. This man had been Rowena's husband, but that was no reason for his marching her off. They went slowly through the garden in silence. All the flowers were asleep Fireflies flashed their little lights and the moon silvered everything. “ Fairies are out to-night," said Rowena presently, putting her hand on Shannons arm. He glanced sharply at her. Her expres* sion was that of a tired child. He never seen it on her face before. He looked about.

" It needs a night like this, witlj moonlight and stars, and it can't be played unless, as Rowena said, the fairies are out." No one helped him or caught his eyes that glanced with eagerness from face to face. So he started again, with a courage that he didn't believe that he possessed. " It's called breaking down the fourth wall," he said. " It's—it's about the hardest game ever invented. It's gener- ally played by two people, but it doesn't spoil it to have four.

David Stroud sat back in his chair and stared out of the window, with all the sheets of manuscript scattered on the table in front of him.

Me stared from the window to the fireplace; he bit his nails (a very bad habit); he lighted a cigarette and walked up and down the room. It was a meagrely furnished room, with a bedroom adjoining, the two com- prising his lodgings in an obscure house in West Kensington. David was young—barely twenty-three —and lie had come to London from the cathedral town of Norwich, with the uiuai determination to set the big city by the ears. His father had been an organist and music-teacher, and on his death had left a small sum of money to be divided between David and his sister Hilda.

His choicc was influ- yrtu enced largely by the fact that the^lane was steeper than the road, and he wanted to do what he didn’t feel inclined to. He urged himself forward. The air was be- coming very fresh and sweet and the birds were singing gaily. He began to think about his book, but nothing happened; the same old ideas still jumbled against each other. He crossed a stretch of com- mon and caught a glimpse of blue distances ; he was certainly up in the Surrey hills. An old man passed and touched his hat. David jerked out: " Oh. how do you do ? ” in the tight voice of a man who has been too long con- fined to city life. He passed a farm where a team of large sleek horses were just returning to the fields in cliarge of an old carter and a boy. David sighed, and rested once more against tlie farm-gate. He was in bad condition. And yet there was something a little sooth- ing in all this. He went on. Suddenly the lane forked again. This time he took the lower turn- ing, because it seemed the more deserted, better attuned to his melancholy mood. He had not progressed more than four hundred yards when he came to the dingle. It nestled in the hollow of a disused chalk-pit. It was wild and overgrown with shrubs, gorse. and delicate birch trees. He instinctively plunged into it. The soil was sandy; fresh young green leaves tickled his face and hair, brambles caught at his trousers. He came to the carcase of an old fallen tree partially covered with moss and lichen. He chose a part of the stem where the bark had peeled away, and sat down. It was extraordinarily quiet and remote. He had never felt so cut oft from the world Bees droned around him in the gorse. the little sound* of birds and living thing* un- familiar to him soothed his senses. The sun, streaming through the leaves, made bewildering patterns. Martins swung in semicircles at the top of the pit. It was . . . somehow, cosy. He sat with his elbows dug into his knees and his hands holding his head, and examined the activities of some red ants darting in and out from Iwncath the bark ol the tree he 303 Hutchinson’s Story Magazine sat on. He had an uncomfortable feeling that the ants would get on to his trousers or his coat, and crawl all over him. He edged farther away, and looked around him again. He felt like a small boy scent- ing adventure, but slightly nervous of the unknown. In this arabesque of sunlight and foliage it was difficult to detach things. It was the kind of place that a small boy could 'imagine the eyes of a tiger, or a rattlesnake, or even—a Red Indian 1 He would like to be a small boy again, playing at Red Indians with his sister Hilda in the garden at Norwich. His mother's slim figure in the doorway. . . . " Why should the father-confessor him- self not be the lover, his secret hidden be- hind his dark cowl ? Why should he not tell the story ? " Strange ! but as David sat there blink- ing in the sunlight he could almost swear that a voice whispered this into his ear! What did it mean ? The father-confessor ? Why. yes, of course there was a father- confessor in the story. ... It had not occurred to him. He was not thinking of his book, but suddenly he began to think very rapidly. The whole thing unfolded itself before his mind's eye. On those lines the story would be much more man- ageable. The various themes began to co- ordinate. His pulses were throbbing at an unaccustomed rate. He could see it all. The main idea became simple and dignified, inevitable. Everything took its place. His fingers itched to set it down ; but he had not even a notc-book. He sat there till the sun began to set. and jio one disturbed him, He glowed with a quiet contentment, feeling himself tho medium of expression of forces greater than himself. Then, when the light began to fade, he rose up and shook himself. " Queer," he thought, " that it should have come like that 1 Of course it was nonsense my fancying I beard the voice. I’m ridiculously run down; I must do this more often." He walked quickly down the hill, hum- ming to himself. When he arrived borne he snatched a hasty meal, and then he sat down to write. He wrote all night. He slept till the afternoon, and awoke still tingling with the sense of new-found power. Thoughts came easily, and had only to be set down.

But it was not pub- lished for six months. In the meantime he was at work on other things: a play, some poems and essays, and another novel. It was not till late in the autumn that he became convinced that—for him in any case—there was a genie of the dingle I For he tried the experiment again and again, and it never appeared to fail. Di- rectly his creative power became stagnant he took the train to Moblesham and sought his dingle. Sometimes the-little whispers of the leaves were slower in their delivery of the revelation than at other times, but they never utterly disappointed him. On occasions the illumination would not come till he was returning from the dingle, or even till he went to bed that night. One day he tried the experiment of writ- ing in the dingle. He took a writing-pad and fountain-pen. but the result was not successful. Ideas came, but not the facility to set them d6wn. He was dis- tracted by the sunlight and the movement. It did not appear to be within the cove- nant of the high gods who presided over this enchanted spot. It was essentially a place for inspiration, for adjustment, but not for the deliberate prosecution of a routine. In the winter, when the book was pub- lished, it happened to catch the eye of a luminary in a little office off the Strand, who foresaw the glories of a personal scoop in " discovering " a young and unknown writer. He let hhnself go in a weekly journal devoted to such things, and be- came maudlin over it in a large club in St. James's. It had no great sale, but it at- tained a succis d'estxme. Other works were published and commented upon. Even in the winter he visited the dingle. When the trees were bare and there were great squidgy pools of water, he would still go and plunge about, humming to himself, laughing gaity, feeling virile and joyous. And the little voice was always eloquent. He began to know every mound and tree and shrub in the dingle, and he watched their growth and colour and peculiarity. David was not a mystic. He tried to explain the whole thing to himself. 305 Hutchinson’s Story Magazine " There’9 just something about thi9 place that's sympathetic. The walk is good for me. By the time I get here I am feeling well. They are not really voices I hear. Only I like it; it's very beautiful, extraordinarily quiet and remote, and then the—combination-of things stimulates me. That’s all to it. But it’s very queer." It was two years later that David met the genie face to face. He was becoming a successful man, already recognised as being more than “ promising.” " This young author is going to count,” an- nounced the Delphic oracle of the literary world. He had moved to more commo- dious rooms and had even bought an up- right piano, on which he groped his way to vague satisfactions. One day late in June he was sitting in the dingle, musing upon the strange in- fluence it had exercised upon his fate. The dingle was in its wild, patterned mood, the sunlight dancing through the leaves. He was staring idly at the quivering ap- pearance of a stunted almond tree, and thinking how difficult it was in this effect to separata one tone from another, when suddenly he became uncomfortably aware that eyes were watching him through the pattern. He stood up, and instantly a branch quivered vertically and the genie sprang lightly to the ground near his feet. She had bright. Puck-like eyes, and an oval, elfish face framed in a mass of dark brown hair, a dark green fustian kind of tunic and brown-stockinged legs. She said : " Oh, I say ! I’m awfully sorry ! ” David stared at her foolishly, and re- echoed : " I'm awfully sorry I ” It was obvious that each felt that they were prying into the privacy of the other’s life. " I didn’t see you till just now," re- marked the genie. " Oh ! I was only just sitting there," answered David limply. " It’s very jolly here.” said the genie. " Do you live here ? " murmured the rnystified young man, Then the surprising visitor from the spirit-world laughed and shook her shining hair, and in the process displayed a line of small and perfect teeth. " I do, pretty nearly," she answered. " I live down the road at that red house. It's called ‘ Clonbeggan ’ for some reason or oth^r. I haven't any brothers or sisteis* and I come here nearly every day. ^ father’s a doctor, and he’s always busy - and my mother's in London.” She sat on her haunches on the sand, with her legs crossed, facing him.

A dog-cart was waiting to take him on his rounds. He rose at the end of ten minutes and pressed David’s hand, and murmured : " Very delighted . . . any time,” and he waved his hand vaguely towards the fireplace. David heard afterwards from the vil- lagers that Dr. Parsons' wife was a very beautiful Roumanian lady'. But thero had been some great trouble. They no longer lived together. She was in London or Paris, and she never visited her husband or child. And in time David went beyond the dingle. He went for walks with Stella, and sat in her garden under the walnut tree, and told her of his ambitions, and his life, and his sister, and his work, and the people he met in the social life which was gradu- ally enveloping him. For three years this strange friendship grew and quickened, and David was then referred to as " this brilliant young author, ” and his sister Hilda, in her placid home at Norwich, blushed with pride, and wealthy people sought him out. and publishers began to jostle each other for his wares. And David was dazzled. He was accom- plishing what he had set out to accomplish, and all within the space of five years. He began to adore flattery, and adulation was food and wine to him. There was only one disconcerting ele- ment in this joyous scheme. He encount- ered it on the lawn of Dr. Parsons’ house It came in the person of Ephraim Barnes Ephraim Barnes was a young, keen-facerl man of Semitic origin. He was a successful builder and contractor, who drove, about the country in his own car. Being cured of a bad attack of sciatica by Dr. Parsons, he had visited him, and there, of course, met Stella. Stella showed him no special attention, bnt Ephraim was persistent, keen, and thorough. And suddenly David realised that he was jealous. Finding him there on three successive occasions, he took his dingle-maiden to task. ” Stella, are you fond ol this man f ” " No. David.” ** Not a bit ? " ” Not a scrap. He tywc** me.** " You would never marry him Stella ? ” 307 Hutchinson’s Story Magazine Stella peeped at him coyly, and remarked: " Oh, dear! oh, dear! how foolishly you talk I " On his way home David suddenly thought: " Good God ! I’m in love with that girl 1” And he began to reason with tiimself. To be a “ brilliant young author ” and to have arrived are two very different things. David was by no means well off. He lived above his income. He found fashionable house-parties far more expensive than expensive hotels. He ached to buy antique furniture, pictures, to have a beautiful house ; and he could see no prospect of attaining anything so fantastic. His palate for success had been whetted, but the banquet had not begun. What was he to do ? He had seen the distressing re- sults of some of his friends marrying when they were not in a position to. They went down the sink: they prostituted their art in the sordid struggle; they became hemmed in by babies, domestic troubles, and insistent material demands. They soon ceascd to count. And yet—Stella ! Her eyes followed him through the dim shadows of the night. She was an obses- sion, an angel, a nymph, his genie of the dingle. He hesitated, and did nothing. He visited her home and the dingle, and he drew inspiration from both. He fumed with jealousy at the sight of the unspeak- able Ephraim. But the summer passed, and the winter, and the position remained the same. And in the following spring he met Laura van Steyn, He met her at a house-party at the Frankinstein-Possets, the Bond Street picture-dealera. She was tall, fair, rather distinguishod-looking. very emo- tional, and gorgeously apparelled. She was a widow, three years older than David, and enormously wealthy. Her husband had been an American canned-fruit mag- nate. There was nothing of the canned fruit about Laura. She was passionately devoted to art and artists; she devoted her life to helping and Hattering young painters, and musicians, and writer*. She did not spare herself with regard to David. She took liim aside under a pergola dark- ened by clusters of blood-red rosea, and told him, more by the heaving of her bosom and her breathless intonation than by what she said, that he stood on the threshold of being what George Meredith, Thomas Hardy, and others had tried to be. And David drank it in. and realised that her* was a divinity. Little diamonds sparkled at her throat, a gold bag hung by a won- drous antique chain nestled between the < folds of silk upon her lap. Her skin was incredibly fair, and there was a watchful beauty about her eyes, as though she we1® the high-priestess guarding the 9acerdot»l offerings of all that was more priceless and forbidden in human life. David walked with her, and as he had nothing else to flatter, he flattered her beauty and her intelligence. Bsfore tn® house-party broke up she invited him visit her in town. Alas ! poor Stella. Followed then a year of doubt, contri- tion, and dazzling dreams.	1 On the eve of the day when he marr»«d Laura, she said : “ My darling, you shall be the greatrf* writer in the world.

For some days David enjoyed the garden, and he sat at the open window of his study, biting the end of his pen. And then the mood of remorse and dissatisfac- tion again assailed him. He wandered aimlessly about the country, and spoke bitterly. Laura sought other company, and had no difficulty in finding it along this gay and alluring coast. She left him to his own devices. One night at dinner he made another reference to the dingle, and she turned on him and said bitingly*. “ Oh. that dingle I Why do you always talk of that dingle ? ” And David pushed his plate away and walked out of the room and out of the villa. He walked bareheaded up into the hills. His heart overflowed with angry and disturbed feelings. He strode along quickly, and his breath came in little stabs between his nostrils. At length he returned and went straight into the salon, where Laura was arranging masses of blue delphinium in a tall vase. Without any preliminary explanation lie bore down on her. " I'll tell you why." he almost shouted. “ In every man’s life there is a dingle. Do you understand what I mean ? A dingle, a dingle, a dingle I Some place that is just his and no other's. It's the environment he must have, or he's no good. You can’t explain it; he can’t explain it. It’s what his soul demands, and nothing else will serve. It may be a room in a slum, a side-chapel in a cathe- dral, a clearing in a forest, a set of con- ditions, the touch of a friend's hands— almost anything it may be. but it must be jnst that. Nothing else is any good to him.

She said quite calmly: “ You fool I " 309 Hutchinson’s Story Magazine Five days later David Stroud arrived in London. He stayed the night at his old rooms in West Kensington. His (ace was drawn and thin, and dark rings encircled his eyes, but there was a buoyancy and hope about his bearing. In the morning he awoke refreshed. He caught an early train to Moble3ham-by- the-Mill. It was April, and little clusters of primroses peeped at him from the hedges. His heart was beating rapidly. Stella ! Would she be in the dingle ? Was she still there ? Did she think of him ? Would she understand ? Could he ever get back to the old position ? At the turning where the lane forked he was disturbed to find a large red-brick house. He muttered curses on the ac- tivities of speculating builders, and plunged down the lane. He had not advanced two hundred yards when he suddenly stopped. He felt he was going to swoon. He staggered to a gate and supported him- self. Beads of perspiration streamed down his face. " It’s finished,” he said hoarsely. ” Everything is finished I ” An iron gallery crossed the road. Great chimneys and cranes stood out against the sky. A wooden fence shut off what once had been the dingle. Above the top of it he could see a wilderness of corrugated iron and white chalk, smoke and corrup- tion. A steam-navvy was puffing noisily, figures were coming and going, whilst standing out insolently at an angle to the road was a large slate-coloured board, on which was painted. " Ephraim Barnes & Co., Lime and Cement Merchants.” David clung to the gate. He had diffi- culty in getting his breath. An old woman who came hobbling down the lane stopped and said : " Are you sick, mister ? Is anything awry ? " He shook himself nervously and jerked out: •• No, no, thank you, it's all rigat." *' It's muggy for the time of year," 1<y marked the old lady. David was struggling to keep himself hand. He controlled his voice as be re- plied : ” Yes. Can you (Bll me, madam. lives at the red-brick house at t^e corner ? " She turned her old face in the direction he was looking, and answered : “ Ay, Mr. Barnes 'isself and ‘is family lives there.” “ Oh !

Her eyes fell on the table, and she ail- vanced into the room wiping her hands on her apron. " Did you ever sec such a bunch of letters ? " she said. " Forty-five," returned her husband grimly, " and more t© come.” He picked up the newspaper lying beside the chair and opened it out. " Them's the ro6ult of that," he con- tinued cryptically, indicating a paragraph with a sqnare Unger, and thrusting the paper under his wife's nose. " Demobilised officer." she read slowly, " finding peace incredibly tedious, would welcome diversion. Legitimate, if pos- sible ; but crimc, if of a comparatively humorous description, ao objection.

Reply at once Box Xio." She put down the paper on a chair and stared first at her husband and then at the rows of letters neatly arranged on the table. " I calls it wicked,” she announced at length. " Fair flying in the face of Provi- dence. Crime, Denny—crime. Don't you get 'aving nothing to do with such mad pranks, my man, or you and me will be haviug words/’ She shook an admonitory finger at him, and retired slowly to the kitchen. In the days of his youth James Denny had been a bit wild, and there was a look in his eyes this morning—the sus- picion of a glint—which recalled old memories. A moment or two later Hugh Drummond came in. Slightly under six feet in height, he was broad in proportion. His best friend would not have called him good- looking, but he was the fortunate possessor of that cheerful type of ugliness which inspires immediate ceufidence in its owner. His nose had never quite recovered from the final one year in the Public Schools Heavy Weights; his mouth was not small. In fact, to be strictly accurate, only his eyes redeemed his face from being what is known in the vernacular as the Frozen Limit. Deep-set and steady, with eyelashes that many a woman had envied, they showed the man Ur what he was—a sportsman and a gentleman. And the combination of the two is an unbeatable production. He paused as he got to the table and glanced at the rows of letters. His servant, pretending to busy himself at the other end of the room, was watching him surrepti- tiously, and noted the grin which slowly spread over Drummond's face as he picked up two or three and examined the en- velopes. " Who would have thought it, James ? " he remarked at length. “ Great Scot! I shall have to get a partner." With disapproval showing in every line of her lace. Mrs. Denoy entered the room, carrying the kidneys, and Drummond glanced at her with a smile. " Good morning, Mrs. Denny,” he said. “ Wherefore this worried look on yoar face ? Has that reprobate James bee® misbehaving himself ? " The worthy woman snorted. " He ha5 not, sir—not yet, leastwise. And if so t* that he does"—her eyes travelled °P and down the back of the hapless Denny, who was quite unnecessarily pulling books ofl shelves and putting them back again-' " if so be that he does." she continue grimly, " him and me will have words-^ as I've told him already this morning- Sho stalked from the room, after staring pointedly at the letters in Drummond* hand, and the two men looked at °ae another.

I said. James—love appeals to me irresistibly. Find me a damsel in distress; a beautiful girl, helpless tn the dutches of knaves. Let me feel that 313 Hutchinson’s Story Magazine I can fly to her succour, clad in my new grey suiting.” He finished the last piece of bacon and pushed away his plate. " Amongst all that mass of paper there must surely be one from a lovely maiden, James, at whose disposal I can place my rusty sword. Incidentally, what has become of the damned thing ? ” " It’s in the lumber-room, sir—tied up with the old hurnbrella and the niblick yon don’t like.” ” Great heavens ! Is it ? ” Drum- mond helped himself to marmalade. “ And to think that I once pictured myself skewering Huns with it. Do you think anybody would be mug enough to buy it. James > ” But that worthy was engrossed in a letter he had just opened, and apparently failed to hear the question. A perplexed look was spreading over his facc, and suddenly he sucked his teeth loudly. It was a sure sign that James was excited, and though Drummond had almost cured him of this distressing habit, he occasionally forgot himself in moments of stress. His master glanced up quickly, and re- moved the letter from his hands. " I'm surprised at you, James,” he remarked severely'. " A secretary should control itself. Don't forget that the perfect secretary is an it: an automatic machine —a thing incapable of feeling. . . .” He read the letter through rapidly, and then, turning back to the beginning, he read it slowly through again. " My dear Box Xio,—I don't know whether your advertisement was a joke: I suppose it must have been. But I read it this morning, and it's just possible, Xio, just possible, that you mean it. And if you do, you're the man I want. I can offer you excitcment and probably crime. ” I'm up against it. Xio. For a girl I've bitten off rather more than I can chew. I want help—badly. Will you come to the Carlton for tea to-morrow afternoon ? I want to have a look at you and soe if I think you are genuine. Wear a white flower in your buttonhole.” Drummond laid the letter down, and pulled out his cigarette-case. " To* morrow, James," he murmured. *' That is to-day—this very afternoon. Verily I	believe that we have impinged upon the goods.'* He rose and stood looking ol,t of the window thoughtfully. " Go out. my trusty fellow, and buy me a daisy or a cauliflower or something white.” " You think it*9 genuine, sir ? ” James thoughtfully. His master blew out a cloud of smoke- " I know it is,” he answered dreamily- " Look at that writing ; the decision it—the character.

She seemed to think that it was her turn to conduct the examination, and Drummond turned to his tea while the scrutiny con- tinued. He poured himself oat a cup. and then fumbled in his waistcoat pocket. After a moment he found what he wanted, and taking out a card he propped it against the teapot so that the girl could see what was on it. In large block capitals he had written Box Xio. Then he added milk and sugar and waited. She spoke almost at once. *' You’ll do, Xio,’* she said, and ho turned to her with a smile. *' It's very nice of you to *ay so.” h* 3*5 . Hutchinson's Story Magazine murmured. " If I may, I will return the compliment. So will you.” She frowned slightly. " This isn't foolishness, you know. What I said in my letter is literally true.” " Which makes the compliment even more returnable," he answered. " If I am to embark on a life of crime, I would sooner collaborate with you than—shall wo say—that earnest eater over there with the tomato in her hat.” He waved vaguely at the lady in question and then held out his cigarette-case to the girl. " Turkish on this side—Virginian on that,” he remarked. “ And as I appear satisfactory, will you tell me who I'm to murder ? ” With the unlighted cigarette held in her fingers she stared at him gravely. ” I want you to tell me," she said at length, and there was no trace of jesting in her voice, “ tell me. on your word of honour, whether that advertisement was bona fide or a joke.” He answered her in the same vein. " It started more or less as a joke. It may now be regarded as absolutely genu- ine.” She nodded as if satisfied. " Are you prepared to risk your life ? ” Drummond's eyebrows went up and then he smiled. " Granted that the induce- ment is sufficient," he returned slowly. ” I think that I may say that I am." She nodded again. ” You won’t be asked to do it in order to obtain a half- penny bun,” she remarked. " If you've a match, I would rather like a light.” Drummond apologised. ” Our talk on trivialities engrossed me for the moment,” he murmured. He held the lighted match for her, and as he did so he saw that she was staring over his shoulder at some one behind his back. " Don't look round,” she ordered, ” and tell me your name quickly.” ” Drummond—Captain Drummond, late of the Loamshire9.” Ho leaned back m his cbair, and lit a cigarette himself. " And are you going to Henley this year ? ” Her voice was a shade louder than before. " I don’t know.” he answered casually. " I may run down for a day possibly- but-”	-J " My dear Phyllis,” said a voice behind;, his back, " this is a pleasant surprise, had no idea that you were in London.'

And they were very big : and the face they were set in was very charming —especially at the angle it was tilted at. in the half-light of the room. Altogether. Drummond reflected, a most adorable girl. And adorable girls had always been a hobby of his. Probably Lakington pos- sessed a letter of hers or something, and she wanted him to get it back. Of course he would, even if he had to thrash the swine to within an inch of his life. “ Well 1 ” The girl's.voioe cut into his train of thought and he hurriedly pulled himself together. " The last thing I want is for the in- cident to finish." he said fervently. " Why —it’s only just begun." " Then you’ll help me ? " " That's what I'm here for.” With a smile Drummond lit another cigarette. ” Tell me all about it.” ’’ The trouble," she began after a moment, " is that there is not very much to tell. At present it is largely guess- work, and guess-work without much of a clue. However, to start with, I had better tell you what sort of men too are up against. Firstly, Henry Lakington —the man who spoke to me. He was, I believe, one of the most brilliant vrientist* who has ever been up at Oxford. There was nothing, in his own line, which would not have been open to him, had he run straight. But he didn't. He deliber- ately chose to turn his brain to crime.

What particular form of crime does he favour ? " “ Anything that calls for brain, iron nerve, and refinement of detail," she answered. “ Principally, up to date, bur- glary on a big scale, and murder.” " My dear soul ! " said Hugh incre- dulously. " How can you be sure ? And why don't you tell the police ? ” She smiled wearily. " Because I’ve got no proof, and even if I had . . She gave a little shudder, and left her sentence un- finished. " But one day, my father and I were in his house, and, by accident, I got into a room I’d never been in before. It was a strange room, with two large safes let into the wall and steel bars over the sky- light in the coiling. There wasn’t a win- dow, and the floor seemed to be made of concrete. And tbe door was covered with curtains, and was heavy to move—almost as if it was steel or irdn. On the desk in the middle of the room lay some miniatures, and, without thinking, I picked them up and looked at them. I happen to know something about miniatures, and, to my horror, I recognised them." She paused for a momeut as a waiter went by their table. " Do you.remember the theft <i the cele- brated Vatican miniatures belonging to the Duke of Melbourne ? " Drummond nodded : he was beginning to feel interested. " They were the ones I was holding in my hand," she said quietly. ” I knew them at once from the description in the papers. And just as I was wondering what on earth to do. the man himself walked into the room.” “ Awkward—deuced awkward.” Drum- mond pressed out his cigarette and leaned forward expectantly. " What did he do? " " Absolutely nothing," said the girl. 11	That’s what made it so awful. " ’ Admiring my treasures.’ he remarked. ' Pretty things, aren't they ? * I couldn't speak a word : I just put them back on the table. " ‘ Wonderful copies,’ he went on. 0 the Duke of Melbourne's lost miniatures- I think they would deceive most people- " ’ They deceived me,’ I managed get out.	* 2J| " ' Did they ?

' Come be**j Miss Benton,' he said. ’ There are a more—copies.' " I only looked inside for a moment. ^ I have never seen or thought of sue sight.

They’re large and white and utterly ruthless." She turned to him appealingly. '* Oh ! don’t think I'm talking wildly," she implored. “ He frightens me to death—that man : far. far worse than Lakington. He would stop at nothing to gain his ends, and even Lak- iagton himself knows that Mr. Peterson is his master." “ Peterson ! ” murmured Drummond. ” It seems quite a sound old English name." The girl laughed scornfully. " Oh ! the name is sound enough, if it was his real one. As it is, it's about as real as his daughter." " There is a lady in the case, then ? ” “ By the name of Irma," said the girl briefly. *' She lies on a sofa in the garden and yawns. She's no more English than that waiter.” A faint smile flickered over her com- panion's face ; he had formed a fairly vivid mental picture of Irma. Then he grew serious again. “ And what is it that makes you think there's mischief ahead ?" he asked abruptly. The girl shrugged her shoulders. ** What the novelists call feminine intuition, I suppose," she answered. “ That—and my father." She said the last words very low. *' He hardly ever sleeps at night now; I hear him pacing up and down his room —hour after hour, hour after hour. Oh 1 it makes me mad. . . . Don’t you under- stand ? I’ve just got to find out what the trouble is. I’ve got to get him away from those devils, before he breaks down com- pletely." Drummond nodded, and looked away. The tears were bright in her eyes. and. like every Englishman, he detested a scene. While she had been speaking he had made up his mind what course to take, and now, having outsat everybody else, lie de- cided that it was timo for the interview to cease. Already an* early diner was having a cocktail, while Lakington might return at any moment. And if there was anything in what she had told him. it struck him that it would be as well for that icentleman not to find them still to- gether. " I think," he said, " we'd better go. My address is 6oa Half Moon Street ; my 319 Hutchinson’s Story Magazine telephone 1234 Mayfair. If anything hap- pens, if ever you want me—at any hour of the day or night—ring me up or write. If I’m not in, loave a message with my ser- vant Denny. He is absolutely reliable. The only other thing is your own address.” “ The Larches, near Godalming," an- swered the girl, as they moved towards the door. " Oh ! if you only knew the glori- ous relief of feeling one’s got some one to turn to . . ." She looked at him wiib shining eyes, and Drummond felt his pulse quicken suddenly. Imagination or not, so far as her fears were concerned, the girl was one of the loveliost things he had ever seen. " May I drop you anywhere ? " he asked, as they stood on the pavement, but she shook her head, “ No, thank you. I'll go in that taxi." She gave the man an address, and stepped in, while Hugh stood bareheaded by the door. " Don't forget," he said earnestly. " Any time of the day or night. And while I think of it—we're old friends. Can that be done ? In case I come and stay, you see." She thought for a moment and then nodded her head. " All right," she an- swered. ** We've met a lot in London during the war." With a grinding of gear wheels the taxi drove off, leaving Hugh with a vivid pic- ture imprinted on his mind ot blue eyes, and white teeth, and a skin like the bloom of a sun-kissed peach. for a moment or two he stood staring after it, and then he walked across to his own car. With his mind still full oi the interview he drove slowly along Piccadilly, while every now and then he smiled grimly to himself. Was the whole tiling an ela- borate hoax ? Was the girl even now chuckling to )isreAf at his gullibility ? If so, the game had only just begun, and he had no objection to a few more rounds with such an opponent. A mere tea at the Carlton could hardly be the full extent of the jest. . . . And somehow deep down in his mind, he wondered whether it was a joke—whether, by some freak of fate, he had stumbled on one of those strange mys- teries which up to date he had regarded as existing only in the realms of shilling shockers. He turned into his rooms, and stood «* front of the mantelpiece taking off W® gloves. It was as he was about to them down on the table that an envelop® caught his eye, addressed to him in ^ unknown handwriting. Mechanically *** picked it up and opened it. Inside was single half-sheet of notepaper, on which * few lines had been written in a small. nea hand. “ There are more things in Heaven Earth, yonng man, than a capability to steak and onions, and a desire for ture.

Denny made a movement letters he had been sorting. kom a lovely widow with two “ Lovely,” cried Drummond. “ How forward of her ! ” He glanced at the letter and smiled, ” Care, James, and accuracy are essential in a secretary. The misguided woman calls herself lonely, not lovely. She will remain so, as far as I am concerned, until the other matter is settled." ” Will it take long, sir. do you think ? " ” To get it settled ? ” Drummond lit a cigarette and leaned back in his chair. “ Listen, James, and I will outline the case. The maiden lives at a house called The Larches, near Godalming. with her papa. Not far away is another house called The Elms, owned by a gentleman of the name of Henry Lakington—a nasty man. James, with a nasty face— who was also at the Carlton yesterday afternoon for a short time. And now we come to the point. Miss Benton— that is Ihe lady's name—accuses Mr. Lakington of being the complete IT in the criminal line. She wont even so far as to say that he was the second most dangerous man in England." " Indeed, sir. More coflee, sir ? ” " Will nothing move you. James ? " re- marked his master plaintively. " This man murders people and does things like that, you know." " Personally, sir. I prefer a picture- palace. But I suppose there ain’t no accounting for ‘obbies. May 1 clear away, sir ? " ” No, James, not at present. Keep quite still wliilc 1 go on. or I shall get it wrong. Threo months ago there arrived at The Elms, the most dangerous man in England—the IT of ITS. This gentleman goes by the name of Peterson, and he owns a daughter. From what Miss Benton said, I have doubts about that daughter. James." He rose and strolled over to the window. " Grave doubt*. However, to return to the point, it appear* that some unpleasuig conspiracy is being hatched by IT, the IT of ITS, and the doubtful daughter, into which Papa Benton has been unwillingly drawn. As far as I can make out. the suggestion is that I should uuravcl the tangled skein of crime and extricate papa.” 321 Hutchinson’s Story Magazine In a spasm of uncontrollable excitement James sucked his teeth. " Lumme, it wouldn’t 'alf go on the movies, would it ? ” he remarked. " Better than them Red Indians and things." “ I fear, James, that you are not in the habit of spending your spare time at the British Museum, as I hoped,” said Drummond. “ And your brain doesn't work very quickly. The point is not whether this hideous affair is better than Red Indians and things—but whether it’s genuine. Am I to battle with mur- derers, or shall I find a house-party roaring with laughter on the lawn ? " “ As long as you laughs like 'ell yourself, sir, I don't see as 'ow it makes much odds," answered James philosophically. “ The first sensible remark you've made this morning," said his master hopefully. “ I will go prepared to laugh.” He picked up a pipe from th*mantel- piece, and proceeded to fill it, while James Denny still waited in silence. ” A lady may ring up to*day," Drum- snond continued. “ Miss Benton, to be cxact. Don't say where I’ve gone if she does ; but take down any message, and wire it to me at Godalming Post Office. If by any chance you don't hear from me for three days, get in touch with Scotland Yard, and tell 'em where I’ve gone. That covers everything if it's genuine. If, on the other hand, it's a hoax, and the house- party is a good one. I shall probably want you to come down with my evening clothes and some more kit." “ Very good. sir. 1 will clean yom small Colt revolver at once,” Hugh Drummond paused in the act of lighting his pipe, and a grin spread slowly over his face. " Excellent." he said. " And see if you can find that water- squirt pistol I used to have—a Son of a Gun they called it. That ought to raise a laugh, when I arrest the murderer with it.” II The 30 h.p. two*»catcr made abort work of the run to Godalming. Under the dickey seat behind lay a small bag, con- taining the bare ncccssaries for the night; and as Drummond thought of the two gun3 rolled up carefully in his pyjamas—tbe harmless toy and the wicked little auto- matic—he grinned gently to himself. The girl had not rung him up during tbe morning, and after a comfortable lunch at his club, he had started about three o'clock. The hedges, fresh with the glory of spring, flashed past; the smell of the country came sweet and fragrant on the air. There was a gentle warmth, a balm** ness in the day that made it good to be alive, and once or twice he sang under hi* breath through sheer lightheartedness 0* spirit. Surrounded by the peaceful beauty of the fields, with an occasional villa#* half hidden by great trees from under which the tiny bouses peeped out, ** seemed impossible that crime could exist —laughable.

He leant lts steering-wheel and lit a second r^ette. Are you likely to be long ? ’* “Sapper” (Cyril McNeile) lie asked; " because if so, I'll stop my engine.” The other man was now approaching casually, and Drummond regarded him curiously. “ A friend of our little Phyllis. Peterson," said Lakington, as he came up. *' I found them having tea together yesterday at the Carlton.” " Any friend of Miss Benton's is, I hope, ours," said Peterson with a smile. “ You've known her a long time, I expect ? ” " Quite a long time." returned Hugh. " We have jazzed together on many occa- sions.” ” Which makes it all the more unfor- tunate that we should have delayed you," said Peterson. ” I can't help thinking, Lakington, that that new chaufleur is a bit of a fool.” " I hope he avoided the crash ail right,” murmured Drummond politely. Both men looked at him. " The crash I ” said Lakington. ” There was no question of a crash. We just stopped.” *' Really.” remarked Drummond. '* 1 think, sir. that you must be right in your diagnosis of your chauffeur's mentality.” He turned courteously to Peterson. ” When something goes wrong, for a fellah to stop his car, by breaking so hard that he locks both back wheels, is no bon, as we used to say in France. I thought, judging by tlie tracks in the dust, that you must have been in imminent danger of ramming a traction engine. Or perhaps.” he added judicially. ” a sudden order to stop would have produced the same effect.” If he saw the lightning glance that passed between the two men he gave no sign. •’ May I offer you a cigarette ? Turkish that side—Virginian the other. I won- der if I could help your man.” he continued when they had helped themselves. " I'm a bit of an expert with a Rolls.” '* How very kind of you,” said Peterson. •* I'll go and see.” He went over to the man and spoke a few words. ” Isn’t it extraordinary," remarked Hugh, *' how the eye of the boas galvanises tbe average man into activity I As lun*. probably, as Mr. Peterson had remained here talking, that chauffeur would have gone on tinkering with the engine, And 3-J Hutchinson’s Story Magazine now—look, in a second—all serene. And yet I daresay Mr. Peterson knows nothing about it really. Just the watching eye, Mr. Lakington. Wonderful thing—the human optic.” He rambled on with a genial smile, watching with apparent interest the car in front. " Who's the quaint bird sitting beside the chauffeur ? He appeals to me immensely. Wish to Heaven I'd had a few more like him in France to turn into snipers.” " May I ask why you think he would have been a success at the job ? ” Laking- ton's voice expressed merely perfunctory interest, but his cold, steely eyes were fixed on Drummond. ” He's so motionless,” answered Hugh. " The bally fellow hasn't moved a muscle since I've been here. I believe he'd sit on a hornet’s nest, and leave the inmates guessing. Great gift, Mr Lakington. Shows a strength of will but rarely met with—a mind which rises above mere vulgar curiosity.” " It is undoubtedly a great gift to have such a mind, Captain Drummond.” said Lakington. “ And if it isn't bcirn in a man, he should most certainly try to cul- tivate it.” He pitched his cigarette away, and buttoned up his coat. " Shall we be seeing you this evening ? ” Drummond shrugged his shoulders. " I’m the vaguest man that ever lived.” he said lightly. " I might be listening to nightingales in the country ; or I might be consuming steak and onions preparatory to going to a night club. So long. . . . You must let me take you to Hector's one night. Hope you don’t break down again so suddenly.” He watched the Rolls-Royce start, but seemed in no hurry to follow suit. And his many friends, who were wont to regard Hugh Drummond as a mass of brawn not too plentifully supplied with brains, would have been puzzled had they seen the look of keen concentration on his face, as he stared along the white dusty road. He coold not say why. but suddenly and very certainly the conviction had come to him, that this was no hoax and no leg-pull— but grim and sober reality. la la* imagina- tion he heard the sudden sharp order to stop the instant they were over the hill- so that Peterson might have a chance of inspecting him ; in a flash of intuition he knew that these two men were no ordinal people, and that he was suspect. And as he slipped smoothly after the big car. now well out of sight, two thoughts were donu* nant in his mind. The first was that thef* was some mystery about the motionless unnatural man who had sat beside driver ; the second was a distinct of relief that his automatic was loaded. ni At half-past five he stopped in front oj God aiming Post Office.

" If once those men suspect anything, God knows what will happen.” It was on the tip of his tongue to tell her that it was too late to worry aboot that; then he changed his mind. “ And what is there suspicious," he asked, *' in an old friend who happens to be in the neighbourhood dropping in to call ? Do you mind if I smoke ? “ The girl beat her hands together. *' My dear man,” she cried, " you don’t under- stand. You're judging those devils by your own standard. They suspect every- thing—and everybody." " What a distressing habit," he mur- mured. " Is it chronic, or merely due to liver ? I must send ’em a bottle of good salts. Wonderful thing — good salts. Never without some in France." The girl looked at him resignedly. " You're hopeless," she remarked—" abso- lutely hopeless." " Absolutely," agreed Hugh, blowing out a cloud of smoke. " Wherefore your telephone message ? What’s the worry ? " She bit her lip and drummed with her fingers on the arm of her chair. " If I tell you,” she said at length, " will you pro- mise me. on your word of honour, that you won't go blundering into The Elms, or do anything foolish like that ? ” “At tiie present moment I'm very com- fortable where I am. thanks." remarked Hugh. *' I know.” she said; " but I'm bo dread- fcilly afraid that you're the type of person who . . . who . . ." She paused, at a loas for a word. " Who bellows like a bull, and charges head down,” interrupted Hugh with a grin. She laughed with him. and just for a moment their eyes met. and she read in his something quite foreign to the point at issue. In fact, it is to be feared that the question of Lakington and his companions was not engrossing Drummond's mind, as 325 Hutchinson’s Story Magazine it doubtless should have been, to the ex- clusion of all else. " They’re so utterly unscrupulous," she continued hurriedly, " so fiendishly clever, that even you would be like a child in their hands." Hugh endeavoured to dissemble his plea- sure at that little word " even," and only succeeded in frowning horribly. " I will be discretion itself,” he assured her firmly. “ I promise you.” “ I suppose I shall have to trust you,” she said. " Have you seen the evening papers to-day ? ” " I looked at the ones that come out in the morning labelled six p.m. before I had lunch," he answered. " Is there anything of interest ? ” She handed him a copy of the Planet. " Read that little paragraph in the second column.” She pointed to it, as he took the paper, and Hugh read it aloud. " Mr. Hiram C. Potts—the celebrated American millionaire—is processing favour* ably. He has gone into the country a few days, but is sufficiently recovered to conduct business as usual." He 1**“ down the paper and looked at the g‘rl sitting opposite. " One is pleased," remarked in a puzzled tone, " for the sak® of Mr. Potts.

And it’s only by following up every possible clue,” she continued fiercely. “ that 1 can hope to beat those fiends and get Daddy out of their clutches.” Drummond nodded gravely, and did not speak. For into his mind had flashed suddenly the remembrance of that sinister, motionless figure seated by the chaufleur. The wildest guess-work certainly—no vestige of proof—and yet, having once come, the thought stuck. And as he turned it over in his mind, almost prepared to laugh at himself for his credulity— millionaires are not removed against their will, in broad daylight, from one of the biggest hotels in I.ondon, to sit in immov- able silence in an open car—the door opened and an elderly man came in. Hugh rose, and the girl introduced the two men. ’’ An old friend. Daddy.” she said. " You must have heard me speak of Captain Drummond." “ I don't recall the name at the moment, my dear,” he answered courteously—a fact which was hardly surprising—" but I fear I'm getting a little forgetful. I am pleased to meet you. Captain Drum- mond. You'll stop and have some dinner, of course.” Hugh bowed. " I should like to, Mr. Benton. Thank you very much. I'm afraid the hour of my call was a little informal, but being round in these parts. I felt I must come and look Miss Benton up.” His host smiled absentmimledly, and walking to the window, stared through the gathering dusk at the house opposite, half hidden in the tree#. And Hugh, who was watching him from under lowered lids, saw him suddenly clench both hands in a gesture of despair It cannot be said that dinner was a meal of sparkling gaiety. Mr. Benton was palpably ill at case, and beyond a few desultory remarks spoke hardly at all: while the girl, who sat opposite Hugh, though she made one or two valiant at- tempts to break the long silences, spent most of the meal in covertly watching Uf father. If anything more had been required to convince Drummond of the He pulled the curtain aside.	genuineness of his interview with her at 3«7 Hutchinson’s Story Magazine the Carlton the preceding day. the at- mosphere at this strained and silent party supplied it. As if unconscious of anything peculiar, he rambled on in his usual inconsequent method, heedless of whether he was answered or not ; but all the time his mind was busily working. He had al- ready decided that a Rolls-Royce was not the only car on the market which could break down mysteriously, and with the town so far away, his host could hardly fail to ask him to stop the night. And then—he had not yet quite settled how— he proposed to have a closer look at the Elms. At length the meal was over, and the maid, placing the decanter in front of Mr. Benton, withdrew from the room. " You’ll have a glass of port. Captain Drummond,’’ remarked his host, removing the stopper, and pushing the bottle to- wards him. " An old pre-war wine which I can vouch for.” Hugh smiled, and even as he lifted the heavy old cut glass, he stiffened suddenly in his chair. A cry—half shout, half scream, and stifled at once—had come echoing through the open windows. With a crash the stopper fell from Mr. Benton's nerveless fingers, breaking the finger-bowl In front of him, while every vestige of colour left his face. " It’s something these days to be able to say that.” remarked Hugh, pouring himself out a glass. ‘‘ Wine, Miss Benton?*’ He looked at the girl, who was staring fearfully out of the window, and forced her to meet his eye. " It will do you good." His tone was compelling, and after a moment’s hesitation, she pushed the glass over to him. ” Will you pour it out ? ” she said, and he saw that she was trembling nil over. ” Did you—did you hear—anything ? '* With a vain endeavour to speak calmly, his host looked at Hugh. *' That night-bird ? '* he answered easily. " Eerie noises they make, don't they ? Sometimes in France, when every- thing was still, and only the ghosUy green flares wont hissing up, one used to hear ’em. Startled nervous sentries out ol their lives.” He talked on, and gradually the colour came back to the other man’s face. But Hugh noticed that he drained his port at a gulp, and immediately filled his glass. . . . Outside everything was still; no repe* tition of that short, strangled cry a■7**° . disturbed the silence.

He pulled them aside, them come together behind him ; *!• then, cautiously, he unbolted one side of tho big ccntrc window. The night was dark, and the moon was not due to rise for two or three hours, but he was too old a soldier to neglect any precautions. He wanted to sec more of The Elms and its inhabitants ; he did not want them to sec more of him. Silently he dodged across the lawn towards the big trees at the end, and leaning up against one of them, he pro- ceeded to make a more detailed survey of his objective. It was the same type of house as the one he had just left, and the grounds seemed about tho same size. A wire fence separated the two places, and in the darkness Hugh could just make out a small wicket-gate, closing a path which connected both houses. He tried it, and found to his satisfaction that it opened silently. Passing through, he took cover behind some bushes from which he could com- mand a better view of Mr. Lakington’* abode. Save for one room on the ground* (ioor the house was in darkness, and Hugh determined to have a look at that room. There was a chink in the curtains, through Which the light was streaming out, which struck him as having possi- bilities. Keeping under cover, he edged towards it, and, at length, he got iuto a position from which he could see inside. And what he saw made him decide to chance it, and go even closer. Seated at the table was a man he did not recognise; while on cither aide of him sat Lakington and Peterson. Lying on a sofa smoking a cigarette and reading a novel was a tall dark girl, who seemed completely uninterested in the proceedings of the other three. Hugh placed her at once as the doubtful daughter Irma, and resumed his watch on the group at tho table. A paper was in front of the man, and Peterson, who was smoking a large cigar, was apparently suggesting that he should make use of the pen which Lakington was obligingly holding In readiness. In all respects a harmless tableau, save for one small thing—the expression on the 329 Hutchinson’s Story Magazine man’s face. Hugh had seen it before often —only then it had been called shell-shock. The man was dazed, semi-unconscious. Every now and then he stared round the room, as if bewildered ; then lie would shake his head and pass his hand wearily over his forehead. For a quarter of an hour the scene continued ; then Lakington produced an instrument from his pocket. Hugh saw the man shrink back in terror, and reach for the pen. He saw the girl he back on the sofa as if disappointed and pick up her novel again; and he saw Lakington's face set in a cold sneer. But what impressed him most in that momentary flash of action was Peterson. There was something inhuman in his com- plete passivity. By not the fraction of a second did he alter the rate at which he was smoki.ig—the slow, leisurely rate of the connoisseur; by not the twitch of an eyelid did hii expression change. Even as he watched the man signing his name, no trace of emotijn showed on his face— whereas on LakLigton’s there shone a fiendish satisfaction. The document was still lying on the table, when Hugh produced his revolver. He knew there was foul play about, and the madness of what he had suddenly made up his mind to do never struck him : being that manner of fool, he was made that way. But he breathed a pious prayer that he would shoot straight—and then he held his breath. The crack of the shot and the bursting of the only electric-light bulb in the room were almost simultaneous; and the next second, with a roar of " Come on, boys," he burst through the window. At an immense advantage over the others, who could see nothing for the moment, he blundered round the room. lie timed the blow at Lakington to a nicety : he hit liim straight on the point of the jaw and he felt the man go down like a log. Then he grabbed at the paper on the table, which tore in his hand, and picking the dazed signer up bodily, he rushed through the window on to the lawn. There was not an instant to be lost ; only the impossi- bility of seeing when suddenly plunged into darkness, had enabled him to pall the thing oflf so far. And before that advan- tage disappeared he had to be back at The Larches with his burden, no light weight for even a man of his strength to carry. But there seemed to be no pursuit, no hue and cry. As he reached the little gate he paused and looked back, and he fancied he saw outside the window a gleam ot white, such as a shirt-front. He lingered for an instant, peering into the darkness and recovering his breath, when with a vicious phut something buried itself in the tree beside him. Drummond fingered n° more ; long years of experience left doubt in his mind as to what that some* thing was. " Compressed-air rifle —or electric.” ^ muttered to himself, stumbling on. and half dragging, half carrying his dazed coin* panion. He was not very clear in his own mind what to do next, but the matter was settled for him unexpectedly. Barely had b® got into the drawing-room, when the doof opened and the girl rushed in. ** Get him away at oncc." she cried* “ In your car. . . .

It was hard to behove that he had ever moved from the table; only the bullet imbedded in a tree proved that somebody must have got busy. Of course, it might have been the girl, who was just lighting another cigarette from the stump of the old one. At length Peterson spoke. " A young man of dash and temperament," he said genially. " It will be a pity to lose him." “ Why not keep him and lose tbe girl ?

And for all his Scotch shrewdnr**, the hard-headedness which is typically Northern, was strangely sensitive to im- pression. That was why he found such delight in strolling through the bazaars, studying the types he saw on every hand with the trained interest of the psychologist and the more romantic curiosity of the idealist. Particularly was he interested in the goldsmiths, plying their trade with the most delicate of tools, the mo*t deft of fingers ; and in the jewellers, those hungry spiders who spun webs of the loveliest jewels, iridescent and sparkling, with which to entice the rich flies who visited their unpretentious booths. For the last three days, indeed. Dr. Caird had been in negotiation with old 1 lutsein -ben • I lassan for the purchase of a ring, a great green emerald set in a most delicious claw-setting of the finest gold, which he had set his heart on presenting to his mother, a month hence, on the occasion 333 Hutchinson’s Story Magazine of her golden wedding. And although the pricc was still beyond his means, he was not without hope that a satisfactory bargain might be driven after all. As he entered Hussein's shop this after- noon the jewel-seller came towards him with an eagerness which yet held no hint of servility ; and Caird began to hope that the old villain was about to accede to his terms—a hope which was quickly dispelled by Hussein's first words, spoken in un- grammatical French. " I am honoured, M'sieu, by your visit. You desire the emerald, is it not ? But htlas, M'sieu, another customer, won by the green fire of the jewel, is willing to give poor Hussein his price ! And unless M’sieu see his way to paying the paltry sum-” He raised deprecating shoulders, shooting keen glances out of his eye-comers at the prospective customer the while. Caird, uncertain whether this was mere bluff, hesitated ; and as he did so a sccond Arab came forward from the dark recesses of the shop and placed a small object in Hussein’s hand, retiring as swifUy as he had advanced. Hussein himself wore the shabby frock-coat and red tarbflsh of so- called civilisation, but the second merchant was clothed in flowing robes, a turban bound round his head ; and as Caird looked, idly enough, at the man, his quick eyes caught sight of a strange little scar, in shape like a miniature horseshoe, on the forehead beneath the edge of the folded turban. Almost as though the Arab resented liis scrutiny, he raised his hand and dragged the folds of drapery lower, so as to conceal the scar completely, and at the same time a Hash of something not unlike rage shone out of his dark eyes with strangely dis- concerting effect. The whole incident occupied less than ten seconds, yet it was unconsciously stored away in Caird's retentive memory, though it was most certainly of no importance whatever. As the second Arab retired, Hussein opened his hand to display another ring, scarcely less effective than the first, save that in this case the emerald was a trifle smaller and round instead of square. *■ My assistant, Mahomet-ben-Hadj, M .flunk this ring may suit M'sieu’s purpose. He spoke glibly, still shooting those keen glances at the other’s face. " It is a little cheaper than the first—a matter of fifty francsonly—but it is of almost equal beauty. n’esl-ce-pas, M’sieu ? ” " H’m, yes. it’s not bad." He was care- ful not to express the admiration he really felt. " But I’d rather have the square one. Come, Hussein, you know you're charging exorbitantly for the thing. Let me have it at the price I offer, three hundred francs, and we shall both be satisfied." The jewel-seller uttered a cry of pr0* test. " Mash’allah, but the hakim possess** the instinct of a Jew ! ” He had already made himself acquainted with the status ol his would-be customer. " I am a p°°r man, M'sieu, but to makj so miserable 3 bargain would turn my few hairs white with shame. Nay, M'sieu. rather woul'j I give you the ring 1 Take it, M'sieu. ao^ know that the despised seller of jewels * man of generosity indeed 1 " He held out the ring in his open pal®* with a magnificent gesture; but Cai*1* laughed and shook his head. “ No. Hussein, nothing doing.

" For four hundred francs the ring M'sieu s." He spoke with an air of plete magnanimity ; and Caird. who h*'- not expected to get the beautiful under sixteen pound*, pretended to sider the question for a moment: which he shrugged his shoulder* in imitat^j of the other man's habitual gesture. **V signified his willingness to be thus rob**“„ G1 his hard-earned money. The transaction completed, it 'r ^ inevitable he should partake of a cup . coffee with his late adversary in the 334 Kathlyn Rhodes °* words, and the pair retreated to a dim corner of the little shop where, half hidden by a screen of priceless meshribyeh work. theV squatted on low stool3 and gravely s,Pped the mastic-scented coffee in token of friendship. Barely was the ceremonial rite begun before two prospective customers entered little place, and with a muttered word °* apology to his guest Hussein went for- ward, bowing, to greet the pair. He spoke in French, as usual, and Caird Perforce gathered that this was the man Who had expressed a desire to purchase square emerald ring. After a rapid e*Planation of the sale, Hussein produced “e second ring ; and as the two examined **• their heads nearly touching in their ea8erness, Caird observed them idly: °tore from habit—the habit of observation ~^*han from any real curiosity. He had seen the girl before, passing in and 0,11 °f Shepheard's, where he himself was ^ying, and he had taken notice of her °n three separate counts : one, her extreme y°«th; two. her real though rather fragile P**ttiness; and three, her look of fear as J^Wplified by the timid glances which she ***bttually cast from side to side, as diough T* Uved in a state of constantapprehension. to-day, as she stood beside the good- v . n8- well-built youth who had brought »he did not lose her look of timidity. Caird's eyes narrowed as he noted the » nervous movements with which she ^*®er®d the beautiful ring. ^ t was evident that the man wished to y her the jewel, and equally evident ”*t she longed to possess it. yet for some hardly dared to sanction the gift; Caird found himself speculating as to could be the inner significance of r®loctance to appropriate the jewel, of money was apparently not tho for the man made no attempt to iq P* the bargain. Yet the girl hesitated that at last Hussein, with a clever '^T^Ption of indifference, turned away v_	to rummage among a heap of ^ *tone* laid out in small sauccrs on .	table, m though the transaction . Ceas«d to interest him. k* did so. Caird, sitting in his dark comer hidden from sight, heard a hurried whisper from the man which still further intrigued his awakening curiosity. “ Try it, darling; quick, take off that beastly wedding ring—just for a moment— to please me—and put on this one instead! ” With a swift movement the girl obeyed ; and, putting the discarded ring into the little silver bag she carried, slipped the emerald on to her slim finger in its place. It seemed a matter of some difficulty to get it on, for the ring was of an unusually small size, but she persevered, and finally it flashed triumphantly on her hand. At the same moment Caird heard a quick gasp beside him. and, turning hastily, saw the Arab assistant craning forward from his stool in his dark comcr. his fierce eyes blazing upon the pair with a veritable fire of mingled triumph and fury. So startling was the sight that Caird himself uttered an involuntary exclamation, whereon the Arab rose from his stool and retired into some still more mysterious recess in the shadowy little shop. A moment later the jewel merchant was recalled, and the transaction concluded with the payment of a goodly number of English -sovereigns, those wonderful pieces of gold which, before the days of the great war, carried their value all over the civilised world. To Caird's relief the offer of coffec was replaced by a gift of cigarettes and Turkish Delight, after which the two left the shop, followed by bows and compli- ments from the gratified Hussein. A few moments later Caird too departed, and, finding the afternoon was yet young, he called an arabeah and had himself driven out to the Ghezireh Palace Hotel, with a pleasant feeling in his heart that his present would delight his handsome, white-haired mot her, still a gracious and dignified figuro for all her sixty-nine year* He was interested, while lazily enjoying his tea on the terrace, to observe the couple of the ring episode sitting at a small table not very far from his own. and lie could not help noticing two fact* about the pair— one being tliat they were quite evidently oblivious of all save themselves, and the other that while the girl's left hand was still ornamented with the beautiful emerald 335 Hutchinson’s Story Magazine ring, there was no trace of the narrow band of gold which would surely have proclaimed her status to the world. Well, it was no business of his. They were a well-matched pair, in appearance at least ; and though the affair in the Bazar seemed to point to the presence—in the background—of a husband, possibly there were extenuating circumstances which made this tfte-A -Ute not only excusable, but innocuous. When, an hour later, Caird rose and strolled away over the marvellously kept greeu turf, the young couple were still lingering at their table, though the girl had glanced more than once at the little gold watch on her wrist, as though conscious that time was not standing still. When, later, he entered Shepheard's, all thought of the lovers had vanished from Caird's mind, occupied, truth to tell, with pleasant anticipations of an excellent dinner by and by. Yet he was to meet one of them again, in circumstances which would impress the meeting indelibly on his memory. As Caird was dressing, leisurely, for dinner, he heard a hurried knock on the door of his adjoining sitting-room, and called out a summons which went dis- regarded. A second later the knock was repeated, still more hurriedly ; and since another invitation proved fruitless, Caird slipped on liis coat and went to see who thus sought admittance. He opened the door rather brusquely, expecting to find some apologetic waiter or servant, but the vision which confronted him on the threshold made him begin to wonder if he were in a dream. For his importunate visitor was a woman —a woman dressed in a wonderful frock of foamy white chillon, half concealed by the satin wrap she held round her with a shaking hand Her fair hair shone like a golden halo round her delicate and fright- ened face, and it was evident she mu labouring uuder some tremendous excite- ment which deprived her of self-control and made her lips tremble almost too much for speech, Obviously the first thing to do was to reassure her. if she were to state the object A of her visit, and since tbe corridor of the hotel was a public lounging-place. it wa* equally obvious that she must be invited into the room before disclosing that object- When he spoke, his voice was carefully | modulated to inspire confidence. " You want to speak to me ? Well, won't you come inside and sit down ? " held the door open as he spoke, and iO' vited her to enter with a gesture which , induced compliance. She entered accordingly, and as she 1<* her satin wrap slip on to a chair beside her. his eyes were riveted, instantly, to the small left hand, whereon an emerald flashed and glowed, a veritable point of green and translucent fire. Instantly the same quick eyes sought he* face, and what had hitherto been a sus- picion became a certainty.

Really and truly, it must come off—if you have to chop my finger off as well ! " She was again pulling frantically at the gold circlet, and it was plain to see her nerves were giving way. For some as yet unexplained reason she found it imperative that the ring should be removed, and suddenly Caird remembered the fact that she had taken off her wedding ring in order to put on this other trinket. , . . He spoke quietly. " Don't inflame your finger any more. You're staying in the hotel, aren’t you. Miss—er-” He hesitated purposely, but she did not speak. ** Shall I come along presently and see what I can do ? " " Oh, no, no ! ” She spoke vehemently. *’ You mustn't do that I But—oh, can't you please do something—anything—to help me ? It—it's almost a matter of life and death ! ” I’ll try.” He had decided that curio* sity must wait. ” We’ll experiment with a bit of cotton, and if that fails, well, there's one expedient left, but it's a des- perate one I ” ** What’a that ? ” The question shot out sharply. " I'll have to file it ofl. But we'll try less heroic measures first. Just «t back quietly, and let me see what I can do.” She obeyed, and for nearly a quarter of an hour he laboured, trying his very liardcst to solve the problem of sliding the ring over the slender finger which yet. slender as it was. proved too large for the small circle around it. As the time went on he could hear her breath coming quickly, and when at length the clock on the mantel- piece struck the half-hour after seven, she broke out into a wailing cry wfcich betokened her to be on the very edge oI a breakdown. “ Oh, can’t you—can’t you get it of! ? If you can't—oh, cut my finger ofl—any- thing t I can't—1 can't face my husband with this ring on my hand I ” For a moment he ceased his endeavour*. 337 Hutchinson’s Story Magazine bending his keen eyes on her face with a closeness of scrutiny beneath which she turned ashy pale. " Your husband ? See here, Mrs.- I	don’t know your name yet, but didn’t I see you in Hussein's shop this afternoon with a tall, blue-eyed chap-” “ Yes, yes ! " She interrupted him hysterically. “ It was my—my friend who bought me this ring. Oh, it was only as a souvenir. We were engaged once, you know —three years ago ; and when my father made me marry Sir Peter”—she bit her lip, then hurried on as though she had decided concealment were useless—" Sir Peter Clinton, why, I had to break off with Hugh, and I've never seen him since, till three days ago when we met, by chance, in the street here in Cairo.” ” And I gather you don't want your husband to inquire into the history of this ring, Lady Clinton ? ” Although his fingers, busy with the ring, were gentle as ever, there was a hint of cynicism in his tone which cut the girl to the heart. ” Oh, you are condemning me—of course I " Her voice had tears in it. " Every one would, I suppose, unless they knew everything. But—God only knows what I've had to bear ! To marry a child of seventeen to that man-" She shuddered so violently that her hand shook in his. “ Why, he laughed at me 011 our wedding day ; jeered me because my father had sold me to him to pay his debts ; and he—he took me because I was young, and he couldn’t hope to get a decent woman any other way I " " Lady Clinton, don't talk so—you’re upsetting yourself.” " Oh. you don't know what it means—a marriage like mine ! ” She spoke impetu- ously, the words bursting forth in a quick torrent. ” If I looked at another man— the merest passing glance—my husband reviled mo. He was wildly, insanely jealous of me—not because he loved me. but because I was his. I couldn't speak to the most casual acquaintance without finding him at my elbow, and he made my life one long-drawn-out insult. . . She broke off, her breast heaving, but before he could speak she was off again. " Four days ago he left me here, suddenly* to go to Alexandria for a week on what he called business. At first I thought it "’3s only pretence, that he was pretending 10 go so that he could spy on me, and catch me doing something he could punish me for : and then, when I found he had really gone, I felt like a bird let out of a cage. wanted to dance, to sing, to do anything* however absurd, to mark my freedom- .

Pity she didn't marry that looking young chap—they'd have made a splendid couple. Well, it’s no business of mine, and I don't suppose I shall ever run across little Lady Clinton again ! " He did not see her as he sat at dinner in the crowded restaurant; nor was she to be seen in the lounge afterwards, though he caught a glimpse of the man she had called Hugh pacing distractedly up and down in the street outside the hotel, unconscious of the shrewd eyes which watched him from the terrace above. It was evident that the young man knew of Sir Peter's arrival, yet could not tear himself away from the spot which housed the girl he loved ; and Caird felt strangely sorry for the lover who had been twice bereft of his right to place a ring on the finger of his beloved. At last, with a final lingering look at the great building, the young man turned and strode away into the night, and Caird rose and re-entered the hotel, intending to write a couple of letters and go to bed. But just as his foot was upon the lowest stair a man touched him quietly on the arm. and turning quickly he found the head waiter at his elbow. "Pardon, M'sieu"—Gustav was a Frenchman—" M. le Propriilaire makes you his compliments, and begs yon to derange yourself sufficiently to make a visit to room Numero Quinze. There is a pauvre Monsieur there who is taken ill, and it is feared he will perhaps die without attention.” " Right. Show me the room.” He spoke brusquely, all his professional in- stincts to the fore. Led by Gustav, he hastened to the first floor, and was admitted without delay into a large room on the right hand side of the corridor. It was the usual hotel bedroom of the East, with high green wall* and polished floor, and on the couch which stood across the foot of the two beds lay a man. with his collar torn ort and his shirt loosened over his labouring bosom. It was evident to Caird's practised eye, in that first glimpse, that the man was dying, probably from some afiection of the heart ; but for form's sake he made a brief examinations the patient—an examination 339 Hutchinson’s Story Magazine which fully confirmed his previous lightning diagnosis. Besides the manager and the waiter who had summoned Caird, there was a woman in the room ; and as he looked across to the chair in which she sat. her white chiffon skirts foaming around her feet. Caird recognised his visitor of a few hours’ previously. Instantly he reviewed the situation, and, walking across to her, said in a low voice : " Lady Clinton, this is your husband ? Has he been excited, overwrought, to bring him to this state ? " She looked at him with her childlike eyes, which yet were the eyes of a woman who had known tragedy, and her voice shook as she answered him. , " Yes. When he came in—only half an hour ago—he accused me of shameful things. He asked me if Hugh were my lover, ftnd when I denied it, he struck me. . . " Struck you ? '* “ Yes.” Instinctively she looked down at her arm, where the mark of cruel fingers was plainly to be seen, marring its white- ness. " And then he said a hundred dreadful things : how I had allowed Hugh to buy me jewels in the Bazar in return for—for myself-” " In the Bazar ? But—how did he find that out ? " " I don't know. But he raved at me like a—a madman ; and then, quite sud- denly, he clapped his hands to his heart— so "—she illustrated the gesture—” and fell. . . " Would you be shocked to know that he is dying ? *'• " Shocked ? No. I think ”—she spok* slowly—" I think I should be almost- glad." Half an hour later Sir Peter Clint passed away without regaining consciot ness ; and although the hotel officials were plainly disturbed by the happening, thanks to Caird’s intervention Lady Clinton was treated with the greatest consideration <>n every hand. It was after she had retired, weeping now, to the room which had been placed at her disposal, that Caird received the last shock of the ev ening, and it was one which made an indelible impression on his unusually retentive memory. He had gathered from the girl's »n' coherent speech that in some mysterious way Sir Peter had been cognisant of tM j purchase of the emerald ring ; but it w'3* not until he examined the dead man's sti*» visage for the last time, wondering as b* did so how any father could have given W* j young daughter to this satyr, that he cata* upon a clue to the mystery. And when he did so. he realised, with * strange leap of his pulses, that this death- sudden and tragic as it seemed, had pr^h' ably been tbe means of preventing a W*' long persecution. On the dead man's forehead, half hidd«^ j by the hair which hung, streakily. arouO it, there was a small, oddly shaped scar- And the shape of the scar was that of * miniature horseshoe. 34<> The Flitting of Mr. Maurice Crane By Herbert jenkins J?ut6or of “ 59ind1e,” " V)6e fdgf)t Glub," " Adventures of Swindle," *' Jofin S)ene of Woronto” etc. CAN you keep ver mouth shut ? ” demanded the yard-foreman oi K	the Victoria Depository and Furni- IS^Removing Company, as he looked at E?*®* With the air of one who has already op his mind negatively upon the M ^ you'd lived a matter o' twenty years Mrs. B.. ole sport," replied' Bindle. ^you'd be able to give an oyster ten yards ’undred an’ beat ‘im every time.” L- "til, there ain't got to be no blabbin' this 'ere job," announced the fore- a heavily-built man with a drink- . °lltn face, a bald head, and a soured *«Jnper .

So-long." Bindle always enjoyed getting the last word. II *' Mrs. B.,” remarked Bindle that evening, as he leaned back contentedly after a particularly successful supper of sheep’s heart stuffed with sage-and-onions, in the preparation of which Mrs. Bindle was an adept. *’ Mrs. B., there are them wot appreciates your ole man." Mrs. Bindle sniffed scornfully, and, rising from the table, proceeded to draw out of the oven a rhubarb tart, which she banged upon the table. To Mrs. Bindle emphasis was the salt of life. As Bindle had once remarked, " My missis does everythink as if she meant it. She cooks like giddy-o, talks like a bust drain, an' prays like 'ell." ” What's the matter now ? " she snapped, curiosity overcoming her scorn of all things relating to her spouse. ” I got to go away on a secret service mission," he announced through a mouth- ful of rhubarb tart. " Where art you going ? " she demanded suspiciously. " I ain’t allowed to say," was the response. " It ‘ud be quod if I did. Ole Tawny calls me up this afternoon and says, ' Bindle,' 'e says, ' there ain't a stouter 'eart than yours in the British Empire.' Of course I jest looks down and says, * Bow- wow I * " “ If you want me to listen you'd better talk sense." Mrs. Bindle slashed out a not Ivor V' of pte-crust, tipped it on to the plate that Bindle held towards her, and proceeded ti» dab rhubarb beside it. " Sense it is, Mrs. B.," he said. “ I P3* to go away for two days. Now mind yjU don't get up to-" " Where are you going ? ” demanded Mrs. Bindle. " That’s a secret. Nobody ain’t p*2*' mitted to know.” For some moments Mrs. Bindle eyed hi01 suspiciously. " You're going to the races ! ” The** was grim conviction in her tones. “ Doflt deny it," she added, " I know." " It ain't no use trying to keep thing5 from you, Lizzie," said Bindle with a g1*0, " 'Earty didn’t want me to tell you ; if you've found out, it can’t be 'elp^' can it ? " " Mr. Hearty ?

Mr. Crane looked at Bindle severely. " You don’t know your destination, where you are taking the—er—furniture ? " *' ’Aven't a notion, sir,” was the re- sponse. " I got to ’phone up the office soon as we're loaded up, then I’ll ear." Mr. Crane nodded approvingly. ” The neighbours,” began Mr. Crane. Again he paused. He was obviously ner- vous. " You leave them to me, sir.” said Bindle confidentially. " 1 can tell the tale.” “ And you understand." said Mr. Crane, putting his hand in his pocket and jingling his money seductively. " When the V.D. gets a job like this ere, sir, they always sends me. ' Joe Bindle/ says the manager to me yesterday after- noon, ' if it wasn't for you,' 'e says, ' Gawd knows wot would ‘ave 'appened to the British Empire.’ You see, sir," he con- tinued, "I’m married myself," and be winked knowingly. Mr. Crane started violently. “ You—I—what do you mean ? " he demanded, fear and suspicion in his eyes. " Don’t you worry, sir, you jest leave it all to me. I'll see you through, safe as 'ouses." "I'm going down by tram to-" be- gan Mr. Crane—and again he hesitated—" to where you're coming to,” he concluded. ” There ain't no trains runrtln' to where I’m goin'." murmured Bindle with mourn- ful conviction. " An' now 111 get on with the job, sir, if you please "; and with that he turned and walked to the door and went out. For some time Mr. Crane watched thu work of dismantling his home. His early 3-13 Hutchinson’s Story Magazine inclination to interfere Bindle had dis- couraged. " Now, you jest set down an’ watch, sir,” he had said, " or you'll get them pretty duds o' yours all messed up, an’ wot'll she say then ? " Soon after ten Mr. Crane departed, hav- ing given explicit instructions to Bindle not to divulge a secret with which he was unacquainted. Mr. Crane did not seem to sec the inconsistency of the request. Contrary to Bindle's expectations and tho3e of Mr. Crane, the neighbours evinced no very particular interest as to where the furniture from Number 18 was going. They gazed from behind their curtains and from their front doors, according to the state of their presentibility; but nothing more. A few of the tradespeople from time to time took up strong strategical f&sitions, and watched the proceedings. The most persistent of these itinerants was a telegraph-girl, who seemed to have the whole morning before her. A perky, diminutive little creature with a scrap of fair hair tied behind with a pink ribbon, she stood drinking in the scene, her jaws moving continuously in the process of chewing gum. At length, as if to assure herself of the correctness of her own deduc- tions, she turned to Bindle as he was returning to the house. " Moving ? " she inquired indifferently, nodding her head in the direction of the house. " No, darling, were doin' it to make our 'air grow. We puts everythink in the van. then we takes it all back into the 'ouse again, and we feels better. Gives us a sort of appetite for supper." " Funny, ain’t you ? " she retorted, quite unmoved, as she continued her chewing. At noon Bindle and his mates knocked oft for dinner, locking the doors of the v&us and also of the house. At one o'clock thoy were back again. As Bindle turned into the garden he caught sight of a lady standing at the front door. She was a little slip of a thing, brown hair, brown eyes, brown dresa. with very red lips and an almont childish ex- pression of countenance. Her hands were trembling violently, and her large brown eyes looked as if they would start front ber head. As Bindle approached she took step towards him. “ What—what are you doing with furniture ? " she cried in an unsteady voice " Your furniture, mum ? ’’ repeated Bind** i as if he were not quite sure that he heard aright. “ You mustn't take it away, oh, y°° mustn't 1 " She clasped her trembling hands together and looked at him beseechingly.

" But—but whose orders ? " " Fat little chap 'e was, mum. jewels all over 'im, an’ black air smarmed down, enough to cause a grea** shortage."

Herbert Jenkins After infinite labour and much grumbling and blowing on the part of the men, the cabinet was planted in the dining-room opposite the fireplace. “ That finishes the dining-room," mur- mured Bindle. " Now. then, you ole war- riors," he called after the men as they trooped out of the room, " put your backs into it, an' you shall 'ave a drink of milk and a bun if you're good boys Ah ! 'ere you are. sir," as Mr. Crane bustled into the house. " So you got here safely," he inquired, still anxious and furtive. *' No one-” he paused. " No one said nothink, sir, nor asked nothink.” “ You are quite sure.” “ Sure as sure, sir," said Bindle reassur- ingly. " You were not followed," persisted Mr. Crane. ” Nothink followed us along the road, sir, an' 1 didn't 'ear an aeroplane.” Mr. Crane drew a deep sigh of relief. ” We’ve got the dra win'-room an' the dinin’-room done, sir, an’ now we’ll get on with the other rooms.” Mr. Crane looked about him, apparently pleasantly surprised at the progress that had been made during the last three houns. ” There’s a—er—er—a lady coming." he said. " You had—cr—better call me.” ” Right-o. sir,” said Bindle cheerfully, as he walked down the passage towards the door, whistling, " My Wife won't let me.” Mr. Crane gazed after him with a look of doubt on his face. A few minutes later Bindle was back in the dining-room examining the oak cabinet, apparently to see that it had suffered no damage. ” Where’s Mr. Crane ? ” Bindle span round on his heel and stood regarding a ilambuoyautly-dr eased girl with pufly feature*, hill hips, and startling yellow hair. Her manner was supercilious, and her diction that of Bow. “ 'E was 'ere a moment ago. mum, or miss,” said Bindle, when he had taken stock of the stranger. " Did you want 'im ? " 345 Hutchinson’s Story Magazine " Tell him I’m here," said the girl, as she proceeded to peel off her gloves. Bindle noticed a broad circle of gold upon the third finger of her left hand. He winked knowingly at a portrait of a pale, narrow-headed man, looking like a half- ripe banana. " Very good, miss—mum. I mean. Who shall I say ? " Bindle gave a covert glance in the direction of the oak cabinet. " Mrs. Crane,” she replied indifferently. “ Right-o, miss. I'll go an' fetch ’im.” As he turned towards the door Mr. Crane entered; at the sight of the girl his cus- tomary nervousness seemed to increase. He fluttered across to her with a forced, rather sickly smile, " The drawing-room is quite ready, my dear," he said, looking at her anxiously, as if uncertain of her mood. " That'll have to be moved,” she an- nounced, pointing to the cabinet, and without any attempt at greeting, by which Bindle decided in his own mind that they had parted only a short time before. " Moved, my dear ? " interrogated Mr. Crane. " I don't like it. It’s hideous. You’ll have to sell it.” “ I—er-” began Mr. Crane. “ What’s inside, shelves ? '* she de- manded. “ It’s—er—there’s nothing inside," said Mr. Crane. “ It’s just an ornament,” " Ornament 1 " she cried scornfully, going over to it and turning the handle. ’• Where’s the key? " she demanded over her shoulder. The key ought to be in it,” said Mr. Crane, turning and looking interrogatingly at Bindle. " I got the key, sir,” said Bindle, rum- maging in his trousers pocket. " I took it out when we was bringin' it in, for fear it might catch up against somethink.” With a grin he handed the key to the girl, who proceeded to insert it in the lock. Indolently and indifferently she opened the right-hand door, then with a cry started back. Mr. Crane turned to see the cause of the cry. His eyes became fixed, almost bulging out of his head. ■' Good morning, Maurice.” Out of the oak cabinet stepped tW diminutive form of the real Mrs. Crar>e- perfectly self-possessed and smiling. The effect of the greeting upon Mr Crane was curious. His hands fell to W* sides, his jaw dropped, and his thick, Pur5^ lips gaped. His face became an aaWfJ colour, and in his eyes was terror, as gazed at the neat and self-possessed 6g°& 1 of his wife.

Bindle’s air, as he open tl»e door, was so deter- ijj. c after a momentary hesitation, passed through it into the kitchen, as if compelled by sheer force of personality. Carefully closing the door, Bindle stood before it facing his victim. " Now, look 'ere, sir," he said. " I met some queer coves in my time, coves wot wasn't over particular wot they did ; but you're about the damnedest and dirtiest tyke I ever see without a muzzle **; he paused, as if to give Mr. Crane an oppor- tunity of resenting or denying the charge. As he did neither, Bindle continued : " I ain't been brought up in a young ladies' school, an’ I seen some pretty dirty things done by men an’ women an’ ‘orses ; but I’m blowed if this ain’t the dirtiest I ever 'eard of." Again he paused and looked at Mr. Crane, who stood clutching with both hands the corner of the kitchen table, as if unable to support himself with his own legs. His face was a ghastly grey, his lips dry, and in his eyes was fear. " I ’card all about it from your missus, 'ow you got ’er to go away to see ‘er mother while you nipped orf with the sticks an' that there bit o' fluff wot jest got it in the neck. I brought ’er down in that there black cupboard o’ yours—your missus, I mean. Such goin's-on didn't ought to be allowed. Now. you can lose me my job by reportin’ me. or you can 'ave it out in the back-yard man to man. Which is it to be ? ” Bindle looked eagerly at the quaking figure before him. Twice Mr. Crane swal- lowed noisily. He made several ineffectual efforts to moisten his lips. Finally he blinked his eyes ; but no sound came from him. "If you could make it the back-yard. I'd be kind o' grateful," said Bindle. " I want to 'it you badly ; but I can't do it while you looks like that. You're biggcr'n wot I am. an' you ain't so old. an’ I wouldn’t mind betting two to one you ain’t got various veins in yer legs, so I'm givin’ away a lot of things besides weight. Now. do take orf yer coat," he sakl per- suasively. And then Mr. Crane did a strange thing. His knees seemed slowly to double up beneath him, and he sank down, still clutching with both hands the edge of the 347 Hutchinson’s Story Magazine table. Burying his face in his arms, he sobbed the hard, dry sobs of a man who is alone with his soul. “ Well, I’m blowed,” muttered Bindle, his eyes upon the light patch on the back of Mr. Crane’s head. " If this ain't It " ; and he walked over to the table and stood gazing down at the sobbing man, as if be had been some new and strange animal. " Please leave us now," said a quiet voice behind him. He turned swiftly to find Mrs. Crane standing just inside the kitchen door, a new light in her eyes. " Get the furniture back in the van, please ; I	will settle up everything with your em- ployers. You have been very, very kind to me. I shall never forget it. I will thank yoxi later,” and she looked up into Bindle’s face with a tremulous little smile. A moment later Bindle was blowing his nose violently in the passage. “ Well, I’m blowed," he muttered, as he made his way into the dining-room. “ Jest fancy *er wantin’ ’im back, an’ me gettin’ mixed up in—'ere, you ole repro- bates," he shouted out of the window, “ we got to load up again. Now, look slippy'. Been a little family scrap ’ere," he said a moment later, by way of explana- tion, to the men as they trooped into the room. '* Now, then, Charlie Chaplin," this to a large man enveloped in a voluminous pair of trousers, " up Guards an' at 'em." The men grinned, they had a fairly clear idea of what had taken place.

Mrs. Bindle proceeded to splosh Irish stow from a saucepan into a large, buff-coloured pie- diah.

AYRES i WHEN young Fumival proposed to Marion Carver, all classes of society in the little town wherein they both resided held its breath in sheer and profound amazement. Young Furnival was a gentleman ; his father had been a well-to-do solicitor, and lie lived with his mother and two sisters in one of the best houses in one of the best parts of the little snobbish surburban town wherein Mary Carver's father kept a small grocer's shop. It was an unpretentious shop, and Carver was an unpretentious man : he served be- hind the bacon counter himself in a white apron, and his wife sat in the cashier's desk. Mary was their only child, and she had been—what her father proudly called “ educated " ; which meant that he had sent her to a school which was really more expensive than he could afford, and that she could play the piano better than of young Furnival'a sisters, and sing songs in a very charming mezzo that o shone every other amateur in the towfl- ^ Old Carver and his wife adored her. they had spoken the truth, they *°*f, probably have said that it was a ne'Cl<7 ending wonder to them how they c*meg5t have such a daughter ; she was the sacred thing in their lives ; they never allow her in the shop, and it ws* ^ dream of her father’s life to be ab e i0 save enough money to enable move away from the shop premises, live—as he called it—** private.” ^ The shop, which he recognised a* ^ environment for himself and his ^ considered degradation for Marion*^, secret ambition was that she should a gentleman.	. toid ** She's fit to marry a duke," he 1 his wife so many limes that she. - soul, had firmly grown to believe tha* 350 Ruby M.

Young Furnival was a Territorial, and* his regiment was called up within the first forty-eight hours. His mother wept and wrung her hands, even while in the war she saw a merciful providence intervening to save her son from the clutches of " that girl." There was no more talk of an early wed- ding ; old Carver shook his head over the bacon counter, and wondered how soon prices would begin to soar. He was terribly proud of his future son- in-law in the uniform of a full-blown lieu- tenant ; in his heart he wished he himself had a son to send swaggering off against the enemy; he told his daughter that her tears were sinful, and that she ought to be glad that she could send her man to fight for his country. She looked up at him with wet, indig- nant eyes. " And supposing lie’s killed ? " she asked tragically. Old Carver stared ; such a possibility had not occurred to him ; the excitement and glamour of the thing had run away with his imagination ; he could only see victory, and the enemy slain in his thou- sands. '■ Killed ! he won't be killed,'' he an- swered, speaking very loudly as if to carry conviction, but Marion only wept the more. She clung round young Furnival's neck in the little dark sitting-room behind the shop, almost speechless with grief. “ You'll come back—promise me ! pro- mise me ! " she wailed, and his eyes were almost as wet as hers, as he kissed her and said huskily that of course he should come back. He had almost to tear himsell from her in the end, and then for a time the sun went out of Marion's world ; for she loved him sincerely, and love had sharpened her instinctive dread. When the first terrible casualty list came out she knew she had cxpected to sec his 35* ■*. Hutchinson’s Story Magazine name amongst those hundreds ; when she found it was not there, she shivered, and braced herself ior the uncertainty of wait- ing again. Then after some weeks came a ray of hope which was yet a fresh kind of despair : Fumival was going to India. He dashed homo for a week-end leave to say good- bye ; already he seemed to have grown more manly and developed ; he was light- hearted, too, and a little impatient at Marion’s tears. 41 But, darling—it'a better than France, surely 1 " he protested. " I know, I know-" she sobbed. " But you'll be away so long I It may be years before I see you again. You'll forget all about me." He silenced the words with passionate kisses; he would never forget her, he de- clared ; she was the only woman in the world for him ; if they did not meet again for twenty years he should love her just as well as he did now. And it was four years before they met again ; four years, during which a great many things happened—the most import- ant being that old Carver made a fortune. It was partly luck, and partly profiteer- ing. In the first place, a large piece of derelict land which he had once bought as a bad speculation, and which had been the white elephant of his life, was purchased by the Government for an exorbitant sum, on account of its nearness both to a railway and the river; and from that moment his luck never turned back—he went on from success to success, piling up the money, and growing fatter and more self-important, while other people— amongst them young Furnival's mother and sisters—went down the scale. Their moderate income, which had been sufficient before the war, was barely enough now to keep them in decency, and there was no possibility of increasing it. The girl9 tried to get posts, but their in- competence debarred them even from Government offices; things were very sadly indeed in that best house in the best part of the town, and though once or twice Marion Carver made timid overtures to them, she was coldly repulsed ; their pride could not bear that she should see the® in their broken fortunes: they hated he* and her parents for their new affluence. Old Carver had left the shop after all. and gone to live " private " in a house not many yards away from the Furnivals’ - 1 did up his new abode in lavish style, without much taste ; he fitted every 'v‘°' dow with a flower-bax, and every box flaming geraniums and white daisies; & I painted the gates of the carriagc-drt*® bright green, and bought a laadaoMH . from one of his customers who could 1 longer afford to run it.

Old Carver entertained them royally. The best is only just good enough for aVc men," so he said. '* Come any time y°u like—all of you ! always sure of a Welcome." Several of them fell in love with Marion, though she liked their attentions, she ^ver once swerved from her devotion to J^ttng Furnival ; he was the man for her, only man in her world. Even when Donald Anstey, who had had varsity education, and whose father was healthy manufacturer in the north, went on his knees to her to marry she shook her head.

Marion, who under- nothing of the conditions under flT^-h he was lining, fretted, and put it all ItT11 to changed affections ; lor a fort- r*ht she never wrote to him at all as re- ■	but she cried he reel t to sleep night, and was tlie most miserable o	the world.

Her loss broke old Carver's heart, and turned him from a generous, hearty old man into a grim, unsympathetic snob. He began to close his hospitable doors and hoard his money ; he was less affec- tionate to Marion; and, worried about young Furnival and grieved about her mother, the girl hardly knew how to bear herself. Anstey saw his opportunity, and made the most of it; he dropped the role of lover, and constituted himself her friend ; he was always there, always cheerful and willing to help and comfort; it was the most natural thing in the world that she should begin to find him indispensable to her life, he was the one bright spot in a world that seemed suddenly to have grown sunless. He encouraged her to speak to him about Jim Furnival ; he was careful never to say a word against him, and to be always kind and hopeful; he manufactured excuses for his silences and brief letters, when in his heart he did not believe there were any excuses to be made ; he thought—and hoped—that Furnival was getting tired of his engagement. It was a shock, therefore, when one day a wire came, announcing that Jim was on his way home—ill 1 Marion's spirits went up like rockets : the colour came back to her cheeks and the light to her eyes ; she thanked Anstey for his kindness to her, but let him see that she no longer required him ; she could comfort herself easily enough now with- out his assistance she found hundreds of excuses for her lover's changed manner— it was due to illness I she ought to have known that it was 1—her first romantic love for him came surging back to her heart—she counted the days till they should meet. The years of anxiety and pain were ended —he was coming home safely alter all. And he came home safely—that L*. he came home whole, and without a wound, but with his health broken by tropical suns and tropical lever*. 353 i Hutchinson’s Story Magazine " A wrcck, that's what he is," old Carver said bluntly to his daughter. " I should hardly have known him, and that’s a fact." The same thought was in Marion's heart; all young Furnival’s smartness and cheeri- ness seemed to have gone; he was thin and shrunken with fever ; always tired, and inclined to be irritable. After a great struggle he got a diminu- tive pension from an ungrateful country, and was discharged as unfit for further service. He was unfit for anything else as well, for the time being, at all events ; work of any sort was beyond him for many months, so the doctors said ; he was too sick a dog to trouble himself about anything. It was winter when he came back to England, and after the heat of India he found the cold intolerable ; he crouched over the fire most of the day, shivering and cursing his inability to rouse himself. Perhaps it was only natural that, after the first few days, Marion Carver should get tired of crouching over the fire with him ; she was strong and healthy, and had expanded greatly in the sunshine of her father's wealth. She was invited out constantly, and though as a rule young Fumi%’al was in- cluded in the invitations, it was seldom that he could accept. “ but you go," he urged. " Of course you must go ! I don’t want you to be tied to me all day. I shall be better when the warm weather comes.” So Marion went, and young Anstey, who could dance and skate and drive a car and do most of the things expected of an up- to-date man, generally went with her. He was a strong, strapping fellow, and a bit of a wangler (at any rate, so far he had managed to hold down a home job), and in her heart Mai ion unconsciously began to compare him with Jim Furnival— to the latter's disadvantage. She wondered what life would be like were she married to an invalid, and had to spend most of her time nursing him ; she had not had much pleasure out of her engagement; its first glow and rapture had been cut short by the war, and it had never been resumed. Even now that her circumstances had changed, Furnival's people made A® 1 friendly overtures to her ; she had cel" tainly been to tea once or twice, but K* such an air of frigidity that she had bod1 thankful to get away from the house. She knew that they condemned her be- cause she did not wish to spend every moment of her time with her fianc£, I the knowledge drove her to defiance ; 'vh*1 did she care what they thought ? One night old Carver broached the sub- ject of marriage to her. " What about setting up a house of y00* own ? " he asked. Marion flushed. “ How can we ? what can we marry on ?

She was really terribly unhappy, without knowing in the very least what made her so. " I shall choose my own friends." Jim's face hardened. " You will not—if you are going to marry me," he said flintily. She laughed at that. “It does not seem as if I shall ever have the chance of marrying you," she said. He took the knock as it was meant. " You mean that I am not in a position to marry, and that Anstey is,” he said with deadly calm. Her brown eyes were misty with tears, but anger had her in its grip. " Yes, that is what I do mean,” she said, but her thoughts went back with unkind vividness to the little dark sitting-room behind the shop in the High Street where he had first kissed her, and the memory hurt insufferably. " Then Anstey is more than welcome to you.” was all Jim Fumival answered, and Marion took off her ring, and laid it down on the table between them. There was a moment's silence, then she said hoarsely: " I suppose this is what you have bwn wanting, ever since you came home,” and Jim laughed as he answered drearily that perhaps it was. She went away then, and he stood and listened to her retreating steps feeling as if a great door had slammed-to across the whole world, shutting them one on either side. . . It was all over the town the next morn- ing that Marion Carver had broken her engagement with young Fumival; people who, four years ago, had held up amazed hands because young Fumival had stooped to Marion, now wagged their heads and said they were not surprised. ” He was no match for her," they said. *' Ruined in health, and wiUiout a shilling to his name 1 " It was the tip oi the scale indeed 1 Every one guessed Uiat Anstey was the cause of the final rupture, and in a way they were right. He went round to see Marion as soon as the rumour rcached him ; she was crossing the hall when he was admitted, and re- 355 Hutchinson’s Story Magazine gardless of the servant, he went up to her and caught her hand. " Marion ! is it true ? " " Is what true ? " She knew quite well what he meant, but she shrank from ad- mitting it to herself. " That you have broken your engage- ment. I met Furnival, and he said it was true, but I could not believe it—I had to come to you." She drew a hard breath, looking away from him, then— " Yes, it's quite true," she said expres- sionlessly.	( " Then—then is there . . . may I ... oh Marion, does it mean . . .** She broke away from him. “ Oh, not now 1 not now I I can't bear it." She went to her room and locked herself in ; she could not understand her own emo- tions ; she had wished to be free, and now that she had got her freedom, she was more unhappy than ever in her life be- fore. *' If I could only forget—if I could only forget." she kept telling herself, but she knew that the first happy memories of her engagement, the stolen meetings, and the kisses in the little dark room behind the shop, were all things which could ne^er be forgotten. When—a week later—Anstey pressed her for an answer, she said yes. Old Carver was delighted ; he gave a cham- pagne dinner to celebrate the occasion ; he made a speech in which he said it was one of the happiest moments of his life. He looked at his daughter guiltily as he said it, and she winced as if he had hurt her ; for both their thoughts had gone hick to the day of her engagement to Jim Furnival. and the bottle of indifferent port that had been opened and drunk in the little dark room behind the shop to cele- brate their happiness, when old Carver had said just the same things, only with greater sincerity. Oh, why could not things last! she won- dered hopelessly ; why must illness and poverty step in and spoil the beauty of romance I Young Anstey took her home to his people ; they made a great fuss of her. and did all they could to make her happy* but in spite of everything she was miser- able. Though she tried hard to forget Jit® Furnival, her thoughts were always with him ; she was unutterably relieved when her visit came to an end and she went back home again. She drove past the Furnivals’ house of> her way from the station, and she peered up at its windows with a racing pulse an<* quickly beating heart, j ust as she had dofl® in the old days before Jim and she we*® anything to one another. Where was he now ? what was he do- ing ? It seemed impossible that he had not come to meet her on her return, th®*- there was not the pleasure of his delight to look forward to, at seeing her again. It was not until the next morning that she heard what had happened to him- that three days ago, while crossing tW High Street, he had been knocked do*0 by an army lorry, and was lying between life and death in hospital. One of the servants told her. and for * moment it seemed as if ail the world h*" fallen away from her into utter blackfle*5 and chaos, as she stood listening.	^ 1 Between life and death! that mca” death of course I he would die. and would never see him again ! never tell &* that already she had repented—that a.l**'* she had loved him,	^ Her first impulse was to go to him. reason checked her ; she had no go now—they would not let her see if she went; she did not even dare to^at on his mother and sisters; she knew if they had hated her before, they 01 ^ hate her a thousand times more °°* what she had done.	lurt&C’ She wandered restlessly about the she could settle to nothing : she was » ^ to question her father: afraid I1?3 should guess something of the terror anguish of her heart.

" I wish death was the worst we could promise him," he said sadly. She raised terrified eyes. " Oh, what do you mean ? " He told her as gently as he could : there had been injuries to the head, and if young Furnival lived, it was possible that he might never know any one or anything again. She stared at him, white as death. *' You mean—madness ! " she gasped. He did not answer, but his silence was eloquent. " And there is no hope—none ? ” she asked with stiff lips. " There is a chance.” he admitted re- luctantly—■*' a very slender chance. An operation, of couree. but it is dangerous, and most costly ; his mother has not tho money, but I doubt if she would consent." The colour surged back to Marion's face. " We have plenty; my father is a rich man; I will give anything—my last penny . . /' He shook his head sadly. ** I am afraid after what has happened, his people would not acccpt help from you,'* he said compassionately. " They are very proud and they cannot easily forgive." " But they must ! I will make them 1 Oh! surely any chance, no matter how dangerous, is better than letting him dio, or live on as ... as you say 1 " The doctor smiled faintly. •' Perhaps if you were to see hla mother . . ." he said. Marion fled back home ; there was a letter in Anstey's writing waiting for her, but she took no notice of it; she sought her father ; she poured out her story in -»n incoherent jumble. " I love him—we must save him ! Ob, father, with all your money . . He tried to repulse her. but he would not meet her eyes. “ Where is your pride ? ” he asked harshly. " You—engaged to another man . . /* *• I never loved him ! it was always Jim 1 always ! Oh, you haven't forgotten how proud and pleased you were about it ?— Hutchinson’s Story Magazine how pleased mother was ! Oh, if you ever cared for me at all . . " She was on her knees beside him, sobbing. Old Carver tried to raise her. " You're excited—you don't know what you're talking about. You’ve done with Jim—you told him so," but his voice was less confident. Marion looked up. " Yes, I told him so—but it was a lie ! If he dies. I've done with everything, for all my life. Oh. if we could only go back to tlie old days ; we were happy then—in the little shop—and mother was here . . .'* She broke down, and for a moment there was silence ; then old Carver put an arm round her. " I'm a rich man,” he said brokenly. " Any money you want—it’s vours ! take it, my dear—and . . . and I hope the boy recovers." Marion went to Jim’s mother ; she went full of eagerness and hope, but the chill formality of the house damped her spirits ; the old fear and sense of unwantedness almost overcame her as she was admitted ; she shook in every limb as she crossed the hall to the shabby drawing-room. Mrs. Furnival was there to receive her— aged, poor woman, by many hours of anxiety since last they met—and for a moment Marion's courage failed her; then, with sudden impulse, she held out her shaking hands. " Oh, forgive me—forgive me ! I loved him always—I love him now.” For an instant she thought she was to bo repulsed, then the hard, worn face of the woman who was Jim's mother softened and broke, and the next moment they were crying in each other’s arms. . . . Presently Marion told her of her plans —of what the doctor had said, and of what her father had promised. " And even if the chance is so small, you will take it, won't you ? " she pleaded. " Somehow I feel that he will get well— that it will be all right ; oh, he must I he must I In the end she prevailed ; better be deud, than to live on as the doctors said he must live, if the chance was not taken. It was arranged that the operation should be done, and at once—every hour lessened his chances. ** Even if he lives and the operation «s successful, he may be an invalid for tbe rest of his life,” his mother said, hiding her face. Marion laughed. *' What does it matter ? He will have you and ine to love him and care for him, she said. . . . There followed days of cruel anxiety; days when hope hung in the balance, and Marion's heart almost stopped beating with dread. She had not been allowed to see Jim" nobody but nurses and doctors were ad- mitted. and the time seemed to drag °n leaden feet. There was one nurse whom Marion al' ways saw when she called at the hosp*^ —a young woman with a sweet, lovabl® face, who was always cheery and kint- al ways hopeful and encouraging. *’ Live ! oh. I am sure he will ! and b* quite himself.” she said once positively- " I know the doctors still fear for him. b-* somehow 1 know he will be all right."

Ayres Marion closed her eyes ; it would soon be over if she could just get one little spark of courage; then . . . Some one was holding her hands, calling to her— ” Marion—Marion ...” She opened her eyes with a stifled shriek ; she was sobbing convulsively. Her father was bending over her, his face pale with alarm. " Oh daddy ! oh daddy ! ” She clung to him as she had done years ago when sh© was a child down at the little shop in the High Street. Old Carver soothed her gently. " There 1 there ! dreaming, that's what it is 1 1 was passing your door and heard you crying ! It's only a dream 1 nothin;* to be afraid of.” ” A dream ! " she sat up with a gasp , there was no river, no grey night t she was at home in her own bedroom. A dream ! thank God 1 only a dream !— but—how much of it ? she broke out into eager questioning. ” Jim 1 i9 it true that he’s been hurt— or did I dream it ? ” Mr. Carver frowned. ” What's it to do with yon ?—you've done with him." Manon almost laughed. " Done with him 1 I love him 1 If hell forgive me and take me back. I shall be the happiest girl in the world.” She could get no more out of him : she was still dreaming, he told her curtly : in the morning perhaps she would be sensible. He went away, and Manon lay awake all night, afraid to sleep any more. As soon as it was light she got rtp and wrote to young Anstey ; she was grieved to hurt him, she wrote, but she could not marry him. ** All my life I have only loved one man," she wrote. ” 1 love him still . . At breakfast time there was an angry scene with her fatlier, but she did not care. ” If Jim won't have me. I shall never marry." she said firmly. He stormed at her in vain. ” You'll not have a penny of my money.'* ** I don't want it,” Manon said. Later, she went up to Mrs Fumival'* ; Hutchinson’s Story Magazine the old fear and nervousness was upon her as she waited at the door ; she flushed crimson when one of Jim's sisters opened it to her. " Oh—could I see your mother ? ” she faltered. The girl's face hardened. " Mother never wishes to see you again,” she said. Marion turned away, a little lump in her throat ; two parts of her dream had been but a dream then—her father's generosity, and Mrs. Furnival's forgive- ness ; she was afraid to hope that all the rest might prove to be a dream too. She went to the hospital in dread—she waited in a little room while somebody fetched the Sister. "If she is young and pretty," Marion told herself wildly. “ I shall die." The door opened behind her ; a stout, grey-liaired little woman entered. *' You have come to enquire about Mr. Furnival ? " she asked kindly. " Yes." Marion could hardly speak. " I—I . . oh, is it true that he is very badly injured ? " " Not a bit," came the crisp reply. " I really don't know how such rumours get about ; a few bruises, that’s all, and a shaking-" Marion was white to the lips. *' And he's not . . . not hurt—in the bead ? " she whispered. The Sister smiled kindly. " He’s not hurt anywhere specifically." she said. " A few bruises, as I told you— it was a wonderful escape.” She saw the relief in the girl's eyes. ” Perhaps you would like to see him,” she said kindly. " Might I 1 oh, if only I oould ! " *’ Certainly you may ; he’s in a room by himself—shall I tell him you are here ? " Oh no ; if I might just go in . . She hardly knew what she was doing as she followed the little grev-haired woma* j upstairs ; she felt that she had gone bli°^ when at last she stood in the room wW* Jim lay, and heard the door close behind her There was a moment’s silence, then— " Marion !

" Oh, forgive me—I've been so wretched —I love you ; I've always loved you . • • 1 " Marion ! ” It was a cry of gladnes* now. as he raised himself frpm the pill0* and took her into his arms.

" Also, I have business to attend to here," and I pointed to our wounded men. The old fellow nodded, and went to speak to the captains of his force, doubtless as to the pursuit of the enemy, for presently I saw a company spring forward on their tracks. Then, assisted by Hans and the remaining Zulus, of whom one was Goroko. I turned to attend to our own people. The task proved lighter than I expected, since the badly injured man was dead or dying, and the hurts of the two others were in their legs, and «^jmparatively slight, such as Goroko could doctor in his own native fashion.

Hans also returned thanks In his own fashion, after he had filled himself, not before, and lit his corn-cob pipe. But Robertson made no remark; indeed, when he had satisfied his natural cravings, he rose and, walking a few paces forward, stood staring at the cleft in the mountain difl into which he had seen the litter vanish that bore his daughter to some fate unknown. Even the great fight that we had sought, and tho izm Th j »toty ha* b«ca abbreviated lot aciial puiikjc*. 361 Hutchinson’s Story Magazine victory we had won against overpowering odds, did not appear to impress him. He only glared at the mountain, into the heart of which Inez had been raped away, and shook his fist. Since she was gone, all else went for nothing, so much so that he did not offer to assist with the wounded Zulus or show curiosity about the strange old man by whom we had been rescued. " The Great Medicine, Baas," said Hans, in his sententious way, ” is even more powerful than I thought. Not only has it brought us safely through the fighting and without a scratch, lor those Zulus there do not matter, and there will be less cooking now that they are gone ; it has also brought down your reverend father, the Predikant, from the Place of Fires in Heaven, some- what changed from what I remember him, it is true, but still without doubt the same.

Having seated himself upon the little wall that we had built up, he contemplated us, stroking his beautiful white beard, then said, addressing me, “ Of a certainty you should be proud, who with a few have defeated so many. Still, had I not been ordered to come at speed, I think tliat now you would have been as those are," and he looked towards the dead Zulus, who were laid out at a distance like men asleep, while their com- panions sought for a place to bury them. " Ordered by whom ? ” I asked. ** There is only one who can order,” he answered, with mild astonishment, ** She- who-Commands "—” She-who-is-Everlast- ing." It occurred to me that this must be some Arabic idiom for the Eternal Feminine, but 1 only looked vague, and said. “It would appear that there arc some whom this exalted, everlasting She cannot command ; those who attacked us, those who have fled away yonder.” and I waved « my hand towards the mountain. ” No command is absolute ; in ever* country there are rebels, even, as I hav« heard, in Heaven above us.

The next hour or so was occupied in the "rfy®* the dead Zulus, a ceremony in hich I took no part beyond standing up raising my hat as they were borne *aV. for it is best to leave natives alone these occasions. Indeed, presently I lay reflecting that strangely enough there . ^u*,®d to be something in old Zikali's tale a Wonderful white Queen who lived in a ^““tain fastness, since there was the T^ntain as he had drawn it on the ashes, ^ the servants of that Queen, who ap- .r**ently had knowledge of our coming, J2***'ed in the nick of time to rescue us j one of the tightest fixes in which ever ^®und myself. Moreover, the antique , - CQQrtcous individual called Uillali of her as ” She-who-is-Everlasting.” I What the deuce could he mean by that, Ol^^dered ? I*robably that she was very and therefore disagreeable to look on. I confessed to m^-self would be a »L PP°intment. And how did she know ^ *c were coming ? I could not guess. when I asked Robertson, he merely jy. *'K£ed his shoulders and intimate<l that no interest in the matter *	truth is, that nothing moved the man.

Doubtless, now that the chains of drink had fallen off him. the instincts and the blood of the dour old Covenanters from whom he was descended were asserting themselves. In a way this was a good thing, though for some time past I had feared lest it should end in his going mad. and certainly, as a companion, he was more cheerful in his unrcgenerate days. Abandoning speculation as useless, and taking my chance of being murdered where I lay, for after all Billali's followers were singularly like the men with whom we had been fighting, and. for aught I knew, might be animated by identical objects, I just went to sleep, as I can do at any time, to walifc up an hour or so later feeling wonderfully refreshed. Hans, who when I closed my eyes was already slumbering at my feet, curled up bke a dog on a spot where the sun struck hotly, roused me by saying, " Awake. Baas, they are here ! ” I sprang up, snatching at my rifle, for I thought that he meant that we were being attacked again, to see Billali advancing at the head of a train of four litters made of bamboo, with grass mats for curtains and coverings, each of which was carried by stalwart Amaliaggers, as I supposed that they must be. Two of these, the finest, he indicated were for Robertson and myself, and the two ptherf for the wounded. Ura- Blopogaas and the remaining Zulus evidently were expected to walk, as was Hans. " How did you make these 90 quickly ? " I asked, surveying their elegant and indeed artistic workmanship.” ” We did not make them. Watcher-by- Night; we brought them with us folded up. Shc-wlio-Oommands looked in her Rta* and said that four would be needed, beside* my own, which is yonder, two for white lords and two for wounded black men. which you see is the number required.” " Ye*.” I answered vaguely, marvelling what kind of a glass it was that gave the lady this information. Before I could inquire upon tbe point. Billali added. “ You will be glad to learn that my men 363 Hutchinson’s Story Magazine caught some of those rebels who dared to attack you, eight or ten of them who had been hurt by your missiles or axe-cuts, and put them to death in the propet fashion, yes, quite the proper fashion," and he smiled a little. " The rest had gone too far, where it would have been dangerous to follow them among the rocks. Enter now. my lord Watcher-by-Night. for the road ia steep, and if we would reach the place where She-who-Commands is camped in the ancient holy city before the moon sinks behind the cliffs to-night, we must travel fast." So, having explained matters to Robert- son and Umalopogaas, who announced that nothing would induce him to be carried like an old woman or a corpse upon a shield, and seen that the hurt Zulus were com- fortably accommodated, Robertson and I got into our litters, which proved to be delightfully easy and restful. Then our gear having been collected by the hook- nosed bearers to whom we were obliged to trust it. though we kept with us our rifles and a certain amount of ammunition, we started. First went a number of Billali's spearmen, then came the litters with the wounded, alongside of which Umslopogaas and his three uninjured Zulus stalked or trotted; then another litter containing Billali; then my own, by which ran Hans, and Robertson's; and lastly the rest of the Amahagger and the relief bearers. " I see now, Baas," said Hans, thrusting his head between my curtains, ** that yonder Whitebeard cannot be your reverend father, the Predikant, after all." " Why not ? " I asked, though the thing was fairly obvious. *' Because, Baas, if he were, he would not have left Hans, of whom he always thought so well, to run in the sun like a dog, while he and others travel in carriages like great white ladies." " You had better save your breath instead of talking nonsense, Hans.” 1 said, ** sincc I believe that you have a long way to go.” fn fact it proved to be a very long way indeed, especially as after we began to breast the mountain we must travel slowly. We started about ten o'clock in the morning, for the fight, which after all did not take long, had, it will be remembered* begun shortly after dawn, and it was three in the afternoon before we reached base of the towering cliff which I hav« mentioned. Here, at the foot of a curie”15 isolated column of rock, on which I 't3S destined to see a strange sight in the aft** days, we halted and ate of the remain^# ” food which we had brought with us, whflj the Amahagger consumed their own, whic* seemed to consist largely of curdled nU®! such as the Zulus call.jni.-Js. and lump*** a kind of bread. I noted that they vVCt*t " very curious people, who fed in silence. on whose handsome, soiemn iaces one saw a smile.

Then we stopped talking, for the climb took all our breath. At length we came to the cliff face, where, to all appearance, our journey must end. Suddenly, however, out of the blind black wall in front of us started the apparition of a tall man armed with a great spear and wearing a white robe, who challenged us hoarsely. Yes, suddenly he stood before us, as a ghost might do, though whence he came we could not see. Presently the mystery was explained. Here in the cliff face there was a cleft, though one invisible even from a few paces away, since its outer edge projected over the inner wall of rock. Moreover, this opening was not above four feet in width, a mere split in the huge mountain mass caused by some Titanic convulsion in past ages. For it was a definite split, since, once entered, far, far above could be traced a faint line of light coming from the sky, although the gloom of the passage was such that torches, which were stored at hand, must be used by those who threaded it. One man could have held the place against a hundred, until he was killed. Still it was guarded, not only at the mouth where the warrior had ap- peared, but further along at every turn in the jagged chasm; and these were many. Into this grim place we went. The Zulus did not like it at all, for they arc a light-loving people, and I noted that even Umslopogaas seemed scared, and hung back a little. Nor did Hans, who, with his usual suspicion, feared some trap; nor, (or the mat- ter of that, did I. though I thought it well to appear much interested. Only Robertson seemed quite indifferent, and trudged along stolidly after a man carrying a torch. Old Billa.li put his head out of the litter and shouted back to me to fear nothing. since there were no pitfalls in the path, voice echoing strangely between those narrow walls of measureless height. For half an hour or more we pursued this dreary, winding path, round the cornel* of which the draught tore in gusts so here* that more than once the litters with the wounded men and those who bore them were nearly blown over. It was safe enough, however, since on either side of us, smooth and without break, rose the she<* walls of rock over which lay the ti'*)' ribbon of blue sky. At length the cle** widened somewliat, and the light gre* stronger, making the torches unnecessary Then of a sudden we came to its end, an*1 found ourselves upon a little plateau the mountainside. Behind us for a sand feet or so rose the sheer rock wau as it did upon the outer face, while in fr°®! and beneath, far beneath, was a beautif*" plain, circular in shape and of great extend which plain was everywhere surround*** so far as I could see. by the same wall °* rock. In short, notwithstanding its en^r* mous size, without doubt it was neitb^ more nor less than the crater of a vaS extinct volcano. Lastly, not far fro*- the centre of this plain, was wh.id^P** j to be a city, since through my glasses could see great walls built of stone and I thought were house*, all of them * character more substantial than any t®* at this time I had discovered in the of Africa.	_ I went to Billali's litter, and asked &*1* who lived in the city. ” No one." he answered; ** it has dead for thousands of years, but She-*.

Robertson and I having re-eu*^®^ our lit tore, we started on down hill rapid pace, for the road, though steep- safe and kept in good order. AH tbe of that attemoon we travelled, t0** sunset reached the edge of the plain. * ><r. e till v strong we baited a while to rest and eat, light of the growing moon grew enough to enable us to proceed. tJ pogaas came up and spoke to me.	" •'Here 11 a tortrew indeed, Macaco***®^ Rider Haggard said. " since none can climb that fence rock in which the holes seem to be few and small." *	Yes."

Robertson did not want to come, and indeed refused to do so until I suggested to him that such conduct might prejudice a powerful person against us. Umslopogaas was indifferent, putting, as he remarked, no faith in a ruler who was a woman. Only Hans, although he was so tired, acquiesced with some eagerness, the fact being that his brain was more alert, and that he hid all the curiosity of the monkey tribe which he so much resembled in appearance, anti wanted to see this queen whom Zikali revered. In the end we started, conducted by Billali and by men who carried torches whereof the light showed me that we were passing between houses, or at any rate walls that had been those of houses, and along what seemed to be a paved street. Walking under what I took to be a great arch or portico, we came into a court that was full of towering pillars but unroofed, for I could see the stars above. At its end we entered a building of which the doorway was hung with mats, to find that it was lighted with lamps, and that all down its length on either side guards armed with long spears stood at intervals. " Oh ! Baas." said Hans hesitatingly, " this is the mouth of a trap," while Umslo- pogaas glared about him suspiciously, fingering the handle of his great axe. “ Be silent," I answered. " All this mountain is a trap, therefore another does not matter, and we have our pistols." Walking forward between the double line of guards, who stood immovable as statues, wc came to some curtains hung at the end of a long narrow hall which, al- though I know little ol such things, were, I noted, made of rich stuff embroidered in colours and with golden threads. Before these curtains Btllali motioned to us to halt. Then, after a whispered colloquy with some one beyond earned on through the join of the curtains, he vanished between them, leaving u» alone far five minutes or more. At length they opened. 367 Hutchinson’s Story Magazine and a tall and elegant woman, with an Arab cast of countenance and clad in white robes, appeared and beckoned to us to enter. She did not speak or answer when I spoke to her. which was not wonderful, as afterwards I discovered that she was a mute. We went in, I wondering very much what we were going to see. On the further side of the curtains was a room of no great 6ize illumined with lamps, of which the light fell upon sculptured walls. It looked to me as though it might once have been the inmost court or a sanctuary of some temple, for at its head was a dais, upon which once perhaps had stood the shrine or statue of a god. On this dais there was now a couch, and on the couch—a goddess! There she sat, straight and still, clothed in shining white and veiled, but with her draperies so arranged that they emphasised rather than concealed the wonderful elegance of her tall form. Moreover, from beneath the veil, which was such as a bride wears, appeared two plaits of glossy, raven hair of great length, to the end of each of which was suspended a single large pearl. On either side of her stood a tall woman like to her who had led us through the curtains, and on his knees in front, but to the right, knelt Billali. About this seated' personage there was nn air of singular majesty, such as might pervade a queen as fancy paints her, though she had a nobler figure than any queen I ever saw depicted. Mystery seemed to flow from her ; it clothed her like the veil she wore, which of course heightened the effcct. Beauty flowed from her also; although it was shrouded, I knew that it was there, no veil or coverings could obscure it, at least to my imagination. Moreover, she breathed out power ; one felt it in the air as one feels a thunderstorm before it breaks, and it seethed to me that this power was not quite human, that it drew Its strength from afar, and dwelt a stranger to the earth. To tell the truth, although my curiosity, always strong, was enormously excited, and though now 1 felt glad that I had attempted this journey with all its perils. I was hor- ribly afraid, so much afraid that I should have liked to turn and run away. From tb* beginning I knew myself to be in the prc*- ence of an unearthly being clothed in •°** and perfect woman's flesh, something alie»> too. and different from humanity. What a picture it all made ! There sb* sat, quiet and stately as a perfect statue ; only her breast, rising and ia!li°8 beneath the white robe, showed that sbe was alive and breathed as others Another thing showed it also—her eve*- At first I could not see them through tb* veil, but presently, either because I g1"6* accustomed to the light, or becausc tWf brightened as those of certain animals ha'* power to do when they watch intently. * « ceased to be a covering to them.

J Now that he mentioned it, cert*rLb did . indeed 1 had felt it all along. either aide of her stood a tall woman like to her who had led us through the curtain*, and on his knees in front, but to the right, knelt Billali. Hutchinson’s Story Magazine amid the rush of sensations this one had scarcely disentangled itself in my mind. I looked at the draped shape, and saw—well, never mind whom I saw ; it was not one only, but several in sequence ; also a woman who at that time 1 did not know, although I came to know her afterwards, too well perhaps, or at any rate quite enough to puzzle me.- The odd thing was that in this hallucination the personalities of these individuals seemed to overlap and merge, till at last I began to wonder whether they were not parts of the same entity or being, manifesting itself in sundry shapes, yet springing from the same centre, as different coloured rays of light flow from the same crystal, while the beams from the source of light shift and change. But the thing is too metaphysical for my poor powers to express as clearly as I would. Also, no doubt it was but an hallucination that had its origin, perhaps, in the mischievous brain of her who sat before us. At length she spoke, and her voicesoundod like silver bells heard over water in a great calm. It was low and sweet, oh ! so sweet that at its first notes for a moment my senses seemed to swoon and my pulse to stop. It was to me that she addressed herself. " My servant here,” and ever so slightly she turned her head towards the kneeling Billali, " tells me that you who are named Watcher - in - the - Night, understand tlie tongue in which I speak to you. Is it so ? '* “ I understand Arabic of a kind well enough, having learned it on the East Coast and from Arabs in past years, but not such Arabic as you use, O-” and I paused. “ Call ine Hiya," she broke in. V which is my title here, meaning, as you know. She, or Woman. Or, if that docs not please you. call me Ayesha. It would rejoice me after so long to hear the name I bore spoken by the lips of one of my colour and of genUo blood." I blushed at the compliment so artfully conveyed, and repeated stupidly enough, ’* Not such Arabic a* you use, O— Ayc*ha.” I thought that you would like the sound of the word better than that of Hiya, though afterwards I will teach you to pro- nounce it as you should, O—have you any other name save Watcher-by-Night, which seems also to be a title ? " " Yes," I answered; “ Allan.” " O—Allan. Tell me of these,” sb« went on quickly, indicating my companion* with a sweep of her slender hand, " for the? do not speak Arabic. 1 think. Or stay. I tell you of them, and you shall say if I do so rightly. This one." and she nodded ^ towards Robertson, " is a man bemused.

Baas, all women want to melt men’s hearts ; the more the better. They seem to have other things in their minds, but really they think of nothing else until they are too old and ugly, and it takes them a long while to be sure of that." So Hans went on talking his shrewd nonsense, till, following so far as I could see the same road as that by which we had come, we reached our quarters, where we found food prepared for us. broiled goat's flesh with comcakes and milk. I think it was. also beds for us two white men covered with skin rugs and blankets woven of wool. These quarters, I should explain, con- sisted of rooms in a house built of stone, of which the walls had once been painted. The roof of the house was gone now. for we could see the stars shining above us, but as the air was very soft in this sheltered plain, this was an advantage rather than otherwise. The largest room was reserved for Robert- son and myself, while another at the back was given to Umslopogaas and his Zulus, and a third to the two wbunded men. Billali showed us these arrangements by the light of lamps, and apologised that they were not better, because, as he explained, the place was a ruin, and there had been no time to build us a house. He added that we might sleep without fear, as we were guarded, and none would dare to harm the guests of She-wlio-Commands, on whom he was sure we, or at any rate I and the Black Slaughterer, had produced an excellent impression. Then be bowed himself out. saying that he would return in the morning, and left us to our own devices. Robertson and I sat down on stools that had been set for us. and ate. but he seemed so overcome by his experiences, or by his sombre thoughts, that I could not draw him into conversation. All he remarked was that wp had fallen into queer company, and that those who supped with Satan needed a long spoon. Having delivered himself of this sentiment, he threw himself upon the 37* Hutchinson’s Story Magazine bed, prayed aloud for a while, as had become his fashion, to be ” protected from warlocks and witchcs ” amongst other things, and went to sleep. Before I turned in I visited Umslopo- gaas’s room to see that all was well with him and his people, and found him standing in the doorway staring at the star-spangled sky. “Greeting, Macumazahn," he said. " You who are white and wise, and I who am black and a warrior, have seen many strange things beneath the sun, but never such a one as we have looked upon to-night. Who and what is that chieftainess, Macu- mazahn ? ” " I do not know,*' I said, ” but it is worth while to have lived to look upon her, even though she be veiled.” " Nor do I, Macumazahn. Nay, I do know, for my heart tells me that she is the greatest of all witches, and that you will do well to guard your spirit lest she should steal it away. If she were not a witch, should I have seemed to behold the shape of Nada the Lily, who was the wife of my youth, beneath those white robes of hers, and, though the tongue in which she spoke was strange to me, to hear the murmur of Nada’s voice from between her lips, of Nada who lias gone further from me than those stars. It is good that you wear the Great Mcdicine of Zikali upon your breast, Macu- mazahn, for perhaps it will shield you from harm at those hands that are shaped of ivory.” ** Zikali is another of the tribe," I answered, laughing, ” although less beauti- ful to see. Also I am not afraid of any of them, and from this one, if she be more than some white woman whom it pleases to veil herself, I shall hope to gather wisdom." ” Aye, Macumazahn, such wisdom as spirits and the dead have to give,” ” Mayhap, Umslopogaas. but we came here to seek spirits and the dead, did we not ? *’ ” Aye,” answered Umslopogaas, “ these and war, and I think that we shall find enough of all three Only I hope tfct war will come the first, lest the spirits and the dead should bewitch me and take away my skill and courage.” Then we parted, and, too tired even to wonder any more, I threw myself down o® my bed and slept. I was awakened, when the sun was al- ready high, by the sound of Robertson, who was on his knees, praying aloud as usual- a habit of his which I confess got on nerves. Prayer, in my opinion, is a private matter between man and his Creator, that is. except in church ; further, I did not i® the least wish to hear all about Robertson * sins, which seemed to have been many an*l peculiar. It is bad enough to have to bear the burden of one’s own transgression5 without learning of those of other people that is, unless one is a priest and must do professionally. So I jumped up to escap* and make arrangements for a wash, onl) to butt into old Billali, who was standing in the doorway contemplating Robertson , with much interest and stroking his whi*e beard. He greeted me with hi3 courteous bo*' and said. Tell your companion, O Watcher, tha‘ it is not necessary for him to go upon - , knees to She-who-Commands—and must ** obeyed," he added with emphasis. "	I he is not in her presence, and that even to®** he would do well to keep silent, sine* . ' much talking in a strange tongue annoy her.” I burst out laughing, and answered. " He does not go upon his knees •"j* pray to She-who-Commands. but to Great One in the sky.”	Jt ” Indeed, Watcher. Well, we only a Great One who is upon the earth. it is true that perhaps she visits tlic *** sometimes.” *' Is it so, Billali ? " I answered Jously. ” And now I would ask you to ine to some place where I can bathe-' it “ It is ready,” he replied. ” <~otae'^p* So I called to Han«. who was about with a rifle on his arm. to follow a cloth and soap, of which fortunat^y^ hi* had a couple of pieccs lc/t. and we along what had once been a paved i running between stone house*, of ^ us icn. anii along what bad once been a paved rhic**_ time-eaten ruinsst ill remained on " Who and what is this Queen of V 37* billali ? she I asked, as we went. '* Surely » not of the Amahagger blood.” “ Ask it of herself, O Watcher, for I ^nnot tell you. All I know is that I can ^cc my own family for ten generations, ^ ®nd that my tenth forefather told his son his deathbed, for the saying has come through his descendants, that when °e was young. She-who-Commands had the land for more hundreds of years [ *®an he could count months of life." I Stopped and stared at him, since the was so amazing that it seemed to deprive *	of the power of motion. Noting my very ^^lous disbelief, he continued blandly. If you doubt, ask. And now here is . *“«re you may wash." T"hen he led me through an arched door* V. and down a wrecked passage to what obviously had once been a splendid such 43 some I have seen I uTUres °* that were built by the Romans, size was that of a large room ; it was 2®*tnictcd of a kind of marble with a ^^ng bottom tliat varied from’three to feet in depth, and water still ran in . 3 out of it through large glazed pipes. reover, around it was a footway about ij~ across, from which opened cham* unroofed now. that the bathers once as dressing-rooms, while between these P^ben stood the remains of statues. 7"“* at the end indeed, where an alcove had S^d it from sun and weather, was still Perfect, except for the outstretched Jj8 v,l'ich were gone (the right hand I ^l“c*d lying at the bottom of the bath). «s that of a nude young woman in the of diving, a very beautiful l»it of r?*1 * thought, though of course I am no of sculpture, even the smile mingled *tcP|l'ali'|n upon the girl s face lx*uig ostural'.y portrayed, statue showed two things, that the j_^Wa» used by females, and that the who had built it were highly civilised. belonged to an advanced if some- Eastern race, since the girl's nose hfcj','* *®ythinj, Semitic in character, and Pf(r though prettily shaped. were full e r*st. the basin was so clean that I Hk, 11 ,T** ** must have bwn made ready for °r other recent bathers, and at its Rider Haggard bottom I discovered gratings and broken pipes of earthenware, which suggested that in the old days the water could be warmed by means of a furnace. In this relic of a long-past civilisation, which excited Hans even more than it did myself, since, having never seen anything of the sort, he thought it so strange that, as he informed me, he imagined that it must have been built by witchcraft, I had a most delightful bathe. Even Hans was per- suaded to follow my example, a tiling I had rarely known him do before, and, seated in its shallowest part, splashed some water over his yellow wrinkled anatomy. Then we returned to our house, where I found an ex- cellent breakfast had been provided which was brought to us by tall, silent, handsome women, who surveyed us out of the corners of their eyes, but said nothing at all. Shortly after I had finished my meal, Billali, who had disappeared, came back again and said that She-who-Commanded desired my presence as she would speak with me ; also that I must come alone. So. after attending to the wounded, who both seemed to be getting on well, I went, followed by Hans armed with his rifle, though I only carried my revolver. Robertson wished to accompany me, as he did not seem to care about being left alone with the Zulus in that strange place, but Billali would not allow it. Indeed, when he persisted, two great men stepped forward and crossed their spears before him in a somewhat threatening fashion. Then, at my entreaty, for I feared lest trouble should arise, he gave in and returned to the house. Following our path of the night before, we walked up a ruined street which I could see was only one of scores in what had once been a very great city, until we came to the archway tliat I have mentioned, a great one now overgrown with plants which, from their yellow, sweet-seen ted bloom, I judged to be a species of wallflower, also with a kind of ho use leek or saxifrage. Here Haas was stopped by guards, Billali explaining to me that lie must await my return, an order which ne obeyed unwillingly enough. Then I went on down the narrow passage, lined as before by guards, who stood silent as statues, and came to the curtains at the end. 373 Hutchinson’s Story Magazine Here, at a motion from Billali, who did not seem to dare to speak in this place, I stood still and waited. CHAPTER XIII ALLAN HEARS A STRANGE TALE For some minutes I remained before those curtains until, had it not been for something electric in the air which got into my bones, a kind of force that, perhaps in my fancy only, seemed to pervade the place, I should certainly have grown bored. Indeed I was about to ask my companion why he did not announce our arrival instead of standing there like a stuck pig with his eyes shut as though in prayer or meditation, when the curtains parted, and from between them appeared one of those tall waiting- women whom we had seen on the previous night. She contemplated us gravely for a few moments, then moved her hand twice, once forward towards Billali as a signal to him to retire, which he did with great rapidity, and next in a beckoning fashion towards myself as a signal to me to follow her. I obeyed, passing between the thick curtains, which she fastened in some way behind me, and found myself in the same roofed and sculptured room that I have already described. Only now there were no lamps, such light as penetrated it coming from an opening above that I could not see and falling upon the dais at its head, also on her who sat upon the dais. Yes, there she sat in her white robes and veil, the point and centre of a little lake of light, a wondrous ami in a sense a spiritual vision, for in truth there was something about her which was not of the world, something that drew and yet fright- ened me. Still as a statue she sat. like one to whom time is of no account, and who has grown weary of motion, and on cither side of her. yet more still, like caryatides supporting a shrine, stood two of the stately women who were h«-r attendants. For the rest a sweet and subtle odour pervaded the chamber which took hold of my senses as hachich might do, which I was sure pro- ceeded from her, or from her garments, for I could see no perfumes burning. She spoke no word, yet I knew she was ir.viUtt? me to come nearer, and moved forward I reached a curious carved chair that was placed just beneath the dais, and thett halted, not liking to sit down with®* permission. For a long while she contemplated me, as before I could feel her eyes searching «ne from head to foot. and. as it were. looki&S through me as though she would discover my very soul. Then at length she moved, waving thoS* two ivory arms of hers outwards with * ( kind of swimming stroke, whereon th* women to right and left of her turned **^1 glided away, I know not whither. " Sit, Allan,” she said, '* and let us talfc for I think we have much to say to eac** other. Have you slept well ? And eate*^ though I fear that the food is but rough' Also was the bath made ready for you ? " Yes, O Ayesha.” I answered to all questions, adding, for I knew not what say. " It seems to be a very ancient bath- " When last I saw it," site replied, was well enough, with statues staud»>* round it worked by a sculptor who h*® seen beauty in his dreams. But in thousand years—or is it more ?—the towgl of Time bites deep, and doubtless, MW else in this dead place, it is now a ruin. ! I coughed to cover up tbe exclamation disbelief that rose to my lips. and renunj blandly that two thousand years was j tainly a long time. " When you say one thing, Allan. **jl mean another, your Arabic is even vile than usual, and does not serve to cW***l your thought.” *' It may be so. O Ayesha, for I ^ know that tongue, as I do many other °* , dialects of Africa, by learning it from 0> non men.

As for what I saw—well, it cannot be described, at any rate by me. except perhaps as a flash of glory. Every man lias dreamed of perfect beauty, basing his ideas of it perhaps on that of some woman he has met who chanced to take his fancy, with a few acces- sories from splendid pictures or Greek statues thrown in. plus a garnishment of the imagination. At any rate 1 have, and here was that perfect beauty multiplied by ten, such beauty, that at the sight of it the senses reeled. And yet I repeat that it is not to be described. I do not know what the nose or the lips were like : in fact, all that I can remember with dis- tinctness is the splendour of the eyes, of which I had caught some hint through her veil on the previous night. Oh t they were wondrous, those eyes, but I cannot tell their colour, save that the groundwork of them was black. Moreover, they seemed to be more than eyes as we understand them. They were indeed windows of the soul, out of which looked thought and majesty and infinite wisdom, mixed with all the allure- ments and the mystery that we are accus- tomed to see or to imagine in woman. Here let me say something at once. If this marvellous creature expected that the revelation of her splendour was going to make me her slave, to cause me to fall in love with her. as it is called, well, she must have been disappointed, for it had no such effect. It frightened and in a sense humbled me, that is all, for I felt myself to be in the presence of something that was not human, something alien to me as a man. which I could fear and even adore as humanity would adore wliat is divine, but with which I had no desire to mix. More- over. was it divine, or was it something very different ? I did not know—I only knew that it was not for me ; as soon should I have thought of asking for a star to set within my lantern. 1 think that she felt this, felt that her stmke was missed, as the French say. that is. if she meant to strike at all at this moment, of which I am not certain, for it was in a changed voice, one with a suspicion of dull in it. that she said with a little laugh. " Do you admit now, O Allan, that a 375 Hutchinson’s Story Magazine woman may be old and still remain fair and unwrinkled ? " I admit,” I answered, although I was trembling so much that I could hardly / speak with steadiness, ** that a woman may be splendid and lovely beyond anything that the mind of man can conceive, whatever her age, of which I know nothing, and I would add this, O Ayesha, that I thank you very much for having revealed to me the glory that is hid beneath your veil.” " Why ? ” she asked, and I thought that I detected curiosity in her question. ” For this reason, O Ayesha. That now there is no fear of my troubling you in such a fashion as you seemed to dread a little while ago. As soon would a man desire to court the moon sailing in her silver loveliness through heaven.” " The moon 1 It is strange that you should compare me to the moon." she said musingly. " Do you know that the moon was a great goddess in Old Egypt, and that her name was Isis, and—well, once I had to do with Isis ? Perhaps you were there and knew it, since more lives than one are given to most of us. I must search and learn. For the rest, all have not thought as you do, Allan. Many, on the contrary*, love and seek to win the Divine.” “ So do I at a distance. O Ayesha, but to come too near to it I will not presume, knowing that I might be consumed.” " You have wisdom,” she replied, not without admiration. “ The moths are few that fear the flame, but those are the moths which live. Why do you come to me, and what do you seek of me. O Allan. Watcher- in-the-Night ? Say it truthfully, for though I may laugh at lies and pass them by when they have to do with the eternal swordptay which Nature decrees between man and woman, until they break apart or. casting down the swords, seek arms in which they agree too well, when they haveHo do with policy and high purpose and ambition's ends, why then I avenge them upon the liar.” Now I hesitated, as what I had to urll her seemed so foolish, indeed &o insane, while she waited patiently as though to givr me time to shape my thoughts. Speaking at last because I must. I said. ** I come to ask you, O Ayesha, to sho* me the dead, if the dead still live elsewhere, f ” And who told you, O Allan, that I j could show you the dead, if they are no* truly dead ? There is but one, I think, anc* if you are his messenger, show* me hi»^ token, for without it we do not speak together of this business.” ” What token ? ” I asked .innocently though I guessed her meaning well enough* She searched me with her great eyes, l°f 1 "felt, and indeed saw them on me through i the veil, then answered,	1 “ I think—nay, let me be sure,” j half-rising from the couch, she bent h*J3 head over a tripod at her side, and stare" into what seemed to be a bowl of crystal* If I read aright,” she said, straightening herself presently, "it is a hideous thiofc enough, the carving of an abortion ol * man such as no woman would care to on lest her babe should bear its stamp* a charmed thing also that has virtue ] him who wears it. especially for you, , Allan, since something tells me that K I dyed with the blood of one who loved y0** If you have it. let it be revealed, since '*lt^ out it I do not talk with you of your dead- Now I drew the talisman from its hidWJj place and held it towards her.

Hutchinson’s Story Magazine had done before, and something of the pure outline of her classic face, also the fragrance of her hair was wonderful. She took the talisman in her hand and examined it closely. " I have heard of this charm, and it is true that the thing has power.” she said. “ for I can feel it running through my veins, also that it is a shield of defence to him who wears it. Yes, and now i under- stand what perplexed me somewhat, namely, how it came about that when you vexed me into unveiling—but let that matter be. The wisdom was not your own, but another’s, that is all. Yes. the wisdom of one whose years have borne him beyond the shafts that fly from woman's eyes, the ruinous shafts that bring men to doom and nothingness. Tell me. Allan, is this the likeness of him who gave it yon ? " “ Yes, O Ayesha, the very picture, as I think, carved by himself, though he said that it is ancient, and others tell that it has been known in the land for centuries." " So, perchance, has he," she answered drily, " since some of our company live long. Now tell me this wizard's name. Nay. wait awhile, for I would prove that indeed you are his messenger with whom I may talk about the dead, and other things. O Allan. You can read Arabic, can you not ? ” " A little," I answered. Then from a stool at her side she took paper, or rather papyrus, and a reed pen. and on her knee wrote something on the sheet which she gave to me folded up. " Now tell me the names.” she said. " and then let us see if they tally with what I have written, for, if so, you are a true man, not a wanderer or spy." " The principal names of this doctor are Zikali, the Opener of Roads, the * Thing- that-should-never-have-been-bom 1'" I answered. “ Read the writing. Allan." I unfolded the sheet and read Arabic words which meant " Weapons ; CleaV®*, of Rocks; One at whom dogs bark aiW. children wail." “ The last two are near enough," she said, " but the first is wrong." " Nay.

And yet learning it was a matter of only a few spare half-hours while smoking my after- dinner cigar. “ Maybe you’ve heard of Dr. K. M. H. Blackford, who for years has made a business oi analysing character from appearances. One of the big agricultural implement companies paid Dr. Blackford a record salary for choosing employees— because of Dr. Blackford's ability to tell from an applicant's looks whether he had the stuff to make good, and what kind of a job he would fit into best Instead of being guided by an applicants record, or experience, or references. Dr. Black- ford judged hi& good points and bad joints, his ability and dependability, entirely from what she could see of him while taking his application. Other big firms have also paid her big fees for doing similar work. " I had read and heard enough about Dr. Blackford's work.” he continued, •* to convince me that this was something 1 wanted to learn. I made careful in- quiries. I found that this individual had taught the knack of judging to 384 ADVERTISEMENTS thousands of men and women—from ambitious clerks up to the managers of large companies.” I have known John Cogan for years. He isn't a man who lets mere enthusiasm run away with him. Results are the only things that count with him. But there was one point I didn’t get—how so busy a man as John Cogan had found time to take lessons from Dr. Blackford or anyone else. “Nothing of the sort,” he exclaimed when I asked him. “ Dr. Blackford has arranged the whole thing into seven simple, quick, and easy lessons in printed form—a sort of pocket course for busy people, one that they can read and study after dinner at home, in the train, or at any other time or place. The lessons are so simple and interesting that they are more like a pastime than a study. My first evening on those lessons was a real pleasure. And the practical re- sults began to show immediately—that first evening gave me pointers that I began to find useful the very next day. The rest was merely a matter of a little more practice.” •	• • • • I took John Cogan’s suggestion and wrote for the lessons. That was about three months ago. Now I’ve learned the knack of reading people from the outward signs—of telling what a man or woman is like from what they look like. He didn’t paint it a bit too strong— cither the simplicity of it, or the practical everyday value of knowing how to judge people, instead of relying on mere hap- hazard impressions about them. Thanks to those seven easy lessons, I can now tell almost the minute I lay eyes on people how to make them my friends, in cither a business or social way—how to talk to them, how to influence them to the best advantage. Also I can tell at a glance whom I can trust and whom I can’t. The first time I see a man — or woman either—I know more about him than many of his friends do years of acquaintance. On top of*' this, those lessons have taught me 0*°*^ about myself than I ever knew before^ and when you come right down to mighty few of us ever really know o>jf selves, to say nothing of others. my mind, those two points are two the biggest factors in any kind of w0 . or business—knowing yourself knowing others. No wonder Mr. L- Hawley wrote as follows:— “ If I had known years ago 'v^aa. have learned already from Dr. ^ ford’s Course, the knowledge would been worth a thousand times the of these lessons to me."
