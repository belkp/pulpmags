Improve your personal appearance as wedl as your health . . . Ultra-Violet Kay treatments help clear up certain skin blemishes and disorders, thus giving you a clean, healthy ekin condition. SUNSHINE IS HEALTH Vitamin D, derived from Utra-Violet rays, builds strong bones, raises your power to resist disease, common colds, and other common winter ailments. Doctofs have found that Ultra-Violet Rays are the most helpful in the prevention and cure of rickets in children. With this Carbon Arc Lamp you can lit- erally be ‘'living in the sun”—day or night, the year 'round, and have mid-summer sunshine with all its health giving properties at the touch of a switch. Six to twelve minutes ex- posures are eQuivalent to from one to two hours of natural mid-summer eunehine. So simple to operate, that even a youngster can use it. POWERFUL AID TO HEALTH The U. S. Bureau of Standards, in its tests of artificial illuminants, found that the Carbon Arc is the closest approach to sunlight. Because we cannot depend on natural sunlight in the winter months, it becomes necessary to get our dally quota of healthful sunshine through some artificial source of supply. Sunlight, when analyzed, consists of three elements: Heat (Infra-Red Rays), Light, and Ultra-Violet (Actinic or Chemical Rays). Each serves an important need, and it is the combination of all three as in Natural Sunlight that it is most beneficial. This CARBON ARC SUN LAMP produces all three—the same as in Natural Sunlight. The cost is so low to operate, that you can afford to have one in your home, buy this Sunlamp at the low introductory price of $4.95, sent with your order. We pay the shipping charges anywhere In the U. S. A. (Regu- lar price, $7.60.) DYNAMIC Scienee Stories 7 I CAN TRAIN YOU AT HOME FOR A My Training Pays GOOD FOR BOTH J. E. SMITH.

The leaping blue atomic Homes fhat belched from Hannibal Sprati's exploding tlme-machlne sucked Harry and Celia, two present-day humans, lata tbe mad, mechanical empire of 2439 Tranerlca, where Interstellar mechanisms held men and women In Robot slavery! THOUGHT-PROVOKING BOOK-LENGTH SUPER-SCIENCE NOVEL CHAPTER I In the Crystal Room Hannibal fairchild SPRATT the Seventh, the sole surviving heir of the great Spratt-Fairchild dynasty and the ruler of allTranerica (formerly.America), sat in the Crystal Room of his castle above the Hudson. Through the clear glitter- ing walls of a dome-shaped chamber that arched two hundred feet above him, the winter sun shone in remote, chilly splendor. The rays, filtering in as through a layer of ice, gave a bluish, rather ghostly complexion to Spratt as he idled in his cushioned chair; they lent a cold accentuation to the baldness Machines towered to a height of thirty and forty feet—and 12 before each unit stood a figure fantastic beyond belief TRANERICA of his polished pate, to the outlines of his pallid, puffy face and knob-like chin, and to his stumpy form, arrayed in a purple, bejeweled, toga-like robe. With a yawn, he slowly lifted himself out of his chair, and ran his fingers across, the keyboard of a five-foot ma- chine, with something of the appearance of a greatly enlarged typewriter. In- stantly a door to his rear slammed to a dose; another door far in front of him turned outward; a partition in the glass roof opened slightly, admitting the outer air; a wire along the wall began moving, and bore a lighted cigarette al- most to his lips; a paper came rattling in through a little tube, and opened as though moved by invisible hands; and —best of all, for it brought a light to the ruler’s cloudy gray eyes!—a tray with a decanter of some sparkling red liquid BY SCIENCE-FICTION’S BEST LOVED AND BEST KNOWN SATIRIST! 13 14 DYNAMIC Science Stories glided in along two little rails placed just above the floor. As Spratt sipped the beverage, he chanced to let his gaze rest on a large printed sheet that cut off the light on a segment of the glass wall a few yards away. “By the blue lightnings,” he muttered, “it’s time to turn a new leaf!” And he pressed another key on the type- writer-like instrument; and a lever reached out automatically, and tore off the printed sheet. “December 31, 2438,” it had read. But in its place ap- peared a paper with the notation, “Jan- uary 1, 2439-” Having finished his drink, Spratt thrust the cigarette between his lips, and strolled listlessly across the room. He stared out through the wall—which, being ^ entirely of glass, was like one great continuous window—and saw the river glistening fifteen hundred feet be- low. Bordering the water on both shores and reaching into the distance as far as his somewhat dim sight could fol- low, he saw the gigantic black bulks of the “Hives”—those enormous buildings which, each a quarter of a mile high and rectangular, triangular or hexagonal in shape, had existed ever since the Iron Renaissance of the twenty-second cen- tury. The eyes of the ruler, as he glanced out at those huge familiar struc- tures, scarcely noted how closely they were packed together, windowless and forbidding; or how, in the narrow aisles between them, a darkness as of mid- night reigned, except when now and then a light flashed and went out in their vague depths, like the signal lamp of some soul astray in Purgatory. OPRATT yawned once more, and looked bored; a sigh came from be- tween his heavy lips. “This business of being a dictator isn’t what it used to be,” he reflected, gloomily. “Every- thing runs so smoothly, there’s nothing left for me to do. Why, there hasn’t even been a revolt for seventy-five years. They say that dear old great- granddad, Hannibal Fairchild Spratt the Fourth, had a cracking good time putting down the insurrection of the Mill Robots. But that was way back in 2362. Then his father, Hanniabl Fair- child Spratt the Third, had to liquidate ten thousand conspirators who were plotting against his life. That was more than a hundred years ago. And, before that time, the first two members of their dynasty had to keep things humming to cut down their enemies and stay on their thrones. But look at me! Noth- ing to do but press buttons all day. No one would even think of questioning my authority. I don’t have to issue com- mands; I’m obeyed automatically. And, all the while, I’m so weary of the whole thing I often think of taking one long jump into the Hudson and ending it all.” Dismally the sovereign glanced down at the waters, still glittering in the noonday sun despite the shadowing towers that arose on all sides. Then ir- resolutely he ambled away; turned a switch; entered a little plush-lined car that rolled in through a door which opened as if of its own volition; pulled a second switch; and went gliding away through long steel-lined corridors. As he shot rapidly forward, doors opened before him and closed behind him with perfectly timed reguarity, although no human operator was visible; lights gleamed and vanished; the car turned curves and descended grades although the rider did nothing to guide it; and fi- nally it came to a halt in an immense room marked “Science Laboratory.” Well, might as well go on with my experiments,” Spratt reflected. For he had one great secret vice; frequently, when bored with everything else in life, he would find amusement and relaxation in his scientific investigations. Just now he was on the trail of a discovery which, THE LORO OF TRAN ERICA 15 he thought, would startle even a century that had all but lost the capacity for enthusiasm. The moment he entered the labora- tory, he was a transformed man. With something of an inventor’s natural pride, he glanced at the great machine that towered above him, with coils as of monstrous exposed entrails, and pro- jecting pipes as of factory smokestacks and tall dials, and wires and wheels in- tricately interwoven, and a dark buzz- ing something in his heart, which might have reminded one of a dynamo purr- ing. Certainly, the machine was unlike anything else which existed even in the mechanical twenty-fifth century; and Spratt, as he stared up at it, forgot that he was the head and ruler of all Traner- ica, forgot all the monotony and ennui of a dictator’s life, forget everything ex- cept that he was on the road to a great scientific discovery. UR age has made marvelous progress in its command of in- visible rays,” he meditated, as he plunged a corkscrew-like steel device down a long tube and caused a sheet of red lightning to flash across the room. “We have solved the problem of the dis- tant control of moving cars, doors, ele- vators, aircraft and the like. But in one respect we’ve never gone very far. For the last five centuries, our knowledge of the fourth dimension has been con- fined mostly to theory. Except, of course,” he added, with a chuckle of sly satisfaction as a wave of blue flame crackled in front of him, “for my ma- chine ! ” “It’s not perfect yet,” he went on, while his hands deftly manipulated a lever, “but it takes advantage of a new principle. It’s evident that the rays of the fourth dimension must impinge on thoee of the third, since all the universe is really one. At the point where they impinge, it may be possible to pass from one dimension to the other. This means we may be able to shift to another posi- tion in time, since time, as has been brought out centuries ago, is the fourth dimension of space. Or, on the other hand, we may bring objects out of some other place in time into the year 2438 —no, 2439. Well, isn’t that what I’ve really done already?” While his fingers still pulled at the levers of the machine, Spratt glanced behind him to a great glass case, where a curious assortment of bric-a-brac had been accumulated. There was a frag- ment of an old, mouldy, broken vase, bearing an Etruscan inscription; a desiccated seven-foot bone, which might have belonged to a dinosaur; a Medi- eval steel helmet, badly eaten by rust; the shattered half of what looked a lit- tle like a bronze Buddha; and—the prize and crown of the collection!—an electric light bulb which may have dated bade as far as the mid-twentieth century, its fractured antique filament still distinctly visible in the glass inte- rior. “With such objects already gathered from the past, by causing it to merge with our own dimension,” reflected Spratt, permitting himself an inventor’s natural pride, “there is no telling where we may not end. Yes! I may yet be known to the world as something more worth-while than a dictator!” Long and lovingly he peered at the curios in his glass case—so long and lovingly, in fact, that he may have be- come a trifle careless. His fingers moved almost automatically among a great array of switches and levers, as numer- ous as the keys on a piano; and his eyes did not closely follow what his hands were doing. Accordingly, he may have pulled the wrong rod—at least, this is how he afterwards explained the mat- ter to himself—with the result that Hannibal Fairchild Spratt the Seventh received the greatest shock that had 16 DYNAMIC Science Stories come to him in all his forty-nine years on earth. All at once the room seemed deluged in a flood of leaping blue fire. There came a detonation as of exploding dy- namite; the upper portions of the di- mension-machine flew apart, and crashed against the ceiling as if shot out of a trench mortar; the walls shook, the floor heaved like the deck of a ves- sel pitching at sea; and green and pur- ple lights succeeded the blue in the split fraction of a second. Then there came the sound of heavy objects thudding; and finally, while a rain of debris show- ered to all parts of the room, a cry as of some being in agony came from the depths of the shattered machine; and then by degrees all grew still. C TUNNED by the concussion, Spratt k-' picked himself up from a corner of the room, into which he had been prov- identially hurled. A fragment of flying steel as long as his arm had missed his head by less than the width of his small finger, yet he had not entirely escaped injury. His neatly shaven lower lip was bleeding; there was a blue gash beneath his left eye; the sleeves of his toga were torn, and the gown was streaked and speckled with machine oil; moreover, his shin was bruised so painfully that he groaned. Nevertheless, Spratt felt fortunate as he arose to his feet; for he knew that he escaped destruction by a hair’s breadth. “By the white fires!” he tought, as he gloomily surveyed the dimension-ma- chine, which now was little more than a twisted mass of wreckage. “This ends my experiments with super-space! Ah, well! I suppose I’ll have to resign myself. I’ll never be anything more for the rest of my life than dictator of half the world 1” Mournfully he continued his rumina- tions, as he mopped a perspiring brow. “Mighty lucky I took the precaution of making the laboratory sound-proof. Otherwise, the explosion would have been heard, and then wouldn’t I be the laughing stock of two continents I Not openly, of course,” he rambled on, “for people still value their lives!” He took a step forward to examine the ruins; and, as he did so, he received a shock only slightly less than that of the explosion. A low moan came to his ears; and something stirred slightly amid the debris. Then, while he paused thunderstricken, he heard a second moan from a different direction; and something else moved amid the wreck- age. Spratt’s first impulse was to flee. Had he not been a son of the matter-of- fact twenty-fifth century, which had long ceased to believe in ghosts, haunt- ings, and other such unscientific non- sense, he might even have been filled with superstitious terror. Nothing was more certain than he had been alone in the room only a minute before —whence, therefore, the moans and the mysterious movements? The sit- uation was one to daunt even a braver man than Spratt; hence it is no won- der if he trembled a little and felt his scalp prickling; while old ancestral fears, reviving from the childhood of the race, leapt up in his heart, and turned his knees to water. Within a second or two, the moans were repeated—and from two separate directions! And Spratt, as he backed up slightly, with a wildly hammering heart, thought of the secret button near the door, which he need only press in order to send a score of mechanical po- licemen clattering to his aid. But before he could get within yards of the button, something occurred which held him riveted to one spot and caused his eyes almost to pop out of his head. He heard still another moan, followed by a much more vigorous stir- ring amid the ruined machinery; then THE LORD OF TRANERICA 17 something pushed itself up out of the confusion of wires, wheels and rods, and, with a prodigious heaving move- ment, threw the obstructions out of its way, and staggered to its feet. Stricken speechless, Spratt stood face to face—with another man! And what a man! More than six feet tall and with shoulders like a bullock’s, he tossed a mane of touseled red hair and stared about him in a dazed way through wide blue eyes. He was beardless, but wore a moustache—as no man had done for centuries! And his clothes—they were like articles straight from a museum I He wore tight-fitting dark trousers, sur- mounted by an equally tight-fitting dark jacket—in the absurd ancient style! Around his neck he wore a colored rope! His feet were hidden in shining black cases instead of being displayed in sandals! Even had his garments not been rumpled and soiled he could have shone in a masquerade without further make-up! A FTER glancing about him for a moment as if stunned, the stran^ ger let a startled exclamation come to his lips. “Where am I? And you—who are you?” Spratt noted what a strange enun- ciation the man had. It was clear that he was speaking English, and yet it was hard, very hard, to make out what he was saying. “I—I don’t know what happened to me,” continued the newcomer, rubbing his hand across his forehead, as if to wipe away the mists. “We—we were up there together on the hilltop—and sud- denly everything went blank.” And then, as recollection game flashing back, he cried out sharply, almost furiously, “She! Tell me—where is she?” But before Spratt had had time to answer—indeed, before he had quite made out the meaning of these words— the stranger’s attention was caught by another groan from amid the tangles of broken machinery. And he wheeled about, and frantically began working amid the wreckage, which he swept aside with swift and powerful strokes. “Celia!” he cried, in tones of tender- ness and alarm. “Celia, dearest! Are you hurt? Are you hurt?” “No, not much, darling, not much,” came the reply, in a softer voice; and, a moment later, another figure stood at his side. “By the red furies, can it be that fairies are real?” thought Spratt, as, with a gasp, he gazed at the second stranger—a slender, fragile figure all clad in shimmery white, with flowing hair of such a rich golden and delicate features with such an innocent, pansy- like grace that for a moment the dic- tator wondered whether he were not subject to hallucinations, and were not beholding an apparition rather than a breathing woman. CHAPTER II Unexpected Visitors FOR a long, silent minute Spratt stood staring at the two strangers in a fascinated surprise equalled only by the astonishment with which they stared back at him. But grad- ually, as the hazes cleared from his mind, the inventor realized what had happened. The dimension machine had snatched these beings out of another century! By accident, they had been at the point where the dimensions merged, and had been hurled into the twenty-fifth century from some remote age. It was evident that they were very ancient, not only from the cut of their clothes, but from— Spratt’s reveries were interrupted by the voice of the girl—a full-throated, 18 DYNAMIC Science Stories richly musical voice such as he did not remember ever having heard before. “Where—where are we? What— what has happened?” she ejaculated, still somewhat dazed, as she leaned against the man for support. “Never mind, sweetheart, it will be all right,” he soothed, bending over her solicitously. “It all seems like some bad practical joke, doesn’t it?” Spratt, although he made every ef- fort, could not quite catch the meaning of these words; but he realized that it was about time for him to say some- thing. Accordingly, he stepped for- ward, with a gracious sweep of his left arm, following the best twenty-fifth century standards of etiquette; and he addressed the young lady by the name he had heard the man employ. “You are very welcome, sweetheart,” he began, with what he thought to be ex- traordinary politeness from one in his high position. But he stopped short very suddenly, feeling that he had erred somehow; he did not like the quiver of revulsion that passed through the girl’s frame, nor the icy glitter that came into the man’s eyes. “I do not know who you may be,” declared the latter, taking a pugnacious forward stride, “but you assume strange liberties on short acquaintance!” “Would you mind repeating that?” requested the dictator, mildly. “You pronounce English with such a quaint accent, I’m afraid I didn’t catch one word.” The stranger’s reply was a burst of mocking laughter. “Quaint accent? Why, you ought to hear yourself! You’ve got the damnedest foreign twist to your tongue I ever heard. Any one would know you hadn’t been in the country a year!” “I’ve been here all my life, sir!” snorted Spratt, indignantly, when he had caught the gist of the latter remark. “I suppose you’ve been wearing that circus costume, too, all your life?” sneered the stranger, with a gesture to- ward Spratt's bejeweled purple toga, now smeared and spattered with ma- chine oil. “Don’t you think it’s time to cut out the comedy? What in hell’s name did you do to us anyway? Knock us cold, then kidnap us?” “Knock you cold? Kidnap you? Circus costume?” repeated the dictator, with a puzzled expression. “I do not know those words. They have a very queer antique sound. If you will excuse me, I shall investigate.” While his visitors looked on with wide, gaping eyes he pressed a lettered button that stood with hundreds of others on a dial at one end of the room. A few seconds passed in silence; then a panel on the wall rattled open, and a huge volume slid in through a pneu- matic tube and arranged itself neatly on a table. I ’HIS dictionary isn’t exactly up-to- *	the-minute,” remarked Spratt, as he thumbed through the thousands of pages. “It dates back to the late twen- ty-four twenties. . . . Ah, here we are! ‘Kidnap. Obsolete. To steal bodily. Refers to a barbarous practice of the Ages of Confusion, no case of which has been known for over three hundred years.’ “So that’s what you accuse me off?” he rushed on, looking up and glaring at the man. “Resorting to a barbarous practice of the Ages of Confusion, in order to steal you bodily? Do you give me no credit at all for intelligence?” “Say, you must be daft!” muttered the man. “I’m not interested in your crazy remarks! All I want to know is when you’re going to release me, and this young lady, Celia—Miss Stan- wick.” “Stanwhat?” repeated Spratt. “Stan- wick? What a horrible name! It grates on the tongue like sand! What THE LORD OF TRANERICA 19 did you say you wanted me to do?” “Release us! Set us free! Let us go!” repeated the stranger, with a shout. “Oh, yes, I see,” replied the dictator. “I’m sorry, but it’s impossible. The machine is broken, and I couldn’t get you back to your own century even if I wanted to.” “Our own century?” echoed the man and the girl, staring at one another in bewilderment. “That’s what I said,” reiterated Spratt. “I can tell from your clothes, and also from your speech, that you come from somewhere in the Ages of Confusion. Maybe even as far back as the year 2000.” The newcomers stood regarding Spratt in a quizzical silence, as if not knowing whether he were jesting or a lunatic. “By the way, just what year was it before your change of dimension?” he inquired. “You know damn well it’s 1938!” came the man’s growled reply. “1938? Well, well, well, isn’t that interesting? Why, that’s much further back than I’d dare to hope! Before the first flush of the Mental Revival! Now I know why your speech and man- ners are so uncouth. Of course, you’re not to be blamed for the backwardness of your age. I congratulate you—con- gratulate both of you on escaping from the Dark Generations into an eilight- ened century!” “Say, I can’t make out half of what you’re saying, but you ought to go on the stage, you say it so well!” growled the man. “He’d look wonderful in the movies, wouldn’t he,” tittered the girl. “I consider it a piece of rare luck to have met you,” continued Spratt, who had not caught the drift of the last re- marks. “I’ve always wondered how it was possible for any one to live at all in the Dark Generations—and now to have first-hand information!—why, it’s worth half my empire. Consider your- selves my guests, both of you, so long as you remain in Tranerica—which, I trust, will be for life. You particu- larly,” he concluded, with an ogling smile at Celia, who frowned in reply and averted her fair head. While Spratt was making this speech, the red-haired man had sidled over to the table, on which lay the dictionary, whose heavy golden cover gave it an unusual appearance. With a gasp, he turned the leaves, struck by the typog- raphy, which was of a style wholly new to him; then, upon glancing at the title page, he let out a little cry of astonish- ment. “I’ll be damned!” he exclaimed, un- der his breath. And then, in louder tones, “I’ll be damned a thousand times!” And finally, at the top of his voice, “Come, quick, Celia! See! Just see!” ' I 'HE girl flitted to his side, and her *	eyes also widened with amazement as she glanced at the lines he eagerly pointed out: Printed for His Honor Hannibal Fairchild Spratt the Seventh. Hudson Highlands. A. D. 2429.” Yet there was an incredulous smile on her face as she turned toward her companion. “Sounds so matter-of-fact you’d almost think it was real, wouldn’t you?” she commented, with a little laugh. “Yes, it’s carrying a practical joke a good deal further than you’d expect,” he acknowledged, also with an unbelieving smile. “What I want to know is, who in thunder is Hannibal Fairchild Spratt the Seventh?” This was the dictator’s cue. Coming forward with a broad grin on his baggy face, he bowed and made another wide flourish with his left hand, then de- clared, “My dear friends from the twen- 20 DYNAMIC Science Stories tieth century, the man you refer to is none other than myself. Since you would, in the natural course of things —h’m—have died nearly five hundred years ago, you couldn’t be expected to gnize me. But you see before you Tyngall of Tranerica!” Having made this announcement, the speaker stood erect and impressive, with a proud light in his glance, as if expecting his hearers to fall down on their knees before him. But, to his surprise, they did not seem overwhelmed; on the contrary, amused sparkles played in their eyes. “The what, did you say?” demanded the red-haired stranger, a little in the manner of one humoring a child. “The Tyngall of Tranerica!” re- peated Spratt, imposingly. “Tyagall of Tranerica 1 ” “Afraid I don’t get you,” stated the stranger. The girl, meanwhile, had turned her back, and was struggling hard to re- strain her laughter. “Well, I’ve said it as plainly as I know how,” returned Spratt, dejectedly. And then, as if a burst of light had come over him, he exclaimed, “Of course I Oh of course! I should have known! In your day, Tranerica wasn’t called Teanerfca at all. It wasn’t until the twenty-second century ghat the term came into use, a corruption of the old Trans-America. So let me explain again, my friends. What you see be- fore you is the Tyngall of Trans-Amer- ica.” The strangers still looked blank. “What’s a Tyngall?” they inquired. “Oh, by the spitting lightnings, don’t you know that, either? But naturally not, naturally not,” he continued, in the manner of one suddenly recollecting something. “The word was only intro- duced by my renowned forebear, Han- nibal Fairchild Spratt the First, com- monly known as the Great. It was a name he took in place of the plebeian designation of king, dictator, or em- peror. It means ruler of the world.” ' I 'HE two visitors were exchanging significant glances, in which amuse- ment alternated with a faint pity. “Poor fellow! He’fe nuts!” the man whispered to the girl; and she nodded back expressively. “Poor fellow! Nuts! I do not know what those expressions meanl” re- flected Spratt whose keen ears had caught the words. “I will remember to look them up in the dictionary.” And then, in majestic tones, “You people do not seem pleased to have the honor of speaking to the Tyngall!” “Oh, we—we are overcome, Your Highness!” declared the red-haired one, Bowing to the floor with a gesture of mock courtesy. “Will your Eminence accept our pro- foundest obeisance! ” exclaimed the girl, also bpwing; but she was unable to keep back the giggles that struggled to her throat. “Was every one in the twentieth century like you?” thundered the Tyn- gall, scowling in high displeasure. “Was it your custom to make mock of sol- emn things? Do you not realize that if any one else in all Tranerica spoke to me in such a fashion, I would touch a button that would send a death-bolt shivering through his body? From the barrens of the Yukon to the plains of Patagonia, and from the waters of the Atlantic to those of the Pacific, I am absolute lord and master—I alone, the undisputed Tyngall!—and there is none who would dare to anger me!” These words were spoken with an assurance, an air of self-importance that could not but sober the hearers a little. The laughter died from the girl’s lips; the man’s attitude became rigid and controlled. Though neither of them doubted that they were face to face THE LORD OF TRANERICA 21 with a lunatic, they also realized that he might prove dangerous if goaded too far. “I see that you question my asser- tions,” continued Spratt, still with a frown. “You would not only challenge my integrity; you would deny the evi- dence of your own senses. They say you ancients were a stubborn crowd, who wouldn’t believe much of anything, except a lot of gibberish accepted on faith. But I never suspected how stu- pid you could be. However, if what you want is more proof, you shall have it!” Even as he spoke, he pulled a lever, and a panel on the wall rattled open, re- vealing a glass partition facing the river. Below them, for endless distances, the huge black bulks of the “Hives” tow- ered on both sides of the stream. “Look!” commanded the dictator. “Then tell me if you had anything like that in the twentieth century!” The man and girl hastened to do as directed. At the first glimpse, they reeled a little, like persons who have been struck a blow; they gasped, and let out low startled exclamations; and the girl staggered against the man for support. “Harry! Harry darling!” she cried, in a half fainting condition. “Is it real? Or am I dreaming?” For several long silent seconds Harry continued staring at those colossal black structures that lined the river. Then slowly he declared, “I guess we’re both dreaming.” “No, no, we’re not!” she wailed re- viving and springing out of his arms as realization came upon her. “It’s true! It’s true! We—we’ve gone to another age! We’ll never—never see our own world again!” “Well, what of it, dearest?” he soothed, passing one hand consolingly over her glistening golden hair. “I still can’t believe it’s not some sort of trick. But even if it isn’t, we’ve still got one another, haven’t we? I suppose we can marry just as easily in the twenty-fifth century as in the twentieth?” “Not unless I give permission!” put in the Tyngall, glaring ominously at the speaker. I ’HINK, dearest, we hadn’t much *	except each other, had we?” con- tinued Harry. “My job as an airplane mechanic—don’t you suppose I could get something just as good in another age? Tell the truth, in some ways I’d be tickled. Think how neatly we’d be rid of all our pestering relations.” “Well, that’s so,” she admitted, look- ing up at him with an attempt to be brave; but her smile came through her tears. “Still, it’s hard to think that father — poor father! — must have passed away centuries ago, and we couldn’t even be there to say a last prayer for him.” “He looked pretty healthy to me last week—or five hundred years ago, when- ever it was—when he ordered me out of the house, so as to hitch you up with that swilling banker’s son. My God, Celia! when I think of that, it seems to me the luckiest thing that could have happened to us both was to get clean out of the century!” “Well, that is one way of looking at it,” she acknowledged, smiling and weeping all at once; and his arms gathered her into a close embrace. “Come, come!” interrupted the dic- tator, impatiently. “I can’t bear such maudlin sentimentality. You ancients are hard to understand. I should im- agine that, having found yourself in an- other century, you’d have something else to think of than throwing your arms around one another and cooing like two babes! ” Stung by the contempt in Spratt’s tones, the two strangers separated and looked up. 22 DYNAMIC Science Stories “Love-making in public is considered immoral nowadays 1” continued Spratt, severely. “However, being only two ignoramuses from the twentieth cen- tury, you couldn’t be expected to know that. So I’ll pardon you this time. But don’t let it happen again. It’s more than modern sensibilities can stand.” The man and girl said nothing, but still glanced at Spratt as if doubtful of his sanity. “Now let’s get down to something important,” he went on, hastily. “The question is, what am I to do with you? Well, I’ll decide in due time. First of all, it may be interesting to show you something of the modern world. It will be edifying to see your reactions. Be- sides, it may help me to break the mo- notony of life. So if you’ll come this way, we’ll begin our preparations.” Still without a word, the two visitors followed. But it was coming to them more and mone clearly that in some mysterious way, they were subject to the whim and command of this indi- vidual with the purple toga and the outlandish manners and speech. CHAPTER III A Realm of Wizardry IT seemed to both strangers that they had entered some fairy-book realm, where a wizard with his magical wand brought wonders to pass. For the Tyngall merely lifted a small steel rod, and waved it as might a musical conductor directing an invisible orches- tra; and instantly a partition in the floor opened and three little cushioned cars shot out, each moving on a pair of broad-based wheels arranged bicycle- fashion. Two of the cars glided up to Harry and Celia as if under intelligent direction; and after they had entered, one in each car, the vehicles darted away again, and whirled them through long lighted tunnels at what seemed breakneck speed. It was only a minute later when they halted in a room filled with long shim- mery rows of blue, green and crimson cloths, which hung from hooks on a ceiling fifteen feet above. “This is the dressery,” stated the Tyngall, who had followed close behind. “Naturally, if we are going to show you around, we’ll have to array you in respectable clothes.” “Respectable?” echoed both stran- gers, in one breath. “Of course. You hardly call those rags presentable, do you?” he de- manded, pointing to the visitors’ fan- tastic twentieth century apparel. “I suppose it did all right in your own day, when you didn’t know any better—but the world has advanced, my friends, the world has advanced 1 ” “You don’t expect me to put on a stage costume like yours?” demanded Harry. “Stage costume? Stage? You an- cients did have the most curious idioms! I merely wish you to dress sensibly and decently. And, o.f course, you’ll have to remove your red hair.” “What?” bawled Harry, with a dis- pleased glance at the dictator’s glisten- ing pate. “You mean, cut it off?” “Not necessarily. It will suffice to dye it black.” “I’ll be damned if I will!” “You’ll be damned if you don’t. Do you not understand, sir, we haven’t had a case of red-headedness in this coun- try for two hundred years.” “You talk as if it were something like diphtheria or scarlet fever!” “Well, in a way it is,” asserted the Tyngall, with a yawn. “You see, a few centuries ago the racial purists got con- trol of the government. They happened to be black-headed, and proved that THE LORD OF TRANERICA 23 black-heads possess all the highest spir- itual, intellectual and moral qualities. Lower in the scale were the brown- heads, but the lowest of all were the red-heads. This was demonstrated with statistics, compiled by black-headed statisticians. Hence the drive on the reds began. They were herded out of the country; jailed, stoned and burned; their property was confiscated, and their propagation was prohibited. In due time, consequently, their breed disap- peared. The movement was called by various names, such as the survival of the fittest and saving Tranerica for de- mocracy—though sometimes, to tell the truth, I’ve had my doubts. But the old prejudice persists, and today it would be as much as any man’s life was worth to appear in public with red hair.” ' I *HE Tyngall heaved a long sigh, ■* which was met with answering sighs from the girl and Harry. “Well, in that case,” decided the latter, after a si- lence, “I suppose there’s nothing to be done but dye my hair.” “Good! You show remarkable sense, for an ancient!” approved Spratt, beaming. And then, turning to the girl, he suggested, “and now, if you will pass that door to your left, sweetheart—no, no, I forgot, that’s not your name, is it?—anyhow, you will find a dressing room, with a mechanical maid to help you.” “Mechanical maid?” repeated Celia, wondering if she had heard correctly. “Of course . . . Didn’t you have mechanical maids in your century? . . . Well, well, well, just imagine! How did you women ever manage? Just go in there, sweet—I mean, young lady, and you will find out everything.” After the girl had left and the door had automatically closed behind her, Spratt pulled a little crank on the wall, and a long metal box at one end of the room clattered open. Out of this case there stalked what, at the first startled glimpse, Harry took to be a man—a man eight feet tall, and with long swing- ing limbs. A second glimpse, however, showed him that the being had no face other than two small gleaming electric orbs which served in place of eyes. Its arms and legs, as it came clanking across the room, were seen to be of iron; its trunk, beneath the gray toga which it wore, was obviously of the same sub- stance; its head bristled with electric batteries instead of hair; a coil of wires reached out from behind it, and there was a continuous buzzing from some- where in its heart. “Didn’t you have electrical valets either, in your day?” inquired Spratt, with a pitying expression, as the iron monster approached at a steady stride. “No, thank goodness!” declared Harry, retreating slightly, although he strove his best to hold his ground. But he watched in fascinated inter- est as the automaton halted just in front of Spratt, reached one long arm upward, plucked a violet toga from a hook near the ceiling, spread it out before the Tyngall, and deftly folded and removed the oil-smeared robe which Spratt doffed. The great seven-fingered hands of the machine, moreover, smoothed out and dusted the dictator’s new clothes after he had donned them; then, as if under intelligent guidance, turned to Harry and prepared to perform a similar service for him. “You see, the principle is simple,” explained Spratt, as be noted the dumb- founded amazement on his visitor’s face. “It works by radio control. Electrical impulses, which I discharge through the air by pressing a button or moving a switch or rod, are transmitted to very sensitive receiving bulbs within the valet; and then, by means of ampli- fiers—” But it is questionable whether Harry heard much of this speech. He was 24 DYNAMIC Science Stories too much occupied with the process of changing clothes; and was both amused and embarrassed to see himself pre- sented with an embroidered saffron- colored toga, with billowy sleeves and sea-green decorations. “By heaven,” he muttered, as he struggled to adjust the new garb, “it’s lucky my friends are dead five centuries, and can’t see me now!” TIE had hardly completed his dress- A ing when the dictator, by turning a screw, caused the door to their left to open, and Celia emerged, arrayed in black pantaloons like those of Chinese women, and with an open-necked un- decorated black jacket. “Good Lord, don’t I look atrocious?” she exclaimed, blushing. “Is this how all women nowadays are dressed?” “Naturally,” returned the Tyngall, in slightly offended tones. “You can’t ex- pect them to wear gaudy clothes like us men, can you? Since nature gave them so many graces and charms, what need have they of rich garments to en- hance their beauty? It isn’t as with us poor males, who need yvery bright col- or to conceal our natural drabness.” “You look good to me, Celia, in any clothes,” Harry sought to console her. “And you—why, good gracious, Harry, you look like a one-man vaude- ville show!” cried the girl, with a sud- den burst of laughter, as she caught her first full view of her lover. “One-man vaudeville show? Vaude- ville show?” repeated Spratt. “That’s something else I’ll have to make a note of. I wonder whether it’s in the dic- tionarry.” And then, looking up with a sudden new briskness of manner, “Well, now that we’re all nicely dressed, let’s start on our little journey!” Before they set out, however, Spratt remembered to procure a botde of some inky substance, which was rubbed on Harry’s hair by the mechanical valet and changed it to the color of tar. “Ah, now you look almost modern! ” ex- claimed the Tyngall, approvingly, as he stood back a few feet to examine his metamorphosed visitor. “It’s clear, after all, that red-headedness is only skin deep!” “Now we’ll clip off those hairs from your face,” continued Spratt, indicat- ing Harry’s moustache. “The ancients had a name for it, I can’t remember what. No man nowadays would dream of growing such a brush under his nose.” It was useless for the victim to pro- test. The electrical valet produced a pair of shears, and set to work; and Harry thought it wise not to resist too strenuously, lest some accidental mo- tion cause half of his lip to be forfeited. “Heavens, dearest, if I didn’t know it was you now, I’d never believe it!” commented Celia, ruefully, as she sur- veyed her transformed lover. “A great improvement, I’m sure!” contributed the Tyngall. “And now let’s see, just where shall I take you first? Perhaps to the Mills. In that case, we will need some special ear pro- tectors.” He pressed a button, and three black instruments looking like ear-phones slid in through a pneumatic tube. “Put these over your ears, friends,” he in- structed. “Otherwise, the din would deafen you.” The others did as directed, and then seated themselves again in the little cushioned cars. Away they rushed, so rapidly that the wind whistled by them; along twisting, vaguely lighted corri- dors; down abrupt descents; then up steep grades, and down once more. They had no idea where they were go- ing, and were relieved when at last the cars halted and they found themselves before a huge steel door in a shadowy room reminding them of a railroad wait- ing station. THE LORD OF TRANERICA 25 KTO sooner had the Tyngall joined *	~ them than the steel door groaned and opened—and all at once they rea- lized why they had had to wear the ear protectors. Even through the muffling fabrics, they could hear an uproar like that of several boiler works combined —a continuous pounding, hammering, stamping, clanging noise as of countless great iron masses in violent contact. They found themselves stepping into an enormous hall—a hall several hun- dred yards long and almost equally wide. Its ceiling, supported by scores of branching steel pillars, rose to a height of three hundred feet; its win- dowless walls were featured by clusters of white lights so bright that the spec- tators had to blink and shield their eyes; while a fine dust arose everywhere, ir- ritating the throat and nostrils. All along the floor of this colossal hall, in dozens of mathematically even rows, were machines that towered to a height of thirty or forty feet, with an intricacy of clattering spindles, thump- ing rods, whirring wheels, and rotating chains. And before each machine there stood a figure that would have seemed fantastic beyond belief had the observ- ers not already known of the mechan- ical maid and valet. Fifteen feet in height, with iron limbs and body, each of these figures was exactly like every other; each was made in the image of a man, except that its hands were nine- fingered, that it had three electric lights where the face should have been, and that wires ran in and out of its legs and head. And each, standing stiff and erect, was operating with clock-like reg- ularity. First its hands would shoot up, moving the levers of the machine before it; then down with a crash the hands would come, then, after a sec- ond’s rest, they would rise again, in precisely the same movements as be- fore; and the motions of all the ma- chines were so perfectly synchronized that one was reminded of a well trained military company executing drill ma- neuvers. For a minute the strangers looked on, appalled and fascinated; then Spratt motioned them away. • And after the steel gate had closed behind them and they were back in a place of relative quiet, he removed his ear protectors, and declared, “It isn’t good to remain too long—very damaging to the ears and nervous system.” “What under heaven is it?” asked Harry, awe-stricken. “Why, the Mills, of course,” replied the dictator, in the manner of one ex- plaining to a stupid child. “But where are the men?” “What would men be doing in that Inferno? Do you think we are so back- ward as to let human beings work in the Mills?” Harry and Celia both stared and looked blank. “Why, ever since the Humanitarian Reform of the last century, we’ve had machines to run our machines. We find mechanical laborers as far superior to flesh-and-blood laborers as motor cars are to the animals which used to pull your carts—what do you call them?— I’ve forgotten the name.” “Horses,” prompted Harry. “As far superior to living man as mo- tor cars were to horses. Besides, they have other advantages. Mechanical laborers never grow tired; they never talk back to the boss; they never strike for shorter hours or higher pay; they never shirk, or get drunk; they never form unions, or commit sabotage; they never have to be pensioned off in case of illness or old age; and their efficiency is never disturbed by any psychological quirk. All in all, they constitute the perfect solution of the past labor prob- lem.” “But do you need no living men at all?” 26 DYNAMIC Science Stories “\7ERY few. The machines rarely v break down. All we require is an occasional superintendent, and a small corps of experts who direct the mechan- ical workers by remote radio control. The Mills you have just seen are among the largest in Tranerica, but they’re many others built on the same plan.” “What do they make in this one?” inquired Celia. “Mechanical workers. Manufactur- ing mechanical workers is, in fact, one of our major industries.” “But that means that most human beings are thrown out of work,” pointed out Harry. “The unemployment prob- lem must be simply terrific.” “Terrific? What’s that word?” de- manded the Tyngall. “Oh, you mean, very bad? Well, to tell you the truth, it was quite troublesome before the Age of Readjustment. But my great-great granddad, Hannibal Fairchild Spratt the Third, hit upon the ideal remedy. You’ll learn all about that in due time, when we get to visiting the Hives. Meanwhile, don’t you want to see a little more of the Mills?” “Very gladly!” exclaimed the two strangers. And once more they entered the little cushioned cars, and went shooting away through corridors and tunnels. CHAPTER IV The Hivites IF the visitors were astonished at their first glimpse of the Mills, they were to be sheerly bewildered by their later discoveries. They were taken to the Furnaces, where mechanical workers twenty feet tall wielded shovels as large as five-passenger automobiles, and cast tons of coal each minute into gigantic fires. They were brought to the Construction Room, where mechanical workers measured, riveted and carried huge steel beams and girders; they were introduced to the Warehouses, where automatic arms packed and assorted thousands of bales and crates with scientific exactness; they were given glimpses of electrical laborers that scrubbed floors and that painted walls, that plastered and that drove nails, that crawled to fix pipes and drains, that sat at workstools, and that adjusted the lights of the ceiling with their long slender arms. Eventually the party stopped for re- freshments at a little inn where the viands were brought to them by me- chanical waiters, after being prepared in automatic ovens by mechanical cooks. Next they descended to a point far below ground level, where great vaulted caverns supported by concrete columns spread for miles. All along the ceiling and Pillars were clusters of bril- lant white lights, so dazzling that the visitors had to be ]. rovided with sun- glasses; while endless rows of glass cases, separated by narrow aisles, were spread across the floors. Each of these cases was filled with water, which varied in depth from two or three inches to several feet; and in this water green things grew in crowded profusion, in an atmosphere as warm as a hothouse. The visitors were surprised to see ripen- ing tomatoes, strawberries and cante- loupes; while the enticing reds and yel- lows of apricots, plums and cherries greeted them from low, dense clusters of trees. “You see here an example of scienti- fic agriculture,” stated the Tyngall. “Over a century ago we solved the chemical secret of sunlight, and hence are able to reproduce its properties in the white lights you see all about you, so stimulating the chlorophyll of the plants to form starch, sugar and cellu- lose out of water and carbon dioxide. THE LORD OF TRANERICA 27 All agriculture nowadays is accom- plished indoors, where we are not de- pendent on the weather.” “But your plants don’t seem to have any soil—only water!” pointed out Harry. “Naturally not. It has been known for centuries—in fact, I shouldn’t be surprised if it was common knowledge even in your own day—that all that plants need for growth is water, with the proper chemicals in solution. We take care to supply these in sufficient quantities—and as a result production is rapid and continuous. I forget the exact figures—but I believe it has been proved that one acre under cultivation nowadays can produce as much as five hundred acres by the primitive meth- ods.” While the Tyngall was speaking, the visitors’ attention was attracted to a mechanical worker, equipped with par- ticularly long slender arms, who came clanking down one of the aisles, pluck- ing the ripe fruit from the trees and depositing it in a large open box fast- ened to his waist. “You see, farm labor also is entirely mechanized,” continued Spratt. “Even the cows are milked automatically. You have no idea how this simplifies things.” “VV7HAT I don’t understand,” re- *	v marked Harry, as he observed how efficiently the mechanical orchard- ist gathered the fruit, “is where the men and women are. Is your whole world inhabited by machines? Do you real- ize, Mr.—-Mr. Spratt, I think it is—” “Call me Tyngall Spratt and show proper respect!” roared the dictator. “I do not know what Mister means!” “Tyngall Spratt,” continued Harry, undaunted, “do you not realize that we haven’t seen any living person except yourself? As far as we can judge, you might be the only man alive in the twenty-fifth century!” “Well, you shall see, you shall see very soon,” promised the Tyngall. “I do not know the exact figures the me- chanical statisticians broke down at the last census, two years ago—but it is believed that the population of North Tranerica alone is not less than two billions. Shall I take you now to the Hives?” Harry and Celia both nodded; and, accordingly, they left the basement farms in their little cushioned cars, and wove their way hundreds of feet upward by long winding ascents. “I really must apologize for the Hives,” Spratt warned them, before they set out on this new expedition. “They are not as ideal as we could wish, since they date back to the twenty- second century, and were originally built to house working families. But now that the Reign of Leisure has be- gun, we’ve had to adapt them as best we can—” “Reign of Leisure?” questioned Celia. “To be sure. Since the machines per- form all our services, no man needs to work unless he wants to. In fact, there’s no way for most men to work even if they do want to. They are regularly supplied with all necessities—and their days are one long golden opportunity.” “Opportunity for what?” questioned the skeptical Harry. “Opportunity to develop their higher qualities. But you shall see. Come, let’s go.” A few minutes later, having been whisked several miles away, they halted in what seemed to be an enormous dor- mitory. On each side of a corridor sev- eral hundred yards long, a succession of dozens of doors opened; and each door led to a room or a group of several rooms provided with steel furniture and illuminated by electric bulbs built into the walls. None of them, so far as the strangers could see, had a window open- 28 DYNAMIC Science Stories mg to the daylight. “This is a typical floor in one of the Hives,” explained the Tyngall. “Each Hive is a hundred and twenty stories high; and there are hundreds of Hives in Hudson Highlands alone. You have seen the compartments occupied by in- dividual families—” “Compartments? You mean, apart- ments,” corrected Harry. “No, I mean compartments. This word, modern authorities agree, is much more accurate of the two. But let’s go on. I will now show you how the Hivites pass their time.” “Hivites?” “Yes, the inhabitants of the Hives— in other words, the common people. The great masses, who would have had to work for a living in a less fortunate age.” Both Harry and Celia, naturally, were eager for a glimpse of the Hivites. But their enthusiasm would have been considerably dampened could they have foreseen the adventure that lay in wait. “I THINK we will go first to the Day *	Rooms,” continued the Tyngall. “The chambers where the Hivites pass their daily fourteen or sixteen hours of leisure.” “Don’t they ever go out of doors?” inquired Celia. “Out of doors? Why should they?” returned Spratt, wrinkling his nostrils with a disgusted expression. “Why should any one go out of doors when modern improvements have given us perfect heating, perfect lighting, and perfect air conditioning indoors? No, no, my friends, we don’t take any chance of exposing ourselves to the cruel winds, or the blistering sun! That may all have been very well in ancient times, when people couldn’t help them- selves; but nowadays we are civilized!” A few minutes later they stood in a hish-ceilinged corridor before a series of enormous gates, each marked “DAY ROOMS” in blazing red letters. The Tyngall pressed a button, and one of the gates rattled open; while half a dozen mechanical guards, each ten feet tall, stalked out and surrounded the party. “What I do not understand,” re- marked Harry, as they entered the Day Rooms in the midst of the guards, “is that sometimes I see you pressing a but- ton or switch to move the mechanical workers, and at other times they seem to act by themselves, almost as if they had an independent power of thought.” “Yes, it does seem that way,” ad- mitted the Tyngall, “but they are al- ways under human control. The work- ers in the Mills and farms, for example, are all guided by radio waves shot out by operators in a central station, who keep track of their movements by tele- vision. In the same way, our guards now are under remote control. But I’m surprised you have to ask about such simple matters. In your own day, didn’t you have robot airplanes that could be guided by radio? And weren’t you able to set type hundreds of miles away by wire? What we have done is merely to make the natural advance upon such elementary beginnings.” There was much more than the Tyn- gall said in explanation; but neither Harry nor Celia heard him, for they were both absorbed in observing the Day Rooms. They found themselves in a series of cavernous connecting halls, with wide vaulted ceilings supported by concrete columns. The whole had been laid out on the plan of a park; graveled walks wound among lawns and patches of shrubbery, and here and there were lit- tle ponds where water-lilies blossomed and swans lifted their heads. But the green spaces, pleasing as they were to the eye, were largely hidden from view by the swarms of people, who crowded THE LORD OF TRANERICA 29 everywhere-as thickly as on the central business street of a large city. Upon Spratt’s appearance, hundreds of them flung themselves on the ground, with cries of reverence and adoration, and shouted, in voices that sounded al- most automatic, “Tyngall! Oh, Tyn- gall! Hail Tyngall!” Many, creeping like animals on all fours, would have come close to kiss the hem of the dic- tator’s robe, had not the swinging arms of the mechanical guards kept them away. Many others, standing erect, gave a military salute; but all alike kept repeating the same cry, which dinned about them with maddening insistence, “Tyngall! Oh, Tyngall! Hail, Tyn- gall!” The visitors noted that the men and children all wore bright-colored togas— purple and lavender, apple-green, sap- phire-blue and ruby-red—while the women were all clad in unadorned brown, gray or black. None of the men were bearded, and most of them were bald, like the Tyngall; they were all milky pale of complexion, with a ten- dency to baggy eyes and heavy paunches; and many had long, drawn faces, with down-curling pessimistic lips that seemed most surprising in view of the boundless leisure they all en- joyed. OUT how did they pass their leisure? The two strangers were fascinated to note the occupations of the Hivites. Here and there little groups, sprawled on the grass, were absorbed in shuf- fling minute colored patches of card- board, and from time to time would break out in loud disputatious cries. Here and there little bands were play- ing with small balls, which they threw into the air and caught; and here and there parties of youths were engaged in racing contests, or in exhibitions of box- ing and wrestling. But a much more popular recreation, apparently, was to lie under a bush and sip a colored bever- age out of long-necked bottles—in fact, it seemed that fully a quarter of the Hivites were enjoying this sport con- stantly. And meanwhile fully another quarter were gathered about little clat- tering machines, shouting in high agi- tation as they dropped pebbles through tiny slots, and threshing furiously and yelling like wild beasts when a red dial registered the results. “What are they doing?” questioned Celia, wondering if she had not strayed by mistake into a lunatics’ ward. “Merely passing the time,” replied the Tyngall. “You see, it’s quite a prob- lem with the Hivites, what to do with all their time. So they’ve invented this little game. They’re gambling for peb- bles.” “Pebbles? But what use are peb- bles?” “None at all. However, since we don’t have any money nowadays, we’ve got to have something to keep the Hivi- tes amused. Pebbles will do as well as anything.” At this instant their attention was distracted by a frenzied outburst, where two of the pebble-gamblers had fallen upon one another, and were pounding and slashing at each other’s faces as if hent on murder. “Fraud! Cheat! Bandit!” they both screamed, in out- raged voices, “He’s robbed me! He’s robbed me! Cheat! Ruffian! Brigand!” And they tore at one another until they were both bruised and bleeding and their togas were ripped to shreds; while the crowd stood about them eager and delighted, and goaded them on with taunts and yells. “But what’s it all about?” demanded - Celia. “If they’re only playing for • pebbles—” “The psychology of the Hivites is very peGuliar,” explained the Tyngall. : “Having nothing more important to think about, they hoard theif pebbles, \ 30 DYNAMIC Science Stories and consider them priceless. But let them fight it out! A little quarrel now and then helps them to break the mono- tony of life.” With a shrug, the dictator passed on; and pointed to a walled gray enclosure of about the size of a large house. “Do you want to go in?” he suggested. “That’s the library.” The visitors entered, but found to their surprise that there was no other occupant, except one old man who was dozing at the end of a long table, with several great tomes lying open before him. The books, which lay stacked about them in innumerable shelves, were covered with deep layers of dust; the covers were all age-worn and cracked, and a smell of must and age pervaded the establishment. “The Hivites, I’m afraid, don’t care much about reading,” declared the Tyn- gall. “They say the pace of modern life is too fast. They haven’t sufficient lei- sure—” “But I thought you said they had nothing but leisure 1” gasped Celia. “Yes—but not for reading. That re- quires concentration. Oh, by the way, over there is the case of ancient books. Dates way back to your own time. May- be you’d like to glance at it?” ' | ’HE Tyngall strode over to a shelf *	where the dust was even deeper than elsewhere, and plucked out a volume at random. “Collected works of Bernard —Bernard what’s that?—Shaw, I sup- pose it is,” he deciphered, with difficul- ty. “Wonder who he could have been? I’ll have to instruct the librarian to go over this place sometime, and clear out a lot of this worm-eaten trash.” Celia in turn pulled out a volume, glanced at it with a stare of surprise, then turned about to exclaim, “What do you think, Harry! Here’s ‘Gone with the Wind!’” But her words died half uttered. Had Harry also gone with the wind? He was no longer at her side—in fact, he was nowhere in the library! With fluttering heart she ran to the entrance, crying as she went, “Dearest, dearest, where are you? Where are you?” But the pandemonium of the throngs outside drowned the tones of her voice. When she reached the library door she saw only the dense crowds billowing about her, throwing their lit- tle balls and playing with their bits of colored cardboard. Harry had vanished as completely as though the earth had swallowed him! CHAPTER V The Tyngall Proposes FOR a long, silent moment Celia stood staring into the heedless multitude. Then an excited cry came once more to her lips, “Harry, Harry, where are you?” Some of the passers-by looked up, a little curious, then returned to their games with shrugs and comical grimaces; while, at the same time, she felt a hand clutching at her shoulder. Wheeling about with the happy thought that Harry had come back, she found herself gazing into the pouchy face and small gray questioning eyes of the Tyngall. “What is it, my lady?” he inquired. “You act as if you have lost something.” “I have,” she declared, gloomily. “I —I don’t know where Harry is.” The Tyngall did not appear dis- turbed. “Well,” he returned, with a smile, “we mustn’t let little things annoy us. Really, I don’t mind in the least, so long as I have you.” “But I’m afraid 1 mind consider- ably,” she protested, not liking the way he beamed upon her, with a half pos- THE LORD OF TRANERICA 31 sessive smile. “Come, let’s look for him.” “What’s the use?” objected Spratt. “It would be very hard to find him. “You see, we haven’t numbered him yet.” “Numbered him?” “Of course. All the Hivites have numbers: for example, AX 56765, or ZY 420421. That’s how we keep track of them. When oncc a man has lost his number, or hasn’t a number at all, there is no system of tracing him among all the millions of Hivites.” Celia still stood gazing disconsolate- ly out into the crowd, straining her eyes to catch a glimpse of a tall, familiar fig- ure. At any other time she would have been absorbed in what she saw: the women amusing themselves by regard- ing their own images long and steadily in full-length mirrors; the little ma- chines in which the ladies put their faces, screaming with pain while the wrinkles were being ironed out; the pairs of lovers strolling arm in arm, the youths and girls jesting and quarreling as they bustled past; and the gay par- ties singing and shouting. Bat all this meant nothing to her, for nowhere could she find any sign of the one she desired to see. “Come, let’s step insfde, where we will be by ourselves,” said the Tyngall, taking Celia’s arm and leading her back into the library. There they found themselves entirely alone; for the drowsy old man, interrupted in his slumbers, had arisen with the grumbling complaint that “Even in the libraries nowadays there’s no privacy,” and had stumbled off with a book under his arm. “I do hope Harry will find his way back here soon!” exclaimed Celia, growing more alarmed moment by mo- ment. “Well, what if he doesn’t?” inquired Spratt. “To tell the truth, young lady, that would suit me just as well. Yes, in fact, it would suit me a great deal better. It might have been very bother- some for us to have him around.” “For us?” echoed the girl, peering at the Tyngall with a sudden sharp sus- picion, as she backed into a gallery of books marked, Medieval: Twenty-First Century. “Then was it you—was it you who—•” “No, no, not I, young lady!” inter- rupted the Tyngall, waving one hand in a gesture of denial. “By my mechanical boots! if I had schemed to get rid of him, I could have found an easier way!” UT you will help me find him, won’t you? Won’t you?” begged the girl, looking up at him with eyes of clear blue innocent appeal. “If fate has seen fit to remove him,” asked the Tyngall, sententiously, while he leaned against a time-worn shelf of the twenty-third century neo-classical poets, “then why should I refuse the gifts it proffers? I believe I shall enjoy your company very much better with- out him.” “Oh, you—you are horrible!” ac- cused the girl, retreating with tears in her eyes. “Not at all, young lady. Merely hu- man. Though I do live in the twenty- fifth century and am a Tyngall, I am able to appreciate one of nature’s works of art in the shape of a fair woman. You would not believe it, but my life has been a very lonely one.” “I don’t see why that should interest me!” “Come, come, you are not so short- sighted as you pretend. It ought to in- terest you very much. There are mil- lions of women who would throw them- selves down on their knees and offer up thanks at the prospect of having a Tyn- gall in marriage.” “A Tyngall—hi marriage/” Celia had by this time backed to the 32 DYNAMIC Science Stories extreme end of an alcove labeled: “His- tory of Tranerica: Rise of the Tyngall Spratts.” The dictator stood barring her exit—and escape seemed impossi- ble. “Oh, Harry!” she offered up her silent prayer. “Won’t you come? Won’t you come back soon?” “My high position,” continued her persecutor, in plaintive tones and with a wistful look in his eyes, “has made me meet too many women—and too few. They have swarmed about me, bent on matrimony; a Tyngall, as they well knew, would be a rare catch. You can’t blame them of course; but, natur- ally, I didn’t want to be caught. So I have remained a bachelor, though my heart cried out for the comforts of home and family. You are the first eligible lady I have ever met who didn’t want to marry me. Consequently, I couldn’t help falling in love. Let me congratulate you on your good fortune 1 My empire is at your feet! You shall be the "first lady in Tranerica!” Spratt ended with a flourish, and reached out his arms as if to enfold the object of his devotion. But she managed to take from the bookshelves a dusty tome on “Diplomatic Intrigues of the Twenty-Fourth Century,” and imposed it between her and her suitor as a sort of shield. “Mr. Spratt,” she began to protest, in cool and haughty tones. “I—” “Tyngall Spratt!” he corrected, scowling. “Always address me as Tyn- gall Spratt!” “Tyngall Spratt,” she amended, “I should be flattered, I suppose, at your attentions—” “Not at all,” he denied. “It is the just reward of your merits!” “I should be flattered,” she con- tinued, “but you forget that I am al- ready engaged.” “Pooh! What of it?” he scoffed. “I abrogate the engagement!” “You also forget,” she protested, angrily, “that I do not want it abrogated!” “Your wishes in the matter, my dear lady,” he returned, suavely, “are of no importance whatever. Remember, it is I who am accustomed to giving orders! When shall we place the date of the happy event?” OTILL secretly praying for Harry’s return, Celia glanced along the aisles of books, desperately wondering if there were not some way to slip past the Tyngall. “I’ll admit,” continued Spratt, sol- emnly, “it never occurred to me I was to marry a girl five hundred years old. But that doesn’t matter, I suppose; you really don’t look your age at all. One wouldn’t think you were a day over nineteen.” “I’m only eighteen!” specified the girl, trying hard to keep back the tears that flooded to her eyes. “Well, well, well! And you’ll be the Tyngalless of Tranerica in less than a month! Let’s see! It’s now the first of January. January thirty-first was the day when my celebrated ancestor, Hannibal Fairchild Spratt the Great, made his historic march to power. What more natural than that this day be chosen to solemnize the tie which, we may reasonably hope, will perpetuate his line?” Celia made a struggling effort to reply, but her sobs prevented. “Now, now, now, dear lady, don’t let your emotion overcome you,” soothed the Tyngall. “It’s natural that you should weep tears of joy. Shall we not leave now, and go up for a lover’s chat in the Crystal Room of my castle?” Still the girl continued to weep, but the Tyngall meditated in a pleasant vein, “I’ll have a busy month ahead. Sending out the announcements to all Tranerica—it will keep the air-waves THE LORD OF TRANERICA 33 busy. Many women’s hearts will be broken—but, alas! that can’t be helped. I’m sure I couldn’t find a worthier mate in all Tranerica, even if she does come from a barbarous century!” Meanwhile, between her sobs, Celia mumbled brokenly, “Harry! Harry! Where are you, Harry?” And her heart was heavy within her, for still her lover did not return, and she felt as if by in- tuition that some evil had befallen him. CHAPTER VI Amid the Mazes HILE Celia was examing the volumes in the library, Harry had strolled to the entrance of the building; for books had very little interest for him. Once out- side, he had wandered a few yards away, to observe some individuals who were pasting some scraps of tin foil in a large folder marked “Curio Collec- tions.” From the absorbed interest with which they were preserving and label- ing various worthless fragments of colored paper, Harry judged them to be not quite right in the head; and he was smiling pleasantly to himself, and re- flecting on the superiority of his own age, when he saw a rush of excited men bearing down upon him. “What is it? A football charge?” he had barely time to ask himself, before he was caught by the mob and forced to rush along with them in order not to be trampled. Being a powerful man, he might soon have extricated himself; but curiosity had taken possession of him; and when the crowd halted with shouts and yells before a fenced en- closure containing a circular roadway, he halted with them and pressed for- ward to a position among the foremost. “The jigger races! The jigger races!” he heard them clamoring. “Hurrah! Hurrah! The jigger races!” And his neighbors began arguing loudly as to who would win, and bet hundreds of pebbles on the results. A moment later dozens of little cars, each about as large as a motorcycle and running on gyroscopic wheels, were brought upon the track, which was per- haps two hundred yards around and ten feet wide. A single rider mounted each vehicle; and almost instantly, at the blast of a whistle, they began whirl- ing about the track, some going to the right and some to the left, but all mov- ing so rapidly that they seemed mere gray blurs that passed with a whistling as of a great wind. “What is it all about?” wondered Harry; and decided that the object was to see how near the riders could come to one another without hitting, for they constantly seemed to avoid collisions by a hair’s breadth. Not always, how- ever! for in a minute there came a thunderous crash, accompanied by a burst of flame; and, after water had been applied from a hydrant above, the shapeless remnants of two machines and their riders were swept away by a me- chanical attendant. “Curses!” he heard a profane voice to his left. “By the blue lightnings, what luck! I’ve lost seventy pebbles!” Even as these words were uttered, there came a second crash—which took two more machines and two more lives. But no one seemed disturbed, except certain pebble-losers, who grumbled loud and mournfully. The Jigger races; as Harry was afterwards told, were among the main sporting events of Tra,- nerica—and although they cost a few million lives a year, no one begrudged the cost except a few stiff-backed hu- manitarians; for they served to kill time and to amuse the multitude. But Harry, not being a native Tra- nerican, lost his taste for the sport after 34 DYNAMIC Science Stories witnessing the third fatal collision. As hastily as he could, he forced his way out of the crowd, glad that he had been born in a more enlightened age. IT was then that, with sudden sharp *■ ness, he remembered Celia and the Tyngall. “By Jove!” he told himself. “They’ll think I’ve dropped through a black hole in the earth!” And he set out hastily to rejoin them—only to pause in bewilderment. His surround- ings were unfamiliar! On all sides, as before, were lawns and shrubbery, crowded with people, and reaching to the extreme ends of the wide, intercon- necting halls. But where was the lib- rary? “Good Lord,” he mumbled, half aloud, “I didn’t watch my directions!” And then, tapping a passer-by on the shoulder, he inquired, “Beg pardon, friend, could you tell me the way to the library?” The man looked up startled, and re- garded him with surprised watery eyes. “Why should you beg pardon?” he de- manded. “You have done nothing to me. But you make a mistake in calling me friend. I have never seen you be- fore.” “All right, all right,” interrupted Harry, impatiently. “Cut out the gab, and tell me the way to the library.” “Library?” returned the man, look- ing puzzled. “Never heard of such a place.” “I mean, where they keep the books.” “Oh, the book-museum—as the boys like to call it! Yes, I do believe there’s one somewhere around, but I couldn’t tell you where. Haven’t time for such things myself. I’m too busy collecting tin foil.” The man stared at Harry peculiarly, as one might at a harmless lunatic; then went ambling on his way. “Gosh, but they have strange types in this century!” Harry reflected; and immediately accosted another passer- by and repeated his question. “Library? What do you want to get to the library for?” inquired the second stranger, a purple-faced individual with a cask-shaped abdomen. “There’s noth- ing there to drink! ” He likewise did not know tbe way; and this was the case with the third, the fourth, the fifth, the sixth and the seventh person that Harry stopped. He now thought of asking a police- man; but as there were only mechanical guards, who were not educated to an- swer questions, he had to dismiss this idea. It then occurred to him to request to be taken to the Tyngall. But the individual to whom he put this sugges- tion—a grave-looking bent old man— appeared horrified and at a loss for a reply. “Evidently, sir,” he finally said, “you are not a Tranerican. Most likely you’re from Paneura or Afasia or some other remote region. Even if I couldn’t tell that from your tone of voice, I would be sure of it from your question. Every Tranerican knows that no one can ever be taken to the Tyngall with- out being summoned.” “But I was with the Tyngall, and lost him by mistake! ” A skeptical smile cross the old man’s face. “I have lived too long, sir,” he said, severely, “to be gulled by trans- parent falsehoods! The Tyngall does not associate with common people! ” With that the old man turned con- temptuously on heel, and Harry had to resume the weary task of questioning strangers. But all without results! No one knew the way to the library; no one would believe that Harry had actually seen the Tyngall. Many inquired his number; and, being told that he had none, they spit in disgust, or whirled about and refused further speech with him; for a man without number was a man without civil position, an outcast, THE LORD OF TRANERICA 35 a pariah, a person beneath contempt. From gallery to gallery Harry wand- ered, a deep uneasiness gnawing away within him, while nowhere could he see any sign of the library, and gradually the suspicion overcame him that each step he took was bringing him further from his goal. DEWiLDERED and disheartened, he slumped down on a stone bench beside a fountain. By now, he realized, Celia must be in agonies at his absence; she would imagine that some grave mis- hap had befallen him. And he him- self, as he thought of her alone in this strange century with no one to protect her but the Tyngall, felt half distracted. What would become of her should she remain at the mercy of that unbearable Spratt, who already, as Harry had an- grily noticed, had cast ogling eyes at the girl? But was there not still some way to find the library? Was there no guide- book to point out the direction? With this hope in mind. Harry leapt to his feet again, and hailed a passer-by, who proved most obliging, but stated that he had never heard of any guide-book. A second passer-by, however, offered more definite information—yes, indeed, there was a directory to all the Day Rooms. But where was it to be found? The man scratched his head, and then, after a moment, joyously gave the an- swer. The guidebook was in the li- brary! But since the informant, like the other Hivites. did not know the way to the library, Harry found himself no better off than ever. Disconsolately he started on his way again, through wide galleries, branching and interconnecting with maze-like in- tricacy, and apparently endless in ex- tent. After a time his attention was at- tracted to a crowd of men and women who stood, hundreds deep, before a little closed gateway, shouting and gesticu- lating, and furiously pushing and shov- ing to get to a front position. Above them, on the wall, a huge megaphone projected; and from it a bawling voice proclaimed monotonously, “One only will be required! One only will be re- quired! Form your lines to the left!” But far from forming lines, the men and women made only a writhing mass, squirming and squeezing, with bruised shins, bloodied noses and blackened eyes; while fresh recruits came rushing from all sides. “What is it? A convention of luna- tics?” Harry asked addressing a sen- sitive-looking tall young woman who stood by with a faintly amused expres- sion on his clear, candid countenance. “I see you’re a foreigner,” replied the young man, courteously “A native wouldn’t have to ask questions. What you see here is a crowd of candidates applying for a job.” “Applying for a job? But I thought—” “Thought that no one here has to work? Of course not! But most of us get so bored that when a job is open we fight for it like maniacs. There’s no pay naturally; it’s merely something to pass the time. You see, a few super- visors are needed to operate the me- chanical workers by radio control; and also some inspectors to look at the fac- tories now and then. Not enough to keep one man in a thousand occupied. That’s why there’s such a scramble, whenever a new job is open.” I TARRY had started to walk away *	with the young man, whom he rather liked; while from behind him rang the yells, screams, groans and snarls of the rapidly growing throng of job seekers. “What’s your number, sir?” inquired his new acquaintance after Harry had vainly asked him the way to the library. 36 DYNAMIC Science Stories “I’m afraid I haven’t any,” Harry was forced to admit. “No number?” A furtive expression came into the stranger’s face; he pressed close to Harry, and whispered into his ears, “Neither have I! ” “Not for three years already!” he added, in barely audible tones, in re- sponse to Harry’s puzzled glance. “You see, I’m a dangerous radical. I don’t like the Tyngall system of government. I believe it leads to dry rot of the mind and spirit. There’s nothing to do— nothing to strive for. It’s my idea that most of the mechanical workers should be scrapped, and men put back on the jobs. That’s what is called ‘subversive doctrine.’ On account of my youth, I was paroled on my first offense, with the loss of my number. The second offense would mean death.” “Your views sound pretty sensible to me,” declared Harry. “Guess I’m a dangerous radical myself. But what do they call you, if you haven’t any num- ber?” “My friends call me the Lightning Bolt. That’s because I’m always so im- petuous about everything.” “My friends call me Harry. Harry McNear.” “McNear? Harry McNear? What strange antique-sounding words! Well, Harry, since we’re both numberless, maybe we can be friends!” The hand of the Lightning Bolt shot out, and Harry took it warmly. And thus was sealed the bond of fellowship between the son of the twentieth cen- tury and the son of the twenty-fifth. As the two wandered away together, a gong rang above them, and signs of excitement became evident among the men, women and children crowding the shaded walks and lawns of the Day Rooms. The reason for their agitation soon became visible in the shape of a company of mechanical workers, who strode in carrying great trays heaped with viands. Harry was reminded of the genii of the Arabian Nights, of whom he had read as a child; but there was something more familiar in the way the multitude swarmed forward, each person eager to be first in snatching the delicacies from the trays. “What’s the matter? Isn’t there enough to go around?” inquired Harry, as he saw how avidly the people pushed and grabbed, not taking time to sit down, while swallowing the food by great gulps. “More than enough!” replied the Lightning Bolt. “It’s simply an old habit—inherited from a time when, they say, many couldn’t be sure if they would have butter for their bread. The same rush occurs three times every day.” Harry and his new-found friend waited until the multitude had been fed; then, approaching one of the me- chanical workers, helped themselves to some vegetables, fruit and cakes from one of the trays. DUT they had hardly finished their ^ repast when they were startled by the sound of a siren. “That’s the signal to leave the Day Rooms until tomorrow,” declared the Lightning Bolt. “We’ll have to go up to our com- partments for eight or nine hours of sleep.” “But I haven’t any compartment,” stated Harry. “No? Then there’s been some over- sight on the part of the mechanical room clerk. But don’t let that disturb you. You can share my compartment, if you wish.” “I’d be ever so much obliged, if it wouldn’t put you out.” “Not at all. I live in three rooms with another numberless chap—we’ve plenty of spare space. Having no num- ber, you see,” he added, in a mournful whisper, “naturally I couldn’t hope to THE LORD OF TRANERICA 37 find any girl willing to marry me.” While the Lightning Bolt was speak- ing, Harry observed that several huge gates were swinging open, and that mul- titudes of little cushioned cars were waiting outside. Into these the people began pushing their way, trampling one another in their haste. But the Light- ning Bolt, who seemed a most sensible person and did not at all live up to his name, gently took Harry’s arm and led him in another direction. “Let’s walk,” he suggested. “It’s simpler, and saves a lot of trouble.” The next moment, he and Harry were springing side by side up long spiral iron stairways. CHAPTER VII A Fresh Blow Yes, we’re pretty comfortably located here,” remarked the Lightning Bolt, as he entered his compartment and turned the electric switch, which threw a flood of subdued radiance across three connecting rooms. But Harry, as he surveyed those win- dowless chambers which exactly resem- bled the ones he had seen with the Tyn- gall, was surprised to notice that every- thing was as bare as a house after the tenants have moved. “Where’s the furniture?” he demanded. “Why, just where it should be,” re- plied the Lightning Bolt; and pressed a button on the wall. Instantly several steel chairs unfolded themselves from hidden niches, and rattled into position. At the same time, the Lightning Bolt pressed another button, and a table un- folded from the floor; while a third but- ton caused a collapsible couch to clatter into place. “You see, everything is arranged for convenience,” continued the proprietor, as he turned a screw and a faint cool current of washed air began to blow over them. “We can’t expect to have everything as comfortable as the Tyn- gall, but we have little to complain of in that line—no, not in that line!” Even as he spoke, the door opened, admitting an alert little man with a long intellectual face and keen restless eyes. “Oh, Ciph, I was waiting for you!” the Lightning Bolt greeted him. “I want you to meet my friend. He’s one of us—hasn’t any number. Call him simply Kar—no, Har, I think it is— Harry!” “A strange name!” commented the newcomer, extending his hand. “But I’m always glad to meet a numberless man, Harry.” “This is my roommate and best friend,” the Lightning Bolt introduced, clapping “Ciph” affectionately on the shoulder. “Since he has no number, we call him the Cipher.” “Cipher?” echoed Harry. “Yes, you see, that indicates what they thought I amounted to,” continued “Ciph,” in a brisk voice. “After I lost my number, my old friends abandoned me; they called me the Cipher in rid- icule—and the name clung.” “But how did you come to lose your number?” “Oh, I happened to get careless one day. I was having an argument with a friend, and the question arose whether it was possible to conceive of a wiser and more humane system of life than that of the Hives. I answered with a rash Yes!; for sometimes I got tired of seeing mechanical workers all around me and would have lived to do things for myself. Very incautiously I raised my voice, and was overheard, and re- ported. My statements being construed as a criticism of the government, I lost my number. Luckily, I was able to bring influence to bear with the judge— 38 DYNAMIC Science Stories which accounts for the fact that I’m still alive.” “Criticism of the government is trea- son,” explained the Lightning Bolt. “Usually the suspect is executed on gen- eral principle. Hence the government is not very much criticized.” T TNTIL late in the night (or, rather, ^ the period that passed for night, since all time divisions in the Hives were arbitrary), Harry sat up talking with his new friends, whom he came to like more and more as the hours wore on. He learned that both were secretly op- posed to the Tyngall and his adminis- tration; and that thousands of others, likewise, were discontented, but did not dare to speak their minds; in fact, the subject of revolution had often been broached, although nothing in that line had been attempted for many decades. This knowledge, however, put a daring idea into Harry’s mind—an idea on which he was to act far sooner than he could have anticipated. The following morning, after spend- ing a few hours tossing on the “spare couch” which his new friends had pro- vided, Harry bathed in a fountain of warm water and was shaved by a me- chanical valet; then accompanied the Cipher and the Lightning Bolt to the Day Rooms, where mechanical waiters were passing back and forth with the breakfast trays. “Do you know where the library is?” Harry asked the Cipher as a matter of course when they had eaten; and was astonished to receive a reply in the affirmative. “Yes, I often go there,” said the Ci- pher. “People think it dreadfully old- fashioned of me.” “Show me the way!” demanded Harry, although it was hardly to be expected that, after nearly twenty-four hours, Celia could be found there. Yet to the library they hastened— only to find the building empty. “Don’t see how on earth I’m going to trace her now,” Harry lamented, feel- ing as if the whole world were collaps- ing about his shoulders; for he had cherished the hope that at the library he would find, if not Celia herself, at least some message from her. “No, I don’t see how you’re going to trace her,” coincided the Lightning Bolt, who had heard Harry’s whole story. “It would be as much as your life is forth to try to communicate wdth the Tyngall.” “But doubtless the Tyngall will take good care of her,” contributed the Ci- pher, consolingly. “Yes, too damned good care!” mut- tered Harry. At this point their discussion was in- terrupted by a thunderous voice, which broke out with startling suddenness: “Attention! Attention! Attention, all Hivites!” Hastening out of the library, they found that the voice issued from a series of megaphones high up on the wall. “The radio!” mumbled the Lightning Bolt, a little awed. “It’s only on state occasion that the radio speaks like this!” “Attention! Attention! Attention, all Hivites!” repeated the megaphones. And people on all sides, children and adults alike, halted in their chattering and their games, and stood staring with wide-open mouths and gaping eyes. There ensued a second of silence that seemed almost unnatural; then once more that booming voice sounded from the megaphones: “Attention! Attention! All Hivites, attention! A momentous announce- ment, and one of great good omen, is to be made by His Preeminent High- ness, Tyngall Hannibal Fairchild Spratt the Seventh!” “Tyngall! Oh, Tyngall! Hail Tyn- gall!” cried the people, in a confused chorus; while they flung themselves THE LORD OF TRANERICA 39 down and kissed the earth in token of respect to their ruler. TV TOW from the megaphones there *	' poured a different voice—and one which Harry thought he recognized: “My people, I know that you will re- joice with me on this day of great good fortune. I have tidings which will, I am sure, bring murmurs of happiness to the lips of you all. For a long while, as you know, my fate has been a lonely one. My well wishers have long urged me to unite my lot to that of some fair lady, and so give the country a Tyn- galless, as well as the promise of an heir to the name and fortunes of the illustrious family of Spratt. But until the present moment, unable to choose among the countless superb daughters of Tranerica, I have lived in dismal bachelorhood. Now, however, I have decided to change to a more blessed lot. My nuptials will be celebrated on the thirty-first of this month.” The megaphone grew silent; and the people also remained dumb for a mo- ment. Then, as the full meaning of their leader’s announcement forced it- self upon them, pandemonium broke forth. There were cheers, yells and shouts: “Tyngall! Oh, Tyngall! Hail Tyngall! Hail Tyngall! ” Tears glis- tened in many eyes; numbers of women burst out weeping. And many men leapt about and damned with jubilant cries. In Harry’s heart, also, there was great rejoicing. “Thank God!” he reflected. “Now that the old devil’s engaged, may- be he’ll let Celia alone! ” “The number of the bride,” the voice from the megaphones rumbled on, while every one once more stood at attention, “may not be revealed just yet. But she comes, needless to say, of high and dis- tinguished lineage; her pedigree has been traced back more than five cen- turies. In order, however, that my peo- ple may early come to know and love the face of their future Tyngalless, I will order it to appear on the television screen.” It was but the work of a minute for some mechanical workers to enter and erect television screens under the meg- aphones. And it was less than five min- utes before a fair womanly face, larger than life-sized, appeared upon the screens with photographic distinctness, and in its natural colors. As he gazed up at those features of the innocent pansy-like grace and flow- ing golden hair, Harry gasped, groaned, clenched his fists, and mumbled some- thing that sounded like an oath. His day had turned black and blank. The face on the screen was that of his be- trothed ! CHAPTER VIII Stroke Follows Stroke OW, my dear young lady, isn’t it just about time you stopped these foolish objections? It’s all right, I’m told, for engaged people to quarrel once in a while, but you’ve done nothing but quarrel. You should have a better sense of the dignity of your position!” Up and down the glittering length of the Crystal Room the Tyngall stalked, his hands clasped behind his back, his brows comprcssed and scowling; while at one end of the hall a golden-haired figure sat in a hunched position, her face buried in her hands, her sobs coming forth in half-suppressed spasms. “These tears, dear lady, are getting very tiresome,” continued the dictator. “I’ve always heard the female sex re- quired much humoring, and, by the great name of Spratt! haven’t I done everything possible to humor you? 40 DYNAMIC Science Stories However, my patience has its limits. There are not many persons who would risk exhausting the temper of a Tvn- gall! ” “But I don’t want to marry you! I never said I wanted to!” came a pitiful voice from a corner of the hall. “Nonsense, dear lady! A silly preju- dice! Who wouldn’t want to marry a Tyngall? You don’t mean to say you’d rather have that long-faced, carrot- haired, ox-shouldered brute that accom- panied you here from the twentieth cen- tury?” “He’s not an ox-shouldered brute!” denied the girl, rising with fists clenched. “And ysu’ve taken him away from me! You’ve hidden him! I don’t know what you’ve done to him! I went him back! I want Harry back! I want him back, do you understand?” With one foot she stamped vigor- ously on the floor, while she stood facing him combatively, with flaming eyes. “Who would ever have thought that such a mcck-looking violet would show such spirit?” meditated the Tyngall. “Doubtless such wild and primitive pas- sions were common in the twentieth century. But there is no use complain- ing, dear lady. The date of the mar- riage has been set. The whole country is awaiting the event. Harry is a little incident you will have to forget.” “Never!” denied Celia, again stamp- ing on the floor. “Never is a word you should not use carelessly, my lady. Sometimes, years hence, when you sit on your high throne, the mother of Tyngalls and Tyngalles- ses, you will think back on these events, and smile at your youthful folly in wanting to wed a plebeian. Meanwhile, in order to help you forget, I forbid you ever to mention this red-haired beast— this Harry, as you call him.” “And what if I refuse?” demanded the girl, glaring at him out of her in- flamed tear-wet eyes. “Refuse?’’ Spratt took a stride across the room, paused to light a cigarette brought to him by a moving hand op- erating in a socket along the wall, and then turned coolly back to his intended bride. “Refuse? No one ever refuses the Tyngall. It just is not done, dear lady. There are—well, there are meth- ods at my disposal.” “You can't threaten me!” she chal- lenged, standing up to him defiantly. “'THREATEN you?" returned the A Tyngall, between puffs at his cig- arette. “That’s the last thing I would think of. This man of yours—this Harry—would be the one to meet the bill. As I’ve told you, it would be very hard to find him, since he has no num- ber—still, if I ordered it, we might lo- cate him. In that case, he would be sorry he had come to the twenty-fifty century!” , Celia’s face had suddenly gone white. “But you wouldn’t!” she pleaded, “you wouldn’t take it out on Harry—” “Why not, dear lady? Naturally, I should dislike extreme measures. But if you cannot drive Harry out of your mind, I shall have no choice but to put him out of the way. Very regretfully, of course—but very decisively!” Celia gasped; then, sobbing once more, hurriedly turned aside. The Tyngall stood looking after her with a vexed expression. “An accursed nuisance, these women!” he muttered to himself. “But you’ve got to show them who’s master!” After another puff at his cigarette, he pressed a wall-button, which sent two mechanical maids clattering to the serv- ice of his bethrothed. Then contempla- tively he crossed the room, and stood looking out of the immense window down toward the Hudson and the black Titanic masses of the Hives. “Some- where over there,” he ruminated, “is this nuisance of a Harry. But he will THE LORD OF TRANERICA 41 not be there much longer, unless his friend knows how to forget very quickly I” *	* * The Tyngall would have been even more displeased at the thought of Harry could he have witnessed certain events that had occurred in the Hives an hour or two before. After receiving the news of Spratt’s engagement and seeing the face on the screen, Harry had wandered away like one in a fog. His head was reeling; his fists were clenched; rage and terror fought for mastery of his mind. So suddenly, so unexpectedly had the blow descended that at first he could not grasp its full import; he could only re- alize, with a blazing indignation, that Celia had been snatchcd from him; and bewilderment and a sense of baffled im- potence mingled with a bitter desire for revenge. In the confusion of those first mo- ments, he scarcely noticed where he went or what words came from his lips. “Damn the Tyngall!” he muttered, quite audibly, to give some outlet to his inflamed feelings. “Damn the Tyngall! Blast his soul to hell! I’ll get the dog for this! I’ll get him, I’ll get him yet!” He was hardly aware how crowds gathered about him, staring with wide, unbelieving eyes as he uttered these pro- fanities; nor did he take any note of his friends as they hastened to his side and muttered warnings into his ears. “For your life’s sake,” chided the Ci- pher, “have you gone out of your head? Hold your tongue, hold your tongue!” “Silent, if you value your breath!” cautioned the Lightning Bolt. “What has come over you, that you want to commit suicide?” “May the Tyngall and his kind be damned forever!” swore Harry, still too angry to heed any warnings. “The cursed swine! to lay his dirty paws on my girl—” Most of the crowd looked grave and shocked at this impiety; one or two gasped with horror. But on several faces smiles appeared, and from some- where in the rear a titter was heard. “Hurry! Let’s get out of here while there’s still time!” the Lightning Bolt urged, plucking at Harry’s sleeve, in the attempt to draw him away from the throng. But even as he spoke, there came a sound that made him stop short, with a groan of despair. From the opposite end of the room, a bell began to clang with heavy metallic peak as of a fire alarm. Sharp, insist- ent, and continuous, the niose was such as to drown out all conversations. The mob, as if petrified, stood glued in their tracks, their eyes gleaming with excite- ment, their agitated murmurs inaudible amid the din. After about a moment, the bell be- came silent; but even while the echoes still vibrated ominously, a distant clanking was heard, rapidly growing louder. “By the crown of the Tyngall!” ex- claimed the Cipher, mournfully. “Some one has rung the treason alarm! ” “But can’t we still get away?” cried the Lightning Bolt, glancing about him like a caged animal. But the multitude hedged them around with hostile hands uplifted and malevolent eyes. It was only a minute before the clanking had grown to ear-splitting proportions; and half a dozen mechan- ical grimaces and screeches and yells gether furiously as if thus to make themselves appear more terrible, shoul- dered their way forward. Guided un- erringly by remote radio control, they formed themselves in a circle about Harry and his two friends, and then be- gan marching away with the three pris- oners in their midst, to the accompani- ment of a loud thump, thump, thump 42 DYNAMIC Science Stories that sounded a little like the tramping of an army. Behind them, with com- ical grimaces and screeches and wells of derision, the rabble followed; and stones and bits of earth came shower- ing in their direction. At the further end of the hall, the mechanical guards halted. One of them reached down, and opened a circular panel on the wall, revealing a slanting tube about a yard across; while a sec- ond drew forth three steel shells, each a little over six feet long, and just wide enough to fit into the tube like a key into a lock. They then thrust each of the captives into one of the containers; after which there came a rattling sound, and the lid slipped down. Forced irresistibly into the little steel box by the iron hands of the guard, Harry felt that his last moment had come. As the cover rattled to a close above him, and he found himself in utter darkness in a space so small that he could move but a few inches in any direction, his heart leapt with terror at the thought that he was being buried alive; and he called out with cries that, he well knew, no one could hear, and beat against the steel walls until his fists bled. Then suddenly he was aware that he was in motion. There came a swishing, hissing sound from outside; his head tipped downward, and only his heavy mat of hair saved him from serious injury as he banged against the front wall; he rolled from side to side, and could not control his movements. IN that bewildered, terrified moment, *■ he had given up all hope. It was al- most with a shock, therefore, that he felt his steel container grating to a halt, saw the cover slide open above him and was greeted by the welcome glow of clectric lamps. Still feeling stunned, he arose a little awkwardly, and found himself in a fair-sized room lined with intricate- looking machines. Just in front of him his two friends were also emerging from steel shells. Both looked dazed, and the Lightning Bolt was nursing bruises on his shins and arms; but both, like Harry, seemed glad to find themselves still alive. “It really was nothing,” declared the Cipher with a forced smile on his lean sagacious face. “I’ve often heard how terrible it was to ride in the pneumatic tubes, but after all, it’s worth while to have had the experience.” “You see, the tubes are ordinarily used for freight,” explained the Light- ning Bolt. “But sometimes, as you have observed, they’re employed for vicious criminals. That’s considered part, of the punishment.” “Wonder what they’re going to do with us now,” mused Harry, as he glanced curiously at the various ma- chines that lined the room—machines each about ten feet, high, with huge and complicated dials, a multitude of con- necting wires, and long ribbed steel pro- jections and rubber tubes that wound into the air like the feelers of an octo- pus. “Why, there’s no doubt what is to be done next,” stated the Cipher, in a matr ter-of-fact manner. “We’re to be tried.” “Tried?” “Certainly. By the Mechanical Judge.” One of the iron workers had come clattering into the room as these words were spoken; and, with swift move- ments, seized the left wrist of each pris- oner, and attached it to one of the pro- jecting rubber tubes. Instantly little wheels moved on the machines, a low growling was heard from within them, and the dials began slowly turning. “What do you mean by a Mechanical Judge?” demanded Harry; while the iron worker took his right hand and made him hold a knob connecting with THE LORD OF TRANERICA 43 an electric wire. “A Mechanical Judge,” the Cipher declared, “represents the height of ju- dicial advance. Now that all decisions are machine-made, we can be sure they will be uniform quality. We can also be sure they will be swift, efficient, and positive. Besides, the Mechanical Judge cannot be bribed.” “No, but they say he can be fixed,” contributed the Lightning Bolt. “But how can you get decisions by machine?” asked Harry, with a skep- tical smile. “The thing is impossible.” “Far from it!” denied the Cipher. “The principle is really very simple. Why, didn’t they have lie detectors long ago, so far back, I believe, as the twentieth century? We’re merely en- larged upon the same idea. Everything that happens to a man, you see, leaves its reaction in his nervous system, and in his blood stream. Each incident, cach thought arouses a faint electric current—very weak, it is true; yet a sufficiently powerful machine, with strong amplifiers, can register it and interpret it by its wave-length. So, if a man has treasonous ideas—” I_IE was interrupted by a growl from *■ one of the machines—a growl which sounded exactly like that of a bulldog. “The Mechanical Judge is getting ready for his decision,” remarked the 44 DYNAMIC Science Stories Lightning Bolt, his hands fluttering with excitement. “What! Is that the Mechanical Judge?” cried Harry, pointing in astonishment to the machines. “Of course! Didn’t you even know you were being tried?” “No, I didn’t realize it,” admitted Harry, with a rueful glance at the rub- ber tube attached to his left hand, and the wire connecting with his right. And then, looking up with an attempt to be cheerful, he smiled, bowed toward one of the machines, and continued, face- tiously, “I trust Your Honor will be good to us!” A loud grumbling from inside the machine was the immediate response. “Sure the Mechanical Judge never makes mistakes?” Harry went on, a little nervously. “I’d hate to see the wrong decision.” “Have no fear,” returned the Cipher, mournfully. “They say his record of convictions is nearly one hundred per cent.” The next instant there came a sudden snapping sound from inside the largest machine, and a red hand shot up, along with some crimson notations. “Prisoner Number i,” read an arrow pointing in the Cipher’s direction, “ZX i.” . . . “Prisoner Number 2,” said an arrow aimed at the Lightning Bolt, “ZX 2.” . . . “Prisoner Number 3,” announced an arrow that indicated Harry, “ZX 3.” “That’s the decision, of course,” stated the Cipher, extricating himself from the rubber tube and wire. “There’s a table at the end of the room to interpret the code.” All three hastily made their way across the room, and could hardly keep from groaning as they read: “ZX 1, Guilty of treason in the third degree. Confinement for fifty years. . . . ZX 2. Guilt of treason in the second degree— Confinement for life. . . . ZX 3. Guilty of treason in the first degree. Execution in thirty days.” CHAPTER IX The Conspiracy a LMOST before the three unfortu- /\ nates had had time to grasp the J. meaning of the sentence pro- nounced upon them, they were herded together by a corps of mechanical guards and forced once more into pneu- matic tubes. After another bewilder- ing flight through the darkness, they emerged in a long corridor marked in huge black letters: “LOWER CLASS RESIDENTIAL QUARTERS.” Not until later did Harry learn that by “lower class” the sign really meant “prison population;” for the meaning of the terms had altered in the course of the centuries, until the two were re- garded as synonymous. Feeling like one who has been dealt a stunning blow on the head, Harry al- lowed his mechanized jailors to prod him through several steel-barred gates and one or two winding iron hallways; while the Lightning Bolt and the Cipher accompanied him with drooping fea- tures and desolate eyes. Finally they reached a series of large connecting electrically lighted galleries or caverns, reminding Harry of the Day Rooms, except that there were no lawns or trees, but only concrete floors and patches of gravel and sand, overarched by a high vaulted ceiling supported by steed col- umns. In these spacious reaches, thou- sands of men and women were gath- ered, engaged in various tasks and pas- times which seemed to Harry to con- trast strangely with the occupations of the free citizens. It tended to take his mind off his own troubles to watch these prisoners, who THE LORD OF TRANERICA 45 did not at all meet his preconceived con- ception of “jailbirds.” Here a man, bespectacled and patriarchal-looking, would be studiously reading from a hoary old tome; here a young scientist would be poring through a microscope, and making notes and drawings; here a painter would be standing with his pal- ette and brushes, or a sculptor with a half finished bust; while some of the inmates were filling immense volumes with pencilled notations, others were practicing at musical instruments, and still others were gathered into little knots, soberly talking. From the finely developed faces, the massive brows, the keen eyes of the prisoners, Harry was at once aware that these were persons of a different type from those in the Day Rooms. It was evident at a glance that they were the most talented, the most intellectual rep- resentatives of the twenty-fifth cen- tury I “Is this really the prison?” asked Harry, in wonder. “Isn’t there some mistake—” “No, there is no mistake,” returned the Cipher, grimly. “This is the prison, all right.” “Or, as they prefer to call it, the lower class residential quarters,” amended the Lightning Bolt. “It might be all right for a few days,” declared the Cipher, with a sigh, “but as a resort for the next fifty years, I don’t exactly fancy it.” “Think of me!” pointed out the Lightning Bolt, enviously. “I didn’t get off with a mere fifty years! They gave me life!” “I have only thirty days!” groaned Harry, thinking of his impending doom. “Yes, lucky fellow! Your misery will soon be over!” returned the Light- ning Bolt, in a congratulatory manner. “T DON’T know what he’s done to de- *■ serve such preference!” mourned the Cipher. “A swift and painless end —electrocution by one quickly deliv- ered radio bolt—and then nothing more to worry about for all eternity! Too bad, too bad not every one can have such good fortunte!” “What do you mean?” demanded Harry, more than a little irritated. “Do you think I came from the twentieth century just in order to be electrocu- ted?” “There are worse fates than that! Yes, there are worse fates than that!” sighed the Cipher. “Think of my fifty years!” “Think of my lifetime!” moaned the Lightning Bolt. “I’m only twenty- eight. And modern science has made such frightful progress I may live to be a hundred!” “Well, I’m going to live to be a hun- dred, too—if I can find any way!” as- serted Harry. “Do you think I'll he down and let myself be executed just because a machine condemned me? Not on your life! I’ve got thirty days yet—and a lot can happen in thirty days!” “Not in the prison!” lamented the Cipher. “You mean, the lower residential quarters,” corrected the Lightning Bolt. “What I’m wondering,” reflected Harry, as he looked out across the wide hall at his multitudes of fellow victims, “what I’m wondering is if some of us down here can’t get together, and bolt for freedom.” “It’s no use,” mumbled the Cipher. “There’s nowhere to bolt to.” “Still, aren’t most of us pretty much in the same boat?” Harry went on, dis- regarding this remark. “Same what? Same boat?” came in one voice from his two friends, to whom this twentieth century idiom was un- familiar. “I mean, we’ve all got nothing to lose but our chains. Any of these other 46 DYNAMIC Science Stories folks here sentenced to death?” “About half, I should say,” estimated the Cipher. “And the other half are in for twenty years or over,” added the Lightning Bolt. “The mechanical judge isn’t geared to give short sentences.” “Good! ” pronounced Harry, with en- thusiasm, as by degrees a daring plan took shape in his mind. “Then every one here is our natural ally. What if we were to rise up, all of us, and strike out—” “By the eyes of the Tyngall, not so loud!” interrupted the Lightning Bolt, as he clutched warningly at Harry’s arm. “No—if you don’t want to die by torture, keep your voice down!” coin- cided the Cipher. “Don’t you realize, the air tappers may get you?” the Lightning Bolt de- manded. “By their secret radio waves, they can listen in on conversations any- where. It’s getting so nowadays that nothing is safe that’s spoken above a whisper.” ITARRY glanced about him anx- *	* iously, as if to make sure that no one was within hearing distance. “It doesn’t matter where you are,” declared the Cipher. “They can hear you as well a mile away as a foot.” “Anyhow, you’ve got to listen to mel ” insisted Harry, in undertones. And he led his unwilling friends to a little hid- den niche between two great steel pil- lars, and prepared to unfold his scheme. “I’ve got just thirty days to work in,” he declared, hastily, but careful to keep his voice to a whisper. “In that time the Tyngall has to be thrown down, like the rat that he is, and we’ve got to make ourselves the lords of Tranerica.” “There have been others with the same idea, my boy,” nodded the Cipher, drearily. “In most cases a well-aimed radio bolt has ended their dreams.” “Why should it be a dream?” argued Harry. “Don’t you realize how vulner- able the Tyndall is? Why, he depends for his power exclusively upon the me- chanical guards and workers! ” “Very true—and each mechanical worker has from a thousand to ten thou- sand man-power,” sighed the Lightning Bolt. “Yes, but they are all controlled by small groups of men, are they not?” Harry went on hastily, incautiously lift- ing his voice, so that his companions had to warn him again. “The real rulers of Tranerica are the men that guide the mechanical workers. These are but few in number. If they were captured, or made to obey our will, we could move the mechanical workers as we wished— and it would be we that ruled Traner- ica.” “Yes, that’s so in a way,” admitted the Cipher, looking thoughtful. “The only question is how to capture the radio operators.” “It reminds me of the ancient fable of the mice and the cat,” contributed the Lightning Bolt, with a mournful grimace. “We’re all nicely agreed to bell Mr. Cat—the only question is, which hero is to attempt it?” “I don’t call myself a hero, but I’ll attempt it!” averred Harry. “That is,” he added, more soberly, “if I get coop- eration. One man alone can’t move a mountain.” “Well, I’m with you,” swore the Ci- pher. “At the worst, I may be rewarded by speedy execution.” “Me too!” concurred the Lightning Bolt. “I’m a desperate man, with sev- enty or seventy-five years looming ahead of me. I don’t think you have the shadow of a chance to win out, but if I’m lucky I may be caught and elec- trocuted.” “No reason you should be caught!” denied Harry. And then, drawing his friends more deeply into the niche be- THE LORD OF TRANERICA 47 tween the two columns, he glanced ap- prehensively in all directions; and re- sumed the discussion in a whisper. For several hours the conference con- tinued, while the three conspirators planned, weighed and debated. Grad- ually a more determined light came into the eyes of Harry’s two friends, as though they had been infected by his enthusiasm; gradually Harry himself began to show the signs of faint tri- umph; while his excitement, suppressed with difficulty, slowly mounted, and there was a fierceness in his manner, as of a would-be conqueror. The discussion was interrupted by the passage of several mechanical wait- ers bearing food—scanty and flavorless victuals, as compared with the abundant repasts enjoyed in the Day Rooms, but with the compensating feature that there was no wild rush to be the first served. Somewhat later, the lights were put out, and the prisoners were com- pelled to spend eight hows of darkness stretched out on the sand or gravel or on couches of straw; for the theory of the law was that, not been fully human, they were not entitled to humane ac- commodations. But all during the meal period and a good part of the time al- lotted for slumber, the whispered con- versation of the three plotters con- tinued; and by the following day their plans had begun to take shape. PYtFRING the next week or two, many furtive discussions were held in the Lower Residential Quarters. The Lightning Bolt, the Cipher and Harry were seen to pass continually from place to place, accosting likely-looking fellow prisoners; and the discussions they held always took place in some concealed spot and were conducted in whispers. Many of those whom they interviewed, it was later learned, were converted into apostles for the Cause, and began preaching in undertones to their friends and acquaintances, large numbers of whom in turn became ardent advocates of the insurrectionary movement. “Since we are condemned to death, or worse than death,” was their argument, “why not give our lives fighting?” But they were cautious to keep all such sen- timents scrupulously hushed, and not to gather in large or suspicious-looking crowds. In every heart there was the dread that some mishap or blunder, some unguarded or treasonous remark, would betray the plans and condemn the conspirators to the torture cham- bers; in every heart was the wild hope that the seemingly impossible would happen, and the first successful revolt in centuries would occur. All the prisoners meanwhile weighed and reviewed every detail of the design, examining and re-examining it so as to avoid every pitfall. And all looked for- ward in apprehension and fierce longing to the thirtieth of January, the day be- fore the Tyngall’s marriage, when three numberless men were to lead their thou- sands in a desperate gamble with fate. CHAPTER X At the Eleventh Hour FORTY-EIGHT hours before the time of his prospective execution, Harry was carried by one of his mechanized jailors into a large, bare, black-walled room. This was the “Death Chamber”; and here it was that scores of wretches, men and women of all ages, were miserably moping in an- ticipation of the bolt that was to end their existence. Some of these poor doomed persons cowered in corners, muttering to themselves; others ranged restlessly back and forth; still others stood apart and prayed; but in the frightened glances and hopeless looks 48 DYNAMIC Science Stories of them all was written the mark of the sentence that hovered above them. Meanwhile, in the interest of what was known as “humanized killing,” the final rites were being administered by the Mechanical Preacher. This was an iron machine built to look exactly like a man. It was dressed in a long flow- ing black robe, and wore a white collar, closed in front; it was equipped with a mask which, unless one approached very close, might have been mistaken for a human face; and it moved its hands with measured gesticulations and bent and unbent its creaking frame in a manner that appeared most life-like. Even its voice, which came forth in a melancholy drone, seemed natural and quite human, and a stranger might nev- er have known that there was a phono- graph cleverly concealed where its heart should have been, and that this reeled off any number of records in succession owing to an automatic electric adjust- ment. '‘Repent, and receive absolution for your sins,” the Mechanical Preacher was saying. “Repent, and receive ab- solution ! It is a long road that leads to spiritual redemption, but the punish- ment which is being meted out to you. my brothers, is for your own good no less than that of the State—” On and on in this vein the Mechan- ical Preacher went never-endingly. At first Harry found the long-winded mo- notonous sentences quite annoying, but after a time he did not even notice them; and he was told that this was the way with most of the prisoners. In fact, some of them spoke of the Preacher in the most favorable terms; for he served as an anodyne for pain, and helped to put them to sleep. For several hours after his confine- ment, Harry walked restlessly back and forth along the hundred-foot length of the Death Chamber. His eyes were tense and excited; they were filled with an eagerness, one might say an antici- pation hardly to be expected in one who was so soon to die. He scarcely ob- served his fellow prisoners; but almost constantly his gaze was on the great clock that dangled from the ceiling, as if he were anxious for his few remain- ing moments on earth to be ticked away. At last a gong sounded with a hollow note, like the stroke of doom; and a voice through a megaphone proclaimed: Visitin’ Hour! For the next sixty minutes, the inmates of the Death Chamber may receive their friends, in order to exchange final farewells!” N TO sooner had these words been ^spoken than the doors were thrown open, and hundreds of men, women and children came crowding in, crying, shouting, weeping and wailing as they threw themselves around the necks of relatives and friends and clung to them with despairing arms. Amid the throng of newcomers, Harry soon made out two familiar faces; and motioning to the Cipher and the Lightning Bolt, he led them to a corner of the room, where they could talk in relative seclusion. But, in any case, the commotion about them was so loud and continuous that there was little danger that they would be overheard. "Well?” Harry demanded, as much with a movement of his lips as in actual words. “Everything ready?” •‘All prepared to cut the wires?” “We have three men secretly sta- tioned with steel-cutting shears.” “How about the flash-lights?” “A thousand of them are hidden. Four of our comrades almost gave their lives to steal them from the warehouse when the mechanical guards were off duty.” “Good! And everybody is prepared to strike?” “Everybody. We but await your orders.” THE LORD OF TRANERICA 49 “Then let the time be the second hour before the night sleep! Now go— so as not to arouse suspicion!” “Good-bye—and may fortune bless our enterprise!” “May the helper of all good causes be with you, Harry! The risk is a desperate one—but we may win out!” Before leaving, Harry’s two friends both flung their arms about his shoul- ders, and burst into bitter lamentations —so as not to attract attention by be- having differently from the other visi- tors. Then, without so much as a final nod, they turned and were lost amid the multitude. But Harry, smiling, brushed back his heavy locks proudly, almost exultantly, and stood aloof in one corner, gazing out at the crowd with a forceful expectant light in his eyes. It was several hours later when pan- demonium broke forth outside the Death Chamber, in the heart of the Lower Class Residential Quarter. The commotion began with the suddenness of a dynamite discharge; all at once there arose a clamor of shouts, yells, screams, hoots and howls, accompanied by a noise of thumping, banging, and hammering. The occupants of the Death Chamber, rushing to the barred win- dows, were astonished to see hundreds of their fellow prisoners marching in rough military formation, equipped with sticks, rods and poles, which they waved in air or knocked against the ground or stone columns, while crying out at the tops of their voices. But most of all the spectators were amazed to hear that sacrilegious call dinning through the air, “Down with the Tyn- gall! Away with the Tyngall! A new government! A new government for Tranerica!” Hardly had the tumult begun than another and more ominous sound was heard in the distance. There came a booming as of thunder, accompanied by a rapid vibrant rattling, as of a nest of machine-guns in action; and a company of mechanical guards, each ten feet tall, came roaring forward with the speed of an express train. The watchers at the barred windows gasped; in another mo- ment, they thought, the machines would scatter the rebels like toy soldiers. Some averted their eyes, not wishing to see the red chaos of bodies trampled and torn; others cried out in apprehension, expecting in an instant to hear the yells of the mangled and dying. But just before the crisis, when the iron guards were within hand’s grasp of the rioters, an unforeseen event intruded. "\Y7ITH electrifying suddenness, the *	* lights went out. Not so much as a flicker of warning did they give; they flashed from existence to non-existence with the speed of a fading meteor. Blackness covered the prison chambers —blackness absolute and unbroken, ex- cept where here and there a firefly flicker, shot from the eye of a flashlight, wavered uncannily through the gloom. Yet from the darkness there strangely, fantastically rang a sound of merriment —a burst of laughter, wild and trium- phant, that rose in mocking peals and reverberations, like the glee of a vic- torious multitude. As he stood clutching the bars of the Death Chamber, Harry caught the con- tagion of that cry; and from his lips too there came something that sounded like a laugh; while his eyes, as they gazed out into the blankness, exuded tears of thankfulness. The first step in the plot, long and carefully planned, had been accomplished! The wires that supplied the prison with light had been out, and consequently the mechanical guards had been rendered useless; for they could be controlled only when seen through television reflectors by the re- mote operators! They were now stand- ing stiff and motionless, mere inani- 50 DYNAMIC Science Stories mate hulks of metal which no man need fear so long as they remained in dark- ness! While he secretly exulted in this first success, Harry observed that the second step was already being attempted. He saw a number of small flickering lights rapidly approaching, and knew that each was a flashlight carried by a small party of men. Then he heard a furious hammering and banging, and was aware that the bars of the Death Chamber, which had not been built in the expectation of any concerted as- sault, were giving way beneath the pum- meling of the mob outside. It was but a minute before iron truncheons had hammered down the doors and win- dows; and Harry and his fellow con- victs, shouting with joy, were received into the arms of their rescuers, who burst in through the torch-lit blackness like a conquering army. Then away they all rushed into the wider chambers of the general prison, where mysterious movements and bustlings were to be heard from amid the darkness and shadowy figures flitted back and forth like shades. And now they turned to meet a new menace; a glare as of a cluster of locomotive headlights appeared suddenly out of the distance, and moved forward with diz- zying speed, accompanied by the clank, clank, clank that told of the invasion of a new company of mechanical sol- diers. Side by side with the iron giants, two or three men were to be seen moving in agile little cars, guiding the troops as they thundered forward. Was the revo- lution to be nipped in the very bud? But no! just when the advancing mili- tia seemed about to crush the revolters under heel, the glare of the headlights grew dim and vanished; and the men in the little cars glided over to the rebels and mingled with them. The insurrec- tionists, acting through one of their number whose term in prison had ex- pired a few days before, had not neglected the precaution of enlisting the support of the flesh-and-blood workers that controlled the mechanical emer- gency troops! MOW began the most precarious step of all. “This way, boys,” whis- pered Harry, as some one passed him a flashlight; and, with the Cipher and the Lightning Bolt at his heels, followed by swarms of other supporters, he be- gan moving through the dimness to the extreme end of the prison, where a vent three feet across marked the termina- tion of one of the pneumatic tubes. Since the iron gates were locked and were much too stout to be taken by storm, the pneumatic tubes represented the only means of egrees from the Lower Class Residential Quarters. To attempt to escape through these long dark passageways would be hazardous in the extreme; there was no way of saying where the men would emerge, or whether or not they might not all be bottled up in a trap. But since no other means was possible, the risk was one that must be faced. “Keep within touching distance of each other—and be sure your flash- lights are ready,” directed Harry. And then, without hesitation, he drew down the iron lid of the pneumatic tube, and crept into the darkness. CHAPTER XI The Assault on Hive W IT seemed to Harry that he crawled for miles through that close, hot, lightless tube, his only illumination the feeble rays of the flashlight. At times the tunnel dipped sharply and he was on the point of slipping and break- THE LORD OF TRANERICA 51 ing his legs in the abyss; at other times it rose as sharply, and he could pull himself up only by the utmost strain- ing. Behind him he could hear his fol- lowers panting, one close after another, sometimes mumbling beneath their breath, sometimes growling oaths and curses; and he too felt like bursting into profanity as he moved slowly through the endless labyrinth. What if he should never find his way out at all? What if he and all his supporters should perish in these mine-like depths? Or what if one of the steel freight-carriers should come shooting through the tube and annihilate them all? He well knew that the electrical connections had been cut, making this impossible; yet his mind swam, and it was not possibilities alone that alarmed him. But at all times one thought was up- permost: the thought of the Tyngall, and of Celia; of Celia bright and smil- ing as when he had left her, and of Celia struggling in the dictator’s arms. And it was the latter vision which, standing forth lurid and feverish in his oppressed imagination, dominated and drove him on like a goad, until he would sooner have perished in misery than have thought of turning back. Yet was he not already too late to save Celia? It may have been after hours of groping through the tube that the flash- light at length showed a solid barrier ahead, and Harry knew that they were coming to a fresh phase of their ad- venture. To slip off the lid of the tube and emerge would now be a simple mat- ter—but where would they emerge? Would they thrust themselves straight into the waiting arms of their enemies? For a moment Harry hesitated, while he could hear his followers heavily breathing behind him. Then, with painstaking caution, he drew back the lid of the tube a fraction of an inch. A circular slit of dim light became visible; and Harry, putting one eye to the aper- ture, gave a satisfied grunt and opened the lid to its full width. A moment later, he had slipped out into a broad, faintly lighted corridor, which was unoccupied and bare except for a number of large cases piled up at one side. “It’s one of the storage rooms,” stated the Lightning Bolt, who had come out just after Harry. “Good! Very good! They’ll never look for us here!” “Well, now that we’re out of jail, I don’t propose to let myself be taken back alive!” Harry swore. “Which way shall we go?” TIE glanced about him uncertainly; *	* and, since one choice seemed as good as another, he turned at random to his left, and began moving stealthily along one of the walls, with his follow- ers pressing behind him in a long line. For several hundred yards they moved through the long, deserted gal- lery. Their steps were slow and muf- fled, their eyes alert for the sign of every suspicious presence. But no danger signal appeared; and they were feeling just a little more confident when, creep- ing around a turn in the gallery Harry found himself face to face with a sight that caused his heart to give a great leap and his whole form to shudder involun- tarily. A corps of eight mechanical guards, each twelve feet tall, stared at him al- most within touching distance! In a panic, he was about to turn and flee; but the Cipher, darting up behind him, drew him back with a restraining, “Come, come, there’s no danger! These guards are merely being stored here, and are not in use at the moment.” “Yes, but they may be in use very soon!” protested Harry. “Not if I can help it!” denied the Cipher. And he approached the fore- most giant, and, drawing open a little iron door in its trunk, revealed a num- 52 DYNAMIC Science Stories ber of glass bulbs, like the tubes of a radio. These he battered to bits with a steel rod; while some of his compan- ions performed similar services for the other seven guards. “That will fix them,” he said. “They are now about as useful as a motor can without a mo- tor.” “Or a man without a heart,” put in the Lightning Bolt. Again the procession started on its way, through a long series of storage rooms. “Do you suppose they know where we are? Do you suppose we are being followed?” was the question on every one’s lips. But nowhere was there any sign of pursuers, and it was as- sumed that their escape in the darkness had put their enemies off the trail. As they crept on their way, they took time to examine the crates and boxes piled about them. In some of the cases they found canned and dried goods, which they seized avidly; and bottled beverages, with which they quenched their thirst. But what Harry leapt upon with a shout of especial joy was a case of “riflecs”—a development upon the old-time rifles,—instruments as com- pact and easily carried as rifles and yet capable of discharging as many bullets as machine-guns. Arming himself and several score of his followers with these redoubtable weapons along with a suf- ficiency of ammunition, Harry for the first time felt capable of facing attack. “Just where do you think we are?” he paused to inquire of the Cipher, after they had wandered through other long, connecting storage rooms. “It seems as if we might go on forever like this, without ever getting anywhere.” “All the storage rooms are deep un- derground beneath the Hives,” stated the Cipher. “What we must do is try to work up.” A CTING upon this advice, Harry led his followers up several winding stairways to still other dimly lighted corridors, which also served for storage purposes. But he was as uncertain as ever of the way out; and in his heart a new fear began to gather—the dread that he would waste so much time amid these mazes that it would be impossible to strike before the Tyngall’s marriage to Celia. But when he was most tormented by this thought, a starded cry sent a new wave of hope rushing over him. “See that little green light down there—way down there!” shouted the Lighning Bolt, pointing toward the end of the corridor, two or three hundred yards off. “That means an exit.” “Yes—green is always the sign of an exit!” affirmed several of the others. When they had reached the indicated point, they observed a sliding platform, similar to the old-time escalators but much larger, which began moving upon the turning of a switch and bore them up several hundred feet. They now found themselves in a dimly lighted cir- cular chamber from which numerous hallways branched in all directions; while in the center stood a huge sign- post with colored pointers: “To the Day Rooms. ... To the Mills. ... To Hive M. ... To the Crystal Tower. ... To Hive J. ... To Hive W. . ..” But still they saw no sign of any other living creature. “Good! This is just made to order 1” exclaimed the Lightning Bolt, coming up and clapping Harry affectionately on the shoulder. “We’re still in the hours of sleep—or the nightime, as I believe you ancients called it. That’s why the lights are all dim and the place is de- serted. We’ll have to make the best of our opportunity before the hours of waking.” “If we could only find our way to the central office,” meditated Harry. “That is, the room where the radio engineers direct the mechanical workers by re- THE LORD OF TRANERICA 53 mote control!” “Then let’s go to Hive W,” suggested the Cipher. “I believe I’ve heard it said that Hive W is the place. On the hun- dreth floor, if I remember correctly—” “Yes, that’s it!” corroborated the Lightning Bolt. “It’s the very nerve- center of Hudson Highlands.” “I’m afraid we haven’t time before the hours of waking,” warned the Cipher, as the long column started stealthily away again. “If we’re caught —well, you know the probable end!” Hastening his footsteps, Harry made his way through intricate winding gal- leries, following a green line varied with an occasional arrow that read, “To Hive W.” At any moment, he knew, the wall bulbs might flash into brilliance, me- chanical guards might start clattering toward him, and he and his men might hopelessly trapped. It seemed a long while before a large sign in dull red announced, “HIVE W. First Floor.” But the real difficulties, apparently, only commenced when they started the ascent toward the hundredth floor. The stairways, narrow and tortu- ous, appeared never-ending; they pur- posely avoided the main passageways and followed dim back-flights among whose shadows each moment they ex- pected to see some lurking foe leap up. Thirty, forty stories they ascended; then, panting and half exhausted, had to pause for breath; then once more resumed the weary climb, constantly afraid that the reviving lights of the “waking hours” would catch them un- prepared. “Can it be that the Tyngall is laying a trap, and is waiting for us to step into it?” they asked, a little surprised that they had not been molested. But more and more they were be- coming convinced that their escape through the pneumatic tubes had been unobserved. ' I 'HEY had a little of the feeling of triumphant mountain climbers when at length a sign announced: “Hun- dredth floor: Division of radio opera- tion.” . . . “This way,” directed Harry, starting down a corridor bearing the placard, “To the Main Headquarters”; and he was congratulating himself upon being within a hair’s breadth of suc- cess, when suddenly, to every one’s con- sternation, a row of dazzling white lights burst out, flooding them with a radiance as of daylight. “By tbe eyes of the Tyngall!” groaned the Cipher. “The hours of sleep are over! ” “If we don’t retreat like a shot, we’ll be caught!” wailed the Lightning Bolt. “But where will we retreat to?” de- manded Harry, blinking beneath the sudden brilliance. “I’d just as soon be taken face forward as with my back turned!” “If you don’t hurry, it will be too late to turn your back!” insisted the Light- ning Bolt, making a sudden about-face. “If you think I have any craving for the torture chambers—” “Caught hot-footed as spies in the radio section—it’s a Grade A offense! ” lamented the Cipher. “To be torn limb from limb would be nothing by com- parison—” “Retreat at a time like this is the better part of valor!” sighed the Light- ning Bolt, as, amid a confused, panicky throng, he began pushing his way back with increasing speed. “Run, if you want, like cowards!” snarled Harry, seeing his whole revolt about to collapse. “I’m going on!” Firmly grasping his riflec, he strode forward a pace or two, while the others wavered and halted. Then involuntarily he stopped short, with a gasp of dismay. A doorway half a score of yards away opened, and eight or ten gaudily attired toga-wearing men dismounted from lit- tle cushioned cars. 54 DYNAMIC Science Stories To Harry’s overheated fancy, it was clear that his conspiracy had been tracked down—that the newcomers were the first of a contingent of police. But if he must die fighting he was at all events determined to sell his life dearly. Darting forward again he pointed his riflec threateningly at the newcomers. He was a little surprised to note the astonishment on their faces; the look of startled horror that possessed them all. For a moment they stood staring at him in amazement that showed just a little of incredulity, as if they could not quite trust the testimony of their own eyes. “What—what in the Tyngall’s name do you do here?” the foremost of the strangers at last demanded. “Don’t move one step—not one step!” warned Harry, turning his riflec toward the speaker’s heart. “What are you—a madman?” shot out the menaced one, indignantly. ND what are those fellow luna- tics of yours?” bawled a second of the toga-wearing ones, pointing to Harry’s followers, who had rallied and were drawing around with their riflecs pointed. “What can they want of us, mere inoffensive radio operators—" “Radio operators?” Harry echoed, a sudden light bursting upon him; and his head reeled at the giddy prospects that suddenly unraveled. “Radio operators? So you’re the ones that move the me- chanical workers?” “Yes—and you’re keeping us from our duties!” cried one of the victims, accusingly. “Until you let us go, not a laborer will lift an arm in the Mills, not a waiter will serve break fast in the Day Rooms, not a guard in the Lower Resi- dential Quarters—” “Enough! We have other duties for you!” Harry interrupted, sternly. “For- ward march—all of you! Into the engi- neering rooms! You will move the me- chanical workers and guards—but only as we say! Forward—unless you want some riflec bullets through your heads! ” The engineers hesitated. But, on all sides, they saw the iron muzzles pointed at them. Weaponless and outnumbered, they had no choice! Muttering curses and scowling, their leader slowly stepped forward, drew a key from his pocket, and reluctantly fitted it into the lock of a door marked “Central Engineering Room.” “We obey—under protest!” he barked at Harry, as he cowered beneath the rifle. "But who in the name of the green lightnings may you be?” “Me?” Harry drew out his chest, and stood proud and erect, an imposing figure of more than six feet. “I should advise you to be more respectful, sir, in addressing the next Tyngall of Tra- nerica!” CHAPTER XII The Ceremonies Are Interrupted IN the Golden Room of the Tyngall’s palace, the preparations had been completed. The heavy yellow met- al, which of old had been valued by tradesmen and bankers but was now used chiefly as an ornament, filled the spacious hall with its gleam and its glitter. Gold-leaf shone from the high fretted ceiling; gold-leaf glistened along the walls; the wide polished mirrors had frames of solid gold; there were golden trays and platters, and tables with gold tops; the very chairs were upholstered in gold-braided cloth, and the tapestries were gold-inwrought; while the busts and figurines that lit- tered the room were of the unalloyed metal. Into this sumptuous hall, early on the morning of the thirty-first of Jan- THE LORD OF TRANERICA 55 uary, there filed a notable company. High-ranking dignitaries, all of whom bore in their veins a drop or two of the noble blood of Spratt, came trooping in clad in their dress-togas of shimmer- ing lilac, orange, cherry or lemon; while their spouses, with their pantaloons and high-buttoned jackets of dignified brown or gray as became the gentler sex, accompanied them sedately, or fol- lowed in little chattering parties, bear- ing gifts of golden flowers or of fruits neatly fashioned in gold. Excitement was in the air, particularly where the ladies gathered in their fluttering groups. . . . “Oh, what do you think she’s like? ... I really don’t care for her picture. . . . They say she’s a for- eigner—Think of that! . . . Wonder where he could have picked her up? . . . Must be a very forward type, otherwise our Tyngall, poor susceptible man! would never have been taken in!” Such were but a few of the comments whispered from ear to ear as the com- pany gathered and at length formed it- self in a crowd hundreds deep. As time went on, gay strains of music, appro- priate to the occasion, filled the air from an unseen radio receiver; huge floral wreaths were borne in; and a song, “All hail the Tyngall!” was sung by a chorus of dozens of voices. Finally, amid an awed hush, the chief functionary ar- rived; a man bearing the honorary an- cient title of “Minister,” although he had long ceased to have any religious duties other than those of signing birth certificates and marriage contracts. All clad in a glossy golden robe, with a tufted golden headdress and golden sandals, he strutted into the room with a due sense of the dignity of his posi- tion—so much so that one might have wondered if it were not he rather than the Tyngall that was to be married. Time wore on; and the guests, amid their chirpings and gossipings, began to grow impatient. Every now and then the spectators would glance uneasily to- ward a little gold-enmeshed door, from which the bride and bridegroom were expected to emerge; but the door did not open, and anxious speculations be- gan to be circulated as the minutes dragged away. Even the Minister, tug- ging at his tufted headgear, beneath which he was sweating profusely, began to look irritated; although, of course, the dignity of his position forbade him to make any remark. 1WTEAN WHILE, behind the little gold-enmeshed door, the dictator stood glaring at his intended spouse, who sat hunched up in a chair, her tear- stained face buried in her arms. “Come, come, dear lady,” he haran- gued, in tones of great annoyance, “this is a fine way to carry on! Not for noth- ing did the ancient sages call women the most unreliable creatures that ever walked the earth. Here the wedding guests are all assembled, and the most elaborate ceremony in half a century has been prepared, and what do you do? —You weep! Yes, weep! and get your face all red and ugly! Do you think I want to present my bride in that con- dition?” With an expression of disgust on his pale, puffy features, the Tyngall ran one hand despairingly across his bald pate; while he took a deliberate stride or two about the room. “A splendid way to start our married life!” he went on. “You’d better pull yourself together, I warn you—or they'll be no happy days ahead for either of us! Here—I’ll tell you what!”—He paused long enough to glance at the great clock on the oppo- site wall. “I’ll give you just half an hour. In that time you’ll be able to wash and powder up a bit, and look as the bride of a Spratt should!” “But I don’t want to be the bride of 56 DYNAMIC Science Stories a Spratt! ” she sobbed. “Nonsense, dear lady! The point is too silly to be worth arguing. When des- tiny brings you a great gift, the thing to do is to accept it—and not question whether you want it or not.” He was interrupted by a voice that sounded through a little tube high up on the wall. “Your Excellency, Tyngall Spratt! I beg leave to inform you that the guests are growing more impatient. Unpleasant rumors are springing up. What shall I tell them now?” “Tell them the bride is still arrang- ing the details of her outfit!” growled the dictator, recognizing the voice of his secretary. “You see, there’s no use being child- ish,” the Tyngall went on, turning back to the sobbing figure. “If you don’t want to be presentable, we’ll let you be married just the way you are.” Beneath the force of this argument, the girl began slowly to dry her tears. “The trouble is,” grumbled the Tyn- gall, as he ruefully eyed his bride-to- be, “you don’t appreciate me. Here I’ve been mild and considerate and never so much as pressed a kiss upon you, when I could have taken you by force, if I’d been anything like the vil- lains of the old story books. Of course, no one ever is like that nowadays. But I suppose you still prefer this upstart, Har—” “Why shouldn’t I prefer him? He’s no upstart, either!” proclaimed Celia, beating her fists angrily against the chair. “It’s lucky for him he has no num- ber,” meditated the Tyngall. “My de- tectives searched for him everywhere in the Day Rooms, but couldn’t find a trace of him. Of course, that was to be expected—the detectives rarely find a trace of anything. But if we had caught him,—well, by the blue thunders, he wouldn’t have bothered U6 again!” “You never will catch him!” chal- lenged Celia. “He’s too smart for you! ” “Smart? I don’t know that word. Oh, you mean, tricky? Well, if ever I see him again, his tricks will get him nothing! He will regret the day when his father met his mother! ” Several minutes more went by while Celia, drying her tears, did her best to resign herself to the inevitable. If she was to be married anyhow, she reasoned, she might as well make a good appear- ance as a poor one. DUT she could not permit herself to ^ take the Tyngall’s arm as the little gold-meshed door was opened and she entered the reception hall. She still looked tormented and strained; yet if there were any who noticed the tear- marks on her face, they thought these perfectly natural in one who was so soon to have the great happiness of marrying a Tyngall; and, besides, a bride so young and tender-looking was certain to evoke favor, particularly among the hardier and more susceptible sex. To Celia’s senses the scene was like a nightmare, with the crowds of people, the excited exclamations, the congratu- lations, the murmurs of awe and ad- miration, the glitter of bright lights, the glare of the omnipresent gold, and the atmosphere of formality that filled the great, elaborately outfitted hall. It seemed to her that she was living through some fearful dream when, at the Tyngall’s side, she was marched to the center of the room while the crowd made way before her and a figure in a golden robe and golden headdress stood on a little platform with a gold-bound book, which he gravely opened. “For our text today,” she thought she heard him proclaim, “let us take a passage from the twenty-second century sage Halperi. ‘They that are united shall be blessed.’ Surely, nothing could be more blessed than that mating now about to THE LORD OF TRANERICA 57 be consummated, between the Tyngall of Tranerica and one whom, to judge by appearances—” The figure in the golden robe, Celia afterwards remembered, cast a benevo- lent, almost an endearing smile at her. She also recalled that there was much more which he said, about the “duties of a Tyngalless” and the “continuation of the great dynasty of Spratt.” But the next thing that she sharply recol- lected had nothing to do with the gol- den-robed one, nor with the rolling phrases that slid from his tongue. Suddenly—so suddenly that the guests had barely time to turn, and gasp in consternation—a huge door at the center of the room burst open with a clattering sound. There came the rat- tling of steel; and a corps of mechanical guards, each of ten-foot stature, thumped into the room. While the guests, in terror, scattered before their advance, they strode toward the Tyn- gall, who gave one startled glance and turned to flee—only to rush straight into the arms of a second corps of mech- anized giants, which had broken in at another entrance. “By the blood of the Spratts! it’s treason! base treason!” he barely had time to cry. And then, while he strug- gled helplessly in the arms of an iron captor and the guests looked on with equal helplessness, the guards executed a rapid about-face and went clanking out, bearing with them the distracted Tyngall, whose cries could be heard even after he had disappeared, “Trea- son! Treason! By the blood of the Spratts! it’s treason! base treason!” *	* * A month had gone by. Harry stood side by side with Celia in the Crystal Room, gazing out toward the dark tow- ering masses of the Hives. One arm was around the girl’s waist; his eyes had a whimsical sparkle, and there was something a little playful in his man- ner as he spoke: “Well, dearest, how do you like being a Tyngalless? The Tyngalless of all Tranerica!” “Seems I take to it just like a duck to water,” she returned, looking up at him with a coy smile. “That is, consider- ing who the Tyngall is.” “IT was a pretty close shave at that,” *	he meditated, brushing back his heavy mop of hair, in which the red was reappearing beneath the black dye. “When I consider how nearly that Spratt got you—” “I was simply electrified,” she fin- ished for him, with an admiring glance in his direction. “It was breath-taking, the way you burst in upon us, after the mechanical guards carried off the old Tyngall. And then the way you ordered the guests around, with the guards to help you, and decided to let the wed- ding ceremonies go on—with yourself in Mr. Spratt’s place! I don’t think the Minister would have married us, if he hadn’t been so scared you could see him shivering.” “Well, he didn’t have much choice, with the guards clattering all around him! ” laughed Harry. “My friends the Cipher and the Lightning Bolt were in the radio room all the while, making sure everything was run properly. By the way, I’m expecting them here any minute. I’m going to appoint the Cipher Governor of South Tranerica. And the Lightning Bolt—I’ll make him ambassador to Afasia.” Harry took a stride about the Crystal Room, and raised his arms in a gesture of exaltation. “It’s great to be a Tyn- gall,” he declared. “My followers— you know, the ex-prisoners—are estab- lished in every radio room on the con- tinent. They say the land was never before ruled so efficiently or intelli- gently.” “And that’s nothing to what you’re I 58	DYNAMIC Science Stories still going to do,” Celia predicted, com- ing to him with a smile. “After all, aren’t you glad, dearest, that we came to the twenty-fifth century?” “It was the wisest act of our livesl” he returned, gathering her into his arms. And then, as he glanced down through the fifteen-hundred-foot gulf to the Hudson and out across the interminable black bulks of the Hives and knew that he was lord of this and of all Tranerica, he heaved a deep, thankful sigh. “If only our friends in the twentieth cen- tury could see us now!” he exclaimed. “Who would ever have thought we were born to be a Tyngall and a Tyngalless! ” Meanwhile, in the obscure depths more than a quarter of a mile below, an unimpressive little man with a stumpy frame, bald pate and puffy face, moved unnoticed amid the crowds in the Day Rooms. His toga, of a pale lavender like that of many other males, was not such as to attract attention; his eyes were eager, like those of a traveler in a strange land, who finds everything of interest; but his manner was just a little bewildered, as though he did not feel himself to be quite in his element. From time to time, when some one ac- costed him and inquired his number, he would reply meekly, “I have none. I’m sorry to say”—whereat he would turn and go wandering away again, like a ghost among the shades of Hades. “After all, I’m not so badly off,” he meditated, as he rambled among the lawny walks. “It was pretty decent of the new Tyngall to spare my life and send me down to the Day Rooms. Be- sides, no one recognizes me here. That’s because they’ve taken my jeweled robe. But I was getting pretty much bored with ruling, anyhow. It’s more inter- esting here. There’s more variety. Be- sides—come to think of it—I was mighty lucky not having to marry that weepy woman. She’d have led me a devil’s life. . . .” “The only thing I’m sorry for,” he went on, “is that my dimension machine was broken. I would have liked to ex- periment some more. Who knows? I might have projected myself forward to the twenty-seventh or twentieth-eight century. Of course, I would have had to avoid the barbarian twentieth and twenty-first. . . A T this point his reveries were inter- rupted by a shout, “Tyngall! Oh, Tyngall! Hafl Tyngall! ” Out of old habit, he was about to draw himself up stiff and erect, and look cold and official, as he always did when hailed; but the final word struck him like a chilling splash of water. “Tyngall! Oh, Tyngall! Hail Tyn- gall Harry!” was borne to his ears, in an excited chorus. The cry was re- peated, again and again; and swept on- ward by a burst of mob emotion, he *	found himself one of a multitude gath- ered before a signboard, where a me- chanical worker nailed a printed notice : “HIVITES OF TRANERICA,” greetings! After decades of inactivity, the government has taken steps to rem- edy the unemployment problem. It is not known how many billions are out of work.

UZZ” CARSON, chief space scout for Galactic Metals, Inc., tucked the wire mesh container under one arm and leaped lightly across the last of the jagged forty foot cre- vasses between him and his cruiser. Through his green quartzite headpiece, the permalloy hull shimmered weirdly in the relentless sunlight. As he ap- proached the ship, a group of round, brown little shapes clustered about the airlock began to bounce and wriggle ex- pectantly. Buzz grinned. “The reception committee,” he mut- 60 DYNAMIC Science Stories tered in amusement. “Carson of Gal- actic makes big hit with Mercurian marbles. Oh, well—Hey! Take it easy there, Rollie!” One of the excited Rollies was bounc- ing up and down gleefully; joggling his tough, rubbery body against Carson’s space suit in paroxysms of delighted an- ticipation. At the space scout’s words he subsided into a trembling ball of hot leather; rolled smoothly and easily to the cruiser’s entrance. Carson laid down his burden. “All right, Rollies,” he said good na- turedly. “You know the rules around here. Which one of you is today’s guest of honor?” The Rollie nearest the airlock bounced up and down exuberantly. The others rolled back wistfully; spread circle-wise about the cruiser. Buzz took the tiny Mercurian in one hand. “Okay,” he grinned. “Come on in, pal, and get cool.” He took up his sample crate and pushed the button on the airlock. The other Rollies watched him disappear behind the wall of smooth metal, then swiftly rolled across the hard, sunbaked Mercurian plain to conceal themselves in ragged, shadowy caverns. Inside the space-ship, as Buzz stripped himself of the cumbersome re- frigerated suit that life on the inner- most planet demanded, the guest Rollie tossed himself madly about the smooth, cool metal floor. Ballwise, he propelled himself around the room in giddy cir- cles, his tough little body slap-slapping against the floor and walls in a frenzy of delight as he reveled in the delicious coolness of normal Earth temperature. Buzz chuckled as he watched. “You’re a nice little guy, Rollie,” he said, “even if you do look like a hot basketball. How’s for a nice, cool shower?” The Rollie bounccd crazily across the floor; bobbled about his bare feet. “Wowl Beat it! You’re hotI” ex- claimed Carson. He grinned again. “All right, my spherical comrade, let’s go sprinkle ourselves with some good Earth water.” Together the Earthman and the creature from Mercury sought the luxury of the spaceship’s shower- room. DUZZ, reveling in a riot of foamy soapsuds and cool water, dimly be- came aware of another sound pound- ing through the hiss of the shower. A metallic hammering sound. As of someone knocking at the hull of the cruiser. He pulled a wry grin. “Hearing things!” he muttered mirthlessly. “And no wonder, after two years alone on this blasted hotbox planet! Sorry, Rollie. No offense to you and your buddies. But—” Again the sound reached his ears. This time it was unmistakable. There was someone—or something—pound- ing on the airlock! But what? Who? On the lonely planet of Mercury? Buzz frowned. If it was those darned Rollies— Hastily he tossed a bath-towel about his loins and strode through the space- ship to the airlock. He paused near his workbench to pick up a metal meter- stick, then pmshed the lever that oper- ated the lock from the inside. The air- lock wheezed and hissed; swung slow- ly op>en. Buzz stepped forward an- grily. “I told you fellows,” he began impa- tiently, “you could only come in here one at a time. I’ve got half a notion to—” His mouth, stopped in midsentence, became a round O of astonishment. The figure standing before him was that of a human! What was more— a girl human! Buzz gulped and turned brick-red; suddenly conscious of his scanty bath-towel. THE MERCURIAN MENACE 61 “Whoa! Hold everything!” he gasped. “Come on in and sit down. I’ll be right back!” Clutching the towel about him desperately, he fled across the floor to the shower-room. To the great disgust of the placid Rollie, he snapped off the water, flung himself in- to his clothing, and rushed back to his visitor. The Rollie trailed after him, dispiritedly oozing cold water from the deepset pores of his tough hide. His guest had divested herself of her heavy space armor, and was lounging now in the light, graceful blouse and shorts favored for Earth summerwear. Her hair was a rich and warm chestnut bordering on auburn; her eyes, cool and amused, were like the cloudless skies above Mars. About her slightly wide, deliciously curved mouth, there hovered a faint smile. She rose and extended an arm in the universal Earth sign of greeting. “Hello, exile,” she smiled. “Sur- prised to see me, weren’t you? Or do you always greet your visitors with a meterstick in one hand?” “Y-yes,” stammered Carson. “I mean—oh, no! Of course not! I thought you were a Rollie. I mean— I thought the Rollies were you. Oh, shucks! What I mean is, I’ve been out here two years without seeing an Earth- ling, and—” The girl frowned momentarily; her keen blue eyes suspicious. “Two years, you say?” Buzz caught that studying gaze and grinned. “Don’t be alarmed. I’m not space-cuckoo—if that’s what you’re wondering. It was just the shock of actually seeing another human being that upset me for a minute. And there were a flock of Rollies outside just be- fore you came.” “Rollies? What are Rollies?” “That’s my own name for them,” Buzz explained. “They are the natives of this section of Mercury. Maybe the only natives. Here, I’ll show you one —” He turned and called to his Mer- curian visitor, who had rolled comfor- tably under the electric refrigerator in the galley. “Hey, RolUe! Come on out and meet an Earth gal!” ' I 'HE “Earth gal” watched in wide- *	eyed amazement as the wet blob of leather rolled pleasantly across the room, rolled experimentally around her sandalled feet, then bounced gravely up and down as though to acknowledge the introduction. Buzz patted the tiny Mercurian and pushed him gently to- ward the galley passage. The Rollie spun swiftly, then whisked to his lair beneath the refrigerator. “That’s a Rollie,” explained Carson. “Tough little footballs—but friendly. The only possible form of animal life that could exist here on the sunside of Mercury. The mean daily temperature here is 450 degrees Fahrenheit—and it’s always day, since this side of the planet always faces the sun. “The Rollies’ leathery hides protect them from the terrific heat of the sun, and their shape allows them to travel safely over Mercury’s rocky, pitted surface. And do they love coolness! I’ve been letting them visit me, one at a time, ever since I landed here. Give them a cold shower and you’ve won a friend for life.” “But—but he seemed to understand what you said?” “Sure. Rollies understand every word you say. Some sort of telepathy, I guess. And they’re intelligent little creatures. But since they have no vo- cal organs, they can’t talk back. If it weren’t for that, they’d be darned good company. But say—who are you? Where did you come from? And where’s your spaceship?” “One at a time, please,” laughed the girl. “First of all, I’m Jeryl Morrow, ore products investigator for Galactic 62 DYNAMIC Science Stories Metals, sent out here to get your re- port. I arrived a half hour ago, Earth time. Landed as near as I could to your cruiser, which I spotted from the strato, and walked over.” “You know who I am, then?” “Naturally. I know all about you— except what you have learned since you took over this station. Thai’s what the company wants me to find out. Your term is over next year, and they’d like to have everything shipshape for the next Mercurian scout.” “Suits me fine,” said Buzz cheerful- ly. “You can’t imagine how good a glimpse of old Mother Earth would look to me right now. Seas and clouds and snow. And seasons. And night! Oh, boy! To see the sun go down for a change, and watch the sky grow dark. I’ve almost forgotten what the night looks like.” “That’s strange! You must have seen plenty of night over on the dark side of Mercury.” “The dark side?” Carson stared at the investigator in amazement; then slowly shook his head. “No ma’am! Not Mr. Carson, lady. He stays away from the dark side of Mercury!” “I’m not sure I understand you,” said the girl slowly. “You mean to say that you’ve made no investigations whatsoever on the dark side?” “My dear young lady,” said Buzz seriously, “there are some things that even a space scout doesn’t go out of his way to meet. I mean those things which don’t concern him. Those things that got Henderson and Frizell. The things that destroyed Galactic’s dark- side station in two weeks without even leaving a trace behind. The things that flicker through the twilight zone when you’re walking near the border.” “Do you mean you’re—afraid!” de- manded the girl. “Afraid? Sister, I’m scared stiff! Absolutely petrified. Don’t look so surprised. After all, there’s enough raw ore here on the sunside of Mercury to keep Galactic supplied for three cen- turies. Why should I, or any other man, tempt fate by going right into the lair of the flame-folk?” “That’s not the point,” said Jeryl carefully. “The point is that your job is to study the ores of Mercury for Gal- actic; not to spend two solid years sur- veying one half of the planet. You viust let me have a report on the dark- side metals.” “I ISTEN,” said Carson impatiently, ' “you’re talking through your hel- met! I have detailed reports on all of habitable Mercury. I have samples and analyses of every kind of metal that crops out of these rough hills and plains. I have assay fragments of gold, silver, platinum, iridium, tellium from the sun side. It stands to reason that the rest of the planet is the same. But I’ll take that for granted. I’m not go- ing over the border into the dark side for any man—or for any girl!” Jeryl Morrow rose stiffly. “Mr. Carson,” she said coldly, “I’ve tried to be nice about this. But you’ve forced my position with your ridiculous attitude. Now listen carefully. I must have a dark-side reportI You may con- sider that an order!” Carson rose, his cheeks flaming. “I always knew,” he said angrily, “that a woman in space was a woman without brains! Now you listen! If you want a dark-side report, you can get it yourself. And—you may con- sider that a refusal!” The girl’s eyes traveled over Carson’s well-knit body slowly. When she spoke, her voice was mocking. “Yellow, eh? I didn’t think any one man could be all they told me, back on Earth, that you were. All right, Mr. Carson—I will get that report myself. I’ll show you whether spacewomen are THE MERCURIAN MENACE 63 fools. And when I get back to head- quarters, we’ll see what Galactic has to say about its great ace scout.” Carson’s jaw set in a grim line. “If you know when you’re well off,” he ground out, “you’ll stay here—where it’s safe!” “I’ll go where I choose,” said the girl firmly. She stepped into her space armor deftly; stood before Carson. Her voice was metallic through the com- munication unit of her helmet. “You’ll not change your mind?” “No!” “Very well, then,” Jeryl Morrow strode to the airlock. “You might turn on your short wave to 9.56. I’m going into the dark side to establish a research base. I’ll let you know how I’m making out. Goodbye, Mr. Carson!” Once more the airlock wheezed asthmatically as she stepped into it. Buzz took a swift step forward. “Miss Morrow!” he cried. But there .was no answer. The outer port clanged shut. Grimly, Buzz strode to his in- strument panel; snapped on the short- wave radio. A slightly chilled ball rolled lazily across the floor and nestled at his feet. The Rollie. “Oh, you!” demanded Carson fierce- ly. “Are you all one sex? Or are there female Rollies, too?” The Rollie wriggled fretfully. Buzz sighed. “Well—I guess it doesn’t make any difference,” he said. “A gal Rollie wouldn’t have red hair anyway. Or a rotten disposition. Like you, I mean—” he suddenly shouted in the general di- rection of the radio. The radio hummed and spluttered. Then, as if in answer to his comment, he heard the cool voice of Jeryl Morrow. “Are you timed in, Mr. Carson? Very well. Leave your dials where they are. I’m taking off now for the dark side.” There came a light, taunting laugh. “To see your bogeymen. You’ll hear from me later. . . “Hey! For goodness sakes—stop it! What the—!” Buzz stared in shocked bewilder- ment. The Rollie seemed to have sud- denly gone mad. No longer quiet and relaxed, the tiny Mercurian began to pound up and down before him in a mad tattoo. Tap-tap-tap! his leathery little body sounded on the hard metal floor. Tap- tap-tap! ARSON stared. Then suddenly he '— recognized that there was more than mere chance; there was some in- tended meaning behind the frenzied ac- tivity of the speechless ball. Something had excited the little visitor to an un- usual extent. Could it be the radio? Something Jeryl had said? About the dark side? Swiftly he whirled on the bouncing Mercurian. “Rollie—what is it? Something about the dark side you want to know?” The Rollie lay quiet, quivering with suppressed excitement. “Bounce once for ‘yes’ and twice for ‘no’,” ordered Buzz. “Now—is it about the dark side, Rollie?” The Rollie bounced once emphatical- ly; then subsided into tense quiescence. “Danger there?” continued Buzz frantically. Again his little friend bounced a sin- gle loud tap. “What kind of danger? From peo- ple—oh, darn it! Rollie, if you could only talk! Wait a minute. I have it! If I follow her, can I help? Will I be able to protect her?” Tap-tap. Ominously. “Then what . . . how . .. ?” Eagerly Carson clutched at a tenuous straw. “Can you help her, Rollie?” A deliberate tap, followed by a rapid tap-tap. 64 DYNAMIC Science Stories “Yes—No?” Buzz frowned. Then, “I see! Not you alone—but you and your brothers! Is that it?” Breathlessly he watched as the Rollie tapped once. Then he began to throw himself into his space armor. The Rol- lie rolled eagerly to the airlock; waited there expectantly. Within sec- onds the two were standing on the hot, dry plain outside the cruiser. Shrilly Carson whistled. In answer to the Earthman’s signal from a hundred rocky caverns in the stark desolation came swiftly rolling brownish balls. Over hubble and detritus, from crevice and cranny, the tiny Rollies tumbled and bounced their way to the space cruiser. They paused in a thickly strewn circle before the Earthman, wig- gling curiously. Carson wet his lips. He felt silly, standing there talking to a group of hot little basketballs, but be- neath his sense of the absurd was a stronger force. Fear. “Rollies,” he said, “something’s wrong. I’m not sure I understand what it is—but your brother here does. A girl from Earth, a newcomer here, has just gone over to the dark side of the planet.” A quivering shudder seemed to course through the leathery horde. Taut nerves tightened in Buzz. “I understand that you Rollies are able to help her. Will you do it?” There was a surging forward move- ment as the Rollies, with one accord, tossed toward him. Carson plunged the key that controlled the airlock. Hot brown balls jiggled about his feet, crowding into the ship. “Come on, then!” shouted Buzz. “Pile in! We’re going after her. Into the dark side!” There was a dreadful sort of jest in the way that cheerful voice spoke in- termittently over the one-way radio. Standing by the controls, Buzz ground his teeth helplessly as he listened to Jeryl’s mocking taunts. “—nearly through the mountains now, and it’s too bad you’re not with me, Carson. They are quite a sight as they flame, crimson and gold, in the brilliant sun. I hope you’ll find time to study them sometime. But perhaps they are too near the twilight zone to suit you—” ' I ‘HE ship was throbbing with vibra- A tion; its usual stability disturbed by the mad acceleration Carson was jam- ming through the rocket jets. The main tubes of the space cruiser were flaming spouts of fire in the Mercurian strato; the ship itself a flashing streak of silver arcing above the tiny metal planet. Great motors whined and groaned as Buzz shoved the control lever to its highest acceleration notch. “—can see the twilight zone ahead now,” continued the undisturbed voice. “Strange. I should have expected some sort of vegetation here. But there is none. And I can see a thin black line ahead now, Carson, with darkness hang- ing above and beyond it like a velvet curtain. That reminds me—you wanted to see the night again, didn’t you? I see it now. Perhaps you should have come with me—” Through the pcrilens Carson caught a glimpse of the small, rapidly moving spaceship. Her ship. Ahead of him and moving swiftly toward the dark- side boundary. A great exultation swept over him. He might make it! He might succeed in stopping her before she crossed over; grounded on that in- hospitable, macabre terrain. . . . “—am turning off the refrigerating unit now, and switching on the heat. No bright sunshine here, Carson. It is growing quite dark—” She had made it then! She was through the twilight zone. On the dark side! THE MERCURIAN MENACE 65 “Damn you!” cried Carson to the radio. “Damn your beautiful, stubborn jets! Turn around! Come back! Don’t try to land there!” “—but it isn’t entirely dark—” There was an odd, strained note of hes- itancy in the girl’s voice. The Rollies, piled in heaps of spherical brown beside Carson in the control room, quivered as a solid body. One bounced, explo- sively, to the ceiling. “—there are strange little green flares moving through the blackness. Odd. A sort of St. Elmo’s fire, I suppose. Or a sort of cold will-o’-the-wisp. At any rate, I understand what caused your fear of the ‘flame folk,’ Carson. But you were wrong. I can see them quite plainly now. They are not beings at all. Just a phenomenon of the cold—” Carson groaned and tugged vainly at the already strained controls. Oh, for one more burst of transcendent speed! All too well he knew those “green flares”! Knew what they could do, anyway. He had been a member of the party that had gone out to find out what had become of Henderson’s ill- fated dark-side base. He had seen, from above, those seared black cicat- rices on the bleak, rimy soil of the dark- side. Had seen—and shuddered. Had understood—and returned to the safe- ty, light and warmth of the sun-side. If this girl landed her ship . . . “Jeryl!” he cried. But even as he spoke, he knew his words were vain. She, too, was speaking from the radio. “—am landing now,” said that laughing voice. “I must sign off for a moment. I’ll be with you later—” Suddenly the cab of Carson’s cruiser was thick with darkness. Through im- penetrable black his fingers groped for the light switch; snapped it on. He, too, was through the twilight zone. He had reached the blackness of the dark- side. But would he be too late? Swiftly he clicked on the search beam; swung its wide arc groundward, search- ing for Jeryl’s ship. One of the Rollies was bouncing against his legs insistently. He looked down. All of the others were herded by the airlock, their massed brown bodies strangely comforting sights in this strange, frozen silence. Carson nodded his understanding. They wanted to be pleased instantly at the moment the other ship was sighted. He turned back to his controls; knuckles white on the propulsion rod. ' I 'HEN suddenly a loud scream tore A through the narrow control room. Jeryl’s voice raised in horror! “Carson! Buzz! Help!” There was a moment of frying static, then, “Buzz —you were right! They are alive! The green things, I mean. I can see them through my perUens, clustering about me. Hundreds of them. They seemed to be gathering. Now they’re moving toward the spaceship! “And my controls won’t work! Buzz —they’ve gone dead on me! The lights are out! Out! It’s a dreadful sea of blackness. And those green flares moving toward my ship—” Great beads of perspiration dripped coldly from Buzz Carson’s forehead. His strong hands trembled on the pro- pulsion rod. Helpless! Trapped by that damned green horde. But where? In the name of the Nine Planets— where? His eyes, glued to the perilens, caught a fitful gleam of baleful green. Hastily he swung the ship toward the hideously glowing patch of color. It was she! It was the grounded ship— encircled by the flame folk from the frigid hell of the dark-side. Carson’s hands, steel-tensed as the claws of a robot, swung the ship into a hovering circle. The flaming rocket- tubes choked and died suddenly as Carson swept down like a shrieking de- 66 DYNAMIC Science Stories mon of vengeance. No time for a careful landing. Al- ready the radio was spitting and fizzing with an excess of static; the words of the girl coming through fitfully. “—not afraid to die . . . but . . . should have believed what you told me . . . Buzz ... if I had only—” Then the ground was a tangible force rising up to smash at the ship. Recklessly, Buzz shot a staggering repulsion beam from the nose jet. The ship jolted, reeled . . . then settled to the ground with a grinding bump. In a flash, Carson was at the airlock; his hand on the release lever. The door swung open. Then suddenly a tough, solid object strudk him heavily on the breast; bowled him over like a ten-pin. One of the Rollies! And Carson saw the meaning of this crude warning. This was their fight— not his! Dazedly he crawled back to the control room; focused the perilcns on the ragged shelf of the Mercurian dark-side landscape. Across a bleak and desolate frozen plain, not fifty feet distant from his own cruiser, was the other space ship. A dark, sullen mass; unlighted and grim. About it, circling in an ever-narrowing net, a host of the greenish flame-folk stood; their ghoulishly phosphorescent bodies flickering pallidly against the dreadful umbra. Tall as two men, they were. Slim, ever-changing wisps of light that glimmered like the cold fox- fire of distant Earth. From their tractile bodies strange pseudopods of flame licked out again and again. Ghastly emanations that simulated the limbs of flesh-and-blood creatures. There was no recognizable substance or shape that composed them. Only a constant flux of quaver- ing motion, somehow baleful and threatening. Their light was a light that cast no gleam among them. It seemed self-contained. The light of absorption. The unbroken circle that had sur- rounded the other ship was ruptured now. Some of the flame folk had no- ticed the new cruiser. Already a tiny group of the green flame-folk were mov- ing across the metal plain to investi- gate. There was a quivering excite- ment in the creatures’ fitful gleaming. A sort of greedy, licking hunger in their cold presence. A CHILL of repugnance swept ** through Carson. Then he swung the perilens around to sight the airlock of his own ship. Darkness! Black, deep, impenetra- ble darkness! Buzz gnawed his lips. Had the Rollies come out? Were they somewhere in that dismal void, organ- izing, forming their ranks for some strange warcraft? He could not see them anywhere. Those bouncing, bub- bling little spheres of friendliness— what had happened to them? Then suddenly, amazingly, some- thing happened! One of the green flame-folk, the nearest of the investi- gating party approaching Carson’s ship, writhed as though in a convulsion of pain! Writhed into a towering spiral of greenish flame that twisted into the black sky—and disappeared! And in its place another figure ap- peared. A flame of warm, ruby light that pulsed and glowed with a fervor like—like that of an avenging host! Buzz gasped! It was impossible—but it was true! This must be the work of the Rollies. The battle was begun. Another of the green flame-folk shot, rocketlike, to a streaming spiral of curl- ing pain; quivered and collapsed into a glowing red flame. And another . . . and another! Suddenly there was panic amongst the handful of invaders, and like gaunt will-o’-the-wisps the few about Carson’s cruiser swept back to- THE MERCURIAN MENACE 67 ward their fellows. There was a congealing of the horde of green demons; a baleful conference of evil. Wavering tentacles of spirit light hovered about the dark-side in- habitants, and an ominous pulsating strength shuddered through their ranks. One of the green flares uncurled him- self from around the prow of the girl’s cruiser. Where he had embraced the spaceship, smooth metal was charred and blackened; burned deep in a chan- neled groove. Jeryl’s voice, suddenly bell-like and clear, spoke from the radio. “Buzz! Your ship! I see it in my perilens. Then you came? But what’s happening? The green things are going away. What are those red flames? Are they enemies, too? Or friends? Did you bring them?” There was a moment of silence, then the girl’s voice broke suddenly with horror. “Buzz— my ship! It’s been broken. Burned into! The air is leaking!” Agonizedly, Carson waited for her next words. Cold sweat beaded his forehead; a clutching hand was at his throat. “I’m putting my space suit on,” came the voice once more. “I’m going to try to make it—through them—to your ship. If I fail—” Then Carson acted. Like a madman he tore toward the airlock; waited im- patiently as the lock operated to loose him to the frozen metal plain. Rollies or no Rollies, he had to get into this fight, too. Jeryl could never get through that macabre green host alone. He reached the plain outside. Thankfulness touched his heart that the gravity of Mercury was so slight. That sturdy Earth muscles, even hampered by the leaden weight of a space suit, could carry one enormous distances at a single leap. In-the flood of the searchlight he saw the girl’s slim figure stumble from the airlock of the other ship. He bounded toward her. A wavering green light flickered toward him. He eluded its tactile fingers, scarcely knowing why. Another step now. . . . Then the greenish flare enveloped him for a fraction of an instant—and his senses reeled! Pain, sharp and in- describable, flooded him to the roots of every nerve. He was numb. Numb and cold with an unearthly coldness. His feet failed him. He fell forward on his face; drained of every ounce of energy. A BLINDING flash of color flamed before him. The brilliant, corus- cating color of giant forces met in mighty conflict. Suddenly the cold- ness left him as his green attacker left to join the rest of the green horde which, en rnasse, was advancing to meet the ruby-colored invaders. Instantly the dismal landscape was lit with the ghastly flares of unearthly combat. Fulgurant streamers of fire were flung to the skies as the forces of the baleful flame-folk struck back against the strange necromancy of the Rollies! Pallid green and scintillant ruby met in beams of blinding energy; swayed and tossed like maddened fin- gers of light. Shattered into dripping sparks of blazing color! Here a gigantic green unit swallowed its reddish foe, gleamed strangely with an inexplicable color beyond the spec- trum, and shimmered into caliginous gloom. There an omnipotent pillar of ruby fire whirled like a gigantic spout of flame into and through the massed green horde; striking, absorbing, de- stroying all that stood in its path. From out of nowhere a flame of Red would emerge, darting, swift as light, to the very heart of the fray. Like a thousand lightnings the war- riors from the Mercurian antipodes met, flamed and died in that titanic struggle. 68 DYNAMIC Science Stories And ever, inexorably, the pulsing glow of the ruby flames spread as the green horde dwindled. Doggedly, stubbornly, the dark-side demons fought at first. Then, as one by one of their fellows writhed into spires of stricken flame, died and emerged as red foes to turn upon their own brethren, the remaining few retreated until the battleground was clear of all save the ruby flames. And as the last of the green horde disappeared into the black depths, Car- aon was on his feet again, stumbling and panting to the side of the girl. Stum- bling because all about him, strewn like giant pods, were the inert leathery bod- ies of the Rollies. And about him, too, warm and protecting, were the flame- giants of ruby that the Rollies, some- how, had managed to loose. . .. “Buzz!” Jeryl’s glad cry was sweet in his ears, even distorted through the metallic eardrums of his helmet. Swiftly he gathered her into his arms. Together they moved toward the cruiser. A tear choked the girl’s voice as they passed one of the tiny, rubbery balls. “The Rollies,” she said. “They saved us—but they lost their lives in doing it. And all because I was stubborn.” “But we did not lose our lives,” said a quiet, gentle voice. “Our lives are eternal; indestructible. We are here.’' Carson and the girl stared at each other; suddenly realizing the same thing. No voice had spoken to them. No real voice. A thought had entered their minds. And before them, slowly revolv- ing, was one of the ruby flames that had conquered the green flame folk. From its glowing depths emanated the waves that came to the mass thoughts. “Yes, this is our true form, Buzz Carson,” continued the thought. “We are really as you see us now—creatures of positive electrical energy. Our foes and hated enemies were the green folk of the dark side—creatures of negative energy. Ours is the more progressive race' the more peace loving. That is why. many centuries ago, we developed for ourselves those ‘bodies’ in which we live on the sun-side of our world. Por- ous leathery bodies through which we can freely absorb the life-giving wealth of the sun. “Of course, as ‘Rollies’,” the pulsat- ing pillar continued whimsically, “we cannot do some of the things we used to do in the ancient days of our planet’s grandeur. We cannot talk—or visit the planets as we used to centuries ago—” Jeryl clutched Carson’s arm. “Visit other planets!” she cried. “Buzz—it’s almost incredible, but it must be true! Remember what some of our old legends and religious books tell us? About strange visitors that came ‘as a cloud by day and a pillar of fire by night’?” ARSON whirled eagerly on the ^ ruby entity. -‘Is that true? Were you the ones who—?” But there was no answer. Slowly, easily, the rubv creature was seeping into the porous hide of one of the inert Rollies that lay strewn on the frigid plain. All about them, others of the red warriors were seeking their sun- side shells. Suddenly the plain was alive with a host of tiny, tossing brown bodies that rolled briskly toward the airlock. Friendly little creatures. Rol- lies once more. Buzz grinned. “All right, boys,” he shouted cheer- fully, “if that’s the way you want it to be—you’re the boss! And from now on, the shower-room is open all day long!” “Buzz—” Jeryl began hesitantly. “Woman,” Buzz CaTson silenced her brusquely, “will you hurry up and get into the cruiser? I’ve been two long years alone on this planet—and I’ll be darned if I can kiss you through a head- piece ! ” Each man gripped a grimly pointing rocket pistol. The four mutineers stood as though stunned MUTINEERS OF SPACE THRILLING LONG NOVELETTE OF INTERPLANETARY RACKETEERS by LLOYD ARTHUR ESHBACH IP WH              fpiprj [jjmM , V''                     V 1 • iV * 1 \ • ' J . \    m 1 '/ Behind those fraU Terrestrials roared a volcano from the sulphur pits, and ruthless slave- masters of Jupiter—while 550,000,000 miles ahead was Max Bredeur, head of Interplanetary Transport Lines, end the vicious racketeer of Uranlan slave traffic who had sentenced them to this living hell! FURTIVELY Alan Sarett peered through the heavy murk of the Jovian prison pit. A cloud of yel- low steam writhed upward from the boiling spring at his feet, obscuring everything with a choking, sulphurous veil. He caught a hazy glimpse of Jon Cory, lank and raw-boned, stripped to the waist, toiling steadily on the oppo- site bank of the pool. Then a shrill, peremptory note came from the throat of the Jovian guard, and a wire-thin tentacle lashed viciously across his naked back, cutting deep. Alan’s face wrinkled like the snout of a snarling dog; and he bent over the bubbling spring, tearing savagely with a long, daw-tipped instrument at the crust of sulphur forming continuously on the lip of the caldron. A heap of the lemon yellow fragments lay behind him. Through slitted lids he glared up at 70 DYNAMIC Science Stories the mighty figure of the Jovian, hatred burning in his eyes. Damned sluur— he’d pay for that—and soon! They’d planned everything—he and Cory and Parker, and the Uranian, Tull—and be- fore many minutes passed, they’d hear the signal. . . . The signal, the roar of the supply ship from Io—and this sluur would boil in the sulphur pool, and they’d be heading for freedom 1 Freedom—and Max Brodeur! His ears strained for the first sound of the supply ship’s rockets, a tenseness creeping through him. And even as he labored, he watched the yellow-skinned guard, to be ready when the signal came. Formidable antagonists, these giant brutes with their tremendous mus- cles. It was no joke for two Terrestrials —or even a half dozen—to attack one of them. Ten feet above the obsidian surface of the Pit this sluur towered, his great, bulbous body supported by three mighty, multi-jointed limbs termi- nating in immense sucker-discs. His head, if it could be called a head, was merely an elongation of his body; and the bare expanse of flesh was broken only by a single huge eye, faceted like an insect’s, and an enormous, toothless mouth. From the top of his head pro- jected six long, wiry tentacles—and it was these that Alan feared most, for in them lay the strength of spring steel. Suddenly Sarctt stiffened, his fingers fiercely gripping the handle of his sul- phur-hook. Far above a faint, pene- trating whine cleft the heavy Jovian atmosphere, cutting down through the haze in a steadily mounting roar. The signal! He spun toward his guard— lashed out and up mightily with his hook, aiming at the gaping mouth like a crimson gash in the smooth, yellow face. And the blow landed I Blood, dark and viscous, spurted from a long, ragged wound. A scream like the wail of a siren burst from the sluur, losing itself in the space ship’s roar, and his tentacles, quivering with pain and wrath, swept toward Sa- rett. Alan tried to leap back out of reach, but in the terrific gravitational pull of the giant planet he could barely raise his feet from the ground. Coiling cinctures of crushing sinew seized legs, waist, throat, and he was whipped high into the air! “Cory! Corp!” he gasped, and with a final desperate lunge he buried his sulphur-hook in the top of the Jovian’s head. The clutch of the tentacles tight- ened convulsively; and Alan felt them sear into quivering flesh, felt the one about his throat grind deeper and deep- er, obscuring his sight with a creeping blackness. Consciousness was only a ghostly thread when he heard a shout rise above the dying roar of the supply ship, and the life-draining grip of the tentacles relaxed! The sluur shook under a hail of thudding blows—and abruptly Alan was hurled to the floor of the Pit. Agony crawled through every nerve; he wrenched the sulphur-laden air into his burning lungs with great, rasping gulps. He knew his mind was spinning toward the black, empty chasms of uncon- sciousness. and he struggled furiously to keep his senses. Somehow, he found himself swaying on legs as weak as woven straw. A dozen feet away he saw the Jovian, a horrible monstrosity blotched with slow-flowing blood, crouching on wide- spread limbs, striving to ward off the gouging slashes of Cory’s weapon. Abruptly he fell forward on the crim- son ruin of his face—and a twitching tentacle wound itself around the Ter- restrial! A single note of triumph shrilled from the dying monster—and he began to creep toward the boiling pool! In wide-eyed horror Alan shuffled to- ward the struggling pair. Though the weakened slmtr moved slowly, his own MUTINEERS OF SPACE 71 pace seemed slower. Retrieving his fal- len sulphur-hook without pausing, he pushed steadily ahead. They were fighting on the very brink of the spring now, Cory desperately striving to free himself. Then Alan reached them— and with a single mighty swing he drove his weapon through the bulging eye deep into the Jovian’s brain! Cory wrenched free, the sUtur sagged in death. He teetered on the sulphur-crust for an instant, then slid over the edge—vanished in the depths of the churning expanse. Panting heavily, the two men faced each other. Cory, angular, homely, six feet tall; Sarett, shorter by six inches, black haired, rather swarthy, a figure of stocky power. Both streaked and splashed with blood, their own and the Jovian’s, from head to sandaled feet. As one their hands shot out, meeting in a strong, wordless clasp. Cory broke the awkward silence. “A swell push—while it lasted,” he said, grinning broadly. '‘And now I think we’d better blast off.” Sarett nodded. “Right. It’ll take Parker and Tull longer to get to the wall, but they’ll probably get rid of their sluur quicker than we did.” Like men on snow shoes they started across the Pit, sliding their feet over the glass-smooth surface. The muscles of their thighs were corded and rigid as they struggled ahead with laborious haste. Neither spoke; breath was too valuable to be expended in speech. And each was busy with his own thoughts— thoughts awakened by the freedom which seemed almost within reach. Two months ago they had been brought to Jupiter on the convict ship, Sarett and Cory and Parker. Space- masters all, in charge of three of the largest ITL cruisers, they had been con- victed without trial on a charge of mu- tiny—convicted by order of Max Bro- deur, President of the Interplanetary Transport Lines . . . Mutiny! Sa- rett’s lip curled bitterly. That was a joke—a damned rotten joke. They had learned too much about the Uranian slave traffic, too much about those thou- sands of docile yet powerful Elgae be- ing torn from their parent world to slave and die in the Mercutian radium mines. A racket operated by Bro- deur himself! And they’d get Brodeur! He was a big man in interplanetary affairs, a mythical figure of power none of them had ever seen, but they’d find him— and burn him! “Almost there,” Cory grunted., ges- turing through the murk toward a high, gleaming wall directly ahead. It tow- ered almost thirty feet above them, its polished surface sloping inward at a sharp angle, a barrier that no convict had surmounted since the Pit had been created. In moments they stood be- neath it, looking back over the way they had come. They could see nothing—only the eternal fog like a vaporous monster writhing in its lair. A mist that con- cealed thousands of convict laborers, beings from every inhabited planet in the System. They were toiling beside those seething pools, seeking Jovian sulphur crystals, more valuable than gold since Dr. Martin Quigley’s discov- ery of their marvelous ability to rejuve- nate human life. Alan glanced at Cory. He was squinting intently into the gloom, wait- ing. Sarett frowned. He hoped Park- er and Tull would make it. They should be here soon—unless they had failed! And if they had failed—either of them—it meant death for the rest, death in a sulphur caldron. For only with the four was escape possible. Cory spoke without turning his head. “Wonder what it is that Tull plans to spring. You remember—he mentioned 72 DYNAMIC Science Stories it last sleep period. Something to keep the Jovians occupied.” Sarett shrugged. “I don’t know any more than you do. But it’s bound to be something good, for that Uranian knows things—like every other high- born member of his race. And he’s in this to win.” If anything, Tull’s griev- ance was greater than their own, for Brodeur’s emissaries had tried to cap- ture him with some of the Elgae; and because he had killed a dozen of his would-be captors, and had escaped, they had sent him here on a faked charge. Abruptly Cory gripped Alan’s arm, and he held his breath. There was a faint, slithering sound out there in the murk. If it were a Jovian—but it wasn’t. The huge frame of Lief Parker bulked large before them, bloody, un- sightly, sliding slowly forward like a swimmer struggling against a powerful undercurrent. He was alone. A hoarse whisper reached them. “Sa- rett—Cory—is that you?” “Yeah,” Cory answered. “Where’s TuH?” Parker didn’t reply till he joined them at the base of the wall. “He’ll be cornin’,” he said. “We had a little trouble. The sluurs must’ve suspected somethin’, ’cause two of ’em jumped us. They’re cookin’ now—but it means we’ll have to rush things. Tull is plantin’ his little diversion; and I came ahead since he can travel a lot faster.” “What is this plan of Tull’s?” Sarett demanded. “Cory and I’ve been won- dering.” DARKER grinned with one side of *	his face, his eye closing in an ha- bitual squint. “Oh, it’s prettyl Pret- ty! Y’see, back home on Uranus, Tull is a chemist—an’ a damn’ good one. Since he’s been here he’s been workin’ durin’ sleep periods, usin’ some of the dishes they feed us with—an’ he’s final- ly made an explosive out of the liquid in the pool. Don’t ask me how—but he’s done it. An’ when I left, he was settin’ the charge. It’ll blow the floor all around there into bits, an’ let hell come boilin’ through. An’ while they feed aspirin to that headache, we’ll blast off!” “Blow up the floor of the Pit!” In- credulously Cory repeated the words. “That’ll be—hell—for the other men around here!” “It will be hell,” Sarett exclaimed, his dark face hard and grim. He could imagine the shattered shell of obsidian floating in a churning mass of boiling sulphur—Jovians and convicts alike sinking into the scalding flood—could almost hear the curses, the screams. . . . Then he spoke again, his voice brittle as the sound of breaking glass. “It’s tough, but we’re not doing it just to escape. We’re going to get Brodcur —if it takes the life of every damned convict in this stinking hole! What’s the difference—a year in this air fin- ishes a man anyway! A quick death is more merciful.” Cory nodded. “You’re right,” he said stonily. There was a moment’s silence, broken only by the faint wailing of a distant sluur; then Sarett spoke in brusque, businesslike tones. “Do I have it straight? Tull takes the bottom, since he’s heaviest, biggest and strong- est. You, Parker, get on Tull’s shoul- ders ; and Cory crawls up on you. Cory braces himself against the wall—and he catches me when Tull throws me up. I reach the top and crawl out. Right?” “Okay!” Parker snapped. “An’ then you get that supply boat—quick—an’ drop it in here to pick us up.” “Yeah—and—” Cory’s words were lost abruptly in a crackling roar that reverberated thunderously through the Pit. Tull’s explosion. A dull red flash, then silence. Another instant—and the MUTINEERS OF SPACE 73 veil of murk before them was ripped to shreds by a lurid flare which lashed up and up endlessly into the sky, like a mighty arm of flame reaching into space. In its wake came a second deto- nation, father of the flare—an inde- scribable b-r-oooommm like nothing the three had ever heard. The floor of the Pit rocked drunkenly, and a wave of vertigo swept over the crouching men. “It set off a volcano!” Cory cried, his words a thin whisper in the tumult —words left hanging in midair as a cyclonic blast of sulphur-laden smoke flung him and his companions bodily against the wall. The perilous rocking of the floor continued, in tempo with the belching of the new-born volcano. And now a shower of glowing sparks began to fall in a stinging hail. Alan Sarett struggled painfully to his feet, his battered body numbed with shock. A few feet away Cory and Parker crawled erect, neither seriously injured. Parker’s mouth twisted in his one- sided grin. “Plenty to interest the Jo- vians,” he shouted above the noise. “More than we figured on. Now if Tull—” He stopped short. “Yeah,” Cory concluded, “if Tull pulled through and we could get out of here in a hurry, there wouldn’t be much chance of pursuit. But it’s a miracle if he escaped.” “Then miracles still happen!” Alan cried. “Here he comes 1” Outlined against a background of crimson flame, a massive figure strode ponderously toward them. Almost as tall as the Jovians, he looked like a crudely drawn caricature of a man with a paper-white skin. Powerful arms, dangling from a tremendous chest, swung pendulously at his sides. Phys- ically he suggested the brute—but his mighty cranium with its high, jutting forehead belied the testimony of his body. “Not good—this ’ruption,” he said jerkily in a cavernous bass. “It break plans. We get out—quick! This place not last long.” Instantly Parker sprang to his side. “Yeah—so let’s pyramid.” Easily Tull swung the comparatively puny form of the six-foot-three Terre- strial to his shoulders. As he straight- ened, a particularly violent upheaval al- most hurled him from his perch, but Tull’s fingers about his ankles saved him. During a brief lull in the volcanic disturbance, the Uranian rumbled, “Now you, Cory.” And the lanky Space-master joined Parker on Tull’s broad shoulders. Giant fingers closed rigidly on Parker’s ankles while Jon Cory stepped into the other’s cupped hands—and in an instant he was teeter- ing dizzily six feet below freedom. Reaching out, he steadied himself against the sloping wall. Now he was faced with the difficult task of turning about, in order to catch Alan Sarett. Somehow he managed it, and stood with shoulders braced against the smooth expanse. “Hurry!” he snapped. “I can’t hold this forever!” Alan Sarett stood before the Uranian with set face. His part in this little gymnastic exhibition was the most dan- gerous. He looked upward through the mist. Cory’s shoulders seemed peril- ously small, and he was rocking back and forth. Alan’s teeth clenched as he felt fingers of steel grasp his arms. A breathless upward rush—and Cory’s long arms wrapped themselves about him in a desperate embrace. An instant they tottered on the brink of collapse while Jon Cory strove mightily to hold a weight that, in Jupiter’s grav- ity, was tremendous. And all grips held! “One more step,” Cory grunted into SareVt’s ear, “and you’re ouU” 74 DYNAMIC Science Stories A LAN nodded jerkily, carefully mounting to Cory’s shoulders. Di- rectly above him was the lip of this damned Pit—almost within arm’s reach —and he could reach it if he could stand up. Cory gripped his ankles now, and he straightened. He balanced him- self, pressing against the wall. His hands curved eagerly around the edge. He could reach it! But it was smooth! How could he expect to pull himself out with so little to support him! The ghost of a doubt floated in his mind—then Parker’s deep voice came up to him: “Make it, boy! Re- member— Brodeur!” And with a mighty surge of strength through mus- cles that cracked with effort, Sarett pulled himself up—and over—out of the Pit! With legs spread wide he peered about him. He saw no one. A half mile away where the Jovians entered and left the Pit, there would be a hand- ful of guards and a few ITL men— but they wouldn’t molest him. He started toward the landing field. Thick underbrush—the pale yellow, fleshy growth that covered all of tem- perate Jupiter—blocked his path. Alan moved through it with a slow, sliding shuffle. And even that dragging pace required tremendous effort, for the great gravity strove mightily to draw him flat against the surface, like a needle on the tip of a magnet. Volubly he cursed the entire planet. It would take an age to reach the supply ship at this rate—and down there in the Pit Cory and Parker and Tull might even now be sinking into a pool of lava. For the intermittent roar of the eruption had not abated in the slightest degree. On he plodded, heart pounding, legs aching under a strain that was almost beyond endurance. Breathing was as difficult here as in the sulphurous air of the Pit; scoria and ashes from the volcano formed a cloud that cloaked everything with hot, stinging dust. But Sarett moved steadily onward, his shoulders hunched forward, his hands clenched hard at his sides. The ship had landed little more than a quarter mile away, but the distance seemed endless to Alan. Yet he made it. Almost exhausted, he halted at last at the edge of the rocket-blasted clear- ing; leaned against an outcropping rock, resting, searching for a sign of life. He knew there were always men stationed about the ITL building on the opposite edge of the field, but he hoped they would be inside. He saw no one. Abruptly he sank to his knees and hands and left the shelter of the leath- ery underbrush. In that position there was less chance of his being seen. Slow- ly he crept across the blackened clear- ing toward the spherical supply ship. He was less than twenty feet from the craft when he heard a heavy hollow rumble like the pounding of many giant feet. He straightened up, glanced in the direction of the Pit—and saw a horde of sluurs sweeping over the un- dergrowth, fleeing from the horrors of the eruption. Their many-jointed legs carried them over the ground with amazing speed despite their vast bulk. They had almost reached the clearing. Now they saw the Terrestrial and a dis- cordant chorus burst from their slits of mouths. Dread swept over Alan Sarett. If they reached the space ship before he did, they’d stamp him into the ground! And the three in the Pit—they’d burn in a lake of lava! The blood drained from his face. His lips drew taut over clenched teeth. Quickly he rose . . . and with great- er strength than he knew he possessed, with a sudden, superhuman effort that centered all his power in his whitely corded legs, he ran to the supply ship, leaped inside, and slid shut the pon- derous airlock! Then he sank into an MUTINEERS OF SPACE 75 exhausted, sweating, inert heap just in- side the door. Moments later he staggered erect. There might be men of the ITL within this craft. He listened. There was no sound save his own harsh breathing and the muffled roar from the Pit. He crossed the vacuum chamber to the in- ner wall of the ship. He closed the sec- ond door behind him. Stealthily he slid along the metal corridor to where he knew the control room must be. The door was closed; it slid slowly aside as he pressed against it. He peered through the crack—then flung the door wide. There was no one in the room. The ship was probably deserted; he knew from experience that space-men usually left their crafts for an hour or two immediately after landing, in order to stretch their legs on solid ground. Eagerly Alan’s fingers gripped a con- trol lever, his eyes glancing automatic- ally over the familiar array of knobs and dials and pointers. As he pressed a button that started an air purifier to clearing the atmosphere of its sulphur stench, and closed a switch that set in motion a gyro-gravitator, imparting to the craft an artificial gravity, elation surged through him at the feeling of power that was his with the controls of a space ship again in his hands. ' I 'HE lever moved down a single A notch, and into the rocket chambers flowed vaporized fuel; a second notch, and the craft trembled with the slow re- lease of power; a third, and she rose gently into the air. Sarett switched on the bank of screens which curved before him, each of its five facets presenting a different view of his surroundings. Be- low him he saw the Jovian horde scat- tering wildly to escape the deluge of fire from the rocket vents; he saw another sluur rushing from the ITL building, carrying a Terrestrial official in its ten- tacles, the latter waving frantic objec- tions. Alan grinned and sent the ship darting upward with another notch of power—upward and northward where the light of the Pit crimsoned the smoky yellow sky. In an instant he was high above the great abyss, skillful manipulation of the controls holding the sphere almost sta- tionary in midair. Anxiety gripped him at what he saw, and he began sinking rapidly. The prison pit was a wide, wide hollow brimming with smoke and flame. Liquid lava, an angry, lurid red, bubbled and surged and swept about everywhere like whirlpools of hell, spouting coiling clouds of yellow-white smoke. Here and there a darker spot was silhouetted against the crimson, an island of solidity in a flaming sea—but they were pitifully few. A sudden qualm of conscience stabbed him when he thought that in part he was respon- sible for this—but memory of Max Bro- deur and of the tortures he had experi- enced down there froze his face into stern implacability. Heading toward a vaguely familiar strip of land under the southern wall, he sank lower and lower. And sud- denly he saw a group of human figures frantically waving, among them the giant, Tull. With all his skill he lowered the ship to a surface that bucked and swayed like the liquid mass beneath it. As he switched off power, he pulled back a lever which opened both portals of the airlock. His eyes turned mechanically toward the screens for a final glance about, and he gasped. Not only were Cory, Parker, and Tull pushing toward the ship; behind them came a score of other convicts! Furiously Sarett rushed from the room. Those maddened creatures— many of them the scum of the System— if they took possession of the space 3hip, it would mean disaster 1 He reached the entrance; Tull was already there. 76 DYNAMIC Science Stories The Uranian stood with his back to the airlock, crouching like a boxer. Now Cory and Parker joined him. The on- coming horde hesitated before the men- acing three, and came to a straggling halt. “No pass,” Tull rumbled ominously. “Ship too small. You stay here!” A howl rose from terror-parched throats, and a burly brute with the thick body and bestial face of a Vene- rian halfcaste roared a foul curse. “C’mon, yuh crimps,” he snarled. “They can’t stop us! ” At that instant a great slab of the obsidian floor broke away with a sick- ening lurch and vanished into the boil- ing lava almost at their feet. The mob swept forward in a wild surge of animal terror. Tull met them with a sweeping, crushing attack of his incredibly long arms, hurling the leaders backward upon those behind them. “Inside, Cory, Parker!” the giant roared. “Quick!” He sent them reel- ing toward the supply ship, and they dragged themselves hastily into the air- lock. “Come on, Tull!” Sarett shouted. “We’ve got to go!” Tull, holding the convicts back like the frothing beasts they resembled, roared over his shoulder: “You go! Me hold these. Go—get Brodeur!” Even as the three Terrestrials shouted frantic protest, a single athletic figure darted suddenly from the mass, straining like a sprinter, and leaped, as Sarett had done, into the airlock! Tull took a step after him, then as a triumphant howl rose from the mob, he swung furiously about. Parker struck viciously at the intruder; then their bodies crashed together and they clinched in a mighty struggle. Cory and Sarett, seeing a churning wall of redly glowing magma rolling toward them, hastened to the control room. Sec- onds counted now! For an endless moment everything seemed to pause in stunned paralysis— then with an awful roar the entire strip of obsidian broke away from the wall! The space ship reeled sickeningly, roll- ing Parker and his combatant back into the corridor—and at that instant the airlock clangcd shut, and the craft leaped toward the safety of the sky! In the control room Alan thought he heard a chorus of screams blend into one spine-chilling sound that swiftly faded into silence. “God!” he said— and it was not a curse. Cory spoke softly. “It’s tough to leave Tull like that, Sarett, but it’d be a damn’ sight worse to let him kick in for nothing!” A LAN SARETT stood motionless at the control bank of the supply- ship Minerva, staring into the tele- screens. His eyes followed the green disc of Jupiter, watching it shrink into a blur of light, till it joined the stars as a point of radiance in the black mosaic of space. At last he faced the center of the room. Lief Parker, grinning his one-sided grin, gestured toward a motionless fig- ure on the floor, then slowly caressed his knuckles. “Well,” he demanded, “what’ll we do with this egg? Smash his shell, or put ’im in cold storage?” He eyed a metal- sqreened porthole thoughtfully. “He’ll be—safe—out there!” Cory shook his head. “Why do any- thing with him? At least, let’s give him a chance to talk. Hell—you can’t blame him for trying to blast out of that damned Pit! We’d ’ve done the same thing.” Sarett nodded. “You’re right, Cory. The four of us were in the same tight spot—and he took the only way out. If he’s the right kind, and plays a MUTINEERS OF SPACE 77 square game, I say he should have his chance.” Parker grunted morosely. “Major- ity rules, o’ course—though I still think I'm right. But, since you insist, let’s wake him up an’ let 'im broadcast.” Minutes later the stranger opened his eyes. The three Space-masters stood over him, motionless, silent, faces ex- pressionless. He arose slowly, his keen gaze shifting from one to the other. He surveyed them narrowly, a hint of hos- tility creeping into the set of his mouth to be banished instantly. Then he smiled, a smile that went no deeper than his lips. And his voice as he spoke bore a hint of arrogance. “I certainly appreciate your recep- tion,” he said. “Nice of you to pull me out of that mess back there. If you had come a minute later, I would be a cinder.” He paused, inspecting the three with an air that bordered on in- solence. “Switch off the funny stuff,” Parker growled, “or you’ll be breathin’ some damned thin air outside that porthole! C’mon—let’s have some dope about yourself!” The other met Parker’s truculent glare with a look of unperturbed calm, then shrugged. “Very well,” he agreed. “My name is Jones—Walter Jones. Second-class space pilot just out of training school. Got caught doing a lit- tle private smuggling—andvMax Bro- deur had me sent to the Pit! And who are you?” Sarett answered. “We were ITL Space-masters, each in command of a cruiser.” He introduced himself, Cory, Parker. “Each of us, working alone, discovered that Max Brodeur, big boss of the ITL, crusader against unfair ex- ploitation of the System’s weaker races —that Max Brodeur, the damned rack- eteer, is the power behind the Uranian slave traffic, and the contraband work- ing of the Mercutian radium mines!” He smiled grimly. “We made the mis- take of trying to do something about it —and we wound up in—hell! ” The other’s eyes widened. “Brodeur —behind that! Why that seems impos- sible—” “But it isn'tl” Parker snapped. “And now we’re out to get him! An’ we’ll be gettin’ him, see? An’ he’ll pay plenty! ” Cory eyed Jones quizzically. “You said Brodeur had you sent to the Pit. Maybe you’d want to join us—” “No maybe about it!” Jones ex- claimed. “Brodeur was responsible for my spell in that sulphur-hole—and I’d like nothing better than to see him get what he deserves. If I may join you, I think I can be of some help, for I know Venus. I received my pilot train- ing in the school in Terra City where Brodeur has his headquarters.” After a few minutes further discus- sion, Walter Jones became the fourth member of the little party. Big Lief Parker, distrustful to the last, made one final statement: “Get this, Jones, an’ get it good! If we catch you in anythin’ shady—it’ll be the last thing you’ll ever do—any- where ! ” Jones smiled thinly. “You won’t catch me in anything shady, Parker. Of that you may be certain.” An hour later, minus the grime and gore of their fight in the Pit, and clad in ITL uniforms found in the ship’s sup- plies, Sarett, Cory, and Parker leaned over the space-chart, studying their po- sition in the heavens. Jones was at the controls a few feet away. “Doesn’t look promising, does it?” Cory remarked. Parker scowled and pointed toward the space chart. “Promising? There’s Jupiter — about four hundred and eighty million miles from the sun. And over here’s Venus, sixty-seven million miles from the other side of the sun. 78 DYNAMIC Science Stories That means we have to cover close to five hundred an’ fifty million miles of space! An’ there’s not enough fuel in this little tank to take us a quarter the distance!” “And we can’t stop at any supply base for more fuel,” Cory added. DARKER grunted disdainfully. “An’ even if we had enough fuel, it would take a crazy amount of time to make it at the rate we’re goin’. There’s only one thing to do—we’ll have to get a bigger, faster boat.” “And I can tell you how we can do it,” Sarett said slowly. He paused thoughtfully while Cory and Parker waited. Jones looked up from the con- trols. “It’s simple,” Alan continued, “and it's feasible, too. Look.” His finger traced a line across the space chart. “Here’s the course of the Mars-Gany- mede passenger-cruiser, Vulcan. I used to have that run—I know her sched- ule.” His finger paused in its move- ment. “She’s due to pass this point in another six hours. We’re just about here—and we can easily be there before them, right in their course. Once there, we set off an automatic radio SOS. They’ll have to stop and investigate— interplanetary law. And when they do, we’ll take over the ship.” Parker laughed derisively. “Yeah— we’d threaten to chastise ’em severely if they didn’t surrender! We’re so well equipped to make ’em behave—armed to the gills an’ all that.” “I mean it,” Sarett insisted. “We can take the ship—and it shouldn’t be very difficult. When they make a trans- fer from one boat to another—ITL boats, that is—they swing toward each other till their airlocks touch, and the openings are sealed together with the rubber collars that rim the ’locks. Isn’t that right?” They nodded. “And after the transfer is made, both ’locks are sealed, the connection is broken, and the deserted ship is pulled along on a trailer cable. Right?” “Sure,” Cory grunted, “that’s ele- mentary. So what?” “Simply this. First we get as close as possible to the Vulcan’s orbit. Then we get into space suits, check them for leaks, and stop the air purifiers; after that we tap out about a quart of rocket fuel from the tanks, mix it with a little Martian garra pH, and set it afire. I needn’t tell you what’ll happen to any- one breathing the fumes. One whiff will paralyze them for an hour or two. . . . Well, when everything’s set, we start the SOS signal. Then when they pick us up, and our airlock opens, and their airkck opens—tell me, will it work?” Parker began pacing the floor ex- citedly. “Damned if it doesn’t look feasible!” he exclaimed. “Crew, pas- sengers, everybody knocked out. We’d only have to tie ’em up an’ carry ’em into this tub. We could set ’em adrift or drag ’em after us, droppin’ ’em some place where they’d be picked up. Or even better, we could stow ’em down below somewhere, ’cause they can’t breathe hydro-garra fumes too long an’ live.” He stopped short. “Yeah—but what if the Vulcan doesn’t stop?” Sarett shrugged. “Then we’d be ex- actly where we are now. But they will stop. Space law demands it.” The cool voice of Jones came to them from the controls. “Why all the objec- tions? The plan has a chance of suc- ceeding—I don’t think any of us have a better suggestion—so let’s go!” And so it was decided. After com- puting the probable position of the Vul- can with the utmost care, they sent the little supply ship roaring through space at top speed. Cory was at the con- trols. Several hours would elapse be- fore they reached the passenger lane; while they waited, Parker prepared a hurried meal; Jones broke out the space MUTINEERS OF SPACE 79 suits, and Sarett made ready the mix- ture of rocket fuel and garra oil. After they had eaten they ranged themselves before the tele-screens . . . waiting. On and on the little craft sped. An hour passed—another—and suddenly Cory exclaimed: “Almost there!” With forward rocket vents he thecked their pace and carefully jock- eyed the Minerva into position. Be- hind him the others got busy. In less than ten minutes the stage was set. All four were clad in the clumsy balloon- like suits used for exposure in airless space, a dome of glass forming their head-gear. Individual radio transmit- ters and receivers in each suit made communication possible. The purifiers had been checked, and from a small- mouthed vessel in the middle of the con- trol room rose barely visible clouds of lethal vapor. The televisor was send- ing an automatic SOS into the void. Anxiously the four watched the screens, waiting for the sensitive instru- ment to pick up sight of the passenger cruiser. And it came—a speck of mov- ing light against the silver-splashed backdrop of space. Instantly Sarett sprang to the tele- visor. Plugging a wire into his speaker, he connected it with the instrument, switched off the automatic distress sig- nal, and sent his own voice through the ether. “First Lieutenant Freeman of supply ship Minerva.. We’re out of fuel; we’ve drifted far off our course. Our air puri- fiers are out of order and our supply of oxygen is exhausted. Can you take us aboard?” He waited—and a reply came. “Pilot Turner of the Vulcan. We hear you, Minerva. By order of Space- master Stuart we are swinging along- side. Be ready to transfer.” “Check, Vulcan. We are ready.” Alan broke contact, switched off the televisor, and turned to the others. ‘Take it fast,” he snapped grimly. “Speed is what we’ll need.” '"TENSELY they watched the ap- proaching cruiser, her sunward side gleaming like the head of a comet. Roc- ket blasts shot alternately from for- ward, rear, and lateral vents as the pilot eased the Vulcan closer to the smaller craft. In moments both spheres were flashing along at equal velocity, side by side. Cory flung over the lever that opened the inner door of the airlock; it filled rapidly with the almost invisible vapor. Voiceless, the four crouched in the door- way. There was a brittle tension in the air, as though something tremendous were gathering its forces to shatter it- self. Now they heard the clash ef metal against metal as giant cables flung out huge magnetized hooks which seized metal rings set in the Minerva’s sur- face. There were other scraping sounds, the clamping of airlock to airlock. Then silence. And in another instant a sharp tapping on the metal door. At Sarett’s nod, Parker thrust back a lever—and they were gazing along a wide passage- way into the Vulcan! Nine men crouched there, three of them officers, the other six men of the crew. And each gripped a grimly point- ing rocket pistol! For half a breath the four mutineers stood as though stunned. Their escape had been reported, Sarett thought swiftly—then too much happened too quickly for thought. The Space-master gesturing with his pistol, his lips mov- ing in curt, unheard words; a hand leap- ing to his throat in sudden surprise and annoyance; his knees buckling! Even as he sagged floorward, Alan saw his eyes strike the glass encased face of Jones, saw those eyes widen with in- credulous recognition—then he sank 80 DYNAMIC Science Stories limply on his face. Seconds, it took; and others were falling, too startled to remember their weapons. The four charged swiftly to- ward the crumbling mass. One of the crew, still alert, whipped back a lever with lightning speed—the door shot shut—but Cory was quicker! His long body, darting ahead, leaped fully into the opening I And the ponderous metal disc crashed against him! There was a horrible crunching sound, a r'aglike sagging of Cory’s body —then a strange cessation of all mo- tion. A stunned instant—and Sarett led the others in a leap toward the door. They flung their weight against it, thrusting it along its grooved track, its catch clicking into place. Cory slumped forward, and Sarett caught him. Gently he lowered him to the floor, ignoring everything else. “Cory—is it—are you badly hurt?” He shook him gently, his face grim, his words only audible to himself. “Cory —did—did they get you?” Wearily the other’s eyes opened. He smiled faintly, struggling to speak. Then Sarett saw his lips form the words: “Get Brodeurl” And he died. White with fury, a dull ache in his chest, Alan Sarett leaped erect and glared about. The floor was strewn with unconscious space-men. Parker and Jones were not in sight. Warily he moved along the hallway, stepping over the still bodies. He entered the main corridor. Here a man lay, his feet twisted awkwardly beneath him. There another—then a woman. He passed them with only a casual glance, his eyes searching for his two companions. Then he saw them, approaching rapidly. When they were close enough, Parker spoke, his half-grin expressing great satisfaction. “They’re all under— couldn’t find a single one conscious.” Then he saw Sarett’s solemn face, and his own sobered. “Is it bad?” “Cory’s dead.” Sarett’s nostrils di- lated, and his eyes narrowed. “By damn —Brodeur will pay—for him and Tull!" Solemnly Parker nodded. “We can’t help Cory—but we won’t let ’im down. Two of us now—but we’ll show that crimp that two’s plenty!” “Three, you mean,” Jones said. “Don’t forget me. We’re all out to get Brodeur, you know.” Sarett and Parker snapped hard, sus- picious glances at the other. There seemed to be a sneer in his voice, but he met their scrutiny with a stare of bland innocence. “Don’t you think we’d better get those sleepers down below in the hold?” he asked. “I’d like to get out of this suit, and we’ve got to clear the air first.” “Yeah,” Sarett growled. Parker only nodded. There were bitter words on his tongue, eager for expression, but he swallowed them. In grim silence they set to work. Morosely Alan Sarett and Lief Park- er stared into the Vulcan’s tele-screens. On all facets save one was the blackness of space, the hard twinkle of distant suns, and the softer gleam of scattered planets—in all but one and in that lay the blinding Solar disc rimmed by its awesome corona. A spectacular sight, sharp against the blackness. Not far away floated Mercury, like a polished copper coin, tiny world of unbearable heat and wealth beyond reckoning. DUT the two Space-masters barely saw either body; their thoughts were of other things. “The more I see of this Jones,” Park- er was saying, “the less I want to see of him.” Sarett frowned. “I know. He seems to be carrying a crooked cargo. Yet we can’t condemn a man just because we don’t like him.” MUTINEERS OF SPACE 81 “The hell we can’t 1” Parker grunted, “lean!” He paused. “Ever since we put him in charge of the prisoners down below, he’s been walkin’ around with that damned smirk on his loud speaker —an’ I don’t like it! I’ve watched him, an’ everythin’ seems okay, but I don’t believe it is!” His lips set in sudden determination. “Hell—why talk about it? I’m goin’ to lay him out where he can’t do any damage.” “You’ll do what, Mr. Parker?” Parker and Sarett whirled at a suave voice behind them; stared into the steady muzzles of two rocket pistols! In the doorway stood the man who called himself Walter Jones, still smil- ing his shallow smile! A single curse escaped Parker; then he was silent. “The little farce is over, gentlemen,” Jones said amiably. “You’ve served your purpose quite well, and your free- dom is now at an end. I’ve decided against killing you, however—unless you compel me to do so.” He half turned, though his eyes and pistols did not waver. “Come in, boys!” In from the corridor strode two men in the garb of Officers—Spacemaster Stuart and one of his Lieutenants. Each held a weapon in one hand and a coil of rope in the other! “Meet two of my assistants,” Jones said. “Both are men of integrity and discretion, not to mention—” “Hell!” Parker roared through his teeth, his throat corded with rage, “cut the comedy! If you want to say some- thin’, spill it! If you don’t, shut up, an’ do somethin’!” Sarett remained silent, his narrowed eyes watching every move of the three before him. The smile froze on Jones’ face. “Very well,” he said slowly. “Would it in- terest you to know that I am Max Bro- deur?” “Brodeur! ” As one Sarett and Park- er gasped the name. Alan’s thoughts reeled. Brodeur—here! And these two space-men were his aides! “Yes, Brodeur!” All suavity was gone from his voice now; it sounded a harsh monotone through the control room. “Max Brodeur in that hell-pit—- because of your talking! Yes; your meddling caused an investigation—and they condemned me to the Pit for life! I should kill you—but I have a better idea. You were so kind as to bring us this close to Mercury—and that’s where you’ll spend the next six or eight months —if you live that long I Slaves in the radium mines! Perhaps you’ve heard how those mines affect the workers— radium bums—terrible sores—blind- ness—insanity. . . . I’m sure it will be far more satisfactory than merely killing you! “Tie them up, boys!” As the space-men approached, Sa- rett’s thoughts raced wildly. To hurl himself at those ready pistols would be suicide, but to let them fie him would be just as certain, if slower, death. There was one chance—a desperate one— He hea/d Brodeur’s voice: “Turn around with your hands behind you!” As he turned, a space-man grasped his wrists; he felt the rope circle them —and he leaped toward the controls he knew so well! His body struck the master switch, wrenching it open. A rocket blast roared past him knifing into the control panel—and utter darkness fell upon the cruiser! The room roared into a bed- lam. With alarmed cries the space- men fell back toward Brodeur; and a hail of fire poured over the spot where Sarett and Parker had been standing. But neither was there; with the dark- ness they had dropped; were rolling to- ward their three assailants. The light of the pistols might have revealed their position, but everything 82 DYNAMIC Science Stories happened too rapidly. One moment they were standing passively; the next, in darkness, they were rolling across the floor; the third, they had seized the three and had hurled them from their feet! Brodeur crashed upon Sarett; Parker had tackled the other two. Flaming rocket pistols whirled and clattered into blackness—and it was man to man in the dark! With wild, fierce exultation Sarett flung his hands upward about the body, seeking a throat. The words flamed through his brain—get Brodeur I They were on their feet—reeled apart to close again instantly. The shock of their meeting was like the clap of hands. Get Brodeur! Alan’s lips curled wolfishly. This was the man who had ordered him to that Jovian hell! This, the Uranian slaver. This, the man re- sponsible for the death of Cory, of Tull! Crimson battle-flame flared within him, tempered with a cold, cold fury. One hand ground into a thick shoulder; the other lashed heavily against a lean jaw. ROWLING a curse, Brodeur grasped Alan’s throat with both hands; and as Sarett wrenched free he felt a foot land heavily against his shin. Pain burned fiery hot through the out- raged bone, and he wrapped his arms about Brodeur in red rage. A short arm jab glanced from his chin and he rocked back on his heels—then lunged forward again, into a clinch. Their legs coiled about each other, and they dropped to the floor. Over and over they rolled, striking blow after blow, gouging, kick- ing like two beasts, all reason gone from their struggle. Suddenly they were on their feet again, striking blows through the dark- ness. Brodeur stumbled—and Alan caught him in a deadly grip that came unsought. One arm gripped him vise- like beneath the shoulders; the other hand thrust upward against his chin. Alan’s fingers ground his lips against his teeth, and the leverage forced his head steadily backward. Dimly he heard Brodeur suck in a tortured breath; and an awful scream tore through the dark- ness. He eased the pressure for an in- stant—then he remembered Cory gasp- ing out his life—and his muscles tight- ened grimly. Brodeur wrapped his legs about Alan’s body in a last desperate grip, fear of death pouring strength into his thighs. As the pressure grew, straining about him painfully, Sarett suddenly flung himself face downward upon the floor, his full weight striking the head and bent neck of Max Brodeur. There was a dull, nauseating snap, and he lay still. Slowly Alan rose, panting hoarsely, reaction trembling in his limbs. He listened for sounds of Lief Parker and his two combatants; heard: “C’mon—c’mon! Can’t a guy get a decent fight in this corner o’ space? Two of you—an’ you break like eggs! . . . Hey, Alan, how you doin’?” “It’s—over,” Alan answered. “Let’s have a light.” He groped toward the control panel; fumbled till he found the master switch; closed it- Light flickered on in the chamber, uncertain light that wavered with the vibration of loose connections. It re- vealed three men lying awkwardly on the rocket blasted floor. One would never move again. Life still clung to the other two. ... It revealed a con- trol panel hopelessly etched and burned by a barrage of rocket blasts. Miracu- lously, two facets of the tele-screen had survived the holocaust; in one flamed an image of the sun. And it was spread- ing out, filling the screen—leaping up at them with frightful speed! They were falling into the sun! Instantly Sarett leaped to the con- trols, flung on checking rocket blasts— but there was no response. He tried MUTINEERS OF SPACE 83 again—futilely. He shrugged. No sense in attempting to repair this ruin before him. He looked at Parker in silence. Lief Parker’s lips twisted in his one- sided grin, his eye half closing. “Looks bad, eh? Well—we’ll be goin’ the way Tull an’ Cory went—an’ we’re takin’ that crimp with us!” He gestured to- ward the floor. “I’m satisfied.” Sarett scowled. “But those passen- gers and Space-men down below—” He stopped short, a slow smile appearing on his face. “Say—we must be slip- ping! The Minerva! What’s to pre- vent our clearing her atmosphere, re- fueling her from the Vulcan’s tank, and blasting in under her power? It’ll take a good while for us to fall forty-odd million miles—we’ll have plenty of time to make the change.” Parker’s grin spread itself to the other side of his mouth. “So that’s what brains are for!” he exclaimed. “We’ll land on the moon,” Alan con- tinued, “and radio the ITL headquar- ters gn Earth about the Vulcan. And after that—well, we’ll be outlawed, I suppose—” Parker interrupted excitedly, “Say— I know what we’ll do after that! We’ll grab us one of those new interstellar ships from the shops on the moon, an’ we’ll roam the sky as we damn’ please! We’ll—hell, we’ll see an’ do plenty! Is it a go?” Alan Sarett looked at the other panel of the tele-screen which had escaped the barrage of pistol fire. There were a million worlds out there, gleaming like eyes, glaring at him with a cold, chal- lenging light. Worlds—with adventures enough for a million lifetimes. A warmth appeared on his face reflecting an inner glow. His hand shot out and gripped Parker’s—hard. “It’s a go,” he said.

In one corner of the great vaulted chamber a fretful generator vi- brated through an ever-rising tonic se- quence to still itself in the silence of ultra-sound. A dim filament flared into a point of sparkling light, and Dor Jar nodded briefly to his assistant. Silently the young mechanic pressed a button on the towering metal banks before him. Gears meshed. Wires, strung high above, hummed with an er- 85 86 DYNAMIC Science Stories ratic vibration. Ozone crackled in the thin air, and a silent wave of power winged its way with the swiftness of light toward the pale green planet glow- ing in the darkness of the void. . . . “Missing half your life. That’s all there is to it!” declared the cheerful young man. “Nothing like a little home of your own with a plot of ground. ‘Bring your friend out to dinner,’ says my wife, ‘we’ll show him what real home life is.’ Great girl, my wife. You’ll like her. You say you’ve never been out to this section before?” “Never,” answered the other. With distaste he noted the tidy monotony of the small suburban community. Uni- form stucco cottages; a thousand homes with a thousand similar tiny grass plots, a thousand cheery lights burning in a thousand windows for a thousand hus- bands to “come home to.” His nostrils twitched with the crisping odor of a thousand chops frying on a thousand “Little Genius” gas ranges. . . . “Yes sir, nothing like it!” boasted his host again. “Marry and settle down is what I always say. You’ll see for your- self in a minute. My house is just around the corner and past—” “—the gas station,” finished the vis- itor. “What?

I’ve never been to Highland Corners before. But all of a sudden, somehow I felt as though I’d seen this section a long, long time ago. . . IN the telescope chamber of the Flag- *	staff Observatory, Sir Humphrey Wimpole, R.A., shook his head as he argued with his American friend and colleague. “No, Wallace,” he said didactically, “I’m afraid we must discard your fanci- ful theory of life on other planets. If you’ll forgive my saying so, it smacks too much of the romantic. Like those incredible yarns one reads in the sci- ence-fiction magazines. Why, the at- mospheric conditions, the lack of warmth and light, the shortage of oxy- gen—” “But, Sir Humphrey,” insisted Pro- fessor Wallace, “you must remember this. All life need not be exactly in the same form as ours. Different bodies, adapted to strange environments. A different form of reasoning, perhaps—” “Tut, tut!” shrugged the British scientist impatiently. “All reasoning is based on the same fundamentals. You know as well as I do that the Milan Ob- servatory has been attempting to com- municate with other planets for more than thiry years. “Twenty-four hours a day they broadcast a series of signals based on pure mathematics—the science which all logical creatures must recognize.

Then a four—with a pause. “Surely if there were intelligent crea- tures, say on Mars, they would under- stand the fundamental principle of this squaring factor—and send us a logical solution! ” He stopped abruptly and passed a be- wildered hand over his broad face. The American leaped up. “Sir Humphrey! What’s wrong? Shall I get water?” “No—nothing, thanks,” faltered the visiting astronomer. “It’s nothing at all. Just a peculiar sensation, such as we all experience occasionally. For an instant I felt that I had been through this same scene once ... oh, a long time ago! And this is my first visit to Amer- ica.

Lean, leathery-faced Dr. Burstone nodded his iron-gray head. Bright flecks of light gleamed again in his dull, knowledge-weary eyes, eager lights, they were, as if the spirit of youth still burned in that old body. “ T ISTEN .. Out of the fastness of the -■—* night-steeped jungle, from no- where and from everywhere, from the star-studded sky overhead and the foetid earth beneath, came a thin, sibilant, crackling sound, like the part- ing of a taut violin string. Swiftly it ran around the rim of the world, like a sharp sword slicing the night in twain. Then it withdrew into the unknown void that gave it birth. The jungle was silent. As he stumbled backward, Markle saw the old ethnologist reach up and grasp the switches Those two Americans were condemned to the wrath of incredible scientific devices by the great Mayan fire gods—for they had brashly violated the sanctity of that beautiful girl in the Zipantoric ball of flame! “I heard it,” he answered softly. “If you turn around, you’ll see it.” Dick whirled. They were standing on top of the Pyramid of the Sun which formed a part of a far-flung colony of the ancient Mayas that they had dis- covered hidden and long deserted in the jungle of northern South America. They were no longer alone on the flat-topped structure. An upright oval of golden fire as tall as a man was glow- ing on the western edge of the parapet. It was not flame in the meaning of the word when it is associated with com- 90 DYNAMIC Science Stories bustion, there was no suggestion of heat, the glow was not feeding on anything. It looked like a huge football standing on end and was about the same color. It apparently was electrical in nature, and slightly resembled ball lightning, except that no lightning ball ever known to man was a hundredth part as large as this. P\ICK heard Burstone catch his breath. Out of the corner of his eyes he saw that the old ethnologist was trembling, yet Dick knew it was not from fear. The scientist did not know the meaning of that word. “What is it?” he whispered. “I don’t know, lad,” Burstone an- swered. “Don’t move. . Something is going to happen.” The golden bubble of flame glowed more vividly. Its flame came from innumerable coruscating points that were visible yet did not illuminate the soft tropic darkness. It glowed like yel- low witch-fire, like golden phosphores- cence. As they watched, the pin-points of light swirled, glimmered, raced in weird circles, coalesced, took on a vague out- line. It looked like a television receiver that was out of phase with the trans- mitter; racing across the reception screen was an incoherent ramification of swirling white dots. The lambent dots of light moved into phase and almost disappeared, leaving only a thin bubble of golden light. Within that bubble of flame was a girl. The golden light played over her lithe body, shimmered from the metal ornaments that covered her breasts, flickered and danced from a light skirt that fell half-way to her knees, coalesced in the circle of metal that crossed her forehead, met in an arch at the top of her small head, played lov- ingly through the midnight hair that cascaded over her shoulders. In her right hand she held a slender rod. Mar- kle gasped. That rod was ornamented with the design of the Feathered Serpent, potent symbol among the pre- historic Mayans. Dick started to move forward, but he felt Burstone’s hand tighten on his arm. “Easy, Markle,” the old scientist whispered, suppressed eagerness vibrat- ing ill his voice. “She is carrying the scepter of the Feathered Serpent. I think she is probably a priestess of Zi- pantoric.” “But what is it, a mirage?” the younger man questioned. “I don’t think so. I think that girl is alive, somewhere.” “How can she be alive? The Mayans mysteriously disappeared centuries ago.” “Perhaps, somewhere in this wilder- ness, a colony survived, and expanded their science to dizzy heights, outstrip- ping, with their earlier start, the younger science of the Aryan races.” Burstone’s voice was alive with eager- ness. “Maybe,” he continued, “we are see- ing the transmission of images to any desired spot without the necessity of cumbersome receiving apparatus. It sounds impossible but who knows that it is impossible. Anything may be true. Watch . ..” Imperiously, the girl in the golden bubble raised the rod. She had the haughty, regal bearing of a queen who was accustomed to commanding and having her commands obeyed. If it was a mirage, a television pro- jection, it was a remarkably realistic one. Dick could see the tiny ear-rings she wore in the lobes of her golden pink ears. He could see the deep black of her eyes, and the haughty look that was within them. She raised the scepter, brought down QUEST OF ZIPANTORIC 91 the tip, so that it pointed at them. She could see them, she knew they were there! Dick felt that the finger of fate was pointing at them. He had the feeling when her scepter pointed at him that he was being selected for some un- guessed sacrifice to some unknown but potent deity. It had the appearance of a ritual, the selection of a victim. The haughty look within her eyes confirmed this feeling. He shook of! Burstone’s arm, stepped forward, his lithe six feet overshadow- ing the girl. When he moved she seemed to be- come aware of his existence as an in- dividual. The haughty look in her eyes faded, she looked at him as a girl may look at a man, and in her eyes was sud- denly startled concern. Dick’s face was oddly pinched as he gazed at her. In his mind was turmoil, which coalesced in a nervous tension that was transmitted to his muscles. He did not will to act, he did not know where his muscles got their orders. IGNORING Burstone’s warning shout *	he leaped into that bubble of golden fire. A wave of sick agony shot through his body, the bubble collapsed, he held in his arms a writhing struggling girl. She was real. He could feel her. What he had thought was a mirage was reality. The girl was alive, here. Burstone’s flashlight cut a cone of radiance through the night. The girl cowered away from it. She was afraid of that flashlight. “Release her, lad,” Burstone whis- pered. Dick let his arms drop. She slipped out of his grasp, drew herself erect, stood proud and haughty before them, only tiny muscular tremors showing that she was frightened. She flinched, but she faced the flashlight. Its rays poured over her golden brown body. She spoke. Markle, standing, beside her, saw her lips move and knew that he heard the words. At that moment it did not occur to him to think it strange that he knew what the words meant. “Who dares to profane Zantha by touching her sacred body?” “M a y a n! ” ejaculated Burstone. “She is speaking Mayan. I recognize elements of it.” “But the meaning of her words,” Markle interrupted. “I know what her words mean—in English! When she speaks, I see mental pictures . . . and I	know what she is saying . . .” He turned to the girl. “How . . “You have the answer,” she replied. “I make you see pictures in your mind, and you know what I am saying .. “Mental telepathy! ” Burstone gasped. “Brought to perfection.” “Can you understand us?” he asked the girl. “Certainly. You and your comrade have strong minds and I can easily grasp your thought impulses.” “\\Tio are you?” Burstone con- tinued. “I am Zantha, which means high priestess to . . .” She stopped, a glint of fear coming into her eyes. Burstone and Markle got a chaotic mental image of fright. “Listen,” she breathed. “Do you hear them?” Dimly, vaguely, lost in the tropic night came a sobbing, rhythmic rumble. It was flung upward to the hot stars that throbbed through the hot darkness and flung by them back to earth. The two men listened. Like the beat of a gigantic heart, it pounded into their minds, rousing impulses buried deep under the culture of centuries. Each vaguely remembered things he had known in some long time as he listened to that sobbing murmur coming from afar through the jungle night. Thin ghosts rose to stalk through their minds. 92 DYNAMIC Science Stories specter wraiths from the long ago when the impossible happened on earth, and men believed it. “Drums!” said Markle softly. No other word was spoken. Out of Burstone’s and Markle’s minds, over nerve paths anciently rutted, a tense- ness crept to the muscles. Deep within their bodies chemical changes took place that they did not know about. Each tendon sent in an order for an extra supply of blood, each nerve cell gave the command to clear the decks for action. Markle bent to the stone ledge, picked up a heavy hunting rifle he had laid there when they climbed the pyramid. Burstone saw the movement but said nothing. And now a new note came into the sobbing of the drums. At first it had been questioning, com- plaining; now it was compelling. And it threatened. Definitely it threatened. All living things that moved upon the earth were included in the magnificent sweep of its threat. Subtly yet in- cisively it voiced a warning. “They’ve changed,” said Dick Markle. “I hear it,” Doctor Burstone an- swered. Somewhere, off to the west where the Andes pushed up toward heaven, the drums were throbbing frenziedly. And now, nearer at hand, another drum took up the beat. Thum, thum, thum . . . thum, thum, thum... . No written word will convey the meaning of the drums. Zantha knew what they meant. There was no trace of fear on her features when she spoke. Her chin was up. Haughtily, proudly, she faced the west. Somewhere, somehow, she had learned how to die. “The Wardens are coming for us,” she said. II HO are the Wardens?” Dick questioned. “Why are they coming for us? What will they do?” “Those whose duty it is to guard Zi- pantoric, they are coming. They come for you because I named you to be of- fered on the altar. They come for me because you have touched me, have pro- faned me. No one may touch the high priestess ...” “Zipantoric!” Burstone whistled. “The fire god of the Mayans! Some- where near here his tomb must stil! exist, his worship preserved by this lost colony. What a find! Our names will go down in history!” The old ethnolo- gist was wildly excited. “What will they do to you?” Dick asked, his mind reverting to Zantha. “I shall see Zipantoric,” she an- swered, her voice a hard whisper in the night. “Those who see Zipantoric never wish to see anyone else,” Burstone in- terpolated. “She means she will be sacrificed.” “Not while I have a cartridge for this rifle,” Markle grimly interrupted. “Your little weapon will not stop the Wardens,” she disdainfully replied. Markle could not grasp the meaning of the thought image that she used. “I pity any Warden that gets in my sights,” he answered. “Meanwhile let’s start getting out of this country, while we can. Another drum is talking out there, now. If we can make the river, we’ll have a chance.” As they scrambled down the pyramid, their way lighted by Burstone’s multi- celled flashlight, they heard still an- other drum start its frenzied pounding. They moved rapidly. The drums drove them to haste. Deep wi.thin their minds long untouched nerve centers QUEST OF ZIPANTORIC 93 knew what the drums were hunting. For they are old, as old as the race; and fear is older. Off beyond the rim of the world an- other drum was booming. The dull throbbing stalked like beasts of prey through the jungle darkness. Like the great carnivora, they were hunting in the night, hunting for something. Burstone, moving rapidly in advance of Zantha and Markle, marveled at the effect that throbbing note had on a civil- ized mind. Wise was he in the history of the race. To ethnology he had de- voted the study of a life time. The rum- ble of primitive drums awakened some- thing in him that he scarcely knew existed. Their camp was but a few hundred yards distant. When they reached it, they found it deserted. The native workers they had employed to help them in excavating the ruins of this lost city had fled into the jungle night. The savage fears the darkness more than any other thing. His imagination peoples it with hobgoblins, evil spirits. He knows from bitter experience that the beasts of prey are there and he is afraid. Burstone knew this and he marveled at the magnitude of the fear that sent natives to hiding in the place they feared most. One native alone remained. Pedro, their guide and interpreter, was sulking in the main tent, searching for some- thing to steal before he left. Markle collared him. “Where are the men, Pedro?” “They ’fraid, and run off . . .” “The devil! It’s lucky you didn’t get away. You can guide us to the river. Pedro, you savvy the drums. What say?” Pedro squirmed, glanced nervously at the dark forest. “No can tell.” “Cleanse the filth out of your ears and listen again. What say?” “They talk of Zipantoric, master. They say ... he comes .. “How does he . . . Hey! Stop!” But the guide had slipped around the corner of the tent They saw him once in the light from the still glowing fires, a bronze shadow against the dark green of the environing forest verdure. He slipped past the bole of a gigantic tree and the jungle night swallowed him. “Pah! He is afraid. The ignorant children of the forest are always full of fear,” Zantha spoke. She had re- mained in the background and Pedro had not seen her. JV/TARKLE turned to her. “Zantha,” he spoke slowly, “perhaps you can tell us how we can evade these Wardens. If we can get out of this section we will be safe. Far to the northward there is a great country where we can find refuge. There we can gather many men, and return and sweep this wilderness, but how can we escape now?” “No one has ever escaped the War- dens. No one ever will. They follow the trail like hunting dogs until their quarry is captured. We cannot evade them. . . . Are . . . are you full of fear, like a child of the forest?” “I am not afraid ... for myself. If you can read my mind, you know why I am afraid.” She placed one hand shyly on his arm. “Yes. ... I know. . . . We will try, but I do not think we will suc- ceed. We must go toward the rising sun, as rapidly as we can. It may be that they will not be able to follow swiftly in the darkness.” Burstone went into their tent, came out with a small medicine kit, a knap- sack of food, a rifle, extra ammunition. “Get another light, extra batteries, a light pack of food,” he said to his young assistant. . . . “Let’s get out of here 94 DYNAMIC Science Stories while we have the opportunity. The na- tives in all probability have a sound ba- sis for the fear they have shown. I think Zantha knows what she is talking about, too. But we’ll come back, if we have to bring the marines . . There was a grimness in the tone of the old ethnologist. He meant what he said. He had seen enough to know that fame awaited him here in this wilder- ness, but fame amounted to little in comparison with the keen scientific cu- riosity which Zantha had aroused. He knew that she belonged to the divergent, dominant group that had ruled the Mayans in ancient times. From the skeletons found in the burial places eth- nologists knew that the Mayans were dark-skinned, round-headed, short, and sturdy, but rare evidence indicated that another people, a taller people, had ruled them, and this ruling class had puzzled ethnologists for years. . . . Unquestionably Zantha belonged to that class. She would have at her fin- ger tips the culture of the lost people, could explain their dispersion. Per- haps she could explain that golden bub- ble in which she had been transported from that lost city of the west to the peak of the Pyramid of the Sun. She was waiting beside him while Markle rummaged in the tent. He spoke to her. “Zantha, how did you reach the top of the pyramid where we found you? What was the appearance of fire that surrounded you?” “The knowledge of its operation is not mine. I was sent out from the tomb in accordance with the ritual, to desig- nate who shall see his face, the Great One. I enter a small chamber there, and move as I will to move. When your son leaped into the bubble, the force was broken. I do not know how it op- erates. It had always been there, since the Great One came from the sky . . .” “My son?” Burstone was puzzled. “The young man, whom you call now Deeck and now Mar-kel. Is he not your son?” “No,” Burstone answered. “I wish he was, but I have no son.” “He obeys you.” “Yes. He is my assistant. We have been studying the Mayan ruins here.” “I do not understand. If he is not your son is he your slave?” “He is neither. In our civilization there are no slaves, except economic ones. Here he is now, ready to go. Later, Zantha, I will explain to you. If there is a later,” he added, turning an ear to the sky where the thum-thum- thum-thum of the drums reverberated. TOWARD the east they went, Bur- A stone leading the way and Markle bringing up the rear. There was only a vestige of a trail which they had cleared when they entered this section. The fast growing vegetation had already re- claimed it in places. Thorns snatched at them, creeping briars tore at their clothes, low limbs obstructed their way. Dick, bringing up the rear, knew those briars must be tearing Zantha’s bare legs, but he never heard a whimper out of her. A mile, two miles, they fought their way forward. The beat of the drums kept pace with them, urged them to greater haste. They topped a small hill. Bur- stone’s light caught an object on the ground. A man lay there. “Pedro,” said Burstone tersely, bend- ing over the prone figure. Zantha and Markle came up. Mar- kle held a light while Burstone lifted the head of the native in his arms. A narrow livid burn was seered across his face, cut to the bone. It touched the right eye and the eye-ball was a charred mass, arched down across the nose, which showed as a gaping hole, lay bare the right cheek, so that the teeth and QUEST OF ZIPANTORIC 95 jawbones were visible, cut a nasty gash across the right shoulder and arm. An- other burn showed in the lower chest and angled downward toward the stomach. Pedro opened his left eye, and in that single orb was madness. He tried to squirm away into the darkness, but no strength was left in his body. “Easy, Pedro,” Burstone soothed. “We are your friends. What hap- pened?” Broken, halting native dialect came gaspingly from the torn lips. His voice was whining, pleading. Markle could not understand the words but Burstone leaned closer. “Gods with tongues of fire from the grave of the fire god,” the ethnologist translated. “He says they chased him, and they touched him with their tongues, which burned like fire. He says he ran away from us because the drums talked of the fire god, saying that the voice of the fire god had whis- pered in the night, and that the men who serve the fire god were abroad, seeking, seeking, seeking . . Markle was sick at his stomach, sick with the meaning of the words and sick with nausea at the sight of the gaping teeth visible through the torn lips. “He says they are here, now, watch- ing us. . . . He says . . The head of the native dropped low- er. He died. Very gently Burstone laid the torn body back on the earth. His eyes stabbed questions at Zantha. “The poor forest child was struck by a beam from the flame rod of a Chosen One. A Warden found him. They have no compassion, these Wardens,” there was a tiny tremor in her voice. “So they will treat us, when they find us . . ” “How does this heat rod work?” “I do not know. The Wardens point it at anything they wish to destroy, a bright light comes out, and whatever it is pointed at, burns . . .” “Will it operate from inside the gold- en bubble?” “The Wardens are not permitted to venture into the bubble. That is re- served for Zantha, the high priestess.” “I’m glad to learn that,” Markle in- terposed. “I have been afraid those things would start dropping down on us by the dozens.” “They will not come in that manner, but they will come.” As she spoke a soft glow spread over them. It came on so softly and so smoothly that they scarcely realized it was happening. Zantha’s sharp whis- per brought Burstone to his feet, and whirled Markle around to face their rear. J | "ALL, faintly bronzed, statuesque, a *■ man faced them, holding a short rod from which flooded a blaze of soft light. He was naked except for a glittering belt that circled his waist, bands that enclosed his biceps, and a conical head- piece. The features were regular, and very calm. No hint or trace of pas- sion showed on that face. Neither good nor evil was there. Only a vast calmness that seemed to look down up- on the world from a great height, that saw, and understood, and was unmoved. He looked like an ancient god from out of the olden times, before whose eyes had passed unnumbered sacrifices, to whom had been offered incense and smoke from the burning of flesh upon the altars, who had known fear and worship down the long roll of the cen- turies, and who was unmoved by human suffering. A Chosen One, a Warden of Zipan- toric. . . . From his weapon streamed soft light, but Markle knew that from that short rod could come a beam that would sear through a human body, he knew it, but 96 DYNAMIC Science Stories . . . He slipped the safety catch and his rifle roared from his hip. A tiny hole appeared in the throat of the Warden, a red stream rilled down the bronze chest. . . . He did not move, but over his face shot a look of shocked surprise. To a Chosen One had come a new thing. It reft his calmness as a mask is torn from a mummer, and the tortured face, for one wild second, was the face of Mom- us. The bullet, piercing the throat, had shattered the spinal column. ... He slumped to the earth. Ill MARKLE caught a flash of amazement from the mind of Zantha. She had not thought that this could happen. Before her eyes a Warden had died. What manner of men are these—Markle caught the thought—who can so easily destroy a Chosen One? “Sweet Joseph!” he heard Burstone mutter. Markle wanted that short rod from which the soft light flooded. The still fingers of the Warden gripped it. He loosened them, carried it to Zantha, and she showed him how it operated. A tiny button on the side controlled the beam. He pointed it toward the for- est, experimented with the button. The soft glow narrowed to a tiny ray, almost faded from sight. The hole of a nearby tree showed a spot of light, then burst into flame. They left them there, Pedro and the Chosen One, together in death, and went on. The trail plunged down into a ravine, down which a small stream went. The terrain was rocky, tortuous, hard go- ing. Burstone fought his way through. There was a world of endurance in that wiry old. body. One by one the drums stopped, faded, disappeared. There was silence in the jungle, broken by the whimper of the night wind in the trees, by the rare call of a bird or animal. There was too much silence in the jungle, especially behind them. Intruding in that silence came the whistles. Zantha’s keen ears heard them first, and she stopped abruptly, Markle stum- bled against her, saw that she was lis- tening. He called to Burstone. Beginning with a faint piping far be- hind them, they came creeping closer, like elfin voices from the fairy world. Distant, shrill, keen, malevolent, the whistled notes came. “It is the madness,” Zantha whis- pered. She caught the question in the minds of the two men. “All that hear the whistles go mad,” she explained. “They skip, they jump, their bodies twitch, their mind goes away from them, they become like chil- dren. ... It hurts . . .” “Nonsense!” Markle ejaculated. “How can whistles do that?” “Certain sounds properly pitched can destroy matter,” Burstone answered. “I am not familiar with the process, but I know it is a problem of frequency. The right frequency, impinging on a human, could destroy his mind, tem- porarily or permanently. I suspect that Zantha knows what she is talking about. Compared to the heat ray you have, the whistles would be child’s play.” “What can we do?” “Nothing,” Zantha answered, and he caught the hopelessness in her mind. “They will come upon us in the dark- ness, and we will dance . . .” “They will dance,” he snarled, “if I can find them with this rifle.” “Come on,” Burstone ordered. “We QUEST OF ZIPANTORIC 97 may be able to outdistance them.” He plunged forward at a steady trot that was almost a run. The booming of the drums had been the vainglorious chest-pounding of a braggart; the whistles incisively voiced a far more deadly menace. High, thin, trilling notes, they were, that started far up in the scale and went beyond hearing. Markle wondered how the Wardens protected themselves from the sound, and questioned Zantha, but she did not know. NyTEARER they came, like a pack of ^ ' whistling dogs hot on the trail of running game. At a spot where gigan- tic boulders formed a natural fort Markle stopped. “Take Zantha and go on,” he said to Burstone. “I’ll give them something to think about for a while, and when they’re thinking, I’ll catch up with you.” He had forgotten that Zantha could read his thoughts. “No, Deeck,” she said, slipped her hand through his arm. “If you stay, I stay too . . .” “Beat it while you’ve got a chance. I	can hold them back for a time.” “You mean to die here, that we may have a chance to live,” she answered. Markle groaned. “Burstone, take her with you if you have to drag her. Hurry up. Those infernal screeches are just around the corner and I can al- ready feel them working on me.” The old scientist leaned against a boulder. His breath was coming in great gasping pants. “No, Dick,” he answered. “I ... I stay here. I can’t go on anyhow. This old body . . . has carried me too far now. . . . I’ll play Horatius. . . . You take Zantha . . . and go . . . with my blessing. . . The ravine which they had traversed was hideous with a shrill cacophony of sound. From ahead of them, in the di- rection which they must go, came a shrill blast. “I guess none of us will go,” said Markle, lifting his rifle and peering vainly into the night for a target. He moved away a few paces, laid his flashlight on a rock so that it would illuminate the trail they had just trav- ersed, flipped the button, and skipped quickly away. Its broad white beam caught three bronzed figures. Markle’s rifle roared once, twice. One man slumped, the sec- ond fell and then crawled to the pro- tection of a rock, the third skipped quickly away. The screeching whistles stopped. A tiny beam of light came fingering over the rock where the flashlight lay, touched it, and the light burst into mol- ten metal. Darkness came down and in the darkness the raucous whistles screamed angrily. Closer they came, and closer. And shriller. There was a trace of wild, un- earthly music in them, the piping that our forebears heard in the notes of the Goat-God. Something of Orpheus was there, whose magic lyre charmed wild beasts and moved trees to dance. They blended into sonorous cadence, moved up the scale, went out of hearing. Zantha crouched against Markle. He could feel her body tremble. In his brain a wild echo of those shrill sounds beat, and beat, and beat. His fingers were moving, jerking. He lifted his rifle, threw aimless slug after aimless slug into the night. Back into hearing came the notes, back down the scale. And a soft gold- en light came, illumining the rocky shelter wherein they crouched. Markle could see Burstone still lean- ing against the boulder where he had taken up his position. Lines were etched deep in the face of the ethnolo- gist. As Markle watched he saw him 98 DYNAMIC Science Stories drop his rifle, saw his fingers flex, his arms jerk. Burstone started shuffling his feet. In Markle’s brain a trip-hammer beat. It found an echo in his muscles. Each time the hammer fell his muscles jerked. His arms, his legs would not obey his will. He found himself shuf- fling an aimless two-step. He saw the bronze figures close in, felt his arms tied behind him, saw Zan- tha and Burstone taken. The whistles stopped, the trip-hammer subsided in his brain, strength flowed back to his body. “That way,” said a bronze figure pointing. With guards ahead and guards behind, they started back over the weary trail down which they had fled. pvAWN was in the sky when they reached the City of Zipantoric. It nestled in a depression well below the level of the hills surrounding it. In the mists of the morning they could glimpse a huge ball surrounded by smaller structures. In reply to Mar- kle’s question Zantha indicated that this was the Tomb of Zipantoric. They were taken to a small room, cut in solid stone, their bonds were re- moved, and food was given them. “Breakfast is served,” said Burstone grimly. “Let it be said of us that the condemned men ate a hearty break- fast.” “We will have no other,” said Zan- tha quietly. “Tonight is the night of sacrifice. We shall see Zipantoric.” They finished breakfast. Markle found a crumpled package of cigarettes in his clothing. “How do they manage this execu- tion?” he asked, blowing blue smoke to- ward the ceiling. The hand that held the cigarette trembled. Zantha was seated on a stone ledge that ran around the building. “They will take us . . . inside the temple,” she answered. Her voice was a gray echo in the dawn. “We shall see Zipantoric. Then they will bring us out of the temple and tie us to the posts of sacrifice on the ledge around the tem- ple. Fire will leap from the temple peak and we will be destroyed.” “It sounds simple,” Burstone com- mented. “What is the nature of this fire that will destroy us?” “It is like lightning,” she replied. “The high priest, from inside the tem- ple, sets it free.” A further explanation she could not give. She did not know. Sometime in the past there had been a mighty sci- ence among the Mayans, but ages had shrouded it, and this lost remnant of a people could not reproduce it. In an- swer to Burstone’s question she told them how tradition handed down from the long past time said that Zipantoric came out of the sky, accompanied by other fire gods, who left him there and returned to the sky in their balls of fire, with instructions to this people that they were to ward him forever. The fire gods from the sky had given this colony of Mayans much knowledge and wonderful weapons, had taught them how to operate the golden bubble, the rod that burned, the whistles. They were the Chosen Ones, the Wardens, and their duty was to destroy all stran- gers who came near. They had been faithful to their trust for many cen- turies, how many she could not esti- mate. That was the legend. From what murky source it sprang Burstone could not understand. “Why do they want to destroy you?” Markle interrupted. “You are one of them, you are their priestess.” “Because I have been touched, have been profaned. They will name a new priestess now.” Markle looked at her. “I’m sorry I touched you. I didn’t know . . .” QUEST OF ZIPANTORIC 99 She came to him. “Do not be sorry, Deeck. . . . Somehow, inside of me, I am a little glad . . He squeezed her hand. IV DEATH comes on swift relentless feet to those who know the hour when he will strike. Night soon tossed its dark shroud over the last col- ony of the Mayans. Markle, looking at Burstone, knew that this day had aged the old scientist. The lines on his face were deeply etched. In their cell the three waited. And three guards came. Haughty and poised was their bearing, calm, aloof, immobile their faces. Soft golden light blazed from the rods they carried in their hands. Their fingers were ready on the buttons that would turn that soft glow into a searing beam. Markle closed his mind. He forced himself to be terrified—he did not need much forcing—to cringe. Over his thoughts he put a rigid embargo. Bur- stone and Zantha did likewise. Out from their cell the Wardens led them, one guard in front and two be- hind. Burstone followed the first guard, then Zantha, then Markle. They reached the open and saw a vast circle of people surrounding the temple. Every head in that throng was turned toward that huge ball, which was beginning to glow with a faintly lumi- nous light. A lane was clear through the crowd. Down that lane the first guard marched. A muffled drum started throbbing. Its slow measured beat wailed a dirge for the dying. Zantha walked erect, her head held high. Courage that girl had. Her steps never faltered, her glance never strayed aside. She would see Zipantoric. She would go to her god, but she would not go as a slave goes, cringing and fearful. Over the crowd that hemmed in the huge luminous ball a heavy tenseness hung. They were waiting . . . wait- ing ^ The guards led on, up the steps of stone that led to the temple. Markle saw the metal posts set around the ledge well above the crowd. A semicircle be- low each of them was here. Elsewhere the Mayans crowded, but upon these semicircles they did not crowd. At the top of the steps a somber fig- ure met them. Wearing a mask, garbed in metal bright with ornament, holding the scepter of the Feathered Serpent aloft in his right hand, thin, emaciated, age-weary, the high priest of Zipantoric stood. Up the stone steps the high priest led them, the guard following, and into the door of the temple. Markle took one look at that door and suppressed an exclamation. It was built of mas- sive metal swung on a strange hinge and it opened and locked from the inside. It opened into a small ante-chamber, which was as Zantha had said. He got ready. The two guards had just stepped in- side the opening when he whirled, his left fist driving out with all the strength in his hardened tendons. It caught one guard squarely in the stomach, and sank in through soft flesh. Breath whistled out of the lungs of the guard and a pained surprise leaped into his eyes. Never before had one revolted when he was to see Zipantoric. That the condemned walk to their doom erect was so firmly rooted in tradition that their hands had not even been bound. Zantha had foretold this. Without pausing in his stride, Markle crossed with his right. It thudded home on the jaw of the second guard, who dropped his weapon, slipped, and 100 DYNAMIC Science Stories fell headlong down the steps outside. The first guard had doubled up like a jack-knife, the bronze of his face tinged with green. It had taken only a second. Markle needed only one glance to know that he had nothing to fear from the guards behind him for a few min- utes. He whirled to help Burstone but he saw that elderly ethnologist was do- ing a very neat job of throttling the first guard. Zantha had appropriated his heat ray and was holding it trained on the high priest. It took them less than a minute to kick the two guards and the high priest down the steps and swing shut that mas- sive door. CURPRISE had gained them a tem- k-* porary advantage. As the figure of the high priest came rolling down the steps an angry roar burst from the crowd, and as Markle swung shut the door, men were dashing up the steps. A glance at the door told him that it would withstand the charge of an army, and the heavy walls of the temple prom- ised protection from the whistles. A second door almost as heavy as the first closed the small anteroom. They closed and locked it, and found themselves in a large chamber. Hang- ing on pegs around the wall were what looked like clumsy diving equipment, and a circular stairway led up to what- ever was above. ‘‘Zipantoric rests above,” said Zan- tha. “I have never been in that room. Only the high priest may enter, and those who are to die . . .” “We’ll go up,” said Burstone grimly. He went up. Markle saw him stick his head through the opening, saw him pause, heard an exclamation, and he disappeared into the room above. Markle and Zantha followed. They found Burstone standing in the center of a large room, a puzzled, dazed ex- pression on his lined face. In front of him was what looked like a large switchboard, with meters, rheo- stats, switches, and all the parapher- nalia necessary to control a heavy elec- tric current. “It looks like the switchboard of a power house!” Markle gasped. “Men, this isn’t possible,” Burstone muttered, half to himself. “Do you see what I see or am I crazy?” “Something is wrong somewhere. Here in this room is electrical equip- ment that unquestionably has been de- vised by a very advanced science. The Mayan peoples never reached this stage of development.” “The people as a whole did not, but this colony evidently did,” Burstone answered. “Man, what a find! The equipment in this room will advance electrical knowledge a hundred years.” Burstone had forgotten that he was a man; he only remembered that he was a scientist. “Yes,” Markle replied drily. “If the news ever gets back home. There are a thousand maniacs surrounding this temple who would like nothing better than to cut our throats . . .” To Zantha their words meant noth- ing. When they spoke of electricity she got a mental image of lightning flashing down from heaven. She had no idea that this mighty force could be con- trolled, bent to the will of man. But she held this room in superstitious awe. Tradition told her what reposed in that oblong container off to one side, and it was this coffin-like receptacle rising on two columns a few feet above the floor, that riveted her attention. When Mar- kle approached it she would have called him back, and when he insisted, she moved to his side. He slipped an arm around her, found she was trembling. “Do not go near that box, Deeck,” she begged. “Why not?” QUEST OF ZIPANTORIC 101 “Zipantoric is there. He will destroy you . . “He can be no worse than what we have already seen,” he answered, mov- ing forward. She went with him. Markle glanced at the contents and recoiled. His exclamation called Bur- stone. He steeled himself to look again. T TTTERLY nude, bathed in a soft ^ liquid light of the deepest imagin- able shade of blue, was Zipantoric. A small body, like that of a child, covered with sparse silver hair and a very wrin- kled skin. Weak, spindly legs, rising to a small torso, and out of that, a huge chest, so large that it made the head seem less out of proportion. For that cranium was massive. It looked as if it could contain all the knowledge in all the libraries of the earth and still have room left over for more. Two wrinkled lids marked the closed eyes. The nose was large and straight, the mouth a mere slit. The features were composed in the even calm of death. “It looks like a dwarf,” Markle breathed. “So it does,” Burstone answered. “Like a member of the dwarf races that folk tales say long ago inhabited the earth. But that is not possible, either, for those legends can be traced back to their source. . . . And besides, that chest is out of proportion. It looks as if it had been evolved through centuries spent in high altitudes, in a thin atmos- phere, where oxygen is not plentiful.” “It is Zipantoric,” Zantha said. “Now we shall die . . .” Long centuries of tradition told her that those who saw the face of the fire god would die. Markle tried to reas- sure her, but the fear had been born in her, and reason would not eradicate it. “We shall die, Deeck,” she said calmly. “But I am not afraid.” “Good girl! We aren’t dead yet, and before we check out, some of those lads outside are going to be mighty unhap- py. They’ll have to starve us out. If we could only control that discharge to the posts set around the ledge outside, they would be plenty uncomfortable. Say!—That’s an idea. How do they work that?” “The high priest, he who wears the jewel of the Great One, remains in here, and causes the lightning to strike. I do not know how it is done, but the lightnings obey none other than he. Once another priest tried to usurp the power and attempted to set off the light- ning, but the fire consumed him, instead of striking outside the temple . . “An electrical trap,” Burstone mused. “If you know the combination, it works; if you don’t know the com- bination, it works anyhow. Dick, take a look out of those openings around the wall and see what our friends outside are doing.” Markle did not puzzle over the fact that the openings were closed by several inches of transparent material that re- sembled glass. They did not remind him of portholes; he had too many other things to think about. Torches were moving through the vast crowd outside. The people were shifting to and fro; men were running around the ledge of the temple. He recognized the high priest issuing or- ders. It looked like a disorganized mass of ants, but these were fighting ants, with stings. It was only a ques- tion of time, he knew. Perhaps the wise thing to do was to go down and face the crowd. Death would come quicker that way. A HUM came from inside the room ^ and he whirled. Burstone was standing in front of the mighty switch- board, moving levers and punching but- tons. “You’re risking your life!” Markle 102 DYNAMIC Science Stories shouted, leaping to the side of the scien- tist. “Probably there is no danger,” Bur- stone answered. “We know it for a fact that this controls the discharge. I have tried several switches and nothing has happened, except lights have flashed. There are two more switches . . Burstone turned, held out his hand. “Dick ... I wish you a lot of luck. ... I have seen much of living. It does not matter if I see no more . . .” Markle, not understanding, took the outstretched hand. Burstone wrung it, gave him a violent shove. As he stumbled backward Markle saw the old ethnologist reach up and grasp the switches. His muscles tensed, the poles came down . . . A jagged streak of yellow flame rent the air, a living spear that clove Bur- stone’s body from head to toe. There came the gruesome odor of burning flesh. His body jerked, sagged down- ward, his hands forever clenched around the handles of the switches. . . In the silence that followed when the discharge died out there intruded the soft hushed tinkling of a silver bell . . . V MARKLE disengaged the hands, gently laid the old body on the floor. A man had died . . . in the thin hope that others might live . . . There was an ache in Markle’s throat, a gulping ache. A choking cord was tied around his heart, and a mist was before his eyes. . . . During the five years that had elapsed since he had left college Burstone had been a father to him. . . . Now he was dead. Zantha stood beside him, sorrow showing on her face. That kindly old man, who had never shown fear and never complained, was gone. She had known it would happen, but she had thought it would include her. She could not understand. Markle was stunned. He did not see the Warden come up the winding stair- way, did not know that the heat ray was aimed at him until the brutal command came to turn around and lift his hands. There wasn’t a chance. The ray would sear before he could move. And others were coming up the steps. It did not matter. The end was writ- ten, but it did not seem to matter. They had seen Zipantoric. Now the lightning would rend them. Dust would blow from the ledge of the temple, and it would be the dust of their bodies, but it did not matter . . . Zantha stood beside him, straight as an arrow, poised, her head erect . . . Her beautiful body would be seared by a flash of screaming pain. Die here, under the heat rays. Die fighting. Death was inevitable. Their only choice was in the manner of dying. He tensed his muscles, prepared to leap at the throat of the Warden. His muscles wouldn’t work, they wouldn’t obey his orders. Something was happening to the faces of the War- dens. They weren’t looking at him; they were looking over and beyond him ... In their faces was so vast a fear that it was incomprehensible. . . . Centers above the higher centers of Markle’s mind sent alarmed sensations through his brain cells. He could feel it, something, something, he knew not what . . . was here, was behind him. His whirling movement was instinctive; it did not rise to the level of his con- scious mind. A gasping cry choked in his throat. Blinking the sleep of ages out of his deep-set eyes, sitting up in the casket where he had reposed so long, was he whom the Mayans called Zipantoric. With each passing second life was QUEST OF ZIPANTORIC 103 flooding through him more vigorously. He shook his head as a deeper does when he awakens. Out of the corner of his eyes Markle saw the Wardens drop to the floor. To them a god had risen. Zantha went to her knees, her eyes wide with awed dread. She pleaded with Markle to kneel, but he shook his head. In the back of his mind he had the answer to Zipantoric, yet it was an answer he could scarcely believe . . . Zipantoris lifted himself out of the casket, moved mincingly over to the massive switchboard, stared at the body of Burstone, carefully studied the meters. The back of the creature was turned. With one leap Markle could land astride that body, could throttle the being. It was an avenue of escape, yet it was one that he did not choose to take. There was a tiny sound from the stairway. Markle turned his head and saw a Warden there, in the act of aim- ing the heat gun. The Mayan had seen the prostrate bodies of his comrades on the floor and he had not recognized the spindly-legged creature standing in front of the switchboard. “Watch it!” Markle screamed. Zipantoric whirled like a cat and a black spot leaped into existence on the panel where the ray struck. JV/TARKLE got the impression of a *	** tremendous wave of mental force. A look of stunned surprise came over the face of the Mayan. His grip on the gun relaxed, he slid awkwardly out of sight. Zipantoric minced over and peered down the opening. Then he stepped to a port and for a long time his gaze roved over the howling multi- tude outside. He turned back to the room, and Markle felt those gleaming, hypnotic eyes fasten on him. He was being com- manded, ordered, to think back over the recent past. He found his mind run- ning over all that had happened since the golden bubble had appeared on the Pyramid of the Sun. He could feel his past experiences draining out, draining into the mind of the creature facing him. There was a grim ghost of a smile on the leathery face of Zipantoric. He turned to Zantha, and Markle knew that he was probing her mind. When he finished with her, she stood up, moved to Markle, stood trembling be- side him. For a long time he questioned the Mayans. Not a word was spoken, not a sound uttered. Markle knew that the fate of all of them was hanging in the balance. He did not know whether or not he was afraid. His mind was still numb from the shock of Burstone’s death and the ordinary emotions were not registering. Zipantoric came back, looked from Zantha to him. Something heavy pressed on Markle’s mind. He was be- ing weighed, all of them were being weighed. The weight lifted from his mind. Zipantoric had reached a decision. The Mayans rose from the floor when Zipantoric turned to them. Like zom- bies, like the living dead, they rose and filed down the steps and out of the room forever. Zipantoric pulled switches, depressed buttons, on the switchboard. A relay clicked, there was a scream and a throb of current. Markle felt like he weighed a ton and his knees started to buckle. Zantha was clinging to him. Even Zip- antoric was holding to a projection on the control panel. Intuitively Markle knew what he would see when he staggered to the port and looked out, yet he could scarcely believe his eyes. The city was gone, had vanished. Far below them, bathed in thin moon- 104 DYNAMIC Science Stories glow, was the immense globe of the earth. Points of light showed here and there. Thin white clouds passed be- tween them and the dark expanse be- low. Markle faced Zipantoric. “What—” he began. Zipantoric smiled. “No, my son,” came the answer into his mind. “You are not ready to know all about me. My home is out there in space and I am going home. Long cen- turies ago I was left here by enemies and a race of earth-people set as guards over me. I slept away the long years until your comrade pulled the switches that set me free . . . Now I am going . . . home . . . Your race is not ready for the knowledge that I have. It must come slowly, through centuries of evolu- tion . . “But what . . . about us?” Zipantoric continued smiling. ' I 'HUS the story almost ends. It needs only two newspaper clippings to supply any necessary further infor- mation. New York City, Aug. 21.—U^-A. The earth narrowly missed a collision with a tremendous meteor last night, if the radio reports from three ships in the south- ern Caribbean are to be credited. Each states that about 10 o’clock last night a tremendously large ball of fire came flam- ing up from the south. It dropped from sight a few miles inland and it was first thought to have struck the earth there, but a few minutes later it was again seen in the air rapidly gaming speed and rising. Within a short time it was nothing but a tiny point of light in the sky and it soon vanished entirely. Astronomers are at a loss to explain the strange behavior of this meteor and are inclined to doubt the veracity of the re- ports. News from the mainland, however, indicates that the phenomenon was ob- served there. Searching parties are setting out to investigate the spot where it was reported to have touched the earth. New York City, Aug. 26.—Via cable from South America. D. F. Markle, assistant to Dr. E. F. Bur- stone, ethnologist, who was engaged in ex- cavating Mayan ruins in the vicinity of Cortec, was found near here today by an expedition searching for traces of the giant meteor reported to have fallen in this vicinity on Aug. 21. He reports that Dr. Burstone was killed by an attack of hostile Indians from which he and his companion, a young Indian maiden, barely managed to escape with their lives. They were on the verge of exhaustion. Without weapons they had fought their way through two hundred miles of jungle separating the place where they were found from the ruins they had been excavating. They were rushed on board ship and are now on their way to this country. THE END ^ • • • cotctCt FOR tO* Certified Cremo now coin you less—give* you 50% more for your money.

Don’t you think it has overlooked an opportunity for profit- able research?—V. S., St. Clair, Mo. The loss is probably to the athletes rather than the scientists, who will be some time applying the results of the other investigations with which they seek to aid mankind as a whole; but as an example of science’s insatiable curi- osity, General Electric engineers have recently measured the speed of a box- er’s punch. Two photo-electric cells were placed a foot apart so that the subject’s flying fist intercepted their light beams and successively started and stopped a split-second timer. Re- sults showed that the boxer hit at the rate of 40.2 miles per hour! Another investigator — a woman, strange to relate—has taken x-ray pic- tures of a baseball pitcher’s grip in hurling the rawhide. Fast balls, slow balls, knuckle and curved balls were the objects of her study, but wags have cast doubt on its seriousness by point- ing out that her subject was a south- paw. Just the same, we believe we’re not alone in wishing for a peep at a shadow picture of Feller’s or Dean’s fingers as they let go at a baffled batter. A more significant study by medical men has been made of the physiological process of a quintet of the world’s greatest middle distance runners, in- cluding Lash, Cunningham, Venzke, Romani, and Fenske. Their speed was found to depend largely upon the abil- ity to attain a relatively high oxygen intake. Other trained runners, how- ever, though not as fast as this record- breaking group of Olympic heroes, nearly equaled them in this respect. Only one factor could be found which might be considered an inherent phy- siological superiority of a superlative runner rather than the result of his better or harder training. That was Lash’s peculiar ability to raise his metabolic rate, when racing, to 21.4 times its basal level, an increase above that of runners of equal experience. As a result of this discovery, the in- teresting possibility occurs that in the future runners may be handicapped on the basis of their metabolisms. ITiis be- comes possible since Ohio State Univer- sity physiologists have discovered that cortin, an extract of the cortex of the adrenal glands, increases muscular effi- ciency by lowering oxygen needs. Large doses of the extract are required, and it may be that the handicappers will instead turn to the product of the physicist, deuterium or heavy water. Containing double weight atoms of hydrogen known as deuterons, heavy water has strange effects on animals. Experiments with mice have shown that it is a strong stimulant to the sym- pathetic nervous system, causing the hair to stand on end and the eyes to bulge, and that it speeds up the phy- siological processes twenty per cent or more. This latter quality makes it a perfect compensation for the runner with a low basal metabolism. But it is a strange picture we are brought of the track meet of the future, with wild- eyed dashmen hurling their deuteron- charged bodies at the finish tape. Yet scientists have found much to criticize in the handling of present day meets. Disregarding the fact that sound waves travel slowly, starters in some meets fire the gun from such a 106 DYNAMIC Science Stories position that the runners do not hear the report for from one to four-tenths of a second after the race has officially begun. Times made in different meets are not properly comparable under such circumstances. Similarly, in weight throwing events, officials often fail to realize the importance of the relative elevations of throwing circle and land- ing point. Results are measured to the fraction of an inch, but in the shot put, when the flight of the weight at its ter- minus is about 45° to the horizontal, the measured length of the put will be in error by the same amount as the dis- crepancy in elevation, which may easily be two full inches. In the discus throw, because of the flatter trajectory of the discus, the effect is three times as ser- ious. But the greatest single mistake made is failing to take gravity into account in comparing records made in different parts of the world. Weights are actu- ally heavier at some places than others. Jack Torrence’s 57' 1" shot put at Oslo, Norway, would have been worth an extra inch at Rome! At the equator, where the gravitational influence de- creases still further in conformity with the formula of the inverse ratio of the square of the distance of the attracting bodies, the shot would have sailed an- other two inches on the same heave. For the discus and hammer throws the addi- tional distance would be still greater and a good toss of the javelin would be extended more than a foot! And if it still seems that the scientists are splitting hairs, remember that world records are often built on fractions, the tiny bit extra at the end. In fact, take a table of the values of the acceleration of gravity, available for nearly any place on earth, and after rectifying marks for this factor, see how many world records change! If you’d rather leave that to us, we’ll do it in a subsequent issue and instead let you work this problem with this nec- essary data given: How high could Walker Johnson jump, assuming he could duplicate his world record effort of 6' 10", on an asteroid with one hun- dredth of the earth’s diameter and the same density? Simple, yet it will give you a chance to apply your knowledge of science to athletics. CHIPS OF CREATION Dear Sir: How much is actually known con- cerning the origin of meteors f I read so many conflicting statements.—A. K., Minneapolis, Minn. It is little more than a hundred years since the discovery that meteors were actually celestial bodies and not terres- trial or atmospheric. At that time the meteor paths in a great fall or “shower” were traced back to a com- mon center in the constellation Leo. Soon it was advanced that there was a connection between the orbits of me- teors and comets. Subsequent study has confirmed the conclusion and today at least six of the great meteor streams through which the earth passes an- nually have been identified with the paths of comets. Hence the theory that they are the debris of disintegrated comets whose matter has been distrib- uted around their orbits. So much for the meteor swarms, but what of the individual meteors that fall each day in countless numbers? One theory holds them to be fragments of two lost planets, brothers of the earth which met destruction in some cosmic cataclysm about 100,000,000 years ago. Another considers them tiny chips left over when the planets were thrown off by the sun two billion years ago or more. The recent discovery of radio- active material in meteors has enabled physicists to date them by the same method used in determining the age of terrestrial minerals— and now neither theory can be completely confirmed! By this method, different meteors have been found to be as young as 100,- 000,000 years, as old as two billion. The former could not have had their origin in the sun, for they would have had to stay molten in space for ninteen times as long as they have been solid. And a planet could not be the source of meteors of both ages, with such a wide disparity between them. Other data is obviously needed.	f That is being supplied by the Har- vard Observatory’s new meteor speed- ometer. On the basis of its findings orbital computations have been made that indicate meteors are really minute planets travelling, like the earth, THROUGH THE TELESCOPE 107 around the sun. But this proves only that they are now members of the solar system. And it gives no clue to the process by which they became indepen- dent bodies. Moreover, not all the meteors observed had planetary paths. Some had hyperbolic orbits that indi- cate an origin in interstellar space! Chips of an older, a distant, strange creation! Whatever their origin, meteors con- tain no elements not found on the earth. About thirty in all have been found in them, mostly the more common ones. Gold and platinum, however, have oc- casionally been discovered in small quantities, as have small diamonds. While at least twenty million meteors— some estimates run to a billion!—enter the earth’s atmosphere daily, few can reach the ground before exploding from the pressure or burning up from the friction of their great speeds, ranging from nine to fifty miles a second. Only about a thousand have been recovered. But not even that many bodies of hu- man beings could be recovered from as vast a city as New York if it were vis- ited with a meteoric fall like that which in 1908 felled all the trees and killed all the animal life in a 5000 square mile area in Siberia! Such a catastrophe has been suggested as the basis of the Bibli- cal story of the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah. CLOSER STARS Dear Sir: In the answers to the quiz in the November issue of MARVEL, your companion s-f magazine, Alpha proxima was given as the closest star. Hasn’t a new one been discovered that is closer? —L. A. R., New York City. •	The star listed as Wolf 424 may be closer. It is not newly discovered, how- ever; its failure to be credited as tops in proximity to the earth is due to the fact that astronomers have been unable after considerable study, to determine exactly how far distant it is. The star, with a visual magnitude of 12, can be viewed through only the most powerful telescopes. Its faintness is an obstacle to precise observation, but its parallax has been tentatively figured as eight to nine tenths of a second. If this is con- firmed, Wolf 424 is less than four light years distant and is the closest star— little more than twenty million miles away! TEE UP THE EARTH A number of readers have expressed further interest in methods of determin- ing the age of the earth (see MARVEL for November). At the same time we take this opportunity of answering cer- tain other questions sent in individually but forming a related group.—Ed. Highly ingenious is the method of calculating earth’s age that esti- mates the time required for the interior to oool sufficiently to produce certain observable effects on the surface. Mountain chains are wrinkles produced on the already cool crust by internal shrinking. Together they represent 1.6% of the earth’s surface and to raise up their masses the radius of the globe would have had to contract by .8%. The length of time required, computed on the basis of known thermal data, would be about two billion years. More precise a figure is obtained by measuring the breakdown of radioact- tive potassium. This is an isotrope with an atomic weight of 40 as com- pared with natural potassium at 39.1. K40, as it is known, by liberating an electron becomes a particular type of calcium which can be identified. While K40 disintegrates so slowly that only one atom in a billion breaks down in a year, the rate of change into calcium is known and from the amount of the lat- ter discovered in association with it, the age of the earth is fixed at 1,430,000,000 years. It is interesting to note that the potassium clock points so closely to the 1,500,000,000 years indicated by the uranium chronometer. The discovery of radioactive potas- sium, a recent one, has also solved at least one scientific mystery. Formerly there was no explanation for the presence of helium gas in old miner- als rich in potassium. But now it is known that the formerly unsuspected radioactive isotrope of potassium, when it liberates an electron, is left with an excessive positive charge which it tends to lose by disgorging a helium nucleus. The latter, picking up electrons from 108 DYNAMIC Science Stories forms, directions, UNITED STATES DENTAL COMPANT * * * SALES MEAN JOBS—BUY NOW: * * * or oil nges 18-50 make SlO.a scioDtmc Swodlab Misuse lliere Is a bifi demand I Fnlr'n/ BEAUTIFUL (f t Natural-Looking FALSE TEETH LOWESmiCES SEND NO MONEY the surrounding matter, becomes gas- eous helium. Another mystery, the tremendous changes in plant and animal life during the carboniferous age a quarter billion years ago, is also laid at the door of K40. Potassium plays a vital part in life processes and its radioactive var- iety, formerly four to fifteen times as prevalent, may have been the case of the earlier era’s remarkable mutations and rampant growths. Even less certainty exists concerning the nature of the earth’s interior. That there is a definite core some half the diameter of the earth is well established. Thereafter we enter the realm of con- jecture. Does the temperature rise ob- served in bore holes, 30°C for every kil- ometer, continue to increase indefinitely with the depth? What is the effect of the tremendous mounting pressure? Is the core solid, liquid, or gas—or any one of these in an unfamiliar form? The latest theory to be propounded approaches the problem with a view to the conditions that must be met. The density of the core must be such as to average with the crustal density of 4.2 to bring the mean density to 5.5. The core must furthermore be less rigid than the shell to meet the requirements of tidal phenomena, and it must have the faculty of obsorbing sheer waves A metallic core heavily occluded, or packed, with some gas such as hydrogen seems best to meet these specifications. Experiments with the rare metal palladium, occluded with several hun- dred times its own volume of hydrogen, have revealed it to possess the proper qualities. If this is the case, the earth may be said to resemble a golf ball, with rough skin and spongy, elastic core! And the cry of the modem Archimedes should be not for a fulcrum but a tee. The question, however, can not be con- sidered closed. There still remains such puzzles as why it is sixty-three feet far- ther from New York to London on New Year’s Eve than on the Fourth of July, in 90 Days at Home Home. IS EPILEPSY INHERITED?

RACE SUICIDE * ★ * SALES MEAN J0B6—BUY NOW! * * * Dear Sir: What explanation is there for the mass suicides of lemmings? — I.G., Detroit, Mich. The lemming, a small Arctic rodent, has great spurts of reproductivity. After population density reaches a cer- tain limit, mass migratory movements are started to relieve pressure. These great marches sweep on with almost hypnotic obliviousness until some ob- stacle like a river is reached. And there the vast hordes still sweep on—to their death! Blind biological forces cause these creatures to multiply in disastrous num- bers. Blind instinct—or the lack of reason—causes them to follow a course that relieves pressure on the race at the expense of its component parts, the in- dividuals! A deadly parallel has been pointed out between the lemming and man. In a minimum of 100,000 years up to 1638, mankind’s number grew to less than 500,000,000. Yet in the scant three hundred years since then, the popula- tion has crested the two billion mark— more than quadrupled! Of little avail to point to temporarily favorable economic conditions, to med- icine’s slow conquest of disease and age. When plotted on the proper time scale, such a spurt of population growth ap- pears in its true nature of an explosion —or an epidemic! The result of blind biological forces. And what of the other instinct, the still more blind instinct to adjust pop- ulations by mass suicide? Man’s march is to war! And the next war, after science has labored so well this score of years to aid mankind, may be race suicide!
