But these were different. Al had a copra plantation, with a side-line of pearl shells, on the tiny south sea inland of Tongalusa and the light- liued native girls who wore a string of pearls and an amiable expression Loa-loa could wiggle in a G-string like nobody*s business. had become an old story. “Maybe I’m dead!” Al said, tear- ing his eyes away from the smooth white breasts and permitting hi* gaz* to travel upward. The girl who was leaning over him smiled. She didn’t seem to realize how low her dress was cuc in tin neck. She was dressed in crisp white. She had reddish-gold hair; her eyes had an amber tint; her nose was just the tiniest bit tip-tilted, and her mouth was red and smiling. Here and there a stray freckle intruded it- self. "No, you’re not in heaven. You’re in the hospital at Port Wytka. And you're not to talk!” the red- haired divinity said. ‘’Port Wytka?” Al said wonder- ingly. Why, Port Wytka was seventy sea-miles from Tongalusa, the better part of a day’s journey in a launch! "What about my planta- tion?” he protested. "Sh-h! Concussion cases are sup- posed to be kept quiet.” AI pondered. Then he grinned a little. "When did iiarl Carroll bring his chorus down here to act as nurses?” The girl in white blushed. "'No matter how ill, you must live up to your reputation, mustn't you?-’ "Have I a reputation?” Al said in surprise. "All over the islands. You’re a lady-killer. But you can’t work your charm on me. I’m strictly business, and you’re just another case." "How long have I been here and how did I get here?” he persisted. "You’ve been here a week, dead to the world, and a fat native chief brought vou.” "Old Illybo?” She nodded. "I think that’s who it was.” Al smiled. "I thought the old blighter had run off. I misjudged him! W ow, what a scrap that was! The last thing I remember was being bashed on the head, and jumping into the lagoon.” "It’s a wonder you weren’t killed. You have a hard head." “And a soft heart. In fact, every time I look at you my heart gets softer.'’ "You’re still delirious! Now go to sleep.” TIJ only dream about you if I do.” "Well, see that your dreams are moral.” And she left him. In the week of Al Devlin’s con- valescence that followed, he came to the conclusion that the hundred or more previous times he had been in love were but passing phases of de- mentia. There was no one like Aik* Denny, the red-haired nurse. “That’s great,” he had said when he learned her name. “What's great?” “Your being Alice Denny.” "Why?” “Because you won't have to change your initials when you marry me. Alice Denny, A. D., and I’m Al Devlin, also A. D.” “Who said anything about marry- ing you?” "Oh, lots of girls! But 1 turned ’em all down. I was waiting for you to come along.” “You take a lot for granted.” She flung this parting shot and left him. But he was persistent- The next (turn 10 time she came in he said, "Listen. You’ve got to marry me.” "Why?” "Well* you know everything about me there is to be known. You’ve bathed me and 'changed my clothes and all that sort of thing. You’ve got to marry me to save my self-respect. You’ve compromised me!” She laughed. "If I married every man I’ve takon care of, I’d be a poly- andrist a hundred times over.” "That’s a good word. What docs it mean?” he teased. She smiled gaily. "Listen, do you think I’d marry a man with your reputation? Why, you’d two-time me the first chance you got. No, I’m a one-man woman for a one- woman man.” He blushed. "Oh, I know I’ve got a name for that sort of thing. But I’m a changed man now. Won’t you give me a chance to prove it to you?" Ginger Stories "Well,” she hesitated. *T11 tell you what: if, after you leave to- morrow, you can prove that you'd be faithful for—a couple of months, I might listen to you.** "That’s easy! Just watch me!” " That’s the trouble—1 can’t watch you! But I tell you what I can do. I’ll let you take my house-boy, Chong, back to Tongalusa with you. He can report to me about you. Would you be willing to do that?” Which was how Al Devlin came to go back to Tongalusa with a Chin- ese house-boy and a heart full of resolutions. The first thing Devlin did when he got back to his island was to clean out his household staff, which con- sisted of three native girls. One in particular, little Loa-loa, objected strenuously. "Chinaman can’t take -place of Loa-loa!” she complained. "Oh, yes he can! He*s a good cook and he knows how to do house- work!” "Don't you want your Dawn-Blos- som ?' the girl cried as she leaned over him. Loa-loa w i g- g 1 e d sinuously. In view of the fact that her sole garment was a G-s t r i n g, the wiggle was very effective. She was a rich gold color, and her form would have passed muster in any Z i e g f e 1 d show. "China- man can’t do this!” she said seductively. "He’d better not or I’ll throw him out on his Loa-loa came closer. "Can China- man kiss like Loa-loa?” she whis- pered. "I don’t know. Why don’t you try him and sec?” The girl frowned and backed away. "Loa-loa no kiss Chinaman! Loa-loa only kiss Tuan Dev-lin!” "Not any more you don’t! I’m a good boy from now on! I'm sorry, Loa, but that's all over. Good-bye and good luck, and here's a box of stogies for you as a parting gift.” I hope you noticed that,-' Devlin sa*d to Chong. "Me see. Me roll missie Denny,” Chong answered. That same night old Illybo. the chief, dropped in for a visit. Al was glad to see him. "So you managed to beat Rarapu off after all?” he said as he offered the native a sw'ie of gin. "You save Hlybo*s life. Illybo no forget, lilvbo repay. Wait and see!” "But Illybo has repaid already!” Al protested. “No. lilvbo repay. Wait and see!” the old man repeated myster- iously, as he left. Al Devlin went to bed early. He was tired after the first day back at work. He went to sleep immed - ately, but soon awoke with the feel- ing he was not alone. Al stared. Two native girls, as pretty a pair as he’d ever seen in the islands, young, fresh and absolutely pajamnless, were in his bed. one on each side of him! "Me Tolu!” "Me Toa-lea!” they said softly. "What in the devil are you doing here, both of you?’* ' We present to you from Illybo. You like us some, maybe?” I don’t vant you to belong to me! I have other plans!'* Devlin said angrily. "Maybe you like just one of us tonight, eh? You like me stay and bvr go?’* Tolu’s face was close :o him. She pointed at Toa-lea. "No! Me stay, she go!” Toa-lea said sharply. (.turn to page 62) Unwelcome LYOBE slipped from the bed and wrig- gled her pink and white body. Her nightgown dropped to the iloor. It wjjs one p.m., early morning tor Broadway. The meager handful of clothing she had been wear- ing when she and Eddie en- tered the room the night before was heaped upon a cnair. She began put- ting on step-ins and stockings before going to the bowl to wash. Eddie rolled over on the bed and looked ar her. He was wide awake. "Well, honey,” he said. “At least we had a beautiful b*t night to- gether.” "Right, Eddie. You’ve suil got plenty of the old S. A. Bur it’s like I told you last night. You can't book this double any longer, as you know. Eddie and Lyobe Morris have been over the routes so many times that even changing material don’t help. "\XYre old scuff to everybody who ever saw a vaudevdie show. What we need is a new combination, and we can’t have that and stick, too— right? I’m sick of wearing out my half-soles duckin’ from one booker to another and try in* to fake pros- perity to the bunch of Broadway phonies who are all as bad off .1^ we are.

I’ll get somebody up here, and everything’ll be alJ set. But don’t let the dick break in the door cause they may put it on the bill. Just rap loud. I’ll open the door.” Eddie stalked through the lobby that night until he found precisely what he wanted. She was blonde, by decision, and looked quite as though anything that came out in the papers about her wouldn't do her reputation any harm. She looked, in a word, as though she didn't hava any reputation at all worth bother- ing about. She was seated on a settee in an al- cove, reading a pink-covered tabloid,, and smoking. As Eddie sank down at the other end of the divan she put her cigarette on the rim of the ash tray between them. When she reached for it again it had burned away to little more than a cylindri- cal ash. She withdrew her hand dis- gustedly. “Have one of mine,” Eddie offered courteously, and extended the pack. She smiled and accepted one. Lyobe had given Eddie a lighter for his birthday. It worked for the blonde- by-decision. *	* N o w , what'll we talk about?” Eddie grinned. “You begin,” she suggested. After a while she threw away the tabloid and they got confi- d e n t i a 1. As Lyobe remarked in the morning, Eddie had plenty of the old S. A. and very little S-A-P.

Her name proved to be "Wanna smoke?* he asked the girl. Edith, and she was wearing a dress with a plaited skirt, so it didn’t take her long to get that off. She said she wanted to pre- serve the plaits. Eddie had a bottle of what- all-the shootin’s- fer and gave her a drink. "Where d i d you get this lic- ker?” she wanted to know. “What do you want, baby, a pedi- gree? You ain't buyln* a dog.

Well, no use wasting an hour and a half. They settled down to finish the bottle, and Eddie started to neck the young lady just to keep himself in- terested. Shortly before eleven o’clock there was a rap on the door. "Don’t move!” said Eddie. Edith had sat up at the first sound, and now jumped to her feet. "I'm going,” she said, starting to duck out to the fire-escape without a dress, and with her unhooked brassiere Hap- ping around her Jike water wings. tent and demanding. "Now keep quiet!” Eddie said, and thrust his unwilling guest into a chair. She sat there tense and white-faced a moment, then ab- ruptly relaxed. "Oh, tahell with them,” she said. "Give me a ciga- rette before you open the door.” Eddie tossed her the pack from the table beside the bed, following it with a folder of matches. The door panel seemed ready to split from the pounding it was getting. Eddie turned the knob and yanked the door open, pushing back his hair sheepishly. Into the room blew the runty house dick with his soft hat on the back of his bullet head. Just be- hind him was Lyobe. wearing a man- tle of righteous wrath. They looked about, both showing a shocked expression. Then the de- (turn over) tective gave a yell like a man struck from ambush. With a leap he was on top of Eddie and pounding him about the head. Edith screamed. Lyobe looked at them as though they were all crazy. Then, seeing Eddie getting the worst of it, and taking rights and lefts with just about every part of him but the arms he had raised in defense, she grabbed the telephone and banged it down with all her might on top of the click’s head. He hit the floor like a sack of wet meal. Lyobe reached down, put the telephone back on its stand, and hung up the receiver. "What’s the idea?” she demanded gf the stunned detective. "I told you to come here to Mr. Morris* room with me and see what there was to see. I didn’t tell you to as- sault him!” "But you don’t get the idea,” said the detective, jumping up and stag- gering Eddie with more rights. "That little blonde is my wife! Take chat, Morris, and that, and that!” T? In The Swim Which to put it mildly is suiting the action to the word, according to Grace Chandler’s story YUH can’t see the half of it, dearie!

Where at? Why at a college PROM! Where else at would yuh expect anybody to come home from looking like they had just recovered from the Bubonic Plague, or been run over by a couple of cheer leaders? When Mickey Marshall gives me the come hither to promenade myself up to the beer and pretzel institution where he was in for four years I wasn’t exactly thrilled to a hot to- male over the idear. Ginger Stories Yuli see, dearie, I’d made a New Year’s resolution to lead the pure and *imple for a change, and I’m not one of them low downs what make and break their resolutions the same week. So I thought I’d ward off my des- tiny by running double, for awhile anyway, long enough to grease the skids of life with a little alimony. "What’s that?

"Wine, women, and song arc the same old tools of the devil since Eve invented ferment and torment by the simple act of sinking her upper set in a choice Ben Davis, whether you spell 'em that wray, or call ’em Gin, Broads and Whoopee! That’s why I turned Mickey’s sin- ful invitation down flatter than a nail hammered in by a woman. I knew only too well that PROMS were not conducted along the lines of a Wed- nesday night prayer meeting. But he kept urging me for old times sake, me and Mickey discovered our first red kiss together, so after saying NO absolutely positively five or six times I gave in as us weak sisters always do to cave man tactic*:. And, anyways, I figured it wouldn’t interfere with my leading the pure life since Mick- ey’s reformed just like me and is studying to be a minister. Though I might have knew, dearie, that D.

Though it was conducted under the divine influence of Christianity, so to speak, it was a wow! Their high tide was a Cos- tume Ball, your gentleman friend concocting said costume out of the billboards of his imagination. Yuh’d be surprised at the single- track minds them ministerial students had. They could have been put in jail for infringing on the copyright of Eve’s original little sin. And Gawd knows what Mickey was suf- fering from when he drew up the specifications for me, water on the knee, maybe. Or else he’d been read- ing that doggerel of Bill Shakes- peare’s, for my costume was "nothing much before, and liarf of that be- hind,” if yuh can wrap the shreds of your mentality around that, dearie. Of course I was flattered, any wo- man would be. to have a man think yuh wear a brassiere size number 28 with a couple of tucks, when I really have to wear a forty-fo—. Never mind, that’s nobody’s business, not even yours. When that costume was delivered to my hang-out at the Deaconess’ Home, I gave Mickey a ring to find out where and why the eighth letter of the alphabet they had only sent me a couple of patch pockets of chif- fon. 'Tatch pockets?” yells Mickey* getting temperamental. “That’s your costume! You’re supposed to be a water-nymph!” So I says, sarcastic like, ' thank Gawd for the water!” , But it didn’t penetrate, my re- mark, I mean. Now wouldn’c that have socked yuh more bow-legged than yuh are already? Needless to say it didn’t overwork me to get dressed.

Hampton was grateful. 24 GINGER STORIFS 21 Strolling toward the outskirts of town, he came upon exactly what he wanted, a near, little cottage sitting back from the road a bxr, and look- ing very homelike and hospitable. His rap at the door was answered by a good-looking, middle-aged Madame to whom he explained the circum- stances of his plight, and of whom he begged the favor of shelter for the night. "Certainement, Monsieur,” she re- plied, ushering him into a plain, lit- tle living room. “You have walked a long way, and you are tired. It is only right that you have rest and sleep.” "But where is the Monsieur?” asked Hampton, gazing curiously about the room. The Madame explained that her husband had gone on a journey from which he had yet to return. "But what does it matter?” she asked naively. "Monsieur, the Eng- lishman, is most welcome never- theless.” She c o n- ductcd him to the room he was to occupy, and explained that inasmuch as it led from the room in which she herself slept, it might be well were he to retire first. "And in the morning,” she said, "do not rise until six, please. For then I, too* shall have risen, and you may pass through my chamber without fear of embarrassment.” Hampton thanked her profusely and retired. Being weary from his long walk, he slept soundly and awoke in the morning feeling much refreshed. He wondered, while dressing, if the Monsieur had re- turned home during the night, but assumed that he had. Then glanc- ing at his wrist watch, he saw that the time was many minutes past six. Doubtless Monsieur and Madame were up and waiting breakfast for him. He opened the door of his room and stepped boldly into the adjoining chamber. Mon Dieu! Surely* there was some mistake! There was no Mon- sieur to be seen, but the Madame was very much in evidence. She had not yet risen, much less left the room! In fact, she was reclining upon the bed in voluptuous abandon, appar- ently sound asleep. As the night (turn ocerj had been warm, she bad neglected to wear the usual sleeping garment and allowed the single coverlet to slip to the floor!

"As it is past six, I assumed that Madame would be in the living room, else I should not have entered here.” "Ah!” she said softly. "It is the big mistake. J forgot to inform Monsieur that I have the habit of oversleeping. But what does it mat- ter, Monsieur?” "Er—it is nothing, I suppose,” stammered Hampton, "unless, per- haps, my untimely intrusion has been embarrassing for Madame.” Her smile broadened; her bright eyes grew w'arm and glowing. Slowly rising to a sitting posture, she slid long, bare legs over the edge of the bed, and S3t for a moment sau- cily regarding him. Then she rose and moved forward.

After a hasty marriage she telephones Dad, but in- stead of being en- raged or jealous he congratulates her! Julie is heartbrok- en and dazedly consents to accom- pany her unwant- ed husband on a '‘business7' trip to Boston, by boat.

Still lethar- gic from the unknown intruder’s sens- uous love-making, Julie glanced up and saw Philip, white with anger, deal a blow that sent the white-haired man reeling. There was no fight, not even a quarrel. The intruder skulked sil- ently away, nursing his cheek, and Philip locked the door behind him. "So he's got you, too, has he?” he asked of the be- w i 1 d e r e d girl. Then,.as she only- stared, puzzled, he laughed harshly. "Or is he another ’platonic* friend, like Dad?” "Why I never saw this man be- fore!” she exclaim- ed, outraged. "I was asleep to-night when he came in. I heard him say something about some sketches.

Now she shud- dered, filled with horror at her own weakness. She should have killed the loathesome creature! He was, un- doubtedly, taking advantage of a foolish superstition that some silly woman had started. Strange power indeed! She almost wished for an- other chance in which to prove what little power he had over her, at least. There was no doubt that the man knew how to love, how to please a woman’s senses. He could, she thought, make surrender a very pleasant thing, but to make it an in- evitable and cer- tain thing — that she did not believe. It amused her to learn that Philip believed in it. ‘'His wife is on board, too,” he went on, morosely, "She’s very beauti- ful and he’s terrib- ly jealous of her.’* Julie began to understand. That tawny-haired woman, then, was Old 'Fascination's wife, and he was jenlous of her! He had entered the state- room to-night in search of those sketches of her! And after he got them, then what? Would he be sat- isfied to destroy them? Or would that one, wickedly inviting painting make him want to avenge himself on the man who had painted it? Julie was uneasy. Not that it mattered what happened to Philip, but murder is a very mussy business whoever the victim is.

Don’t you like me at all!” “No, I don't. You have no strange power over women!” she replied mockingly. "But you have over men!” he cried, his lips burning through the s;lk of her blouse. “Julie, Julie, I want you, awfully!” His eyes beg- ged, implored her. “How much longer must I endure this?” she inquired acidly. How dared, he act like that? The memory of those paintings in his suitcase seared her with all their hateful im- lications. “If you persist in he- aving so abominably, I'll take a deck chair!” “Wrong. You are going to stay right here with me where you belong. I married you because of a foolish whim that you had, but that wsis be- fore I knew how desire could torture a man. I’d do anything for you, you know I would! Why can’t you help me? Let me hold you, kiss you, at least.” Then, as she remained cold and silent, he gripped her shoulders hard. His breath came jerkily. The veins in his forehead showed, blue, trembling. He bit his lips in a strug- gle for control. Angered at his clutch upon her shoulders, she twisted sharply about. Her movement loosened the slender ribbon straps of her pajama blouse. Hastily she endeavored to replace the severed garment, but he held her arms down, his eyes frankly feasting upon the beauty thus uncovered. With an incoherent, pagan cry he swept her hungrily to his breast, bending her head far back with the fierceness of his kisses. When the torment within him had been somewhat appeased, he allowed her to sink back, exhausted, on the pillow. ' Don’t be too angry, mv dear- est,” he whispered and, with a linger- ing glance at her, he reluctantly climbed up into the top berth. For a long. long time, she lay mo- tionless in the dark, living over and over again those mad, passionate mo- ments when Philip’s lips had claimcd and possessed hers. Useless to deny that his touch had thrilled her as she had never known a woman could be No second-hand love for her, thank you! She regretted having allowed him a single kiss. Sleep was impossible after that for her, though the deep, measured breathing of her husband assured her that he, at least had fallen asleep. She lay and watched dawn creep through the shuttered window. Stealthy footsteps in the corridor caused her to sit up, alert and listen- ing. In the dimness she saw a white square slide under the door. A let- ter, apparently! She waited, while the soft footfalls died away, then* noiselessly she rose, stole across the room and took the envelope.

"Wc dock soon, better hurry,” she said briefly and went out on deck. "// I find he's painted a picture of you. III kill hint” her husband yelled. Tearing the letter in tiny bits she tucked the pieces away in a pocket of her suitcase, and then, keeping one eye upon the sleeping man in the top berth, she opened his suitcase and extracted the rolled drawings. Hastily she unwrapped them, placed them in her own suitcase and then wrapped the paper around a maga- zine, so that, if Philip looked, he would think the paintings were still there. "Not up already, Julie?'’ Philip's voice drawled sleepily. Yes—I'm, I'm dressing. Don’t look! ’ she managed to mumble, de- spite the fright caused by his ques- tion. There was no sign of Old Fascina- tion or his beautiful wife and she was rather relieved. She sat alone on a small folding chair, her troub- led eyes fixed unseeingly on the wa- ter below.

He had been falling for girls for fifteen years, and fourteen years had been spent in being thrown over by the girls he fell for. Now the composer of three successful musical comedies in collaboration with his friend Kel- sey Hammond, he found himself once more left in the lurch. Peggy Black was the offender this time, Peggy Black, the diminutive and peppy star of the first two Smell- Hammond music shows. J.

"O’t. it's terrible!” J. Torrington groaned when Kelsey Hammond, with whom he shared a luxurious Park Avenue apartment, broke the news. Kelsey grinned. ' You got all the best of it, my lad!” he stated with conviction. "You’re lucky and don't know it.” "But, Kelsey, I loved the girl!” "A man’s a fool to fall for some nitwit dame and let her get him all google-eyed. Me, I hate the sight of the creatures!” "But you don’t know what real love is, Kelsey!*’ Smell sat down at the ornate grand piano and strummed the keys reflec- tiv«. !y, producing soft and melan- c‘ y chords. "It’s beyond me how > ju, a woman-hater, can write such v-ul-stirring love lyrics,” he said. Kelsey grinned. "Oh, it*s easy. I just close my eyes and say to myself ‘Well, what would you write if you were damned fool enough to be in love?’ Then whatever I write, well, there I am.” Smeli sighed mournfully: *rWelI, I guess Peggy is well on her way to South America by this time.” Hammond started. "Yes! We’ve gotta dig up a new soprano for the rehearsal*. Here, let's see, somebody was telling me about a young dame with a good voice and not much ex- perience. She might take the job (turn over) _____- — 5 6 during rehearsals until Katz and Kohn sign up some other star for us. Can’t hold up the rest of the cast just because one dame decides to take a run-out powder. Oh, here’s the ad- dress, over on Sixth Avenue. Take a run up that way, wron’t you, and look this chicken up?” Smell took the slip of paper. It was. a shabby-looking brick dwelling which bore the number cor- responding to that on the slip wh:ch J. Torrington Smell consulted. He mounted the worn stone steps and pulled an old-fashioned bell-handle. A slatternly woman opened the door. J. Torrington doffed his hat, glanced at his memorandum again, and, clearin'! his voice, politely in- quired "Is this where Miss Donna Hissup lives?” The woman regarded him with ap- parent suspicion: "What do you want?” "I heard she was looking for an en- gagement, and—” His grim-visaged interlocutress re- lented a little. "Oh,” she said, open- ing the door a little wider. "A job for her, eh? Well, you can come in. It's time she was landin’ somethin'. She owes two weeks’ board bill. Go right upstairs. She’s on the third floor back. Go right up.” As he mounted the first flight of stairs, he heard a voice, pure and mel- odious, emanating from the regions above. When he reached the room from which the singing came, en- tranced by the voice, he forgot the formality of knocking. Grasping the door-knob impatienrly, he turned it and shoved. J. Torrington stum- bled awkwardly into the room and was met by a horrified shriek of dis- may. He raised his eyes and beheld a very beautiful and very nude young Ginger woman! He staggered back, his eyes roving the tiny room as though seeking es- cape. Why, it was a bathroom and this young woman was just stepping out of the tub when he opened the door! "I beg your pardon!” he gulped and stammered dismally. The girl threw a bath-towel about her, it covered her most incompletely, and glared through her blushes. "How dare you!” she stormed. "Didn’t you hear me singing?” she demanded. "Yes,*’ he repeated. "I heard you. That’s why I came in.” "Well, when you live in a place - like this, singing means to stay out. That’s why I was singing because there wasn’t any lock on the bath- room door.’* He managed to open the door un- der discussion. "I’m sorry!” he pleaded. "I didn't realize—* She shoved him out and slammed the door after him. "The idea! she sniffed. He ventured to tap on the closed portal. **I beg your pardon, but I’m looking for someone,” he protested feebly. "W'ell, look some other place. I want to come out of here and I have- n’t my bathrobe.” "But—bur can you tell me where to look?” he persisted. "Where to look for what?” "Why, for Miss Donna Hissup-”^ "What are you, a bill-collector?” "No. I want to see her about a singing position. Do you know her? ’ "Know her?” the voice was no longer fretful. "I am her! A sing- ing position, did I hear you say, or are my ears deceiving me?” "You are Donna Hissup. then? Oh, I was sure of it when I heard Ginger Stories 37 your voice!” And absent-mindedly, J. Torrington Smell opened the bath- room door again. I here came another shriek and then something warm and wet, some- thing that felt like a bath towel, was flung over his uncovered head, mask- ing his lace and eyes. Something soft and yielding bumped into him. He reeled, and felt a perfumed presence run past him with a little excited gig- Oh, Kelsey! She’s the most won- derlul, stunning, ravishing creature." Hammond peered at J. Torrington Smell quizzically. “My lord, have you fallen again?” Smell explained blushingly: "And —and she’s going to have dinner with me tonight!” "Where?” "Here.” “Oh, hell! That means I’ve gotta gle. By the time he had untangled himself from the bath towel and blinked his eves, the bathroom door was open and he was alone in the hall. A soft voice called to him from be- hind a door a little further up the hall. “If you won’t be so impatient, I’ll put on some clothes and we can talk like civilized human beings in- stead of naked savages.” “No savage could sing like that,” J. T orrington protested. “Well, did you find her?” Kelsey Hammond looked up as hi< co-work- er entered the apartment a bit later. go out! Damn women, anyhow.” But J. Torrington didn’t hear him. He was busy at the piano composing a new love-song. Later that evening, Hammond, pausing before he went out, shook an admonitory finger at his partner. “Remember what Peggy did to you!” he said in warning tones. “Don’r go putting your foot into another mess like that!” “The trouble with you,” said Kel- sey Hammond to J. Torrington Smell over their breakfast coffee three weeks later, “is that you're too slow. You don’t know an opportunity (turn over) 38 Ginger Storifs when you see one, and even if you recognized it you'd be too dumb to take advantage of it.’* "What do you mean?” asked J. Torrington. "I’m talking about this Hissop fe- male. You’re crazy about her, aren’t you?’* Smell shook his head. "I’ve sent her flowers and candy and raised her pay and promised her the understudy role in the show and she just smiles at me and says 'Thank you’ and that’s all I get.’* "Listen, kid! You know that dame's got a voice and lots of It—she could hold down the lead herself and get away with it like a million bucks, and you know it. What’s the an- swer?” "I don’t know. What i* the an- swer?” "You boob! Ar- range for her to get the lead part—on condition, see?” "Oh, I couldn’t do that!” "Why not? It’s being done every day. They like it, I tell you! Fair ex- change is no rob- bery.” "But how could I go about it?” "Oh, that's a mere detail!” Ham- mond said with an airy wave of his hand. "Leave ev- erything to me, kid!” So J. Torrington Smell left every- thing to Kelsey Hammond, and two nights later the stage was set. Donna Hi;sup was invited up to their apart- ment to go over certain interpola- tions in the score of the show, indj incidentally, for a snack of supper. When she arrived, J. Torrington was alone. "Where is Mr. Hamond?” she asked as he awkwardly helped her to remove her evening wrap. "He, he had to go out," her vis-a- vis explained with a flush. "You’ll stay for a bite anyhow, won’t you?’’ They ate, and retired to the com- fortable living room. Smell sat at the piano, and for twenty or thirty minutes they devoted themselves to the music under discussion. Then Smell swung about. "Miss Hissup, Donna, how would you like to have the lead in our show, instead of just the understudy part?” he asked. She rose from where she sat, her breath coming in sharp gasps. "The —the lead?” she said in unbeliet'ing "You mean Vm to be the leading lady}” she gasped unbelievingly. Ginger Storiei amazement. He nodded. ’ But, you’re jok- ing?” "I'm not! Here is the contract, sec?” He showed her the ready - prepared form that represent- ed everything she had dreamed of for years. She sank down on a c h * i r , limply. "Oh, it can't be true!" she said slow- ly- "But it is!” he said. And then he did a curious thing. He took the con- tract and its dupli- cate and deliberate- ly strode over to the wall-safe at one side of the room, opened it, and carefully placed the papers within its steel con- fines. He set a hand and twirled a dial. The door snicked shut. She looked at him curiously. "Why did you do that?’* He blushed heavily and his voice squeaked as he answered. "That’s a time-lock safe,” he told her, "and it’s set for seven tomorrow morning. It can’t be opened until then.” She stared at him questioningly. He tried to explain. "The con- tract is yours, when the safe opens, if you'll wait for it.” Understanding came to her sud- denly. She rose to unsteady feet. "I’ll fake my wrap, please!” she said. He was taken aback. The thing wasn't going according to Ham- mond's premeditated plot at all I She was turning him down! As the bath towel struck him, a per- fumcd presence swept past him with « gi&gle- It was nine the ne*r morning wh«oi Kelsey Hammond returned to th« apartment. J. Torrington Smell was dressed; there were blue circles under his bespectacled eyes. Donna Hissup was gone, the wrall-safe was open, and the signed duplicate was on the table- "Did it work, old timer?” Kelsey; asked jovially. "She left at seven-thirty thif morning with the contract/’ Smell answered. "Atta baby! Old Don Juan him- self!” And Kelsey Hammond smote his partner a mighty thwack on the back. Exactly thirty days from that morning, with Donna Hissup a smashing success in the Smell-Ham- mond musical hit, Kelsey Hammond looked keenly at his partner over 0turn to 9*6* W> 'A photographic composition in contrasting tones of black and white which is highly effective TROPICAL LURE! By Malcolm MacGregor Slowly her body began to sway to the wild tunc on the phonograph. IT WAS Mareea, the golden skin- ned, black haired, petite half- caste girl, who had prevented Tuan Jim Holiday from visiting the meager civilization of Moari for more than six months. Now as his schooner came in out of the coral sea and anchored at the cove of Moari, his first thoughts were of her. The thoughts were pleasant memories of the past mixed with a certain dread of the future. That first time he set foot on Moari, the half caste Polynesian had (turn ooer) 42 given herself to him as completely and unreservedly a? only such a girl will bestow her affections on anyone who really touchcs her heart. Because he was loftcsome and found that she was the an- swer to all his de- sire?. Tuan Jim had taken all she so willingly of- fered. But Tuan Jim was new to the tropics then and had heard strange tales of what happened to white men who took natives or half castes for sweethearts, and had run away even when he wanted to stay. He had also heard how fickle is the af- fection of a half caste, and since an unpleasant affair with a woman in the States had driven him to the South Seas, he was not anxious to have it repeated. He had come to love Mareea greatly and had post- poned his visit to Moari because he feared a meeting with her would causc him to weaken. But business for his copra plantation, a small island several hundred miles from Moari, had made it necessary for him to return. As soon as his boat anchored, he hurried up the beach to the one hotel Moari had to offer. Two men and one woman were seated on the ver- anda, and although he knew only one of the men, he nodded pleasantly Ginger Storibs Pf pci a almost gasped as his strong arms bound }yer tightly to him. to the trio. When he entered the hotel he heard a whispered conver- sation among them and felt certain his aftair with Mareea was the topic of it. It was not until dinner that he met the woman. She was young and quite pretty, with a mischievous twinkle in her dark eyes that should not have been there. She was intro- duced to him as Betty Bettison, wife of die new missionary to the Moari district. At that moment, her hus- band was carrying on a religious campaign among natives in a group of atolls some distance from Moari. He had feared the heat would be too intense for his wife to accompany him, and had left her in the meager civilization of Moari. Juan Jim found her quite inter- esting, and long after dinner was over sat on the mosquito-netted ver- anda alone with her. For one so young, and particularly as the wife of an island missionary, she seemed to know much of life and possessed a great love for it. *T hear you are the one white man who has been able to resist the lure of native and half-caste girls,” she said suddenly. Tuan Jim looked at her with sur- prise for a moment; then, with a smile he admitted that affairs with native girls were not included in his weaknesses. “Then you haven’t met Pepcta, have you?” asked the woman. *T don't think 1 ever heard of her,” admitted Tuan Jim. "Then you should know her be- fore you pass judgment on half-caste g.’r! . Pepeta is the embodiment of .1 il life, love and passion, and wor- sh 'pz only pleasure.” I lasn’t your husband tried to convert her?” I’m afraid my husband has rcached the point where he is ready to admit he can never do anything for her. You should meet her some- time.” “Thanks, but I am quite content without her acquaintance.” “But she is very beautiful, especi- ally in the moonlight. Her hair is long and jet black, her eyes are large and dark and one look from them is enough to make any man forget himself. To see her strolling along the beach or beneath the trees at night makes one think of Diana. I always feel that men are the object of her hunt.” Tuan Jim thought it rather strange conversation for the wife of a mis- sionary, but he lud seen before strange emotions brought to the sur- face by the tropic moon. He made no comment, and a short time later, .ifter a promise to take Betty Betti- son for an inspection of his schooner naxt day, retired to his room. He had been in his room only a short time, writing several letters he intended to mail the next day, when he heard a faint rattling at the bam- boo screen over the window that led out into the garden. Looking up he saw a dainty, tapering leg, with a smail leis encircling the ankle, pro- ject its way over the sill. The leg was so pretty, with its gol- den hue made all the more sensuous in the moonlight, that he watched eagerly a* another leg came over the window sill to join it. Dimpled knees came next into view, then well moulded thighs. He expectcd to see a naked girl enter the room from behind the bamboo screen, but as the body* came further into view he saw th.it a gaudy sash had been tied about her hips, with a great knot in front. Then, with a sudden bound, the girl leaped into the room, and he saw that the sash was her only article of clothing, except leis about the neck and wrists and lotus blossoms in her hair. For a moment Tuan Jim had feared it was Mareea, for he knew she would recognize his schooner in the harbor and would come hunting for him. Bue instead it was a stranger who faced him with a flash- ing '■mile of pearly teeth. The girl stood just inside the window, her smile becoming more sensuous as her grerrt dark eyes surveyed his athletic body. "Good evening, Mistaire Man,” she said slowly in a droning voice that was almost a caress. "Who are you?" demanded Tuan Jim. "1 am Pepeta, the desire of all men. And I have come to see Mistaire Tuan Jeem.” "I am Tuan Jim Holiday. What do you wish?” "Ah, Mistaire Tuan Jeerri! Men do not talk so to Pepeta. Ah, no, never! And especially, Mistaire Tuan Jeem, when I have come'to dance for them.” . 'Tin afraid you have made a mis- take, girl. I don't even know you.** "Ah, no, but before morning Mis- taire Tuan Jeem will know Pepeta very welj and will want her to come back always to dance for him and love him!** Before Tuan Jim could say any- thing further, the girl walked across the room, turned on the phonograph,- then glided to the center of the room. It was a tango and not the sobbing notes of a South Sea number that came from the battered machine, but it seemed the sort of wild music that suited the girl. For several tense moments she stood with one hand on her hip and her head thrown back as she listened to the music, then slowly her body started to sway as she began a dance of her own conception. It was a weird, sensuous thing that called to all that was wild in Tuan Jim, and he felt himself growing weak as he watched her. As the Phallic gods put into dances all their desires, so did the girl, and Tuan Jim felt the blood pounding at his temples with the same great de- sires. Each move of the girl made him want to crush her in his arms so tightly ic would hurt her, yet he wanted to caress her bare shoulders tenderly; he wanted to kiss her lips niore vehemently than he had ever kissed anyone, and wanted'her to lie passive in his arms. It was not love, but carnal desire. He knew now why white men went mad over half- caste girls, and felt that it must have been real love he possessed for Mareea because she had only called to the tender romance in him. But he was not thinking of Mareea or anyone else as he watched the sway of Pepeta's hips, the Hash of her dark eyes as she let him know she found h'/n desirable; her bare breasts that seemed polished gold in the pale "She h a white devil.

Before the dance had been com- pleted, he leaped suddenly to his feet and gathered her tightly in his arms. Pepeta went willingly to him and held her lips ready to meet his. It was such a kiss as he had never be- fore known. It was the answer to all passion, yet the keynote to more. With his lips pressed rightly to hers. he lifted her bodily from the floor and carried her to jhe bed. As he dropped down on the bed beside her, Pepeta began running her fingers through his hair and cares- sing his cheeks as she murmured sofc little words of endearment and of- fered no objections to the liberties he took with hi* hands.

''Come!” She put out her dimpled hand and caught his large brown one and with a coquettish laugh led him from the room. In the hall, she stopped long enough to brush his cheeks with her long eyelashes—her "Butterfly Kiss.” Then she led him through the library door, and into the booklined room, glowing and mellow in the waning afternoon light. Crossing to the table, she took a cigarette from a silver box. Quietly, Leland Hinnum watched her. Without a word, he took a match box from his pocket and held a match for her. He was so tall and she so petite that she almost had to stand on tiptoe to light the cigarette held in her full red lips. He smiled down at her—the typi-. cal soldier, erect, bronzed, and silent with keen observant eyes and a firm- set mouth. Leaning over, he suddenly took the cigarette from her lips and kissed her. "Nan, dear,” he said, "you’re a pretty thing!” He squared his shoulders, look out a cigarette and, as he tapped it on his case, said quietly: "Who is our friend, the cat? When did she appear in our midst?” His eyes were on a china figure set on the flat desk under the window. It was an amusing cat, a grotesque conception. Huge preposterous whiskers stuck out from a mouth that 3t one mo- ment seemed to grin sardonically and ar the next appeared merely a china cat’s china mouth. But the whiskers •only helped to give the cat its gro- tesquely human expression; it was the eyes that were really responsible for it.

Wonder where Jack picked it up?” He laughed. "You know, Nan, I think there’s some- thing strangely like Jack himself in that cat! "Yes,” Leland continued in a curi- ously flat ominous tone, "i’ve seen your husband look exactly like that, especially when he’s been watching you and me.” He turned keen eyes on Nan’s troubled face. "Oh, Lee, what do you mean? You can’t mean that Jack imagines that—” She broke off abruptly. "That you are seeing too much of me?” Leland finished her sentence smoothly. "Well, I don’t know. There have been times when I have thought that he did suspect my feel- ings.” He laughed again, a short apologetic laugh. "Silly, 1 suppose. But sometimes I get hunches. L^sed to have them when I wras in the trenches. I could always tell before- hand when gas was going to drift into our trench.

With a swift strong motion he caught her up in his arms; he spoke passionately: "I want you, Nan! 1 can’t help it! You must listen. Let him go, let's go away together. Lord! How I want you!” "Lee!'’ Nan found her voice- She struggled away from him. "How dare you take me in your arms? How care you? You, oi all men and I trusted you!” Leland seemed surprised. He started at her voice and stared at her closely. “But I thought—I thought that you cared for me, Nan.” His voice was shaking. "Cared for you?” There was a fine scorn in her tone. Cared i\ r you? I thought I liked you but I hate you now, Leland Hannum— hate you! Do you understand? I detest vou!” "But Nan—*’ His protest was cut short. "Go awav,” she begged. "Leave me alone. I want to be alone. If you don’t go. I’ll tell my husband the whole truth, how you’ve tried to make love to mo again and again. I’m sick of it. I tell you, I want only Jack, just Jack! Oh, why did I ever even flirt with you? I'm so ashamed.” "But I love you, Nan. I want you.” "Stop!” Her voice was sharp. "If you don't go, I'll ring for Mat- thew.” Her voice broke, she sank into a chair. "All right!” Leland turned away from her. "If you feel this way, 111 go but I'll stay away. Remem- ber that. I am no woman's play- Ginger Stories i 53 A Womanly FORMf thing.” Leland was gone. Nan sat in the chair, near the huge centcr table, staring with wide startled eyes at the china cat. Its eyes seemed more sin- ister. more questioning than ever. She straightened as her husband came into the room. He walked to her side, and she saw that he was in good humor. "Home so soon?” she said slowly. **I hadn’t expected you for hours yet.” Jack Pierce smiled. He was slightly inclined toward stoutness, and his small eyes, which usually seemed to glitter, were quite passive now. “Rushed back,” he said in his thick peculiar tone. “Meeting went along a little faster than I had ex- pected. How about the 'Follies’ to- night?” "Splendid,” she replied. **A little music would be pleasant.” He leaned over, kissed her upon the forehead. *T11 run along and phone for tickets,” he said and left the room. Nan listened to his foot-falls as he went up the stairs to his room. Again her eyes rested upon the grin- ning slanting eyes of the cat. Opening her left hand, she slowly uncreased the bit of white paper which Leland Hannum had scrawled j upon. Again she read: "Dictaphone in the cat. ^'ire un- der carpet to another room. Jack’s probably listening in. Kick me out viciously when I make love and then meet me tomorrow at the Club Lido at eight. How’s that for cat’s eyes?” Nan smiled a mischievous happy smile. She rase and walked to the humidor. As the note llamed, she glanced again at the china cat. Its eyes were delightfully wicked. It was such a clever thing!

Look!” Before Tuan Jim realized what she was about, Mareea ran across the room to the bed where Pepeta lay watching her with frightened eyes. With a quick movement, Mareea grasped the sash about the other girl's hips and snatched it off. As Tuan Jim looked, he saw that the flesh the sash had covered was white. Pepeta was a white woman! "Don’t you know her, Tuan Jim?” demanded Alareea. "It is the wife of the missionary, who at night when her husband is away stains her body and becomes Pepeta. In the day she has all men’s respect, and at night se- lects her lovers. But Mareea li3s al- ways remained true to Tuan Jim.” As Tuan Jim stood looking at the two women, one who liad fought for his love and the other for his pas- sion, the girl who had been Pepeta quickly picked up the sash, and wrapping it hurriedly about her hips, fled from the room through the same window she had entered. For several long moments after she had gone, Tuan Jim sat in a chair watching the window where she had disappeared. Then Mareea walked slowly over and knelt down beside him, taking one of his hands in both her own. "Will Tuan Jim now be afraid to take Mareea on to his island to live with him and love him always?” she asked. "We'll go back in the morning.

J. Torrington flushed painfully. "‘Why should she tell you that?” "She said there was someone else in her heart, didn’t she?” Smell nodded gloomily. "Well, kid, I’m him!" J. Torrington Smell looked at him with eyes popp^g* “You? You, the woman-hater? Are you trying to kid me?*' Kelsey Hammond had the grace to cast his glance downward. "Guess I'm not a woman-hater any more, at least, as far as Donna is concerned.** he said. "We’re gonna be married next week.” Smell stared at him. ‘'Even, even knowing that she stayed all night here with me to get the contract?” he cried. Kelsey Hammond roared with laughter. "She told me all about that wild night with you!” he gasped be- tween chuckles. ‘ How you begged her to stay, promised not to touch her, and then played dominoes all night uit/j her!" J. Torrington managed to Summon a grin. "Well, I beat her every garni, anyhow!*' he said. "She can’t plav a good hand of dominoes.” But there was a funny glint in his eye, and Kel- sey Hammond spent most of his mar- ried life wondering what sort of game his wife had played the night she got the contract. Gingbr Stories Mad, Bad, Baby (Continued from page 32) her watchful eyes caught a glimpse of snowy hair. Old Fascination was waiting. No sooner had they landed than two huge men seized Philip and held him while Old Fascination opened the suitcase and hurriedly pawed over it* contents. It was all done so swiftly, so quietly that few people noticed anything out of the ordin- ary. Philip, seeing the impossibility of breaking away from the brutes that held him, did not struggle, made no outcry. But his face whitened and took on such a tense, strained expression that Julie longed to run to him, to tell him not to worry. Old Fascination’s wife leaned against the wall, weak and trembling, her big black eyes darting feverishly about as though seeking a place in which to hide. Julie was feminine enough to feel no sympathy for her, the woman whom her husband loved! "So! You would lie to me, would you?-' the old man exulted softly, picking up the rolled package and lingering it lovingly, gloatingly, "‘Expected me to believe that there never had been any paintings of you. did you?’' His sharp, cruel eyes held his wife’s frightened ones while he slowly untied the string. ‘'Re- member what I told you would hap- pen to both you and the man who dared paint you? Ah yes, I see that you do recall! And you know that I always keep my word!” He tore off the paper, his mouth suddenly grim, unyielding. A gaudily cov- ered magazine fell to the floor! A silly, sheepish expression on his florid face, he snatched it up, leafed hurriedly through it; then, thor- oughly disgusted, he flung it down again.

May I ask for what reason?” It was Philip’* caustic voice who ventured this ques- tion. At a sign from the old man, he was released and he faced Old Fascination angrily. ”1—I was told you were carrying some—pictures of my wife,” the old man stammered, chagrined and at a loss. "But I told you that that rumor about the pictures was not true! ’ his wife said, triumphantly. She had recovered her poise and looked very completely the outraged grande dame. Irritably he seized her arm and was about to walk away when sud- denly his keen, white-lashed blue eyes encountered Julie’s uneasy gaze. He stopped, glanced down at the small suitcase she carried. A slow smile crept over his face. He re- leased his wife, walked deliberately over to Julie. The dreaded possibility of this had occurred to her, however, and she was not unprepared. The grave fact that her husband’s life depended upon whether or not she could suc- cessfully manage Old Fascination gave her a courage that, under vastly different circumstances, ' Broadway Baby’* had never had. She swun^ the suitcase carelessly back and forth, as though unaware that the man s eyes were fixed intently upor. I:. Sitting alone on the dct -.:zt morning, just before the ship ’'.ad docked, she had foreseen some sach difficulty and had decided upon her own method of defense. Since Old Fascination was noted for, and proud of his ability to “get” women, in this very power, reasoned Julie shrewdly, there also lay his weakness. If he enjoyed swaying women to his will, it was inevitable that he should also like to bs swayed. At any rate, it Ginger Stories 59 I was her only weapon, and she decided to use it. When he was close beside her, but had not as yet spoken, she sidled up a little nearer, her red mouth curlcd up in a deliberately seductive smile. "I regret the untimely—interrup- tion, last night,” she whispered, glancing up at him through lowered lashes. ''Perhaps, to-night, going back—matters could be more satis- factorily arranged.” She looked up, with a boldness born of confidence in her own power, and over Old Fascination’s shoulder her eyes met the agonized horrified ones of her husband.

He has deserted me, the rogue, and I am left very much alone.” Abruptly it dawned upon Hamp- ton that the ‘'accident” had been very cleverly planned; that the Ma- dame had desired it to happen! "No, dear Madame,” he said, mov- ing forward and placing his hands upon her bare shoulders, ’'you are not alone! For am I not here with you?” "Indeed, Monsieur, so you are!” she laughed, walking into his waiting arms. "You will not start on your journey again this morning, non?” ‘'No,” replied Hampton huskily.

I and Mickey were the first in, but the others followed with very wet smacks before we had a chanco to lie about the water being fine. 1 he shrieks and yells would have quickened a bunch of Censors. Then the lights went on again. One of them vaunted superior intellects that colleges are supposed to turn out by the double gross actually lived up to expectations. Mickey was just pull- ing me out by the skin of my teeth, the only thing he could get a hold on, when the illuminations did their stuff. Honest to Gawd, dearie, I al- most plunged in again. I had lost my costume! It turned out later, dearie, that I hadn’t lost it at all. It was merely a case of glia ran teed unshrinkable scuff thumbing its nose at the guarantee’ “Merciful Heaven! What is that?” shrieks the old maiden aunt of a Prexv who had to come at just that point of a watery tale to cast a ben- evolent eye around to see if the be- nign influence was working. Any- ways, that was what he was supposed to be doing. But between yuh and I and a telegraph pole, dearie, he was really losing both eyes gazing at me. "Woman!” he thundered. "Who art thou?” Though why it's always my scornful luck to be picked on I don’t know. There were plenty oth- er perfect examples of high art stand- ing around at that guilty moment. "Who, me?” I says elegantly, get- ting my back up. It was the only thing 1 could get up, dearie. ’ Say, yuh son of a lady finger, pull in your phantasmazoria. Don't yuh know a Ginger Stories water nymph when yuh see one? That's what I am, a coy little water nymph!!” And do yuh know what that old Beelzebub said? "Then in rhe name of ali the Fathers of Abraham, get into the water!” That s a prayerful way of saying "take a dive,” dearie. So I did, and that s the first time 1 ever took will- ingly to the H20. But instead of sinking gracefully out of the vulgar glare of the limelight, I floated grandiloquently on the surface! There’s a saying yuh know, dearie, about people of generous proportions being like Ivory Soap, pure and non- sinkable. I reckon I’m purer than I thought. ! inhaled enough to sink the Leviathan, but I remained within sight of all concerned. And were they concerned? A good time was had by all but yours truly. A case of stay 011 the surface and yuh stay all over. So there I was like a first cousin of Lady Godiva, only my mannish hair 1 cut didn’t begin to come up to my , expectations! And then as a final publicity stunt | that blankety-blank old moon takes a header out of the skylight and falls into the pool right over my head like a halo. Though, Gawd knows, a halo was not what the undressed nymphs are wearing at present. The spot- light behind that deposed moon was now turned directly upon me, just as if I wasn’t lit up enough. 1 tried my level best to sink then, i held my breath and everything, but I was like a government bond issue. I floated on a good foundation, archi- tecturally speaking, dearie. Well, yuh know the old saw, yuh can’t keep a good man down. I guess maybe it applys to the womanly sex as well.

Two Devils for Devlin {Continued from page 11) The two girls were glaring at each otljer now, and their voices were gradually getting louder. Devlin knew that Chong, who slept only a couple of rooms down the hall, would hear if they kept this up. And if he heard, and reported to Alice. . . Toa-lea and Tolu were closer to him than ever, working every wile they knew, and they knew a lot of them. In spite of himself, Al felt that he couldn’t stand this much longer. He jumped out of the bed and slipped into a robe. uWe dance for you!” said Tolu. And forthwith she and Toa-lea be- gan to trip an amazing, seductive dance in the moonlight. It was a dance that could mean only one thing. It w*asn’c suggestive; it was downright invitational! Al had a sudden idea. He dashed to a cabinet and came back with a couple of boxes of cheroots. "Here, take these and go back to Illybo! Here, take another box for him, too! Yes, you each can keep a box! No, don’t go out the door, for Lord’* sake. Climb out the window.

He breathed a sigh of re- lief as they disappeared through the window and sneaked quietly off, bare of foot, in the brilliant moonlight. The next morning Devlin thought Chong looked at him a bit queerly, but he put it down to imagination. That afternoon Chong was out in a proa in the lagoon, fishing for sup- per. Devlin lay in a hammock, tak- ing his siesta. There was a light footfall on the veranda, and Al opened his eyes. Then he opened them wider, and opened his mouth too! There before him stood a girl whose only garment was a brilliant- hued sarong about her middle, a girl whose hair was brown, and whose skin was almost as light as Devlin’s own! Like some coryphee from the Folies Bergere she stood there smiling at him, swaying ever so little from the hips and waiting for him to speak. “Who are you?" he gasped. Could this be a native girl? Her attire suggested it, but otherwise she seemed to belong more to Fifth Avenue than to Tongalusa. “I’m Dawn-Blossom. I am yours.” “Mine?” “Illybo sent me.” “You—Illy bo—?” She smiled. "Illybo realized that you didn’t care for Toa-lea and Tolu, or you wouldn’t have sent them back. So he gave you me.” “But, you don’t talk like—M “A native?” she laughed. “My father was a white trader. And I’ve gone through the high school at Port Wyrka. Illybo considers me his dearest possession, but I’m glad to get out gf his harem.

Then he came out of his stupefaction. He suddenly rea- lized that there was Alice and that he had given her a promise. “But Illybo’s got me all wrong, Dawn-Blossom. I didn’t send those girls back because I didn’t like ’em. I sent them back because I didn't want 'em! Illybo’s crazy! I don’t want any of his wives! I’m going to get one of my own, soon. See? Now you go back like a good girl and put him straight, won't you?" “You mean you don't w’ant me?** die girl came over to him, leaned over him, her warm breath in his face. He closed his eyes to ward off temptation. "Go away!’* he said weakly. **You would send me back to that fat old man? Look, look at me! I am young. I am fair. I am as white as you. Am 1 not desirable?” He groaned. "Of course you are, damn it. You know only too well how desirable you are. But, please go!'* Her shoulders slumped. She turned away, and wandered off down the path that led to the lagoon. Al, shaking, mixed himself a drink. If this kept up, that two months were going to Be mighty wearing on the constitution! At which moment a rich, tinkling laugh came from behind him, from the doorway of his house. He turned, startled. “Why, why, Alice!” he gasped. The red-haired nirfrse was standing there, cool and entrancing in a frilly pink frock that made her look more adorable than she'd been in her white uni- form. “Alice!" Devlin gasped again* Ginger Storibs "You here?" She came to him. 'My hero!” she •aid, and grinned. ’’Great big strong mum. to resist such temptation Hi* brain reeled. “Yon saw?" She nodded. ’’And anyone who could resist Peg Malone in such a get- up deserve* plenty of credit!”' she ttated. -Peg Malone—?’* “Yes, ‘Dawn Blossom*. She’s a pal of mine. A nurse too. You see, after you’d left Port Vytka, I got lonely for you. I was sorry to have sent you away like that. So I got a launch, and Peg came along. It was a beautiful moonlight night and we came here to TongJusa to see you.” ’ Last, last night?** “Yes. ^‘e got here late, and Chong let us in and said you were asleep but that he‘d get you up. Pie went to your room, then came dash- ia3* back, and called us. We peeped in through a chink in your door and saw you having such a time with Illvbo’s envoys.” "You saw all that?'* he breathed h*aviljr. She nodded. *'I was satisfied, then, that you'd keep your word, but Peg suggested that perhaps you'd be that way only v. here native girls were concerned. So. with Chong's ltd. we fixed up the little comedy of this afe.rnoon, And oh, darling, 1 m so P'l jd of yuu! ‘ She offered herself for a kiss. "Then, that girl isn’t half native?” A! said, after a while- ”Of course not.** A\ »’U Ice her be a bridesmaid, then' ’ he said.
