bowed I stand and greet you from the trembling sea That like some white haired slave before a queen With all its shining foam fawns at your feet  I greet you from the sea above whose combers Your heavy perfumes break upon the wind Behind them tower your mutilated trunks And beckon me to the Americas  I greet you from the sea that woos you still Like some wild chieftan with dishevelled locks Knowing that deep in your inviolate heart Is born the hollow ship that scars its face And mocks its depths with straining keel and sail   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  O forest of my fathers deity To whom the Incas and the Aztecs bowed I stand and greet you from the shining sea I turn to you and feel my soul set free Behind me lies the stress of modern ways I have become for very sight of you Like one of your wise tribal patriarchs Who slept of old upon your tender grass And drank the milk of goats and ate their bread Sweetened with honey of the forest bee  I look on you and I am comforted For the thick ranks of all your tufted trees Recall to me how centuries ago With twice ten thousand archers at my heels I led the way whither the mountains smoke And lift their craters from the shores of lakes And how at length I wandered to the realm Of the great Inca Yupanqui and went Following him upon the mountain tops Down to Arauco and its peaceful slopes And rested in a tent of condors wings  I look on you and I am comforted Because the centuries have marked me out To be your poet and to raise the hymns Of joy and grief that in heroic dawns The Cuzco smote upon his lyre of stone  Legends of Aztec emperors and songs   Of bold Palenkes and Tahuantisuyos Vanished like Babylon from off this earth  Here in your presence with your savage spell Leaping in all my veins the centuries Lift like a vision from the abyss of time And pass before me in unfading youth  So I evoke the ages still unformed That saw your first tree burst its bonds of stone And all the others headlong on its track With the ordained disorder of the stars So I evoke the endless chain of time Of creeping growth and slow monotony That passed before your roots were fired with sap And all your trunks took form beneath their bark And all the knots of every branch were loosed To join the hymn of your primeval Spring  And now your flowering branches are a cage For singing birds fantastic orchestra Above whose din the fickle mocking bird  Pours its strange song and only one is mute The solemn quetzal that in silence flaunts His rainbow plumage with heraldic pomp Above the tombs of a departed race  Your countless blue and rosy butterflies Flutter and fan themselves coquettishly Your buzzing insects glitter in the sun   Glimmer and glow like gems and talismans Encrusted in the hilts of ancient swords Your crickets scold and when the day is spent And fire flies light your depths where beasts of prey Stalk in the gloom as through a nightmare gleam The sulphurous pupils of satanic eyes  Yours is the tapir that in mountain pools Mirrors the shape of his deformity And rends the jungle with his monstrous head Yours the lithe jaguar nimble acrobat That from the branches darts upon his prey And yours the tiger cat sly strategist With gums of plush and alabaster fang The crocodile is yours that venerable Amphibious guardian of crops and streams Whose emerald eyes peer from the oozy caves And yours the boa that seems a mighty arm Hewn from the shadow by a giant axe  But like a sponge into your labyrinth Of tropic growth you suck each living thing The strength of muscles and the blood of veins There to beget in your exuberance The warlike plumes of your imperial palms Whose milky fruits refreshed in by gone day The tribes grown weary with long pilgrimage  And there the patriarchal ceiba tree Offered its canopy to pondering chiefs   José Santos Chocano  Counselling war or peace beneath its boughs And there is Pindar s oak and there the tree Of Lebanon and the mahogany Whose fragrant wood in European courts The cunning craftsman polishes and shapes To thrones of kings and marriage beds of queens  Forest of my fathers deity To whom the Incas and the Aztecs bowed I greet you from the sea and breathe this prayer That with the night the close approaching night You may entomb me in your sacred dusk Like some dim spectre of forgotten cults And that to fire my eyes with savage light And wild reflection of your revelry Burning upon the tip of every tree That points into the night you set a star  A SONG OF THE ROAD  The way was black The night was mad with lightning I bestrode My wild young colt upon a mountain road And crunching onward like a monster s jaws His ringing hoof beats their glad rhythm kept Breaking the glassy surface of the pools Where hidden waters slept A million buzzing insects in the air On droning wing made sullen discord there   But suddenly afar beyond the wood Beyond the dark pall of my brooding thought I saw lights cluster like a swarm of wasps Among the branches caught The inn I cried and on his living flesh My broncho felt the lash and neighed with eagerness  And all this time the cool and quiet wood Uttered no sound as though it understood  Until there came to me upon the night A voice so clear so clear so ringing sweet A voice as of a woman and her song Dropped like soft music winging at my feet And seemed a sigh that with my spirit blending Lengthened and lengthened out and had no ending  And through the empty silence of the night And through the quiet of the hills I heard That music and the sounds the night wind bore me Like spirit voices from an unseen world Came drifting o er me  I curbed my horse to catch what she might say At night they come and they are gone by day And then another voice with low refrain And untold tenderness took up the strain Oh love is but an inn upon life s way At night they come and they are gone by day Their voices mingled in that wistful lay   Then I dismounted and stretched out my length Beside a pool and while my mind was bent Upon that mystery within the wood My eyes grew heavy and my strength was spent And so I slept there huddled in my cloak And now when by untrodden paths I go Through the dim forest no repose I know At any inn at nightfall but apart I sleep beneath the stars for through my heart Echoes the burden of that wistful lay At night they come and they are gone by day And love is but an inn upon life s way  EL CHARRO  A coat of silk cheap jewels he loves to flaunt Some tawdry lace that serves him for a frill He grasps a pistol butt and seems to taunt The world and grip it in his ugly will  Striding his bronco with its braided tail Crowned by a hat that tapers to a cone One feels no bribe nor violence could prevail To make him change his saddle for a throne  Proud of his seat he cracks his rawhide lash The brute obeys a spark flies from his hoof He plunges and with pistol at his sash His master strides him haughty and aloof  These seem no man and horse in mortal strife But some Olympic figure come to life  THE MAGNOLIA  Deep in the wood of scent and song the daughter Perfect and bright is the magnolia born White as a flake of foam upon still water White as soft fleece upon rough brambles torn  Hers is a cup a workman might have fashioned Of Grecian marble in an age remote Hers is a beauty perfect and impassioned As when a woman bares her rounded throat  There is a tale of how the moon her lover Holds her enchanted by some magic spell Something about a dove that broods above her Or dies within her breast I cannot tell  I cannot say where I have heard the story Upon what poet s lips but this I know Her heart is like a pearl s or like the glory Of moonbeams frozen on the spotless snow  José Santos Chocano Translated by John Pierrepont Rice  OLD ROOFS  I  I have seen old roofs Broken for winds to enter All their secrets flown like homing birds It seemed to me they were like broken words They babbled inarticulate of men Who came and went and will not come again They were full of whispers and of shadows  Provisioned for a dream s viaticum These only had a voice All all the other roofs were dumb  II  Under an old roof I went one day But there was naught to see Singing silken drapery  Went down the hall with me I was aware Of feet upon the stair  Soft laughter and a little sound of tears Muffled by many years It was the roof the broken roof that sung The living roofs were silent But the dead roof had a tongue  POETRY A Magazine of Verse  HARBURY  All the men of Harbury go down to the sea in ships The wind upon their faces the salt upon their lips  The little boys of Harbury when they are laid to sleep Dream of masts and cabins and the wonders of the deep  The women folk of Harbury have eyes like the sea Wide with watching wonder deep with mystery  I met a woman Beyond the bar she said Beyond the shallow water where the green lines spread  Out beyond the sand bar and the white spray My three sons wait for the Judgment Day  I saw an old man who goes to sea no more Watch from morn till evening down on the shore  The sea s a hard mistress the old man said The sea is always hungry and never full fed  The sea had my father and took my son from me Sometimes I think I see them walking on the sea  I d like to be in Harbury on the Judgment Day When the word is spoken and the sea is wiped away  Louise Driscoll  And all the drowned fisher boys with sea weed in their hair Rise and walk to Harbury to greet the women there  I d like to be in Harbury and see the souls arise Son and mother hand in hand lovers with glad eyes  I think there would be many who would turn and look with me Hoping for another glimpse of the cruel sea  They tell me that in Paradise the fields are green and still With pleasant flowers everywhere that all may take who will  And four great rivers flowing from out the Throne of God That no one ever drowns in and souls may cross dry shod  I think among those wonders there will be men like me Who miss the old salt danger of the singing sea  For in my heart like some old shell inland safe and dry Anyone who harks will still hear the sea cry  Louise Driscoll  POETRY A Magazine of Verse  SILENCE OF THE NIGHT  I  The silence of the night is full of voices Voices like the trumpets of angels Blown across the stars from the ramparts of heaven  Voices like the stillness Of one newly dead The silence of the night Empty of cry of bird or beast  Empty of stir of leaf or branch Empty of all human utterance  Is filled with voices  In the silence of the night 1 stood by the garden pool in the darkness And I heard a voice crying  Wake For the feet of Him who comes are on the threshold of the  worlds Wake For He holds the worlds in His hands  In the silence of the night In the shadows by the pool in the darkness I heard a voice answer  Sleep For the hour of waking will come will come   Maurice Browne  Sleep and dream not Sleep and be at rest Sleep  While ye may  In the silence of the night I heard a voice Like the trumpet of an angel In the silence of the night I heard a voice Like a soul passing Where the trees brood over the pool In the darkness of my garden  II  Then In the silence of the night Suddenly I heard a woman weeping And I heard a girl singing By the pool In the darkness of my garden In the stillness of the night  O singing girl singing girl singing girl Singing through the night Singing singing under the trees Singing singing singing beside the pool in the darkness Come away singing Come away O my lover   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Love Love Love singing like a bird among the branches Golden throated singer young for ever undying Singing of love all night among the shadows under the silence Under the silence of the stars Under the silence of the night Under the eternal silence Sing sing sing Sing for ever for ever through the darkness Sing through the silence sing through the everlasting silence Sing shattering the silence You also For ever  In the silence of the night I heard a girl singing And I heard a woman Weeping in the darkness  O singing girl singing girl Singing all night long Singing of love of love to my heart in the darkness of the  garden Love Love Love Love singing full throated triumphal Virginal golden hearted magical in the stillness Sing for ever for ever  In the silence of the night I heard a girl singing And I heard a woman weeping   Maurice Browne  A woman weeping Weeping in the darkness  Singing girl O singing girl Sing for me again in the darkness Sing for me sing for me in the darkness Sing again sing again for me in the darkness O singing girl singing girl Sing for me again  By the pool In the silence of the night I heard a woman weeping A woman weeping in the darkness Quietly ceaselessly Weeping in the darkness Through the long night Through the night that will not end Through the eternal night  O singing girl my singing girl Rain rain rain Rain among the leaves and on the branches Rain on the branches in the darkness Rain  Lost lost lost O lost O lonely O forsaken O my lover O lonely O my lover  Lost   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Never never never Nevermore his feet upon the threshold O the trumpet that pealed upon the threshold Nevermore never never  Thereafter By the pool listening I heard silence enfold the night Where the wet trees  Make a darkness of my garden  III  And again a third time The silence of the night was filled with voices Antiphonal voices like the trumpets of the sons of God Pealing from star to star across the ramparts of heaven Answering voices hushed like the stillness Of one dead who will not awaken The silence after the song had ceased The silence that followed after The tears of another Were aflame and terrible with voices  What is the silence of the night to us  Or the tears of a woman  Or the singing of a girl in the darkness  Or the silence after the singing  What to us are silence and song   Maurice Browne  Then Over and under and about the silence And through the silence And filling the silence While dawn Moving over the darkness Touched like a lover the pool in my garden The voices of the night met and mingled And were one  Make an end of tears in the night Make an end of singing in the darkness Sing in the dawn the dawn In the dawn make a song of your tears  Let your tears be a song for ever In the great silence  In the hush of dawn  Between the night and the day  I heard this voice  A voice like the stillness of God  Maurice Browne 1916   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  SNOW MONOTONES  A great white leopard prowling silently Over the house tops up and down the sky Trailing its ermine and its ivory The lithe and sinuous snow creeps softly by  The air is crowded and the day alight The houses etched in stuccoed boundaries Loom radiant while in capricious flight The snow paints ghostly summer on the trees  With opals and with lustered silks inlaid The snow spreads out its long unbroken seas And frames each house in candied masquerade Of quaint and crystaline geometries  Perhaps the snow is an enchanted rain Or swarming white and gently to and fro The souls of little birds come back again And searching for the sky they used to know  The snow falls thicker and a spectral night Bursts without sunset in a wind whirled glow Blotting the day and leaving more alight The glistening white nocturne of the snow  The stiff and tangled avenues become Like some vague field of dreams that hides behind   Ben Hecht  A strange and delicate delirium Of labyrinthine pallors swift and blind  The snow seems rising a fantastic spray Some sharp and sinister wind has given wing And all the world is blowing fast away The houses and the trees first vanishing  The world is but a shimmering pastel A whimsically chiseled cameo Whose life seems only the ephemeral And pale diaphonous music of the snow  The snow has ended and the highways lie  In lacquered desolation and outthrown The blue and staring shadow of the sky Appears above the emptied air alone  The night is not so silent as the snow And yet the night is dark and mute and deep The faery stains that wander to and fro Are what the night is dreaming in its sleep  Ben Hecht   POETRY  A Magazine of Verse  VALLEY AND MESA  IRIS  The morning is Sunlight rainlight O morning of blowing rainbows It glistens and sings Like a sea shell Out of cool curling waters  THE FLOWERING ACACIA  Over the bending boughs Of the acacia Falls a shower Of golden light Shining  Like the song of sun rains  OPHELIA ROSES  Out of the dawn  Trembling with moon mist  The glow of a sun gold rose  Wild as a wood bird note  Fragrant as crushed red wine   Lucy Eddy  RED EUCALYPTUS BLOSSOMS  A flame of scarlet Flares in the tree tops It spreads like wild fire And runs crackling over The blue green leaves  THE JACARANDA  The purple breeze Sings through the jacaranda And wings away Leaving the shadows to flower  THE OLIVE TREE  Branches of blowing rain Of gray winding winds Of twilight brooding  BOUGAINVILLEA  Garlands of royal purple Proud regal notes of pageantry Sounding imperial color A fanfare of trumpets Triumphant barbaric Bells and chimes and cymbals Clanging crimson   POETRY  A Magazine of Verse  SEA GARDENS AVALON  Sea wind sea wind Gently go Over the sapphire waters Where anemones glow On the crest of the waves Where the foam flowers blow Soft as light White as snow  Sea wind sea wind Softly sing For the water bells lightly Bubble and ring Where the golden kelp weeds Curl and swing And a flying fish On gauzy wing Whirs

my little sun god Dream of gold and blue Skies that shone with song light Swing their bells of dew Tapping silver music Soft and low for you Listen they are singing Little one dream true  II Hush the brooding wood notes Fainter grow Violet are the vineyards Wine winds blow Purple music hymning Deep and low  THE SINGING SANDS  Over the graying desert Broods the sky Clouds drift sands shift Night winds sigh Through the hush and stillness Silver shadows fly In the sand a foot fall Sings and passes by  Lucy Eddy   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  CHINESE POEMS  THE ORPHAN  To be an orphan To be fated to be an orphan  How bitter is this lot When my father and mother were alive I used to ride in a fine carriage Driving four horses But when my father and mother died My brother and his wife made of me a merchant In the South I travelled to the Nine Rivers And in the East as far as Ch i and Lu At the end of the year when I came home  I dared not tell them what I had suffered Of the lice and vermin in my head Of the dust in my face and eyes My brother told me to get ready the dinner My sister in law told me to see after the horses I was always going up into the hall And running down again to the parlor  My tears fell like a shower of rain  In the morning they sent me to draw water  I didn t get back till night fall  My hands were all sore And I hadn t any shoes  I walked the cold earth Treading on the thorns and brambles   Arthur Waley  As I stopped to pull out the thorns How bitter my heart was My tears fell and fell And I went on sobbing and sobbing In winter I have no great coat Nor in summer thin clothes It is no pleasure to be alive 1 had rather quickly leave this earth And go beneath the Yellow Springs The April winds blow And the grass grows so green In the third month silk worms and mulberries In the sixth month the melon harvest I went out with the melon cart And just as I was coming home The melon cart turned over The people who came to help me were few But the people who ate the melons were many All they left me was the stalks I took them home as fast as I could My brother and sister in law were harsh They asked me all sorts of awful questions Why does every one in the village blame me I want to write a letter and send it To my father and mother under the earth And tell them I can t go on any longer Living with my brother and my sister in law  Anonymous First Century B C   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  FIGHTING AT LUNG TOU  The road that separates me mounts eight thousand feet The river that parts me hangs one hundred fathoms In summer the

Apparition walks slowly away  Max Michelson  POETRY A Magazine of Verse  COMMENT  JOSÉ SANTOS CHOCANO  HERE is a poem of Chocano s which well expresses his conception of the relations between the Old World and the New He calls it a Chronicle of the Reign of Alfonso the Thirteenth  In the middle of the ocean which separates Europe from America two ships are about to cross each other s path at night One flaunts as a figure head the golden lion which is the emblem of León The prow of the other bears the silver castle of Castile Both ships are otherwise alike Their crews hail one another in the same language in the tongue of the country of Utopia the tongue of Spain  On the deck of one stands Dulcinea Cervantes heroine as grave as an ideal wrapped in her Spanish cloak She is bearing to the New World the pure illusion the gentle faith the divine madness of old Spain All its idealism all its enchantment all its dreams are hers  On the deck of the other stands Jimena of the Chronicle of the Cid On her feet are the anklets of the savage in her hand she bears a fan made of the gorgeous plumage of the rarest tropic birds She is bearing from the New World back to the awakening consciousness of Spain the joy of combat the holy wrath the soul of great decisions  But the intrepid Don Rodrigo casts in his lot with the visionary Dulcinea whose soul completes his own and the fantastic Don Quijote fares back to Spain in the company   José Santos Chocano  of Jimena fired with the inspiration of her dauntless courage A stupendous fantasy says Chocano but one that increases through two worlds and through four centuries  The names of two Latin American poets whose works have already become widely known were linked together on the program of a reception given last spring by the Joint Committee of the Literary Arts to distinguished men of letters from Central and South America those of Rubén Darío of Nicaragua and José Santos Chocano of Peru This was right for these men were friends and that was more than a mere metaphor in which Darío once spoke of fixing in the button hole of the younger poet a leaf from his own laurels  These poets have in common their devotion to the cause of poetry but I shall try to emphasize in what respects they differ and how their natures complement each other as in Chocano s poem the warlike soul of Rodrigo finds its completion in the idealism of Cervantes heroine and the divine madness of Don Quijote in the unflinching purpose of Jimena  In the work of Rubén Darío one cannot fail to catch that note of cosmopolitanism combined with a sort of personal aloofness that universality of expression which makes him like so many other poets of high rank the spokesman of no single time or race As Rodó has aptly said of him Rubén Darío is not the poet of America But this distinction cannot be denied to Chocano witness the very titles of his works Alma America and Oro de las Indias the western   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Indies of course are meant suggest immediately the source of his inspiration  I shall try to give my impression of this poet who has already made himself the spokesman of a continent as far as possible in his own words for in more than one of his poems Chocano has sketched his own portrait In Epopeya Salvaje he has described the conflict in his own person of the dreams of a Segismundo the hero of Calderón s Life is a Dream with a passionate attraction towards every manifestation of external power until at last he finds in his Andes because they touch the sky in his plains because they are oceans of verdure in his woods because they are full of mystery and terror an outlet for his emotion And against this stupendous background of his native scenery he places the heroic Incas and the pomp of Spanish viceroys in whom as well as in the lion of the jungle and the condor of the mountain peak he finds his ancestry Yet the dreams of the young Segismundo are not forgotten and from the caverns of his soul in which they dwell he draws an epic of the vast New World  It is this epic quality that predominates increasingly in Chocano s later work until the scope of it enlarges to include not only the inspiring grandeur of natural scenery but all the life that animates the jungle and all the peoples that inhabit the Americas His imagination reaches backward to evoke the forgotten dawns of the creation and forward to anticipate the day of which Bolivar dreamed when the peoples of the Southern Continent shall unite to form like the   José Santos Chocano  Cordillera an unbroken chain from the Caribbean to the Horn In his Isthmus of Panama and in his Hymn of the Future even the great republic of the north is included in this vision and in the latter poem he prophesies the union of a hemisphere  But even more than on these fine epics conceived so broadly and full of so much contagious enthusiasm I think Chocano s fame will rest on certain poems of a more restricted scope but appealing more directly and simply to the heart I mean those poems in which he touches on mysterious contacts between human life and the great natural setting in which it unfolds those which unite the lyric with the epic vein Some of these have a peculiar elemental quality and give one the impression almost of never having been written down by Chocano but rather of having been spoken aloud by him as he rides along on horseback through his forests Other poems give us simple but unforgettable word pictures of some single impression of the life around him the picturesque figure of the gaucho or llanero the cowboy or the plainsman the fragrance of the tropic forest the exuberant loveliness of a flower the horror and fascination of the beast of prey  It is from such poems as these that I have made my translations because I feel that the Pan American fellowship in which we are all so much interested at present is to be achieved not so much by proclaiming it as by feeling it And it is through such poems that we are made to see with the eyes of our southern neighbors   There is sound philosophy in the fantastic conception of the Crónica Alfonsina in the idea that the most perfect union results from a fusion of unlike but complementary natures We of the North and the men of the South must come bearing our best gifts Then we shall meet halfway like the ships in the poem and both crews shall speak the same language though each may bear a different figurehead  Such an understanding can never be the result of mere treaty making or diplomacy It must be built on the solid foundation of mutual respect and sympathy Men of letters can best bring about the consummation of this understanding Could we find better emblems to place side by side on our new Pan American escutcheon than those of Cho cano s poem the golden lion of an undaunted purpose and the silver castle of our dreams John Pierrepont Rice  THE HARD AND THE SOFT IN FRENCH POETRY  I apologize for using these metaphorical terms hard and soft in this essay but after puzzling over the matter for some time I can see no other way of setting about it By hardness I mean a quality which is in poetry nearly always a virtue I can think of no case where it is not By softness I mean an opposite quality which is not always a fault Anyone who dislikes these textural terms may lay the blame on Théophile Gautier who certainly suggests them in Emaux et Camées it is his hardness that I had first   The Hard and the Soft in French Poetry  in mind He exhorts us to cut in hard substance the shell and the Parian  We may take it that Gautier achieved hardness in Emaux et Camées his earlier work did in France very much what remained for the men of the nineties to accomplish in England An examination of what Gautier wrote in the thirties will show a similar beauty a similar sort of technique If the Parnassians were following Gautier they fell short of his merit Heredia is perhaps the best of them He tries to make his individual statements more poetic his whole for all this becomes frigid Samain follows him and begins to go soft there is just a suggestion of muzziness Heredia is hard but there or thereabouts he ends It is perhaps that Gautier is intent on being hard is intent on conveying a certain verity of feeling and he ends by being truly poetic Heredia wants to be poetic and hard the hardness appears to him as a virtue in the poetic And one tends to conclude that all attempts to be poetic in some manner or other defeat their own end whereas an intentness on the quality of the emotion to be conveyed makes for poetry  Another possible corollary is that the subject matter will very nearly make the poem Subject matter will of course not make the poem e g compare Mangan s Kathleen ni Houlihan with Yeats Song that Red Hanrahan made about Ireland where the content is almost identical  On the other hand the man who first decides that certain things are poetry has great advantage over all who follow   him and who accede in his opinion Gautier did decide that certain things were worth making into poems whereas the Parnassians only acceded in other men s opinions about subject matter and accepted Gautier s advice to cut metaphorically in hard stone etc  Gautier is individual and original even in such poems as the Poem of Woman and the Symphony in White Major which seem but variants on old themes I have found what might be a germ of the Symphony in Renaissance Latin and there is an Elizabethan lyric about Swan s down ever Nevertheless Gautier s way of thinking about these things was at bottom his own  His originality is not in his form his hard close cut lines and stanzas Bernard a poet praised by Voltaire and at one time Rameau s librettist wrote French in clear hard little stanzas  J ai vu Daphne Terpsichore légère  Sur un tapis de rose et de fougère  S abandonner à des bonds pleins d appas  Voler languir  This is not from a stanza but it shows Bernard s perfectly orderly method  Gautier writing in opposition to or in rejection of the swash of Hugo DeMusset amp Co came undoubtedly as a contrast but he can scarcely have seemed so different to Frenchmen versed in their own earlier poetry as he does to the English reader coming upon him with slight prelude save English  We have however some hardness in English and in Landor we have a hardness which is not of necessity rugged   The Hard and the Soft in French Poetry  as in Past ruin d Ilion Helen lives Indeed Gautier might well be the logical successor to Landor were he not in all probability the logical co heir with Landor of certain traditions  Landor is from poem to poem extremely uneven Our feeling of him must in part rest on our admiration of his prose Lionel Johnson had a certain hardness and smoothness but was more critic than poet and not a very great poet There is definite statement in George Herbert and likewise in Christina Rossetti but I do not feel that they have much part in this essay I do not feel that their quality is really the quality I am seeking here to define  We have in English a certain gamut of styles we have the good Chaucerian almost the only style in English where softness is tolerable we have the good Elizabethan which is not wholly un Chaucerian and the bad or muzzy Elizabethan and the Miltonic which is a bombastic and rhetorical Elizabethan coming from an attempt to write English with Latin syntax Its other mark is that the rich words have gone i e words like preluciand which have a folk tradition and are in feeling germane to all Europe Leuchend luisant lucente these words are absent in Miltonism and purely pedantic words like irriguous have succeeded them  We have Pope who is really the Elizabethan satiric style more or less born out of Horace and a little improved or at least regularized And we have Landor that is Landor at his best And after that we have isms and eses the pseudo Elizabethanism i e bad Keats and the romantics Swinburnese Browningese neo celticism And how the devil a poet writing English manages to find or make a language for poems is a mystery  It is approximately true or at least it is a formulation worth talking over that French prose is good in proportion as it reaches a sort of norm English prose is good in proportion as a man makes it an individual language one which he alone uses This statement must not be swallowed whole And we must also remember that when Italians were writing excellent and clear prose in the time of Henry VIII Englishmen could scarcely make a clear prose formulation even in documents of state and instructions to envoys so backward were things in this island so rude in prose the language which had been exquisite in the lyrics of Chaucer  French clarity can be talked to death and there are various kinds of French prose the Voltaire Anatole France kind the Stendhal roughness and directness the Flauber tian art and also the soft prose Flaubert and Anatole France are both softer than Voltaire and Stendhal Remy de Gourmont is almost the only writer who seems to me good in a French prose which must I think be called soft It is with him a peculiar and personal medium  If this seem an over long prologue think how little discussion there is of these things Only a few professors and their favorite students seem to have read enough to be able to consider a matter of style with any data at their disposal these and a few poets of the better sort and professors are not paid to spread heresies and bring uncertain   The Hard and the Soft in French Poetry  ties into accepted opinion and poets of the worse sort seem seldom to have any reading So a prologue is needed even for a brief attempt to find out where French verse has got to or where it had arrived a few years ago seeing that since the war faute de combattants no one has had time to go forward or even to continue the work of 1912 1914 since undigested war is no better for poetry than undigested anything else  Since Gautier Corbière has been hard not with a glaze or parian finish but hard like weather bit granite And Heredia and Samain have been hard decreasingly giving gradually smoothness for hardness And Jammes has been soft in his earlier poems with a pleasurable softness And De Regnier seems to verge out of Parnassianism into an undefined sort of poetry Tailhade is hard in his satire  Romains Vildrac Spire Arcos are not hard any one of them though Spire can be acid These men have left the ambitions of Gautier they have done so deliberately or at least they have in the quest of something well worth seeking made a new kind of French poetry I first wrote of Unanimisme in the New Age something over four years ago Romains is the centre of it A recent English essay on the subject trying to point to English Unanimistes is pure rubbish and shows no comprehension on the part of its author Romains unanimisme is a definite theory almost a religion He alone of the better French poets seems to have written at its dictates The rest of the men of his decade have not written to a theory Romains has I think   more intellect than the rest of them and he is an equally notable poet He has tried to make and in places succeeded in making poetry out of crowd psychology Vildrac has been personal and humanitarian Arcos and Spire have delineated Romains portrayal of the collective emotions of a school of little girls out for the day is the most original poem in our generation s French His series of prayers to the God one the god couple the god house the god street and so on is extremely interesting Vildrac s short narrative poems are a progress on the pseudo Maupassant story and have parallels in English Romains has no English parallel Allowing for personal difference I should say that Spire and Arcos write more or less as I do myself I do not mean to make any comparison of merits but this comparison is the easiest or simplest way of telling the general reader what sort of poems they have written  I do not think I have copied their work and they certainly have not copied mine We are contemporary and as sonnets of a certain sort were once written on both sides of the channel so these short poems depicting certain phases of contemporary life are now written on both sides of the channel with of course personal differences  Vildrac has written Auberge and Visite and no doubt these poems will be included in any anthology of the period The thing that puzzles me in attempting to appreciate both Romains and Vildrac is just this question of hardness and a wonder how poetry can get on without it not by any means demanding that it be ubiquitous For I   The Hard and the Soft in French Poetry  do not in the least mean that I want their poems rewritten hard any more than I should want Jammes early poems rewritten hard A critic must spend some of his time asking questions which perhaps no one can answer It is much more his business to stir up curiosity than to insist on acceptances E P  BACK TO CHINA  Literary currents in America often remind one of a switchback road Somebody over here starts something but the trail seems to end get lost in the rocks or the bushes After months or years however it reappears near its source American papers quote the great news as coming from London  For example the Literary Digest of December 29th quotes the London Times on What Chinese Poets can Teach Ours Of course POETRY from its beginning has emphasized the oriental influence and nearly three years ago it printed Mr Pound s translation from Fenollosa s notes of An Exile s Letter by Li Po facts which the Digest forgets to mention Also POETRY from the first has been urging upon occidental poets the qualities for which the Digest now praises the Chinese simplicity immediacy unpretentiousness etc The wonder is why no European poet has ever written thus it exclaims and continues quoting from the Times  The difference seems to be that the Chinese poet hardly knows he is one The great poets of Europe in their themes and their language insist that they are poets what they do is accompanied   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  with a magnificent gesture but the Chinese poet starts talking in the most ordinary language and voice of the most ordinary things and his poetry seems to happen suddenly out of the commonplace as if it were some beautiful action happening in the routine of actual life  How often we have urged the poets to forget the mag  nificent gesture to talk in ordinary language of ordinary  things How persistently we have declined the O thou  and lo and behold kind of poetry the poems on grandil  oquent and remote subjects sprinkled with forsooths erst  whiles eftsoons and all the worn out machinery of rhymed  eloquence  As an admirable reinforcement of principles no modern  poet can afford to neglect we can not do better than quote  like the Digest from the enthusiasic writer in the Times  It is the peculiar art of Chinese poets not to arouse any expectation in us by their method of address European poets have the ambition to make an orchestra out of language but the Chinese seem to play on a penny whistle and then suddenly with a shy smile to draw the most wonderful thin music out of it Any one could do it they seem to say and they convince us that poetry is not a rare and exotic luxury but something that happens in life itself something that one needs only to watch for and record They are passive to this poetry of reality they take it in and then give it out again without insisting that it is their own achievement without wishing us to be impressed with the momentousness of their passions or the depth of their sorrows And for them there is no class of poetic events they are the most utter realists but not on principle or in any reaction from the romantic Nothing is common or unclean to them and they have the innocence of paradise with the sensitiveness of an old and exquisite civilization They have ideas but ideas have not made them blind to things rather they see things more vividly in the light of ideas  Our poets seem often to be looking away out of their own lives into some distance of the past Po Chu i finds all his wonder in his own life it is on the ground he treads and not in the blue far away   Back to China  mountains and it is in the language the images of ordinary life Yet it is never prosaic in the bad sense never subdued to the routine of life or ill natured with mere discontent He and the other Chinese poets do not complain of the world that it is stupid and hostile Their business is to surprise the beauty of the world and to be surprised by it They are like good craftsmen who make lovely things out of objects of use by shaping them not by ornament And there is for them a likeness not a romantic contrast between human life and the beauty of nature  The Times article is an appreciation of Mr Waley s translations of Chinese poems which have been printed in the Little Review and POETRY and issued some of them in a bulletin of the Oxford School of Oriental Studies  A writer in the Smart Set no doubt Mr Mencken is more appreciative than the Times and the Digest of Mr Pound s work in this direction He says  Pound and Eunice Tietjens the former in Lustra and the latter in Profiles from China offer poetical evidence of that belated discovery of the Chinese spirit which has already had its influence in decoration Pound himself gets something of the true Chinese simplicity the Chinese skill at image making the Chinese dignity and delicacy into his transcriptions And Mrs Tietjens though she never drops the Caucasian robe nor even that of the frank tourist yet gives us a glimpse of the unfathomable romance and mystery of old China in her disorderly pieces Both poets war upon the commonplace the obvious the stale  Anyone who has been long enough in China to note in the national mind and attitude toward life a certain combination of whimsicality and exquisiteness begins to suspect that every Chinese writes poetry that but for the barrier of language one s head boy or one s neighbor s cook would stand revealed as a lyrist of thrush like purity Perhaps however this hope might be disappointed for today is not as the past in China But in the poetry of the great dynasties there   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  must be that same quality of ineffable beauty which is found in paintings sculptures potteries from Chou to Sung nay even in the Temple of Heaven of the Manchu conquerors of Peking This quality goes far to cheapen all occidental art whom did it not strike with divine despair during the recent exhibition at the Chicago Art Institute of Chinese masterpieces of the great ages chosen by Charles L Freer of Detroit that generous servant of beauty from the wonderful collection which he is making for the people of the United States Alas that Durer and Michel Angelo could not have wandered there H M  REVIEWS  ANTHOLOGIES AND TRANSLATIONS  Others An Anthology of the New Verse edited by Alfred  Kreymborg Alfred A Knopf  A new Others anthology This time the editor has not limited his choice as in the 1916 compilation to material which first appeared in the magazine Others but has drawn from several periodicals including The Masses The Egoist The Little Review and four of the poetry magazines There is also another change of policy fewer poets are represented so that each one may have more space The first anthology had thirty five names this one has seventeen five women Mary Carolyn Davies Jeanne D Orge Helen Hoyt Mina Loy Marianne Moore and twelve men 1 Messrs Arensburg Bodenheim Cannell Eliot Johns Kreymborg O Neil Rodker Sanborn Sandburg Stevens   and Williams The only name new to Others is David O Neil  You do not expect friends to change in a little over a year and a half Mr Bodenheim Mr Cannell Miss Davies have the same flavors to be tasted as before Mr Sanborn has become less interesting Orrick Johns offers new Songs of Deliverance but they lack some of the aplomb of the earlier ones and nothing could quite take the place of his Olives in the first anthology T S Eliot pictures the moods of dingy furnished rooms with smells of steak in passage ways instead of the Boston Evening Transcript elegance one might look for And Mina Loy has strangely turned understandable and less fragmentary though still scorning the use of punctuation marks  We are glad Marianne Moore s There is a great amount of poetry in unconscious fastidiousness was included in this book It is a fascinating thing and unlike anyone but Marianne Moore as all her poems are But some of her pieces are too compact and keen too fastidious for comfort Jeanne D Orge also is distinct never echoes and while seemingly at opposite poles in temperament and style from Marianne Moore these two have in common a satirical power and humor in which Mina Loy also shares  From the editor himself several new poems appear as fine as any he has written Berceuse Ariettes is a picture of honeymoon housekeeping most charming From the Williams group a reader of the magazine misses that sharply etched and delighting Portrait of a Lady in Bed and also the   Persian Cat The lady in bed and the Persian cat behaved as nature rather than the convenience of society dictated and perhaps success is making Others proper success often does that  Wallace Stevens shows variety of interest and manner and originality in experiment The poem about Saint Ursula and the one called Explanation are less sure in touch than the others There is not much of the new poetry that mouths well but this The Worms at Heaven s Gate is rich on the tongue  Out of the tomb we bring Badroulbadour Within our bellies we her chariot Here is an eye and here are one by one The lashes of that eye and its white lid Here is the cheek on which that lid declined And finger after finger here the hand The genius of that cheek Here are the lips The bundle of the body and the feet Out of the tomb we bring Badroubadour  Walter Conrad Arensburg who told us in the last anthology of the swan existing has abandoned we surmise his Voyage à l Infini for a voyage in the fourth dimension Here follows the Arithmetical Progression of the Verb To Be  On a sheet of paper dropped with the intention of demolishing space by the simple subtraction of a necessary plane  Draw a line that leaves the present in addition carrying forward to the uncounted columns  of the spatial ruins now considered as complete the remainder of the past   Anthologies and Translations  The act of disappearing which in the three dimensional is the fate of the convergent  vista is thus under the form of the immediate  arrested in a perfect parallel of being in part  This is the most intelligible of the poems by Mr Arens burg and therefore a good one to begin on I believe I have arrived at an understanding of it and if some other reader gets any one of the other five I shall be glad to exchange assistance Often it is only necessary to be given the clue to a seemingly unintelligible poem for it to assume immediately full meaning Such a poem is the one in this book by Carl Sandburg entitled Others Fantasia for Muskmelon Days  Ivory domes white wings beating in empty space   Nothing doing nuts bugs a regular absolute humpty dumpty business pos i tive ly falling off walls and no use to call doctor lawyer priest no use boy no use  O Pal of Mine O Humpty Dumpty shake hands with me  O Ivory Domes I am one of You Let me in For God s sake let me in  This was the answer to an invitation There was to be a gathering of the contributors to Others in the summer of 1916 in the muskmelon days and the jovial Carl s acceptance was the above fantasia A regular absolute humpty dumpty business expresses well the general verdict at that time on the Others magazine and group but   those who shook their heads are now growing used to the new verse and they will feel less bewildered with this volume than with the first one David O Neil s delicate carvings John Rodker s picture of the lovers playing with the croquet ball in the garden and his Spring Suicide and many more of the poems are directly enough in line with the accepted traditions for anyone to like them who has come into sympathy with the new verse at all That the whole book will be a treasury for those who admire the Ivory Domes may be assured H H  The Answering Voice One Hundred Love Lyrics by  Women selected by Sara Teasdale Houghton Mifflin  Co  Those who will receive this book the most eagerly are feminists and lovers The feminist may find that she is disappointed or rather that she cannot quite tell whether she is disappointed or not Surely the poems are of fine quality for the whole sex to take pride in what did she expect of a collection of love poems by women and may the lack of what is missing be charged against the editor or against woman herself It is still too early in woman s dawning day of expression for many questions to be answered Neither of herself nor of love does she tell us in this book anything that we could not have learned in a book of love poems by men A larger amount of material or material of greater variety might have let her tell more  The editor s definition of lyric is narrower perhaps than poems are usually measured to The volume is made up   Anthologies and Translations  almost exclusively of pieces regular in form There are only two or three in free verse although good love poems have been written in that mood And always the poems are delicate in mood as well as texture although woman is not always delicate There are no poems of rebellion against love against the hampering it works or against its compulsion Love is a Terrible Thing may be excepted but here too the expression is almost too dainty There is one poem taunting a man with his unworthiness to be loved but never any mood of arraignment toward love or toward man in general The book is perfectly entitled and perhaps the title in its turn put constraint upon the selection of content One regrets that none of the compiler s own songs are included H H  Poems of Heinrich Heine Selected and Translated by Louis  Untermeyer Henry Holt amp Co  Mr Untermeyer s selection does justice to Heine s range the translation itself may be fairly tested by  First Ich kam von meiner Herrin Haus from Die Traumbilder This is Heine s Spoon River bit It has a romantic glamour adequate to ghosts who gibber woeful tales a compelling atmosphere of a lyric graveyard The tales lose their horror and hence the poetry its shiver in this translation Lack of space forbids a verbal parallel of the two versions  Second Die Nordsee a strenuous test of any translator invites several comparisons which cannot be made in a brief review Mr Untermeyer s interpretation of this sea poem   makes one wish he had keener insight into the many subtle identities between German and English The two languages have too many root intergrowths to justify that is if a translation is to retain the essence of the original Mr Untermeyer s too free rendering of a poem which is at once the one high wrought piece of Heine and the sure proof of his small command of really great poetry  The third type of lyric the patriotic will illustrate how this too free rendering of the German not only does not make for vigor in English it totally mispresents Heine s meaning To illustrate the translator s method here is one stanza of Germany a poem which should be quoted entire as it is a sinister prophecy though the poet may have been unaware of it  Germany s still a little child The sun s her nurse she ll feed him No soothing milk to make him strong But the wild fires of freedom  This is the German of the third and fourth verses  Sie sàugt es nicht mit stiller Milch Sie sàugt es mit wilder Flamme  Poem after poem might be shown turned in this way from its real meaning by a too loose rendering A translator should translate  One wishes that Mr Untermeyer had given instead of all these poems a searching criticism of Heine Heine is  a force in poetry of a certain kind None knew better than he how to distil the verse of others into his own No poet better demonstrates the evil of being too facile This is    why in reading Heine entire one comes to care for his prose more than for his poetry Much of his poetry translates well into prose and as a translator Heine himself is a success His Byron pieces in German are better than Byron There is in Heine too an American interest which as yet has not been fully noted Heine was not only read by American poets at the time when many of them were flowering in the thirties forties and fifties he was absorbed by them This was the period when German was the second tongue of educated Americans and it was Heine s ready verse his Liebkosen sentiment easily read easily adopted with which they weakened their own poetry Mr Untermeyer s introduction is a start for a real controversy as to Heine s worth as a poet There are many reasons why he is not a great poet his lyric sweetness is too often only sweetish and his lyric cry is never anything but a personal hurt or at best only what he himself called his Westostliche Spleen  Ellen Fitzgerald    STRAINS OF YESTERDAY  Glad of Earth by Clement Wood Laurence Gomme Main Street and Other Poems by Joyce Kilmer George  H Doran Co  With the War has come to all the want sudden where it did not exist before emphatic where it did of intenser realization of life and the problems and aspirations that are Mr Wood s themes on which he plays with insufficient or unconvincing mastery and the fancies and sentiments Mr Kilmer has chosen to sing with a simplicity of style that almost exasperates seem pale by the light of what have become common hopes and fears There is little peace even in Main Street and to quarrel with Social Doctors and to slap mayors vigorously on the back seem unworthy futile things to do The world is out of tune with songs that yesterday might have charmed or quickened it The pity of these books is chiefly that they were born beyond their time Magic potency they have none to cheat this nightmare present their virtue is rather one that requires whole heartedness on the part of the reader to become effectual and the reader s heart is out of him and over there But of both poets the critic faculty may observe that their utterance at its best Mr Wood s in New Roads and Mr Kilmer s in The Proud Poet does possess a past of experience and a future of power  Mr Kilmer is already at the front in Flanders or in France although he has a growing family he was one of the first to volunteer That gesture is worthy many a volume and to such a poet the experience of war cannot but prove ennobling and enriching W e pray as for victory that he may return to us having tasted in the sleep between battles the milk of Paradise As for Mr Wood we know his lyric restlessness and do not imagine him asleep over the laurels the city of Newark grew for him but fully awake to the spectacle of these tremendous years rising to the full measure of his day  Salomon de la Selva   OUR CONTEMPORARIES  ACADEMIC BACK WATER  The difficulty of getting progressive work done through academic channels is illustrated by a recent episode at the University of Chicago  A year ago some patron of generous intentions presented a fund for the securing of lectures from leaders of thought outside the institution the fund yielding an income of about 1 500 a year By way of further distinguishing the endowment and of honoring at the same time the memory of a poet whose work had honored the university the faculty entitled the course the William Vaughn Moody Memorial Lectures  This title seemed to give the projected lectures a slant toward modern poetry and the more progressive members of the English department including a high hearted Poetry Club of students felt confident that now at last the art which Mr Moody followed would be fitly recognized in the person of one or more distinguished living poets of America or England  Apparently however no one especially interested in modern poetry has been allowed any voice in the selection of lecturers A committee consisting of the head professors of Greek and of history and an associate professor of English affronted Mr Moody s memory by inviting Alfred Noyes to give the initial lecture The result was what might have been expected as one of the professors of English remarked the next day to his class the lecture was a marvellous exhi   bition of what a man of some reputation can do to an unoffending audience and get away with it  The second leader of thought chosen to enlighten the university and absorb some of the 1 500 was the humorist Stephen Leacock who sadly upset at least one member of the committee by ruling the classics out of court By way of reprisal for this sacrilegious act the third lecturer invited by the learned committee was that safe and sane upholder of all formulas Paul Elmer More  That was last season s record the best that a great university could do with its chance to enlighten or stir up its students and the community This year the committee s utmost has been to engage another English poet Mr Gibson an advance over Mr Noyes and Wm Lyon Phelps hardly an advance over Mr More  Meantime the students are up in arms One of them writes in the Maroon  That there is a widespread interest in poetry among the students cannot be questioned in view of the prize contest recently conducted by the Poetry Club This is not an interest in anachronistic Victorians nor conservative critics but an interest in modern poetry which demands the assistance and inspiration which only representative modernists can supply  The Poetry Club under the handicap of a lack of funds is attempting to bring a few representative poets before university audiences and may perhaps succeed in a very limited degree but in the meantime who can wonder if we protest against an unpardonable waste of a memorial fund in a manner which many of us cannot help feeling is a desecration  H M   NOTES  Señor Jose Santos Chocano the Peruvian poet is sufficiently introduced in the article by his
