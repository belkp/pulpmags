But this lute voice mocking the centuries In many a silvery phrase that hallowed is By love not faltering with lengthening days A lute that I have little worth to raise And little skill to sound yet not amiss Your love may find it since my heart in this Only one thing for your heart only says  These are no perfect blossoms I offer you No rose whose crimson cup all longing slakes Not moonflowers sunflowers flowers rich of hue   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Nor silver lilies mystical with dew No more than bluets blown when April takes Millions of them to make one meadow blue  I  I have been happy let the falcon fly And follow swiftly where the light wings whir Let him bring down the reckless wanderer Snatch back that eager rapture from the sky And I have been contented let me cry My discontent until like reeds astir Before the swift the tragic whisperer Broken are these frail dreams that satisfy  I have known laughter make me blind with tears I have loved silence make me deaf with sound For every joy set vengeful grief above I will not shrink before the threatening years I will not falter I will not give ground And I will love as you would have me love  II  I have a thousand pictures of the sea Snatches of song and things that travellers say I know its shimmering from green to gray At dawn and sunset it is plain to me Like something known and loved for years will be   Muna Lee  That sight of it when I shall come some day Where little waves and great waves war and play And little winds and great winds fly out free  Of love I had no pictures love would come Like any casual guest whom I could greet Serenely and serenely let depart Love that came like fire and struck me dumb That came like wind and swept me from my feet That came like lightning shattering my heart  III  Life of itself will be cruel and hard enough There will be loss and pain enough to bear Battles to wage sorrow and tears to share We must know grief the bitter taste thereof Must mark the Shadow towering above Must shut our eyes to gain the strength to dare And force tired hearts to face the noise and glare Though it is dusk and silence that we love  Life has no need of stones that we might heap To build up walls between no need of tears That we seek out and proudly make our own O my beloved since we have alone These brief hours granted from the hurrying years Be patient life itself will make us weep   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  IV  There have been many Junes with larkspur blowing Many Octobers with crimson berried haws When from my heart regret like smoke withdraws Wreath after wreath to watch the sunsets glowing And see tall poplars make so brave a showing Against pale skies at dusk There were no flaws To mar the summer for me never pause In my delight for winds and waters flowing  Yet was all beauty beauty uncompleted Vaguely perceived not truly heard and seen Or seen as are the hills with mist between Or heard as song thin echoes have repeated Until you gave earth meaning giving me The love that lifts the heart to hear and see  v  You have not known the autumns I have known November for you has bloomed as bright as spring With tropic suns to glow and birds to sing And flowers more vivid than mine in August blown You have made beside those autumns half your own That come with ice and sleet and wind to sting The blood itself to ruddy blossoming Such autumns as the bleak North knows alone   Muna Lee  My autumns are merely quiet and they show Straight trees that are bared alike of leaves and snow Yet it is only thus you can know the trees Love proud enough to forego bloom and song To strip the boughs of foliage bare and strong To bide your judgment would be most like these  VI  It would be easy to say The moon and lake Made wizardry how could we see aright That was a world unreal in silver light And we were lovers for the moment s sake It was youth spoke in us quick to mistake Earth lamp for dawn the mirage for true sight Hailing a hill crest as the long sought height Swearing such oaths as honors us to break  That would be easiest then no regret  Could chill a heart grown happy to forget Nor touch a soul that sophistry sufficed There was a man once in a hall of trial  Thrice before cock crow uttered such denial  And knows forever that he denied the Christ  VII  I make no question of your right to go Rain and swift lightning thunder and the sea   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Sand and dust and ashes are less free Follow all paths that wings and spread sails know Unheralded you came and even so If so you will may you take leave of me Yours is your life and what you will shall be I ask no question hasten or be slow  But I who would not hold you I who give Your freedom to you with no word to say And watching quietly with my prayers all dumb Speed you to any life you choose to live Shall ask God s self incredulous some day Why in the name of Christ He let you come  VIII  No love can quite forego the battle field Since life is struggle and love and life are one No soul is quiet and sheltered enough to shun The tireless foes at work to make love yield Not flowers and samite but lance and shield Were dower of love not wreath but gonfalon And while the bitter struggle is unwon Not even to faith is all the truth revealed  Each heart its own most dreaded foe must meet Each heart its own conspiracies must lay And fight what it finds hardest to defeat Mine is it to meet Doubt in serried mass   Muna Lee  Stronger and subtler with each toilsome day Yet steel my soul to swear They shall not pass  IX  It will be easy to love you when I am dead Shadowed from light and shut away from sound Held deeper than the wild roots underground Where nothing can be changed and no more said All will be uttered then beyond the dread Of failure in you or me I shall have found Most perfect quietness to fold me round Where I can dream while all Time s years are sped  But now Life roars about me like a sea Sears me like flame is thunder in my ears There is no time for song no space for tears And every vision has forsaken me In a world earthquake shaken lightning charred Love is the hardest where all things are hard  Muna Lee   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  AT NIGHT  THE SLEEPER  Night O heavy breather in the surf of sleep What is that strange and rosy slenderness You hold against your heart with so much tenderness  The Sleeper It is my wife I hold I love her more than life She has hair of bronze and gold And in twin strands divides it It lies across her bosom surplice wise This I know to be true though darkness hides it  Night Now all things false dissolve beneath the moon This is a sheaf of whispering dreams you hold Bound by the tawny sinews of your arm They nod together with plumes of bronze and gold They breathe and are warm They speak together in a sibilant tune  The Sleeper It is my own wife Her mouth that is merry and wise Is shut and the lids are shut that cover Her faithful eyes  Night A sheaf of dreams hush  The First Bream She is untrue Brother and brother This one is new Where is the other   Jessica Nelson North  The Second Dream I hear men say He had ceased to love her Even today His voice can move her The Third Dream I have seen her tremble When she meets his eyes She is deft with lies She is quick to dissemble The Fourth Dream How is this done Brother and brother To sleep with one  And dream of another  Night A sheaf of dreams of dreams The Sleeper My wife My wife  FIRST AUTUMN  All in our pearl pale window The moon s aroma hung  My love and I together Our heads upon one pillow Looked out where an elm upflung A branch like a peacock feather  Heigho first autumn weather   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  DREAMS  You curve your body into a vibrant ball Dead drunk with sleep I have no part in your slumber scheme at all I cannot strike that deep  You hold me insecurely in your life As a sand dune holds trees I say It is five months I am your wife What shadow facts are these  I put my hand into your breast It lies Unowned apart While more familiar hands and lips and eyes Press close around your heart  SUDDENLY  We have a gray room The walls are gray and bare I have hung pictures and set flowers there I have made curtains with wide and snowy hem For our tiny windows to make the best of them  You look at me Your look is still and gray Your look is cool and dim and far away I cannot open the stubborn husks that shut Your heart away like the kernel in a nut   Jessica Nelson North  I am afraid of what is in your heart I must probe deep I must tear your mood apart Suddenly like a rocket unaware Your eyes blossom and flare  BOGIE  The black rain settles in our empty block The drunken street lamps leer with sidelong eyes Dim and unholy Old newspapers grown restless in the gutter With flap and flutter Rise and subside and rise It is half past twelve o clock The night goes slowly  I am awake again I cannot sleep I light the lamp again and draw the shutter I light the lamp against the feet that creep The sounds that mutter I draw the shutter against the lids that peep  Something goes crouching at the dripping flank Of the broken wall Something in tatters slips Down alleys dank Something from door to door before the rain Dodges and whines Something with twisting lips Terribly smiles outside my shuttered pane   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  BOATMAN  Boatman leaning on your pole on the Secret River Will you tarry for a soul who never knew a lover She is very young and cold her beauty makes me shiver I will give you coins of gold to take her softly over  TO THE MAN WHO LOVES TWILIGHT  Why do you go along the street caressing with quiet eyes Gray walls bleak houses and the dull wet skies Have all things gray your blessing  We do not love your twilight God and I He pelts the rainy heaven With gorgeous autumn hangs the dripping trees With yellow apples of Hesperides In lines Sweetly uneven  Loops every sodden fence with scarlet vines  And where you sit Sufficient to yourself hugging the gloom I prance with rustling silk and candles lit To make an orgy in our quiet room  Jessica Nelson North   YOUR HANDS  Hands your hands quite calm now At the day s end You are not delicately molded not exquisite Not gentle always  You are scarred With broken lines Sultry lines of passion There are grotesques in you Like forests after fire  You hold valleys of renunciation And crags shaken by the storm That only faiths like wild goats know  Yet now rises within that dark repose Beauty as she comes hooded at twilight  Ah do not touch me yet  FROM THE TELEPHONE  Out of the dark cup Your voice broke like a flower It trembled swaying on its taut stem The caress in its touch Made my eyes close  Florence Ripley Mastin   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  BEGINNING AND END  ELDERS  At night the moon shakes the bright dice of the water And the elders their flower light as broken snow upon the bush  Repeat the circle of the moon  Within the month Black fruit breaks from the white flower The black wheeled berries turn Weighing the boughs over the road There is no harvest Heavy to withering the black wheels bend Ripe for the mouths of chance lovers Or birds Twigs show again in the quick cleavage of season and season The elders sag over the powdery road bank As though they bore and it were too much The seed of the year beyond the year  RESOLVE  So that I shall no longer tarnish with my fingers The bright steel of your power   Louise Bogan  I shall be hardened against you A shield tightened upon its rim  A stern oval to be pierced by no weapon Metal stretched and shaped against you For a long time I shall go Spanned by the round of my strength  Changeless in spite of change My resolve undefeated Though now I see the evening moon soon to wane Stand clearly and alone in the early dark Above the stirring spindles of the leaves  KNOWLEDGE  Now that I know That passion warms little Of flesh in the mold And treasure is brittle  I ll lie here and learn How over their ground Trees make a long shadow And a light sound   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  LEAVE TAKING  I do not know where either of us can turn Just at first waking from the sleep of each other I do not know how we can bear The river struck by the gold plummet of the moon Or many trees shaken together in the darkness We shall wish not to be alone And that love were not dispersed and set free Though you defeat me And I be heavy upon you  But like earth heaped over the heart Is love grown perfect Like a shell over the beat of life Is love perfect to the last So let it be the same Whether we turn to the dark or to the kiss of another Let us know this for leavetaking That I may not be heavy upon you That you may blind me no more  TO A DEAD LOVER  The dark is thrown Back from the brightness like hair Cast over a shoulder I am alone   Louise Bogan  Four years older Like the chairs and the walls Which I once watched brighten With you beside me I was to waken Never like this whatever came or was taken  The stalk grows the year beats on the wind Apples come and the month for their fall The bark spreads the roots tighten Though today be the last Or tomorrow all You will not mind  That I may not remember Does not matter I shall not be with you again What we knew even now Must scatter And be ruined and blow Like dust in the rain  You have been dead a long season And have less than desire Who were lover with lover And I have life that old reason To wait for what comes To leave what is over  Louise Bogan   POETRY A Magazine of

Enjoy the day at sunset For willow winds are not cold Apricot rains are not wet  SEEKING THE HERMIT IN VAIN  By Gia Dao Tang Dynasty  Gone to gather herbs So they say of you But in cloud girt hills What am I to do  ON BEING DENIED ADMITTANCE TO A FRIEND S GARDEN  By Yeh Shih Sung Dynasty  Although your gate bar my way You cannot check the spring s play For free above your proud wall There hangs one apricot spray   Louise S Hammond  THE SUDDEN COMING OF SPRING  By Cheng Hao Sung Dynasty  Scant clouds just flake the noon sky By willowed streamlets stroll I But men know not my heart s joy And say Old fool the hours fly  NIGHT TIME IN SPRING  By Wang An Shih Sung Dynasty  Silence reigns where sound has been Chill the breeze half soft half keen While the moon through sleepless hours Shifts dark blossoms up the screen  Translated by Louise S Hammond    POETRY A Magazine of Verse  SUMMER PHASES  THE SPREE  In the uplift of spring Earth had high thoughts in trees Smiling her apple blossoms Blushing her peach petals Delicate as a sprite  Now she sprawls Making loose gestures with spreading vines Guffawing vegetables and fruits Harlequin melons Punchinello squashes Hiccoughing cucumbers stuttering tomatoes She is mad drunk with summer  Soon she ll lie still Decently covered with the leaf brown quilt She ll give loud gusty yawns then sleep Jeered at by rains pitied by snow And wake to chastened stiff sobriety  TRANSIT  The purple shadow clings with desperate will Tightly to the granite hill Tries to grow to it I try beloved dear   Katherine Wisner McCluskey  To carve me out one solid moment here Afraid of cruel winds to blow Winds implacable that know Shadows go  Winds strip shadows off from hills Signalled by cloudy change above An instant s whim and death may harry love Should it sever you from me I drift I drift Agnostic of reality  A PARABLE  The magnolia bud Loosens her white garments With exquisite reserve So love unfolds While delicate mysteries Like odors Subtly escape  The white magnolia Of lucent petals Textured like woman skin Crumples to leather Limp and brown Binding a story told   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  WHOLLY HAPPY  This is the Sabbath Day I keep it my own way I do not need to go to church to pray  Feeling and being me Is good as good can be I claim my own identity  I am as happy as a flower Perfuming its one hour With a sweet sense of power  I am unfettered as a bee That cleaves a tiny path but free Choosing an orange blossoming tree  Making my honey as it does I feel as holy as saint ever was This is my perfume prayer and buzz  Katherine Wisner McCluskey   TALK FROM THE DUST  THE SKY  I saw a shadow on the ground And heard a bluejay going by A shadow went across the ground And I looked up and saw the sky  It hung up on the poplar tree But while I looked it did not stay It gave a tiny sort of jerk And moved a little bit away  And farther on and farther on It moved and never seemed to stop I think it must be tied with chains And something pulls it from the top  It never has come down again And every time I look to see The sky is always slipping back And getting far away from me  NUMBERS  When I can count the numbers far And know all the figures that there are   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Then I ll know everything and I Can know about the ground and the sky  And all the little bugs I see And I ll count the leaves on the poplar tree And all the days that ever can be  I ll know all the cows and sheep that pass And I ll know all the grass  And all the places far away And I ll know everything some day  AUTUMN  Dick and Will and Charles and I Were playing it was election day And I was running for president And Dick was a band that was going to play  And Charles and Will were a street parade But Clarence came and said that he Was going to run for president And I could run for school trustee  He made some flags for Charles and Will And a badge to go on Dickie s coat He stood some cornstalks by the fence And had them for the men that vote   Elizabeth Madox Roberts  Then he climbed on a box and made a speech To the cornstalk men that were in a row It was all about the Dem o crats And I de fy any man to show  And I de fy any man to say And all about It s a big disgrace He spoke his speech out very loud And shook his fist in a cornstalk s face  THE PEOPLE  The ants are walking under the ground And the pigeons are flying over the steeple And in between are the people  A BEAUTIFUL LADY  We like to listen to her dress It makes a whisper by her feet Her little pointed shoes are gray She hardly lets them touch the street  Sometimes she has a crumpled fan Her hat is silvered on the crown And there are roses by the brim That nod and tremble up and down   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  She comes along the pavement walk And in a moment she is gone She hardly ever looks at us But once she smiled and looked at John  And so we run to see her pass And watch her through the fence and I Can hear the others whispering Miss Josephine is going by  AUGUST NIGHT  We had to wait for the heat to pass And I was lying on the grass  While Mother sat outside the door And I saw how many stars there were  Beyond the tree beyond the air And more and more were always there  So many that I think they must Be sprinkled on the sky like dust  A dust is coming through the sky And I felt myself begin to cry  So many of them and so small Suppose I cannot know them all  Elizabeth Madox Roberts   SONG NETS  Song nets I weave you with all my love You glitter like pearls and rubies In you I catch songs like butterflies You go past my reaching hand With a thin gauzy floating And the songs are caught Before they fade away Last night My hand caught a song Of pines and quiet rivers I shall keep it forever  SNOW MORNING  Morning is a picture again With snow puffed branches Out of the wind With the sky caught like a blue feather In the butternut tree I cannot see the world behind the snow But when I look into my mind There with all its people and colors The world sits smiling Quite warm and cosy   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  WHAT I SAID  Lilies of the valley Bell shaped moments clustered Doves of time little white doves Through the dusky sunset colored air Set free I stroke your wings I stroke your folded wings  LITTLE GREEN BERMUDA POEM  Green water of waves On the Bermuda beaches White coral roads running away Pink shells waiting for me to come  I shall come some day  How would it sound to be there alone And hear the Atlantic Ocean Crash on bright rocks  This island is a great rainbow That lasts forever People go and come And the waves forget them I see the island turn and turn A soap bubble with rainbows drifting down A rainbow ball turning Always light always glitter looking through   Hilda Conkling  My poem that began with a green wave Has broken into colors  WHEN MOONLIGHT FALLS  When moonlight falls on the water It is like fingers touching the chords of a harp On a misty day When moonlight strikes the water I cannot get it into my poem I only hear the tinkle of ripplings of light When I see the water s fingers and the moon s rays Intertwined I think of all the words I love to hear And try to find words white enough For such shining  ELSA  My sister stood on a hilltop Looking toward the sea The wind was in her bronze colored hair She was an image On a broken wave Foam was at her feet So for a moment she wavered And was lovely And I remember her   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  CLOUDY PANSY  Wandering down a dusty road I met a gypsy She might have dropped out of the trees She had a green kerchief And a blue velvet skirt A lavender cape And a gold locket Green shoes on the feet That trod the powdery road To the marble floored Vermont river Thinking as it goes along  FIELD MOUSE  Little brown field mouse Hiding when the plough goes by Timid creature that you are Wild thing Were you once in the forest Did you move to the fields In your brown cloak You gather grain For your secret meals You will build a house of earth The way you remember From a baby up to your full grown feeling   Hilda Conkling  You have run about the field As other field mice will run about When another century has come Like a cloud  I WONDERED AND WONDERED  I wondered and wondered I saw a comrade of mine It was a wave smooth and blue That tossed fell away I wondered and wondered I saw a mountain white with old age I could not remember How I came there I wondered and wondered Under a motherly sky That knew my name and kind That rested my tired thoughts That said I have a rainbow for you Hilda And a young moon hidden  Hilda Conkling  POETRY A Magazine of Verse  COMMENT  NATURE THE SOURCE  OW can one pause for thought or dreams when midsummer beckons from stream and hill There are days when the sheer beauty of the sky is enough to prove the fourth dimension or the doctrine of relativity when the lapping of lake water washes away not only human sins but human theories The ecstasy of mere existence on such days may thrill even paltry souls and those who are keen winged for joy rise to intuition of the infinite  Whistler discussing the relation of nature to art in Ten O clock says Nature is very rarely right thereby hammering down a truth with a paradox But he also says Nature contains the elements in color and form of all pictures as the keyboard contains the notes of all music elements from which the artist is born to pick and choose and group with science that the result may be beautiful The artist can not take nature ready made he must re create with his own imagination and re inspire with his own breath But nature is his source and starting point and back to nature he must go for truth and beauty in the large  And nature seems sometimes to capture the special graces of art She composes a field with a tree and cloud she patterns foamy waves along a strip of beach she lets fall a cataract in a mountain cleft she builds the Grand Canyon she drives a naked colt across a meadow she   Nature the Source  makes a girl move like a goddess all with an adroit regard for rightness with that studious care for mass and balance and proportion which art proclaims in masterpieces The artist must go to nature for hints of Tightness for the thrill of ineffable recognitions by which he knows immortal beauty has bespoken him  I recall an hour in Rodin s studio when the great sculptor showed me some of the countless outline drawings in which it was his habit to catch on the wing as it were the swift unconscious attitudes of his models as they moved about the room I remember his almost breathless reverence for liberal nature and her marvellous gifts and his modest deprecation of himself of his own share in his art And Hokusai at ninety or more died learning  Poets especially must derive the breath of life from nature only thus may they escape sophistication and find perpetual renewal They cannot escape her influence consciously or unconsciously they work out what she has taught them Do we not find Greece in Homer the Greek landscape and its complete and happy union with Greek life Is it not Italy that we discover in Dante and merry England Elizabethan England wilder than Victorian in Shakespeare And today while the Georgian poets are repeating over and over rather monotonously their enchantment with English rural life do we not hear a larger story from the Americans  Our poets are becoming aware of their continental heritage Reading them one begins to feel nature s great   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  scale her wide spaces her inexhaustible variety in these forty eight big states compacted into a single nation A country larger freer wilder than the little England whose tongue they speak is asserting its power and scope in the songs they sing  It may be that the hope of American art its one advantage at least over European lies in that love of the wilderness which we inherit from the pioneers We are nearer to wild nature than the crowded old world peoples and we still throw off more easily the husks of civilization to build a campfire under the stars Recently two young poets both almost penniless have hiked westward through this office carrying their blanket rolls sleeping where they fell after the day s fatigue trusting to luck for a chance job and meals tasting of freedom feeling wide spaces underfoot wide winds overhead Let us hope there are few poets so fixed in urban or rural habits that they can not throw them all off for a summer month or more take a deep plunge into the wilderness and challenge nature for renewal of life H M  ON TRANSLATING CHINESE POETRY  I  In the midst of the little whirlpool caused in affairs poetic by the recent translations of Chinese classical poetry Waley s Lowell s and Bynner s I should like to raise a small voice of caution   On Translating Chinese Poetry  Do not because this poetry as it comes to us is so simple and direct as almost to seem like folk poetry be deceived into thinking that you therefore understand the Chinese Nothing would be more natural yet to me it seems that few things could be more erroneous  For the apparent simplicity of these poems is the result of a complexity so great as to be far beyond anything the West has ever produced Such a poet as T S Eliot in our own day is still much too unsophisticated to have written a T ang poem Far from being folk poetry it was written by the emperors and scholars much as Latin verse was written in the middle ages of Europe by the scribes and rulers The intricacies of its prosody are endless So full is it of plays on words of classical allusions of double meanings that even today one of the favorite pastimes of Chinese scholars of the old school is the endless and friendly discussion of the fine points of these poems Under the old system the entire education of the young consisted in teaching the children to understand them and now that education has turned in a different direction it is I think safe to say that in a few generations there will remain in China only a handful of men able to appreciate them fully  The very Chinese language in which they are written which used once to be thought more primitive than ours because it is not inflected that is the tenses of the verbs the parts of speech etc are not differentiated is now thought by philologists to have gone through our inflected   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  stage almost before the dawn of history So that our method of speech became too simple for the Chinese thousands of years ago and their language went on around the circle to the point where it is found today in which root ideas only are used and the rest is left to the imagination The effect on a westerner is as though they were always cabling at so much per word  There are properly speaking two Chinese languages now the written language and the spoken language The written language is as much more complicated than the other as the most difficult legal phraseology in English is more difficult than ordinary speech Not only can an uneducated Chinese neither read nor write the written language he cannot even understand it without explanation when it is read to him that is when the syllables are spoken aloud This has proved very difficult for the missionaries who in translating the Bible have therefore felt obliged to make two separate versions one which I am told is very bad in the written language and one in what is called the spoken language written down  The written language has over forty thousand different ideographs yet there exist only about four hundred word sounds Each of these words is a monosyllable polysyllabic words being unknown Theoretically therefore each word sound has a hundred different meanings In practice of course this is not so as the vocabulary of the common people contains very few words and even a scholar hardly reads more than eight or nine thousand   On Translating Chinese Poetry  characters Yet the humblest peasant knows probably half a dozen meanings for li or a mysterious unpronounc able syllable that sounds likeHsu and is everywhere much in evidence In common speech the Chinese get around this difficulty in a number of ways for instance by putting two syllables which have approximately the same meaning together so as to strengthen the association in the mind The common pidgin phrase look see is a literal translation of this device for making their own language comprehensible to themselves  Another and more far reaching way is the adoption of tone The same syllable pronounced in differing tones of voice takes different meanings There are four of these tones in Mandarin and I believe as many as nine in Cantonese These tones or rather the forerunners of those used today are one of the elements of prosody  I have mentioned these few outstanding complexities of the language itself and I assure you there are many more only to show the difficulty of the tools with which the Chinese poet works Let anyone who finds it difficult to write poetry in English offer praises to Apollo that he is not a Chinese  The prosody is as complex and difficult as might be expected from a nation which communicates in such a language Too many better informed persons than I have written about it to make more than the merest suggestion necessary here  The three major elements used are length of line   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  rhyme and tone Prosody distinguishes between two tones a flat or low tone which in the metrical skeletons is called ping and the deflected tones which include the rising sinking and abruptly arrested tones and are all included in tseh These deflected tones are more emphatic and therefore bear some faint resemblance to our own accented syllables  A concrete example may make this clearer Here then is the metrical skeleton of a tsueh or four line poem one of the standard forms beginning in ping  ping ping tseh tseh tseh ping ping  tseh tseh ping ping tseh tseh ping  tseh tseh ping ping ping tseh tseh  ping ping tseh tseh tseh ping ping  The first second and fourth lines rhyme The third is unrhymed The tonal pattern is absolutely set except for six characters three in each of the middle lines which may be varied at will The first and last lines are alike The third is usually the exact opposite of these two In content the short stop as it is called is the first half of a longer poem in which the end is left to the imagination as with the Japanese hokku though suggestion has been more highly developed by the Japanese  I give a literal translation of such a poem by Su Shih 1036 1101 to show the telegraphic condensation of the content  Spring evening one moment price thousand gold Flowers have fresh odor moon has shadow   On Translating Chinese Poetry  Singing piping comes from the balcony floor fine fine Garden swing is motionless evening drips drips  I have added punctuation and words which are understood The last three words mean that the water in the water glass which records the evening drips and drips  What are the difficulties of our sonnet compared to this  Miss Louise Hammond of Wusih in Kiangsu has recently done some very interesting work in taking down the chanting tunes to which these poems are recited by the Chinese scholars And to accompany these tunes she has made see page 252 translations having the same number of syllables as the original poems the same rhyme scheme and reproducing as nearly as possible the rhythmic patterns The tonal pattern of course cannot be reproduced as we have no equivalent in English She found that iambic metre with a sudden unexpected bang on the seventh syllable where the two stresses come together was made necessary by the tune Her translations of these poems show the form although the reader can judge for himself how much of the content must be omitted in order to bring the English version down to the required number of syllables These translations preserving as they do part of the original form preserve also to my ears much of the magic Whereas the recent free verse translations in reproducing the entire content have been obliged to sacrifice this magic of form which is so essential a part of the Chinese poems  So much for the complexity Now to return to the   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  simplicity The T ang poems to which the bulk of the recently rendered poems belong are written in language so simple as to be almost colloquial always be it remembered within the complexity already mentioned Witter Bynner s co worker Dr Kiang Kang hu was constantly urging him to use the simplest and most direct language possible in putting them into English Hence the folk like quality of the better translations There seems little doubt that the T ang poets themselves would prefer to be translated thus simply since to them the complexity was merely a part of an already assimilated background as the lesser complexities of our own language and prosody are merely a background for our own poets And the poets of this golden age of China like ourselves were being deliberately direct  Yet the effect on a western reader is oddly deceptive It all seems so easy and comprehensible At last we understand the Chinese But do we I for one doubt it And in the midst of the jubilation I raise my voice of caution Eunice Tietjens  To be concluded  REVIEWS  MR SQUIRE  Poems Second Series by J C Squire George H Doran  One may go to Mr J C Squire without shock absorbers

listening Not that Mr Squire might be called a reactionary No indeed He skips beats he employs in every second or third poem a set of imperfect rhymes he speaks with true modern insight of an aeroplane a football strychnine and angina pectoris If he mistakes history for profundity he is at any rate to be commended for making a thorough job of it vide The Moon with mention not only of Hector and Achilles but also of Carthage Alexander s Grave and the tomb of Moses in the wilderness Nothing has been omitted save Jacob s Ladder and the Hanging Gardens of Babylon As a matter of fact Mr Squire has inadvertently perhaps discovered and demonstrated a most pleasant a most esthetic manner of teaching the truisms of science of ornithology in The Birds of introductory psychology in Process of Thought and of botany in A Poet to his Muse History I have already mentioned but history is an art not a science and with Mr Squire art is incidental  He takes his materials as he finds them mixed and ready middle aged and respectable combinations of rhythms and words plus the philosophy of his forefathers slightly modified to include Darwinism Upon this he has superimposed the sentimentality of a boy in his first love affair Above all one must not look a fact in the face Circumlocution he points out is praiseworthy Ideas may thus be dispensed with It is difficult to break   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  ways to create new images and force them into coherence in fresh words to penetrate beyond externals Let us therefore glorify Science Nature Patriotism and our dog which has just died vide A Dog s Death As soon as the new tariff is passed we shall again have peace on earth  Fen Landscape is the single poem in the volume that one may in good conscience select to quote However it is not representative  Wind waves the reeds by the river Grey sky lids the leaden water Ducks fly low across the water Three flying one quacks sadly  Grey are the sky and the water Grey the lost ribbons of reed beds Small in the silence a black boat Floats upon wide pale mirrors  Pearl Andelson  RED WRATH  Bars and Shadows the Prison Poems of Ralph Chaplin With an Introduction by Scott Nearing Leonard Press New York A book like this makes one wonder at the futility of  certain human laws and processes Mr Chaplin free was an I W W agitator shooting off social fireworks more explosive than destructive Mr Chaplin imprisoned these five years becomes a martyr poet shaping his dreams into arrow pointed far travelling songs Society   Red Wrath  doesn t like this or that revolutionist and so it sends him to prison the gallows or the stake in other words sends him exactly where his suffering will make the most effective appeal to the imaginations of men so that each word will drop weightily from his lips like minted gold  Here is the first half of The Red Feast  Go fight you fools Tear up the earth with strife And spill each other s guts upon the field Serve unto death the men you served in life So that their wide dominions may not yield  Stand by the flag the lie that still allures Lay down your lives for land you do not own And give unto a war that is not yours Your gory tithe of mangled flesh and bone  But whether it be yours to fall or kill Yo u must not pause to question why nor where You see the tiny crosses on that hill It took all those to make one millionaire  It was for him the seas of blood were shed That fields were razed and cities lit the sky And now he comes to chortle o er the dead The condor Thing for whom the millions die  The bugle screams the cannons cease to roar Enough enough God give us peace again The rats the maggots and the Lords of War Are fat to bursting from their meal of men  This may be rather tawdry poetry and to some of us it seems loose thinking but it is like to prove bitter propaganda If the lords of things as they are wished to speed the day of   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  The mighty proletarian dictature  they could not do better than keep such men as Ralph Chaplin in prison  Alas how is it that the world jogs on regardless when such cries are ringing in its ears Are we then of little faith And are they prophets who can sing  Accursed Monster nightmare of the years Pause but a moment ere you pass away Pause and behold the earth made clean and pure  And so forth These passionate pleaders actually believe that a day of social justice will dawn nay is dawning when under a proletarian dictature of imposed equalities the lion and the lamb the jackal and the prairie dog the ass and the race horse the elephant and the kangaroo will live together in choral harmony contributing and consuming each his just and reasoned communistic dole Believe it they go to prison they suffer and die for it they set up a temporarily proletarian autocracy in Moscow to prove it and cling to the faith when their shaky Russian structure rings hollow with famine and brazen with force and when Lenine dying in the seat of the Tzars surely knows at last that he attempted the impossible and faces like many another magnanimous dreamer the tragic irony of his failure  Ah me the Revolution lags because not of the apathy but of the common sense of the world Democracy is an education in common sense therefore the   Red Wrath  Revolution will lag to utter weariness in this democracy of ours which has learned that slow adjustments are more effective than swift ones toward inducing such a measure of social justice as may be attainable under the limitations of human nature which is always inexorably and adorably foolish and selfish and vain So let the red agitators talk and the red poets sing and for God s sake open their prison gates We need their fire their color we need the fervor of their dream And we need not fear that the structure of our civilization will fall before them  We have wandered some distance from our text There is better poetry in Mr Chaplin s book than the fierce stanzas quoted above for example The Warrior Wind or this one Mourn not the Dead which opens the book  Mourn not the dead that in the cool earth lie Dust unto dust The calm sweet earth that mothers all who die As all men must  Mourn not your captive comrades who must dwell Too strong to strive Within each steel bound coffin of a cell Buried alive  But rather mourn the apathetic throng The cowed and the meek Who see the world s great anguish and its wrong And dare not speak  H M   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  CALM WATERS  The Blue Ship by Herbert Jones Bodley Head London  Vers de société suave sophisticated cultured and very pleasant to read on a warm day in a hammock I do not mean to be insulting The poems have charm And that which is rarer still in poetry humor They are the well mannered expressions of a well mannered young man Mrs Grundy would be entirely satisfied with them And perhaps it is because I am not a Mrs Grundy that I wish Mr Jones would occasionally forget to be such a perfect gentleman and that he would for once be abandoned in his ecstasies and his passions that his hand or that of his hero would not always poise so correctly above her heart   till Like a rainbow scattered The spell at a blow of his will Was bitterly shattered  Indeed so many of the poems poise above love that they are almost adolescent in their shy hovering Mr Jones does not halt the maid he inevitably goes by and wonders  Would she have laughed Or frowned and fled Or blushed and waited  And in another poem the music box comes to the rescue  When all her being seemed to glow And beg to be caressed When dancing threatened faith and trust   Calm Waters  In one wild flood to drown The poor old battered music box For good and all ran down We laughed I kissed her hand good night Ah Virtue take thy crown  The Blue Ship the initial poem of the book is the most successful It is the story told almost entirely in blank verse of a man and a girl hovering again around love or rather the girl does the hovering The psychology is excellent throughout and the story moves smoothly and with interest I like particularly the speeches of the heroine and her startlingly realistic soliloquy  He s honest he s beguiling  I ll never be his wife  At least not now Tomorrow  He ll come and say goodby  I m sorry for his sorrow  He s not to blame nor I  Tomorrow he ll be swearing  He ll never see me more  What dress shall I be wearing  He s sworn it twice before  The shorter poems are very light easy to read and easy to forget And Mary and the Sea bear A New world Fairy tale is somewhat too long in spite of its originality and certain delightful stanzas and a very delightful pelican who came  Flying flap flap sail And flap again and sail again Pelican style  Marion Strobel   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  FROM THE NINETIES TO THE PRESENT  A Shropshire Lad by A E Housman Henry Holt amp Co Poems New and Old by Henry Newbolt Dutton amp Co Poems with Fables in Prose 2 vols by Herbert Trench  Constable amp Co Ltd Later Poems by Bliss Carman with an Appreciation by  R H Hathaway McClelland amp Stewart Toronto  The Collected Poems of James Elroy Flecker With an  Introduction by J C Squire Alfred A Knopf  Let us thank God Hawthorne once said apropos of our Puritan ancestry for having given us such ancestors And let each succeeding generation thank God for being so much the further removed from them These poets with the exception of Flecker are men who struck their pace roughly in the nineties and though they may write about the Marne or the ravaging of Belgium they belong to another poetic period than the present They have standards but not the standards of today  Historically Mr Housman s A Shropshire Lad can scarcely be overestimated Before directness was the fashion it aimed at and achieved a straightforward simplicity It stripped away turgid rhetoric and elaborate decoration relying upon the simple human emotions plainly expressed for its effect And it set a standard of metrical precision which immediate successors could not safely disregard Mr Trench did disregard it with disastrous results At once and deservedly the book   From the Nineties to the Present  became a model and its influence upon the English poets has been amazingly widespread  But one must keep the historical point in mind to give the book its full due Today with a great war just past one is inclined to comment on the abnormally high mortality rate in Shropshire Something over half the poems have death in the abstract in the theme and about a quarter of the poems deal with death in the specific The gallows is well represented and one inconsiderate lover cuts his throat from ear to ear while in his mistress arms after which horror she tastes something salty and he has time for a speech The truth is death with Mr Housman is not ever death but always the thought of it he gets the sweeter half of its sorrow and none of its pain As a result his poems have a true and clear but a thin emotional base  His themes always so purified of any possible pain are expressed with a direct deftness which is characteristic of the book and of the standard which it set One short poem of exile will show the quality of the workmanship  Tis time I think by Wenlock town The golden broom should blow The hawthorne sprinkled up and down Should charge the land with snow Spring will not wait the loiterer s time Who keeps so long away So others wear the broom and climb The hedgerows heaped with may Oh tarnish late on Wenlock Edge Gold that I never see   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Lie long high snowdrift in the hedge That will not shower on me  Notice the preciseness of the accent the full stop compact quatrain the definitely marked line There is nothing loose Tightness characterizes it And therein to my mind lies the chief contrast to be made between the best work of the nineties and of today The one aims at precision the other at effectiveness The one is rather sparing in its use of figures employs simpler never complicated comparisons the other relies upon striking metaphors explosive effects only too often overdone  Mr Newbolt s work has the same ease and accuracy of expression It never stumbles never hesitates He is at his best in the semi dramatic pieces The Fighting Téméraire is justly well known and the refrain of The Song of the Sou wester indeed all his refrains are good has a fine rushing swing to it One can always be sure a poem by Mr Newbolt will not disappoint whether it will give the highest esthetic satisfaction or not is another matter  The work of Mr Trench is sharply in contrast His muse in his Stanzas on Poetry sets him rather an appalling task which he quite reasonably recoils from But he has nevertheless a tendency to assume rather pompously the bardic robes The direct simplicity of A Shropshire Lad is alien to him one finds in his vocabulary such words as chthonian enorm umbratility augurial and gurges and his metres are wooden On the other hand he makes a bid for the richly sensuous notably in parts of Deirdre   From the Nineties to the Present  Wedded where he comes nearest success something Mr  Housman does not attempt  From A Shropshire Lad to Bliss Carman s Later Poems and the work of Flecker is a long journey but in the case of Mr Carman at least down a fairly straight road Mr Housman s volume had a feeling for nature but chiefly for nature with people in it Mr Carman has more of an eye for nature herself and a conventional felicity in description although there is a touch too much of softness in his view of her His link with Mr Housman is again in the precision of his workmanship and a moderately marked affection for the quatrain This volume gathered as I take it from his later books shows that he has not been out of touch with developments There is in it a turning toward the effective figure which is modern  Gold are the great trees overhead And gold the leaf strewn grass As though a cloth of gold were spread T o let a seraph pass  This has the contemporary touch as has  Through the street of St Germain March the tattered hosts of rain  There is no reason why the virtues of this precisely marked rhythm should not be combined with the modern vividness indeed the trend is toward a reconciliation of the schools But Mr Carman has not effected the reconciliation He belongs to the nineties with a vigor of his own   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  James Elroy Flecker the last of these poets whom we have to consider is at once the youngest and esthetically the finest The tragedy too of incompleteness adds a glamour to his work for it was only about 1908 that he struck his real pace and in 1915 he died at thirty one The French Parnassians are his avowed models and he admires them chiefly for the finish of their workmanship Their doctrine he thought would redeem English poetry from the formlessness and the didactic tendencies which are now 1913 in fashion Taking his stand then for a well controlled expression his rhythms like Hous man s are generally sharply marked he yet employs exotic material and he has the current passion for color and ocular vividness the statuesque or picture quality he admires in the Parnassians  So Flecker serving in the precision of his form as a link between the 1890 s and the 1920 s is distinctly a contemporary in spirit and will people never learn that the contemporary movement is not a question of form but one of vision It is not the poet s business he says to save a man s soul but to make it worth saving And without didacticism he turns to beauty  In the volume are several of Flecker s translations from the French poets he admired translations which are brilliant successes I have not tested their accuracy but they are fine poetry in the new language which is mainly to be desired And this short poem may show something of the nature of Flecker s own work   From the Ninettes to the Present  A linnet who had lost her way Sang on a blackened bough in hell Till all the ghosts remembered well The trees the wind the golden day  At last they knew that they had died When they heard music in that land And someone there stole forth a hand To draw a brother to his side  The transition from one century to the next then has been marked by a shift in emphasis A technical precise ness plus the minor chords of emotion is no longer sufficient Those qualities may and do and ought to exist But the modernist before he approves now looks for something more than mere deftness A clear cut image generally indicates a clearly grasped idea and before there can be vividness that contemporary fetich there must usually be vivid feeling Royall Snow CORRESPONDENCE  PARIS NOTES  Jean Cocteau s new book begins with a charming medley of disconnected images  Arbres bocal d oiseaux feu de bengale etc  but closes with eight line stanzas that Malherbe might have polished and four line stanzas not unlike Gautier s  Paul Valéry s best productions are crisp flowers of the purest classicism Valéry and Cocteau a strange encounter in the noble garden of French verse Fancy   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  and Meditation go hand in hand under the reconciled gaze of the marble nymphs and fauns Fancy is younger  Hélas je vais avoir trente ans  But Meditation is wiser Fancy wants to be taken seriously  Tel qui jadis me voulut mordre Voyant ma figure à l envers Comprendra soudain que mes vers Furent les serviteurs de l ordre  Meditation nods approval poesy should be the servant of order Here we have expressed by two different poets an eternal law more obviously put into practice by French poets than by those of any other nation in modern Europe except Keats maybe But then Keats is an influence to be reckoned with in tracing the growth of Cocteau and Valéry  Of La Plèiade Valéry may be considered the only one to  achieve a perfect success The Countess de Noailles in  her verbal ecstasy disregards the thought and cares not  for constructive splendor Mazade s Ardent Voyage  brings no new coloring the sun flooded lines of his  Provencal landscape the glorious remains of the past the  mellow pastel of the Rhone valley sometimes lashed by  the wind he can express with a subtle nicety of rhythm  but master though he proves of his technique he lacks a  quality possessed in the highest degree by Valéry the  beauty of a form scintillating with thought Valéry is the  idol among his brethren of the Plèiade The Countess   Paris Notes  appalled by Valéry s lyrical discretion hails him Maître d un chant nouveau  The themes of the neo classicists are borrowed from the eternal glamour of nature and love Following Valéry s sibylline ratiocinations de Magallon Reynaud and a few others take up the philosophical attitude Naturally enough the ancient symbols brought down to us by a continuous tradition Ronsard La Fontaine Chénier still serve to embody the actual modes of feeling Even Catholicism expresses itself through their medium in the work of Reynard André Lamandé has made a wreath of hyacinths Under the bright gaze of Athene On this point read the enlightening article of Henry Gauthier Villars in the Mercure de France of March 1st 1922  Valéry s verse is the newest form of poetic symbolism His aloofness reminds the reader of Alfred de Vigny his diamond like glitter recalls Mallarmé Tradition links him back to our very first classicists Malherbe being the foremost Malherbe is also the poet whose voice soars and guides the boyish chatter of Fancy in Jean Cocteau s verse Vocabulaire Edition de la Sirène Paris It is reassuring to find a common ancestor to Valéry and Cocteau Such pieces as  Et vous grande âme espérez vous un songe Qui n aura plus ces couleurs de mensonge Qu aux yeux de chair l onde et l air font ici Chanterez vous quand serez vaporeuse Allez tout fuit Ma présence est poreuse La sainte impatience meurt aussi   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  have the smooth polish of the Malherbian marble veined by the very blood of the heart Such lines as  La jeunesse me quitte et j ai son coup reçu  or  Nous sommes tellement proche la douce vie Qu à peine par la mort elle nous est ravie Elle ouvre le passage et nous lâche la main  avowedly borrow archaic forms from the poet of Odes 1600  Cocteau carves the roses of his fancy into stone before they slip between his youthful fingers Valéry brings forth out of the solitude where he studied mathematics resplendent numbers with which he rebuilds his soul I do not think Valéry would like Cocteau s smiles and premature sadness I do not think Cocteau would follow Valéry under the Greek porticoes And yet Narcissus is a symbol to both of them This is from Vocabulaire  Comme une grande soif de lumière Narcisse penché sur une eau Où se voyait de bas en haut  While Valéry confesses  Nulle des nymphes nulle amie ne m attire Comme tu fais sur l onde inépuisable moi  I know that there are a few deliberately imitative lines in Cocteau s Vocabulaire I also know that Ronsard and Malherbe are the chosen poets of Cocteau s artistic predilection and standard   Paris Notes  Reflection brings amusement and unrest to Cocteau and to Valéry the pride and ennui of the sage Jean Cocteau remains what he always was an exquisite ironist akin to Watteau or Boucher with the sensuality of the latter and the risky innuendo of the former To the rustle of silk and the minuet of the violins Cocteau adds the organ of the merry go rounds All this music even occasionally swelling into a jazz band crash is today s laughter just emerging out of an heroic gloom  Jean Catel NOTES  The fact that this is a woman s number of POETRY does not result from the editor s deliberate intention As most of the contributors had been promised space this month it seemed wise to postpone the one or two masculine poets at first scheduled and to present exclusively the feminine claim to variety of method and mood in this art Quite a number of issues during our past history have been masculine but this is the first one to speak entirely with feminine voices  Muna Lee Mrs Luiz Munoz Marin lived in Oklahoma when
