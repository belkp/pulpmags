smokes on the mountain side Our Father Rosicross is in his tomb  Pull down the blinds bring fiddle and clarionet Let there be no foot silent in the room Nor mouth with kissing nor the wine unwet Our Father Rosicross is in his tomb  In vain in vain the cataract still cries The everlasting taper lights the gloom All wisdom shut into its onyx eyes Our Father Rosicross sleeps in his tomb  William Butler Yeats   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  TO A CHILD DANCING UPON THE SHORE  Dance there upon the shore What need have you to care For wind or water s roar And tumble out your hair That the salt drops have wet Being young you have not known The fool s triumph nor yet Love lost as soon as won And he the best warrior dead And all the sheaves to bind What need that you should dread The monstrous crying of wind  William Butler Yeats  FALLEN MAJESTY  Although crowds gathered once if she but showed her face And even old men s eyes grew dim this hand alone Like some last courtier at a gipsy camping place Babbling of fallen majesty records what s gone The lineaments the heart that laughter has made sweet These these remain but I record what s gone A crowd Will gather and not know that through its very street Once walked a thing that seemed as it were a burning  cloud  William Butler Yeats   LOVE AND THE BIRD  The moments passed as at a play I had the wisdom love can bring I had my share of mother wit And yet for all that I could say And though I had her praise for it And she seemed happy as a king Love s moon was withering away  Believing every word I said I praised her body and her mind 1 ill pride had made her eyes grow bright And pleasure made her cheeks grow red And vanity her footfall light Yet we for all that praise could find Nothing but darkness overhead  I sat as silent as a stone And knew though she d not said a word That even the best of love must die And had been savagely undone Were it not that love upon the cry Of a most ridiculous little bird  Threw up in the air his marvellous moon  William Butler Yeats   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  THE REALISTS  Hope that you may understand What can books of men that wive In a dragon guarded land Paintings of the dolphin drawn Sea nymphs in their pearly waggons Do but wake the hope to live That had gone With the dragons  William Butler Yeats   SANGAR  TO LINCOLN STEFFENS Somewhere I read a strange old rusty tale Smelling of war most curiously named The Mad Recreant Knight of the West Once you have read the round world brimmed with hate Stirred and revolted flashed unceasingly Facets of cruel splendor And the strong Harried the weak  Long past long past praise God In these fair peaceful happy days The Tale Eastward the Huns break border Surf on a rotten dyke They have murdered the Eastern Warder His head on a pike Arm thee arm thee my father Swift rides the Goddes bane And the high nobles gather On the plain 0 blind world wrath cried Sangar Greatly I killed in youth I dreamed men had done with anger Through Goddes truth Smiled the boy then in faint scorn Hard with the battle thrill Arm thee loud calls the war horn And shrill   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  He has bowed to the voice stentorian Sick with thought of the grave He has called for his battered morion  And his scarred glaive On the boy s helm a glove Of the Duke s daughter In his eyes splendor of love And slaughter  Hideous the Hun advances Like a sea tide on sand Unyielding the haughty lances Make dauntless stand And ever amid the clangor Butchering Hun and Hun With sorrowful face rides Sangar And his son  Broken is the wild invader Sullied the whole world s fountains They have penned the murderous raider With his back to the mountains Yet tho what had been mead Is now a bloody lake Still drink swords where men bleed Nor slake   Sangar  Now leaps one into the press The Hell twixt front and front Sangar bloody and torn of dress He has borne the brunt Hold cries Peace God s Peace Heed ye what Christus says And the wild battle gave surcease In amaze  When will ye cast out hate Brothers my mad mad brothers Mercy ere it be too late These are sons of your mothers For sake of Him who died on Tree Who of all Creatures loved the Least Blasphemer God of Battles He Cried a priest  Peace and with his two hands Has broken in twain his glaive Weaponless smiling he stands Coward or brave Traitor howls one rank Think ye The Hun be our brother And Fear we to die craven think ye 1 he other   Then sprang his son to his side His lips with slaver were wet For he had felt how men died And was lustful yet On his bent helm a glove Of the Duke s daughter In his eyes splendor of love And slaughter  Shouting Father no more of mine Shameful old man abhorr d First traitor of all our line Up the two handed sword He smote fell Sangar and then Screaming red the boy ran Straight at the foe and again Hell began  Oh there was joy in Heaven when Sangar came Sweet Mary wept and bathed and bound his wounds And God the Father healed him of despair And Jesus gripped his hand and laughed and laughed  John Reed   A LEGEND OF THE DOVE  Soft from the linden s bough Unmoved against the tranquil afternoon Eve s dove laments her now Ah gone long gone shall not I find thee soon  That yearning in his voice Told not to Paradise a sorrow s tale As other birds rejoice He sang a brother to the nightingale  By twilight on her breast He saw the flower sleep the star awake And calling her from rest Made all the dawn melodious for her sake  And then the Tempter s breath The sword of exile and the mortal chain The heritage of death That gave her heart to dust his own to pain  In Eden desolate The seraph heard his lonely music swoon As now reiterate Ah gone long gone shall not I find thee soon  George Sterling   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  AT THE GRAND CANON  Thou settest splendors in my sight O Lord It seems as tho a deep hued sunset falls Forever on these Cyclopean walls  These battlements where Titan hosts have warred  And hewn the world with devastating sword And shook with trumpets the eternal halls Where seraphim lay hid by bloody palls  And only Hell and Silence were adored  Lo the abyss wherein great Satan s wings Might gender tempests and his dragons breath Fume up in pestilence Beneath the sun Or starry outposts on terrestrial things Is no such testimony unto Death Nor altars builded to Oblivion  George Sterling   KINDRED  Musing between the sunset and the dark As Twilight in unhesitating hands Bore from the faint horizon s underlands  Silvern and chill the moon s phantasmal ark  I heard the sea and far away could mark Where that unalterable waste expands In sevenfold sapphire from the mournful sands  And saw beyond the deep a vibrant spark  There sank the sun Arcturus and I thought Star by an ocean on a world of thine May not a being born like me to die Confront a little the eternal Naught And watch our isolated sun decline Sad for his evanescence even as I  George Sterling   REMEMBERED LIGHT  The years are a falling of snow Slow but without cessation On hills and mountains and flowers and worlds that  were But snow and the crawling night in which it fell May be washed away in one swifter hour of flame Thus it was that some slant of sunset In the chasms of piled cloud Transient mountains that made a new horizon Uplifting the west to fantastic pinnacles Smote warm in a buried realm of the spirit Till the snows of forgetfulness were gone  Clear in the vistas of memory The peaks of a world long unremembered Soared further than clouds but fell not Based on hills that shook not nor melted With that burden enormous hardly to be believed Rent with stupendous chasms Full of an umber twilight I beheld that larger world  Bright was the twilight sharp like ethereal wine Above but low in the clefts it thickened Dull as with duskier tincture   Remembered Light  Like whimsical wings outspread but unstirring Flowers that seemed spirits of the twilight That must pass with its passing Too fragile for day or for darkness Fed the dusk with more delicate hues than its own Stars that were nearer more radiant than ours Quivered and pulsed in the clear thin gold of the sky  These things I beheld Till the gold was shaken with flight Of fantastical wings like broken shadows Forerunning the darkness Till the twilight shivered with outcry of eldritch  voices Like pain s last cry ere oblivion  Clark Ashton Smith   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  SORROWING OF WINDS  O winds that pass uncomforted Through all the peacefulness of spring And tell the trees your sorrowing  That they must moan till ye are fled  Think ye the Tyrian distance holds The crystal of unquestioned sleep That those forgetful purples keep  No veiled contentious greens and golds  Half with communicated grief Half that they are not free to pass With you across the flickering grass  Mourns each vibrating bough and leaf  And I with soul disquieted Shall find within the haunted spring No peace till your strange sorrowing  Is down the Tyrian distance fled  Clark Ashton Smith   AMERICA  I hear America singing And the great prophet passed Serene clear and untroubled Into the silence vast  When will the master poet Rise with vision strong To mold her manifold music Into a living song  I hear America singing   Beyond the beat and stress The chant of her shrill unjaded Empiric loveliness  Laughter beyond mere scorning Wisdom surpassing wit Love and the unscathed spirit These shall encompass it  Alice Corbin   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  SYMBOLS  Who was it built the cradle of wrought gold A druid chanting by the waters old Who was it kept the sword of vision bright A warrior falling darkly in the fight Who was it put the crown upon the dove A woman paling in the arms of love Oh who but these since Adam ceased to be Have kept their ancient guard about the Tree  Alice Corbin  THE STAR  I saw a star fall in the night And a grey moth touched my cheek Such majesty immortals have Such pity for the weak  Alice Corbin   NODES  The endless foolish merriment of stars Beside the pale cold sorrow of the moon Is like the wayward noises of the world Beside my heart s uplifted silent tune  The little broken glitter of the waves Beside the golden sun s intense white blaze Is like the idle chatter of the crowd Beside my heart s unwearied song of praise  The sun and all the planets in the sky Beside the sacred wonder of dim space Are notes upon a broken tarnished lute That God will someday mend and put in place  And space beside the little secret joy Of God that sings forever in the clay Is smaller than the dust we can not see That yet dies not till time and space decay  And as the foolish merriment of stars Beside the cold pale sorrow of the moon My little song my little joy my praise Beside God s ancient everlasting rune  Alice Corbin   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  POEMS  I  THOU hast made me known to friends whom I knew not Thou hast given me seats in homes not my own Thou hast brought the distant near and made a brother of the stranger I am uneasy at heart when I have to leave my accustomed shelter I forgot that there abides the old in the new and that there also thou abidest  Through birth and death in this world or in others wherever thou leadest me it is thou the same the one companion of my endless life who ever linkest my heart with bonds of joy to the unfamiliar When one knows thee then alien there is none then no door is shut Oh grant me my prayer that I may never lose the bliss of the touch of the One in the play of the many  II  No more noisy loud words from me such is my  master s will Henceforth I deal in whispers The speech  of my heart will be carried on in murmurings of a song  Men hasten to the King s market All the buyers  and sellers are there But I have my untimely leave in  the middle of the day in the thick of work  Let then the flowers come out in my garden though  it is not their time and let the midday bees strike up  their lazy hum   Poems  Full many an hour have I spent in the strife of the good and the evil but now it is the pleasure of my playmate of the empty days to draw my heart on to him and I know not why is this sudden call to what useless inconsequence  III  On the day when the lotus bloomed alas my mind was straying and I knew it not My basket was empty and the flower remained unheeded  Only now and again a sadness fell upon me andstarted up from my dream and felt a sweet trace of a strange smell in the south wind  That vague fragrance made my heart ache with longing and it seemed to me that it was the eager breath of the summer seeking for its completion  I knew not then that it was so near that it was mine and this perfect sweetness had blossomed in the depth of my own heart  IV  By all means they try to hold me secure who love me in this world But it is otherwise with thy love which is greater than theirs and thou keepest me free Lest I forget them they never venture to leave me alone But day passes by after day and thou are not seen  If I call not thee in my prayers if I keep not thee in my heart thy love for me still waits for my love   V  I was not aware of the moment when I first crossed the threshold of this life What was the power that made me open out into this vast mystery like a bud in the forest at midnight When in the morning I looked upon the light I felt in a moment that I was no stranger in this world that the inscrutable without name and form had taken me in its arms in the form of my own mother Even so in death the same unknown will appear as ever known to me And because I love this life I know I shall love death as well The child cries out when from the right breast the mother takes it away to find in the very next moment its consolation in the left one VI  Thou art the sky and thou art the nest as well Oh thou beautiful there in the nest it is thy love that encloses the soul with colours and sounds and odours There comes the morning with the golden basket in her right hand bearing the wreath of beauty silently to crown the earth And there comes the evening over the lonely meadows deserted by herds through trackless paths carrying cool draughts of peace in her golden pitcher from the western ocean of rest  But there where spreads the infinite sky for the soul to take her flight in reigns the stainless white radiance There is no day nor night nor form nor colour and never never a word Rabindranath Tagore  EDITORIAL COMMENT  A PERFECT RETURN  T is curious that the influence of Poe upon  Baudelaire Verlaine and Mallarmé and  through them upon English poets and then  through these last upon Americans comes  back to us in this round about and indirect way We have here an instance of what Whitman calls a perfect return We have denied Poe we do not give him his full meed of appreciation even today and yet we accept him through the disciples who have followed or have assimilated his tradition And now that young Englishmen are beginning to feel the influence of Whitman upon French poetry it may be that he too through the imitation of vers libre in America will begin to experience a perfect return  Must we always accept American genius in this round about fashion Have we no true perspective that we applaud mediocrity at home and look abroad for genius only to find that it is of American origin  This bit of marginalia extracted from a note book of 1909 was relieved of the necessity of further elaboration by supplementary evidence received in one day from two correspondents One a brief sentence from Mr Allen Upward It is much to be wished that America   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  should learn to honor her sons without waiting for the literary cliques of London  The other the following news note from Mr Paul Scott Mowrer in Paris The date of Léon Bazalgette s translation however is hardly so epochal as it would seem since Whitman has been known for many years in France having been partly translated during the nineties  Mr Mowrer writes  It is significant of American tardiness in the development of a national literary tradition that the name of Walt Whitman is today a greater influence with the young writers of the continent than with our own Not since France discovered Poe has literary Europe been so moved by anything American The suggestion has even been made that Whitmanism is rapidly to supersede Nietzscheism as the dominant factor in modern thought Léon Bazalgette translated Leaves of Grass into French in 1908 A school of followers of the Whitman philosophy and style was an almost immediate consequence Such of the leading reviews as sympathize at all with the strong young movement to break the shackles of classicism which have so long bound French prosody to the heroic couplet the sonnet and the alexandrine are publishing not only articles on Whitmanism as a movement but numbers of poems in the new flexible chanting rhythms In this regard La Nouvelle Revue Française La Renaissance Contemporaine and L Effort Libre have been preeminently hospitable   A Perfect Return  The new poems are not so much imitations of Whitman as inspirations from him Those who have achieved most success in the mode thus far are perhaps Georges Duhamel a leader of the Jeunes whose plays are at present attracting national notice André Spire who writes with something of the apostolic fervor of his Jewish ancestry Henri Franck who died recently shortly after the publication of his volume La Danse Devant l Arche Charles Vildrac with Le Livre à Amour Philéas Lebesgue the appearance in collected form of whose Les Servitudes is awaited with keen interest and finally Jean Richard Bloch editor of L Effort Libre whose prose for example in his book of tales entitled Levy is said to be directly rooted in Whitmanism  In Germany too the rolling intonations of the singer of democracy have awakened echoes The Moderne Weltdichtung has announced itself with Whitman as guide and such apostles as Wilhelm Schmidtbonn in Lobegesang des Lebens and Ernst Lissauer in Der Acker and Der Strom  What is it about Whitman that Europe finds so inspiriting First his acceptance of the universe as he found it his magnificently shouted comradeship with all nature and all men Such a doctrine makes an instant though hardly logical appeal in nations where socialism is the political order of the day And next his disregard of literary tradition Out of books more books and out of them still more with the fecundity of generations   But in this process of literary propagation thought unfortunately instead of arising like a child ever fresh and vigorous as in the beginning grows more and more attenuated paler more sickly The acclaim of Whitman is nothing less than the inevitable revolt against the modern flood of book inspired books Write from nature directly from the people directly from the political meeting and the hayfield and the factory that is what the august American seems to his young disciples across the seas to be crying to them  Perhaps it is because America already holds as commonplaces these fundamentals seeming so new to Europe that the Whitman schools have sprung up stronger on the eastern side of the Atlantic than on the western  It is not that America holds as commonplaces the fundamentals expressed in Whitman that there have been more followers of the Whitman method in Europe than in America but that American poets approaching poetry usually through terms of feeling and apparently loath to apply an intellectual whip to themselves or others have made no definite analysis of the rhythmic units of Whitman We have been content to accept the English conception of the barbaric yawp of Whitman The curious mingling of the concrete and the spiritual which is what certain modern painters perhaps under the Whitman suggestion are trying to achieve was so novel as to be disconcerting and the vehicle so   A Perfect Return  original as to appear uncouth uncadenced unmusical The hide bound antiquated conception of English prosody is responsible for a great deal of dead timber It is a significant fact that the English first accepted the spirit of Whitman the French his method The rhythmic measure of Whitman has yet to be correctly estimated by English and American poets It has been sifted and weighed by the French poets and though Whitman s influence upon modern French poetry has been questioned by English critics the connection between his varied rhythmic units and modern vers libre is too obvious to be discounted There may be an innate necessity sufficient to cause a breaking up of forms in a poetic language but there is no reason to believe that Paris the great clearing house of all the arts would not be quick to adopt a suggestion from without English poets certainly have not been loath to accept suggestions from Paris  At any rate this international acceptance of the two greatest American poets and the realization of their international influence upon us may awaken us to a new sense of responsibility It would be a valuable lesson if only we could learn to turn the international eye in private upon ourselves If the American poet can learn to be less parochial to apply the intellectual whip to visualize his art to separate it and see it apart from himself we may learn then to appreciate the great poet when he is in our midst and not wait for the approval of English or French critics   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  TAGORE S POEMS  The appearance of the poems of Rabindranath Tagore translated by himself from Bengali into English is an event in the history of English poetry and of world poetry I do not use these terms with the looseness of contemporary journalism Questions of poetic art are serious not to be touched upon lightly or in a spirit of bravura  Bengal is a nation of fifty million people The great age of Bengali literature is this age in which we live And the first Bengali whom I heard singing the lyrics of Tagore said as simply as one would say it is four o clock Yes we speak of it as the Age of Rabindranath  The six poems now published were chosen from a hundred lyrics about to appear in book form They might just as well have been any other six for they do not represent a summit of attainment but an average  These poems are cast in the original in metres perhaps the most finished and most subtle of any known to us If you refine the art of the troubadours combine it with that of the Plèiade and add to that the sound unit principle of the most advanced artists in vers libre you would get something like the system of Bengali verse The sound of it when spoken is rather like good Greek for Bengali is daughter of Sanscrit which is a kind of uncle or elder brother of the Homeric idiom  All this series of a hundred poems are made to music for Mr Tagore is not only the great poet of Bengal   Tagore s Poems  he is also their great musician He teaches his songs and they are sung throughout Bengal more or less as the troubadours songs were sung through Europe in the twelfth century  And we feel here in London I think much as the people of Petrarch s time must have felt about the mysterious lost language the Greek that was just being restored to Europe after centuries of deprivation That Greek was the lamp of our renaissance and its perfections have been the goal of our endeavor ever since  I speak with all seriousness when I say that this beginning of our more intimate intercourse with Bengal is the opening of another period For one thing the content of this first brief series of poems will destroy the popular conception of Buddhism for we in the occident are apt to regard it as a religion negative and anti Christian  The Greek gave us humanism a belief in mens sana in corpore sano a belief in proportion and balance The Greek shows us man as the sport of the gods the sworn foe of fate and the natural forces The Bengali brings to us the pledge of a calm which we need overmuch in an age of steel and mechanics It brings a quiet proclamation of the fellowship between man and the gods between man and nature  It is all very well to object that this is not the first  time we have had this fellowship proclaimed but in the  arts alone can we find the inner heart of a people There   is a deeper calm and a deeper conviction in this eastern expression than we have yet attained It is by the arts alone that one people learns to meet another far distant people in friendship and respect  I speak with all gravity when I say that world fellowship is nearer for the visit of Rabindranath Tagore  to London Ezra Pound REVIEWS The Poems of Rosamund Marriott Watson John Lane  This English poet whose singing ceased a year ago had a real lyric gift though a very slight one The present volume is a collection of all her poems from the first girlish sheaf Tares to The Lamp and the Lute which she was preparing for publication when she died  Through this whole life record her poetry ripples along as smoothly and delicately as a meadow rill with never a pause nor a flurry nor a thrill She sings prettily of everyone from the Last Fairy to William Ernest Henley and of everything from Death and Justice to the Orchard of the Moon but she has nothing arresting or important to say of any of these subjects and no keen magic of phrase to give her warbling that intense vitality which would win for her the undying fame prophesied by her loyal husband in his preface  Nevertheless her feeling is genuine her touch light and her tune a quiet monotone of gentle soothing music which has a certain soft appeal Perhaps the secret of   Reviews  it is the fine quality of soul which breathes through these numerous lyrics a soul too reserved to tell its whole story and too preoccupied with the little things around and within her to pay much attention to the thinking fighting ever moving world without  A big spirited vital headlong narrative poem is The Adventures of Young Maverick by Hervey White who runs a printing press at Woodstock N Y and bravely publishes The Wild Hawk his own little magazine The poem has as many moods as Don Juan which is plainly though not tyrannically its model  The poem is long for these days five cantos and nearly six hundred Spenserian stanzas Yet the most casual reader one would think could scarcely find it tedious even though the satirical passages run heavily at times The hero is a colt of lofty Arabian lineage and the poem becomes eloquently pictorial in setting forth his beauty  Young Maverick in the upland pastures lay Woven as in the grass while star like flowers Shaking their petals down in sweet array  Dappled his flanks with gentle breathless showers The thread green stems tangled in bending bowers Their pollen plumes of dust closed over him  Enwoofing through the drowse of summer hours  The pattern of his body head and limb  His color of pale gold glowed as with sunshine dim  The spirit of the West is in this poem its freedom  spaciousness strong sunshine also its careless good humor and half sardonic fun The race between the    horse and the Mexican boy is as swift vivid and rhythmical as a mountain stream and the Mexican family even to the fat old Gregorio are characterized to the life with a sympathy only too rare among writers of the Anglo Saxon race  Certain other characterizations are equally incisive this for example  Sometimes I peep into a modern poet Like Arthur Symons vaguely beautiful Who loves but love not caring who shall know it I wonder that he never finds it dull  Mr White is so profoundly a democrat and so wholeheartedly a poet of the broad level average American people that both social and artistic theories sit very lightly upon him He achieves beauty as by chance now and then because he can not help it but always he achieves a warm vitality the persuasive illusion of life  The Iscariot by Eden Phillpotts John Lane is the ingenious effort of a theorist in human nature to unroll the convolutions of the immortal traitor s soul And it is as ineffectual as any such effort must be to remould characters long fixed in literary or historic tradition In the art of the world Judas is Judas anyone who tries to make him over into a pattern of misguided loyalty has his labor for his pains  The blank verse in which the monologue is uttered is accurately measured and sufficiently sonorous  H M    Reviews  Interpretations A Book of First Poems by Zoë Akins Mitchell Kennerley  The poems in this volume are creditable in texture  revealing a conscious sense of artistic workmanship which  it is a pleasure to find in a book of first poems by a young  American A certain rhythmic monotony may be men  tioned as an impression gained from a consecutive reading  and a prevailing twilight mood united in the longer  poems with a vein of the emotionally feminine  Two short lyrics however I Am the Wind and The  Tragedienne stand apart in isolated perfection even as  the two Greek columns in the ruined theater at Aries  an impression recalled by the opening stanza of The  Tragedienne  Upon a hill in Thessaly  Stand broken columns in a line  About a cold forgotten shrine  Beneath a moon in Thessaly  This is the first of the monthly volumes of poetry to be issued by Mr Kennerley It awakens pleasant anticipation of those to follow  Lyrical Poems By Lucy Lyttelton Thomas B Mosher  The twilight mood also prevails in the poems of Lucy Lyttelton although the crest of a fine modern impulse may be traced in A Vision The Japanese Widow The Black Madonna and A Song of Revolution   Where is Owen Griffiths Broken and alone Crushed he lies in darkness beneath Festiniog stone Bring his broken body before me to the throne  For a crown  Oftentimes in secret in prayer he came to me Now to men and angels I know him openly I that was beside him when he came to die  Fathoms down  And Evan Jones stand forward whose life was shut in gloom And a narrow grave they gave you twixt marble tomb and tomb But now the great that trod you shall give you elbow room And renown  These poems unite delicacy and strength They convince us of sincerity and intensity of vision  A C H   NOTES AND ANNOUNCEMENTS  It is hardly necessary to introduce to the lovers of lyric and dramatic verse Mr William Butler Yeats who honors the Christmas number of Poetry by his presence A score or more of years have passed since his voice perfect in quality began to speak and sing in high loyalty to the beauty of poetic art especially the ancient poetic art of his own Irish people His influence reinforced by the prompt allegiance of Lady Gregory Mr Douglass Hyde the late J M Synge and many other Irish men and women of letters has sufficed to lift the beautiful old Gaelic literature out of the obscurity of merely local recognition into a position of international importance This fact alone is a sufficient

IN LINE ON TINT  By Edmund Dulac  QUARTO HANDSOMELY BOUND IN CLOTH BOXED NET 5 00  The weird imaginativeness of Edmund Dulac has accomplished a new triumph in this visionary interpretation of the great American classic In the illustration for The Sleeping Beauty The Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam and Stories from the Arabian Nights he had certain conventions of dress and landscape which had to be observed in his illustrations for the No Man s Land of Poe s passionate imagination he had no standards to restrain his extraordinary creativeness As a consequence he has produced a series of wizard conceptions more opulently typical of his own strange genius than anything that he has hitherto accomplished Here in one book are met the most originally imaginative of poets and the most originally imaginative of illustrators The result is a volume of unexpected beauty a collaboration in the truest sense  the outcome of which is a heightened scheme of loveliness  DAILY SONG  A Year Book of
